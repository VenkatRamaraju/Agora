hey shorties its one week away from the earnings announcements in consideration of how much loss you have experienced from shorting the stock last year here is a little friendly warning not to forget to find a good cover for your short you remember the last quarters earning with the record deliveries we had a record run up so if you know what is good for you
i do not want to go on a huge rant this is my opinion for any new investors that may not be able to take big losses no matter how well this stock is run or future potential if markets turn bad for hundreds of reason like interest rates spike due to money printing or us raises taxes to combat there spending that is out of control or 30 year bond rises unexpected all of these can cause a panick in markets and cause a major correction in all sectors these markets are grossly over valuated and its due to history low interest rates do your home work learn about fundamentals learn charts etc and invest not just on hype because you can be trapped in a stock very fast

from seeking alphasummary • despite having less than 1 of global auto market share teslas market cap is now greater than that of all nonchinese automakers combined • tesla is clearly priced for massive growth yet half of its current products are aging and its development pipeline is sparse • the tesla semi new roadster and cybertruck have all been unveiled they are already facing significant competition from other automakers • even if teslas most ambitious assumptions were to play out as planned it would not be enough to justify the current valuation • tesla is already seeing declining market share in the most mature ev markets as this trend continues in 2021 the growth narrative will likely come under pressureat present tesla inc nasdaqtsla has just four electric vehicle models in active production the model s the model x the model 3 and the model y the model s and model x while extremely innovative at the time of their introduction are now aging platforms in decline leaving the model 3 and model y to carry ever more of the load while both have proven popular their addressable market is finite as evidenced by tesla’s having had to resort repeatedly to price cuts to keep demand from ebbing throughout 2020 even in the supposedly nearlimitless chinese marketceo elon musk has stated that tesla aims to produce 20 million vehicles per year by 2030 far beyond the wildest peak annual demand projections for the model 3 and model y combined to achieve its goal tesla will have to bring a host of new offerings to market over the course of the next decade yet the company has struggled of late to expand its product development pipeline as i discussed in a recent article the tesla semi which has yet to enter production more than three years after it was unveiled is one clear example of this issue

not much upside and 8090 chance that top hit at 880 ibd advised that 67 indicators showed that tesla is reaching a climax run after a climax run comes a big pullbackpe ratio all time highps ratio all time highrsi off by one point from 2013 all time hightesla expected to make 31b in revenue but has a 800b market cap if anyone can find any other stock that has ever done this in the history of stocks tech auto whatever please give me the name apple disrupted the cell phone market when they developed the first touch screen iphone 35b in revenue at the time  175b market cap amazon disrupting brick and mortar business amongst all other thingshad a 3600 pe at one point but were making 5560b in revenue and had a 150b market cap google i’m sure you’ve heard of them highest pe they ever had was around mid 50s netflix disrupting streaming business traded at a about 450 pe at their highest while making close to 4b in revenue and had a 45b market cap highest ps ratio of about 12 so just compare tesla to any other major tech company and you’ll see the insane overvaluation here even though as it stands tesla makes most of their money from selling cars up close to 900 since march people need to get a close look and see that numbers like that can only be compared to com bubble welcome to the ev bubble you have companies like nkla with no revenue valued close to 10b there’s a new ev company every other day and competition is everywhere tesla could sit at this price for the next 35 or more years and still be grossly overvaluedreality is tesla is expected to make 31b this year 45b next year and 65b in 2023 with this growth fair value they should be around 300400b market cap and that’s still being very generous don’t worry there was plenty of blind fomo buyers in the com bubble as well they would speak the same language as the pumpers here keep in mind that it took investors 1015 years to make their money back and that’s if they invested in amazon looks like history will repeat itself this coming earnings report should do the job y’all better hope they smash expectations by at least 100 since they barely met 2020 delivery expectations i expect a modest beat at best then let the massive selling begin sell the newsleaving off with this on 123 musk stated to his employees that tesla needs “to cut costs or the firms stock price could be “crushed like a soufflé under a sledgehammer”  that was around 550 sp well we’re now 55 higher and i am sure tesla didn’t magically make any drastic changes to their cost cutting within a month should be a big warning sign

tesla cheats it’s investor calculating always with percentagesthat’s a big fraud you also have to consider the numbers absolute and these totals in prices shows the dilemma and what a big fraud the valuation is teslas fanboys ignoring this factto have 60 growth of one product like models y is not a good message in totals it is ridicolous and there is also a cannibalism effect with respect to model 3this shows all press releases focus on one good number while there are many bad numbers included  when there is a correct interpretation the valuation is the biggest bubble ever and will cost many shareholders big losses90 is my prediction jan 20 reuters  tesla incs vehicle registrations in the us state of california jumped nearly 63 during the fourth quarter compared with last year largely due to the success of the companys model y according to data from crosssell httpsinfocrosssellcomteslaspecialreport0 a research firm that collates title and registration datathe automaker reported betterthanexpected 2020 vehicle deliveries earlier this month driven by a steady rise in electric vehicle adoption even though it narrowly missed its ambitious fullyear goal of half a million deliveries during a punishing year for the global auto industrythe report released on wednesday showed registrations in california a bellwether for the electric carmaker and its largest us market recovered from a thirdquarter low of about 16200 vehicles to around 22117 vehicles in the three months ended decemberat about 11417 registrations in the state for teslas model y compact crossover utility vehicle surpassed those for the model 3 california registrations for teslas model 3 massmarket sedan fell 34 on a yearly basis to 7044total fourthquarter vehicle registrations in the 23 states where data was collected stood at 44749 with model y accounting for nearly half the registrationsregistration figures might not accurately reflect the number of vehicle deliveries during the quarter as registrations in the united states typically take about 30 days from the time of saletesla whose shares surged over 700 in 2020 is expected to report fourthquarter results after market close on jan 27 reporting by akanksha rana and ayanti bera in bengaluru and tina bellon in new york editing by vinay dwivedi
an unbelievable growth company sitting under your nose and most cant see it tesla haters keep comparing it to car manufacturers and no clear vision to see whats around the corner all antiquated ideas you need to look at the big picture no matter how many new evs are rolled out by ice manufacturers tesla stll delivered 500000 units and has 3 billion miles worth of autonomous driving data in a time where data is king ask yourself this how many more billion miles worth of data will tesla have by the time ice manufacturers catch up to teslas deliveries of 500k units now ask yourself this with 3 new manufacturing plants coming live for tesla 1 in germany 1 in texas and 1 in india how many more units will tesla deliver over its competition now look at the expense structure for both manufacturers tesla doesnt have a combustion engine division that needs to phase out tesla also is on its way to manufacturing its own battery and already produces its autonomous driving chip it alsi does not have contracts and licenses with dealer franchises tesla sells and services direct to the customer doesnt have to change its eco system who will be more profitable they will easily dominate the industry and i didnt even mention semi trucks and the home solar roof division
some smart but foolish investors cant get past that tsla trades at 175x 2021 eps intellectually they know a stock is the present value of future cash flow they know they compare tslas pe to forward growth they refuse to believe a car company can trade at 175x eps their objection soon every auto brand  porsche mustang and corvette will have an ev and tslas ev share will drop they miss that tsla has a 10 yr head start and tam keeps expanding as tsla enters new segments and markets they miss that tsla is much more than an ev company and so tsla remains unloved and incredibly cheap

theres reason to be positive on tesla as a company but not silly positive with the current stock pricing 1 tesla  23x ford  13x general motors  8x volkswagen  4x toyota volkswagen and toyota generate the most revenue of all automobile manufacturers ford and gm are among the top seven tesla is does not make the list of the top 20 peugeot doesif we cut teslas stock price in half its still very optimistic at 400share it would be 12x ford  6x general motors  4x volkswagen  2x toyota toyota revenues and earnings are 10x that of tesla how long will it take for tesla to catch up to toyota and be worth even 1x as muchanother example tesla brings in 12 of the revenue and earnings of peugeot peugeots market cap is 23b a fair valuation for tesla would appear to be 12b but ok lets give tesla a higher valuation for being innovative and possibly opening up new markets but this is speculative what multiple of a fair valuation makes sense twice as much three times as much certainly not 80 times as much

here is the upgrade noticeupdated  january 5 2021 432 pm estmorgan stanley analyst adam jonas raised the price target on tesla nasdaq tsla to a street high 81000 from 54000 while maintaining an overweight rating the firm set a bull case of 1232jonas raised 2030 volume to 52 million units versus 38 million unitsthe analyst comments while the range of outcomes is admittedly high the market has ‘chosen’ to ascribe a higher level of discounted value to tesla than that typically discounted for its peers despite the extraordinary run in the share price we continue to believe that tesla can outperform vs our sector in 2021 in our opinion tesla is still the best positioned company in evs and avs under our coverage due to its people its technology business model and access to capital furthermore it is important to note that the company has no entanglement with the environmental liabilities that burden its legacy competition put it all together and we believe teslas business model can unlock recurring mobility services revenue faster and more profitably than the competition we struggle to find a more innovative company with the ability to execute against the high degree of difficulty inherent in sustainable transportation and energy at scale we reckon its a rather short list

there are a few things that keep coming up that i think need clarification1 yes ark funds do sell tesla shares its because they have to in order to balance the funds if tesla rises significantly they have to trim shares so that a certain percentage of the fund isnt exceeded by tesla alone and so risk is managed since tesla has been on a tear its value in the funds skyrockets anyway its just normal maintenance for very wellmanaged funds and it signals no more than that if you have doubts visit the ark invest site and look at the number of shares held vs shares sold2 yes tesla is astronomically overvaluedif youre judging by standard figures and philosophy but as we know tesla tends to defy such valuation there are a few analysts who have recognized this early on and several who are finally coming around to the idea teslas value comes from the potential of all of its irons in the fire not just current car sales and revenue even if we ignore the attraction to elon musk for his various endeavors like spacex and the irrational exuberance and cultish nature of the stock we cant ignore the potential tesla holds in various sectors battery tech solar power electric utility car insurance autonomous cars and robotaxisand oh yeah cars its a long list yes there are those who kick and scream about it and its understandable nonetheless the reality is right in front of us has it crashed in the past sure its been quite volatile can it crash again absolutely can it continue to rise also absolutely but one thing is for certain its real and there are good reasons behind it even if theyre not the typical ones3 if elon musk decides he wants to sell some shares good for him i would if i had such a quantity i have no idea what he plans to do with his fortune but if he were to sell some shares it doesnt indicate a loss of faith or guidance part of elon musks compensation is stock if he wants to sell some shares he has every right to do so and should as hes worked hard for it and deserves his pay4 tesla is musks only publiclytraded company to get in on the others like spacex requires highdigit private investment if theres any opportunity available at all i do recall musk mentioning that if starlink goes public tesla investors would have first crack at shares im not sure about the logistics of that but it would be nice for us will spacex go public probably not as musk likely relishes the freedom to not have to answer to stockholders on that onejust my two cents hope it provides some clarity for those with concerns andor questions good investing and best of luck to all of us

if this share price is so high then where are the short sellers to bring it downthey loved shorting this stock to the max when it was around 200 presplit but here at 3900 now nowhy arent they teeing off on this
tesla will go above 3000 when biden signs the green new deal
this is the real mind blowing thing tesla produced 500000 cars last year and has a market cap of 766 billion and ford made 900000 of just f150s and has a market cap of 35 billion
most likely short term scenario price goes to 900 elon then announces another split stock goes to 1000 presplit on the news 5 for 1 then he issues another 5b in stock because there’s actually a tsla stock shortage now that institutions have to buy and hold due to sp then the share price splits to 200 without a decrease to accommodate the 5b offering elon gets the cash for rd and the shareholders get the returns easy peasy
here we go  tesla 10 000 points bitcoin 500 000 points let’s go strong earnings report we build biggest bubble ever  right 
after reading hundreds of posts on this board ive come to realize the question is not whether tesla is overvalued but whether the stock price will keep going up
tslas sp may very well start to erode now with little to no end in sight why too much real competition with many leading ev makers reaching 100000 in volume in 2022 tsla 2023 numbers going forward are going to get revised down gm comes out as a surprise competitor whom may actually be better positioned than tesla with many partnerships building cheaper cars and they currently hold the title for a best selling ev in china now  nio has battery tech that seems to be better than teslas but teslas biggest problem is the 25000 sub car market you know the main part of the car market for the average consumer many ev manufactures are much closer to the goal of a mass market 25000  ev gm is emerging as major competition for tesla  nio xpeng li byd right now  gms stock will go up more than teslas this year and possibly more than those other ev manufacturers as well everyone wrote off ice manufactures but gm has been making incremental upgrades the whole time dont count out ford with the mache either as far as im concerned tesla will maintain its market share on the higher end evs but doesnt have a chance against ev competitors that already have sub 25000 evs tesla makes 4 vehicles out of  100  different types needed to replace ice keep in mind that teslas rise from 20172020 had a lot to do with traditional ice manufactures only pretending to compete because they believed tesla would falter well fast forward to now and we can see that it is a much different environment with everyone working on evs
tesla to produce 800 million carspe is often used as a realistic barometer of a companies value with an auto producer that pe could be extended to cars produced for example toyota produced 88 million cars last year to achieve earnings their pe is 921 this indicates that toyota needs to produce 88 million cars times 921 years of earnings to meet market cap this total is 81480000 vehiclestesla produced 500000 cars last year their pe is 1628 and this is not a fully diluted pe multiply the two and the total is 814 million cars fully diluted and this number nears 900 million there is not enough raw material capacity to achieve this in the next 10 years world auto production in 2019 was 91786861 tesla at their present margin ratios which would include the sale of regulatory credits would need to sell every car in the world for 10 years to have a pe similar to toyota the tesla market cap is absurd at best buy it now and you will pay a hefty price in the next few years
future are up really nicely tomorrows going to be good for all those calls
a look into the future in norway 54 of all new cars sold are ev in 2020 audi sold 9000 etrons vw sold 7750 id3 although only entered the market in september and tesla sold  7000 t3 teslas market share dropped to 55 of all evs sell tesla it will become a niche techycar company over time with a market cap similar to bmw3 and mercedes
i expect at least 1share in earnings for the 4th quarter analysts have been sandbagging with low estimates tsla is very profitable now and would be even more profitable if it didnt have the cost of the options granted to musk in 2018post your own estimates tsla is very profitable now and would be even more profitable if it didnt have the cost of the options granted to musk in 2018 this would stop growing if the stock price would drop back down below 100share so considering that and all the cash tsla has raised i think tsla is worth that much that would be about 30 times what i project for 2021 earningsnone of this matters really as the stock price is so inflated the real question is what will tsla earn in 2022 and 2023 when the competition gets significanttsla bulls are expecting great things but its curious tsla is not spending very much on rd nor on capital expenditures in general for a company expected to grow 10 times in sales in just a few years tslas rd expenses were just a little under 1 billion for first 9 months of both 2019 and 2020relative to market cap tsla is now spending only about 01 on rd annually yet this is a tech company destined to grow 10 times in a decadegms cruise division 80 owned shows gms net investment in auto drive along about equal to tslas entire rd budget yet tsla has 10 times the enterprise value does this make sense

tesla competitive position around world1 they having hard time selling and retaining 10 market share in china that they forced to export something elon said not going to do at all just months ago2 they scared so much from new lucid car that lower model s price twice in two day even when lucid car not available3 they only manufacture model s x in fremont plant and no plan to expand anywhere they cant utilize 100 capacity of model s and model x as most not buying it anymore4 they are so scared from china competitor that they price model y way below market expectation5 europe model 3 is not no1 ev car anymore6 even norway which has highest ev market share in ev vw beat them with similar price id3 it actually bit higher as per my google search7 ev credit sale is only reason they have double digit gross margin and small net profit without ev credit sale  not clear who spending billion to buy as 80 of ev sale by other manufacturers and so by that way total ev credit worth 5b which does not add up at allso can they manufacture 5m cars by 2030 sure 15m cars sure why not 150m carsquestion isnt about supply those problem temporary and can resolvedquestion is demand they have bit edge in technology as per analyst estimate and yet other car maker already beating them in their own game  analyst forget other car manufaucture advantage and how they able to manufacture ev cars in large volume tesla stock jump 100b like they achieve something imposible task to manufacture 500k car even after raising 10s billion dollar though new stocks that china tesla has 12 market share and europo  10 now

here is my biggest concern with tesla’s valuation leaving a parking garage yesterday i noticed the incredible variety of cars around me many different makes and many different models hundreds people love variety their car is part of their identity and what differentiates them from others based on tesla’s current valuation the market is saying someday tesla will make at least 3050 of all cars on the road that would be an incredible assumption because of the desire for variety in the cars we like to drive i don’t see tesla able to profitably develop such variety i think tesla will grow into a very significant and important company but they will not be the apple of cars because the car market seeks variety

hey tesla long term investorswhenever i see a research analyst doing one of these doom and gloom prediction on tsla price i start to pay attention jp morgan analyst ryan brinkman in december upgraded tsla price from 8090 and i was like whats up with that with a sell rating because i have about 45 of my portfolio tied to tsla and i want to make sure i see what he is seeing so i did some research on what the guy is about i just want to report back that i dont have too much to worry about and let me explainthe guy is a legit automotive research analyst having more than 10 years of research experience in the automotive sector my problem is not with what background he has but its what he does not we all know there has not been a whole lot of innovations in the automotive industry except tsla until this year when all the automotive legacy companies jump on the bandwagon because of tslas established success in this area but we all know tsla is not just an ev manufacturer its also autonomous drivingartificial intelligence battery technology with current production unlike another company called qs energy storage robotics software development car insurance hvacetc now how could a guy like that covering all these areas with just automotive research background with a master degree in accounting oh my god just we need another research analyst with accounting background if its that simple joe from our own chat room can do his job easily i think an ideal person for this type of analyst has to have a combo of 57 years of auto manufacturing industry 23 years of sw industry 2 years of artificial intelligencerobotics experience and a couple years of solar energy solutions industry an analyst with this combination of experience would be very expensive for investment banks but its absolutely necessary to cover a company such as tsla welladditionally i always want to see what credibility does this guy have i have extracted some information on brinkmans past performance from tipranka site which keeps the performance of stock research analystsand share with everyone in the forumranked 6701 out of 7182 analysts on tipranks 14083 out of 15010 overall expertsaverage return of ratings he gave out 44i dont know about you but why is the media even give this guy the time of the day given that terrible performance record
if tsla delivers more then 500k vehicles in 2020 this stock will cross 1k easily
i am so excited for exactly one week from now on the 27th when tsla reports earnings get in now or youll be left in the dust when we beat earnings and rocket up past 1000

been looking around the web about response to nio day it is very bullish tsla has the high stock price it has relative to sales because of its tech first mover status and the future sales it will and is starting to yield nio just unveiled the type of tech that will have the same impact and comparing their growth story and sales levels to tsla it is obvious that nio should be waaaay higher not tsla levels but it should get to about 175 eoy it is not a matter of tsla vs nio it is tsla  nio vs the ice companies who are five years behind nio and tesla on the tech the long drive to 175 starts monday

on saturday ark published an update to its tesla tsla 029 valuation model saying it now expects the stock to be worth 7000 by 2024 — and thats the base case in a bull case tesla shares would trade at or above 15000 the bear case puts the stock at 1500 or about 25 times current trading levels
up 50 to 60 billion in a day market cap exceeds entire industry yup totally reasonable no risk here
investors business daily is a reliable resource for market news and analysis of stock charts ibd says that tesla has just experienced a climax run in trading just last week alone the stock is up 25 or 175 in the last 4 weeks its up from about 600 to 880 yes by definition thats a climax run which is doomed to correct substantially its not just the chart competition is and will be continue to be a major headwind  there are a lot of ev players in china and then you have vw and other us car companies theres absolutely no barrier to entry in this space tesla sells low margin cars and their profit is based on regulatory credits a correction to 650675 may be reasonable for starters
when ppl talk about tesla normally think it is auto company actually the energy sector is much much bigger than auto sector tesla will be big star in this sector too we will see how fast their energy sector revenue increase in the coming earning report

nio now has better batteries than tsla which can also retrospectively be upgraded in older cars within 5min better cameras for autonomous by about 6x lidar which tesla doesnt use nio has without question positioned itself as the pure ev play for anyone wishing to invest in the worlds biggest ev market not li or xpeng

tesla is five years ahead of the competition ok so at a 40 growth rate yoy in five years that means tesla will have to deliver just under 2 million vehicles to sustain its current growth at 100kaverage selling price very unlikely per vehicle that is only 192 billion in saleshow can this company be worth this much if in five years when competition catches up theyll only be able to produce and deliver 200 billion worth of salesmeanwhile ford has capacity and sales to deliver 66 million vehicles and investors dont care
i find it most interesting that rusch 1036 and ives 1250 new targets for the first time have not pushed tesla higher once upon a time in this fantasy world there long term targets would be hit in weeks in november ives raised his basecase stock price target to 560 from 500 best case you all fooled him so he more than doubled it basically in two short months say tesla is not a 560 billion dollar company but a 12 trillion dollar company yes 300 billion for the two existing and two to be built factories not enough cars built on the planet to support that number and you know what all of you bought it so why arent you buying it anymore
the day tsla crashes will be the day the entire market crashes because so many people will be panic selling everything else thinking it the end of the bubble tesla became god of the stock market thoughts lol
in 2021 tsla will lead the ev tech advancement and nio is aggressively working hard to follow crypto will slowly become an important digital currency and sq will grow with it afordable energy storage for microgrid will be provided by eose and they will be the key for power grid electrification
tesla likely hit a peak friday or it could keep rising for huge gains for a few more days with even bigger daily point gains selling at the very peak of a climax top is essentially the great fishing story for investors many will claim it few will achieve itinvestors may want to sell some tesla stock into strength because when a climax top occurs shares can fall to earth even faster than they riseafter a climax run stocks often suffer huge declines that take years to recover from qualcomm qcom finally surpassed its 2000 climax top peak last yeartesla stock had a climaxtype run in late 2019 to early 2020 peaking on feb 4 at a splitadjusted 19380 shares then plunged 64 to 7010 on march 18 with the coronavirus market crash no doubt contributing to the lossesperhaps tesla stock will have a climax top sell off and rebound rather quickly once again but do you want to sit through a 30 50 80 decline on hopes for a rebound if tesla stock corrects or crashes and then bounces back investors can always buy it back after the coronavirus crash tesla stock offered buying opportunities slightly below and above the february peak

most people on this board are not understanding the role low interest rates have played in soaring pes even with the fed plowing money into bonds the 10yr rate has jumped bigly to start the year what this means is that companies have to increase earnings by the same amount or else stocks will plummet watch the interest rates very closely if they keep rising at some level they will trigger a sell off

im outas a shorti cant do itthis makes no senseand i think i timed my entry into the short incorrectlyor there is really is something about this company which i fundamentally dont understandmy best wishes to all longs who have been correct on this all year longand even more so today i was wrong
people need to realize that tsla is truly a life time opportunity to buy in to a company that is literally changing the world for the better over the years people have dreamed of getting in to companies like microsoft and amazon that have changed our lives today this dream is a reality if you have the stones to buck the naysayers and embrace a great company with an incredible visionary leader for those of you who look at the financials of tsla and claim that we are in a bubble take a second to research the pe ratios of amzn and fb earlier on when they were establishing their foundations for success you will find that amazon had a pe of over 3700 and fb over 1400 there are many examples of extremely high pe ratios for companies starting out that went on to change the way you navigate in this world tsla is only in the 2nd inning of this ball game stay strong bulls and don’t let the shorts make you look in the rear view mirror some day and regret your decisions merry christmas

i have extended my short exposure massivlythe bubble actually stops and we will see abutting never seen at wallstreettesla to produce 800 million carspe is often used as a realistic barometer of a companies value with an auto producer that pe could be extended to cars produced for example toyota produced 88 million cars last year to achieve earnings their pe is 921 this indicates that toyota needs to produce 88 million cars times 921 years of earnings to meet market cap this total is 81480000 vehiclestesla produced 500000 cars last year their pe is 1628 and this is not a fully diluted pe multiply the two and the total is 814 million cars fully diluted and this number nears 900 million there is not enough raw material capacity to achieve this in the next 10 years world auto production in 2019 was 91786861 tesla at their present margin ratios which would include the sale of regulatory credits would need to sell every car in the world for 10 years to have a pe similar to toyota the tesla market cap is absurd at best buy it now and you will pay a hefty price in the next few years
not enough tsla stock to go around  a few weeks ago i wrote how tesla being in the sp now locks up about 150 mil shares in mutual funds that basically take it out of circulation there are probably more funds that also buy and hold cramer said on cnbc that there are not enough stocks to invest in so the high demand and low supply is making the price go up i agree with him completely if you had money you want to invest  what would you buy not money markets not bonds you buy stocks of course but which ones  you buy tesla of course and since there are less sellers  the price goes up
go cover your positions tesla shorties unless you like losing money
elon is playing with the shorts tesla deliveries have already crossed 500000 for the year i placed my order just today
now that the krazyness is gone stocks fly back up over recent drops
going to add another 17 shares tomorrow leading up to earnings
while teslas 499550 vehicle deliveries technically fall just shy of its 500000 target they are close enough to highlight teslas staggering growth and to suggest that the electric car maker was able to achieve some of the improvements in logistics and delivery efficiency at higher volumes that it was aiming for
i wouldn’t be surprised to see another 51 or 101 split this year

plug is in beast mode  loving it even a few days ago i thought this cant keep going up  but it does i learned a long time ago that plug is a lot like tsla in terms of being a beast that you cannot fight so you might as well go long and strong with it and buy on any rare big dips a year from now youll be glad you did
isn’t interesting that whenever gm surges that they are never pumped by cnbc like how they do tsla  more proof of the media’s corruption 
jim cramer we keep aiming higher    and higherwelcome to the world of the bull market 2021 style as tesla and others just keep going higherwe are raising the price target on tesla 750 to 1000
musk could and should raise a quick 10 billion with an additional share issue that would be enough to build several gigafactories and would only dilute the share base by a tiny 1seems like an obvious choice with the stock price at this level
stay long boys and girls earnings next week expect a big beat this thing is in range till q4 earnings buy all dips huge year ahead we are going to 1000 next week
