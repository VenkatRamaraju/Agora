Had everyone set their shares at $1500 to Sell?
158k cars being recalled because of touch screen failure. I'm glad autonomous cars will never fail.
Rebounding today?
Buy Buy BuyFriday 900$$$
"Looking Good! (TSLA, OZSC, TSOI)."
The TSLA long speculation and valuation are flawed. EV consumers worldwide want personalized design from a variety of automakers. This isn’t like the smartphone business. Otherwise everyone would have rushed to buy a Toyota Prius when they debuted 20yrs ago. That didn’t happen
Tesla sells out first quarter of Model Y electric SUV in China in just a few days!!!Long and STRONG!!!
Apple and Tesla are getting shorted. And you wonder why the average joe wanted to screw over shorts on gamestop
"Still a good earning report! Total Revenue Grew 46% year over year in Q4!!!! Name another business doing the same numbers in terms of total revenue as Tesla that's growing revenues as even close to Tesla at this rate??? I don't think you could find one!!!Btw, The Republican party is the party of Fascism!!!"

Guys stock market are down because investor are transfering/moving their account from Robinhood to other brokers. Robinhood might be in trouble soon and worst file for Bankruptcy. You better move too before its too late.
"It’s funny how at 400 nobody wanted to buy, and now everybody jumping in. Imo About 200$/share is due to momentum traders"
"QuantumScape will sell more batteries to OEMs than tsla ever will, as will GM."
Pelosi hexed TSLA! Just think how well the markets have done over the last 8 years until Uncle JJJOE...
"Would be interesting if huge hedge funds were selling big positions today in other companies, knowing that Tesla will make their numbers, maybe declare another upcoming stock split and reinvest their money in TSLA right before the close of the market today. Who knows anyone's guess... Good luck!"
"Musk said it was overvalued at $140, people don’t listen to him"
"Thanks, bought more today. :D"
everyone been saying tesla gonna fall but it kept disappointing you shorts and keeps going higher. hahaha
Elon Musk is shilling GameStop because Melvin Capital shorted Tesla a long time ago and bragged about it.
Hey! Tesla is NOT a car company. Understand?
Tesla starting to rise! Earnings not even announced yet!
$750 by Dec 21.
"Listen shorts, I'm here to help you. This stock has repeatedly broken through barriers and has showed no signs of actually dropping. Yes it makes sense it should drop, especially at this point, but I wouldn't bet your hard esrned money against this stock. You're gambling. And shorts against this stock have done nothing but lose."
"This is going to make put holders and shorts A LOT of money when this bubble pops. Of course, the key is that no one knows when that will happen but $200 PUTS are getting VERY CHEAP"
This is the best investment you can do: Buy Tesla! 
"Also, magical Elon did not hit his 500,000 target even though famed analyst Ives said it would be 10k above that number....another reason for the run up last week which will come down this week..."
"Everyone definitely has a different opinion about today. Because fundamentals are out the door, about the only thing left to trade on is emotion and there seems to be plenty of that around here.As I'm sure everyone knows, never panic and sell. You can panic. You can sell. Never do both at the same time."
Tesla's European market share was just 3% in NovemberEV YTD sales in Europe were UP 123%Teslas YTD sales in Europe were DOWN 14% Tesla's market share fell from 13% ( November 2019 ) to just 3% (November 2020.)
"If you heard CNBC:The Analyst states it’s an ‘A PLUS’ quarter. He’s positive about Tesla. Beat in revenue. Let’s wait for the guidance. If guidance is good, $1000 (and maybe another split) is close by."
tsla may very well announce another split
elon will start sell his shares next weekhe transfer to texas and waiting to 2021
Goldman sachs listed 32 stocks they think are in a bubble. Tesla wasnt among them. Why is that shorts?
"With the Democratic Party being strong on fighting climate change, Cramer said people start to purchase more Electric Vehicles. Companies like Tesla and the manufactures merging with growth special acquisition companies will see unparalleled growth, he said."
"The question is not when but how many fraud, exploding cars, hundreds of thousands recalls, blaming customers and and and will $TSLA s and Elons prestige build through fairy tale false narratives be able to take before Diving deep again? Asap, asap the s and p nonsense nonmaterial pump Ends and asap $NIO proves how it is eating up TSLA s marketshare in China. Nio is coming like a tsunami and Tsla is trying to compensate that fact with dumping prices, accelerating an already failing upscaling process. No billions can help there, this scams, $xpev and $tsla and $li will be slaughtered on the altar of truth and the truth is, only the unique on all spheres NIO business model and its ecosystem is able to relieve all the pains vast majority of potential customers have, when they think about buying a car. There will be again a moment like a few months ago, before the lies about NIo where spreaded, before the s and p nonsense tsla pump had begun, where only NIO moved and every other ev stock went down heavily including tsla and this moment will be back and I believe this is not long away from here, since we have already witnessed this shift in perception of the masses, Elon paying citron and others to spread lies about $NIO was just to cover that fact and NIOs shining, we are already back and our momentum is accelerating again while the momentum of others is dying AGAIN.LEEEEEEEEZ GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
This is not about panic is about overpaying for stocks this will go a lot lower once the earnings miss is confirmed and the delivery of vehicles will slow down from last year. The stock price and valuation will converge stock will come down and eps will increase than stagnate as competitors are already in with better products. Tesla great days are gone.
"SPCE is the future!!! These have TRIPLE DIGIT UPSIDE, note the video presentation viewed by 57,000 viewers so far: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxEFekPUuqU&feature=youtu.beanyone know when Elan $tsla is going to take SpaceX public??????????????"

will we be seeing redesigned model X and S models and will it drive sales?
Tesla stock raised price target to $1010 from $777 at Argus Research
Will TSLA follow GME on short covering buying frenzy on earnings tomorrow ? It is very possible - the trend for short covering is on.
"question for the shorts (and anyone with a view): if we are expecting a correction in the price next week, how do we factor in the sizeable holdings of S&P tracker funds now? As long as Tesla remains a component of the S&P, I would imagine a huge chunk of the shares bought in December (~70M on December 18th alone!!) wouldn't be sold off anytime soon right? any selling would be from smaller retail investors / investment funds with more discretion? Would be crazy to assume that as it is now part of the S&P, there is a lot passive capital that will remain invested in Tesla, and therefore keep a floor on any upcoming selloff?"
2hrs more till it joins the S&P!!!!!Congratulations Long!!!
"Howdy folks!I have a question for the board here tell me which one is a better investment here are your 3 choices!Tesla ------ (500,000 Cars)(Tesla secret they will surprise the market and sell 1 Million cars next year! Shhh, that's a secret! LMFAO Who cares that Toyota sells 10 Million cars a year! Who cares that Volkswagen sells 10 Million cars a year! Who cares that Tesla trades x 2 of both companies combined!Bitcoin--- Nothing backing it! US Dollars when cashed since that's the world's currency!Timeshares with RCI fees and cleaning fees plus money up front to buy it"
"tesla is the biggest bubble wall street has ever seen, real true value of this company is not more than $100"
Don’t buy option unless you get in n get out or get an option that expires in quite some time ... learner the hard way lost 3k last week Got it back with Mstr but still
"TSLA is no more a stock, it is a ever giving casino. There are vaccine stocks (BNTX, MRNA, PFE) that are giving life back to peopke and kickstarting the entire world economy, but stocks are going down daily. TSLA raiding on What: 500k cars for year (5% of what Toyota delivers, but 3 times toyota’s market cap). Also hear AAPL will start EV vehicles. How will TSLA compete?. With highest respect to Tesla and Elon, what is cult doing to TSLA"
"Shorties are saying, ""Ford is coming, GM is coming, blah blah blah"""
Let’s close the year at 700+
Tesla will deliver 500001 cars
"The extent of bear research: duh, it's a car company."
"All other car manufacturers are making EVs now, competition is heating up world wide."
Never buy a car that you can't service easily. Who wants to pay $1500.00 for a Tesla ranger to come out?
"don't try to save the sinking ship, save yourself first ...."
"PTON made my wife rich ;-) ACRX following, ACRX up 8% & climbing. $TSLA my big 2020 winner. also $NIO eyeing $kndi thoughts on KNDI?"
Imagine how much Tesla could make by just selling the chip to computer manufacturers. I hope they do so people can beat Apple finally.
Tesla will replace all federal government vehicles!! mark my word! 
https://apnews.com/article/us-news-f83f416dd7b9be7bb189fd00f20a16f8
Everyone go check out $BNGO Potential 100x with rumours of $ARKG adding it to its fund. Of course do your own DD and decide for yourself. Looking very similar to $NIO
"Getting a little anxious here......extrapolating the gains the past couple of months we should be at $1100 a share by now. So, why aren't we? Get on the ball, Elon! And Jeffie boy is going to take over your prized position - richest man on earth. Come on!"
"If will drop further. Typical Wall Street tactics. Drop before earnings so big bankers will scoop up your cheap shares. Next Wednesday, bam!! They will push it up for gains. Google. AAPL. Amzn. FB look at their history. Make a comparison, u will soon realize."
Now Fox business is saying Tesla may not be a casino stock
I love how anyone thinks tsla will do anything but go up.. everyone and their mom has Tesla stock. I wouldn’t be surprised if it went past 1T in the next year
"The top has been reached, congratulations long but the time to sell has arrived. There is no more upside left. Take profits and let it rest for a bit"
Too bad there are hardly any shorts left to squeeze it back up.
FAIR PRICE $350..over 60% downside on my calculations
401 million in selling credits. Pure profit. Half of earnings.
"I'm sitting on the side lines watching this, waiting with interest the latest Earnings. You can mute me all you want but I'm fully expecting a disappointing ER and this stock, even to trigger a substantial market-wide sell-off beyond Tesla's sector for the next few days. The latest report on EV sales made for dismal reading - this will be an interesting watch for sure. GLTA."
"December sales number from China < ===== GM outsells Tesla ... again GM ~33,000 EVs sold Tesla ~23,000 EVs sold"
"Musk is literally steve jobs of transportation...this one will be around a while. Little depressed by latest car designs...#hideous. Tech is great, but I feel like they're losing a big piece of differentiation with these ugly launches. At premium prices, most people want to drive something they like to admire in the garage. He's making it too easy for the other big names to catch up."
Hello TeslaCCIV deal with Lucid carsIf it happens Bad news to TeslaSee you at 600
It’s a red day over all. Most stocks are trading red in pre market. Hold
Tesla never sleeps buy before we hit $1000 next week
The original GameStop and poster boy of this Ponzi scheme of a stock market.
"Fun fact: If the market priced the new ""flying EV"" $GM 2.0 at the same 29x EV to sales it prices $TSLA at (total, unadulterated insanity) it would be $1233 per share. Imagine if like, 10% of the EV hype crowd drifts over to GM..."
"it cracks me up all this talk, we all know Tesla will have a huge price increase over the next 5-10 years. so if you have spare cash but the stock and enjoy the ride. it's pretty easy to pick winning stocks, what isn't easy is having the patience and ignoring the neysayers. good luck, you don't need it with this company or Vuzix or Nio or Amazon you just need time"
Look at the bright side...their government subsidy collection business is going bananas!
I’m still waiting for $280
grandpa joe effect in the market. he don’t care about america
All the twitter's traders are on $nnox today... wow! $tsla of imaging on the move! imagine with 501(k) being cleared. this stock will be 150-200
... Tesla target 2021 - 500k vehicle buy one get one free
"This should continue upward trend leading up to earnings report.  Then another breakout 1,000 "
"Report: Tesla 1,600 Years Away from Market Valuehttps://www.manufacturing.net/home/video/21232956/report-says-tesla-is-1600-years-away-from-its-market-value"
Some really positive news coming on earnings call. I expect Tesla will be >1000 by Monday.
Sub 800 today?
Can someone try to explain why Tsla is down today after these earnings?
Oops! I missed the $780.00...
"I want to buy expensive tulips! Give me all you have!TULIPS, TULIPS!"
"$TSLA is up by 2500% in a single year, in Pandemic Year. We need 3 more Pandemic, to PUMP Tesla BUBBLE to $10 Trillion Market Value with $1 Billion Revenue and $2 Billion Corporate Loss."
"Tesla released a video about the making of the 4680 battery cell. Interesting how the cover song in the video has a line about ""million miles"" and ""you give me a charge"". Great things will continue to come from Tesla in the coming days. Avoid the noise. The price will increase."
Have not been keeping up with volume lately. Noticed today’s volume is half of 3 month rolling average. Has low volume been a thing for the past few days?
"wow, glad i didnt buy, was going to buy 10K just 2 minutes before the market closed."
"Hey Long Term Investors:Now we have been having some analysts modifying estimates and opinions, specifically Adam Jonas/Morgan Stanley, Ryan Brinksman/JP Morgan, Stuart Pearson/PNP Paribas, and Gordon Johnson/on his own. I just want to share with you a summary of their metrics from Tipranks, and you be the judge for yourself on their performance.Adam Jonas - 4.25/5 stars, Ranked #942 out of 7,185 Analysts, average return per rating: 10+%Ryan Brinkman - 0.10/5 stars, Ranked #6,778 out of 7,185 Analysts, average return per rating: -0.51%Stuart Pearson - 1.00/5 stars, Ranked #6,091 out of 7,185 Analysts, average return per rating: -0.66%Gordon Johnson - 0.00/5 stars, Ranked #6,986 out of 7,185 Analysts, average return per rating: -9.6%I deliberately put them in descending order of their return per rating, because that is more data driven, and objective. Now who is the top performer of the 4 analysts who covers TSLA?"
"New Model S/X is the ACTUAL news... they look better inside and out, they go faster and further, charge much faster, and plaid models are game changers. Gonna sell a lot of these cars. $1000 a share is on the horizon..."
"Want to hear from everyone who bought this am at 895-900. Come out, come out..."
Came short of numbers.Some people canceled thier orders to buy Bitcoin.
As stated! Wednesday night is going to be fabulous
The problem with these Wall Street analysts is that they were slow understand Tesla and are now envious of those that understood the technology of Tesla. Now they’re mad that they missed the boat on this company as we longs will all be millionaires in 5 years and they will still be workin for da man!!!
"""tesla is five years ahead of the competition"", ok so at a 40% growth rate yoy in five years that means Tesla will have to deliver just under 2 million vehicles to sustain it's current growth. At $100k/average selling price (very unlikely) per vehicle that is ONLY 192 Billion in salesHow can this company be worth this much if in five years when competition catches up, they'll only be able to produce and deliver $200 Billion worth of sales.Meanwhile ford has capacity and sales to deliver 6.6 million vehicles and investors don't care"
"Tesla is the iPhone of Electric vehicles and will reach $2 Trillion over the coming years. Don't worry about competition; Blackberry, Motorola and Nokia didn't stop Apple, and neither will other companies stop Tesla, who has a 10 year head start over everyone"
Rocketman!
for every car sold by volunteers they get 1 shr of stock.
"If you sell to take profits, put them in $NOK"
a show of thumbs from the real investors who made money today
"Chinese Model Y base version now $38,000 with subsidy. Wipes out competition..."
"My neighbor just got his Tesla, what a beauty...Her and the car..."
Time to move to CCIV. It seems not much upside on TSLA at this point.
"Look at all these shorts complaining for a lower buy in price  the markets are tanking today, Tesla is doing well so far holding up. Happy earnings! Glta!"
"anyone know if Musk has been tested for Covid? Chapelle just tested positive, he was with Rogan and Musk earlier this week."
What happened yesterday was merely profit taking. nothing more. Bear trap.
This thing is going to 1000 within 30 days
"Here we go ... Tesla 10 000 points, Bitcoin 500 000 points Let’s go strong earnings report we build biggest bubble ever , right !"
Advice to shorts: try to short cheap stock such as Apple or Amazon that is 3600 stock before split( as we speaking now) just give it and save the rest of your money to buy groceries lol
"Everywhere I turn I see a Tesla on the east coast on some of the most densely populated states in the country. When you go to their website, there's no form to fill out with updates on availability, it's here and now on the roads this very moment with one heck of an infrastructure to back it up! There is no antiquated car buying middle man system where you barter for the price of the vehicle, everything is manufacturer direct, no independent dealers and complete transparency. Not only revolutionizing the vehicle but the car buying experience as well, long overdue!"
Tesla MIC MY 30% gross margin. I get chills thinking about the ER coming up.
See the buying action starting to fade.....see you in the 600s in a few weeks.....way overbought and it is hitting an exhaustion point....
I'm going to keep shorting this til I'm broke or rich. Money's money but it's personal now.
Owning 300 or less shares will be a difference maker. You still would have to work.
"Why is Tesla a better investment than Amazon? On the retail side, Amazon could never compete with Walmart, not even with Prime. Amazon didn't make a profit until AWS. No doubt Bezos did very well with Cloud, where Amazon holds a monopoly. However, AWS is 100% software, and software can be replicated. You are starting to see Microsoft, Google, Oracle, etc. grow their Cloud business. What about Tesla? Margins for traditional automakers are generally low. That's why most analysts were bearish on Tesla till recently. Musk figured out how to improve those margins with automation; specially designed robots in ""gigafactories."" For the first time, you have a car company approaching a trillion dollar market cap. Secondly, Tesla is penetrating China, which Amazon can never do, since China has its own version (JD, BABA, etc.). This puts Tesla in the same playing field as Apple. Lastly, the Tesla bet is not on hardware, but software, particularly level 5 autonomous driving. Tesla will be able to charge something like $1.50 per mile, reaping massive profits. So Tesla can reap similar profit as Amazon from software. If you think of Tesla as just a car marker, then it's clearly overvalued. With software, the valuation is much higher."
"Strong hands in the market & Tesla today, not going to sell. Made that mistake too many times. On days like today you win by holding and buying good opportunities. "
I am under pressure... P/E ratio of 1200 is just scary... I don't want to lose money when stock drops from $630 to $400+ ... should I sell or keep???
FSD isn't going to happen. Too many variables and they can't unleash this in the North with bad roads and bad weather. You may be able to do it in the bay area.
"Hey Tesla shorters, the PAIN is going to continue today for you lot!"
"Listen to the earnings call on Tesla Daily. Pay attention to what Elon is saying, not Wall St analysts."
TSLA over 10 times market cap as GM. Wow....who would Tesla take out if ready to buy another player?
Never a red day. Elon be like: don’t you DARE think about having a red day.
$1000 next week.
It is about ready to roll over for real.
ask me why I stayed with Tesla in 5 years. you really think that all these giga factories and the billion pumped into the company will fail 
Cadillac has a flying car.. see what happens when u legalize pot. You get creative. I think it will be very popular in calli. You can fly over the freeway. Lol
I’ve been seeing lots of Nancy Pelosi in the chat.....Pretty sure it’s her husband that bought the stocks..
Adding some more shares to flip later today. I'll sell to the shorts to cover later. I'm feeling nice... well I just need presents tbh.
How's everyone feeling the Earnings Report?
"""The market looks forward, not backward. The market sees $TSLA with 25% of EVs growing from 3% of SAAR now to 24% of SAAR by 2025. The market values TSLA delivering 4.8M cars in 2025, not 500K cars in 2020."""
2021 is going to be a very tough year for Tesla. Massive Competition all over the place.
TSLA is bitcoin and bitcoin is TESLA.... same people promote it... same people buy it... the music will stop.
"Analysts at JPMorgan said Friday they remained “highly cautious” on Tesla due to its stock valuation, but they raised their price target on the stock to $125 from $105, the lowest among FactSet-surveyed analysts.“While still suggestive of large downside, we do not regard our price target as ungenerous as it actually values Tesla as the world’s second largest automaker by market capitalization, behind Toyota and ahead of Volkswagen despite these automakers each currently selling on the order of magnitude of 20x as many vehicles annually as Tesla,” the JPMorgan analysts, led by Ryan Brinkman, said in their note."
"Cannot believe I will be able BUY more $TSLA, the best one ever"
Make sure you take note of the companies writing the Tesla recall nonsense today that is an old story from 6 months ago like Benzinga and Marketwatch. These publishers are under control of the market makers that try to scam retail investors: ignore their articles when you see them.
I have gotten a lot of my friends on Robinhood! We are all making money!! Fed printing money no end to it!!! Get on and get rich!!
I like to put the $tsla chart on top of the $apps chart and see that Digital Turbine had better gains without all the media and youtube hype.
"SHAH,Yes keep your shares...you will realize wealth beyond your imagination! Hold!!!!"
"Reality:It is not clear that even in the best of worlds that TESLA will every be more than 18% of the entire auto market.1. TESLA has only 18% of the electric car market now. It isn't even number 1 now.2. Toyota recently said it's making a 310-mile-range electric car that takes just 10 minutes to reach a full charge. Toyota is an experienced and well positioned class act.3. The FORD Mach-E is already being described as at least equal to the Y. I personally like it since I use my roof rack and the Y has a glass roof that cracks. Very difficult to fix it.4. Tesla's success has fueled the rise of electric carmakers. This includes Nio (NYSE:NIO), XPeng (NYSE:XPEV), and Arrival. 5. Arrival, according to Bloomberg article is backed by Fidelity and BlackRock and plans to build 31 EV plants by 2024. How many plants is TESLA planing?6. TESLA isn't even #1 on innovation. NEO's ES6 in a recent China's competition was number one among 22 finalists including $TSLA Model 3 and BMW X3. It self parks and self drives better.Those of you who are now wealthy from TESLA may want to remember that there may have been a boost due to short calls Wed/Thurs last week, but after the New Years you may want to take at least some of your profits."
$1k soon
Nice little rally...picked up another 15 shares @ $618....will keep adding on the dips...
share price is based on supply and demand. you know what to do.
Congrats to all fellow Tesla longs on a terrific 2020 during a global pandemic no less. Here's to more success in 2021!
Wow major buying immediately into after hours!
"Morgan Stanley said TSLA will be $1,067 in 12. Months."
Why is Elon treated like a God? how did he amass 150+ billion in just one year? what did he say that easily stroked peoples heads to think he's pushing out hundreds of thousands of cars? how does this all add up?!
"""Semi is ready for production but we dont have enough batteries"" - Elon"
"$PLUG is in beast mode -- loving it! Even a few days ago I thought ""this can't keep going up!"" -- but it does. I learned a long time ago that $PLUG is a lot like $TSLA in terms of being a beast that you cannot fight, so you might as well go long and strong with it and buy on any rare big dips (a year from now you'll be glad you did!)."
ark invest analyst pretty much said no robotaxi anytime soon but possible ride sharing app for tesla with human driver. more lies from king elon! buy a tesla and be a cab driver!
Of course there will be a lot more EV's (not just Tesla) by 2030. Tesla won't be making the majority of EV's. But that doesn't matter. People will pay a premium for quality. Apple does not make the majority of smartphones. $2T market cap.
"The Tesla longs are shaking now.apple and Hyundai and its subsidiaries Kia,Hyundai heavy equipment,Doosan,luxury brand genisis, Jiangsu Forklift kia rhino ,Ioniq etc along with the 100 million + sales in batteries for cars,forklifts,golf carts ,scooters motorcycles etc."
"Sell on good News, welcome to the real world folks. ;), thats wallstreet !"
Can we see 950-960 tomorrow?
New MCU to come with 512gb drive.
Tesla will have knockout Q4 earnings in a couple of weeks. Heading towards 1000 let’s go fam 
Tesla and Apple Long  Let’s go fam 
"Here’s a non-biased article for the dreamers. Expectations vs reality. Musk overpromising and underdelivering, meanwhile the stock continued to climb, disconnecting it from reality. Read up pumpers.https://apple.news/A2LZD5mFuTY6jLdvK4ofpyw"
We are holding up just fine. This is too big to fall dramatically a2-3% drop is reasonable
"At US$695.00, We are now extremely close to one more ALL TIME HIGH... And everyone knows how Tesla behaves every single time that it reaches an ATH!!!!!! ... GOOD BYE shorts... Or should I say poor??"
If you drive a Tesla don't buy the Spicy Bites from 7 Eleven! Will ruin your upholstery!!
I'm expecting Tesla earnings to hit the ball out of the park.
Now that it is in the SP500 there are lots and lots of shares to short.....I will go 'in' on either shorting or buying puts when this dog goes back up to 675.....easy money!
"Shorts like Chanos, Left, and Einhorn didn’t get nearly all they asked for with TSLA but the fact is they got all they deserved. If they weren’t billionaires they’d be on food stamps, eating a steady diet of government cheese, and living in a van down by the river."
Bounce
LETS GOOO!! SOLID EARNINGS
"Great buying opportunity ignored the bears this will gap up big, everybody is focusin on the other stocks right now but this will gap up big and are solid, so if your really want to make money this is time like most of us will"
"we all knew this was coming - margin dropped due to heavy price cut in last quarter due to lower demand.party is over - time to move on.all these speculative stocks will fall fast - $TSLA, $LMND, $GME, $AMC, $BB, $BBBY, $NOK..."
"tesla $800 earns 0.80 every quarter, ticker gold 23 earns 0.45 every quarter"
As long as it closes above $700 I am happy it ended in the high!
Yes ... here is comes!
BUBBLE IS ABOUT TO BURST HAHHAHAHAHAHHA
"I am a loyal Tesla supporters. Sold my stock and go short. Tesla doesn’t have catalyst anymore after Spx addition. Buy the rumors, sell the news. Watch how it drop another 20 percent like what it did after stock split and battery day"
The difference between Tesla and other competitors is that:- Tesla is focusing on the product and customer- Other car companies are focusing on Tesla
"Let's lay out a few facts: Tesla keeps lowering prices.Competitors are increasing their EV sales despite the lower prices from Tesla.Tesla shipped china-produced cars to Europe even though they just entered the Chinese market and had supposedly huge demand.Tesla has the most capital ever, and could potentially raise billions more capital. Why wouldn't they be building out more factories more quickly with such easy access to capital if demand is so high? The reality is that Tesla won't dominate the global auto markets. They aren't even taking the appropriate steps to do so. They should be working on 5 or more new factories right now if there was even the slightest chance of dominating the auto markets globally."
"Nobody talks about the 1 million robo-taxis that were to be on the road in 2020. And what about the 14 priced cuts in China last year? Awfully quiet about that.And those environmental credits are drying up fast.You make all the cars you want, but if the competitor prices you out with the same car, your done."
"Longs, we're extremely green today so slight drops doesn't matter.THIS IS THE WAY.Stay long."
Tesla cult try to call Bitcoin for help
A lot of you posting here fail to realize that in the long run Tesla is not a car company. Looking at Tesla as a car company is like looking at Amazon as a bookstore. Open your minds.
new high incoming $700
"Tomorrow, TSLA is a 4 figure stock"
Buy and hold for next three years. We will fly everywhere when the 500 kwatt battery comes out.
Buying Tesla and Bitcoin... More..
700 billion mk cap? Why so high?
Nice feeling making more money in a month than working my full time job for a year. Thank you Tesla!
I love buying on these dips... Picked up 20 more shares.. Cant wait for Earnings next week... $900 here we come...
Tesla gets pre-approval for the largest battery factory in the world located in Germany.
This thing is all over the place after hours. Watched for a few minutes here and it was up 12 to down 60 to down 30 back to down 55. Gonna have to wait a day or 2 for the dust to settle.
$GME can issue new stocks any time at much lower price like $20 and burst this bubble. $AMC and $AAL are already planning to take advantage high price of their stock and accumulate cash. $TSLA did the same last year.
TSLA been too quiet for a week....going to be a huge spike today?
"assault and battery days, we had battery day so today is assault on market day, bubbles everywhere popping"
Historic earnings Let’s go Tesla 
"Just one week from Monday TSLA will be part of the S & P 500.Tesla Inc. will be added to the S&P 500 Index in one shot on Dec. 21, a move that will ripple through the entire market as money managers adjust their portfolios to make room for shares of the $538 billion company.Good luck and GOD bless,"

I did and I am SO glad I did it. I went from 500k$ to 32m$ in just this year!!!!! You can not do this normal spreading your money out and HOPING to find the good one with 10% of your $$.THIS IS THE BEST GOOD ONE you will ever see. RISK IT ALL TO BECOME RICH!

"Check out the six month chart- solid, sustainable increase in valuation. Not like the possibly unsustainable charts you see with $nio or $tsla"
Well see 800 by end of week
"1,000 as projected"
"Even if these numbers are true ( they are) what a 20X overvaluation - party on Garth, we'll be back above $2000 again on Monday ! Tesla is a bubble. It's a car company first and foremost. Credit where credit is due - after 17 years of hard work the company sold 500,000 vehicles last year. Odds are that they will sell more cars than that in 2021. For kicks, let's give them credit for 1 million vehicles sold in 2021. At a price of $40k per vehicle that gets you $40 billion in sales.As I sit down to write this article, Tesla's share price is $771. Using 1.1 billion shares fully diluted outstanding, that's a Market Capitalization of $848 billion."
"$800B mkt cap... seriously?? may go up, but this will implode. if you don't think so I feel for your future pain. be careful."
Can anyone explain the nature of those impulses that move the price $5-$10 in 5 mins? While most of the time the price barely moves despite hordes of long/short lemmings from all over the world. The whole Tesla growth was made by such impulses
"lying snake ceo, they stoped folks from buying gamestop and amc, ehehehhttps://finance.yahoo.com/video/robinhood-ceo-short-seller-squeeze-214234911.htmlhelping the hands that feeds him..is this free capitalism at its best or what?"
"Stop your crying, sell and leave this chat room, SN9 launch  is today and 2 giga factories going live in 2021 this will triple by the end of the year!"
Why are people excited about earnings? I think the hype is better than the reality. Earnings will only highlight this. I think better to stay excited about Cyber Truck and Semi. Earnings not a good thing to wait for.
I am too smart to buy TSLA. That’s why I missed making money by investing in this Ponzi scheme.
"Tesla has confirmed that its next quarterly earnings report will be published on Wednesday, January 27th, 2021. Tesla will be holding an earnings conference call on Wednesday, January 27th."
"Can't resist so add $5k more ( couple long put expire 15th) This is new level of insanity. While 60K at risk mostly in premium, I think it worth it. I do have 2 short $700 call expire this week as well which I plan to keep rotate until it expire worthless so I don't count that in my losses or risk. Stock somepoint will go below 700. May be today may be month out or may be 6 month out. regardless I will earn great premium."
TESLA GOING TO THE MOON>>>>>MODEL Y SALES IN CHINA WILL BE HUGE>>>>60 PERCENT INCREASE IN REGISTRATIONS IN CALI ALONE
"Tesla's success has sown the seeds of its failure. If Tesla hadn't gone up 10 times from it's price last March, but instead just rose a modest 24% each year, it might well have been an a successful track to increase in value 10 times by 2030.But, Tesla soaring stock price has drawn in a huge amount of capital into the EV market. The market always overdoes it when there is technological change creating a new product. There will end up being excess capacity and all the EV makers will be fighting for market share and profits will be meager at best. At least 1/2 of them will end up in bankruptcy. This is the lesson of the past. The 1960's had the color TV boom. Every household was going to buy one. And they did and the TV makers went bust or were bought out by the Japanese.Aluminum was the growth industry of the 1950's as lightweight aluminum was revolutionizing products. The big three aluminum companies advertised heavily on TV as the metal of the future. Kaiser and Reynolds have disappeared and ALCOA is still around ceased being a growth stock in the 1960's."
Ok with Israel selling 3's at 75-100k ie 300% mark up. Figure in 150% increase in importation costs and you're still going to make hefty returns on every car sold with no cap on what you can import! Israel is going to boos the balance sheet huge in 2021.
Seeing it jump yesterday 10% with the after-hours like 70 billion dollars made me realize that this ponzi is very hard to predict and the people involved are orchestrating this. A jump at this valuation in a day is like 50% when it was 5 times lower. Just imagine not even 1 year ago on no news a jump of 50% in a day. Don't you think there's something odd about this? This is a scam both for longs and shorts.
Any link to watch?

"The casino takes the money of shorts and longs. Shorts just see it faster at the moment and longs want to hold it because it goes up, but when the drop comes the longs will lose as well. The casino is well orchestrated. Didn't think would go so far. Stay out if you don't wanna lose or in if you think you manage your timing right (which for the vast majority shorts + longs will be missed)"

"Hello fellow Kandi holders, Tesla’s earnings is a bullish sign for Kandi. It means that Kandi and potentially other Chinese EV companies are starting to take market share from Tesla. Tesla shareholders need to realize that Kandi is a fierce competitor with fundamentals that could be arguably better than Tesla’s, eg a better battery that can be swapped in record time? Also the fact that has US expansion to add to catalysts for its fundamentals. I’m really happy with where Kandi is and plan to hold and buy on any extreme dips. Such as where we are now. Good luck all! $KNDI $TSLA"
Tesla investors wouldn't it be wiser to switch to Nio? I am curious how you think about that

"I don't make predictions, I make plans. I plan to buy puts and increase my short call positions if TSLA climbs above $900. If TSLA falls below $800, I plan to buy back some short calls. If TSLA climbs to $1200, and put prices fall proportionately, I plan to start accumulating some $600 strike puts with a 2023 expiration."

"A stock's price -- and its entire market capitalization -- is all based on the price of ONE share: the last one to trade before the quote is published. Volume numbers can be meaningless with algorithmic-trading, where a single share can be traded back and forth between two computers millions of times in a day, creating completely fictitious appearances of liquidity. So long as no significant numbers of shareholders try to sell, everything looks ""wonderful""; but the moment one-too-many shareholders try to convert their paper-gains into real money, the entire house-of-cards collapses."
Biggest chance to buy a dip in a lifetime. GameStop and Reddit has brought instability to the market this shall pass
"Here me out. Don’t sell. A lot of people are going to be coming into a lot of money after all of this.Thinking ahead. If you want to invest to help yourself and hundreds of thousands of others you might consider $PCG. It’s a utility company (electric/natural gas) in CA. They recently signed a deal with $TSLA. The company came out of bankruptcy recently with a new law enacted (AB 1054) creating a 21 billion dollar fund to protect against future fire claims. This stock traded at $50 to $75 a share pre 2018 campfire which decimated a town. The victims of fires have a trust holding shares of PCG and need to sell them to be reimbursed for fire damages. While selling the shares will bring down the price, I believe this is a good investment. Dividends will be brought back on board and the company is a cash cow – It’s an electric company – things are moving towards electric and they were already making money – and they have gov backed insurance (billions of dollars worth now). Getting in soon, could mean quintupling (or more) your money. You help others and get richer. Sorry to be long winded, but it’s an option I wanted to throw out there. It’s up to you. Thanks – upvote if you’re a diamond handed bull!"
"Everyone is hooked on TSLA and everyone has TSLA in their portfolio. All the money managers are racing to add TSLA and also pushing this higher and higher. Don't get left out... one more hour to add before a sharp move higher next week to $1,000. EZ as ABC"
TSLA is the king of EV makers. TSLA will be here for a couple of decades beside all competitors. Competition is always good for consumers. Watch out for Solar roof.
Tesla has a 2% net margin. They would need to do 1.5 trillion in sales (25 million cars @ 60K) with a 25 PE to justify this market cap. VW is the largest car manufacturer and sells about 10 million cars a year.
"Back up to $2,000 Would be nice lol"

"Shorts had a couple of good days they are so happy like a zombie invasion. Remember, time is on the longs side, shorts are too limited in their war chest. They have either shorter puts because it’s cheaper, so they take the time risk. Or they are shorting TSLA, that is a more dangerous approach because they could get margin call or they can quickly ramp up the losses for every dollar TSLA goes up. So longs, wait it out and be profitable. Time is the most valuable tool we have."
"Yes, the shorts were correct last Friday. The surge last Friday was not based on TSLA fundamentals. It was maintain caused by the supply and demand of the shares. I have doubts that all the index shares are bought last Friday, I don't think the market filled most of the needs of the index funds. Some funds will probably wait until they absolutely have to. I think there are still surges left in the next couple weeks until all the buying is done. I don't have data for any of this but it's only a theory for your consideration for your scenario planning. For me, I will just hold it for the long time. To me, that would be the most profitable way. TSLA still has too much left to do."
The earnings report is actually a good thing. You want to load up on shares based on a slow report because this is only the beginning of the S curve.
Is there a point at which TSLA is considered overvalued? Or does it have infinite value? Valuation is approaching 5% of GDP.
C'MON MAN!! When that totally autonomous trip across the country is completed by the end of 2016........THEN YOU'LL SEE!!

"Tesla was unstoppable in 2020, but 2021 is a much different story with GM, Ford, XPeng, NIO and many more all bringing competitive EVs to the marketplace. Tesla 2023 growth numbers going forward are not necessarily something they can achieve ""anymore"". GM working with Geely, Black-Berry, Xpeng has FSD and a new car, NIO is planning on manufacturing a less expensive car and they have introduced a new battery tech offering staggering amounts of range with 1000K as an almost average 150KW battery pack, Tesla is scooped by the Solid State Lion IPO spinoff for NIO. And virtually every country now has EVs and most are much lower cost than Teslas and remain unexposed to the EV behemoth. Tesla's blind spot is the sub $25,000 EV auto and I think they will be beaten to the finish line with many other competent EV manufacturers already closer to that goal. Tesla is manufacturing 4 different types Vehicles out of ----> 100-200 different vehicles types used today. <---- ... that will be needed to replace ICE vehicles. When Tesla goes down (which is personally believe 2021 will be the year) it will take the whole EV industry with it, but fast rising names will be NIO, GM, XPeng, Li, Byd and maybe even Ford. ""The future is unwritten"". it's time to ""hedge"""

Tesla has added the market cap of second-place Toyota just in the last month, with Tesla now having a valuation that is equal to 9 of the largest car companies combined.Toyota $215B market capVolkswagen $98B market capDaimler $77B market capGM $59B market capBMW $59B market capHonda $53B market capHyundai $39B market capFiat Chrysler $36B market capSuzuki $24B market capTotal: $660B market capTesla $659B market capTo put this in perspective:Toyota sold 9,000,000 cars last year for a profit of $6,000,000,000.VW sold 10,000,000 cars last year for a profit of $19,000,000,000.Daimler sold 3,300,000 cars last year for a profit of $3,000,000,000.GM sold 7,700,000 cars last year for a profit of $8,400,000,000.BMW sold 2,500,000 cars last year for a profit of $5,000,000,000.Honda sold 5,000,000 cars last year for a profit of $4,000,000,000.Hyundai sold 4,300,000 cars last year for a profit of $3,300,000,000.Fiat Chrysler sold 2,200,000 cars last year for a profit of $4,000,000,000.Suzuki sold 3,200,000 cars/bikes last year for a profit of $2,400,000,000.Total 47,200,000 cars sold for a profit of $55,100,000,000 (over $55 BILLION in profits)Tesla sold 367,500 cars last year for a net loss of $862,000,000 ($862 million in LOSSES)The Tesla ""story"" is rooted in the fact that at some point in the future the fundamentals will justify the valuation. It's based on starry-eyed believers justifying Tesla with vague rationales like:It’s a software company!They’re so advanced!They’ll save the planet!They have rockets!You just don’t understand!And if everyone just keeps buying, the price keeps going up and everyone makes money. Like any pyramid scheme, you just need to keep recruiting new investors. There are still a few grandmoms and taxi drivers who haven't bought Tesla stock.Guess what - these silly stories can't go on forever. It ends when people can't afford to buy Tesla's stock anymore. When no cash is coming in, it doesn't matter if Musk is ripping bong hits or doing goofy dances. You can't have a stock rise a multiple of 8 times during a year of economic collapse/pandemic unless the company in question somehow profited from the economic collapse/ pandemic (hint, it didn’t). And just because many people have swallowed the Tesla stories hook, line, and sinker and banter around asinine arguments doesn't mean anything other than the fact that Tesla has become cultish and thus has had its stock balloon to preposterous proportions. For there will always be the small inconsequential issues of valuation and of profitability, you know the old outdated stuff that the rest of the business world is made of. LOLWe are witnessing the largest bubble in a generation. And its deflation will have a ripple effect everywhere…Tesla can't trade at these prices forever because the mirage, the illusion, eventually dissolves and the bright cleansing light of reality will shine through. All these new and terribly inexperienced Robinhood traders are to learn a hard lesson or two in investing, for at some point the house of cards falls."
Chamath P. says Tesla is a disruptor company and another disruption coming where we will see Tesla double maybe even triple!
Tesla is a good stock to invest 1375 is too cheap. This is the year end sale price. Buy with both hands.
Musk nattering on again about robo-taxis. Tesla is against lidar. Wihthout it you can't have level five autonomous driving as needed by robo-taxis. So Teslas will NOT be robo-taxis.
Has anyone backed out the advertising expenses going forward once Tesla has to differentiate its EVs from those of dozens of competitors that are newer and shinier?
Elon Musk's foundation has donated $5 million to Khan Academy.
"Why Tesla will continue going up and 100% of the EV SPAC's going public 2020/2021 will fail. One easy answer......money $$$. It takes a massive amount to make a EV company successful. Just ponder/think about this quote talking about the Dyson EV disaster.......................While the company reportedly set aside some £2.5 billion for the electric vehicle project, that pales into comparison with the £50 billion-plus Volkswagen is spending on producing its own electric vehicle – and it has pre-existing experience designing and manufacturing cars. Volkswagen has even recognised that amount isn’t ENOUGH, partnering with Ford to share costs and collaborate on ideas. “I think Dyson hugely underestimated what it COSTS,” Bailey adds.Where are all those EV SPACS going to get that kind of money to become successful like Tesla? They won't and will fail. Tesla and the huge auto makers will only make it. Even some of the large auto makers IMO will fail, thus leaving Tesla as the market leader the rest of our lifetime. The EV SPAC's of 2020/2021 will all be destined to fail. Tesla to $10,000.................."
Slip sliding today... SURGE tomorrow!
Tesla partners with Samsung on a new 5nm chip for full self-driving...
"Isn't it about time for another split, issue some more shares, leak some e-mails, have a battery day, aa new car that runs on salt water.........something to get us higher??"
Tesla Daily has the lowdown on the earnings call. Elon was very bullish.FSD and Supercharger network will be licenced out to OEMS. :D
grabbed 5 900 calls for 8k did i waste my money or make 100k when it closes at 1100 this friday
Tesla is running. Friday $ 700 or more ?
Longs unite part 2 ... Let’s ALL buy some more Tesla tomorrow! Shorts deserve the squeeze ... we deserve some shares on sale. Win/Win! Who’s with me? 
Can Elon Twit for Tesla as he did for GME 
Volume at more than 44 million and stock up 6.6%. Just WOW.
tell me if I understand this correctly...Price (market cap) at close tomorrow determines the weight of Tesla in the index? Which determines how much stock will be purchased? Also funds were able to do some purchasing prior and some after the date?
tesla will be first to produce 25k 4 wheel drive EV with range of 200m+.ARK investments cathy wood says-The EV game is over. The graphene battery pack will be too late.Tesla has already won.
"Give me one good reason to sell without saying ""overvalued,"" ""bubble,"" or ""GM."""
to the moon
$900 is next boys
"P/E of 1400. This means even assuming constant growth rate, it takes over 500 years to make your money back. Tulip Mania about to burst "
There's no way the market will let Tesla drop. There's over 12888 open interest on 850 strike calls worth over 12million. Today's going to be bullish.
"Tesla will halve very very soon. The valuation is MASSIVLY too much. Ridicolous 175-180 TE Cars 4 th quarter, in total maybe 650 TE per year. AND A VALUATION OF 625 MIO EURO?????Volkswagen and Toyota sell 10 Mio, cars per year, profitable and with a lot of models for each segment, Tesla is one car show, but has the valuation of all car companies together?This is not explainable and nothing else but a big fraud. Hence the bubble will burst dramatically.Apple attacks Tesla in its heart, Disruption will Tesla will kill Teslas market value to minimum 50%."
guys if tesla goes to 1000 next week i will be a millionare. I have my whole portfolio in options im up over 1000%!!!! im only 19 years old!!!
So tired of hearing the “Tesla isn’t profitable without emission credits” baloney. Capex was over 3 billion in 2020. Emission credits a few hundred million per quarter. What that means is if Tesla would stop pouring money into building the most efficient factories in the world they’d be wildly profitable now. Building the factories is the right move of course. The emission argument is bunk.
$TSLA a 800B market cap only has 60 people viewing it and $BNGO has 97 people. Just saying. Innovation
"Can any of the doubters come up with anything other than ""overvalued"" or ""recall of cars"" ??"
"With a current P/E (fresh off the press) of 1,324, you would assume that the company is growing revenue at 200% or 300%. Or perhaps earnings were amazing.Unfortunately once credits are backed out, the company continues to lose (a lot of) money building and selling cars. Their revenue per car is declining and their growth, marketshare and various other measures are all starting to stabilize or decline. How long do the Tesla bulls expect this to last?This month, over 50 individual EV models have been sold. Competition is coming and it's just getting started.Guru."
GUYS SIT TIGHT AND BUY THE DIP>>>THERE IS NO WAY THEY ARE MISSING>>>THEY JUST SOLD THE MOST CARS IN TESLA HISTORY>>>>HUGE BEAT COMING AND STRONG GUIDANCE FROM ELON>>>AND THEY HAVE 20 BULLUON TO EXECUTE>>>THEIR HIGHEST REVENUE DRIVER FULL SELF DRIVE IS COMING OUT THIS YEAR>>>AND THEY Are ENTERING MODEL Y INTO THE BIGGEST EV MARKET IN WORLD>>>AND IN HOUSE BATTERY PRODUCTION HAS BEGUN>>>STAY LONG BIG BEAT COMING
750 tomorrow
"WOW!! Creepy Joe needs a Nobel Peace Prize for crashing the DOW below 30,000 in such a short time!!"
"Sorry longs, TSLA won't hit $900 again any time soon barring some new hype from Musk"
"any of you ""robinhooders"" following all the charges against ""robinhood investing app"" ? in a nutshell they were sued for $65 million for misleading you into believing you will make money, easily, ... and more disturbing they were charged another $65 Million for selling your orders to institutional investors so they could then trade your order you over for ""market sell,buy"" orders. They would trade your market order in a much lower priority generating more commissions or profits on your sell or buy. ""The Retail investor is cannon fodder for the institutional investor"". keep that in mind. Merry christmas."
Tesla stock dropped but now going back up. I bought at $840. Just a glitch to riches : )
"Oh look at that. Apple will partner with Hyundai to build Apple cars in the USA. If you think Elon is going to own the entire EV market, you are dreaming.Keep dreaming dreamers."
%15 pop upwards after earnings... let's get elon twice as wealthy as sleezy bezos
ALL of you know Tsla is my favorite stock of all time. I am happy it fell a little i was expecting this and bought more shares now after a 10 percent loss. Thank you for all your hard work and vision TSLA.
"Long term investors: wouldn't you want to invest in a company such as TSLA which has its product roadmap all built out, it's just a matter of achieving them.... or do you trust other EV makers which announce 1,000 different products without any idea what they will do a year from now? Hope you know the answer to this, as I do."
"The single most common reason why people buy $TSLA is that everybody is buying it. But no, it's not a bubble."
2020 ends with ALL TIME HIGH! What shorties don't understand is that Tesla investors buy and hold. That's why the float is so low. Investors don't care about Market Cap. They believe in Tesla and Elon. This will continue to go up and split again in 2021! Thanks Shorties for all the $$$$ in 2020!Happy New Year and Continued Long Success in 2021
Another happy day for Tesla longs. Not selling a single share. Congrats everyone 
Solid day for TESLA :)
Robinhood lets you sell GME but you can't buy it <==== WOW I wouldn't touch GME with a 39.5 foot pole - but I can't see how Robinhood gets to decide what their customers can and cannot do. Maybe there is some small print in their user agreement but I have never heard of this before.
Just a healthy correction. Nothing to worry about. Charts still show the stock headed to $1000 by next week.
"for those tha feel the impending correction of tesla in the immediate future, I'm not here to bash tesla, love the company, have the utmost respect for musk especially in the direction he has been able to push forward in. What I am here for is to explain what is going on with valuation. anyone saying tesla will go to 20k is just ignorant. I know tesla doesnt trade on fundamentals, but think about this for a moment. tesla has been the most shorted stock ever. when they hit the sp500, bigger funds begin to buy in, making those that recently have been short, unable to continue and have been forced to buy back the stock at a loss (increased price). this will not last much longer. eventually you will have some big time shorts (currently just micheal Burrell) come in and this will fall hard. it will get back up but do you want to risk that much depreciation? look at the numbers. you should invest where you can make 100 to 400% over a year. can you look at Teslas market cap and really believe all the big hedge funds that are now buying in are going to hold when it reaches 30 or more % than what it is now? and how hard do youthink this will fall? I've been investing in spacs for less than a year, what do I know right? I do have a portfolio that has gained 756%. and they arent sitting in overvalued positions. they are reinvested into companies with the potential for 3 to 400% returns for the year. currently my latest position was in hcac warrants (hcacw) I bought them at 1.8. also. bought more at 3.5. they are at 4.7. now they already merged with canoo, and will likely get to 10 to 15 in the near future. everyone should have seen by now hyundais surge, nearly 20 billion added to market cap just on the rumor that they are in talks with apple. heres the fun part. canoo is doing the engineering services for hyundai's ev sector. they have designed their new skateboard platform for them, they have their own as well and will be a disruptor in the market in so many ways but just think about this, #AAPL has talked about their monocell as superior battery tech. they are now talking with hyundai. musk has said that monocells are ""impossible"" and canoo tweeted the new year in with ready to keep engineering the 'impossible' in 2021 as if to give musk a heads up. then of course left with this:just read between the lines, but the rumor and sell on the news. I'm not here to pump, I'm here to help those that have a gut feeling right now listen to it. it's made me 756% for 2020 and I'm already up another 60% since then. canoo is #GOEV. warrants are #GOEVW. roll your profits over and gain another big run. them when tesla has had its correction we can be ready to jump back in again.."
Tesla was my most regretted stock that I sold in 2019 at 80$ with 1000 shares
"The drop from the prior high to the current price is not much of a drop at all. Given all the good news that's priced in, if Tesla gets a bad earnings, I expected the stock to get whacked. It did not get whacked. This unicorn stock will not sell off properly."
"Two things I know for sure: 1: 'If' the selloff continues. (let's say it drops to under $500.00) shyster lawyers will be reaching out to stupid investors looking to start lawsuits.2: Shyster Democratic politicians (Bernie Sanders - Elizabeth Warren - A-O-C) will jump on the bandwagon to do some good old political grandstanding. It will be the same old rhetoric, they'll say John and Jane Doe lost half of their life savings by buying Tesla stock. The markets are rigged for the rich, etc, etc, etc."
"minimum wage to bash tesla all day? no skills experience or education required? that explains everything @SAKHO, @FastFire, @Cyclical Engiqwear, @Ckoctor, @GigaFreefall etc"
"I'm a student who just started stock market trading and for someone with not a lot of money I missed the opportunity to invest into tesla even when it was 600 because the price was too high of a risk for me. now that it's at 880, do you think it's smart to invest or will it drop soon?"
this must be what.... a triple or quadruple top formed so far?
i holding a few shares. should i sell it or hold it till earnings
"How many exploding, falling apart, recalls, bad service, blaming the customers can take the prestige of $TSLA – especially when the S &P non-material pump finds an end. Upscaling and with that hallucinated Revolution failed, we, $NIO will take it from here"

Hey p/e 1665 is wayyyy tooo loooowww dudes
"guys!!BofA analyst John Murphy raised the firm's price target on Tesla to $900 from $500 and keeps a Neutral rating on the shares. The stock is ""driven by growth afforded by valuation,"" said Murphy, who has tried to estimate what the current stock price affords to Tesla in terms of incremental plants and units and what those incremental units translate into in incremental revenue and profits. Building automotive industry capacity is expensive and often generates low returns, but ""the higher the upward spiral of Tesla's stock goes, the cheaper capital becomes to fund growth, which is then rewarded by investors with a higher stock price,"" argues Murphy."
"I hear a lot of comments about the S&P index funds. You don't need to tell me this stock is overvalued or it's a bubble or it's crazy or it will be 1000$ tomorrow or 200$. I hold shares of Tesla as well of other stocks. I'm not a day trader, but I sell some shares sometimes, to buy other stock or buy back later or just to keep the money. Most of the time I keep the shares for years. I'm not a professional. I'm trying to figure out how it's working and what to expect. I read articles saying 120 million shares must be bought by next Friday. He read a lot of comments. Some people are saying it won't make any difference. On the contrary other people are saying it will go up, then down later. Some people said those shares are already bought. It's a bit confusing. I think the price will go up at some point this week. I can be wrong. But if the index fund must buy, it will create a pressure, isn't? Thanks"
"I am 27 years old and my fortune is over $25.6 M thanks to Tesla; and that is before next earnings of which I predict my fortune will exceed $200M. Here is my story although no one asked or even cares.My last job was flipping eggs and bacons at Denny's (minimum wage) where I worked for 12 years. I started investing in Tesla when they went public. In fact, I decided to stop renting my apartment and move into my car back then in order to save and invest in Tesla. And look at me now I am TESLANAIRE!!YES YES I'm always here in this forum in the afternoons so I can brag about it. And by the way, after next earnings as my fortune will exceed $200M, I'm planning to vacation in Mars then, anyone interested?"
"I'd be careful on predicting the S&P 500 demand on Dec 21 since we don't know how that is going to play out (ie. some have ""already"" bought in the Nasdaq). I seriously doubt money-managers are going to be falling over one another trying to buy on the Dec 21, yes they are supposed to keep a ratio proportion of the S&P 500 stocks BUT keep in mind the level of ""contempt against Elon"" from Wall Street (ie, $80 valuations etc...). I think they are planning to drop it by $100 within days (if not hours) of the S&P inclusion. As well those ""requirements"" to adjust portfolios aren't not LAW and all Money managers have flexibility to buy over time, not just on Dec 21 st as implied. Also on the cusp of the S&P 500 inclusion J.P. Morgan said they are advising money manager clients to ""Not buy Tesla Stock at these valuations"" So. If you need to sell consider anything over $650 (I'm a Tesla Bull but that is a high price to pay assuming the future will play out perfectly)"
Tesla just keeps trucking along making money and growing. Congrats to all the strong Tesla share holders. 
Tesla is going down..In Europe they are loosing. In 2019 Tesla had 34% of the EV market. In 2020 only 13%....
Gamestop is just a replay in fast motion how Tesla got here. Thanks shorts for the good job :)
Hold the line people no matter what the ER says later. Shorts you cant win.
"can you imagine if reddit WSB did a ""GME"" with Tesla???Wow, Tesla price will be over $2000....please do the $GME with Tesla.Let me see a $2000 tomorrow!!!!!"
Tesla's standout from the crowd no doubt. Saw 3 in the same lane today. White is the color that stands out the most. They really are appealing!
Sold all at 717. Will re-evaluate next year
"In order to keep up with the current valuation, they need to approve, but showed some issues. They will talk about solar, storage, battery, space, robo taxi to pump up, but all words, not enough users backed. Maybe, people thought other companies may wait to their death until Tesla conqures the world. Extreme buble and fake, but try not to bet against people's dream, so my position is neutral."
TSLA within 5% of all time closing price of $880. Go Tesla!
AAPL said its about to announce something big... I would be surprised if Tim Cook announces that they have sold AAPL to TSLA. LoL!

who is still holding (have not sold a single share) from pre-split day?
Tasla doesn't need to sell car to make profit tasla just need to sell their own stock to make profit
Common sense would tell you not to invest in a bubble at this point. Tesla's stock is that bubble.
"Terrible company, cant fund itself on operations only capital raises. Not good. See ya at 75 in a year."
"Musk tweets about GameStop, bitcoin, dogecoin and others, but he seemed not to care about the earnings report. How can people find this even interesting? I find it shocking.

"Michael Burry is shorting Tesla. He says it will crash like the sub prime real estate bubble. I am up 97% since the split just last summer. I keep thinking I should buy more. It never seems to go down. It will eventually, but then again. $880 isn't that expensive. Maybe I could hold until it reaches Chipotle's price."
"Maybe instead of short shorts, Elon should start thinking about selling long Johns.Hopefully, they won’t spontaneously combust...like his cars."
green all day
"any person that has seen the candlestick graphs today can see the volatility and how violent swings are up and down,,,, something isn't right that we can't control"
Dont you realize stocks prices are based on consumer demand and how high the short interest is... Nothing else matters... IF no one wants to buy it then the price is zero no matter how good its fundamentals are.
Speculative bubble + earnings reality check = today is the day the market will crash
drive it up another 20% and I'm 100% confident I will make a once in a lifetime short
Tesla has been holding back a $1.5 billion tax loss deferment that they could drop on the market any quarter including today if they decide to. Would add around $1.50 in EPS and obviously cut the P/E substantially on just that alone. Something that the “PE 1700!” people never tell you about.
Earnings priced in ?
Elon when he hears thousands of shorts had to sell their homes.
OK Tesla... Hold the position... we got resistance from the market.... hold and then $900 .... we got you covered...
What else was China to do? 1.5 billion humans. Have to thin the herd somehow. The insiders have been wearing masks for years.

I will wait until it reach 1000. I don't want to miss the boat this time. Sold it earlier for 450, 650. Brought it back at 815. Will hold this time no matter what."
just dropped all my GME wins in TSLA. wish me luck people 
ARK INVEST SELLING MORE TESLA JUST FYI FELLAS...
2 observations:1. whoever said '900 today!' was finally right!2. when it hit 900 - boy did it ever hit a stack of sell orders at market!
GM is the real TSLA! They are going to blowout earnings and bury TSLA this year! Just watch!
see ya at 400!
"the dog whistle of the shorter / Elon haters. "" It's just a car company "" well no it's not but besides that whole discussion Elons EV margin is 20% plus and the ICE car companies is like 2%. so should we say Tesla has actual much more profitable than them ?"
Investment idea...buy a Tesla model X and put it away for the 2050 Barrett Jackson auction ....what do you estimate the price of a vintage X in like new condition in 2050 to the collector market???
Europe spending billions on battery development. Tesla will benefit as they build world's largest battery factory in Germany.
"Anyone referencing 1600 PE or the per vehicle multiples has no idea how to value stocks (relative to growth rates). This company will have $100B revenue in the next few years, and could eventually earn 10% plus profit margin. That's $10B earnings, on $800B market cap today. So that would be 80 times earnings in a few yrs. Avg stock in the Dow is 20 times earnings currently and is fair valued. Tesla will still be growing 4 times as fast as the avg stock in a few yrs, so this stock is priced reasonable. Not cheap, but not anywhere close to the overvalue people on here and elsewhere are talking about. They don't understand how to value stocks."
"What your saying doesn't matter. TSLA goes up every day!! Buy all you can, on margin when the market opens Monday morning. Buy as a market order or you won't get filled. The stock price only goes up so mortgage your house if you have to. This is a value stock and is only going up...every day, so sell everything else and buy all you can right away!"
$700 by close today guaranteed. Shorts can burn today and tomorrow
I'm worth 25 million $$$ at 27 years old. pretty sure I'll stick with my current investing strategies lol
what goes up must come down... my 2 cents
"TSLA saved $90 Mil moving HQ from Cali to Texas, andRevenue from regulatory credits shot up 202% to $401 millionTSLA to $3000 next week."

This stock is less than 8% from ATH even after all the downward pressure. That only means it'll take off in a few days past ATH.
$850 by the end of Q1 2021. hold for bigger reward.
$900.00 + today and we nay clear $1000.00 if late day moment comes in. Tesla has the stars aligned and moving.
"Disaster Monday!!!! Deliveries under 500,000 Very short press release NO tweet from Elon.. What a miss. TIMBEEERRRR. 600 drop of 100 points minimum. Chineese EV's taking TSLA business"

Tesla Breaking $1000 by March  also For the true TSLA investors who believe in the companies future n wanna show off ... after getting scammed like 3x I finally found a legit site that sells quality TESLA Merch... this morning I bought a TSLA mug off all that TSLA money LETS GOOOO  more gains to come guys their link is: https://stockjunkies.ca/collections/tesla-tsla

Does bitcoin crashing affect Tesla ?
$1.5 Trillion stimulus announcement tonight.....this will have a negative impact on this stock LMAO
"Tesla used cheap screen technology. They just had a massive recall. If Elon goes cheap on screens, what else is he cheaping out on?"
Shorts checking their bank account
Do we think this tweet situation is going to affect confidence in the stock in the near future? Looking to invest more but not certain if it is gonna take a further hit today due to social media.
Opportunity of buying below 870 is going now.
"Boys and girls, buckle your belts! You're now on bord of the next generation $TSLA !"
Love the per market We will hit 1000$ soon get ready 
Ark bought more shares today now everyone can relax
going to be interesting how the election affects the stock market tomorrow...
Tesla is more than gold. It is the fastest money machine that has ever existed. Buy buy buy. The stock continues to run.
"Tesla is overvalued for sure and it’s teetering on the edge of a cliff. Anyone buying is 100% out of touch with reality. Tesla has to beat earnings every quarter to maintain this price and grow. The moment it does not meet expectations, the stock will be crushed like a soufflé; as our leader says. I’m happy for everyone who became uber wealthy, but I can’t justify buying right now. I would need to see it in the $200-300 range to get back in."
"I don’t like posting on these sites, but I feel that the report on TSLA is wrong. Sales were good. Profit was down and missed the so called numbers BUT if you dive deeper into the numbers money is being spent on plant expansion and new plants. Tsla bought land that is full of lithium for battery production, new semi truck, research for new products and new plants in Berlin , texas and China. They are doing the same thing AMZN did reinvest in more of the parts to build the company and take market share now rather than future ahead of the competition"
"If Musk gets Covid 19 , then the stock will drop 20 % in a second"
"Auto taxi service will make this company rich. It’s not about EV’s sold, it’s about EV’s miles driven, and autonomous vehicles will all be electric. Nobody has Tesla beat with their AI chip."
the real selling will be tomorrow. today was just a preview
Futures turning green cuz stimilus and Santa is here

"What a week! Cheers to all my longs. Pre split, and pre pandemic folk!"
I wonder if Apple will change the electric car charger tip every year so that one has to buy a new electric car every year
Tesla is making her ready for a drive to over the $ 1.000. Buy the dip now.

"When a billionaire makes a statement about his position regarding another billionaire’s company, it can be prudent to listen if you’d like to fatten your own wallet."
"Shawn Langlois ""The big thing about Tesla as opposed to any other stock is that the vast majority of retail shareholders (Present Teslanaires and Future Teslanaires) will never be sellers. They love the stock, they love the car, they love Elon Musk and they are adamant (not yielding to requests) long shareholders."
"The delivery numbers will cross 510,000. Note it down and confirm on 2nd/3rd January.Extremely bullish!"
"Tesla electric van is 100% real === but Tesla doesn't don't have enough batteries to build itThe New Roadster is 200% real ==== they just delayed it again The Tesla Semi truck is 1,000% real .. dleayed of courseRobotaxis are 420,000 % real ""funding secured"" === real FSD software == beyond real ...Battery swapping === super-real"
"I'm 100% bullish on TSLA but the price might have gotten ahead of itself. TSLA will dominate EVs as everyone knows. But its it will be a dominant player in the energy storage ( a trillion $ market), the solar market, the autonomous vehicle market ( taxis, delivery etc...), the long haul trucking market and more. In a few years when these other areas begin to produce revenues, TSLA will be worth today's value and on its way to to Amazon."
Cheesecake Factory! Yum! Heavily shorted.
Bitcoin up = TSLA up go figure what connects them !
SHORTS DON'T REALIZE ...how much they are contributing to this stocks meteoric rise. When I thank them from bottom of my heart. They get mad. I'm in a bind.
"Their energy growth is incredible, that's where they will make tons of money. 1500mwh :D"
"TSLA----lets try and call the 930 open for tomorrow 01/28/2021, person closest is the winner:$845 What is tomorrow's open?"
Buying Tesla is like bitcoin. No rational to the valuation of it.
Great buy at $20M valuation per car delivered.
"For everyone concerned about P/E just remember, earnings day is around the corner and that number will no longer be that outlandish. Don’t forget Amazon had a similar P/E once"
"I don't think Elon's lies about the non-existent full self driving, the non-existent Semi, the non-existent Cybertruck, the non-existent Roadster, the non-existent one million. robotaxis are going to gain him any more traction.I think he should bring up technically unfeasible rocket powered flying cars and technically/economically unfeasible 700 mph Hyperloops again!"

"Low interest rates and subsidies have driven growth stocks to the skies. The economy is much weaker than before the covid crisis, but the stock market has continued to rise. When the money supply soon decreases, optimism will decrease and the bubble will burst."
Brace yourselves for a hard drop
It's only money guys we carnt take it with us.... Play with what u can afford to lose... Tesla will easily touch 1k by the end of the monthb
Billions of $tsla funds to move back to new names like $pltr $ride etc
This cannot be compared to amazon. Amazon is used in the everyday life of pretty much everyone. The chances that you or anyone you know buys from amazon is relatively high. The same cannot be said about Tesla.
this is going to break $1000 soon
$WIMI $BABA $TSLA so everyone that has been here before...what happens when it goes sideways like this for a week or two? Bears? You remember right?! This is the load up.
Sorry - even if Tesla sells 10M cars per year this is a $100B company. Any valuation above that is simply not justified by the numbers.
I hear Gordon Johnson scape to Cayman Island with clients money after a huge loss shorting TESLA. LOL
Hold strong and long. Bigger game plan. It’ll be up again. Just chill
"Big red market today plus two days after Tesla's earnings, but analysts are bumping up price targets to $1000 left and right. Good dip buy today before our next rally!"
This is a Tesla World and everyone is paying rent.
Sold 2 more $735 calls this morning! :) time for it to follow the market
"Hi Elon, You raised ETSY the other day, you supported Reddit and GME and today it’s BIT. Do you think you can find time to give your loyal stockholders a leg up?TSLA reached a high of $900 last week before earnings now TSLA is $817. Do the math. Thx"

Bashers can not take the TRUTH...but they know they know."
"TSLA is too large compared to GME for retail investors to have similar impact. It is part of SP500, top 10 companies and short % is too low < 5%.With PE of 1600 the only direction it can go in long term is down. Apple PE is 35, that is where TSLA it is headed. It can do with profits increase (which hasn't happened) or by price dropping. IMO this is heading to $300 within a year. It is not too low, as this was $70 a year ago. I hope Tesla and Musk fans realize this. It is too overvalued, and overplayed. Good luck."
"Ok Tezombies, next Monday class is about TPS - Tesla Ponzi Scheme. We will teach you how to lose money while acting as if there is nothing wrong. Always remember our Motto: ""I See No Problem Here""."
Just chilling. Buy after huge dips. Never let short term dips affect long term gains. Been here since pre-split.
Nancy Pelosi owns tsla leaps
"There are a few things that keep coming up that I think need clarification:1) Yes, ARK funds do sell Tesla shares. It's because they have to in order to balance the funds. If Tesla rises significantly, they have to trim shares so that a certain percentage of the fund isn't exceeded by Tesla alone, and so risk is managed. Since Tesla has been on a tear, it's value in the funds skyrockets. Anyway, it's just normal maintenance for very well-managed funds, and it signals no more than that. If you have doubts, visit the ARK Invest site, and look at the number of shares held vs. shares sold.2) Yes, Tesla is astronomically overvalued...if you're judging by standard figures and philosophy. But, as we know, Tesla tends to defy such valuation. There are a few analysts who have recognized this early on and several who are finally coming around to the idea. Tesla's value comes from the potential of all of its irons in the fire, not just current car sales and revenue. Even if we ignore the attraction to Elon Musk for his various endeavors, like SpaceX, and the ""irrational exuberance"" and cultish nature of the stock, we can't ignore the potential Tesla holds in various sectors: battery tech, solar power, electric utility, car insurance, autonomous cars and robo-taxis...and, oh yeah, cars. It's a long list. Yes, there are those who kick and scream about it, and it's understandable. Nonetheless, the reality is right in front of us. Has it crashed in the past? Sure, it's been quite volatile. Can it crash again? Absolutely. Can it continue to rise? Also absolutely. But one thing is for certain: It's real, and there are good reasons behind it even if they're not the typical ones.3) If Elon Musk decides he wants to sell some shares, good for him. I would if I had such a quantity. I have no idea what he plans to do with his fortune, but if he were to sell some shares, it doesn't indicate a loss of faith or guidance. Part of Elon Musk's compensation is stock. If he wants to sell some shares, he has every right to do so and should as he's worked hard for it and deserves his pay.4) Tesla is Musk's only publicly-traded company. To get in on the others, like SpaceX, requires high-digit private investment if there's any opportunity available at all. I do recall Musk mentioning that if Starlink goes public, Tesla investors would have first crack at shares. I'm not sure about the logistics of that, but it would be nice for us. Will SpaceX go public? Probably not as Musk likely relishes the freedom to not have to answer to stockholders on that one.Just my ""two cents."" Hope it provides some clarity for those with concerns and/or questions. Good investing and best of luck to all of us."
When does Goldman raise their newly raised target of 780? It should be reached today. Maybe we reach even Morgan Stanley's target today which was issued yesterday.
"In 2005, eccentric hedge fund manager Michael Burry discovers that the United States housing market was going to collapse and made a mint shorting. Now he says Tesla will collapse. I am a little worried given how smart this guy is. I saw the movie the big short."
Just wondering what you guys think of Paul Pelosi buying call options on Tesla to me it's a pretty huge deal for the Longs just curious ???? What everyone thinks
"Too funny, this is third time they need your help!"
Recent rumors suggest that the 2021 S/X could come as early as March !
"Stranded Assets, the collapse of ICE manufacturers. something Tesla doesn't have to worry about. Research it online."

"Drone shots of the construction of the Berlin Tesla factory. They are being taken by a young man (14) who is apparently an enthusiast for the project in his area. An article pointing to this site said the local Green Party approved of the project but a local activist described his objections. Tesla's pledge to plant 3X times as many trees as they have to cut and to protect a couple of local species is mentioned also. There are shots of the factory that show the surrounding forest also. But all the trees are the same size and generation, look planted, and not that old. It looks as though it was clear cut maybe a century ago.https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChIAb-YiTMCPRxb1fS6VDiw"
Nice profits. Keep it coming

Hilarious everyone says this isn’t just a car company but they keep on trying to sell this stock based on its increase in car sales increases
ARK sold approximately half their holding in TSLA over Q4 2020
Short sellers are wonderful.Without them we won’t be where we are currently.They have without a doubt accelerated TSLA stock upwards.I give my thanks to them and hope more would short TSLA throughout their journey.
"I still think Toyota and other Japanese companies and German car companies have smart people in their ranks to produce Electric cars that would compete easily with TSLA. Autonomous driving is where TSLA is way ahead, but that's not what most customers want."
I'm really getting scared as an investor in Tesla on these levels. Got in at 635 and now i'm getting real scared.What should I do ?
Ouch shorty
"Is it legal to use this on public streets everywhere, Hard to believe stop light to stop light would't get a person ticketed for wreckless driving. Will Tesla take liability if ticket are issued to owners.This is a luxury sedan that is able to go 0 to 60 in less than 2 seconds, and will have the ability to seat up to seven people with the third row seats. So this is pretty nice. This is faster, to be clear, than any car. It's not like there was a different type of car, like a two-door sports car that was able to do that faster. This is the fastest accelerating car ever made for -- that is allowed to go on roads in history"

Some short traders are covering. Then the real selling will start.
"No logic....As of February 7, 2020, there were 181 million shares of the registrant’s Common Stock outstanding. NOW 950 million. Stock goes up 700%"
"Tesla likely hit a peak Friday, or it could keep rising for huge gains for a few more days, with even bigger daily point gains. Selling at the very peak of a climax top is essentially the great fishing story for investors. Many will claim it, few will achieve it.Investors may want to sell some Tesla stock into strength, because when a climax top occurs, shares can fall to earth even faster than they rise.After a climax run, stocks often suffer huge declines that take years to recover from. Qualcomm (QCOM) finally surpassed its 2000 climax top peak last year.Tesla stock had a climax-type run in late 2019 to early 2020, peaking on Feb. 4 at a split-adjusted 193.80. Shares then plunged 64% to 70.10 on March 18, with the coronavirus market crash no doubt contributing to the losses.Perhaps Tesla stock will have a climax top, sell off and rebound rather quickly once again. But do you want to sit through a 30%, 50%, 80% decline on hopes for a rebound? If Tesla stock corrects or crashes and then bounces back, investors can always buy it back. After the coronavirus crash, Tesla stock offered buying opportunities slightly below and above the February peak."
"Paul Pelosi bought 25 call options for shares of electric-vehicle giant Tesla with a strike price of $500 and an expiration date of March 18, 2022. He paid a total of between $500,001 and $1 million for the Tesla stock options.He bought 100 call options for Disney stock with a strike price of $100 and an expiration date of Jan. 21, 2022. He paid between $500,001 and $1 million for the Disney stock options.Paul Pelosi paid $500,001 to $1 million for 20,000 shares of global investment firm AllianceBernstein. The day that he bought AllianceBernstein stock it traded between a low of $33.14and a high of $33.66, before closing at $33.37."
Apple has a big announcement tomorrow. Might be about the car
Bitcoin is now down 12.4%. Tesla has been following Bitcoin very closely for some reason over the past few trading sessions. a major gap down is very possible tomorrow.
Elon musk said NOK NOK.Buy NokiaMia khalifa also said so
"Tesla will, within several years, have an extremely large installed base of 50 million or more. Along the way, the company could, by selling software and services to the owners of its vehicles, become profitable enough to enable Tesla stock to outperform the technology sector as a whole. Want more picks before they run. Check out (http://tradingstrategys.com)."
"Financial stocks sold off on Monday, led by Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan, after a report that several global banks moved allegedly illicit funds over the past two decades.A new investigation by BuzzFeed and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists found banks’ internal compliance officers flagged a total of more than $2 trillion in transactions between 1999 and 2017 as possible money laundering or other criminal activity.The report cited confidential documents submitted by banks to the U.S. government.These leaked suspicious activity reports do not necessarily indicate wrongdoing, and they were just a tiny fraction of the reports filed with U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the news report said."

"Upon reflection upon some of the bizarre numbers coming from TSLA Bulls and the frequent posted hope that a new stock split was coming, it occurs to me that there may be longs out there who don't understand that a 5 for 1 gives you 5 times as many pieces of TSLA but each piece is 1/5 the size. That's why, absent extreme mania or ignorance among investors, stock splits do not move the total market cap. Telsa now as about 1 billion shares outstanding (before dilution by Elon coming option bonuses).Even assuming TSLA sold 1 million cars in 2021, to earn as much as $3.50 share for the full year, it would have to have a net profit (not just operating profit) of $3500 per car sold. That just isn't possible, especially when most of the assumed sales have to be in China or India since there is no way U.S. and European sales are going to top even 500,000 in 2021. They might even be down year over year.The reason it isn't possible for TSLA to achieve such high margins is that what TSLA can do in manufacturing, can be done by everyone else. There is no room for magic here. If TSLA can successfully use Robots on the production line to achieve substantial labor cost savings, there will be other manufacturers doing so as well. If automation is cost effect, it will be duplicated by competitors. This is especially true in new markets like China and India."
$1000 per share by friday
options are acting like Earnings will NOT be on the 27th .....Or they are just at a hell of a discount right now..Any thoughts?
"Shorters will put the fear in you. Don't listen - may go down slightly, but what you don't want to do is buy back at 900+"

"Predicting questions in March: “Today’s share price is $80. Should I get in now or is it too late?” Answer: No it’s not, but wouldn’t you rather have gotten in at $58 (or lower)? We’ve seen these questions weekly since $2s. Look at the 1 year+ trend and consider where NIO may be 12 months from now! Too many positive/strategic things happening to keep SP below $100 for long. The fastest growth in 2021/2022/2023 will belong to NIO; not $TSLA. When shorts suggest the sky is falling (daily), ignore them or tell them to look at the charts as they speak for themselves. NIO is just getting started folks!"

'government credits' and such.Go google 'tesla giga-casting' and do some DD on one of many examples of how TESLA is revolutionizing car manufacturing.

Bank of America raised its price target on Tesla to $900 from $500.
Competition keeps on growing for Tesla. So does pricing pressure. I predict a half this year.
"Today, Barron’s analyst gives a price target of $340, yet TSLA skyrockets on an Morgan Stanley analyst giving it a target of $810. This same MS analyst gave a “bear case” for TSLA just last month stating the price was too high. Don’t get it. Pure momentum play at this point."
"Now I know how astronauts feel when they ride a rocket into orbit. My primary portfolio went past the $1 Million mark in August of last year. Believe it or not, that thing just broke the $1.5 Million mark today! Thanks Elon. Thanks Tesla!"
is it a right time to buy a tesla stock? I am new to investing having limited money and want to hold for a longer period of time.
"This stock will start coming down if the SEC bans short selling on this stock (Not that they are allowed to do). One single tweet from Musk where he said, he had an offer to go private to $420 when the stock was at $280 which had created a short squeeze and saved the company from bankcrupcy. I would say, Musk is an evil genius who took a calculated risk by tweeting fake news that caught shorts off guard and the squeeze is automated since then. The only way to break this automation is to, stop shorting."
Green or red tmrw?
Any dip is a gift... check the numbers not the hype they’re improving in all areas - even energy storage/solar sales increased

Srne sounds like $tsla which was dancing between 180-250$ and all of sudden 2000% in year
Great buying opportunity
I wander why Tesla didn’t use their deferred tax allowance in the Q4 earnings!? This would have dramatically improved their EPS and slashed the PE.... maybe to keep the shorts interested so they can get their a55es handed to them? Again. 
its time to put an end to all shorts and focus on stocks long term.
My simple advise don't short this stock even if its overvalued. Simple reason : Lot of people short tesla and some good news come out so they have to cover and stock goes up ...
Will go up to $700 + after hours!!!! hehehe
will price go up or down before closing today? How could it possibly go down before closing if all the indexers have to buy today? Will they buy before or after market close?
"TSLA sold 130,000 more cars this year than last year. so, does the stock deserve this price based on that? Interesting when one strip this all down what it really means."

"The bullish case for Tesla makes no sense, but neither does this current market. This economy will undoubtedly be entering into a recession due to the presidential change."
Tesla has to go up every day...that's how these ponzi schemes work....till it suddenly crashes and all the con artists make excuses......patiently waiting to short
Discounting price to sell cars since gross margin is down. With significant capacity coming online I would assume more price reductions to move this increased capacity. Gross margin likely to continue falling.
"What’s funny is even when earnings are hit, the stock still takes a quick dive "

Tesla ER will show a profit even excluding regulatory credits. Trump will dominate the national conversation even though he's not president. Media knows it. Beijing Biden is a low energy non-entity who is quickly overwhelmed especially because of dementia. Then what will shorts have left to argue?

"Step outside. Look around your neighborhood. Check out Walmart or McDonald's parking lot. Within a span of 1 hr you can count 30 Teslas. As for the competitor's cars, good luck seeing one! The Musk owns EV revolution, period."
I am not selling my TSLA for Ford or GM even though I have both products in my driveway.
buy kavl really good $stock
I take it most people shorting this stock don’t do research
But Tesla is more than a Car Company! Duhhhhh
Do you short tesla?
"Exciting news. Just spoke to the HF acquaintance again he got clearance to short personally. We spoke for a while about the auto industry as he values my 20+ years of experience. We sketched out the various scenarios and could not see a path to Tesla gaining any market share past 2024. That's going to be their peak, if not before.We also spoke about FSD, the energy biz, etc. We just can't identify significant revenue there either."
Loaded up on shares at $875 u guys think that was a good idea??
buy the dip !!!!!

"Musk, who has himself used his massive reach (he has around 42.5 million followers on Twitter) to spread misinformation to his many followers, specifically around COVID-19 and its severity, also followed that up on Thursday morning with a reply expressing a lack of surprise at WhatsApp's new Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, which will make sharing data from WhatsApp users back to Facebook mandatory for all on the platform."

"Thanks for the pop.I invested $11K in Puts this morning, out to June 2021.Way over-valued, but who knows when reality will hit.StarShip SN9 engine firing yesterday halted early. Could be nothing, but not their first engine issue.If Elon dies, what might happen to the price? Jetting around and drugging every day adds risk."
We’re back in 1999
Tesla is The Company of the Year. Very easily. No competition.
"In EU (europa) as the biggest market for EV cars then Tesla is not nr 1 company but Hyundai and VW are much bigger and own a much bigger part of the market in EU so what is the reason that Tesla has a 10 to 20 times bigger market value when they are like nothing in the world??? very good question and I think the value of the company is 20 times over valued, but if Tesla in the future are getting a bigger part of the market and can expend the company and get a bigger earnings after tax then maybe they should have a bigger value on the company but I think they have to show that they can do it first like produce 10 mil cars and get very big positive cash flow but thing that is some years before that happen.So a fare value on the share is around 40 to 80 $ as it is today"
"tsla will obliterate expected numbers, next week $1000 will be hiostory"
"Price analysts thinking 4Q could be big for Tesla, Wedbush price ups to $950 to $1250, GS maintains strong position"
"2020 ends and not a single of the promised 1M robo-taxis, nor FSD release.Think ""tab-less batteries with clay lithium"" will work out better?"
"I don’t understand why investors buy ANY stock other than TSLA. With 10% per day guaranteed returns, I need nothing else in my portfolio.Except maybe some Bitcoin."
Those who buy TSLA should periodically book profit to avoid paying tax at higher rates
The S&P500 will decide whether to add Tesla in one hit on 21st December or split it into 2 on 14th and 21st December after hours on Monday. I think it will better for the stock market to split it into 2. Any thoughts? Either way it’s going to be a great month. Good luck 
"Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) is replacing Apartment Investment and Management Co. (NYSE: AIV) in the S&P 500 Index on Dec. 21, the index announced Friday. Tesla will also be added to the S&P 100, replacing Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: OXY); the energy company will remain in the S&P 500. It is estimated Tesla's addition will likely result in about $78 billion of inflows into the stock from passive funds indexed to the S&P 500 Index, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Boris Lerner."
"tesla a $2000 by 12/31l musk will introduce mind blowing tech in battery tech, electricity distribution and ups guidance, SUV demand already doubled what was expected, tsla may disrupt the phone and wireless industry as well"
"If you believe technology, believe our bright future, then we are in TSLA!"
Netflix is just taking today’s spotlight.TSLA will be so hot when earnings are out.
"Just think, all of the deliveries the company will announce on Monday will not be potential customers for Q1 2021. Musk has already picked the low level fruit. He has a limited number of potential customers that want to buy a Tesla. After they've bought, your likely customer base has dried up a bit. Where will he find new customers? There's a lot of competition coming, and TSLA with a PE of 1417 needs to sell a lot more cars to justify that PE. Plus, they need a lot of margin, and I understand to prop up current quarter sales, Musk is droppiing prices, thus less margin. Last thing I knew my milennial aged kids weren't flocking to TSLA to buy a car. They were buying SUV's and minivans from Jeep and Chrysler. I think it's 40 to 50 year old men buying TSLA's, but soon they will be contemplating buying the Ford Mustang. I don't see TSLA numbers growing. I see TSLA being a fad, a phenomenon., (and yes, the stock price a Ponzi scheme)."
"Oh no TESLA is going up....bahaahhahahahjahjaU sell, I buyTesla to the mooooooooooooonnnnnnn."
TSLA is currently valued more than 800 billions and earning 1.2 billion in profits last year. Even though this is a premium growth company the current valuation is very problematic. This is almost as if i am currently investing $800 earning $1.20 (last year) but hoping to see an exponential growth in the next 10 years to justify leaving my money there. it can happen but it is a very long shot because all car manufacturers are gearing up and i am confident that many of them will be offering great incentives and warranties to take market share. EV technology that the average consumer will be demanding is no longer a challenge and plenty of reputable car manufacturers are already in the game.
Tesla will probably never make a profit. It excess resources will almost always be reinvested back into the company’s growth. They (and other brands) have a long way to go to completely supplant the 1 billion ICE/oil vehicles polluting the planet. Elon Musk is not in all this for generating excessive “profits”. Loyal investors know this and will take their rewards when they eventually sell their higher value TSLA shares.
"With people ignoring Demand supply ( Elon launching Standard range after saying it not worth as range is just <250 mile) is clearly problem on Demand side Tesla seeing.Market can celebrate but more they ignore bad news and valuation worst outcome at end. May be I won't benefit and lose $100K at end but I am not worried about that. I may not good at making money but I know how to recover once go in loss. It take month or two but will recover it. Lot of people will not able to. Once recover I get more greedy and get stuck eventually. Eventually I will learn how to control my greed. If I started with $2k risk and double down as it go up I would much better shape. Not saying I won't recover. This stock going 50 up daily. If it just go down 75 in 1 week, I will in profit."
"Let's assume that TSLA gets to 50% marketshare tomorrow and then holds it indefinitely. This is not a reasonable assumption, but humor me. Further, let's assume a 5% net margin (vs 1.89% most recently). Now, the worldwide market for new vehicles (number of vehicles x average selling price) is around $2.8T. So, TSLA would get $1.4T and would earn $70B (@5% net margin). Now since we've assumed growth stops at 50% marketshare, a reasonable PE would be 12 (No more growth, just dividends). So, 12 x $70B is $840B, which is basically what the market cap is today. Good job.Now TSLA has other businesses and they could get more than 50% marketshare. And the market for new vehicles in 2030 is expected to be $3.4T, not $2.8T and they can make money from subscriptions etc. But seriously? Tesla vehicles are great, but Tesla's stock no longer is. JMHO."

"You won’t have improved EV, Wind Turbine, and Solar Technology without a “Manhattan Project” like project to find Rare Earth Elements. There’s one in Alaska and Colorado. There’s a huge project in Wyoming (Bear Butte) that has potentially 45 years of REE mining. Some of the elements are worth a $160,000 per Killogram. A bunch of Lithium deposits also. A lot of the REE stocks are starting to move off of a decade long bottom. Might be worth a little look."

"If the earnings exceeds estimates this Wednesday, the stock will pop over $1000, that is a given. Don't say I did not warn you."
"By including TSLA into S&P 500 and various index funds, Banks and institutions wants to transfer the volatility of TSLA price to other companies that are part of those index funds. Hence, TSLA'S daily volume traded will rise reducing daily price fluctuations, which will cause TSLA price to go down due to lower volatility and eventually it will find it's right price level. Hence, I feel price will go down in near future. It may drop to $400 by mid January if TSLA's price starts to fall on Monday. If it goes up on Monday then my understanding of market behavior is wrong."

And innovation of taxi network through Tesla app. Going to 1000 rathe soon stay long buy the dip
Dont worry Nasdaq is red and tesla is green
"For all those bulls attacking me in replies, remember, i never said anything negative about you, just speaking my mind out. In the long run, i might be wrong to short it, why do you care? I lose money for my mistake.It takes only one click to mute you, and you can do the same to me, just dont be negative on my action of shorting this stock. I will face the consequences of it anyways if I am wrong."
"The stock price now is only valid for the stocks sold now, it does not represent the value of Tesla. No one would pay that much for the whole company. So next week the stock price could be 1000 or 100 depending on if mania continues or not. I dont own or short Tesla but if I did own I would sell all and go short now. Only a few will become very rich on this bubble and they are folliwing my advice. 90% of the so called longs will be looking at a blood red trading account forever. The peak price will never come back. Good luck!"

Here's more information for comparison: AGRIFY IPOs Tommorrow at $8-$10 for 10 million in revenues.....$PHOT is trading for $0.17 for about 1.3 Million in Revenues ($1 - $1.25 proportionally speaking) and has been operating in this space for the last 10 years! If you do the math PHOT Should easily be a $1 which is about 6x it's price. Not a bad return right?? AGRIFY will be on Nasdaq (R-hood) but PHOT is on Schwab/E-Trade/Ameritrade. GL2A! #investing #FOMO #Undervalued #MARKETS #MONEY #NIO #TSLA #cannabinoids
"I see no reason why it won't be $2000 tomorrow. Since they miss both revenue [excluding inflated regulatory amount] and profit [again they lost a fortune if you count stock based compensation]. The more they miss now, the higher the FUTURE possibility!!Every other car company in the world will vanish by 2030. And Tesla will have 100% market share in the milkyway galaxy. Not only that, it's a computer on wheels - so it will eventually make every other tech company go bankrupt. The only company in our galaxy will be Tesla. So nothing matters today."
"chip makers are back logged about half year. I just met with some business friends from over seas on skype call. they told me currently there is a waiting list. Customers needing chips have to wait about 6 months to get their order. Also, because of the trade war caused by the former administration, American chip makers and others around the world are not allowed to sell to Huawei and other Chinese customers. So the CCP has set up a plan for locals to build their own semiconductor factories. CCP basically offering like grants to push this initiative and get their own country to develop their in house semiconductor industry so they don't have to rely on foreigners."
Earnings will take this over $1000
I will not buy Even if it goes to 400 $ . To Much Competition . No profitability in the future for Tesla.
Way undervalued. People don't get what addressable market is and that tesla isn't a car company. Tesla isn't bound by the auto industry. Its bound by the entire planets economy. 200T this year. 1% of that is easily captured by tesla and hence its easily worth 2000 per share right now. The price is totally wrong...the analysts are keeping the price down
Price Target of Tesla moved from $600.00 to $2000.00 because all the Government money coming to us. Is going to Buy a share of Tesla Stock. #$%$
"Too funny! Elon Musk advised using Signal messenger (not traded), and the stock of an unrelated company by that name rose 1,100%! Great luck for them!"
I feel uncomfortable tesla is going DOWN
Tesla is buy because it's only $1T+ valuation company that won't impacted by Biden Tax.Reason:- Simple It does not make real profit.
Remember the earnings conference call where Musk announced selling his FSD(full self driving) package to other OEMs which he announced already in 2016...and in 2021 it's called beta where the driver is responsible for everything. That isn't level 5 autonomy but level 3 and that's what Mercedes already has and it's much more robust. Not driving under lorries because they actually use radar and lidar.
"If Elon is tempted to buy another automaker out, he should do it soon, while stock is sky high."
I am tesla fun and I hold shares for long time. I am not selling but I bought EXPR STOCK TODAY is start today like GME and is still very cheap.

"How corporate welfare supports Elon's $40 Billion bonus. First the gov't give Tesla a grant to build the plant, then they pay purchasers of a Tesla money to buy their car, and finally Tesla sells carbon credits even though the electricity used may be made by coal. A final insult to the taxpayers is a reduction in tax offered to Tesla."
NEW 1250 PRICE TARGET INCREASE FROM WEBBUSH WITH MODEL Y NOW IN CHINA 20 BILLION ON BALANCE SHEET AND CYBER TRUCK AND FULL SELF DRIVE COMING THUS YEAR THAT SOUNDS LOW HONESTLY. BUT ILL TAKE IT. STAY LONG GOING TO 1000 ON Q4 EARNINGS CALL
Model S sales down Model X sales down Model 3 sales (outside China) down Model Y is new. So they lumped all China sales with the Model Y to hide the declines. Tesla is not Enron but they are far from transparent.

"Keep holding  :That's according to Argus Research analyst Bill Selesky. On Friday, Selesky raised his price target on Tesla's stock from $777 to $1,010. His new target represents potential gains for investors of roughly 21% over the closing price on Thursday of about $835."
"Once the sellers dry up, which I think are banks and hedge funds that accumulated shares in the recent dips, then the price will jump. Retail buyers do not have the power to manipulate a stock like this. My opinion only, but once 70-80 million shares are sold and once the price crosses ~$650/share, they will be hard pressed to keep a lid on the price."
Tesla's share of EV sales === Germany = 4% in 2020 = DOWN from 8% in 2019 France = 3% = DOWN from 10% Norway = 5% = DOWN from 20% Netherlands = 9% = DOWN from 45% Sweden = 4% = DOWN from 10%This is market share. It has nothing to do with a pandemic. Tesla is getting pushed aside by the big boys.
"I have a question on exercising options. I have TSLA March calls with strike price of 640, and currently the gain is $1,000. If I sell the contract, I get $1,000. But if I exercise at $640, get 100 shares at $64,000, and sell immediately at $660, i should be getting $2,000 ($66,000-64,000). Does this mean its better to exercise the contract then to sell?"
"There is no news left, that could pump it. Stimulus done, S&P500 inclusion done, vaccines approved done. Only left Brexit and new mutation of virus."

Knowing the existing brutal competition and also entry of apple, story for Tesla is not good. Lot need to spun repeatedly."
Any opinions about Tesla buying Ford ? There are a lot of rumors. It would make sense
I’ve worked hard all of my life I put 40 years into my 401k I never thought I would be a multimillionaire but TESLA changed all that for me THANK YOU ELON
Does anyone think the news that came out today about the recall will push the stock price down significantly? I am a long holder of appl and nflx but new to TSLA and bought at split knowing tge stovk was once at $2000 per share. Honest opinions please. No bashing

"Heavily margined Tesla gamblers (especially the fractional share buyers on platforms like Robinhood) are about to learn a very old and very hard lesson. It's amazing how every stock bubble always brings out these true believers who think they've stumbled upon the one true path to riches. As the stock goes higher and higher, they're justifications for the valuation get more and more absurd (Robotaxis!! Self-driving!! Hyperloops!! Fed will never let stocks go down!! ""It's not a car company...it's a tech company!!"" etc. etc. etc.)What's sad is that most of them will end up losing every penny and then some because they used margin, and they have been conditioned to ""buy the dip""...so they will chase Tesla down to the single digits."

It sold at $805 and I bought it back the next day at $830. Cost us about $13,000. Here we go again. Don't want to panic over what may be an insignificant drop BUT, one of these times, it may not recover......."

Longs that have had skin in the game for a while give a thumbs up if you added today!!!!!!!
Another 19 days like this and will be getting somewhere. Like to fair value.
Sold quarter holding at 800...this is a massive bubble
"We now have a Meme driven stock market. PE and earnings are for grandpa, now it's all about who's CEO is the coolest on Twitter."
"Microsoft , Apple, Amazon , Alphabet normal daily volume Tesla minus -50% of Normal Daily Volume . Why ??? No Buyers ??"
I wish I had more money to buy more im stuck at 20 shares
no good news as new form of covid that spreads super fast will cause April's stock market crash to repeat
Soooo is it 695$ (Yahoo Finance) or 667$ (Robinhood) Lmaooo this is a joke
The most astonishing thing is that some people somehow managed to lose money on this stock. Especially in 2020 when the path of Tesla has become very clear.
"""A crowd doesn't reason, it only thinks it reasons."""
"At what point does Elon announce a new, largest ever, share offering? I'm thinking Elon wants to convert bubble money (e.g. the stock price) into real money. I'm thinking he wants to raise at least $100 billion in cash. It is very, very accretive to the company, if he does so. The only issue is that he doesn't want to crash the stock. He has to nurture the bubble. I'm guessing he will make some kind of an announcement regarding new secondary offerings at the earnings report."
Where are the options experts here that were talking about the stock closing above 860$ today?
I hope longs realized their gains only are so when they sell. And that there won’t be enough buyers for everyone!
gonna touch 900 again and resist.
"FYI, TSLA is a alternative energy company that also makes cars."
Tesla need to be at 888 points . Later we hope to se 8888
I find it amazing that GM produced almost 3 million cars last year. Going EV with that type of productivity tells me that GM stock can reach at least half of where Tesla is today. If you are into the EV strategy get you some BLNK too. Gotta have charging stations for this planned growth.
I WOULD BUY BEFORE EARNINGS CALL THIS WILL HAVE STRONG GUIDANCE
Earnings miss? So what. The longs don't care about reality.
Omg it’s going to $900 today
"Holding up extremely well, considering... S&P entry is paying off, institutions holding, acting as a buffer."
"Wake me up when $TSLA reaches $1,000 "
Never thought I’d see the day when I despise the weekend
"Tesla, just like Apple and Microsoft, is America's icon. you bet the govt will help make it flourish even more and more and more and more......until you shorts dont know what hits you on the head."
Don't let the shorts get in your head with the overvalued card. Look at CMG for heaven's sake.
"hey guys I purchased tesla 4 years ago during the ""inevitable crash"" why didn't it crash? oh you still claim it will crash? maybe I should double down on my 2 million $ investment"
"Everyone needs to understand --- like, really really understand --- that Tesla is most importantly a battery company, AND a robotaxi company, a software company, an energy company, a financial company, an insurance company and... you guessed it... even an automotive company. I didn't have the complete picutre either until pretty recently, but it is unfathomable how many industries it's going to disrupt and revolutionize. I'm holding at least the majority of my shares until 2030."
Survey here. Thumbs up if you trade on fundamentals. Thumbs down if you trade on emotion.
"Stock market is filled with gamblers on winning streak. Yes $TSLA can go over $1000 in days but long term this is heading below $300, in around a year. Crazy valuation for a top 10 market cap company. $hitty stocks like $GME, $NIO are doing well. Remember to put aside 40% taxes on short term gains"
"well, ACRX up 100% in 5 days, on 99 million shares, with only 90 million shares outstanding, someone is BUYING ACRX. $gm new 52 week high on their EV opportunity! $nio only up 1,500% in 1 year!! $plug another monster move in 12 months!"
markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay liquid....that is the quote on my mind today....
the whole world is embracing green energy movements. more EV and more new highs for TSLA and other EV makers. so invest in several EV makers of you can......go TSLA!
Don’t be a bag holder Once the hedge funds start liquidating Tesla could fall 90%
Which way is better in Georgia for Tesla? And why?
Tesla (NASDAQ: $TSLA) CEO Elon Musk Becomes The Richest Man In The World + Bitcoin Just Under $40k!#YouTube Link >> https://youtu.be/6-59D1UClX0
62 MILLION cars sold worldwide in 2020 and Tesla sold a measly 500k. Where’s the market dominance and growth? All these ICE cars need to be phased out before mass adoption of electric. Everyone isn’t just going to ditch their newly purchased ICE car. Electric is no doubt the future but It’s going to be an incredibly slow shift to get there. I don’t have a horse in this race but there is no value here only speculation.
0alantir faeegits plague the tesla board smh. palantor (PLTR) is about to declare bankruptcy
"Those who think AAPL having an EV means the end of TSLA need to think twice. AAPL doesn’t have the factories TSLA has, etc. They are miles behind. Even if AAPL were to compete effectively with TSLA, March shorties still will never see their money again. These price levels and beyond are here to stay. The fact TSLA isn’t selling off even 2 percent counting yesterday and being in the green today tells me the big boys aren’t concerned. I bought the dip from last week and you should’ve too. 695 and beyond will be back soon."
Where are all the longs asking for another stock split...you know a stock price is out of control when another stock split is counted on to drive further price appreciation instead of any fundamentals.....
There's a high chance we'll close red today but this stock is autonomous (see what I did there?) so I won't be surprised to see green.
"The Alaska Department of Revenue, which managed $8.8 billion worth of US-traded assets as of December 31, opted to increase its TSLA holdings as it reduced its investments in companies like Intel, Gilead Sciences, and Qualcomm."
"So odd that once TSLA is included into the grand S&P 500, some news of Apple entering the EV market is dug up and put back into the news. FUD in a new disguise. Avoid the noise. The price will escalate."
"Amazon had a P/E of over 3000 in 2016. do your research! I've always been taught invest in companies that will change the world, new products. growth companies have high P/E's of course that's basics because they are growing! I was 20 years old in 2001 when I told my friend's and family to invest in Apple at quid a share and they all laughed!! well you know how that turned out lol. Tesla will change the world, new products, new technology, and be a household name. mark my words. we are talking about at 200000% upside over 15 years. also Vuzix smart glasses, good by phones"
TSLA has no momentum anymore. GME is the new TSLA
"so ill share my woes, being new to the whole investing thing. I like sooooo many others jumped on the tesla train. Hear all the good stuff about how its gonna hit 1k and all that. Ive learned an expensive lesson. Without the DD in this area, your as good as dead money in poker.. may not be alot of money for the people here,but i lost 2000 on tesla. Going to do more DD n the future and stay away from options, im going to do my DD and load up on shares to hold long term"
"So, Musk has some court dates coming up. I wonder how those are going to pan out."
TSLA is still way ahead of its competitors. The investing in this company has never been about earnings. I have faith in Musk and his vision (and so does Cathie Wood). Never selling.
hold on.....at the top of the coaster now!!!!!
Tomorrow we ride toward $900 make ready 
The party has moved over to NIO's house.
"Looking at Tesla's Financial Summary. YoY for the quarter, they grew automotive revenues at 42.5% once you back out regulatory credits but operating expenses grew at 44%"
Holding UP really well vs other EVs despite all the adversaries       BUY more and HOLD until $50$TSLA $NIO $XPEV
profit taking phase has begun. panic phase to follow!
the Fed has figured out how to stop corrections. stocks always bounce back.
"I bought in when the 5-1 split was announced, the stock price was $1,500 per share. Divide that 5 and I got in at $300 per share. Definitely a solid investment. I did the same last week with Amazon, still waiting on that split announcement."
"The bubble is breaking, will the last one to SELL their $TSLA share - please turn off the lights."
Tesla has more data collection for streets and highways than any other company!!!! Level 5 FSD is the best in Tesla than any other company!!!
tesla shares
"Resources Investment funds and groups entering the U market!First. Remember, the total uranium sector market cap today is only +-17 billion USD. That's a very tiny sector!!To put this into in perspectif.The entire market cap of uranium sector (17 billion$) =- 2% of the market cap of Tesla $TSLA (810 billion$)- 40% of the market cap of Barrick Gold $GOLD (42 billion$)- 34% of the market cap of Newmont $NEM (50 billion$)- 8% of the market cap of Exxon Mobil $XOM (205 billion$)- 9,5% of the market cap of Chevron $CVX (180 billion$)- 14,5% of the market cap of Boeing $BA (117 billion$)In 2007 the total uranium sector market cap was 150 billion USD in USD of 2007.Add to this the inflation between 2007 and today, and you have a easy multi-bagger sector here!Second. It's a mathematic fact that the global uranium supply and demand needs a sustainable 60+$/lb U3O8 to get back in equilibrium in the long term.At 30$/lb U3O8 only 40% of global annual U3O8 demand can be met by uranium miners!!==> This is not an IF question, this is a WHEN question!Third. There are multi signals that the uranium sector fundamentals are getting the attention from professional resources investors now.Some signals:""Soon we'll be sending private letters to many natural resource investment funds and groups, globally. Our letters, to new groups who might not be aware of the uranium supply debacle, will outline the broken status of the uranium business and the key points for them to perform their own work to see if we reach similair or differing conclusions. We'll offer each group networking opportunities and ways that we believe they can most effectively participate in recapitalizing a broken mining sector and supply chain"" Andrew Weekly, CEO SmithWeekly ResearchLarry McDonald on uranium:""I am also looking for financial players to get more serious about throwing weight around in this sector. A group with decent capital at a multi-strat HF or a medium sized fund could allocate a few hunderd mill and create their own reality in this sector, IMO. The order of operations would be to buy up positions in call option like U miners, then buy the U trusts trading at discounts and then hit the spot market hard. I think you would make money on all legs of that if you committed a few hunderd mill to it""==> An other investor spending a lot of time in macro and micro due dilligence work on this sector like me, ""intercepted"" a strategic chats a few weeks ago between professional traders of different financial institutions talking about preparing themself to come in action in the uranium sector. And like Larry McDonald saying to first buy the uranium company stocks and related financial instruments, second buying the U trusts (Uranium Participation, Yellow Cake) and then buying Uranium in the spotmarket (Professional investors with 3000000 million USD (100000lb x 30$/lb) on hand can buy physical uranium --> the minimum buying is 100000lb U3O8!)In the meantime the uranium etf's need to buy more underlying uranium company stocks and issue additional etf shares to keep up with the demand from investors ==> That's a big upward pressure on all those underlying uranium companies in which those etf's invest today and in the coming months (and couple of years).For instance:- ""Investors were piling into 100% Pure-Play ""North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF"" $URNM on NYSE yesterday, adding another 175,000 ETF shares - Now at 1,325,000 & AUM US$60.3M, over 20X higher than its US$3M inception just over a year ago""- ""Global X Uranium/Nuclear ETF $URA on NYSE added another 300,000 shares yesterday to bring their issued to 17.1M with US$276M in Net Assets - A 160% increase from its March low""Conclusion: A lot of money is coming into a very tiny sector to invest into. Multi-bagger moves higer coming.Be prepared and be patient.Don't try to swing trade uranium stocks. If you do, you will miss the biggest part of the bull trend$DNN $NXE $UEC Fission Uranium Corp, Forsys Metals, UEX Corp, ...Energy Fuels, UR-energy, Cameco, Paladin Energy,...Cheers"
Morgan Stanley says 810. Why isn't it 810? HELLO
When are earnings announced?
When I see the PE at 1560 I cannot stop laughing when I think about who it got it there. Both the longs and the shorts are out to lunch. Obviously Tesla investors do not like to be bothered with math. Way too boring.
Elon musk said tilray will be best marijuana stock on the market And the Reddit army are getting ready to move after the victory at amc keep the momentum going join us
Elon car has its own gaming console... literally a game console!!!!
"I have no stake in this stock, wish I did. But, where does it realistically go from here? It is essentially valued such that over the next few years it needs to generate as much revenue and net profit as the next 4 or 5 largest car makers combined. That is just not happening. Yes, it is a growth story this year, but the long-term growth has been rather uneven and there is a lot of new competition coming into view. Plus autos are a low margin business. This is not a pure tech company as so many apparently believe. Something like 90% of their revenue comes from low margin manufacturing. Not too sexy. What would the dudes on shark tank think if Musk pitched this business at 35 times revenue and 1300 times earnings? Insane stuffNot sour grapes, just been around a while and know this cannot hold this valuation long-term, something is going to give at a certain point..."

Tesla up 23.66 % after the 5 days of the new year. I like a stock that pays me money to do nothing.
Is Dr. Michael Burry loosing his mind right now?
Tesla is much better than bitcoin
HMM seems fishy Tsla dropping like this now that Bidens green deal is coming all those politicians buying now at a lower cost. Next month this is going to rocket up make no mistake im all for the rocket ship. I just hate how they can manipulate stocks to favor them. 100 dollar drop because they did not hit someone elses projection which they have destroyed each time so they put a higher number than they ever have projected. If they did a normal projection Tsla would have beat it but they went out of normal pattern because TSLA kept beating it.
TSLA will reach a new 52-Week HIGH!!!! Today!!!! hehehe
7......... chose the numbers after the 7 at closing ?
Set your limits orders at $1000. The stock price is going to go parabolic at the close. Make these institutions pay the premium!
Too many people here looking for short term profits. Go play some slots online or buy GME.
Should Tesla acquire GM or at least GM’s EV business?
"Despite the hype around the Model S, Tesla shares fell 3% in Thursday’s session after the company’s fourth quarter earnings missed analyst forecasts. Tesla also failed to provide 2021 delivery guidance,"
When do you sell a stock that only goes up?
Its finally nice to come on a conversation where the shorts are far and very few AHHHHHHH. Tesla strong all the way
Tsla isn't a car company. Its an innovation company. The tam is literally infinite but if you want to be conservative it's around 600T. I believe tsla can take at least 5% of that in 3 years. Thats 30T company. Pt is about 15000
Is it true Elon sold 47.2 billion worth of his shares?
"So much negativity around this stock, reminds me of another company where the same negativity applied. Where there is controversy and volatility there lyes a great company. Amazon, befor they knew it stock reached 1k, then 2k, then 3k and soon 4k."
Since Tesla is being added to the S&P today does that mean that there is a chance the stock could go positive? I know a lot of people are gonna buy it when it’s down but what do you think is going to happen with the stock today?
TEZOMBIES BY NEXT WEEK
Lol impulsion eminent
The Standard & Poor people must be glad they added Tesla into their index just in the nick of time. Tesla shares are single handedly pulling up the S & P 500 for the last 2 days!
"Regulators want to halt the stock for 30 days because they think investors will get hurt... as if they really care. If so, why did they let $tsla run from $164 to $4000 in two years? How about $AMZN from $500 to $3400 in three years? Oh, and $ZM from $60 to $588 in 6 months. So, it's okay for any other stock to run but NOT ok when one of their hedge funds gets destroyed from greed."
BWAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHA! all the naysayers........BOOM CHACA LACA ........TO THE BANK $$$$$$$$. no idea why people spend countless hours here arguing about this. Go make money and invest
Will TSLA be up or down YTD as of Feb 15th? Please vote with thumbs up or thumbs down. Tracking results and so far The Crowd has been wise across companies.....FOLLOW ME TO SEE RESULTS.....appreciate everyone’s help!

"first i like to congratulate the long, you made your money. However when you look at these numbers you can't help but wonder what's going on here Market Cap PE Revenue1) GM 69.74 B 21.85 137 B2) FORD 38.9 B X 155 B3) Fiat/Chrysler 36 B 7.68 131.76 B4) TESLA 809 B 1633 24 BTesla is 5 times the value of GM, FORD and Chrysler combined. While the revenue of GM, FORD and Chrysler is 17.6 times that of Tesla. All the wall street and market experts on this board, please tell me what I'm missing here.I suspect TESLA will crash big time without any notice. This stock is being control, manipulated by Market Makers. Good luck everyone"
"I hope Starship SN9 launches today and makes a successful landing. If that happens, $TSLA will go through the roof tomorrow."
S&P down 0.5% Tesla up 5% ... go figure ...but Dow turns more red and Russel isn't green anymore...let's hope for some flash crash
IT WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME FOR APPLE TO COMPETE WITH TESLA. HONESTLY NOT A GOOD LOOK FOR A PREMIUM BRAND LIKE APPLE TO DO A DEAL WITH A DEFINITELY NOT PREMIUM CAR BRAND. AND THATS PUTTING IT NICELY. TESLA DOUBLING SALES THIS YEAR AND EXPANDING RAPIDLY. APPLE IS MAKING A MISTAKE HONESTLY.
Reddit users says he wants tesla at 4000/shr.
Nobody thinks Tesla is kind of overvalued? Look at the other electric car manufacturers such as NIO... In my opinion short run is okay but long run...I suggest everyone think about it carefully.

"whos in the mood for a 350 point retrace? Tesla Motors: Implied decline of 41%Electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) might just be the market's most polarizing stock. Following a greater than 700% run higher over the trailing year, Wall Street is looking for a retracement of 41% to its one-year consensus price target.Obviously, Tesla has done something right, or it wouldn't be up more than 700% in 12 months. In 2020, the company was short only 450 EV deliveries of CEO Elon Musk's promised goal of 500,000. Still, it's an incredible accomplishment for an auto stock built from the ground up.Tesla also continues to hold tangible competitive advantages in the technology department over other auto stocks. During its September Battery Day event, the company unveiled its next-generation battery, which will improve range by 16%, increase power by a factor of six, and offer five times the capacity. Slowly but surely, the possibility of a $25,000 EV is taking shape. However, the big knock against Tesla is that it's still not profitable from selling EVs. It's reported a profit in each of the past five quarters, but in four of those five quarters, it was aided by the sale of renewable energy credits. Investors shouldn't have to worry about a nearly $800 billion company still being unable to generate a profit from its product or service."

Elon actually thinking about getting into the real car business?
"December 2, 2020 Musk says, ""Our stock will immediately get crushed ... if we don’t control costs."" From the same email Elon adds, "" This is a tough Game of Pennies, requiring thousands of good ideas to improve part cost, a factory process, or simplify the design while increasing quality and capabilities. A great idea would be one that saves $5, but the vast majority are $0.50 here or $0.20 there."" Hint: Tesla cut prices on October 1st. On October 15th they cut the price of the Model S again by $3,000. Conclusion: Cutting prices by thousands of dollars per units is easy. Cutting costs by even $5 per unit is very difficult. On top of that - volume is down at Fremont causing costs to increase."

The market has TSLA priced as if it's the only company that will ever make a good EV. That seems highly unlikely but that's apparently the story we're being told.
Sad that traders are missing the next big story coming out this year on Tesla. It is energy. Their Powerwall will be huge. Also look for Musk to do an IPO with Starlink. Cathie Woods new ARKX is coming out soon.

"I love tesla but its valued pretty high for an 8000 pe ratioNio makes luxury type evs = cap 87.7 billionNkla wants to make ev semis and and has a shiney office = cap 7.6 billionKNDI has multiple models, the most affordable cars, for sale NOW IN THE USA, and 100% evs in the western hemisphere A CAR EVERYONE CAN AFFORD AND BUY = cap 572 million. Does ANYONE LOOK for value anymore or just follow the advertising?Tesla may still but the value goes down as it does. Its likely to still go up because the stock market is a popularity contest.. And we are in it.Im in KNDI and WKHS mostly..wkhs got loads of contracts..and its endurance pick up coming out in spring. KNDI..OHH BOY..has many models, has the perfect speed limit, has a range that most people wont even use to commute daily , made for dense cities therefore developing nations, HAS MODELS for sale in the usa right now, building micro dealerships, just got a credit line for 76 million from a very large conservative bank...and now has the most affordable EV in the western hemisphere.Anyone can afford a kandi model...think about it.Market cap 572 millionGlta"
"In 2012 Amazon’s PE ratio was 3633 and the price was $254, it’s 12x higher now and still booming. Imagine the possibilities if they innovated as much as Tesla. Don’t buy for the stock price, buy for the potential growth of this company."

Tesla has acquired substantial market share within the electric car segment. Strong performance and impressive design of the firm's products are ramping up sales volumes. I always seemed to miss my buy and sell points. Until I found this platform that seems to help out. https://daytradingsquad.team/TTGInstantAccess
"BTW, not sure how Tesla pricing its models under its competitors in China is a good thing..doesn’t that hurt its margins?"
"Model S - $10k bump in new car purchase price?Seriously disappointed - this, a more than 10% increase, on a car that already has a large profit margin. Guess I’ll wait for VOLVO and Mercedes to catch up. Yeesh."

"Tesla fleet size grows, insurance companies are starting to see more meaningful data on which they can base their underwriting decisions.The early signs are not good for Tesla. Periodically, there have been complaints of customers unable to get reasonably priced insurance. The problem was particularly acute in Asia where Tesla ended up offering its own insurance.Tesla's insurance problems may have taken a very sharp downward turn recently. As of 02/18/2017, Hartford Auto Insurance not allowing Any Model Tesla be written as new business or added to an existing policy in the states of CT, FL, KY, MD, ME, OH, TX, and WV.Is it a big deal with just a single insurance company not insuring especially in relatively small markets? After all, California is the biggest market and there seem to be no problems there yet?The answer is that insurance companies tend to work from similar sets of data and if one insurer takes a specific action, the odds are extremely high that several others will follow.Hartford is a leading indicator in this regard as the company tends to attract the higher value auto buyers. It is very likely that many others will follow Hartford, and possibly very soon."

"From Wall Street Journal today:ZWICKAU, Germany—Five years and nearly $50 billion into the auto industry’s biggest bet on electric vehicles, Volkswagen VOW -0.78% CEO Herbert Diess and his guest, Chancellor Angela Merkel, stood in anticipation as the first ID.3, Germany’s long-awaited answer to Tesla, rolled off the assembly line.The event at the company’s flagship EV plant just over a year ago marked a “systemic shift from the combustion engine to the electric vehicle,” said Thomas Ulbrich, leader of the ID.3 effort.The car, however, didn’t work as advertised.It could drive, turn corners and stop on a dime. But the fancy technology features VW had promised were either absent or broken. The company’s programmers hadn’t yet figured out how to update the car’s software remotely. Its futuristic head-up display that was supposed to flash speed, directions and other data onto the windshield didn’t function. Early owners began reporting hundreds of other software bugs."
Tomorrow 900. But when it will drop thats a question coz nothing goes straight up forever.

"When owning a Tesla EV (oh yeah, this company actually makes an expensive EV as well as a high priced stock), the EV owner is totally at the mercy of Tesla for everything as Tesla can take away remote charging and no one else can fix/repair the Tesla but Tesla.And good luck on the resale value once the warranty expires as any repair will be through the roof in the multi-$1,000s. I would not be surprised to see 100,000s Teslas suffer fender benders each year in order to get totaled for big insurance payouts rather than suffer the huge loss trying to resell the car to another person."

Buying as long term investment here is crazy. Good luck to you but I advise you to look at the CSCO or INTC chart in the tech bubble. Looks familiar to me. It’ll never grow into the valuation and I challenge anyone find a valuation metric that makes Tesla an attractive investment. Musk even might pull bitcoin on the balance sheet to make it an even more hyper speculative bubble vehicle.
"Elon Musk is now the richest man in the world, without any of his companies making any money.Therein lies his genius.I have no position in Tesla. Just amused at the level of irrational exuberance."

It’s hard to say but I’ll tell you I’m a lot more excited about the RS1 for a luxury electric family hauler than I am about any Tesla. Any thoughts?"
tesla could hit $900 before the close. Or it could gap up tomorrow and then everyone would miss out.Don't be that guy.
"a short commented earlier today, tesla has no ads on TV.........but he keeps seeing other EV companies on TV.This is what logic longs are dealing with"
"The presentation of the CEO and CFO had another VERY Interesting pointS (and I mean with big S)1. The CEO states that currently there is a barrier of entry in building new cap seize ships, because in a few years the propulsion of these vessels will change (probably hydrogen -- my take). Which is very good for ship currently, less short term competition2. The company that installed the scrubber technology will get paid per agreement on the fuel savings that the vessels make. (put another way, no fuel savings = no payment) and the scrubbers will be owned by ship in a few years. So as an investor the capital of the company $ship has been increased.As such I am expecting 3x on $ship near term. $ship is no $TSLA, $FCEL, $PLUG, but short term it most likely will outperform these stocks. Do the research yourself.Obviously a dividend is on the radar as also discussed in that presentation. Here is the link again to the full presentation.Question: which company installed the scrubbers?? That company would have a significant interest in ship doing well, just to get paid, and they are probably also purchasing these cheap shares on a grand scalehttps://noble.mediasite.com/Mediasite/Play/3ce0bdc360c04c5d81ef1e222443c9c21d"

After I left Starbucks I’m heading towards the avenue and a gorgeous white model Y passes me and it had a paper plate. And as I’m getting home close to turning the block I see another model 3 (this time black) and guess what it had!? A paper license plate. These are all recent deliveries! Imagine those going around with regular license plates that are also recently delivered. Honestly I’m taking this as a good sign... just thought I should share.

Past the point of no return, the final death hold, what lessons in investing will you now have to learn? Beyond this point of no return."

Instead of gaining 1% on this stock why not go invest on a different ev that will give you 20%-60% gain tomorrow?

It could also make the Model 3 there to have a larger local production, but only the original car Tesla promised for the European market may make Giga Berlin reach the production volumes it aims to have. These Are The Signs That Show Why Giga Berlin Should Be WorriedElon Musk already said that Tesla probably needs a hatchback or a smaller SUV than the Model Y for the European market. With the performance numbers it presented there in 2020 – despite all the subsidies and in a much larger market than the US for electric cars – it will probably need it from the very beginning."

"Will be decade out for autonomous cars. You need huge data sets to train the systems. Google, apple and microsoft and gps and internet companies have an upper hand than tesla.

The world already invest in solar energy decade before tesla bought Solar company and now telsa want to use moneys in model3 to invest in sun energy. Tesla energy is late in the game"
"Wall street news is reporting the news as it is. Tesla didnt beat the numbers. It just a bit shy less from its target. It is not a exciting number to move the market to gap up. The main reason is that the stock is way way ahead of the actual performance of the company by more than 5 years. so just meeting its target is not convincing for bulls to take it further.But again no sane person would buy this stoc at 1400 PE. With increased competition, tesla cars becomes price sensitive. Meaning, it is becoming to become like a commodity. Apple is going to be entering the market. This is a 1000 pounds gorilla with a proven track record to reckon with."

This may become a recurring problem, brain drain, since many of the sharpest minds at Tesla, having been partially compensated with shares, are multimillionaires.

Is tsla profitable without those credits? Competition & free markets... allow for choices. Lets say Mercedes is the best ice vehicle. & Aaple is the best computer (subjective you pick a brand) point is the world is covered in many ice vehile brands and computers..... even if tsla remains the best EV..... there will be many brands... the market will be split..... valutions will come down.

TSLA: 1500$ coming in few weeks....
Wednesday earning will be after hours.... You all know what happened last qtr when it had record deliveries.
Last chance to cover short position -
Wait...800 billion dollar company and it missed !!!! Should drop 50%
my 2016 Model X is finally in the shop needing a repair ($900) this will be the first dime that I will spend on my 4 year old model Y. My 3 year old Chevy Equinolx a year younger has needed a $300 battery and 5 service visits for oil changes and the like. Next service on the Chevy will require front brakes. Tesla has been a fantastic car
"TSLA is 4,400. Pre-split. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!This was 255. Oct 2019 !!!!!!. Musk is a genius"
$OZSC ABOUT TO SKYROCKET WITH TESLA DEAL
I will not buy even if it goes to 400 $.
"Tesla today sell promise of FSD at $10k even when current hardware at best it will autonomus car and Self Driving.Some point to me that that is very high margin item. While I disagree as cost to maintain is very very high, even if it's very high margin, it already account in their Gross margin which if you discount EV credit, it's in single digit.So if they have 80% margin on FSD sale, They have negative gross margin for rest."
BUY THIS WITH BITH HANDS AHEAD OF Q4 earnings call. Elon will provide strong guidance for the two new factories and how the 20 billion will be spent including 25k China made vehicle and China design studio. Elon wants to take over China
I wonder what the stock would do if Tesla started offering a dividend?
I plan on buying a newer model S plaid and soundproofing it from road noise myself. It's the one thing I can't stand about an EV. It should be below 35db in noise at 70mph.
How about this scenario. FSD revenue causes stock rise. Shorters concede defeat causes stock rise. Managed funds with no stock have to buy to stay ahead of SP500 index causes stock rise. etc....
Tesla never made sense at $700 pre-split. It makes way less sense now at $3500 pre-split. Tesla needs to sell every car on Earth to justify today's share price. Think about that. Also think about the lies that all these so called analysts keep pushing out to spin this higher and higher.
"Wow, looks like I better buy this dip up!"
"Let us hope @TSLA cross $1,000 soon.. why we dream about 10K or 15k"
"At the $800B market cap, TSLA is trading at roughly 20X next year's target revenue of $40B. Most car companies trade at less than 0.5X revenue, because the margins are so slim and there is no reason to believe in the long run that TSLA's profit margins will be any better than any other carmaker. So if TSLA grows revenues by 50% per year compounded (unprecedented for a car company), in roughly 7 years they will generate enough revenue to warrant a 1X revenue multiple .... and the stock would still be overpriced. The more likely scenario is they grow much less than that and the stock price falls to a realistic multiple, so in 7 years it might be worth $50B-$100B?"
Is Musk shorting his own stock? Why is he always advertising other companies/forms of payments etc. and why did he speak like a he was high during the earnings conference?
"I am confident this will be $40 and above. Its taking its own sweet time... I know it is hard keep watching the same number... As soon as we know the merger date this thing will move up very quickly. 50,000 warrants ...sitting tight. nuvve will be better than $SBE because it is for both commercial (buses, trucks, and consumers (small ev's.) $TSLA is also going V2G route."

"Musk knows something.......stay tuned and be careful what you put your money in-----Why It Matters: Tesla is betting on cameras and radar in furthering its self-driving push, with Musk taking a public stance against the use of lidar sensors, noted Electrek. Musk said this week that even if the cost of lidar sensors became zero, Tesla would not utilize them.“I mean totally free, well, I think even if it was free, we wouldn’t put it on,” Musk told an analyst, as per Electrek.The new sensor reportedly appears to be a move that would improve the company’s efforts to enable full-self driving.Recently, Tesla rival Nio Inc (NASDAQ: NIO) launched a new electric sedan in China that features high-resolution Lidar."

why is it dropping post market
"Not sure about you guys but I would rather buy an EV from Ford, GM, BMW, and etc than Tesla. The thing just look hideous right now considering the hype all around Tesla stock and Tesla in general. This thing is now worth more than all other auto companies COMBINED. Tesla will not be the future of EVs"
"People ask ""how long can this last,"" when comparing the valuation to other auto co's, and in response I ask ""how long will it be before the other auto companies step up their game?""1. The valuation is on another level because Tesla is on another level.2. People are still comparing Tesla to car companies. As long as they do that, they will be missing about 80-90% of the big picture."

Good luck tomorrow for TSLA Mega lotto.
It's not going beyond range 700-900. I have no position..sold all. Buyer @700 and watching for 900 resistance.Don't short US Companies.
Valuation is so out of whack and even if you’re bullish you have to agree this is way outta control greed. No stock has ever held such gains over a short period of time. Not invested in TSLA but baffled by this unprecedented gain. Should make for a good story one day.
End day rally push to 900! lol.. 
There is a correction coming before it resumes it’s upward trend. I bet this hits $550 before it hits $800
TSLA shares dipping into red pre-market. Get accustomed to that. Tide is turning. Blood bath ahead.
Thanks to all the Tesla sellers ... for the buying opportunities in Tesla and the market today
"Just a little history lesson. One year ago shares were selling for $100. Yes, just 365 days ago. From $100 to $880 in 365 days. What this means is that at ANYTIME the share price can easily RETRACE. I mean 1 year is not that long ago "

"So now that there is only one date, what’s is your best prediction ... Tesla share price in the week leading up to Dec 21?"
"Tesla is the most popular asset among young investors in Europe and as a result Tesla has taken a solid advance on strong growth. The stock market price has increased eightfold during the wonder year 2020, thanks in part to the enthusiasm of a new generation of young investors ('Robinhoods'). Just before Christmas, Tesla tore into Wall Street's most influential barometer - the S & P500 - sparking an additional buying wave. Tesla does not earn from the sale of electric cars, but from the sale of emission rights. The stock market value stands at a record $ 669 billion. In comparison, that is almost twice as much as the three 'classic' car manufacturers Toyota, Volkswagen and General Motors combined. Those three each produce about 10 million vehicles annually. The Tesla share is very expensive compared to the classic car manufacturers. I would like to know what the race will do on Monday. The stock market is not open today unfortunately."

"Seems like there will be a reversal towards the end of the day. Shorts, don't be too happy now. You may lose more fingers in the process."
when the stock comes under real pressure we see what we say early 2020 when the stock went from 800+ under 400 or even 350. Today that would mean - the split 5:1 included - a quote of 400 :5 = 80....well...

That Tesla step ladder chart is something to behold. Might frame it and put it in my house.
"Bears don't get it. Tesla has become a top brand not just a ""product"". The main reason why $TSLA keeps going up is because people have assigned a status symbol and high value to the company and its products. I don't think that's gonna change any time soon. In the near future, Tesla, SpaceX, Boring Company, Teslaquilla will fall under one company. I can easily see the share price reaching $7000 within 5 years."
"Tesla is in green just because of emissions credits, not because of cars. And it has been like this for 5 quarters now.As other car manufacturers produce their EVs they won't have anyone to sell emissions credits to.Bubble!"

Similarly to $tsla. Only invest in the top cybersecurity company in the field. The others like C3 are just trailing.
"$880 wow.I’ve 20x my all in position and yet I’m not selling. I truly believe that this is the best company with the absolute best fundamentals long term than any other stock on the market. The reason being that I can see 10 years ahead and it is extremely bright. At a growth of more than 50% a year in car manufacturing alone. When you add the solar biz, storage,FSD, HVAC, and who knows what future products it’s mind boggling how massive this company will become. I honestly don’t care if the price drops short term. I’m all in for the next 10 years. Also, when starlink ipo’s, Tesla shareholders will get to buy before the opening. I will put have of everything in starlink and ride them both into the sunset. Happy ever after. Cheers!"
"Too bad Tesla is allowing the Model S to die a slow painful death. It's basic clean design still holds street creed, still has a great stance, especially from rear 3/4 view. A modest MCA (Mid-Cycle Change/ Facelift) involving only the hood, fenders, decklid (boot, for you Brits) front and rear fascias, as well as all lighting, would extend it's appeal for several more years. Other than filling the catfish mouth in the front fascia, she looks just like a 2012"

"$PCRFY is was one of the few stocks up today. On a normal day it would be 2 to 3% up. It's been doing this for the last 6 months. Slow and steady rise. Contrary to $TSLA, $NIO and $XPEV, that are so volitile, are in the red and will probably see over a 5% drop today alone."
Apparently TSLA is worth $100 Billion more today than it was a week ago.
You shorts are so emotional. No wonder yall lost historic levels of money. Tesla investors don't flinch. we've made too much money
Problem for shorts is all longs know how the game is played... and we all have sell orders at $2000 which locks up those shares from being shorted...

"My thesis on Tesla for the next two months. (my opinion do your own research, blah, blah, blah)IMHO Tesla will be dropping this week and continue dropping the week following Christmas. My reasoning besides hedge funds front running S&P inclusion is that there will be some hedge funds, mutual funds, and also some large investors that may want to book their profits this year under the current tax rate for fear of President elect Biden raising taxes next year. So, as you know those sellers will have to wait 30 days if they want to repurchase shares or it becomes a 'wash sale' therefore I believe share price could remain depressed at least until the last week of January Now an interesting variable in this thesis is that the more shares sold for those reasons the more shares they are likely to be repurchasing in other words the lower the drop the higher the pop, starting the last week of January. Which btw, if Tesla remains true to form Q4 and full year earnings will be announced the last Wednesday of the month on January 27th. I also believe Tesla will once again obliterate wall street estimates and believe we could break through $1000 before the end of February"

I hope Tesla Shorts had taken there $10 profit. Otherwise there will be more homeless shorts and that will increase unemployment numbers.
"After reading the company presentation here is my PT for the LAZR in 2030, should all go according to the plan provided by the company. They expect a revenue of $5b in 2030. assuming a P/S (price to sale ratio) of 20, which IMO is conservative for the type of industry, a Market cap of $100b is estimated. Assuming the same number of outstanding shares by then (40 million according to NASDAQ website), an estimated share price of $2500 is calculated which shows a growth possibility of 6100% as of tonight’s close at $40.88. Now it can be double of that (who could think $TSLA goes so wild) or pessimistically half of that, which would correspond to a growth potential of ~3000% in 9 years from now. That is why people are buying LAZR. Buy and hold forever guys"
the last hour will be very interesting. You should sell because earning cant never justify the current price
Which direction trend will be manipulated today?
I've sold my 60 shares that I've held on for a year I don't know how low it's going to go I made a profit but this could be a real correction. I believe Tesla is selling off to pay off the losses from the shorts that these hedge funds were holding all these stocks in the market are connected one causes the other. I'll buy back my Tesla shares once everything is settled.
It's going to the moon on Monday! Mark my words!
"Now that TSLA is at 850 and at 1617 P/E i think it's time to consider again the product vs. it's competition. There are many competitor EV cars and trucks now and many more coming that are more comfortable, roomier, ergonomically more sound, offer better customer service and better range. Tesla has great brand recognition but not a great product and I think in 6 months to a year's time we will be thinking of this stock more like a myspace. One of the originals but not the pick moving forward."
Guys l guess there is nothing we can do much but to wait until next Tuesday AH. It’s the 4th quarter earnings and l expect it will blow all expectations away. Then we will properly see 900. Fingers crossed and sit tide. I myself invested twice and average at 840. Hopefully it will turn around after next Tuesday.
"Having now watched NIO's presentation I have to say that I'm really impressed.Everything seems very well thought and they are really on the edge of AD. The big range of 1000km, replaceable battery will be able to make this a game changer. This can have Teslas valuation in a few years but with 10 millions of vehicles sold.Building the replacing stations will make ""charging"" much quicker and they don't need so many as the replacing of the battery will take max 5 minutes. They can recharge all the batteries in the station overnight and have them ready the next day. Every car manufacturer will have a replaceable battery.I never thought I might consider investing in a car company, but this looks, even given it's extremely high value something, very interesting. It's interesting to know how much IP they have in form of patents. I haven't researched that yet. They topped the camera by a factor of 7 compared to the current Teslas...use flexible lidar to enhance the tracking of only certain objects, have redundancy with the multiple viewing angles. They equip all cars with the same hardware and you can book AD on a monthly basis which is great if you don't want it or if you travel abroad for a year. It's really a milestone in car manufacturing the way I see it."
Add another $15K in put this time Jan 8th so very risky. But I will sure keep buying/Rotating if stock keep going higher. This is now new insanity at yet another new level. Keep going and some point it will fail so badly that every long will cry including those algo driven manipulator.
Anyone else buying TSLA today?
The one thing the Deep State can't steal is my Tesla gains
I'm more confident to short this than ever. The only special on Tesla is their autonomous driving software. But this wont be finish in the next 5 years if at all. As long as autonomous driving isnt working properly they are in heavy competition with other car makers with almost same technology but more capabilities in manufacturing
"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has soared about 8x over the last year, with its market cap approaching $800 billion.

"A look into the future: in Norway, 54% of all new cars sold are EV in 2020. Audi sold 9000 e-trons, VW sold 7750 iD3 (although only entered the market in September), and Tesla sold .... 7000 T3. Tesla's market share dropped to 5.5% of all EVs. Sell Tesla, it will become a niche techy-car company over time with a market cap similar to BMW3 and Mercedes."

"Lots of NIO shareholders come to $LI and $XPEV trying to convince people to sell LI and XPEV and buy NIO as if the entire market use yahoo commenting system.But let's get past the hype that seems to blow NIO shareholders minds. NIO in the presentation said that they'll use Nvidia's chip and another company's battery to make their cars even better than Tesla's cars. They avoided saying who created the battery but the battery company is Qing Tao and was confirmed at Qing Tao. At first glance it sounds great. But adopting Nvidia's chip and another manufacturer's battery means that NIO didn't produce any of these tech in-house and have no way to prevent every EV company out there from also adopting Nvidia's chip and Qing Tao's battery.Another concern is Qing Tao, up to this point, has not been able to declare that their battery works on vehicle yet. One analyst quote, ""Chinese startup Qing Tao Energy Development says it’s created the first solid-state battery production line in China, with one big caveat: Its batteries don’t work with electric vehicles (yet).""Another analyst quoted, ""Right now, they are using the batteries for “special equipment and high-end digital products”, but Nan says that they are talking to “a number of large automobile manufacturers” about using their solid-state batteries in electric vehicles.""One analyst went on to comment about the presentation, ""In this statement, NIO’s CEO William Li, didn’t choose his words carefully, he didn’t say NIO is making.. but rather NIO adopts.. This definitely indicates that NIO is simply buying the battery from a supplier (likely CATL), rather than making their own. If this is true, then the timeline of Q4 2022 for delivery of the first Solid State Battery in a car, will be heavily exposed to delays by the 3rd party.""This presentation from NIO day is a great bullish news for Nvidia. Not so much for Nio. As for other company Qing Tao, well they might never be able to release their product at all 2 years from now. Remember $QS said that they had a breakthrough and they can't release their product until 2024 at the earliest? It's not easy, and I would pick QuantumScape over Qing Tao any day.I understand NIO shareholders want to think NIO is the next $TSLA, but let's be clear. NIO is no TSLA. Not even close. TLSA would create its own chip and its own battery. That's how it prevents other EV companies from also using them."
Looks like the Bitcoin bubble is starting to burst.... Is Tesla next??
tesla is up due to massive short squeeze

BUY. Now!!!
congrats guys.....shorts i have no more words for you RIP...
Alright guys I’ve joined the tsla bandwagon. At 835$ !Was it a good decision?
Hedge fund shorts lost $38 billion this year. I guess Hannukah wasn't so joyous this year.
To all the longs ... anyone care to share your strategy at this point? Are you adding to your position here or? I’m thinking about adding although I don’t like the impact to avg share price. Pretty sure this going to continue to increase so trying not to worry about it.

Tesla stock is falling because today there is no upgrade and not much new positive news. We will see tomorrow any upgrade and positive news. So do not sell today and wait for tomorrow.
Tesla fall more so I can get in
Earnings will be surprise ! Last time I had doubt but not anymore. If tomorrow goes down to 805-810 will add 8-10 . Last time I added 3 @815. Let’s see .

"TSLA misses a few hundred units. That means that this year will be another transitional year. I will keep buying more TSLA stock if it drops under 650. My thought is TSLA will blow away the Japanese industry in the year 2022. Logic and common sense tell me that I should keep the stock and buy more if the stock dips over 10%. From the strength and momentum of the new 4680, I predict that TSLA will hit 1200 in the year 2022. The year 2022 will be the great year for TSLA for shaking the trailer truck industry. I can predict that the consolidation will happen this year in order to survive the hit form TSLA. AND THE BIG DISRUPTION WILL HAPPEN IF TSLA WILL ADD PICKUP TRUCK MODEL FOR THE COWBOYS AND CONTRACTORS."

"Don't say overvalued, say Teslavalued"
"Why was TSLA's guidance so vague? 50% sales growth over the next several years. So, whatever 2021 sales growth is, it can be consistent with 50% over the next several years, because there is no specific promise on 2021 sales.I am expecting 2021 sales to be up much more than 50% as TSLA's competitors are still ramping up capacity, especially in the US. It won't be until the end of 2022 there most of the competitors will be effective in the US. So, sales are likely to be good for TSLA.But the stock is so overpriced, there is a big risk of a sharp drop in stock price. The class action suit lawyers would jump in and argue that any false forecast warrants compensation to those to bought TSLA at high prices. These suits are usually without merit in my opinion, but they almost always get settled with substantial cost to corporation.So, TSLA's legal team has probably schooled management ""DON""T MAKE ANY PREDICTIONS"".Musk doesn't like following the advice and has tended to make predictions which don't come true. But, with the stock price so overpriced now, the downside risk is just too high.Just my speculation as I have no inside sources."
"Deutsche Bank survey says bitcoin and TSLA would more likely halve than double....I guess bitcoin but many shorts literally gave up shorting TSLA so when thinking about TSLAs SP halving it’s not incorporating the absence of discouraged short sellers who know it’s impossible to short TSLA.However, it’s too much of a wishful thought... TSLA hypothetically dropping 25% would cause buyers flock..... not to mention 2021 to 2030 is a very EV friendly decade."

Tesla shorts when it finally falls more than 30%
"2030 EV sales forecastDeloitteWith one eye firmly on progress so far, Deloitte has analysed the most recent indicators to develop an up-to-date prediction of the EV market for the next ten years. We know that BEVs already outperform PHEVs globally, and predict that by 2030, BEVs will likely account for 81 per cent (25.3 million) of all new EVs sold. By contrast, PHEV sales are expected to reach 5.8 million by 2030. A recovery from COVID-19 will see ICE vehicles return to growth, up to 2025 (81.7 million), then experience a decline in market penetration thereafter.Our global EV forecast is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years: Total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales (see figure 2). Annual car sales are unlikely to reach pre-COVID-19 levels until 2024. However, the pace of recovery is forecasted to be a result of a slowdown in ICE sales; EVs will continue to have a positive trajectory during the COVID-19 recovery period and may well end up capturing a disproportionate share of the market in the short term."

It seemed pretty marvelous. Now it's the norm. I think this is what we'll be seeing in the next couple of years in terms of self-driving cars. The first ones we see will seem like a novelty. Then very soon after, it will become so common as to be the norm. We're on the cusp of something very big here."

Tesla Model Y china price is way below expected.

"$AAPLApple Car is no joke. They have had a thousand people working on that project for a while now. Apple does not want to manufacture cars. What they want to do is put a lot of electronics and software in the cars, and then have a big markup on the cars. Apple has formed deals with dozens of partners. They are further along than people think. From a practical perspective, what it means is that Musk has less time. Musk may have to raise cash in order to compete with the deep pockets of Apple. You know for sure that Musk is looking at that 1200 PE ratio and wondering how much stock he can sell. He doesn't want to crash the stock but he doesn't want to let it sit up there at 1200 PE either. Bag holders have been warned."
This stock price makes no sense
Why are we above 800?
"I’m glad that Elon has been more conservative with the >50% predicted car production. This will hopefully stop so many reductions in price to hit the target hence, more profit. Elon also hit most of his stock compensation tranches last year which means this expense will be less this year.Great to see that the energy and storage sector is rapidly growing. Admittedly at a loss but this will get better over time. The same as any new (reinvested) business.As a long I was disappointed with the profit margins but most were due to one off expenses. I’m happy with the call and will continue investing in Tesla. Good luck to all "
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WANT TO equate TSLA with AAPL and/or AMAZON in terms of share price growth rates from their early valuations …TSLA share price has grown from $5 (Jan 2011) to $880 today. That represents a 67.5% yearly share price growth (compounded) over the last 10 years (2011 - 2021)AAPL share price grew from $3 to $143 = 30% yearly share price growth (compounded) over the last 15 years (2006 - 2021)If TSLA share price were to grow at the rate of AAPL's share price (growth of 30%/year compounded) …. for 15 years …...from Jan 2011 to Jan 2026….starting at $5/share in 2011…we’d see that TSLA share price would grow to $256 (by 2026!)AMZN share price grew from $22 to $3300 = 32% yearly share price growth (compounded) over the last 18 years (2003 - 2021).If TSLA share price were to grow at the rate of AMZN's share price (growth of 32%/year compounded) …. for 18 years…..from Jan 2011 to Jan 2029…..starting at $5/share in 2011…we’d see that TSLA share price would grow to $740 (by 2029!)NOTE: Share price numbers are all split adjusted for all 3 companies …….Conclusion: If you’re gonna claim that TSLA current valuation is fair given that it should be compared to the growth rates seen from AMZN and AAPL then you’ll see that TSLA is way overvalued.

"TSLA is not a bubble. The earnings today should be spectacular. If you want to know what a bubble is, look at GME, AMC, and BBBY. Loser stocks with unsustainable business models and bleak futures that are rallying to the moon. That's not TSLA. TSLA's future is extremely bright and their business model is quite sustainable. Maybe you'll thank me for this lesson when those three stocks run out of gas and come plummeting back to earth, however shorting them at this point in time is financial suicide over the short term. TSLA unlike many other names is not relinquishing its gains this week. I am fully prepared to buy the dip in the unlikely event earnings trigger a selloff."

It’s all fully funded with PLUG POWER now having $5 BILLION in CASH on the Balance Sheet. $TSLA has had a good run.... Now $PLUG has $1,000.00+ upside potential (split adjusted). INVEST & HOLD $PLUG ... PS: Green Hydrogen is the “Fuel of the Future” —> and as renewable energy costs continue to drop like a rock —> Green Hydrogen will be lower priced than Diesel :) ... Huge Upside in $PLUG !!!"
Do a low PE ration means your paying less for a company with little to no future growth and a high pe means your paying a lot for a company that is either over priced or is over developing now I get it TESLAS PE of 1000 means we’re paying a lot for the company but the company is giving us a lot back in return this makes perfect sense so if you study Teslas future you see that we are NOT paying too much money for a car company like Tesla because it is GROWING. What a novel idea I like that I think I will buy more shares on Monday.
"Cutting prices in Europe. Production constrained, yea, right..."
Just wondering what you guys would do. I currently have 25 shares at an average price of $341 I was thinking of selling 10 shares if it reached $800. I had bought 5 shares before the split that turned to 25 and i want to take some profits or at least my initial cost.Any thoughts.
910 at the close today or open tomorrow 930 at the close tomorrow pushing 940 after that thinking settle 900 friday hoping for alot more !
Short sellers are becoming completely irrelevant. They have been the charging station(get it) that fuels this stock more and more when needed
BUY ALL DIPS WITH TESLA. GOING TO 1000 on EARNINGS CALL
"Oppenheimer raised its price target on Tesla to $1,036 from $486."
"Don't worry I'm buying some shares tomorrow, it will drop after I purchase :P"
GM is up..Tesla is down. Ouch.

MONDAY WILL BE BIG GREEN DAY>>>>BUY THIS DIP BOYS AND GIRLS>>>>TESLA IS CHOSEN ONE>>>AND ALL LEGACY AUTO WILL BE DONE WITHIN 10 YEARS>>>THE FACT THAT GM SAYS BY 2035 THEY WILL BE ALL EV SHOWS THAT THEY ARE 15 YEARS BEHIND>>>ITS LAUGHABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am watching right now on tv a commercial add for a Opel Corsa EV with rechargable battery in 30 minutes for 169 euro/month.Competition for Tesla in 2021 is unprecedented.
"tesla as a car company is overpriced. just like Amazon as a boon store is overpriced. tesla is leading the energy and self driving revolution. step aside haters, we bout to make money"
The difference between Bezos and Musk is that Bezos does not have all his wealth tied up in the stock of a single company. Elon's net worth is extremely volatile until he decides to diversify.
"TSLA bull Dan Niles on CNBC right now! In 2021 EV market is huge for TSLA. Huge market in China for TSLA. Core for EV growth in China. Disruptive technology, tremendous upside compared to other car mfr. Investor value TSLA as tech company and not an automaker!!"
I don't know about flying on a passenger plane powered by batteries.
"Lol .80$ earnings on 800$ stock hahahahahaha. It matches industry standard of other car manufacturers, everything but valuation."
"All this analyst rating and price target totally meaningless.Only reason stock move so much because those manipulator need news to excite their following herd. Their game is gone beyond doubt that those analyst, Media, Newly World reachest man and Manipulators all working to gather. Normally consider insider trading but today when SEC and DOJ don't even look so it consider genius strategy.All those money retail invested and at risk (Like ARK has billions in Tesla) is huge problem. What we really need is regulation on funds on what valuation they can invest based on size.So it's ok to buy 1000 PE stock at $1B market cap but not even 100 PE stock at $1T market cap. Size to market ratio can apply as bigger it go there is large limitation on performing better.You can trade BitCoin at $1M does not mean Bitcoin should really worth that much. If USA govt crack down on BitCoin Trading, this can go from $1M to 1 cent in record time."

"Guys... If you sell, SAKHO would delight! "
"It's inevitable!!Every time Tesla behaves like this, there is a take off in the making.I'm not selling to the shorties"
TESLA will go down like Tilray during the green rush. NIO will be the leader in the industry for a longtime. Bye bye tesla it was nice making tons of cash but your time has expired.
Tesla debt is $15 Billion. GM debt is $118 Billion. Which company is more stable ?
"I'm not saying I understand the stock market, or TSLA's place in it.But I know that when I walk around my neighborhood, there's at least 1 Tesla car per block.Granted, I live in a middle/upper middle neighborhood. But there are a LOT of Tesla's on the road..."
If this stock doesnt start going up soon watch capital leave it to go to the new momentum plays like PLUG
"Tesla dropped china Y model prices below competition to 52,000. This tells me Tesla really feeling the heat from competition most likely really good news for NIO... This is bad news for Tesla not food news as less profit margins for a company with P/E ratio of 1300. I expect Tesla stock price to start drop again. Tesla not the only battery car anymore...."
futures going negative.. blood bath tommorow
Musk needs to tweet something to bring this up. 
DID EVERYONE SEE ELON HASH TAGGED BITCOIN IN HIS TWITTER BIO. BUY TESLA WE GOING TO THW MOON ON THIS NEWS.
"Amature hour lasted longer then normal today, oddShorts some advise, short bank stocks u will win... Look at the history of shorting tesla.Do the math"
Norway 2020 numbers are in ====> Tesla Model 3 achieved an amazing 51% reduction in annual sales Overall EV sales nearly doubled but Tesla sales fell 51%. BTW Teslas share of EV sales fell from 20% in 2019 to just 5%.
It took 400 million in made up ad hoc regulatory credits to make a fake profit this time—now that’s explosive growth!!
won't be surprised if it reached $1000 by Friday and another split at the end of February
"Thanks! Bulls, the surge this morning got me another $2k per short Jan 2022 exp. $1700 strike calls.Why don't you sell your TSLA stock and put it into these calls? If TSLA is going up to $5000, seems like a smart move. Get 8 calls for the price of 100 shares. When TSLA reaches $5000 in a few months, you will have a profit of more than $3300 per share on 800 shares (instead of just 100 $5000 shares).Smart move, right?"
"Getting ready for a gap up, chart looks bullish should hit 870s this week all good and new highs next week"
$TSLA $XPEV $LI Tesal is already the past. Hello future NIO!!!

Slow rise and stability is what we want to see.
Power in $XPEV and $TSLA. $NIO a bit shy. XPEV price tag 58$ should push NIO to 50$ near term.

"And this is what happens when you're in the S&P 500 folks... When the market turns around so will Tesla, so grab these huge dips while you can...."
"When VW sells more EV's this year than Tesla, I wonder what excuse Tesla fan boys will have for keeping this stock at a market cap that's more than the entire rest of the auto industry combined. And come Q3 when Ford and GM are finally selling real EV's that people want, I wonder what happens when Tesla has negative sales comps."
Cathie woods said she is expecting robo taxi by end of 2020. Now where is robo taxi? People doesn't understand it takes time for tech to mature. Tesla will win in long term but in short term there is a huge down side.
Currently the recall is voluntary but they are moving to make it mandatory as it poses a safety concern as it controls the car. TESLA is hesitant because it isn't the easy fix they currently claim. We are talking about changing out an integrated chip which would require the removal and disassembly of every screen and replacement of an integrated component if it is even possible.
"Ford EV car looking good! $NIO was $1 per share 1 year ago!! $TSLA going over $1,000 TRIPLE DIGIT UPSIDE, note the video presentation viewed by 60,000 viewers so far: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxEFekPUuqU&feature=youtu.be$twtr do the right thing and KEEP AMERICA GREAT!"
"As long as everyone's cool with GM having an 8x Earnings and Ford having a 9.5x Earnings while Tesla sports a 1000x Earnings share price I guess were cool right ? NO we are not. When Tesla goes down it has to take the entire EV market with it because sorting out the true values of many of the upstarts (NIO,XPENG, LI, Lordstown etc.. etc..) will take an industry wide audit of real versus speculative value, We are at that point now where the Pioneering EV companies need to show profits not just potentials, I give them a few more months tops. ... ""The big ICE melt"" We assumed anyone making an ICE vehicle can't change their business models to EV and they would be out of business soon. Well As it stands we were completely wrong and in fact GM, FORD and VW ""can in fact complet with Tesla"" and hold the honours for best selling EV in China, Norway the EU etc... Tesla's biggest mistake was it's top down strategy, ie. building few more expensive cars and gradually reducing costs to get to the mass market sweet spot of $25,000. That approach will end up costing Tesla as we have already factored in the growth moving forward. Did we all forget that companies like ford and GM has major advantages over Tesla and NIO (NIO: who doesn't even own their own factory), GM and FORD has international manufacturing, deals with other automakers and to a certain extent have already re-tooled for EVs, both GM and FORD have competitive EVs now but they also make EV vehicles that Tesla hasn't even moved into yet like delivery trucks ! When the market moves from ""tell me a bedtime story"" to ""Show me the money"" this world will change. GM, F, and VW will outsell Tesla in markets they are not already a strong player in like the $25,000 car, the main EV."
Tesla bought Maxwell Technologies for their dry battery technology. Maxwell proved 300 Wh/kg energy density is which 20-40% better than current Tesla batteries. Maxwell has a path with 15-25% improvement every 2-3 years. This should lead to 500 Wh/kg by 2027. This would give Tesla a 5-year battery lead on the rest of the world. Tesla could get a three-year pure technology lead and a two-year lead by more rapidly scaling production at its gigafactories.
Why is this Ponzi scheme not down 75% (at least)?
"Analysts don't know anything.. they just see share price going up, so they change their mind and keep investors happy. Risks, alerts and fundamentals are being ignored totally for Tesla stock price."

Fresh discount Tesla stocks tomorrow
Tesla is the first stock we have ever bought. Until now it has been only Vanguard 500 index. This adventure would be exciting if not so scary! What have I done?
"Musk should start a new low cost car company ($25K-ish), a financially separate entity from Tesla, which purchases major components from Tesla. The cars would be eligible for the $7,500 tax credit. Once the credit expires (200K), it would be purchased by Tesla. Elon, you'll thank me later..."
This time i expected numbers similar to wallstreet about 1 eps. 0.8 is really quite shocking.

Next sell level is $750
I dont understand the bashers! Numbers are good ! excellent quarter !! Future plans are good!! I dont see this giong down at all
How do you value a company that makes Widgets they barely make a profit but their doubling sales every year. Hmmmm I’d buy that company at any price ! Go Tesla Go !
"TSLA stock is more than just TSLA, it is making riches for forward thinking and nature loving people, it is empowering a much more advanced and better future."
The short to long ratio on this board is crazy. When someone loses money someone is making money. That is why Tesla is making us longs so wealthy. Never enough shorts imo.
TSLA to announce EV Airplans .........
"i have a question guys. iam an European investor in America. lately, the value of the dollar is declining and declining... after converting my euros to dollars to buy the stocks, after a while my money's value gets less. and I don't want that. but America has a lot of good stocks... what should I do?"
Monday TSLA won't move mark my words! Gonna be a flat day
TSLA today just how Elon likes em'
Ark bought twice yesterday
"Tesla's P/E is 1,633.67 Model S sales are steadily declining in Europe, USA, and China. Model X sales are steadily declining in Europe, USA, and China. Model 3 sales are steadily declining in Europe Model 3 sales are stagnant in the USA. Model 3 sales doing great in China, thanks to price cuts and new lower priced MIC version. The growth in China is also due to the new factory."
Todays drop in price is giving us Tesla longs a better base since we got rid of the week and tired today. They will regret selling......trust me I've done it I bought back in at an average of $509.04 and I'm not selling ONE share.
Tesla Model 3 was UK best selling new car in December
It’s okay guys. $nnox Short sellers will be forced to cover when stock soar again. They will get margin call We will have short squeeze or gamma squeeze like $gme. $tsla of imaging!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The rocket emoji that you like Tony/Richard.

Don’t you think making cars in 2024 is far away from today? Plans always can be changed during 2-3 years. Tim Cook might not be the Apple CEO in 2024. Anything can happen during 2-3 years frames.
I'm going to buy some shares of tesla to hold them for 2-3 years. What do you think? I'm a new one in this :\
If I buy 1000.00 dollars worth of stock can I retire early?
Bought a lot more shares of tesla today. These discussion posts are making me nervous.

"Insurance company CEO's have always dreamed that their policy holders might be a pool of one. That is, they are always trying to get out of the insurance business. That would cause obvious problems if medical insurance companies could get a file with your genetic information. That eventually will be an argument for Single Payer as it would otherwise slow or stop progress in using genetic data for medical purposes, a huge advance in the decades to come.Below is the car insurance version of that. The car company insurance gets a minute profile of where you go, many of the businesses or venues you patronize, and your driving, of course. Will they sell that information for profit? Actual behavioral data is much better than Web searches. They could out-Google Google. They will also get advanced data that would lead to recalls and data about drivers that could be used in court to shade plaintiffs.The people who save some money in insurance would actually be paying a lot more than they realize. https://www.investopedia.com/general-motors-enters-the-auto-insurance-industry-5089024?utm_campaign=quote-yahoo&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral"

Next week Tesla will go over $1000.00.. Yes !
Yahoo Finance love Gordon Johnson - he keeps on singing the same old song over and over again! No wonder he is always proven wrong!
There is very little profit margins in solar panels. The auto industry is going to be a very competitive business too. Tesla should lose at least 50% of its value during the next correction
"Study done on online sales:While most car manufacturers are selective in which markets they implement an online presence, Tesla is available in all markets studied. The company is not only represented everywhere, but also has the best results."
"Chinese EVs are competing against ICE, can't compete with Tesla!!!"
"Tesla is over valued by hundreds of billions. The house of cards will fall soon. The company has not made any profit from its business - selling cars. The only profits are from selling tax credits. The real automakers will step up their game soon, stop buying the tax credits and Tesla will have no source of profits.Elon knows this...that’s why he’s used the opportunity to sell a ton of stock at this valuation to keep his company viable.Tesla should be $100 a share. The crash is coming."
"Smart Money Buys on Potential. TSLA beat on Revenue and ""Tesla Sees 2021 Delivery Growth Topping 50%."""

Tesla just doesn't know how to earn decent profits building and selling cars.
"I aint selling till Austin, Shanghai and Berlin are running at 100%. Till then this is just entertainment."
time to buy!
I agree with Jason...it makes no sense at all to cut price if they have long reservation lists and heavy demand...something is up...I have a feeling it is Musk trying to continue the growth path and the only way is to continue to incentive and cut price...not a great long term plan...watch this fizzle early in 2021....
Reading these posts are better than watching Comedy Central. The ONLY investors who buy and sell based on these posts are Robin hood traders trading fractional share.

This just shows you how many true long term holder's Tesla has. Just bunch mini long term Buffets.
"Hello allI am new here and am a very armature investor. But! over the past year I have made great gains in my portfolio ,after watching it going no where. TESLA is one of my winners, held off on investing in them for years. I thought EV, who wants a quiet running car when they they can hear and love the growl of an ICE vehicle. Well, apparently many do. I strongly think they well grow rapidly as we all know they are much more than EV cars and trucks. I am long with TSLA but who knows may sell off some profit only should they go above 1k a share. Currently holding 350 share post split, started buy a few here a few back in May. I There may be a small pull back here and there but in the long , its going to be fully forward do to the tech they have that will be used outside the EV market as well. So many just don't get it that TSLA is tech, software and hardware. I do think it will split again in 2021 just for the fact of how ambitious Musk is and all the projects and dreams he has. Another split will give them the capital to fund those dreams and ideas and continue to grow in all directions.Have a great day and Happy New YearThat is all."

"Low volume, no one was selling out. This stock is going to take off. There are daily Youtube videos about the progress at the Tesla plants under construction. It is mind boggling that they will have the latest technology, latest hardware, and facilities that can produce whatever they want. With Starlink, SpaceX, and Neuralink Elon has proven that he can make his visions come true. Who would have thought he could put hundreds of thousands of LOS in orbit? He already has 955 in his network orbiting now. I laugh when people come here and comment about Tesla being a car company and worth more than all other car companies combined. This is my second ride up the numbers and being long is fun with this company."
Getting in on Panasonic (Tesla's battery maker) at this price is like getting in on Tesla at $50

"This stock doesn't depend on math or how many cars, or anything else Tesla delivers, it depends on Belief. The stock will only crash, when people stop beleaving, it can go down very fast, as most people don't understand how it works, they are unsure, single thing can pop everything up, one by one. If a big piece would go down, people would go in anxiety mode, everything would depend on how much You still believe. If You don't, You would die the momment this would go down a large piece. The momment when most people will stop believing in this, this stock will crash, but if people still believe in the ""Safe, high tech, zero emission future"" It won't crash. You have to understand that years and years younger generations been exposed to climate change, food additives, air pollution, and everything else to the point where everyone worries so much about their health, that believing in a Company like Tesla, all the news that Elon say's, how he say's takes away people minds out of years and years anxiety, Corona virus is a good thing for a company likes this too. People live in their own heads most of the time, worrying about everything, this company is like miracle for them. It's a problem soliution that they had for a long time, it's a wishfull thinking. Until Musk will say everything will be allright, people will believe that, because they had to. You want to believe that too. Another thing is Youtube, more and more people are sharing Musk and his companies news, so more people are getting into this everyday, it will grow little by little. As more people are getting exposed to what Musk and Tesla is. Memes are combined to reach out young audiences, as they are more likely to join Tesla becouse of the worries and fears they already have as I wrote prior to this. World is in ""Danger"" and Musk looks like the one who could ""Save"" everyone, even if he can't it doesn't matter, kids will be already exposed to this using memes. Musk is not stupid, everything he does is pure live advertising. The momment when he smoked weed, it's all about getting more and more people into this. Smoking weed looks a cool thing to younger audiences, as well as other pot smokers, they natturaly want to be a fallower as he looks like one of them. Everything about this company is more about human psychology, and emotions, not about numbers and revenue. Numbers do affect everything, but as long as this company just down fall by messing up something very bad, it will only go up. If you don't believe me, look up to a Elon Musk hall of fame video, watch it till the end, the way he ""Cares"" and almost cries, the way he messed up at the beggining of the journey with rockets, 3 fails, he spent his own money, and so on. Watch yourself, how do you feel after watching video like this? And imagine how a kid feels when he sees something like this. It's a dream, emotions that flow, he looks like real hero. Even if he is not, that I don't know, I can only assume he is a good gay. Anyway, I hope it may help someone to just to think how belief works, and what can it do. Other companies never worked on a ""Vision"" and belief before as good as Elon does, that's why this company is worth more then it should be."
This is like when in 2007 banks were run up before bad news. Apple gonna make tesla a zero
"If you think Tesla stock at this price is a good deal, I hear Elon has a bridge to sell you"
I'm curious why no one seems to care about insider selling in big numbers

"Overall, stock market is in froth IMHO. Biggest froth is TSLA. I have huge respect for Tesla and Elon, also because of his work in SpaceX. Neuralink, Boring Company etc. However the Tesla 4th quarter miserable with meagre 180k cars delivered, missing the EPS, hazy 2021 numbers. It is now completely driven by irrational cult. That is disrespect for Tesla IMHO"

"Tesla’s run has been so powerful that many bearish investors have abandoned their money-losing bets, sending short positions on the stock to a record low. Short interest in the stock as a percentage of shares available for trading recently fell to a low of 5%, down from roughly 18% earlier in the year, IHS Markit data shows."
Hello 700s that was quick
a 66% loss for Tesla stock next year....or morer
Shorts will win!
"If you own this stock, do yourself a favor and listen to the earnings conference call. After you listen to the complete call, let me know what you think. I am serious, this CC was a hindenburg of a call. They only have smoke and mirrors. At this point, I would be surprised if $TSLA was worth more than $40 per share."

Tesla buys Gamestops in order to continue to increase 10x in 2021. There are plans in the works to buy AMC to push Tesla to 30x in the first half of 2021.
"Even while all this analyst trying to create hedge for their powerful clients, I can't resist and add 35K in put.Not sure it's greed or anger of this insanity level but either way I am getting deep in and can lose nearly 10% of my asset if turn out wrong. But then I will stop trading this direction until I get $80K return from Tesla. This is now my main focus for next two week."
"A lot of people keep waiting and waiting for te slow to pull back 20-30% then they jump in to buy, but i reality is good luck to those people keep waiting and waiting it is not not going to happen by hoping the stock to drop 20-30%, I may be up and down 5-10% that all you can hope for Tesla and the long term 1-5 years this stock on the up side as hell it will reach 2400$/share in 1 to 2 years, looking at Elone Musk his wealth back in 2 years ago just 36 billions and today as of 12.21.20 he has a fortune of 118billions US Dollar.think about this company is money making machine."
But I thought they were NOT a car company ? Why all the focus on delivery numbers ? Make up your mind.

"In the last few minutes of trading, stock made a swing of 69 - that's amazing. Never seen anything like this even on options expiry day. SEC should look into this - was there a pre-agreed price fixing between big funds and index funds or something else that amounts to manipulation. After market closed, it went down by 21. So, that makes a move of 100."
BOOM!
Funny world.. Tesla is not a profitable company ever. I don’t understand this much fighting to buy stock.. there are tons of profitable companies in US market..
Merry Christmas everyone! We all have a reason to smile with Tesla this year. Let's all hope it at least doubles (if not more) next year!
Really Remarkable. Nothing holds TSLA back. Every single short will be down at the Open. It is almost too easy.
1.92 is TOO LOW!! BUY $NAKD !! 5$ TODAY!  
"No let’s think about 2021. Tesla will start the year with a production capacity of slightly more than 500,000 cars by mid year they will likely double this capacity and begin sales in Europe and in earnest. It’s possible Tesla will produce 1 million cars by the end of 2021 now that’s yet another doubling of Teslas growth factor, I like that I think I’ll buy more shares of Tesla"

"Reading Elon's email to the staff regarding the 500,000 deliveries, it reads as though TSLA will meet the 500,000 goal, but Elon has to keep it vague and sound as though he is encouraging the staff to continue to work just as diligently. He can't officially announce it yet, plus he does not want to violate any regulations. Avoid the noise. The price will increase."
"It is reported that Tesla plans to debut improved versions of existing models that approach 700 kilometers (435 miles) of range and has cars under development for the long term that could reach 1,000 kilometers.

"Blood in the water and the inverse of engineering earnings.Most successful startup enterprises find a niche product or service to generate cash and build forward with more profitable items to add to their foundation. The 2/3's $ off m3, mass produced or not, verses selling an already eye watering cash losing S or X, is the perfect scheme to die quickly. Then you have the big show rig job. Starting up maybe only if billions more are hacked by dilution. 2018 is about the end of the line for the old pay book. The promise of building additional cool stuff as a financing tool to stay in business, not so much any more. Earn, as in earning good real money soon, pay down endless mind numbing runaway debt, or be gone.... Sayonara."

"Congrats to all the Tesla stock owners who have gotten rich off the stock. Sadly I was way too late to the game. To those future owners who are going to get destroyed when this stock collapses, I offer my condolences to you ahead of time. Everyone one of you knows that you can not make a rational, logical reason why Tesla should be above $300. Even $200 is stretching it. Though Tesla is the main game in town if you want an EV today, in 5 years that will not be the case. Consumers will have dozens and dozens of alternative models from Europe, Asia, and the US to choose from that fit their tastes. Even if Tesla remains the number 1 brand for EV, the odds of it taking more than even 20% of the market share is small. So ride the wave up but be careful. I admit these levels make me too scared even to entertain buying Tesla. Sure it might go up $1000 more in the next 6 months. The house could collapse in a few months down to $400. I will look try mining my riches elsewhere."
I added 20 Tesla 200 nio love the dip
"I had received some money for my surgery which was not enough for the surgery, so I put it in buying Tesla PUTs and now I am going to lose all of it. I am scared of what's gonna happen next. My PUTs expire 1/15. Any chance it can come down to 770 by then?"
"The price of a stock or any product is how much buyers or market think it's worth. There's really no wrong or right price IMO. At this time, $TSLA is worth $800+ dollars because buyers have determined that Tesla is a very valuable company to the world's future. So let it be written and let be said."

"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. will start deliveries of its China-made Model Y SUV this month to customers in the country, as it set the vehicle at a price below some of its rivals to maintain a competitive edge.The Model Y starts from 339,900 yuan ($52,074), while the Model Y Performance car will be from 369,900 yuan, Tesla China said in a statement on Friday.

"I have seen this type of mania so many times I cannot count them all. This stock is going to destroy so many people who recently came in. Maybe, and I say Maybe, it is worth $300 a share. Thats a big correction. I have said it, and I say it again. Take your profits, put them in the bank, and pat yourself on the back. But for heavens sake get out before you get destroyed. It always happens with stocks like this. A single stock that has a market capitalization so high, that it would need to produce all of the cars sold on the planet, and even then with an extended multiple, to be worth what it is trading at. And dont try to sell me on how its more than a car company because all they do is lose on all the other businesses and they will continue to lose there."
here come the downgrades then lawsuits.
Elon concentrate on Tesla please. Short seller like Micheal burry is behind Tesla. He short Tesla stonk ! To the MOON

So many thought TSLA would be more stable as an S&P 500 stock. That is wrong. TSLA should be even more volatile. Think about it. Indexes just took away from available shares. So the SAME number of traders are now trading fewer available shares.
Who is this guy asking leading questions. It is like these analysts own the stock. The SEMI isn't coming anytime soon. FSD on a SEMI is lunacy. It will be years before you have FSD.

Every TSLA shares Just sold. Thanks for a 500% gain. I have heard from several big pension funds that they will short the stock from tomorrow. It can drop as much as 45% before mid January. Good luck.
"Index funds purchased 60 billion shares at the end of the day. They anticipated they would need to buy 80 billion but said they must have been buying during the week. Since they bought during the week they noted they are in positive territory. (Lucky them). They also noted the people who have option calls may be in a bad position. According to history, once a company is added to the S&P they drop in price. See you guys at the bottom."

"TSLA short sellers lost $40.1 billion last year and have been defeated :""It's hard to imagine anyone has had a better year than Elon Musk did in 2020. His personal net worth soared like one of his SpaceX rockets, increasing by more than $100 billion. And his loudest critics, aka investors who shorted Tesla (TSLA) stock on the assumption the share price would go down, lost a record $40.1 billion betting against him, according to analysis by S3 Partners.""""Many of the shorts were forced to admit defeat last year. About two-thirds of the short positions were unwound during 2020, which in itself was a factor that helped drive Tesla shares higher, as the short investors were forced to buy higher-priced shares to exit their positions."""

"Tesla $1T+ valuation = $ 2M /car they sale (Which is only business with positive gross margin) = 40 timeNow People talking about Tesla making 10M car. First there is no 10M car market for $50K+ SO he has to bring 20K car.Let's say they reach 10M with average price of $35K. and $5K/car gross margin.their total gross profit is $50BCurrent valuation is 20 time peak revenue gross margin there.Let's say net margin go $2k car, that again hard to achieve but we assume possible. We are talking 50 time peak net profit.Even if you spare another few billions profit from subscription business, they still very very expensive even at peak revenue.All other business, they facing very brutal competition. Solar business they were No.1 now not even No.3Battery business so far all promise and 0 delivery."

"TSLA is a great company and so far a great stock, but guys there isn't much upside room from here. Be honest with yourself, whats the bull case? x2 from here? x3 from here? that is not life changing. China is either taking over the world's best economy or at least getting close to the US. Nio might not be as great as Tesla but it has a 10x from here to get to Tesla's current valuation. Look at CNN https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/26/economy/china-xi-economy-intl-hnk/index.html"

"To potential Tesla stock buyers!! Please READ THE FOLLOWING BEFORE buying shares.There's a lot of debate about the valuation of Tesla. Proponents of the stock will recklessly promote it and will tell you not to believe posters like me. They will tell you that I am spreading FUD. But I am honest and presenting the reality. You should read the arguments from both side before risking your money in this stock.To anyone considering Tesla, understand that 1) it has had an amazing run that defied all standard expectations for a stock given the company's actual financial performance 2) past stock performance is NOT an indicator of future results 3) by every metric of company valuation, Tesla is grossly overpriced, 4) Tesla has overpromised and underdelivered repeatedly with respect to its products, and 5) Tesla does not have any ""lock"" or monopoly on any of its business.You can ""believe"" in Tesla the company, its supposed mission and Elon Musk. But none of that means that the current price for the stock is appropriate or sustainable. Proponents or ""bulls"" will regurgitate that it's the ""future"" without elaborating. They will tell you it's more than a car company, despite well over 90% of its revenue coming from cars sales. They will disregard competition from existing automakers and new EV startups. They will do just about anything besides admit that they have been wildly lucky and hit the equivalent of the lottery with Tesla's past year runup. So just think about it before you buy..."

"have predicted the past handful of quarters correctly from some information given and will attempt to do it here as well. don't care if you think I'm just blowing smoke but this will be a BIG beat for TSLA, hence why so many price adjustments northwards. capital was deployed to build out factories so the balance sheet takes a small hit BUT the secondary offering pretty much canceled that out. deliveries are on track to outpace last year and China market still a place of strong sales. expect a profit and revised guidance for subsequent quarters. interested in hearing about the other parts of their business (SaaS, solar, etc..) which aren't the key revenue generators but are still very important for future growth."
It’s a great sign TSLA is refusing to go down in-spite of so much noise about overvalue.. it’s just setting for a steady upward movement as we get closer to earnings.. will hit 900 by this week as shorts will jump in for a quick profit...
The only reason why MMs hasn’t filled my buy orders at $90 because majority of short-sellers haven’t covered and/or paid enough short interest to cover their losses from retail investors who have been taking profits off of them. Just imho and for entertainment purposes only. You didn’t here it from THE Janitor#nio to $143
"Soooo.... eps off by 20%. Unit guidance down 100k units.... will all the analysts redo their projections lower? That’s what should happen, and the stock price should come down 15%"
Who makes Tesla’s batteries?
Way back when Amazon was under $100 everyone screamed overvalued not making money selling books they will never de thrown Barnes & Noble I panicked and sold at $450 happy with my $350 profit. Biggest mistake of my investing career. I learned from that which is why Tesla has made me into a multimillionaire. It wasn’t hard to own Tesla way back when at $38. $100 and $180 a share 1000 shares was easily a part of any well seasoned portfolio. And today with 5 times the amount and 1000% rise in price well this has made up for all of Amazon.
Hope my retirement fund managers are not investing in this.

I cannot believe the craziness on this board....now TSLA will cure lung cancer....the longs complain about how many times bubble is mentioned and i am sure the shorts are tired of hearing “it is not an auto company”......haha lol...keep telling yourself that...we will see how much it really is an auto company in 2021 when competition increases and sales and margins take a pounding...
Never in my life have I seen the cult of personality that Tesla fans have. Literally more than 10 YouTube channels promoting this company. If that isn't the biggest red flag of a bubble I dont know what it. I am short and getting more short.
900 coming
This will end the day green

Cashed out both positions in our portfolio today protecting a 101% return on Tesla and an overall 91% return on the portfolio over a 6-1/2 month period (it's a rollover IRA with the first trade on June 25th). Honestly, not bad for 6-1/2 months. Now formulating our re-entry strategy."
there is one thing that puzzles me. There is no email from Elon Musk about the earning. Is it good sign or bad sign?
Setting stop losses will get you burned today. Just cancel them and hold on for a wild ride with a stellar ending
Lol you guys acting like tesla missed earning first time? Revenue is growing and the plunge was because market was down and along with that earning missed so it panic
Hard lesson will be learned...the pain is coming to those who don't know how to properly value a company.

"Rumor: Tesla Model 2 Already Developed in China & Goes to Production in 2022On January 8, information was leaked from the Chinese media that Tesla had already developed a new car model, and would soon be ready to begin production at its Giga Shanghai. The affordable compact car is expected to be produced and delivered in 2022.According to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, some of the best works of art in the world were created in China, so he believes that projects created in China will also be popular around the world. The Chinese have always been distinguished by originality, speed, and intelligence, so China is a great place to develop, create, and implement the most original and unexpected solutions.At the ceremony of handing over the first made-in-China Model 3s to owners, which took place on January 7, 2020, in Shanghai, Musk announced that Tesla plans to establish its own R&D center in China, where the company will create a car for the whole world. Musk said:“Something that would be super cool...so we’re going to do it...is to try to create a China to actually design an original car in China for worldwide consumption. I think this will be very exciting.""As early as mid-January 2020, Tesla began recruiting employees for the new development center and called on them to help the company build Chinese-style cars.Today, the Chinese media, citing reliable sources, reported that the new Tesla car model already was approved as early as September 2020. Product verification is expected to be completed in March 2021, with production and first deliveries scheduled to begin in 2022. Tesla will build its new model at Giga Shanghai.According to sources, the chassis of the car is based on the Model 3 chassis, which will also speed up and simplify the start of production. Perhaps this is what made it possible to develop a new model so quickly. Estimated price will range from RMB150,000 to RMB200,000 ($25,000 - $30,000).When Tesla opened recruitment for the R&D center in mid-January 2020, the team used an image of an interesting new concept car. We've never seen anything like it before. Whether Tesla will develop something similar at the new Chinese R&D center, or it's just a picture that has nothing to do with Tesla's future projects, we do not know. But the new China-made model is sure to be as stunning as the entire Chinese Tesla project.Good luck and GOD bless,"
"Tesla earned $331M in net profits in the 3rd quarter of 2020. Of that amount $397M came from ZEV credits that Tesla sold to other auto manufacturers. Meaning Tesla's auto and other businesses lost $66M last quarter. So, without ZEV credits, Tesla was not yet profitable as of last quarter. Does anyone know when these credits will end as other manufacturers need them less and less when they make their own electric vehicles?"
The forward guidance is in the Tea leaves they're building two new factories at the same time to keep up with explosive forward demand India will be next factory!
And why is the stock falling over a protest?
Tsla will cross 1000 this week :) I’m excited
Big Miss On Earnings. Priced to heaven. Have Fun!
if i didn't buy a Tesla model S in 2015 but invested in Tesla stock i could now buy 25 Tesla cars.
Any one have any idea if next week q4 earnings is going tonbe bullsih
"They keep talking about valuation again in CNBC. Do they even have right to talk when they push $2-3B company to $150B valuation. This has more revenue and going eCommerce which growing very fast.While I think it expensive, relative to $SHOP or $TSLA or other high flyer it's not more overvalue."
"38 shares of gold costs 840 and gives 38 x 1.70 = 64.60 in earnings per year or1 tesla gives 0.80x4 = 3.20 per year, how long will it take tesla to grow earnings to catch up"
Best move is to covert your shares over to NIO. Much better mid to long term upside Go NIO :)
Sequal to big short will be called big long. It will be about how michal blurry lost all his big short money in 2 days from TSLA
"Suppose it's going to bounce back and forth between 845-850 again?? Starting to think the ceiling is going to be approx 850 until Jan. 27, and then it could go either way by quite a lot. After selling at 850 I am on the sideline now. TSLA is an enigma to me at the moment."
"Elon had a great vision. like Steve Jobs did. I own two Teslas and I love the cars. But I am also a realist when it comes to valuation. if you take away the credits that Tesla sells, and factor in the stock compensation, Tesla is NOT yet profitable from its car business. It is a great company with a great product and a visionary founder/CEO. And its valuation will come back down to something close to how Apple was trading after introducing the iPhone which disrupted the mobile phone business and put Nokia and BlackBerry out of business. Just my 2 cents"
Incredible momentum. Keep it going !
QS is going to out perform tesla for the near future as far as pps goes in percentage gains. That tech they have will force tsla to either buy them out or buy from them as a customer. IMO
"Musk is a genius. Longs think in buying TSLA, they are buying Musk. But all they get is shares in a car company. They don't own Musk and he has other more interesting projects to attend to. Geniuses like Musk aren't interested in attending to the details of following through on execution once they have proved their concept correct. Yes, in desperate times, Musk slept on the factory floor to ensure that the Model 3 production would be successful. He's been there, done that, don't expect him to devote himself so much in the future, especially now that his maximum bonus, options to buy 10% of TSLA's shares at $40/share, is about to be fully earned.So, the future of TSLA will be dependent on how well it's executives perform versus those at other car companies. TSLA has no monopoly on talent.It's ironic that the higher the stock price goes, the sooner Musk will move his attention to other things."

Game stop to a trillion dollars wall streets always been savagely dishonest and people are just finding this out now ? Look at all the backlash against Tesla totally unfounded TESLA IS OUR FUTURE!
Buying another $5k on this dip now.
Monday will jump buy now
Does anyone have a Schwab account? My Tesla price is off by $30 and I don't know why
"Tesla paradox alert: Tesla claims they will grow 50% yoy for multiple years. Analysts say anywhere from 10-30m cars/year. Yet Musk also says the robotaxi business will boom and car utilization will increase by multiples. Don't these two predictions contradict each other? If car utilization increases by 5x, that means car market is 1/5 what it used to be. So how are they going to sell 30m cars a year when the worldwide car market contracts to 15 million cars because of FSD?"
"At this rate, Tesla will hit $1000 in 2 weeks.Bitcoin will be at $100,000"

I would buy here but i dont have no money left. I have 250 shares. I want 50 more.
"when we get 500,000 deliveries:"
This high share price is good for one thing: financing. Musk can raise a few billion here and there without severely diluting shareholders.
"Hardy last night the company gave no real guidance for 2021 on deliveries. But it will be more like 750,000 with wafer thin margins and a big fall in carbon credit payments. There is some forced buying as tracker funds top up after inclusion in S and P 500. But this is a bubble about to pop."

"A couple of years ago, I sold the shares that I owned. Had I left it alone, I'd have been a millionaire. Bad idea. Over the last 2 years I've bought and sold. Not again, no more. I'm not touching it now. Not fighting Tesla anymore, instead...enjoying the ride. In for the long haul."
"Friday was another great day for Telsa where it jumped $60B in market cap, which ended a week in which its valuation grew $152B USD, or in other words the value of Boeing and Ford combined.But this isn't the largest bubble of a generation, for as the Robinhood boys know, traditional models on Tesla are all wrong. Looking at things such as Tesla's earnings, revenues, EBITDA, etc is for senior citizens.Instead, a better measure is a percentage of total annual U.S. GDP of ~$21T USD, because it is clearly the best company in the country. Tesla is the USA, and the USA is Tesla.For uber-bulls, however, how about a reasonable multiple of total global GDP of ~$142T? Say, a modest 10x, which brings you to a very defensible $1.4 quadrillion. This is my favorite valuation. And I think is very doable in the next five years. Because, you know, if Tesla takes over the world..."

"I bought more 2 days ago at $608 I am currently holding 5133 shares and yes that’s $3.36 mil anyone who can not see a run to $700 thru year end earnings report is not a Tesla investor. Tomorrow will show another 5-8% gain $705-$710 per share most likely in the last 10 min of trading. Then MAYBE a pull back on Monday 5% tops with another slow and steady run for ALL of 2021. year end results for 2020 will be great followed by Shanghai volume increases of Model Y already in production (Early) thus another great 1st quarter for 2021. 2nd quarter will bring Berlin on line making VW sweat like a pig. After that will come Austin with Cyber and Semi Truck so if you thought Nikola’s ILLUSION of a truck was good wait till you see the real thing come to life. If you can’t see $1000 per share come September then your simply Blinded by guys like Chanos, Johnson, Brinkman Etc. Tesla has made me into a millionaire this is beyond my wildest dreams I’m not expecting a straight line to $1000 but there is very little room for substantial down turns not with this calendar of events. This WITHOUT the much talked about FSD."

"Big TSLA backer and bullish for years but I believe we get a bug dip tomorrow as we did not report big(ger) deliveries than expected. Hold on, as always it will recover and continue to grow. Charging companies have caught my eye lately and I can see $BLNK hitting $100+ here shortly. They are in control of what every EV owner needs."
What do you guys anticipate happening Monday...
"The setup for $NTNX reminds me of $TSLA at the end of last year. Huge potential, more or less neglected by Wall Street and then suddenly beginning to surge.Sounds counterintuitive but investors should buy on strength rather than weakness when it comes to tech stocks. That's why I keep adding to my $NTNX position even after the stock has risen 10% or more in a short amount of time. To be honest, that's something I had to learn over the years, but if you did that with Tesla you could have made a fortune and I believe the same is true with regards to NTNX."
TSLA will hit 1000 this coming week!
shorts covering late in the day. They're buried in mass graves now.
It seems like only 60 billion today...well there's aftermarket premarket and the day tomorrow to reach more greatness.
The short squeeze will be epic.

THE RISK LOOSING IT IS VERY VERY HIGH.THE PONZI SYSTEM WILL BURST HEAVILY, WALLSTREET NEVER SEEN AT SUCH A BIG CAPITALIZED STOCK.THE WARNINGS WERE AND ARE OVERALL. IN THE MOMENT, WHEN MORE AND MORE INVESTORS ARE SELLING, THE DOWNTREND WILL MASSIVLY ACCELERATE AND WILL BE OUT OF CONTROL.BIG SHRTSELLER WILL MASSIVLY INCREASE THEIR BETS WAHT WILL ACCELRATE THE BURSTING BUBBLE ADDITONAL.MY CLEAR RECOMMENDATION: STRONG SELL AND THIS IMMEDIATELY, IT WILL BE A SMALL WINDOW TO SELL AND TO SAVE THE PROFITS OR TO AVOID FURTHER LOSSES, IF BOUGHT TO THESE MOON PRICES JUST WITHIN LAST WEEKS."

700 I buy
"Stock was $40 two years ago. They barely make any profit. Maybe did 500,000 cars in 2020. The value with 950 million shares outstanding @ 850 is $807 billion. They need to do sales of 1.5 trillion with their current 2% profit margin to make any sense. $1.5 trillion in sales would be 25 million cars at an average price of 60K."
Buy all the Tesla you can and we will catch and pass Apple!
"A funny thing about this board is that the bear rhetoric in 2021 is exactly the same as the one in 2014 while old bears went bankrupt and left the board only to be replaced by new bears screaming this time is different.

"PE will be <1000 after tomorrow’s earnings. I also expect a spike in sp after the investor call.

Good luck to all. "
Whoever caught that 780 dip ur one lucky son of a gun
"Earnings were a huge miss this week. The way the stock had run up over the last year, and especially the last 2 months, TSLA needed to absolutely crush both earnings and revenue. Growth stocks need to grow, and grow even beyond what the analysts forecast. A slight revenue beat and an earnings miss do not bode well for TSLA."
"Sad is selling 1,000 shares @ $700.Depressed is selling 1,000 shares @ $700, in March. That's me."

"People always want someth8ng to lasts forever, especially if they made some money off it. But don’t make the mistake of marrying yourself to a stock, especially first movers.

My guess is Tesla will reign for 5-7, stocks peak in 1-2 years, if not already, stock price will never reach $1000. My guess."
"Before Tesla inclusion in S%P 500, there were many people on this board debate about the fund managers ( big, medium, small ).

"If you read Elon’s latest email to Tesla employees carefully, you would see that Tesla and Elon are more driven than ever to drive the cost of the EVs down to produce $25k EV more quickly and make EV, and batteries affordable for everyone. This gives me more confidence that I invest in the most innovative and most important tech company of my life time. Buying more shares on every dips that I can."

"Tesla is not worth what they say. Ev's will take time. I don't care what anyone says, but oil powered cars will still be around for years, and then we'll have natural gas powered cars around for good while.

This whole change over will be a life changing event, and AOC, and government don't have a clue as to how it will change everything. It's also about jobs, and much more.

can anyone tell me what time in the UK are Tesla reporting earnings please
OH BOY... Here come the downgrades
The impeachment is gonna cause a market crash today
TSLA has reached AMZN’s market cap from 3 yrs ago—and AMZN is up 130% since then.
Instead of talking smack be grateful if you made the gains and let it be a teaching moment if not. NOBODY can predict the market. I am way up in mine but as an honest and real person I've made mistakes in the past and lost. Anyone who says they have not is a liar. So kudos for the gainers and hopefully in next dip some can buy back in.It's funny reading here......I'm probably only one of a couple women here with a voice of reason. But I can tell you this.....I have a fantastic time visualizing in my head the smack talkers.......what they look like behind their worn out keyboards in real life........its very entertaining. Good luck to all. Don't be a dork

was 720 lowballing for today? 730 end of day? :O
I went to robinhood and it say market is experiencing significant volatility and potentially increase risk anyone knows what that means
What a beautiful opportunity god give me today I picked up only 100 stock for 601$
i'll add more at 850
Tesla s and x are getting overhauls right now.Ranges to be boosted to 500+ and newer interiors and heat pumps etc.
Nice little $1k short today. First time TSLA shorter. This stock is clearly short material. I'd be a more long-term short if I had better long ideas to fund. Alas I am just sitting on $1k of Bitcoin now from today's profits. I don't even like BTC but I definitely hate cash.
"Elon said on the earnings call that he will remain CEO until the mission is complete. With Tesla’s manufacturing innovations such as ridiculously large casting machines, they are on their path to substantially lower the cost of EVs. #WrightsLawRumors of $25,000 Tesla hatchback would be a game changer and i believe this is coming. Elon said that achieving volume production takes tremendous focus but their biggest limiting factor is cells. Tesla hatchback Smaller vehicle, less cells, more electric cars. I invest in Tesla because of what everyone knows, and what we don’t know. We have no idea what’s going to happen next, but Tesla has the tools and the innovation pipeline that everyone else is scrambling for."
What is wrong everyone!in 2 years max there will be 5mil electric cars on the market to choose from .do you think Tesla will sell duble in this competion...no wayIt will drop from 2000 PE ratio straigt to a 25PE ratio as every other stock on DJGeorge
"i think all your hard earned dollars should move to hydrogen where it will do some good for the environment.a car u have to plug in to charge for a long time , to drive a short distance ,with a heavy battery and strong electromagnetic field ....is a losing argument boys n girls"
I can smell the 900$
"If Tesla increases sales by 40% this year, how much should its stock price go up?"
"shorties pay so much attention to number of EVs made and sold, they forget about the FSd which will be a market disruptor to the transportation sector."
"The trouble with TSLA is a couple dozen new electric cars are out this year with the VW already selling more than TSLA in Europe. Once it starts trading like a car company, you will be broke owning this. Their ""technology"" is a box that holds hundreds of tiny Panasonic batteries. Big deal. It's not an amazing car. The Mach E is at least a Mustang with a huge support network of dealerships. What is Tesla?"
"Tesla will take over car market (but wait). Tesla will take over energy market(but wait). Tesla's autopilot will be used everywhere. These guys must have acquired same powers as Nostradamous. Nothing achieved yet but everyone here wants to paint a colorful picture for Tesla's future. In the whole history where FOMO and greed made the winners think that they know it all were the one who got punished most. 2021 is the year where many users will switch to EV at three same time other manufacturers will take a big chunk of this increase. Tesla has managed to give (rare scenario) no negative news for a very long time. But when negative starts flowing out, there will be no mercy on this stock."

Problems To come In the US After Impeachment ....
Closed over 900$ today and I will shave my head! 3rd time. Go go go 2500$ by October 20th
Everyone is focused on cars for Tesla. Energy sector in going to be big for Tesla in 2021/22. Everyone will be surprised.
Sorry for those who decided not to sell today.
"This field is over crowded, over-hyped, and ripe for a road tax."
2020 saw Teslas total sales in Europe fall and market share plummet. 2021 will see the same happen in China and Europe
I personally feel the open interest on expiration tomorrow will propel this share price even higher tomorrow! $900 coming
"Thumbs up if you will still be holding TSLA after S&P inclusion day, thumbs down if you will be selling or shorting TSLA after inclusion day."
Tesla could include Bitcoin Miner App in all cars.
"I am a truck driver, I own a model Y, my roof is solar, and the only thing that is missing is the Semi."
"""'Big Short' investor Michael Burry predicts Tesla stock will collapse like the housing bubble: 'Enjoy it while it lasts'""100% agreed. SAME thing happening for subprime mortgage crisis."
"I suddenly realized why TSLA stock does not come down: retail investors are powerful. Just look at GME, so if retail investors do not want to sell TSLA, the stock will not come down much. I cannot believe it takes GME for me to realize that. So for a cult stock like TSLA, fundamental or technical analysis simply doesn't apply, all the people who believe in elon musk simply will not sell, and they will buy any dip."
the report was pretty good for pandemic numbers buying dips panic sellers will regret it
Like this if you believe we’ll see $580 by end of day! 
"Tesla and Bitcoin are both obvious Ponzi-scheme style bubbles. Fundamentals have nothing to do with either one. It's all just speculation and momentum. One key difference is that Musk can issue new shares for TSLA at any time. Ironically, Musk may have to issue new shares in order to keep TSLA from crashing. If the souffle is about to pop, you have to turn the heat down a bit. Holding TSLA shares is suicide.Maybe you can get away with very short duration bull call spreads, as long as you're allocation is not too large."
"Game Stop ====> computer algorithms chasing computer algorithms. Tesla's P/E is 1,700. What could go wrong ?"
"Performing well considering the market. If the fed reassures, which I think it will, things will bounce back, and then we have ER."
"This stock will reach 1,000 end of the month for sure. A winning quarter indeed"
"2019 sales - 367,500. 2020 - est 500,000. That is around a 37% increase. The stock was about $70 at the end of 2019, now over $700. Tesla may have great growth, but the stock is WAY ahead of itself."
$850 next week!
"... 760 today , sorry folks. That’s my opinion"
"TSLA is the car company other car companies are afraid of. They are dinosaurs and have so much overhead in outdated equipment, outdated tech and are just plain slow to adapt. It took conventional US auto a decade (unfortunately for U.S. economy and workers) to realize that the Japanese were eating their lunch in the 80's on quality and innovation. Same now with TSLA. Big US auto always plays catch up."
"@richardIf I were Musk I might be inclined to build 5 gigafactories rather than 1. If the market wants to give you free money, why wouldn't you take it?In the end, I don't believe Tesla cars will be that much superior to any other EV maker. And a lot of other EV makers are coming. With that said, what Musk can do is just beat them all to the punch. He can just be there far sooner than they get there. For that to happen, he has to spend, and spend big. VW has committed $90 billion to EV. That's nine zero billion.They are coming. Do you get that? Musk will not have this business to himself. But what Musk does have is far cheaper capital than anyone else."
Not sure what the news about increasing revenue through providing services about!!! Why would I want to buy a car that constantly make me spend? what kid of business model is that?
OVERPRICED!!! 400
"Not sure why anyone is selling. Because all the articles that said it should drop today? Lol. Scheme for them to shake out the weak. Funds and indexes are buying HEAVY right now, just like originally said they would."
It'll again be a fun day for Tesla shorts tomorrow! ;) Tesla also got the regulatory to begin sales in Israel and is expected to start taking orders in a matter of days!!!Stay strong and say no to naysayers.
Buy both of these luxury EV stocks now! Both will make you rich and both stocks will skyrocket higher over the next four weeks!!! (TSLA) and (NIO)
"To people comparing Apple's earnings to Tesla's, you need to understand a few things. #1 these are quarterly numbers, #2 TSLA's share price is 6x that of Apple and for that it delivered less than 1/2 the EPS on a Non-GAAP basis and less than 1/6 the EPS on a GAAP basis.These companies and their cash generation ARE NOT REMOTELY IN THE SAME LEAGUE."
"depending on how low tesla goes in the coming days or early next week, I am adding..."

Lol who’s ready for Elon to announce they added BTC to their balance sheet tmr
ARE YOU SHORTS OK?
Its funny we dont hear this pe argument in Nio chat because it doesnt even have one. If it had it would over 9000
"Is all this buying the result of fractional shares? I'm canadian so I don't have access to fractional, as soon as tesla shares got too pricey I couldn't keep buying and my salary is above average. I don't see how retail is able to buy so much tesla unless its mass amounts of fractional buying or people are heavy on margine which gg if people are on margine with tesla."
"hey shorts, is it hurting just a little bit that your shorts are not going as well as your thought. instead of spending countless time glued to the screen looking for short cover, I recommend that you take a day off, enjoy the breakfast with your family, walk the dog so they don't feel neglected, and most importantly get some sleep. it's a foregone conclusion that TSLA is here to stay and move up. you have very little influence on stock movement. remember we retail investors now only have approx 16% of floating shares, supply and demand... you know"
get ready...
"Tesla will reach 100,000 a share within 2 years. This price target doesn’t even reflect how good this stock is. This is the future."
"I feel a boom coming, a nice little 60.00 pop!"
"Major breakdown of the chart, TSLA will crumble like never seen before."
"VW delivered almost half as much EVs as Tesla in 2020 across 3 of its brands (Porsche, VW and Audi). 231,600 EVs out of 9.5 million cars. Yet its market cap is only 10% of Tesla's."
Who’ll want a Tesla when the iCar is available?
"How much does the rest of the industry pay for advertisements, while Tesla spends zero?Tesla is the fastest growing car company in the world while almost all others are losing market share... but please, keep shorting lol!!!"

"Long Term Investors, I just want to let you know that I got out of my TSLA investment.It's not a reflection of what I think of the stock. I think it probably has much longerrun way to go, but it has reached a target I set for it long time ago. It's just better thatI get out now. Good luck to you all, it's been an unbelievable ride. And you guys please continue to enjoy."

"The screenshot from Bloomberg's terminal is even better than the Bloomberg's report. This is CONFIRMATION of the merger from the companies.If you think about it, today's comment from $CCIV was about both companies trying to find the best combination of institutional PIPE investors to bring more value to Lucid. And today, the legendary Chamath Palihapitiya investor released this statement:""I’m working on a new climate investment. It will be a PIPE. It powers a lot of progress in an area that is very important to me and they partner with some great companies to do it. One pager will be written and posted. Very excited to talk about it soon.""$TSLA $NIO $XPEV $LI $GM $NGA"
If you didn't realize this was happening as soon as the Pelosi calls headline hit.....I feel bad for you son . . .
I sold all my AAPL shares for 600% gains and went all in on Tesla. Why? Because I believe Apple at this point no longer has exponential growth without Steve Jobs at the helm. Products that they’ve come out with since Jobs’s passing have been incremental at best. Sure Tim Cook have been able to manage to milk the roadmap that Jobs left behind but he won’t be able to innovate and grow the company the way Elon does with his vision and passion to change the world. With Tesla’s S-curve adoption I believe we will see a 20-40x or more return in the next decade.
Told ya.
VW sold 2x more EVs in Europe than Tezla
This kitty stock is left with no ammunition or army to fight for.All are focused on other stocks

"Taking a gander at Tesla's 7-seat Model Y. Somebody call Child Protection Services! So cute how Tesla revised the description of this $3,000 torture device from ""7-Adults"" to ""7-Persons"". FYI: Most frequent type of accidents are rear-end collisions. You going to put your children back there, millimeters from the back glass? Definitely not for those with either claustrophobia, nor pyrophobia (fear of fire). Rumor is the NBA cancelled their orders."

"Honesty required- you have $25,000 to invest for 5 days , do you buy Tesla or Nio ? "
Apple entering market? Just a ploy to drag Tesla down for cheaper shares. There's already a shortage of them. Don't listen to the hype.
"TSLA is pulling down the S&P 500,,,, hmmm,, or is it the other way around.... Either way it was a bad idea for them to be listed..."
"The comparisons between Tesla and traditional automakers is so antiquated and myopic. FYI, the world is entering a technological revolution. Comparing Tesla to traditional automakers is like comparing traditional automakers to horse buggees. Anyone with enough brains and spin, can a make a case for or against Tesla. Of course Apple is entering the EV (and autonomous) space. Guess who started the whole revolution? In anything new, people will bash till they've exhausted all conventional reason, and the ""new"" becomes ubiquitous, and everyone wants in. Everyone wants in because they know it's where the money is, and all signs are pointed directly towards Sustainable Energy, Fintech, Genomics, IoT, and so on. Does Tesla seem expensive? Sure it does, if you keep comparing Tesla to traditional automakers. But, what if one automaker had the most advanced battery tech, years ahead in EV presence, had one of the most advanced autonomous tech, electric jets tech, and worldwide omnipresent charging stations; what would you think in terms of potential valuation? Not to mention Robotaxi, and a slew of other possible verticals. Would you look at Forward PE 160 times, Price/Sales 20 times, Enterprise Value/Ebitda 153 times, which all of these metrics are on par with hot growth Tech companies, and in fact, Tesla fairs beyond them. With this said, do you keep looking for the needle-in-the-haystack valuation rational that abides your inability to adapt? Or do you enhance your perspective? I'm not saying throw valuation rationales out the window, I'm simply saying that traditional valuations need to evolve, because evolution is hopefully part of becoming just a little smarter in contrast to remaining ignorant by holding on to fixed convention."
"Now it is $1,500,000.00 market value for every car delivered. Keep buying."

POWER HOUR COMING. WILL CLOSE AT $830.
"guys... I've done a lot of research and I'm about to go long TSLA because of it.... if my math is correct.... TSLA doubles once a month.... so by this date next year.... TSLA should be trading for $320,000 per share.... or a roughly $300 trillion market cap.... I feel like that's a pretty conservative number.... I give it a margin of error to the upside of 10,000%.... so I plan on putting in $10.... and I expect it to be worth $100 Billion in Jan 21.... wish me luck guys.... I'm a Tesla person!"
I remember looking at this stock 2 months before at 380 wondering if I should buy it so high or not...

Tesla's daily price swings are greater than the total market cap of Ford..............lol ...too funny
TSLA has a 5000 dollar pre split hype valuation for doing exactly what Musk wanted. Inspiring the entire vehicle industry to fast forward EV production and do it better than TSLA. LOL
Buy Tesla before it goes to 1000
Very strong resistance at 853 short term. Watch for volume pick up

"I am not sure why there are so many bashers. It’s as though they are jealous they missed the run up. You want to treat Tesla as a car company then that’s fine, but which car company that made 500,000 cars in one year and profitable? None. How many car companies are selling software for $6,000? None of them can’t even sell $850 extended warranty package. What happen to Tesla when other companies flood the market with EV? It has been said for over 5 years and the most EV seen on the road in the U.S is Tesla. By the time you see other EV, then Tesla which drives like a sport car will be $25,000. How is any EV car is going to make money selling a car with a battery can compete with a Tesla driving like a sport car for $25000? And we only talk about car. What will other companies do when they make batteries? How far can the batteries go? How low can the cost go? What keep Tesla from selling their low cost superior batteries to the market? How value is that market? What about solar? Have anyone seen Tesla solar roof? Sure it’s over $30,000 right now but what happen when it gets down to $8,000-$10,000? What if the lifetime of the mortgage is paid by solar energy sold from the house? Wake up people- the future solar. Wind will have some services. Electricity will be the prime backup. Of course, there are other usages for fossil fuels too, but the writing is on the wall. It doesn’t take a genius to see that EV is the future."
hmmm... something big is goign to happen
Teslanaires unite ! Don’t sell a single share this week. Let’s crush the shorts once and for all
"TSLA sells: cars, solar panels, batteries... all low margin businesses industry trading 1x sales. Software tech trades at high multiples because the business has tiny fixed costs (property, plant, equipment) once code is written, it can be sent cd or digitally. NOT true with car manfacturing (new car cannt be copied & sent electronically over internet. cars are tangible.... To expand production you need new plant, property, equipment, and labor to add each additional vehicle....Car industry requires high fixed costs selling expensive cyclical product......hence industry trades at low multiples...... Founder goal is too save the world (admirable, charitable) not make profits for investors.... to maintain huge valuation stock needs either 1. massive profits. 2. massive hype...."
"People ask why Tesla keeps jumping higher and higher. For long investors like me we hold Tesla not because it is a car company but because of its unlimited innovations led by Musk team. In addition, Tesla is like Apple for at least now in which products are not the main source of income but software. Also the mushroom effects between Space X and Tesla is very obvious and the more success of Space x is the more revenues for Tesla. Furthermore, the pioneering works for providing the world with cheap unlimited internet connection can make anyone speechless and the amazing innovations and skyrocket sales of its state of the art solar system (which is the cheapest in USA)can generate unlimited revenues for Tesla . Last, Tesla has the biggest gigafactories in the world which it will help the company to produce more cars and their total monopoly on cell batteries industry will enable it to sell their cars for 24 k each( in three years) because if a company can control the costs, more mass production and more cheaper prices than all competitors"
Hahaha I bet the shorts didn’t see that coming lol
"Posted to buy at 300 600 900 1200 1600 split. 380 400 600 700 800 and now approaching 900. Buy every single week. Works everytime, we will be repeating this cycle one more time."
"Do you folks really think TESLA can compete with PLUG POWER in the LONG HAUL FLEET TRUCKING MARKET? — LOL. PLUG POWER is just starting to work with O.E.M.’s to deliver their Hydrogen ProGen Engines (30% to 45% higher energy density/“power” than the competition) which are very advantageous for LONG HAUL FLEET TRUCKING. Here’s the main advantages of Hydrogen versus Batteries:(1). Liquid “Green” Hydrogen Fuel (Clean, ZERO Emissions) — versus — Toxic Batteries charged by an electric grid using primarily dirty fossil fuels. And, batteries are putting a tremendous strain on the electrical grid — increasing the potential for “black outs”;(2). 500 MILE RANGE per Liquid “Green” Hydrogen Tank; So, install 2 tanks and drive for 1,000 Miles —> “DOUBLE THE RANGE” of a battery semi truck;(3). 5 to 6 times FASTER REFUELING —> Time is money. By the time a Battery Semi is getting charged, a Hydrogen Fuel Cell Semi Truck is already at their destinations loading dock — unloading their cargo! — LOL. (4). LOWER OPERATING COSTS —> PLUG POWER offers Real Time IoT Monitoring of Predictive Service/Maintenance!With PLUG POWER vertically integrating to build the “GREEN HYDROGEN SUPERHIGHWAY” across America, the issue of a lack of fueling stations will soon be a NON-ISSUE :). As a $PLUG shareholder, I sure am looking forward to the LONG HAUL FLEET TRUCKING MARKET getting rolling :) And, with PLUG POWER’s New State-of-the-Art Automated PEM Stack & Electrolyzer Gigafactory soon to be operational, the manufacturing costs of the engine components are expected to be lower by 50%. At the same time, $PLUG will be building the 5 New Liquid “Green” Hydrogen Generation Plants along the “GREEN HYDROGEN SUPERHIGHWAY” which will increase their Gross Profit Margin on the “recurring” revenue stream of FUEL by between 30% to 35%. In the near future, PLUG POWER is going to enter into the LONG HAUL FLEET TRUCKING MARKET. I just wanted to give the TESLA shareholders a “heads up” :) ... INVEST & HOLD $PLUG ... for the LONG HAUL :)."
"TSLA's PE of 1678, means it would take 1,678 years for you to double your money, if everything stays the same. Ok, but you say it is a growth company. Well when it matures and stabilizes, lets say we give it a generous P/E of 30. That would mean it would need to have earnings of 60 billions dollars a year, about the same as its current revenue... Has to be overpriced."
What will happen to Tesla's carbon credits it used to sell to auto manufacturers now that they are producing their own EV's?

"Ordered another Tesla today, 0-60 in 3.1 seconds. Going to be a nice Christmast"
Time to correct a little..
Tesla’s core competency is manufacturing so anything they deem super profitable they can get into and dominate. People see Tesla as a pure car company but they’re not they’re also an energy company and in the near future energy is going to be one of the largest markets. Energy and robotaxi not factored into any walll street valuation model nor do they expect 20 millions car produced/year in 2030. Elon describes Tesla as a hardcore engineering team so sky’s the limit they have unlimited growth.
Not richest man ceo ever.
The P/E of this stock and NIO will fall back to reality without notice. I have seen this scenario several times in my career.
Who sold at $900? You are indeed a genius.
"Be thankful, but don't chirp! Most (if not all) of us have had successes and failures. Be humble in your successes and gracious to those who fail, and you will be far happier.

"When taking into account my entire family, we all have made a combined more than 600 grand off TSLA. Shorts will never make that kind of money. If TSLA was the only stock you ever owned and you owned enough of it you could hang up your business suit and retire to Florida. It's that simple. Whereas being a short you will at best have pocket change, at worst be broke and homeless. It's all a matter of deciding which lifestyle you would rather lead: a rich retiree or someone flying a sign at a highway exit. The logical choice to anyone with a brain is obvious."

After hours trading could have more volume than this.
"told you guys it was a healthy pull back. The stock has gone up so much, i wouldn't be mad even if it's down 200. Nothing goes straight up."
Longs like me refusing to sell our shares.
Musk needs to issue more shares to get the price up.
Everything is red today. Hold tight this will be green by noon.
I predict it reaches $2000 per share and stagnates until another stock split.
Hi guys in which directions do you feel the stock will go (on short term) if they beat their earnings? I’m honestly not sure cuz we seen other stocks drop and others jump on earnings this year.
"With money cap of 900 billion when it will hit 1000, Tesla will hit 1 trillion this year on June. That is really huge, congrats all longs"
over $1000 24 hrs from now!
This stock trades at 1400 PE. Increased competetion is evident. Price pressure is already there. He has to give one year of free charge to meet the numbers. He has to give 3 months of FSD to meet the numbers. This is price pressures. Competition is catching up. Almost all the Auto makers have EV in their offerings. Importantly people also look at Gasolene price while deciding an electric car. This price is very very high. It is unsustainable at 1400 PE. Sledge hammer is ready.
"Shorties be aware. I think it was about 2 qtrs ago, the delivery numbers was announced to be close to the target but it was also astronomical growth number. When it comes to earnings announcement, it smashed all previous records, knocked the research analysts off their chairs... and it had the majority of this run up which contributed to the split and S&P inclusion. Now, you have to read Elon’s cue when you read this announcement from yesterday... “this is a conservative estimate, and this is NOT earning announcement....”, I tell you the earning announcement might pull a surprise with positive adjustment for final delivery numbers, as well as earning record which smashes all expectations.... don’t underestimate the power of TSLA. Mark this page"
"$BMIX This stock is heading up by end of week to a quarter and here is why. (1) Jan. 4 of this year BMIX landing a massive goldmine in securing (2) permits for dig of lithium in Brazil! (2)Elon Musk, $TSLA, saw the importance in lithium and mentioned Brazil as a prime location for it & then BMIX goes and grabs (2) permits!!! (3) Lithium is needed for electric vehicles which is trending. (4) There is an expected shortage of lithium so those that have secured permits will be Golden! (5) Democratic Party favors green (solar and electric) so this stock will rise at least for the next 4 years!"
 MORE TRUCKS ORDERED = MORE $RMO batteries FOR THE TRUCKSBuying BOTH; $NGA $50 & $40 Targets!!!!! WE’RE IN TESLA country. $TSLA. Will be our next customer!!!
"Many of the S&P 500 tracking funds are still waiting hoping the price will come down, the longs are laughing their #$%$ off as they are not selling. Soon these S&P 500 tracking funds will have to buy (they usually have 90 days to do so...) We can expect $1,100 very soon...."

Brought some GME on the dip and brought my gains back home to papa Elon. Tesla at $1000 today!
"Get use to the new stock market. it is no longer based upon fundamentals but on how retail investors invest. Wall street is no longer in control. Learn to accept the new market structure. Also, TSLA is unstoppable! 800 is a strong support!"
"Revenue beat, EPS miss. But TSLA did have offering in Q4 so that may have lowered the EPS. Anothe profitable quarter. On right track."
"If you have a significant amount of money invested in TSLA, I highly recommend that you take 30 minutes to read the risk factors section of their 10-K filling: https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459020004475/tsla-10k_20191231.htm#ITEM_1A_RISK_FACTORSI don't know what the future hold TSLA's stock price but some of you shareholders are acting as if TSLA is a sure thing. When in reality the people who run the business are telling you that a WHOLE lot can go wrong."
Still another round of trades below $665.90 just keeps repeating. Like I said easy trading. Keep buying low and keep selling High folks.
"Bummer, I was hoping for a drop into the low $700's so I could buy a lot more shares :( But its nice to know how strong Tesla is by bouncing back up to the $830's - $840's.... Looking forward to hitting $900 soon..."
Expect a good amount of selling tomorrow. All the gains from last year have to be locked in and will be taxed in next year (2022). It will bring the price down for a couple of weeks (the Jan 15 options expiration). But such a correction is always good to consolidate the stock for better runs next month.
It’s like a one year treasury with 700% APR

"Not a bad day , small loss , did recover from day trading at nio. Keeping tesla bby for long."
Musk will announce new production on the red silk shorts and the stock will skyrocket.

I'm honestly looking at buying a single share of Tesla tomorrow as a thank you to Mr. Musk for sending $GME to the moon for all us tards.

Problem is, those chips have a habit of wearing out when overwritten too many times, leaving the screen blank and unresponsive. According to the NHTSA, 158,000 Teslas are susceptible to the fault and is encouraging the company to issue a formal recall."

"You shorts are missing the point. This time it’s different, PE doesn’t matter, car counts don’t matter, this is a revolution. Elon just thinks things into existence and the TSLA bulls just keep getting richer. There will never ever be a better chance to join the ELONVERSE! His farts smell like roses and he plans to use them to destroy the floral industry. They also are carbon neutral and he gets credits for them. TSLA to $10,000"
Dose any know Tesla beat estimate or not? After hour Tesla down 50$
"Your Mr. hey man is making all the wrong moves. Monetarily, politicly, and ethnically. He will not bring us together, but will bring us further apart. He will alienate us. He is trying to buy people off. We need Jobs, not free money, and false promises that can't be kept. We need law, and order, not radicalism, and chaos."
People forget what TSLA share price was prior to split
same story again. bad results and elon tries to cover with even more promises that he will never deliver as usual
"For those who think or want to believe Apple can compete with Tesla, go check out what Lucid Motors is doing right now. Apple is way behind Lucid, let alone compete with Tesla -- in your dreams."

"Lol, did anybody still think tesla is a bubble? 58 billion loss for short sellers and this is just a beginning, dont worry, all above 1000 is a good price to buy"

"It almost seems unfair. I mean look at the money us longs have made. Truly life changing stuff. And by all accounts, Tesla is just in the infancy of their true potential."
Smart investors will buy the dip. Longs will be the ones smiling at the end when it triples
Tesla's valuation increased by >$30B on 30th December after Dan Ives' bullish call of 510k-520k deliveries. Tesla's sales for 2020 are $28 Billion. Tesla missed its own delivery targets and surely missed the bullish case of 510k-520k deliveries. I wonder what this hype is about.I am dumping this piece of #$%$ as soon as the market opens. It simply doesn't stand a chance.

"I don't feel Tesla will own the EV market and will come back to earth. However, I do feel EV's are coming in droves and countries need to upgrade their electrical systems. This is where RMG comes into play. They are front and centre working with companies to build the infrastructure. Price is up over 3x in a month and I bought options today which are up 35%. This should just keeping going up as long as EV's are selling. This is something that is way undervalued and can go to the moon! Disclaimer, I am not telling you to buy or sell, you all make your own decisions based on your studies. Also, I am not a stock broker or work for any firm. Good luck!!"

Since SP500 entry Tesla has become a different beast  We are going straight back to 900 then 1000 
Dont get me wrong I like Tesla alot and I have a considerable amount of shares in them (sold initial stake in April yesterday to break even point) but I really hope this doesn't collapse not just for mine and Teslas sake but for the sake of the Nasdaq and the SnP 500.....if this does spiral downwards to even pre split values it will shock the whole system much like Leman Brothers back in the day. Even tho I'm bullish and want to retire off tesla everyday it goes up I am constantly moving my stop loss upwards in order to make sure I dont get burned. I hope for the sake of the whole economy that this stoke does not crash because it gone nearly too big to fail...any thoughts and Id like to hear from normal people not crazy shorters or maniac bulls
So why can't we just turn Tesla into another Gamestop? Asking for a friend.

I love this stock and Elon but even I can see this is going down below $700. Longs sell now while you can before it eventually hits $600
Waiting for a reasonable entry point. Say $500.
Why is Tesla so strong?
"Dusaniwsky said Tesla short sellers lost more that 40.1 billion in 2020, nearly six times the losses they endured betting against any other stock in the market. Not only Tesla a bad stock to bet against in 2020, it was the single best-performing S&P 500 stock of the of the year gaining roughly 700%. Tesla was by far the worst short in the market in 2020."

Hi everyone!I just noticed on the weekly chart on the log scale it hit the resistance line today!I think if we close below $ 856.00 it could be a turning point to the downside.All thoughts are welcome.thank you

"In my opinion: I think Ford, Chrysler, ￼￼GM, had many opportunities three decades ago to really build out the electrical vehicle, but the oil industry kept them from design and production.

"DETROIT (AP) — Tesla Inc. is balking at recalling about 159,000 vehicles with potentially defective touch screens, so U.S. safety regulators are moving to force the company to take action.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Wednesday sent a letter to Tesla saying it has tentatively determined that the screens are defective and pose a safety risk because they can cause backup cameras to go dark and defrosters to malfunction.The agency wouldn't comment beyond the letter, which is a rare step toward a public hearing and eventual legal action. Experts say the letter means that Tesla has resisted doing a recall that NHTSA feels is necessary.“It's obvious to me that Tesla told NHTSA to go pound sand, so what they're about to get, they've earned it,” said Frank Borris, a former head of the agency's Office of Defects Investigation who now runs a safety consulting business.Messages were left Wednesday seeking comment from Tesla, which is based in Palo Alto, California.Last June, the agency opened an investigation into complaints that the giant touch screens would go dark in certain 2012 through 2018 Model S cars and 2016 through 2018 Model X Tesla vehicles. It upgraded the probe to an engineering analysis in November.The letter says the agency has determined that the screens are defective because their computer processors have a finite number of program-and-erase cycles. NHTSA says the screens would fail in five to six years, which isn't sufficient for safety-critical features.“The lack of a functioning windshield defogging and defrosting system may decrease the driver's visibility in inclement weather, increasing the risk of a crash,” the letter said.In data submitted by Tesla, the agency found more than 12,000 customer complaints, field reports, warranty claims and other claims related to the screens, the letter said.NHTSA also determined that the failure rate for the screens is higher than the rate for vehicles involved in prior recalls for similar problems.Tesla tried to fix the problem with several over-the-air software updates, but NHTSA said it tentatively believes the fixes are insufficient.“I think it's planned obsolescence, which requires physical replacement of a part which Tesla tried to gloss over by sending a software update,” said Jason Levine, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety.The screen failures also can cause the loss of audible chimes and alerts that are part of Tesla’s “Autopilot” driver-assist system.The letter says that if Tesla formally decides not to do a recall, it has to provide NHTSA with an explanation. The agency can schedule a public meeting on matter and could turn it over to the Justice Department for legal action, Borris said.Borris, who reviewed the letter, called it very thorough and said NHTSA has a strong case should Tesla decide to challenge the agency in court."

"To show how overvalued Tesla is (and yes they are a great company with a visionary leader) let’s compare this to the biggest company in the world, Apple (who also had a visionary leader in Steve Jobs). In 07, Apple released their first touchscreen iPhone. They climbed to a market cap of 175B, while making close to 35B in revenue. Their P/E ratio at that time was less than 40 and they were trading around 6x sales. Fast forward to 9/2012, Apple reached a market cap of 650B (after 5 whole years and before crashing down to 365B) while making 156B in revenue with a p/e of about 12. In comparison, Tesla is expected to close out this year on 31B of revenue, while it has a market cap of close to 850B, trading close to 30x sales and has a p/e close to 1700!! This makes Tesla 5x (500%) more overvalued than what the biggest company in the world was when they released their most innovative product. Then, everything else that’s going on with the economy. People losing their jobs (unemployment at historic highs), small businesses closing left and right and last week they were expecting 70k jobs to get added to payroll, but instead 120k jobs were reduced. I get the market is forward looking but it must be looking 2+ years ahead these days and for Tesla, 5+ years ahead. Yes this will likely be a 1T+ company and bigger down the road, but with 100% certainty, they are wayyyy too ahead of their time. A crash is certain (for the whole market) but who knows when. I’ll stay on the sidelines in the meanwhile. The only thing driving this crazy market (especially this stock) is fear of inflation, FOMO and stimulus (not fundamentals). Just look at all of FAANG stocks and compare historic P/E ratios to this year. I see some people saying p/e is something created from way back when, well news for you, it’s not going away and reality is going to hit sooner than later."

Anyone holding their breath?
"What happened to ""the demand cliff"" ? For years the bears promised it was coming very soon. But we know now that Tesla is about to report yet another record quarter. Does that mean they were wrong?"
"I bought NIO, it tanked. I sold it now it is 11% up. I bought tesla now it is 2% down. This my trade "
Checks are coming in!!! Everyone will get a billionaire!!! We made it!!! P.S. Groceries will soon cost billions as well
It is ~ 1% up when an analysts downgraded yesterday and today. Think about it if an analyst upgrade it? It is due for upgrade tomorrow or day after.
Love all these bears coming out to toot. After a year of misery it doesn’t surprise me. Although I am very happy with all the Tesla data and global domination here we come.

This week will not end well for one group of investor...You have the shorts and we have investor determined to teach the shorts a lesson. Push up the price and force the shorts to recover because of margin call or have to sell more profitable position to avoid margin call... the higher the stock climb the more exposed long betters become and the equity short sellers are forced to find more equity to hold their position. Calamity will happen soon

$NIO cult growing bigger. Do not miss it. $BTC-USD holders now going over to $NIO. $TSLA hodlers too.
GOING TO 1000
"In 2019, tesla produce 365,000 vehicles out of Fremont. (Remember in 2017 musk promised 500,000 out of Fremont for 2018. I think they did half of that.)In 2020, it was just reported that tesla produced 499,000 vehicles out of Fremont AND Shanghai. And of those, about 150,000 were produced in China,.. which means only 350,000 were produced in Fremont.Correct me if I'm wrong, but 350,000 compared to 365,000 is not growth.And here's a report from InsideEV's from just 6 months ago on what they projected tesla was produce,... nearly 750,000 for 2020.https://insideevs.com/news/395889/q4-2019-tesla-production-sites-assignment-capacity/Seems 499,000 out of 2 plants is an yuuuuuuuuuuge fail.But what may appear as failure to a logical person is success to a cult member."
"I haven't had much time to poke through the earnings release yet, but it appears that 401MM in regulatory credits is still greater than 270MM in EPS. It appears that Tesla still doesn't make money building and selling cars.Certainly the idea of 50% annual growth is appealing in a world where 3% growth is considered acceptable, but is it really worth 1,320x earnings? (that is what the P/E is at $850, with $0.64 in annual earnings).There will almost certainly be a lot said of margins (blah, blah), but the two over riding realities are:1. Tesla used $1,580MM of regulatory credits to generate $721MM of GAAP earnings.2. Competition is coming.Good luck as these realizations come to the fore.(It is also worth noting that the operating costs for the new facilities has not yet started to accumulate, but the company's growth in unit sales (61%) contained a significantly larger portion of ever cheaper cars and Tesla's market share continues to dwindle due to both competition based on feature/function as well as price.). There is almost no chance that their marketshare remains above 10% for the long term.Enjoy the share price . . . it may even go higher as we get closer to a blow off top.Guru."
"The price is rising, but not a single investment house or a fund comes forward with a buy announcement.No one's buying. This rise in price is not triggered by investors demand, it's street scam. They juggle the stock between themselves forcing these short squeezes all the time.But I do have to admit these scam work. They, the street - the market making companies, do that with market leaders. That's how they made Amazon. They pump money into a leader until it so big that there's no one left to compete. Meanwhile ain't no one's buying it. Amazing, but true."

I bought 20 shares of tesla at $889 even those its coming down a bit i will hold it long term!

"I am sure Tim Cook is a good guy, good in accounting and operational... but he does lack the visioning. He will now have to answer to the board and investors why he did not even talk to Elon Musk.

"I think probably this year Tesla is going to be eaten alive by General Motors, Ford, and in the future the hydrogen vehicles. I think teslas are becoming old news and the new bronco the electric F150 and the electric mustang are all going to catch fire. GM’s E-axle it’s going to catch on and make them profitable. I think teslas time has come and gone. ￼￼"
"Tesla is profitable yes, thats all that matters at this point, growth is more important, 50% growth yoy, what company give that sustainable growth for the next 5 years, profit will come along, tesla is not an only car company, its energy, transportation, and soon incurance company, ill keep buying the dips when ever it happens please sell them to me !. You wont see anything below 1000$ soon, mark my words."
"Live on TV . 2017 = 16 EV cars to choose from 2021 = 59 EV cars to choose from 2023 = 75 EV cars to choose fromfrom all the carmakers Tesla has right now 3 models if I 'm not wrong .In other words ""COMPETITION"""
Look at how Tesla traded before and after earnings announced in Jan 2020. It really exploded for the following week. Aggressive 2021 delivery projections are going to take this higher. Good luck longs.
You need to make way way more batteries to swap out than there are vehicles on roads. Remember Batteries are the most expensive component of EVs!
If you Tesla shorties were smart you would go and cover your short position NOW and make your requisite $50/day profit. Otherwise you're going to end up eating Ramen noodle AGAIN for dinner tonight!

"I see what chamnath is saying. TESLA is not a car company. It is actually an Energy company. The market for Energy is about 30T so in this scenario, tesla only has captured less than 2% of the market. If they grow to 4%, that doubles the entire stock price."

"Tesla's latest take on it FSD system: ""All new Tesla cars have the hardware needed in the future for full self-driving in almost all circumstances."" Let's decipher... 1) ""in the future"" In other words, between now, and 2090.2) ""almost all circumstances"" No, you will not make money while you sleep... A system that is 99% autonomous, is more dangerous than one that works 90% of the time.Elon's 1M Robot-Taxis in 2020 was a blatant lie, as was the 2017 coast-to-coast autonomous trip. You have been (are still being) gas-lighted by Musk, who has already cashed in profits from fraudulent claims. And those waiting for their rocket equipped Roadster, well I'm just outright embarrassed for you."
"If you want a better risk/reward stock, look into $BFT (Soon to be Paysafe) or $Gevo (which sells biofuel and other carbon neutral products). Tesla at 600B market cap and has already got 8X in one year. At most it will stay in this range (500-700) for the next 5-10 years OR it could slowly drift down to reality (200-400). Hope everyone can make the smarter choice. Good luck to all!"

"Shorting this Wall Street ponzi scheme is financial suicide.It has been the closest bet to a sure thing as I have seen in 23 years of trading. The way Wall Street has made billions on it has been pure genius. The recipe is simple. Great story, under promise over deliver, create ongoing short squeezes and have bought and paid for analysts keep upgrading their price targets so Wall St can make massive banking fees for each raise. As for the analysts particularly Ives who went to school with he can sell ice to an eskimo. No-one can articulate the #$%$ valuation story better than him. He could convince someone that OJ is innocent. This ponzi scheme will not end until either the Fed or bond vigilantes make an attempt to protect the currency with interest rates hitting a point that matters. What bothers me is all the posts from retail shorts who keep fighting this and losing real money. My advice is to stop fighting. Its a rigged game. The fix is in. To the longs particularly Elon. Congrats and a job well done. Happy trading"
Bernie Madoff should be released...his crime was nothing compared to Tesla’s

"Who is still drinking the Kool-Aid? In the Netherlands, someone gave them a choice (e.g. VW), and then they switched. That's it. They were given a choice. Tesla has a market cap greater than nearly all the other auto manufacturers combined. It's ridiculous. Dozens of new EV models will be coming to the market in the US in 2021. The VW ID4 is particularly nice and is available now.2021 will be the year of the correction for Tesla. Not A Merry Christmas For Tesla In The NetherlandsDec. 27, 2020 6:33 AMAnton WahlmanSummaryIn December 2019, Tesla sold a whopping 12,053 Model 3 units in the Netherlands. It was 13% of Tesla’s entire global automotive unit sales for the entire quarter.This year, as of December 24, Tesla is on track for a 60% decline in the Netherlands. Mind you, that’s a 60% decline in absolute numbers.Which is worse, the decline in absolute numbers or the loss of BEV market share? Tesla isn’t even leading the BEV sales charts in the Netherlands anymore.New competitive models from Volkswagen and Volvo/Polestar have now matched or overtaken Tesla in short order. Hyundai too.Tesla is increasing sales in China, but in places such as the Netherlands, it’s losing both market share and absolute numbers of unit sales. Competition in Europe is growing fast."
Most people on this board are not understanding the role low interest rates have played in soaring PEs. Even with the Fed plowing money into bonds the 10yr rate has jumped BIGLY to start the year. What this means is that companies have to increase earnings by the same amount or else stocks will plummet. Watch the interest rates VERY CLOSELY. If they keep rising at some level they will trigger a sell off.
how long do you think competition will take to be profitable do you think it will happen in a short time span MY A*# this is where Tesla dominates and will for many years to come. they are already well ahead of the game and let's not even touch upon autonomy

"For anyone that has studied bubbles, if everyone is saying it’s a bubble, it’s not a bubble. Only when most, if not all, of the skeptics capitulate and buy in, believing outsized gains are the new normal, does a bubble at risk of bursting take hold. Tesla is still too early in its life cycle. There are still an enormous number of skeptics, as can be seen. I’m holding at least 3 years, possibly 5. There is still massive growth ahead for this company. Once everyone buys in to Tesla’s world changing products and services, only then will I consider selling."

You shorts are playing right into my hands. Keep up the good work. Bring it down to where lots of peeps and funds start buying in volume.

So Elon Musk is now worth almost as much as the market cap of TOYOTA (the entire company!). Does this really make any sense folks? At some point it all comes crashing back to reality.
$0.80/share earnings means $3.20 per year @ this price the Price-to-Earnings ratio is only 270. The stock should go up by at least five times.
KINDA SCARED ABOUT TOMORROW
"I’m all set up for a heist next week, all sorts of folks move their GameStop gains over to Tesla and they set it right on top of the heavy blanket I’ve set in Tesla and then boom, I’ve taken from GameStop without ever touching GameStop, simply had others bring it back to me, because I can"
"Elon promise a $100 million prize for development of the ""best"" technology to capture carbon dioxide emissions.You make a round trip from NY to London. You will need to plant at least 100 trees to offset that carbon footprint. what's the point? He makes news, hypes Tesla and Tesla stock flies!! He is very smart!!"
2 Downgrades today for Tesla . JP Morgan and BNP Paribas .Who's next ??
I am a tesla bull but listeting to Elon speaking on phone is hard to do. Its like he offers you something amazing but you still cant believe him because of his unconfident voice and stuttering.
I think Tesla is gonna be the biggest company in the world. I also think that Tesla will be bigger than I am imagining. Anyone else feel the same way.?
It always amazes me that Tesla haters and short sellers think posting lies on a message board will somehow validate their ten year wrong predictions. They must have no life whatsoever. Good for a laugh though.
900+ today
"Most of you longs know this is a ""sell the news"" event--just like the delivery announcement. Your profits are today, before the ER"
APPL has only 1 competitor in Smartphones and 2 or 3 in computers .TESLA has more then 20 strong competitors in EV .Impossible for Tesla to win this battle. Mission impossible !!
Interesting piece: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/seth-klarman-baupost-flags-market-risks-tesla-stock-stimulus-rates-2021-1-1029989728
Should go up on earnings day
Tsla is the only stock worth holding long term. We are on the verge of a hard reset of the economy led by a new kind of company. Cars as assets coming this year! All none self driving cars will be worth nothing. Sort of like the bank accounts of tsla short sellers.
And the madness continues!!!
dilemma: I like to invest more in either $tsla or $nio tomorrow..which one?I have $30K USD and the biggest bang! Which one will make me money within or by EOY?
"Tesla all ready priced in for the next 5 years, He will have to come up with some good looking cars and trucks cyber truck will not cut it, everybody said , one ulgy truck ,might want to redesign before production..."
"Morning. Cars are 45,000 too 125,000. Once a car leaves the lot it has no value. Think about a drill charge in garage in 10 degrees battery loses 1/3 of charge. Or in Vegas at 100 outside the battery burns up. Car is only good in city only. Say you go from Ohio to Florida. 300 miles then you charge at tsla fast charging station for 2 hours. 3-4 more times. At 2 hours too charge. Mind as well stay home. Plus you pay 400.00 a year because you do not use gasoline and it’s tax. If you charge at home 24 hours. Walmart 6-10 hours. Electricity is made of coal and oil. Battery at the end, no place to get rid of, big problems. Too fix something will cost more than any car made. Think before you pay for car, big mistake in my opinion"
$GME games are crashing market as hedge funds are selling long positions to cover margin calls
$TSLA maybe coming back to $BB given the government security compliance requirements that full automation would require. $TSLA ‘s ROS is built on Opensource Linux - not going 2 pass mustard
Ain’t selling a single share ... Tesla mode on
this video will bring TSLA to skyrocket to $1000 End of month. xD https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zewyvQEqsS4
"I am making a price target upgrade....$2,000 per share. TSLA will be taking over the entire world, quicker than competitors. The share price means nothing, just a number anybody is willing to pay to hold their money. It will forever go up, 100.00 per share every month for the rest of our lives. Once it reaches 810, the new target will be 910, etc. Sweet dreams everyone!"
Everyone who believes in Tsla knows the volatility swings are sometimes extraordinary and other times it flat lines a bit. When it does pop it’s much earned and for the most part embraced its new high! Get ready ratings in one week and a new President! Ride the wave ... it’s almost here!
"With this momentum, it might break ALL time high by tomorrow! $tsla of imaging!!! congratss long.. This stock will be 1000 in. 5 years! HODL!!!!"
"Dude on CNBC just said ..... ""TESLA delivered A+ earnings"""
With record sales - who says Tesla will not have a record earning? LOL
"my cost average is 200 dollars, strong on Tesla, wont sell one share. Made that mistake once l will never again."
New strain pulling down tsla stock. Hope it hits 850 by 15th.
"Drivers Ed says hand on the wheel at 10 and 2 o’clock, unless there’s no wheel there. Elon says the car will ‘guess’ which way you’re going to turn. I’m guessing the accuracy is 33%(left, right or straight). Who can compete with a car that can read your mind?"
Is this ever go down? Another game-stop from past 2 year... squeeze shorts to whatever... i hate shorties as they flip good companies so they deserved to be squeezed
dan Ives has lost his magic. first time Tesla is down on his upgrade to 950. market is in a correction now finally.
"this is what people said about nflx, amzn, fb. now last train is TSLA and I am not missing it."
"when TSLA breaks a new high, it destroys it. could easy run to 720+ tomorrow"
"It's not a bubble and retail doing most of the buying. Retail's too scared to buy at these levels and most buys were of massive size. I'm long and the movement literally seemed other worldly to me. I got queasy. And .... the day's volume was way above average. So who's buying? Smart money on Wall Street and those with the connections to know about it and gamblers who will see they made a good decision. But qualifying this movement as a result of hype is a fantasy. There's a good reason for these increases. We just don't know what they are - yet. So just chill and observe but don't short because if you do, you will cry."
"IF a BLUE WAVE, SHORTS WILL BE CRUSHED "
700 soon I hope
$3000 & split again!!
book value per share is $16?
Just announced China will be increasing tariffs on Tesla imports as its government is highly invested in NIO.
"Wells Fargo.......warns for investment in Tesla stock.....The valuation is MASSIVLY too much, a Ponzi system."
"given the drop, volume is relatively low, very low... again, imo, it is on sale... :-)"
Why did tsla release on weekend.
"A. musk always promised 500,000 vehicles out of Fremont alone,... not Fremont and some other plant. The 2020 goal should have been 1 million.B. 499,550 is not 500,000 and it's certainly not the 1,000,000 promised. Remember all of the millions of ""pre-orders"" and ""orders"" they used to publish? 499K is an yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge miss.""Tesla delivered 499,550 vehicles in 2020, a 36% increase over the previous year and just a few dozen short of hitting an historic and long-awaited milestone that CEO Elon Musk has been aiming for more than five years.Tesla reported Saturday that it produced 509,737 electric vehicles in 2020.Tesla was able to reach the 500,000-vehicle target by ticking up production and sales in the fourth quarter — a final push that has mirrored numerous other end-of-the-quarter efforts by the company. Tesla delivered 180,570 in the fourth quarter, setting a new quarterly record and 30% higher than the previous quarter.The company's production and sales figures were also driven by the launch of the Model Y, its mid-sized SUV, and a new factory coming online in China.""And yet tesla still loses money on each and every car sold."
"Tiislla to $300 , new administration is a job killing machine. have fun!"
"When the bubble pumps more and more, stranger explainations appear. When it passed all other car companies in the world, with a fraction of the world production you said IT IS NOT A CAR COMPANY! Now you say the Tesla share is not a share, its an asset against printing dollar or inflarion. I think now even the hardest bulls have run out of arguments to protect this ponzi scheme. Prepare for a bubble burst not seen before in history since tulip mania."
I believe in Elon Musk and his work. The dude has an extraordinary way of innovating and delivering results.
Electric AUDI or BMS is better than tesla
"New short! Bought 400 put options for Feb 12, 2021. Not only is Tesla in a bubble, but so is the whole market. If Tesla has any news on their earnings date not stellar and falls back on ""profit"", it will get crushed like a soufflé under a sledgehammer! I still feel Tesla is worth $32 per share."
"Still Fat, Still Shady! Your hair plugged leader in charge!"
Looks like TSLA will be making fresh new highs today. Up 12 in the pre market. Assuming it holds this means more pain for the shorts.
Are hedge funds selling securities to cover up the shorted loses?
"Crowded space in a couple of years. If I were Musk, I would be cashing out"
"Diversified, people thought before the split it was expensive at 1000 then the same around 2000"
Next wednesday 660 $ .
Tsla bulls are giving a.heck of a fight but dropping now. Fundamentals are catching up to reality
"If AAPL can have a $2T market cap selling a $1000 product, why can’t TSLA have a $100T market cap selling a $50000 product?"
"NASDAQ Composite (^IXIC) current average P/E=80NASDAQ Composite (^IXIC) historical average P/E=12NASDAQ Composite (^IXIC) is up by 150% in the Last 9 months, Despite TANKING Corporate Revenues, Collapsing Economy, Record High INFLATION, Record High Debt, Record Stock Dilutions and Deteriorating fundamentals! $TSLA $NFLX"
"the TSLA shorties sell Tsla high then cover by buying higher, isn't that brilliant?"
Typically if the stock goes down prior to the bell it usually goes sky high it better come up I’m using margin .....prayers needed
Tesla continues to defying gravity! Amazing!
"Apple's revenue is barely $300B.Apple's market cap is $2T.Apple is considered a tech company.Conservatively assume TSLA will produce 10M cars in 2030.If average car price is ~$35,000 (before FSD software), this makes $350B in revenue.FSD alone can have ~$50B (if half of the car buyers include FSD).Energy business will generate ~$200B in revenue.If you add revenues from robotaxi, insurance, HVAC etc., the revenue can very well reach $700~800B.Assume TSLA is valued as a tech company (for the sake of argument).Do 6~7 multiple (I think it'll be higher) to the revenue, then TSLA will be worth ~$5T by 2030.That is about $5000 in stock price compared to current market cap.you can argue and nitpick each number I present here, but if TSLA becomes the disruptor in EV and Energy business as it claims it will, you'll be happy if you buy the stock now and hold for the next decade.But, it's just my humble opinion."
Something tells me $TSLA future big rig ev charging stations will have $OZSC manufacturer components
"Hello, I had written covered call for $485 with premium of $830 that was expiring today.As the option was deep in the money, I was expecting it to be assigned and getting the $48500 however, just before the trade, I saw robinhood executed buy trade on my behalf and bought to close at $18270 which released the share collatral. I didn't place any such order.When I didn't asked for collateral, not sure why robinhood did that ? Do anyone know if there is any corner case for option sell call ? As per my knowledge, I should have got the strike price amount and stock. Any advices."
LETS GOOOOOO TEALA DOUBLING AGAIN
"Come on buy it, its only valued at $20M per car"
Earnings definitely isnt going to be massive beat. I would be shocked if the stock went up a lot.
"Looks like the memory chip card pullout wasn't all that bad, no??"
TSLA & NIO Are Driving The Shorts Crazy [Video Update]Link >> https://youtu.be/y89cEkvPKGI
Someone is holding up the price at this point. When that bid goes away (there is overwhelming down pressure today). Watch out below.
"VW delivered nearly 134,000 electric vehicles, and 212,000 electrified cars in total (including hybrids and plug-in hybrids). That's an increase of 197 per cent and 158 per cent respectively.The German Volkswagen Group is the largest automaker in the world as of 2015. As of 2019, it has 136 production plants, and employs around 670,000 people around the world who produce a daily output of over 26,600 motor vehicles and related major components, for sale in over 150 countries."
Tesla’s revenue seem to be following a parabolic trajectory and are flattening
what time is Earnings call?
remember $TSLA after battery day! $NIO will rise again...
Only 5 business days to go after today prior to the S&P inclusion date of 12/21. The countdown to the purchase of $166 billion of TSLA shares has begun. 275 million shares to be purchased. Wow! 800 is definitely within sight now.
Serious question. What happens when you buy insurance with FSD. Who is the primary driver? Who is liable when an accident occurs? I believe the Tesla will be liable because it is driving.
A dip might happen after it goes over 1200 a share. It will dip about 40 bucks. Bargain to buy now! No brainer!!!
My ave TSLA price is $835. I’m quite worried with its current price.
If there are so many millionaires with Tesla why isn't anyone selling their shares and converting to cash?Afraid of the tax hit?Cant retire yet?Want to ride it higher?
it's at the corner already!
Stay calm and enjoy the ride to 1000$
Late day Rally to $680 ! ? 
I am 57y/old with more then 30years experience in stocks. Never seen such a valuation for a company who's marketshare is just only 0.8 % of worldwide sales. Something is very wrong somewhere .....
Just ordered a Cyber Truck Tri motor AWD. sdv. 500 mile range. Go T$La !
"tesla is 1600 p/e. 1600 years of earnings to be worth this price. it's just gme like valuation, except it's a great company underneath the bubble"
"People keep saying that Tesla is more than a car company. Well, auto revenues grew by 31% YoY, thanks mostly to a huge growth in regulatory credit sales, while revenues for everything else Tesla does only grew by 16%. Such minuscule growth considering that energy deployment grew by more than 80%. It just goes to show that the energy section is a drag on earnings, and always will be. Tesla would be much better served by divesting that part of its business."
"For 2020, Tesla Inc. posted its first full-year profit of $721 million powered by record vehicle deliveries amid a global pandemic and growing demand for electric cars that is driving the company to pursue a sharp rise in output this year. Sales of 31.5 billion compares with an $862 million loss and sales of $24.6 Billion in 2019. The company topped Wall Street's Sales expectation of about $31.1 billion. The company's cash holdings totaled around $19.4 billion as of year-end 2020, up from $6.3 billion end of 2019."

Don’t even try to justify this insane valuation... it makes you sound scared and insecure
"I have made 30% with QS in two days lol. I have to say that I agree with the comment that QS is the place to be right now. I am not loyal to any stock, just money. So it's easy for me to follow the money and split or return. EV is the best sector though by far."
"If someone finds a new way to screw a bolt in Tesla, then the fanboys will discuss it here and find it as reason to buy more Tesla stocks. Pure Hysteria, FOMO, FED"

"+5 eur in frankfurt, green day for tsla"

"Ford, GM, and VW are doing well in the stock market. The number of EV brands is increasing rapidly and Tesla lost market share in Norway. These snippets are all negative news for Tesla. NIO had a 6 week consolidation before NIO-Day and peaked right after NIO-Day and since then has not shown many signs of life. Tesla has been going sideways and slightly down since 8 Jan.Any more negative news and there will be a major correction to Tesla’s price. I sold all my NIO shares around NIO day and will get rid of all ETFs containing Tesla tomorrow. Timing the market is near impossible and it may be several months before the Tesla share price crash comes, but the EV market will continue to boom for at least the next couple of years. The market as a whole, fueled by newly printed money and low interest rates will continue to break records."

Isn’t interesting that whenever GM surges that they are never pumped by CNBC like how they do $TSLA  More proof of the media’s CORRUPTION 
"Sponsored Post:Tesla Inc. recently announced that, on Wednesday it has initiated the delivery of its Shanghai-made Model Y sports utility vehicles to customers in Denmark.

"The biggest fraud....today earnings more than ugly...Profits with certificates only, PE 1700....wake up boys, the bubble will burst with - 50% within some days .Save your profits.

I guess, musk desperates.The recall also will weigh on q1 earnings and will destroy the last phantasy.Mark this posting."

"Tesla's expectations are excellent. Production will increase significantly. Tomorrow the price will go above $ 1,000. This must be in it for Tesla. Tesla go go."
"I'm gonna give you an opinion take it or leave it you make up your mind: tesla has been the absolute most shorted stock, like many billions lost. and with this new surge up, I believe it is due to shorts unable to take it any longer. this cannot go like this forever. at 500 post split this had a potential downfall to 300, at 850 nothings changed and the downfall is still 300. so I urge you to at least take profits. and if your a new trader do some math, you would have to reach 1600 to get 100%. I generally invest only in companies that can potentially reach 400% per year, you wont see that with tesla... on to some advice take it or leave it. #AAPL is getting into the ev spacs with hyundai spilling the beans that they are in talks with apple about batteries etc. #GOEV or canoo will be providing the skateboard and engineering services to Hyundai for their next evs and likely for Apple's. a company that has a market cap of 3 billion. now do you think a 700b company would be a better investment or a 3b company. I can see canoo going to 40 to 50b market cap pretty quickly ( next 5 years) do the math can tesla match that? are they going to be providing everything ever produced? that is where their market cap is going. I've been in canoo warrants at 1.8 and averaged up to 3.5. anything under 5 is a bargain. just some advice take it or leave it. go with your gut, your subconscious or whatever you want to call it."
Get Shorty---the stock is RMO...TSLA will want to have these guys on the team when it comes to producing batteries for the big rigs-----

Elon where are you?!
"Elon's one-word on Reddit ""Gamestonk!!"" caused Gamestop to take off. Elon type #bitcoin and bitcoin pops $4k+. Now in the event, there is no short squeeze on Tesla and Elon's cite one word and there is 1 hashtag in reference to Tesla the share could go up in approx 56hrs up $5k+. The USA has rejoined the Paris Accord agreement and the US government is transitioning green in the federal fleet. Tesla is years ahead of the competition in EV and the scenario for the one word and one # are readily available for Elon to get Tesla shares well past $5k+ within several hours of sent to the investing public. Elon may want to note there are now Gamestop investors with enough gains to buy some shares of Tesla and invest in a real growth company and the market completely approve of the move and cause the entire market to rise in sync."
Reddit Revolution!

Higher registrations = higher revenue!
Why is the ceo pumping other stocks and currencies? Seems beyond arrogant.
TESLA WILL HIT 950-1000 TODAY. STAY LONG HUGE BEAT ON REVENUE AND EARNINGS COMING. NOT TO MENTION STRONG GUIDANCE ON ABEWD OF SCHEDULE GIGA TEXAS AND BERLINAND CYBER TRUCK IS COMING THIS YEAR WITH FULL SEF DRIVE. LOOK FOR VEHICLE MARGIN TO GO UP ALSO WITH THE ADDITION OF MODEL Y.

"Look at that awesome, beautiful looking bull flag just 3 days away from earnings. Glad i added more shares on Friday. This is gonna rocket up this week."
New factory and product coming!!!
This will fall like a meteorite on Monday morning .
Shorts you notice how stable this stock is. We care about change. Tesla is an energy company. We are just getting started.
"Tesla has come out of scratch, off the ages into completely industry breaking concept of EV, yes apple got the capital, professional touch of going absolute perfect and distinct, so it’s going to be a strong and competitive challenge to Tesla, EOD who doesn’t love challenges, Tesla has always been about challenges, so the floor remains with Tesla !!!"

"I'm new to this board. Can anybody explain to me what makes TESLA, TESLA? Why has its SP managed to defy gravity?"
"Musk proudly states that they've sold more cars last year than in all previous years combined. Nice marketing trick. If I sell one mellon in 2021, I'll have sold initite times more mellons this year than in my entire life combined.In 2019 they sold 368K cars (and I'm rounding up), last year they sold 500K. What's the growth rate? 35% increase over last year. Not bad, but by no means a reason to have a skyhigh market value.VW's sales of EV's went up with 158% last year. Do we all go crazy about their stock? No.. but maybe that's because they are mature and showing solid profitability. https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/2021/01/Volkswagen-brand-triples-deliveries-of-all-electric-vehicles-in-2020.html"
"All believers that TSLA should be the most valuable company in the world raise your hands, thumbs up."
"unfortunately what many of the newbies to stock buying don't understand is that when things collapse it isn't just put in the order and my stock is sold, it is wait in line and see if we can find a buyer. When a stock is in free fall 90% of those that try to sell can't until it hits bottom."
"My guess for tomorrow is a +50 run upwards. The bears have to start buying, the ones who benchmark against S&P 500. Even if they hate Tesla, they have to buy it.BIG UP TOMORROW! 600+"
TSLA needs a break. $700 is good.
where I live there are 6 Tesla Charging stations in our building parking lot.... there are ZERO NIO charging stations ... need any further info on Tesla va NIO ???
"On March 9, 2020, Elon said that TSLA was high, but that in 5 years it would be worth more than this.At the time, TSLA was trading around $130/share.Why would anyone imagine the stock would be a good buy at $700/share NOW?The only words from Musk on the subject are than it should be worth more than $130 4 years from now (or so). And that's assuming things go well. (Surely, Elon wasn't expecting otherwise)."
Oh boy Gordon Johnson bashing Tesla!!!!! Better buy. Tesla will soar.
"QS will soon take all the profits from the electric car industry. Without the great QS batteries, Tesla is just a bad phone."
No one in retail is selling. Only the big boys manipulating it. Don’t give in.
This is just a beginning ROBINHOODIES/TEZOMBIES the Reckoning has just started!
It's amazing how manipulated the market is. Look no further than Bitcoin and Tesla. Two entities that should be at $50 a share max. Sham of a company. Sham of a business.
"guys this is falling for a while now, this was the burst every tesla share holder knew was coming. today just the start of it, panic sell will continue into the next week"
Ive never seen a stock go straight up like this day after day.
What's going on here?
"i liked this better when it was at 900, please go back up and keep going much thanks"
"shorts are going to get wrecked-------------Tesla EarningsTesla earnings: Wall Street pegs Tesla earnings surging 107% to 85 cents a share, with revenue up 35% to $10 billion. Guidance on 2021 Tesla deliveries as well as updates on the Cybertruck and two factories under construction will be key.TSLA stock is extended, but after looking like a climax run, shares have traded relatively tightly over past two weeks. Tesla stock could be working on a high tight flag."
"I am trying to help the shorts here. I really am. You should not short tesla, if you have already you're probably losing all of your money. Realistically tesla should dive, and yet it doesn't. I wouldn't bet against it at this point. You are gambling. This stock will probably hit 1,000. I am just trying to help."
Plan for a ride during extended session ! Nothing can stop . Guidance will be stronger for coming quarters because of expansion and climate change movement.!!
"I’m a new trader, if it’s earning day, should it going low?"
Why is TSLA falling so much? There are great news flying around but no impact whatsoever ever on the stock. Last couple of days have been a disaster. Should one conclude that good news mean nothing ? Elon Musk is commenting on other companies and giving his toy bits. He should concentrate more on revamping his own stock.
Tesla had its days...too much competition coming..NIO next big up and up
Tesla hit a high today over 900. Get ready for 2K again!
"IDK, just my opinion, but Tesla needs to expand where they sale. I live in the Midwest and have never seen anyone drive a Tesla. Let alone a dealership. In terms of sales, GM is going to kill them."
"To all the shorts: you are the one playing with fire!! I know that many of you are decent human been and really really hate to see you hurt. Please do not carry this into earning, please sell today. The week will start with 3 days to earning and you know that they will be incredible. Have a peaceful weekend."
Does jack dorsey legit think he’s Allah incarnate?

"This dip really stings, now I’m only $320 above my selling price, lol"
"There were naysayers in early November, when I bought shares between 392 and 413. Lots of negativity about how overpriced TSLA was. Now it's a good deal at $700+? The cult followers will follow it higher. I'm in it for the long. term."
"A year and a half ago, Cathie Wood said TSLA will reach $4000. TSLA bears laughed at her. Well TSLA reached $4000 today (pre-split). Who's laughing now?"
I bet when the shorts woke up this morning that they didnt imagine that they would be in this position and I would be in mine. Sorry for your losses in advance...
"In 2019 Tesla sold 4,214 Model 3s in Sweden.In 2020 they sold 3,534 despite price cuts. The Model 3 glory days are over and getting sales will be harder and harder as it ages and tries to compete with other newer designs."
"I am still convinced this stock will go higher in the short term, hit a wall, a pretty large negative stimulus is going to hit and then it will tank to 200 or less for about 10 years before it finally begins to recover towards this current price point. Seen it before with other stocks like Nvidia etc. Its coming folks, make no mistake."

"Today is gonna be the consecration of the past year for all of us. All the shorts have been trying to bring us down, but this stock was definitely the one to invest in 2020. I'll take some of my profits tonight, and see what happens from Monday on! Well down for all the longs who stayed courageous like me, even when it was down, knowing it would go back up regarding the situation."
bought at 88 usd love this..
"FYI Tesla is not heavily shorted. GME, BBY, and a few others are heavily shorted. Tesla has a 1.1 day trade closure. So for those who keep saying that...well,,,,your wrong."
$TSLA I own shares of Inovio
"If I were.Elon, I would dump all shares and buy California"
When Tesla is profitable will taxpayers continue to fund sales?Then Tesla gets valued like Toyota.
"Congrats to longs, however, this is dangerous valuation, and I'm not just talking TSLA shareholders."
come n guys its only 4420 bucks ....its not wayyyyyyyy overvalued in a market bubble
Bad days ahead through earnings...see you all at $650.....I hope it stays that high....this stock will lose half its value in 2021 once people actually logically look at all competition heating up...
"Funny seeing everyone panicked. Relax, TESLA WILL REBOUND!!"
Yahoo joins the top of the elitist censorship club. Careful about posting comments concerning BIDENOMICS!
"Elon said he may sell Tesla software and infrastructure to other car makers, Tesla could underpin the whole EV market"
"anyone ready to jump before this starts its decline, hyundai just admitted to be working with apple. canoo has been working for hyundai as engineering services and hyundai will use their skateboard for future vehicles. if you understand buying the rumor this is a big one. canoo is the only ev play I have seen that can disrupt the future ev space not the current ev space. as time moves tesla at some point will correct. hyundai just surged 8 billion in market cap just on the rumor so imagine what canoo at 3.3 billion will do. apple will be a direct competitor with tesla, elon has said this. canoo is the connection between apple and hyundai and will be the biggest upside here. just a suggestion as I wish for everyone to increase their securities."

Every portfolio manager reviewing holdings in s&p funds wants a piece of TSLA!
"Tell you what, $F and $GM have forward PE multiples less than 10 and are just as innovative, or more soYou can thank me later"
How can someone be wrong week after week for 5 years and still try to offer “advice” is BEYOND me
"Tesla is powers house now, can't take it down. it is not 2019 any more."
Back up and to $1000.00 Friday. Holding my shares.
Tesla lost another Ford in value. Note Tesla has no F-150.
Is TSLA able to hit $34000 per share or 1 Bitcoin ?There is so much room for exponential growth
"$TSLA Market Value is 1600% Greater than BMW, while Tesla Sales are 70% Lower than BMW!!!THIS IS INSANE!!!!!!!!!!"
Happy 900 fellow holders!!! Won’t be long before 1000!  thank you Tesla!
Why does TSLA keep going up without more positive news? It does not show any sign down as after split.
"News Flash!!! The entire world does not own 3 Tesla vehicles, and even that would not justify this valuation. This is not a game you are playing here. Many here will get seriously hurt financially buying up here."
Is there a Go Fund Me link for the Tesla Shorts?
"$OZSC. Tesla team, pour some money into OZOP Energy Solutions. Most likely to start supplying you with the goods. OZSC on fire and will continue!"

Oh NO!! Bubble Bursted!! Going down to $100! LOL Yeah RIGHT! GO TESLA!
Sndl is next.i said it all month.i said buy tesla at 160 before the split when no one liked it. Sndl will be 10 this year
On fire today! 
"After such low revenues, $TSLA must trade below $35.00 share. Otherwise the valuation is impossible to justify! Tesla is OVERVALUED by 5000%."
No find buys here. Just like CRM they will wait to buy. I feel 20-30% hair cut imminent
WOW! Time to Short! Watch out below...will begin now!
With increased competition in 2021 what do you think Musk will need to do to hit growth projections? Continue to drop price and hurt margins....he is already doing it now! Wake up!
"I like Tesla, a great company with amazing growth. 30 analysts even estimate that Tesla's annual earnings growth is over 40%. Yet I find it very hard to support a company that I believe is 300% overvalued. TSLA is of poor value based on its PE Ratio (1073.5x) compared to the US Auto industry average (51x). TSLA is of poor value based on its PEG Ratio (28.1x). TSLA is overvalued based on its PB Ratio (36.8x) compared to the US Auto industry average (8.8x). I have no position in TSLA which for me has been terrible in the last months. With these numbers how can the stock growth possibly continue? (Not saying it does not) Would love to get some bull answers."
LOL! Market DEEP red and we are just cruising along. Love it.
"The thing is: the lower Tesla goes, the more value it holds, imagine it going down to 60 USD again, wouldn't that be great for longterm investors?"
Th short sellers put in their input & the long holders put in their input. It will go on & on back & forth over the weekend. I will listen to what the premarket tells me on Monday morning 4:00 am est. Avoid the noise. The price will increase.
"If we’ve learned anything from $GME It’s to hold and buy, don’t sell your shares and we will rid the shorts. Easy as that!"
"The EV bubble will not last much longer. Go out in your street and see how many Tesla’s do you see. If the answer is zero then you’d know this is a massive bubble. How many Mercedes or Volkswagen do you see? If the answer is more than 3, that’s all you need to know before investing in this"
Steady hands people ... at least to those who are wavering. Market is having a dip this AM. Will be back up again in a few hours. Be greedy when others are fearful ... not fearful when others are fearful. Great time to buy the dip if you have dry powder on hand.
"Mr. Elon pls do not tweet anything about tesla, we saw how much damage you can make on battery day. Then we recovered in one month. Lets just avoid unnessessary actions "
20 shares purchased at $184. I am not a day trader. The posts are making me afraid this stock will dwindle to nothing. Hold or Sell?
Santa Rally has arrived. We are going to the moon
You all still have a chance to sell and take some profit. Institutions will now short TSLA above 850.

"personnal saving is collapsing, not good for tsla"
"Webbush analyst EV sale from 3% today to 10% to 2010.Today Tesla market cap is equal to rest of auto industry and yet even in EV Market they don't have even 25% market share. (At their 0.6% of overall market share, this is just 20% of EV sale.) How in world he can justify such valuation when company can't generate genuine profit today.Let's take their 2030 5 million scenario.Let's assume average car price is $45K today's dollar (Which no other car maker with similar or bigger size have today.). Let's assume cost of car is $30K. Let's say operating cost $6K (It is higher because Tesla run all stuff themself and I am underestimating. Profit per car is $8K ( I think with out insentive this likely <$5K for sure.So Profit is $8K at best case scenario. at 30M that's $24B profit. So in otherword it trading 40+ time 2030 earning today if Tesla able to dominate brand name and EV evolution continue and not divert to Hydrogen car (Which Elon refuse as viable option even for SEMI) and FSD without Lidar is sufficient ( Elon continue his chant on expensive and not needed even while all other expert keep saying it's absolutely nessasary for Safe FSD and other Automaker able to include in their offer that cost lower than Tesla EV car.Now question about their Battery technology. Look like it's already becoming outdated specially with $QS testing result."
"Apple , gm, Ford , Honda and many more. Competition!!"
"Even with Tesla’s stratospheric valuation (as Wien hints at) built on stratospheric expectations for the future of electric and autonomous cars, the Wall Street bulls on Tesla remain well-entrenched.“Overall we are seeing a major inflection of EV demand globally with our expectations that EV vehicles ramp from ~3% of total auto sales today to 10% by 2025. We believe this demand dynamic will disproportionately benefit the clear EV category leader Tesla over the next few years especially in the key China region which we believe could represent ~40% of its EV deliveries by 2022 given the current brisk pace of sales with 150k+ deliveries in its first year out of the gates with Giga 3,” says Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives.Ives has a bull case price target of $1,000 on Tesla’s stock, or 25% above current levels.Meanwhile, the stock’s melt-up has begun to attract a legion of Tesla doubters into the bull camp. The stock has caught several upgrades this year, only serving to fuel the speculative fervor.Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy recently marked up his price target on Tesla’s stock by $400 to $800. He says the upgrade reflects a company that has proven adept at raising capital, boosting margins and managing investor expectations.Over at RBC Capital Markets, long-time Tesla bear Joseph Spak conceded this month he has been “completely wrong” on the stock. Spak hiked his rating on Tesla shares to Sector Perform and boosted the price target to $700 from $339.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

"I've sold my shares in Tesla. I think we've seen the best of it for now. In the end stock value is only investor trust, and the shorters are starting to enter the stage."
lets go -30% today
"The difference between when I short and when people short TSLA is I go after names that aren’t firing on all cylinders. That’s where you will make big money. For example I shorted the airlines and cruise lines and department stores in March. Made the kind of money TSLA shorts will never see. At this point of TSLA were to pull back it wouldn’t even come close to erasing the gains since March. Shorts will never catch up to the longs even at this juncture. Longs will continue to make big money while shorts will make small money or have massive losses. Their valuation arguments haven’t changed in 5 years. You would think at some point they’d capitulate but they are still as determined as ever to win, even if it costs them everything. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result. Shorts have done just that for years. You have to decide if you want to be a rich retiree or be broke and homeless. Bottom line, pick another stock to short."
"As soon as Tesla reports deliveries for 2020 and it's over 500,000 the stock will soar."
"Shorts will continue to lose money in 2021 just like in 2020 with a whopping $38 billion loss! This year, that amount of loss will double!"

"Dan Ives has said that Tesla has to keep its margins growing every quarter to justify the current stock price. Tesla's Q1 2021 is going to be bad. By cutting prices so steeply, they will be losing much more money on many more cars. Expect target reduction and sell ratings from some analysts Monday."
Somebody change that after hour RED -9.45 to +green please!
well tesla semi first deliveries this year. That is massive news though.
"Oppenheimer’s Rusch more than doubled his price target on the electric vehicle maker’s stock to $1,036 from $486."
It is time for another split. Too difficult to own 100 block shares at this price.
OK boys and girls... we are targeting $800 today.. so strap in and enjoy the ride.... TO INFINITY AND BEYOND ;-)
"i am actually amazed how many people think this will hit $1000.Those who are cashing out @ 800+ are the fortunate ones.Tesla would need to earn 35billion dollars just to be on par at its valuationWith luxury vehicle margins being 15% at max, they would need to sell 5.83 million vehicles"
I feel sorry for those who panic sold yesterday
"Seriously, Tesla valuation is approaching a level where Tesla will control the world, all other tech companies will be dead... its beyond overvalue."
"Here is my biggest concern with Tesla’s valuation. Leaving a parking garage yesterday I noticed the incredible variety of cars around me. Many different makes and many different models (hundreds). People love variety, their car is part of their identity and what differentiates them from others. Based on Tesla’s current valuation the market is saying someday Tesla will make at least 30-50% of all cars on the road. That would be an incredible assumption because of the desire for variety in the cars we like to drive. I don’t see Tesla able to profitably develop such variety. I think Tesla will grow into a very significant and important company, but they will not be the Apple of cars because the car market seeks variety."

"Thnx for playing, shorts."
Oh we heading back in for more shares tomorrow sonnnn
"Where did this talk of WSB and GME come from on crashing the market. This down market has be expected since December by anyone who keeps up with the market. It may go down more but recovery will be spectacular. Tsla price is not, and has not been based on the 50s criteria, numbers and graphs, call it boomer and wall street mogul belief, for some time. It is about a company moving toward huge domination of transportation and the end of the ICE age. It is space X and Boring and Musk. Nothing much can stop Tesla at this stage of the game."
I bought 250 shares at 81.05 back in the old days---how am I doing shorties?? No have not sold one share yet...

It will be interesting if the Reddit peeps will do the same with Tesla like what they did with GME- just to punish the shorts! It’s very possible - buy the dips
"Does anyone find it odd how CNBC is always trashing Tesla and actually seems to like it if Tesla is having a down day? Now cincider this, Tesla spends zero dollars on advertising including CNBC, does this make sense now?!"

Get ready for $900 next week boys and ladies 
"A lot of the people who hate on Tesla are just people who wanted to buy the stock but felt like it ran away from them. So instead of biting the bullet they kept waiting for the drop that never happened now getting to the point where they need a monumental crash i the share price just to put them back to the point where they had first thought it had already ran away from him.Seriously, why else would they even be here? They’re not short selling or have ever suggested that they had, so where’s all this interest for TSLA coming from?"
All hard core Tesla fans should get their wallets out and pile in on the open!
$GME money moving to $TSLA tomorrow
As long as it doesn’t get hammered. I’m good. I hate earnings days. Tech can get so punished if just one line item misses.
This is not robinhooders increasing the market cap the value of GM or Ford everyday. This is fed money flowing thru wall street manipulating asset prices.

"Licensing Tesla software to other automakers, this company will be printing money very soon. Stay long and strong Tesla, don't sell 1 share!"
"AAPL sold 11M phones in 2008, and now they sell more than 200M phones.TSLA selling a car is like selling a pack of 50 iPhones (1000$ a piece). Tesla sold 500k cars, that is equivalent of 25M phone sales this year. I am comparing both companies by first successful year and Tesla is already ahead of Apple and will surpass APPL in valuation in future. Now imagine where TSLA would go in 10 years? BTW Tesla has their own factory and Apple outsourced it.There is no cheap android or samsung around to compete in next 4 years. Unlike phones, cars are order of magnitude difficult to make.Can you now understand what Tesla’s potential is? It is just the beginning.... wait for the bigger hockey stick when they start selling software and apps and games in their self-driving cars.You can thank me later..."
"VW posted over 12 billion profit and this turd will be lucky for 3 billion. I love how people say TSLA is not a car company yet the only revenue stream is cars/tax credits and the stock rises and falls significantly on announcements related to its car business. The typical response is TSLA is a company of 20+ startups, to which i counter 90% of startups fail and the ones that I’ve heard about are just jokes that people with too much money (Musk) created out of boredom (e.g. the boring company and it’s flamethrower)."
"$NPEV the real value will come in watching the stock grow over months and years as the company matures, enters new markets and turns profitable.... which is exactly what $TSLA did."
"You gotta love all the Tesla shorter chicken hawks. They're trying everything to scare people so that they'll sell their Tesla shares, but nothing is working. I'm surprised that the chicken hawks haven't resorted to telling people that holding Tesla shares will give you cancer...!"
Just added more at these great discounts before the next doubling. Glad to see people don't really understand what's happening yet.
"Very interesting, that TSLA has been allways considered overvalued, as far as I can remember, at least on this site! Does anybody knows when TSLA started to be overvalued? Cramer was agains investing in TSLA, when it was around $10, split adjusted!Isn't it P/E mostly meaningless, when applied to growth companies?"
"Tesla to Produce 800 million cars?PE is often used as a realistic barometer of a companies value. With an auto producer that PE could be extended to cars produced. For example, Toyota produced 8.8 million cars last year to achieve earnings. Their PE is 9.21. This indicates that Toyota needs to produce 8.8 million cars times 9.21 years of earnings to meet market cap. This total is 81,480,000 vehicles.Tesla produced 500,000 cars last year. Their PE is 1,628 and this is not a fully diluted PE. Multiply the two and the total is 814 million cars. Fully diluted and this number nears 900 million. There is not enough raw material capacity to achieve this in the next 10 years. World auto production in 2019 was 91,786,861. Tesla, at their present margin ratios which would include the sale of regulatory credits, would need to sell every car in the world for 10 years to have a PE similar to Toyota. The Tesla market cap is absurd at best. Buy it now and you will pay a hefty price in the next few years."

"Hello, can anyone please give me advise on Tesla? I purchased a call option, I feel it will be bullish?"
this stock is insane. We literally had a coup yesterday and it's still going up. This is either a huge bubble or the market's broken.
"I try to be very logical with my wife's IRA that I manage. That's where we keep our Tesla stock. I keep a very close eye on this to protect our profit. I've considered using a trailing stop loss. Just hadn't placed it yet because of Tesla's volatility. I've heard this week, Tesla could see a significant drop because of the short interest. After yesterday's drop, I wanted to protect profit because I felt Tesla would continue to go down so I placed a stop limit on our 500 shares at $805. I should have made it $800 because unfortunately, it briefly dipped to just under $804, triggering a sale. I was fine with that at the time because it locked in a 100% profit. Then I saw the premarket and thought #$%$! So, back in at $830.85. That little mistake cost me almost $13,000. Live and learn, right? I need to do better with my exit and re-entry strategy I guess. Or perhaps, just don't sell. I just don't ever want to lose a lot of profit because of greed."
By Warrants while it cheap. you can get it for $60. This stock now not going down unless someone beat by miles. Toyota Solid state battery is only unknown even when there are 10's other trying.

"At this point people aren't really investing in the company, the product or even elon. They are investing in Tesla because it's the hottest stock right now and only goes up. I think Tesla will be a 2-4T dollar company in like 5-10 years but it makes no sense to buy at these levels right now. I've made tonnes of money off tesla now. Even if it went to 1-2T this year thats like a 1-2x gain. There are many other stocks on the market right now offering the potential for way more with way less risk. If tesla goes south and you aren't quick enough say bye bye to 90% of your money invested for potentially years."

"Goals for new year include electric trucks, 'robotaxis' Tesla will ring in 2021 with a ""war chest"" of around $20 billion, plenty to fund ambitious plans that include the launch of its futuristic-looking, all-electric pickup and heavy-duty trucks.Tesla (TSLA) is fresh from a $5 billion equity tap, its second in three months , which Chief Executive Elon Musk said he and other Tesla executives debated but in the end thought it was ""probably a good thing"" as it would retire debt and increase the security of the company.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas calculated that $20 billion, saying in a note Thursday that was his estimate for pro-forma gross cash balance. At the end of third quarter, Tesla said it had $14.5 billion in cash and equivalents, a bump of $5.9 billion from the second quarter.""We forecast Tesla to spend (about $50 billion) in combined capex and R&D"" from 2021 through 2025, a figure that could prove to be ""very conservative,"" he said. That also compares with $27 billion spending target at General Motors Co. (GM) over a similar time span, Jonas said.Besides the plan for the new pickup and commercial trucks, the year for Tesla also includes seeing to completion its two new factories, one outside Berlin, Germany and another outside Austin, Texas.Tesla said it was ""on track"" to start deliveries from the two new plants in 2021, with the Texas factory tasked with building the Cybertruck and the heavy-duty Semi in addition to Model Y and Model 3 vehicles for the East Coast. Tesla's factory in Fremont, Calif., is currently its sole vehicle-making plant in the U.S.There are also plans to focus on developing a fleet of ""robotaxis,"" expand its insurance offerings, and continue to develop its in-house battery cells it hopes to be cheaper and better-performing batteries.While Tesla has not given official word of its sales goals for 2021, it came close enough for some.On a call discussing third-quarter results with investors, one analyst estimated 2021 sales between 840,000 to 1 million vehicles, and Musk responded by saying that sales likely will be ""in that vicinity"" and that the analyst was ""not far off.""Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn then added that Tesla will provide official 2021 guidance when it reports fourth-quarter results in early 2021, seeming to prevent Musk from saying more. Tesla has kept its target to sell half a million vehicles in 2020.Tesla shares have broken strings of record closes this year, with the latest boost coming from a Dec. 21 inclusion in the S&P 500 index. Tesla's market valuation hovers around $600 billion. The stock also went through a 5-to1 split in August Optimism on Tesla has also lifted shares of other electric-vehicle makers such as Nikola Corp. (NKLA) and China's Nio Inc. (NIO), Li Auto Inc. (LI), and XPeng Inc. (XPEV), which have soared past their initial public offering prices. EV maker Fisker Inc. (FSR) had its IPO in October.GM in November announced a renewed push on EVs, and Ford Motor Co. (F) also has plans to add more EVs to its lineup."
When it falls below 805 this week. Wasn’t worry. But now and just wait for the earnings report to collect my gains. TSLA never fails in every earnings report. It will go up to 900.
So Elon met production/delivery plan that he made made how mutch .. 6 years ago ? .. During worst pandemic year ... while other competition is fighting to stay alive ... still goving exponentially quarter to quarter ... year to year ...Now we will see alot of shorts telling us how it will definittely go to zero next quarter :DJust relax the ride is not over at all and i bet 700 will feel cheap in january 2022.
Model Y sold out in China
"Elon is such a generous guy and here’s why; Elon diluted Tesla stock by selling 7.something million shares for $5billion for Tesla to use. Right?Elon as of late August owned 34 million shares of the stock, a stake equal to about 18% of the company, which is valued $68 billion.At that rate Elon forfeited 0.8% of his shares and as the biggest shareholder he personally lost $544million in order to rapidly expand Tesla. And help us investors out.Say what you want about the guy, he is a legend. Good luck and stay long!"
This will shrug off the earnings miss as only Tesla can do
At this rate TSLA will be worth more than rest of Nasdaq top 100 companies. :-)They lost market share in Europe in 2020 to VW.Chinese govt might control NIO and that won't be good for TSLA.Free subsidies will stop in US with states reeling under budget crisis including CA.But millenials think the whole world will only dirve TSLA by 2030.
Tsla is trading like a boomer these days. Hype is over.
"Tesla analyst more than doubles stock price target to $1,036"
euphoria is not a good sign on the stock market. I've often made the mistake and afterwards I was punished. In the end you sit on losses and still hold onto the share because someone said something positive (Morgan Stanley) and you don't want reality to come true. be careful. i know the longies hate me
"Such an overvalued car company, they sell cars that have to be subsidized by the Gov lol"
"So for every share you buy for $844 Tesla makes $29 in revenue, and 2% of that is profit, seems like a real good deal"
"Blessings in disguise, if you believe in 1000 thesis you might believe in higher price 1000+... Why? They let new short position in 400 to 200 ... reminds me of $tsla short squeeze cycle"
I’m holding! Or dying by the sword  Teslarites unite 
I’ve watched this TSLA go up on upgrades for the last year. They produce less than 1% of the cars built but the company is worth as much as all car companies in the world combined. Can stocks just go up on upgrades?
"For those trapped on the bubble, do not lose hope. Bankruptcy will set you free."
ARE YOU SHORTS still dreaming to see the $400s again? 
"Honestly, EPS don’t mean anything, those numbers can be manipulated in so many ways. A growing company will always be spending more to ramp up facilities for expansion and many times the cash outlay is more because expansion is faster than anticipated.Need to look at sales, the forecast, the pipeline and the competition. This company is far ahead of the competition. Looked at the Ford EV, it was a dog. Porches EV doesn’t have the battery life and is $40k more. A Tesla with FSD will only get better"
"Guys, guys, this dip is going to be so big that Greta will be able to grow infinite forests in it with which you can charge even your Tesla lawnmower...Photosynthesis chain reaction! Buy the dip and you increase Greta's forest by the amount of money you put in in square meters. Elon Musk gives the same donation. The project is called Garden Eve."

"I just wonder how the market makers can pull it out yesterday to provide S&P demand to buy 130 million shares of TSLA. Every body knows that if they sit on the stock, S&P has to pay higher price to satisfy the supplier. I guess the market makers may have to guarantee the absolute price for the big funds who has TSLA stock, and has to manage the call options. Any way I have to give the market makers a big hand that can make it happen. By logic and common sense, on Monday, TSLA will go up because there are 130 million shares wipe out from the trading market. When the supply is short, the price has to go up. So I will keep my shares. Any time TSLA stock going down, I will add little by little, because TSLA stock should go up when it reports the earnings."
Sify Tech Cloud computing for his Excellence Musk (SiFi) all upside from here---
analysts are not responsible for their assessments. they only drag people into a delusion who have no idea about stock valuations. they only help to improve their own margins. why do we only see insider sales? definitely not because the share is so cheap.
The lack of batteries is what Elon says why they are not building more models like vans and why the Simi is just starting to ram up. My question is where are all the other companies just starting to surface going to buy batteries for there production line.???
why did powell have to talk today of all days.

It's very bad to recall so many cars.

Tesla stock is actually just waiting for the market and by the market to get slaughtered !!
it is normal to show some corrections once in awhile before this takes off to 1000. Ive learnt my lesson the hard way 3 times. 
"With Panasonic agreeing to build TESLA's 4680 cells, we may well see a million tesla cars built in 2021. Consider this. Tesla was already building these cells in Fremont, yet Elon seemed frustrated that they couldn't scale it fast enough. Now Panasonic comes in and says ""bro, we got this, you won't have to go it alone with the new battery"". I have a feeling Panasonic knows a secret that they are not sharing with Elon on mass producing the 4680 cell. After all, Panasonic is a mass battery expert. So Panasonic will have Elon and Tesla on the hook for awhile."
TSLA creating giga factory in india soon. Decades ahead of competitors in innovation. Shorts will lose all of their money. $900 by Wednesday.

"Take profits and run. Wait until after 21 December and see if you can buy at a lower level, appr. 350$ or 290$"
"I had 43 shares of Tesla at one point and sold at $643. Hoping for a dip that would allow me to buy 44 shares... But it took off. That is a sad feeling. Fortunately I invested in one of the Chinese EV brands. Now I am the proud owner of 47 shares.This stock has its bad days, but when it takes off... You only see its tail lights getting smaller and smaller. And you are left eating the dust. Not a good idea to bet against Tesla."
"NIO down, Tesla to go. Look out Elon Musk, $PLUG is coming for you.."
"Chamath Palihapitiya on CNBC says ""Every Hedge Fund was wrong on Tesla"""
As the dollar loses value. Tesla will trend downward
Phew that was close. Tesla always increase when they don’t make a profit. Green pastures ahead.
"hey shorties, we long term investors have index funds too... let's go for a good close for the day to contribute positively to S&P today."
Triple current price in next 3 months and be the biggest company by market cap. Not because how many cars it sells but because the dream it weaves for everyone. There will be no Earth without Tesla.
cannot wait for the potential of record setting qtr on Janu 27. it will be grand!
"50% drop coming, investors expect too much from tesla"
"For 2020, Tesla Inc. posted its first full-year profit of $721 million compares with an $862 million loss in 2019.Sales of $31.5 billion compares with $24.6 billion in 2019. The company topped Wall Street's sales expectation of about #31.1 billion.The company's cash holdings totaled around $19.4 billion as of year-end 2020, up from around $6.3 billion end of 2019."
Move to Texas should have been your first clue.
Free money just keep holding
Tesla will be back to 880 till the end of the day
Buy on the dips... even one share will make you 600 in 3-6 months
"Tesla has been reporting that vehicle deliveries approached 500,000 units in 2020 and said that this figure could double in 2021. Fourth-quarter sales are expected to rise 38% year over year. For more hot stocks like (TSLA) just go to (http://trade-view.com)."
"Bear case is rearing its head. Notice that the stock is not reaching new heights and is trending sideways. If earnings miss by even a hair, this will signal a bearish downturn that no bulls can stop. The valuation issue will get a spotlight and the big guys might trim their tsla holdings."
in order to met their production goals of 500k cars this year they have to increase the production by 28% in this quarter compared to the last quarter. They are so desperate that now they offer one year free charging to sell more cars. This loweres the profit. They will fail the expectations next quarter. sad for you longs
PSA: endorsing BTC is the same as going against the deep state. be careful if you are long...
brought 12 more shares at 784.30.buy on dips folks. This downturn in market is temporary.
"Ina short term, TSLA may have encountered a steel ceiling around here. GM and F are playing catch up; they will be another force with strong tech power in making cars to compete with TSLA. In the next two years who knows which shall do better. Looks like GM can move over $60 and F over $13 next week or so. The following news about sharp drop of COVID hospitalization can add to the fire.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/u-s-sees-record-single-day-drop-in-covid-hospitalizations"
I honestly don't think tesla can recover from this awful miss.

"Investor's Business Daily is a reliable resource for market news and analysis of stock charts. IBD says that Tesla has just experienced a climax run. In trading just last week alone the stock is up 25% or $175. In the last 4 weeks it's up from about $600 to $880. Yes, by definition that's a climax run, which is doomed to correct substantially. It's not just the chart; competition is and will be continue to be a major headwind . There are a lot of EV players in China, and then you have VW and other US car companies. There's absolutely no barrier to entry in this space. Tesla sells low margin cars, and their profit is based on regulatory credits. A correction to $650-$675 may be reasonable for starters."
Not just a car company. They also lose money on Solar panels 
Stock split expected?
"Tesla going over $1000 soon, just like before the 5 to 1 split last year. Elon will need to do another 5 to 1."
anybody think TSLA will do another stock split soon?
I almost feel sorry for the Tesla stock fraud victims. Almost.
"On Twitter Musk wrote, ""u can't sell houses u don't own u can't sell cars u don't own but u *can* sell stock u dont own? this is #$%$ -- shorting is a scam..."""
It looks like the busted hedge funds are selling TSLA to cover their losses in GME.
"Tesla Bulls Watch Out - BYD Is Coming!Tesla's outperformance has left most people in tears, either of joy or despair. I belong to the latter, having shorted a share that has been one of the best performers this century.I will spare readers my continued bewilderment on Tesla's valuation, particularly due to the extent profits rely on regulatory credits that will soon diminish materially (my article here), and yet investors continue to bid the share upwards.Mr Market can be very stern to those that don't listen, (as I have learnt) so it's always wise to check one's assumptions.This article focuses on a valuation comparison between Tesla and BYD a Chinese NEV (New Electric Vehicle)Tesla has outperformance has left most people in tears, either of joy or despair. I belong to the latter, having shorted a share that has been one of the best performers in this century.Tesla Inc. is coming to the end of its first year selling China-made cars with a commanding position in the world’s biggest electric-vehicle market, but Elon Musk shouldn’t rest on his laurels.While Tesla regularly topped monthly premium EV sales tallies this year, helped by the sedans churned out from its multibillion-dollar plant opened to much fanfare in Shanghai last December, 2020 was also marked by rivals catching up. In 2021, the breadth of the competitive attack that Tesla faces will be greater than ever.Whether Tesla can defend its lead in China will be key to its wider growth and earnings trajectory. While still in its infancy, China’s electric-car market dwarfs that of other countries and the government is intent on further expansion amid commitments to reduce fossil-fuel use. Tesla’s fate in China will also show whether it can grow into a truly global carmaker, an ambition investors are banking on after pushing the company’s shares up almost 700% this year.Chinese automakers are notorious for building copycat cars that look just like the real thing but deliver underwhelming performance and quality.

Super high expectations on Q4 and the opposite force super confident short entry for many. This week might be a lot of seasaw action here. Day traders fan have fun. I think investors are also starting to realize that global recovery will take more time after vaccines rollout than previously anticipated. I seriously think bond yields have seen a bottom which would translate too equities reaching a top. Interesting time ahead. I'm all short in Tesla.
thank goodness the week is over.. see ya'll next Tuesday... best of luck and hope you have a better weekend than today...
"wow, half of their profit was selling environmental credits Total scam"
"Tesla is potentially looking at a death spiral. Bloated, overvalued to the Nth degree!"
"Some smart but foolish investors can't get past that TSLA trades at 175x 2021 EPS. Intellectually, they know a stock is the present value of future cash flow. They know they compare TSLA's P/E to forward growth. They refuse to believe a car company can trade at 175x EPS. Their objection: soon every auto brand - Porsche, Mustang, and Corvette will have an EV and TSLA's EV share will drop. They miss that TSLA has a 10 yr head start and TAM keeps expanding as TSLA enters new segments and markets. They miss that TSLA is much more than an EV company. And so, TSLA remains unloved and incredibly cheap!"
"Hurry up and get your cheap shares before TSLA joins the S&P. Once joined, it’s an instant price jump due to ETF and index funds."
I love Elon and Tesla but what justifies this price?
it's not going to burst.there is a huge shift and economic reset happening right in front of our eyes.2020 really threw the global economy into a twistplease wake up. tesla isn't going anywhere but up
It will open red on Monday and revert to the mean next week. It has a long way to go...down hill sledding from here.
market gonna crash like 1929 TSLA will be heading for 400. Sell now buy back later
Tesla earns its money mainly by selling emission rights to peers who do not yet meet emissions standards in regions such as Europe and California. I would really like to know if Tesla can make a profit by selling its cars. Especially now that there are also price cuts in 2021. Is Tesla a profitable company?

"There def are some very similar comparisons to the late 90s early 2000's with the tech bubble. New technology with the internet. People veiwing computer stocks differently because it was a new era. Things got way ahead of themselves and crash. Sure Amazon and a few others came out on the other side but not after a big fall. History always repeats itself. Always. Humans never learn. Is this exactly the same. Maybe. New tech new era in cars, electric, etc. Stocks getting way ahead of themselves. Bubble. Probably. Bubble isn't bad unless you are stuck in it when it bursts. And the horror show happens when people buy the ""dip"" when the knfie is falling not realizing the bubble has burst making the horror show 10 times worse. Im treading lightly. Investing a little. Not betting the house, the car, or even the dog on it at the moment."

I hope that I am not only one to keep buying TSLA. It is hard to believe that TSLA is down today. I believe that TSLA will blow up the estimates through the roof at the end of the month. I can not resist to buy TSLA when it is down like today.
you will be sorry if you sell your shares out of fear......watch and regret
no work required. Just buy some shares and relax.
The slow slow slow slide down... wall street getting back their investment in TSLA... they have a ways to go....

"Going low while trade volumes are below average... My take on it:No big funds are obliged to buy anymore due to S&P inclusion, they have their stocks and aren't eager to buy any more at these crazy prices. For sure they have analysts in their pockets to pump the stock and give sky-high targets. They were forced to buy in at an overvaluated stock and then tried to convince the average john doe to do the same by setting these targets. 'cause if it would drop, their losses would be huge!"

"Cmon Elon Musk twitter something positive about $GME and roast that shortys, Ill buy $TSLA shares from that gains ;D"
smart money moving to $F and $GM also $LIT
Major tax selling this week to pay cap gain tax in 2022...also last weeks push was window dressing for fund managers to get TSLA into their portfolios before year end...there will be pain this week on top of the fact of botched vaccine rollout and Jan 5th senate runoff which dems are currently leading in both and Wall Street completely did not think that could happen...
Who Remembers back in the summer of 2019 nobody had confidence in Tesla and said. It will go back down to under 50. Except for that 1 lady From ARK Invesmebts. She said Tesla over 4000 in the next two years and she was spot on ! While all those other analysts lost all. credit￼
what's wrong with Tesla?
Today’s LI buying blocks are the largest I’ve seen in two months $LI $XPEV $NIO $TSLA
I have a feeling this week will be red for Tesla. Too many bug automakers are on the EV track competing with Tesla. Its not as novel as it was when it was the only EV player.
Cant wait for another couple EPS miss and pants will be flying off along with the shirts this quarter! Hah!!
Just hold guys!!!!!

Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch has raised his target price on Tesla to $1036.00.

"Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess this week used his first tweet to troll rival chief executive Elon Musk, who has a massive following on the site. ""I'm here to make an impact with @VWGroup, especially on political issues,"" wrote Diess on Wednesday. He added: ""And, of course, to get some of your market shares, @elonmusk - after all, our ID.3 and e-tron have won the first markets in Europe. Looking forward to productive discussions!"" —Herbert Diess (@Herbert_Diess) January 20, 2021haha"
"Elon musk dual faceHe oppose Shorting stock but he short his own $TSLA Tesla stock by taking loan against that. in 2019 company got closer to bankruptcy but not because he can't sell tesla stock for funding but because of his loan can cause fire sell of Tesla stock and can wipe out $35B of company in minutes then (If he go for funding to save company it would sure caused that)I bet he come bagging those in establishment to save him ( He would not just lose money but gone in jail for $420 tweet as establishment has to show they care). Establishment come up huge plan to make Tesla stock 30 bagger in no time that no one else even think about. I really think he don't care about being richest man because he know it's all due to extreme criminal activity that we will never know about unless their plan end in disaster.His last tweet about $Bitcoin, Why in world person whose mission to save planet from carbon foot print, take all carbon footprint save (I hardly think EV save much if any but that's my personal opinion so not subject to discuss) from 2 decade of tesla operation and wipeout with one tweet.Bitcoin jump 10%+ on tweet, which mean more mining ring will come to life and consume bigger electricity and forced all Electric company to fire their coal plant even at greater speed (Only oil/coal plant, you can control how much electricity generate based on need, Hydro you can but it could cause risk of overflow and side effect of it) So every dollar biThis dual face must exposed. Anyone think Elon Musk Game Stonk tweet is nothing but part of their big criminal plan must work to exposed. I will sure stop if he put atleast $1B of his infinite wealth though worthless $TSLA stock to help bailout all retail investor here and while his Tesla stock is going to drop eventually I will not touch for respect to stand up. Until he take that action either because he is truely supporting retail investor or because he forced to, I will keep tweeting. Later is only likely if people who blindly following also think he should bail out retail investor for level playing field."
"TSLA short here, I’ve been shorting Tesla for 5 years now and this is going down big after earnings trust me.. I’ve only lost all my money, my family, my cars, and now work at McDonald’s and live in my mom’s basement"
PE of 1616. 800 billion market cap!! hilarious!!
"I won’t be able to sleep tonight TSLA going to 50,00000 tomorrow"
"I'd love to see the TSLA shorts explain to me how my entire 924 percent gain since March is going to go up in smoke when the company has no real competition and its electric cars are superior to all others. The regular car companies are miles behind and will need a miracle to catch up. Not to mention Jim Chanos, the biggest short of them all, capitulated earlier this year. That means all the little shorts are like ships without rudders. Shorting TSLA is like allowing yourself to get sucked through a jet engine expecting to come out the other side in one piece. Very unlikely things will go your way. 900 is coming soon. 1000 not far behind."

History shows that stocks ramp up going into the S&P and quickly reverse afterwards. Stocks rated outperform change to underperform and vice versa going into and out of the index. The S &P has historically been buy high and sell low.
No money left to buy this stock anymore. Rich are deciding when to pull trigger?
It’s on now! Full quarter of China produced model y sold out in hours.
Michael burry was right as usual - TSLA back to $100 where it belongs
"I hope everyone got on board. As I told you yesterday, once break through 750 , 800 will come quick!"
"Shorts, do you job! I want to pick up more shares at $700 to $500 level... spread some gloom and doom so at least it will go down for a short time!"
Do not trade it. Own it. I said that three years ago
If tsla does grow into this valuation it will be 10 years after Musk has left the company....if Musk leaves do you still value TSLA the same?
"After years of planning, China now dominates the world’s production of new generation batteries that are used in electric vehicles and most portable consumer electronics such as cell phones and laptops. As the demand for electric vehicles grows, it is expected that most of them will be built with Chinese batteries, and most of those batteries will be lithium ion, which are also popular for cellphones and laptops because of their high energy per unit mass relative to other electrical energy storage systems. For the foreseeable future, the United States will be dependent on Chinese supply chains to produce the batteries that power America’s technologies. That will be particularly true if Joe Biden is able to implement his “clean energy” and climate plans that will transform our energy system, creating an even bigger role for batteries.In 2019, Chinese chemical companies accounted for 80 percent of the world’s total output of raw materials for advanced batteries. China controls the processing of pretty much all the critical minerals–rare earth, lithium, cobalt, and graphite."
"""It [NHTSA] noted nine prior recalls by other automakers for similar problems."" Source: Globe and MailIt's not limited to Tesla, and as a percentage, legacy automakers have FAR worse recall records."
"Long term investors, we are now approaching the earning announcement. Well lately there has been a lot of noises on this board, let’s focus on a couple facts which I think will position the stock for a break out for the next couple of weeks. First, the screen recall is overplayed by the shorts yesterday. Tesla revealed that the recall will take approximately $200+- and 0.5 hour of labor, which will cap the recall to around $50 million, a much better estimate in impacts than what we have heard on the board here yesterday. And that is the worst case scenario. The delivery number announced over the new year is a all time high, and I fully expect a record smashing quarter and year. And if that is not bullish indicator, I don’t know what is. Let’s enjoy the ride up!"
"Best thing you can take out of a day like today, go on the message board and mute the shorts"
"Institutions selling Musk shares because he supports retail investors and the big short squeeze.Musk won’t care, he’s his own man!"

"I honestly don't care if the gamblers went long on TSLA and lost money.TSLA is doing just fine. The share price is allowed to go down sometimes. AAPL is down 2+ percent today as well, off their best earnings report ever beating all estimates. Do you think that means that there's something wrong with Apple as a company? It's a market, people front-ran the trade, it happens."
Will be buying more in the coming days
Oh and for those who complain about sitting at a super charger I pull in I go to the rest stop use the men’s room get a drink and I’m on my way it’s that simple I guess since my charge is free I could consider my snacks were free and I’d pay my electric but I like that I think I’ll buy more Tesla stock
America is falling. Tesla will fall with it... just going to take time. China will come out on top.

"This is much greater than the 2000 dotcom bubble. A lot of people will be crying when this is over. Guaranteed. I would still not recommend shorting TSLA because you never know when and at what level the bubble will implode, you just know it will happen."
I was expecting about $700 after earning but I guess it will be around $800 after earning.

"London (CNN Business)Battery electric vehicles accounted for more than half of all cars sold in Norway last year, putting the country way out in front in efforts to kill off the internal combustion engine. And Tesla (TSLA) lost its sales crown to the Volkswagen Group.Norway is using huge tax incentives to help ensure that every new passenger car and van sold in the country by the end of 2025 is a zero-emission vehicle. Record electric vehicle sales in 2020 means the country is now ahead of schedule, according to Oyvind Solberg Thorsen, CEO of the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV).The market share of electric cars in Norway increased to 54% in 2020 from 42% the previous year, according to data published by OFV on Tuesday. When hybrid vehicles are included, the share of electrified vehicles hit 83% last year."

"The Tesla shares I sold last week for $778 per share were added to my portfolio in October 2019 at $45.80 per share, adjusted for the 5-for-1 stock split of August 2020. That's a return of $1,600%. Want more picks before they run. Check out (http://tradingstrategys.com)."
anytime tesla adds 3% or more remember they're adding more in market cap than they do in sales. also remember this most autos trade at less than 1x sales. so just a little perspective.

"Spak admits that now that Tesla stock has run up nearly seven times in price, its new price is likely to be something of a ""self-fulfilling"" prophecy, giving Tesla the financial firepower to essentially buy for itself the valuation it thinks it deserves.How does that work?""Our biggest miss was how TSLA can take advantage of its stock price to raise capital inexpensively and fund capacity outlays and growth,"" explains Spak. With Tesla's current elevated stock price, the company is able to both avoid taking on debt and still raise massive amounts of cash through minimal stock issuances that don't dilute existing shareholders much at all.Tesla can then take that cash and invest it in buying up competitors and new technology, and in ""capacity additions"" (i.e. new factories), enabling it to rapidly expand production and produce more cars (and thus collect more revenue)"

"While Tesla's 499,550 vehicle deliveries technically fall just shy of its 500,000 target, they are close enough to highlight Tesla's staggering growth and to suggest that the electric car maker was able to achieve some of the improvements in logistics and delivery efficiency at higher volumes that it was aiming for."

RMO is a buy--growth in the big rig battery sector----buy RMO today.
It meets its target but I’m disappointed a little. I was expecting a few more cars delivered. No surprise the stock will head down on Monday but I’ll never sell them. $800 in 2 months. Go TSLA
"After battery day, earnings, etc this stock corrects around 20%. A 20%drop is a coming!! SELL!!"
What’s going on after hour?
"Sounds like I should place a stop loss for TSLA stock in case this ""climax run"" makes a 50%+ pull back. How low can TSLA stock go really?"
$1000 if earnings beat. $TSLA has these 21-25 days running cycle which would push the sp well above $1000.
No problem. Musk has been very clear profits would be slim and donations to the enterprise continue to be accepted and appreciated.

Not feeling good about earnings or this would be getting some kind of lift."
What a bargain at 875. This is going to 950 after hour today. Earnings will beat all expectations. Why can’t people learn already. I am holding mine until 1000.

"Seeing a lil bashing here means good news, the existence of short sellers which implies free cash inflow into the TSLA stock cuz it’s literally going to be covered lol."
If Tesla was a simple EV company I would have already sold all my shares at this price.
"TSLA had two investor, Daimler and Toyota, this was when TSLA was struggling. Both of these companies had access to TSLA technologies, but they just decided to cash out because they could not innovate at the speed of TSLA. these are two examples of companies who explored how EVs can fit in to their business and could have a 5 year early mover advantage but failed to capitalize. it is easy to call itself an EV maker, but much more difficult for legacy auto makers to embrace being an EV producer. all this is well documented on the internet, search for it if you like this sort of things."

"I have extended my short exposure MASSIVLY.The bubble actually stops and we will see abutting never seen at WALLSTREET.Tesla to Produce 800 million cars?PE is often used as a realistic barometer of a companies value. With an auto producer that PE could be extended to cars produced. For example, Toyota produced 8.8 million cars last year to achieve earnings. Their PE is 9.21. This indicates that Toyota needs to produce 8.8 million cars times 9.21 years of earnings to meet market cap. This total is 81,480,000 vehicles.Tesla produced 500,000 cars last year. Their PE is 1,628 and this is not a fully diluted PE. Multiply the two and the total is 814 million cars. Fully diluted and this number nears 900 million. There is not enough raw material capacity to achieve this in the next 10 years. World auto production in 2019 was 91,786,861. Tesla, at their present margin ratios which would include the sale of regulatory credits, would need to sell every car in the world for 10 years to have a PE similar to Toyota. The Tesla market cap is absurd at best. Buy it now and you will pay a hefty price in the next few years."

Can we buy 1/2 shares of Tesla I just got approved for a loan from money mart at 26% interest I am going all in

"How much of the current ""Covid Relief"" bill actually go to help Americans the bill's title claims to help? And how much goes tolib pork projects and foreihn contries?Lessee,...The $900 billion stimulus package COVID-19 ""relief"" bill is exactly what one would expect from a dysfunctional, tone-deaf Congress: a pork-filled cluster filled with anything and everything that has nothing to do with the coronavirus pandemic or relief. And in the swampiest thing ever, the bill, which is combined with a $1.4 trillion omnibus spending bill, is 5,593 pages long, or 5,583 pages too many, was given to lawmakers six hours before a vote to review what exactly is in it (hint: more pork than a Tyson Foods plant). It harkens back to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) once explaining that a bill needed to be passed in order to find out what was in it. In a related story, our government is broken. The topline from the bill says a mere $600 per adult and $600 per child goes to those eligible, which is half of what adults received in another relief package passed earlier this year (the per-child payment was $500). Not hard to see that this amount is hardly enough to keep those struggling from staying out of poverty. So where is the rest of the $1.4 trillion going? Glad you asked. Exhibit A: ""Of the funds appropriated under title III of the Act that are made available for assistance for Pakistan, not less than $15,000,000 shall be made available for democracy programs and not less than $10,000,000 shall be made available for gender programs."" Yep. $10 million. For gender programs. In Pakistan. Exhibit B: Funds for ""Resource Study of Springfield (Illinois) Race Riot."" That riot occurred in (checks notes) 1908. Exhibit C: ""Statement Of Policy Regarding The Succession Or Reincarnation Of The Dalai Lama."" We'll just leave that one there. Exhibit D: There's actually a commission tasked with educating “consumers about the dangers associated with using or storing portable fuel containers for flammable liquids near an open flame."" Exhibit E: Another $40 million will be allocated ""for the necessary expenses for the operation, maintenance and security"" of The Kennedy Center, which received $25 million in another COVID relief bill earlier this year. Also in a related story, the Kennedy Center has been closed. Exhibits F, G, H, I, J: $86 million for assistance to Cambodia; $130 million to Nepal, $135 million to Burma, $453 million to Ukraine, $700 million to Sudan. Exhibit K: The bill creates a Women's History Museum and an American Latino Museum as part of the Smithsonian. Overall, the Smithsonian gets (checks notes again) $1 billion. Yep, Americans don't get much.This should be called ""thedemocratsfreak and foregn nation relief bill""."
Definitely going to 700s. Look at technical charts. We have 4 or 5 days more of down coming. It could get ugly if the overall market slugs lower.
Don't bet against Elon Musk. In conventional terms the stock is over priced but Elon and all his companies under the Tesla banner are worth five times as much. Elon is just getting started.
"What's going on right now with GME, Citron, Elon Musk and Melvin Capitol is straight out from Billionare TV-show. I wonder if the hedge founds gonna retailiate on Tesla/Musk?"

900 today! Let’s go!! So glad I bought more last week.
"Tesla lovers, please buy more this stock now at $800 and support Musk."
Nobody with a solid argument has discussed the electrical grid. How will it handle 20-50 million cars charging up !?
didnt shorts lose like 33 billion dollars this past month? have fun.
Apple with deep pockets is coming out with EV in 2024 - Apple stock will double in price while Tesla will decline by 50%.
"Nissan are coming out with a new EV car in 2021, I will sell 1 tesla stock and buy 60 shares of Nissan"
Bad conference call. You longs need to listen to this catastrophe.

So Tesla goes to the Moon tomorrow?
"MAEK, Toyota will have a full EV Prius next year. It’s hybrid has been selling for 10 yrs. As for Tesla batteries, the buy them from Panasonic and one other manufacturer. Tesla has nothing proprietary in batteries . Like I said in a previous post, look ahead in 3-4 years when every car maker has. Line of EVs. Tesla will be $50-$60. Like the other car companies."
Buy Buy Buy this pre earnings dip 
That dingbat impeacher of non sitting presidents bought Tesla stock.
Good to see the TSLA stock turn around and have a nice uptrend move up. Avoid the noise. The price will increase.
this will be the only company to reach $2T valuation in the fastest time record.

What happen to stock price after earning
Elon's China plant still pumping out quality tesla's?
I don’t see Ford or GM as serious threats to Tesla. Too much old school practices over there.
every $1 movement cause a $1b change in valuation.
Wow! Tons of desperate shorts coming out of the woodwork today. I wonder why? Could it be that they’d finally like to cover and go shart somewhere else? Maybe try dragging down a different company? My advice is to stop shorting and go long. That way you can make money and support companies you like!
"GM, with millions of cars sold and a dominant auto position, has done poorly as a stock over the years. Its entry in the EV business will do nothing more than reduce its dominant position. The illusion is to think GM should be re-rated because it’s entering the EV business. TSLA is higher because Tesla is growing insanely and will be a dominant player in the new world order. It’s coming from nothing. But, GM’s total auto business and profits will SHRINK as it enters the EV fray. It is getting weaker. The loss in ICE sales/profits will NOT be made up with its EV sales. A company with declining overall sales/proftis and dominance will see a falling stock after the hoopla is over."
"2018 EV sales = 328,0002019 EV sales = 318,0002020 EV sales = 345,000 <<=== estimate by EV fan website Notes: 1.) The greenies initially rejected hybrid cars and refused to count them as EV sales. 2.) Eventually it became clear that the EV revolution had failed so now hybrids are included. 3.) Even with hybrid sales the number are tiny and stagnant."
"I like harmless but I fear Harris. Obama told Biden, you can be President for a few months but you have to give her Presidency at some point when I say so."
Analysts shouldn't have so much influence over a stock price. Analysts have been wrong so many times in the past that it's time we question their comments before reacting to it. It's not safe for the market to let these analysts have so much influence
Buy buy buy! This will skyrocket very soon! Elon has delivered 500k vehicles for 2020!
"660's look cheap now, soon 700's will look cheap. imho! trust no one! do own research!"
"Cathy Woods: ""He (Elon) is a provocative soul and he is brilliant! He's our renaissance man and what we should have done is keep our eye on the prize. We believe that Tesla will be in a poll position to dominate because of its advantages in artificial intelligence and the amount of data it has collected and the A.I. expertise that it has."" According to her, Tesla's battery technology was already three to four years 'ahead' of the competition. Tesla has 15 billion miles of real world driving data collected and the next closest is Google with 25 million."
I see this at 600$ on next friday. 900$ was the top.
Who else is loving this? I am
bought some more shares
My confidence is GONE in this stock. Not a stock for seniors!
Love to see a nice healthy pull back. Next is the typical consolidation phase and the next leg up.
"I can only laugh and smile looking at this whole situation going on ... because at the end I know the bounce back up is going to be unstoppable , don’t doubt telsa , those who did lost more than their mom and grandma can afford"
Comedy!!!
Tesla actually earn less than last quarter without help of selling regulatory credits....not a good sign ouch
Monday will hit 850
MOON
Any other company and this stock would be down $200 after hours.
"Some of you have absolutely no idea what will happen if there are no short-sellers left, in a downturn only thing acts as a brake is the short sellers covering, be careful what you wish for."
Let’s do it again. As long as I live I will never ever short Tesla again.
Thumbs up if you shorted this above $850. This was the best short I ever made. Thanks speculators to pay for my new house. Without you my new house would not have been possible. I can offer you some. Ramen and noodles for all these that went bankrupt speculating in this sham.
"Tesla (TSLA) is adept at proving the doubters wrong, but going against recent performance, in its latest quarterly statement, the EV pioneer fell short of expectations.If you’re looking for a watchlist covering the great stock setups every day before the open, I recommend https://daytrading.school/Daily-Trade-Setups They send daily set ups and its free. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"It's not about valuation, its about the con artist leading the ""little guy"" into believing in unicorns and rainbows."
Don't be a Zombie. TSLA is way overvalued.
Does not matter long term investor see TSLA is value investment option. IMO does not matter how the shorts draw the pictures the stock still in good stand today is a proof. 3 or 4% draw back is good. But long term this stock can be few thousand dollars/ share
"Cult if you think the air pocket today was bad enough, tomorrow it falls by $100.Ouch! That's gonna leave a mark."
"up $50 to $60 billion in a day. market cap exceeds entire industry. Yup totally reasonable, no risk here."

"Let’s go to $700+, great day today. Short term market response to sell of the news of Apple icar but the smart money knows Tesla is the gem! They buying the dip!!"
every time tesla goes up more than 3% now they are adding more in market cap then they do in annual revenue. it'd be like Ford adding 130 billion in market cap... please let that sink in. i understand they're not just a car company but until their financials resemble something else this company is wildly overvalued by even the most positive outlook.

Tesla's share of EV sales === Germany = 4% in 2020 = DOWN from 8% in 2019 France = 3% = DOWN from 10% Norway = 5% = DOWN from 20% Netherlands = 9% = DOWN from 45% Sweden = 4% = DOWN from 10% In 2019 over 83% of the electric cars sold in Europe were not Teslas.In 2020 over ~95% of the electric cars sold in Europe were not Teslas.Conclusions: 1.) There is a lot of competition in Europe. 2.) The European competition is winning and Tesla is losing.
"More revealing than analysts reports is what the corporate insiders are doing. They are consistently selling. While insider selling is indeed common among listed stocks, most companies don't have the unusual promise that the true believers see in Tesla. If the corporate insiders shared that vision they wouldn't be selling. Inside of selling stock acquired by option exercise, they could readily raise cash by depositing the shares with Interactive Brokers and pay less than 2% on the amounts borrowed. 5 years of borrowing would only cost 10% in total interest. Why do they dump the shares instead?The only answer is that insiders see Tesla stock as grossly overvalued, not just relative to current earnings but where the company will be years from now."
"Wow. I wokeup with good profits.This is just the beginning IMHONew era has begun, enjoy shorters.All who think that Tesla always fall on earning and want to wait like last few times, this time its very different"

"I admit to getting caught up in the FOMO thing, and thinking this might be a stock for making a quick 1-2k profit I could put to good use soon Moved in, out, in, out for a couple of days, between prices of 850 and 836. In between time, I did a lot of reading. Now I'm all out having lost just $168. Lesson learned. No regrets, even if it does hit 1000+. Too many things not making sense with this stock's meteoric rise, valuations, actual production, and competition ramping up."

Tim George, an attorney representing the subsidiary, said at the hearing that SpaceX plans to use the methane it extracts from the ground “in connection with their rocket facility operations.While it’s unclear what exactly the gas would be used for, SpaceX plans to utilize super-chilled liquid methane and liquid oxygen as fuel for its Raptor engines. The company’s Starship and Super Heavy vehicles are tested at Boca Chica, and orbital launches are planned for the site. ..."

Apple makes lots of profit but it's hard to find any new innovation or exactly what the money goes towards.

If this is the case, then we could see a cascading selling effect due to closing down open call positions. Anyone have any insight to this possibility?"

Tesla is an environmental movement phenomenon. Unlike other stocks Tesla has so many loyal investors that believe more than making a few bucks. These investors don’t tend to sell Tesla so easily when the market take a dip. They been thru so many up and down and still going strong. You won’t hear one complain or anyone regret buying. Only the sellers and the shorters are the ones regretting. Everyone that sell ended up buying back again at a higher price.

Imagine him using Ford plants/workforce to expand his own production of Vehicles. On top of that he is buying out a competitor, one less company to compete with. I think unless Tesla does something soon this great run is going to come to an end. We need another angle for growth here. The high end yuppy market is only going to take you so far."

"I do not want to go on a huge rant this is my opinion for any new investors that may not be able to take big losses, no matter how well this stock is run, or future potential if markets turn bad for hundreds of reason like interest rates spike due to money printing or US raises taxes to combat there spending that is out of control, or 30 year bond rises unexpected, all of these can cause a panick in markets and cause a major correction in all sectors, these markets are grossly over valuated and its due to history low interest rates, do your home work, learn about fundamentals learn charts etc and invest not just on hype because you can be trapped in a stock very fast"

"Tesla's full self-driving will never become a reality. Literally every other FSD innovator will tell you this and the world's best FSD AI engineers do not work at Tesla for this reason, they work at Waymo et al."
"As we await Earnings, just something to ponder. Earnings estimates for Tesla average 1.00, roughly 850 million. Volkswagen AG annual net income for 2019 was $14.948B, 15 to 20 times higher while being about 1/10 of Tesla's market cap. Might I also add that VW, as of the 4th quarter of 2020, is the world leader in electric vehicles sales. They are also not facing class action lawsuits for batteries and FSD."
Is that a double top rejection I see on Tesla? Go look at the chart. Projection $700.
One analyst who always predicted Tesla collapse lost his job after investors called the broker's house to complain. Now he got a new job. Ford car sales person. Interesting story in the Times
The shorts are trying to lose another billion. Lies won’t stop the Tesla mission.
"In my opinion, given the lesson that short sellers have suffered in small securities, they have realized that it is much safer to do it in large/huge companies, because in huge companies they cannot be squeezed as in GME and other small companies."
HOW TESLA FEELS AFTER BEATING STREET ESTIMATES AGAIN
What happened between 11:00 am and 11:15 today that made allStocks go down? Pretty strange
Make it back with Nio. Their sales numbers don't disappoint. Their earnings are homeruns.
Insider selling is alarmingly High with Corporate officers .
Even if earnings are in line . The problem is the Goal or forecast sales in 2021.I am sure for 1000 % that any number given by Tesla (optimistic not realistic number) willNOT be met in 2021 !!To convince yourself I invite everyone to check their sales in Europe f/ex which are on a real decline.Competition is massive in EV in 2021 and in the years to come.
"$TSLA Got PUMPED by 30% in the last 3 trading days FOR NO REASON! It added $200 Billion Out of thin air, which is 2 Boeing $BA Market Value, 8 Ford Market Value in just 3 trading days!"
Tesla. SP 1000x Earning (V) GM 8x Earnings & Ford 9.5x Earnings = Winner GM & F
"New Model S, 0-60 in less than 2 seconds, fastest car in the world. 10k price increase. Musk also considers it to be the best car in the world. Delivery in 2 weeks "
Bought a $850 call expiring this Friday 
Tesla shorts rn 
"What ultimately determines stock price is supply and demand, not fundamentals or technicals. If there are more buyers than sellers, price will go up. That is definitely what is going on here. P/E doesn't matter if people want to own this stock. I don't know how high this is going to go, and nobody else does either. I am considering placing a trailing stop maybe 100 points under the market, but I would be sick if I got whipped out. Crystal ball is not working."
1000 by earnings?
When this correct there is going to be a lot of blood on the street .Please be careful folks
I can already hear the roar of irrational investors approaching to buy more tsla
Honest question. Can anyone give an example of a higher priced company with as much competition as Tesla has right behind? The valuation is absurd. A bubble stock if I've ever seen one. Or am I not seeing some big picture?
"Elon is a cool guy so this should probably be the most valuable company on Earth, makes perfect sense."
GM is partnering with Honda and LG Chem to make electric vehicles and batteries. Honda and Toyota are making all-electric vehicles.
Down it goes in flame!!
mute people with different views and who might be saying things you are not willing accept or goes against a dogmatic approach to investing.....that makes a lot of sense @don (and others I'm sure). I have nothing against TSLA bulls...and really congratulations on an amazing run! bulls or bears.. history has shown that real wealth is usually build by approaching investment without being married to an idea and knowing when to exit and reinvest gains into further gains.
"This stock was $408 on November 16, today alone it gained another $50 Billion in valuation, andwhat profits do they have? There is something very strange going on here, there is definitely some hanky panky going on with options trading. SEC should look into this stock, and shame on all of the pumpers on TV. Rich W"
"Earnings are not that bad, but after digging deeper here is what I see:1. Production grew 30% Q3 to Q4, but automotive gross profit grew only 5%. Under normal conditions, it shall also grow 30%, even 30+% considering expected savings from scale.2. Message: we are ready to produce Semi, but we have battery shortage.3. Message: we are ready to license self driving to other companies.4. Other major manufacturers starting their own EVs - battery demand and therefore battery price will go up in time.As I see it, there is no significant growth for Tesla unless they actually start producing their own batteries. When this will happen, is still uncertain. To buy some time an keep company profitable in the meanwhile, tesla decided to license self driving.I do not judge decision to licence self driving, but valuation is too high under these circumstances. Simply too risky to stay... Good luck longs."
Tesla is the same bubble of Robin hood investors. Strong sell.
OVER VALUED BY 800 BILLION
BUY THE DIP BOYS AND GIRLS 1000 THIS WEEK
"If the PE goes back up to 1600, the pps will be 1280. New PE 1050 now at 80 cents ps."
Tesla soon to lose carbon credit cash flow - FCA merges this week with Peugeot... Forming Stellantis ... GM rolling out Ev’s. Ford up next... free government ride about over.
"Longs, It's obvious that the new share offering has created a over supply issue. Since the new share did not specify any date range, it is probably being sold to the market makers, brokerage, or other banks. I personally I am just letting this thing blow through, and hopefully they can blow through most of it today. Remember this is just $5 billion stock supply out of the $70 billion+ demand out there. Of course everyone has his/her plan, this is my plan. Good luck everyone."
ITS NOT POSSIBLE FOR TSLA TO GO DOWN. Simply not possible.
Invest in a company you believe in and HOLD...tesla will continu to fly 
News is out that the US Agency has closed investigation over unintended acceleration claims of Tesla cars and found no defects. I would think this would move the stock in an upward direction.
"I increased my long share position by about 8% after closing ($824). This is just a risk reducing move as I am net short. Buying shares actually increases the buying power in my margin account (go figure).The earnings report shows a growing gap between GAAP (real earnings) and reported earnings (phony baloney earnings). The phony baloney earnings were quite good, as I expected. Ignore the employee stock option expense and the earnings are almost $3 share for the year!Expect this difference to be even greater in common years. TSLA is making MUSK (and a few employees) rich.Short sellers do not hard the corporation. Nor do they harm long term investors. In fact they help long term investors by giving them lower cost entry points.But, they do impact employee stock based compensation of which Elon Musk is essentially the only beneficiary. So, it's not surprising that he hates shorts.Employee compensation expense is a real expense. That's why it's included in GAAP earnings. Ignore it at your peril.As large as the stated employee compensation cost, it actually greatly understates the value of the compensation to the employee. If Musk earns 3 tiers of his stock bonus, that means he as the right to buy about 30 million shares for just $70/share (or is it $40-you might want to check). With the stock trading over $800/share his option grant if currently exercised would provide an immediate paper profit over $20 billion, which dwarfs the amount reported as employee stock compensation expense.Unless there is a massive price correction, Musk is likely to earn nearly all of his stock option bonuses by the end of 2021 or early 2022.It's not a cash cost, so doesn't jeopardize the balance sheet (this is one excuse for ignoring it in reported earnings). But it is real."
This is a very bullish animal well done Elon | Check this report out >>https://chart-analysis.tools/TSLA
$800 today we will hit
so one person makes 20 profiles just to bash stocks. man i wish i had the time you guys have
huge miss
What time tesla would announced the earnings?
"Tesla is in green just because of emissions credits, not because of cars. And it has been like this for 5 quarters now.As other EVs manufacturers produce their cars they won't have anyone to sell emissions credits to.OVERVALUED!!!!"
I wonder who was the genius who bought this at $880.
"Hey Tesla shorters, you Po'"
go back to $660
"I only see three possibilities for the people who complain about Tesla:1) They are bearish and they are shorting.2) They wish they got in earlier and are hoping it goes down so they can buy at a lower price.3) They are whining about a stock that they have no position in, nor any intention to have a position.Which is it?"
"Do you really think it's going to drop next week, when the recent stimulus is nearly 2 trillion?"
Closing green today! Great stock!
advice please. i have 30 shares shorted. now should i cover or hold on?
Shorts
New Space fund coming from ARK! That's a chance to get in on one from inception.
"will it bounce back again? no problem, I will short it again"
Shorts getting burnt badly lol.
Repeat after me. I will never ever short Tesla again.
"I sold all my stocks today. The situation is definitely gonna be bad in 2021 for tesla. Audi, hyundai, kia, ford, rivian, nio, li auto, fisker, Mercedes, and bmw are releasing EV cars in 2021 or 2022 and they will definitely effect the tesla sales rate. Tesla rosed crazily because they were purely alone in the e.v market. But not in 2021."
Don’t forget about earnings in a week
"Buy the dip. Last chance for shorts to cover. Last chance for those outside to buy TSLA. The stock goes up because no one is selling.Will open at $1000 on Monday, then $2000 this month and $20,000 by April."
"Tesla bulls seems to be pricing that Tesla may do an acquisition with the major auto companies. And If that really happen, the stock will go hypersonic!"
Holding on for a long time and accumulate more and more!!! Not paying capital gains tax!!!!
Elon! just give QS what they want and free the people from oil!
I wonder what will happen to the stock price if the14 price cuts of their cars has an impact on margins?? Hmmm?
I may not have a Tesla car but i do have Tesla stocks!Great ending to 2020!!Long and strong!
The crazy part is the volume isn't even insane... it's just normal!
"Just became a Teslanaire.... Woot... Gotta love this company and Elon's vision... This is just the beginning, as this stock over the next 10 years is going to make a lot of people wealthy. Keep the faith folks, and hold strong..."
Does anyone know what strike price Nancy Pelosi has on her 3/18/21 expiration date of Options Calls for TSLA? Must be nice to be speaker and always pick winners
200 day moving average finally over $400/share. 50 day moving average at $690/share.
tesla has been a blessing for me and many. Comeon tesla to $800 so my other newly invested EV can get to $300 at minimum NIO!!! Tesla and Nio like Apple and Samsung
"TSLA TO THE MOON 1,000 STOCK PRICE COMING SOON"
"Normally when you ramp up production, margins increase. Tesla's margins actually decreased, probably because of all the vehicles that had to be repaired due to the poor build quality. Making more vehicles is not proving to be a profitable venture for Tesla. If not for $401MM in regulatory credit sales, they would have taken a loss on a GAAP basis."
Tesla full self driving is way better than I thought. Amazing 1200 mile round trip =. This car is 100% Amazing go buy one. .
"TSLA is going to change the world with those self-driving cars coming out within a year. For this reason, TSLA is a ""buy on dips"" stock. I hope everyone knows this.TSLA: $820.05b pre-market"
Plan to double down if this go 710. Already have 6 long $710 put expire next week. it's pure gamble given short term expiry.I might even naked short call expiring today and next week But given 500K madness by Elon fan club(Even it coming full 2 year late).
Not going to end well. Waiting for that first seller then it’s a race for the exits...
"Netherlands Q4 2019 = 29,922 Model 3s soldNetherlands Q4 2020 = 3,967 Model 3s sold <<<=== 86% decline, even though Tesla cut prices"

Is nobody talking about musk throwing around the idea of basically merging all 4 companies? Talk about this stock blowing up if you own it.
As someone who missed the boat and cannot ever invest in this i am jealous i have zero extra money!! congrats to all of you and wish you success all next year too! go elon!
bought shares before they split.... happy with the investment so far. tesla will soon reach 1000 dollars.......long on tesla.
In due time to come Elon Musk stock will be just as expensive as Berkshire Hathaway
"the jobless claim is skyrocketing, yet I wonder how people can buy this car so expensive. Furthermore with more jobless claim, premarket is up. Totally a joke of the century"
"Tesla is a good car. But now lots of competitions. Technically every EV is almost same. Others have 15 PE, Tesla has 1300 PE. Everyone says it is scary and rediculously priced now. Elon himself is sweating bullets on this valuation. I am shorting to the max and I will live with the consequence if moves higher. But myself and all the wallstreet analysts and Hedgfund guys says it is going to fall from the cliff very very soon. This is purely my opinion and my position on this stock. I am short on this. Mainly on valuation basis. This is unsustainable and insanity to the core. I just cannot be more explicit than this. Dont flame me. At market, we need shorts and longs. I am on the opposite side of longs."
"TSLA's trailing PE 1,320 - setting up for a huge decline! Any bad news on competition, margin, declining auto demand from peak levels could trigger this decline."
Nio will sell well in China but will never find a big market in the west. Tesla will sell well all over the world.
"I was considering a put at 640 as well, but the situation at the end of the day looked weird. It did not drop as hard as I expected and the last part of the inclusion by the indexes did not happen at the end of the day. Plus the official inclusion price was 695. Plus the price has been in the 660 region for quite some time now. Which is why I needed further confirmation to keep the put open."
Look at the 5 year chart bulls. Imagine when the curve bends and goes backwards through time with the help of the hyperloop and forms the infinite sign(for those who don't know what the symbol is ...it looks like a pretzel)!
The more new EVs and new EV manufacturers come the more less sales for Tesla. ;). Too many EVs everywhere nowadays and alot of new ones coming soon. By the way Tesla is far from Solid State batteries and the biggest game player on Solid state battery would be Quantumscape
Im gald the bubble has popped.
I feel great about earnings. Just added another 151 shares. Tomorrow and Thursday should be fun. I expect after hours uptick today.
"$STLA is well positioned to excel. They already have EV's and working on their own battery technology. They have a full range of cars from innexpensive to luxury and you can't replace that with poorly made $TSLA, $NIO or $XPEV. They also have the experience and infrastructure to scale up. That doesn't happen over night and $TSLA know that. Buy $STLA on the dip. It's a quick profit come monday."
How many companies have a year-over-year growth of 45.5% during the COVID like Tesla?
just bought 960 shares
"After getting in recently, I now feel better being out, and only having lost $168. But I have no ill will against the longs, and hope they make money."
Waymos self driving cars are dead in the water outside of their little geofenced are where every singe thing has been mapped. I’ll listen to their CEO’s criticism of Tesla after waymo cars can actually drive outside a tiny sandbox
This board is full of arm chair experts giving their predictions up or down and short sellers desperately trying to convince others to sell.I think what most don't understand is that Tesla Investors don't care about the minor ups and downs and are in it for the long term. I think one thing we can all agree upon is the fact that the S&P inclusion next month will be good for the stock price so the minor bumps until then mean nothing.
Elon trying to justify this overvalued stock by saying if Tesla can have a revenue of 60B at 20x PE and 2x margin this stock will be worth 1 trillion dollar. Tesla is at least 10 years away from that. Big drop to $200 coming.
10B quarter revenue. 800B market cap. ..... mirror mirror what do you see?
"Elon Musk said Tesla was overvalued at $1000 a share pre-split last year. Now it's over 4x that. I do believe Tesla makes just amazing cars, but this valuation is approaching insanity."
"Fellow Tezombies, I'm real excited to let you know that I'm now a Tezombie too! I've joined Robinhood this morning and bought my very first Tesla share ever!! I'm so excited!! I'm not sure if I'm going to sleep tonight cause I can't stop dreaming of making my very first $100+ tomorrow. That is more than I make a whole working day! YAAAAAAAY!"
Tesla pumpers when the stock starts going down.
Have a strange feeling that this with close around 900 today
"This: Does the competition want to see TSLA go down? No! The competition wants to see TSLA go higher than any other company in the world, because TSLA is causing a spurting of an unlimited amount of funding into the green space. TSLA is opening up great and fantastically beneficial opportunities, for startups, established companies, and all of mankind!"
"Nancy Pelosi and company should be locked up for insider trading ,they new about government contract, on its way to tesla.....This is why your government should not be aloud to trade stock............"
The shorts don’t realize what an incredible equity this is. This is a once in a lifetime type of security. Thank you Elon for giving us the opportunity to invest alongside you.
shorties - come out to playyyaaayyy
"I believe China will reconsider their love with Tesla. They have to protect their local car makers, like they are doing with IT companies now. Safety concerns is a good point to start with. More bad news from China are coming this year. It would be a hard blow for Tesla to shrink their most promising market."
Looks like $1000 by April. Risk free easy money.
"3.5 bil op cash last quarter. Should be 4 bil this quarter. Double that for Texas and Berlin. Should have an annualized op cash of 8 bil a quarter or 32 bil a year. Throw a 30 multiple on that and we get a 900 billion market cap or 1050 per share. Then when energy bus ramps via increased battery production, we double that op cash so 2100 stock by 2022-2023 timeframe."
"Tesla now charges $10mo for color maps. after your one year. This is the way of profit margin now. Charge for feature upgrades and charge as a subscription model. If you buy Model Y, you do not get Home Link, that is extra now too I heard."
Futures mean NOTHING. Watch the interest rate on the 10yr. The higher it rises above 1% the more of a headwind it becomes for high PE stocks aka BUBBLE STOCKS. You’ve been warned

is it true that the paid bashers minimum wage salary is based on the Chinese minimum wage of 15 yen an hour?
"IN 2021, $TSLA will lead the EV tech advancement and $NIO is aggressively working hard to follow. Crypto will slowly become an important digital currency and $SQ will grow with it. Afordable energy storage for microgrid will be provided by $EOSE and they will be the key for power grid electrification."
960 by end off next week earnings of course will be great but the comments from Elon will be what adds the rocket fuel.
https://finance.yahoo.com/m/95da7c5f-e96b-37b2-88e9-ca28310ad936/tesla-trading-at-650-gets.htmlReason could drop. They just want it down before added to SP500. Don’t let is happen.
a very serious question for Mr Musk.... the question is.... at what price target would the board of directors consider a stock split.... there are obvious reasons where a split would create a huge opportunity for the stock valuation... at $1000 a split of 10 for1 would put the stock at $100. The stock would appeal to a greater amount of investors and would keep the momentum at a sustained pace... never hurts to ask.. the seed has been planted...
Going to rocket up at EOD when indexers make final trades
I learned a couple days ago the fun happens in the after markets... this will be up another $10 when the markets close 
You got something to say shorts?
"the Bullish Report on Tesla, Inc. https://chart-analysis.tools/TSLA"
"It was announced today that the US gvt is going to switch it’s fleet of 640,000 vehicles completely over from ICE to EV, all made in American factories. I kind of feel like TSLA is the most well positioned of American companies to meet that demand."
$900 + after hours if Elon deliveries good news!!!
SHORTS SEE YOU AT A $1000.
"So if Elon is selling out his properties, cashing out billions and parking it in his accounts while his Company is still bleeding, what does it tell you? Elon said that his company was overvalued at the 200 dollars range after so many splits and the stock got propped up by Wall Street to over $600. What do you call it now? He has sold and packed his bank account with billions when we are facing a massive depression ."
Cliff James bought this stock today !!!!!!!
does anyone remember 2000 and 2008. you will soon be reminded
Shorts for the past literal 2 years been expecting the richest man on earths company to pull a bitcoin... this thing will go up to $50k a share before you shorts are too stubborn to realize you could just make money lol
"One of the challenges will be maintaining sales growth. Once people who want a Tesla already own one, it will be a while before they buy again. The used market will eventually be flooded with these. With phones they are cheap enough to upgrade every generation, not so with cars. Till then, ride the bull"
Warren Buffett just announced he bought 27b of tesla stock. CNBC
"Even the best growing companies miss on earnings at times, i.e. Amazon, Paypal, etc. etc. etc. No big deal. Strong buy TSLA on weakness because the weakness won't last."

Guys wait for surprises in few days !!
All other car companies is making EVs now and tesla is not even in top 5 in sold EVs in Europe.
Targeted with their first big class action lawsuit involving driver safety will teach Elon and Tesla what the auto industry is really like...
Tesla was a rocket the last minutes. wow
Teslas market cap is 40% of the next 10 automakers makers? Is that a bubble?
"I'm glad I only have 5 shares, good company but it's stock price is too high."
At what point does this bubble ever correct? 2000 PE? 4000+? This stock has single handedly defied everything I was ever taught about investing.
"Does anyone know if Elon Musk promised to ""produce"" 500K cars in 2020 or ""deliver"" 500K cars in 2020? The analyst are mixing these two numbers up to support these case whatever they are"
It wants to see 1000. The market wants it to happen. Not sure why anyone would sell. Why so sell when buy sounds so good
Hold it guys. The stock could triply by 2025. This year will be very exciting with the productions from giga Berlin and giga Texas.
"At some point, Tesla should sell enough cars to justify their valuation, plus profit from car sales. A very long way to go, or the valuation will drop to meet what they actually do:https://twitter.com/tweetmyinbox/status/1345771438603726848"
NIO is going strong. What happened to TSLA?
futures up looks like 850 open 
Wow 36% increase year over year during a pandemic? Only Musk can pull that off!
Up $30 pre-market!I warned the shorts to cover...this could be a $900 plus close today!
Curious ... why it went up after hours ? Thank you
ha ha we see the same movie again. On earnings day when Telsa was &1600 (pre-split) and on battery day.It will prove again a buying opportunity because the business is better than ever.
Expect a strong open and run to 830-840 before noon.
Tesla reached an all time high at 893.45
"First $1B quarterly profit? Would be cool to do, without ZEV credits."
"Even SONY is bringing out an electric car. Who is next, LULULEMON?"
$TSLA goin down like Kobe's chopper tomorrow
"I am moving from TSLA. All EVs are over valued now. Just buy fuel cell companies, which doesn't need electricity, but hydrogen.Every EV needs electricity, which is generated by coal, and bad for environment."
Storm the capital
The competition is heating up and TESLA will come back to Earth. What's up with those rocket launches anyway? That rocket fossil fuel don't seem to add up with Tesla's EV Vision?
Interesting that the higher this stock goes that the PUTS are also RISING in value  People are BUYING PUTS as the share price is rising  That is a clear indication that a lot of bets are being made that the share price is going to DROP
down in the morning means up all day
New report says that TESLA shares worth no more than $300.00 even they make all EV in the world alone . Looks like Elon Musk is making a lot of money without doing nothing
FYI: Tesla's stock is a prime example of a bubble: Research Affiliates' Rob Arnott.
"small sardines trade after hour with 1 or 2 shares,...not market forces"
Base of tesla has been strong around 650 to 660 . It will pop 10% soon and hold next new level.
TSLA short squeeze coming soon...!!!
"Don't miss out... we will have more fireworks next week to march up to $1,000. More upgrades expected, more stimulus, vaccines and everyone wanting a piece of TSLA pushing this higher next week. Going for 15 straight days next week. Wahooo."
Short cannot bring this down means when mr elon shares good news of semi production started we will be at 1k or more .
"Earnings on Wednesday. If they beat estimate, then we are in 1k territory."
"So, fully diluted GAAP earnings per share for 2020 is 60 cents. Gosh, the P/E (trailing) is now down to about 1400. Wow! What a bargain. I guess all those posters referring to P/E of 1700 are just going to have to eat crow."
Noticed ARK started buying again. Guessing they’re expecting big things for earnings...
Today Li is moving up without a volume spike which means people are simply buying. No selling interest. This is a BIG deal. It’s very different from the trading over the last few months. Now is the time to buy before it’s big leg up. $LI $NIO $XPEV $TSLA
Slight dip at open but will turn GREEN before days end!
"What’s gonna happen to all the ICE vehicles on the road, being manufactured now and those later? In the next decade as BEVs take over the ICE will be retired and recycled, sooner than later. Why? It’s already started. Cars normally have an average one decade life cycle. The ICEs ones are depreciating faster. “As a rule of thumb, in five years, cars lose 60% or more of their initial value.”As an aging car’s Actual Cash Value (ACV) declines the claims threshold of insurance companies of totaling the car is lower. Repair parts and labor for ICE vehicles are rising. Many used BEVs are holding their value much longer (Google it). Tesla’s warranty for its battery is 8 years. Replacing a ICE and/or motor and a ootransmission is expensive. With fewer moving parts, BEVs are expected to have much longer (and safer) lifespans. ICE vehicles Sales will accelerate as mass production of less expensive, cheaper to maintain and recharge BEVs emerge. Crushing 5 year old petrol powered vehicles will be common around the world. It won’t all be Tesla but a combination of other competitive brands."
"I hereby raise the price target on $Tesla to $1,367."
hahahahaha bye bye shorts :) $900 incoming !!!
Semi trucks coming late this year. Woohooo
why would anyone short tsla
Why is is jumping up after hours???
My advice to younger traders. Please never ever short Tesla stock.
I work at Tesla and we already know we beat numbers
Don’t for get X Company
The herd is jumping back and forth between the slot machines but there's already smoke in the basement. Who will make it out?
waiting to hear more about the EV subsidies and infrastructure plan. 2021 is going to be a good year just like 2020 minus other dramas and hopefully everyone stay safe.
Tesla is just beginning. It has years of growth ahead. Smart to buy and hold.
"I would feel much better paying $1,300 for a Tesla stock than $1,333 for an Ethereum coin.With Tesla you get 2 Giga factories that are up and runing, two+ yet to come... The possibility of owning a piece of XpaceX... And so much more.Etherum and other Crypto currencies just give you a piece of code?????I sleep well at night when I am invested in Tesla."
"Tesla posted pricing for the Chinese-made Model Y recently. It’s a little more affordable than some of the competition. That’s good news for Tesla bulls, but it could be bad news for the competition."
Michael Burry will win
i now understand why musk jumped on gme bandwagon..he knows he will need robinhood army to fend off the shorts
tech says it will never need replacement ever again in my lifetime. I'm 57.
Hey bag holders. This is not what selling looks like. I'll let you know when they start selling it.
TSLA exploded and I missed out because I wasn’t listening to the great folks over at (http://Stocks-tracker.com). The next big winner won’t miss me. Don’t let it miss you either. Join them now
Last chance to buy under $900. Will open over $900 on Monday! Don't sell a share! Make those Shorters pay.
What do you all think will happen with stock on the 27th? Up or Down??
This stock is Bull Hockey.
I have read a Holland tulips story which is very similar to TSLA.
BUY ALL DIPS
The earnings do not support this share price. And they will never support this share price. Period.
"Expect Tesla to deliver over 1 million vehicles in 2021.The Berlin Gig factory will be producing vehicles in 2021.Good luck and GOD bless,"
People need to understand that Tesla is the biggest producer of batteries and Giga Berlin will be the biggest battery factory in the world!Tesla most probably will even sell to the competition just like Samsung is selling screens to Apple.TSLA is way ahead of everyone in most aspects.Now lets be clear they have a lot of work ahead the factories need to be build they need to increase quality control greatly and the future looks bright
BIG GUYS ARE SELLING RIGHT NOW. WATCH THE VOLUME !!!
There has been some debate about what’s going to happen tomorrow with the options expiration. I’m pretty curious to see how it plays out. Not concerned either way as I know it’s heading up long term ... but may buy more if there are any opportunities because I think that will be last chance for a while.
buying more
I will never sell my shares. I believe in what Elon is doing. I will keep buying and buying.
TSLA is one of the highest risk stocks in the world. Completely overvalued by an extremely wide margin.
"Overvalued???? Amazon, Google, Chipotle, and Apple to name a few. These are not overvalued???"
COMPUTER Technology from NIO is 7 times better than TESLA William Li said today. He also mentioned that the horse power and driving distance is much more than TESLA.
"I find it most interesting that Rusch 1,036 and Ives 1,250 new targets for the first time have not pushed Tesla higher. Once upon a time in this fantasy world, there long term targets would be hit in weeks. In November Ives raised his base-case stock price target to $560 from $500. Best case, you all fooled him. So he more than doubled it. Basically, in two short months say Tesla is not a 560 billion dollar company but a 1.2 trillion dollar company. Yes 300 billion for the two existing and two to be built factories. Not enough cars built on the planet to support that number. And you know what, all of you bought it. So why aren't you buying it anymore?"
Volkswagen will sell more evs in 2021 than tesla.
ouch....tough start for us shorts....
"Buy puts now, next week Tesla will be down bigly "
"after nio day presentation, it seems nio will pass tsla soon."
"FSD will be huge for TSLA earnings once solidified as a product this year. When FSD exceeds regulators expectations, it will be implemented. This will be the innovation breakthrough of the decade. Tesla’s cars are already driving themselves and continue to improve. It will take some time for people to adjust to robo taxis, because humans are inherently resistant to too much change at once. It will soon be a lot cheaper to hail a Tesla that can ride you to your destination, than it is to own your own car. Especially in major cities."
seriously just buy before the earnings its free cash
No need to work anymore .Buy a few Tesla shares and every day you make 10% profit.
"Mercedes EQA, EQC, EQV, EQS, VW ID3, ID4, BMW i4, Audi etron, etron GT, and so on.... people like variety. Tesla is priced as if everyone will want to drive a Tesla. E"
"To be clear, Its ok for a congressional member of the democratic party to buy options/stock but not a republican senate member based on inside information"
"Keep an eye on the message board chatter from the Tesla cultists. It’ll start with, “This is a healthy correction.” And then, “The gap had to be filled before the next leg up to 1,000 a share.” Followed by, “This is a short attack, the stock is too cheap at 650, hang on to your shares.” Then, “I’m in it for the long term, thanks for the cheap shares at 500 shorts!” Next up, “Elon Musk just tweeted about opening Tesla stores on Mars! This should send the stock back up to 300 in a big hurry!” Coming up a few weeks later, “100 a share?!? This is absurd! The future Cybertruck spare parts business alone is worth that.” Until we get to the final post....”That’ll teach me to gamble on Robinhood. Now how am I going to pay my mom back?”"
"Tesla is set to join the S&P 500 prior to trading on Monday, Dec. 21, a move that pushed shares higher earlier this month since money managers with funds that track the S&P 500 will need to buy the stock for their portfolios. Want more picks before they run? Check out (http://trade-view.com)."
8.5x the market cap of the VW Group whilst producing 1/22 the number of vehicles. This bubble is about to pop.
Thank God I kept half of my Apple holdings because this stock now about to EXPLODE to the upside. If I had to bet between Apple and $TSLA then I’m going with Apple. They have far more money and resources than Tesla does. I know the Tesla fanboys won’t like hearing it but it’s the truth. See y’all in 2024 
Musk - India is a 4 trillion opportunity. Tesla won't be missing it.
How come the bears come out of their caves every weekend claiming a mass dip is coming? It will go to $1000 before any pull back. It’s extremely too hyped for that $1k milestone and people are staying in for that ride.
"EPS 0.8, expected was 1.03. Big miss. See you at 750 tomorrow."
"Lol. The comments on here are hilarious. What shorts don’t understand is that whether the stock goes up or down, the longs will still hold."
Major car manufacturers are going to Squash Tesla...
"GM revamps logo, to reflect move to EV future. GM down 0.60%. Had Tesla revamped it's logo, for any reason, perhaps to match Elon expanding waistline, TSLA would soar 15%."
"One can look at all the fundamentals and technical analysis of a stock. With TESLA, all one needs to see is this, Performance For the Year 2020 was +720.05%. Enough said, !"
"Brothers and sisters, help us at $GME , $AMC , $NAKD , $SNDL. they shut down fair trading and are trying to kill tesla too!"
I'm sure the Tesla is definitely $ 1200
"Is the entry of Tesla into India market just hype?Primary problem that Tesla could encounter in India is that, as of now, cars are not the most popular EVs in the country. At the end of FY 2020, there were only 3,400 4-wheeler EVs sold in India, while 150,000 electric two-wheelers were sold, as per CEF data."
Stock is worth $60. Most overvalued security in market history. And the cars are trash.
other car companies are not just gonna let tesla eat the whole pie
Big sell off in all EVs. TSLA good buy at 700. I see it there.
Tesla has a market cap of $800 billion +/-Facebook has a market cap of $700 billion +/-Facebook prints money by way of profitTesla makes cars and sells carbon credits.I guess it makes sense?$fb
"By next week after Biden take office, Tesla will be price $1300/ share it is highly possible will reach that number."

"Wedbush Securities said that the EV maker Tesla will top one million deliveries by 2022 and approach 5 million deliveries by 2030.

VOLUME WAS VERY LOW TODAY ...

"TSLA will prove to be the biggest Ponzi scheme in the history of the world (excluding the US Dollar of course!)TSLA's market cap now far exceeds the combined market caps of Toyota, GM, Ford, BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen, Nissan and Fiat-Chrysler by almost $100 billion. When this bubble bursts, it will produce one gigantic BANG heard around the world."
"Tesla will soar even more. Facecrook,twatter,and frapple money will move into Tesla. Very bullish!!!!!! Tesla will triple"
ME BUYING CHEAP SHARES
"Even if they meet the 500k cars (with some quality issues, but anyway), whats special with this? Daimler alone produces 10 times more cars. And that is a relativ small car maker."
"wake up to reality, this is a great company but priced very irrationally"
There were a LOT of people in here declaring today was going to be a bloodbath...for Tesla. Where are they?
"Although vehicles will remain in the spotlight in 2021 as Tesla continues its dominance, two things will propel this company much much higher:1. Megapacks being adopted more and more. Current demand is more than we can keep up with. 2. Starlink division being brought in under the Tesla umbrella."

"David Einhorn - Notorious Tesla short seller - just had his best quarter ever ???????Economist John Maynard Keynes famously said ""The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent,"" and Einhorn's performance in recent years highlight just how much of a toll a single short positioncan take on an entire portfolio when the stock in question gets caught in a potential market bubble. Short positions can result in unlimited theoretical losses, whereas standard long positions are capped at just 100%downside."

Dead money. For YEARS. Either that or a big correction.

Seems like Elon Musk is not concerned about Tesla’s current stock price. But he is promoting others like Bitcoin.
"One day every quarter Tesla is exposed to some reality. And it doesn't look good. Profits down due to lower margins due to increased competition. And this will play out every quarter going forward, until it becomes abundantly clear that Tesla is a money losing operation and will continue to burn cash for the rest of its' life. Also given the amount of cash on its books why is interest so low?"
5 words from musk and this will go up a 1000 a share in 1 hour..... we are doing cell phones.......
"I said this before and I'll say it again, every dollar TSLA rises, hundreds of thousands of forward thinking people all over the world are being enabled by entering or given a good go at entering richdom. We are watching history in the making, we are watching the world transform."
How much in regulatory emissions credits did they manage to sell this quarter??
"Idea - turn the electron microscope off and just look at the big picture. a.) Tesla can make about 7,000 cars a week (being generous), that's 91,000 per quarter. b.) Selling 91,000 Tesla cars is not profitable. In Q2 they sold 95,200 and lost $400 million. c.) Tesla is cutting prices (the reason doesn't matter much - lower prices means less revenue.) . IMO trying to estimate deliveries, inventories, shipments, and the ever elusive ""demand"" is entertaining but not very meaningful. A Q3 operating loss is hardwired in."
If only they could get the panel gap corrected. Everyone complains about that and it's easy to fix.
"Tom Snosnoff, creator of TastyTrade financial network, talks about momentum trading and bubbles. It is an interesting article. Search YouTube for ""Mo-mentum, Mo-Money, Mo-ral Hazard | Sosnoff & Ratigan Podcast""(I would embed the link, but Yahoo will block it.)"
"So, I am ready for all the hate I am about to get. But over 700% a year is not normal, and is not sustainable."
Is this the year for $90? I think so!!!
T-Minus 10 days until $TSLA Q4 earnings! 
Wall Street analysts can't have all the fun!!! hehehe. Retailers have all the Data they have!!!
"Imho $TSLA looks ready to rock again higher into 2021, have a good feeling 1B market cap level from 658B today could become reality if TSLA imperium will continue to grow worldwide (not only in EU/USA but with special focus on China/India coming months & years...) Lots of congrat$$ to Elon & all TSLA employees, keep up the good work, happy New Year!! GLTA"
The countdown to RED AH
Same old TSLA. Back to going up during trading hours and some more during AH. GO TSLA...!!!
950$ possible after earning report?
Let’s squeeze the remaining shorts! Rally coming soon!
"Can anyone point me to leaked videos of Tesla's Cyber Truck in it's testing trials? I would like to place a deposit to reserve one, but want to validate it is a viable product. I'm sure Tesla has dozens of pre-production prototypes, going through it's phases somewhere, since it is scheduled to be launched later this year. Tesla security has obviously been really good at keeping it under wraps, but I'm sure someone has video. I'm not talking about the first show truck, I'm talking about a production intent version. Musk said it would be just a little smaller, but otherwise indistinguishable from the show property. I'm so geeked!"
I wil wake up tomorrow and see 900 dollar in premarkt
reddit user's goal is to get tesla 5 fold upward movement. 4k/shr.
Next $tsla is either $gm or $f (or both) $gme
"I am so excited for exactly one week from now on the 27th when TSLA reports earnings. Get in now or you'll be left in the dust when we beat earnings and rocket up past $1,000!"
The robinhooders snored the dip like it was nothing!
Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world within 5 years.
someone paying 3814 dollars for Tesla....lol.....
The Reddit money is coming back to Tesla real soon.
Citron said that he is no longer going short and will not publish short report. Get burn for publishing fake report with no substance for nanox imaging. $tsla of imaging
"subsidiary Waymo announced in its blog that henceforth the company would address its mobility services as ""fully autonomous driving technology,"" and ditch the term ""self-driving.""What Happened: Starting with the fully-autonomous labeling, Waymo’s blog said that its technology is distinctly separate from the driver assistance systems of other automakers that require human intervention.While Waymo didn't name any automaker directly, it has contested the claims of Tesla Inc.'s (NASDAQ: TSLA) full self-driving being at par with its autonomous driving technology before. Waymo said that accurately wording the technology could also save lives. Of late, Tesla has been mired in safety-related controversies, which picked up much more steam after a fatal crash in South Korea led to two people being injured and one fatality.At the beginning of 2020, Tesla faced 14 scrutinies by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for accidents that involved its autopilot systems.Why Does It Matter: Waymo clarified that erroneously branding driver assists as fully autonomous sends a wrong message to auto buyers and enthusiasts. The post suggested that misleading impressions could inflate the ability of the vehicle and result in an unnecessary risk to drivers, passengers, and others on the road.""Unfortunately, we see that some automakers use the term 'self-driving' in an inaccurate way, giving consumers and the general public a false impression of the capabilities of driver assist (not fully autonomous) technology,"" Waymo said.""That false impression can lead someone to unknowingly take risks (like taking their hands off the steering wheel) that could jeopardize not only their own safety but the safety of people around them."""
NIO MENTIONED ON MAD MONEY JUST NOW WITH $GM AND $TSLA....WE ARE a PLAYER
"I saw someone give a small story. Here’s mine. Once upon a time I shorted Tesla and lost around $600.. then I decided stay long and made $8,000."
New strategy for Tesla.Buy $ millions of a particular cheap stock.Have Elon tweet it the next day. Sell for 100% profits.Rinse wash repeatThis should help increase their margins
"I love how the shorters keep on getting suckered into shorting with just a bit of bad news. Only to see an upgrade that raises the stock price. It's so awesome to see. They don't understand the power of Tesla, Elon, and the believers."
Tesla Made in America!
Just chilling waiting for 4Q earnings and $1250 Wedbush price target
Tesla had an incredible run. I remember October 2019 is a $255 before earnings blowout they never look back remember they had a five for one split. Pre-split tesla stock is over $4500. From 250. oct ￼￼￼ 2019
Another stock offering in the horizon
Earth is one big China. Take us to Mars Elon. Please.
"@ Fer_ociousOne word: Doge$1,000 made me over $5,500 since last night.It is crazy!!! Thanks Elon and Reddit!!"
I bought 60 shares @ $404 and holding till 2025. That is my plan.
"With the polar vortex invading the US, and the deep freeze cutting Tesla battery range by 50%, owners will give up and revert to ICE"
One Trillion Market Cap tomorrow!!!!
"LMAO, Tesla No longer #1 EV producer in the World. More entertaining, as Tesla Fan Boys await the 500,000 production goal, VW produced 52,000 in November. Without any increases that would project to 624,000 in 2021. 24% increase over Tesla if they meet their 2020 goal. An important thing is that if one would take a look at manufacturers, SAIC would actually be ahead of Tesla (54,960 vs 54,566), followed closely by the Volkswagen Group (over 52,000).https://insideevs.com/news/463741/global-plugin-car-sales-november-2020/"
It’s a Scorcher today shortards.
I almost sold some shares. GLad i resisted once again.
"No dealership networks, no middleman, that plays a giant role in future growth if Tesla. Antiquated ICE manufacturers are and will continue to be hindered by this, huge blow tgey didn't see coming."
"very true, TESLA did very well considering we had a global pandemic."
"$600 is the 1 year 50 daily moving average. This would be an healthy correction. A one day drop is not a correction, its just a warning."
go figure.... down 18 points is actually a sign of strength.
"It’s very limited downside. I really don’t understand the shorts. Most of the Erosion margin went to invest in improvement in technology and gaming of market share. This is going for market domination. Isn’t this the same playbook for Amazon? We have gone thru so much ups and downs last year, this is nothing!"
"People selling now will regret when it is above 100 this month, and above 1000 in 5 years. You will be saying the same thing $tsla investors saying right now. ""should hold it all the way 5-10 years ago, i will be millionaire by now"""
"after covid19 is over, there's going to be a huge recession. Property tax is going to increase x10. Tesla giga factory  going to layoff staff"

Investigators determined that the expected usage life rating for the 8GB eMMC NAND flash memory device is about 3,000 Program-Erase cycles, after which the eMMC NAND flash memory device would become fully consumed and no longer be operational. At a daily cycle usage rate of 1.4 per block, accumulation of 3,000 P/E cycles would take only 5 to 6 years, the agency said. Longterm tesla investor and very bullish"
Tesla sold 368k units in 2019 and got 150k call backs after one year. This stock have to correct 50%
The way Bidens America started and going what will happen to tesla stock and company? $300s tesla should be lucky if it dose not go under that in bidens United States of China lol. Alot of things looking alot worst so far and he's just 2 days in office. Next 4 years will be another historic worst that we will miss 2020 so badly . 2020 would look like a king to any of bidens next 3 and half years or so at least .
"Shares of the growth stock are likely trading higher due to a bullish day in the overall market and an analyst's note to investors saying that Tesla competitor and Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO's (NYSE: NIO) unveiling of its electric sedan didn't impress. Tesla stock's gain on Tuesday extends a recent bullish run, which cooled off on Monday when shares took a breather. NIO's new ET7, the company's first sedan model, is ""good but not enough to make any critical changes from Tesla's challenge,"" said Citi analyst Jeff Chung in a note to investors on Tuesday. - Motley Fool"
Thank goodness fir the credits we sold or we’d be 100 bucks
HAVE BEEN BUYING ALL DAY >>>>THIS IS THE COMPANY TO OWN FOR THE NEXT 10 YEARS>>>>STAY LONG
goodmorning culties dont cry today
QQQ up nearly 4 percent the last 2 days yet Tesla is seeming to drop. Not an investor or shorter of Tesla but rather an interested bystandard. I think earnings season will bring the major pedegree Tech stocks back to the limelight leaving less volume on the Tesla shares which I think will cause a downward streak and frighten Investors how might say let's go back to the Blue chips like Amazon Microsoft AMD and Apple
"Elon Musk on being told he's the richest man in the world: ""How strange. Well, back to work.""That's our guy right there!"
Ez green today as people realize how big influence Elon Musk has.

New Model S getting ready to ship looks amazing. I don't care what anyone says.
So what are all of you going to buy with all the money to be made in the coming weeks and of course a stock split? : )
650 bang!!!
Nio delivered 75000 vehicles. If you divide the market caps per produced vehicles. Nio trade at a 36% discount to Tesla.Nio announced a 150kWh battery. That's double than the Tesla. Solid state. Replaceable battery.It doesn't take a lot of imagination to see that the competition not only comes fast it will also surpass Tesla very soon.Go figure where Tesla's stock will go.
"Twelve EU countries are allowed to allocate billions to a research project into a new generation of batteries for electric cars. On Tuesday, the European Commission approved the state aid of 2.9 billion euros.The European Union wants to compete with China and other Asian countries, which largely control the battery and battery market. By 2025, the EU wants to have enough batteries of its own production and no longer buy them from the East.Businesses in Germany, France and ten other Member States can now claim government support to develop the battery of the future. BMW and Fiat, among others, would like to be eligible. The companies themselves are investing another 9 billion euros in the project.The European economy is facing enormous renewal, says European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager (Competition). That is why it is ""wise"" that governments and companies work together and share the risks. ""To help the industry develop more innovative and sustainable batteries."""
why is dow and nasdaq dropping? Any bad news?
as a tesla shareholder do you feel swindled??
Tesla was down in regular hours And also down in after-hours . This is just the beginning of the downtrend. It will go down to the 50-day moving average On a one month Chart .
"Tesla is not a car company. Don't count this quarter results. Tesla is an ""New Idea"" company. It will make money from ideas not from cars. Musk will make money not because of tesla's profits but profits from stock options."
Big investors are signing off. The market is going down.
"Amazing grace, how sweet it is... Let’s GO TESLA!!!!"
"Ok ok... people, just makes me angry that people are just pumping this for no reason HONESTLY! Even with all those potential tech in place, don’t you think this is just a little overpriced? Just a little? Like little? Very tiny? Makes me sick"
"As Ford, GM, BMW and other auto manufacturers ramp up EV's, they will NOT have to buy the ZEV credits from Tesla. Therefore, almost a billion per year will disappear for Tesla. On top of that, there are no tax credits for any of Tesla's vehicles anymore because of the numbers sold. Tesla hasn't earned a dime yet. They have billions in losses and would be totally unprofitable if it wasn't for the ZEV. They don't compete, they are subsidized.However, the stock is just an idea, like BTC. Shorting this is a Fools errand at this point."
Earning will smack the record who agrees . 2021 will be great year for tesla.
"TSLA's stock has been a life-changing investment for tens of millions of people worldwide, of all social status. It has been one of the greatest global wealth generators of all times."
Good luck for tomorrow everyone 
What is the reason for the jump today? Any news.
"Not fazed by this, TSLA doubters and the uncaring government are responsible for dragging down the entire S&P 500 today, remember this stock was just added less than a month ago and people are already doubting it. I see at least 1 Tesla everyday on my way home from work, this car is the future. Boomer retails stocks get their boost today, then its back to tech explosion, as soon as government stops sitting on their hands. Long TSLA, buy the dip"
"Chinese EV-maker $Nio Inc., for example, often called the biggest rival of industry frontrunner $tsla Inc. in that country, now commands a market capitalization greater than GM.Analysts now say that investors may have underestimated GM’s potential, including its joint ventures, battery technology and possible cost savings from a restructuring in North America.Boomberg"
C’mon in to enjoy the holiday ride into the $600 level folks!
"For all you ""value investors"", the pe will get at least a 50% haircut on Monday. The we can run it up again. New pps - $2000."
"I notice a lot of NIO graffitis on Tsla board here along with all other kinds of noise as to how Tsla/Tesla is going down, etc. I don't think any of the EV companies (especially Tesla or NIO) should worry about going down because the EV ecosystem is in the infancy stage, just getting started, and has an abundance of real estate to go about."
This going to 700 before 31. By mid Jan 800.
"There's reason to be positive on Tesla as a company, but not silly positive. With the current stock pricing, 1 Tesla = 23X Ford = 13X General Motors = 8X Volkswagen = 4X Toyota. Volkswagen and Toyota generate the most revenue of all automobile manufacturers. Ford and GM are among the top seven. Tesla is does not make the list of the top 20. Peugeot does.If we cut Tesla's stock price in half, it's still very optimistic. At $400/share, it would be 12X Ford = 6X General Motors = 4X Volkswagen = 2X Toyota. Toyota revenues and earnings are 10X that of Tesla. How long will it take for Tesla to catch up to Toyota and be worth even 1X as much?Another example... Tesla brings in 1/2 of the revenue and earnings of Peugeot. Peugeot's market cap is $23B. A fair valuation for Tesla would appear to be $12B, but OK let's give Tesla a higher valuation for being innovative and possibly opening up new markets... but this is speculative. What multiple of a fair valuation makes sense? Twice as much? Three times as much? Certainly not 80 times as much."
Will close at 888 today
This stock is headed past 1000. CCIV merger looks like it’s about to go through which will cause some extra hype in the ev market
I am a relatively new investor; but one thing I have learned is to buy the dip and hold on to a fundamentally good stock like TESLA!!!!!! hard. Do not listen to the negativity!!
Nasdaq shows as belowAfter-Hours High $690.00 (17:05:18)After-Hours Low $645.61 (16:12:46)
I don't think people relying on stimulus are worried about buying stocks... I keep seeing robinhooders and stimulus mentioned. Makes no sense.

No mote hydraulic lifters (4-5 parts), no more candhafts (2-8 parts including gears plus attachment hatdware and bearings, belt, idler pulley, tensioner, attachment hardware, belt covers, more attachment hardware), pistons with at least 4 ring parts each on a 4 cylinder car - that's at least 20 parts on a 4 cylinder plus 4 wrist pons plus 8 securing clips, 4 wrist pin bushings, 4 connecting rods, 8 bearings (8 half bearings), crankshaft, at least 5 bearing parts for that, possibly 4 to 8 oil squirters, flywheel or a torque coverter for automatic transmissions (multiple parts to this assembly and a requirement for several quarts of toxic synthetic or real oil, the list of parts in an ICE engine can reach over 1000 finished parts. Anyone (some Wall Street analysts will tell you an electric car is more complicated and harder to assemble than a gas car. That's a blatant lie. Read my first sentence again."
Elon musk need to worry about Tesla instead of GME and Bitcoin
Panasonic is up alot today thanks to the deal announced with TSLA!
"28.18B in sales, gross 4.07B. Shows you margins are terrible for any auto business. Tim Cook, being a conservative accountant, would never go for that. Software is much safer."
Rumor of a another financial system collapse as per the CEO of IG brokerage just on newsmax a few minutes ago.
"So... put in another buy first thing in the morning, or wait 'till Friday afternoon?"
I love TESLA! time to BUY before it hits $1000 AGAIN!
"This went from $50 to $3,500 unabated, yet they are making a huge DEAL OVER AMC, GME. This went up THE SAME WAY AND CONTINUED UP SINCE. SPLITTING 5 FOR 1"
"guys serious questionI have lost everything, and I'm not sure how to continue. This summer I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into ornamental gourd futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions, I decided I'd try to do something similar with another vegetable. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's gourd yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Mexico and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the gourd bubble burst on November 12th. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for thanksgiving, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of December 2nd, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive gourd shipment from Argentina, scheduled for early March, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the gourds in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound. I am ruined."
Today TSLA dropping 30 percent?OMG
"25 million, 27 years old. I'll have 27 million tomorrow, which will average to 1 million a year. all because I'm invested in tesla"

"We can call Tsla as technology company. In the last 5 qtrs it made money in selling cars. Not shipping/downloading or implementing technology, Let call spade as a spade. it is a car company. He gives free charging for a year to sell cars. He is forcing forced timeoff to cut productions. These are typical car companies do."

This stock is trading like a typical pyramid scam where the last investors lose everything.
Y'all just officially made Musk the richest man in the  this stock is amazing lol I sadly have never invested but enjoy following it
Does anyone know the short % on tsla? There are ways to deal with that as I understand. Ideas?
The insider activity alone on this stock should tell each of you that this ting is a temporary situation. You will notice that the insiders are making themselves wealthy off of this stock price without selling the farm to make it look bad. If they were convinced that the stock was going to continue going up they would not be selling a single share but that is not the case is it?
"Remember this?: Tesla, Trading at $650, Gets $90 Price Target From JPMorgan. JPM, admit you were wrong already!"

Close Strangle and will close naked Call at $680 very soon. Leaving my 740-760 short spread which unlikely go in money. Overall I make 3K. On paper risk is big but in real world this is expected event and risk is much smaller and premium normally enough to reduce signficantly.

"GME with a market cap of over 22 Billion, is overvalued by about 22 BillionTSLA with a market cap of 777 Billion is overvalued by700+ Billion"
Longs still think that the stock is undervalued and will go up further high when Tesla announced that it met 500K target for 2020. But the stock is valued at a price that Tesla will sell more than 30 Million cars in 2021 at a decent margin. Thats the announcement we want for stock to move high. Anything less than that would be a disappointment for Investors. Competition are already at this level of sales.
From Stocktwits:WOW!!! I literally called and just spoke with Brian Conway! I had to clarify that Talindar is speaking truth. It’s legit folks. Brian was down to earth and a very nice guy. They have huge things to come when the Tesla news comes through. He said he’s hoping $TSLA mentions $OZSC soon once a deal is made.
Invested 100ks in TSLA with an iron heart knowing it will double by 2022Hang on tight professionals 
"Shorts, you've all been through the numbers a thousand times . . . can I ask the obvious question . . . how is Tesla still operating? Mathematically, after factoring their sales revenue based on reported deliveries, it's not remotely possible that they have cash left to be doing the things they are purportedly doing."
"Keep in mind there are limited number of shares available in the market - most index funds are holding Lind shares, that means Tesla stock will move higher! Earnings will be awesome!"
"“After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,” the company said in a tweet."

"Do people not understand that Tesla Shareholders decide what Tesla is worth. Tesla has amazing technology and innovation but at the end of the day. We the people/investor determine the rise of Tesla. We see the future and it is why we choose to give Tesla a higher market cap which can allow Tesla to gain more funds for r&d and gigafactories. (100 gigafactories powers the world ) welcome to the future of investing, this is how great companies are created!"
"the market is a Joke now nothing matters stop with the fundamentals theirs a lot of undervalued stocks that keep loosing look at BABA and GE. its all manipulated the only reason this keeps going up because of the millions who know it should not be up and are betting against it, as soon as the shorts are gone the MM will crash this and take it all."

"Bought a few shares in 2016 and aside from wishing I bought a lot more, this has by far been the most fun stock to be a part of. The price action is wild and the excitement is just different than any other company. Now, how high is this thing going to go?? Sheesh"
Microsoft only +1% after very good earnings.What do Longs expect after Tesla earnings after doubling shareprice in last 2 months ????Hahaha......
"How about the possibility that AAPL makes and offer for GM. AAPL has the technology to compete with TESLA but lacks the engineering, design and manufacturing skill. AAPL and GM combo would make a powerful team able to compete against Elon in every aspect."
"If Tesla sold every single auto in the world in 2025 (based on projected total global auto sales) at $40,000 each, and earned a 5% profit margin on each sale, the company today would still trade at 7x 2025 earnings. Let that sink in."
Tesla long and strong...who wants to drive GM or Ford? They can’t figure out how to make cars for over 100 years
Word is Musk just tested his time machine and it works perfectly in both directions.
"The real problem is that most people do not understand numbers and they do not understand probability. You can just about make a case for Amazon, Facebook and Google. These trillion dollar companies have a kind of monopoly in the world. But Tesla? A valuation of more than $800 billion? For a company that produces 500,000 cars a year? $800 bn is roughly one third of the gnp of the United Kingdom. It is more than 60 times the value of Renault. With $800 billion you can buy every single uk bank, HSBC LLOYDS BARCLAYS NAT WEST. And guess what? You will have only spent about 25% of the value of Tesla."
"If Amazon was valued like this company it would be worth about 50,000 per share right now. Seems perfectly reasonable right?"
"Is there a teddy bears picnic that I didn’t know about? A slight miss on profit (not revenue) and they’re out in force! Haha it’s only due to Elon and co. ‘s stock compensation package and some other one off payments. 2021 is going to be a ripper!  The shorts. Good luck to the longs, hold strong guys! "
Today is the calm before the AMAZING EARNINGS CALL!!!! TSLA will shoot up tomorrow by $100 to $200!!!Market Cap will be a TRILLION!!!! I said it first and remember me for saying it!!!! Woo Hoo!!!
Tesla shareholders are the apparent winners. always have been. cant afford a tesla share? go to the GM board. they have ANOTHER bankruptcy in the coming weeks. funded by your minimum wage paid basher taxdollars
Earnings on Wednesday  Go Tesla 
"Wall Street is buy on these dips, watch next week fly. if you sold it, I'll cry with you together next week but if you hold it then celebrate it"
"It is awesome that Tesla is doing so many things to save the planet. Electric cars (you know wealthy people getting the benefit of even more government money) and Solar Roofs (you know, government funded manufacturing facilities and wage subsidies) are all great for the planet.But the company, even after all of that subsidy and government assistance doesn't make money at what they do. None of their businesses is profitable and their primary source of income is regulatory credits. There is nothing wrong with that (if that's the kind of world/government you want to work with) but with growth slowing (not unit numbers, increases in unit numbers) and no profits; with competition increasing when will the market realize that a P/E ration of 1,300 is probably out of line with reality.More importantly, when will the new army of activists realize that they don't want to ride the price down to fundamentally rational levels?Some of the leaders in the business are cashing out and moving to smaller companies (trying to do it again) and when employees realize that those options they have been granted are not making them money . . . well, costs for employment will go up as well.I don't know how long the world takes to become rational after the crazy starts, but it won't last forever.Guru."

"Remember TSLA Cultists, you paid a premium for this stock at a price it should have 10-15 years from now. At some point, Tesla fundamentals and profitability will have to catch up to current valuation. Seems like your cult leader isn't all crazy, he told yall that TSLA share price is too high and if profitability doesn't catch up, we might see huge drop in share price. Seems like decoupling from reality and fantasy land is reversing."

"Tesla, like General Motors (GM), no longer qualifies for the tax credit, since it phases out once an automaker has sold 200,000 electric vehicles."
"I need your opinion please. I am trying to justify buying Tesla at today's share price because I knew about when it was only $8 ps 10 years ago and did not pull the trigger. But here's the thing I think, since no one thinks it is a big deal that Apple is up 38,405% (by my calculations) in the last 10 years, why do people find it difficult to understand that Tesla is up 16,220%? I know the financials are completely different between the 2 companies, but hey, if Apple can be up 38,400%, why can't Tesla? TSLA still has a long way to go to catch up to AAPL....yes?"
Don’t focus on the share price. Focus on the business. Tesla is leading while all others are playing catch up.
Come on it’s a great deal at $20M per car valuation
"Here is what a joke Tesla's valuation is: For Q4 in NL-NO-SP, Volkswagen sold over 19k id.3s and id.4s. Tesla sold about half that many S/X/3s combined. Tesla has been selling all three models for the entire year. The id.3 has only been selling since September and the id.4 just started selling in December. Looks like competition has arrived, and this is just the beginning."

Tomorrow below 800?
It will open @750 tomorrow!
Tesla unveiling this century’s version of the Ford Pinto. Nice
"Cramer commented the increases during the week: a self-fulfilling prophecy. S&P 500 fund managers have to buy as the periodic 401(k) money comes in. Prices go up as those fund, mutual fund, ETF’s, managers fill the orders per the formulae (by the market caps, I think). These purchases drive up the shares. Shorts need to cover due to the higher shares. Squeeze. High shares beget higher shares. Cramer predicts more analysts revisingtheir share targets come Monday. We have a cycle going. ."
making real cash here so glad I hopped on early! Should I sell or hold through the earnings.. kinds scared. What you guys think? $WIMI $TSLA $FUBO
"According to last week's Barrons the value of Tesla is $1.25M per every car they ship. Value of GM is $9.5k per car they ship. Tesla P/E is 1,650 and GM 22. The other car manufacturers have similar valuations to GM. So even if Tesla took 100% of the auto market (every other car manufacturer went bankrupt) Tesla would be overpriced by a factor of 80."
These Shorties were saying Tesla lost Market Share in China. Where do they get their false information from?
"Hey shorts, how are you? Waiting for a New Year? :-DThis year you lost $38 billion - thanks, because we gained it! Wish you to have even better year in 2021!"
Who shorted at 850 
Today's market run-up owes a big thank you to Janet Yellen. But easy money will only carry this mkt so far before underlying fundamentals kick in and share prices reverse to more reasoned levels. Even RBC and BAC are now predicting Tesla growth rate to decelerate dramatically over the next five years.

"I am going to short Tesla - today. IMO the valuation has reached an unsustainable level, production & delivery challenges are sprouting up (which will likely be revealed in the 27th earnings call) and the competition is quickly catching up to chip into market share. The bold and committed investors will do the same; the curious, fearful or brainwashed will sit on the sidelines and watch the pullback without the financial windfall in their portfolios."

"short f, gm, intcbuy tesla nvidia nio xpeng qs"
Look at nio chart and other big tech charts. All had huge dip at 11:10
Let’s be honest. Tesla has one or two more years in China. Nio just solidified their position with their et7 pricing undercutting the model S and being close to other models. Tesla needs to combine powers with nio.
Tesla have a history. at earning or battery day is pull back. Than come beck struger
It is selling off as the hedge funds are selling the good stocks to cover the shorts for GameStop and AMC.

Is it true that if Robinhood file for Bankruptcy you can only secure 500K and if you have more than that then you will lose it all. They are talking about that on Reddit.
"Can Tesla bulls explain to me why they think any of Tesla's supposed ""businesses"" - cars, solar/energy, battery, and robotaxis are actually great businesses to be in? Of course there are profits to be made there, but all are capital intensive, slow-to-scale and low margin. Hypothetically assuming Tesla dominates each of these industries (it won't), why does it deserve a tech company valuation on a bunch of hard goods, commoditized businesses?Do you know what are excellent businesses? ? Easily scalable software and platforms. Like FANG"
Bye bye TSLA

Judging by the negativity here I assume there will be a short squeeze on Monday but who knows this is a casino.
It’s Tesla...every dip is bought!!
So I’m confused they reported earnings of $240 million or so and they sold environmental credits profiting $410 million? So without those sales there’d be a loss of $170m for the Q?
For my fellow Teslanaires!!!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptFegqTOYYc
"Boys and girls, it does not matter at this point to say ""I should have bought it long ago...bla blab bla.""What matter is going forward from Monday. I am buying more NIO shares like with 50K USD after watching ET7....IT CAN ONLY GO HIGHER FROM current price!!!Why? because of ET 7 with camera sensor plus Lidar, their new FSD chip with NVidia, new battery solid state which no one in the world has...QS will have it 4 years from now???Come on man...NIO already has it.Tesla is working on it but not there yet! The quality of NIO vs. Tesla.Tesla=VW quality while NIO= Apple quality.P>S>: I do not think Apple will produce Apple car...they are way too late to the game.If Apple comes to making their car, it will take 7-10 years by then...Apple will be left behind by NIO and Tesla by 15 years or more!!!!!ONLY EV PLAY in town ARE both $tsla and NIO but from watching NIO day, NIO has many many more UP UP SIDE for the STONKS!"
"First time shorter of TSLA: order set for 10 shares @ $890. $600s are coming. I'm super conservative on investments but the data calls for at least a 30%-40% correction. Protect at least part of your capital and sell some. Don't be greedy. No company can sustain a PE that would require 1000% growth in revenue per year for the next 10 year. Don't get me wrong, TSLA is a great company and has a great future ahead of it. Take the opportunity to make some money on a correction that will happen. With that said, a massive global correction is on the horizon within a year or two. History will call it the Great Depression. Prepare for it."
I can admit that investing in TSLA these years has been a hell of a ride that it is paying off every single doubt I could ever had.
"If Tesla reports $1 EPS, then the PE will go down to 800. Not that regular PE is important for a growth stock but just saying, the PE will go down little by little."

"Too high a valuation for such a niche EV player. The educated EV consumers of Norway are perfect evidence, where Tesla places a dismal 7th, with only 2,081 sales. Top of the list was the Audi e-tron, with over 7,000 - which bodes well for its parent Volkswagen. Mercedes-Benz’s EQC and even the Nissan Leaf outsold it. While the OFV’s statistics don’t break out electric from conventional sales for the VW Golf and Hyundai Kona, it would appear highly likely that their electric versions also easily outsold anything put on the market by Tesla."
"As long as I live, I will never short Tesla again. I got my lesson learned."
"Nancy Pelosi's husband has placed up to $1 million worth of bullish bets on Tesla stock,"
Ever happens when run outta govt credits to sell
"Tesla shares rose in premarket trading Wednesday following analysts' optimistic fourth-quarter delivery estimates for the electric vehicle company. Two analysts said Tesla should reach its goal of 500,000 deliveries for 2020. ""With 180k for 4Q the line in the sand, we believe given the underlying strength we are picking up in China as well as a late push in Europe and the U.S., that 190k-200k is well within reach,"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a commentary."
20M per car valuation. Buy buy
Current valuation assumes Tesla sell a lot of cars on Mars in 2021 and forward. How big will the crash be if they don't?
"I told yall, you got trapped. Sorry for your loss, but we should go to the moon."
Too many EV cars coming this year from many manufacturers.
"Keep accumulating!!! TSLA will be $4000 - $5000 a share in 5 years!!! Tesla's EV (2 Trillion), Battery(2 Trillion), Software/FSD Full Self Driving (1 Trillion), Solar (1.5 Trillion), RoboTaxi (1 Trillion). Tesla will be a multi-Trillion Dollar Market Cap Company!!!"
"Low volume today on all EV’s. LI literally needs to put out one good piece of press and it’ll carry it into the 40’s. I’m all for working hard in silence but they need to give the big boys a little taste of good news. Keep holding the line, it will go up. Roam wasn’t built in a day, nor was the LI One. $Li $XPEV $NIO $TSLA"
Who think money will leave Tesla and enter Nio?
I wonder what would happen if I leave my 1000 shares to my grandchildren.
its official........democraps run the show now and futures are down......this will be common

Half the world just got invested in TESLA via one ETF or another. Now even your Grandmother owns Tesla. I’m up close to 4mil THANK YOU ELON
 To Wallstreetbets & Reddit activists  PLEASE HELP RMO being attacked by shorts. Let’s CRUSH EM.  CNBC SAYS  on RMO which is being hailed as an $AMZN EV Delivery Van battery supplier. also CLII is also in the play / same industry as $TSLA and $NIO
What is the difference between a short and a broken clock......The clock atleast tells the truth 2 times every day.

$1.35 million in market cap for each vehicle delivered!!
"Roll all my put to 760 strike expire 1/22. Basically now $40K at risk. While I am not sure where all this buying power coming, those $600 only go so far and can't just go to single stock. Also lot of big boys need to book profit and they will do one of this day. When we don't know but soon for sure."
Low volume all week. I bet next week when volume goes up the price will too.No wait im already betting on that .. with my shares :D

"everyone can be rich. buy some shares , easy"
I CAN trust Elon Musk. Just look at what he has done with space X that almost all people thought landing back the rocket would be impossible and he did it just like he is gonna deliver what he has said about Tesla. I am on the way to become a millionaire 
THIS IS WHAT BUYING TESLA DIP DOES
Today we raise USA..... I have a plan...stay tuned

A week from today we will be at $1000! See you all on the green side!
"Been looking around the web about response to Nio Day. It is very bullish. $TSLA has the high stock price it has relative to sales because of its tech, first mover status, and the future sales it will and is starting to yield. $NIO just unveiled the type of tech that will have the same impact. And, comparing their growth story and sales levels to $TSLA, it is obvious that NIO should be waaaay higher (not TSLA levels, but it should get to about $175 EOY). It is not a matter of TSLA vs NIO. It is TSLA & NIO vs the ICE companies who are five years behind NIO and TESLA on the tech. The long drive to $175 starts Monday."
"when ppl talk about TESLA, normally think it is auto company, actually the energy sector is much much bigger than auto sector. Tesla will be big star in this sector too. We will see how fast their energy sector revenue increase in the coming earning report!"
The market cap gained by Tesla today alone was worth the entire company of Ford :-)
Todays down turn is a buying opportunity
"Happy with the rebound today, $900 by next Friday"
"The Stock split has helped Tesla bring the price down to a level where younger investors can jump in, Myself included. Strong companies with smart leaders understand this, to those who don't, your loss."
"Tesla is now valued higher than all automakers in the world combined which sell 65M cars each year, while Tesla won't even sell the 0.5M they guided for 2020.https://twitter.com/InvestorSwan/status/1331306761962348545"
Norway - Teslas annual sales dropped 51 %France - Teslas annual sales dropped 30 %Netherlands = Tesla annual sales down 62%The world is not flat. The moon is not made of Swiss cheese. Tesla is shrinking in Europe.
What should I do with Tesla I have 10 shares around 492 a share should I sell or hold before they enter the S&P 500 it’s coming down to the wire! But I’m bullish with this stock but nervous at the same time
Wait until China like it always does regulates a US business like Tesla so its Chinese owned EV companies get an advantage...that is coming very soon....they will never let a US company outperform one of their own...
Look who sold on earnings day at 870...https://ir.tesla.com/_flysystem/s3/sec/000179056521000001/000179056521000001-gen.pdf
"Bye bye 800 , top has been made yesterday the bubble will explode! back to 100 . Full of put thks all the fan boys of tesla!Don t worry , i will buy some tesla cars with my profit, or may be Nio cars !"
"Wish I owned Tesla, awesome CEO and company vision, but im not willing to risk my money at this valuation."
Shorts are screaming inside 
Elon should tweet that Tesla will make smart phone in 2023.
I just LOVE to post Tesla's sales numbers: Norway - Teslas annual sales dropped 51 %France - Teslas annual sales dropped 30 % Netherlands = Tesla annual sales down 62%
P/E is 1600. Lolz.
"profits are down in Q4. big miss. Time to sell!TESLA 4Q ADJ EPS 80C, EST. $1.03TESLA 4Q REV. $10.74B, EST. $10.38B"
"Model Y launch in China, no one will buy NIO, even Chinese don’t trust Chinese products, Tesla sales will further boom "
"Buckle up, we’re going to go through some bumpy air today. Hopefully a good dip to add some shares"
900 or 850 tomorrow?
Even Credit Suisse upped their target to $800 on strong margins
Shares are hard to borrow now. This could be another epic short squeeze.
"Long queues to buy Tesla Model Y in China after the huge downward price revision. In the first day of launch, 100k orders in 10 hours! "
1200 per share by next week
"Let’s get to 900 today and 1000 by Monday. 10,000 by February. Remember they sold almost 500,000 cars last year!"
Sell this! This is worth 100$ In reality! Look at the pe or peg ratio!
how does it feel now seeing the price not crash? you sad? wanna go cry
"Longs, we need you all keep buying so the Wall Street and insiders can keep unloading."
Right now we are selling to each others and shorts are not coughing up any money to cover their positions. Rumors are $GME like $AMC and earlier $TSLA is coming up with a series of new issues to rescue hedge funds. The new issue will be priced starting $100 and going down to $20. If that happens we will all loose except those who exit fast.
670 by EOD!!! X'mas Gift!!!
Tesla is only at the beginning of its years long growth story. Why would I sell?
I am buying calls options with Nancy! Lol
Green soon
Tesla always flat on earnings reportFebruary or March I guess will start it's rally again
Why would anyone listen to Gordon Johnson? He is wrong to the tune of 800$ per share higher than his call.
Buying Opportunity!!!
Save the movie theatre industry and get rich doing it while squeezing the shorts! Invest in $AMC ! $tsla $pltr $nio $gme $zom $bb
"BTW, Tesla admited they have sold forward their regulatory credit and only have a couple of quarter remaining. That means that TSLA will be loosing money in the second half of this year. They have never made money selling cars. EVER."
Longs to shorts right now
Refuses to give any forward guidance....Wow.
Never sell Tesla shares
600$ here we all come
"Telsa slowly melting back to 80$ a share. VW launched its ID3/ID4 EVs in China at a price 12.000$ lower than Tesla3, invests 86bn$ in EV R&D capacity over next 5 years. Tesla is only affordable to rich car buyer segment that switch from BMW or Audi - this segment is too small to justify a 800bn $ market cap. VW just posted profit of 12bn $ in 2020, and their market cap is 100bn $. Dont buy the nonsense about solar, energy storage etc - this is a commodity business. I sold all my tesla share and collected a nice profit. The party is over."
Thank God I took some of my Apple after it split and plowed it into Tesla before it split! Long and STRONG!!!
ok only 0.8 eps thats is massive miss how did it happen?
"Ladies and Gentleman, we will experience most exciting moment from now till next Monday in Wall Street history. Tsla will joint S&P index !!! Estimate 500B will buy TSLA in two days ... hold your shares and watching the rocket goes to moon :)"
"I bet they run this thing to $1000 right up until earnings on Jan 21 then they blow out earnings and it pops another $250 to $1250. On Jan 22,then Musk announces another split and they run it to $1600 Have seen it before"
"I see many of you want to buy Tesla and complaining the overvalued price. Let me tell you that I did the same from $495 and ended up buying at $800. Before, I tried to short Tesla because it’s overpriced. I lost a lot shorting Tesla. I promised myself that I will never ever short Tesla again. No no no!"
"There are two types os smart people who is winning in these stock market. 1. Current scenario. People who are riding the tide of FOMO and hysteria but know when to cash in.2. People who understands fundementals of three company and have patience to play the long game. Two always win in long run. Game of patience extends to years of waiting but safest.Shorting Tesla is 2, if you can survive waiting then you will win."
ordering model Y today
Tesla’s doing great! They’re well on track! Buy any dips it will be a gift... only good news here! They even have hints of a model 2 in the report
Apple IPhone doesn’t come in with the lowest price...this thing will go down in the long run especially with much added competition
"Comparing Tesla to any other car company, we are missing an important point, that is Tesla does not have to pay for 100 years of retired people pension and healthcare. No mater how much GM or Ford or VW makes. At the end of the day they have to give that profit back to the people who worked at the company in the last 100 years. Nothing left for the company or shareholders."
I see no news why markets are getting destroyed.
I am thinking buy some AMC share tomorrow
"Its not a $NKLA or a $TSLA or a $NIO but its traded in the US OVTC and Germany and TSX. Dynacert $DYA.TO is on a tear right nowJim Payne, President and CEO discussed how the company integrated longevity into the corporate strategy noting. ""This is a global solution to reduce pollution that works now. This is technology that we're not thinking we can do, or hoping we can do; it's done. It's proven worldwide. Along with that, you look at all the patents that we've got. Just last week I was talking to an analyst and he was saying, ""You know Jim, that one worldwide pattern you've got on the means and methods of monitoring and monetizing carbon credits with an internal combustion engine, that's a trillion dollars in itself."" Should see a 50% gain over the next few days."
Should I buy more now ?
"900 today, sure I’ll take that!"
Futures are up. Tomorrow is going to be real short squeeze
How those who sold premarket are feeling about now
"TSLA knows exactly what lot of the car, has problem when some owners bring back the car for service. So TSLA recalls those cars first before the gov. agency will take action. I call it real smart move. TOY will resist the claim until the medias spread the news."
last year in january stock falls from 800+ to 350..I guess this is happening again even there was a 5.1 Split
"December is Tesla's strong month in Germany - when they usually post their largest sales numbers. VWs ID.3 = 7,144 units sold in DecemberRenault Zoe = 5,349 units sold in December Tesla M3 = 3,293 units sold in December BTW Tesla doesn't ship any Model 3s from California to China. They now have tons of capacity for North America and Europe. But the Model 3 is no longer new in the USA and sales are flat or down ( Tesla won't reveal US sales anymore). Now the Model 3 is getting old in Europe and Tesla is losing huge chunks of market share."
Market is down huge today but Tesla up 4%. It’s time to short Tesla. This stock will go down 80% this year.
last buy in opportunity at this price cathy woods is visionary
"Since Robinhood can not buy $gme and only can sell, come and do tesla's GME!!!!!!Let's make tesla into a $10,000 stock now!!!!!!!!!$gme, $amc, $BB, $aapl, $bac, $nio!!!"

Just wow!!!! Unbelievable support for this company and there are still so many people that have next to no understanding of what Tesla is capable of!!! So glad I was lucky enough to be apart of this massive growth story and will be for years to come! In Elon we Trust!!!
My three biggest investing mistakes:1) I didn't start investing at 182) I sold $TSLA $BTC & $AMD in 2017 3) I parted with 500 shares of BEAM in 2020
"Latest prices of Tesla $TSLA Nio $NIO Xpeng $XPEV and Li Auto $LI Tesla has slashed prices of its made-in-China Model Y cars to woo drivers in the world’s largest electric vehicle market, ratcheting up pressure on its global and Chinese rivals that focus on the premium segment.The Long Range version of Model Y starts from 339,000 yuan (US$52,074), excluding a government subsidy, 30 per cent cheaper than the price quoted six months ago when presale orders could first be placed.- Xpeng Motor’s P7 all-electric sedan, start from 229,900 yuan after government subsidies. - Li Auto’s ONE SUV sells for 328,000 yuan, - NIO’s ES6 SUV starts at 346,600 yuan. Prices are several notches higher for foreign marques, - Mercedes-Benz EQC going at 499,800 yuan- BMW’s iX3 retails for 469,900 yuan.I think the biggest competition to Telsa, Xpeng, Nio and Li Auto is the PRC traditional auto manufactures as BAIC, SAIC, Geely and BYD for example. I am personally and professionally bullish about the PRC EV market and think 8 - 10 companies will dominate like Telsa, Nio, Xpeng, Li, WM, BAIC, SAIC, Geely and BYD and then there will be least expensive (but not that profitable) and the top end luxury foreign JVs like Mercedes, VW doing well too to make up about 12-15 companies leading EV in PRC.For Nio, Xpeng, Li and WM, they will continue to do very well and have significant upside both in business and stock valuations."
"How many of you see more Amazon vans than Tesla's? I live in Northern California, three people in my gated community own them and I would say it is not even close. I see many more amazon vans and they generate revenue unlike the mythical robo taxi."
gasoline cars are better to recycle
Just look at it this way: JPM just increased Tesla's price estimate by 12.5%650 + 12.5% = $731.25
Is the conference call still going on?
Yahoo is so funny... I just saw $799 for AH price
If you read the actual report the flaw is not teslas fault rather a flaw in nvidias tegra processor I mean really 8GB of emmc memory come on
if stellar earnings with 80% profit are announced it wouldn't justify current share price.
small capital raise.....going higher. imo
"Most over valued car company, $GM has more production capacity more dealers and history"
"I don?t understand the conflict between bears and bulls on TSLA. The bears just see it as a car company and rant (over and over I must say) about car sales numbers. The bulls see a completely different company. They see potential with self driving and robotaxi and semis and battery and software sales and revenues with energy and energy storage. It?s like two ships crossing the sea - completely missing each other. Bears compare Tesla to Toyota and VW and cite how VW sells more EVs in Norway. Bulls could give a #$%$ about Norway and sees how VW and Toyota are never going to have revenues from self driving, software or batteries or energy. It?s the same only story whenever a bull posts vs a bear. They don?t speak about the same thing and virtually there is no real healthy debate - just a lot of blabber"
"Unbelievable how many smart bag holders here. Trying to justify the variation is impossible as it is unjustifiable. The only reason why this stock is keep going up is people don't think it will fall, but that is the biggest deception in the stock market."
"ALL the tech stocks are exploding today, not this one!"
IMO: I think this may get split by end of the month(Jan 2021) !!
"Bubbles is everywhere, this is not any more stock market"
Wedbush increases Tesla price target to $950! With bull case price target increase to $1250!
Minimum Down 10 % Today. My prediction.
"I reviewed the ""investors"" section of the Tesla Motors Club site. It was like finding the juvenile fiction section of the library. There were all sorts of fantasies about factories in far off lands, world domination of half a dozen industries and worship of a god."
but it's about the environment man! lmao
"Record High and Record Close today. Sure would be nice to conclude 2020 with a December 31, 2020 close above $700.00 Congratulations to all long-time Tesla longs!"
everywhere it is said tesla is the new AOL. but have you ever seen elon stand still? no! so it doesn't compare to AOL or anything. that's why the stock is only going up
Elon 3billion away from becoming the richest man in the world. Tesla to $850. Elon on top
I still think tesla would eventually end the day in green

Once in a lifetime stock
Cnbc just said tesla is just as overvalued as game stop:)
Funds are required by law to buy at the close tomorrow so I'd get in now as the price will have to spike to get in. Especially since so many of us refuse to part with our shares.After that stock will have to keep going up as 401K investors pile into SP500.

"Some of you are detached from reality, tesla is not 760 because it's the best company ever in the market, its because we are in a huge bubble. protestors storm into capital and markets are green, vix is shooting up as markets go up. it's not only tesla but honestly how the hell can you wrap your head around paying a 15milion premium for each car made by the company. some people will get out when markets tops most will lose everything, I am not smart enough to time it , I am just watching at this madness currently"

"Yahoo Finance's title is misleading: Tesla's Elon Musk has at least a '3-5 year run' left with the company.During call yesterday, Elon did not say he will leave the company, but will give CEO title to someone else a few years later, and he will continue focus on technology."
Going to add another 17 shares tomorrow leading up to earnings.
"Just sold all of my shares since may 2020, even if Tesla produces 22 million cars by 2035 with annual revenue of 1.2 trillion that’s only $60 in earnings per share, do I believe in musk and Tesla revolution I do, but it’s time to take profit and chill, thank you all and happy 2021"

"Earnings Date 1/27/21 I have a feeling that Tesla is going to be flat until we get to the earnings date and the institutions will react accordingly... so if you think Tesla will meet or beat then its time now to start loading up.... if you think Tesla won't then you might want to cover... the shorts at this time are in sphincter muscle tightening mode so its best not to sell at this time... but the smart move is to cover your bet and if you load up, then get the rewards on the earnings date.. 1/27/21"
"$TSLA reminds me of $QCOM in 2000. $QCOM shot up to $1000 from $500 from end of November to Jan 2nd. The day before 4:1 split, $QCOM was at $800 and for some reason it shot up to $1000 overnight. Who knows, $TSLA might reach $1000 after 12/21"
"Tesla Giga Shanghai Is Ramping Up Model Y Production to Meet Extraordinary China DemandTesla Model Y has shone like a bright star since its inception at the company's Fremont factory. The demand for the model clearly exceeds the current production capacity, but Giga Shanghai is actively entering the production process. The parking lot at Tesla's Chinese factory is almost completely filled with China-made Model Ys, which will be delivered shortly.Tesla Model Y is in very high demand in China, and attracts thousands of customers every day. Orders for the highly anticipated SUV have reportedly surpassed 100,000. At the same time, stores that already have Model Y on display are overwhelmed with potential customers, while other automakers' stores resemble a desert.Meanwhile, Giga Shanghai is ramping up production of Model Y. In images taken by Jason Yang, hundreds of Model Ys can be seen, which are located in the central parking lot and occupy a disproportionate part of it. A flyby of the plant also reveals that SUVs are located in other parts of it.The SUV segment is extremely popular, so the demand for Model Y will continue to grow over time. With experience organizing and ramping up production with Model 3, a quick start to the production of Model Y for Tesla's China team should go smoothly.Good luck and GOD bless,"

How down big can Tesla get after getting a big up???
"BTW, this company is only profitable with EV tax credits...without they lose money and all of these people are buying stock still at a 830B valuation when the company technically loses money....this is the biggest scam of a bubble I have ever seen in my 40 years trading stock....."

"Can't make Roadster and Semi, due to lack of batteries. Wasn't that the point (and advantage) of Nevada Gigafactory? Three years ago, Musk said they'd be building over 1 million cars in 2020. They did half that.So why the shortage? Tesla is even buying batteries from other suppliers. Elon should have batteries up to his ears, instead of up his ash. (Eweee!)"
This stock is a screaming BUY!
The entire stock market is crashing because of little retail investors speculation.
Buy buy buy!!!3000 by the end of this year!!!
"Everyone knows by the time the news comes, it’ll be too late. Be smart and buy more LI now. Your portfolio will thank you. $LI $XPEV $NIO $TSLA"
Never short a stock that is going to the moon.
"Not claiming to be a prophet but I have commented that inclusion into S&P 500 started this rise. Of course I wasn't the only one saying this. However, it was stagnate after S&P date and many believed that the prior price rise already priced the inclusion. Then the announcement that the 4680 battery wasn't only going to be on Tesla's shoulders. Panasonic was already building the battery right after battery day and has already signed a deal to do so. Furthermore, LG Chem will also join the deal."
"A short squeeze is a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to technical factors in the market rather than underlying fundamentals. A short squeeze can occur when there is a lack of supply and an excess of demand for the stock due to short sellers covering (liquidating) their positions.[1]Short squeezes result when short sellers of a stock move to cover their positions, purchasing large volumes of stock relative to the market volume. Since covering their positions involves buying shares, the short squeeze causes a further rise in the stock's price. This newly increased price can in-turn trigger additional margin calls and short covering, which in turn may drive up the price further still in a vicious feedback loop. Short squeezes tend to happen in stocks that have expensive borrow rates. These expensive borrow rates can increase the pressure on short sellers to cover their positions, further adding to the reflexive nature of this phenomenon."
Anyone actually has one proper good reason for why Tesla share is a buy at USD 800+ levels ?
I want to see P/E 2000 before we go to 3000 after earnings report but maybe it will be so fast I won't be able to see it! Installing high speed camera to catch the moment!
25k car to be unveiled next spring-2022.
After all this nightmare any predictions for tomorrow should o sell my shares any adviced thank you
"Tesla will definitely reach $10,000/share, 20,000/share even 50,000/share"
The markets used to drive me crazy with losses. I almost left the trading game for good until a friend shared a little secret with me. He gets his best picks (one a week) from (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Join them.
What's worse than Tesla build quality? TESLA Customer service.
"Wow... nice to see drop to 800 and then pop above. Let's see where it closes tomorrow. If it can stay above 825 by COB tomorrow, it will chase 1000 next week. If it breaks 825 by tomorrow close, then 700 seems more likely before 1000."
$TSLA is down because they can't get enough batteries from Panasonic $PCRFY. This is proof that Panasonic has the secret sauce for EV's and the reason why it will soar after their earnings.
Is this stock still a buy?
"If Tesla delivers expected earnings of $1.00/share, this would mean that the 12 month trailing P/E ratio of 348. An investor is paying $348 dollars for $1 of earnings. You can also purchase a 10 year treasury bond for $107 and receive that $1 in earnings for risk free"

"Tesla valuation is greater than all of the USA majors combined values. Tesla is THE largest manufacturer of EV in the world. Expansion into foreign markets, Germany, India, China and yet again in the United States, secured the leadership position in the EV. I am optimistic and bullish in the longer term for a steady upward price trend. (btw, shorts had a few good days last week if your timing was spot on, right?)"
Dippy Doo market. Another incredible buy opportunity for TSLA.
"delivered 500,000 cars last year and valued at 800 billion LOL"
"Simply incredible! I don't think there has ever been another stock like this on Earth! I left the Tesla train for now, good fortune to the longs."

"The term from the 1990's ""Irrational Exurberance"" comes to mind. Congratulations to the longs on your gains. Eventually the buble will pop and train wreck will come... but not today."

"TSLA, A great buy opportunity for a stock that’s headed for $1,000 !!"
"TSLA dropped, why put options lost $?"

Can’t wait until the next earning report. It’ll be Tesla’s first profitable year. That’s finna be great! Hoping that along with crushing sales numbers gets us some  Bought at 620; before the s&p inclusion!

"I own 50 shares @36$ ($1800 Investment) which has now become $ 30,000 (1681% growth). I wish I had bought more. I was new to investing a year ago and ended up buying just 10 shares (it became 50 after the split). Now the question is..do I sell or buy more? Where do you all think that the price might go up to? I feel it is ridiculously high to buy more and average it. Have been waiting for a correction, which does not seem to be happening anytime.."
"All said and done, I think Tesla gave a fabulous result in 2020. Some people are saying Tesla fell short of its delivery commitment... Really!?? I am expecting TSLA to go up next week. Don’t try to bring down the stock with pessimism just so you can buy it when the price falls. Let’s give Tesla it’s due worth and move on with its increasing share price."
"If the robin hood traders coming back, then go Tesla above the $ 1000 or if the robin hood traders leave, then go Tesla to $500. I think that Telsa go make a wild drive, this like a bitcoin. We see what goes happen. It is all God's work."
"Robinhood halts buying of GameStop and other hot stocks, infuriating users. What a power!"

guarantee when I buy in that means tesla has hit its peak. happens everytime
"Thumbs up for $900 or > today, thumbs down for $860 or below, and comment for neutral move between $860 to $890 (tell me why)."
How about another split ?
TSLA can go to $1000 in the coming days. But it is heading below $300 in a year. TSLA was $37 in 2019. That's the downside risk. Just see QS chart. Good luck.

Its always suicide betting against tesla earning for the past 3 years
Merry Christmas . Tesla has blessing of Santa Claus￼. We will ride to new heights in first week of January.
Rare earth battery material is limited and not good for environment to tear up the earth to remove it however Hydrogen Tech is endless imo. Tesla can continue to build EV but if it starts to counter Apple with Hydrogen Tech/Fuel Cell Tech now watch out. You never know.
Tesla now within 4% of it's all time closing high of $880. A ton of shorts over the last month. Might be a short squeeze coming soon! Go Tesla.
"Hello There, Can anyone suggest me, should I buy Tesla stock tomorrow? Is it still the right time? Or will I loose? Thanks"
"TSLA full autonomy is backed by a neural net, doubt any other EV company has the big data and intelligence TSLA has collected over the years, collected through over a million constant data input streams. TSLA has collected a minimum of 2 billion data hours (credit the term ""data hours"" to me, thank you very much.)"
"Each year, from 2014 to 2016, an estimated 171,500 highway iCE vehicle fires occurred in the United States, resulting in an annual average of 345 deaths; 1,300 injuries; and $1.1 billion in property loss. 1 These highway vehicle fires accounted for 13 percent of fires responded to by fire departments across the nation.And one EV Catches fire in china and this is the best the shorts can come up with??!"

these lucid cars are better performers than $TSLA tesla vehicles.. it won't be $800/share but man easily hits $200 when the hype train picks up
NICE I just picked up another 20 shares at a big discount.
It seems tesla results are non event because trading volume is low and stock price is not not moving much even results are not favorable. It means stock price will be elevated in the coming sessions with high risk mode. i am waiting for better opportunity.
"TSLA up but charging station stocks down, go figure that one"
what are the chances of another split like last year? win win for old as well as new!
I think this was the big crash everyone was talking about...... 18 cents after hours. I'm broke 
What would you guys consider as the ceiling on Tesla?I bought a very humble position pre split so sat on a healthy gain.I've seen bull case 1000 and bear case 444 on 12 month targets.Honest thoughts please
"Taking a poll, how many minutes late will the CC start this time. My guess is 00:05:02"
I see a lot of FOMO going on here
"Hmm California news should boost it up tomorrow.. Lots of catalysts going on. Analyst upgrade to $1000+, earnings next week, California registrations up, China sales off to good start. Let’s see what tomorrow brings"
"Will the volume come back this week? I was surprised to see it at half the average last week. Also, anybody think this will run before earnings, or are people just waiting on the news?"
In the long term it will go down. Too much competition not enough margin. This is not like a phone company. There’s nothing you can do about the stock people will buy it lose a lot of money and eventually it will go down. There’s nothing anyone can do about it. It is what it is
"The good story for TESLA is that there will be no serious competition (outside of China) for perhaps 3 to 5 years. But the most optimistic projections have Tesla earning no more than a total of about $30/share ($30 billion) by that time. After 2023, it's not clear that Tesla will be able to compete profitably.All this surge in the stock price is sowing the seeds of future competition. When TSLA's market cap was below GM's, Apple might well ignore the EV market. With TSLA with a market cap approaching APPL, it's natural to figure that it is worth designing a better EV just like it designs a better cell phone. Why shouldn't ever Apple phone user regard the Apple car as the natural extension of its ecosystem. Apple may well capture the high margin EV business and the old car manufacturers like GM dividing the low margin EV market. There may not be much of a place for a TESLA."
"I wonder if a Market Maker is going to get carried out tomorrow. There has been a lot of price manipulation using Calls for the past few months and it looked like this was going to get pegged to $800 and there was over 130k volume in the $800 Calls that expire tomorrow. If this surges tomorrow like it did today, it is going to make some a lot of money and someone is going to lose a lot. I have been wondering if Options could be the cause of the next financial crisis like credit default swaps were in 2008. The Option volume has been insane lately, especially on the Call side."
Elon vs Shorts
"With the speed other auto makers are gearing up to launch EV cars, Tesla will come down to a reasonable/appropriate market CAP."
Tesla will be the next $1 Trillion tech company

Tesla is slowly but steadily close to green @ aftermarket
Musk could and should raise a quick $10 billion with an additional share issue. That would be enough to build several gigafactories and would only dilute the share base by a tiny 1%.Seems like an obvious choice with the stock price at this level
P/e 1665 is sooo attractive
This happens to Tesla all the time. Last time it went from $450 to $330 and a couple months later we are sitting at $650. This will pass and the price will have a huge rise again. If you panic sell you will regret it within a few weeks.
900.00 0N OPEN MONDAY
As I said.Between 860 - 880 today :)
4% up in frankfurt stock exchange already..
YOU GUYS ARE ALL BLIND IF YOU THINK TESLA INVESTORS ARE GOING TO SELL BECAUSE OF THIS NEWS
Watch what happens when people begin to realize TSLA is a double play in the Biden economy. Electric Vehicles and Solar power for homes and businesses. Not only does TSLA have the most advanced EV on the market they have by far the best solar array package on the market.
"Tuesday will be 5% up, who believes on tesla."
What is going on. I thought this was going to crash.
"Instead of hearing ""How your predecessors did it and got lucky, consider yourselves lucky the stock market is irrational and moving up!!,, Enjoy while it lasts....make the best of it.. A very rare opportunity. We are all lucky in this respect. Prepare to tell your stories, including the pandemic and politics to your successors..... Yep. Who knew we would experience all of this in our lifetime????"
This will crash and will get valued as it should. 60% drop should do it
"the reason it is going up every day is Elon musk tweets every day and engages the shareholders. per tweet, he has the highest market cap In stock market history."
"These shorts have been saying the same thing since this stock was at $100 hahah, it gets so old..like of course you’ll eventually be right if you constantly say it’s gunna go down after every run up..so far you’ve been wrong though just keep your comments to yourself until you’re actually right."
"Elon Musk, who just recently earned the title of the richest person in the world, has announced plans to sell all of his possessions, so people know he’s serious about colonising Mars.The tech guru plans to spend much of his $188 billion net worth on starting a colony on the Red Planet, with the exception of what is tied up in stock value.not trying to scare youthe article is enough to cause panic sell though"
Will TSLA up to 800 today?
BUY THE DIP BOYS HUGEEEEE 2021 AND THIS BITCOIN DEVELOPMENT MAKES IT EVEN BIGGER
"More upgrades coming.Analysts will soon be running a FOMO game on upgrades.Any analyst can look great by setting a new target about 15% above the current price, then look like a genius in just two days!"
"So, another analyst downgrades stock to about half of what it is now. Almost a $700 billion company.Stock has a HORRIBLE day.......UP only 1%. And so it goes and goes and goes.........."
Anyone know why TSLA quickly peaked at 900 then dropped down again.
So they made 500k cars this year and there is a recall on the equivalent of 30% of these...!? Hilarious!
"Nothing to push the stock Higher anymore from now on. PROFITABILITY This is the future Problem for Tesla.Selling cars with losses or without profit is not very smart, isn't it ?They've reduced their prices several times in 2020 in order to achieve the difficult target of 500000 cars.Tesla will definitely not achieve their new target of 750000 cars in 2021.Mission impossible in a very competitive environment everywhere.In China NIO and VW, In US GM and Ford . In Europe , to many to name them."
"wow, TSLA just gained the entire market cap of F today... the burst of this bubble is imminent IMO"
"Haven’t we learned anything yet from this market? Bad news is good news, good news is bad news. I bet you it will open 20 points plus tomorrow."
I would love to see Reddit step up and pick a real mans stock.

Tesla Overvalued ? I don’t agreeTesla corrected - you all got a massive discount But the factories are opening in 60 days Soooo overvalued no! To the contrary Tesla now is undervalued and come may a bargain today Monkeys it is likely this year Tesla will produce 3.5 million cars with all factories going by the end of this year SAYONARA KIMOSABY

who all thinks it will yo up tomorrow?
Green soon. Tesla has a big future!

"Challenged by someone on this board to name a big company that's growing revenue as quickly as Tesla. It took me about 5 seconds to think of one:Salesforce. It's been growing revs at 30% yoy for years. It made $4.63/share in the year just ended, compared to TSLA's $2.23/share (non GAAP). CRM is priced at 1/4 TSLA's stock price and its valuation is 1/4 that of TSLAs. But it earns more than 2x as much. That, folks is a tech company. See. Even at tech company valuations, you're paying over 8x too much for this over-hyped dog."
Happy New Year from Uzbekistan. Thank you Elon Musk and all the people that work so hard in Tesla for making me so happy this year. All the best for everybody and their families. Wish you all the very best! 
going back up...the market can't pull this down
"Less than 3 months ago TSLA was under $400. Then the wild ascent to $900 recently. After shorts now smell blood based on missing on earnings, the trend during the next month will most likely take $864 to just under $700."
"SIFY Technologies LTD---What will be interesting will be the $ generated by the cloud for SIFY.Here is an excerpt from the upcoming earnings on MSFT:Microsoft (MSFT) will report its Q2 2021 earnings after the closing bell on Tuesday, and analysts and investors will zero in on the company’s cloud operations, as more businesses consider whether the pandemic-driven work-from-home environment is here to stay.Would this not apply to SIFY as well?

Just remember you all are comparing TSLA to Amazon. Amazon Took a dive after a huge runup and this will too. Read the charts. This is unsustainable and unrealistic growth.
Ky jelly is in every shorts glove box and medicine cabinet
In 10 hrs. TSLA increased in value more than GM and F's combined worth. ...?
Buying tesla stock is simply buying debt ... Because they're constantly issuing new shares and diluting the float. That's a ponzi scheme if I ever saw one.
scooping up 5 more shares as soon as the market open...
Cant fight this anymore. Tesla wins; even S&P had to include them after a delay. I might join the longs.
Up or down after earnings???

When musk emailed or twittered something it usually comes to fruition. So 500k cars are going to happen.
"Just a little brain work here. Tesla has only split once, a 5-1 deal Apple has split many times especially in the 1990’s. Most of the tech stocks have. If, let’s say Tesla goes above $1000. again if would benefit them to do another split to get the price down so that the average investor would be able to buy the stock. Not many people can or would spend hundreds for one share unless they have been investing for some time and built up monies. I remember Yahoo splitting 2-3 times in one year they went up so fast in price. Of course there would be more shares out but there aren’t that many shares issued.

"I bought Tesla stock because I test drove one 4 years ago. it is an insane car. I’ve since bought the X, 3 and Y. I traded the 3 in for the Y my son owns the S. Nothing beats first hand experience. Owning a Tesla has been the best car I’ve ever owned I’m 65 and between myself my wife and my 2 kids I’ve seen just about every make and model out on my Driveway. All were different from Mustangs to Chevy to Buick, Lincoln to Jeep, Mazda’s my first car ever back in 72 Mazda Rotary engine Rx2 wow that was a cool. I’ve owned them all.

"All Tesla potencial competitors are 2-3 or more years behind. In the meantime, Tesla will continue to develop and optimize the production process and new features and capabilities on his vehicles. Therefore it is reasonable to assume that this advantage will be maintained in the following years. Tesla will capture more market share not through price war but product technology substitution. This strategy is so robust that it is not crazy to think that Tesla will be a big player in the automobile industry in sales and profits."

"Evidence that Autopilot is Fraud?A new 4d radar with twice the Range. So Tesla is figuring out that there old hardware will not work.

I am not sure how that would be explained in court. Imagine the cost of retrofitting every car since 2016? They will never do it. I am going to speculate that FSD is 5 years away, not just for Tesla, but everyone. Too much liability for producers to assume.

"Why is are the general markets down hard, but Tesla is up? Because Tesla stock is not in a bubble, like the rest of the market. The worst you can say is that that Tesla is trading with high momentum. On the other hand, it's not up every day. I conclude that this rally is real and well supported."

"Tesla, welcome to the RED OCEAN. Everybody making EV cool cars!Bye Bye blue non-profit for years ocean."
Take a look at the price of GME. The price is what it is because enough of the little guys not only hold but keep on buying. It is called a short squeeze. There are plenty of shorts on this stock. Buy more and hold no matter what and the price will go up. This is only my opinion.
Today we will end under 800 USD...before big sell off within this week.Watch Bitcoin....today crushed...Tesla is a bubble as well.

This recall is nothing compared to Toyota which has recalled 1.5 million cars this year alone. As for 150 k EV recall is only occurring on cars made between 2016-2018 which Their USB or memory card needs to be replaced so the backup monitor can work probably. An easy fix and fast. No big deal.

I wonder how many newly minted millionaires did Tesla stock make this year? (Raises hand because I'm one of them)
"Well, the numbers are in for the TSLA short world. “.... mark-to-market short losses for Tesla totaled over $40 billion, as it was “far and away the most unprofitable trade in 2020 and had the largest yearly loss we have seen historically.”The bulls and the bears did battle in the pit with no holds barred. No one knows how it will play out for 2021. But even with the competition finally gearing up for a piece of the BEV market share it will challenge their resourcefulness. In one important sense Elon Musk has already won. His personal vision and purpose of acting as a catalyst for encouraging all players brought into being energy sustainable transportation. The biggest vehicle manufacturing entities in the world cannot ignore their altered renewables future. Some will, in their own fashion and innovation, carry the industry forward and prosper. The financial industry and its market’s own uniqueness will play their role since Wall Street’s early 19th century beginnings. Next year will certainly be exciting. Can hardly wait to see what lies ahead."

tsla the only thing ruining my portfolio today
PE of more than 1300......this is such big fraud I have never seen. Here in Europe and especially in Germany Tesla is low quality car which only some fanboys want to have. The shops are empty and it is a shame what bad quality Tesla is delivering with its cars. A friend of mine has boughtbone and he wants to buy once the timeline for the ev fee form the Fischs allows to sell without sanctions. The bubble will burst in a dramatic action never seen at WALLSTREET. Tesla will be pulverisied within a week.
"That last hour of trading was dope.I'd like to thank the cult for allowing me to make 50% on my calls bought Wednesday and sold yesterday morning and 90% on the calls I bought (with mostly from the profits from the previous trade) near the close yesterday and sold an hour or so into trading this morning. Btw, these were all weekly expiring today options. You can make a fortune with short term options if you make the right play.Will wait until Monday morning to load up on the next option play.Will it be calls or puts?Like Wtherealdouche does in his posts I'll divulge and make that decision after some Monday morning hindsight."

When TSLA was $50 a share people said company will collapse. Again when it was $100 people said it is inflated and will collapse. It went to $200 and the same messages. It went to $300 then $400 then $500 then $600 then $700 then $800 then $884 and they say it will collapse......I can't help but smile
TESLA CAR EXPLODES . STOCK AS well in a few hours time .
Long long way to fall still
"World auto production in 2019 was 91,786,861. Tesla, at their present margin ratios which would include the sale of regulatory credits, would need to sell every car in the world for 10 years to have a PE similar to Toyota. The Tesla market cap is absurd at best. Buy it now and you will pay a hefty price in the next few years."
New Tesla model s 10.000$ more expensive......They reduced their prices 4 times in 2020 to get rid of overstock . What a Joke !!
"Alright you Tesla shorters. How much money did you lose this week? Comon, tell the truth!"

I’m in love with this stock for the next 10 years
"TSLA had an amazing run and I am thankful for the profits I made, in my opinion, this is a good time to take profits and invest elsewhere with more growth potential in the stock price. Energy/battery has generally low profit margins, as well as auto production. Without the 1.6 billion in regulatory credits sales Tesla would have lost 900 million this year. And considering Tesla car sales in the next 20 years go to 20 million cars, which is 30% of annual global car sales (70 million total) and average profit margin in car production, they come up to 20 billion annual profit and with a normalized P/E in 20 years from now, 7-10, the cap is more around 140-200 billions. And I agree Tesla is a tech company...but as mentioned before energy has low profit margins. Which leaves self-driving tech, lots of tech out there involved with lots of competition, very tricky to see the outcome in 10-20 years from now...I will take my money to invest in new tech companies with the same stock price growth Tesla had when it was trading at $20 a few years ago...hoping for the same run we experienced in Tesla ;-) its not gonna jump 10-fold from here...but there are other stocks to come and out there it will....Good luck everyone on both sides of the aisle ;-)"

The Max pain is $440, with 3x as many puts as calls. What does this all mean? I have no idea, but I think it means that lots of contracts are in the money and those contracts will be exercised this week. The recent run up is likely due to the purchasing of shares to cover these contracts? While the massive bets against the stock likely mean we are in for a wild week. Any option experts out there have any idea what these crazy numbers mean for real?"

Tomorrow it will be Red. It will touch 650 for sure. Because it went way high too soon.
"It was on May 1, 2020, when Elon Musk tweeted Telsa's stock is ""too high imo"" when the price was a little above $150 ($750 pre-split).What has changed since then? Well, TSLA has raised about $20 in cash, mostly by getting investors to pay higher prices for its stock. That works out to about $20/share."

"Elon quickly did the secondary offering of $5billion in the market at this price because he knows that it is the top. If he think it is going tobe 780 or 800 , then he will not be leaving additional 1 Billions on the table. So I think we are at the fair price now. It could go a bit lower.

"My average is $350, never selling my Tesla shares"
Is this the right time to buy TSLA????????
Didn't musk say last week 50% sales growth this year? In reporting there is going to be NO EV competition for Tesla in the next 18 months. When Musk has competition from Ford and Fisker finally manufacturing then it might be time to take some profits. But come on. Less of the amateur dramatics.
Thumbs up for $900 today. Thumbs down for below $800.
"Musk promised to reveal a ""slightly"" modified version of the Cyber Truck in November, that would be road legal in the U.S. and the E.U., meet projected performance criteria, and sell for $39,995. He stated it would also be a tad smaller than the broken window version. It's January, 2021, Elon...."
Are everyone here using Margin to keep adding. Not sure where such billions of dollar coming into market. Almost sound like too good tobe true. If you guys using overextended Margin buying power be careful. This can go reverse in no time and none of those analyst will come to defend stock either.Look at Zoom Since it go 580 and reverse. When it reach 550 bunch of analyst upgrade price target pushing 580 but since then they hardly coming to defend and stock now 345 and their bounce last less than 1 day.
Enjoy watching how TSLA is climbing the only EV Tech manufacturer exist now! Can someone guess what TSLA stock price need to be in order to have market cap $1 Trillion. Thanks
Another day in Fantasy Land!!!
For me it's clear. Tesla sells illusions. Good luck to all. I'm shocked about the complete lack of self-reflection in Elon's personality. I believe 100% that he had the intention of building this ponzi knowing his company would never be able to create value over a longer time frame.

Wow this is the best stock deal going. Probably 10x after this incredible earnings beat
Will gap up play around 600 for a bit then pullback and struggle to close above 600 today. Mark it
"Tesla just reported they will announce 4Q earnings on 1/27! Knowing that 4Q deliveries was their highest ever, what do you think earnings will report?"
I live in Belgium . BMW and Audi are coming strong into the EV market in Europe .Lots of commercials in the streets and tv adds . Huge competition in 2021 for Tesla. Believe me !!
Time for long/short for the year Short TSLA / Long AAPL ???
WHO. IS. BUYING. TESLA. AT. $773???????
Better Cover quick Shorty we see you and going to buy it Hard..
"THis is Massively overpriced. Crazy stuff. But you know the saying, the market can remain IRRATIONAL longer than you can stay SOLVENT. But the pumpers really need to learn a hard lesson. I wonder what will be the catalyst?"
how's earnings looking? $1000 next week?
"Soon we will be looking at 4th qtr report. Unless there are surprises, TSLA should deliver astounding number of cars and stellar earning report...Wall Street will tells us exactly like it is, just the fact and no #$%$....I personally believe it will ride the wave to all time highs again despite shorties sentiments, and they are just sentiments - the glass half empty sentiments...I know that riding this wave for the last 2.5 years... always the same time... good luck everyone, not just longs... because the shorts will really need it!"
"Thought I'd check out this stock. P/S and P/B through the roof....ROE (management effectiveness) a paltry 5.59% along with minimal EPS. It looks like a house of cards ponzi scheme.

Just hope you aren't a bag holder when the hype peaks and the selling starts. I'm not shorting the stock. I'm just not buyin' it. There's just too many safer profitable growth stocks out there with better fundamentals to invest in..."
I’m buying March 1250 calls also
Every time TSLA goes up 50% and then drops 10% the haters act like they've won.Someone needs to explain to me the math on that.
These analysts are not very smart. Some worry about the competition with $TSLA . Do they think the whole Chinese market for EV is tiny? Do they not see all of Asia and the rest of the world wanting and having government mandates to switch to EV? These NIO and TESLA are YEARS ahead of the other big auto players.
If I buy now. In two months it will be worth 2400! Not a bad investment
WOT - Canada is expanding the Trans Mountain Pipeline Cancelling the XL pipeline hurts US refineries and creates long term potential for ocean oil spills. There is no reduction in CO2 emissions. In fact there is an increase because oil will be shipped by tankers to Asia. But the pipeline haters feel good. That's what matters.
That really was a punk quarterly report. Negative earnings except for transfer payments from other car companies. Declining margins. Batteries too expensive to make a sellable semi.
"Heres my prediction...based on gut alone. TESLA will hit 1100 next week, based on hype, then dip back to approx 1000 by Friday,"
"It's time. Yesterday it couldn't go below 645 so there's no downside trend. Most likely, today will be a big breakout. When it can break $690 then it's straight a way to $700+"
Absolutely unbelievable. What is the news to drive this up like this today?
"with Joe in office your gonna see RED EVERY DAY! RED, RED, RED . you'll be begging the donald to come back."

you realize that this priced larger than the entire auto industry that also makes electric cars and actually has significant earnings. what is actually funny is that musk became the richest man from a company that since its ipo has lost just under 10 billion dollars. but they've sold lots of stock so i guess that's what matters in todays market.
"Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned employees about the risks of a collapse in the company's stock, writes CNBC, noting that the actual profitability of the enterprise is very low, about one percent over the past year.In early 2020, Tesla temporarily cut salaries of some employees and laid off some employees after checking their effectiveness."
Shorts are on the greed is the root of all evil plan. They are all in. The addiction is real.
"Buy, Buy, Buy!!!"
im Long with my 420 shares got lucky bought in last January before split. Now my average cost is 158.00 per share.

"Tim Seymour, the best person on Wall Street, feels the stockway over valued."
The big gains are over until TSLA can provide something of substance..
"many say no, but i feel there is a direct correlation with these short squeezes and the futures bleeding red. any thoughts?"
"Sold at 850. Maybe I did the right thing, maybe I didn't. I'm fine either way. I hope one way or another, we all have a profitable year in the market overall."
When amazon had a PE ratio of 3700 it’s stock price was......wait for it......$250.
It’s just the market...Apple had the best earnings report and they’re down 3%!
$2000/ share makes as much sense as $870This market has no link to reality.
its so scary how fast telsa drops
this is the beginning of Tesla's downward sales and NIO ramping up!Tesla is the American NIO!!!
absolutely positively do not sell one single share of your position!!!!!!!
Yeah... Because some electric car/ battery maker with 270 mil in revenue should be worth 2 Walmarts. GTFO
"Tesla Berlin will get the go ahead, but at a price. Don't yet know what that'll be, but incensed German's get pretty charged up (and vindictive). I live between Boston and Munich and this is a big story in Germany.Politicians can't let (what they regard as) Tesla hubris go unpunished. They could restrict water supply, which certainly would reduce output. They could also charge Tesla exorbitant annual fees for a myriad of violations. Germans also see the $323 million annual lease that Tesla pays China just to set up shop there, and they feel a bit had. I think next month's ruling will probably irk a lot of Tesla investors (and it won't help Tesla's valuation either)."

"Since Tesla already sold future ZEV credits to bulk up past quarters, and others are now sell BEV so they won't need to buy Tesla's credits, plus Tesla dropped prices worldwide, does anyone predict a profit for Q4? They might pull more financial tricks, but reality will catch up."
"Today's gain is more then GM is worth,,,think abt that."
"I know so many people who want in on Tesla or to increase their positions, if it goes down, people will just buy more, I’m not worried."
The S&P 500 index fundsfinished buying their shares weeks ago using their other non index funds who would be allowed to do this then they transfered the shares internally on Monday. It would have been the smart thing to do. And the behavior of the stock supports this. Otherwise it would have spiked up on Monday. I suspect that a lot of people lost money buying calls because they imagined that the index funds would buy everything at once on Monday. I am sure that they had this figured out months ago. These people know what they are doing.

"Underboat/Capri aren't you tired of being right all the time?Lets step back and take a look at your genius:A.

Calling for the worst stock market collapse in 90 years, excuse me 91 years after the election.C. Saying you will leave the board, you couldn't even call that right and you completely control it.We will see about RDHL, but your track record is not just bad, but all time historically bad.

"PE Ratio 1,366.97. Not too good of value at these sky rocketed prices. Was at 1,000 pre-split not too long ago, now it's at 5,005 post-split. Looks like a cult stock that makes no real sense in evaluation."
"No one mentions that Tesla yesterday presented refreshed S and X. Totally new interior, refreshed exterior Deliveries available from September in Europe! Tesla X plaid"
"The inflection point of S curve will start in 2022 where EV adoption will increase exponentially and Tesla will have Giga factories Berlin and Austin up and running. We should see a big price jump to $1500 by then if not sooner.Longs, keep thinking long, stay calm and enjoy the ride up. Happy comfortable retirement. Cheers"

Lol. Elon tweets about GME and people sell TSLA to buy GME.
"Shorts are attacking , buy more and hold , anything associated with elon will be worth lot more . Buying mood"
So the biggest Bubble in US history gets even bigger with the Tesla Ponzi leading the way.
C’mon Shorts! We need your help getting to $900!
Any Idea if it's gonna go over 550 or it's gonna sell-off ?
And if you do your homework to see how many out of 17 million are sold under 25k you would be shocked to think tsla will make profit.
"I'd pay good money to be able to beech slap some of the Negative Nellies who are running around on this forum shouting how Tesla shares are too high & that the sky will fall because of it!If you Negative Nellies think Tesla is too high then go buy another stock which you think is ""cheaper"". I hear Amazon is a bargain at only $3200 a share!"
Tesla reports today and all anyone talking about is GameStop and AMC
"Sad to see so much negative towards a company with a goal for better future not just for ""Bulls"", ""Bears"", but for all. Yet so much people want it to fail. We get it it is overvalued, but this let's Tesla do what they are good at and this is for the good of our future"

"Since Gordon Johnson is getting some air time from Yahoo Finance today, I thought I would repost a message I wrote last month to refresh our memory of Gordon Johnson's background.Gordon Johnson is getting some air time today talking TSLA down unsuccessfully. Since he put his crudential in Linkedin, I reviewed it today.It's interesting, he has been at every company he worked for about 2 years (3 for1 year each, and 3 for 2 year - covering health industry and chip industry), and then he had worked at Axiom as a managing director for 10 years (covering material science). So I would say he would specialize in material science as he has not done so for health and chip for more than 10 years. He has no experience in automotive industry, neither does he have any experience in AI and Datascience. He has been in his CEO position for barely a year. Now I understand he has a credibility issue, no one believes him. If I were buying research report, I would not buying from him.From the nature of his CEO position, he is just selling research on the company he covers. I am really not sure how he gets the funding to short it, I think he is probably shorting it himself. Another word, I think he is full of it. For those of you who might be skeptical with what I say, go look it up on his Linkedin Profile as it is public."
"The novelty of Elon Musk us wearing off. Bored with him, bored with his stock."

I am thinking 888
"@Musk - Here's an idea: Seeing as Apple would like to infringe on your EV turf, how about a smart phone that puts customers first? One that doesn't track us and sell our privacy out to advertisers? We currently have two options in Apple and Google, neither of which put customer's privacy first. Elon Musk has saved the environment with electric cars, and saved the space industry with reusable rockets ... Save humanity with privacy respecting smart phones!

If deliveries exceed 500k we blow past 700 and touch the mid 900s
A good entry here if you want to invest in Tesla. I foresee it going to 1000 before they release their earning
tesla will cross 1000usd after q4
Will be interesting to see how this this stock will do if there is 1:4 split now.. shorts will be happy and so is JPM
I’ll add more at $1200

"Big disappointment.... pe of 1300 and such bad disappointing numbers. Will be crashed on Monday. Might be hammered to 500 usd if investors want save their profits. These number shows that Tesla stock, not Tesla cars, is a big fraud. Cars have only bad qualilty due to European standards. Growing competition and new battery competitors like apple, quantum, Samsung sdi will care for the biggest drop of Tesla stocks. I have recommended more times to sell. Who now is still invested, will get the consequences. Hope I can buy some puts in Europe on Monday morning, when markets opens."
this significantly lowers production costs in improves delivery times.
Looking for a used car and there are quite a few Teslas for sale with high depreciation rates.
"Contrary to the expectations of the Bears, over the last 24 months TSLA has demonstrated that it can make a profit making an electric car in competition with the gasoline cars made by the major automakers. But the challenge remains for TSLA to show that it can still make a profit when it has to compete with all the models of electric cars which will be coming on the market in the next 24 months and when it will no longer be able to sell its EV credits for such large amounts. The next challenge will be for TSLA to show that it can take substantial market share while still being profitable.If TSLA sold 30 million vehicles a year and netted $1000 profit on each, it would make $30 billion/year.That's the dream. But can TSLA sell as many as million vehicles/year profitably by 2023?Time will tell. It's easy enough to grow rapidly when there is no competition in the EV market. But, the competition is coming."

"I can never understand in a trading market why those with huge profits don't take at least part of their profit. This is beyond a fear of missing out. Tesla is not for sale, I don't think. Elon Musk is the company, he's the pioneer, the innovator....I get all that. I just don't get parabolic moves, 11 straight days of gains, from $650 to over $850 in 2 weeks! Yes, 2 weeks of trading. Yes, I missed this, No I'm not short, but I'm tempted. I want to hear from rational, experienced traders: Where does Tesla's stock price go from here? Does it go to $1,000 ($5,000 pre split), or does it correct back to $700 or less soon?"

$BRLL anytime you have .02 stock and they announce news that they are getting in the #Lithium game and just 18 miles from name dropped $TSLA gigafactory... its a HOMERUN.
The smart guys just bought your cheaper shares...so funny to watch the panic. Watch and learn as the orders pour in at close.
That is a massive miss holy sheeet 500Coming
So Apple announces it is putting money into Detroit and Altana. Both big Auto Manufacturing sites. How long before we hear of the acquisition or partnership? Already greasing the palms for the preferential treatment once they start building EVs . Tesla no longer has a lead or an advantage. Mark my words there will be no TESLA by 2030. Just like the Tucker and the DeLorean once looked promising the powers that be didn't let it happen then and they will not now.
"After reading hundreds of posts on this board, I've come to realize the question is not whether Tesla is overvalued, but whether the stock price will keep going up."
hopefully today -5% so lot of buyer with big leverage got margin call
You can tell what kind of investor is in Tsla..... all the little robinhooders posting their cartoons.
"My advice if you long book most of profit. you can always buy back if this bubble continue after earning. At best it can jump 10% which any normal day it can go up or down. On other end down side if it really upset, it can drop 30%"
"Tesla just manufacturing and selling BEVs, huh? Want to speed up the acceleration on your Model Y? It’s a click on the Tesla upgrade option. Boosts 0-60 from 4.8 to 4.2 seconds. Only cost you $2,000 to download. That amazing proprietary program was written long ago and is one of many many cash cows for Tesla. It’s like an HP printer that two of its HP refills cost more than a new printer. They’re in the cartridge business. Never underestimate Elon Musk."
Without Government subsidies Tesla would have lost money in the Q4 2020. Tesla's business model relies on Government subsidies.
remember S&P owned hedge funds and institutions own a TON of these now. They can sell and affect prices A LOT unlike before being included in S&P
"Now the investors who took the shorts to the cleaners in $GME can now afford $TSLA, and will buy a ton of $TSLA to take the shorts to the cleaners again. Thumbs up if that is you."
((( China's finance ministry has reduced the subsidies for electric vehicles (EVs) for 2021 by 20% )))This would tend to create a small spike in December 2020 sales followed by a tough in January 2021.
"Do we hear $1,000?"

"Should you invest in Tesla? Nearly 500,000 cars delivered in 2020, 20 million projected in 2024. So many more catalysts will drive stock for many many years. Personally, I can’t afford to miss this starship that’s about to take off into a different stratosphere The world as we know it is exponentially changing and Tesla is the leader."
Elon posted on Twitter the battery assembly line in Texas
"tsla is coming with the new radar system, are the owners of the older models getting the hardware upgrade? Did I pay for something thay I can't use or have to pay for upgrade again?"
Tesla shorts:
What a fun week! Enjoy this weekend long fellas
My average cost for TSLA is $ 52 and watched so many people predicting Tesla collapse. I smile
"I need to buy more tomorrow before it hits $1000. Let’s face it ,Tesla’s not your ordinary stock. It will continue to impress people high up and yes there will be the haters and jealous people. I say to them like I did before the split, come join us ,it’s definitely not to late. We are going to have the younger people investing in this stock and I only wish I was 18 again. TESLA STRONG."
"This has made me pretty rich. Thanks, Elon."
Reversion to the mean will continue Monday morning.
"The math doesn't add up on this claim without knowing the exponential curve they are using.I think we kind of talked about that true. I mean essentially, what we're saying is that the number to think about or focus on is like we've got a 100 gigawatt-hour total Tesla cells produced in 2022. It's not that important to look at the run up to that because -- but these things tend to improve exponentially. But we are installing capacity for -- in 2022 for 200 gigawatt hours a year and we think probably we should be able to achieve 30% of targeted design capacity in 2022."
Compare AAPL's super high PE to TSLA it would make TSLA valued at $21.25 (over 40 times the speculative value compared to APPL). TSLA is a great company but way overpriced at $880. Protect your gains and capital. For the first time I just shorted TSLA. At minimum 600s is on the near horizon.
Earnings Beat! 
Come on kids everyone knows that Elon is much better at cooking the books than building oddball cars.
Alot of shorts sitting at home kicking themselves cause they thought they were going to get this at a 15% discount keep dreaming shorts.
"For everyone stating the post inclusion crash is coming... you must be delusional. I’m not getting in to debates about fraud, valuations, or bubbles but ask yourself this... do you think that all the pension funds, insurance companies, annuity policies, life insurance policies, 401k accounts, and every other retirement account type in the world will let this drop. It’s officially too big to fail now AND they have over 10B in cash on their balance sheets - biggest concern from a year ago is that they would run out of cash. No way this crashes. No way. Even if it should, the vested interest now HAS to keep it inflated or everyone becomes the bag holder. My bets have been and continue to not fight the trend and to not get caught up in the debate. I’m fine following the trend and cashing in along the way. Don’t be emotional, just get on board and profit till the story changes. Dec31 700, Jan31 760, feb 900 options is the path to profit."
Doing the smile today.
"200 day moving average is still under $400/share. An indication of how fast this stock has climbed.It's also relevant to Musk's 2018 option grant. He as a way to go to earning all of the 12 option grants but, it looks likely he will soon have earned the first 8. The 8th requires annualized adjusted EBITDA of $14.0 billion. There's a chance he will have that award with Board certification after the 4th quarter earnings release.Even if the stock drops from here, the past momentum makes it likely TSLA will soon all of the market cap requirements for future awards as the top level is only $650 billion."
"Facebooks earnings is more than Tesla’s revenue or approximately the same, yet tsla is worth about the same as Facebook!FB earnings ~= TSLA revenue"
My advice is that don’t bet against Tesla because it’s a killer shark.
"what mistakes could Tesla do next?-low profit or loss because high expenditures for all new Gigafactories (Berlin, Texas, China)-slower ramp up than expected-Full self Driving not before 2022-more competitors like VW, who can easily build and sell more than 10x of cars than Tesla now-more innovativ batterie technology of competitors like Quantumscape with better energy density and especially safer operation. solid state batteries block inherent fire spreadingDid I forget something?"
"NIO investors will digest the $TSLA miss and, coupled with analyst upgrades and Jan deliveries, this will move higher in early Feb. $70 over next two weeks."
Ok Elon...time to tweet about Tesla
I'd like to re-invest in Tesla. Do you think that it'll dip early this week? What's a good entry point this week? Thanks!
Just remember index funds cannot sell - so it will be between long and shorts!
"Just for fun -->2018 US sales ==== 191,627 *2019 US sales ==== 192,250 *2020 US sales==== 202,274 * Tesla is not growing. They merely expanded into China with a lower cost domestically built car."
I am down over $3k. Will this go back up tomorrow?
I am amazed this stock has the big market cap . They could produce every car for the next 20 years and not justify the current valuation.

"Many believe that sell side analysts like the guy at Wedbush rate companies based on the agenda of his investment bank, rather than the real fundamental story. In Europe, Tesla is getting pummeled by the EV competition from major players like VW and Renault. Sales in the U.S. are not great, yet this analyst is incessantly cheerleading future prospects for the very competitive China market. Then with overbought conditions (a move from $400 to $850 in 8 weeks, an RSI at 80) he's still raising the price target. It's irresponsible for traders, and many will be sorry they listened to the Wedbush analyst and bought at the top."
"This will hit 1k tomorrow just on Bidens speech. Up coming earnings we hit 1250, future stock split coming 10:1 (making this 125) then rinse and repeat. 2T market cap by EOY! Mark my words NOW! Cause I said so"

TSLA should look into RMO batteries for their semi trucks. RMO is already supplying batteries to Lion Electric for their Semi and school buses..
there were so many articles supporting shorts in the past two weeks... That make short army so bigger and bigger ... but as I see that was the institutions tricks. We will see the shorts push TSLA go over 1000 after earning report. Good for the longs!

tsla is the best investment I've ever made
Why does he sound childish and unsure?
Once this baby break 800 which it will happen soon it will run like a train to 1000 fueled by mega profits of quarter 4 on Jan 21. Hint : when stock hit 1000 that will be just 50% increase since the start of this year and all of us are predicting 600% increase this year alone which it will translate to 4200 after split but split will happen this year when we hit 2000 by august this year( 5-1) which translate to More shares and more profits. Finally: Tesla will hit 1 trillion money cap at 3500 tag price after split and ofcourse Elon will be the richest man in the world without any near competition
"Gordon Johnson is saying Ford, GM, and other ICE companies sold more than 500,000 cars in a month. Tesla most likely sold more than 500,000 EVs this year. BUT Gordon doesn't tell you how many EVs Ford, GM, and other ICE companies sold this year!!! LMAO"
Tried to listen to their presentation. But it was just too painful. Just utterly incoherent. The bit at the beginning was especially odd where Musk started to suggest it was just about possible to justify the current valuation. I do think this could go quite a bit lower as the obvious well become obvious.
Congratulations to all new and existing Teslanaires 
Future will open in 1 hour 12 min. I will be watching S&p future.
All These big hedge funds are selling off their super high flyers like Tesla to raise capitol on losing short bets and it will keep dropping and triggering stop sell orders this has just begun to crash This will be reviewed and sold off to match its real Valuation around $60 pps
The lesson taught to novice investors in GME et al bodes well for the future with millions of new private investors taking power away from the institutionalised hedge funds...

"Great earning coming up $1500 by summer, over 2k and another stock split in oct 5/1. Rinse Ann’s repeat for the next 4years there’s no stopping this monster "
"A month ago, TSLA reached a new high below $700. Since then, it has gone up with no positive news, just the blind hope for an exceptional earnings report, or, more probably, some new promises for the future from Elon. Neither has happened. There is just no excuse for this stock to be above $700 even if you thought it was really worth more than $600 back in December. And the only reason for it moving up to the $600's from the low $400's back in November is the technical issue of inclusion in the S&P 500 which forced certain funds to buy TSLA even though it was already shamefully overpriced.We haven't seen anything like a real drop in this stock yet. A most a correction, not a Bear market.Even crediting that Musk and TSLA make NO mistakes over the next 3 years and that the projected EPS is 10 times actual 2020 GAAP earnings, that's only $6.40/share fully diluted. GM has made as much money while trading in the $30's.Un reasoning mob mentality may prevail over the short run, but, eventually most members of the mob come to a point where they will stop and think for themselves. The pump and dumper what you to believe you should never sell, because that leaves plenty of time for them to dump before the price really crashes."
"Ironic, Tesla will have to buy VW batteries through QuantumScape if they are going to be competitive in two to three years. Bill Gates, also a big investor, who Musk has often showed little respect, will probably enjoy seeing Musk beg for batteries. Quantumscape cracked the code. They will control the patents. Going to be fun watch this wither the next two years. Might be next 2 months. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bill-gatesbacked-electric-car-battery-startup-is-on-the-cusp-of-changing-the-industry-184517860.html"

Adam Jonas who couldn't predict TSLA 1 year out ($10 price target pre-split) is making predictions about 2030. And the market cares. Wow.
What happened? Put on your seatbelts folks! There was a wide sell off at 11:05 all EV stocks
TSLA is where Amazon is 10 years ago. The valuations make sense to me now once you understand that model. People keep saying PE and all that. It doenst matter. Look at all tech companies. They are all price to sales of above 50X. TSLA price to sales should be at least 30X MIN as its a softweare as a service company. NOT A CAR COMPANY.

Despite the extraordinary run in the share price, we continue to believe that Tesla can outperform vs. our sector in 2021. In our opinion, Tesla is still the best positioned company in EVs and AVs under our coverage due to its people, its technology, business model and access to capital. Furthermore, it is important to note that the company has no entanglement with the environmental liabilities that burden its legacy competition. Put it all together and we believe Tesla's business model can unlock recurring mobility services revenue faster and more profitably than the competition. We struggle to find a more innovative company with the ability to execute against the high degree of difficulty inherent in sustainable transportation and energy at scale. We reckon it's a rather short list."""

"Elon loves to decimate shorts, next week he will be back to work!'"
"US energy market is $800 billion a year, worldwide it's trillions, and TSLA is going to take it like a storm."
A Tesla Stock Poem:Irrational exuberance time. Might be similar to Cisco stock in 1999. Excellent company but crazy stock price. Possible stock crash would not be nice. Electric vehicle mania is here. The bubble will pop soon I fear. When it pops nobody knows but enjoy the bubble while it grows.
"Congratulations bag holders. Tesla PE ratio now over 2000. If your get yourself cryogenically frozen, in 2000 years you will have enough earnings to pay for that one share."
Homes around Austin where Tesla in moving to skyrocked in price by 35 percent.
Nio just announced in China that even though the Chinese govt is reducing EV subsidies by 20% in 2021(which buy the way does not help TSLA) it will match the 2020 subsidy through Jan 10th by giving extra incentives...the competitive landscape heats up and will eat at TSLA profits like every other car company in the world that operates on single digit margins...2021 will be a very rocky year for TSLA especially at the current valuation...
"Anyone have an objective opinion on Michael Burry heavily shorting this stock? Doesn’t that concern anybody? No, I am not a troll. Truly asking."
Tesla Inc TSLA.O edged up 0.3% after a report that the electric-car maker will start operations in India early next year. For more hot stocks like (TSLA) just go to (http://trade-view.com).
This stock is the store against inflation. not bitcoin. Tesla stock is the new worlds currency.
"Michael Burry, whose lucrative wager on the US housing bubble's collapse in 2007 was captured in ""The Big Short,"" said he expected Tesla stock to implode in a similar fashion."
Shorts have lost a total of $50 billion since 2020 started... Tulips 2.0
"Yahoo shows close at $695, CNBC at $658, Fidelity $658.Where's the $695 coming from?"
What do we think is going to happen after earnings report? massive dip?
"I keep thinking about the guy who lost $440,000 by betting on the bills yesterday, Tesla would have been a much better bet."
"This little dip, shorties, is the last signal Wall Street is giving you to cover before the huge rally.Take advantage of it, will you?"
"America rewards inventors, support Elon."
"Billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya says GameStop's rally is no different than how Wall Street missed out on Tesla's surge,Yes Gamestop may be a better value than Tesla. Although they rise in a similar fashion."
I bought a share at 628 and 300 worth of fractional shares.
"Lord Jesus!I am not a holder nor a hater. But, this is fun to watch!I personally think it will crash before the year ends. Eventually, TSLA's financial statement will need to show SOMETHING to prove that its products/services are that valuable. I keep hearing that ""It's going to be more than a car company"".... Yea, Ok. But as of right now it's JUST a car company. Mind you, it's a car company that makes its profits from selling credits.Anyway, I hope none of my fellow retail investors lose a material amount of money over this!"
Will it split again??? So high
"Go Tesla!Tesla sold 5,798 Model 3s in the United Kingdom in December. This eclipsed the Volkswagen Golf, the second-place vehicle, by 1,328 units. The Ford Fiesta, the top seller in the UK for 2020, finished third for the month, with 3,367 units sold."
Why does Yahoo finance always feel thy need to interview Gordon Johnson. Has he ever been able to say anything that has actually happened.
Anyone holding this might want to get the heck out fast.....this is going to plummet
Hey guys! What time is the Report?
900 within a month?
Stay strong and hold Tesla folks.
"EV is like cannabis. The hype was high until the market was flooded with overwhelming oversupply. The stocks crashed. The same will happen with Tesla market cap, which tops the worlds 9 largest car makers combined. Target 67 $ by 2021 year end."
"I'm already racking too much $$$, so guys, can someone advise me as to what level should I come in - 90 or 50 per share?"
Take volume last 7 sessions . Appx : 25 million shares traded which very low compared with Appx : 43 million shares tradedConclusion : Not much appetite on the buying side.This stock is going down. I tell you !!
Elon Musk’s Space X just recovered the same Falcon 9 orbital booster for it’s 8th time. Think he’s capable of creating a successful BEV.
Are we simply seeing a small price correction after hitting new highs last week?
"TSLA has priced their model Y under competition...not good for margins...BTW, competition will not just sit there and wait but will cut their price as well which will cause TSLA to have to cut their price again....this is the auto industry....rough business....long term downtrend coming..."
"Tesla will never go down during my life time..! Best stock ever. Next stop, the moon"
IN AH 821 $
AUTO Makers paid appx 1.6 Billion $ to Tesla in 2020 on regulatory emissions. Tesla is losing money each and every quarter if you take out these regulatory emissions.This is about to end in 2021 because worldwide car makers are massively offering EV cars.My opinion is that by mid 2021 Tesla will get back into negative earnings due to less earnings due to emissions and huge competition in EV market. EV cars in 2017 was 17 models. EV cars in 2021 is 60 models and many more coming.Conclusion for stockholders = Sell
The biggest speculative bubble in our lifetime is about to popI wouldn’t be holding Tesla stock. It’s like musical chairs Time to get your chair
"A mather of miniutes, hours or days for meltdown of Tesla Stockprice ."
"The Tesla stock at 20 (mind you that's 1/33th of the current price) has still more than double of VW's P/E and VW is paying dividends and starts the sell of the ID4 beginning next week in Europe. In the US sales already began in September. So Musk can now come up with another deflection from the bubble by promising India is the next big thing. People who have traveled the world a bit would know that that market isn't exactly one made for premium automakers. No, Tesla isn't a car for a factory worker in India."
"Any cult members see all of the (100's of) Form 4's on the SEC portion of the tesla investor relation website?I mean upper management is selling all of their stock right and left. They can't sell fast enough.Everyone is dumping it.Wait what was I thinking. Of course the cult hasn't seen it. They just look for the fluffy clouds, rainbows and unicornexcrement in their own imagination."
"Fk this market crash due to $TSLA $GME $AMC scams, $NIO is the only stock which moved and moves always and only on fundamentals and is still heavily undervalued. This is the only real deal in whole EV business, the one and only revolution of nothing less than the driving experience, the only owner of the future multi trillion dollar data/ev/robotaxi business of future chinese market – the biggest in world."
tsla soon coming up with phone that will integrate with their cars and you may be able to drive the car remotely ....

Just the start of the crash. Michael Burry doesn't miss on shorting stocks.
Good job fam! Will go even higher after earnings. I'm so excited.
More stimulus checks and ppp are getting pumped into TSLA. Absolutely guaranteed $1000 in January. Expect a similar rise after like the March stimulus generated. 5-6 fold gain soon.
"Tesla partners with Samsung on new 5nm chip for full self-driving, report saysGood luck and GOD bless,"
"one idea: Tesla-shareholder might sell some and switch to Nikola Motors ?! Tesla would not have sold cars if they would not have the super-charger-network....Nikola is building the hydrogen-infrastructure in advance to all the trucks, busses and later cars powered by hydrogen so the business model is similar but hdydron is by far the better energy solution over time than a battery....."
The long excitement for tomorrow is palpable ... go Tesla! 
going back ?
Wedbush raised price target to $950!
"We are not fazed with head fakes, because we know the institutions will be joining us soon. Stock supplies will be limited. We have been through the worst hurricane the last 2 years, you don’t think we can weather this small storm?"
"There is no ""EV-Revolution"" $Tsla (Elon) is a freak stealing billions of dollars like trevor Milton while sinking some of the money into an already failing upscale process. Exploding cars, bad service, blaming customers, ugly design tin can like quality, thats testla. Old manufacturers will easily catch up with this company cause there is nothing unique to make entering the key business severe or impossible. And it is the quiet similar same case with $Xpev, $li, $kndi, $fsr, $lucid ($cciv) etc.This Tulip mania based on future expections for companys which will not exist. Never exist, because there is no demand for this kind of products. These companies are especially in china LUCKY because of the Subsidies. But we are about to enter a new episode in China with less subsidies and more need to Demand created through intrinsic motivation - the normal behaviour of humans.Only $NIO works on this issue, only $NIO is creating right before our eyes a whole new industry to create the demand with intrinsic motivation through building a big intrinsic brand value, a lifestyle Brand with many products beside of the EV aspect and a lifestyle brand many services beside of the ev aspect with building battery as a service industry, an autonomic drive as a service industry, a safety as a service industry - quite similar to ADAC in Europe and and and ....what do the others? Selling trash, compared to $NIO and once the demand in china is not statecontrolled anymore, NIO will outpoint its unique position on all spheres in this run. Even old manufacturers who trying to catchup with the ev startups will have to rethink their strategy in case of NIO because all of this things NIO is doing are cumulated the reinvention of the driving expirience quite similar to how steve jobs changed the world with the smartphone revolution. Dont blame me like many of you freaks now when the cliff fall of all of your stocks begins to remaining again while NIO remains standing strong and rising unlike the others."
EVs are a fad at this stage of the game. The major portion of electric to charge them still comes from fossil fuels. The only way EVs will be sustainable and worth value is if they become 100% solar. Even if that was possible today Big Oil will not permit it to happen. Research the Fish Carburetor.
Last month they had a similar upgrade when this was at about $560 and has gone up almost 35% in one month. Should easily top $800 this week. Keep buying and be rewarded.
Musk says semis are ready except for batteries. They cost so much a Tesla semi cannot compete in the marketplace. So Tesla has invented a truck in theory that cannot be sold in practice.
"Bitcoin is dropping, TSLA is dropping too. Same retail investor profile."
I posted yesterday that $nnox is destined for an epic short squeeze due to high hard to borrow rates of 65-75%. I said that this will happen if it break 55.. I am much better than Tony miller with his nonsense conspiracy theory. Where is my like guys? LOL.. $tsla of imaging. This will be 100 minimum with fda clearance! Congrats long!!
EVGO IPO spac. Putting charging stations in shopping centers. Charge while u shop. Studies prove that if u build charging stations people will be more secure about buying ev’s. I don’t know if I believe that. I was under the impression that people are secure about buying ev’s. It will also take F and GM a while to get their ev’s out. Tesla is more than an ev company.
"Just remember $TSLA never went straight up back in 2015-2017 it was a very rocky road of scepticism for the public over EV future. But not today. Those who stuck it out with $TSLA were rewarded , some would say, beyond belief. Same is envisioned with $NIO and it will happen ... you can count on that so steady wins the race. Patient investors will be handed value from Impatient investors Remember we are not just producing EV but Smart EV in the day and age of AI and ML being infused into every industry the leaders like William Li know how to navigate For you that have bought above 40 you will be 10 bagging if you are even slightly patient. For us others who bought sub 5 ... well we can just help support the future investors in this company and industry GLTA. see everyone in Netherland"
$753 ah close ain’t too bad folks! What do you guys think sharties? Does 100k orders in 10hrs worry you? Have you seen the FSD in action lately? Can you see the full picture? Or are you still convinced that it’s just a run of the mill auto company that doesn’t have solar and the best batteries around? My advice to all the shortie pants is to guzzle a few bottles of teslaquila. It might take away the pain for a bit. While the longs enjoy a nice glass of bubbles! Cheers!
If this share price is so high then where are the short sellers to bring it down?They loved shorting this stock to the max when it was around $200 pre-split but here at $3900+ now no?Why aren't they teeing off on this?
"As a university student what I learnt in my trading course is once a stock gets added to the S&P 500 (especially one as significant as Tesla) we tend to see a shock increase on the announcement date as people want to front run institutions and index funds when they buy to add on the CD date (dec 21). Based on this I bought on the announcement date. Haven’t sold, locked in the gains from the post announcement drift and sold for a massive gain. Now sold today. Based on this logic I expect the price to decline on Monday as historically happened on CD date. Heavy volume though. Let’s see if this is true on Monday!"
Is Musk still the richest person? If not why isn't the media reporting it like it did when he became?
I sat on the fence for 3 weeks about joining (http://Fairstox.com) for their weekly picks. Big mistake. TSLA exploded and I completely missed out. Don’t make the same mistake I made. Join them today.
"The following applies to a single day, Monday. If SP is $800 at end of week, that doesn’t prove the following wrong because this is only about Jan 4.There will be a Pullback on Monday and it will not be from missing target. Even if it was 700k of deliveries it wouldn’t matter. WHY? because those numbers don’t affect the 2 primary catalysts in play on the first trading day of 2021.Those catalysts are 1) window dressing demand by Funds ending with dec 312) profit taking cap gains taxes on Jan 4 due in 2022.If #1 causes SP to fall on Monday, that falling SP could amplify #2"
Rolling downhill faster than a Nikola truck.
"NIO NO FACTORY? NO PROBLEM.I think you should do research on and come to your own conclusion. I own BABA and XPENG because I am bullish on the Chinese economy. But I see Tesla more like I do BYD and XPENG more like BYD. While NIO is like a upgraded TESLA. This is only in their respective markets.So why not Xpeng motors? I think it's a good bet long term. I think $XPEV $NIO $TSLA and a few other Chinese EVs are better bets than things like workhorse,nikola, shll etc.(it's also cheaper to build factories in China than it is in the U.S) Also, the Chinese government would be incentivized to assist NIO in building a factory because they would benefit as well.Having your own factory means little to me. The Tesla gigafactory costs around $2 billion. The problem here is that people think that this is such a big deal, it's not. What people don't understand is that you can own your own factory but without demand, it's worthless. So does NIO need a factory now? Sort of, they have been selling since 2018 and have sold 75,000 vehicles. Tesla has sold 500,000 vehicles in 12 years. So the demand for NIO is and will continue to increase because quality of a product speaks volumes, clearly.Have you ever considerd that China spends money on things like ghost cities to increase GDP because they have a surplus of wealth? The way they disperse wealth is different than in the U.S to the lower/poverty class (very different). China spends billions on infrastructre and will capatalize on the large debt the U.S owes them.So NIO can raise $2.6 billion in share dilution and be able to build their own factory. This actually might happen in places like EU. But Why do it it when you have JAC motors in China? Why does JAC gets such a bad reputation? They pump out other vehicles of quality like Volkswagen. So convince me what exactly about the quality is bad? It's clearly beating TESLA and the consumers love the vehicles.A factory will come in time but it isn't needed yet. That's what people don't get. When we see monthly deliveries of +10,000 a month on average I could see this happening. And when Sedans do come on the market from NIO, they will, I bet my left nut they will.In terms of service NIO offers more than XPENG and Tesla. That is why consumers who sit down and compare the 2 or 3 companies go for Tesla. The 2nd biggest investment, a vehicle, in terms of service in China and quality along with re sale values winner is a NIO. As battery technology increases and denser smaller batteries can be made. NIO will most likely build adapters for these smaller more powerful batteries to fit in the EC6,ES8,ES6, while being able to accomodate the newer vehicles moving forward.Robo taxi? You have an entire road infrastructre with easily moveable NIO battery swap stations that takes 1 day to move to accomodate your autonomos self driving robo taxi, enough said here. You also have NOMI a crucial part in taking transactions and being able to identify passengers.NIO NO FACTORY? NO PROBLEMSXPENG doesn't do any of these things. I could go on and on but you need to do your own research. I still believe these are all good bets so don't worry."
Wow. Goldman Sachs upgraded the price. Can buy now!!!!
"Thanks to WSB, there are several more stock that could drop 80% overnight and still be overvalued just like Tesla....lol."
"Amazingly low volume today, after Tesla missed on earnings predictions and Elon basically admitted that their future is bleak, plus increasing warranty costs. Fans are holding out for hope in battery-trucks, and a few still believe in FSD."
Why doesn't Elon start his own crypto currency startup under the Tesla banner?
"TSLA missed it's target by .0009%, I'd say that was so mighty fine estimation by Musk, especially in a year that has had a pandemic where so many folks lot their jobs. Had there been no pandemic, exactly how far past 500,000 vehicles would have been sold?"
"This stock is certainly in bubble territory and someone is going to get caught at the top. Just do a comparison between Apple and Amazon. Both innovative and massively growth companies, that are literally everywhere. When they had 600+B market caps, they were raking in 100s of billions of dollars and more profits than what Tesla makes. Meanwhile, Tesla is expected to hit 30B in revenue for 2020 Qs and 45B in revenue by the end of this year. Very understandable that Musk and Tesla are revolutionary, but so was Apple. When they released the first iPhone in 07, was Apple trading at a p/e of 1500+ and 27x sales?! This isn’t a growth company that’s expected to triple their revenue this year. They had a 26% increase in revenue from last year and are expected to increase 45% by the end of this year. Solid growth, but this evaluation is just insane and reality will hit. The FOMO is through the roof here and never mind all of the competition in the EV industry."
"Tesla has delivered a little less than one millions cars, most in China just in"

"If Teslas earnings increase 40% annually for 10 years and is valued at 30 times its earnings by then, it would generate about 5% yearly returns to the investor who bought it today."

Musk enticing the Redditt crowd.... too funny - is it a cry for help as the price decreases
"Not a bad report. Unfortunately it may be as good as it gets for Tesla. Competition will increase exponentially in the coming months, with dozens of new EVs being introduced.And sooner or later the company will have to account for the $300-500 million cost of the recall of 160,000 vehicles for touchscreen defects. This is not to say that the stock isn't worth owning. I'd be a buyer at $250 or less."
"Tesla (TSLA) has a new Street high price target. Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch more than doubled his price target on the stock to $1,036 from $486.“We believe TSLA has the potential to be a transformational technology company and deliver outsized returns,” wrote Rusch in a note to investors.Rusch reiterated his Outperform rating on the electric vehicle maker."

Profit miss? Who wants to short this? I just did at $875 will this be like #gme ? I don’t think so! LOL

"Hi TSLA longs, I am excited about your future!!!"
$TSLA is now part of S&P and will not be traded as it was prior to inclusion. Don't depend on any major sell off unless it's a market wide event.
https://twitter.com/popcrave/status/1351018771679481858?s=21Looks like Tesla’s stock will be going down with this news!
No Strength for Tesla stock. Can you feel it ?
"This company is valued at 4x Coca cola and 7x McDonalds. Every person on the planet has drank a coke and McDonalds, how many have driven a tesla? The valuation is so out of whack."
The $38 billion loss for short sellers in 2020 will double (or even triple) in 2021. All great news for TSLA moving forward - congrats my fellow longs and happy new year!
It would be so nice if the Reddit Army came here and shook the shorts out.
This will hit 1000 before 1/27 earnings
TSLA is now only 7% from All Time High after all the downward pressure. Looks like it'll go up big in the coming days. Sorry Shorts!
"Tesla shareholders do not see ""the future""; they see only their imaginations. Many of them have excellent imaginations. The problem is: they are imagining things without a good foundation in science, math, or business knowledge -- knowing science, math and business allows one to imagine future events accurately. Their imagination is delusion because it is based on flawed premises."
Will go to test new highs again $GOOG $FB $TSLA $WIMI
come on Tesla... don't make me move my money over to Game Stop.... come on and get that $1000....
"New Year Greeting from your friend - a TSLA long term investor:Hello shorts, Greetings, Happy New year. Just want to say hello on this new year from the West Coast. I have been doing some reflection in the new year day, and I have some conclusions about my personal life, as well as my investments including TSLA stocks. And I just would like to share with you some of my reflections because it is related to you ladies/gentlemen who is shorting TSLA. I punderstand why you are upset after such a record year in all fronts for TSLA, a record breaking business results, stock at all time high, stock price x7 in one year, largest shorting loss ever. Please understand, we long term investors have not done anything intentional to make you upset. We have invested in a good stock, and it's been good to us, and we just try our best to defend the stock we own with what we consider as fake new and stories.I have heard all kinds of name calling toward me: cult members, greedy, immoral, fat pig get slaughtered...etc. Let me tell you something, It just won't work. As I have said over and over again, I am so much in the money I have enough capital strength to ride out the peak and valley. Why don't you guys stop trying to save me from myself. I would really appreciate it.Have a great happy new year! Instead of spending all days and nights bashing TSLA and its shareholders, why don't you spend some quality time with your family, relax, get some exercise, eat well, walk your dog so he/she does not feel neglected, and contribute to our GDP in a positive manner.Last but not least, do not bet against TSLA. As the previous shorting efforts have resulted in record loss which I will not reiterate here."
"Why can’t Ford or GM come out with electric F150 and the Hummer like within a year? Why 2 - 4 years ?? Tesla built an entire factory and produced the model 3 in China and a few short months later they added Shanghai 2 so as to produce the Model Y this was done in under 2 years. GM NEEDS 4 maybe 5 years to produce the Hummer and at 120,000 they won’t need to produce very many the big boys are failing miserably."
AFTER TESLA RAISING 20 BILLION IN 2020>>>EXPECT MASS EXPANSION IN 2021 ITS ALREADY STARTING WITH THE CHINA DESIGN STUDIO COMING AND 25K MODEL IN CHINA>>>TESLA WILL DOUBLE SALES WITH CYBER TRUCK FULL SELF DRIVE MODEL Y IN CHINA ANND NO PANDEMIC STAY LONG
"Can someone check my math? Assuming Tesla is selling 20M (10 years from now) cars right now at an average price of 55k. Total revenue is 101B, net margin is 2%, that is only 2B net income a year. Even if net margin is 10%, PE is still at 70. How is this justify the valuation?"
"There's gonna be a lot of end of the year tax selling. People with gains will want to lock in before capital gains tax rates skyrocket next year, so I imagine there will be a lot of selling pressure popping up"
Here's some interesting figures for those who think TSLA will continue to hold its competitive advantage:Spending on R+D (research and development) in 2019:VW...$15.8 billionToyota...S10.0 billionFord...$8 billionHonda...$7.1 billionDaimler (Benz): $7.1 billionGM...$6.8 billionTesla: $1.3 billion (down from $1.5 billion in 2018) Kinda makes you wonder about those 2030 production prediction numbers issued this week...and the 1700 PE ratio.

Would love to see Tesla run over FB market cap by this Friday.
How can anyone continuously buy this stock when there are no profits??
I just need a split so that I can buy more.I am not really eager to buy more at that price.
Tesla is overvalued by their current numbers but undervalued on a long-term outlook.
I wouldn't bet on a correction anytime soon. There is enough FRN's being printed to keep this going higher for a LONG time. TSLA is no longer a company or a stock...it is an idea. Just like BTC. Valuations mean nothing at this point and the stock price is just a number. This is a daytrader and grifter's dream. What is the real value of TSLA? Who knows at this point...but right now the market does not care. Timing a correction is a FOOLS errand.

CNBC today reported that several Chinese cities are experiencing brownouts because of a trade dispute with Australia has led to coal shortages and most Chinese power generation comes from coal.Just wait until a few hundred million additional EVs are plugged into the electric grid lol.
Laughing at the people that bought puts today.

What is the best time to sell tesla? Iam new in this. Thank you for support.
"Musk just hit his last milestones. $650B market cap will give him another 1.689M shares options. It needs to maintain that cap for 6 months for him to get the options vested. And if he sell the compagny, he will get his money without having to wait 6 months."
I’m glad I bought put today!

"I'm out....as a short...I can't do it....this makes no sense,and I think I timed my entry into the short incorrectly....or there is really is something about this company which I fundamentally don't understand....my best wishes to all longs who have been correct on this all year long...and even more so today. I was wrong."
"Toyota has revenues 10 times Tesla's; has a PE of about 9 compared to 1,600 or so for Tesla; spends 10 times Tesla on R+D; and is selling at 0.85 times revenue compared to Tesla's 29 times revenues. This simply makes no sense. And there's about 100 new models of EVs coming on the market, compared to Tesla's 1 or 2. Sorry, Tesla may make a great car, but the stock is more of an irrational cult than an investment."
so apparently nothing will bring this down
It's about time to short it big drop. Just according to the chart.
THE ROAD TO 750 ContinUES MONDAY. STAY LONG BUY ALL DIPS AND RALLYS.
It is interesting people are willing to pay $8 for a share in Ford knowing the company is losing money and has $170 Billion in debt and their bond carry Junk status . Yet these people question the valuation of Tesla the company has $11 B. debt and $11 B. in cash and their bond is BB+ while the future belong to them with all their innovation
"HI, Folks ... some S&P funds managers start to buy TSLA from today! We should see the volume start to increase."
Who’s taking a seat in the options chain for earnings?
"Shorts will be toasted, TSLA to $1,500 to get the shorties out of the way"
"Everybody here who was still buying at this price, understands that price estimate is $1/share.We had split 1to5. That means EARNINGS of almost 950 millions!!!For 1 quarter...Read it few times, maybe you will have some clarity ..."
Have you guys watched the YouTube videos of ppl sleeping in their Tesla cars while it drives? It’s one thing to hear about self drive but another to watch it in action..
Real value of this manipulated stock should be $79.5. Not $795
"Tesla sales (outside China) === DOWN almost 40,000 units despite price cuts YTD through to November 2019 = 222,000 YTD through to November 2020 = 184,000"
When the market can not decide over or under 800
Tesla reports quarterly results in January. If the results are not super spectacular this will be a sell off like no other. The stock is currently priced way above perfection... I am taking my profit and sit on the sidelines....
Big drop are coming to all the mega cap stocks ! Looks like Hedge Fund are forced to sell them fast to cover their losses on GME AMC KOSS .... Huge short squeeze is happening on this Friday and the next few.
"Double top confirmed on the charts.....this is running out of steam and heading towards a correction....I believe it will hit $1,000 some time this year but definitely heading toward a correction to the 700/600s level first..."
"WRT self driving, INTC has the advantage far above where TESLA is. Next would be the threat of Apple. Tesla has an ok system, but nobody is knocking their doors down to license or buy their system. I wanted to make that clear because it is just true. I am a retired (recently) Professional Engineer in Florida with 41 years experience. So if your really a long term investor, take notice."
"sla not even in top 5 EV in Europe anymore .The mythical growth theory is epic. Has anyone really checked the actual BIN’s of cars sold. I can guarantee it was NOT 498,550. Another perfectly round numbers quarterly results"
This is the top folks.
psychologically it feels better to long a stock than to bet against it. What shorts are doing is not natural to the human mind. Shorting a stock is also longing the dollar which currently is looking weaker and weaker. Corporate tax rate increase is about the only risk for stocks at the moment. We all know interest rates are stuck at 0 for the indefinite future due to the massive Debt to GDP ratio
"When Tesla gets to the actual autonomous state. Then like Amazon, what keeps them from becoming ""Fedex, UPS, Uber, Lyft, every taxi company you ever rode in, every delivery van you see, Door-dash, etc. The possibilities seem endless. When they get the batteries and solar fine tuned (maybe already have), they become Hydro, Fortis, Nexterra, etc. When Musk gets his satellites in orbit and can deliver H-Speed internet globally, what country is going to say no thanks? Hard to bet against this man. There should be a Musk stock. lol."
"Tesla Gigafactory Berlin partner talks ‘prestige,’ operations as early as JuneGood luck and GOD bless,"
"Good evening Tesla investors!! CLII merged EVgo, 770 Connectors to be installed on EVgo chargers enabling Tesla charging across EVgo network, buy CLII now, stock price at $22 now. You will expect 5X~10X fold return in near future."
Let’s go !!!
"THIS IS GOING TO POP HUGE !!! Remember, TSLA does the exact opposite of what everyone expects it to do !!!!"
"Since you got no fundementals to support the ruse, bulls connected Tesla with BTC now. But BTC is correcting"
impossible to predict in either direction regardless of the Saturday press release.

"I sold my 23 shares at 833.50 :-( while I'm grateful that I've made a decent profit, I think the noise the bears are making scared me... Some do make a really good point about investing in this stock with emotion rather than logic. If it looks like it's going up again I'll be a player, but I just can't at the very moment"
its going up in Frankfurt lol

"On an up day for the market, TSLA is down 7%. This is beginning of the end of the monster bubble.. Better sell soon. Or at least reduce below 5% of your portfolio. The downside risk is huge. This was $70 just a year ago. Not much changed for the company. - Solar/energy business losing money- Car quality and production issues- increased competition and price cuts- roboTaxis will not happen for many years."
rumors elsewhere about $appl and $f whats up with that? Any clues as to potential veracity?$GM $tsla
"If all the people arguing that this valuation doesn't make sense even in another universe, were shorting this, this will be 100 next day. Somebody with big money needs courage to short this all the way down!"
"The one thing that impresses about the billionaires' stocks is how much more upward $TSLA, $SPCE, $NK and $NVAX is have to go."
"Ive posted this before and I’ll post it again I am currently holding 5133 shares of TESLA and yes that’s $ 3.6mill dollars ALL OF IT IS PROFIT ANY ONE who can not see a run to $700 thru year end earnings report is a fool. And look at us now at $708 I posted this weeks ago and yesterday we’re just below $700 after we get fantastic year end numbers we will probably see $725 as a new support level. Then we will start a slow and steady run throughout the 2021 year. Shanghai now making the Model Y giving us a great 1st quarter for 2021. Making it 7 profitable quarters in a row while building 2 gigantic factories. 2nd or 3rd quarter will bring Berlin on line making VW sweat like a pig. Austin will follow with Cyber and Semi Truck If you can’t see $1000 per share come September then your simply Blinded by guys like Chanos, Johnson, Etc. Tesla has made me into a millionaire this is beyond my wildest dreams I’m not expecting a straight line to $1000 but there is very little room for any substantial down turns not with this calendar of events. If you need to scratch your itch for more excitement sell half and buy NIO. Just look at today’s rise of $28.75 on Tesla just over 4% rise in one day but look at NIO also up even better that Tesla on a % basis take your pick but EV market is still gonna be hot for quite some time. And today NIO is slightly better than Tesla I’m long and strong on both"
Tesla to the moon 3 more times in 6 months
Model Y deliveries in China have officially begun!
GOOG and AAPL will make Electric Car on their own - OMG!
There is not end of flimsy and illusionary news in TSLA world. Everybody is so fascinated to listen these and forgetting the real things to happen. Stock price level is at astronomical high level and at this point no analyst's can justify its price valuation. Most new entrant will regret in coming sessions very soon.
"Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk says the company is making good on its so called full-self-driving software that will enable greater autonomy.The software could enable robo-taxis, Mr. Musk reiterated, and that would make the cars more valuable and increase revenue generation.Given that, he says on a call, ""I think there is a way to sort of like justify the valuation of the company.""Now, you have to love that stutter ""uh well mayibe I think it may sort of justify the valuation""Really? Gimme a break"
"TSLA passed additional compliance and obtained further licenses- will make significant gains. New estimate is $1,275 possibly $1,500 with another likelihood of 3 for 1 share split."
"WOW what a discount price!!! i wish i didn't have 12m in margin calls, I would buy another 12m$ !!!!!!"
"The longs know the deal. We just sit back and let it go to 1,000 in February."

Not sure why everyone is so high on this stock. Even the most optimistic evaluations of this stock show an up side of 50%.The magic of the huge up side is over. Are all of you Robinhooders out there saying that this should be the worlds most valuable company? How does anything point to that. If you look at the fundamentals the down side risk is far bigger. I do not disagree that TESLA is a good company and has huge potential but this stock is overvalued and all the hype about higher prices is far more about making money off the little guy than reality. Not to mention if you sell now you could easily buy again at a far less elevated price with way more shares. Book value on the stock is $49. Lets let it get to $200 or less where it is a realistic investment.
"The stock price can only stay detached from reality for so long. Not the only bubble in the market now, but one of the biggest..."
"Tesla's DieselgateThis is real and it is not a joke. When will Tesla do their loyal but deteriorating base right? Tesla claiming unsafe range. Range is suppose to be part of their MOAT. If it turns out to be true, look out. Al l the #$%$ about efficient drive train is over. All you will have is a car that is well built on the driver side and poorly built on the passenger side. See Sandy Munroe's latest video, it is hilarious. ?Under the guise of ?safety? and increasing the ?longevity? of the batteries of the Class Vehicles, Tesla fraudulently manipulated its software with the intent to avoid its duties and legal obligations to customers to fix, repair, or replace the batteries of the Class Vehicles, all of which Tesla knew were defective, yet failed to inform its customers of the defects,? wrote the lawsuit.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-battery/tesla-owner-lawsuit-claims-software-update-fraudulently-cut-battery-capacity-idUSKCN1UY2TW"

"Interesting to see that the of ev cars from vw, mercedes and BMW was greater than Tesla"
"Assuming Apple could grab 5% market share of the electric vehicle market with a $75,000 iCar in 2025 that sports a 7% operating margin, the tech giant would only see a 3% bump in earnings. If Apple sells its electric car for $100,000, snags 5% of the EV market, and drives a 10% operating margin, Hall estimates the bump to Apple’s earnings would be 5%.Not too impressive for Apple given its much higher margin structure currently driven by making less capital intensive iPhones, iPads, and Macs using outside suppliers. But the somewhat subdued earnings accretion from an iCar, as Wall Street analysts call it, reflects the costly nature of making an electric car. Or, a car of any kind — see low single digit percentage operating margins at Ford (F) and General Motors (GM)."
Tesla stock price target raised to $900 from $500 at BofA Securities.
TESLA to the MOON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I'm all in with $F, $GM, $STLA, $PCRFY and $GE. They are still cheap, especially when you compare them with Tesla. This is where you need to be if you want the next TSLA stock."
'Big Short' investor Michael Burry predicts Tesla stock will collapse like the housing bubble: 'Enjoy it while it lasts'Im not sure if i should buy long term puts out a year a month or 6 months.. Any suggestions? Because this will absolutely fall 75% from here in the future.
"Most likely short term scenario: price goes to $900. Elon then announces another split. Stock goes to $1,000 pre-split on the news, 5 for 1. Then he issues another $5B in stock (because there’s actually a Tsla stock shortage now that institutions have to buy and hold due to S&P). Then the share price splits to $200 without a decrease to accommodate the $5B offering. Elon gets the cash for R&D, and the shareholders get the returns. Easy peasy."
"Do longs REALLY believe that fund managers will wake up on the 22nd and just then realize they need to increase their stake in TSLA and hit the ""BUY"" button? That is so cute..."
All the Tesla investors that have no clue if it’s undervalued or overvalued... just bought in because it’s a cult.
"Elon Musk is standing on the shoulders of giants the likes of DaVinci, Newton, Edison, Tesla, Einstein and van Braun. More than any multi-billionaire business mogul, charismatic political or reverent religious leader Elon Musk is advancing far into the future sustainability of Mother Earth and furthering humankind throughout the universe. Not a utopian disciple but a disruptive, effective and encouraging force. Any other motive prescribed to him is fallacious."
"I’d like to understand the bullish point of view, where do you guys see Tesla in 5 years (in terms of rev, sales etc)?"
This really is a once in a lifetime opportunity
$900.00 before close on Friday.
"Simple question: Tesla's FSD, in the event of being unable to safely stop in time to avoid a sudden (no advanced warning) obstacle in the road, does it swerve, or brake hard, and accept impact? Does it matter what the obstacle is? Deer in headlight, tumbleweed, child chasing ball, fully loaded stalled gasoline truck, floating plastic bag, wayward baby carriage, Musk sycophant, endangered species, ex-wife? Does it know there is a cliff to the right, but not the left? Tesla (Musk) underestimates the split-second decisions that humans make on a daily basis."
Everything will go green the minute Elon tweets or speaks and he loathes short sellers.

"Am I the only one who doeesn't like NIO's battery swap plan? It may have been a great idea if Tesla didn't already come out with a superior product. I think its too late for this business model to take hold. The wear and tear swapping out batteries, the shear amount of stored batteries in each station not being used, the fact you can only swap 13 or so batteries an hour. These are just some of the concerns that prevent me from investing in NIO for the long term."
maybe worth 50 billion market cap... sorry musk but just throwing the casual 50 billion in fsd 100% margin revenue on the call is about as believable as semi being a realistic long haul solution... here's a little clue its not.

"Look for a 5x gain in 2021, with end of year price back to 4,000 post-split. Cathie Woods was actually too conservative! People used to postulate Tsla would eclipse Aapl- now that’s taken as a given. The real question is how much over $10T will the market cap get, and when. If you don’t think so, then you don’t understand the enormous change that’s happening."
"Keep hearing from longs.. I will never sell a share of TSLA. This too risky, this went from $70 to $900 in less than a year and had a monster 2020. As March comes around and people start hitting LTCG (Long term capital gain) which has lower taxes, there will be more selling. Downside risk is to $300 vs upside to $1000 - you can lose more than half your money or gain 20%.. Reasons to sell - - sentiment has changed - bad earnings, other stocks like GME for gamblers.- SP500 addition + top 10 company brings lots of scruitiny - PE of 1600 vs PE of 35 for AAPL - long term - lots of competition- RoboTaxis not coming in 2021.. (Tesla autonomous is still half baked)- Cybertruck etc are too far off. Not much positive catalyst.- 2021 - less profitable - EV credits reducing, price cuts.. Musk is smart and the price has increased beyond his wildest dreams. hope you guys capture some profits before this goes down a lot. good luck. PS: I am net long tesla with my SP500 holdings."

"Until Longs start selling, this one will continue to go up. Institutions are still buying and shorts are still covering so they need to buy shares. No limit on this. Longs are really longs on this stock, no matter what price."
800 + today!!!!
"tesla price to earnings ratio is 1600 plus while ticker gold is 13, barrack gold [gold] is value while tesla is bubble"
After the bubble bursts there will be a movie about all the people who lost life savings and pensions.
Tesla is once in a lifetime opportunity guys!! Go longs
"Shorts: I'm here for you if you need investing advice. If you mess with the bull, you might get the horn."
You never know when to buy in or sell. That’s why you don’t want to sell it. Cheers!!! Up up and away!
"Wonder if permabashers have moments of lucidity combined with existential dread when they realize that there are many TSLA investors who have increased their initial stake by 150x or more. Personally know several dozen retail investors sitting on that kind of gain. Want to know something else? They're not selling, and likely never will."
Not selling a share. Tesla is THE long term play of the decade. Hey wasn’t Facebooks pe 1415 at one point. Amazon 3450
"Tesla is surely heading higher here as $1,000 is a nice round number."
$900.00 is just the stepping stone to $925.08
"Rare to be able to buy a trillion dollar company with a P/E 1.65 thousand, congrats Robinhooders"
Tesla is creating millionaires and multimillionaires. Cheers to all who are doing well. 
"excellent technical action. I really like the way it found its support back at previous levels. The earnings number is constrained by lack of production facilities not consumer demand. We got mega, mega production facilities coming soon... THIS IS A BUYING OPPORTUNITY!"
"Someone asked: ""Where is the bottom?"" Answer: check out the sewer near you."
I have a feeling $gm will take over NIO and scale a lot faster than NIO or Xpev or Li. I am going to bet 1/2 of NIO money invested into GM and Keep $tsla shares where it is . Soon to be millionaire with stocks only..less than a year away!
Lol. Shorts are definitely contemplating the use of more effective drugs!!!!!!!
ACRX up 20% on RECORD VOLUME - Buyout chatter!BNGO up 12% - Great Drug Pipeline!!! watching the action of $tsla $nio $gm $f $kndi will add on dips!
Roughly one billion in market cap for every car expected to be sold in 2021.
This will be up soon. The name of the game is buy low sell high.
At the end of the day Tesla is still a leader. Every company will have their bumps along the road which is completely normal. Tesla is years ahead of other EVs and will forever be considered “the iPhone” of smart phones. Long and strong
Tesla now is like Apple when Steve first found the iphone. Tesla is the future for all of its innovations. Elon's legacy will open the door for many industries to follow.
"""Cute"" is how I would describe Tesla's numbers on Wednesday. Volkswagen posts US$12.2B profit in resilient pandemic year.Predicting 246% growth in EV production.""VW emerged with a small gain in market share as some peers took a bigger hit.""“We argue that in 2021, VW will rival Tesla as the No. 1 seller of battery-electric vehicles globally,” Timm Schulze-Melander, an auto-industry specialist at Redburn, said in a note Friday. He estimates the group will ship as many as 800,000 fully electric cars to customers, up from 231,000 last year.

"If you're long, it makes no different whether $TSLA goes up +1.50 or +15.50 or +50.50. All that matters is GREEN. Add up all the greens for the week and you're good."
"All non Tesla investors we don’t need your analysis in this chat , kindly step out and watch us reach a grand soon."
840 will look appealing after $2200 run up.
$1000 by next week!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"This is the real mind blowing thing tesla produced 500,000 cars last year and has a market cap of 766 billion and Ford made 900,000 of just f150s and has a market cap of 35 billion."

I bought the dips. I think a fully self driving car will change the car industry and tesla is way ahead on this. Imagine long road trips you actually don’t have to drive and really enjoy the trip
"People think the expansion costs are being accounted for up front and once that’s done and Tesla is making thousand more cars, it’s all money in the bank.. lol the factories will be depreciated at the rate of vehicles they produce"
Should I buy in at 850 please tell meeeeeeeeeee what are we doing next week???
Supposedly they are taking the company private at $105 per share ? I heard this from Elon Musk. Funding secured for a valuation of $40 billion market cap
"Let me also throw in that PALANTIR has also been ""chosen"" as the next TESLA-like stock. This stock has become too expensive for people to generate big profits from short squeezeMark my words: bitcoin, game stop and palantir... watch those do similar to what tesla did 2020"
"Tesla Shares Set New High Ahead Of TSLA S&P 500 InclusionQuote:Tesla earned this revised rating due to the presence of enough liquidity on its balance sheet, more than enough to offset any of its liabilities and to fund its expansion projects in Europe and Asia.“As a result, Tesla’s net debt is essentially zero,” the rating agency noted. “Based on a key credit metric, debt to EBITDA, our assessment of financial risk has reduced substantially. With more cash on its balance sheet than debt, the company appears easily able to fund its global expansion in China and Europe, and broaden its U.S. manufacturing base by opening a facility in Austin, Texas. Moreover, this cushion of cash will help the company navigate through the ongoing economic impact from the resurgence of COVID-19.”"

"TSLA stock was $300 when the company was producing 30,000 cars a year. Then $3000 when it produced 300,000. Now it is making 500,000 so the stock should be $5000 adjust for split and you get $1000"
"Thank you, Elon!Thank you, Morgan Stanley!Long and strong!"
Very narrow trading range for a stock which has moved as much as this in the past 3 months.
You’d think shorts loosing over $40 billion in 2020 betting against Elon Musk and Tesla would be more contrite. Though acknowledging its latest quarter and year end numbers are impressive many still speculate on all the he same talking points that could lead to the BEV manufacturer’s demise. They just won’t let it go.
Anatomy of a typical bubble... google it... we are now in DENIAL PHASE! The big crash very very near. I am going short!
"Indonesia one of the country with largest nickel deposit inthe world might be a partner for Tesla's battery, one more battery obstacle's gone also one more step for world domination in EV."
"Never jumps on earnings since it has barely any $0.80 a share is a joke for $800 billion company or about 1,500 p/e. Will take 20 years or perfection to get to a 40 multiple. So this should be dead money for 29 years to break even"
"Tesla couldn't keep up with the market today. The institutions know something and it's crazy retail that's propping up this sideways action. Meanwhile the institutions are offloading. My guess is earnings are going to be a big miss. Credits were front-loaded in prior quarters and they're less and less necessary, meanwhile costs are going up with all of the factory construction and design work. I can only imagine the overtime engineers must be putting in to make the ""exo-skeleton"" Cybertruck compliant because that's what Musk demands."
"TSLA has a minimum of 2 billion data hours (my own metric and estimate) for building its neural net, which is used for TSLA's 10 times safer than a human 2021 full autonomy. Any competitor has that?? What's that you say? Nothing? I thought so."
RBC got it wrong. They overlooked the fact that Tesla can use its overvalued share price to fund operations and acquisitions. Way cheaper than normal auto companies that need to turn a profit. This thing literally flipped the narrative. The stock funds the company people...
How many shares y’all got?
"I have been looking at ""e-commerce"" stocks in my Value Line Reports (mostly companies like Workday which provide software services in the cloud). Most of them have never made a profit and the stocks have been soaring. Is this what the TSLA fans think TSLA is about? The beauty of the ""software as a service in the cloud"" model is that most of the costs (developing the software) is fixed regardless of the number of customers. Client acquisition is also a big expense, but, there there are large economies of scale and the dominant player is at a great advantage. Gross margins and operating margins are huge.But, despite all the protests that TSLA isn't just a car company, the fact is that nearly all its revenues comes from selling cars (or EV credits) and it is really just a car company. Growth will not greatly improve margins. You are not going to find buyers of a $25,000 car paying $10,000 for a self driving software package. Nor, are the mass of buyers going to appreciate a $100 software update charge being added to the monthly cost of their lease payment."
"It is having a hard time to break 650. I am very bullish, but I am starting to feel a bit of hesitation with this resistance. It is mostly going back to the support more than actually breaking resistance."
Bought the dip last night at $820 Tesla now down 2% at $845. Long and strong!
"Tried to warn about reckless business ways of Musk. Present debt will hurt profits for a long time. Deliveries and sales are not a sure thing, but interest payments are."
"Sorry, correct me if I am wrong but is it not the smart play to cash out on TESLA and buy NIO? considering that NIO is 5-10 years behind TESLA and actually has a brand new market in China to sell to and China is actually more pro EV than the USA is? Did TESLA not pave the way for NIO to be a 300-700$ stock one day.....especially after NIO is delivering 500k EVs per year....say in like 2023-2024? i don't know, seems like a no brainer to me....."
"lots of GAPs to fill...if this is the correction, support is at $740 (fills a gap) 20dMA...then $614 50dMA..."
If $TSLA mentions $OZSC once the deal is made this will go sky-high
Analyst predicting EPS of $1.04 failed to account for the higher expenditure that TSLA puts into getting it Germany and Texas Gigafactories up.
"Careful, momentum traders, momentum is a two-way street and it's always faster on the downside of the street than the upside. There always comes a ""the king has no clothes"" moment, and the fact that TSLA has gone hyperbolic is a sign that moment may not be very far off. And the Greater Fool Theory (""I realize this is nonsense but I'll follow the trend and get out when it turns"") does not work very well in practice."
"TSLA will hit $900.00 soon. Have you saw the stock TSNP? It’s 35 cents and looks to be an Amazon, PayPal combination stock"

"Somebody asked why you can see all the impulses in the volume. Everyone can correct me, but my understanding is this. This is a ponzi they sell the shares to one another to drive the price up and the higher it goes the more they unload until there's nothing to unload.When a big guy unloads the price drops. The manipulators then rush in to bring it back up.The basic shares used to rotate around will be dumped in the end on the robinhooders. I'd call that the propeller and in the meantime they just drive the price up for themselves or other third party with which they have an arrangement. It might be Musk himself.I followed it a couple of days...and this is what I saw.Ideas? We can write an e-mail to the SEC afterwards."
Toyota has had recalls of 1.5M cars (that might be about how many cars Tesla has EVER made)
"Jacob Walthour of Blueprint put it so well...valuation is the wrong way to look at TSLA. EVs are the future, and right now the performance and range of the competition’s EVs are lackluster compared to TSLA’s EVs. As long as that’s the case TSLA will continue to do well."

Alot of people here doesn't understand AI and self driving technology. Programming using self and reinforce learning is much easier these days and it doesn't requires the amount of training data as it used to. So the barrier of entries isn't as huge as most people think. I don't see Telsa have a huge advantage in this front.
kinda funny when a 27 year old multimillionaire has to give minimum wage paid bashers a lesson on successful investing strategies lol
Nice reversal and just as expected. I’ve seen about 200 reversals just like. Bye shorts
"TSLA's SP may very well start to erode now with little to no end in sight. Why: Too much real competition with many leading EV makers reaching 100,000 in volume in 2022, TSLA 2023 numbers going forward are going to get revised down. GM comes out as a surprise competitor whom may actually be better positioned than tesla (with many partnerships building cheaper cars and they currently hold the title for a best selling EV in China now) ! NIO has battery tech that seems to be better than Teslas, but Tesla's biggest problem is the $25,000 sub car market, you know the main part of the car market for the average consumer. Many EV manufactures are much closer to the goal of a mass market $25,000 < EV. GM is emerging as major competition for Tesla , NIO, XPeng, Li, BYD right now ! GM's stock will go up more than tesla's this year and possibly more than those other EV manufacturers as well. Everyone wrote off ICE manufactures but GM has been making incremental upgrades the whole time. Don't count out ford with the Mach-e either. As far as I'm concerned Tesla will maintain its market share on the higher end EVs but doesn't have a chance against EV competitors that already have sub $25,000 EVs. Tesla makes 4 vehicles out of --> 100 <--- different types needed to replace ICE. Keep in mind that Tesla's rise from 2017-2020 had a lot to do with traditional ICE manufactures only pretending to compete, because they believed Tesla would falter, well fast forward to now and we can see that it is a much different environment with ""everyone working on EVs"""
Tesla's short sellers are DOOMED.https://youtu.be/IswVfp9_kvI
The current valuation is always the correct valuation.
I will never ever short Tesla again!
This stock is impossible to short!! There is always something that pushes this higher!! Why would anyone short an Elon Musk company? This guy is always working hard to prove you wrong!!

"Honestly, read through this chat room and tell me we aren’t in 1999..."
Are we at 1000 yet? So what if it takes 1600 years for profits to equal market cap - I'll wait in the car!!!
As you can see after Elon's tweet sending etsy higher it's what Elon says in the conference call that matters just as much or more than just numbers. His words have a HUGE INFUENCE!

Tesla is the best short candidate out these. I guarantee that in 20 years it will be down at $20. The only question is whether someone can hold out that long for it to get to that price.
"Hi boys and girls, Don’t forget, some analysts are still calling for $7,000.00 per share by 2024  I added a bunch at this sale price."
Q1-2020 Tesla lost money selling cars.Q2-2020 Tesla lost money selling cars.Q3-2020 Tesla lost money selling cars.Q4-2020 Tesla lost money selling cars.Yep - Q4 was another quarterly loss for their auto business. They did sell $401 million in eco credits which pushed the bottom line into the black.
"My new price target based on the collective wisdom of analysts is $420,000 per shareOnly values company at about $750 million per car sold, instead of measly $1.5 million.P/E should be at least 750,000, not 1,500"
"Hey Tesla Long Term investors,Whenever I see a research analyst doing one of these doom and gloom prediction on TSLA price, I start to pay attention. JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman in December upgraded TSLA price from $80-90, and I was like ""what's up with that"" with a sell rating. Because I have about 4.5% of my portfolio tied to TSLA, and I want to make sure I see what he is seeing. So I did some research on what the guy is about. I just want to report back that I don't have too much to worry about, and let me explain.The guy is a legit automotive research analyst having more than 10 years of research experience in the automotive sector. My problem is not with what background he has, but it's what he does not. We all know there has not been a whole lot of innovations in the automotive industry except TSLA, until this year when all the automotive legacy companies jump on the bandwagon because of TSLA's established success in this area. But we all know TSLA is not just an EV manufacturer, it's also autonomous driving(artificial intelligence), battery technology with current production (unlike another company called QS), energy storage, robotics, Software Development, Car insurance, HVAC...etc. Now how could a guy like that covering all these areas with just automotive research background with a MASTER Degree in accounting. Oh my god, just we need, another research analyst with accounting background. If it's that simple, Joe from our own Chat room can do his job easily. I think an ideal person for this type of analyst has to have a combo of 5-7 years of auto manufacturing industry, 2-3 years of SW industry, 2 years of artificial intelligence/robotics experience, and a couple years of solar energy solutions industry. An analyst with this combination of experience would be very expensive for investment banks, but it's absolutely necessary to cover a company such as TSLA well.Additionally, I always want to see what credibility does this guy have. I have extracted some information on Brinkman's past performance from Tiprank(a site which keeps the performance of stock research analysts)and share with everyone in the forum:Ranked #6,701 out of 7,182 Analysts on TipRanks (#14,083 out of 15,010 overall experts)Average return of ratings he gave out: -4.4%I don't know about you, but why is the media even give this guy the time of the day given that terrible performance record?"
Tesla cult members invest in GameStop! Why? For the same reason you bought Tesla and that is it goes vertical up.
Anyone claiming that the Apple car will somehow oust Tesla is dreaming in colors. They're in talks with Hyundai LOL what a joke...
"Can some one tell me what’s all the panic about!? It’s been going upp for 11 days! One down day and it’s like end of the world!I bought it at 650, gonna keep until the next split and keep buying on the dips. Either u believe in the company or u don’t, don’t panic. Tesla has gone up 700% in one year. And u keep thinking it’s gonna bust!? This stock will hitt at least 1000$ again.I believe"

"Only 56% of the average day trade and that upon releasing earning statements. Big parties forced to take positions in Tesla due to S&P inclusion are done buying, Tesla believers are holding on to their shares while new potential buyers aren't motivated enough. Extremely high stock prices while missing targets, increased competition, less emmision certificates in the future as all brands are building PHEV/BEVs, shrinking market share in EU... Any potential investor can do his/her own math on this stock and decide on whether or not it's the best stock to invest in at this moment."
Real world = Tesla has MORE M3 capacity available for US & European sales.Real World = Tesla no longer reports Model 3 sales - instead they combine them with Model Y salesReal World = Tesla Model 3 sales (from independent sources) in NL are down 75% Real World = Tesla Model S/X sales in NL are so small that no one tracks them anymore Real World = Tesla cut prices across the board and then cut the price of the Model S/X againReal World = Tesla halted production of the Model S/X for 18 days

Breaking News :Volkswagen sold EV cars in 2019 : 72600 Volkswagen sold EV cars in 2020 : 315.400WOAW !!!!!
tesla is not just a car company i bailed on tsla once before and regretted it never again
"Tesla Model 3 sales in NL === 17,858 (Jan-Nov. 2019)Tesla Model 3 sales in NL === 4,436 (Jan-Nov. 2020) <==== 75% declineBTW Tesla has far more production capacity now than it did last year - so the ole ""they can't make them fast enough"" line doesn't seem to work."
Funds still DID NOT bought. So big buying is still incoming.Just HOLD to this shares to be rewarded soon.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmN466fX2PQ&t=11s&ab_channel=TeslaDaily
tesla game is over
Afterhours was $750.. tomorrow should be good for Tesla
I think in the near future electric car companies are going to use solar windows and panels on cars to extend mileage and in my opinion the likely supplier with the most advanced technology will be Clearvue Technologies CVUEF. I hope TSLA doesn’t get left behind in that regard by the Chinese EV companies.
I guess tomorrow TSLA will test 1000 and pull back. On Thursday will be the REAL DEAL.
"If Elon wants cash to fund new factories and projects, now is not a bad time to issue more shares. Wouldn't blame him for it unless he access to cheap debt"
I will certainly sell when it reaches 1000+ and will enter again after some time
The pe is only 1600. A good value.
saw a lucid Air commerical. Looks nice with good performance specs. Tesla will have plenty of company with similar yields and prices in the next two to three years.
recall announced and the stock is barely down 1%...lol....taking down this stock is like hunting a rhino with a slingshot
TSLA trading less per share than Chipotle CMG? Apparently they hold numerous US Patents on Taco sauces... Give me a break!
My prediction is people will sell on earnings.
Losing money should I dump this stock and move on and or not? Stop with all the other #$%$ talk!
"medium investors will certainly burn out, the question is how they will end up with the extremely rich, some will want to stop at 450 points, others at 200 while the biggest want 50, and keep that price for two years so others can't withdraw money and invest in others things ..."
up 5% a day everyday....on news that someone raised their price target?
"with this starting volume, and such a big drop, it looks like some big boys were mocking us. It is not theory, it is visible conspiracy. They fill their pockets at our own expense."
HUGE EV COMPETITION = BUBBLE BURSTING
"Yeah, but back to $850 tomorrow. This was a blip today. Tues & Wed up days, then a pause until Monday."
with so many cars being produced does the market expect people replacing their vehicles every year
"It’s only up 2% pre market, so it will drop when the market open along with tech stocks."
Does anyone think there will be a market correction. Not specific on TESLA but overall. If so what percentage?
"keep selling, I'll keep buying"
"This just came out: Federal regulators are asking Tesla Inc. to recall about 158,000 vehicles over safety concerns in what would amount to one of the biggest safety actions by the electric-vehicle maker. How will this effect the stock price?"
"Should hit 1600 by December 22. Thats parity with Xping. Thing is, adding in the fact that Tesla is light years ahead in tech and being well established and is making a profit, at 1600, Tesla is still undervalued relatively. So ....2000."
"If SpaceX merged with Tesla, adding 10 billion to the existing Tesla market cap, that would be an increase of about 8.2% from today's closing price. Actual calculation in my earlier post. This is just a conservative estimate; SpaceX is valued at $100B."
"I so hate this stock, planning to open a position if it goes at or below the 1 year 50 DMA, but seeing how its ignoring market share lost in EU and a major recall is unhealthy. Not to mention that every single car manufacturers will have a full range of EV cars next year so competition will be fierce. EV, solar and windmills are the way to go for sure, but we are in a massive bubble at the moment."
Loaded up yesterday. Will not sell one single share till $2500. Once star link goes online this thing will look dirt cheap. I am late to the party but I will make more than most early birds because they take small profit too soon
BOYCOTT ROBINHOOD! These are suppose to be FREE MARKETS. What’s next?$TSLA $NIO $AAPL $LAZR $SBE $IPV $CCIV
"legit question.. given TSLA financial ties to EV Credits, what happens when all car companies meet their quota...?"
"GM shares skyrocketing, as they finally decided to lace up their cleats, and join the EV game. Ever watch the Keanu Reeve's movie ""The Replacements""? Tesla, thanks for entertaining us for a while, and fans, sorry for the high ticket prices, but you were the only game in town, until now. Teslarians, please clear out your lockers, the pros have arrived."
"To justify this valuation Tesla needs to sell north of 60 million cars per year. Even if Elon delivers 50% compounded growth per year, the current valuation will be justified in 13 years from now, assuming a) no competition b) they improve earnings c) there is no recession. Then the share price should improve. #biggestbubbleinhistory"
soufflé!!!! Cult god did warn you
Total bloodbath in the markets today. Stay strong longs this is just a buying opportunity!!!!
Over 900$ today!!!
THE CARS ARE DRIVING THEMSELVES 
"The best Porsche Taycan starting at $185,000 can't do anything near based on specs what Tesla is just about to make available for sale with the Plaid Model S starting at $119,990 and that's leaving aside the even better Plaid+ to come out later in 2021. Porsche spent almost $7 billion to develop that car, dwarfing what Tesla has spent on development in their entire history as a company for all products combined, and I hope Porsche ups their game because it's getting embarrassing for them right now."
"If people pay 41000$ for BTC and BTC doest build anything, why not Tesla 1500$ a share?"
"On the phone with my broker this morning. He stated a downside to $700 level in the coming weeks. Way over valued. I buckled and sold. Hopefully buy back in at this said mark. Uncertainty with market and upcoming administration. I've made so much but im willing to protect it. I love Elon and his visions not only in vehicles, but space, solar and possible AI. News blip out today from one of tesla shorts that has called the down side and to be ready to short. I don't know how to short and don't care to, but he's been on target in the past. Rough road ahead for a while? Watch the gold prices for an indication of a market correction. GLTA. Sad to be out but being protective of my Tesla fortune."
"electric cars put out tons of electromagnetic waves which are bad for health causing some to get sick, headaches etc.."
Can’t understand why it’s trading at this level when VW made 12B and it’s only 87B market cap? I’m gonna buy the puts for this stock because it’s defies logic
time to sell and buy NIO guys..will not get better sales from here on..NIO is and will continue to take business..too much competition coming for tesla in North America as well
Not sure how any proud American can invest in $NIO or really any other Chinese tech company for that matter. They are basically SELLING OUT to China. We all know that the leaders of much of this new technology being developed now will most likely also be leading this world in the future.$TSLA $LI $F
Will the Tesla bubble burst today or this will happen next week ? BITCOIN buy or not ?
$TSLA Will always be better than nio they have Elon musk nio is just riding Tesla wave from last year of Tesla wouldn’t went up a lot last year nio still would be in the single digits $NIO no one will buy a nio instead of a Tesla everyone knows China doesn’t make reliable products
"We will get a tiny down move today but it won't be nearly enough. It might move down $10 or $20. This stock would be overpriced at $400. The issue is that there's too much magical thinking right now. There's a lot of competition and the market is treating Tesla as if has none. This magical thinking will eventually ebb away, but it may take quite some time. It could take a year for this thing to correct like it should."
Another two bucks and my $288 short position will be underwater. I'm so terrified. This ongoing epic squeeze Elon promised has me close to the edge; jason and Bernard must be getting wood.
"yea, hope yall getting in on this dip"
"So many poor souls are on here wishing they were as rich as mr Musk but instead they have to settle for drooling,lying and wishing his company bad come on shorts and trolls on this board look in the mirror youre Nobody compared to Elon musk so go make beds and dont be jealous of the Big Boys"
Congrats to tesla on all its 2020 achievements and it’s miracles growth!
Revenue from regulatory credits shot up 202% to $401 million.
$gm is looking as good or better than $tsla and $nio (combined)
We didn’t miss by much longs ...695 
Sell it and buy AMC!
i would focus heavily on amzn tomorrow guuys it will announce xmas earnings!
I think we could see green today more news and possible upgrades.
"This stock is incredible... 150,000 recalls and it goes up!!!! ... I love it!!!!!!"
$TSLA will procure $FSR solid-state battery in the long run
... next BXMT back 2008 !
"hey @Karter, did ford ever repay that taxpayer funded bankruptcy bailout loan from 10 years back?"
Merry Christmas all. That’s including you shorts.. what a year though ey? EOY $750 
"If you're panic selling to some algo bot, I pity you. This is the easiest stock in the market."
its normal that a drop happen.. stock cant not go up everyday
Tesla is now handled by computer program of Market Makers. Buyers done buying. Sellers done selling. It is now it is autopilot of computer algorithms.
900 tomorrow
"I'm not pumping at all, I've done my DD a lot on this company. They've already sold the gold mine last week and are awaiting profit results this week which will easily skyrocket this stock from 0.05-0.20 , 5x-20x depending on the figure. This company is also working on a gold backed cryptocurrency that has already been finalized and we are only awaiting the next steps, this is a x100 $1 catalyst by itself. This company is in the process of having it's finances audited through cpa waters, and when complete, this ticker will be immediately uplisted to higher tier otc. The 2020 financials and quarterly revenue is 5x higher than ever before which is a multiple cent increase x3-4 by itself. This company has multiple other mines, including a lithium mine that can provide resources for the electric vehicle sector, aka $TSLA. This stock is x20+ short term, x100+ long term. Goldman has it at a 9 cent PT short term, which is a 9x increase from it's current price of .01, but that is nothing compared to the actual value of this stock. This stock is on absolute fire right now, about to explode, 1700 followers on ST up from only 10 a month ago. We got mms, shorts, and bears absolutely sweating bullets, posting misinformation, trying to cover and scare people away so they can grab cheaper shares before the boom,, but it's too late, next week, we climb, and we climb very fast. Not only considering the flawless DD on this stock, but also, the chart is perfectly positioned for the jump to orbit. $TSNP x3600 in 5 weeks, $AABB is lined up for the same! Don't let insane shorts and mm scare you with their loud mouths and trash talk, they just want cheaper shares! Good luck, and Love you all!    "
My one concern is earnings has to be perfect and forward guidance has to be perfect at these levels. There isn't room for anything else.
More then likely will be a great long term buy but this gotta be FOMO and some lol healthy correction is needed. I can’t imagine people are adding to their positions or opening new positions at this expense. TSLA is about to have the market of FB on 1/3 the revenue 
"Bond yields are starting to rise. Few more points of increase and the stocks correction is inevitable even with the money printers on full speed.After many months. I am peaceful finally, shorting Tesla. This was a painful ride but 2021 is making it visibly clear how competition is catching up. I did not guess that obvious information has to be spoon fed to longs here. Sleep well shorts. No more elasticity left stocks. More and more people are seeing the risks in equities and more are moving to bonds"
Going down should not even be a topic with Tesla. The s&p inclusion alone will force buying for months to come. The big question is what price will the split occur this time? 2k 3k 4K 5k.......pick one
20 BILLION IN ELON HANDS>>>>25K CHINA TESLA COMING CHINA DESIGN STUDIO>>>NEW CYBER TRUCK FACTORY IN TEXAS>>>AND ONE IN BERLIN>>>>SALES WILL DOUBLE AND TRIPLE WITHIN 5 YEARS>>>>TESLA IS TAKING OVER AUTO INDUSTRY>>>ESPECIALLY WITH FULL SELF DIVE COMING OUT THIS YEAR AND CYBER TRUCK WILL BEING ALL NEW CUSTOMER BASE STAY LONG FOING TO 1000
"Could GM be an attractive acquisition target because of it's vast reservoir of automotive engineering and manufacturing talent? GMs assets in factories, engineers and know-how could become an attractive acquisition for those with deep pockets interested in entering the EV marathon. That would include AAPL, TSLA and AMZN, etc., all which easily have the financial means of acquiring GM. Those three are all in the race with some hiding their full interest. The company who acquires the GM assets could easily win this race. GM shareholders would give up over 50% of their holdings for a purchase price between $100 to $200 billion. With the present market cap at $60 billion, that would put the price of GM shares at $100 to $150. Imagine the full know-how and assets of GM in the hands of Elon Musk! No one and I mean no one could compete."
"Thanks TSLA, broke half a mil today"
this things about to fly
three million airbags recalled by ford......engines out all over the place.....they will probably be doing airbags behind the engine jobs and crashing cars......dont invest in ford thats for sure

"Jeez people, look at the millions and millions of dollars dumped in the last 2 weeks by insiders! Wake up!!!! Earnings are coming they already know its going to be bad news! If insider buying is good news then insider selling is....."
Saving ACM from closing down. short seller is forcing most of the smaller company to close. guys theater is a place of memories. from youngster to old. save the memories of all. save the fun laughter and joy in the cinema. keep the short seller away. come to ACM fight and hold
NOKIA will be the next TSLALets go $NOK
"Go buy NIO, time to run from this..."
Tesla is way overvalued; all other cars manufacturers are ramping up EVs. Tesla PE of 1501 is called a Bubble^Bubble.
"I'm just so eager to know when the next split is and what the ratio might be! 5:1, 8:1, 10:1?? What do you think?"
"TSLA is not a car company. Cars just happen to be one of their products. They are a technology company, a battery company, and a leader in EV car technology. Even GM can compare given they have had EVs for 10 years now. When companies like TSLA are looked at in the stock market traditional measures are difficult. It is, for sure, higher risk than say Ford and TSLA's dynamics defy gravity. If you can't roll with that then you should not own TSLA."
"Anyone else notice the triple top? Very Bearish, technically speaking."
"If you own $TSLA but can't afford to purchase more shares, compensate it from $NIO while is cheap. Nio is the next China Tesla."
Does anybody think Tesla will buy Ford. That will give Tesla immediate scale and accretive earnings
"Multi-billionaire Chamath P, very early Tesla and Bitcoin investor stated on CNBC, Tesla going to 2X-3X from here. Energy disruptor."
"Only smart people can see tesla unlimited potentials.Those that are screaming fraud, miss the boat, and hurting crying baby shorties will always hate TESLA.U SELL I BUY, TESLA TO THE MOON."
"Do a search and check out the Feds coming for Tesla’s quality issues. I guess it’s on par with using Home Depot stuff to fix their cars and the bumpers/roofs falling off. I see one Tesla for every 1,000 cars and that soon will be way too many, just like this stock."
EVERYONE IS FORGETTING ONE CRUCIAL THING>>>THERE WAS A GLOBAL PANDEMIC LAST YEAR>>>TESLA BEAT THEIR ESTIMATES FROM BEFORE THE PANDEMIC>>>>>IMAGINE WHAT THEY WILL DO THIS YEAR WITH MORE FACTORIES PRODUCTS MARKETS AND FULL SELF DRIVE OH AND 20 BILLION STAY LONG BUY THIS DIP BOYS AND GIRLS
"Not only does NIO give 1000km with the new 150kW battery since it's replaceable you can upgrade your car with the new one.Tesla will crash not because I want to, but because this is a huge milestone of the competition."
We need shorts to go to 1000
About $600 away from realistic value
Elon is about to pass Bezos and Tesla is about to pass Facebook market cap alright Tesla let’s go fam 
Owning 1.2MM shares of this @ .0027 saved my portfolio from loss today since $TSLA didn't want to come out and play and $NIO is still blah.
"Hey longs, what’s your prediction on starlink ipo? How much will you put in? I might take half of my Tesla shares and go long on starlink."
"Tesla is more overvalued than even tech stocks in their prime. Including amazon, apple, google, Netflix, fb. Do the comparisons urself. This is gonna tank after earnings."
Rock solid!!!!! 4% a day just like clockwork!!!! 4% of sales 60% of market cap of all auto makers!!! To the moon!!
"My advice to the shorts to go feast somewhere else, otherwise they will be squeezed big time"
Should I buy TESLA or is this the highest moment for TESLA?
"Amazon P/E ratio in 2012/2013 ranged as high as , 1100, 3500 etc. Was amazon “overvalued?”"
Elon the Great!
Good post by Alex Kay.... why all of a sudden Apple car? Elon will run down Amazon and apple
No reason for TSLA to be down $70The only reason is a technical one as it was covering its GAP UP from last week!ButIt gapped down from $880 and it will cover that gap as well.Go TSLA!
GET SHORTIE

ANOTHER GoFundMe event? TSLA will finish green today. Who are we kidding?
Just keep buying anything with tech on the nasdaq....it doesn't matter throw a dart..it's free money even if it corrects 10 to 15 percent it's just gonna comeback stronger...there is absolutely 0 risk
$600 only for robinhooder’s from usa government. They cannot afford one share of tesla.
"I bought more calls yesterday because I see that a guy from Blackstone came out to talk down TSLA. What I see is Toyota, GM and VW start to make a big move, that shows how much panic they are.This year, TSLA will start to produce Semi Truck and Cyber Truck at Texas Giga factory. By second quarter, I guess TSLA MAY HAVE ANOTHER NEW DESIGN OF THE CONSUMER PICK UP TRUCK. IT WILL BE THE LAST NAIL TO PUT FORD AND GM INTO THE FOREST LAWN. I have no doubt that TSLA will hit 1,000 soon this year."
"Musk just called Georgia, and all but begged and threatened for them to ""find"" 550 Tesla deliveries."
Love it! they can’t write the articles fast enough. i was just reading article headline: “Tesla drops on downgrade”. i switch over and tesla is green!!
"Go cover your positions, Tesla shorties. Unless you like losing money...!"
"Dear Bears, there is currently a Tesla orbiting the Earth. I don’t think you understand. Maybe it’s expensive, but this isn’t Ford..."
short tsla long other car companies with EV potential. this hog is priced more than all other car companies combined.
Why is this not going to the moon if everybody knows that fund managers have to pay top dollar to get this stock on Friday?

"Sorry folks, it aint hittin' no grand in 24 hrs....."
All traffic lights are red but the Tesla traffic light shows green. Don't worry about the train...it will have it's reasons why it's green!
"“Tesla (TSLA) has a new Street high price target. Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch more than doubled his price target on the stock to $1,036 from $486.” good"
honestly this is massive miss 0.8 didnt expect this at all
"Not only am I predicting that this stock will get crushed soon, but also the whole market (especially Nasdaq). Powell stated that they will hold rates near zero “unless inflation rises”. It’s very clear the market has been getting pumped (especially Tesla) due to stimulus (inflation worries)- assets (stocks) go up due to the dollar being worth less and not due to fundamentals- p/es are at historic highs for multiple stocks (do the fact check yourself, simple google check of historic p/es- this includes forward p/es). Now we’re between a rock and hard place. If the Dems get another stimulus approved, that means a rise to inflation. If inflation rises, that means feds increase interest rates. The last time they increased rate, the nasdaq dropped ~20% in 2018. If the Dem stimulus doesn’t pass, there is no more reason for worry of inflation and people move to cash, especially due to overvaluation. RIP to FOMOs"
"To justify this share price Tesla would have to produce over 50% of all cars sold globally. Currently in the countries with the highest adoption of ev vehicles they are losing ground to the likes of VW.Ask yourself if you think Tesla’s price will increase because you want it to, or because it is actually undervalued."
"Wow, so fricken predictable. I think a drunk monkey could’ve told you it would recover and then go green. The S&P 500 will be exposure to a broader group of investors in a lasting way. Like hundreds of years Ford type of way. It simply opens the pool to a more risk averse investor. Prepare for hard- immovable dollars to back this company in a way it hasn’t before. Like vandguard."
"That moment you realize that TSLA is just getting starting and will be well over $10,000 soon. JUST IMAGINE if a BTC (Aircoin) can hit almost 1 trillion in value. How much is the most innovative and fastest moving company in the world worth??"
"Tesla TSLA Reports Q4 2020 Earnings Results $0.80 EPSTesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), the California EV maker reported Adj EPS (non-GAAP) of US $0.80 per share, and record revenue of US $10.744 billion for Q4 2020, exceeding Wall Street's average estimate. After Tesla trading officially closed on January 27, 2021, the company released its Shareholder Letter before its Q4 2020 Earnings Call, which will be hosted today at 3:30 p.m. Pacific Time / 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time.HIGHLIGHTSCashOperating cash flow less capex (free cash flow) of $2.8B in 2020$4.9B increase in our cash and cash equivalents in Q4 to $19.4BFree cash flow $1.9B in Q4Profitability$721M GAAP net income; $2.5B non-GAAP net income in 2020$270M GAAP net income; $903M non-GAAP net income (ex-SBC*) in Q4$575M GAAP operating income; 5.4% operating margin in Q4SBC expense increased to $633M in Q4OperationsHalf a million vehicles produced and delivered in 2020Model Y production at Gigafactory Shanghai started in December 2020Updated Model S and Model X launched in January 2021FINANCIAL SUMMARYRevenueTotal revenue grew 46% YoY in Q4. This was primarily achieved through substantial growth in vehicle deliveries as well as growth in other parts of the business. At the same time, vehicle average selling price (ASP) declined by 11% YoY as our product mix continued to shift from Model S and Model X to the more affordable Model 3 and Model Y.ProfitabilityOur operating income improved in Q4 compared to the same period last year to $575M, resulting in a 5.4% operating margin. This profit level was reached while incurring SBC expense attributable to the 2018 CEO award of $267M in Q4, driven by an increase in our market capitalization and a new operational milestone becoming probable.Positive impact from volume growth and regulatory credit revenue growth YoY was mainly offset by lower ASP (including price reduction of China-made Model 3 and price reductions of Model S and Model X before the introduction of updated models) but also by a series of notable items. These included a portion of Q@4 SBC charges, vehicle warranty accruals, additional supply chain costs, Model S and Model X changeover costs and other items.CashQuarter-end cash and cash equivalents increased to $19.4B in Q4, driven mainly by our recent capital raise of $5.0B (average price of this offering was -$632/share) and free cash flow of $1.9B, partially offset by early debt repayments (early conversion of convertible notes)."
Thanks goodness it's down. A great opportunity to buy more TSLA shares.
Margins are really showing now. Anxious to see how much revenue from environmental credits. I expect most of the earnings. That means margins are hurting. Margins matter when your a 800+ billion dollar company. More expensive than all car companies on the planet combined.
"Hold hold hold,you have come this far,stick with it,believe "
1000 SHARES TESLA STRONG. TSOI next 1000 RETURN GAURANTEED..
"Institutions have to sell their other holdings to cover their losses on meme stocks. Tesla will rebound, but might see $450 coming."
TSLA's margins will be destroyed by excessive competition and the next recession like every other auto maker in history.
Why is Tesla up 50 Billion today? IN MARKET CAP
Don't get excited and buy this level just because historically it always gone up. Some point every stock go down.Look at $ZM Zoom just couple month ago it look non-stop force at any price that will never go down. Today it go bounceless while break very very strong long term Support line. Likely unfortunate case Just amazing how much money power use going using algo that design to build pattern that people believe and even break it in way that anyone thing it's imposible to trap retail investor.
Don't care where it stops I own 5000 shares
SHORTIES BE LIKE
goldman sachs upgrades tesla to 1100/shr.
model Y from Berlin will probably have 450 miles range. At that point all talks about competition will instantly stop. Not even Gordon Johnson will be invited again for the comedy value.

Lets be honest....if the earnings report was good.......someone on Wall Street would have got wind of it and the SP would have been green today.It has been red all day and no sign of tur ing green. If this ER is good and the stock rises AH....I will be shocked.Calling it now....poor ER.
what's with the analyst that put a target of $60-$80 for TSLA in the coming months?? Is this possible?
Finall 900!!
Who else is enjoying watching Twitter stock sink? I am! Blaaaa haha
WEDBUSH RAISES TESLA TARGET PRICE TO $950 FROM $715
Tesla is an energy company building cars to fund that. Just as Ferrari built cars to fund its racing.
Thank you to those posters who told me to buy Tesla before it splits!I’m sitting pretty ...
"""Morgan Stanley just bought up about 50,000 shares of $numi. Never seen them buy a block like that, usually little 100-1000 chunks. Good to see. $morganstanley #morganstanley #tsla $tsla #psychedelics"""
"Toyota expects to sell 16m vehicles in 2021. That's 21 times 750k, which is tesla 2021 estimate. Yet TSLA is worth 2.5x more than Toyota.I get that TSLA is not only a car company and that someday their revenues may come from other sources, but they are also not a pure software company. They car sales portion of the company will never scale or have margins like a pure software company. The economics of the car business will be more like Toyota.Even if TSLA price was cut in half, it would be speculative. At this price, it's rather insane. Just my opinion."
Apple is no close to Tesla in terms of cars. The biggest advantage that Tesla has is the date it collects from hundreds of thousands of cars running on the road right now.
Hey to all you Tesla owners I would like to pass some friendly advice on to you . If you have a model with white leather interior I highly recommend not buying gas station burritos and travelling in your Tesla . The aftermath is devastating
everyone scared after model S refresh and negative reviews online. This will crater 50-70% then we will see if it survives

"Byrne, so you bring all the gloom so it justifies your short position on S&P. have you thought that you would bet against America? Against all these retirees and future retirees who are in the hundreds of millions of people. to you, it's only a short position to profit, but to them it's their life saving for their retirements..... if you are so concerned about the economy and the well fare of the people, you should do what is socially responsible, don't bet against America. Warren Buffett used to recommend the index funds to invest instead of his own Berkshire, his wife is all invested in the index funds. so are you being socially responsible to short against S&P?"
"MILLIONAIRE WITH SHORTING TESLA, THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITY.I increase my shorts AGAIN.THE TIME IS OVERDUE FOR A BIG BIG CORRECTION....PE OVER 1600.Recall of 160.000 vary with no influence on stock price......the bubble makes the last bubble before it will burst very very extreme.

"If I put in a sell order (GTC) for $5.00 and someone else puts in a sell order (GTC) at $5.50 and the equity opens up at $6.00, which order will be filled first by the market maker?"
Tesla will be up after market close today...watch it on Monday.
"Tesla has delivered 500 k cars in 2020 the un-normal year, also Tesla has jumped to an almost 700% since the start of the pandemic of 2020 That is really a unique and an amazing phenomenal. Question here: now can anyone imagine how far this stock can go in normal year of 2021? If we say the stock will jump just 400% this year that will lead us to 2800 after split and in worst case scenario to 2000 which is 250% by the end of this year. I think only crazy people sell this stock, for me, that better than buying gold or crypto. Will hold it forever and sky is the limit of this baby"
"In the latest delivery report released on Thursday, Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) beat most analysts' delivery estimates by handing ownership over to about 88,400 customers in Q1 (Form 8-K filing is here). This was, as expected, a record for any 1st quarter. It easily beat 1Q19 since Model 3 deliveries did not begin in Europe and China until mid-February last year, so Tesla's numbers benefited this year from worldwide deliveries of Model 3 for the entire month of January and early February.However, the ratio of vehicles built versus delivered in the quarter was the worst since 1Q19. While Tesla indeed delivered 88,400 units, it represented 86% of the total production of 102,672 vehicles resulting in a surplus of 14,272 units. Combined with excess inventory from prior quarters, Tesla's unsold inventory spiked to 26,961 units, an increase of 112% from 4Q19.First, we can see the huge increase in unsold units that soared 120%. Part of this increase occurred in China in Jan/Feb where Model 3 deliveries were 83% of production (5,487 deliveries vs. 6,583 units produced. We are still a few weeks away from verifiable March numbers). Europe also appears to have ended with a large surplus inventory. During the quarter, seven ships transported units to Zeebrugge, Belgium with a few continuing on to Southampton, England. TeslaMotorsClub.com member Troy does an excellent job of pulling verifiable data together to track most European sales. For Q1, his spreadsheet (here) shows 22,728 deliveries which are almost identical to 2019 at 22,759. Norway and The Netherlands have been replaced in the top spot by the U.K. This may not account for other smaller EU markets. But if each ship carried an average of 4,000 Tesla vehicles, we can see that a good portion of these unsold units is probably sitting in Europe, waiting to be delivered to buyers in Q2 due to the coronavirus shutdowns in many of those countries.Second, in the press release last week, Tesla oddly chose to combine Model 3 with Model Y production and delivery figures. Some would think they did this to hide relatively low figures for Model Y out the gate. But if we look back to 3Q17, in the above chart, Tesla had no problem reporting just a few hundred cars in Model 3's initial quarter. It would seem Tesla is actually trying to mask the severe drop in Model 3 global sales which were the worst in a year since Q1 2019. That number last year was unusually low for several reasons. First, 4Q18 marked the end of the full $7,500 FITC in the U.S. which pulled Q1 sales forward into Q4. Second, Model 3 deliveries in both China and Europe did not begin until about halfway through the quarter in mid-February. This, of course, made 1Q20 deliveries look better in a YoY comparison.It has been and still is my belief that moving the introduction of the Model Y forward to March from later in the year was due to the slowing of orders for the Model 3 and to fill a drop in revenue that Tesla has known was coming in the first half of 2020. This became very clear last year when total U.S. revenue dropped $2.2 billion from 2018 levels."

"Test drove a Model Y Wednesday and it's true what they say, the car sells itself."
"Tesla shareholders are not looking ""into the future"" when investing; they are looking into their imaginations. Many of them are quite intelligent and have excellent imaginations; the problem is: they are imagining things without a good foundation in science, math, or business knowledge -- a foundation that allows one to imagine future events with high degrees of accuracy. Their imagination is effectively delusion because it is based on seriously flawed premises."

Chinese coal use has been soaring for the past several months because of the increased demand for electric power (most of which is provided by coal). Virtually every analyst is predicting a rapid increase of EV use in China which will require huge additional amounts of coal to power the generators to charge their batteries. Good for the environment!!

"I'm sure this will 'eventually' be higher, but this is due for a big bitcoin style collapse. Remember when bitcoin fell from 19k to 3k, and took years before making new highs? I can see Tesla doing something similar and falling to 200-300 and taking years to make it back up."
Why is the price skyrocketing afterhours? What do they know?
TSLA the only stock I'm aware of capable of jumping 100 points in a single week. The 800s will be gone by next week. 1000 could be here before the end of the month at this rate.
"From Motley Fool today's article: (sorry longs to ruin your party)...""To justify an $800 billion valuation, Tesla has to grow quickly -- and for a long time. If the electric vehicle maker ""only"" quadruples its sales over the next decade, the stock is bound to plunge sooner or later. Even if Tesla develops meaningful ancillary profit streams over time (e.g., recurring services revenue, battery sales to other automakers, an autonomous ride-hailing network, etc.), the company would probably need to grow sales to at least 10 million vehicles annually to justify its current valuation. It would also have to sustain margins far better than any other major automaker has ever managed."""
This is the stock that hedge funds should short. It is probably worth about $100 per share now. I was planning to short it if it got to $1T valuation.
i think you guys will see apple and tesla earnings and get a gut reality check but still great companies y'all but you guys getting big brained by the media
I recall in middle school classmates lighting off a stink bomb. Could not get out the exits fast enough. That earnings report by Elon was the stink bomb and tesla fools are trying to get out the exits.

Holding on to a 80k loss on my tsla short position. Not sure how much longer I can hold
"Ahahaha Elon Musik did twitter for $GME TY Elon, will buy more $TSLA shares and calls from the gains ;D"
The real reason for the upgrade is you have to have a buy rating to win the business for the next secondary offering of stock (which will dilute the shares further) expect Elon to announce another secondary offering soon. I’m sure the stock will keep going up regardless. Buy buy bye bye
"Just an observation... Shorts are not going after this stock anymore so there will be no more squeezes?

This is not because of shorts. Traders and hedge funds bought shares during the run up expecting to sell them to S&P 500 index funds today. Evidently there were more shares available to sell than there was demand to buy them.
"To all my friends who have a big position in this stock. Take profit today. Have heard that many big shareholders will cash out later today. Take your profit now! If you already have 500% gain, then cash out and enjoy it before it´s to late.Your friend $imon."
"Once Tesla confirms guidance over 800K deliveries the stock price will shoot to $950 but the squeeze could take that to $1,000"
"get ready for lift off, over $1000 after earnings!"
Should we expect the market cap to increase proportionate to the number of vehicles sold or do you guys expect instead for 1.3 million per car to have 5 million per car when Tesla has 2 million cars delivered because they are taking over the galaxy and will have a monopoly on all the wheels?

"I see that $IZEA made a $35 million (5 million share) offering. Well, $JMIA, $NNDM, $FCEL, $NIO, $GME, and $TSLA continued rocketing to the moon after their stock offerings. The stock market exists in a different dichotomy (first time I use this word) than it did in the past. My first experience in the stock market was in the 2005-2006 period, which is relatively close to after the DOTCOM bubble. It was a horrible bear market, then, all you could do as a long was watch your steady demise. Look at the 2005-2006 charts for most companies, to see why anyone immersed in the days of those years saw no hope. A stock offering done at that time was an immediate death knell for the stock of the company doing the offering, sending the stock into a tailspin down to $0.Jump to 2021, and things couldn't be any different, things couldn't be any better! Along with the start of a new era of smart tech and forward thinkers, we are experiencing one of the best stock markets ever. The stock market is no longer about revenues and profits, but about causes. Now when there is an offering, the FED steps in to keep the floor from falling under investors' feet. The idea is to recognize economic realities, that livelihoods should not rely on what commercial activities dictate, but on the objective values brought to society. Let me explain with examples. $JMIA cannot be worth what it is worth now and in the future based on financials, but it is the Amazon of Africa, and it is indispensable for Africa's future. Similarly, $IZEA cannot be worth what it is worth now and in the future based on financials, but it is enabling influencers to earn an income, a growing, and today very important and relevant, segment of the population. By helping to support influencers, $IZEA is performing an essential service and, therefore, must be placed at high value."
"So, that's it then.. Elon got the BIG AUTO hooked on crack (EV's) and now BIG AUTO won't be able to get their fix (due to battery shortage). Bottomline, nobody has more cells secured than Tesla, but EVERYBODY has committed - so, who's gonna hurt here?"

Full self driving will be out within one to two months. Okay, $GME longs, love you  come over to $TSLA ASAP, or when $GME is $1000 "
"This message is for any new Tesla members. There is a lot of fear spread on this board by short sellers .. often messages about Tesla falling. For example, there were tonnes every other minute about stock tanking the week after s&p inclusion. It’s true the price was volatile around the inclusion but it rebounded to new highs. I used to get worried about these warnings so much so that I sold once too early and it cost me in fees, taxes and missed opportunity $. Since then I bought back in and gained, but I would have been much much wealthier had I not sold.Summary point is don’t be scared by their warnings. Tesla has a bright future, is lead by a revolutionary genius, and continues to go up despite small set backs here and there. Be strong and hold especially on red days. Don’t give into the FUD by shorts ... it’s a trick, they want your shares at a discount. Remember my words, you will be rewarded "
Tesla should reach all time high today if Elon put some of their money on Bitcoin.
$TSLA adds minimum 8% every single day at P/E=1540 and it is just normal to everyone. It surprises nobody anymore.
How shorts feel here amongst all the longs.
Not bad added 16 billion in market cap when they announce a competitor. The insanity
"Nio delivered 7,007 vehicles in December 2020. Up 121% year over year"
"823.00 ... wow, this is going to hit hard"
Tesla China VP Confirms 1st MIC Model Y Deliveries Begin this Month as Demand Soars
Price spike during after hour trading. Could anyone confirm this please ?
We made $771+!!!!!Long and STRONG!!!!
Same story as 2000.... but earnings are much more creative.........
"At the end of last Friday it was very clear that the supply was constrained and thus the price escalation. In my humble opinion and I don't have data backing it up, the funds were not able to buy it last week as the price escalate drastically and it did not want to pay the high price. We may see some price escalation later today as they will try to buy again. My guess is that the index funds will try to get in around 655-675ish... let's see if this is correct as today unfolds."
Ark invest has 2 percent of nanox on his izrl etf. That is huge! He only has .2 percent of $tsla in his ark investment
"Tesla is up 2X market cap and 1X market cap of GM in just today's tradingTesla is up by half of Ford market cap and a quarter of GM market cap after hours.Including AH, it has gained 2.5X of Ford's market cap and 1.25X of GM's market cap today!"
You'd think panic sellers and profit takers would have learned their lesson by now!
BUY THIS DIP BOYS AND GIRLS>>>>>THE SCREE CHANGE WAS FOR FULL SELF DRIVE ACROSS ALL MODELS>>>STAY LONG BUY THIS GREAT OPPERTUNITY<<<
I love how TSLA shorts are shortsighted. We at price that 10 days ago would be ATH. But shorts think we are going to crash because we are -2% in day where whole market is red. While best earnings ever are only 2 weeks away.When they will learn ? ... I bet never.
once earnings or the lack of come to light this thing will return to pre hype levels.
Reminds me of battery day.
"Longs, Institutions own 52% of floating shares, index funds are buying 12%, and Musk owns 20%, and we as retail investors only get to have 16%. Houston, we have a stock supply issue."
Tesla the stock has clearly disconnected from tesla the company. I wonder if the options trading on the stock causes it to continue to rise?
BUY WITH BOTH HANDS BUY BUY
"Analysts are starting to realize that the higher TSLA stock price, the easier TSLA can fund its growth, and the more valuable it should be. But the other virtuous cycle they haven't considered is that people who buy TSLA stock will buy TSLA cars, and the higher the stock, the easier they are able to afford the car."
This needs to simmer for a while
Nearly a trillion dollar company. Barely turns a profit. Too funny. Need a reality check here. The market can't keep looking 10 years ahead. A lot can go wrong before than.
Someone tell Elon to help out $TSLA
"Big Dip coming on entire market. False security based on printing money, feds buying bonds, keeping interest rates low. Ride it out or take profits. It’s your choice."
This balloon will drop lower today and when it reaches at 660 that balloon will burst.
I dont know what to say.... if only i didnt sell the long term calls.... my porftolio is still 100% tesla but i could never see this coming....
LOL Tesla's $270 million in net income last quarter was buoyed by its sale of $401 million in regulatory credits to other automakers.
"$GM $F $TSLA $AAPL $XLE $OXY $XOM & $CVX Don’t fall for the whole “OIL IS DEAD JUNK”. We will transition to green energy over the next 20 years. In the meantime, We’ve just begun thr next secular bull market for oil - over the next 12-15 years supply will be constrained by regulators while they push electric cars - but where does the electricity come from to charge the batteries? Natural Gas....Developing countries can’t afford the electric transition. They will first grow their economies on “old” tech - fossil fuels. Oil isn’t dead. It’s a sleeping giant. Get in now."
So many calls at $850 expiring today
GNRC market cap 16.8 billion up 5 times in 2 years. Its power business seems much more dominant than TSLA's. How much should TSLA's power service be worth?
How is this worth more than 3X Toyota?
All the bashers here saying when it crashes people will lose money. Well yeah but if they only give back some of what they gained it isn't losing. I've only had shares since the end of November that I bought just under $550. It would have to drop 30% from the current levels and I'd still be even. So anyone who has had it pre split is not going to lose sleep thinking they might go broke. They have a ton of green to play with.
More than past I am more concerned about future.. to buy/ hold/ or sell
"The stock is priced for massive growth and flawless execution. That didn't happen today. If Tesla can grow unit sales at 25% per year rather than 50% per year, it's not worth half its current value."
Buy more Tesla. Tesla is currently 4400 pre-split. This was 255 back in October 2019. Elon musk is a genius￼￼￼￼
Most overvalued company EVER. Retracement of 90% is gd for the stock long term.
"TSLA bearish, open puts at market open 771 target"
thank god @cosmin can't actually afford a share. if he shorted 100 tesla shares hed be 100k in debt
Will go back up. Not to worry
Well here's another opportunity buy buy buy

Good earnings. Much buyers on the end of the day.
Bubble popping finally?
Do people realize that the stock price of Tesla is 3700 $
10 percent correction coming
The short squeeze Will cost Hedge funds 300 billion dollars to settle all the call Bets that are in the money paying thousands of % higher than they are already have made this has just begun to fall IMHO GLTA
"Trading a stock like this,there are 3 camps. The true believers who have been well rewarded for their beliefs and will scream utter outrage when a correction comes. The shorts who have been slaughtered. And those of us who trend trade this fast mover, with the upper bias always in mind. Its a mover and a great trader, a good income to be earned long or short does not matter. Only profits matter."
"Howdy Folks!As of Friday, we hit a 1 trillion dollar market cap here.That's taking into account the fully diluted shares outstanding!End of Quarter 3 numbers there were roughly 1.105 billion shares outstanding. equaling 976 Billion Dollar market cap!Now take the extra shares outstanding we were slightly over 1 trillion dollar market cap!That's a WOW!Considering when you take the top 18 auto manufactures with their 836 Billion Dollar market cap combined!Plus they make 1.7 Trillion dollars a year in revenue!I'm sorry folks I don't think Tesla will ever make that much money!"
Where’s Gordon Johnson? He is a laughing stock of the Wall Street.
$TSLA wealth generator has run out of fuel. Take profit and put some in the silver short squeeze bet $AG. Next wealth generator! $AG First Majestic
Have my stocks for the year:Tesla NIO Moderna What does everyone have for there top stocks this year 
"to the Tesla bulls...how do you feel about the fact that Tesla's profitability is down partly because of the stock compensation for Elon (who happens to be the richest person in the world...lol) coupled with the fact that the short percentage on this company is at historic lows, hopefully there aren't any calls for WSBs to come ""save Tesla"" on this forum"
"2018 was a breakout year for AMZN, and in Jan its valuation matched TSLA’s last week. By March, it matched TSLA’s today. By Aug, AMZN would climb to $1T, then beyond...BUT TSLA IS NO AMZN!"
keep her going up...the higher the better...lol
Reaching $ 1000 Today and Around $ 1200 By the Earning.. Just Look at the History for Reference.... bel it or not but Hx is repeating. !!
The higher a valuation the higher the risk. Most people buy something after it already went up a lot thinking it will continue forever. An investor finds undervalued companies with good management and a clear business plan. A gambler just follows the others to the casino. Which one are you? :)
"There are some other safe cars also, like Volvos, but this is still a very good record. Values have to be part of this, remember the Pinto, it didn't take much to make it merely unsafe, as opposed to a rolling menace. https://www.autoblog.com/2021/01/12/tesla-model-y-nhtsa-crash-tests/"
THANKS LONGS
they squeezing AMC now
New to tsla. What does it usually do after earnings?
Thinking after the 20th this stock going up Best Buy now
"Bought shares in the dip, heading up to green. Classic move"
hello please suggest me what price I can buy
Thank you shorts. Without all this interest the longs couldn’t have this kind of gain. This boards activity is outstanding. Keep it up!
Man I had so much fun reading the comments on here. Seems like a lot of folks think Tesla just makes cars and thats it. LOL!
Fun fact: Apple reached a 1T market cap in 2018 when they were making close to 260B in revenue. So Tesla is about to reach that market cap with 31B in revenue? And 45B expected next year? Whoever thinks this isn’t overvalued by 400+B is beyond dreaming. Sell off post earnings!
"Kathy Wood 2018: ""Our $4,000 price target assumes that Tesla evolves from a hardware manufacturer with 19% gross margins to a company generating most of its profits from Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS)""so here we are.... $4000 pre-split price target achieved........ and not only have they made $0.00 with the fiction that is ""MaaS""..... but they're tracking BELOW the BEAR case Kathy Wood presented during that time for even auto...so according to 2018 Kathy Wood.... Tesla should be valued at sub-$700 pre-split.... that'd be less than $150 a share today."
"Only day and ""a-short-time"" traders panic when $TSLA drops. We longs just laugh look forward to more future blessings."
I feel like sleepy Joe will help this stock since he has shut down all the oil pipelines and laid off thousands. What a guy! Keep wearing that mask! Do exactly what Joe tells you. He’s a grandmommy and is smarter than all of us. Thank God we have him!
Under 700 next week
Good luck everyone!
Nice AH move!
Check out BNGO for the next disruptive tech that is here to stay; setting up to double in the short term.
I think Tesla will keep going to $1k this month
Markets can CRASH ??
"A pe of 1688, sooner or later, sound minds will prevail."
any analyst doubling his price target likely has no business being an analyst. Talk about being wrong with a $486 price target....and then you just double it? Analysts with price targets are a scourge on Wall Street.
"Actually this should be $20,000 by End of YearCompany is worth $20 Trillion conservatively"
Bought more. Glad I could support.
Buy on good news?? Inclusion in the S&P 500 will tank a ton of shorts. Watch how many comment and down-like. They are scared shortless.
Tesla keeps moving up gradually....
"If TSLA is so good, ARK won't keep on selling TSLA in order to only keep 10-12% of its total...I heard Youtubers paid for NIO , but not sure about TSLA ... in 2019 , per share was only $340/5"
TSLA good time to buy now or wait to fall ??? Please advise
"@ $750 pre-split this stock was so overvalued its not even funny. Now its at $3485 pre-split price. How are you people valuing this??? I am blown away. There is no way it is worth anything close to the current price. This is euphoria and mania!!! People, look at the stock, the underlying fundamentals, and the potential. Nothing gives this stock a valuation even close to 10% of its current price."
Time add another 8k on this moonlight sale. Thank you shorts or the panic crew
"Ride this Higher until you see a turn. Competition is certainly coming. Not just to TSLA autos, but also to their technology. Margins are going to get hurt with so many entering the field. They already are dropping car prices. Don't fight the trend higher but be on the alert."
"stock bubble over, sold today and went short"
"If Tesla crashes the S&P 500, that may lead to a panic in the overall market."
bagholders gonna lose alot as shorts are now at amc and gamestop
I am starting to think this is a new era of investing. Pe doesnt matter in this company. Its all about trust in Elon and his products and innovation.
Happy New Year shorts! How was your year hahaha?
Tesla's profit taking going into NIO today? At the stock exchange in Frankfurt already 14 percent up
Where can we find how much dividend tesla pays per year?

News out!!! Starting 2021 with every Tesla you will get a Tesla electric bicycle in case your battery runs out. In addition you get a crankshaft that you can rotate to recharge your vehicle in case you want to have more alternatives.See picture in link below: https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-12-1463071724-3073011-Donkeyoperatesthegrindingmill.jpgThe Musk church wishes everyone a happy new year!!!

"if you don't own tesla shares and still post here, its safe to say you earn a minimum wage salary that requires you post here. yet I'm a millionaire"
$250G is coming soon!
"Elon just announced literally the best car in any category ever made  1.9 seconds, 500+ miles, FSD etc"
So tomorrow is the vote on whether 600 or 2k check
"doesn't get any better than that - well received is an understatement. cash for 2 more factories able to produce another million cars a year, in the bank.and to look forward to in the near term:S&P buy in,followed by a deliveries smash,maybe followed by the announcement of another factory or two somewhere in the world,followed by a Q4 earnings beat,and looking towards mid 2021....Berlin and Austin factories cranking up!All of this intersperced with a couple SpaceX launches every month,woot!followed by another earnings beat"
"Tesla delivered 180,570 electric vehicles in the fourth quarter, beating its previous record as well as Wall Street expectations!"
Any other company posting this kind of an EPS miss after going up to the moon would have a 25% decline after hours.
"So if the cult targets Tesla next, does TSLA jump 200% also? This recent manipulation of shorted stocks will force legislation to corral behavior, and will be a detriment to legitimate traders/investors."
STAY LONG GOING TO 1000 ON Q4 EARNINGS<>>>>STAY LONG<<
"Wow, this really got stuck between 888 and 890. It means the shorts are not having enough power, but the bulls are not having enough steam to push it up. It is also a signal this is going to break the resistance."
Thats what I call a happy ending.
Another great article about how competition is slowing TSLA....cannot believe they actually sold less cars year over year in Europe and the stock sits where it is.....completely overvalued!
I talked to an expert he says fair value will be 5000 a share soon
"If/when this hits 1k a share I will certainly begin shorting. Ill start with just 5 shares, and add 5 for every 100 dollar level upwards. If somehow it manages to go to 2k ill take my loss. I give myself a 95% chance of success."
"Arkk sold a 151,000 shares today"
Anyone else look at $TSLA options today? Total bloodbath with the call options.
Remember TSLA is not just a car company. GO long or go home.
The same guys that tell you P/E or P/S are irrelevant tell you that revenue and sales will double next year. You didn't take into account the financials to justify current MC so why are you using the same metrics to justify the future MC?
TESLA IS GOING TO THE MOON 1000 HERE WE COME>>>>CYBER TRUCK FULL SELF DRIVE COMING OUT THIS YEAR<<< >>>STAY LONG
Attn Sahreholders: you have to own AT LEAST 500 shares of tesla otherwise your dream if getting rich will pass. 300 shares wont do it.
"Tesla will be a 3,000 stock next year! Better buy up now or you’ll be left behind."
"Nio sells ok cars and the coming ET7 is mostly vaporware at this point. Nio will never achieve much market outside of China, Just like Xpeng hasnt. Tesla does and will continue to dominate EV sales around the world."
Interesting when all teslanaires are celebrating how much their stocks are worth now and will forever long tsla because it's world changing and will continue to grow exponentially but not selling to secure their gains As far as I know percentage gain in robinhood doesnt turn into wealth until you sell your shares
TSLA is a $50 stock in 5 years when people realize they can’t charge monthly for FSD and an FSD taxi service isn’t going to break the bank it will likely be a money losing business. Even worse by the time that regulation happens other automakers like Hyundai will be in the game. Having said that short term I’m bullish.
"will Tesla become the biggest company in the world,will we all be driving around in robo taxis, autonomous driving, have solar panels on our roofs,battery packs in our houses living on green energy within 10 years?"
Any prediction for today and rest of the week?
"Imagine if the ETF buys the $80Billion tomorrow, wouldn’t be something!"

"Is Tesla a good stock to get into? I’ve got like $700 to spend on some. Oh, and I like muffins too."
"It doesn't matter if Tesla business make money, the money made from the stock is better than a decade of earning from selling EV"
"We keep having higher highs and higher closing highs and the people shorting the stock keep talking about how it's going to crash. Why do they have to get on this board to tell us it's going to crash? Just short the stock and you don't need to tell anyone what you're doing. Do you really think by you saying the stock is going to crash that people are going to sell a stock? Nonetheless, Happy New Year"
anyone know how long until FSD thats 99.99999% safe ..I hear alot of stuff the last four year and I see cool videos on instagram but how close are they really
NIO is your trend.... and the biggest real threat to Musky....
"sell it, go to a different ev stock, Tesla will go down 30% tomorrow!!!"
I have 75 shares as of now. I have no doubt I will become a millionaire within the 2020s; my question is whether I will become a multimillionaire or not by 2030. Or I mean multiteslanaire ;)
By his estimates if they can collectively buy 200b worth of tesla it will hit 4k/shr.
wow... all of us get a free upgraded mcu with recall. Excellent!
Is Elon smart enough to sell his shares before the bubble burst?

Finally broke 5 day vwap index buying is over good luck next week everyone
"Ya know...I like spending my days in a positive way...it AMAZES me how many Tesla bashers are on here. No one is encouraging you to believe in Elon's vision...or that he isn't just focused on the EV.So...why jump in a Tesla chat room if you keep saying "" The sky is falling."" "" Ponzi scheme!"" As of today this is still a Capitalist society. It took Bezos 14 years to turn a profit. Do you think he stayed primarily focused on book deliveries? You all believe in Ford? First auto manufacturer after the horse. Yet decades later they had close to 600k recalls over ELECTRIC issues and infamous brake issues on the F-150...and no vision that EV's were the future?Bottom line? Keep your day fulfilled, don't own a Tesla or buy the stock.Carry on my friend."
Hey guys let’s take a moment to realize how blessed we are to have money to buy Tesla stock and Bitcoin. There are those that currently have nothing over the holiday season. Let’s be greatful for each other and look for a prosperous year next year with Tesla. I wish all of you and your families a safe and happy holiday season.

I BET THERE IS ALOT OF SHORT INTEREST IN TESLA RIGHT NOW THAT THOUGHT EARNINGS WERE A DISAPPOINTMENT. ELON STRIKES AGAIN. WE MUST CRUSH THEM. LET THE BITCOIN SQUEEZE COMMENCE.
"Even with a 50% correction this stock will still be overpriced. Yes yes..taking into account all the good things and upside this company can offer. Who ever enjoyed the ride good for them (I was lucky to get a piece, but the party cant last forever so gear up for the freeefalllll "

One question to Tesla bulls: Do you really think the CCP is going to let Tesla dominate in China vs. Nio and the other domestics?
"(( Tesla has now over 650,000 reservations for the Cybertruck electric pickup, according to a new report from Wedbush. )) April 2020 - Tesla had 650,000 orders BUT decided to ""completely redesigned"" the Cyber Truck."
"While the kids are playing investor with failing companies like $GME, $BB and $NOK, the adults have been slowly adding to our positions in $XLE and $OXY.For those who are too young to understand, these are businesses with assets who sell their products for money. After the bills are paid, the remaining money is used to reinvest to make more money and return a portion to shareholders.Sure, we need to go green but I’ll bet you drive a car that uses gasoline or heat your home with Natural Gas or heating oil. We will need oil and gas forever. The population will grow and more will be needed.This is called investing like an adult. Not following unrealistic expectations of small companies like $TSLA others."
THIS IS A CAR COMPANY! If anyone can show me profits made on any other part of the business I would be happy to listen but all other areas are not profitable yet and unless they can lower the cost on the other technologies they never will be.
Elon surely has some explaining to do this is shocking
Ford and GM sell a lot more cars than Tesla but....Tesla does not have to spend the profit on retirees and pension and healthcare for people who retired for the last 100 years.
"On Saturday, ARK published an update to its Tesla TSLA, +0.29% valuation model, saying it now expects the stock to be worth $7,000 by 2024 — and that's the base case. In a bull case, Tesla shares would trade at, or above, $15,000. The bear case puts the stock at $1,500, or about 2.5 times current trading levels."
"TSLA is not about how many cars they sell. They are seen more as a technology/Computer Softwarecompany. They have Giga Factories for Batteries, Patents etc. For now they lead in the market against other car companies. Is it overvalued? Just Stop looking at car sales numbers."
S & P inclusion changes everything.

"TSLA shorts dream of money. Longs actually have it. This stock will smash through 800 especially once the Georgia elections have been priced in and the broad market rally starts. The 700s will be gone in the next week. 1000 is coming and will be here before the end of next year, maybe even before April. Then we could see another stock split, in which case I will load up even more. Been a fantastic ride so far and it only gets better with age. Can't say the same for the shorts' ride."
$800 by EOY??
added 1k Tesla
forget about tesla. buy gamestop!
"Assuming the whole screen needs to be replaced on the 158K recalled cars, at a cost of $400 per screen, the total cost to TSLA for the recall is $63 million. Big whoop! Not!"
There is a possibility that we will revisiting Worldcom Scenerio . Specifically towards Revenue Recognition as the management is anxious to ship out the vehicle by cutshorting PDI . There could be a tendency to push the accountants to keep the books open for few days more and predate invoices. Hope that doesnt occur here.

"Having a deep well of funds is important to a company so heavily into advanced R&D and constantly building factories. But, an important impetus was also to make shares available for the S&P inclusion, and the shares that may be made available by this is just a small fraction of what is needed, so demand will still be high. Also, it could have been much larger--dilution by this move is less than a percent. All in all, it appears to be a smart move on their part and not damaging to stockholders. Musk acted when opportunity knocked, and still made it acceptable to investors. That's what you want in a company leader if you're on the side of the company."

Guess the children are buying Tesla with their stimulus checks. END THE FED. GOLD AND SILVER ARE MONEY. TSLA is the poster child for this massive BUBBLE.
AH or pre market doesn't usually mean much for $TSLA. This stock has a mind of its own and picks when to remain and close green.
Short squeeze will happen here tomorrow wait and see.

"Tesla Stock dropped just before being included in S&P. I remember it was trading at 440 and went down to like 404. And then with the news of the S&P inclusion - it went up to 440 - basically recouped the dip. I figured that the S&P was already priced in but boy was I wrong. It went past 500 and then 600 and then zoomed up to 800. So, basically, who knows what will happen with this earnings announcement"
99% of the 38 stocks I look at are in red today. I noticed that Tesla did get green for a bit today so next week it will just go up and up. Of course I hope those reddit people go after the short sellers for Tesla. I would like to make 10 x more money in a short time : )

"Everyone hating on Tesla, I made good money on it since March than sold it at 880, made few more dollars on Apple and realized I don’t need the money I want to invest it long term so bought 100 shares, ever since SP500 inclusion people are starting to believe in Tesla and are actually holding their shares regardless if it falls or goes up, Tesla is an Alpha tech company expect nothing but great things! Amazon is alpha nothing but great things, and finally Apple"
"Shares of Tesla were pummeled early Wednesday morning. The stock fell as much as 7.4% early. As of 11:45 a.m. EST, however, it's down only 3.1%.The stock's big hit this morning was likely due to a tweet last night from noted investor Michael Burry. The former hedge fund manager, who is well known for predicting and profiting from the subprime mortgage crisis, said he is currently shorting Tesla stock."
I would like to make a New Years Toast to the Shorts. Thank You Thank You Thank You
Tesla is like Apple stock. You buy it and hold it you don't sell it.
Next strong support is 680. few bumps down the way at 750 and 720. Let's see how far this can go before bulls try to regain control
"Congress is very good at passing laws. They should make a new one. No elected official in DC nor family member should be allowed to invest in public companies. These people sway the stock market with their legislation, so they can rig the system to their favor."
"After I seen GameStop and amc, anything is possible with tesla"
BUY THE DIPPPPPPPP
What will be the stock price once Elon announces Tesla is official vehicle of planet Mars
TESLA WILL SURPASS 750 THIS WEEK. CONGRATS TO LONGS. STAY LONG 2021 the BEST IS YET TO COME.
"Goldman Sachs is newly bullish on Tesla Inc., upgrading the electric-car manufacturer to a buy rating from neutral and raising its price target to $780, now the highest on Wall Street."
Bye bye Shorts .. See you at 1500$ again by end of feb 
can tesla score positively in q4 if they have been reducing their prices since october? Before that they were always negative without the ev credits
"AMZN, AAPL, GOOG and FB are now old geezers in the S&P, and mostly all played out. People and funds who put their trust in the S&P welcome the breath of fresh air, TSLA, which has significant room to grow. I believe TSLA's growth potential is the main reason the S&P welcomed it with wide open arms to join its indexes."
"The old 15 minute before opening pump show...stock manipulation at its finest, you almost have to appreciate the way it is orchestrated."
"Buy $GME $AMC $BB $NOK to join our battle, and let those market makers, which sucked people’s hard earned money and became corrupted, to SUFFER more! This week's market crash is the sign of our great victory, and we will continue to fight against MM next week! See you soon!  Join us and get you hard earned money BACK FROM THEM!!! "
"You really want to see Tesla's stock go to the moon, just have them split the stock to 10:1 and alal of the people who couldn't buy in because of todays prices will be lining up to buy Tesla at below $100 a share... They would hit $3 trillion by the end of the year..."
Fill my $90 order please!
Tesla just announced they are making a phone a tablet and super laptops that will have free connectivity to Star Link anywhere on the planet.
Nice quarter. Earned more in one quarter than the previous three combined. We have three major factories under construction and revenue is out the roof. My long position feels very comfortable at this time.
Everyone basher on this board yelling out random numbers as TSLA gains value month after month vvvvv
People buying at these levels are going to get SMOKED. If Tesla was the only car company in the WORLD then MAYBE it would deserve this kind of valuation.
I'm gonna buy more $ELCR tomorrow. It's under a penny worth a shot especially in this massive EV market. Great opportunity IMO...will add some more $TSLA too by end of month!
"Meanwhile, the Giga Press eliminates many parts and creates a better product in a fraction of the time. Tesla will be cranking out EVs at 25k soon."
this stock is intact as tesla s future. Longs hold strong!!
"Obviously, the market is pricing in some great numbers in TSLA's coming earnings release. I have been expecting $1.25 for the ""reported earnings"" for the fourth quarter, which is well up from the consensus estimates around $1.00."
Good to see the TSLA stock have a nice upward trading day.
Tesla is the future!
"This is a bigger cult than I ever imagined. Most of you people could care less about saving the environment, you all just want to make a quick, unearned buck. I can't stand MUSK's vision for the future. Living in a digital world is definitely not what I want to do. I am not on fb, twitter or any of the other social media muck holes. Social media platforms are low grade digital ghetto's where the dregs of humanity congregate to alternatively commiserate or flaunt their pathetic lot in life. Full self driving where you play video games instead of enjoying the driving experience is an anathema for me. Bitcoin is a freaking ponzi scheme and Tesla is overvalued, not just as a company, but as an idea. I am neither on the side of the wall street coke boys. I neither own nor have shorted TSLA, I just can't stand the future the Electric Messiah is attempting to create. Call me a Luddite. At some point, the younger generation is going to be in a world of hurt because you all want to have someone else do the work for you. Guaranteed income? Then who will be working at the grocery store or deliver your meals? Who will fix your car? Who will build them for that matter? Our society is falling apart, pusing toward a socialistic utopia, but will that work? Sadly no. Will my ranting stop the ""progress"" Nope, but remember this. Societies downfall starts will excess. And I will continue to root against the digitization of the society. Have a nice day."
"Still low volume, so ""price discovery"" is yet to occur."
"From Seeking Alpha!Summary • Despite having less than 1% of global auto market share, Tesla's market cap is now greater than that of all non-Chinese automakers, combined. • Tesla is clearly priced for massive growth, yet half of its current products are aging and its development pipeline is sparse. • The Tesla Semi, new Roadster, and Cybertruck have all been unveiled; they are already facing significant competition from other automakers. • Even if Tesla's most ambitious assumptions were to play out as planned, it would not be enough to justify the current valuation. • Tesla is already seeing declining market share in the most mature EV markets; as this trend continues in 2021, the growth narrative will likely come under pressure.At present, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has just four electric vehicle models in active production: the Model S, the Model X, the Model 3, and the Model Y. The Model S and Model X, while extremely innovative at the time of their introduction, are now aging platforms in decline, leaving the Model 3 and Model Y to carry ever more of the load. While both have proven popular, their addressable market is finite, as evidenced by Tesla’s having had to resort repeatedly to price cuts to keep demand from ebbing throughout 2020, even in the supposedly near-limitless Chinese market.CEO Elon Musk has stated that Tesla aims to produce 20 million vehicles per year by 2030, far beyond the wildest peak annual demand projections for the Model 3 and Model Y, combined. To achieve its goal, Tesla will have to bring a host of new offerings to market over the course of the next decade. Yet the company has struggled of late to expand its product development pipeline. As I discussed in a recent article, the Tesla Semi, which has yet to enter production more than three years after it was unveiled, is one clear example of this issue."
Market red tomorrow = Tesla green
Thinking about liquidating my other holdings and just buying some Tesla shares. The FOMO is really getting to me.I can totally see another stock split in the near-future at this rate.
