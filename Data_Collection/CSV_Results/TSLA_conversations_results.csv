Recent headlines and conversations for TSLA
"Relax, just some more profit taking after the huge rebound on Monday. Will soon see the 1000 ..."
Tesla making cars for the people.        
Loaded 285 puts this morning
"after all the hype, look yourself in the mirror and say tesla is $800 and makes 80 cents a quarter earnings"
"Pre split announcement last year this was about in the 1300-1500 range, so that's about 275-300 by todays prices. I have a feeling that we may test those waters again. I am not a hater, but I can not see this valuation holding out for any longer just because Ark likes the stock."
Futures going down again. Like Game stop in reverse!
"EVEN IF tesla grows 50% every year, it still only has 1/3 of global car market by 2030"
elon will release earnings at 2am in morning so no one will be awake to see the bad results.
Tomorrow opens at 900 and 1000 a share by the end of the day. Next week we get to 1500 a share. Got no reason
"A mather of miniutes, hours or days for meltdown of Tesla Stockprice ."
Tesla ==== They started 2021 off with MORE PRICE CUTS. Model 3 sales were down 35% in the USA. Model 3 sales were down 9% in Europe.
"Here is my latest forecast:In a very short time Musk will announce the total elimination of sales people. No Delivery Specialist. There will be Product Specialists available to ""assist"" customers. Every step of the sales process will be remote handled by a Central location....EVERY STEP. No discussions face-to-face, only by phone or through emails. It will be like shopping at a 7-Eleven. Pick your poison. Stand in line. Yep. This is what's become of the ""World-wide disruptor"".IMO, Tesla can no longer afford to pay store folks like professionals. They'll become glorified clerks. After all, the last job most all of them had was selling handbags at a Mall store. I'm not kidding. Every bit of sales talent remaining in Tesla walked out the door when McNeill took a hike. I think Musk takes over from here. Besides, I can't think of a sane, knowledgable sales guy in any part of the auto sector willing to take a chance with this bunch. It's a career-ender, IMO. Then again, every sales chief left with a ton of stock options they cashed in on. McNeill didn't need the money as he already had it. But Walker? Blankenship? The others? I don't think you zealots are thinking big picture here. You're so enamored with the hype you gladly sell your souls, those that have them! Certainly none of you has real money invested in Tesla as most all of you don't have the liquidity in the first place. You'll simply lie about it."
Tesla car is great but well you don't see them dominating in the street in Europe. I see most EV cars in Europe are not tesla. In UK it's Toyota that's dominating. To justify current price they need to be absolutely dominating in entire world but I am not seeing it.
OK... so its a little bit like begging for $900 today... but lets just say we are reaching for the Moon today and see how far we can take this space ship.... thrusters are primed and ready to fire... initiate the count down10...9...8... 7...6....5...
"Tiislla to $300 , new administration is a job killing machine. have fun!"
"Next support it at $630, Oh Mama!"
wonder what those bond buyers from 6 months ago are thinking now.
BITCOIN IS SO AHEAD ONCE AGAIN WITH ITS BITCOIN PURCHASE>>>>NOW TESLA BALANCE SHEET WILLBE SELF SUSTAINING>>>SALES WILL DOUBLE THIS YEAR WITH NO PANDEMIC AND NEW MODELS COMING>>>AND THEIR STAPLE PRODUCT FULL SELF DRIVE COMES OUT THIS YEAR>>>>BUY WITH BOTH HANDS HERE 100 OFF HIGHS ON A STOCK WITH MANY 1000$ PRICE TARGETS!!!!!
P/E Ratio 1497.82x Earnings? .50 cents a share? Can you say bubble?
Benzinga: Tesla's Share Of European EV Market Reduced To 3.5%
Tomorrow will go under $600
720 was 20 percent down from 900..technically bear market..wait for 640
"Tesla makes other stock look so boring , I guess just buy Tesla , and hold , have fun with it , get rich ."
"let’s go to $10,000"
"Chapter 11 coming folks, GS will make a ton of money for advising board of directors on strategically planning Chapter 11. It's the most effective way to get rid of all the debt and convert it to equity (of course at the expense of shareholders dilution). Management will get equity in the new reorg company. The new reorg company will be Musk's new toy......no debt on the books."
"""Markets can remain irrational longer than one can stay solvent."" Most people know that Tesla is overvalued. But shorting it, especially in the short term is risky. If you are Long or Short, make sure it is less than 5% of your portfolio.Remember that only 5% of day traders make money in long run. And this crazy EV hype with small companies will end. Companies that will do with EV will likely be VW, GM, TM and others followed by $TSLA. I would touch $NIO, LI etc with a 10 foot pole. Best would be buy and hold well diversified index funds $VTI etc.."
Musk is such a scam artist. No wonder he has been pumping BTC the last few weeks.
"if you own a home, get the lube ready"
After/Pre market gains or losses don't usually stick through the next trading day. Lets hope this one signals an awesome green day tomorrow.
"Sell Tesla, Buy AMD and NVIDIA!!!!"
I don't trust a company cutting costs by not including a charger with a brand new phone purchase. So... your brand new iCar will not include a charger as well? ??? Apple iCar my #$%$
THIS 800 PRICE IS CHEAP. THAT FOESNT EVEN INCLUDE FULL SELF DRIVE CYBER TRUCK OR SEMI OR THE SOLAR ROOF. ANYONE WITH TESLA MODEL 3 WILL BUY TESLA ROOF ALSO. JUST LIKE APPLE WITH LAPTOP AND PHONE TESLA ECHO SYSTEM. THE TESLA APP STORE WILL BE DEVELOPED ALSO. THIS 800 price doesn’t have the Tesla battery packs either for your home. Tesla is building a whole new world that millennials want to be a part of and in some ways they are more powerful then Apple. The Tesla consumer is die hard The solar roof is just like the model s when it came out...expensive...and when ppl realize what a value a energy producing roof is...they will flock to it.....and when they do it will allot Tesla to lower prices Stay long 1000 would still be under valuing the expansion that is about to occur with Tesla BUY THE DIP. AS I DID!!!
I say we start a site that tracks what Elon says and rates it on potential for being a lie and then record whether or not it was.http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/23/technology/elon-musk-media/index.html
Ladies and gentleman - I give you the man who made all of this possible and who is making me a MILLIONAIRE in the process. $NIO $CCIV $BNGO $JAGX $PLTR $GEVO
the deal might be more than 420.
WOW... +30% production. Still CASH BURNING and +750% Stock Performance!! Is this a joke? 
I didn't see $695 at the end. I saw $660's - $670's on etrade
it's all over folks. Will Cathie turn out the lights on the way out?
All the sh$t talkers on the board have no idea what they are talking about. SP is not Elon’s top priority and he’s trying to do more than just create a financially successful company. In his mind Tesla has already succeeded
$780 Goldman price target - why sell or short now???
"Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch raised the price target on Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) to a 'Street High' $1,036.00 (from $486.00) while maintaining an Outperform rating."
People buying at these levels are going to get SMOKED. If Tesla was the only car company in the WORLD then MAYBE it would deserve this kind of valuation.
"Next week Saint Elon will announce 10,000 1K deposits on Model Y and the stock will magically climb to 325."
$900 today $1100 tomorrow $1250 Friday
"tesla pe 1617, ticker gold pe 13"
"Buy Buy Buy keep accumulating!!! TSLA will be $4000 - $5000 per share in 5 years!!! Tesla's EV (2 Trillion), Battery(2 Trillion), Software/FSD Full Self Driving (1 Trillion), Solar (1.5 Trillion), RoboTaxi (1 Trillion). Tesla will be a multi-Trillion Dollar Market Cap Company!!!"
"When VW sells more EV's this year than Tesla, I wonder what excuse Tesla fan boys will have for keeping this stock at a market cap that's more than the entire rest of the auto industry combined. And come Q3 when Ford and GM are finally selling real EV's that people want, I wonder what happens when Tesla has negative sales comps."
That's less than a billion dollars a year in operating profit.700 billion dollars in market capitalization? Something is strange.
"But 420 is a sure thing, right?"
Why is Tesla up 50 Billion today? IN MARKET CAP
THE RECALL IS ONLY ON X AND S. NOT MODEL Y AND 3. Which is majority of sales. GOING TO 900 soon FULL SELF DRIVE AND CYBER TRUCK. OMING THIS YEAR. STRONG GUIDANCE ON Q4 EARNINGS FOR THE 20 BILLION RAISED STAY LONG. INCLUDING 25 k CHINESE MODEL AND CHINESE DESIGN STUDIO
The cultists are going to get educated now.... the robinhooders will be closing their fractional share accounts..... the trend is in!
They are broke. They owe more than they have. Not enough orders for over $35k car. People expected $35000 minus $7500. That's the only reason there were so many pre orders. They replaced over 80% of drive units in s cars. High warranty claims. It's an over priced race car not a green car
$600!!!!!! Next week we run wild!!!!!!!
The markets were showing signs of depletion since 2007 before the final collapse in September 2009. This time the market will not give that much anticipation.
Nice beat!!! Let’s squeeze these shorts!!! Happy Trading!!!
soo today we will hit $770
"Two downgrades and one maintain as neutral in the last few days - this is just the beginning of fall from obscene rise of TSLA to unsustainable levels. After 12/21, TSLA's decline will be just as fast as it rose. 50-day MA of $434 is more realistic than $640."
"So not to be outdone (by that other company that is up 9% today), when is ""Tesla Day""?"
"There has been more and more reports on Tesla build failures. They dont have that many cars on the road as the other makers, that is starting to be scary. I was going to buy one but when I see whats coming soon on the market, I am not sure anymore. Tesla may be a leader now in the EVs market, but other makers are catching up quickly. And the other makers have the ""know how"" on how to build a aolid and safe car, which Tesla is still lacking."
"As with the changing of the seasons and the rising of the sun, one thing is always certain.....the shorts will get completely destroyed again with Tesla......watch"
Broke 2.8 million today. Scary ride this morning but even then I added 20k at $573 I just can’t help it TESLA is my rock
My plan is to buy a Tesla with the money I got from $TSLA
And did I just hear Scotland BEGGING Tesla to come build in Scotland NO red tape no obstacles we will build it and build it fast and cheap what other country goes out of their way to build a factory for a car company. Yes I like that I think I’ll buy more Tesla on Monday
"If the block robinhooders from trading GME, they should also block them from trading this, the largest Ponzi scheme in history."
read about the great British bicycle bubble. same scenario will happen in EV and ADAS market as well
"Oh my the afterhours just feels like a good afterhours ;) keeps getting better and better, $1000 incoming!"
"635 finish, ready for Monday. FDA approval of Pfizer vaccine, and continued Stimulus talks"
"this thing is deflating, buy back @ 400"
I don’t know why the capital raise would come as any surprise. Elon has been very transparent about the capital raises that will be happening
"Hello followers and happy new year. I have been on an extended holiday, and have just returned. I have analyzed thoroughly and see that TSLA is sitting in the perfect position for the ""ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTIES"" ( the option mm's and their followers/players) to effect the VERY significant , most significant in fact option unwind in the history of TSLA. You see that this friday , the JAN 15 options will expire. These were the former leap options that have been around for a couple of years or so, so they naturally have a lot of open interest , but in fact, they have more open interest than ANY series of options that TSLA has experienced EVER. So much interest , that if you choose the strike price which renders the LOWEST dollar value of ALL the combined options outstanding for JAN 15 expiry added together. ( what all the calls and puts of the whole series would be worth if TSLA closes at that strike price), they would still be worth $14.3 BILLION . That compares with the analgous figure of $380 million for the Jan 22 expiration , a small percentage of the dollar open interest of the jan 15 exp. At yesterday's close of aprox $850, the jan 15 options would be worth aprox $22.6 BILLION . Now I have seen TSLA swallow $2 BILLION of change from the LDV without trouble when it has news or huge momentum, but never has it had to swallow such a difference before. It is going to be interesting to see this expiration. Have fun my followers!"
This is what happens when a CEO gambles his company's future in Bitcoin. Musk just opened another way to short Tesla. Musk put a his chips on the table and is now getting called. So how much does Tesla lose if Bitcoin falls back to $3000?
"Heading south fellas...laws of supply & demand. Every auto maker is getting in the EV market now. It's only a matter of time before there's a glut of supply and better choices, bringing prices down."
shorts celebrating 1% drop again. Ill let them have fun for a few minutes.
I think Goldman achieved a record quarter also because of the manipulation of Tesla shares. Well done!
oooo so scary! Apple + Hyundai  we doomed!! orrrrr perhaps....Apple + Hyundai < Tesla + VWi think A + H will spur a friendly supermerger of like companies on the right side of the equation above!
"Tesla is headed to the mid to high $500's. WHY !!? Because we counted out GM, F, VW, Toyota and Honda a bit quick i think!. Keep in mind that Legacy car companies did not start to compete with Tesla until this year 2021, before they were still hoping Tesla might fail but have all but given up on that and now and are 100% behind EVs tech. So the competition has really only started this year. When values were calculated for Tesla 2022-30 we all just assumed they would just double their sales for ever! .. or at least until 2030, but that actually seems ""impossible"" now that the sleeping giants of the car industry have awakened. PS. GM, F, VW, and others are outselling Teslas in China, Germany, Norway and the EU. with this in mind we need to be more modest about 2022 - 30 sales and this re calculation will have a pull back in Teslas ""perceived value"" I personally think the Top was. $800-$850 and we will slowly travel back to the high $500 over 2021 as sales figures come in for the EV/ice companies. Assuming that someone who has bought 4 GMs (or F,VW etc...) in a row is going to buy a Tesla are just plain wrong. Legacy car companies currently have 98% of the car market, assuming that somehow that will be gifted to Tesla is also wrong"
"Tesla stock at $700 is fundamentally undervalued relative to the company’s long-term earnings growth potential in the massive transportation, solar energy generation and renewable energy storage end-markets.The technicals underlying TSLA stock imply that shares are close to a near-term bottom, and will soon reverse course back into a healthy long-term uptrend."
I'm sure the Tesla is definitely $ 1200
"Elon Musk, the world's richest man, is about to get a whole lot richer. https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/11/investing/elon-musk-pay-wealth-tesla-stock-options/index.html"
ALL I know is ever since the NEW Prez took office it's been DOWN .....
300 back today
"Elon musk becomes criminal. He manipulates the markets with his Bitcoin Twitter announcements. He knows, that he will find some idiots buying after his tweet. He tested with dodgecoins. He tries to cover the losses in core business , what never will be so profitable to justify the absurde valuation.Pe 1700 ...this is fraud and fed or sec will stop him to avoid big losses by small investors.China sales very weak and regulatory problems and massive competition, quality issues additional.This is 100 usd Stock and it will Go there."
It seems tesla results are non event because trading volume is low and stock price is not not moving much even results are not favorable. It means stock price will be elevated in the coming sessions with high risk mode. i am waiting for better opportunity.
added 50 more shares at $795 Booya! We are going to end the week at $880
Shorts winning today
"Now filming the $300 test take 45. Stock has done nothing for 9 months. Half the investment world thinks it is worth infinitesimally less, and half thinks it is worth infinitely more. Amazing - and insane to watch."
Tesla's stock is too overvalued....It might Just be a bubble waiting to burst....
So a fully refundable $100 deposit on a $50k product two years out - is not an order.
"Don't worry guys anything is possible, just look at $TSLA 1600 p/e, send an email to gamestop CEO and tell him to tweet these two words >> ELECTRIC CAR and boom this will rocket to the MOON 2000u$ per share easy"
This will go down in history as the ARK crash
"More to this puzzle! Safer, Healthier and Beautiful blue & green marble for the children! Read about CETY and similar types of companies that will be capturing wasted energy and reconverting it to power! Bamm!! Skyscrapers, Landfills, Municipality buildings etc. This will take the load off the power grid for, to allow Vehicles to run electric. Reducing global oil dependance. More to this puzzle! Oil will still have its place for a long time! None the less, Oil was a vehicle to get us to where we are today. Now we are entering a new Phase of humanity. Investors make the changes by supporting companies to make the world a Safer, Healthier and Beautiful blue & green marble for the children! Children’s children!! Its our Job to wake up! Realize technology is allowing us to make these wonderful changes. Musk is trying hard to make these changes and show the lighted path to get us there. He's so concerned about Earth, Elon feels the need to go to Mars to help save humanity from its self or a cataclizmic event! Brilliant! I don't support COVID however my take away is Look at how COVID-19 suppressed carbon emissions! Busses, Ships, Planes, Tractor Trailers, Trucks, Cars etc. Supporting Doc, (https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11356594/himalayas-visible-india-coronavirus-pollution/ ) There is Winter again (which I predicted late last April) in the northern hemisphere! Texas!? Ask any avid Snow Machiner, Snowboarder or Skier How their experiences making Powder turns has been over past 7 yrs!! VS this winter!! Alaska is colder this winter. Hopefully This will lower the ocean temperatures so the salmon can continue their amazing journey to their spawning grounds. These are just a few benefits of lowering carbon emissions. Farming I am predicting will see a significant growing season this yr. Yes there will be some flooding in areas however with lower carbon levels in the air the micro #Climate change will assist the farmers to uphold a better farming season. I incourage investors to do their part and find companies that are working hard to implement great changes for the upcoming leap for humanity! I am not a financial advisor. Better our Planet!"
$7500 EV Credit for $GM and $TSLA? Are we near to get these new $7500 Tax Credit for EV?
"WHAT'S NOT REASONABLE...... $TSLA has passed $300B market cap in pre-market, accounting for 27.5% of the total Auto industry (but only ~0.4% of sales and 0% of profit)."
50% year on year growth is not enough. This business rarely can earn profits.
With a bre exit deal and a stimulus deal. The Xmas rally is just beginning
This stock is now only the second most shorted after Amazon. The smart money is always right!
Tesla still had no profit for selling EVs; only a little profit if counting regulation credit sale. But the market capital is over $800 billions. This is crazy. Many car manufacturers can produce EVs in the coming months. This stock price is assuming that only Tesla can make EVs and rule out the competition
So if it’s at 850 premarket (& closed $816 thurs night) what do you estimate you can buy it for Friday opening bell?
Beautiful beautiful 6-mth chart TSLA has right now. Compare with CSCO during the internet bubble. Green days are just noise. Bubble is definitely bursting. It is a certainty. $200 within a few months.
"Headline News: ""Trump boards plane, appears to have toilet paper stuck to shoe""In other news, ""Tesla Extends Slide as Musk Sounds Off on Twitter"". It seems that Musk decided to mock the SEC, calling it the ""Shortseller Enrichment Commission"".Clearly, it's an excellent idea to mock and ridicule the agency who can kcuf you up big time without even trying hard."
How much money do y'all reckon all the masochist Tesla shorties are going to collectively lose in 2021? $40 Billion? $50 Billion?
SUN POWER ======= closing a plant This is terrible news. To completely shut down a plant is unusual. Things are worse than I thought. I thought it was just a layoff.
Why Did Elon Musk invest 1.5B of the companies money and not his own personal wealth?

Cathy woods is down big
"Cathie wood unloading tesla shares go check out, first you make a price target then start buying, next you increase the price target, and then while retail investors buy you start unloading your shares for a profit. don't forget Jordan Belfort was a visionary like cathie woods in 1999."
GOING TO 1000
Shorts stay strong! We’re counting on you!
can someone please tell me what's happening in the last 5 minutes today. is it that the s&p 500 and all the tracking funds will buy in the last five minutes?
Elon should start a CLOUD SERVICE and host Parlor. Elon would have the backing of 74 plus Million people
I will buy when it hits 200. Sounds reasonable to 200 bil market cap
"ELON MUSK's body language is # BURRYSOUFFLE. So, I believe M. BURRY will get red shorts from TSLA definitely. I believe Musk will wait until end of December to make sure he hits the upper number >500,000 units first. It is only three more weeks togo, which I think MUSK will motivate everybody that moves, pay attention about DELIVERING ALL THE CARS TILL THE END OF THE MONTH. I believe that ELON MUSK will be able to surprise everybody again."
Bad news in China for Tesla
Tomorrow $1billion profit for Tesla.
I just canceled a sell order. No way at this stage of things.
1 year low= $37. Do we have any significant change in circumstances for the business? No. Just hype and casino with Bitcoin. Amazing.
"I'm just so eager to know when the next split is and what the ratio might be! 5:1, 8:1, 10:1?? What do you think?"
It just occurred to me that Tesla stock is overpriced for the following reason. It is a rich people car and most people are not rich. Most people buy old used cars and there aren't many used Tesla cars. The cost and resale value of Tesla will probably be high and the cost of insurance is the highest among cars of similar cost. I am sure the repairs will kill you too. The environment concern incentive to buy is limited to rich democrats.
"TESLA surprises that could push us higher 1) 520,000 vehicles. 2) Insane year end financials. 3) Model S n X refresh. 4) Model 2 prototype 5) FSD as a monthly service 6) wider release of Beta FSD. 7) Berlin starts production early 8) Austin rolls out the first Semi’s 9) Cyber truck gets started 10) Roadster finally shows up 11) 2nd and 3rd quarter results continue to impress with margins right at 30% 12) Tesla announced site for their next Factory"
BUY THE DIP HUGE YEAR AHEAD BOYS ANF GIRLS>>
Sell now!! They will rapidly lose market share to competitors as time goes on.
"One can look at all the fundamentals and technical analysis of a stock. With TESLA, all one needs to see is this, Performance For the Year 2020 was +720.05%. Enough said, !"
2 days in a row up but with low volume. Avg volume in the last 10 days is half of normal volume.Not many buyers is probably the answer.
What a good week !
500$ stock
"If I'm not mistaken, I do recall the shorts saying, ""TSLA will never see above $800 again."" Very wrong, you were, shorts! The demand for TSLA shares outweigh the supply, and every week ordinary people put a ton of money into TSLA automatically through S&P funds."
"If it hits 900 again, then watch out."
so are innocent individuals picking up the large amounts of stock that smart money sold at open today? Large volume first part of the day was impressive and hopefully will continue daily until BK filing when the bottom will finally fall out altogether.
CLOSING over $710 today.
it's 2016 - and you place your order for your $35k Model 3 - and 3 years later... people in China can order their $55k Model 3 and receive it before you.
"Elon said that he is looking for friendly merger . This indicates that he wanted to eject and focus on other ventures. Tesla has been his longest stint. We could hear his exit within a year or so. This is my guess. He is not looking to acquire any battery company. He is looking to merge with another car maker like Audi or BMW or VW. Another angle to look at it is that TSLA is a car company and looking to merge with another car company. This is contrary to the thinking that this is a technology company etc.,"
The day people get through their heads that Tesla DOES NOT just make cars and Apple DOES NOT just make I phones is the time these stocks fly EVERY quarter !
"Bitcoin $47,000 thanks to $TSLA !!note ACRX making another 52 wk high; ACRX Volume is off the charts!!"
"Last minute 695 closing price was obviously manipulation for options expiry reasons - clients of big money managers made a ton of money. Even if there was any illegality, it got masked by index buying so SEC could never prove anything. Now that S&P inclusion is done, what happens next week?"
"- EV tipping point comes with ICE cost parity. Even if not an environmentalist, EV’s are a better driving experience: more fun, more performance, less hassle (no gas stations), less maintenance, longer life. Lower total lower cost of ownership. Teslas are the safest cars on the road."
bubble about to burst and Tesla the poster child.
Elon Musk is greatest innovator in our time
"""Too ####### much""Market is rejecting Tesla and communicating, your Market Cap is ""Too ####### much"". The quote is from ""Used Cars"" a 1980 film with Kurt Russell. I can't think of three words that apply better to this preposterous valuation."
How did you stock is really weak? it didnt go up when the whole stock market is up from low. This stock will drop another 5 percent tomorrow. Tesla company is good but it run too much due to spx addition. It will move back to 400+ support soon since there is no catalysts anymore
...and Short Interest keeps going higher! This is a tinder box. Who will flinch first???
Analyst predicting EPS of $1.04 failed to account for the higher expenditure that TSLA puts into getting it Germany and Texas Gigafactories up.
"Have never sold a single share and still don't intend to sell a single share until at lesst 2030. Since buying Tesla stock a few years ago, holding through the volatility has worked well for me."
"staying for long term, only add more when it's red... buy and wait NOT wait to buy!! GLTYA."
Does anybody think Tesla will buy Ford. That will give Tesla immediate scale and accretive earnings
"I'm systematically making my way through the Piper Sandler 100-pg report. It is full of inaccuracies and wildly optimistic guesses. When I bring some of these to light, the Tesla bulls claim I'm ""cherry-picking"". So I can't address it generally, but I can't pull out relevant mistatements bc those are cherry picked.Btw, Alex Potter is a ""transportation technology"" analyst. Why is he making projections about energy, insurance, etc.?"
I just understood it. Tesla isn't a car company. Its a software SaaS and energy company. The real TAM is over 20t. If they get even 10% then it's 2t valuation
Let’s be clear. I don’t have endless time. Get moving up or let me out to move to other opportunities. 890 to 780 now.
good morning oh look tesla added another major public company in market cap today. oh and wait once again added more in market cap than they did in revenue for a year.... but that makes total sense. this ends only one way and it's not pretty

Us bulls taking back control this week 
"Tesla has better manufacturing. The giga press eliminates many parts and robots, and produces a better product. They also have an unassailable lead in driving data and, apparently, better software. They are already entirely EV so they don't have the expense of converting over to it from ICE. To make EVs mainstream and capture market share, you have to make it affordable. Tesla's competitors are either more expensive, or unsafe."
Strong support in the $400 range - don't panic!

Ah Shorts have you read all the news past 48hrs? TESLA IS GOING UP WAY UP..
Tesla is cool but my investor allegiance is to Apple the most profitable company ever in the history of the world
Where does tesla open tomorrow?
These Shorties were saying Tesla lost Market Share in China. Where do they get their false information from?

"Even the best growing companies miss on earnings at times, i.e. Amazon, Paypal, etc. etc. etc. No big deal. Strong buy TSLA on weakness because the weakness won't last."

"I don't buy a lot of options. But I had a 530 strike deep ITM option (only 1 contract for 8700$ last Friday) expiring December 18 2020. Profit is fast when de delta is almost 1. Of course, we can lose even faster. But today was a good day for everyone I think."
"my take on Elon's ""email for cost savings"" leak:I have a feeling they're going to deliver a lot of cars (relative to themselves only) in Q3... the way the comments around the email sound, it makes it sound like they are going for profitability (evidently he suggested this)... with Elon, there's always a twist... I think the twist is, they are not going for profitability or anything *greater* than they've achieved in the past... but instead going to try to maintain the same level of cash burn while also having dropped prices and discounted to achieve the delivery numbers they might get for Q3.the headlines around this will probably end up being: ""Tesla striving for Q3 Profitability!""when the reality is... Tesla is trying as always to meet delivery numbers at all costs and this time they've got themselves backed into a corner."

On a curvy road AP drops the speed by a few MPH below the speed limit. Not quite there yet, but it'll be cool when the car can recognize green and red lights."

"Analysts are obliged to give high price targets (as they are often paid by the same parent companies that had to buy into Tesla due to S&P inclusion and don't want to loose money on their investment).Robinhooders just follow the trend for as long as it lasts.. so stock is supported.. for now.Those looking at the fundamentals, know this won't last. ""Tesla isn't a car company, it's tech.."" blabla,.. look at the numbers. It's a car company and it's priced for hypergrowth.That's where the bubble splashes.. growth is under serious pressure. Yes, they will grow.. but not fast enough by any means to support the current valuation.See for example here:https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/renault-zoe-eclipses-tesla-model-3-europes-best-selling-evThey dropped in EU (largest EV market at current) from 33% to 13%!!""The VW Group’s success meant it passed Tesla to become Europe’s biggest EV manufacturer, with the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance also moving up to second. While Tesla accounted for 31% of all EV sales in 2019, its 13.3% market share in 2020 was only the third highest.""In the near future, people will wonder why so many were so blind.But to the believers, enjoy it for as long as it still lasts."

Dado Ruvic/ReutersTesla disclosed in a SEC filing on Feb 8 that it purchased $1.5 billion of bitcoin.If its holding has remained the same size, it will reportedly have made a $930 million profit.That's almost 30% more than the company made from car sales in 2020, The Times of London reported.Visit the Business section of Insider for more stories.Tesla's $1.5 billion bitcoin investment didn't just make headlines, it has also made the company more profit than its car sales last year, according to a Times of London report.On Friday, the cryptocurrency smashed through the $55,000 level, bringing its market cap above $1 trillion. This means if Tesla owns the same amount of Bitcoin as it did on January 31, it made a paper profit of about $930 million since January. That's almost 30% more than its $721 million revenue from electric vehicles, per the report."
The timing of the power steering recall notice on a Thursday night ahead of a three day market closure is certainly no coincidence.

"guys serious questionI have lost everything, and I'm not sure how to continue. This summer I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into ornamental gourd futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions, I decided I'd try to do something similar with another vegetable. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's gourd yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Mexico and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the gourd bubble burst on November 12th. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for thanksgiving, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of December 2nd, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive gourd shipment from Argentina, scheduled for early March, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the gourds in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound. I am ruined."
Any bank hired to give solid financial advice would look at the books and tell Tesla that Chapter 11 is the only answer.
ah good luck shorties. you will need it.

To value it sensibly at $ 800 billion, it would have to be able to generate profits of around $50bn a year in fairly short order. That is simply not possible. The car market is intensely competitive. Tesla is now being outsold by three other companies in Europe. I suspect the big fall will come after 27th January 2021. The cult like followers are anticipating incredible results. When they are merely in line with expectations perhaps a sense of reality will set in. Moods change very quickly in markets."
This thing is going back to 900 middle of Feb.
"Never short a stock in a sector you have little understanding. Any short is inherently much more dangerous than a long, thus need to research more."
"Kroger, and TSLA are having a sale. Buy 4, get one free."
A nice goal is
Y'all just officially made Musk the richest man in the  this stock is amazing lol I sadly have never invested but enjoy following it
c'mon 2000 PE please !!
"The Stock split has helped Tesla bring the price down to a level where younger investors can jump in, Myself included. Strong companies with smart leaders understand this, to those who don't, your loss."
"Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained his Neutral rating on the automaker and increased the 12-month price target to $950 from $715. The analyst established a bull case target of $1,250 upping it from the previous $1,000 target."
When are the Tsla bashers and shorts going to be satisfied? When it gets to $1T (very soon)? Maybe $2T to overtake aapl? Nah probably never. They’ll be complaining that the stock price “ain’t worth it” all the way to #1.
"Competition is good. This will make Tesla work harder to improve range, speed and features. Still waiting for iPhone killer."
drop continues
"Hi Elon, you spend to much time playing with Tesla money on ""coins"". With all competitors around the corner, It is time for you to go back to work focusing more on on-going Tesla progress."
Civil war start today?
I’ll bet money this closes above 360. Agree pricing looks fishy
52-Week Change -13.28%
"Run is done. TSLA is now tied to BTC. Correlation done, good luck with future valuation hopes."
"If $TSLA make the same annual net profit as BMW, and that profit was reflected in it's current forward P/E, TSLA would have an $8T marketcap and trade over $44,000 per share. Does that seem right?"
$tsla and $nio matched each other’s movement all throughout the day and AH
"in 2021 21 new ev cars will be launch by every car company in the world,look like big big comptetion coming to tesla car in 2021 ,tesla probably will have to cut car price tocompete in ev cars in 2021. elon mask said tesla stock is too too high at $700 when thebig guy owner say his stock is too too high at $700 then youbetter be worry beveryvery afraid.better get outot now ,you cannt get abigger warningthen thebig guy from tesla.look liketesa will be just be another car company in the world like a ford or gm or toyota .because every car car company will havethier own ev car in 2021,see teslastock crashback down to earth below $150.stock analyist want to justify tesla loftylofty froty stock prie by calling it atech stock ,elon nevereverrefer tesla is atech company , he alway refer his company as a car car copany ,not a tech company ."
Morgan Stanley:Mar 2 2021FEB US Sales: Mustang Mach-E Steals Major Tesla EV Share
Does this stock go down? Seems like an unstoppable force I’m bout to buy some calls
What a joke
"I hope many of you bought the $600 dip......This is a bargain. Understand the motive behind the oil price drop. They are trying to compete with the eventual adoption of EVs. They realize the EVs threat is going to come faster than even they expected. Proof: Tesla continues expansion into China and German factory locations. But here's the biggest IMO: in April 2020, $TSLA will hold their Battery Day event and I expect Tesla to announce their accomplishments over the past year since they acquired several technologies to help improve battery range dramatically. We could see a 30% improvement in range in Tesla vehicles coming out after April and on top of that, we will see a reduction for price to drop below $100 per kilowatt hour. This will be huge. I believe TSLA pps will go from today's low of $600 drive the price up past $1000. The oil sellers realized they don't have much time left as profits will drop significantly for them within 3-5 years as the world will have a massive EV transition. 5 years is what I give all other auto manufacturers to finally have EV models that will also be successfully selling to compete with TSLA to a degree, but this will be a bigger blow to the oil industry....not kill it.....but significant pain to their profits. In the past couple of weeks, you had one of the biggest auto makers announce they are fully committed to EVs more than ever....GM. Oil saw this too and after they had their emergency meetings to deal with a crisis that will start for their industry sooner than they expected, they foolishly decided cutting oil prices will help scramble for as much profits as possible for the few years left for them to take advantage of their monopoly over the auto industry. Buy $TSLA with a target of $1500+ and $NIO to $16+. You will regret missing out today's low of $600 TSLA and $3.00 on NIO. Keep buying and holding."
i can stop laughing. hahahaah I didnt sell 1 share
"Congrats bulls, we made more than greenlight capitals full 2017 return of 1.6% today!"
I keep this stock for long time invest. I will buy more when it goes down.
Update:All production stopped today again.https://twitter.com/skabooshka/status/1038855315331006465
Long and accumulate!!! Even when it goes up to $1000 per share. Not selling for a least 10 years and will only sell 10 %. Not paying capital gains tax in the short run!!!
"Going to sell my shares of Tesla, and pay off the mortgage, and equity loan, on my double-wide. Thanks Elon, you are my hero."
Tesla has been held down the last two weeks by foul play but as you see it just can't be contained.
Fed left interest rates unchanged.
So who here can defend why this company is worth 4 TIMES what Toyota Motors is? TM is the #1 car maker in the world.
"Answer me this. If Musk really have investors lined up to buy all the remaining shares of the stockholders that can't/won't keep their shares after going private at 420, why aren't they already loading up on the open market for a huge discount? Why would they wait and pay a huge premium at 420? Why didn't they jump in on Friday?This isn't a hostile take-over where Tesla is in a position to set the price. No, Musk is explicitly putting Tesla in the showroom and is desperately eager to go private. He manoeuvred himself in a position where he now doesn't even have a choice any more.Do the longs really believe Musk is pulling the strings at this point and is in a position to set the buy-out price?Do the longs really believe 420 is still a target to go private?"
Happy 900 fellow holders!!! Won’t be long before 1000!  thank you Tesla!
Apple is no close to Tesla in terms of cars. The biggest advantage that Tesla has is the date it collects from hundreds of thousands of cars running on the road right now.
EV stock bubble losing gas every day.
Tesla is up 100% on Bitcoin it’s stock is up 1300% since I bought it. 22 BILLION IN CASH. Shanghai factory added TWO more phases tripling in size. Berlin AND Austin promise to be THE LATGEST FACTORY ‘s IN THE WORLD Tesla has paid for my X my Y paid off my mortgage and secured my retirement. How on earth can anyone not invest in Tesla AT ANY PRICE. Bought more yesterday I wish I had more cash this is a no brainer thumbs up if you’ve read this till the end thumbs up if you agree
"I have made 30% with QS in two days lol. I have to say that I agree with the comment that QS is the place to be right now. I am not loyal to any stock, just money. So it's easy for me to follow the money and split or return. EV is the best sector though by far."
"If Dems win Georgia, you could see $600/week unemployment again. That would take Tesla to $2K, just like in July."
"$TSLA we here at BTC thank you!! $NIO next to use BTC!! also, look @ ACRX, a new 52 Week High pre market"
This is one huge bubble
"book profit now, now is the time to sell, but most will not listen to this sage advice"
"TSLA shorts dream of money. Longs actually have it. This stock will smash through 800 especially once the Georgia elections have been priced in and the broad market rally starts. The 700s will be gone in the next week. 1000 is coming and will be here before the end of next year, maybe even before April. Then we could see another stock split, in which case I will load up even more. Been a fantastic ride so far and it only gets better with age. Can't say the same for the shorts' ride."
Just look at it this way: JPM just increased Tesla's price estimate by 12.5%650 + 12.5% = $731.25
TSLA has a 5000 dollar pre split hype valuation for doing exactly what Musk wanted. Inspiring the entire vehicle industry to fast forward EV production and do it better than TSLA. LOL
Where are the buyers? Wasn't this meant to go to the moon?
"Like e-cigarrettes, airlines may ban Samsung Galaxy. Soon, condos and co-ops may ban recharging EVs inside garages."
Is £880 the peak for tesla stock? What do you guys think
SIRC signed agreement with IDEX and Soletrac : 500 million US grant participant. Can y’all confirm SIRC may be working with Tesla charging or solar panels too ?? Google it !!
some big Dutch fund bought a lot of Tesla shares at the current prices
Anyone thinking TSLA will be $1000 before year end? Ready for another split within 12 months.
Surprised TSLA isn't up more on the Bitcoin news. The $1.5 billion crypto investment by Musk puts a big dent in the shorts' thesis. Bitcoin is rocket fuel for any stock right now and TSLA's propellants now can get it to Mars instead of the Moon because of the Bitcoin addition. I would not want to be betting against this name right now.
Cathie Wood sounds like a newbie who is just short of saying 'Tesla can never go down. Musk is God'
Where is the disclosure showing how many Tesla cars SpaceX and The Boring Company purchased from Tesla?
"Snoopy was right, I should have listen to him and bought $tsla and $GM"
1.50% lock on 10 yr will look pretty sweet in 2031 in a pair trade short to TSLA.
"What is happening? Any news come out? Such hike in AH, seems like the fund managers are buying in after hours so as to not pay high prices during the day."
As said no one want to sell right now ... the institutions have to pay much more to get retail owners shares ...
"Bitcoin breaks $50,000 for the first time.It should read ""US dollar dropped below 0.00002 bitcoin"" :)"
@Kevin Bodie is hiding in @Steves 4skln. they're schnoodIe bros
its simple.. hold and buy in every dip and you will be rich in the next 3-5 years
This was my post Thursday night The Markets are crashing Friday! Buckle up!
"So does anyone know the real valuation of TSLA? Or I guess no one cares just keep holding the stock as it goes up each day....never have seen anything like it ...no logic whatsoever....I guess $1,000 per share makes sense....haha lol"
there you have it! Was an Amazing 2020!! Cheers to next year!!!
This might be part of the reason TSLA is down today. The opposite trade to the Gamma Squeeze that was done over the past few months that led to the huge jumps in share price.https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/why-tesla-just-plunged
"the economies of ancient civilizations collapsed at the time of the disease.. It is the virus that leads to a slowdown in the economy, because economies have collapsed even in ancient times when they happened, even when no one said to close schools or cafes"
To the Moon! Tesla paying for my daughters wedding
Why is it going down???
"Whew!  Sure am glad I sold mine recently before the drop. Sold my Amazon, Walmart and Apple. My first portfolio of mainly Value micro and small caps is on fire. Tesla, Amazon, Walmart and Apple are moving at snail pace. Wasn't good enough for me."
"Tesla is Schrödinger's cat - both dead and alive. According to the Copenhagen interpretation, a quantum system remains in superposition until it interacts with, or it’s observed by the external world.It is going to take one ""event"" for the believers to suddenly discover that their beloved Tesla aka Musk is dead. By dynamite or hydrocyanic acid, what's the difference?"
Added 5 shares like a BOSS!
Close below 700
Recalls happen. This is nothing like the scale of typical auto industry recalls. Here could be a tremendous buying opportunity!
The same guys that tell you P/E or P/S are irrelevant tell you that revenue and sales will double next year. You didn't take into account the financials to justify current MC so why are you using the same metrics to justify the future MC?
"Headline could be ""Model Y ahead of schedule""?"
Curious on thoughts on what would happen if the Board announces Musk is out as CEO? Would the stock rise or fall the next day? I could see the longs being disappointed that their visionary leader is out but shorts might be disappointed that the guy who continues to bring this company down is no longer able to do so.
"After every major event there is always a pull back. Good earnings, pullback. Stock spilt, pull back. Battery day, pullback. Now SnP inclusion, ???."
"Why weren't the ""upgrades"" (wink, wink) performed when Fremont was shut down for 6 weeks? Tesla had permission to work on maintenance and improvements, just not production. Who is running the show over there? Same guy handling the national strategy on covid-19?"
A one product car company now valued more than all auto competitors combined. Absolutely absurd. Will be the short of a lifetime!
Why not just buy panasonic they make Tesla batteries
The shorts here never learn.
"For all you ""value investors"", the pe will get at least a 50% haircut on Monday. The we can run it up again. New pps - $2000."
((( Shanghai gigafactory set to beat Fremont production capacity/ numbers in the near future )))
"(1500 shares) $269.34 - $323.00 AH that’s $80,490... believe me I thought about this for a long time.. But I took the $80,490 it’s just to much money in this market to risk..Longs it was rough, it was painful, but if it goes up tomorrow I wish ALL of you $400+...Cause we have earned it.. nice end to rough day"
"old bag speaker loaded up with tsla CALLs, she will also write checks for green economy spending, load up yourslves are rake in the easy cash!"
Way undervalued. People don't get what addressable market is and that tesla isn't a car company. Tesla isn't bound by the auto industry. Its bound by the entire planets economy. 200T this year. 1% of that is easily captured by tesla and hence its easily worth 2000 per share right now. The price is totally wrong...the analysts are keeping the price down
Can you believe Bill Gates shorted $tsla and he calls himself the environmentalist...come on man. Why didn't he invest and help Elon when he was down and out! Instead of shorting tesla stockBill Gates is full of Bull pie up his %^%$. &*&^^ U Bill!
Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch has raised his target price on Tesla to $1036.00.
You guys see Yahoo Finance has a BUY for Tesla 770!
Cathie Wood has secretly sold
Why does TSLA keep going up without more positive news? It does not show any sign down as after split.
I believe in Elon Musk and his work. The dude has an extraordinary way of innovating and delivering results.
CATHIE WOOD said buy for $900.00 and enjoy LOL
"If I was Sanofi, The pharmaceutical company that makes the drug, I would tweet that “Claiming funding is secured, is not a known side effect” of Ambien."
"The extent of bear research: duh, it's a car company."
Elon Musk dumped his shares from Tesla and invested in ExxonMobil. .That was a clue.
Monday: Up or down?
"Some smart but foolish investors can't get past that TSLA trades at 175x 2021 EPS. Intellectually, they know a stock is the present value of future cash flow. They know they compare TSLA's P/E to forward growth. They refuse to believe a car company can trade at 175x EPS. Their objection: soon every auto brand - Porsche, Mustang, and Corvette will have an EV and TSLA's EV share will drop. They miss that TSLA has a 10 yr head start and TAM keeps expanding as TSLA enters new segments and markets. They miss that TSLA is much more than an EV company. And so, TSLA remains unloved and incredibly cheap!"
"One of the very early "" real "" green tech firms that made me a nice profit, I'm so grateful for that ... ... !!! !!!"
"I hate to see people comparing Telsa to Amazon. Why? For Telsa to double sales or revenue, it has to spend years to build factories. For Amazon, it just have to buy more from the suppliers. Years vs milliseconds."

"Dudes, yall must agree this play is way undervalued...right?"
TEZOMBIES
Will a short squeeze happen?  I'm long Tesla. Cathie Wood has been topping up her position
the first 20% drop will evaporate a lot of money. then it'll get interesting
Pelosi buys calls. Government to buy hundreds of thousands of EV's. Insider trading much?
674 now..recorded
"5-10 years ago, when we look back day like today, the growth of Tesla/TSLA will be so great, we won't even notice a blip. HODLing NO HESITATION."

700 I buy
I would expect some announcement very soon. Too much pressure. Board certainly knows and has to say something. To have the information and withhold could be considered collusion.
"If anyone can help me locate @NinjaSuksPinga, I will gladly livestream our encounter. Just wanna meet the genius in person and show him my....portfolio. $TSLA, $NIO, $XPEV, $LI"
Thursday and Friday.
Do u guys think there's more downside or is it a good time.to get in now?
Once it hits 52-week high @654 it would have to go higher.
"A look into the future: in Norway, 54% of all new cars sold are EV in 2020. Audi sold 9000 e-trons, VW sold 7750 iD3 (although only entered the market in September), and Tesla sold .... 7000 T3. Tesla's market share dropped to 5.5% of all EVs. Sell Tesla, it will become a niche techy-car company over time with a market cap similar to BMW3 and Mercedes."
"so with 263,273,000 shares at $700.00 that is value of 184,291,100,000 with 500,000 cars delivered that is a value of 368,582.20 per car. This seems a little off to me since the most popular car they sell is only about 40,000? This is a screaming buy"
"Tesla is shutting down a Model 3 production line at the Fremont, California, factory for two weeks amid an industrywide microchip shortage"
Hope it goes up tomorrow
When will we get Bitcoins for our dividends?
I know Bitcoin is worth a ton right now but will it last ? Did TSLA make the right move at this point ??? I'm skeptical !
"I feel bad for whoever got shaken at $351 and sold. If that was you, I wouldn't be trading at all."
"Driving my “S” on Auto Pilot while reading the news of $TSLA, especially from bashers like NBC is priceless. 3rd quarter will beat 100k in car sales ... that will get us to over $400 in no time."
"Anyone quoting 1000 p/e as a reason to sell or short the stock is ill informed in my opinion. That is using one of the worst 4 quarters to to the really big down quarter during the pandemic. You have to take the most recent quarter and extrapolate that forward which would give you a p/e closer to 150. Yes, I know some of you will say this is still expensive, but not for their growth rate. Especially since they are spending soooo much on investment. If you use operating cashflow as a more real guide of their true earnings power, you get a current pe of 28 and a forward of 14! This stock is cheap!!!!! Buy with both hands."
they better issue more shares now while price is still relatively high. there are no other options for cash. they have to be bleeding. Jan and Feb sales didnt even pay the light bill
This TSLA can't go any higher until it revisits $280 first.... I won't buy a share til then...
"At this rate, it will take less than two weeks for Tesla to hit bottom."
This company has made more money from selling its own stock than selling cars.
"Which stock within the S&P has a volatility of +/-10% in the same day? Some now are engaging in dollar cost averaging as probably entered above 800, given the apparent ""low price"", but it will not be sustainable until Elon puts the souffle back in the oven or in the microwave."
can you guys be nice nice to grandma cathy please. geez. first off she was smart and did shed her position of tesla. she said something like she doesnt hold more than 10% of a position in her portfolio. so she did take profits. she didnt hold all her shares but i still think this might be too high. but tesla goes where it wants to go
"ElonCoin? Musk Says He Could Launch His Own Crypto But 'Only If Necessary' gee, it must be nice to be an investor in tsla, which isnt a car company, but a pumpndummp crypto company"
"If this isn’t a stock market crash , I don’t know what else is happening"
Here we go again.
Hi..anyone want to buy my business for $1 million dollars...it made $600 profit last year...that's Tesla Folks!!!!
"VW posted over 12 billion profit and this turd will be lucky for 3 billion. I love how people say TSLA is not a car company yet the only revenue stream is cars/tax credits and the stock rises and falls significantly on announcements related to its car business. The typical response is TSLA is a company of 20+ startups, to which i counter 90% of startups fail and the ones that I’ve heard about are just jokes that people with too much money (Musk) created out of boredom (e.g. the boring company and it’s flamethrower)."
Disaster
There is only one Tesla and will only be one for the next 100 years. Smart poeple know what I am talking about. Stay long.

NEXT WEEK $1000 to 1200 easy
"I will never ever hate on $TSLA, $XPEV or $Li again, they are at least real companies with real products and customers and not 3 D models and a down the hill dummy truck like $NKLA or an indirect rumor not even the real stock like $CCIV – wish all especially my fellow $NIO longs invested there the very best."
"I am long on TSLA, but it’s very obvious Wall Street does not like the Bitcoin transaction, and I do have my reservation on that. I think Elon Musk should not have bought Bitcoin, it derails TSLA from its core mission."
Have a strong feeling this stock going run to 1000 dollar in between this week on next
I’m going to give you some sound investing advise that has done me very well in the 50 yrs in the market. Buy 10% off the lows and sell 10% off the highs.
"why is he trading bitcoin, not focusing on the fierce competition in EV and battery technology"
Glad I bought at 265.00 when everyone was scared to.
My Reddit activists  PLEASE HELP RMO being attacked by shorts. Let’s CRUSH EM.  CNBC SAYS  on RMO which is being hailed as an $AMZN EV Delivery Van battery supplier. $BWA Large Investor also CLII is also in the play / same industry as $TSLA and $NIOPS: Up 7% So far THANK YOU.
"Amazon appeared expensive at $880.80 now at $3,294 the $880 was cheap. Likely Tesla's $800 in my view remains a low price compared to the reoccurrence the share hit a new all-time high which could potentially equal or exceed Amazon's current share price. There is a substantial amount of possibility for Tesla to meet or exceed the comparison to Amazon as far as the share price is discussed."
"So I guess at the end of the day there really isn't a Tesla being built for the ""masses"". Just a massive highly automated factory turning out a cheapened version of what they already produce for a little less money. Sounds like a great business plan."
Elon Musk single handedly put NASA out of business. He's about to take a big bite out of the telecom industry. The automotive industry by now has gotten the hint and it's why $TSLA keeps rocketing up.
thank goodness the week is over.. see ya'll next Tuesday... best of luck and hope you have a better weekend than today...
"Tesla is down 10% in a week. If gas went on sale for 10% off, wouldn't you wanna fill up?"

"How delusional are the Tesla cultists?Some of them ACTUALLY BELIEVE that this stock fraud can hit $40,000 a share...even though the company has never built a single car profitably in its 17 year history. $40,000 a share would make the company more valuable than the entire U.S. and Canadian stock markets...combined. Whatever it is they're smoking, I wish I had some!"

Go tesla!
Musk sold Tesla shares at lower price(2nd offering) and bought bitcoin at high price.

Tesla first quarter will bluu on a expectations. They finally have sales all over the world time for real delivery numbers to happen
"Here is what Tesla Haters say: Tesla does not make profit selling EV but all other auto companies including Ford and GM will make huge profit selling their future ""EVs"""
I find it funny for the past 5 months that people have been saying the stock is over valued. It has only gone up.
Elon made enough on Bitcoin in 3 weeks to pay fir another factory. Do I hear South America ?? Scotland maybe ?
"Diversified, people thought before the split it was expensive at 1000 then the same around 2000"
TSLA at close dec 18 is $695. . JPM Analyst expected $90....
"Tesla is more valuable than all other brands (BMW, Merc, Ford, GM, Toyota, Honda and many more combined). Don't listen to the analyst, ask yourself, are the rest of the makers not creating EVs? Are there no new EVs like Lucid coming up? Is Apple not building EVs? You think Tesla can take over the entire market and worth a PE of 1200?"
Super happy I held all through recent drama. Yesterday had me second guessing. Now having ‘wish I added more’ remorse. Perhaps it’s not too late. Anyway congrats All!
Last chance to run
"Curious, those who hang around here making jokes about Tesla and Musk - are you short/own puts and hoping your wit will dissuade a potential buyer or two? Or do you think this is the best platform to launch your stand-up career? Or just bored and have nothing better to do with your time?"
"TSLA gotta show some love to India, because millions of Indian investors are investing in TSLA."
Thank you bears for your cheaper shares lol
"If Tesla loses one billion dollars in the second quarter, is that better than expected?"
"OPEN LETTER TO $TSLA LONGS:Look, it's time to admit that it does not look good for Tesla. If you've been long for a week or 6 years, it's time to bail. At best, this is dead sideways money. AT BEST. Ask yourself why you were long in Tesla in the first place, and you will come to following conclusion: EVs are going to change the world. It will solve about 30 different problems in one fell swoop. And you would be correct!!!!! So your hearts have all been in the right place, all along. Absolutely no denying it. I really implore you to look at other investment options in EVs: NIO, KNDI, SOLO, just to name a few. Full disclosure: I am long NIO. But that's really not the reason why I post this, so I can lure you into NIO. Follow your heart and get out of this stock. There are so many more companies with REAL INTEGRITY that want to change the world, just like Elon wanted to (and did). But Elon could not get out of the way of his own ego. And you must see that. Absolutely gorgeous and life-changing machines, these Teslas. Absolutely. But it's time to get out of this company."
looks like recovery day tomorrow for stock market
This Site must be where all the TSLA shorts and Tesla hater hangout. This is good. As long as they are occupied here they will certainly miss the real money. Buy and Hold.
"All TSLA investors will want a TSLA car, and will be pushing everyone around them to get a TSLA car plus TSLA everything else. TSLA's fan base is one heck of a force."
700 today. Pay attention to the last 15 minutes. Is where the crossing line will happen. Majority of funds will buy right before the close.
All the bashers here saying when it crashes people will lose money. Well yeah but if they only give back some of what they gained it isn't losing. I've only had shares since the end of November that I bought just under $550. It would have to drop 30% from the current levels and I'd still be even. So anyone who has had it pre split is not going to lose sleep thinking they might go broke. They have a ton of green to play with.
"I need your opinion please. I am trying to justify buying Tesla at today's share price because I knew about when it was only $8 ps 10 years ago and did not pull the trigger. But here's the thing I think, since no one thinks it is a big deal that Apple is up 38,405% (by my calculations) in the last 10 years, why do people find it difficult to understand that Tesla is up 16,220%? I know the financials are completely different between the 2 companies, but hey, if Apple can be up 38,400%, why can't Tesla? TSLA still has a long way to go to catch up to AAPL....yes?"

Fellow shorts: What price did you short at? I shorted yesterday at $880.
Tesla keeps going up so fast I'm thinking of adding more shares 
330 or 340?
tesla is getting ready for S&P 500the new secondary is to prepare to get in the DOW next year.
"Tesla Berlin will get the go ahead, but at a price. Don't yet know what that'll be, but incensed German's get pretty charged up (and vindictive). I live between Boston and Munich and this is a big story in Germany.Politicians can't let (what they regard as) Tesla hubris go unpunished. They could restrict water supply, which certainly would reduce output. They could also charge Tesla exorbitant annual fees for a myriad of violations. Germans also see the $323 million annual lease that Tesla pays China just to set up shop there, and they feel a bit had. I think next month's ruling will probably irk a lot of Tesla investors (and it won't help Tesla's valuation either)."

GRAPHITE will be a necessary part of the EV BOOM! Here’s who I’m trying to capitalize with. EV market is poised to grow $44B during 2020 - 2024 with CAGR of 22% Graphite is an essential element in lithium ion batteries to power EVsAs $TSLA opens gigafactories the demand for graphite will spike. The Nevada factory alone will need 35K tons of graphite per year. LION is a principal supplier of graphite and a great opportunity for investors to capitalize on the massively expanding battery and EV sector. LION announced TODAY that it continues to progress Madagascar project and are completing the final mine development plan right now. The graphite deposits there are associated with topographic highs that are exploited via cost-effective free-dig methods. LION also has the Neuron Graphite Project ion Manitoba = potentially richest graphite discovery in NA = 76% carbon content LION price dipped today to $0.135 and is looking like a great opportunity to buy as news flow will continue and demand for graphite exponentially increases over the coming months and years.With mining assets in place and future assets in the works IMO LION is poised to become a major provider of graphite for the global demand and therefore is undervalued rn. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lion-moves-closer-putting-graphite-081500229.html
I see my fellow Robinhood users are following my advise! Selling Tesla!
"It seems that the Robinhood apps have finally taught junior investors a lesson, P/E matters."
Very strange you guys.Daimler up 9% today...Tesla down. How can this be? This is against the laws of physics.
"Nice buy dip, loading the boat on the $10 upgrade alone, The $AAPL Rumor is frosting on the cake. Like this better than $TSLA"
"Tesla is like Christmas, every 3 months,"
"Could be the last time we see these prices, excluding another split. That's why I didn't sell at $900."
"You take a barely profitable company (that doesn't really belong in the index-oriented S&P 500) with an exorbitant market cap and they surrender cash to load up the balance sheet with hyper-volatile, intrinsically worthless cryptocurrency, all while the market is already juiced by the Fed.You now have created the match which can ignite a stock panic due to tech margin calls. Plenty of totally unrelated, stodgy quality names will get hit and I am already savoring the chance to pick them up at a nice discount."
"Well, my only regret not going all in during the market crash....I wonder how high tesla can go, Just keep going up and up and up...it doesn’t make any senses."
Down one day as much as GM's total market cap.
"In a few months, the car-buying market will be swimming in a wide array of EV model designs by a plethora of automakers to suit all individual tastes. Tesla will be nothing special..."

"The two greatest steam locomotive builders were Alco and Baldwin. Both tried to build diesels, however Baldwin went bankrupt in the mid 1950’s and Alco struggled until it quit in 1968. They were replaced by diesel locomotive newcomers EMD and GE. Yes there will continue to be a demand for oil, however it is going to shrink substantially. Similarly try finding a mechanical calculator today."

I guess, musk desperates.The recall also will weigh on q1 earnings and will destroy the last phantasy.Mark this posting."
Everything else are Red. TSLA is going strong. I guess right now it’s the only thing that you can expect to gain.

bitcoin has zero intrinsic value its fiat hype akin to the tulip mania
Who wants a vehicle which when the battery breaks the entire thing has to be replaced .So in other words a new engine Insanity Who wants car u have to plug in when u park on the street?/?? No thanks.
"When Musk speaks of a battery company rivaling the auto division you're now looking at two big companies in one, for starters. The million mile battery will be the next bomb he'll drop, hopefully out of the blue with no prior warning to shorts. The guy is planning on being a cornerstone battery supplier to all brands in the future. He knows well that the battery will be as important as the combustion engine is now, he's getting in on that ground floor and likely has the million mile tech already."
My cost basis is 228. My plan was to hold for 7 to 10 years and im sticking to it. Tesla will be worth much more than what it is today even after this price action. Not selling a single share.

"Conflict of Interest.TSLA issued new shares to invest in EV, SpaceX, new factory, and future of human transplantation system. We as investors bought this dream.In turn, Elon gambled 1.5B USD investor's money in BTC.He should be put into prison"
I remember in the train wrecks of 2000 and 2008 the darling stocks were the last to plunge as retail investors kept buying the dips all the way down to almost nothing. That is how the institutional investors fleece retail and get out with only marginal losses.

Tesla sells out first quarter of Model Y electric SUV in China in just a few days
"Tesla to the . Hold up, it’s already there!"
Keep things in perspective. Two down days of around 4% are nice but tomorrow will tell the tale. First support is at the 200 DMA $216.71. Then it would be the recent low of $187.87. If that falls we might see a real blood bath. Now it is rising off its lows in a red market. I am hoping for a crash below $200 but realistically I have my doubts.In the days before last earnings it was trading around $250.00. Faded $20.00 in the days leading up to earnings and then plunged another $25.00 earnings day and the week that followed. Bottomed at around $205 before it bounced to $225.00 a couple of weeks later. I say it will be lower Thursday. How much is anybodies guess.
"Remember Tesla shorters, the more Tesla shares you short now, the more you're going to have to buy back later at a higher price in order to cover your position, and the poorer you'll become!"

"On Jan 19, it was reported Tesla executives were in contact with Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan to discuss opportunities for Tesla to sell its vehicles in the country."
This is mainly the shorts having to cover before the year end to realize their losses this year. Fake out rally in my opinion. Reality will hit next year. TSLA could drop 30% or more in 2021 when it loses market share.
$15 increase in the stock price during AH is roughly how much of a return?
"Alright, lets put this argument to bed right now. Before anyone compares Tesla to Toyota, Volkswagen, BMW or {insert auto brand name here}, do this -- repeat to yourself, ""Amazon is just a website that sells stuff"". After that question $AMZN price of $3,111.95 per share (post numerous splits). Although Amazon is a profitable company, its share price looks ridiculous to me.$TSLA is a company whose founder has spawned other forward-looking companies. Tesla has single handedly innovated an industry stuck in time. Investors can see and feel what's coming and are loving it!"

"Tesla competitive position around world.1.> They having hard time selling and retaining 10% market share in China that they forced to export (Something Elon said not going to do at all just months ago)2.> They scared so much from new Lucid car that lower Model S price twice in two day even when Lucid car not available.3.> They only manufacture Model S/ X in Fremont plant and no plan to expand anywhere. They can't utilize 100% capacity of Model S and Model X as most not buying it anymore.4.> They are so scared from China competitor that they price Model Y way below market expectation.5.> Europe Model 3 is not NO.1 EV car anymore6.> Even Norway which has highest EV market share in EV, VW beat them with similar price ID3 (It actually bit higher as per my google search)7.> EV credit sale is only reason they have double digit gross margin and small net profit. Without EV credit Sale ( Not clear who spending billion to buy as 80% of EV sale by other manufacturers and So by that way total EV Credit worth $5B which does not add up at all)So can they manufacture 5M cars by 2030 sure. 15M cars sure why not 150M cars.Question isn't about Supply, Those problem temporary and can resolved.Question is demand. They have bit edge in technology as per Analyst estimate and yet Other Car maker already beating them in their own game ( Analyst forget other car manufaucture advantage and how they able to manufacture EV cars in large Volume (Tesla stock jump $100B like they achieve something imposible task to manufacture 500K car even after raising 10's billion dollar though new stocks) that China Tesla has 12% market share and Europo < 10% now."

Yesterday they make multiple bad news in $shop as good news and today multiple $tsla news as good news. Look like some powerful Force overwelm any sell off activity. Good side on Shop was it close at low which means limit is closer then look. Let’s see where TSLA end trade. My bet 785 area but I think Tesla also have lot of believer
Meanwhile Tezombies/Teslosers/Redditors...
"Tesla shareholders are not looking ""into the future"" when investing; they are looking into their imaginations. Many of them are quite intelligent and have excellent imaginations; the problem is: they are imagining things without a good foundation in science, math, or business knowledge -- a foundation that allows one to imagine future events with high degrees of accuracy. Their imagination is effectively delusion because it is based on seriously flawed premises."
$1000 this month mark my words
Tesla is like that girl I keep messing around with on and off. The thing I haven't been able to decide is if she's the one or if when we marry she will just divorce me and take half my money. I have so many mixed emotions when it comes to this stock.
I am asking for 900 resistance be taken over to 1100. I see it coming.

Orderly fashion please 1 at a time guys the titanic is going down. Institutions get first life boats.
"Ron Baron, for instance, is a longtime, renowned bull on electric maker Tesla(TSLA). In an interview with Barron's in early 2020, Baron said he expected the electric-vehicle to reach 1.5 trillion market value by 2030. Tesla stock soared more than 740% last year and is now halfway to that valuation. It also is the biggest driver by far, of the 149% gain for the $7.1 billion Baron's Partners Fund (BPTRX) which beat the Russel 3000 by 128 percentage points.The Baron Partners fund began buying Tesla in 2014. It last purchase was in Feb 2016 for less than $40 per share. The stock is now $850. Co-managers Ron and Michael Baron have trimmed the funds on Tesla position since then. At the beginning of 2020, it had grown about 17%, The fund sold 20% of its stake throughout 2020 but the stock rose so quickly that by the end of the year, nearly half of the funds assets were invested in Tesla. We are more confident in Tesla's business fundamentals than we were at the time of our first purchase says Michael Baron, adding that the firm is nonetheless mindful of portfolio concentration."
"""PSSST... Hey, you. Wanna buy my business for $1,000,000? It earns $600 per year.""That's essentially TSLA."
"For cult members, the reason tesla isn't moving up into earnings as it usually does is,... there was a leaked email that said they missed big time.It's not gwonna be gwood."

"$700 and earns 0.80 a quarter, u bought a bubble"
"JP Morgan seems to be more confident about Nikola and it is not doing so well. Tesla is projected to sell 500,000 cars this year (369,000 last year) and is expanding into Europe. Perhaps a MBA at JP Morgan did not like what Elon Musk said about MBAs."

"IMO, Tesla should run hard into probably Tuesday next week, then see a 15-20% correction after earnings, then time for another run too 1200 by end of Q2"
"I see lots of shorts keep coming up saying the stock is overvalued, the technical analysis blah blah blah...is fine, most of the people buying long are aware of that, it is not hard to see that strictly based on the existing figures, it is well over what it should. But still, S&P comes and takes them in; do you think they don't have analysts to say the same things? Why is it that they are included Tesla, though?"

LOL TSLA shorties probably thought their dreams were coming true yesterday morning. Into the close yesterday and throughout today they've been burned massively. Keep insulting the longs like me who still have most of your money and keep shorting it more and giving us more of your money. The fact some of you would throw away your life savings to see this stock go down is absolutely astonishing. Even if TSLA were to crash it still wouldn't even go near the March lows of last year. Keep dreaming of your mansion in Beverly Hills while longs actually earn the money to buy one.

"I would advise all to buy Fisker, or Ford or any other real American stock that doesn't do a dollardump but places confidence in the economy. Musk messed up here. Btc is a computer file, an algorithm, a program. It has no intrinsic value. It is electrical vibes on a fibre-optic cable. The cable has more resell value then a bit or byte. I seriously am worried about this BTC creating the next bubble crisis."
Cathie Woods should buy more $TSLA and $BTC right now unless she is selling as well.
"For 2020, Tesla Inc. posted its first full-year profit of $721 million compares with an $862 million loss in 2019.Sales of $31.5 billion compares with $24.6 billion in 2019. The company topped Wall Street's sales expectation of about #31.1 billion.The company's cash holdings totaled around $19.4 billion as of year-end 2020, up from around $6.3 billion end of 2019."
"Dissident. Tesla casts the body parts. Unless it’s pressing molten metal, there’s no press. And as far as other car manufacturers “late to EV”, my neighbors benn driving a BMW EV for over a year now. And Toyota’s hybrid Prius has been around at least 5 yrs. they’re not late . There is no sense of urgency. The Texas disaster is a clear case why NOT to buy an EV. BTW ask someone with a TESLA what it cost to charge their car. $50 to $80. Every week. I can fill up my Toyota for$30. And drive over 450 miles. It’s just a toy and loosing its attraction . Going down very hard. The longer you wait to get out the more it’s gonna hurt."

I am starting to think this is a new era of investing. Pe doesnt matter in this company. Its all about trust in Elon and his products and innovation.

"All in all the whole of markets are over bloated and in dangerous territories, over priced and no longer going on shares earnings per pricing fundamentals,most whole of markets are going on popularity favoritism based shares,most fund managers and people are not doing there DD or home work bur telling people to keep investing in a over illed priced dangerous market just waiting to collapse,there is a bad market crash on the horrizon.The trouble with those signs is that while they are very obvious with the benefit of hindsight, they aren’t so easy to see in real time.In 1929, JFK’s father Joseph Kennedy Sr. picked up on one of those subtle signs and didn’t just get out at the top, he scored a massive windfall on the way down as well,yes he was one of those few who did not loose all his money back in the devastating 1929`s crash,how you ask..by sitting in a shoe shine chair having his shoes shined ...and yes it was the shoe shine boys advise that made him think drastically,this all very simple sign most people do not care to believe in or digest has always been proven right time over time,once again it seems it will prove more over."
"Recently Tesla has done some great things to clean up their value. They were able to significantly reduce vehicle inventory while transitioning from 3 shifts to 2 shifts for Model S and X and now will be able to securitize a good portion of lease payment streams, which Tesla carries on its books since the leases were not able to be fully recognized as unlike the dealer model, the leases previously could be pushed onto dealers in terms of revenue recognition. The previously have done the same thing with former SolarCity leases and now should be at over 50% loans and cash vs. leases moving forward while focusing on more profitable and higher end roofing products. Not sure how they approach storage, but imagine the same trends are happening.Few people really understood the value of 20 year recurring revenue streams from Solar, but they have been able to convert and move forward more of this money to help fund more growth, without tapping equity."
"I am from Canada , I am yet to see a EV other than Tesla on road here. Already Tesla is status symbol here. People feel proud to own TSLA more than Audi or BMW.My friends bought Tesla Cars .. and for the same money I am buying the company let’s see if I made the right decision "
I started my position at the opening.
This is NOT looking good....perhaps Gordon Johnson was correct??
"$TSLA just announced production of 509,737 vehicles in 2020 and delivery of 499,550 (i.e., 98% sales of manufactured items)....wow. That represents 36% increase over previous year and 180,070 vehicles delivered in 4th quarter represents 30% increase over 3rd quarter deliveries. To the moon!!"
8 GIGA PRESSES AT BERLIN PLANT. I don't think anyone has truly understood this potential. 500k deliveries in Berlin is way too conservative.
"Doesn’t matter how many manufacture open and make electric cars tesla will be number one in it is field and it will stay number one for a long time to come that’s not include all the good things coming soon for auto pilot and others￼ So guys don’t worry Tesla stock God willing will reach $10,000 God willing"
So has anyone ever gone to the Tesla investor relations page and looked at the forms? I wonder what it is that every quarter the file a CT Order to have things left out of their reports. Is that common practice? I have not seen that on any of the stocks I invest in. I wonder what it is they do not want to disclose to investors?
"Definitely long on Tesla for earnings and Q2 guidance. Seems like some of you haven't been paying attention :)Consistently reduced production cost every quarter, switch to online sales reducing overhead, purchased truck delivery service to reduce costs, Model 3 explosive sales (Delivery report stated that they had way more orders than they could deliver right now, and website traffic is up 93%), first quarter with China and Europe sales, and so much more positive news Tesla is going to surprise investors this ER"

Her departure follows Tesla’s disclosure last week that Chief Accounting Officer Eric Branderiz had left for personal reasons.

"Here is my take and bash all you want! I'm excited for this earnings call. It may not have a huge run, however I feel it should be significant. The stock has been stagnant with no big drops and no big gains. The setting is nice for a positive earnings call. This is going to be a good week!"

"Tesla delivered 180,570 electric vehicles in the fourth quarter, beating its previous record as well as Wall Street expectations!"
"On the Dec. 8 edition of ""The Wrap"" on Motley Fool Live, host Jason Hall made a bold proposition: Tesla should acquire Ford (NYSE:F). Not only would this go a long way toward jump-starting the company's growth needs by acquiring Ford's massive global manufacturing footprint, but Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk would gain a leg up in fully disrupting the auto industry. Only this time, with the manufacturing heft of one of the industry's heavyweights."

Tesla is over-priced by there is no where for institutions to invest large sums of money. So they place it with the tech giants.

Looking forward to some of these analysts being held accountable for outrageous targets on Tesla.

For all you treehuggers out there:The best thing you can do for the environment is to keep driving an old car and keep paying for the repairs. Less waste of materials going to the landfill plus you’re giving mechanics work and stimulating your local economy. You can’t tell that to a millennials though. They prefer to drive around in an iPhone car that can just be discarded after a couple years while they tell themselves that they’re helping the world. I weep.
"I live in Rhode Island and I definately have started to see Teslas pretty much every day. So that pretty much proves Tesla is worth $45 billion. Except that I see a lot more Fords every day and people didn't wait 2 years for them, they aren't falling apart, and they can get parts and service for them. So that must prove Ford is a trillion dollar company."

"How corporate welfare supports Elon's $40 Billion bonus.

"The Tesla stock fraud continue its decline.Tesla is an electric car company which has never built a single car profitably in its 17 year existence. The stock has been pumped to absurd valuations based on numerous promotion schemes perpetrated by Elon Musk, various insiders and enablers on Wall Street such as Cathie Wood. The most insidious of these promotions is painting Tesla as an ""energy"" company, when - in fact - its forays into solar and home battery systems have been disastrous."

Of course, the stock has risen tremendously, so there is hope amongst the short(ers) end of the stick, but exactly now? If you are so sure, why not sharing this with the market and earn yourself an incredible amount of money by shorting. Or, do they shout it from the rooftop just to be sure that anxiety kicks in, helping their short interest gains to be fully realized?"
if Tsla had started as a non profit company...where would they be now?
Just checking in with our local short sellers. We all good?
PE of more than 1300......this is such big fraud I have never seen. Here in Europe and especially in Germany Tesla is low quality car which only some fanboys want to have. The shops are empty and it is a shame what bad quality Tesla is delivering with its cars. A friend of mine has boughtbone and he wants to buy once the timeline for the ev fee form the Fischs allows to sell without sanctions. The bubble will burst in a dramatic action never seen at WALLSTREET. Tesla will be pulverisied within a week.
"Even with Tequila sales, rockets, robots, EVs, data AI, batteries, and Elon going to the Mars and discovering gem stones, this stock failed to clear today and is grossly over priced.

"Lowering prices = soft demand. Investing in Bitcoin instead of new factories = soft demand. First quarter results (mid-April) are going to be very, very, very bad. Carbon credits and bitcoin will short up the finances, but deliveries and revenue from sales will be very bad."
Washington Post pushes anti-Elon Musk narrative. The publication was bought personally by Jeff Bezos (Mr. Not Reached Orbit Yet) from the family that owned it for 80 years for a quarter of a billion (small change for him). So much for objective professional journalism.
"So is Cathie going to put other peoples money where her mouth is with Ark buying heavily today?If TSLA is going to $4000 (or was it $5000 it's hard to keep up with her ever increasing price targets), it's just an incredible bargain at below $700."

"My friend's delivery date was just moved by about 6 months; she had an early Model 3 reservation. Date change was posted when she logged in 4 days ago. That is the second time. Reservation cancelled, and she is buying an Alpha Romeo."
"Having now watched NIO's presentation I have to say that I'm really impressed.Everything seems very well thought and they are really on the edge of AD. The big range of 1000km, replaceable battery will be able to make this a game changer. This can have Teslas valuation in a few years but with 10 millions of vehicles sold.Building the replacing stations will make ""charging"" much quicker and they don't need so many as the replacing of the battery will take max 5 minutes. They can recharge all the batteries in the station overnight and have them ready the next day. Every car manufacturer will have a replaceable battery.I never thought I might consider investing in a car company, but this looks, even given it's extremely high value something, very interesting. It's interesting to know how much IP they have in form of patents. I haven't researched that yet. They topped the camera by a factor of 7 compared to the current Teslas...use flexible lidar to enhance the tracking of only certain objects, have redundancy with the multiple viewing angles. They equip all cars with the same hardware and you can book AD on a monthly basis which is great if you don't want it or if you travel abroad for a year. It's really a milestone in car manufacturing the way I see it."
TESLA slowing down production. There is less demand for TESLA. China is upset with Tesla product. Investors are dumping it now. This is just the beginning. It will go to 320 to 360 before it rises.

"Musk is leveraging his legacy using shareholder funds. There are two fates. He will go on to a much higher level or he will crash and burn. I think he will crash and burn. His legacy will be that he flew too close to the sun. His financial autopsy will show that he made the mistake of arrogance. Investors were as much at fault for the implosion of Musk as he was. Musk will be remembered as a case study, a cautionary tale, in the annuls of business, leadership and strategy. Brilliance gone wild. Investors in TSLA should now clearly understand an autocrat is running the company. They should take any credit or fault for what happens here on out. I have no positions in TSLA, and no plans to do so directly or otherwise."
TSLA is the mother of all bubbles.Expect a disaster soon! Company is not worth 1/10 of the market cap today.

Buy point at 350.
"Bubble ^ BubbleGM, Ford, BMW, Volkswagen, NIO, Toyota, Nissan, and Lucid are ramping up their EV vehicles this year.Competition is heating up with many options!Nothing justifies the 1T market-cap of Tesla!"
I know I am getting a little ahead of myself since they have not even reached 5k per week yet but what is the new planned date to reach 10k per week? Originally it was this month if I remembered correctly. Then it was moved to sometime this year. But with all of the delay in reaching 5k per week I was not sure if it got pushed out further. Will it require any additional lines? We are already @ 3 lines to be able to reach 5k per week.

"Not only can the market makers take your TSLA shares by dropping the price and have you sell at a lower price with a loss; they can also entice you to sell at higher trading prices with a gain. But, after you have sold those shares they continue to bring the price up and you have to buy back less shares and at a higher price."

"At the $800B market cap, TSLA is trading at roughly 20X next year's target revenue of $40B. Most car companies trade at less than 0.5X revenue, because the margins are so slim and there is no reason to believe in the long run that TSLA's profit margins will be any better than any other carmaker. So if TSLA grows revenues by 50% per year compounded (unprecedented for a car company), in roughly 7 years they will generate enough revenue to warrant a 1X revenue multiple .... and the stock would still be overpriced. The more likely scenario is they grow much less than that and the stock price falls to a realistic multiple, so in 7 years it might be worth $50B-$100B?"

"I haven't had much time to poke through the earnings release yet, but it appears that 401MM in regulatory credits is still greater than 270MM in EPS. It appears that Tesla still doesn't make money building and selling cars.Certainly the idea of 50% annual growth is appealing in a world where 3% growth is considered acceptable, but is it really worth 1,320x earnings? (that is what the P/E is at $850, with $0.64 in annual earnings).There will almost certainly be a lot said of margins (blah, blah), but the two over riding realities are:1. Tesla used $1,580MM of regulatory credits to generate $721MM of GAAP earnings.2. Competition is coming.Good luck as these realizations come to the fore.(It is also worth noting that the operating costs for the new facilities has not yet started to accumulate, but the company's growth in unit sales (61%) contained a significantly larger portion of ever cheaper cars and Tesla's market share continues to dwindle due to both competition based on feature/function as well as price.). There is almost no chance that their marketshare remains above 10% for the long term.Enjoy the share price . . . it may even go higher as we get closer to a blow off top.Guru."
"Tesla is a great stock to buy and hold for long term, just check the 3 years weekly charts. I won't be surprised if it reaches $2000 mark this year."

"Nice price action! Was just excelling around with the last 30 days trading data trying to give myself a better feel on the 30 day chart, here's what I found.Using Yahoo data - over the past month, 1,122,874,238 shares traded. 1.12 BILLION! Average daily volume of about 51 million shares traded.Not sure what the public float (tradeable shares) is post split, if anyone knows that number it would be a nice one to know.Those 1.12 billion shares were bought and sold at an average price of $573.85. I didn't use the average closing price for the day to arrive at that number, for each day I averaged the day high and low, then averaged that price over the past 30 days to calculate that number.From that, I would expect there to be a sh#t ton of support at $573 should we ever need it, lol. As I type this it's about to go through $649. So.....the shorts would like you to believe the sky is about to fall. Some overpaid analyst would even like you to believe the stock price is going to about zero soon.A drop to $573 from the ATH....is 12%. Barely a haircut, and hair grows back.And we are currently trading less than 1% below the ATH price.And tomorrow and Monday, the SP500 funds need to acquire roughly 112 million shares, by my calculations. Or roughly 2x average daily volume over the past 30 days.Plus all the other good stuff coming - deliveries number (expect a beat) , Q4 numbers (expect a beat), whatever new or refreshed that's going to roll off the S and X lines after the retool, and 6 months later we have Berlin and Austin bearing fruit.Just my take - limited downside to $573 at worst on the speculated 'dip' some are talking about. Almost unlimited upside, as we know, Tesla don't trade on fundamentals!Cheers:)"

Boy it's funny how all these Bears come out the woodwork when the chips are down. If you're shorting TSLA you have money to throw away.
"imo $TSLA is down heading into earnings due to the fear that somehow Elon’s comp package will somehow make the company not profitable and thus put it behind another year for S&P500. From all the research I’ve done, it seems the real experts behind the financial analysis and predictions of Tesla have this pegged at GAAP earnings of 300-500 million this quarter alone. Next quarter of 1 billion in GAAP earnings. My opinion is we’ll see the stock trend higher and I will keep my $2300 ($460) EOY prediction from June as a safe bet. All time highs are very much in play as it becomes more clear that Tesla is becoming a profitable earnings machine especially when they post their first billion dollar GAAP earnings in q4."

euphoria is not a good sign on the stock market. I've often made the mistake and afterwards I was punished. In the end you sit on losses and still hold onto the share because someone said something positive (Morgan Stanley) and you don't want reality to come true. be careful. i know the longies hate me
When is the best time to go short in Tesla. This says nothing else about being right.Is Tesla's share price overvalued? Hell yes!Is there normal valuation? No definitely not!Will the price drop in the long term? Probably..Is the price going to rise sharply first? Chances are it will.It's not about being right. It's about making money. The call options are ridiculously expensive. What I do myself is set up calendar spreads on tesla.

Tesla has been holding back a $1.5 billion tax loss deferment that they could drop on the market any quarter including today if they decide to. Would add around $1.50 in EPS and obviously cut the P/E substantially on just that alone. Something that the “PE 1700!” people never tell you about.

I wish I had the ability to buy a brand new car for $25,000 and not worry about paying for gas. We need more companies like this. Our world is falling apart. I’ll admit the presentation was average at best. However it shows that they are real people and not actors. They have nothing to hide and you can see the excitement in their eyes. This is a Big deal.

Then MAYBE a pull back on Monday 5% tops with another slow and steady run for ALL of 2021. year end results for 2020 will be great followed by Shanghai volume increases of Model Y already in production (Early) thus another great 1st quarter for 2021. 2nd quarter will bring Berlin on line making VW sweat like a pig.

If you can’t see $1000 per share come September then your simply Blinded by guys like Chanos, Johnson, Brinkman Etc. Tesla has made me into a millionaire this is beyond my wildest dreams I’m not expecting a straight line to $1000 but there is very little room for substantial down turns not with this calendar of events. This WITHOUT the much talked about FSD."

"Surprisingly, tsla is still within 6% of the all-time-high, after the bitcoin purchase. I would expect it to contract at least 20% since tsla stock is built on confidence, and this confidence is demolished by the bitcoin move--i.e., it is a claim that the bitcoin has brighter future than tsla since tsla had just recently sold its stocks to buy the bitcoin."

Is 1 billion musks money or Tesla money"
"Shorts had a couple of good days they are so happy like a zombie invasion. Remember, time is on the longs side, shorts are too limited in their war chest. They have either shorter puts because it’s cheaper, so they take the time risk. Or they are shorting TSLA, that is a more dangerous approach because they could get margin call or they can quickly ramp up the losses for every dollar TSLA goes up. So longs, wait it out and be profitable. Time is the most valuable tool we have."

"IMO people criticize Tesla too much for their current production. They will get up to speed later this year and the years to come. In addition, people seem to label Tesla as just an EV-maker thus comparing them to VW or Ford (which have higher production capacities ofc). Tesla's soft- and hardware, in particular the autonomous driving system they have and keep developing will make Teslas car safety and future utilization of self-sufficient transport unparalleled (speaking as software scientist)"
"Do you folks really think TESLA can compete with PLUG POWER in the LONG HAUL FLEET TRUCKING MARKET? — LOL. PLUG POWER is just starting to work with O.E.M.’s to deliver their Hydrogen ProGen Engines (30% to 45% higher energy density/“power” than the competition) which are very advantageous for LONG HAUL FLEET TRUCKING. Here’s the main advantages of Hydrogen versus Batteries:(1). Liquid “Green” Hydrogen Fuel (Clean, ZERO Emissions) — versus — Toxic Batteries charged by an electric grid using primarily dirty fossil fuels. And, batteries are putting a tremendous strain on the electrical grid — increasing the potential for “black outs”;(2). 500 MILE RANGE per Liquid “Green” Hydrogen Tank; So, install 2 tanks and drive for 1,000 Miles —> “DOUBLE THE RANGE” of a battery semi truck;(3). 5 to 6 times FASTER REFUELING —> Time is money. By the time a Battery Semi is getting charged, a Hydrogen Fuel Cell Semi Truck is already at their destinations loading dock — unloading their cargo! — LOL. (4). LOWER OPERATING COSTS —> PLUG POWER offers Real Time IoT Monitoring of Predictive Service/Maintenance!With PLUG POWER vertically integrating to build the “GREEN HYDROGEN SUPERHIGHWAY” across America, the issue of a lack of fueling stations will soon be a NON-ISSUE :). As a $PLUG shareholder, I sure am looking forward to the LONG HAUL FLEET TRUCKING MARKET getting rolling :) And, with PLUG POWER’s New State-of-the-Art Automated PEM Stack & Electrolyzer Gigafactory soon to be operational, the manufacturing costs of the engine components are expected to be lower by 50%. At the same time, $PLUG will be building the 5 New Liquid “Green” Hydrogen Generation Plants along the “GREEN HYDROGEN SUPERHIGHWAY” which will increase their Gross Profit Margin on the “recurring” revenue stream of FUEL by between 30% to 35%. In the near future, PLUG POWER is going to enter into the LONG HAUL FLEET TRUCKING MARKET. I just wanted to give the TESLA shareholders a “heads up” :) ... INVEST & HOLD $PLUG ... for the LONG HAUL :)."

All the bears here who speak ill of Tesla are short term simple minded people who do not understand the power of the United States and American businesses. Here is an American company that is showing us we can use electricity for transportation, use artificial intelligence to self-drive, and show machines can drive better than humans. You can only fight change for so long until it becomes inevitable. There is reason why shorts are so angry and bitter. The reason is because they are poor and they rely on their judgements rather than believing in America!"

"I don’t like posting on these sites, but I feel that the report on TSLA is wrong. Sales were good. Profit was down and missed the so called numbers BUT if you dive deeper into the numbers money is being spent on plant expansion and new plants. Tsla bought land that is full of lithium for battery production, new semi truck, research for new products and new plants in Berlin , texas and China. They are doing the same thing AMZN did reinvest in more of the parts to build the company and take market share now rather than future ahead of the competition"
OK looks like settlement is not so reached after all.....
#tsla is going to tank at least 30-40% in the coming weeks due to transfer of monies to NIO. Don’t forget to save tons of cash on the sideline to buy tsla for “cheap” both their cars and stock. I’m adding more at $90. LOL
get your puts ready . two things at this valuation. . raise more money ( 10 % drop ) people gonna trim or take profit to play with house money . ( 10 % drop ) be wise . get your puts ready to go . easy money
Vanguard just filed the 13G form with the SEC yesterday (Wed. Feb 10). A company fills out a 13G form when it owns over 5% of a company. Therefore Vanguard's purchase is current and now owns 6.5% and will likely result in a green day and shows which direction Tesla is heading.

This thing is going to pop something fierce. How many stocks we seen do this over the years and then go down like a house of bricks? The ev bubble is driven by a seemingly endless demand curve. What will pop it? The day Tesla makes lots of cars but few people will afford them or want them or they have 35 other competitors that do a better job. I think the stock can easily go to 1100... but when it starts to drop it’s going to go to 200.. or less.. then shake out and take 25 years to return to 1100. If Elon sold some shares it also might do it. Hope he doesn’t want to do anything with his new found wealth boys.
This is the best investment you can do: Buy Tesla! 
"“I used Autopilot all the time on that stretch of the highway,” Molthan, 44, said in a phone interview. “But now I feel like this is extremely dangerous. It gives you a false sense of security. I’m not ready to be a test pilot. It missed the curve and drove straight into the guardrail. The car didn’t stop -- it actually continued to accelerate after the first impact into the guardrail.”... but hey... if the stock stays high or even goes up today then that means the market likes it when people crash while on autopilot... it must mean the market thinks Tesla is more advanced than everyone else because now they have more of their victim's data.""I'M NOT READY TO BE A TEST PILOT"""
"I had an electric car once. It was the first car i ever owned. Got it for Christmas when I was 7years old in 1962, nine years before Elon was born.Half a dozen fresh ""D"" batteries and that thing would do zero to 10 in 3.5 seconds! I drove that thing everywhere until my girlfriend and I broke the suspension on it one Sunday after Sunday School."
"Private Money bringing down $ALYI share price by trying to shake stop limits, has plunged share price down to .08. Seeing as the crypto currency launch is Friday, the down turn of the stock makes no sense other than private money manipulation, to try and buy share price lower for more substantial gains. This would be the most opportune time for investors to get in before Wednesday , Thursday and Friday rallies. Soon you will see ALYI with the EV elites, $TSLA, $NIO, $XPEV, $NKLA and others."
I plan to buy 30 shares with 1:5 leverage(20% margin). Do you guys think it will ever deep under 680$?
Even the 1 year chart looks exponential
"The inventory issue will be the final nail in the financial coffin. Let’s examine the 114 X/S sitting in inventory in Canada. Right now they are Finished Goods on the Tesla Balance Sheet as at end of Q3.., now, it is highly probable that Tesla will have to offer significant discounts to move that inventory.Remember, this is a company desperate to raise cash due to pending debt obligations. Having a $130k cdn car ( $100k Usd) sitting in some parking lot in Canada does nothing to raise cash. Rather, they drop the price through discounts to monetize the car and raise cash, but take a loss on the car ( Hurts GAAP earnings)The Balance Sheet is overstated... the inventory is too high and only way to move cars quickly is to incent people. Tax credits are gone ( Ontario) or are dropping off quickly due to Tesla hitting 200K mark for US tax credits.., a perfect storm against Tesla profits.I would really appreciate others on this thread going out to their local Tesla store, look at Model 3 and S/X inventory available through the sales reps Tesla system ( just say you want a car within 2 weeks or so.. they’ll show you inventory)Also, I plan to keep watching for the first October production Model 3 to land in Toronto. Then, by asking enough customers when they ordered the Model 3, we can get a sense of whether Tesla is still filling backlog, or now filling very short term orders.Once I see only September or October orders being delivered, I know backlog is exhausted, then, by counting new deliveries per week we get a good sense of ongoing Model 3 demand. My intuition and the fact there are 33 inventory Model 3s in Toronto available for sale ( I could have one in 5 business days if I found one that I liked the combo of FWD/AWD, colour and wheels, I could have it by next Friday! ). That means either:1. Previous customers have walked away from their orders ( probably due to loss of Ontario tax credits)2. Tesla is keeping production numbers > actual demand and building inventory.., most people look at weekly production numbers and ASSUME that means that is equal to actual demand... what if Tesla now building cars in excess of actual orders ( like most car companies do).., big difference is Tesla does not have financial strength to play the inventory holding game!!!! Anyway, Canada and Toronto does not tell the whole picture. Dallas was a partial corroboration of my findings. If others can gather info from their local Tesla store ( take an hour or two o time), a bigger picture will emerge.I am a short via Puts. But I gather real data to confirm or refute my thesis. So far, my thesis about inventory seems to be on point!"
"J.P. Morgan reiterate TSLA ""underweight"" and a ------->$90<------- price target (up from $80)!!! They are attempting to manipulate the average price target by lowballing, this should be illegal."
"Shorts, y’all pretty quiet today. That’s ok, it will dip again, you’ll have a chance to talk $4/7 again, for a day, then back in the box you go."

Big reveal tomorrow
german market down and the dow going down...Tesla should be down around 10% today
I am long and these frequent pricecuts are worrying me. I was just thinking about this few days ago that if there is enough demand and they cut the prices many times in 2020 it should be enough for this year. We are in february and there is already another cut. I doubt they can make cars so much cheaper that they can make these frequent cuts.....
should i sell my shares that i bought for $400 that i bought 3 months ago?

"Cobalt prices ===== another $1,000 per unit disadvantage (*) (**) Like it or not Tesla is the high cost producer. If Cobalt prices continue to spike their disadvantage will eventually grow larger.1.) Tesla uses more Cobalt than other EV makers.2.) Tesla was unable to secure a long term contract with Ivanhoe Mines3.) Tesla does not offer a PHEV - a low cobalt alternative, 4.) GM is working on a battery chemistry with no Cobalt. 5.) All of the other ca makers sell millions of profitable vehicles and can sell EV s at a loss almost indefinitely. 6.) Tesla depends on EVs. January 2018 (((( When BMW AG revealed it was designing electric versions of its X3 SUV and Mini, the going rate for 21 kilograms of cobalt—the amount of the metal needed to power typical car batteries—was under $600. Only 16 months later, the price tag is approaching $1,700 and climbing by the day. ))))2018(( A big part of the GM plan is altering the chemistry of its EV batteries to eliminate cobalt, the most expensive component used in today’s batteries and one whose price on the world market is rising rapidly. ))(*) The actual cost disadvantage is unknown. The $1,000 figure comes from Bloomberg there is not way to verify it. (**) Most long term contracts provide for material cost increases. In the case of Panasonic and Tesla one of these parties has likely taken on the risk. If Panasonic offered Tesla a fixed price for the cells then Panasonic priced the risk into the cells. If there is a clause in the contract that allows Panasonic to pass along material price increases - then Tesla will pay more for the cells. Of course, either party can hedge Cobalt prices in the short term. Panasonic would have hedged Cobalt for the duration of the contract with Tesla. One way Panasonic might hedge the price of Cobalt would be with a long term contract with their suppliers. If Panasonic can contractually pass on price increases to Tesla based on commodity prices then Panasonic might go for a long term contract with their suppliers to get lower prices. And now Panasonic can increase prices to Tesla even though they are not paying more for Cobalt."

"Tesla shares trade on 100% emotion. It could go up 200 or down 200 next week. When you consider Tesla made more money in Bitcoin than selling cars, that should tell you this stock is massively overpriced."

Once supply returns, these stocks will return back to normal levels. 4) competition - sure, other companies are coming up. TSLA has been in the EV market selling cars for years. These newcomers have yet to prove themselves. How reliable are these new EVs if they just hit the streets? Tesla's been doing this for YEARS."

"Cowen just cut its $TSLA price target to $180 from $200 (and cut Q1 delivery estimates) while maintaining an ""Underperform“"
Futures are up. Tomorrow is going to be real short squeeze
Wassup my Tesla long !! Millions in the air
The next generation will be likely to see Elon Musk in a textbook. No more Henry Ford. You are all part of this success.
"bitcoin, Ethereum and Tesla is a good combination to be Millionaire"
CFO and CAO left.....

Out of my 365 puts on exp Friday. Thanks tweety bird.
Please ask ARK to buy some more.
"You guys have to stop valuing Tesla as just a car company. I agree from a auto manufacturing perspectives it’s overvalued but you have to think about Tesla’s other business lines and revenue streams (software and services, battery supply, robotaxis, stationary power, insurance). I’d say 30-40% of its current valuation is related to its car business. Not to mention that Tesla is light years ahead of other EV company and has gained not only marketshare share, but trust. I’m a CPA and have been studying fundamentals for nearly 20 years and this company is not even close to be fairly valued. Open your eyes to value and not short term pessimism. Tsla will probably go down a bit today due to yields, chip shortage, etc. but when things normalize, I hope you do you DD and realize the value in this company. God bless all bulls and shorts."
Tesla up 23.66 % after the 5 days of the new year. I like a stock that pays me money to do nothing.
"I am making a price target upgrade....$2,000 per share. TSLA will be taking over the entire world, quicker than competitors. The share price means nothing, just a number anybody is willing to pay to hold their money. It will forever go up, 100.00 per share every month for the rest of our lives. Once it reaches 810, the new target will be 910, etc. Sweet dreams everyone!"
Look at the bright side...their government subsidy collection business is going bananas!
"S&P inclusion, more factories being built, roadster, FSD, solar energy, Tesla DOJO, so much upside."
"There is another snow storm today in my area in the NE. There are already multiple snow storms in the last few weeks. It is too cold and snowing is piling up many feet. There is NO such ""global warming"" to make the weather warmer. The ""global warming"" is just a scam to deceive humanity to gain political advantage and financial gain."
TESLA
Only another 70% more to drop before getting close to fair value
"The existential threat Tesla faces on its vehicles business. GM,F,VW and many other legacy car makers are ""NOW"" making ""more popular"" and ""cheaper"" EVs. Some as cheap as $5000 USD (which GM's Wuling in China outsold Tesla Model 3 by over 2 to 1), and now GM also introduces the BOLT EV and EUV refreshed for 2021-22 US Market with 250miles the cars are as little as $23,000-$25,000USD (Incl. national rebate of $7,000; some states have an additional $2000) So a Tesla bull might say 'hey that doesn't count because the Tesla are more like $40,000 and that is only about 1/8! so less revenues! right !? wrong. THESE CARS ARE LIKE CELL PHONES! that's why EV is a Tech stock. Cheaper phones still have many of the features and functionality found on more expensive phones because the manufactures want to sell you apps, accessories and games! ... monthly paid subscriptions ... and those need to run on a fast Operating system. Low end EVs they ""WILL HAVE THE HARDWARE"" to run autopilot, in car services and possibly even FSD. Tesla's strategy was 'Top Down but maybe it should have been Top Down and Botton up, That's to late Tesla will never compete on the low and and that is where the mass market is, Tesla highlighted the $25,000 EV at battery day but are still years behind in making one. sorry but I'm probably correct."
How much Tesla could drop tomorrow ?
850 this week
"It is only a ""request"" not a demand that Tesla notify owners and dealers over the touchscreen issue going forward. THERE IS NO FORCED RECALL!"
"Full self-driving. I own a 2017 MX with FSD. I have the new computer chip and patiently await the next major update for the beta version. I have enjoyed being part of the adoption of updates over the last 3 plus years. One of my early posts here warning about the dangers of autopilot. Today every driver must still be 100% alert! I believe level 5 FSD arrives in 2024. Level 4 2022. I think there is still a lot to overcome, but the improvements over the last 3 years has been impressive."
((( Tesla Idles Model 3 Line at California Plant for Two Weeks ))) <<=== I told youModel 3 Sales were down ~ 35% in the USA. Model 3 sales were down ~ 9% in Europe.Tesla has slowed production at Fremont. Now they have completely shut down production of a Model 3 line for two weeks.BTW Tesla is not the only car company that is cutting production.
Nothing dramatic is happening in Frankfurt. Not good and not bad.
TSLA won’t drop low enough to make up the massive losses shorts have taken. VERY SAD
"Where is the TSLA SEMI being manufactured? Now that UPS has opted for RNG as clean transportation fuel, demand for electric SEMI is dwindling just as is the demand for TSLA passenger vehicles."
"There is no $35,000 Model 3. - >Over the last few months, Tesla’s prices have been almost constantly changing – especially when it comes to Model 3.The base version of the Model 3 at $35,000 was also put off-the-menu and can only be ordered by calling Tesla or going at the store.After the changes, the cheapest Model 3 available on Tesla’s website cost $39,500.<-Now Tesla has increased the price of all Model 3 vehicles by $400 – resulting in the cheapest listed Model 3 now costing $39,900.Questinatorhttps://electrek.co/2019/05/14/tesla-model-3-increases-price/"
Imagine Tesla sell their 3b in Bitcoin and do a share buy back.
"Great news is few shorts covered and very likely more joined in, I expect short % went up from 20 to 30%. Massive short covering is ahead in 2020."
"Scottish Mortgage Sells Tesla Shares Scottish Mortgage began to actively buy Tesla in 2013 when the share price was around $ 6. Today the share price exceeds $ 800. Thus, the stock was an absolutely phenomenal investment. According to The Guardian, SMT has generated approximately $ 30 billion in revenue from TSLA. PS. LOOKS LIKE THIS IS TIME TO SELL !!!"
"Hold the line shorts, we’re counting on you!"
I was right yesterday i should have waited. Unfortunately i didn't listen to my intuition and bought it yesterday for 704 :-(
"Tesla fleet size grows, insurance companies are starting to see more meaningful data on which they can base their underwriting decisions.The early signs are not good for Tesla. Periodically, there have been complaints of customers unable to get reasonably priced insurance. The problem was particularly acute in Asia where Tesla ended up offering its own insurance.Tesla's insurance problems may have taken a very sharp downward turn recently. As of 02/18/2017, Hartford Auto Insurance not allowing Any Model Tesla be written as new business or added to an existing policy in the states of CT, FL, KY, MD, ME, OH, TX, and WV.Is it a big deal with just a single insurance company not insuring especially in relatively small markets? After all, California is the biggest market and there seem to be no problems there yet?The answer is that insurance companies tend to work from similar sets of data and if one insurer takes a specific action, the odds are extremely high that several others will follow.Hartford is a leading indicator in this regard as the company tends to attract the higher value auto buyers. It is very likely that many others will follow Hartford, and possibly very soon."
It's about time this stock put a little scare on investors. It's been a little too easy for a long time.
Surely with the stock price drop a few shorts could afford a Model 3 by now.
"Again, I don't get the logic of Elon Musk? If you have a great, immediate need, for auto trailers/haulers, why wouldn't you buy commercially available ones to fill that need? For the sake of speed, at least initially, wouldn't that be the smart way to attack such a shipping need? But no, build your own, because............????????"
APPLE + iCar = Tesla's Tomb
"Keeping on Shorting $TSLA to your detriment... I live in Germany, where the so-called big boys in the Auto sector are - they have no infrastructure for EVs, and they are in a panic mood."
"I reviewed the ""investors"" section of the Tesla Motors Club site. It was like finding the juvenile fiction section of the library. There were all sorts of fantasies about factories in far off lands, world domination of half a dozen industries and worship of a god."
" Oh Good Lord; Ya see NIO's News?$1,08 Billion in sales And up 10% sinceThe market started tanking. HERE's thePrint of Pre market NIO - NIO Inc.NYSE - NYSE Delayed Price. Currency in USD7.467.85+0.39 (+4.62%) realtime 9:12 am ET"
"So for every share you buy for $844 Tesla makes $29 in revenue, and 2% of that is profit, seems like a real good deal"
if the price goes down couple hundred more points just wait for the law suits from pension funds.
Tesla is more than gold. It is the fastest money machine that has ever existed. Buy buy buy. The stock continues to run.
"BOMBSHELL: Tesla's EV Range Isn't All It's Cracked Up to Be, Edmunds Says -- Barrons1:56 PM ET 2/10/2021 Automotive data provider Edmunds tested a bevy of electric vehicles, comparing the range achieved against the EPA estimated range. The results, for auto makers, were pretty good -- unless you were Tesla.Fifteen EVs were tested, and just four auto makers made it into the 300-mile-on-a-single-charge club: Ford Motor(F) , Hyundai Motor(HYMLF) , Porsche Automobil Holding (PAH3.Germany), and Tesla (TSLA). Having Tesla on the list isn't the surprise to investors. The EV pioneer has been building EVs for more than a decade, and the company boasted about breaking the 400-mile-per-charge barrier this past June.The surprise is how poorly Tesla vehicles performed compared with EPA estimated ranges. ""Every Tesla we've tested has failed to hit its EPA range estimate,"" reads the Edmund's press release.Tesla and Edmunds weren't immediately available to comment on the findings.A Tesla 2018 Model 3 performance edition was supposed to get 310 miles a charge. Edmunds got 256 miles. A 2020 Model 3 standard range was supposed to get a range of 250 miles. Edmunds got 232 miles. A 2020 Tesla Model X long range was supposed to get 328 miles. Edmunds got 294 miles. A 2020 Tesla Model Y performance configuration was supposed to get 291 miles of range. Edmunds got 263 miles.Edmunds got 318 miles of range from the Tesla 2020 Model S performance vehicle tested. That's the model that put Tesla in the 300-mile range club. The EPA estimated range for that vehicle is 326 miles of range on a single charge.Tesla vehicles tested, on average, scored about 9% worse than predicted range. The other 10 EVs beat expected range by an average of about 19%."
"Happily ""bag-holding"" $TSLA since 2013. Will ""bag-hold"" 'til $6000 and then reassess position."
TESLA IS GOING TO THE MOON TODAY BOYS AND GIRLS. THINK NEW ALL TIME HIGHS. ELON IS THE VOICE OF THE PPL AND TESLA IS ELON INK STAY LONG. THEY WILL DOUBLE SALES THIS YEAR WITH NEW FACTORIES PRODUCTS AND MARKETS THEY ARE ENTERING. FULL SELF DRIVE WILL BE REVOLUTIONARY!!!!

What was Elon doing at the factory 3-4 days straight without sleeping or going outside? Is he working on the assembly line building Tesla’s?!?!
"This will be in the low 600s by end of next week...missed delivery expectations of Ives by 10K which fueled a large part of last week’s increase, Jan 5th dems will win both seats which Wall Street doesn’t expect, vaccine rollout is a joke and is going to take much longer than expected....."

How does this pos niche stock continue to defy gravity?
wait till ABNB starts trading. This will tank again.
"I like what Tesla is doing with AI, automation, solar energy and EV. But the parabolic move is due for a pullback. Anyone know what is a good entry point to start? I have no position on TSLA."
Tesla strong and long. Loud and proud. Burning shorts today.
TSLA had its day. its won 80% of its coin flips and killed a lot of shorts. Serious question--how long do you LONGS think you can win? You understand eventually some of you wise up and TAKE PROFITS and sit out and rebuy the TSLA company at a much lower price point. TESLA is not like a real estate piece of land that just goes up and up. its a company that has to MAKE MONEY and it is not very good at doing that. it barely eked out 500K cars. SAD
"Potter actually said ""It's becoming clear, in our view, that TSLA is on a path toward becoming the world's only relevant publicly-listed auto maker"".I am shocked that one could say this. It's unfathomable. He thinks TSLA is poised for complete world domination after a poor quarter with miniscule profits fueled by carbon credits."
"When I had 50% of my retirement (SEP IRA) last year in TSLA, everyone said I was crazy. Now it is over 85% and holding and going strong. Waiting for it to hit the $1000 level. Keep buying and be rewarded."
LONG LIVE TESLA!!!!
"Read a couple of articles on the DrudgeReport earlier today. One article was about how this (& other) cities in CA (where else) that are banning any future gas stations from being built in their city limits as EV cars are the wave of the future, so they figured there were already enough gas stations. In the other article and in several other articles, I read about how EV and ICE car production is down. They expected between 500K and 1M less new cars to be produced because of the shortage of electronic components. So I looked at a couple of electronic component manufactures, expecting to see their stock booming (supply & demand). Nope, they were struggling too.It's either gonna be a brave new world... or just a return to the old days when I rode a motorcycle."
Why are so many comment negative? Any one notice China massive numbers for 2020
People... Does anyone know a guy that goes by the name of @NinjaSwinger? Complete NIO fannatic... He always writes how he hates Tesla... Does anyone know what is his story?
"With markets making huge gains currently and $NIO consolidating near $55-60 USD range, it is a perfect time to load up on shares. The lowest price target is $100 by analyst, while the median is roughly $400. Stocks do not go up everyday even the best ones. So for those paper hands worried about a stock up %2000 percent not moving right now, you clearly are speculating, not investing. Myself and other investors will make a lot of money long term because we are patient. I don't like to mention $TSLA, but they struggled early on as well and was being shorted to fail. This stock is $100 EOY, be patient and buy more on dips."
"Every 10,000 cars sold and paid with Bitcoin at $60,000 per car TSLA will increase $600,000,000.00 and Bitcoin. If the stock market crashed, TSLA will be with a lot of cash, and what will happen with the others car manufacturers?I guess we will be more than 3 years ahead "
Saw this article Trump plans1) Trump pledges to rip up Paris climate agreement in energy speech2) Trump railed against “draconian climate rules”3) Trump said he would “cancel” the Paris climate agreement –4) and withdraw any funding for United Nations programs related to global warming.
Who predicted 700 close today?
Palihapitiya’s opinion on Tesla stock? “Don’t sell a share.” Will double or triple
"One of two things are going to happen between the 18th and the 21st for the S&P Index funds, the fund managers are going to wait til after the 18th in the after market to start buying due to everyone selling off the stock, thus they buy in cheap. Or, they will buy in on Monday pre market opening when the prices are cheaper... The week of the 21st I expect at least an additional 5% rise before the correction later in the week..."
"Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained his Neutral rating on Tesla (TSLA) stock despite the price target increase. His new bullish scenario target stands at $1,250, a 25% increase"
"“Mars, here we come!!” he tweeted. Musk called it a “successful ascent” and said the body flaps precisely guided the rocket to the landing point. The fuel tank pressure was low, however, when the engines reignited for touchdown, which caused Starship to come down too fast.“But we got all the data we needed!” he tweeted. Musk had kept expectations low, cautioning earlier this week there was “probably” 1-in-3 chance of complete success."
Ok it is going higher.But how much higher?Until when this will keep going higher and higher?It has 800 bilion dollar market cap right now.How much is the fair valuation on your opinion?
"Tesla analyst more than doubles stock price target to $1,036"
Fed caused this market . in the head of every investors now theres feds actions hiking rates and triggering crisis. trump must stop them now unless they all in the same boat lol
TESLA WILL DOUBLE SALES DOUBLE STOCK PRICE AND DOUBLE FACTORIES AND DOUBLE BALANCE SHEET THIS YEAR BUY THE DIP

"Hey shorties, if you short sold earlier, it's time to cover now. Isn't your motto: sell high and cover higher?"

"LOL, one more for the Longs.."
Teslarati informs that Tesla in January produced less than 11% of EVs . This long way to go to become the only EV manufacturer in the world
$818. Fading after dead cat bounce.
"Every $100 level, TSLA gets a new group of shorts thinking they will be the special ones who will win in TSLA. Every group uses the same arguments as the previous group, and are oblivious to doing so. You got to see the world how it is, not how you think it is; not realizing this is their flaw."
Buy Buy Buy Please keep it going.2000.00You can buy 3 more shares.
Will be under $100 before long. Too many EV cos out there. You can start calling Ford and GM Ev cos now. Good luck to those who bought the story because that's all it is
The TSLA stock id trading at $657.21 in premarket. The price will escalate.
"He who has receives and from him who has not, even what he seems to have will be taken away. Elon Musk is the richest man in the world because he deserves it. He is a true Visionary and unlike most, dares to believe in himself, and sets about, against all odds, to make the world a better place. In this particular case, as the world stands on the brink of destruction makes the world a more habitable place. Now TSLA is on the way to a 2 Trillion dollar company, and why not, AAPL needs some company at the top with someone who has creative inspiration. Tim Cook is no Steve Jobs, but Elon Musk is blazing a new trail which has no peer. The kind of Man that's capable to lead the colonization of Mars."

"Short squeeze intact, a slow bleed short squeeze for now. May get worse. But you longs know that this valuation is BS, and that eventually the shorts are going to win the war. The company is hanging on by strings. Longs. enjoy your ""Battle of the Bulge"" and be sure to place stops to protect some profit.I covered again at $366, but I will always be here to re-enter short- as will EVERY other short that covers. The BS will end someday soon."
They sell massively overpriced stock to pay down debt. What does that tell you?
TSLA is not worth more than Honda Motors standalone $50B much less $800B....that's another -90% loss in the cards...will it happen this year..not sure but regardless TSLA has peaked and now will be searching for a bottom!!!
"Another Tesla competitor (we don't need a killer), VW will start making an ID.5 electric SUV 'coupe' later in 2021. Elon Cesar Musk, the time for honoring yourself will soon be at an end, highness. But wait! None of these have Tesla's FSD! (Guess what? Neither do, nor will, Teslas)."
Alright Tesla we are going to 1000 this month let’s go fam 
Tesla fourth-quarter registrations in California jump 63%: data
this is September post-split all over again. exciting times.
Bears ... I’m still waiting on that $70-$200 price target that you claimed for the last few days...
"Bond yields are starting to rise. Few more points of increase and the stocks correction is inevitable even with the money printers on full speed.After many months. I am peaceful finally, shorting Tesla. This was a painful ride but 2021 is making it visibly clear how competition is catching up. I did not guess that obvious information has to be spoon fed to longs here. Sleep well shorts. No more elasticity left stocks. More and more people are seeing the risks in equities and more are moving to bonds"
A new Model 3 is said to have a range of ~300 miles in ideal conditions with a fully charged brand new battery pack. However the capacity of the battery declines with repeated charging. The question is how many miles will the car be in service before the expensive battery has to be replaced. Does it make economic or environmental sense?
STAY LONG BIG THINGS COMING THIS YEAR CYBER TRUCK AND FULL SELF DRIVE EVENTS WILL BE EPIC AS WELL AS UPCOMING EARNINGS CALL IN FEB>>>STAY LONG BOYS AND GIRLS TESLA IS THE CHOSEN ONE
I’m still waiting for $280
A new use for the $10 Billion they raised. Buy there our cars and show how they sold out!! Then just remelt them and do it again. Sales so good raise another $10 billion rinse and repeat. That’s should keep it going for another couple years and 2 Trillion market value better at selling stock than building and buying cars
Tesla will make up 2% of the S&P fund. That’s 100 billion dollars in action that’s going to have to be done to include the Tesla stock into the S&P 500. GLTA 
The Ark investment in bitcoin and TSLA and TSLA's investment in bitcoin reminds me of the Japanese stock market bubble where interconnected buying was a major driver of the bubble.

"if bitcoin falls to $20k, Musk should personally buy 100 billion dollars worth, and have Tesla buy 200 billion worth. That literally would be over 50% of the bitcoin supply and would give Tesla huge leverage."
"1 trillion tech company, Elon Musk the richest man guarantee. TSLA 1,000$ per share done, there might be a drop in between before it hits 1,000$. the only thing 600% again in a year ??? 200% 300% yes. 600% i dont think so"
Tesla call buyers.
I went to a $TSLA store over the weekend. The company offered me $10k off a Model 3 if I bought it that day! @squawkcnbc
"If you cultists think this is bad, wait until it crosses below 100 a share on its final descent to single digits.This is exactly why retail investors always end up losing all their money in stock bubbles. They thought they were geniuses in the way up, and refuse to believe the party is over."

LETS GET GREEN TODAY!!
"I don’t know if shorts and analysts that are skeptical to TSLA actually own Tesla cars or solar at home, I bought a 3 and traded for an X, on order for a Y waiting for refreshers to take effect and the tri-motor cyber truck along with solar on my two homes. TSLA is way ahead on many ways, I am long because I love their products, started low and continue investing, less than 300k now worths 2M, I’m not selling unless other company beats TSLA Products (Cars, semi, autonomous, supercharger network, solar energy, energy storage)"
I sold today on $ 665. I was to be carefull. I could have $ 30 a stock more 21 = $ 630.
"With people ignoring Demand supply ( Elon launching Standard range after saying it not worth as range is just <250 mile) is clearly problem on Demand side Tesla seeing.Market can celebrate but more they ignore bad news and valuation worst outcome at end. May be I won't benefit and lose $100K at end but I am not worried about that. I may not good at making money but I know how to recover once go in loss. It take month or two but will recover it. Lot of people will not able to. Once recover I get more greedy and get stuck eventually. Eventually I will learn how to control my greed. If I started with $2k risk and double down as it go up I would much better shape. Not saying I won't recover. This stock going 50 up daily. If it just go down 75 in 1 week, I will in profit."

This is TESLA!!!"
I just love the stock and company so i bought more
"First, I'm not long or short TSLA and don't own any options. Based on any fundamental indicator, the stock is way overvalued and their market is starting to get a lot more crowded. The biggest short-term issue TSLA longs have is tied to investors with ""like investments"". If you took a poll of TSLA longs, I expect you'd find a large % of them are heavily weighted in digital currency, SPACs and trade on margin. A hard drop in a portfolio heavily weighted in high risk investments that is leveraged equals % drops at a much bigger multiple to the overall market and margin calls. MACD has recently broken down on many of the momo stocks including TSLA along with MFI (ie institutions and hedge funds are selling). March could be a really tough month for the heavily leveraged, high-risk investor. On the bright side, short-term, sharp corrections create opportunities. Happy trading everyone!"
Building an EV factory-like Tesla's Giga factory is easy you say. hehehe Let's see Apple build one with its car company partner. hehehe
"Don't get too excited for tomorrow based on the last few minutes of trading.... The whole market moved up at the same time, not just Tesla."
"TSLA's cutting prices on all models won't work as it loses the brand value - instead, they have to come up with another technology-driven model. EV, autonomous tech, lidar are all commoditised.If I were Musk, I would look for exit strategy before the bubble pops."
"FUTURES GREEN and HIGH, I am buying TSLA at whatever price and accumulate if pulldown. The more we buy , the more explosive become to burst the short squeeze. I see 1200 breakout coming. Juts keep buying and holding. Don't ever sell. Buy more that's the secret. hegdies game ended tonite."
"Not a bad day , small loss , did recover from day trading at nio. Keeping tesla bby for long."
Do You Like being reminded?Nearly $40 billion in losses for short-sellers in 2020.
"Fanboys surely remember Sandy Munroe promoting Tesla tech. He threatened to sue a twitter TSLAQ detractor who claimed he wasn't impartial. Today, he admits to investing in TSLA, buying $22K and selling recently at $170K. Strangest is claiming, ""I made so much money"". I guess that is a lot in Detroit where the profits could buy 6 houses, but barely pay for an outhouse in California.

"Tesla owners hop around the country Supercharger to Supercharger. Only using other network’s systems if they have to. Why? They’re faster charging, convenient, cheaper, better maintained and dependable. Glad the others are out there and improving. The best of all are the Tesla owner’s own rooftop solar. Supercharger stations (and others) are growing in numbers faster than gas stations ever did."
"Now $675. High recently was $900. $675/$900 = 75%. So a 25% correction in short order. Enough to create a floor? We shall see but when you factor in recent split, it could just be the beginning. When momentum stocks stop going up, then buyers are scarce as most were just in it for the momentum. Could easily drop another 25% in short order."

"This really can't be good,....tesla's order conversion rate is 8%,.... Less than the 10 or 12% I suggested a week or so ago applying similar logic.. (I saw this link on my cell phone earlier today. Hat tip to whoever posted it then.)tesla had been slowly inviting reservation holders to configure and order their Model 3 vehicles in waves, based on factors like ownership status and geographical location. The company invited all reservation holders to order in late June, which would seemingly open a floodgate of new orders. Just yesterday, the company abandoned its reservation system altogether, and anyone in North America is now welcome to configure and order a Model 3 -- no reservation required.The timing of those events strongly suggests that order conversion rates among Model 3 reservation holders is rather poor, since if a significant proportion of reservation holders were placing orders, Tesla would already have its work cut out to produce and deliver those orders. Tesla still has approximately 420,000 Model 3 reservations.Responding to criticism about cutting off an analyst during a recent earnings call, CEO Elon Musk had said that it would take Tesla two years to ""satisfy existing demand.""But that would require a 100% order conversion rate, and Musk tends to incorrectly equate reservations (with refundable deposits) with sales. Customer deposits represented a third of Tesla's cash position at the end of the first quarter. The answer to RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak's question on Model 3 order conversion rates is of utmost concern to investors right about now, but only Tesla has that information and Musk refuses to share it.The evidence is mounting Last month, Second Measure Research estimated that the order conversion rate was a mere 8%. https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/07/11/walk-ins-welcome-anyone-can-now-order-a-tesla-mode.aspx"
will close at 620
"As I said yesterday, TSLA will be fine, no big drop today. Elon is planning to take action new product revenue this year like Solar, Battery Storage, EV shipping truck, Rob taxi, Pickup delivery etc."
"Goldman and MS will now restore coverage of Tesla-with their current sell ratings and targets pf 180. But longs will say that is good news. Expect Musk to say ""profitable.good cash flow and do not need cash"" at least 10 times in next week."
Question: what prevents people from creating another Bitcoin? Nothing. Going down to zero.
Lol this EV joke is still at $600. Should be below $100 for it to be valued fairly compared to other automakers. You should buy oil companies - WAY undervalued. EV joke should end in 2021.
"Tesla is also unusual in the way it reports some of its key financial metrics. When calculating gross margins — the sales price of a car minus the direct costs of manufacturing — traditional carmakers include research, development and engineering costs. Tesla does not, which tends to make its margins look better."
The Tesla bubble is finally popping. Soon to be under $100 (still too high) and kicked out of the S&P 500. Buy $XLE and $OXY now while you can.

"Careful, momentum traders, momentum is a two-way street and it's always faster on the downside of the street than the upside. There always comes a ""the king has no clothes"" moment, and the fact that TSLA has gone hyperbolic is a sign that moment may not be very far off. And the Greater Fool Theory (""I realize this is nonsense but I'll follow the trend and get out when it turns"") does not work very well in practice."
"Tech sector is down , not just ev.. so no real worries"

"Today I was researching about Tesla competitors. Sure all car companies are starting to provide dates to which their all EV prototypes will be available but none of them as FSD capability and all of them have to redesign their manufacturing buildings which will cost them so much money. Plus they still need to support all their ICE vehicles for a while. As an example, Ford who are still making ICE vehicles, let say they stop producing them in 2026. So the last cars they sold in 2026 need to get support (parts manufactured) for at least 10 years. This is ONE of the reason why Tesla is so far ahead. Tesla has no ICE vehicle to support, they do not need to restructure their factory buildings.If Tesla is well managed they will be ahead of competitors for very long time."
"222 million shares traded, and TSLA only goes up 6%? Obviously not chump change, but far less than the sycophants predicted. Even I am disappointed, as I want as high a short entry point (Tuesday morning) as possible. Perhaps another 5% on Monday, then the long painful (for some) slide begins. If you (Tesla) want be be included amongst the big boys, be prepared to be judged (valued) as one."

"You should never expect declines day in, day out. After so many days of intense sell-off it is quite normal to see jumps. Some of these jumps are a change of trajectory (when underlying conditions of the stock improve, with positive news on company's performance, etc) , but in some cases these jumps are just short-term illusions for long term holders, with further declines to come."

"an analyst moved his target from 500 to 1200 yesterday. thats manipulation and (should be) criminal. EVERYBODY with common sense knows, that Tesla will not be a monopolyking over EVs in the future. And yes, Europe is being taken over by the real carmakers now. Theres loads of good evcars coming in the coming months and tesla will have a market share of 5-10% in the future. oh, and by the way, they still dont make any money on it. :)"
Trying to play the rise of Bitcoin in the coming years through TSLA is not advisable. Play the rise of Bitcoin through $GBTC . Good liquidity. Low cost. Buy. Hold. Chill.

Meanwhile, Tesla with millions of smart cars on the road already collecting billions of miles of data. Relax. EV manufacturing just a launching point for Tesla. The future is bright"

"Netherlands Q4 2019 = 29,922 Model 3s soldNetherlands Q4 2020 = 3,967 Model 3s sold <<<=== 86% decline, even though Tesla cut prices"
"In the latest delivery report released on Thursday, Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) beat most analysts' delivery estimates by handing ownership over to about 88,400 customers in Q1 (Form 8-K filing is here). This was, as expected, a record for any 1st quarter. It easily beat 1Q19 since Model 3 deliveries did not begin in Europe and China until mid-February last year, so Tesla's numbers benefited this year from worldwide deliveries of Model 3 for the entire month of January and early February.However, the ratio of vehicles built versus delivered in the quarter was the worst since 1Q19. While Tesla indeed delivered 88,400 units, it represented 86% of the total production of 102,672 vehicles resulting in a surplus of 14,272 units. Combined with excess inventory from prior quarters, Tesla's unsold inventory spiked to 26,961 units, an increase of 112% from 4Q19.First, we can see the huge increase in unsold units that soared 120%. Part of this increase occurred in China in Jan/Feb where Model 3 deliveries were 83% of production (5,487 deliveries vs. 6,583 units produced. We are still a few weeks away from verifiable March numbers). Europe also appears to have ended with a large surplus inventory. During the quarter, seven ships transported units to Zeebrugge, Belgium with a few continuing on to Southampton, England. TeslaMotorsClub.com member Troy does an excellent job of pulling verifiable data together to track most European sales. For Q1, his spreadsheet (here) shows 22,728 deliveries which are almost identical to 2019 at 22,759. Norway and The Netherlands have been replaced in the top spot by the U.K. This may not account for other smaller EU markets. But if each ship carried an average of 4,000 Tesla vehicles, we can see that a good portion of these unsold units is probably sitting in Europe, waiting to be delivered to buyers in Q2 due to the coronavirus shutdowns in many of those countries.Second, in the press release last week, Tesla oddly chose to combine Model 3 with Model Y production and delivery figures. Some would think they did this to hide relatively low figures for Model Y out the gate. But if we look back to 3Q17, in the above chart, Tesla had no problem reporting just a few hundred cars in Model 3's initial quarter. It would seem Tesla is actually trying to mask the severe drop in Model 3 global sales which were the worst in a year since Q1 2019. That number last year was unusually low for several reasons. First, 4Q18 marked the end of the full $7,500 FITC in the U.S. which pulled Q1 sales forward into Q4. Second, Model 3 deliveries in both China and Europe did not begin until about halfway through the quarter in mid-February. This, of course, made 1Q20 deliveries look better in a YoY comparison.It has been and still is my belief that moving the introduction of the Model Y forward to March from later in the year was due to the slowing of orders for the Model 3 and to fill a drop in revenue that Tesla has known was coming in the first half of 2020. This became very clear last year when total U.S. revenue dropped $2.2 billion from 2018 levels."

"Analysts are starting to realize that the higher TSLA stock price, the easier TSLA can fund its growth, and the more valuable it should be. But the other virtuous cycle they haven't considered is that people who buy TSLA stock will buy TSLA cars, and the higher the stock, the easier they are able to afford the car."

"Musk is making up stories again, this time about being weeks away from closing its doors. If this were really true, Tesla would have been required to notify shareholders and potential shareholders since that would have been materially relevant information. Since there was no 8k filed with the SEC, it is not true. Oh wait, there is one more option: Tesla has committed fraud again."

"Other auto companies are unionized, they are done, Tesla has the auto market, everyone knows it, this isn’t about auto anymore, hasn’t been for awhile, 1tril market cap isn’t based on auto duh! Elon can now enter any industry he wants, hire all the smartest people in that particular industry, and conquer it, and when he does the market cap will go up and give him more money to enter and conquer another industry. People who say this can’t be justified by the autos they make are totally missing the point. He will crush many industries by outbidding all competitors for skill. I stopped shorting when I realized this a few months ago after losing a painful amount of money. I wish I had the balls to actually buy in right now because I believe Tesla is only getting started but I can’t bring myself to it."

A lot of the REE stocks are starting to move off of a decade long bottom. Might be worth a little look."

I made $200K profit with help I received from Kyle_harrison on telegr:m he is the best signal trader I have seen.
"At what point does Elon announce a new, largest ever, share offering? I'm thinking Elon wants to convert bubble money (e.g. the stock price) into real money. I'm thinking he wants to raise at least $100 billion in cash. It is very, very accretive to the company, if he does so. The only issue is that he doesn't want to crash the stock. He has to nurture the bubble. I'm guessing he will make some kind of an announcement regarding new secondary offerings at the earnings report."
Investors just realized the recall news was from June 24th of LAST YEAR!Tesla now going green before $1.5 Trillion stimulus announcement and 4Q earnings coming up!

The companies recently unveiled the 10th discovery on their jointly held acreage position, which they now believe contains more than 5 billion barrels of recoverable oil."

Guys l guess there is nothing we can do much but to wait until next Tuesday AH. It’s the 4th quarter earnings and l expect it will blow all expectations away. Then we will properly see 900. Fingers crossed and sit tide. I myself invested twice and average at 840. Hopefully it will turn around after next Tuesday.

This minor burst could be a blessing."
"Margin requirement for puts went from 35% wed, 50% today and now 60% for tomorrow. Apparently my brokerage thinks Tesla is going to crash."
"Anyone should be able to appreciate the incredible irony in having TSLA added to the S&P 500 at this particular time. Fund managers who are being forced to purchase a large cap stock that is vastly overvalued by any GAAP metric, will also be forced to hold the stock, no matter how poorly it performs after its inclusion in the index!Should be interesting."
It is hard to believe that someone is still buying $TSLA BUBBLE at that INSANE VALUATION! The stock price is up by 4000% in a single year FOR NO REASON!
There were elderly people who invested in Tesla bonds. sad...hopefully Musk will do jail time.

"Tesla, with the help of Dear Leader Xi has taken out Alibaba! Facebook is next!"
Instead of talking smack be grateful if you made the gains and let it be a teaching moment if not. NOBODY can predict the market. I am way up in mine but as an honest and real person I've made mistakes in the past and lost. Anyone who says they have not is a liar. So kudos for the gainers and hopefully in next dip some can buy back in.It's funny reading here......I'm probably only one of a couple women here with a voice of reason. But I can tell you this.....I have a fantastic time visualizing in my head the smack talkers.......what they look like behind their worn out keyboards in real life........its very entertaining. Good luck to all. Don't be a dork

"I have a bad feeling that musk and his software team have figured out the "" autonomous stock trading software ""and if you use bitcoin as the funding machine you could push/pull stock prices all day and all week long... if you are working 2 mill stock then you can make quite a lot of money every single day on $20 swings.... and nobody can track the funding... its like the invisible man and his own private bank playing hide the money game..."
Up or down after earnings???
"This bitcoin buying is utter nonsense....you don't need to own it to accept payments in it...TSLA could then sell them immediately on the open market....instead he's tied up $1.5 billion in capital that could have gone to R+D, which is about the amount TSLA spent on it last year. Some of his competitors spend 5-10 times as much as TSLA on R+D...and we're supposed to think they won't catch up?? This is a dual red flag on two of the biggest bubbles around."
So what happens on Monday when it’s been added to the S&P? What to expect?
"it's always been about the valuation... Longs have laughed all this time because it continues to remain up there... but shorts have always know the current situation would be the actual outcome... at best it's a niche auto company worth 1/5th or less it's current SP... that is $50... I've frequently stated $46 and I hold to that. that's the best case scenario... and now Elon will attempt to milk the last dream to hold this stock up... fully autonomous electric robots taking over the world... (yes... this is what I've always meant by ""robots""... i never gave a s... about the factory automation)let this be clear... there will be zero personal transportation vehicles on the road without a driver for many many years... so how do you value this company while factoring that in?... 63k in a quarter while it's competitors do millions per quarter... it just continues to be the most ridiculously overvalued company that's ever existed. it will end abruptly."
$1500 it's easy
The 2nd time closing above $850. Can't be upset at that! Congrats longs!
"in a normal market, many tech stocks and high risk assets would be getting sold off. more and more people are losing their jobs. i basically don't buy anything except the essentials. I dont know anyone who is buying a new EV"
"A civil war should send this to $1,000 easy"
"Elon Musk said Tesla was overvalued at $1000 a share pre-split last year. Now it's over 4x that. I do believe Tesla makes just amazing cars, but this valuation is approaching insanity."
Has anyone thought into the future and not just beyond yesterday and today? This conversation was had 2 years Ago and Look how many ships have sailed
ICE car makers will be selling EVs at a loss. They’re cannibalizing their own high margin sales and inefficiently building EVs on ice car manufacturing lines. DOOMED.
Mustang Mach E and VW ID4 are going to take big chunks of Tesla market share. But don't worry longs. Fundamentals don't matter to Tesla. Also all those analysts pushing Tesla - they are lying to you and/or trying to get in on the next capital raise required for this cash incinerating company.
So Musk had a choice: A) Invest $500M in Tesla stock buy-back. B) Invest $500M in Bitcoin. He chose B. He clearly believes Bitcoin is a better investment than Tesla stock. (Let's not even talk about why Tesla is not using that cash for R&D or to build new factories.)

"An unbelievable growth company sitting under your nose and most can't see it! Tesla haters keep comparing it to car manufacturers and no clear vision to see whats around the corner. All antiquated ideas, you need to look at the big picture. No matter how many new EV's are rolled out by ICE manufacturers, Tesla stll delivered 500,000 units and has 3 billion miles worth of Autonomous driving data. In a time where data is king, ask yourself this, how many more billion miles worth of data will Tesla have by the time ICE manufacturers catch up to Tesla's deliveries of 500k units? Now ask yourself this, with 3 new manufacturing plants coming live for Tesla, 1 in Germany, 1 in Texas and 1 in India, how many more units will Tesla deliver over its competition? Now look at the expense structure for both manufacturers, Tesla doesn't have a combustion engine division that needs to phase out. Tesla also is on its way to manufacturing its own battery and already produces its autonomous driving chip. It alsi does not have contracts and licenses with dealer franchises. Tesla sells and services direct to the customer, doesn't have to change its eco system, who will be more profitable? They will easily dominate the industry and i didn't even mention semi trucks and the home solar roof division!"
"Apr 2019: ""Elon Musk Promises 'Over a Million' Tesla Robotaxis by the End of 2020""and Ark based most of their ""$4000 price target"" madness on robotaxis. So basically, the only thing that actually happened was the share price went up."
"""Tesla has scheduled a Battery & Powertrain Investor Day in 2020, and some suspect that this will be the occasion for a momentous announcement. Elon Musk has hinted that there are a couple of new tech-related goodies in the pipeline, and some Tesla-watchers believe, based on the prices announced for the Cybertruck and Model Y, that Tesla could be sitting on a substantial battery advance. Tesla’s vehicles already have enough range (and way more than enough performance) to satisfy most buyers, so any increase in battery capacity could translate to lower prices - and many more potential sales."""

To all the haters of Tesla lets hear your bright stock picks
tesla cuts production of model s for 18 days.
"For those who believe that $TSLA is a profitable company: (simple accounting method)1. GOOD accounting practice aka conservative approach (all the auto companies):- Expense all the items via COGS & SG&A that are related to a company's sale including cash reserve for recall/malfunction parts/warranty claims proper calculation on depreciation for manufacturing arms/machines/old model parts write down receivables that are 90 days old or on repo/collection status set aside legal expenses associated with claims from vendors/customers/governments2. BAD accounting practice aka aggressive approach ($TSLA, start up/tech companies):- DO NOT expense the items on #1 and capitalize them by putting them in assets as ""CAPEX - Capital Expenditure""- Once a stock price gets super high, write off bad debts/old model parts/warranty claims as ""one-time"" charge as they are not related the ""current"" production line.- Raising Billions of dollars to inflate the balance sheet via stock sales which don't show up on liability section- Start adding non-related business/investment into the company so it confuses the company's shareholders, analysts, accountants and regulators.Which one has the long term value? You don't need an accounting degree to answer this."
"the dog whistle of the shorter / Elon haters. "" It's just a car company "" well no it's not but besides that whole discussion Elons EV margin is 20% plus and the ICE car companies is like 2%. so should we say Tesla has actual much more profitable than them ?"

"I will start by saying we own a Tesla and I think electric cars are the future. But Tesla's valuation is in the ""meth'ed out sailor on shore leave"" level of money. It's pure stupidity. A PE of almost 1100. A valuation more than the ten largest auto manufacturers on the planet COMBINED even though they sell ~22 million cars a year and Tesla struggles to sell 500,000?Half their main assembly line is in a tent in their factory parking lot. They've had the market all to themselves until now because they sold so few cars to early adopters like me the big 10 didn't care, but that is no longer the case. The big 10 have collectively announced more than 23 billion on electric car R&D in the next 24 months.Tesla has spent a little over 2 billion on R&D TOTAL in the 17 years it's been in existence. Ford alone will spend 5 billion in the next year alone on electric car R&D. Point is, Tesla isn't doing anything the big 10 won't be doing in the next 24 months (or aren't already doing) and Tesla us future priced in now till about 2040, and that isn't going to last."

I bought 120 shares right after the split in Aug @ 411.20 I sold it @ 849.49 on Feb 9th. I'm glad I did. I will see where it level out at and maybe get back in. Late Jan I read Musk was going to stop production so that didn't set well with me. I bailed.

"Thanks! Bulls, the surge this morning got me another $2k per short Jan 2022 exp. $1700 strike calls.Why don't you sell your TSLA stock and put it into these calls? If TSLA is going up to $5000, seems like a smart move. Get 8 calls for the price of 100 shares. When TSLA reaches $5000 in a few months, you will have a profit of more than $3300 per share on 800 shares (instead of just 100 $5000 shares).Smart move, right?"
all the people with the instant testing think they will get out of this in time... no one will buy.. you get stuck.
Come on guys. We are comparing apples and oranges here. Apple makes great gadgets. I’m sure they can partner and make an EV but Tesla is too far ahead in this game. Tesla is not simply a car company. They are well established and keep improving yearly. Rumors are nothing but rumors. Nice try Apple.
Wowed. Below 790. Got in too early.

"Man, the bears come out in droves when they smell fresh meat!! TSLA will rebound as always. Look at this as a buying opportunity as long as you avg. down. I’m more concerned about the market in general. I keep hearing that a crash is coming later in the year."

"Another testament to this crazy EV valuation - Michael Burry, “The Big Short” famous for his prescient bet against the U.S. housing market, announced in early December that he was shorting Tesla. Check out his article in market watch."
"All Tesla potencial competitors are 2-3 or more years behind. In the meantime, Tesla will continue to develop and optimize the production process and new features and capabilities on his vehicles. Therefore it is reasonable to assume that this advantage will be maintained in the following years. Tesla will capture more market share not through price war but product technology substitution. This strategy is so robust that it is not crazy to think that Tesla will be a big player in the automobile industry in sales and profits."
"Tesla paradox alert: Tesla claims they will grow 50% yoy for multiple years. Analysts say anywhere from 10-30m cars/year. Yet Musk also says the robotaxi business will boom and car utilization will increase by multiples. Don't these two predictions contradict each other? If car utilization increases by 5x, that means car market is 1/5 what it used to be. So how are they going to sell 30m cars a year when the worldwide car market contracts to 15 million cars because of FSD?"
Another two bucks and my $288 short position will be underwater. I'm so terrified. This ongoing epic squeeze Elon promised has me close to the edge; jason and Bernard must be getting wood.
"Man I?ve been celebrating all night. Came here to see comments of other bullish individuals celebrating . But, apparently a lot of people want the stock to drop to get it . Maybe they sold five minutes too soon or they shorted on the way down. Either way I?m confident this closes above 700$ Monday. And don?t give me #$%$ It is what it is . Elon is a new age Rockefeller or Edison. He?s going to be in the history books . My bet is with FSD, solar, battery powered Tesla?s that have longer range than other ev?s, a mans relentless ambition to colonize Mars , I?m with Elon til the end. If I didn?t invest all my money here already you can bet your #$%$ I?d buy more even @695. Also, trust me when I say I?m not the only one"
"I had a former coworker when I was quitting my job and focusing on full time trading, he tells me to buy calls for TSLA, as his investment strategy. When you start having clowns all over the place giving investment advice to pump overvalued stocks, you know the end is near."

Why does Tesla need to buy Bitcoin to accept Bitcoin as payment?
"There is a problem with Solar City. As much as I like green technology, and am concerned about global warming, I have not personally invested in a home solar system. I used to feel bad about that. My excuses were 'lame' practical things like my house is already built, and there are some ""sleeping dogs"" in it's 60 year old electrical system that it's best not to wake. That and the fact that I understand solar energy in principle, but I have no idea who makes the best panels or most reliable inverters, and I have no rational basis to chose a contractor to outsource these worries to. I don't want to lease a system from Solar City, but I also don't want to buy a bunch of hardware to discover that it is becoming obsolete or has hidden reliability issues. Those excuses might be lame, but I've decide that they are legitimate and probably not unique to me. Thinking about the big picture, it is clear that home solar was a transitional technology. It was useful for small demonstration projects to prove the technology, but it won't scale. The issue is that valuing the power at retail rates, whether it is being bought or sold, does not compensate the power company for the valuable service it provides as a regulator and market-maker for electricity.Again, this was fine for small demo projects, where the amount of power involved was just noise to the power company, but the recent cuts in Nevada's incentives for home solar -- and Solar City's petulant flounce out to that market -- show that power companies can't and won't provide this free service to everyone if home solar goes mainstream. But Solar City's business model assumes these government incentives will continue.Something has to break.As the cost of solar tech drops, the fixed overhead -- in terms of engineering, sales, tech support, permit processing, government inspections, retrofit installations, etc -- of tiny demo home demo projects will becomes prohibitive.For solar power to scale, it has to transition from home systems to larger installations with the economies of scale to better carry the overhead. Ultimately, acres and acres of cheap desert land will be paved over with large solar farms. Perhaps, as a transition technology, we'll see regional solar installations such as shade structures in airport parking lots, or larger scale point of use solar systems for big flat roofed commercial buildings. But they will be measured in mega-watts. KW scale systems are inherently expensive toys. We simply can't value large quantities of solar electricity production at the retail rate. It has to be priced wholesale. Even that is being generous, since a natural gas fired 'peaker' produces power that is inherently much more valuable, since the operator can control *when* it gets produced.In short, Solar City's model of massively scaling up home solar production is fundamentally flawed. It counts on government incentives to overvalue the electricity produced. Those incentives were the right policy, and did their job to get the solar revolution started, by making demonstration projects possible, but they were never intended to scale.The Solar industry and utility companies will need to think through what to do for the next step. I still think solar power is the long term solution, but building millions of tiny power plants, each one essentially a one-off prototype, with only an ignorant part-time manager (the home owner) is a stupid way to execute."
"My short patience with rolling calls has finally paid off. For all the longs belive it or not I am sorry this is happening. not because you are losing money-that is just part of this game . We all have done that and will continue to do it if we keep playing markets. no, what I am sorry for is that you continue to fall for all of this progressive left win BS in everything not just Tesla. Read a real book on the history of the Left as it is defined today -everything they touch turn toi total disaster. not a high 5. not a large amount-everything. Like all things ""progressive' Tesla was totally dependent on government for not only financing but also penalizing the competition . Passing laws and regulations to shut out the truth so their ideas can survive. Maybe solar and EV's will make sense one day but unfortunately by having Dems and progressive forcing it long before it was ever ready or even wanted we probably moved back the possibility of it by 30 years. Read ""The road to Serfdom by F.A. Hyeck. Learn from this or continue to go down the Road to Serfdom"" that the Left always leads you to........"
"Tesla financial reports - there have been 85 SEC requests for additional information and disclosures in the last 5 years.In the same period Ford has had zero requests.Elon Musk isn't lying. He's simply testing and pushing boundaries. Like children do. Hehe, isn't it sweet?"
The winner of full autonomous and robo taxis will the company with the most data. Tesla currently has 15 BILLION miles of real world data. The next closest company is Google with 26 million. Who is going to catch Tesla and how?
"And now Battery Day doesn't seem all that much important, does it? $TSLA retail investors left holding the bag. Jump on $NIO, where you have a much brighter upside potential."

"Honestly, all the $SPAC are completely worthless - look at $VGAC (merged with 23andme), the company won't be profitable until 2025 and even then, it needs to raise more money to survice.Look at $CCIV - the company is building EVs when all other companies are busy selling EVs?If you go through all the $SPAC, you will see that more than 80% of them are i) losing millions/billions of dollars, ii) no revenue, iii) got a huge premium (which the creators get 20% risk free profit), iv) about to file bankruptcy.Honestly, where are SEC regulators looking at this behavior? This is another bubble along with $BTC and $TSLA. Once popped, people will blame SEC for this."

"Tesla signs contract with lawn service company <===== let's speculate our brains out The move will drastically alter the way Tesla mows their lawn. It frees up dozens maybe hundreds of employees who are desperately needed on the assembly lines. Savings in the form of reduced mower maintenance could make this a game changer. According to Elon the idea came to him while he was digging the $10 million tunnel. Some analysts urge caution because such an ambitious plan might take several years to implement - ""there is no way to know if hiring an outside firm to mow the lawn can even be done."" The details of the contract are unknown but we do know Apple also uses an outside lawn service sparking merger rumors. In other news - dramatic evidence of Global Cooling hit the region last night and will threaten our very existence until Friday when we will see catastrophic Global Warming heading into the weekend."
I can hardly wait for Tesla to announce the Cyber habitat and disrupt the housing industry.
"Elon regarding Tesla Autonomy: ""It's probably towards the end of this year, and then it's up to regulators to decide when they want to approve that.""Listen... we all know that great things come from failure. And Elon has failed a lot. Solar roofs, PowerWall/Pack... we all know the list. But what people don't tac on to the end of that list is Tesla Auto.Tesla Auto is a failure. The goal was to vastly EXCEED existing auto companies in manufacturing efficiencies, profits and fully autonomous vehicles. The original goal was not this though... it was to save the planet by replacing existing power sources with renewable energy power sources.Why did the goal change? Two words... share price. It's like water for Tesla. They would have died without it. But the rub here is... THEY COMPANY SHOULD HAVE DIED.The reason why great things come from failure is because the failure is recognized and learned from. Where Elon has failed his customers, employees, shareholders and himself is... he knowingly skipped this important step in technological advancement that would have lead to better science and innovation... for his own gain."
So far in 2020 Tesla has made 1.5 billion from credits by fleecing fellow car makers and roughly 600 million from government subsidies to lower price. Thus almost 30% of their revenues are paid by the government. It is possible that their improvement is so great that they eventually will make some money.

Glad to see GM doing well today. Now perhaps we can still have a 2 horse race for the leading American auto manufacturer in terms of valuation. I was becoming concerned. Unlike some here I don't revel in seeing American companies fail.

Chinese coal use has been soaring for the past several months because of the increased demand for electric power (most of which is provided by coal). Virtually every analyst is predicting a rapid increase of EV use in China which will require huge additional amounts of coal to power the generators to charge their batteries.

Wow! Tons of desperate shorts coming out of the woodwork today. I wonder why? Could it be that they’d finally like to cover and go shart somewhere else? Maybe try dragging down a different company? My advice is to stop shorting and go long. That way you can make money and support companies you like!
"it's funny, traditional car manufacturer have a recall on mechanical issues that will put you in imminent danger. For tesla they're suggesting a recall because the memory chip might get full after centuries and then the defogger won't work. lol... 15-20 years tou should be expected to do repairs."

"Rumor: Tesla Model 2 Already Developed in China & Goes to Production in 2022On January 8, information was leaked from the Chinese media that Tesla had already developed a new car model, and would soon be ready to begin production at its Giga Shanghai. The affordable compact car is expected to be produced and delivered in 2022.According to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, some of the best works of art in the world were created in China, so he believes that projects created in China will also be popular around the world. The Chinese have always been distinguished by originality, speed, and intelligence, so China is a great place to develop, create, and implement the most original and unexpected solutions.At the ceremony of handing over the first made-in-China Model 3s to owners, which took place on January 7, 2020, in Shanghai, Musk announced that Tesla plans to establish its own R&D center in China, where the company will create a car for the whole world. Musk said:“Something that would be super cool...so we’re going to do it...is to try to create a China to actually design an original car in China for worldwide consumption. I think this will be very exciting.""As early as mid-January 2020, Tesla began recruiting employees for the new development center and called on them to help the company build Chinese-style cars.Today, the Chinese media, citing reliable sources, reported that the new Tesla car model already was approved as early as September 2020. Product verification is expected to be completed in March 2021, with production and first deliveries scheduled to begin in 2022. Tesla will build its new model at Giga Shanghai.According to sources, the chassis of the car is based on the Model 3 chassis, which will also speed up and simplify the start of production. Perhaps this is what made it possible to develop a new model so quickly. Estimated price will range from RMB150,000 to RMB200,000 ($25,000 - $30,000).When Tesla opened recruitment for the R&D center in mid-January 2020, the team used an image of an interesting new concept car. We've never seen anything like it before. Whether Tesla will develop something similar at the new Chinese R&D center, or it's just a picture that has nothing to do with Tesla's future projects, we do not know. But the new China-made model is sure to be as stunning as the entire Chinese Tesla project.Good luck and GOD bless,"
2020 ends with ALL TIME HIGH! What shorties don't understand is that Tesla investors buy and hold. That's why the float is so low. Investors don't care about Market Cap.

"Musk's true colors being exposed in the Unsworth case. Hard to determine an actual financial hit, but it sure isn't positive PR. All Elon needed to do, was stick with his initial (albeit insincere) apology, and this all would have gone away. He didn't even need to pay any monetary damages, as Unsworth wasn't seeking any, until Musk continued to taunt him. However, I'm thrilled that the world is starting to see Musk for who he really is, as many of us ""haters"" (I prefer ""skeptics"") have believe all along. You God is just a human, and not a very nice one at that."

Very interesting article on the business news. Tesla short sellers lost 35 billions this year which is more than the lose of airline industry since the start of the pandemic of 24 billions. I remember I had an extra 100 shares on margin at 400 and sold them to buy NIO and as soon as I sold my margin the stock jumped 180 points and NIO went down lol my lesson is I should not sell one single share of Tesla...margin or not. https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/04/investing/tesla-short-sellers-elon-musk/index.html
is going to touch 260 again?
"Bugatti Chiron:Price: $3 million0-60: 2.3 secondsRange: 308 milesTesla Model S Plaid+:Price: $133,0000-60: 1.99 secondsRange: 520+ milesCan't afford either? No problem. Tesla will be releasing an EV for 25k, too."

Boomer retails stocks get their boost today, then its back to tech explosion, as soon as government stops sitting on their hands. Long TSLA, buy the dip"
Don’t you think making cars in 2024 is far away from today? Plans always can be changed during 2-3 years. Tim Cook might not be the Apple CEO in 2024. Anything can happen during 2-3 years frames.
we live in a day and age where we dont have to mindlessly listen to some hack analysts and buy according to their recommendations. so many people sitting at home doing stocks now they just purely choose stocks that they like. doesnt matter about fundmanetals. just buy stocks based off of if it is cool to own. Analyst ratings are taken with a huge grain of salt now.
$273? what happened to $140?
"Guys, Elon is purposely saying some negative things to bring the stock down before the S&P inclusion."
"Excellent. The Shorts are out in force with negative comments. Every time this happens TSLA, soon skyrockets upwards."
Morgan Stanley said the Ford Mustang Mach-E is stealing EV share from Tesla hand over fist. Ford posted record EV sales in February.
Is Musk shorting his own stock? Why is he always advertising other companies/forms of payments etc. and why did he speak like a he was high during the earnings conference?
"Market cap of TSLA is 832 billion or $1.75 million per car sold each year versus $9,000 per car for GM. WAKE UP"
"I bet my left nut this is happening in March.Retail Investor: I'm sorry babe, this was just a short term fling. It was fun but I gotta get back to work.CCIV: but you said you loved me... just rode me and wanna leave... pumped and dumped me...?Retail investors: you knew what this was...Nio and Tesla: welcome home babe, Retail investors: time to buy the dip. There is NIO one besides you'd id ever baghold for. Having NIO and TESLA is a musk for a successful portfolio.$CCIV $TSLA $NIO"
I can afford to lose everything that I have invested in tsla. But I can't afford not to make the the money I will have if they achieve half of the plan.
"Tesla crash in Fredrikstad, Norway. The driver of the Model 3 ""braked hard - with no response"". There are no brake tracks on the site. Police will investigate. $tsla $tslaqThese cars sound incredibly safe! I want to get one to drive my kids around in. Yes, it's risky, but it's worth it to be a part of something. Remember all those magazines that called Elon Musk a ""visionary genius"" after he got the hairplug surgery? THAT'S why you buy a Tesla, not for safety."

"Domestic growth for this farce has already flat lined. Nitrogen type fuel far better and up next. The far from green half a ton per scam car, strip mining / smelting disasters to quickly be gone."
"I spent a lot of time researching Tesla's competition this weekend. Non have the production capacity of Tesla, the know how, and most valuable, the data they have collected over the years. All hype, over-promised and under delivering. Made me conclude that I am planting both feet firmly and staying long on my Tesla position. This company is amazing and this year will prove it when the world sees the competition flop. BTW, Tesla stated in 4q earnings that only thing stopping them from build Semi's and commercial vans faster is battery production. Ask yourself this, if you're Panasonic, LG, or CATL and Tesla has 5 assembly plants, which customer are you going to satisfy first with battery productionramp up? "
China has very little or nothing to do with this quarters results.
"TSLA, A great buy opportunity for a stock that’s headed for $1,000 !!"
Roll some TSLA to $IPV
Almost showtime for the 1K run.
"There has been a lot of hope and hype about growth for Tesla, but I suspect that a lot of it is misplaced. We now know that almost their entire growth last year was around China. Their sales in Europe were down for the year, and outside of China, any growth was modest or a result of entering a new market.The problem is that much of that growth has been (continually) at the expense of reputation, with consumers and regulatory bodies. The quality of their cars has come into question in Europe (see Netherlands taxi cab story), In the US (see stories about recalls in US) and now China (see stories about Tesla risks wearing out welcome in China). Now there are even reports that highlight the (long known) fact that Tesla has been hyping their range. Now there is serious competition and it is growing rapidly just as the 'wow' factor for Tesla is wearing off. What will be interesting to watch is when the same 'wow' factor wears off on the share price. Of course a move from $900 to $800 isn't really a sign of that yet, but a break down to $600 or $500 would be a pretty serious outcome.The lack of profits and declining margins on growing sales was a warning shot. When sales start to stabilize and profits still don't show up, well, investors may take notice. (And when I say investors, I don't mean day traders and swing traders. I mean investors who are buying into the idea that Tesla has some sort of magic battery or secret cool factor.These things only last so long . . . In Europe's top markets, Tesla had 10% share last quarter, and while the data for this quarter is way, way too early, Tesla currently makes up just 2.5% of the market. No one company has to be better than Tesla when 9 out of every 10 EVs is sold by other companies. The number of models (and companies) is growing rapidly and Tesla laid the foundation for that sea change.Good luck with your decisions, but the bloom may be off the rose.Guru."
I was expecting about $700 after earning but I guess it will be around $800 after earning.
"Adam Jonas gave it a 1 yr PT of 810 this week. He is a major TSLA bull, so even according to his own words this over valued!"

"Here's some predictions for next year:January 2nd Eletrek report on estimated Model 3 sales. The figures are again not good for Tesla - just 380 delivered in December. Stock falls below 300.Feb 2nd - Tesla reports 4th Quarter results. Its a beat - thanks to some credits Tesla only lose $580 million in the quarter. Tesla report that they may be trouble being a going concern withing the next 12 months. Elon states - ""no capital raise"" Stock falls to 240. March - Jaguar release the I-Pace to rave reviews. Tesla Model 3 sales hit 1000 for the month. Still somewhat behind the GM Bolt and now the Nissan leaf which sells 1500 for the month. Telsa now below $200.April - Tesla releases first quarter results - still another $600 million loss. August - Tesla enters Chapter 7. Elon Musk resigns to focus on Space XNovember. Musk arrested for securities violations"
"What’s funny is even when earnings are hit, the stock still takes a quick dive "
Will Tesla defend itself by saying it's WM fault because nobody put their hand on the roof ?
"It's too funny to see bears jump in as soon as stock drops like 5-10% haha. The stock ran over 1500% last year. Give it some breather space. Longs will still be green if it drops another 70%. Let that sink in and realize what you have missed :P Anyways, did anything change on Tesla last one week? NO! So this drop is just a technical drop and it will rebound easily if the underlying business doesn't change."

"So basically, Tesla just admitted that their production line isn’t able to increase efficiency. Costs will rise. Gross margin will slide."
Teflon hired VP engineering from Snapchat to start a dating service for Tesla.
"Musk tells the the world, without any warning, that Tesla was within weeks of bankruptcy. Can you imagine being the Accounts Payable Manger at Tesla, and being told by your boss (Musk) to negotiate extended terms to suppliers? ""Everything's great, no problems whatsoever, of course you'll get paid"". Musk must always portray himself, and Tesla, as the underdog, beating the odds, (it's the Drama Queen within him) even though it is Musk himself, that is increasing those odds, against success. Not fit to be night manager of a Loco Pollo, let alone a CEO of a $50B (and dropping) publicly traded company."

"I have a question for TSLA shareholders: You are currently paying approximately $1.3 million for each car Tesla produces. In dollar terms (looking at current profitability), you're paying about $700,000 for a business that generated $300 in profits on that $700,000 investment. Do you consider that a reasonable valuation? If you think it is reasonable, what valuation numbers would you consider to be UNreasonable?"
Why so much censorship on this page?????

Norway === Teslas annual sales dropped 51 % Norway was once Teslas largest market outside the USA.
TSLA will collapse from now and a lot in January. Why? because many await to take profits for tax reasons and many shorters did cover (squeezed) for tax reasons this month and even today.

definitely TSLA will trend higher and will add here
"Just a little history lesson. One year ago shares were selling for $100. Yes, just 365 days ago. From $100 to $880 in 365 days. What this means is that at ANYTIME the share price can easily RETRACE. I mean 1 year is not that long ago "
Shorts suffered the pain. Longs can lose everything

This is not because of shorts. Traders and hedge funds bought shares during the run up expecting to sell them to S&P 500 index funds today. Evidently there were more shares available to sell than there was demand to buy them.
Dear TSLA compatriots. Did you miss out on biotech revolution last year. NVAX and MRNA had 30X to 50X. There is one company that has the same potential to blasts off in 2021. DVAX is providing their adjuvant cog 1018 to 5 covid vaccine companies around the world. Recently Clover pharmaceutical and Valneva pharmaceutical both decided to use DVAX adjuvant instead of GSK adjuvant. DVAX is ready to blasts off right now like NVAX. DONT MISS IT.

Started buying beginning of the year about 180shares to date. Staying long forever! Expecting a progressive ramp up towards 700-800? prior to 21st. Any thoughts if there will be a significant pullback (towards 500-600ish) just after the 21st?
Tesla stock in inflated only through the FED. FED neither know what they should do with their money nor what they are buying with Tesla shares. Big downside risk for Tesla.

"Looking at the chart pattern today, it looks like they were trying to keep the Price around 775. Maybe to kill the options there. To develop a heavier open interest at that strike, and then maybe they hope to kill those options there on Friday. So maybe they expect a big jump tomorrow and then a sell off on Thursday and Friday?I can't be sure. What I am Certain of is that the Tutes are not going to be sleeping on this. They know what people are expecting, nothing is going to be a surprise, so I'm sure they are arming themselves with the tools to take everyone's money. Especially the retail investor that can't afford to play long term. I can see that the Price is trying to be 775 even AH."

Tesla cannot just meet expectations at the current price it has to blow numbers away. Priced to perfection and produce “less” than is 50-75 points down. Get used to misses and going down going to be a dark 2021
"The maintenance of tesla at an 800 billion valuation is a natural phenomenon. Recalls, permit problems in Berlin, reprimands by the Chinese government for building poor vehicles and the purchase 1.5 billion of bitcoin with share dilution.

"For those trying to #$%$ people with talk of battery swapping rather than charging, Tesla Model 3 battery warranty on current battery pack, not the new improved, is eight years or 120,000 miles on long-range and performance configurations and eight years or 100,000 miles on standard configuration, whichever comes first, with minimum 70% retention of battery capacity over the warranty period. At that point, the battery can be replaced if you don't want to trade in. Teslas have a low depreciation rate as well."

And 2021 Price Reduction. If Tesla were to attract new customers by price reduction, we need to run away from this business as fast we could. Margins will suffer and competition is severe. Importantly EV is getting into commodity space. Apple is looking into this space to be a differentiator in this field and wipeout everyone. That is going to be a real threat."
"TSLA is going to change the world with those self-driving cars coming out within a year. For this reason, TSLA is a ""buy on dips"" stock. I hope everyone knows this.TSLA: $820.05b pre-market"

"So, today we have confirmation:1. Q4 was a lower profit than Q3.2. There is almost no way Q1, which will be another one off of higher margin backlog, will be profitable.3. In order to not go bankrupt in Q2, we will rely on massive sales of a version if Model 3 that does not exist and for which the is limited demand.4. There is no more demand for higher end.5. We don't have fat margins 6. We are competing against legacy car makers that actually know what they are doing."

Dann folgte der Hyundai Kona Elektro mit 1170 deutschen Neuzulassungen laut KBA und direkt dahinter der Renault Zoe, der 2020 das meistverkaufte Elektroauto in Deutschland war. Erst auf Platz 14 ist im Januar 2021 das Tesla Model 3 zu finden, das in Deutschland 422-mal neu zugelassen wurde."
"Tesla is a good car. But now lots of competitions. Technically every EV is almost same. Others have 15 PE, Tesla has 1300 PE. Everyone says it is scary and rediculously priced now. Elon himself is sweating bullets on this valuation. I am shorting to the max and I will live with the consequence if moves higher. But myself and all the wallstreet analysts and Hedgfund guys says it is going to fall from the cliff very very soon. This is purely my opinion and my position on this stock. I am short on this. Mainly on valuation basis. This is unsustainable and insanity to the core. I just cannot be more explicit than this. Dont flame me. At market, we need shorts and longs. I am on the opposite side of longs."

"Will you buy tesla at this level? A high growth company with first move advantage needs to put it’s cash to scale up quickly (tesla supposedly has a supply isssue) and in R&D(reinventing the car is not cheap).Musk proved that your money is better spent gambling on bitcoin than invensting in his own business. It doesn’t matter that btc might go up. If you think so invest in btc directly, you will get a better bang for your buck. The valuation of tesla right now supposes that in 10 years it will have 90% of the market share of automobiles. How can that happen when GM is investing 10B in EV while Tesla puts 1.5B in bitcoin?"

The consensus seems to be $2500 to $3000 by 2025
"Model 3 sales drop 23% Q3 ""success"" was manifested from pent up demand (sand bagging) from Q2, and pull-ahead from Q4.Expect more incentives. Best time to buy? Chose an in-stock vehicle, two weeks before Christmas. Get the full $7,500."
"GM’s new Bolt EVs are unimpressive. They’re high priced and deliver lesser power than Tesla Model 3. I have test driven an older Bolt EV and it’s nowhere comparable with a Tesla. I’d rather pay a few thousand dollars more to get a Model 3.As these big companies drag their feet on EVs, the relatively low priced Cybertruck is projected to be on the streets this year. Elon has said that he’s looking to bring a $25000 car in next couple of years. If the government decides to extend tax credits to ALL vehicles and not just an arbitrary first so many x00000, watch the demand for $TSLA vehicles grow beyond your wildest imagination.I believe that Tesla will be the undisputed leader in the battery and vehicles market in a couple of years. It is unstoppable; and deservedly so. $TSLA kept going even as it faced liquidity issues. Other car manufacturers like $GM, $F, $TM, $HYMTF barely paid attention to this market segment despite having a strong brand name and deep pockets. They had several years to bring out a well priced and quality EV but were ineffective. I can’t help but think that these big automakers are finally taking interest in the EV market because of $TSLA rich valuation."

Went to Starbucks today and as I’m in line I see a beautiful white model 3 in front of me. It had the paper license plate on it. After I left Starbucks I’m heading towards the avenue and a gorgeous white model Y passes me and it had a paper plate. And as I’m getting home close to turning the block I see another model 3 (this time black) and guess what it had!? A paper license plate. These are all recent deliveries! Imagine those going around with regular license plates that are also recently delivered. Honestly I’m taking this as a good sign... just thought I should share.
If they prove that there is some issue in just 2 cars..this thing will loose 500B market cap in a month..that’s how risky this one is..longs just beware

"A lot of ""experts"" keep shouting this ""bubble"" will burst. They say this stock is made up out of robinhooders who just get aboard the hype train. Now let me tell you something. Small fry on robinhood won't buy a stock with a value of over 2500 dollars. Even post split the value is waaayyyy to high for the regular kid on robinhood. This stock has become more and more popular even after reaching a value that was waaayyy to expensive for your average joe to purchase. And about the hype train. Sure I get Tesla has a big hype with Elon at the top. But that is not a bad thing, at all. Elon will deliver the hype. Thinks like battery day will stir up the hype and the stock will once again shoot into the sky. Yeah sure a lot of people will sell their stock.. but the stock will keep on growing because people love Elon and they love all that he does. Sure dips will come and go but just remember... this stock has so much potential... even on days where big tech firms like apple go deep in the red, nasdaq is in the red, beloved stocks like amazon and nio are all in the red, Tesla isnt falling that hard if you think of it... Tesla is still there with a GREAT value considering what it accomplished in the last year. Good luck to all of you."
"I sure hope SEC will go after that #$%$ Elon Madoff.Nouriel Roubini, an economist known as ""Dr.Doom"" for his pessimistic market views, said Elon Musk's tweet about bitcoin ahead of Tesla's investment in the cryptocurrency is a form of ""market manipulation"" and the SEC should investigate.""First take an individual position in bitcoin, pump the price up, and then say that Tesla has invested,"" Roubini said in an interview with CoinDesk on Wednesday.

TSLA analysts peak target price has almost approched $8500. Most analysts and their clients will book profits at this point and wait for its correction. So beware at this point to buy now. This is just an alert.

"the low Q1 sales has been known for months, why did anyone panic now? is there more bad news?"
Do a low PE ration means your paying less for a company with little to no future growth and a high pe means your paying a lot for a company that is either over priced or is over developing now I get it TESLAS PE of 1000 means we’re paying a lot for the company but the company is giving us a lot back in return this makes perfect sense so if you study Teslas future you see that we are NOT paying too much money for a car company like Tesla because it is GROWING. What a novel idea I like that I think I will buy more shares on Monday.
Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 5.15% higher. TSLA is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy).
"For this Q4, without the regulatory credits, they had a loss per car sold.401(credits) - 379 (income before taxes) = 22 million.22M / 186k (cars sold) = $118 per car loss.On a yearly basis it is worse:1580(credits) - 924(income before taxes) = 656 million.656M / 500k (cars sold) = $1312 per car loss.The Amazon playbook of destroying retail will not work here. Regulators in the Obama/holder era turned a blind eye to the predatory shenanigans of the bozo. Add the Attorney Generals like culminated to that.In China, the market is huge that Musk cannot supply all demand. The likes of NIO, will not take the bait. They will sell at a premium. I will go out on a limb here and state NIO and LI report a profit in Q4.Part of the BOZO playbook was that despite the losses they propped up the stock while tearing apart the brick and mortar stores by shellacking the stock prices.They can try by pushing down the ADRs for the Chinese EVs."

"Why did Musk's initial tweets portray this as a done deal, if his subsequent email revealed it to be merely his intention?Were these plans in the works when Musk publicly predicted a ""short burn of the century"" and a short squeeze larger than Volkswagen? Were they in the works when he aggressively purchased $TSLA shares in the premarket?If this deal is real, it won't be wrapped up for at least 6 months, and probably longer: a) need to assemble an independent board to vote on the deal (a court ruling this year decided that $TSLA's board is not independent of Musk), b) need a proxy statement with extensive risk disclosures (some think this is why $TSLA couldn't take the Saudi PIPE in the first place), c) need a shareholder vote, d) need antitrust review, even if perfunctory.Meanwhile, cash burn continues - in order to avoid default on their ABL, they must have cash/avail on Jan 1, 2019 sufficient to cover both 2019 convert maturities as well as a $400M buffer. That comes to $1.8B. At June they had $2.2B of cash and are burning close to $1B per quarter. Tough math.Musk says shareholders won't be forced to sell. How does that work? A private company with thousands of shareholders is still required to make SEC filings. How will unaccredited investors retain shares?The fact that none of these details was alluded to by Musk is further evidence that Musk has not discussed the deal with lawyers. Which brings us back to the question: how do you line up $70B in financing without involving a legal team?"

"-This $4,500 electric car is reportedly outselling Tesla's Model 3 in China by almost two to one-Tesla shares are being driven more by Reddit posts rather than the automaker's fundamentals or valuation, Barclays study finds-Tesla Idles Model 3 Line at California Plant for Two Weekswhen news is all negative the buyers don't want to believe"
"Telsa has two problems - quantity and quality of sales. Quantity - is just the number of sales. The more they sell the better. Quality - is how much the buyers pays for the car compared to the cost to make and market it. When you sell an expensive model like the high end Model 3 the consumer tends to splurge and buy expensive (lucrative) options. When you sell a low cost unit like the base model 3 consumers shy away from the option packages. Tesla only sold the high end Model 3 in Q3 & Q4. They made cars as fast as they could. Ran three shifts. Even built an assembly line in a tent. They only produced a small profit. About $150 million. Now (or soon) comes the low quality sales. The tire kickers. The people who want a deal on their trade in. The people who want a no frill $35,000 Tesla. Elon Musk claims Q1 will be a loss. I doubt they have depleted the good sales in Europe and China yet. If they can't make money in Q1 and Q2 then Q3 and Q4 will be bloodbaths."
Anyone notice TD Ameritrade doing second maintenance over the last few days? Are they load testing to make sure they can handle all the Tesla buy orders this week? Hope Robinhood fixed their back office. Better get your trades in.

TSLA bubble burst?
"With TSLA being in a dip and heading to 500$ level, no fast recovery. You can still jump on it in the next weeks. Hold the shares you have. Easy money to be made fast are cheap stocks that Wallstreetbets are promoting like GME, AMC, HCMC. HCMC is at 0.0025 right now with the forecast to go up to over 1$. Once you make some profit you can always buy more TSLA later, even model Y with it. There is no reason to sit and cry and watch a dip/crash for the next days."

"There are some growth companies where earnings don't matter because they are software as a service companies with large customer acquisition costs. The acquisition costs are all expensed, but they produce future earnings. This is why investors look to revenue growth primarily and give the failure to achieve substantial GAAP profits a pass.But TSLA IS A CAR COMPANY. That where essentially all it's revenues come from. When TSLA builds a new plant and equips it, the expenses are all CAPITALIZED. So investors must ask, what are the actual profits from selling the cars?And TSLA's hypothetical future growth businesses are also very capital intensive. (Meaning that the expenses of scaling up to large size are all CAPITALIZED, not expensed. So, again, investors need to see evidence that the businesses (like the energy business) can produce real profits. So far, the energy business hasn't."

Musk has tweeted himself out of favor with Wall Street and TSLA will be punished severely. The market moving tweets have become a distraction and disturbing. A 50% retracement lands TSLA in the $400 range.
REMEMBER shorts laughed at the analysts that upgraded TSLA $700-$900? Shorts are not laughing now. 
we go down only to go higher...accumulate shorts to squeeze.
Sold at $780 :/ but this valuation will be corrected eventually. Probably should have left a few shares but whatever. PLENTY of gains from this electric cow. I'll be buying back in at after what will be a very painful adjustment for any new-comers

"Chinese regulators interview Tesla to strengthen consumer protectionFive departments, including China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), recently interviewed Tesla, asking it to effectively protect the legal rights of consumers.According to a statement published on the SAMR's website, the action was taken because consumers complained about abnormal acceleration, battery fires, and problems related to vehicle remote upgrades (OTAs) in Tesla vehicles.The regulators asked Tesla to strictly comply with Chinese laws and regulations, strengthen internal management, and implement the main responsibility for corporate quality and safety.Tesla was also asked to maintain social public safety and effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of consumers."
"TSLA is not a bubble. The earnings today should be spectacular. If you want to know what a bubble is, look at GME, AMC, and BBBY. Loser stocks with unsustainable business models and bleak futures that are rallying to the moon. That's not TSLA. TSLA's future is extremely bright and their business model is quite sustainable. Maybe you'll thank me for this lesson when those three stocks run out of gas and come plummeting back to earth, however shorting them at this point in time is financial suicide over the short term. TSLA unlike many other names is not relinquishing its gains this week. I am fully prepared to buy the dip in the unlikely event earnings trigger a selloff."
Holding some in case it goes up on Monday and if it doesn’t ... I’m gonna have to be a long hahaha
"Now a new semi- who are you going to sell it to? the independent trucker, I do not think so.They are loyal to Kenworth and Peterbuilt to name a few with proven engines from Detroit,Cummings and Cat.I Truckers are not going to risk their careers on an unproven product. Not to mention the visceral feel of driving a real truck, leave the tonka toys to the silicon valley weenies and the rest of the over educated under achievers who are trying to save the world from carbon emmissions."

"Serious post now. Can any long make a real argument why this stock is so cheap at $250. A real argument based on facts. I have spelled out my short case. Huge losses, cash flow negative. convertible bonds coming due, production promises never being met, bipolar CEO, so on and so on. All I have seen from longs is ""EV is the future"", ""musk is a genius"" ""great buying opportunity"". Please give me a solid reason why, not just blind faith or because ""I say so""."
Just chilling. Buy after huge dips. Never let short term dips affect long term gains. Been here since pre-split.

"I live in Vancouver, Canada. And I see Tesla everywhere on the road."
Read an Alpha article making the case to buy puts. Even with rosy assumptions they see TSLA down to 50
"“Musk in 2020 said the Model Y Standard Range would likely sport an ""unacceptably low"" 250-mile range, so he was on the money with that estimate. It sounds like Musk and friends had a change of heart. Or, it's another one of Tesla's epically creative no-money-spent marketing stunts.” CNETOK, let’s talk about the endless “stunts” legacies have resorted to over the last century to sell their cars. Never could figure out why huge American flagpoles, giant blow up animals and characters and a sea of flipping in the wind balloons, banners and steamers have to do with getting the message out to prospective buyers. The list and nature of their incentives is long. Tesla doesn’t even advertise."
Hey TSLA fluffers! How's the weather in Bangalore this afternoon?
GM is up..Tesla is down. Ouch.
Highly anticipated to see -15% today only
"The Tesla shares I sold last week for $778 per share were added to my portfolio in October 2019 at $45.80 per share, adjusted for the 5-for-1 stock split of August 2020. That's a return of $1,600%. Want more picks before they run. Check out (http://tradingstrategys.com)."
"The stock falling 6.29% during afterhours due to S&P non-inclusion shows just how much speculation is involved with the stock. If you think $TSLA is a good company that is worth more than its current valuation, you should HOLD your shares. $TSLA's inclusion in the S&P 500 has absolutely NOTHING to do with the company's fundamentals and potentials. Be an investor, not a trader. As someone said, time in the market ALWAYS beats market timing."

"With all the glaring negatives, how does TSLA continue selling vehicles. 0 - 60 in 3 seconds can't be that alluring. Are Tesla buyers so wealthy that $50, 60, or 70K isn't that big a deal?????????? Simply amazing that this car is still on the road."

Bash at will but the whole market is tanked along with all the top stocks. It will take a while and some sanity to get back to where we were. No sense in panic selling now.

"I sold TSLA for a profit and never regret for selling a bit early. I will not get back in until this reaches $500 and starting average down if it keeps sliding. Right now, it's way over valued and investors don't feel comfortable holding this. Another problem is Bitcoin investment that raised a flag to a lot of investors who are not interested in bitcoin. You can sell now to book your profit and buy back in for even half the price."

Why TESLA vastly overvalued / overhype.1. Elon told at 160 that it was overvalued2. It gain 100% in 1month on 0 news 3. Big eps miss + margin compression on bigger sale (red flag)4. Loosing europe market share5. Every car company have EV (Tesla is price for 50%+ market share in few years)6. 1million car capacity for 2021 but projected demand of 750k (not demand limited)

When TSLA was $50 a share people said company will collapse. Again when it was $100 people said it is inflated and will collapse. It went to $200 and the same messages. It went to $300 then $400 then $500 then $600 then $700 then $800 then $884 and they say it will collapse......I can't help but smile

"Elon Musk has demonstrated within two separate words he has lifted the share price of two different sectors within hours this past week GME & bitcoin. Now that all he has to do is have something true and substantial from Tesla use the power of his ability to cause the share to rise for Tesla shareholders within hours too. The truth strength would be to have the current $793.53 to $2000+ on his tweet, he allegedly causes approximately $4k for Bitcoin from the following tweet ""#bitcoin"". Now it has been proven short selling could become financially detrimental and more so when Elon Musk tweets or makes a comment, soon you will need to cause the same effect at a much larger scale for Tesla it is only right to use his power for his long term investors who will in my view are also potential clients to buy Tesla transportation and energy."
"So out of fElon's own mouth they needed a 3rd production line to be able to reach the 5k per week mark. And yet for the past several week we had been assured by the longs on this board that the 2 existing lines would produce the 5k+ and the 3rd line was to be able to reach the 10k mark and was supposed to be much more efficient than the first 2. Then we find out it is in a tent and is so he can make 5k per week, not the 10k per week. What a sham."

"Peter Lethbridge, Tesla model X owner's heater failed.... had to endure a 250 mile trip with out heat. Took to service for the 14th time in 14 months.

Service says they have 20 cars in the area waiting for heaters. Owner says he's ""just about lost faith in the car.""Typical Tesla owner blindly in love with a lemon car.... same as Tesla longs surrounded by 50 red flags on a lemon stock."
Cathie is making the bubble bigger and bigger. I am patiently waiting for her to run out of money.
"Ouch, GNPX & TSLA Bulls......Thank you for your understanding & very high IQ. Instead of talking about my 70% long-term stocks that double every year min., Shorts like to talk about my 2.5% IBIO stock or almost another $2M I bankrolled on TSLA so far. Or 4,900% & $100M bankrolled for Genprex in a few years at my $150 PT (with my 620k shares so far). I am not done accumulating Genprex shares especially when shorts borrowed........My TSLA PT is min. ($20,000 in 2030) with my 1,000 shares (5,000 shares after stock split) from my research. I said minimum! The recent catalysts are massive......Even if you didn't get in at $250 & decided to get in last week when SP was around $1,450. That's 1,279% (Or almost 13X at $20,000 minimum in 2030). But, if you are looking for 49X, check out my research/thesis for Genprex. The $150 PT is only (1) of dozen markets. Shorts Can't be too bright if borrowed high interest & losing $18B so far shorting TSLA. We really need them to short more of Genprex & TSLA. Remember our $8.4B & $25B for Genprex & TSLA goal respectively. Keep standing in my way if you dare! $GNPX, $TSLA"
"Tesla pumped the last week of Q1 and the first week of Q2 to mislead investors into believing they were demonstrating a run rate... now they're shutting the factory down for a week. which means, if they sold 4k M3s for 3 weeks, that's 1,333 cars per week... NOT 3000.which means they just lied and fabricated the story to investors once again."
Tesla is traded like Bitcoin. No reason behind the crazy valuation... I like EVs and maybe they are the future but there is no justification for the crazy price.
"Consider TSLA misses the earning, the -4% after hour correction is minor. TSLA price raised from last earning around $425 to current $850. I except further pullbacks from TSLA since the stock is priced for perfection. Will wait for the drop to stable before selling puts."
The jig is up  Everyone who was buying this knew it was overvalued but they was just buying it for a quick trade figuring it would keep going up. Too bad for those who bought at THE TOP 
Loaded up on shares at $875 u guys think that was a good idea??

"READ TO THE END TESLA IS THE ONLY ONE WITH POSITIVE SALES :U.S. auto sales: TrueCar forecasts U.S. auto sales will fall 18% in July to 1,189,928 units to mark the fourth month in a row of sequential improvement. New light-vehicle sales decreased by 34% in March, 48% in April, 30% in May and 23% in June. ""Mainstream brands are steadily increasing their new vehicle sales month-over-month, especially brands with healthy inventory levels such as FCA. Their Jeep brand stands out for strong performance, likely driven by strong incentive programs as well as the inventory levels needed to satisfy the unique demands of shoppers,"" notes TrueCar's Nick Woolard. He notes that luxury brands BMW and Mercedes are recovering at a slower rate amid the tough macroeconomic backdrop.

"EV cost only justified if you charge at home, then you might save equivalent to one dollar per gallon, however charging at the charging station is about nine dollars per gallon. After adjusting for insurance and cost of the car EVs are more expensive to operate. States also will impose extra tax on EVs since they will miss revenue that currently collected at the gas pump. These are just a random thoughts"

"TODAY Elon's wealth increased by >$3B on paper (including AH price). And that doesn't even consider his fat stock bonus that kicks in if EV stays above $100b... which now seems significantly more likely. It will be interesting to see where he focuses his philanthropic efforts in 10 years. I'm a happy long-time Tesla and TSLA owner, and appreciate his efforts, but I hope he abandons his silly Mars obsession. He could easily blow his entire fortune sending a few souls to Mars... or focus on salvaging the life-sustaining ecosystems on this planet. Could do far more good if he fully commits to Team Earth."
Compare the movement of the Nasdaq Composite to EV bubble stocks in the past few weeks. Nasdaq has been on an uptrend while EV bubble stocks have been trading sideways. Next observe that EV bubble stocks have been trading with very low volume for the past 2 weeks now. Hype dying down? Pool of irrational buyers drying up? I believe the bubble may very well be on the cusp of bursting as people realize that they have been buying on EV hype and an Apple EV is the biggest hype there is.
Insiders and major institutions now selling Tesla
I wonder how many newly minted millionaires did Tesla stock make this year? (Raises hand because I'm one of them)
"I wanna buy TESLA, but for 70 USD... now it's a mega bubble! The biggest ever..."
Tesla is in trouble. They have been lowering their prices throughout the world. I guess they are hedging by buying bitcoin.

"There are two very different schools of thought clashing over the $TSLA valuation. On one hand, the old school - Buffett, Bury, etc. with their eyes always on present-day fundamentals, on the other hand Cathie Wood who's all about scouting for 'exponential growth' potential.These are all very smart people, but what if old-school financial conservatism is tantamount to short-sightedness in the high-tech age? After all, Buffet did miss the Big Tech boat in the early 2000s. The outcome of the argument might have a big influence on how we value stocks in the future. If Wood's valuation model is proven right, it may have massive ramifications in the markets.One of Wood's main points is that, in industries exposed to disruption by AI, holders of the most relevant data (used to train AI models) will have a decisive competitive advantage. This is her main reason for judging that other EVs will not be able to compete on fully-autonomous for years, by which time Tesla would capture the market.How do you marry this with traditional benchmarks and how do you even figure out the quantity and quality of data held by companies? While it's supposed to weigh so heavily on growth prospects, and implicitly onvaluations, most companies are very secretive about it!How do you price in the secret sauce when you don't know if it's any good or how much of it there is?"
Going to be a beautiful day to short!
"Stock was below 260 ten days ago BEFORE Tesla revealed the collapse in sales, IT should be crashing down FROM 260 to 200 today. But Elon manipulated the stock UP above 290 so it could “crash” back to unchanged at 260. Funny!"
"Everyone is out for this stock.....want to see it crater.....but it just keeps defying gravity.....just up and and up....destroying all naysayers....up dramatically in a horrible market. Yep, the 'pros' AS USUAL know nothing...."

BTC now at 45k. Tesla gambling with shareholder's cash lmao.
Apparently on twitter alot of call options have been cancelled. The call options on Tesla have forced firms to buy to hedge. Now there are more put options skew. So firms will sell which will beget more selling. This crash is going to be epic. Don't forget that shares can go down as well as up.
Let the market take its time to digest the earnings call. Elon Musk dropped clues if you listen.

Tesla was sent to save people like me. Thank you Tesla.. $$$$
The market knows the qoq sales numbers will be substantially lower. It even sees losses returning in Q4.
Wait until the announcement that Apple will source EV batteries from Tesla!
I heard it broke down and was covered up with a rocket launch.
"In two hours,let's see how pre-market will start."
Imagine a car which screen goes black occasionally. Would you trust it to drive fully autonomous with you on the back seat in the mountains?
Cathie woods just sold most of the shares they bought yesterday. My goodness
"Elon Musk, the billionaire, wants to tax me with carbon taxes so he can subsidize his electric car boondoggle.I will always consider him my enemy."
HYliion has improved battery tech.
oh brother just buy dip....honestly everything will back up...long term...enough said.
tesla is worth more than FB... lol...
"buy and ACCUMULATE. Hedgies game has to end. Trust in Q3, Q4 were solid. . TSLA 1200 breakout will come. The more we buy at this level, the more explosive is the shorts squeeze ..Hedgies game won't last. SPRING is for car demand"
"Tesla rocks on Monday on pension news from teachers not doubt!!!!!! COME ON REDDIT AND TELSA HOOK UP LETS GET THIS TO 10,000 a share!!!!!!"
"Holy Cow, where did all these bots come from today."
"Just wondering... since all the supply chain VP and Directors have left the company... If a major supplier demands COD, and they are already 100 days in arrears of pmts from Tesla--- Who will do the negotiating on behalf of Tesla to get the needed components?OH WAIT! Tesla has 3 months of Finished Goods No Problem! Forget I asked"
Down over 12% in real time trading in 2 days.. huge panic today.. and STILL 300% over valued.
"The Goodest Friend, where will all the energy for recharging these batteries come from??"
They couldn't even wait til Friday after hours to announce. That guy wanted out
who is rooting for Michael Burry thumbs down.......who is rooting for the leader Cathie Wood thumbs up
"Please, please, what a lame excuse for cutting supply to Norway. So, instead of keeping the badly needed delivery numbers up in Norway, Musk decides to cut supply - because of some problem with the delivery trucks. What a load of rubbish. I mean, why not just use different transporters? How do Mercedes, Lexus etc, etc manage to deliver their vehicles??? 'Tesla to slow deliveries in Norway'Musk: ""I have just asked our team to slow down deliveries. It is clear that we are exceeding the local logistics capacity due to batch build and delivery. Customer happiness & safety matter more than a few extra cars this quarter."""
"Elon Musk @twitter : I'm going to take TESLA private, bankrupcy secured."
600 broken! Up from here... short squeeze coming. Next stop 640 - 680 this week.
Actually Tesla is holding ground. It is down only -1.5%It is not bad comparing to its Chinese rivals at -5% and -7%
check out $INO run today. squeeze baby squeez!!
Why is TSLA still worth $300? Why do Jimmy Buffett concerts still sell out? This is what keeps me up at night.
"If the BTC hype can't even move the stock now, it tells you we are at the end of the road for the EV bubble. Watch the longs get stampeded as they rush for the exits."
More then likely will be a great long term buy but this gotta be FOMO and some lol healthy correction is needed. I can’t imagine people are adding to their positions or opening new positions at this expense. TSLA is about to have the market of FB on 1/3 the revenue 
YESSSSS!!!!!The only stock that’s making my portfolio above water!!
"Tesla on Friday 1/22/2021 sued former employee Alex Khatilov, a softwear engineer who worked at Tesla for less than 2 weeks over claims of stealing more than 6000 files of softwear Secrets Trade Code. The suit was filed in a U.S. District Court in California."
"Will be green by the time market opens. Last chance bears this ain’t going to 400, 500 or 550. This is easily over 1000 by may June time"
"tesla as a car company is overpriced. just like Amazon as a boon store is overpriced. tesla is leading the energy and self driving revolution. step aside haters, we bout to make money"
"5-to-1 split and join S&P500 should not affect a company's earnings. TSLA should go back to presplit price $1,500 or $300 post split very soon. We may see it drop 5% every day for three weeks to reach more reasonable valuation."
where's the $1000 they promised?
"I will say this hits 720 max between now and next week, but then it will burst, people will take their profits and hedgefunds, then it will settle to 450 which is a legitimate spot for it to be, it won’t run up to 1500 without doing that first....the burst IS coming"
"Something strikes me as ironic when the ""this stock doesn't trade on fundamentals"" crowd starts saying ""can't wait until earnings!"" -- I'm thinking, wait a minute..."
"if you don't own the stock why bother to comment, jealous maybe you missed out"
SEC announcement expected anytime
"Tesla earns more in EV credits every quarter than profits from car sales and energy storage. without EV credits, Tesla is still not profitable. I don't know when, but those credits will go away at which time Tesla will need to rely only on its business for profits. the current forward PE assumes that these credits are part of the business for the foreseeable future."
just bought another 10 shares I don't even care I know its going to make me money.
"I'm holding tesla for at least 5-20 years. there is no way I'm selling it. May be high P/E but buffet wouldn't of sold Coca cola or McDonald's would he? and Tesla will be a household name for many years to come. I don't believe In a diverse portfolio, buffet doesn't either. I hold Tesla and Vuzix the two companies that will change the way we live for at least the next ten years."
"""Tesla Slashes Prices Of Model 3, Model Y Base Variants""Sounds like demand is going swimmingly."
"Tesla dropped china Y model prices below competition to 52,000. This tells me Tesla really feeling the heat from competition most likely really good news for NIO... This is bad news for Tesla not food news as less profit margins for a company with P/E ratio of 1300. I expect Tesla stock price to start drop again. Tesla not the only battery car anymore...."
"Bulls win, Me crying..."
Close on day low. Good job.
"Covid vaccine ready for to be administered as early next week. Stocks will have a nice run. Go TESLA!!!! show me $1,000 SP"
Thumbs up if you shorted this bubble this week
The trend is not good for months ahead although I am bullish long term. Need another big announcement by Musk.
Pushed through $650!!!
Up 100$ in 24 hours!! Up more than Ford and GM Market cap combined!! Interesting!!
"qid up again, trades 2x nasdaq in opposite direction"
1 week and BTC & Stocks free fall. Hope these are just buying opportunities. But for all to plunge.
"Elon Musk has successfully led SpaceX to autonomous flights to ISS, I would bet on Elon to successfully deliver Full Self Driving here on earth. He has credibility! What has the shorties accomplished in their life? Jim Chanos, David Einhorn, Michael Burry...etc, they tried to destroy a visionary company."
We already know TSLA is going to blow by a 1T valuation. Real work is guessing when it will hit a 3T valuation. I'm thinking it should easily get there before 2021 is over. Anyone that doesn't think so is kidding themselves.
"Bitcoin thanks $TSLA & $SQ Bit is $50k+/- now :-)) oh & eyes on ACRX, ACRX starting to break that wall down!!"
I'm missing fingers at $340. Ouch!
Quote of the day - Good grief...So Tesla predicted deliveries one year in advance to within 0.1% with 11 price cuts and reported margins INCREASED on existing products with fixed depreciation and long term supply contracts. Anyone know the odds of that happening?
love TESLA
"Idea - turn the electron microscope off and just look at the big picture. a.) Tesla can make about 7,000 cars a week (being generous), that's 91,000 per quarter. b.) Selling 91,000 Tesla cars is not profitable. In Q2 they sold 95,200 and lost $400 million. c.) Tesla is cutting prices (the reason doesn't matter much - lower prices means less revenue.) . IMO trying to estimate deliveries, inventories, shipments, and the ever elusive ""demand"" is entertaining but not very meaningful. A Q3 operating loss is hardwired in."
How far can Tesla fall. Musk said Tesla was overvalued around May where adjusting for stock split was around $150 per share. So it can go down another 400-500 bucks and still remain in the overvalued range.
Time to buy some $BB. $TSLA $RYCEY $PYPL $SPCE will be my early retirement in 5 years!!!
"stock game over, only pfizer will do well under covid filled world"
"TSLA's forward PE is 206, but GM's forward PE is 8.6. Which is the better stock to hold and why?"
I want to see P/E 2000 before we go to 3000 after earnings report but maybe it will be so fast I won't be able to see it! Installing high speed camera to catch the moment!
If you can’t hold Tesla shares until the year of 2030. Sell it to someone who’s going long.
"Simbol Materials ===== the genius gets it wrong again(((( Musk's preliminary offer for the startup: $325 million, paid in Tesla stock. ))) Simbol is essentially defunct. The supposedly awesome technology fooled Musk."
Just a reminder for those who have not been paying attention to my posts the past several weeks....we will see $700 before we see $900 again. Just sayin'....in case you are looking for an entry point.

"For the shorts and bashers:Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is going to benefit so much from pent-up electric vehicle demand in China that one analyst says his best-case scenario for the stock will see it rocket 70% higher to $3,500 per share from its current price of $2,050. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives told investors in a note."
"Obviously the action on tesla is happening exactly as I said. Up a couple of days leading into 12-21-20 S&P 500 inclusion and then the air pocket on 12-21-20.Unfortunately, since there was some ambiguity in the when the funds would be buying; either up to the close on Friday, in premarket today, or in regular trading today, my buy to open order for the puts just slightly missed the target before the close on Friday.So all I'm left with is the an yuuuge amount of profits made on the tesla calls Thursday and Friday and no put holdings to make another an yuuuuge profit today, especialy with this fakecovid19 ""extra strain"" news the market is using to once again manipulate the stock market. Yes now that we have acure thedemocrats and MM's have come up with a new scheme to take away more of your freedoms and more of your money.But we shall endeavor to persevere on the puts.

Don’t buy tomorrow this will be 600
The only way to save Tesla is for Musk to show extreme humility and ask the World to forgive his behavior. Otherwise he is done and Tesla is done. BK is very near. MAYBE an established auto manufacturer can take them over after BK for pennies on the dollar and salvage what little they have in the way of name recognition. All other aspects of the company are not salvageable.
"Bill Clinton, reaching out to buck up Elon, very kind.Elizabeth shue, is going to take Elon dancing.Stock should be $550 be end of week."
"Elon and Cathie said a 1200 p/e didn't matter, all companies make their money from government subsidies, investing company money in Bitcoin instead of the company you run is a great idea. This ends as Dr Michael Burry said $50 or bankruptcy."
The valuation of TSLA should be no where close to Jeff Besos / Amazon!
"As I was sayin’... short and sweet correction. Very healthy. Now onward and upward.Those who missed the opportunity to buy are going to regret it big-time.The so-called analysts have no idea of how much this great company is worth. $10 trillion? $100 trillion? That’ll be just for starters.Then add in Elon Musk, and the valuation has to go up by 10x at least.You ain’t seen nothing yet."
Tesla's stock chart is going to look like the Nokia stock between year 1999 to 2001
"Amc is big jump today, get in and catch a few"
"It feels like certain parties are working very hard to make sure this doesn't close below $800 (over the past 3 weeks). Is this just a natural support level, that happens to get filled in before close each day TSLA is down? Or is this deliberate? Cant tell if Im imagining things...."
"Incoming rate hike any day now. Feds must be nervous looking at Tesla's stock market bubble, Tesla abandoning fiat for crypto and its wider implications, and the crypto bubble. Once Fed signals the hike the bubble will burst and the stock will crash."

"A month ago, TSLA reached a new high below $700. Since then, it has gone up with no positive news, just the blind hope for an exceptional earnings report, or, more probably, some new promises for the future from Elon. Neither has happened. There is just no excuse for this stock to be above $700 even if you thought it was really worth more than $600 back in December. And the only reason for it moving up to the $600's from the low $400's back in November is the technical issue of inclusion in the S&P 500 which forced certain funds to buy TSLA even though it was already shamefully overpriced.We haven't seen anything like a real drop in this stock yet. A most a correction, not a Bear market.Even crediting that Musk and TSLA make NO mistakes over the next 3 years and that the projected EPS is 10 times actual 2020 GAAP earnings, that's only $6.40/share fully diluted. GM has made as much money while trading in the $30's.Un reasoning mob mentality may prevail over the short run, but, eventually most members of the mob come to a point where they will stop and think for themselves. The pump and dumper what you to believe you should never sell, because that leaves plenty of time for them to dump before the price really crashes."

"Tesla investor are whining about Tesla's decision to invest $1.5 billion in bitcoin. The $1.5 billion would have been sitting in the bank earninga a fraction of 1% or something relatively small for interest. With Bitcoi, $1.5 billion just made over 560 million yesterday. And what about from the time Tesla bought in January when it was only $34,000. The valuation it mades will show in the balance sheet as profit on next quarterly earnings. Bitcoin is risky and volatile but it starting to get support from big company and its times for Corporation to reap the profits of the liquid assets instead of the bank loaning their money to someone else."
should close at $600 today
When market opens and everyone gets to buy it’s going to make a run $750

"It is amazing the lengths that Tesla goes to put its customers safety at risk. First there is Autopilot, and now the refreshed Model S and Y. The car ""guesses"" what gear it should be in. Many accidents are likely to happen, and it is almost a guarantee that Tesla will deny responsibility for all of them. Steering wheel is a joke too."

"People keep saying that Tesla is more than a car company. Well, auto revenues grew by 31% YoY, thanks mostly to a huge growth in regulatory credit sales, while revenues for everything else Tesla does only grew by 16%. Such minuscule growth considering that energy deployment grew by more than 80%. It just goes to show that the energy section is a drag on earnings, and always will be. Tesla would be much better served by divesting that part of its business."
"As warren buffet said “be greedy when others are fearful”. Look at this board, my god. I’m debating putting my entire account in Tesla"
Good bye Tesla. Bank O time!
Tesla ER will show a profit even excluding regulatory credits. Trump will dominate the national conversation even though he's not president. Media knows it. Beijing Biden is a low energy non-entity who is quickly overwhelmed especially because of dementia. Then what will shorts have left to argue?

Tesla trades and acts like cell phone makers. Cell phones are replaced every 2 yrs. Tesla useful life is also 2Yrs.
Same old TSLA. Back to going up during trading hours and some more during AH. GO TSLA...!!!
America=Tesla!!! Love it.
Tesla had an incredible run. I remember October 2019 is a $255 before earnings blowout they never look back remember they had a five for one split. Pre-split tesla stock is over $4500. From 250. oct ￼￼￼ 2019
Just imagine....The real TSLA growth story has not even begun yet. TSLA hits $2 trillion mkt. cap by 2024. Guaranteed.

does someone can predict how much shorts will lose this year on TSLA (38B last year)? I guess about 20B this year since some of shorts were bankrupted already...
"If you observe Elon Musk since his paypal days (many articles, YouTube vdos, blogs etc)...u will realize that this man is Genious but crazy mad and takes extreme risks to achieve in what he believes.He is insanely brilliant...many say after Einstein, he is THE guy. May be such appreciation is a bit of exaggeration but when you watch his vdo about Neuralink and the detailed technicalities that he explains, one definitely developes a kind of admiration. He knows, understands, develpes and works hands-on on the complex technical issues. If Neuralink succeeds in their mission, may be after a decade or so, they will make Tesla's success look like peanuts.In over two decades, he has spun out life changing, futuristic technology companies (and have ACTUALLY made them successful for the masses) like PayPal, Boring company, Hyperloop, SpaceX, Tesla Solar roof, Tesla EV, Neuralink....all of these concepts may be century old but its the exceution with success that matters. Though the world may be opening up to the Brand of Elon Musk now and may be the shorts telling Tesla stock going to tank big time have some truth in their prediction BUT noway its gonna change this momentum which is far bigger than Tesla stocks. Even if it tanks, it will be up and running in no time...Some say that Tesla stocks are rising coz market is realizing the potential of Elon and not just Tesla. Imagine how much Apple stocks would have soared had Steve Jobs been alive. As they say...his time has come."

"Not much upside and 80-90% chance that top hit at 880$. IBD advised that 6/7 indicators showed that Tesla is reaching a climax run. After a climax run, comes a BIG pullback.P/E ratio- all time highP/S ratio- all time highRSI- off by one point from 2013 all time highTesla expected to make 31B in revenue but has a 800B market cap!! If anyone can find any other stock that has ever done this in the history of stocks (tech, auto, whatever) please give me the name. Apple disrupted the cell phone market when they developed the first touch screen iPhone (35B in revenue at the time - 175B market cap), Amazon disrupting brick and mortar business (amongst all other things)(had a 3600 p/e at one point but were making 55-60B in revenue and had a ~150B market cap), Google- I’m sure you’ve heard of them (highest p/e they ever had was around mid 50s), Netflix disrupting streaming business (traded at a about 450 P/E at their highest, while making close to 4B in revenue and had a 45B market cap- highest PS ratio of about 12). So just compare Tesla to any other major tech company and you’ll see the insane overvaluation here (even though as it stands Tesla makes most of their money from selling cars!). Up close to 900% since March. People need to get a close look and see that numbers like that can only be compared to .com bubble. Welcome to the EV bubble. You have companies like NKLA with no revenue valued close to 10B. There’s a new EV company every other day and competition is EVERYWHERE. Tesla could sit at this price for the next 3-5 (or more) years and still be grossly overvalued.Reality is Tesla is expected to make 31B this year, 45B next year and 65B in 2023. With this growth, fair value they should be around 300-400B market cap and that’s still being very generous. Don’t worry, there was plenty of blind FOMO buyers in the .com bubble as well. They would speak the same language as the pumpers here. Keep in mind that it took investors 10-15 years to make their money back (and that’s if they invested in amazon). Looks like history will repeat itself. This coming earnings report should do the job! Y’all better hope they smash expectations by at least 100%! Since they barely met 2020 delivery expectations, I expect a modest beat at best, then let the massive selling begin (sell the news)!Leaving off with this. On 12/3 Musk stated to his employees that Tesla needs “to cut costs or the firm's stock price could be “crushed like a soufflé under a sledgehammer.” - that was around 550$ SP. Well we’re now ~55% higher and I am sure Tesla didn’t magically make any drastic changes to their cost cutting within a month. Should be a big warning sign "

JP Morgan raised price target to $788.
"Ya know, I've been reading a lot of these comments and many people seem to think there will be a lot of people who sell next week to lock in their profits and put off paying taxes on the gain for a year.I see a flaw or two in that logic.First, why would someone sell to lock in a profit when the stock continues to go up and you can put a trailing stop loss in place to protect against any downside loss?Secondly, this is assuming you hold the stock in a taxable account which leads me to this question -What type of account do you hold your Tesla stock in?1. Taxable account2. Traditional IRA3. Roth IRA4. Rollover IRAOur 500 shares are held in my wife's rollover IRA so we will never pay taxes until she take qualified distributions.So I'm not too convinced about a selloff for tax purposes. I see absolutely no reason for anyone to sell right now.Just out of curiousity, what type of account do you hold your shares in?"
And when Tesla skyrockets you bearish people are nowhere to be found

Of course there will be massive dilution to current shareholders."

When Cathie Wood reiterated the $4k target the other day it was a secret code signal to her hedge fund buddies to sell and fast...  Did anyone else pick up the signal or was it just me?....
"Recommendation: Wait, and buy later, after a couple of months until we know the true stock value. Everyone knows it rose top high too quick with all the uncertainty that's around the EV-market."
Elon can sell and raise capital with BTC investment now instead of diluting shares. Plus you can buy a TSLA products now with BTC. The value of the dollar is tanking while value of BTC is mooning. Hedge against inflation and storage of value. Elon is a genius. That $1.5B will turn into $7B at the end of 2021. More $$$ for the company long term.
"Yep $GS is on the wrong side of the $TSLA trade it appears. They are about to lose big. They are now essentially admitting that Q2 will beat expectations for sure. Now they are projecting the future q by q which was clearly wrong the last q. Of course with new company and disruptive tech, its hard to get to that reliable and stable place quickly. There is brand recognition (the cool factor) and there is demand. tesla is figuring out how to make cars cheaply and meet the demands, and manage the profitability. Mind you they are still increasing their productioncapacity for the foreseeable future"
talk about doubling in 2.25 months way-2-go $NIO dont think Tesla will be growing this fast. Would like to see Cathie Wood of ARK Invest swap out some of her $TSLA for $NIO
How many people on the planet have:Bought a new roof and car in the same month?Bought a new roof and car in the same year?Bought a new roof and car in their lifetime?How many Tesla car customers actually own a roof to replace?You'd have to be the biggest dummy in the world to believe there is a big cross selling opportunity. A true con man.
"Wow! ""Goldman Sachs predicts Musk might need to raise $10B in debt to stay afloat""With another $10B I could stay afloat too, despite being married to my wife."
Is anyone still short at $288? and did anyone sell GM at $45?
Nio delivered 75000 vehicles. If you divide the market caps per produced vehicles. Nio trade at a 36% discount to Tesla.Nio announced a 150kWh battery. That's double than the Tesla. Solid state. Replaceable battery.It doesn't take a lot of imagination to see that the competition not only comes fast it will also surpass Tesla very soon.Go figure where Tesla's stock will go.
This is not gonna' end well.
Just as I've posted about $tsla not being as good as AMD yet having huge valuation as a tech company without earnings per share this came in... sell Tesla buy AMD ahead of earnings.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-registrations/new-tesla-registrations-in-california-nearly-halves-in-fourth-quarter-data-idUSKBN1ZF03N
how does one aquire hundreds of millions of $$$ of tesla stock? asking for the s&p 500
Is it going to 1000 still? I’ve been waiting
Buying is running out of steam....this is looking like a correction may be coming before moving up again...
the JP Morgan analyst is just a sheister. This is gonna rebound tomorrow so hard
"NOTICE: For the past 2 months, I regularly posted that we would see $700 before we see $900 again so that you could plan for a buy-in point. We broke $700 and I hope you took advantage of the incredible opportunity to buy more TSLA stock."
This is a joke. Tesla going up as if had already placed stellar results.Selling now and waiting to buy at 450 tomorrow
Over 700 plus pre market let’s go fam 
Lol just wait for the autonomous vehicle announcement... the Tesla rocket is still fueling up. Takeoff 2021! 
"I'm a big Tesla supporter, but I think Musk should stay away from speculating in Bitcoin. Next thing you know they will say they are accepting Green stamps and magic beans for purchase of a Tesla. He's going to hurt investor confidence, when you miss earnings is not the time to be making speculative investments, you have to regain your cred."
Tesla is fortunate that it won't have to take the hit to earnings for the touchscreen problem recall this quarter.I've seen estimated cost of the recall between $300 and $500 million
"Relax Emilio, just sit back and collect the dividend... "
"“If you want to buy Tesla, buy Tesla,” Arnott said. “Have an exit strategy. Have a reason in mind in advance for what’s going to cause you to sell.”"
"So Elon's plan to fudge this quarter is a Bitcoin pump and dump. All of you lemmies chasing him into bitcoin.....watch, the cliff!"
"I can see why Tesla would be hesitant about expanding into India: - the luxury car segment is small with sales of approximately 35,000 in 2019 - the large majority of cars that do exist are on the smaller side (compacts and crossovers) - For 2018-2019, motor vehicle sales included 21.28 M two-wheelers, 3.38 M passenger cars, 701,000 three-wheelers - Amazon selected three-wheelers for their delivery vehicles in India - Only 22 of every 1,000 people own a car in India, compared to 980 of every 1,000 US citizens - SAIC does business in India as well and may already have plans to introduce something akin to the SAIC-GM-Wuling mini there - India doesn’t have the up-front readiness that China had in its adoption of EVs"
Elon musk's calculated bet on Bitcoin has helped secure nearly an additional billion dollars for the company. Elon musk has taken his Capital raise and multiplied it to expand Tesla. I don't know how you can possibly bet against this man.
Great Stock! Hold on long term!
They say Musk is able to move markets with tweets. How come those tweets doesn't move his own company's stock?
"On Tesla forum today a man related that his wife was hit from behind on the highway. Her Model 3 shut down immediately, and display said ""Cannot maintain vehicle power"". The brakes stopped working so the car could not be stopped before it hit a wall and another car. The airbags didn't work either and she was injured. His wife is too scared to ever drive a Tesla again. This is serious. Is Anybody willing to risk family in one of these cars? Safest car ever?"
"Man, just watched Musk's interview with 60 minutes. Makes me want to buy more shares even at this price. He seems very genuine about what he does."
Tomorrow will be another good day with 2-4 percent rise I guess.
"With just 4 or 5 buys in AMC, Daddy Elon can dish out some hard lessons to the same short gang that nearly bk'd tsla at 180.00 a share.Yes they were cheating and shorting without merit at that level.Their are more kids and new investors loaded up in AMC and waiting on Elon than any other stock.Wall street bets....from 2.2 million members to 7.5 in not even a week.Even Sektor is impressed.Chamath has apparently given some hints to the youngins, he might come in.Regardless, hard to imagine Daddy Elon does not come in with Lamborghini money buys.The setup already did all the work for Daddy Elon.Chinese owned company means chinese retail and hedge funds come. And the Japanese are quick to copy those trades.Sometimes in life, you have to risk a lot to get a lot.It is my opinion that if you take off weight or numerous calls on AMC, you are not likely to get it back.I really, really like bbby and I like AMC, twenty times heavier.Sektor"
"In 2017 Ford made $8.4 Billion on $156 Billion in revenue. Yesterday TSLA traded higher than Ford while losing $1B on $10B in revenue and is failing at its requirement to grow irrationally. go figure.Now that it's apparent that Tesla does not have magic manufacturing Silicon Valley pixie dust, it should trade according to the rest of the auto industry. That is:$50 or less. potentially adjusted down back to $25-$30 for instability."
Come on Shorts! We’re counting on you!
I’m in love with this stock for the next 10 years
Stay long. This is only temporary.
"Black proposes Apple take a stake in Tesla, and Tesla accelerates the Apple car development, having it ready by 2022 and not 2024. It’s a little like Tesla becoming for Apple in cars what Foxconn is for Apple in phones."
"If I wanted to go long Tesla, why would I buy it here with the stock up almost 70% YTD while we are in a deep recession and unemployment is surging? Seriously, can anyone provide a rational answer? Why not wait for the stock to fall to much lower levels before buying?"
"Will Elon Musk be listed on Tesla's next 10K as ""Known Risks""?"
Seeing it jump yesterday 10% with the after-hours like 70 billion dollars made me realize that this ponzi is very hard to predict and the people involved are orchestrating this. A jump at this valuation in a day is like 50% when it was 5 times lower. Just imagine not even 1 year ago on no news a jump of 50% in a day. Don't you think there's something odd about this? This is a scam both for longs and shorts.
You will see 100M shares trade in the last 30 minutes of trading today
You'll be getting a proxy vote by end of the year. Musk twitter
I bet when the shorts woke up this morning that they didnt imagine that they would be in this position and I would be in mine. Sorry for your losses in advance...
"My son took me to Brownsville 77 Expressway & Exit Olmito around 7pm last Wednesday. I ask him: ""why are we here?"" He said: ""Its a surprise!"" In about 100 feet, Future Tesla Dealership appeared. I was screaming, happy, and excited to see the spacious exterior with trees on huge parking lot are done and group of people were so focus working at the interior of the building."
BUY BEFORE Q4 EARNINGS CALL
"Analysts at JPMorgan said Friday they remained “highly cautious” on Tesla due to its stock valuation, but they raised their price target on the stock to $125 from $105, the lowest among FactSet-surveyed analysts.“While still suggestive of large downside, we do not regard our price target as ungenerous as it actually values Tesla as the world’s second largest automaker by market capitalization, behind Toyota and ahead of Volkswagen despite these automakers each currently selling on the order of magnitude of 20x as many vehicles annually as Tesla,” the JPMorgan analysts, led by Ryan Brinkman, said in their note."
Tesla will hit $2000 in 2021. Long Tesla
Better buy $TSLA
De listing from S&P coming....
Tesla kept raising funds not mainly for biz development but for Bitcoin speculations. This is really worrying given many competitors target to catch-up or surpass Tesla by 2025 or earlier
"since last year, $TSLA has fallen from 4th place to 51st place (dead last) in the reputation rankings in norway due to quality, reliability, and service concerns.anyone ever seen a fall this extreme?anyone ever seen a brand recover from it?"
"Didn't realize Tesla's price cuts in Europe we so severe: In Germany, the Model 3 price fell 4,000 euros, and in France the price dropped by as much as 6,000 euros."
"There is a yt interview with a young guy his IRA is over $29M from TSLA. and was as low as $2,700. He was a former support personnel at a brokerage firm. In the video he says most of the options being sold are from Market Makers that are doing delta hedging strategy. Look at the 36min mark when he starts talking. video title: Going from $2,700 to $29 million. anyways sort of interesting to hear. check it out."
"Tesla delivered nearly 140,000 vehicles in Q3, giving it an annual run rate of about 50% higher than its 2019 delivery total. Its operating margin approached double-digit territory. For more hot stocks like (TSLA) just go to (http://trade-view.com)."

"Great News ==== Tesla sales are down double digits in Europe. Europe buys about 15 MILLION cars every year. So far Tesla has sold only 58,000 units Tesla has about 0% of the EU auto market. Tesla has about 6% of the EV segment but that is down from 15% last year. Summary: Tesla's price cuts did not help much."

"Crypto mining and management can contribute to carbon emissions without improving living standards, since individuals or teams use computing power and specialized software to produce Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed in an email that Fremont Factory car production line is up and running as of yesterday Feb 25 after parts supply shortage.
Tesla is a robotics stock. Comparing Tesla to other car manufacture’s is like comparing Amazon to Barnes and Noble (a book seller).
"Above $594 is bullish. Under that, there is one support."
robinhood announces tesla squeeze is next. Look for 4000/shr. Bettors plan to buy 200b worth in fast succession.
Tesla still too overvalued.
"Musk feeling he needed to state that Model S and X are still in high demand, is like John Travolta holding a press conference to state he is not gai (sic)."
Here comes the start of the Tesla bubble popping!! Just like GME and AMC...how many of you have margin calls soon?? Once you get that email you’ll feel 
"Buying opportunity coming, don’t panic"
Teslas valuation should not be like this. This will make the stock very volatil if even small expectations arent met. Many investors will loose money because of this. Its legal but its near to manipulation.
$790.00 & above!!!!
"Musk attempts to make a joke: ""Only costs that actually apply to Q3 & beyond will be counted. It would not be correct to apply historical cost savings to current quarter.""Historical cost savings? Ah, I see, the refunds.hahahaha, Elon, that was a good one."
boost in premarket due to millions profited over the weekend......huge collaboration between elon and cathie.....they timed the bitcoin just right.....pushed close to 856 million combined bitcoin profits....amazing what having huge capital can do.....good job elon and cathie.....it was worth the cup of joe you met over.....tesla to 1k.....
"There's no liquidity in this thing. There are no shares to sell. If you've got 100 people bidding for one share, well this is what happens. People are treating Tesla stock like a glass of water to a thirsty man who has been trapped in the desert. The blow off top is in progress now. We could hit $1200 or even higher before it finally does pop. How much is a tulip bulb worth anyway?"

Kudos to Musk and the Space X people. That launch was inspiring and was America at its best.
"Be careful guyss! I don’t want all of you losing money, the market cap this company has doesn’t reflect current revenue or anything about other ventures. Market cap represents Tesla in 5 yearsSome major investor will sell their shares and this will create doomsday. Just be careful, everyone’s likes making moneyI might get dislikes but this is true. (I’m a big fan of Tesla and made a lot with their shares)"
The was a good experience to see how they did that. Education well worth the roller coaster ride

"When tsla lowered their Q4 guidance earlier, the price already dropped from 350 down to 308. The actual earning & rev is better than the lowered guidance. No reason drop again. Expect up tomorrow."
"Here is a warning. Be cautious on China. Sales of Tesla cars are doubling in China. But note China is beating up Tesla on quality. That is a signal for for Tesla not to become too big, to strong. CCP and Commerce will in the end support their domestic EV manufacturers to the point regulating, or subsidising their domestic manufacturers. If you need an example of regulating and controlling, look at what they have done to Alibaba's Jack Ma. And he is their own. To big, to strong, to dominating is not a good position to be in China."

"By the end of 2018, Musk all but promised (100% no doubt) 10K Model 3's per week, to be produced at Fremont. I'll do the math for you..., that's over 500K, for one model, one plant. Here we are, two years later, hoping for only 500K, across 4 models, two plants. Grossly lowering guidance, then barely meeting it, is not a solid sustainable business plan. Do not confuse impressive share price gains, with non-impressive production gains."
"Ford, sold 4.6 millions cars in 2020 and has a Market capitalisation of $47 billion, TSLA sold 0.5 millions cars with a MC of $700 billion.$70 price target for Tesla still bigger than Ford and Quantum Scape combined at $68 billion.My believe $70/share is an ok valuation, assuming No Chinese, Korea's, Europeans or Japanese competition exists."
"Tesla upgraded today with price target of $1,000 by Fomo-brah Brokerage in Tokyo."

"I’m all for electric vehicles, but once electric vehicles begin to dominate the landscape, is there a plan to recover the lost fuel tax revenues (appx 100 billion/year).

How many Texans will be ringing Teslas bell for a solar roof and powerwall. And a cool CyberTruck to boot
"This got us thinking about Tesla's $1.8bn of high yield bonds, maturing in August 2025. Last time Alex Scaggs checked on their health in May, it didn't look too pretty -- the debt was trading at 88 cents on the dollar in the secondary market, suggesting the so-called smart money of Wall Street foresaw a dim future for Tesla.Given the renewed optimism in the equity, we'd expect the bonds to follow, seeing as bondholders have primacy over shareholders when it comes to claims on Tesla's future cash flows.This week however, the bonds have not followed suit, despite roughly tracking the equity over the past month."

"SAKHO, still at his minimum wage job, can’t afford a share. Still talking the same game of P/E ratio, dude the game has changed just like the auto propulsion system. It’s a new age."
Either Elon has completely lost his mind or he’s got something up his sleeve. His behavior during conference call last night was certainly bizarre. I wonder if deep down he knows the end is coming within a year and starting to act even more strange.

"Why will TSLA model 3 sales drop sharply? Most who booked Tesla, wanted it for ($35K - $7.5K). If these are available only after 6 months, there will be no -$7.5K - which means tons of cancellation."

"Can Tesla bulls explain to me why they think any of Tesla's supposed ""businesses"" - cars, solar/energy, battery, and robotaxis are actually great businesses to be in? Of course there are profits to be made there, but all are capital intensive, slow-to-scale and low margin. Hypothetically assuming Tesla dominates each of these industries (it won't), why does it deserve a tech company valuation on a bunch of hard goods, commoditized businesses?Do you know what are excellent businesses? ? Easily scalable software and platforms. Like FANG"
"The current paid bashers on this board remind me of the $TSLA board from late 2019 and all throughout 2020. They NEVER stopped bashing, even as Tesla rose from the $80 range to the current $4000 range pre split. And they’re still there bashing, to this very date. They will never stop. But like them, we will never stop also. Can’t stop. Wont stop. To the moon."

"To people comparing Apple's earnings to Tesla's, you need to understand a few things. #1 these are quarterly numbers, #2 TSLA's share price is 6x that of Apple and for that it delivered less than 1/2 the EPS on a Non-GAAP basis and less than 1/6 the EPS on a GAAP basis.These companies and their cash generation ARE NOT REMOTELY IN THE SAME LEAGUE."

Look at the history of past financial bubbles. Moves like buying TSLA buying bitcoin are common in the final phases as the promoters sense a loss of momentum in the prices and seek some device to pump up prices more.
I almost can not wait. Just got notice from my app. My Tesla charge is complete. Had my coffee grabbing my lunch. I just want to take the Long way to work and drive my Tesla. I flat out Love my Tesla Model Y Performance. I have never felt like this about a car or truck. This car is amazing. Thank you Tesla. You could have raised the price another $65k and it still would have been a bargain. Invest in this company and you will be happy. Service. I took my car in for service because I scratched my rim. They treated me like they cared and wanted to solve the problem. Picked my car up the next day and service was Great.10k miles on my car and no issues other than me driving and scratching the rim while parking. I should have let the car park itself it does a better job driving than I do. Full Self Driving on interstate or heavy stop and go rush hour traffic is like an afternoon nap arrive relaxed and happy. All meetings I have been in since owning this car have been very very positive. My personal production is way up.
When you see crazy valuations of the companies like TSLA is when you realize what a joke US stock market is. However it does make you money thou
"Hey, here's a question: why would $TSLA *lose* money on its (fraudulent) guidance of 90,000 to 100,000 Q2 deliveries??? Is it saying it can't even be profitable at THAT (fictional) run-rate? - ANSWER...YES!"
For sure Tesla will drop $70 tomorrow morning after 15 min after market opens
Barrons article today. QS severely oversold. It is worth 100/shr with over 100b in signed contracts.

EVs are a fad at this stage of the game. The major portion of electric to charge them still comes from fossil fuels. The only way EVs will be sustainable and worth value is if they become 100% solar. Even if that was possible today Big Oil will not permit it to happen. Research the Fish Carburetor.

im a believer of Tesla that it will hit 1000 soon but sadly i sold off all today. Terrible decision for adding bitcoin. disappointed. im out.
"What people don't understand is Tesla is not an auto company or tech company it is a dimension disrupter and is leading humanity into the final frontier - space itself. Elon has freed us from the straitjacket of mundane reality and has shown us that our sci fi dreams can become a reality. Nerds and basement dwellers, man-bunned latte drinkers and bearded brahs have a way out that just doesn't involve game consoles and another hit of the bong. What price can you put on such a stock - it is Disney, Apple and Star Trek all rolled into one. Target Price - Infinity"
"What's funny is that even if Robinhooders somehow agreed to sell en mass (like that have done to hold), they wouldn't be able to sell their shares at price anywhere near the current market price. At this point they're bound to see their VIRTUAL gains evaporate soon, no matter what they do or try to do. Inclusion in the index will see Tesla undergo huge tectonic transformation, the way it's valuated and the way it trades."
Shareholders here are BAMBOOZLED. ( i often do not use that word in my volcabulary.)
WOW. TSLA will drop fast when the market opens. People will lose at least 5 %

They must be kidding..........If you want a roadster (may be in 2020).........you must put down $250K NOW.........Sorry......NO - By 2020 there will be no roadster and likely no TSLA.........and good luck seeing your money again.
"Sorry, correct me if I am wrong but is it not the smart play to cash out on TESLA and buy NIO? considering that NIO is 5-10 years behind TESLA and actually has a brand new market in China to sell to and China is actually more pro EV than the USA is? Did TESLA not pave the way for NIO to be a 300-700$ stock one day.....especially after NIO is delivering 500k EVs per year....say in like 2023-2024? i don't know, seems like a no brainer to me....."
"Someday, we will wake up to a headline (could be any one of the following) to the effect of 'tencent reduced holding in tesla''model 3 production is horrific''there is little demand for model3''tesla to raise 1.5 billion in capital'and the sp will fall $30 in premarket trading"
Forget Tesla. Porsche and BMW all electric next year.
I wonder what will happen to the stock price if the14 price cuts of their cars has an impact on margins?? Hmmm?
My Puts on #TSLA and Calls on #PLUG are printing baby!
"When taking into account my entire family, we all have made a combined more than 600 grand off TSLA. Shorts will never make that kind of money. If TSLA was the only stock you ever owned and you owned enough of it you could hang up your business suit and retire to Florida. It's that simple. Whereas being a short you will at best have pocket change, at worst be broke and homeless. It's all a matter of deciding which lifestyle you would rather lead: a rich retiree or someone flying a sign at a highway exit. The logical choice to anyone with a brain is obvious."
"Can we all agree that promoting Jerome Guillen, to handle Automotive day-to-day operation, is a good thing and partially responsible for the morning uptick? They announced this on Friday night."
Tesla is another bitcoin 
Ford in a month taking almost 4k cars ev sales from Tesla with Mach e now that's just the start imagine once chip issue is resolved ? I still did not get my Mach e yet even though I am on the list in 2000s . don't make sense they delivered 3700 cars and not mine while I was the 2000s. oh well. GM is coming to take on Tesla sales too and many more
Look at a chart and tell me why you still hold Tesla?
Where's chanos?
so Elon closed factory for 18 days and offers only weeks pay for employee better yet he tells them to volunteer in other parts of the company since they will not be working . Elon what a cheap sob.

"When I look at TSLA, I think of CSCO. On a split adjusted basis, one could have bought Cisco at less than 10 cents a share when it first traded publicly in March 1990. By Jan. 1992, it had almost tripled. By Jan. 1994, it had double about twice more. By 1996, it had doubled again. In Jan 1998, it reached a high of $10.79/share. Two years later,, in Jan. 2000, Cisco had doubled again. It reached it's all time high of $82/share in March 2000. In Jan 2002, it's monthly high was only $21.84. In September 2002, it reached a low of $10.48. Today, CSCO trades around $44. If you had bought CSCO in January 2000 and held on over 20 years to today, you would have a loss. If you bought CSCO in January 1999, You would have a modest profit (something more than a 50% gain over 23 years and would not have kept up with the S&P 500.If you bought CSCO back in January 1998 (more than 2 years before the peak), your investment would have doubled twice, but that's only about a 7% annual rate of return and just about average for the market.CSCO reached a market cap over $500 billion at its peak in 2000. It now has a market cap less than $200 billion.CSCO was no Enron. It has shown growth in annual earnings every year for 20 years."
Don’t short Tesla. You will be broke. Many did.
wow! just starting to take off.. here comes 1000
Ok I guess this is up 5% because Elon sold a bunch of hats? Seems legit.....
PEOPLE: the more TSLA bashers you see on this board only CONFIRMS you are investing in the RIGHT company. Your CONVICTION is spot on. The bashers are shills and they are worried MASSIVE disruption is coming. HOLD!!!!
"Tesla stock retreated, but after appearing to go on a climax run, the electric car maker is looking anti-climactic, which is a good thing."
HISTORICAL CRASH IS STARTING NOW !!!!!!
"With all due respect, it looks like Nio is going to market a better product than Tesla"
"Drone shots of the construction of the Berlin Tesla factory. They are being taken by a young man (14) who is apparently an enthusiast for the project in his area. An article pointing to this site said the local Green Party approved of the project but a local activist described his objections. Tesla's pledge to plant 3X times as many trees as they have to cut and to protect a couple of local species is mentioned also. There are shots of the factory that show the surrounding forest also. But all the trees are the same size and generation, look planted, and not that old. It looks as though it was clear cut maybe a century ago.https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChIAb-YiTMCPRxb1fS6VDiw"
Yahoos 1y target is like half where it is today. Morgan Stanley's estimate from 2 days ago was surpassed today. One can't publish estimates fast enough.
Tesla stock trades at 1000 * earninings maybe tech stocks have valuations that are independent of earnings ?What do you think ?
"End of the week, $700"
"I want to start learning stocks and how to know when to invest, any tips of sources I can use to learn?"

"Tesla is forming a massive wedge, it's going to break out to the upside soon enough! the bears keep spewing their verbal diaherra all day long on this forum, it has no effect to the share price or the share holders. happy Friday tesla fam. "
"I’d be wary about investing in TSLA at this level, when competition is overtaking their marketshare at a drastic pace in every major EV market, especially internationally, with negative growth"
I personally feel the open interest on expiration tomorrow will propel this share price even higher tomorrow! $900 coming
TIMBER
i think there are still many brave small investors on the market who support the tesla share. and the big ones are using it now to sell their shares without it going down a lot. It is not for nothing that all analysts raise their course targets here. and the brave retail investors are ultimately punished
I don't think people relying on stimulus are worried about buying stocks... I keep seeing robinhooders and stimulus mentioned. Makes no sense.
"What Tesla really needs to do to re-ignite its growth engine is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for Tesla (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if Tesla just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

"Told ya to sell Tesla and buy Apple ... good news, still time to do"
What's the matter Tesla shorters? Did the sudden swing back up give you whiplash? You lot better go cover the stuff you shorted yesterday and hopefully make $50 profit from your shorting endeavor!

"The best EV company in the world is NIO. Growing faster, better technology and still much more upside!"
"This stock is certainly in bubble territory and someone is going to get caught at the top. Just do a comparison between Apple and Amazon. Both innovative and massively growth companies, that are literally everywhere. When they had 600+B market caps, they were raking in 100s of billions of dollars and more profits than what Tesla makes. Meanwhile, Tesla is expected to hit 30B in revenue for 2020 Qs and 45B in revenue by the end of this year. Very understandable that Musk and Tesla are revolutionary, but so was Apple. When they released the first iPhone in 07, was Apple trading at a p/e of 1500+ and 27x sales?! This isn’t a growth company that’s expected to triple their revenue this year. They had a 26% increase in revenue from last year and are expected to increase 45% by the end of this year. Solid growth, but this evaluation is just insane and reality will hit. The FOMO is through the roof here and never mind all of the competition in the EV industry."
"Apple's revenue is barely $300B.Apple's market cap is $2T.Apple is considered a tech company.Conservatively assume TSLA will produce 10M cars in 2030.If average car price is ~$35,000 (before FSD software), this makes $350B in revenue.FSD alone can have ~$50B (if half of the car buyers include FSD).Energy business will generate ~$200B in revenue.If you add revenues from robotaxi, insurance, HVAC etc., the revenue can very well reach $700~800B.Assume TSLA is valued as a tech company (for the sake of argument).Do 6~7 multiple (I think it'll be higher) to the revenue, then TSLA will be worth ~$5T by 2030.That is about $5000 in stock price compared to current market cap.you can argue and nitpick each number I present here, but if TSLA becomes the disruptor in EV and Energy business as it claims it will, you'll be happy if you buy the stock now and hold for the next decade.But, it's just my humble opinion."
This might have been what Musk was talking about when he said weeks ago that shorts were about to get hammered.
"Posted by FastFire:""Idiots are those those whom do not realize that cars with batteries AND ICE engines are still classified as EVs, and yes, they use oil.""... in other words he literally believes that Tesla cars not only need oil but have INTERNAL COMBUSTION (GAS) ENGINES hahahahaHopefully this will help longs not take anything said by shorts too seriously as they're clearly missing a part of their brains..."
"After seeing that pileup in Fort Worth, my first thought was I can't wait until the Tesla semi is on the roads. My second thought was, how would I survive that? I came up with a few ideas and replied to Elon's latest tweet and messaged Tesla, but I don't think it will make it to Elon's attention. If any of you here think this is a viable idea and you can move it up the attention chain, please do. Here's what I am proposing:1. Increase the strength of Tesla's survival cells to be equal to or greater than an F1 car. I know this initially sounds crazy, but the Tesla material science team has already made new alloys, and the SpaceX engineers are also world class material scientists. I bet they can make a composite honeycomb that could at least triple the current survival cell strength without increasing weight. 2. In a highway pileup situation where tractor trailers are unsighted (fog, dust storm, snow storm, a hill, a curve, etc.) Tesla Autopilot could could send a geofenced alert to a free phone app that would warn everyone within a mile of stopped highway traffic with a unique alarm sound. 3. Use the 360 degree array of sensors to detect side or rear collisions and sound an alarm, pretension the seat belts, preposition the headrests and maybe, if it is helpful - deploy one or more external kevlar airbags to optimally increase the surface area of the collision and direct the forces in a manner that the safety cell is most effective."
How’s that short position working for you? Great logic. Must be that super insightful PE argument or the comparative Tesla market cap point.
shorts cover now or $700 next week
Already gaining in premarket watch this flip GREEN by eod! Shorts  forgot the innumerable times it happened before....

"New Year Greeting from your friend - a TSLA long term investor:Hello shorts, Greetings, Happy New year. Just want to say hello on this new year from the West Coast. I have been doing some reflection in the new year day, and I have some conclusions about my personal life, as well as my investments including TSLA stocks. And I just would like to share with you some of my reflections because it is related to you ladies/gentlemen who is shorting TSLA. I punderstand why you are upset after such a record year in all fronts for TSLA, a record breaking business results, stock at all time high, stock price x7 in one year, largest shorting loss ever. Please understand, we long term investors have not done anything intentional to make you upset. We have invested in a good stock, and it's been good to us, and we just try our best to defend the stock we own with what we consider as fake new and stories.I have heard all kinds of name calling toward me: cult members, greedy, immoral, fat pig get slaughtered...etc. Let me tell you something, It just won't work. As I have said over and over again, I am so much in the money I have enough capital strength to ride out the peak and valley. Why don't you guys stop trying to save me from myself. I would really appreciate it.Have a great happy new year! Instead of spending all days and nights bashing TSLA and its shareholders, why don't you spend some quality time with your family, relax, get some exercise, eat well, walk your dog so he/she does not feel neglected, and contribute to our GDP in a positive manner.Last but not least, do not bet against TSLA. As the previous shorting efforts have resulted in record loss which I will not reiterate here."
Still just a slow leak in the bubble. Will it burst?
I have 885 calls for Friday. I don't know if I should just take the little profit there is now in selling it or hope for a burst out of the gate in the morning.

Lol I heard all these bums talking about Tesla going to 600 after their earnings. They all disappeared when it went back to the mid 800s and now they’re back
Shares are hard to borrow now. This could be another epic short squeeze.
NO Worries today! Shorts are out in full force. Long term great stock! Buy and hold! Smart Investor!
"Soon we will be looking at 4th qtr report. Unless there are surprises, TSLA should deliver astounding number of cars and stellar earning report...Wall Street will tells us exactly like it is, just the fact and no #$%$....I personally believe it will ride the wave to all time highs again despite shorties sentiments, and they are just sentiments - the glass half empty sentiments...I know that riding this wave for the last 2.5 years... always the same time... good luck everyone, not just longs... because the shorts will really need it!"

"Director of Body manufacturing at Tesla, Stephan Graminger, lasted only 14 months before leaving in September. Was at Audi for 12 years before that. LinkedIn shows he started new job in January back in Germany. So apparently left Tesla without having another job lined up."

Glad I have readjusted a few times! I am more comfortable paying some of the capital gains for this year. Worried about what Biden might have in store. Just wish I waited longer than.80¢ the last time
"I’m truly amazed the cult doesn’t see through their huckster leader. So many examples of hyperbolic “promises” with intent to deceive investors. Think robo-taxi to be on the road last year. Only a few months ago the con-man claimed all Tesla vehicle owners would see the value of the car increase by a factor of 10, (I.e., their car would be worth 10 times what they paid.). The list goes on and on.China seems to be learning the car is nowhere near as wonderful as claimed by popular press. I find it incedible that the huckster continues to find car buyers. The used car market is repeat with a multitude of used Tesla’s at a fraction of original cost."
"Elon should issue more new shares and get more cash. He will need it. Shareholder dilution? of course not, there are many buyers there thinking to buy the ""dips""."

"The ship is sinking, and sinking fast. Could be $250 by Friday or more if market corrects."
"Tesla to Produce 800 million cars?PE is often used as a realistic barometer of a companies value. With an auto producer that PE could be extended to cars produced. For example, Toyota produced 8.8 million cars last year to achieve earnings. Their PE is 9.21. This indicates that Toyota needs to produce 8.8 million cars times 9.21 years of earnings to meet market cap. This total is 81,480,000 vehicles.Tesla produced 500,000 cars last year. Their PE is 1,628 and this is not a fully diluted PE. Multiply the two and the total is 814 million cars. Fully diluted and this number nears 900 million. There is not enough raw material capacity to achieve this in the next 10 years. World auto production in 2019 was 91,786,861. Tesla, at their present margin ratios which would include the sale of regulatory credits, would need to sell every car in the world for 10 years to have a PE similar to Toyota. The Tesla market cap is absurd at best. Buy it now and you will pay a hefty price in the next few years."

And even then they have 10 months to survive on the recent capital raise, according to musk, they just perpetrated on unsuspecting rubes.Buy on the dippers,... if you thought it was a no brainer in the $240's, you'll love the $180's."

"Elon had a great vision. like Steve Jobs did. I own two Teslas and I love the cars. But I am also a realist when it comes to valuation. if you take away the credits that Tesla sells, and factor in the stock compensation, Tesla is NOT yet profitable from its car business. It is a great company with a great product and a visionary founder/CEO. And its valuation will come back down to something close to how Apple was trading after introducing the iPhone which disrupted the mobile phone business and put Nokia and BlackBerry out of business. Just my 2 cents"

"Fact: Tesla has never made a profit from selling cars. Without government subsidies Tesla would be bankrupt.Fact: The NHTSA has just compelled Tesla to recall over 100,000 vehicles. It’s customary for credible automakers to self-report these issues, not to be forced by the government.Fact: Tesla is a very expensive vehicle with very little time on the market. Its long term reliability has not been tested or proven.Fact: The United States has an unemployment problem yet Tesla fans (they’re not investors-it’s too emotional to be an investment) think $40,000 base model cars built by a start up company are just what the masses want.Fact: Elon Musk made his money from creating PayPal. He’s not a manufacturing guy or an automotive engineer.Fact: $F has an army of highly experienced best in the world engineers developing a new electric F-150. Ford has vast experience in automotive engineering design and manufacturing from over a century of lessons learned - that Tesla still has to learn.Fact: The Ford F-150 is the best selling vehicle in the United States for over 25 years running.Fact: Other Real automakers are developing electric vehicles using their vast experience in vehicle design and manufacturing. With pre-established proven technology and supply chains.Fact: Tesla is currently valued at 1700X’s earnings - earnings which without Government Subsidies would not exist.These are indisputable facts.Tesla is the definition of a bubble. It’s not investable. It’s overvalued and will crash.The best corollary is NetScape versus Internet Explorer in the 1990’s...NetScape launched the first real internet browser - ie. Tesla as the first EV - but then Microsoft used its existing knowledge and infrastructure to crush NetScape.Tesla=NetScapeWhat should you do?Invest in real companies with essential products, growing demand and real assets that are trading below traditional valuations.

"I invested in Ford several years ago. Even with the dividend my account worth less now. Then I purchased Tesla stock, made 51 % in just couple months......thank you Mr. Musk. You are the man"
One tweet from Elon can send this stock up 10%. Do you really want to bet against it?
WEDBUSH )))))))))) LOOK AT THE SALES OF TESLA IN THE WORLD IN 2021 BEFORE TALKING .
"Juicy 20% risk premium on the table, longs. If you believe in Elon, you should be all in."
It always amazes me that Tesla haters and short sellers think posting lies on a message board will somehow validate their ten year wrong predictions. They must have no life whatsoever. Good for a laugh though.
What do we think is going to happen after earnings report? massive dip?
Elon Musk thanks for making me rich!
Lets party like it's $999 today

Just go up to 810. I am out. Loosing my patience with this stock. Should have get the hell out yesterday and buy Pltr. I would have made 3 times the $$ already. 200 shares of this and going no where for a month.
Where can we find how much dividend tesla pays per year?
Nice healthy pullback yesterday watch the money come flooding back in for the rest of the week!
Be back to 800$ end day
how much does tesla do in revenue? asking because i know quite a few companies that do about 10x more that trade for 1/10th the value which if right means one of 2 things this is off by a factor of 100 or there are some awfully cheap autos out there
"695 finel, confirmed."
"It's a blowout even more than I calculated.Blowout quarter, even better than I expected. Tesla 750 soon. Likely 900 by next earnings report, perhaps surpass 1,000 by then.1) Model Y production started Jan.2) Net income 3.686 billion, I had it pegged at 3.45, which is much higher than wall streets estimates.3) Increased model Y All wheel drive mileage EPA Range from 280 miles to 315.4) Solar up over 25% Qtr over Qtr., storage up 11% Qtr over Qtr.5) Due to high demand in China, Shanghai giga factory production to expand even further. Ground breaking for expansion is already underway. Model Y at least equivalent to Model 3, which means 300k in sales minimum in China for 2021."
"You know it’s ripe when you have cheerleaders like downwithdotard pumping. Fractional share at best. Fundamentals kick in, always have, always will. That’s investing, everything else is speculating. Name one reputable economist that says this is not in bubble land."

Wouldn't it be cheap to just slap a quickly-formed body onto a Model S/X skateboard and call it a prototype? Just need to explain the air-suspension. Got it, to lower the tail-gate for loading. Those clueless fans will never notice."
will TSLA hit 650 today?
2020 VW sales of ID3 looking like something is fishy there is extremely high volume of USED ID3’s out on the market just a few months after being sold. Rumor has it that dealerships were forced to buy from VW then sell them cheaper as a used model. Big sales push in Dec to make 2020 carbon quota ? ?? Hmmm that actually makes sense even if it’s dishonest it won’t be the first time VW HAS LIED about something. Diesel gate anyone ?

"It amazes me why Yahoo Finance is so slow to update PE ratio for TSLA. It needs to update earning TTM to $2.23 ($0.80+0.76+0.44+0.23), instead of $0.52. With earning TTM of $2.23, PE (TTM) = 355.84.All other companies, AAPL, AMZN, etc, have been updated their PE (TTM) since their earning last week with their past 4 quarters earning. It is punishing TSLA for no reason! PE(TTM) = 355.84, not 1517.27!"
got to say it... but this stock needs to split after they get done adding in the $5 billion.... would be nice if it split on a 3 or 4 to 1 basis.... then more people will put this into their retirement accounts....

"As per my understanding, Musk and TSLA used the semi-truck and roadster unveiling to attract easy deposit-money from potential customers. Then again, is he and TSLA now not obliged to set up 2 additional productionlines for these two vehicle-types?Where are the money from that going to come from?"
congratulations to the shorts. finally the Tesla peak is 884. investors business daily called the final climax top.

"First time ordering a model 3 performance 2021...switched from the 2018 M3 once my lease was up last month... Not only do I save on gas and inevitable bmw maintenance if I were to continue ICE German cars, but I also pay less per month on the lease and zero on filling up...plus it performs better in terms of speed. I was considering the bmw I4 but the grill is quite out there and in Canada it will likely be north of 100k... Rather invest the 20k difference in more Tesla shares "
My stock broker just called with a $42 price target on Tesla.

"Tesla is over valued by hundreds of billions. The house of cards will fall soon. The company has not made any profit from its business - selling cars. The only profits are from selling tax credits. The real automakers will step up their game soon, stop buying the tax credits and Tesla will have no source of profits.Elon knows this...that’s why he’s used the opportunity to sell a ton of stock at this valuation to keep his company viable.Tesla should be $100 a share. The crash is coming."

Tesla 1500 by Thanksgiving
I e owned some ford stock for many years I have not looked up the history but I think in 10 Years it’s been anywhere from $5.00 to a high of $17 dollars ?? Basically a huge waste of investment money just a total dog. Gym was even worse I’ll stick with my tesla stock first bought at $38 dollars. Yes today I am a tesla millionaire !
"When it crashes I'll sell and buy back at the lower price ,until then I'm riding the wave 50 ft Maui Waui wave!.. lol "
The big sharks are selling their profits. And who will take the hit? Greedy people with money without investment expertise that buying at these levels.. and do not forget the pension funds that dumps money here..
I just looked at GM stock that to has doubled in the last year. Not bad for a company that had to be bailed out by our government. And people cry that Tesla is given money at least Tesla is giving us new and exciting products
The price is going up too fast. Robinhood will soon only allow sell orders 
the low volume indicates that index funds are still not buying
Did Elon just get arrested?
"On March 9, 2020, Elon said that TSLA was high, but that in 5 years it would be worth more than this.At the time, TSLA was trading around $130/share.Why would anyone imagine the stock would be a good buy at $700/share NOW?The only words from Musk on the subject are than it should be worth more than $130 4 years from now (or so). And that's assuming things go well. (Surely, Elon wasn't expecting otherwise)."
"I'm very bullish on Tesla stock, because I know that Bitcoin will go to 250k/coin since Elon Musk is supporting it and it's going mainstream. Apple will be the next major corporation to purchase Bitcoin and this will set a trend. All fortune 500 companies should keep at least 10% of the cash balance in bitcoin. This will protect against inflation. Another reason why this 1.5 Billion investment into bitcoin will bring incredible wealth to Tesla shareholders is because even at current prices, Tesla is up 600 million in profit on bitcoin, so if you use the current 12month trailing P/E ratio of around 300, it would translate into 180 Billion additional market cap! This will materialize next quarter."
"Just remember, the name of the game is ""preservation of capital"". Good luck to you."
Shorts are busy digging into the financials trying to find something—anything—that could hint at the profit not being real... we may not hear from them for a while LOL
So who paid $900 a share here? Tesla is raging buy if it goes to the low 600’s
Telsa will break $700 easily when US or Europe mkt starts
If Elon tweets Tesla $1000 can you imagine the run it would make

"Tesla is a limited upside trade. GM and F are the biggest gainers of 2021-22 when they start mass producing trucks with Rivian. Price and fresh newer looking vehicles, compared to dated old looking model s. New refresh very disappointing. Finally the lithium battery is dead technology and solid state combined with hydrogen and Natural gas generators will lead the way. They should have focused more on truck transit and watercraft tech for boats and yachts as well as invested in better battery technology! Musk was too busy playing in Bitcoin with the snowflakes!"

oops they re scared of earning lolll
Was wondering if I should buy tesla at 590- 600 or wait after Dec 21 for a dip?
Tesla to 900$ by this month end.... Today it may hit 700$ once the market opens.
"One thing the sales rep could not understand.The non refundable deposit on the S or X is $2500 cdn. And $3200 on the Model 3... made no sense to the rep since the S and X are higher priced carsMade perfect sense to me. It is called grabbing as much deposit cash as possible as the Model 3 represent about 8O% of sales I did have one laugh. There are 6 Model 3s in inventory across Toronto, Montreal and Quebec City.. the sales rep asked me if I liked the colours of any. The Montreal car was red and I said it looked nice. He said it would cost me $500 to ship it. I laughed and said I wouldn’t pay an extra $500 to clear up Elon’s priblem.. I’d just order it from the factory lol.. no intention to unless this test drive next week knocks my socks off, and even then, why would I buy a car from a manufacturer that might be BK before the snow melts in Toronto next spring?"
Imagining internal rationalizations of someone betting against TSLA as it increases 10x in twelve months is something truly amusing.
OILPRICE.COM That is where the current news is from. Any surprise!!!!! LOL
"Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne is jumping on the bandwagon by expecting a strong end to the year for Tesla. In a Tuesday note, Osborne raised his price target for Tesla stock (ticker: TSLA) to $380 from $300. He points to positive December delivery trends in the U.S. and Europe, and now forecasts 181,500 fourth-quarter deliveries, up from his prior estimate of 156,500. Analysts polled by FactSet forecast deliveries at 174,000 for the quarter. “Data from countries with real-time registration data in Europe and our own checks domestically suggest that Tesla is having a strong close” to the year, Osborne wrote, “which was enabled by numerous exports from both Fremont and Shanghai to Zeebrugge, Oslo, and Bremen in November.”"
"Someone paid 900 month ago to sell at 620, nice investment lol"
AND FULL SELF DRIVE IS COMING OUT THIS YEAR. AND CYBER TRUCK. AND ELON AND TESLA HAVE OVER 15 billion ON BALANCW SHEET TO EXPAND. THAT MEANS GLOBAL FACTORIES AND BATTERY TECH FACTORIES. FOR TESLA NEW IN HOUSE BATTERY. TESLA IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE EVEN HIGHER STAY LONG BOTS AND GIRLS
"jobless claims just hit the highest again - so will people buy EVs while they are worried about their life savings?the problem with TSLA is that the company is targeting middle class - people who hit the most right now.auto loan defaults are much higher than actual - think why Capital One, AMEX, Citi, JPMorgan Chase all reduced the line of credit for small businesses since August. they are increasing it since ""top management"" sees much higher risk in 2021.occupancy rate on commercial real estates is only 50% range down from 85% - we never had this for last 10 years.the true picture of the economy is not like we saw from the stock market - as I said before, the gov put in $3Tr to pump the market and yet, it is not willing to inject anymore aka the music is about to stop.think what happened during tech bubble - all the tech companies were trading at 1,000x PE like how TSLA is trading now and then, they all lost 90% of the value until PE came down to 10x-30x. In the meantime, all these small investors/traders got wiped out due to the margin calls.only the management survived as they ""repriced"" their stock options.when people think about reality, the bubble pops overnight."
All turned into bears out of a sudden.
"Tesla will halve very very soon. The valuation is MASSIVLY too much. Ridicolous 175-180 TE Cars 4 th quarter, in total maybe 650 TE per year. AND A VALUATION OF 625 MIO EURO?????Volkswagen and Toyota sell 10 Mio, cars per year, profitable and with a lot of models for each segment, Tesla is one car show, but has the valuation of all car companies together?This is not explainable and nothing else but a big fraud. Hence the bubble will burst dramatically.Apple attacks Tesla in its heart, Disruption will Tesla will kill Teslas market value to minimum 50%."
"A German car rental firm; EC rentals just posted this on their webpage. Not only is China company suing TSLA but stories like these will tend to stop people from buying TSLA cars.<<< ....Unfortunately, we had to cease our activities.Due to increasing technical difficulties, and the lack of timely parts supply by Tesla Motors, we could not longer operate half of our Tesla rental fleet since mid-december 2018. Because this situation is no longer maintainable and a solution does not seem to be within reach, we had no other option than to stop all of our rental activities....."
Congrats long! Well deserve! I got in when it was real low. 300 before split. Another stock that I like is nnox. It is Tesla for imaging. Will have at least 8x gain. Put it in your watchlist

Many recalls on their vehicles. Losing loads of cash if it wasn’t for those carbon credit sales. This is the most over valued stock on the market.
"In my opinion: I think Ford, Chrysler, ￼￼GM, had many opportunities three decades ago to really build out the electrical vehicle, but the oil industry kept them from design and production. When Elon opened Tesla he was never beholder to the oil industry. And that is why he is the richest man on the planet."

NOT TO MENTION THE HUGE Q4 BEAT THAT IS COMING ON STRONG MODEL Y AND 3 DEMAND. THAT AS WELL AS STIMULUS INTO THE HANDS OF TESLA INVESTORS WILL BE NEXT CATALYST.
"If you order a Model S or X with a 75 kWh battery, you must wait until February for delivery; 100 kWh cars are available early January. Since Tesla is ""down selling"" the Model 3, which currently is being as only the 75 kWh version, the GiggleFactory is having problems keeping up with production of the 75 kWh battery pack. Either that, or the profit margins are so low on the S and X 75 kWh versions, they are discouraging it's sales. Neither bodes well for 4th quarter ""profits"". No wonder production is being #$%$."
Elon resignation is coming. get out now.

"If Musk is rational, he will release another block of shares prior to S&P inclusion. I mean, why should he let speculators pump and then dump it? How does that benefit him? Some shareholders win, and some lose, but that does not benefit him in any way. It would be much better for the company, if he were the one to dump it, by releasing another $5B or $10B on new shares."

What did Musk invent? The car ? No electric car ? No. What he sold you was? hype or hope but no way this stock is worth $800 billion today or anytime soon or maybe ever

Serious question to $Tsla investors. Is Elon Musks behaviour with (indirectly?) fighting the global Dollar System with cryptos not a potential threat for the (national)security of the United States of america or at least a potential threat to the interests of the US Government?

I’ve heard many times Tesla has a good product so the stock should go up! Please take a microeconomic class people. Having a good product does not guarantee a successful company... Now I know why TSLA longs lose money! They think a good product is everything... Bwahahaha
Why going down??
"They only sold about 10k M3 in April, why do they need the tent anymore?"
"It seems that everyone is interested in the EV industry these days. Apple, Amazon, Google, Baidu, and names I never heard of before. As the attack intensifies, Tesla (the leader in this industry) invests in crypto currency, an area questionable to many investors. In fact my bank does not even allow me to buy crypto. But, the point is that Tesla should use every penny to solidify its leadership in the EV industry. Private investors like myself can make their own decision to invest in crypto or any other stocks.Everyone makes mistakes and I think Tesla just made one with this Bitcoin investment IMHO"

Gold - because of the massive injections of liquidity into markets worldwide without regard for financial consequences.2. Silver - Because of the electronics and solar energy boom which will result in a huge surge in silver for industrial demand (additionally, silver is a precious metal like gold).3.

2020 Review = Tesla cut prices + lost market share + and posted lower earnings in Q4. 2021 preview - VW launches mass production of their hyper-popular ID.3 & ID.4 in China
It doesn’t need bad news. Just good news from competitors.Then one investor will take some profits and it will go like domino. There was correction around 650...I don’t believe that it will go though that low. 720-750.

Every single day $TSLA adds 5% per day at P/E=1520. And it is considered normal.
Tesla cult assembling
China will win. Copy tesla ... And outsell tesla. Just a matter of time.
TSLA has gained 900% this year. It drops $10 and is pumped $50. The US stock market is in a huge bubble. Mostly all stocks are priced 100% or more than their pre pandemic levels. Surely the economy hasn’t grown that exponentially with COVID. The market is overdue for some correction in my opinion.
Ex Scania CEO says $TSLA will go bankrupt due to its low quality toy cars. LOL
$10 Trillion company I believe
This drop was inevitable. the company was way overvalued to begin with. Bullish overall.
Tesla has the best battery technology.
Another green day ahead!
"As EV sales trend results are starting to come out by region/market worldwide, China, Europe, etc. it’s become obvious now with Tesla’s drastic declines, it will only ever be a niche player, much like Audi in the sports/luxury market—i.e., TSLA way overvalued"
this thing has so very far to fall. this is nothing.
I’ll buy some for goofs at 180
Shorting: selling shares so that others get scared and sell their shares and then the shorters profit. It's all psychological.

"regarding the mini sub...true charity is given anonymously to the needy. Elon on the other hand assumes his TSLA SPACE X engineering skills are sufficient and needed and blasts his virtue-charity signaling to the world to keep attention on himself and away from his rapidly increasing Tsla failures. his ideas are neither sufficient nor wanted nor can even be delivered on time...sounds like the m3, a recurring theme w elon...the Thai govt does not want its children to be the latest ""beta test"" for some a rushed to order bad mini sub pool project."

"TSLA made me some really nice money after buying in April 2020, gradually selling at 500 700 and finally out at 850. I give thanks to Tesla, the stock market bull run, and everyone who helped push the TSLA stock price up and up. I wish Elon Musk and each of you great future success. Even though I am now out, I do hope the stock price doubles soon for all of you faithful longs!"

You can get customer service, perform meetings, have social events, and take educational classes and they are signing up Businesses and Universities as customers to their platform as the remote work and remote learning momentum expands rapidly.

"Entire market tanks and shorts still take credit for TSLA riding the same tide down. Shorts should be very careful now. Don't be surprised if they ban shorting for a while. The Trump is more desperate than ever to artificially fix markets...and Powell can't think straight either. This is the bloody streets that many waited for on the sidelines...bloodier than anyone expected. While many sectors have been impacted by the virus slowing down their businesses, consumers are spending less on smaller luxury purchases and just focusing on necessities. One necessity is still an automobile and anyone who was planning to get a new car, is still going to get a Tesla. Consumers that had a Model Y reserved are still going to take delivery on time....they're even going to likely get a better financing rate as well. So while there will a significant reduction in consumer wants-spending at malls, stores, and any other personal items that aren't a true need....I believe Teslas will keep rolling out of showrooms. And if you're one of the people that have a Tesla on order...investing in TSLA now will help pay for your Tesla. The key is to keep your mind focused on the long term rewards with TSLA and other tech stocks that took a hit. This is the biggest investment opportunity for anyone who's been waiting to invest in the stock market. I don't think the knuckleheads in DC can keep trying to control the market and someone may finally tell them to stop trying to help. Today may finally be the bottom. Everyone's at their wit's end. It's time to buy....everything is undervalued now and way oversold. Bull volume is going to come out ahead sooner than the skeptics want you to believe. The country has locked down in the past few days and the virus spread will slow now. If you're skeptical, invest in 10-25% chunks of your and slowly to your portfolio over a few days. Keep in mind...the outlook at $TSLA, $AMD, and many others has not changed at all....they are still focused on long term goals and companies have taken huge steps to keep their employees safe. Their products will continue to sell. Volatility is always temporary. Buy the bottom and keep holding. TSLA is still a $1500+ target for 2020. The short cockroaches that show up on dark days like this are like a broken clock that's right at least once a day. Keep buying and keep holding. Nothing has changed."
"We will get a tiny down move today but it won't be nearly enough. It might move down $10 or $20. This stock would be overpriced at $400. The issue is that there's too much magical thinking right now. There's a lot of competition and the market is treating Tesla as if has none. This magical thinking will eventually ebb away, but it may take quite some time. It could take a year for this thing to correct like it should."

"Everyone needs to understand --- like, really really understand --- that Tesla is most importantly a battery company, AND a robotaxi company, a software company, an energy company, a financial company, an insurance company and... you guessed it... even an automotive company. I didn't have the complete picutre either until pretty recently, but it is unfathomable how many industries it's going to disrupt and revolutionize. I'm holding at least the majority of my shares until 2030."
Up 4.20% ... Nice
There is no limit to madness when going up and going down... It goes extreme in both directions...
"Anyone else think it is weird only up 5% today? I would expect 10% daily, someone must be manipulating."
"Right after it enters S&P 500, it may drop or rise. However, companies which have entered earlier in September, excluding Tesla, have risen at least 20% after the inclusion, despite few pullbacks after they entered. If you believe in the company, you shouldn't worry about it falling and continue to hold as it is."
"$TSLA is up by 2500% in a single year, in Pandemic Year. We need 3 more Pandemic, to PUMP Tesla BUBBLE to $10 Trillion Market Value with $1 Billion Revenue and $2 Billion Corporate Loss."
The current valuation is always the correct valuation.
"Tesla can get into 18 wheel OTR trucks, at least in states that allow tandem trailers.Panasonic has a new 1.5 kwh battery module using 18650 cells. It has a mass of 8 kg and a volume of 7 liters. A 1,500 kwh battery pack would have a mass of 8,000 kg (about 17,600 pounds) and a volume of 7,000 liters (about 247 cubic feet).1,500 kwh translates to about 2,010 horsepower-hours. Odd units, but useful. A 1,000 horsepower electric motor could operate for two hours at full throttle, long enough to get between two Supercharger stations about 100 miles apart.Build a short trailer, maybe 10 feet or less, and fill it with battery packs. Hook it up immediately behind the cab and then hook the tandem trailer, with the payload, behind it. A 20,000 pound trailer would account for about 25% of the maximum allowable loaded weight of the truck.The driver would hop from one Supercharger station to another. At each, the driver would unhook the battery trailer and swap it for a fully charged trailer, leaving the discharged battery trailer to recharge for the next driver to stop.Multiple charging bays and battery trailers would be needed since a 1,500 kwh battery would require at least 12.5 hours to fully recharge at the 120 kw rate of a Supercharger. Figure on having at least one battery trailer at each Supercharger station for each EV truck which stops during the day.OTR trucking companies would love the free fuel. They may not be so keen on losing 25% of the load capacity of the truck by weight or lost time to unhook a battery trailer every two hours and hook another in its place instead of driving 750 miles or more before needing to fill up with 150 gallons of #2 diesel fuel."

"Here's another point for longs to think about: If you're buying Tesla on the hype of its software ecosystem then what about Apple's EV? Even if it comes late it will have access to the whole of Apple's ecosystem. Why would anyone bother with a Tesla then? You can say Apple will be a few years late but note that the EV market is still nascent. 80 million cars are sold a year and Tesla is only selling 500,000 this year at a 50% annual growth. When Apple comes onboard in a few years, Tesla would still be selling only a fraction of all cars sold worldwide."

you could make a good case that tesla is the pinnacle of malinvestment. - investing capital that is not actually going to provide real returns. that is to say you have 10s of billions of dollars invested in a business that does not yield any return on capital. eventually investors wi realize this and then the stock price will follow

"MAJID and $nio, Despite the incredible longevity of the Tesla battery, there are those Tesla owners who still may want their car battery replaced once they begin to see performance decline. While Tesla does not recommend battery replacement, there are a few options regarding battery replacement.The first option is to pay out of pocket for your battery replacement. According to Interesting Engineering, the replacement cost for a Tesla battery is anywhere between $3,000 and $7,000. The price of a battery replacement is mostly dependent on the model and age of the vehicle, but there is good news regarding replacing the batteries in a Tesla.First, the entire battery pack doesn't need to be replaced. Elon Musk designed the Tesla so that should the need ever arise for a battery to be replaced, it wouldn't require any wasted effort or capital. To replace the car battery in a Tesla, only the battery modules need to be replaced and not the entire battery pack, as is the case with most other electric vehicles.The second option for replacing a battery in a Tesla is to have it covered by warranty. You may have heard of Tesla's warranty guarantees ""infinite mile"" coverage, but that is only on the drive unit itself, i.e., the actual body of the car. The infinite mile guarantee is a relatively new Tesla policy that retroactively covers all previously manufactured Teslas as well. This first of its kind warranty was spurred by a chain of events wherein multiple Tesla models were running into problems with longevity regarding substantial parts within the drive unit. But the one part of the car that never faltered was the battery.The Tesla battery is under warranty for eight years, or 50,000 miles, whichever comes first. As you may recall 50,000 miles is typically when Tesla's begin to show the first signs of gradual failure. While some consumers point to the 50,000-mile mark as a point of contention, most Tesla owners never even notice a change in their battery's ability.Overall, the battery capacity of the Tesla is significantly more impressive and more durable than its predecessors and contemporaries. The Tesla battery is a feat of modern engineering that seems to be one of the company's greatest achievements. All indications from Tesla, whether it's a snippet of early press, or the recent ""infinite mile"" claim, point to their battery technology as being far and away superior to other cars."

Old style Cadilac or a Big style Lincoln with suicide doors . The old Italian guys will buy them the second they come out ! Also Elon .... Where's the Tesla Limo's Bro ??"
"When asked whether he would put more money in his own company or buy bitcoin instead, fElon did not hesitate to answer."
TSLA = Solyndra. Please trade accordingly.

If market cap drops below $100BWill Elon need to return cash from performance payout?!!
"In his ""Top 10 Christmas Wish List"" for Apple (AAPL) - Get Report investors heading into 2021, Wedbush's Dan Ives said the tech giant should announce an electric vehicle strategic partnership and suggested Tesla (TSLA) - Get Report would make a good partner."
Just moved all money into treasury bonds like Wall Street sharks - the yields are so attractive right now and it's COMPLETELY RISK-FREE. No need for us big boys to gamble on these speculative stocks which will continue to come crashing down!
Musk's brother dumped $25 million in Tesla stock.
THIS IS ME BUYING CHEAP SHARES ALL DAY
Model Y deliveries in China have officially begun!
$TSLA watch out $NGAC is in town!
Who thinks dilution is good for the stock price?
"In EU (europa) as the biggest market for EV cars then Tesla is not nr 1 company but Hyundai and VW are much bigger and own a much bigger part of the market in EU so what is the reason that Tesla has a 10 to 20 times bigger market value when they are like nothing in the world??? very good question and I think the value of the company is 20 times over valued, but if Tesla in the future are getting a bigger part of the market and can expend the company and get a bigger earnings after tax then maybe they should have a bigger value on the company but I think they have to show that they can do it first like produce 10 mil cars and get very big positive cash flow but thing that is some years before that happen.So a fare value on the share is around 40 to 80 $ as it is today"
I bought tesla at $12 and now 845..thank you Jesus!But I only have 2 shares.......thank you Jesus

Great price to buy. Don't miss the boat
"Goldman Sachs Upgrades $TSLA to Buy, price target to $780 on Improved long term sales outlook and margin expansion."
Elon Musk announces another Stock Split coming in 2021.
"Today, Barron’s analyst gives a price target of $340, yet TSLA skyrockets on an Morgan Stanley analyst giving it a target of $810. This same MS analyst gave a “bear case” for TSLA just last month stating the price was too high. Don’t get it. Pure momentum play at this point."
Sell half your shares to lock in half your gains and buy another winner.Don’t wait until Tesla Stock goes to 200$ where it belongs
This will go over 725 today. WITH 1400 checks coming and FSD COMING IN Q2 you can’t go wrong. Stay long Tesla is expanding rapidly with the 20 bullion sitting on balance sheet oh and cyber truck can’t forget about cyber truck Boys and girls

Tesla's valuation makes sense if you consider the fact that the EVs are installed with money printers that print money for their owners everyday.
Did I hear $TSLA ?
Tesla price target raised to $788 from $516 at JMP.
what happens when the best offer is well below 420
Someone explain why a rational person or entity would invest $60-80 billion dollars to take Tesla private and become Elon Musk's junior partner.
"what big, smart rational institution would add considerable funds to purchase TSLA now? they should have been fully invested for last years run..."
"Can anyone translate this into something more understandable? It looks to me like Tesla cannot show any gains in Bitcoin value but must show losses. Do we now have to calculate Bitcoin's value and add or subtract it from Tesla's asset value? In January 2021, we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity. As part of the policy, we may invest a portion of such cash in certain specified alternative reserve assets. Thereafter, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin under this policy. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt. Digital assets are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules. Accordingly, any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges, whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale. As we currently intend to hold these assets long-term, these charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase."
You think Elon's bro had a tip about the awful ratings and stop orders on the Model Y? he sold at the absolute peak! Keep believing the hype
Tesla is great but it's expensive for most people. You don't see many tesla in Europe and other countries. For this price to be justified you have to see them dominating everywhere.
"ELON MUSK just laughs all the way to the bank. When TSLA will charge extra for some other EV cars that keep using the Super Charger? When TSLA will charge FSD monthly, I think if TSLA just charge $20 a month for using all the app, I believe every body is willing to pay for it."
More Green today. Go Tesla!
I just saw a “plug in commercial” with “Electric cars are here” Volkswagen. Here come the German’s and Japanese as well as GM and more. You know... companies that sell millions of cars and actually make money.
Anyone else holding long positions on margin? I need to figure out that to do!!!

Tesla Motors business plan received a big boost last week when it was announced that the company won a contract to provide Southern California Edison with 80 megawatts of battery storage at one substation at a price of about $100 million. What profit margin does TESLA expect from their battery storage business? Is it a positive number?. This is about $1250/kwh and car batteries are suppose to be in the neighborhood of $200/kwh. What are the other costs TESLA is obligated for more than just the packs in the contract and what percentage of the total cost is just for batteries.
Other auto companies have to give some of their profit to Tesla. Is not that mean Tesla is smart ? Eating other's lunches ?

"Elon is now the richest man in the world. It is because of his loyal believers and shareholders and the trust and belief they have in him. Everyone knows the stock is beyond lofty valuation and they are correct. Elon could change all that by making TSLA a holding stock, like BRK and giving his current believers ownership of his other projects like SpaceX and Starlink etc. Will he? God Bless and stay well."

"I don’t care, I am waiting and watching at least through Monday"
"Tue, February 9, 2021, 5:38 AM""(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. has issued back-to-back mea culpas in a matter of days in China, showing deference to government authorities in stark contrast with Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s years of combativeness in the U.S.Shortly after state media broke the news Monday that five Chinese regulators had summoned Tesla representatives over several quality and safety issues, the company pledged to strictly abide by Chinese laws and regulations and strengthen internal management. Last week, the carmaker said it was sorry that a staff member blamed the national grid for damaging a customer’s electric vehicle."""
I hope one day this stock and the trading gets an investigation.
"Elon musk dual faceHe oppose Shorting stock but he short his own $TSLA Tesla stock by taking loan against that. in 2019 company got closer to bankruptcy but not because he can't sell tesla stock for funding but because of his loan can cause fire sell of Tesla stock and can wipe out $35B of company in minutes then (If he go for funding to save company it would sure caused that)I bet he come bagging those in establishment to save him ( He would not just lose money but gone in jail for $420 tweet as establishment has to show they care). Establishment come up huge plan to make Tesla stock 30 bagger in no time that no one else even think about. I really think he don't care about being richest man because he know it's all due to extreme criminal activity that we will never know about unless their plan end in disaster.His last tweet about $Bitcoin, Why in world person whose mission to save planet from carbon foot print, take all carbon footprint save (I hardly think EV save much if any but that's my personal opinion so not subject to discuss) from 2 decade of tesla operation and wipeout with one tweet.Bitcoin jump 10%+ on tweet, which mean more mining ring will come to life and consume bigger electricity and forced all Electric company to fire their coal plant even at greater speed (Only oil/coal plant, you can control how much electricity generate based on need, Hydro you can but it could cause risk of overflow and side effect of it) So every dollar biThis dual face must exposed. Anyone think Elon Musk Game Stonk tweet is nothing but part of their big criminal plan must work to exposed. I will sure stop if he put atleast $1B of his infinite wealth though worthless $TSLA stock to help bailout all retail investor here and while his Tesla stock is going to drop eventually I will not touch for respect to stand up. Until he take that action either because he is truely supporting retail investor or because he forced to, I will keep tweeting. Later is only likely if people who blindly following also think he should bail out retail investor for level playing field."

Been watching Billions on Amazon Prime. What a great show
"Okay, I know the popular line is oil is dead...but is it really realistic to say a product with 95 million barrels per day in global demand (and quickly rising back to 100 mm BPD) is dead?Secondly, the oil companies have developed a huge business and engineering infrastructure that will help them in the transition to green energy over the couple of decades.The investment thesis is as follows:Intro- Oil production is lower than global demand as evidenced by the lower trend of US & Chinese oil stocks. Going forward oil supply will be constrained by government policies to encourage investment in green energy, however, due to global reliance on fossil fuels, oil demand is not projected to fall until 2055 - it will continue to grow at around 2% per year. Thesis-The combination of decreased production and rising demand create the catalyst for the final long term secular bull market in the oil and gas industry with prices between $100-$150 starting in 2023. Details-Diversify your recent gains into the oil & Nat gas sector while the market is undervalued. The Green energy transition is limiting oil supply through government policy. Demand is rising as Covid cases are dropping and vaccines are rolled out. See the US IEA inventory report and the China inventory report.Secondly refer to the recent Goldman Sachs report about the start of the secular bull market in oil. Expect $100-$150 oil beginning in 2023 through 2040.The cash flow generated by these prices will drive further innovation in green energy from oil companies and further result in the strategic buyout of wind and solar companies by the existing oil industry.An example of this trend is $OXY. They have developed the worlds first carbon neutral crude and the world’s most advanced carbon capture and sequestration technology. Warren Buffett owns OXY preferred. Today you can buy excellent companies or ETFs with high distributors at 1/2 price.$GEL for $6.00; $ET for $6.00; $OXY for $21 or $XLE for $41.Take some profits and invest in oil companies. It’s the only undervalued market sector remaining. The bull oil market is here for the next 12-15 years."
Staff leaving ==== inspires confidence. I am sure the big money is just dying to give Tesla more funds now. Things are going so smoothly that Elon Musk is inspecting cars and the Manufacturing and Production chief are both leaving.
How long before Teslas missing from fully paid buyers start showing up on milk cartons?
"“Tesla has run out of ideas. Puts 1.6 $Billion of investors' cash in bitcoin, instead of ideas for fixing quality problems, improving profits, or new ideas that will help to sell new cars. Tesla is desperate to create a distraction.“"
anytime tesla adds 3% or more remember they're adding more in market cap than they do in sales. also remember this most autos trade at less than 1x sales. so just a little perspective.
Anyone has any idea where Gordon Johnson is? I want to congratulate him for his failures.
"Take an ICE car, throw away the entire engine except the alternator, install alternator onto transmission - you've just created an electric car - figuratively. No mote hydraulic lifters (4-5 parts), no more candhafts (2-8 parts including gears plus attachment hatdware and bearings, belt, idler pulley, tensioner, attachment hardware, belt covers, more attachment hardware), pistons with at least 4 ring parts each on a 4 cylinder car - that's at least 20 parts on a 4 cylinder plus 4 wrist pons plus 8 securing clips, 4 wrist pin bushings, 4 connecting rods, 8 bearings (8 half bearings), crankshaft, at least 5 bearing parts for that, possibly 4 to 8 oil squirters, flywheel or a torque coverter for automatic transmissions (multiple parts to this assembly and a requirement for several quarts of toxic synthetic or real oil, the list of parts in an ICE engine can reach over 1000 finished parts.

"Gap in the $600s need to be filled. If that fails to hold, $400s. Too much EV competition heating up, TSLA went up way too much on hype and S&P 500 inclusion. TSLA only makes a profit from tax credits. WHEN, not IF, other auto makers stop paying TSLA, it's back to no profitability and will be booted off the S&P eventually again. Don't get greedy people. Bulls make money, bears make money, but pigs get slaughtered."

I guess the moral of the story is to buy companies that will run out of money within a year.
Good luck Monday morning after the sell off peace out

What a lovely selling opportunity! No doubt it will open much lower tomorrow...
New to this and first post here everyone thinks of Tesla for their cars but but not for the industry that they will be disrupting that is way bigger then the cars and that is the solar integrated roofing shingles 330m people in the states alone with an average of 20 squares of roofing per home let that revenue sink in for a minute in 5-7 years outlook

SHORTS DON'T REALIZE ...how much they are contributing to this stocks meteoric rise. When I thank them from bottom of my heart. They get mad. I'm in a bind.
Nearly a trillion dollar company. Barely turns a profit. Too funny. Need a reality check here. The market can't keep looking 10 years ahead. A lot can go wrong before than.
"tesla is the best car company ever but the price is not right, $770 get 0.80 earnings per quarter is not a good deal"
"Observations about @elonmusk's $420 LBO announcement:First, the context is odd: Musk promised on the conference call that $TSLA will be forever profitable. So why does he need to go private to ""end negative propaganda from shorts""? And why let them off the hook at $420?Musk suggests there will be no controlling shareholder in the LBO. He also says financing is already arranged. Ergo, he implies a syndicate of lenders has already signed documents for the deal. This is odd for two reasons...First, Musk recently rebuffed an investment offer from Saudi Arabia. If you're passing the hat for the largest LBO syndicate in history, why say no to a big check?Second, a $70B syndicate would involve numerous banks, dozens of lawyers, and multiple boards of directors. It's been [over] 12 hours since the announcement, and none of these parties has confirmed Musk's claims.Which raises a general point: a $70B dollar deal is a Jupiter-sized briar patch of legal and regulatory rules. It's a minutely choreographed thing, with legal risk for any party that says or does the wrong thing at the wrong time. With that in mind:Why did $TSLA not request a trading halt until an hour after Musk's tweet? Why did the company belatedly post an email from Musk, rather than an official statement? Why did Tesla not file an 8-K disclosing details of the purported LBO?Musk says he will not sell in the deal. What about his ~$800M in margin loans? Will lenders accept illiquid collateral? What about change of control provisions on $TSLA's debt? Who will fund the mandatory tender? Why did Musk's initial tweets portray this as a done deal, if his subsequent email revealed it to be merely his intention?Were these plans in the works when Musk publicly predicted a ""short burn of the century"" and a short squeeze larger than Volkswagen? Were they in the works when he aggressively purchased $TSLA shares in the premarket?If this deal is real, it won't be wrapped up for at least 6 months, and probably longer: a) need to assemble an independent board to vote on the deal (a court ruling this year decided that $TSLA's board is not independent of Musk), b) need a proxy statement with extensive risk disclosures (some think this is why $TSLA couldn't take the Saudi PIPE in the first place), c) need a shareholder vote, d) need antitrust review, even if perfunctory.Meanwhile, cash burn continues - in order to avoid default on their ABL, they must have cash/avail on Jan 1, 2019 sufficient to cover both 2019 convert maturities as well as a $400M buffer. That comes to $1.8B. At June they had $2.2B of cash and are burning close to $1B per quarter. Tough math.Musk says shareholders won't be forced to sell. How does that work? A private company with thousands of shareholders is still required to make SEC filings. How will unaccredited investors retain shares?The fact that none of these details was alluded to by Musk is further evidence that Musk has not discussed the deal with lawyers. Which brings us back to the question: how do you line up $70B in financing without involving a legal team?"
Going green?
TSLA is coming back even stronger this time!
Elon said Tesla is not a car company it’s a technology company and more importantly a money maker!
"Look at that cash Tesla has now, $6.2 BILLION."
"Elon Musk said Tesla is about to have the 'most amazing quarter' in its history.Are we going to hear the song ""Amazing Grace""?"
"If AAPL can have a $2T market cap selling a $1000 product, why can’t TSLA have a $100T market cap selling a $50000 product?"
Look like Tesla will rise to $2200/share and will spread again just like last time.
"What is the employee density of a modern automotive assembly plant? When I was a kid (just after high school) I worked in Pontiac, MI, in a GM assembly plant, prior to college. It did not seem that congested even then. The conveyor systems and cars took up most the space. That was in the late 1970's. Today, with more automation, it is probably even less dense. I think the problem could be common areas, such as restrooms, cafeterias,locker rooms, etc. Detroit's automotive production looks like it may start up in two weeks.I can't see Tesla being any further behind."
still going to buy more this coming week of trading ! any thoughts good or bad idea
Elon says sell Tesla stock to rubes and buy Bitcoin Follow the leader he has more information than you do and is smarter

I was realistically thinking up to max of $800 after inclusion but I'm starting think we can pass $1000 before new year!!
Don’t trade the stock daily. That type of stock you you can put in a drawer and sleep. Never listen to any short sellers or haters and never read any negative news. That 2000 plus stock this year and it will have another 5-1 split by then just keep holding and add more
Please any long tell me how this can end well for you?

I'm sure Tesla has dozens of pre-production prototypes, going through it's phases somewhere, since it is scheduled to be launched later this year. Tesla security has obviously been really good at keeping it under wraps, but I'm sure someone has video. I'm not talking about the first show truck, I'm talking about a production intent version. Musk said it would be just a little smaller, but otherwise indistinguishable from the show property. I'm so geeked!"

there is a 2.5% fee just to short Tesla.
"Tesla cheats it’s Investor ....calculating always with percentages....That’s a big fraud, you also have to consider the numbers absolute... And these totals in prices shows the dilemma and what a big fraud the valuation is. Teslas fanboys ignoring this fact.To have 60% growth of one product like models y is not a good message. In totals it is ridicolous and there is also a cannibalism effect with respect to model 3.This shows all press releases ...focus on one good number while there are many bad numbers included , when there is a correct interpretation. The valuation is the biggest bubble ever and will cost many shareholders big losses....-90% is my prediction. Jan 20 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's vehicle registrations in the U.S. state of California jumped nearly 63% during the fourth quarter compared with last year, largely due to the success of the company's Model Y, according to data from Cross-Sell https://info.cross-sell.com/tesla-special-report-0, a research firm that collates title and registration data.The automaker reported better-than-expected 2020 vehicle deliveries earlier this month, driven by a steady rise in electric vehicle adoption, even though it narrowly missed its ambitious full-year goal of half a million deliveries during a punishing year for the global auto industry.The report released on Wednesday showed registrations in California, a bellwether for the electric carmaker and its largest U.S. market, recovered from a third-quarter low of about 16,200 vehicles to around 22,117 vehicles in the three months ended December.At about 11,417, registrations in the state for Tesla's Model Y compact crossover utility vehicle surpassed those for the Model 3. California registrations for Tesla's Model 3 mass-market sedan fell 34% on a yearly basis to 7,044.Total fourth-quarter vehicle registrations in the 23 states, where data was collected, stood at 44,749, with Model Y accounting for nearly half the registrations.Registration figures might not accurately reflect the number of vehicle deliveries during the quarter as registrations in the United States typically take about 30 days from the time of sale.Tesla, whose shares surged over 700% in 2020, is expected to report fourth-quarter results after market close on Jan. 27. (Reporting by Akanksha Rana and Ayanti Bera in Bengaluru and Tina Bellon in New York; Editing by Vinay Dwivedi)"
I won't buy even at $250 ... to be honest.
TOMORROW GOING INTO TESLA>>>>>>>MANY THING RECORD VOLUME DAY FOR TESLA>>>>>WE GOING TO THE MOON TOMORROW BOYS AND GIRLS
Elon Musk creating a far superior EV and status symbol. on the verge of creating the first autonomous car. Competitive advantage in China by owning its own manufacturing plant in China unlike GM that has to use a partner company. will destroy uber and lyft with the first robot taxi service and will have not to pay gig workers. Elon Musk more innovative than Steve Jobs.

Sorry who miss TSLA train
I feel sorry for shorts at this point. It’s not looking good for them.
Yes green close again.
When oil rises more than Tesla you know that this isn't just a car company but a total hype.
"If TSLA is so good, ARK won't keep on selling TSLA in order to only keep 10-12% of its total...I heard Youtubers paid for NIO , but not sure about TSLA ... in 2019 , per share was only $340/5"
"Like I said this morning that TSLA is heading to $700, it has reached $699 today. It has not bottomed yet."
"Back in December, with TSLA trading around it's current range, I thought it was grossly over priced. But overpriced stocks with upward momentum can become even more over priced. And that is what happened.TSLA even touched above $900/share. But no TSLA is a broken momentum stock. It wasn't able to hold above $900 for more than a moment and within a few trading days it broke below $800. The first two weeks of February proved that TSLA could no longer be counted on to close above $800.By the third week of February, TSLA dropped below $700 never closed above $800.The fourth week of February, TSLA has not closed above $700 once.This drop is faster than I had expected in the absence of any actual news. Possibly the stimulus checks will be squandered by recipients in buying more TLSA, which could give the stock something of a boost, but, smart money is clearly heading for the exists.Why would you want to be the last one out?"
Lithium hasn't been produced from clay in commercial quantities before. Mining Analysts say Elon Musk's plan won't succeed. Let's backtrack a few years.

"Bolt is a massive 37k paperweightBut now that the Bolt is here, Wozniak has changed his mind, instead buying an additional Model S. What happened? Woz is concerned about the feasibility of the vehicle on road trips, he said on Facebook this week.While Wozniak's story represents the opinion of only one person, it highlights a major problem with the new Bolt: Its maximum charging rate is too slow.Woz bolts on the Bolt... for now""I'm concerned about how it would work on our favored road trips,"" Wozniak said about the Bolt on Facebook. ""So far, Tesla's the only game in town for that."""
Tesla should have an immediate reverse split and go back down a sustainable PE and EPS.
market correction throughout the board. it's not just one individual stock . they've been takking about a correction for a while now 5 to 10 percent.
Leave Tesla buy nio and thank me later
I wonder in which year Nio will enter India? 2030 ?
lol........the king of ev just took a day of rest yesterday......lmfao
How is Earnings Report looking?
"The price of the stock day to day doesn’t mean anything. There are too many shorts on the stock, so they either panic or are forced to buy in which drives the price higher.But make no mistake, Tesla needs access to capital and very soonSo, does anyone think the debt market is available to them? Rhetorical questionThe only way Tesla gets financing is through equity. He needs the price high to avoid massive dilution.But here is a question. Which Wall Street investment bank is going to underwrite the issue, and who is going to buy the issue? Smart money knows the intrinsic value of Tesla isn’t $325 as it is being run today. The price might show that, but try and underwrite a $2B equity offering ( and it won’t be a bought deal that I assure you!) and you will quickly see where the real share price is.This is a good example of kicking the can down the road a bit longer.. yes, right now there is some short covering and price is jumping due to it. But once dust settles, give it a month or two and let’s see where things sit.For it is undeniable that Tesla will tap the equity market fairly soon. Only question is, which big boys will buy? No disrespect to anyone on this thread, but we are minnows in an ocean of financial sharks and whales! Gary"
We sit on a massive bull flag. If it goes according to plan that's 1100+ print. Impossible? Not with this equity.
Cars? Who cares. We want Mars.
"Forever TSLA shareholders, thumbs up."
"Given that stock analysts just randomly raise the price target even though Tesla did not do anything special from the previous price target, why not just raise the price target to infinity. Just get it done with. Really what is the difference between a price target for Tesla at $1000 or $50,000, or $100,000. All of it is based on the same logic."
"Tesla got loads of cash, but not enough to pay their staff during this shutdown. They have been asked to take holiday. Just what you need a holiday in a shut down state in February in a Pandemic."
$1.35 million in market cap for each vehicle delivered!!
"ARK investments Cathie Woods just scooped up 178,798 units of $TSLA shares today. That is approximately $130M worth. She has not been wrong so far."
Tesla will be very lucky if it's in the Top-10 of global BEV producers within two years.
"Just bought TSLA today, I can see that it’s going down and a bunch of ppl are commenting that it’s doomed. I’m curious for those who have been here long, do these same people always jump into the convo and cry whenever it starts to go down a bit? LOL"
I am moving to $gm and $tsla American!But I have NIO and BABA.... will $baba have a blow out ER????
"Price will stay under $900 tomorrow if there are no more new buyers...very close to $900Earnings call at 6:00 by 6:30 pm you will know where the market is heading..I personally think we will see 18-25% pop on positive guidance (you do the math)Thursday May great day for Tesla If not than it may pull back 10-12% and back above $900 in a month.Good luck to all who’s holding for short term and for long term like me, I will hold the stocks for long term as the future outlook and growth in the company is great..Auto global market sector is worth $330 billion Global energy market is worth close to $11.8 trillion You do the math if Tesla is industry leader in energy and auto27-30% market share to be considered leaderJust my opinion"
US currency and US Federal Reserve is a big Ponzi scheme.
"Here's how TSLA gets to a market cap of $15 Trillion by 2050One billion Tesla's on the road, each paying a $100/month service/software update fee to TESLA. Total revenues $1.2 trillion per year. So, isn't it just so obvious that TSLA is worth at least $1500/share now?Come on Bulls, bid up the price. The higher the price, the more eventual profit for us Bears."
Now that the krazyness is gone. Stocks fly back up over recent drops.
People with real investment acumen realize this is on sale. Just bought more. 
Solid day for TESLA :)
Fox business is just now is now acknowledging Tesla is a casino stock.
"Buy buy buy! Will be $2,000 by the time Tesla joining S&P 500. Cheers to all Tesla investors!!!"
"Model 3 got range increase to 353 miles without price increase! I am kind of jealous because I paid 55K for my 2018 model 3, which is more expensive, slower with shorter range. But then I saw 1430 shares of $TSLA @ $220 cost parking in my investment account. I told myself: God is faire. :)"
I believe this morning's drop shook off a lot of weak hands. Especially hands of people who probably bought @ 745-845. They were trying to save their small profit or avoid margin calls.
Bubble popping?
Cramer loves this stock! Stay Strong! Bad market day today!
"I checked, ARKK alone had added 200k shares of Tesla, that's $156M in 1 day"
Elon with his big mouth talking down bitcoin after investing 1.5b should be investigated by tesla share holders.
Waiting for the action to happen like
"It should gap down tomorrow opening around 790. The support of 825 is broken and the next one is at 740-750. I don't expect that to be broken before earnings. However, earnings this time might give a little positive surprise due to record deliveries. Depending on earnings, this could be below 700 or above 900 in first week of Feb."
"Tesla's greatest asset isn't the gigafactory, but its bitcoin holdings."

"Tesla is a fantastic business that is worth $800 billion, aiming to disrupt and dominate the global energy industry in the long game. The electric cars are just the warm-up act for a much larger endgame. For more hot stocks like (TSLA) just go to (http://trade-view.com)."
"Bring it ON, ""Tesla-killer"" guzzler competitors but But where are guzzlerEVwannabeemaker's 0 to 60 mph in 1.9 secs EVs thus Straight to the Stars for Tesla, all the way UP to $2000/sh and the Beyond after the Splits!!!"

"Its not about Apple, existing EV players in Europe and China are already getting the better of Tesla. Someone needs to explain me how a company which could not deliver 500K cars has a market cap of $700 billion.Tesla’s share of the critical European battery-electric-vehicle market crumbled in the first month of 2021, and China has taken the top spot from Europe in the EV race, according to new research."
So the run up on Monday has evaporated the last 4 days?Imagine that....
already made 8k buying call options at 695. lol thanks for ur money shorties.
Bitcoin hits $50K. 20% profit from 1.5 billion purchase within a few dayzzz??? and growing? Not too shabby...
"Short sighted. Tesla will likely double their earning on average every quarter for the next 5-10 years, quicker in the early quarters. In 5 years they will be producing 3-5 million cars at record margins. Add FSD revenues to that and the earnings start to go ballistic. About this time Tesla will be dominating and disrupting the energy industry with clean renewable energy and smart grid technology to meet the ever increasing electrical load. The energy business is huge and will double Tesla’s earnings again and again for the next ten years. Buy and hold, is all you have to do! In these times there is no better place for your money."
Tesla is sell i guess
"Alright you Tesla shorters. How much money did you lose this week? Comon, tell the truth!"
It’s my birthday today and I’m buying more shares DCA baby let’s go 
Is Tesla going to split again?
Are we simply seeing a small price correction after hitting new highs last week?
EVs are much easier to make than what people have thought. A poor low tech country like Vietnam is going to sell EVs this summer in Vietnam and US markets. Tesla will not be a lonely player in the EV field.
Did you see where Apple car will partner with Hyundai . Intense competition building. Like I said in three yrs TESLA s PS is $50. Just like any other car manufacturer. Every car maker will have a line of EVs.
Any chance for some continuation downside tomorrow? Bears gota eat too.
52 week low coming soon

The can use any financial instrument to get better pricing but buy they must on inclusion day. TRACKING ERROR IS THEIR MAIN FOCUS....What you do on Dec 22 is up to you!!"
Tesla longs here should realize that $GM has gained by 20% since a month ago while $TSLA has remained flat. This despite the surging market. What does that tell you about where the money is flowing? Look out below Tesla bulls. Absurd valuations do not last long.
"Even with price target 800$, not much upside from here. A lot of down side risk though."
Green after hours! Big boys are getting in today.
"Perhaps musk needs to spend more time managing construction and less wasting shareholder equity on ponzi scheme crypto currencies.I mean tesla is supposed to be a car maker, not a casino, right?""Tesla's German factory faces ""massive delay""Tesla has said that it expects to begin production at its new factory in Germany this summer, but there are growing signs that the construction project is behind schedule.German auto-industry trade publication Automobilwoche reported that critical buildings on the site haven't yet been constructed, and that Tesla has yet to submit a building application for its on-site battery plant to the local government in Gruenheide, near Berlin.Tesla said last month that construction of the ""Berlin Giga"" factory was on schedule, and that it planned to begin production of the Model Y crossover SUV in July."""

Bull case for Tesla. Berlin factory to straight up destroy BMW in Europe NEW Mega casting for front and rear of Model Y & 3 eliminating 60% of the build line Berlin Margins will break 30% OR Elon lowers his pricing again thus crushing its competition simply put he will be making better cars at half the price and selling them LOCALLY NO IMPORT DUTUES no SHIPPING half way around the world I can go on about FSD or that Tesla insurance is about to double by expanding into Texas. I can go on about a lot of other side stories Making a Bull case for Tesla is quite easy.
No market manipulation can change the facts that leading car manufacturers will be in the BEV space and finally make the market very competitive for Tesla
Something i learned hard past 1.5 year. NEVER short TESLA
Loaded up today. Feeling great! It’s like Christmas all over again!
Rebounding today?
"Options expire tomorrow. 300 puts will expire ""in the money""Good luck!!"

"They should keep dragging out a stimulus deal because the market keeps going up on optimism that a deal will get done, ha"
Buffet is buying Tesla quietly! He will report after April.
"WoW, Just WOW. This is causing shorts like me massive pain in the stomach, but i will not cover.If It does not go back to reasonable valuation within next 6 months, then I deserve to loose money.This rise everyday is absolutely crazy"
"This stock will end green today. Mark, My, Words"
Compare AAPL's super high PE to TSLA it would make TSLA valued at $21.25 (over 40 times the speculative value compared to APPL). TSLA is a great company but way overpriced at $880. Protect your gains and capital. For the first time I just shorted TSLA. At minimum 600s is on the near horizon.
sold at $310...crazy profits from $354 to $310 on 1200 shares. Love TSLA
"Many try to diminish the importance of Norway's sales data, but I think that is a mistake. Here are some data and insights.Norway has about 5.3MM people in totalThey have about 2.8MM passenger cars registered.To date Norwegians have purchased about 372,041 EVs (about 13%)This makes Norway, the biggest adopter of EVs in the world. There is a strong argument to be made that this little country is a useful model for what might happen in other countries as EVs are adopted competition increases.To date, Tesla has sold 58,915 of all EVs sold including:111 Roadsters13,829 Model X21,120 Model S23,855 Model 3Its worth noting that the bulk of sales happened before there was any significant competition. If you take out the Model S/X sales, Tesla's sales are mediocre at best, and in the last two years, they sold less than 2,000 model S in Norway and 3,000 Model X. Put another way, now that there is choice, those vehicles don't make the grade for the vast majority of buyers. (As an aside Porsche sold 1,200 Taycan's just last year at almost double the price!)Tesla has 15.8% of the EVs sold in the country over that three year period.Now you can massage the numbers anyway you want, but here are some conclusions from my analysis you can look at EU-EVs to see some nice graphs:1. The number of competitors has jump significantly. In 2018, six auto groups represented over 95% of sales. In Q4 2020, those same six groups represented just 80%. Renault was the largest in Q1 2018 at 40%, now it is VW by a large margin at 29.2%, Tesla maxed out at 29% in Q1 2019, they are currently (Q4 2020) at 16.3%2. Nissan and Tesla were both beneficiaries of early adoption. Now the field is spread very widely in a 'normal' market where there is competition and Tesla has moved to third place in marketshare in Norway in 2020 behind VW, Hyundai and Renault/Nissan. VW is the only company to show dominance.3. The idea of domination is probably passed. Tesla can claim such a thing in the USA, VW can in Europe but other than that, there is broad adoption or such small numbers as to be a misnomer. In Norway, VW brands clearly dominate having gone from 16%, 25% and now 30% marketshare over the past three years. Tesla went from 18% to 30% to 11%. 4. Finally there are a lot of arguments about capacity and those have yet to be borne out for any manufacturer in any meaningful way. Competition is ramping up everywhere, and all suppliers appear to be constrained by supply. That data will become clearer this year and next when substantially more production comes online.Overall though the reason that Norway is important is because it is a small window into the future of EV sales and competitive markets.You can ignore it. You can misrepresent it, you can acknowledge it, but it is still happening and it isn't favorable for Tesla.Guru."
Good to see the TSLA stock turn around and have a nice uptrend move up. Avoid the noise. The price will increase.
755-775 CLOSING TOMORROW... SLOWLY STEADILY GOING UP !!! WILL SURPASS ALL TIME HIGH WITHIN MARCH WHEN MUSK ANNOUNCES TSLA WILL HIT THE PRODUCTIONS TARGET !!!!!!!!!
"Well if those wallstreetbets, reddit guys would push this to 3000. Ill be a millionaire. I am long. 250 shares. Have at it boys please."
GOING STRAIGHT BACK TO 800 CATHIE WOOD PUT THE BOTTOM IN AND TRAPPED THE SMELLY SHORTIES. SMART PPL BUY TESLA!!!!! TESLA IS FUTURE OF AUTOMOBILE.
Was that the bottom for today??
Jim Cramer loves Tesla! I'm all in!
Going up! Laughing all the way to the Bank! Can't wait for tomorrow!
the jd power ranking is probably some money making scheme......cant trust anyone these days.....every tesla owner i talk too has had no concerns whatsoever.......i am not the least bit worried about my investment as i see more and more teslas on the road by the day
Serious question! Looks like Apple will be in the car business. Wouldn't it make the most sense (for AAPL the share holders and the partner company) to pair with the biggest name in the business. APPLE + TESLA. A grand slam win for everyone. Why wouldn't this happen?????
I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO ELON MUSK AND THE TESLA STOCK OF AMERICA
It will be a close below 550$ today.
Europe spending billions on battery development. Tesla will benefit as they build world's largest battery factory in Germany.
"There's never been a shortage in the peanut gallery. Yet, it's where all the shorty's live. To wonder why TSLA is on a meteoric trajectory is proof you haven't been paying attention. If I'm not mistaken I witnessed the writing on the wall and predicted TSLA would go to one thousand by April 2020 and be where GM was in the 1950's and allow me to say no one gave me a thumbs up. Yet it did just that and go on to split multiples where anyone could own the most valuable automaker on the planet while simultaneously set the bar to rule the world if it reached $1000. Behold we are on the threshold. Still the nay-sayers, the unfaithful and the short ships come out of the woodwork in droves as if they're trying to convince themselves. Remember this had you been paying attention and bought at the inflection I indicated you would be a millionaire instead of mortgaging your grandmother's house to short your future."
The problem with these Wall Street analysts is that they were slow understand Tesla and are now envious of those that understood the technology of Tesla. Now they’re mad that they missed the boat on this company as we longs will all be millionaires in 5 years and they will still be workin for da man!!!
"We can call Tsla as technology company. In the last 5 qtrs it made money in selling cars. Not shipping/downloading or implementing technology, Let call spade as a spade. it is a car company. He gives free charging for a year to sell cars. He is forcing forced timeoff to cut productions. These are typical car companies do."
"A gradual decline, over weeks and months, is better for the pros. That way, there is plenty of time for amateurs to buy the dips."
"In Germany ....here news about the overvaluation of Tesla.Wer rechnen kann, der kommt bei solchen Wachstumsraten schnell zu dem Schluss, dass ein klassischer Autobauer wie BMW Tesla in absehbarer Zeit eben doch einholen könnte in Sachen E-Autoabsatz. Ausgemacht ist das nicht, aber es gibt keinen Grund, warum der Dax-Konzern abzüglich seines Nettocashbestandes im Industriegeschäft von zuletzt 13,5 Milliarden Euro nicht einmal vier Prozent von dem kostet, was Tesla wert sein soll. Sicher, die Altlasten aus dem Verbrenner, die sich in abschreibungsgefährdetem Vermögen niederschlagen, sind nicht ohne. Aber auch Tesla muss investieren. Dass der E-Auto-Pionier das 27-Fache von BMW kostet, beweist vor allem eines: An den Märkten haben sich Blasen gebildet (siehe Editorial Seite 1). Ziemlich sicher ruhiger schlafen können Investorinnen und Investoren mit einem Engagement bei BMW. Sollten die Märkte abstürzen, gibt es zwar auch da kein wirkliches Entrinnen. Mangels Fallhöhe würde ein Crash aber bei weitem nicht zu so hohen Abschlägen führen wie bei Tesla."
Keep in mind the people making the predictions of where this stock will go are all invested in it financially.
"NIO already recieved a $10 billion YUAN: $1.5 BIllion USD, NIO went up 8% that day.Same banks lent the money to $XPEV and $TSLA.These credit lines that NIO and XPENG both recieved from the same banks have low interest rates.But for some odd reason bears want to paint the image that a $1.3 Billion USD convertible notes is bad? This is dumb.I believe XPENG went up because it was a beaten down stock that was just waiting for a reason for an overdue turn.Why do people even argue that with Xpeng vs NIO?It's NIO vs Tesla. Never gonna be Xpeng vs NIO. Xpeng should be worried about Teslas cheap cars.Xpeng should be worried about NIO once they start mass production of cheaper vehicles under a different marque.Xpeng should be more concerned with Teslas lower end vehicles and BYDD"
U ask yourself why Bitcoins is rising up like the eastern sun? TSLA is the same. Just keep on going because people are keep on buying.
Wished i had crystal ball & looking at Jim chanos & Gordon Johnson reaction to this.

"I hope Starship SN9 launches today and makes a successful landing. If that happens, $TSLA will go through the roof tomorrow."
"I had 43 shares of Tesla at one point and sold at $643. Hoping for a dip that would allow me to buy 44 shares... But it took off. That is a sad feeling. Fortunately I invested in one of the Chinese EV brands. Now I am the proud owner of 47 shares.This stock has its bad days, but when it takes off... You only see its tail lights getting smaller and smaller. And you are left eating the dust. Not a good idea to bet against Tesla."
Shorts are going to HAVE to pay Elon $420/share!
Dearly beloved. We are gathered here to remembered all the poor Tesla shorters who gave up their lives & money so that we Tesla longs can become millionaires. Thank you shorters!
Oh man Tsla going to hit $500 per share!! Should I buy now or wait until it hit $100 per share ... or even better deal when they go bankwrupt...
Tesla now worth more than all the car companies on the planet combined.
"Tesla is now dead, to many other EVs catching up quick. Shorting the heck out of this"
It appears that all the fund transfers were done on friday before close. That said i expect pullback and consolidation in the coming days. Around 550-600 maybe?
"Too high a valuation for such a niche EV player. The educated EV consumers of Norway are perfect evidence, where Tesla places a dismal 7th, with only 2,081 sales. Top of the list was the Audi e-tron, with over 7,000 - which bodes well for its parent Volkswagen. Mercedes-Benz’s EQC and even the Nissan Leaf outsold it. While the OFV’s statistics don’t break out electric from conventional sales for the VW Golf and Hyundai Kona, it would appear highly likely that their electric versions also easily outsold anything put on the market by Tesla."
Look what happened to GME. This is the same thing over a longer period. But the fall will be swift.
Ain’t selling a single share ... Tesla mode on
in a week TESLA cab move up $200 easy ... elon is a wealth building machine!
"TSLA is a great company with a visionary leader. I have no doubt it will be a $400 stock by year's end. However, in the immediate short term, it ran too hard and will correct down to about $330 in the next few days."

"I invested in Tesla almost 10 years ago at around $20 (after accounting for the 5x split). To be honest, I did not like Tesla's investment in Bitcoin. It is a small percentage to Tesla's cash on hand, but I was never confortable with Bitcoin. I could've bought Bitcoin at around $2000, but I could not convince myself that this was a good investment. So, today's Tesla investment forced me to trim some of my investment in Tesla and move it to Nio until I get more information on Bitcoin. Do your DD. I personally like to feel little more confortable where my money goes. Good luck with your investments."
Lol who’s buying this
Any predictions for tomorrow ? I read Pipe Sandler said 1200 stocl price overweight but for when? I dont know
"Markets closing at 1pm tomorrow and then won't reopen until Monday. Happy holidays, all!"
Insiders sold shares. Sec files out in public today.
Remember TSLA day? The stock went up so much in anticipation of TSLA day. Then it pops and the stock went down in the short run. Same thing might happen to TSLA in the short run. If you are a long term holder then don't worry about it. Otherwise protect some of your profit from a dip.

"Elon Musk made his company on high hopes, his company has always been funded by Shareholders. Elon used his Company future based on projected forecast, yet his Company is not even profitable. I once thought highly about Elon Musk, today I see fraud and false foreward claims about his EV'S. He has been cashing in billions recently because he knows when truth hits the fan that his company will go down. TSLA is overpriced and will face many EV makers in the coming 18 months. This would cause TSLA to collapse. This company was funded by shareholders and public offerings over and over without being profitable. You should know what is coming. His investment in Bitcoins will further flatten his character all because Bitcoin is a fraud currency. Watch as Bitcoin implodes."
"The most amazing thing to me is that there are buyers at all. Must be quick trades, in and out."
"If Tesla trades at 20 USD it has a similar PE ratio as Alibaba. Earnings don't mean anything for a stock price, I know."
Lol! In 2018 Cathie Woods said Tesla would be worth 4k a share within 5 years. Pre split of course.For all those that bought in heavy 2 years ago may I buy you a drink?
this will double come february.....some nice runs after the doubling mark as well......split time in the works.....accumulate shares now
Why does Barron’s. CNBC et al give Gordon Johnson publicity at all? Destroying their own credibility
"Tesla is the leader in battery technology. Battery costs coming down, longer range, $25,000 car all means more revenue, dominating the market means more profit."

Everyone is in awe of the Tesla rocket...I'm just doubtful having seen market bubbles before
Talk about missed a opportunity. Now why couldn't Elon get Colin Kaepernick to drive a Tesla?
Thumbs up if you bought the dip!
when will be get Q4 sales #?
"Apple products are massively overpriced, yet plenty of people pay a premium. What's the secret? Ecosystem. A series of products that complement each other. Once you're in the ecosystem, it's hard to get out. The final objective is for people to buy Tesla cars, lease them out via Robotaxi, and cover liabilities via Tesla insurance.

The only parts of the car not designed by Tesla will be some chips and the entertainment system."

Bought 400 shares at 869.
if you have any stock in the S&P 500 then you might want to sell those shares as Tesla is going to displace those companies a bit in the next few days... like Apple... move out now and wait till it all settles then reposition when the dust settles a bit.... could be a good time for a buy in...
"In response to a large number of requests for my take of the monday eve ""ELON TWEET""------ I offer the following:.First a disclosure, though a longtime holder of TSLA , , and one who has grown to acknowledge the genius ability of Elon Musk, I don't worship him. He is brilliant, talented, CUNNING, cruel, and not a very nice person, certainly not a sterling example of transparent honesty. He has had to wage war with ""the shorts "" and industry enemies who sought to destroy TSLA and for many years had the upper hand, but in the last year he has turned that around in a big way. So while I don't worship him as many do, I certainly have a deep respect for his warrior ability. I see his tweet as just the latest chapter in the story of the ""war"". He certainly does not intend to sink the stock, but rather to walk the fine line he perceives in the best interest of the company that is his baby and his source for riches.. A number of things come to mind, we know that many people around the world want to buy a TSLA, many would wait if a new technology was imminent . He cannot have that, he wants and needs current sales to be robust. On the other hand, he also needs to keep good news flowing to support the lofty shareprice. I am convinced he has that news, we will learn some of it today, there will be more in the future, he will walk the fine line as he sees fit. Those who short TSLA , especially on weakness , should bear in mind and take very seriously his formidable warrior abilities. I, for one , I am not dismayed about the tweet, it is classic, typical Elon. There is more reasons I can think of for the tweet, but for now the above will suffice.The above being said, those of you who have followed my posts, know that I anticipate much more reasonable share price action than the extremists on the board. The extreme pumpers who spoke of $600 and more this week NEVER were going to be right. Those who think the stock will be at $1000 by year end are also wrong. I also believe the extremist bashers will continue to be wrong It is going to be interesting , that is always true for TSLA .................Less"

"The fact that stock has moved up so much today after all the rally in the past 1 month, the earnings results will be blockbuster. Tesla will not only hit all the numbers, but will raise unit, revenue and EPS numbers significantly for this year. This is also reflective of new Factories coming online which will drive volume. The stock should be around $700 in after hours."

"Tesla is a better investment than Amazon. Amazon trades at a lofty premium due to high recurring revenue and low margins from software, namely, Cloud. Before Cloud, Amazon was losing money on a purely retail level. Even with ""Prime"", Amazon still lags Walmart. The issue with software is that it can usually be replicated rather easily. Microsoft, Google, IBM, etc. all have Cloud, so Amazon's growth potential there is saturated. What you can't replicate so easily are (1) the Chinese market, and (2) quality. Amazon fails on both of these counts. So Tesla is much closer to Apple in this regard."

Twitter- musk - model y production to start next week.
I would be ashamed if I sold a share. But I didn’t so I guess I’m good.
"When the bubble pumps more and more, stranger explainations appear. When it passed all other car companies in the world, with a fraction of the world production you said IT IS NOT A CAR COMPANY! Now you say the Tesla share is not a share, its an asset against printing dollar or inflarion. I think now even the hardest bulls have run out of arguments to protect this ponzi scheme. Prepare for a bubble burst not seen before in history since tulip mania."
"The $TSLA Model Y is here, earlier than expected, less costly than expected, miraculously with a full FIT credit, nicely appointed with excellent range, loved by the car reviewers, and best of all, far more reliable than the Model 3.Hyundai Kona, Edmunds 2019 Best EV"
1T market cap this year. 
THINKING OF SELLING? THEN YOU SHOULD SELL IN THE STRENGTH @OPEN. MARKET IS IN A DOWNTREND. IT'LL CLOSE IN THE RED TODAY AND WILL CONTINUE INTO THE NEXT WEEK. THIS DOWNTREND HAS JUST STARTED AND IS MUCH BIGGER THAN WHAT IT APPEARS TO BE. GOOD LUCK TRADING.
I posted a while ago that i wouldn’t be able to fully utilize a million mile battery in my Tesla. It is now apparent that Robo-taxis was just one possible use for a million mile battery. Now we are learning about Tesla cars being battery storage for the grid. TSLA to $3000.

"The reservations number has been used so much to prop this company up with zero known validation. For two years now. And it's unverifiable. And the only time there was an update, they put out the wrong number which they later corrected. But then they said ""we've been getting 1.5k reservations per day [for 3 days]"" which produced misleading headlines.When you give a CEO of a failing company as much leniency as has happened in his guru like elevated status... THEY WILL EXPLOIT IT. THEY WILL COMMIT FRAUD."
Always goes down before a new high
No Way Tesla's Stock can go up with a car market offering a variety of 59 different EV models
"Only 70 days ago Tesla was trading at half of this price. In these market conditions when stocks have increased so fast, normally you see a painful downward trend where still many believers will keep buying. When external factors will trigger a market correction is when Tesla will be shaken badly and landing brutally to 50-60/share."

Good night all... the earnings certainly surprised me (and I was thinking +50 to 200 million.) I think Tesla may have crossed the hump...

"Elon mentioned delayed Semi due to battery supply. HLYN nearby in Austin, TX just announced new battery tech. Specifically a truck battery that charges in 8 minutes!"
Germany cuts incentives === EV sales drop 55% in January I know that you guys are in complete denial but this is human nature. People knew the incentives were going to expire and they bought EVs last year. PS: There are probably multiple reasons for the decline.
"Don't fall into the trap of comparing PE ratios of a high growth disrupting company with other ""old"" auto makers. So little need to change to improve those numbers dramatically, once Tesla does not have to invest so heavily in new factories etc. Also, there is tremendous possible upsides to the Solar, Battery storage, software business. Finally, Tesla is situated to capture more of the value chain with high vertical integration. I went into TESLA 1.5 year ago reading that everyone thought that the price is too high,, but after gaining 13X in value - I do not try to be smarter than the marked. I just hold on and enjoy the ride. Also, just remember, that just in case you are right, and we will have a correction in the price. There is no way of predicting when it will happen. You will most likely run out of funds before it happens (if it ever happens)"
I'm curious why no one seems to care about insider selling in big numbers

I agree with Jason...it makes no sense at all to cut price if they have long reservation lists and heavy demand...something is up...I have a feeling it is Musk trying to continue the growth path and the only way is to continue to incentive and cut price...not a great long term plan...watch this fizzle early in 2021....

Let’s play catch the falling knife?
"Disaster in Europe and Germany market.....Tesla ended 2020 with 96,000 units sold in Europe, among which are all three vehicles it sells there: Model S, Model X, and Model 3. Supposing the Model Y could sell as well as all those three vehicles combined, that would give Giga Berlin a volume of 100,000 units in the best-case scenario.More Articles About Tesla In Europe:was tesla disrupted traditional carmakers europe Was Tesla Disrupted By Traditional Carmakers Selling EVs In Europe?⠀tesla voltage capping panasonic battery packs Tesla Is Voltage Capping Panasonic Battery Packs To Match LG'sFor a factory that plans to produce 500,000 units a year, the Model Y may not be the adequate choice to get started. It could also make the Model 3 there to have a larger local production, but only the original car Tesla promised for the European market may make Giga Berlin reach the production volumes it aims to have. These Are The Signs That Show Why Giga Berlin Should Be WorriedElon Musk already said that Tesla probably needs a hatchback or a smaller SUV than the Model Y for the European market. With the performance numbers it presented there in 2020 – despite all the subsidies and in a much larger market than the US for electric cars – it will probably need it from the very beginning."

TSLA is 8% away from the MS 810 price target better upgrade again and raise!!

"Tesla is diving , Tesla has a huge debt !"
Chinese EV bubble stocks up slightly past two days but TSLA down. EV bubble still not popping but the movement is very likely due to the veneer of TSLA being tarnished from that Chinese reprimand on quality. And China is the most important market for TSLA ATM.

"Tesla is surely heading higher here as $1,000 is a nice round number."
"Ummm, do you guys realize that electric cars are not going to solve climate crisis? At this moment electric cars are making it worse. Do you realize that if somebody comes up with an alternative propulsion system to gasoline, which is is in the makings all the time, electric cars become useless overnight? Have you factored that in to the stock price of tesla? I mean, is that hard to get?"
The biggest problem Shorts have with Tesla is that there are really not enough shares to short. I feel they have baked in $600 a share. Currently Tesla is in a cash crunch and whether they pull through or not waits to be seen. I felt 7000 cars a week was golden for Tesla on the M3 production. Quite interesting is that if it was easy the rest of the industry would be building EVs at a profit. Instead their low level commitment is expensive at this point. I looked that the M3 drive train videos and what a mess it is today with cooling/heating lines. With time technology will reduce this.
Why are there so much hate in this group lol at the end of the day bullish people will always hold the throne for Tesla cause even if it drops it’s always a temporary drop Tesla will always go up how can you bearish people not understand that with everything Tesla is doing lol
Why the $10 recovery?

"Biden’s CO2 emissions quandary . . . and ZEV credits quandaryI wonder how long it’ll take Biden to figure out how CO2-emissions-intensive the Lithium and copper mines are . . . and then to connect the dots with the so-called “zero emission” battery electric vehicles. He’s really kind of putting himself in a bind if you think about it. If he’s against CO2 emissions, surely he’ll question the value of the mining, and therefore the value of EVs as well . . . but then if he’s for so called “zero emission” cars he has to ignore the fact that they completely rely on high CO2 emissions mining.Moreover, will Biden then take steps to correct the poorly structured ZEV credits program, which also completely ignores the high CO2 emissions mining required to build the BEV batteries . . . and yet rewards those “after the mining” . . . such as Tesla, who still wouldn’t be profitable at all if not for those unearned credits that they profit off of."

"A lot of jealous losers and paid bashers...... Tesla will have the highest market cap of any company by 2025. More car manufacturers will be doing EV. Tesla will be supplying power to homes, businesses, and vehicles! Tesla actually owns their own FSD software. You think longs are worried about other companies making Evs? That puts a smile on my face because that gives Tesla more control. We will see Tesla pieces and software on other vehicles because they are one of the best manufacturers in the world! We will see Tesla trucks everywhere, most semis will be a Tesla. A lot car manufacturers will no longer exist. Only some main guys getting into EVs now will survive. Tesla also doesn't have a traditional dealership network that makes more profit then the actual manufacturers....Tesla eliminated dealerships! Less then 10 years from now we will also see dividends. Hold long!"

"I purchased more shares today a few times on the way down this dip. $NIO & $TSLA are the future, so try to acknowledge these are on sale today. When you look back in a couple years, you’ll be thankful for these dips. I’ve been in early and made a life changing amount of money with NIO. I don’t enjoy the dips in the moment, but holding this investment since just after IPO through 25 will permanently change our family tree. To the young bucks trying to make $5 on a quick trade, consider buying and holding. While you made pennies flipping shares, many of us are up 1,000%. I agree there is nothing wrong with short term gains. I have been tempted to sell often, but I am so thankful for holding and accumulating a stronger position over time."
"""Analyst"" upgrade! I've upgraded TSLA to $10,000 by year end."
"For starters, we can’t deny that TSLA is a huge name in both the automotive market and the stock market. Tesla is a prime candidate to benefit from growing government spending on green initiatives.

Ford's stock price has trended downward since 2014, from a high of $17.4 in August 2014 to a low of $7.4 in December 2018.So which company is a better buy Ford or Tesla ??

"I don't really see why all the alarm. on 40 billion earnings Mkt Cap is less than 19x forward earnings. Full value is discussed at being around 22x and bulls are saying that might not be where stocks takes a breather. With 50% sales growth forecast and china and germany soon to come on line. Then why the doom and gloom? Musk has at least 18 months with no credible competition. If there was a time to sell it's then. Personally i'm not so sure all electric is the future, or if in fact it is a bridge to hydrogen becoming the viable fuel of the future. I question our collective ability to electrify all travel without using fossil fuels to generate the additional power demands on the grid. Which directly undoes all the environmental benefits to electrification. Hydrogen by product is water. Slam dunk. I'm holding for 12-18 months and then looking to move on. This will be having another run up. 60 billion earnings next year at a x19 multiple still implies upward growth and room to run. I'm not bullish or bearish with Tesla. Just going by what's public knowledge. Does Tesla hold when there's competition? Also can another company get a hold on the market that Tesla has cornered?"

VW plans on releasing over 70 models of EVs by 2028. Meanwhile Tesla is trying to improve a few models to be the best they can. Even if you deny the logic there it still shuts down the idea EVs aren't the future.

Biggest unanswered question is will the SEC hold the board liable for approving a policy to let Elon determine what is material or not before deciding of review of his tweets were necessary or not. Especially given Eon’s statements that he “absolutely does not respect the SEC”. At some point the SEC has to hold the board accountable.

it traded in line with other autos but lets say give them a 2x multiple because they are supposedly growing that'd put them at about 2.5x annual sales which would be maybe 75 bil market cap which is ummm alot lower than here

"The presentation of the CEO and CFO had another VERY Interesting pointS (and I mean with big S)1. The CEO states that currently there is a barrier of entry in building new cap seize ships, because in a few years the propulsion of these vessels will change (probably hydrogen -- my take). Which is very good for ship currently, less short term competition2. The company that installed the scrubber technology will get paid per agreement on the fuel savings that the vessels make. (put another way, no fuel savings = no payment) and the scrubbers will be owned by ship in a few years. So as an investor the capital of the company $ship has been increased.As such I am expecting 3x on $ship near term. $ship is no $TSLA, $FCEL, $PLUG, but short term it most likely will outperform these stocks. Do the research yourself.Obviously a dividend is on the radar as also discussed in that presentation. Here is the link again to the full presentation.Question: which company installed the scrubbers?? That company would have a significant interest in ship doing well, just to get paid, and they are probably also purchasing these cheap shares on a grand scalehttps://noble.mediasite.com/Mediasite/Play/3ce0bdc360c04c5d81ef1e222443c9c21d"

"Aug 10QAccordingly, we expect to achieve a rate of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of 2017. We expect to further ramp to a rate of 10,000 Model 3 vehicles per week, and an annual Tesla vehicle production rate in excess of 500,000, at some point in 2018.Nov 2017 10Q Based on our current progress, we expect to achieve a production rate of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the first quarter of 2018, although the precise progress of the ramp is difficult to predict given that our production growth rate is similar to a stepped exponential, so there may be significant rate increases from one week to the next. In order to optimize the incremental improvement of our automation processes and the efficiency of our capital expenditures, we will implement the capacity to further ramp production to 10,000 units per week only after we have achieved a 5,000 units per week run rateFeb 2018 10kBased on our current progress, we are targeting a production rate of 2,500 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the first quarter of 2018 and 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter. It is important to note that while these are the levels we are focused on hitting and we have plans in place to achieve them, our prior experience on the Model 3 ramp has demonstrated the difficulty of accurately forecasting specific production rates at specific points in time. We are systematically addressing bottlenecks and adding capacity and resources in places like the battery module line where we have experienced constraints, and these actions should result in our Model 3 production rate significantly increasing during the first half of 2018. In some cases, we may not achieve the manufacturing labor efficiencies until we ramp up to fully automated manufacturing lines, which may take us longer than anticipated. In order to optimize the incremental improvement of our automation processes and the efficiency of our capital expenditures, we will implement the capacity to further ramp production to 10,000 units per week only after we have achieved a 5,000 units per week run rate."

Right now the hedgeies are keeping it propped up while they reduce their positions. Won't last forever."
"1) Elon said at end of Q1, Tesla had significant delivery issues and used that as an excuse for the lowly 63K salesBut then, why has he not delivered more than 10K globally so far in April?2) Elon kept guidance intact, saying 90K+ deliveries in Q2But how can he do that when he hasn't sold 10K by April 24? Is he going to deliver 40K in May and 40K in June?3) Elon warned that Q1 would be a loss. And today he said Q2 will also be a loss. But, he said 3Q and 4Q will be strong in the profit.But how can that be with less subsidies, no new models, and an already satisfied population of M3 buyers?Don't be a gullible lemming!"
"Okay longs, let's think about this... With Model 3 getting closer, how does Tesla mitigate the Osborne Effect? (where the announcement of a newer, cheaper better version cannibalizes sales of the existing product) It's a serious concern. It's named after the demise of Osborne Computers.A few mitigating factors:1: The large number of reservations ensure that even if you order an M3 the day they start shipping, you won't get the car for 1-2 years. Meanwhile MS and MX are available today.2: MS and MX will be more established & reliable designs that appeal to risk averse customers. As early adopters pivot to the M3, mainstream customers will move from BMW, Mercedes and Lexus to MS and MX.3: Lack of a hatchback and flat loading platform. The M3 prototypes have a traditional deep trunk and the rear window is fixed. This is actually a huge negative for utility. (The auto industry goes to great lengths to avoid the 'station wagon' label. But if we are honest, that's what most 5 door cross-overs and Prius-like cars are) The Bolt is a station wagon. Even the MS has that utility if you fold the seats down. Yet the M3, conspicuously, does not. I think people who want that utility will continue to be drawn to MS and MX.Shameless Prediction: Once M3 ramps production and works the kinks out of the new platform and batteries, Tesla will announce the Model Y. It will be a Model 3 with crossover/station wagon functionality restored. At the same time, they'll announce MS and MX with 2nd generation batteries, based on 2170 cells, in the 150 to 200 kwh range. Look for this toward the end of 2018."
New strategy for Tesla.Buy $ millions of a particular cheap stock.Have Elon tweet it the next day. Sell for 100% profits.Rinse wash repeatThis should help increase their margins

"The fact that this is still above 300 shows you people believe in magic. Musk wants to take the company private to reduce the scrutiny on the books. His vision for taking the company private includes keeping 2/3 of the current investor pool, he just won’t need to publish earnings with the same scrutiny"

"It's a (cool) car company with some side gigs (which account for less than 7% of turnover) and its production capacity is increasing rapidly. But it's not about how many cars you can make but how many you can sell and at what profit margin. Elon is a pioneer allright and the cars are nice, but they aren't Ford Model T and this isn't the 1920s, market entry barriers are much lower this time and in 3 years all other car makers will have competing EVs. We're not out of the woods with the recession. Robotaxis will also mean people buy fewer cars overall. And whatever Elon does with SpaceX and other stuff has no bearing on TSLA profits. It's had an unexpectedly good ride (in a stimulus-junkie market) but ultimately everything that goes up in defiance of all common sense and fundamentals, inevitably comes back down. Clearly some are brandstruck and can't see through the panache, for the grown-ups it's probably time to take profits..."
Today is the last day to buy TSLA shares cheap!! On Monday the fund managers will be buying billions and billions of shares. The price will go up at leat 50x to 100x. No one is selling at these cheap prices. The fund managers can't find shares to buy!!!
"Down big on very low volume! This is not a sell off, there is just no one buying this anymore! When the sells really start to hit, the bottom will fall out without any buy support! Easily in the mid 500's by mid Feb"

Just wait until another stock split is announced and all of you bashers and shorts will be buying in the stock just like last time to help drive the price higher... Once the stock split happens yes it will drop even further which is good because now a larger pool of investors can afford the stock to help propelling it up... This is a win-win for Tesla...
I was wondering why Bitcoin moved so quickly from $20 to $40K. I suspect TSLA dropping $1.5B had a lot to do with it.Not_A_Short
So can $TSLA bounce off the bottom yesterday and slingshot to the moon over the next few months? Asking for someone deep in the hole on long calls...
Can’t beat it at all. It’s coming back again. The shortie are trying hard. But they are all getting burned.

What will be the expected after hour price?
"One of the potential contributing reasons the SP rose so dramatically in the last couple of weeks was due to call buying and market makers needing to cover their positions by buying the stock. If there is a sell-off and the call options begin to get sold (and closed) will this have the contra effect of market makers then selling the stock because they no longer need to cover the call contract? If this is the case, then we could see a cascading selling effect due to closing down open call positions. Anyone have any insight to this possibility?"
Anyone buying at these prices has some big balls but hopefully things work out in the long term. Every time someone says the value is too high the stock keeps climbing so you never know what could happen next. GLTA
"Production shut down for a week. CAO leaves. 7 ""highly sought after"" Model 3's already for sale on eBay without any bids above $50K. But, hey Elon talked about Mars, AI, and showed the 2 electric trucks again. Stock will go up? I am completely on the sidelines right now, but my gut tells me this is due for a precipitous fall; I am amazed by the loyalists and longs as the negative story here is so obvious to me that it is like watching a train crash in slow motion. What am I not seeing that the longs do?"
ok guys I will confess. I decided to buy double my position on the dip at 752 and sell the rally. but I fked up.
My XOM holdings are doing quite well. Maybe try investing in a company that actually makes money?
"Dear Bears, there is currently a Tesla orbiting the Earth. I don’t think you understand. Maybe it’s expensive, but this isn’t Ford..."
Next thing you’ll see from Elon is him scrambling to buy everything and anything while the stock price is still outrageously inflated. Let’s see if I know how his mind works
Prices will definitely go up in the next few days to $ 900 buy now

"This thing is on a death spiral while they can make a profit if they ship 50-55K Model 3s in Q3 at 20%GP, this run rate is not sustainable.

In order to maintain profitability they would need 50-55K new orders each quarter ( i.e. NOT the existing reservation holders.)"

"Tesla growth is dependent on demand which is very limited. Model S and X sale have been flat for nearly two years and may be in decline since the model 3 has been launched. Q2 was very weak but most of weakness appears to have come from gaming the deliveries into Q3 in order to show a profit. The model 3 demand has evaporated and 70.000 USA sales per year looks like the number with international sales call it 100k per year, or double the X and S. watch as these numbers play out in the next few quarters. Poor service and cold weather problems are really hurting the brand"
This will be a 400$ stock mid January

"Robert Friedland CEO of Ivanhoe mines who is developing projects in the Democratic Republic of Congo, current supply source of 65% of the World’s supply of cobalt:""Elon came to me because we have a nickel sulphate and cobalt sulphate operation in Australia, not the Congo,” he said. “And Elon said ‘I’ve got the world’s biggest battery factory, so I want to buy your nickel and your cobalt at the current metal price for 10 years, because I’m the biggest buyer.’ “So we told Elon Musk, you know, Elon, that’s interesting. We’ll think about it. And then two months later we went back to him and said “Elon, you’re totally screwed. The Germans are building a gigafactory twice as big as yours, the Chinese are building four of them bigger than yours, the Japanese are building two and the Koreans are building one. So unless you’re willing to pay to buy our cobalt and our nickel at whatever the price may be in the future, you’re not going to be able to build any batteries in your own gigafactory and your whole company is going out of business, and we’re going to make money shorting your stock.”Increasingly, media and investor speculation on the potential for supply chain constraints to materially restrict Tesla and other EV manufacturer’s ambitions is rising in terms of frequency.Remember, Elon Musk’s vision and promotional language states unequivocally that the affordability of Tesla automobiles hinges on the ability of the company to lower the cost of lithium ioin batteries. With new battery manufacturing capacity coming onstream faster than new supplies of lithium cobalt, that future might be more distant than either Tesla or any other lithium-ion battery consumer can credibly predict."
"I don't make predictions, I make plans. I plan to buy puts and increase my short call positions if TSLA climbs above $900. If TSLA falls below $800, I plan to buy back some short calls.

"talk about insane management...Musk even writes their departure statements: After almost 3.5 years, yesterday I have decided to leave Tesla. I had an incredible time with a team that is by far the most talented that I ever worked with. Tesla’s products are hands down the most efficient and exciting eVs in the world. And I’ve enjoyed working at a company with such a great passion, with such incredible customers and with a mission that is so “electrifying.” All the best, Tesla! Now for me it is time to try something new. I did not decide yet what’s next but I am eager to explore and find out."""

Get Mr. Musk out now with some excuse that this was all beyond his control and thank him for his efforts. Let him continue playing with spaceships.Restructure what is left of TSLA and get any usable pieces over to GM and Ford. Get the manufacturing and design into Michigan and Ohio and let them do what they know very well how to do - make and sell cars globally.The squid can make that happen and the current administration would be wise to encourage it.
Quick. Raise another $2.7 billion!
"What your saying doesn't matter. TSLA goes up every day!! Buy all you can, on margin when the market opens Monday morning. Buy as a market order or you won't get filled.

See? Buy on the dips. Tesla isn’t just about the cars. It’s a company that is changing transportation as we know it. They are currently the gold standard for EV’s. Be in Tesla for the long haul. I think we will be rewarded as time goes by.
"Per Consigliori on Stocktwits - $TSLA - I'm sure most TSLA bagholders know that Cathie Wood of ARK Investment renown is exiting her position with TSLA of late. She dumped another 65,000 shares plus on Thursday combined from the portfolios of ARKK and ARKW. It wasn't the first day this past week that she was dumping shares either. Clearly she knows where this over priced puppy is headed. It's always smart to be the first one headed out before there is a stampede out of the shares. Unfortunately now for you bagholders, you've committed to holding over the long weekend, and many people in your situation will now be contemplating why you are holding an investment with a PE of 1417 when other solid investment like expensive MSFT have a PE of 35 and pay a dividend of 1%. Think how much has to go right to justify the PE that TSLA has. It's priced to perfection, but a lot of competition is headed their way. Ponzi scheme now, and Cathie Woods knows it. Enjoy a nervous weekend longs."

I finally get it. Ignore fundamentals and ride the wave. Nobody ever sells their shares so this stock will continue to rise. It will only pullback when TSLA issues new shares. Then it will continue to rise again. Long and strong seems to work with this and buy every time they issue new stock. Why did I not jump on this rocket ship sooner!!!!
"Next support is 627, if breaks then hope for the best in Jan 2021."

"TESLA CARS ARE ""Déja VU"". Other Car makers like Mercedes are making more Attractive EV cars."
"Look, I'm (negligibly) long in TESLA just because I believe in Elon. But here are the facts. $TSLA beat earnings. Elon musk evaded questions. The conclusions you draw are going to be biased towards your belief in the company. Shorts have the right to he suspicious of his behaviours. Longs have the right to be frustrated at a drop after an earnings report that exceeded expectations."
All tech stocks are down. Buy the dip and wait for recovery
"Watch for 600, and then right to 381-389. I see it coming. All EV complex will crash. TSLA will sink S&P with it."
Gap up after hrs +$15 says my CAT!

Why selling cars ? They should issue shares only
Who would have thong S&P futures turn negative after stimulus deal? This is how over bought this market is. Last time TSLA traveled from 500 to 325 in 5 trading days. Guess how many days this time. I say 3 days.

"Guys, Cathy W is not buying shares for herself. If you buy and ETF from ARK , in order to cover that they buy tesla. Thats true, but the same is true the other way around. If their investors are selling their ETFs, ARK gets out from the underlying positions (and sell tesla). They are not really running any risk. So she wont help Tesla stock price - a couple of days ago it did when they increased tesla exposure, but thats over.I'm not bearish or bullish, just saying."
Plan for a ride during extended session ! Nothing can stop . Guidance will be stronger for coming quarters because of expansion and climate change movement.!!
Anyone else predicting 7HUNDRO by the end of the day!!
"TSLA only closed the Model X & S production lines for the holidays. Those models only account for 11% of deliveries. They are focusing on mass producing and delivering as many Model 3's & Model Y's as they can for the last two weeks since those two models are in heavy demand. Notice how they encourage the workers to help with deliveries or work on other production shifts. If you go to the Tesla website, it takes 2 - 12 weeks to get delivery on Model 3 & Model Y. It takes 8 - 12 weeks to get delivery on the Model S & Model X because they know they will stall production on those two models. They have some inventory for Model 3 & Model X, but no inventory for Model Y. They will encourage reservation holders to take delivery on the Model 3's already in inventory to speed up the delivery process and get those cars out of inventory. One incentive is the 1,000 miles of free supercharging. Avoid the noise. The price will increase."
Should be enough of a beat to trigger more analyst price boost. Plus stimulus money rolling in. Married couple could purchase 2 shares after digging thru the piggy bank for the xtra 2 hundred. 3rd catalyst possible Georgia dem sweep which looks more than 50% likely now. That would bring in more of the alternative energy crowd. Possibly then exuberance exceeds logic and common sense finally kicks in.
Probably one of the most overvalued stock in the market

"Cathy Woods: ""He (Elon) is a provocative soul and he is brilliant! He's our renaissance man and what we should have done is keep our eye on the prize. We believe that Tesla will be in a poll position to dominate because of its advantages in artificial intelligence and the amount of data it has collected and the A.I. expertise that it has."" According to her, Tesla's battery technology was already three to four years 'ahead' of the competition. Tesla has 15 billion miles of real world driving data collected and the next closest is Google with 25 million."
I wonder if the zombies will wake from their comas if the SEC removes fElon from the role of CEO.How much does $TSLA sink if the SEC removes fElon? $20? $80? Maybe even a 50% haircut to $130???

Things get interesting if and when Tesla earns its first profit. Let's assume all the stars align and 2019 they have earnings of $.75. That would give the company a p/e of 469. Let's say things get really crazy and they earn 2 bucks. That's still a p/e of 175 which still seems a little high for car slash battery storage company.

No one where this stock is going...up or down. Those long are certainly enjoying the ride. Those wishing for a decline are either short sellers or simply here to complain about others making money and they aren’t.
It will easily break thru 320 a share when they start selling the all Model S

smart money getting out
I am a Tesla worker at the Fremont factory. About three weeks ago I lost a limb in an accident when a rogue robot tried to weld my arm to a Model 3. Unable to have use of my arm I engaged the auto-pilot in my newly acquired Model 3 on the way to the emergency room. After about 30 seconds the car veered off into a barrier and I lost my right leg on impact. I was unable to get out of the car since the touch display came off the dash and I could not unlock the doors. The car was soon engulfed in flames and while shrieking and writhing in agony I began to wonder if saving the planet by driving an EV was really worth it.

"Tesla takes delivery of a big order of robots at Gigafactory TexasGood luck and GOD bless,"
"Bears don't get it. Tesla has become a top brand not just a ""product"". The main reason why $TSLA keeps going up is because people have assigned a status symbol and high value to the company and its products. I don't think that's gonna change any time soon. In the near future, Tesla, SpaceX, Boring Company, Teslaquilla will fall under one company. I can easily see the share price reaching $7000 within 5 years."
Once the bids stop coming in all your money made (unrealized) will be gone. Cash some out now.

"How much profit is Tesla suppose to make ? I don't recall Elon giving any clarity on how much under which accounting standards, he really left it open to his interpretation of ""profit"". Pretty convenient no ?"
The TSLA long speculation and valuation are flawed. EV consumers worldwide want personalized design from a variety of automakers. This isn’t like the smartphone business. Otherwise everyone would have rushed to buy a Toyota Prius when they debuted 20yrs ago. That didn’t happen
What about TSLA energy that'd about to take off? They just don't make cars only

"I will reiterate this, 720 by EOD and below 700 tomorrow, maybe even 680. This is the technical analysis saying. There is even more pressure now because of overvaluation and the tax-related holding is not there anymore to support the price. This can go down to below 600 by Jan 15th."

TSLA is a $50 stock in 5 years when people realize they can’t charge monthly for FSD and an FSD taxi service isn’t going to break the bank it will likely be a money losing business. Even worse by the time that regulation happens other automakers like Hyundai will be in the game. Having said that short term I’m bullish.
"There’s some pretty odd comments on here...The serious investor will understand that as we come out of covid, we will see value stocks outperforming growth stocks.Until all gets ironed out, expect the hills and remember we’re climbing Everest"

I just drove a Dodge Hellcat. What a great car. There is one point I like better about the Hellcat and that is what they call gasoline. When you run out you simply go to the nearest replenishment facility and within minutes you are ripping up the asphalt again. It seems my Tesla does the same thing except there are not many replenishment facilities and if/when I do find one it takes at least 45 minutes until the car can rip up the asphalt again.. Anyway I give the Hellcat a recommended buy for anyone that isn't doing any across the country driving. (long distance)Go ICE's!

"The drop is unjustified and an opportunity to buy on the dip. GM is based on fundamentals and 100 years of stability. It will prevail and ultimately win. $TSLA makes 2% of the cars in the world and irrational investors are treating it like it's going to take over the auto industry. Wake up, this will never ever happen. They don't have the scale, the experience, the army. $GM, $F, and $STLA can get to the numbers and masses much faster. Invest in these stocks and your investment will be safe and grow. Stay in Tesla and you're going to lose everything."

"Intermittent Full Self Driving, which is what Tesla's FSD actually is, takes away the most valuable metric a safe driver possesses: Situational Awareness. When FSD informs a non-engaged driver to immediately take control, he/she needs to instantaneously ascertain the risk, develop a plan of action, act upon that action, and have the car response to their inputs. You just traveled 100 meters at 70 mph. Ever notice yourself unconsciously slowing down (or covering the brake) in congested areas, when black ice is suspected, or kids/pets playing nearby? FSD does none of this, but drives like a kocky (sic) teenager, and then hands the wheel to you, with no advanced warning, when it has no solution."

If this was a swimming pool and you said it was filled 3.5% with water, I would tell you it is empty. Believing this should trade at Toyota's valuation is crazy. More likely, this should trade like Hyundai (assuming FSD works). However, this thing trades more than all car companies combined. The longs that say ""Tesla isn't just a car company"" better be right because it is not even a good car company at the moment."

"@Hello""You are all hindsighters who think you are wizards and predict teslas direction.""I don't think of myself as a ""wizard,"" nor a predictor of any future direction. However, I am fortunate to understand an opportunity when presented and realize common sense that is clearly visible. Hence, the now obviously good idea to stop day-trading $TSLA (from 2010 - 2011) and buy a decent number of shares in 2012 (which I continue to hold, and added/traded additional shares from time-to-time).I think there are many other investors who have bought $TSLA early and continue to hold. When the EV movement has resulted in today's action, with many new players entering the space and being traded higher at a rapid pace, selling makes zero sense."

Density and not Price that matter when come to Battery.4.> China demand wasn't enough forcing company to export from china (Which Elon said not planning at all before) Also forced to lower Model 3 Price by large % then only able to move volume.5.>Worthless EV credit sale is only reason it has positive net margin and double digit margin.6.> Elon asking employee to turn profit.

Great until you get caught and Tesla isn't small company that chance of getting caught is small.7.> Model S and X they can't sell 100k globally that they forced to shut plant.8.> Elon on battery day we have master manufacturing and we will even mine Lithium to lower cost.

Tesla stock price struggling today
ARK sold approximately half their holding in TSLA over Q4 2020
TSLA stock will go up every year for at least the next 20 years. GUARANTEED! No matter when you buy you will make money.
From another’s Post:Cramer said that Tesla stock is biding its time and that a lot of investors got involved in the stock market because of Tesla. He added that he likes Tesla and thinks it’s a great company and that it should keep going higher.
"I’ve seen this play out time & time again on the news. TSLA down trends, Shorts think they will win & then TSLA takes off like a rocket ship and the stocks overall performance is stronger. Step up to the plate if you think you can short this company OVER THE LONG TERM!"

"Strategy for today?short - term. ... sell if it starts down post 3:50pm. which may indicate overbought and a reversal startingLong - term. ... don't sell it because even if it goes down its always coming back up, Tesla has a 5 plus year advantage on the competition.BUT Tesla might crash the whole market after it's inclusion because of the re-balancing, profit taking etc... The Options contacts flat out say that after today the interest is much lower ... and price usually follows. I make money."

"Excerpted from Stanphyl Capital’s October 2020 letter to investors, discussing that there is no China growth story for Tesla.We remain short the biggest bubble in modern stock market history, Tesla Inc. (TSLA), which currently has a fully diluted market cap of approximately $429 billion, which is nearly 90% of those of Toyota, VW, GM, Daimler, BMW and Ford combined despite unprofitably selling fewer than 500,000 cars a year to their nearly 40 million. The core points of our Tesla short thesis are:• Tesla has no “moat” of any kind; i.e., nothing meaningfully proprietary in terms of electric car technology, while existing automakers—unlike Tesla—have a decades-long “experience moat” of knowing how to mass-produce, distribute and service high-quality cars consistently and profitably, as well as the ability to subsidize losses on electric cars with profits from their conventional cars.• Excluding sunsetting emission credit sales, in 2020 Tesla will again lose money, as it has every year in its 17-year existence.• Unit demand for Tesla’s cars is only maintained via continual price cutting."
"Currently $634+ after hours. Only $20 from all-time high. Thank you shorts, you lose every time!!"
All the bears. Now what. We are turning green will go to 1000 soon.

"This is still $1T market cap stock. Way overvalued that next 100 year it can't justify with current business including Battery business even if it turnout big winner.Given all other advance battery from $QS, toyota, Samsung, (Likely Apple working as well), LG Chem (Which currently have most advanced cell with highest density). Chance that Tesla technology winner is 5%."
Trump tweeted (after Elon's tweet) his remark about China tariff was misinterpreted by market & he's in fact expressing optimism about the outcome of his upcoming meet with Xi. After that Shanghai & most other Asian markets turned green & US market future turned greener. Shorts' wish for another market sell-off to cover cheap is denied by Trump & Elon

"$TSLA insurance. At least 1M cars on the road. Increasing by 400K every year! Prices are competitive or better than other insurance. SO chances of all TSLA owners switching to TSLA insurance is very high. Insurance is $100 per month at a minimum. 500K x 100 = 50M reve per month = 600M per year. Not bad at all and the thing is its going to keep increasing. I know all the smart ones will point out revenues does not = profits. But the insurance is more like 150/month. and because the repairs are mostly done by TSLA shops, there will be a much better margins and efficiency. I was paying 290/month for model 3 with AAA, and it is $156/month. I asked the AAA guy why so expensive, the answer was teslas are expensive to repair and take longer time. Clearly an opportunity for TSLA to cash in. Its almost like punishing the owners of TSLA for most likely other peoples fault. They should be increasing premiums for non-TSLA owners. Barbecue TSLA has data on every driver's driving habits, they can adjust the premium a lot more precisely unlike the other insurance companies who actually dot do the repairs."
"My question is how do the index managers buy TSLA, as it is expected to enter the index at the closing price on Friday, December 18? The securities markets, including NASDAQ have market-on-close order protocols, so brokers on behalf of their buyers (and sellers) can submit market-on-close orders to be executed at the close. The question is whether there will be sufficient sellers to fill the buyers' demand. I would be interested in anyone's take on further details on how the transactions will transpire."
"This is a steal at $790......hahahahaha. Even if TSLA sells 10 million cars, this price would be hard to justify."
The whole market is red dont sell hold
"the little volume aftermarket selling makes it look like a bad day, but the bounce today showed the resiliency of Tesla stock. I will shocked if this stock doesn't hit $830 tomorrow. Ark needs to keep buying and make the shorts feel the squeeze."
"I TSLA will never see $600 again, in a same way TLRY will never see $300 again. Next year TSLA will merge with GM at $250 or so, in order to save face."

From $371 to $290 in 6 weeks... The cult is all excited about a $8 short profit taking bounce.. Elon can show whatever numbers he wants... And the shares will do whatever they do...Without a fix of that little problem of going broke at breakneck speed.... Another day at the ballpark.

"Tesla & Panasonic update:“Both Tesla and Panasonic continue to invest substantial funds into Gigafactory. That said, we believe there is far more output to be gained from improving existing production equipment than was previously estimated. We are seeing significant gains from upgrading existing lines to increase output, which allows Tesla and Panasonic to achieve the same output with less spent on new equipment purchases. However, we will, of course, continue to make new investments in Gigafactory 1, as needed. Most importantly, contrary to what is implied in this report, our demand for cells continues to outpace supply. It remains the fundamental constraint on Tesla vehicle and Powerwall/Powerpack production,” Tesla said."

The U.S and the rest of the world should be thankful to China for allowing many of their big corporations to freely operate or export their cars and products there to reap jn big profits from the local mass population.

"Healthy correction? On August 31 Tesla hit a high of 500,14. In after hours on September 8th, it retraced a natural Fibonacci correction of 38 % to 310. The 310 was after hours. I was watching it very carefully. If this is only a mild correction again, look for 548.If it is more sever 50 % look for 442,21.Most sever would be 62%, or 336.10.Below that, Bear Market.The worst scenario of 336,10 is 50 % more than Toyota's market cap. The best Auto maker in the World."
"I am a buyer at $70, TSLA needs to retest it’s lows before it can move higher, this is a healthy correction but not a buying opportunity, TSLA will not return to this level for another 10-15 years"
"The Bloomberg tracking is showing 6k/week now. (difference between today's number and the 10/22 number)107,276 to 113,328 = 5,962 this last week."

"It's time Cathie Wood gets a reality check. She is reckless. Her thesis to buy at valuation levels not seen for decades is problematic. Wall street knows it as well. She bought heavily yesterday and than tried to get another boost by announcing it, to protect her position . She can't bully a stock higher in this manner. You can only do that for so long. Valuation matters in tech with the 10 year rising dramatically."
"I'm new here, but have a sincere question....Will the cost of borrowing $100,000 to buy a Tesla car increase if interest rates rise? I really like the blue one."

"Elon Musk amd Tesla have failed to deliver on almost all guidance, yet people still flock to him with religious fervor. Tesla has become a cult, plain and simple. Why else would a Tesla share cost more than almost every automobile manufacturer combined?"

Y’all are sheep lol. Look at $TSLA and the general market. It’s been red. Relax
"Do not be confused by the Shorts misinformation campaign. The Model 3 will be profitable day 1 and increase margins as mfrg goes thru it's cycles. The v3 of the Supercharger will put Tesla in a very unique position. A huge amt of this infrastructure has been established, now just needs to be upgraded. One investor close to our CEO is predicting 7 to 8 billion in net profits by 2020. That is equivalent to about 40 per share in earnings. With a 50 PE, the stock would be 2000. It doesn't end there. They built a 5 billion dollar massive plant for a reason. Best product at best price. Sounds like an easy decision for the utility and business leaders to make. We at least get a look at every major deal. The cars are going to happen, the storage market is ready. That is why the stock commands a premium. Period."
"Folks, just so you know this is not happening on any small volumes!!! You are toast if you are not getting out now and waiting for the market to open, you can easily witness 22-25% crash in this pig today."
"Tesla is in green just because of emissions credits, not because of cars. And it has been like this for 5 quarters now.As other EVs manufacturers produce their cars they won't have anyone to sell emissions credits to.OVERVALUED!!!!"

I THINK THEY WILL DRAG IT DOWN TO LOW 600 BEFORE TSLA CAN SEE 700-800 AGAIN
"Elon is playing with the shorts. Tesla deliveries have already crossed 500,000 for the year. I placed my order just today!"
$TSLA SP should be around $100. There is no fundamental reason why it should be trading at greater than 1000x forward P/E.
"don't forget - at pre-split, it is still at $3,000 per share when:- the company is burning cash every day aka negative cash flow- high risk in missing earning targets as it is selling at a huge discount for model 3- offering financing options aggressively when auto loan default is rising due to pandemic- trying to raise billions of dollars every quarter to cover operating expenses- no more stimulus relief fund in 2021 and the company needs to grow at 100% to meet the target- expanding factories hoping to see a cost reduction when demand is softening (the worst scenario in any business)- insiders/institutions and the company are selling their stakes since the splitI see some people saying TSLA is profitable - are you serious? read the financial statements. the company is burning so much cash right now."
"If you pre-pay for a Model Why, you may never see your money or car ever again. Once this thing goes into bankruptcy, it'll probably go to some rich debt writers first. Customers and bag holders will be left with nothing but a car with no support and some pink sheets"
28% short interest! Wow.
I must say that I'm impressed how resilient the stock price is. Several stocks that I'm following dropped 15%-20% this week on just the hint of bad news. Telsa has had a constant barrage of bad news and yet taken over 4 months to drop about 23% from around $313 at the start of the year.
$2500 easy tomorrow!
Going up today! sit back and watch!
Wednesday AH will be another Tesla Tequila stock rise!
Ok Elon...time to tweet about Tesla
"Don't trust that analyst. Tesla is a great company. It is not only an auto company, but also a technology company. More products will come out in the near future. Elon Musk is extremely talented and created. Hold shares. It will go up to $1000/share soon."
"Tesla outperforms S&P500, Dow 30, Nasdaq, and Russell 2000 today. Where are these bears talking that stuff now?"
"Is it true that China is going to ban Tesla in its markets due to safety concerns, are we selling today?"
"Sektor thinks big money lords want to test mrs. woods buy at 620, because if they can break it, 590 would happen quick. So much competition, getting stronger 520 could happen.Sektor"

"News Alert CATALYST for TESLAFeb 25, 2021[Tesla Inc will be providing its Megapack technology for the project]Neoen lines up government funding for big battery in Australia MELBOURNE, Feb 25 (Reuters) - France’s Neoen has won A$160 million ($128 million) in cheap finance from the Australian government to help fund what will be one of the world’s biggest batteries, which it said is on track to be up and running later this year.The energy storage project, dubbed the Victorian Big Battery, will be able to produce 450 megawatt hours (MWh) of electricity, more than double the capacity of Australia’s first utility scale battery, also run by Neoen.Neoen has not disclosed the total cost of the project.The government’s Clean Energy Finance Corp (CEFC) decided to provide debt for the project to help the country’s push toward cleaner, more reliable and cheaper electricity.""This project is a world-class example of how utility scale batteries can help electricity networks support a higher penetration of renewable energy,"" CEFC Chief Executive Ian Learmonth said in a statement.As previously announced, Tesla Inc will be providing its Megapack technology for the project.""With the help and hard work of our partners, Tesla and AusNet Services, we are on track to deliver this project before the next Australian summer,"" Neoen Australia Managing Director Louis de Sambucy said in a statement.Neoen secured financing for the project just three months after winning a Victorian state tender to supply up to 250 MW of capacity. The battery will help prevent blackouts in Victoria and New South Wales, Australia’s most populous state, during summer months.($1 = 1.2544 Australian dollars) (Reporting by Sonali Paul; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu)"

"""champagne wishes and caviar dreams."""
EVERY OTHER COMPANY WANTS TO BE TESLA BUT CANT FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE TESLA LOL. THEY WILL HAVE TO TOTALLY RE INVENT ALL THEIR FACTORIES ALL THEIR PRODUCTS. ALL WHYLL SELLING LESS SUPERIOR EVS AT A LOSS WHYLL THE GAS PORTION ( which is majority) implodes lol. Not a pretty picture for other oemS. Mean while Tesla balance sheet is doubling. Building three new factories releasing improved new products and services. Beating estimates from before pandemic with factory being shut down. Tesla is taking over and the automobile market is theirs now.
"Upside possibilities: to reach a price of 1000, Tesla shoulda) 1000% increase of earnings to justify a multiple of 150b) increase of number of vehicles to no less than 15 million units per year (from existing 500k)c) maintain high prices as today and assume no other competitor will launch EV's at the same scale."
Selllll to me! I will gladly buy your discounted TSLA shares
"The company delivered 499,550 vehicles during 2020, above Wall Street estimates of 481,261 vehicles"
I lost the hope that this will break above 660 these next 2 weeks.
"EU is up too, last Friday a lot of put options were bought by retail investors.Market makers in general went neither extremly long nor short; they are positioned long overall. (not particular Tesla)"
GOING TO 1000 THIS WEEK. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT A CHART OF DELIVERIES FOR THIS YEAR ANF LOOK AT HOW IT GROWS. THEN LOOK AT THE POP ON LAST QUARTER EARNINGS ON MUCH LESS SALES. STAY LONG BIG POP COMING TO NEW HIGHSONLY QUESTION IS HOW HIGH????
Haters will try to find anything to criticize to make up for the fact that they've been wrong for the last up to 10+ years on Tesla.If Elon ordered a salad for lunch they'd say he should have ordered soup. They'll look for anything to unleash their hatred for this man and the company he runs.
"A neighbor shows up at my house with a brand new Tesla Model S, I ask him when he bought it and he says ""No I didn't buy it I got a great deal on a two year lease."" This was in the third quarter, I now have a better understanding how they met their numbers."
Bitcoin investment is certainly out-of-mind move. I would be surprised if the stock is still green at the closing. Expecting the stock puling back just for this move.
Just hold it. Big funds starts massive buying in 3 ..... 2 .....

NIO FAR BETTER CAR ...
Gap up to 352 tomorrow morning.
Imagine thinking you know where a company is going better then a guy who can land rockets?
Oh oh this is good today my 2016 Model X is finally in the shop needing a repair this will be the first dime that I will spend on my 4 year old model Y. My 3 year old Chevy Equinolx a year younger has needed a $300 battery and 5 service visits for oil changes and the like. Next service on the Chevy will require front brakes. Again I think I’ll buy more Tesla on Monday
"Some on this forum have said......”great, TSLA is coming back.” My gosh, where did these people learn how to invest? TSLA share price has become so incredibly overvalued with this kind of “thinking” SP is destined for sideways to down movement until rational valuation is achieved.Please be advised......TSLA vehicle sales have grown with SATURATION occuring shortly after introduction to new markets......I.e., California sales down 35% Every European country has declining sales. China sales are already stagnant to down. Japan sales are virtually nonexistent.I repeat......TSLA has shot its wad”"
"Interesting how the shorts focus shifted from EV will never be mainstream to despite Tesla’s 10 year head start now there will be too much competition. YET, any company can make a smart phone and ear buds, there are dozens of streaming platforms, and every retailer sells online, all while Apple, Netflix, and amazon are at or near all time highs. Maybe it’s not going to be so easy for the “competition”"
Would love to see Tesla run over FB market cap by this Friday.
"Even if $TSLA gets cut in half, it will still be above it's 200 day average price. Kudos to the longs who were smart enough to sell above $800 while the bag holders were buying."
"Sandy Munro speaking in his latest Elon Musk Interview, tells us what happened after the interview. ""After our interview finished Elon said ""we are having a design review if you wanna stick around.""We spent 2 hours at the design review. I was blown away. I've seen dozens of CEO's. I've never seen a CEO ever that knew more about a product, that knew the details of a product, that could bring an idea,"" than Elon Musk."
Don’t even try to justify this insane valuation... it makes you sound scared and insecure
"Nothing to push the stock Higher anymore from now on. PROFITABILITY This is the future Problem for Tesla.Selling cars with losses or without profit is not very smart, isn't it ?They've reduced their prices several times in 2020 in order to achieve the difficult target of 500000 cars.Tesla will definitely not achieve their new target of 750000 cars in 2021.Mission impossible in a very competitive environment everywhere.In China NIO and VW, In US GM and Ford . In Europe , to many to name them."
"Too risky to ""Buy dips"". This stock is now done. Downside risk is big."
Bought the dip!!! Thanks for the sale!
NIO invests in its company. TSLA invests in BITCOIN.
"Holding up extremely well, considering... S&P entry is paying off, institutions holding, acting as a buffer."
Gotta get a job in Austin!!!!
Some really positive news coming on earnings call. I expect Tesla will be >1000 by Monday.
"Let say if Elon musk come out next week and say we have found a way to make battery go for 1000 mile per charge, I wonder how much the stock gonna jump loll"
"It's interesting how everyone wants the SEC to do something about GME, but they didn't say a word about when the same thing happened with TSLA."

"$1500 in memory of Nikola Tesla, happy birthday bro!"
Would love to hear from anyone about the 13 point swing today. Had been so weak then started off down big and turned around and went through the roof. Assume it was just euphoria over the potential for an increase in the production rate? I trade this both ways on the swings so it's good for me but this one was bigger than I expected.
$TSLA anyone who is selling will buy again before the battery day. Bears are only helping longs to add more shares.
hold strong longs this will not last wall street money will come back pouring in to stocks and out of bonds
"I clearly remember October 17, 1987. I was driving across town to the factory from the engineering center. It was about 1 hour after the market opened and the market was already falling. Then it recovered for about 1/2 hour, then resumed falling more. That happened 2 or 3 times during the day and ended the day at the low, down almost 23%. I don't remember any major stock avoiding the fall that day. I was actually not surprised, because on the Oct 16, a program called Wall Street Week featured, among other guests, Marty Zwieg. He was a highly respected market analyst. Louis Rukeyser asked him about the market. That day, Friday Oct 16, the Dow had fallen about 100 points, almost 5%. HE said something slightly out of character ""I am worried........"". He was usually very careful not to be so direct. Rukeyser did not press him to elaborate. I think Louis knew full well Marty might be right on and a much lower market was very close. Little did they know the extent and sharpness of the fall the following Monday. I have never lost the impact of that market psychology leading up to that Monday. I now have a very similar sense for Monday, Oct 29, 2018. If not that day, then sometime during next week. That fall could be sudden and short lived like 1987 or it would be like Oct, 2008 when the steepest part of the fall lasted much of October. I seem to remember 2 or three days that month, the Dow fell about 1000 points during a day. I think the crash we will see next week will be more similar to 2008."

"Peter Sandler raised its price target on Tesla to a Street high of $1,200 per share from $515 a share, with the firm saying Tesla could have new opportunities to pursue for decades due to its target industries currently embracing outdated business models."

I told you again this morning to get out before too late. You did have a fair chance like everybody else. Blame yourself if you did not get to the door!

"Here’s what you need to do with your profits from $AMC and $GME. The market has taken on the false narrative that a virus caused the entire world’s infrastructure to change overnight to all solar and wind. This is simply a false narrative. There’s no doubt that the industrialized world will transition to green energy, but this will take a coordinated effort for the next 15 years.What do we do in the meantime? We change government policies to discourage oil and gas production. Part of this is to limit supply to drive up the price of gasoline and diesel fuel. This makes green alternative energy more tenable because it is cheap relative to oil and gas.In the US, the easy policies of the old administration actually hurt the oil and gas industry. They drilled and drilled until the US became the world leading exporter of oil and gas. Then COVID happened and world wide demand dropped by 8% - that’s right only 8%.So far in 2021, demand has recovered by 5%. As of right now, we are only using 3% less oil and gas than we were. Does that sound like a dead industry? Absolutely not.The meteoric stock price rise of solar companies and $TSLA is a bubble. The profits are not there.Now with oil at $53 and Nat Gas at $2.85 - oil companies are profitable.With oil and gas supply being limited by policy - we can expect oil to be $75 by 2022 and over $100 by 2023 - 2035. This is the last golden age of black gold. The last bull market of oil before the oil majors buyout the green energy companies with the treasure troves of cash they are going to generate over the next 15 years.So...take your profits and buy $OXY $XLE $XOM $CVX $ET & $GEL. You’ll triple your money in two years."
Cannabis is the new TSLA for anyone listening.
"$TSLA still has more room to run hitting $1 trillion before any pullback. And with NIO making advances on many fronts such as development of its own chip , mobile eye partnership Increase swap and charging stations with many charging stations partners Robo taxi , tons of cash , more products line ups , increase production , becoming a household name, excellent service and products China growth and much more It will easily double in 2021 hitting $85-$90 range"
The lack of batteries is what Elon says why they are not building more models like vans and why the Simi is just starting to ram up. My question is where are all the other companies just starting to surface going to buy batteries for there production line.???

"A stimulus bill that gives away 1’900’000’000’000 $ helps the Tesla share to climb 6%, after it fell 23,5% in a month. Ok, it helps a bit, but obviously not much. It's in no correlation to the 1’900’000’000’000 $ give away."

Or is there no such thing as an honest investor anymore?"
"It is probably the functions of ETFs and Derivatives. This is my guess. No sane fund manager will buy it because of requirement from S&P. It is , I think, algorithm driven."

Wonder if these comments about Apple is Elon sending out little clues. He’s known for that.
Valuation is so out of whack and even if you’re bullish you have to agree this is way outta control greed. No stock has ever held such gains over a short period of time. Not invested in TSLA but baffled by this unprecedented gain. Should make for a good story one day.

"Here is my biggest concern with Tesla’s valuation. Leaving a parking garage yesterday I noticed the incredible variety of cars around me. Many different makes and many different models (hundreds). People love variety, their car is part of their identity and what differentiates them from others. Based on Tesla’s current valuation the market is saying someday Tesla will make at least 30-50% of all cars on the road. That would be an incredible assumption because of the desire for variety in the cars we like to drive. I don’t see Tesla able to profitably develop such variety. I think Tesla will grow into a very significant and important company, but they will not be the Apple of cars because the car market seeks variety."

Big sell off is coming. No support before 700. All EV companies in super bubble territories. Nothing can last forever.
oh i get it. ev credits will run out and tesla cars lose money. Tesla will be losing so much money soon.. he had to buy and pump bitcoin or else tesla stock will plunge
Record low 15.5M volume traded today. This bubble is topping. No more buyers are going to buy into the bubble. Prepare for the crash.

I’ve never shorted a stock in my life or bought a put for the purpose of shorting but Tesla is too good to pass up. It’s current valuation makes ZERO SENSE. That doesn’t mean I’ll succeed on my puts strategy but I’ll take the risk for the reward. Right now puts are VERY CHEAP.

"It would seem that the Irrational Exuberance is over, wouldn't it?"
"i get it people, you all made a buckets of $$ riding tesla to 800+, but there always come a time to end of all relationships just like marriages, tesla has peaked on the rollercoaster ride, now heading down. All other automakers combine will decimate tesla market share"
GUYS it will so FUNNY if share will jump to 1K or even higher next week or next month :) I will laugh so hard
"So Apple was so certain that Tesla was not worth $60 billion a couple of years ago that they would not even take a meeting and now announce that they have been working on their own car. Quite obvious that the powers that be at one of the worlds most valuable companies think it would be far cheaper and easier to build from scratch than spend the money on Tesla. Obviously all the ""Investors"" know far more that Apple.On top of that Musk said that his stock was overvalued at $160 billion. What CEO does that? Pyramid Scheme on the backs of the little guy who don't know any better. The rich get richer."
The real value of the company is 20B at maximum..be carefull.Are you seeing more Teslas on the road than 2 years ago? NO!

Longs will buy a Tesla with the gains they made from $TSLA
everytime there is a new price target. We hit it in a few days.
"More good news for shorts :-D""Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has raised his price target on $TSLA to $560.00 (from $500.00) while maintaining a Neutral rating. He also raised his Bull Case to $1000 from $800."""
The fact that there is so much downward pressure on this stock keeps me buying long. Eventually 85% of the shorts and bears will own Tesla shares. It’s like amazon 15 years ago. Only then will I sell
WOW CONGRATULATIONS  Reminder Cramer said .....RMO & NGA are the EVs best to follow the $TSLA rising
"In 1914 Ford drastically increased workers wages to almost double the average working wage. First to get better workers but an added bonus, workers could afford the car they were making.""It's widely believed that Henry Ford also upped wages to expand his market — paying employees enough to buy the cars they made. While that wasn't Ford's main motivation, it was a welcome byproduct, and a game changer, says University of California, Berkeley, labor economist Harley Shaiken.""I see something similar going on here in the Tesla stock price going up. Investors in Tesla stock seeing the value of the stock raising so much they can now buy a Tesla. I'm just curious how many have bought a Tesla product, car or solar panels, from the money they made on their Tesla stock? I'm guessing people have done this with Apple stock and products but the Tesla products are big ticket items. This could be a game changer in the stock market."
We didn’t miss by much longs ...695 
If it continues to drop another 5% or even 10% I’m holding. I have no doubt it will be at $900 in 6-8 months
remember tsla 52 week low is 70
"Open Challenge to Tesla Bulls: Justify to me that Tesla is ""the future"" Please use numbers, real ones with some support, not pie in the sky ones like some analysts.

"If you really are invested in $TSLA for the next 5-10 years these jumps and or dips don’t mean anything in the long run, it’s just nice to see."
Shorts are extra crispy right now.
"RED, all other tech stocks GREEN!"
I smell a CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT soon...
They are doing payback for the tweet. Shorting the stock. Do not sell
"Well jp Morgan or any other analysis was much expected , price was to be dropped ahead of S&P, no surprise JP Morgan must be taking in a big chunk of shares this week.Just a market manipulation"
Don’t sell guys it will go to $800 by Thursday momentum is super high for Tesla right now
Cathy - Buy the dip @ 725. (lol!)
TSLA has been an incredible trade thus far. It has a very big target on its back and shots are being fired from many different barrels. Too much competition on the horizon for TSLA to stay at this valuation. Shorts will have their day and TSLA will pull back to a more reasonable valuation.

Stock was clearly manipulated to close at High. Anyone who were attentive at the final closing time would have realized that the stock was artificially and purposely closed at 695. to screw S&P and help Elon and GS. Job Well Done. GS is great. It is true.
anyone know how long until FSD thats 99.99999% safe ..I hear alot of stuff the last four year and I see cool videos on instagram but how close are they really

What was the real close price??
Kiss the 600s goodbye!
lol your funds are secured with Elon hahaha
This upswing was predicted. Since Tesla joins DOW on monday
Really nice support yesterday. Hard support @600 with retail investor support @680/700
There has been some debate about what’s going to happen tomorrow with the options expiration. I’m pretty curious to see how it plays out. Not concerned either way as I know it’s heading up long term ... but may buy more if there are any opportunities because I think that will be last chance for a while.
"280 is still too expensive. That's $1400 pre-split. Yeah, that's how crazy Tesla got.."
Big institutions want you to sell and want the price to drop before inclusion people time to beat the big institutions if everyone hold on this will be huge buy and accumulate

"Anyone referencing 1600 PE or the per vehicle multiples has no idea how to value stocks (relative to growth rates). This company will have $100B revenue in the next few years, and could eventually earn 10% plus profit margin. That's $10B earnings, on $800B market cap today. So that would be 80 times earnings in a few yrs. Avg stock in the Dow is 20 times earnings currently and is fair valued. Tesla will still be growing 4 times as fast as the avg stock in a few yrs, so this stock is priced reasonable. Not cheap, but not anywhere close to the overvalue people on here and elsewhere are talking about. They don't understand how to value stocks."

"Apple come up with a decent, reliable car? You must be kidding, their phones aren't even right the first time they come out. Tesla owns the EV market!"
Tesla will crush. A lot of the holder of Tesla have very little experience in stock investing. The fear will crush them
Selling TSLA @ $650 is like selling a few quarters for a hundred bucks. My recommendation: Take the money and run!
Actions are more powerful than words.

Back in 2014 I remember I was on an investing forum I cant remember which one and I remember this one comment from this one guy... that said Elon Musk would be the richest man in the world... I laughed and replied basically all the reasons why Tesla is overvalued... man did that guy have it right one of the few times I will admit my error and take my L gracefully.

"Been a lot of scuttlebutt on here about Tesla reaching $900 and even $1,000, sooner rather than later.Seems that $900 is being quite elusive. Could this be the week since this is only Tuesday? Something tells me it's still going to take a little time to break and stay above $900 on a consistent basis. No news or info telling me that. Just a feeling.Anyone have any intelligent thoughts?"
What is the closing price? 695 ?

"Re the huge number of suspension/steering component failures in Model S cars, could there be a simple answer?Battery cars eat tyres twice as quickly as conventional cars because they weigh twice as much.

"tesla's plan is to sell 5 million cars by 2030. The funny thing is that given today's market capitalization, 5 million cars are still totally overvalued. at least 8 times as much. so please stop dreaming and start calculating. the share is now only driven by news and these are deliberately controlled. in addition, we have only seen insider sales since a year. please start thinking clearly and stop dreaming."
Tesla’s fall will be taught in classrooms in the years to come
Food for thought.Tesla an $850 stock has an EPS of $0.64 per share.GE an $11 stock has an EPS of $0.58 per share.GM a $54 stock has an EPS of $2.23 per share.AAPL a $155 stock has an EPS of $3.70 per share.I don't think Tesla is overvalued at all.
"Elon, yes. How does it feel to be the richest man on the planet ? That's strange, Now back to work.You have to believe in the work ethic as well as the company."
so was the stock up today on the fake news about some deal with Con Ed and energy storage which we realize is not cost effective or if it was fake news about a number tracker for model 3 units built or the fake news about model 3 reaching Atlanta stores. We know it was fake news (since that is all Tesla is about) but which was it.
need 650 tomorrow
tesla will go back up. trust me.
Where are those two Battery powered Teasla Semi trucks hiding today?

"> YOUNG2 minutes ago> There are a couple of bubbles in the current stock market.Clean energy is a bubble because it's the future. Everyone gets excited to buy the future so at some point people buy the right companies but up too far (overbought) and/or start buying indiscriminatingly (ie. the companies that won't prevail in their industries).But it doesn't change the fact that the idea of the investor is right to begin with. When things inevitably come back down (and nobody knows when that is so it doesn't have much practical application) if you want to bet that Tesla will be one of the companies that will get demolished by the market and not all those companies that are far less diverse, far less innovative, far less capitalized and far less faithfully supported by both consumer and investor alike, then you can make that bet. But I wouldn't."
"GOOD NEWS!!! Tesla's ship has come in. Norway is seeing a spike in sales today (it started Friday) and they are the number one seller in Norway today with 32 Model 3's so far today.They are only 23rd best seller on the year however, with 1.2% market share, but that could go up quickly like in December when they jumped by 1,000 units over two weeks. Fun to watch the numbers play out. (P.S. Audi is still the hot seller in Norway and Polestar and Volvo are selling consistently, like hotcakes as are Hyundai and Kia, and Renault. VW hasn't had their ship come in yet by the looks of things)."
400+ up soldShorted to 50040k profits and 40k profits again when the short clears wooohooo!!
"I have to admit scrolling through the board is pretty shocking, to see the number of negative posts about TSLA despite its incredible achievement this year. It is also encouraging to see the number of supporter who believe in this company. I noticed quite a number of shorties talking about TSLA production and delivery achievements as fraud, a common example cited is Enron. Let’s look at the fact, Enronis now bankrupt, and Arthur Anderson, the largest CPA firm in the world is now out of business because of the scandal. We should have faith in the system that Pricewater House has the integrity as a public firm not signing of its report on TSLA, if there is any doubt. I think we have to have faith in the system a bit."
Some of you panic for nothing!! Just hold and get rich$$$ 900 coming this week.

"A short squeeze is a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to technical factors in the market rather than underlying fundamentals. A short squeeze can occur when there is a lack of supply and an excess of demand for the stock due to short sellers covering (liquidating) their positions.[1]Short squeezes result when short sellers of a stock move to cover their positions, purchasing large volumes of stock relative to the market volume. Since covering their positions involves buying shares, the short squeeze causes a further rise in the stock's price. This newly increased price can in-turn trigger additional margin calls and short covering, which in turn may drive up the price further still in a vicious feedback loop. Short squeezes tend to happen in stocks that have expensive borrow rates. These expensive borrow rates can increase the pressure on short sellers to cover their positions, further adding to the reflexive nature of this phenomenon."
TSLA short interest went up by about 1/3 between 12/15 and 12/31 to a total of 60 million shares. Persistent short selling to establish a large position might explain the relatively low volatility following the inclusion of TSLA in the S&P 500 index on 12/18.Was the surge in price from the upper 600's to 880 driven by short covering? Look on 1/27 for the short interest report as of 1/15.
Was on margin so sold my shares do plan to buy back in until this short term selling dries up. Long term Tesla and Elon are great

At the end of the day everybody agrees that Tesla is not a car company.
Tesla is a car company amazons valuation is as high as it is not Bc it’s a store it’s because of its web services division. Making a comaprisob between amazon and Tesla is like comparing a dish in a 5 star restaurant and an impossible burger from McDonald’s.

"There have been four upgrades on Tesla in the last two weeks. It is astonishing that the stock has not moved,"
"Longs, It's obvious that the new share offering has created a over supply issue. Since the new share did not specify any date range, it is probably being sold to the market makers, brokerage, or other banks. I personally I am just letting this thing blow through, and hopefully they can blow through most of it today. Remember this is just $5 billion stock supply out of the $70 billion+ demand out there. Of course everyone has his/her plan, this is my plan. Good luck everyone."
"Tesla is unusual in the way it reports some of its key financial metrics. When calculating gross margins — the sales price of a car minus the direct costs of manufacturing — traditional carmakers include research, development and engineering costs. Tesla does not, which tends to make its margins look better."
Just my viewpoint on Bitcoin risks. Why not invest in Square? That way you have a viable fintech and their additional involvement in Bitcoin.

"well followers, we see that the Real Deal W , has once again supplied actionable accurate info to you. The inclusion transpired essentially spot on with my recent analysis of how it was proceeding , which, I note was given long before it unfolded. The high achieved, was of course , at the 16:00 o'clock est close, at $695, which though breathtaking on the level of the year long rally, was not hugely above the previous high on Dec 9 , of $666ish in premarket, which is VERY much in line with the parameters I had indicated. And note that after that one moment high was acheived, even before today's general market risk off event, TSLA shares traded down in postmarket on friday. I stand , very much, by the MAIN communication/analusis I have repeatedly posted in the last month or so, that sometime between the HIGHS achieved by the inclusion and the jan 15 2021 option expiration, there will be a VERY significant weight on the stock exerted by that option expiration which has HUGE open interest and and associated Total DOLLAR VALUE of the series, which is positioned to create selling pressure on the stock, at the appropriate time.........WATCH and LEARN..........................."

"Buying the ""dip"" last week was not fruitful. At current valuation levels, the risk of a downside is higher than any upside. Tesla has now many fronts open: Bitcoin volatility (a self inflicted wound), competition heating up the market (not any more the pioneer), serious issues of profitability powered by huge capacity expansion not justified (another self-inflicted wound), and macro changes: interest rates and inflation picking up in an alarming way, which will discount violently the value of the equity market."

MODEL Y CHINA SALES WILL BE HUGE>>>>AND TESLA MAKES MORE MARGIN ON MODEL Y<<<< >>GOING UP NEXT STOP 1000>>>WE ARE NOW ON THE ROAD TO 1500 BOYS AND GIRLS.
Tesla will test $500 this year.
"I think Tesla is now an overpriced car company, not an underpriced tech company"
"News just out today. Apple, Amazon and Taiwan Semi cooperate and are now making a Lidar chip for both Apple BEV and Amazon BEV. Obviously other tech titans think Lidar is a necessity for level 5 auto pilot even Elon Musk ridiculed Lidar technology."
Don’t sell. Play dead. - many studies have shown how the brokerage accounts of dead people (those that don’t sell or buy) do much better over time than people who try to time the market. I traded TSLA twice over the past year and would have done better if I just held on to my stocks. I went all in at $152 and have stayed there since but I would have done 90k better if I didn’t sell and buy back at a higher price.
This stock should be trading at 125 not 700. It will adjust and look out when it does. Losers everywhere. The cars aren't that great. many problems people just don't care. They would buy poop on a bun if you told them too.
800+ tomorrow
has Elon Musk fixed all his robots yet? He has been sleeping with them in his factory for weeks already.
Why is tesla down in pre-market when bitcoin is up 2% overnight??
Not sure if anyone actually read the shareholding company that sold some of its shares was governed to do so in order to balance their clients portfolios. Had nothing to do with them actually WANTING to sell shares. $TSLA 600
Shortyyyy - come out to play ayyyy
"Here's one reason why articles from Benzinga are full of sheet: There's just happens to be an article from Benzinga on the Yahoo Finance front page that says ""Elon says he wants the Tesla Roadster to be able to hover 6 ft above the ground"" Really? Elon says? More like Benzinga just made the whole thing up...!"
it’s trading where it is at this high premium price of +850 is in fact due to a combination of stock split and sp500 entrance. a little to do with business value generation. meaning the stock is way overpriced.
"Just remember, did you buy the hype, run with the herd??? Zero difference between retail hype vs hedge/banker hype (ie $gs) Someone has to be on the other side.....and nobody cares if you win or lose, nobody.$nok $gme $koss $tsla $amc"
"$TSLA short int is $8.93 bn; 39.04 mm shs shorted; 27.67% SI % Float; 0.73% fee. Shs shorted down -708k shs, -1.78%, in Sept as its stock price rose +1.4% and fell by -27k shs, over the last week. Shorts are down -$628mm in Sept mark-to-market losses, including -$497mm today"
Will $TSLA be back to $350?
"Tesla was unstoppable in 2020, but 2021 is a much different story with GM, Ford, XPeng, NIO and many more all bringing competitive EVs to the marketplace. Tesla 2023 growth numbers going forward are not necessarily something they can achieve ""anymore"". GM working with Geely, Black-Berry, Xpeng has FSD and a new car, NIO is planning on manufacturing a less expensive car and they have introduced a new battery tech offering staggering amounts of range with 1000K as an almost average 150KW battery pack, Tesla is scooped by the Solid State Lion IPO spinoff for NIO. And virtually every country now has EVs and most are much lower cost than Teslas and remain unexposed to the EV behemoth. Tesla's blind spot is the sub $25,000 EV auto and I think they will be beaten to the finish line with many other competent EV manufacturers already closer to that goal. Tesla is manufacturing 4 different types Vehicles out of ----> 100-200 different vehicles types used today. <---- ... that will be needed to replace ICE vehicles. When Tesla goes down (which is personally believe 2021 will be the year) it will take the whole EV industry with it, but fast rising names will be NIO, GM, XPeng, Li, Byd and maybe even Ford. ""The future is unwritten"". it's time to ""hedge"""
Hugely overpriced. All hype by Elon Musk. He is pumping bitcoin after buying it. He promoted GME by his tweet. I’m sure many retail investors are trapped now. Please don’t go with hype . Tesla stock is the super bubble of the century
"Way cool, Tesla is reinstated: ""Tesla stock reinstated with sell rating at Goldman Sachs""So exciting...."
OK... we are looking for $875 today... so let her rock...
Model S can't do more than 1/4-lap before overheating and going to limp mode. Sustained output is only 120 HP. Do the Police Depts which ordered a Tesla know this?https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a35386386/2020-porsche-taycan-turbo-s-lightning-lap/
Congrats to all my fellow longs! Time to celebrate - have a wonderful weekend and please stay safe!
aloha from hawaii! i’m short this bubble at $880!! all downhill from here folks.
Come on let us get $600 at the close
If we can get to $700 up loading up. Always wanted to own Tesla.
"Tesla shareholders do not see ""the future""; they see only their imaginations. Many of them have excellent imaginations. The problem is: they are imagining things without a good foundation in science, math, or business knowledge -- knowing science, math and business allows one to imagine future events accurately. Their imagination is delusion because it is based on flawed premises."
"Bloomberg just dropped estimated weekly rate for Model 3 production again, to under 1,600, 3rd time in 4 days, yet still expecting over mid-4K/week in 10 days. 300% increase. That will be an astounding feat."
This is dead money for YEARS.... either that or it will correct at some point.
just stay over 800
I started investing in TSLA stock when there was no Tesla cars on the road. Now every day I hit the freeway I see 5-10 Teslas.........way to go. Am patient.
LAST DAY TO GET IN BEFORE UPWARD EXPLOSION. INSEE TESLA GROWING YEARLY SALES BY 30-50% FOR AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE
Tesla is overvalue. Time to sell.
"Greenhorn Capital, Save yourself and go long $TSLA in 2020! Your fund is doomed if you don't."
I've told you already M'aam - we will return your deposit after we get his deposit. And we are asking him for a bigger deposit so just be patient.
Tesla's near future competition in the US and around the world will be Lucid Motors. Agree or disagree?
Stay long and strong my friends. The market is bad today not just $TSLA.
"P/E of over 1200, no profit except government subsidies and green credits. Like the Titanic the only ones that get off are those that jump off 1st. Institutions usually get out leaving bagholders broke. Time is running short to get out with your skin."
"MMs are trying everything..algos, Gordon Johnson. Stay strong"
"Musk, and Tesla directors are throwing TSLA shareholders under the bus, while they individually invest and pump cryptocurrencies, using Tesla's cash on hand."
Perahaps if your gonna short TSLA then do it for the long term or Not at all?. Could it be that EM and the big guys keep setting short traps\/ Who knows but somethings really strange here.
"When Elon saw the government money that Boeing was squandering, with the promise of going to Mars, he responded with ""I'd hit that"". Now begins a taxpayer funded race to a distant rock, with absolutely zero benefit to those who are forced to fund it, so holders of BA and Elon Musk can carve out their version of paradise on THIS planet."
"news flash: Auto sales are sluggish.......did anyone figure that into estimates or are they just counting on Auto sales to be at or near record highs forever..hmmm...I think not. I am an auto guy and can tell you first hand, there's no way TSLA can survive or endure weakness setting in."
"I know Elon Musk is really smart, so maybe he has already thought of this. Why doesn't TSLA make a public offering of TSLA stock in exchange for bitcoin? Now, there is a really inexpensive way to buy bitcoin, no cash involved. Sort of like Musk's employment compensation.Offer say 100 million shares at the rate of 500 shares per bitcoin (it might have to be more, but I am trying to keep the arithmetic simple). That would ""buy"" 200,000 bit coin. Nice!?If bitcoin goes up in value, this bet is big enough to be a really significant driver of stock value. If bitcoin goes down, so what. It was bought with stock, not cash, so that doesn't really count as a loss does it?"
getting back in @ 450
"Michael Burry from the big short ready to bring the CARNAGE with his short!! Perfect timing and Tesla will be crushed this year. Irrational exuberance will end and blood will be on the streets for this meme stockThis will get ugly for all the naive people on here thinking Tesla will keep going up. History rhymes and this will be a harsh lesson for all those people who margin traded, leveraged and borrowed against their assets."
"Tesla quietly (quietly????) added a new 1,020-horsepower version of the Model X. A mini-van with < 2.0 second 0-60 times. Saving the planet again, eh? There Will Be Blood."
"Please Musk, don't say ""TSLA's too high"". I don't want to experience another 1 day drop"
Will it most likely drop on Monday after addition to snp? Should I sell on Friday?
"Tesla Vehicles Win 1st, 2nd, & 3rd Positions In Used Electric Vehicle Ranking In Germany LESS THAN 1% of all Model 3s EVER delivered are available for sale in Germany, MEANING THOSE WHO BOUGHT THEIR TESLA’s are keeping them. while 51% of all Daimler EQCs are on the used car lots as are ID3’s Audi’s and Zoe’s. BUT NOT Tesla’s as they are bought and held and loved in Germany !"
"With 1,000,000,000 shares outstanding, $TSLA is the most overpriced stock in history.As all the auto companies launching their own EVs, $TSLA will be traded at the level of other auto stocks.Then, $TSLA should be traded at $100 just like what analysts recommended since last year."
Tesla now is like Apple when Steve first found the iphone. Tesla is the future for all of its innovations. Elon's legacy will open the door for many industries to follow.
"Is this a case of you buying the dip, or the dip buying you?"
"Don't let the daily price fluctuation trick you. This is a downtrend, and heading to the $600s. When that fails, it's gap down straight to the strong support at $400. Heroes and heroines trying to catch a falling knife will be able to buy much cheaper in a few weeks."
"Every pump and dump eventually collapses. Elon made the most of this one, but growth is slowing and there is no more ""new"" news coming out. Yes, yes... Elon will keep pumping the FSD and ride-sharing fantasies, the middle school metal-shop monstrosity truck will come out, the semi may never arrive, and Musk might make vague statements about an ""affordable"" Tesla in the future. But the stock will (and must) gradually deflate to come into alignment with market and sales realities. Will slowing fall 50% over the next 3 years."
"An active board of shorts whining is what I like to see as a long. More gains for us. Keep it up, please."
The good news for TSLA is their P/E ratio has come way down to 1256x earnings
"Audi, Mercedes, Jaguar, BMW, Lucid, etc all will have $7500 federal tax credit while Tesla’s goes away. Better interiors, more local service locations, Electrifyamerica locations with 150 kW fast charging. Tesla will need to do something radical to stay competitive. Most buyers can not afford $8000 for self driving - Tesla should lower its price to $2000 as well as drop prices of cars to match disappearing tax credit and keeping free supercharging."
Next month this stock is gonna go up to $1000 a share. Elon has something cooking.
"TSLA dropped, why put options lost $?"
Is tsla next worldcom or enron? Ohhh most here too young to know. Google it!
TESLA WILL HIT 1000 WITHIN 2 WEEKS>>>>GREAT ENTRY POINT HERE
Tesla is a joke. The EV sector bubble is no different to the Internet bubble where every Internet company on the stock market was going parabolic despite all the fundamentals. Many did not have products. EV is not the way forward it requires lithium and other minerals which are hard to source and are not environmentally friendly. It's just moving the problem and not solving anything. More promising is hydrogen technology and every true investor knows this is the future that is why Nikola went so crazy. Hydrogen combustion engines are the future. This bubble will burst when the frauds come out about Xpeng and NIO next year.
Looks like not many buyers to secure guaranteed 65 bucks per shr profit
With today's price action - down 5% on an overall up day - Tesla will certainly see sub 700 before Friday.
Sold 30 Naked Calls at strike price of $680. Do calls expire or will I be assigned?
Just relax. tesla will give an upbeat guidance
One flew over the Orange coco's nest
Can we get a return to $638.00 today?
Haha...Elon gambling with y'all money

"For those of you still concerned about Tesla's PE ration etc, I would like to remind you that Tesla is in the process of building the three largest factories in the world - simultaneously. the largest property in in Texas at 2100 acres. When all of these come online a lot of cars and batteries will be manufactured."
New checks coming! Make sure to invest in the best company that our planet has ever seen. Invest in it and you will get rich. No questions asked!!! Now this might sound similar to the spam e-mails that you receive but don't worry. This isn't a scam!!! God Musk would never betray his followers. Never!
"If Tesla sold every single auto in the world in 2025 (based on projected total global auto sales) at $40,000 each, and earned a 5% profit margin on each sale, the company today would still trade at 7x 2025 earnings. Let that sink in."
Squeeze is not over.. Long way to go
$TSLA $NIOSit down with your friends and family. Don't mention the company name. Just provide info on what they offer. They're going to pick the NIO. I have done this survey so many times with consumers and they always pick the NIO and question why I even offer the TESLA
"TSLA and BTC-USD, thanks to Musk, are now joined at the hip. Obviously, the magnitude of Tesla's interest in BTC is relatively minor, however, the hype and perception, the major driver for which TLSA trades, is high and disproportionate."
Lets take Tesla to $90 as predicted by JPmorgan to weed off robinhooders

"Great landing. Opening the parachutes properly is probably the riskiest part. Hard to insure that cables don't tangle, as happens to some sky-divers. Boeing should have made the ISS trip first after SpaceX' capsule burned up 1.5 yrs ago on the test stand, requiring a redesign. But, Boeing flubbed the software, reading the wrong bytes for the time code from the Atlas V vehicle. Same Indian contract programmers who did the 737MAX?"
ALL HAIL ELON!!
BIG RED FLAG when MUSK is trying to push up BITCOIN price from CNBC!!Why take the risk?
$2500 by summer 
"Much of the smart trading community is talking about how big Tesla is going to fall. Only debate is over the ideal strategy to bring it down. I must say, it's exciting talking to these guys as they understand the options game much better than do I.Can't decide if I'm more excited about seeing the cult rats scramble or Musk and is top enablers (Cathie Wood, Jonas, etc.) suffer."

So many pumpers on this board make a very good contrarian indicator!People are so emotional about this company that tells me exuberance is at or near a peak!A Big rising wedge in the charts! Weekly Chart/ Logscale.Time frame February to Now!
175 million shares just traded... wow... simply wow...
"Tesla Inc’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) investment in Bitcoin (BTC) is a sign that the automaker has “run out of viable internal uses” of its capital, according to GLJ Research analyst Gordon Johnson.The Tesla Analyst: Johnson kept his Sell rating on Tesla’s stock and maintained his price target of $67 on the stock.The Tesla Thesis: Johnson, a long-term Tesla bear, came down heavily on the Elon Musk-led company for its .5 billion dollar investment in BTC.“TSLA took a large chunk of the cash (i.e., $1.5bn, or ~12.2% of the ~$12bn in equity raised in three offerings in 2020) generated from three secondary equity offerings in 2020, and invested it in a highly volatile and allegedly manipulated crypto currency,” wrote Johnson.The analyst said the company had run out of viable internal uses of capital as it did not invest it in research and development or capital expenditure. As per Johnson, the Bitcoin news was released at a time when the company is facing “negative business developments” and is a distraction.The GLJ Research note pointed to declining car sales in China, quality control issues, delay in the German factory, and the inability to obtain the full $1.2 billion in subsidies in that country as the negative factors.The analyst said in his view BTC is an “environmental disaster” as it consumers as much power as the entire country of Switzerland.GLJ noted the potential regulatory pitfalls of the Bitcoin purchase, which they admitted were unlikely.“We see this as a sign of desperation from a CEO whose company is facing real competition for the first time ever,” said the analyst — adding that even if Tesla were to sell its BTC holdings today, it would pocket up to $200 million in profits “that fall 100% to the bottom line, offsetting any losses in its core business of selling cars.”"
My prediction is that the gap down will not be filled :)
TSLA is the king of EV makers. TSLA will be here for a couple of decades beside all competitors. Competition is always good for consumers. Watch out for Solar roof.
this rodeo ride stock will add signifigant volatility to the sp500....
It’s wiping out almost the gains from yesterday. The market has been very brutal lately.
Kimbal Musk is too smart to hold TSLA shares! LOL
"Elon Musk likes having Space X stock not being a stock market issue. He wanted to take TSLA private but it didn’t work out. TSLA is to big now for that. So it’s offering to sell a bunch of new high value stock ($5 billion) to generate cash. He says he may use it to pay down company debt and/or to give the company some financial wiggle room. Certainly a major part of the proceeds will be applied to gigafactory expansion and adding more Supercgargers. People can play the market for immediate gain all they want. All I care about is Tesla and others putting more quality, affordable and safe BEVs out there to replace ICE vehicles The sooner than better."
"I just can't imagine what goes someones mind when buying $TSLA right now. There are so many other better deals on the market and we're still double the price of where we were 4 months ago.What fueled the gains? -over 500k deliveries - not happening this yearI have tremendous respect for Elon and believe that Tesla could be a big player in the future, but right now things look bleak and they have a lot a lot a lot a lot of debt to service"
"Sold AMC , made a beautiful profit and opened a position in TSLA. Couldn’t be happier."
I dont own 1 tesla stock but I know it'll be $1000 very soon. Congrats to those who held firm and believed in what Elon was/is doing!
Shorting Tesla is best investment for 2021 . Satisfaction Guaranteed !!!
"Leroy, is that you buying here at the open to try and save your hero's stock price?"
"Buy the dip, this will close green today!"
I think short ss will be shortest in coming weeks. If it can hold the gain for next few days. Am up more than double and holding all the way for next couple of years at least!
A bit of my MX update. It was cold this am and the car battery was feeling the cold. Charge rate was only at 15 kw. As the battery warms up the higher it climbs. Took about 15 mins to get to 80 kw level.
"GM sold more EVs in China than Tesla <<<==== no problem - just refuse to believe the facts GM == 33,489 EVs sold Tesla = 23,804 EVs sold"
"Oh man, shorts going to cover again today. lol."
"Can't resist so add $5k more ( couple long put expire 15th) This is new level of insanity. While 60K at risk mostly in premium, I think it worth it. I do have 2 short $700 call expire this week as well which I plan to keep rotate until it expire worthless so I don't count that in my losses or risk. Stock somepoint will go below 700. May be today may be month out or may be 6 month out. regardless I will earn great premium."
$tsla was counting on china market.. but I think nio is too strong now.. good luck tsla.. nio is unstoppable.
Tesla Motors works on wireless charging systems that is huge!
Check out the new S and X!!!!
"buyyy, see what happened a week ago! From 790 to 870 in 2 days"
Best headline ever - ((( Watch Tesla's Full Self-Driving travel from SF to LA with (almost) no help ))) The video is awesome. You get to see a tiny portion of the steering wheel and you almost never see the drivers hands - so obviously this can't be faked.

Morgan Stanley hikes Tesla to $810 - CNBC
I don’t understand how people can deny the inclusion into both the S&P 500 and S&P 100 index funds on 12/21 will not be a major stimulus for Tesla stock?
"Tesla cuts the price of its base Model 3 and Model Y cars by as much as $2,000. More sales !!!"
"If Tesla declines 5% a day for 30 days, its still needs to fall another 50% to have a PE of 50.This is awe inspiring."
"Tesla Profitability is depending on scale. Sadly for Elon, he is planning an expansion in capacity thinking that the only EV supplier will be himself. What will happen with all that capacity built when all major competitors will saturate the market with EV, at high scale? Answer: not only zero earnings but huge losses. This industry needs to leverage fixed costs."
"Dilution of less than 1%, with USD 5 billion extra to put at work in their (mega) factories. 'Printing money' to make money. Tesla - because of it's stock price - has now the power to more easily realize its vision and ambitions. In this way the stock price itself becomes an accelerating factor for company growth, which in itself will further support the market cap. Interesting dynamics."
"On an up day for the market, TSLA is down 7%. This is beginning of the end of the monster bubble.. Better sell soon. Or at least reduce below 5% of your portfolio. The downside risk is huge. This was $70 just a year ago. Not much changed for the company. - Solar/energy business losing money- Car quality and production issues- increased competition and price cuts- roboTaxis will not happen for many years."
I put 80k in Tesla today !! I will keep buying all the way down and then explode
"Volkswagen projected to outsell TSLA in EV market within two years. Many other automakers bringing EVs online. When TSLA has real carmaker in their space, TSLA stock price will wither. Not short, just practical."
today predictionlow $792.24high $820.19
"this is outrageous, in UK both HL and Freetrade are not letting me get Tesla. There is a US stock block. so illegal..."
the truth will prevail. TSLA has proven to be selling cars like pop corn. Buy buy this discount level. and hold . TSLA cars is a fact. Earnings in last year skyrocket. Demand of nice and reliable car is a fever
This is gonna be the biggest collapse in US stock market history
"Nothing beats tesla, Christmas is coming and it’s going to be good"
Does everyone really think Elon has serious intentions of take private deal?
"Confirmed, TSLA is going into the bitcoin mining business. fElon has realized he can make more money from bitcoin than he can ever make from cars. All tesla cars will receive updates to turn each car into a mining rig.BUY BUY BUY !!!"

I'll be a buyer around 320. Higher than that I don't have money for.
On what date will Tesla report Q4 deliveries? Cant find a date for some reason. Thanks
Tesla reports quarterly results in January. If the results are not super spectacular this will be a sell off like no other. The stock is currently priced way above perfection... I am taking my profit and sit on the sidelines....
Musk says tsla needs robotaxis to justify current valuation....
"margin calls coming , forcing dales"
Reducing position before close to manage risk but feeling good that we have seen the bottom of this pullback.
"below 800 today,"
Typical TSLA action to ealk shares down then announce something shattering... like new aircraft breakthrough or the 40 second charge battery. Buying at these amazing levels!
If stock go down in a correction this year TSLA stock can go down more than 40% and Bitcoin will go up more than 40%. Elen a visionar
$AAPL + $FSR = iCar FSR got it all when it comes to match up to TSLA's cars. $AAPL wants to have a big bite of TSLA which AAPL missed it a few years back when it could have eaten the whole $TSLA when presented by TSLA to AAPL. Now AAPL wants to have it all by acquiring $FSR. Time will tell.
grandpa joe effect in the market. he don’t care about america
"I just laugh and laugh when people talk about Tesla's multiple revenue streams - ha ha ha! Insurance? There is a fully developed, cut-throat car insurance industry already. It is a low profit game. The ONLY reason Tesla offers insurance is because no one else will insure their vehicles at a reasonable rate. There is no profit in this for Tesla. Software? At $11,000 the FSD is a very, very expensive option on an already expensive car - a niche market at best. Autonomous ride-sharing? This is several years away at best and then who knows how long it would take to be profitable. Using a $50K car for a taxi is not wise - it will be vandalized, #$%$ in, puked in, and messed with. Do you ever see Uber drivers in $50K luxury cars? Nope - and there is a reason for that. Charging network? Um.;.. the argument all along is that people charge at home. Plus there are other charging networks that server ALL EVs - not just Teslas. Power? The power industry is old, developed, competitive, regulated and has low profit margins. None of this adds up. Tesla doesn't even make profit on their cars yet! Were it not for carbon credits (and now bitcoin appreciation) Tesla would be broke."
"Happyretirement, mortgage your house and buy both Gamestop and Tesla , they’re going to the moon."
This dip is a gift... I wish I could buy more. Congrats to all the longs & new investors who bought with me! Ps its best to ignore the bashers and their nonsense on this board 
"Did Tesla ever get the seats to fold on the Model X?... is there a reason they couldnt do it when every other SUV does?Im thinking it must have something to do with the doors?Heck, the Bolt has more cargo room than the X?"
Wouldn’t the world be a better place if Elon ran for President . Being born in South Africa  I think throws a wrench in that thought 
"I am a long term Tesla stock holder and I am shocked that it goes higher and higher. Don’t get me wrong, I love it going up without and definitive reason but its astonishing to see it go so high, just when I think it is at it peak to stay, it shoots up!"
It wasn't even a bad result in the 1st place. Tesla is still making solid profits n the co. is expanding..
900 or 850 tomorrow?
Question. Anyone knows why the indexes are selling off?
Tesla is turning cars into computers like Apple did with phones. Logging millions of miles of data for its AI tech while startups are just now fumbling around with concept cars.
"Elon all in on BTC, sold Tesla share to buy in."
Elon Madoff invested 1.5B in BTC
"Just like after being added to the S&P. Red for a little bit and then a nice jump. Only difference, the jump has come earlier!"

Can someone keep a watch on Musk. He may do something to himself.
"Sell now, time to invest baba!"
How many coins does it take to buy a garbage truck? Lmao. Hey wanna buy a coin and buy a car? What happens when my coin is worth 50cents?
After hour continue upwards surge... sorry shorty. Not wise to short a great company.
The Standard & Poor people must be glad they added Tesla into their index just in the nick of time. Tesla shares are single handedly pulling up the S & P 500 for the last 2 days!
And if you do your homework to see how many out of 17 million are sold under 25k you would be shocked to think tsla will make profit.
Heading towards a full day's trading volume of 6 million shares during the first 1/2 hour of trading.Be thankful that the market makers are maintaining an orderly exit without anyone being trampled by orders failing to be executed.
We will break resistance 651 and we will see 700 tomorrow EOD. Good luck to all longs!
Anyone have a pre market quote for TSLA?
Someone tell Elon he should start a TeslaCoin. A legit coin that people could buy and sell Tesla energy. Makes more sense than buying bitcoin or dogecoin
"ACRX break-out ALERT, 400% upside 2021. top 2020 winners TSLA, $NIO $DOCU $AMZN"
"doesn't make any sense why this company doesn't have a market cap of 10 tillion. I mean come on its going to be the only energy, car, and battery company in the world soon....all competitors will be drove out of business.....lol "
Why doesn’t Jay Powell just direct deposit billions into Elon’s bank account. It has the same affect as easy money policy.
Tesla up 2.15% in Europe
$1000 after earnings
"where are all the buyers??? over leveraged, no cash, 20-30% going in a week....maybe more for some. I'm sure you blame capitalism"
I long Tesla but I don’t like the Bitcoin being related.
This really could head down to 200.... no positive indications and a CEO that’s obviously throwing out over optimistic comments about their production and sales that they expect
In one year we will be worth $1 trillion.
Too many risk takers chasing dreams. Will end badly
elon is gambling with company dollars!
Funny when a billionaire tells you to not sell a share of stock even if it starts going down. Lolol
Slow demolition. Big funds selling slowly everyday
"In Germany Tesla is a marginal players in the EV niche. Coincidence - Germany has a domestic auto industries. In France Tesla is being pushed aside. Total Coincidence - France has a domestic auto industries. In Japan - Tesla sells almost nothing, Another amazing coincidence - Japan has a domestic auto industry."
My ave TSLA price is $835. I’m quite worried with its current price.
Wondering if I should sell my Amazon and pick up another 150 shares of Tesla???? Thoughts
Are we partying like its 1999!!! Oh wait...that didn't end well!!
"Seems like it would have been worth it for Elon to just buy the 500 Teslas, to reach 1/2 mil, and give them to his friends..., oh, never mind."
"Is this the future of TESLA´s share price ? What is your opinion ?Tesla valuation completely detached from fundamentals On the contrary, Tesla's stock is now so far detached from the company's fundamentals that it now exists ""in a kind of valuation twilight zone."" After all, the e-car maker is now more valuable in terms of market capitalization ""than the entire auto industry was at the start of 2019."" With a current market capitalization Tesla is even ahead of Warren Buffett's investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway ($542.4 billion), except that Berkshire reported EBIT of $106 billion in the last fiscal year, while Tesla's was -$0.6 billion. This fact alone is remarkable. In addition, however, Tesla is increasingly having to fight for its market position in Europe. After all, the competition has now also realized that electric vehicles have great potential for the future. Furthermore, the car market is generally tied to the development of the economy and would grow at its pace, if not slower. ""To justify the current price, Tesla would have to dominate the global car market in the next few decades, and there is little evidence of that,"" Cornell Capital summarizes. The three scenarios But what does this mean for the future of Tesla stock? In order to come up with three future scenarios here, the analysis firm took a closer look at the electric car maker's numbers and derived a base, bear and bull forecast from them. Spoiler: None of the scenarios foresees a further increase in Tesla's share price. For the base case scenario, Cornell Capital Group assumes ""rapid growth and industry-leading operating margins for Tesla."" For this case, Tesla stock should end up at a price of $144.71. Measured against the current share price, this would represent a whopping 77 percent drop. The bull scenario also assumes stronger growth, but only arrives at an implied share price of 301.11 U.S. dollars. And then there is the bear scenario, which continues to assume that Tesla is a ""successful carmaker"", but sees the share price at just 72.71 US dollars - a discount of almost 89 percent. According to Cornell Capital, this analysis shows that ""Tesla is not only overvalued, but unleashed."" So what to do if the stock market experts have their way? Sell Tesla shares short."
We need a split before the production of the semi and the truck.I need more share.
there is nothing but hope holding this bloated stock from crashing. Nothing makes any economic sense for the firm
"We all assume Big institutions are confused and disorganized and waiting for market to open to storm and buy. No. It is not the case. Everything is predetermined and it will be done in an organized manner just like Drs doing a bypass surgery. Ledger entries would be made, stock volume changes without any change in price volatility. That is how it will be done. Watch."
"My prediction for Tesla total all time U.S. deliveries on June 30th: 199,995. It'll take a poor 1st quarter, but that may be the plan; the less you make, the less you lose. Elon will take credit for lower sales, to help out da common folk."

"Buy after hours and accumulate. The more we buy and hold, the more explosive to burst to the moon . Shorties are playing with fire by now. TSLA 1200 breakout is coming. March is the season for buying more cars. Income tax refund always boost car sales. Buy and accumulate is the key. Trust in EPS/revenues. Truth will lead and prevail"
Rising interest rates = the end for Tesla. Tesla relies on capital markets for mere survival but the days of easy money are coming to and end.
THIS WILL HIT 875 today stay long huge innovations coming this year. With full self drive semi and cyber truck slated for this year. This stock will explode to the upside
Im not even invested in TSLA but i love watching it go up. The future is in their hands
Glad I bought more this morning! Great Stock!
This is about to pop back up look for 900+
"Tesla's recent software update includes moving the driver's profile to the cloud so that it syncs automatically when you enter different Teslas. this means they preparing for the Tesla Network, which could be a ride sharing or short term leasing / renting option."
"Hi Elon, You raised ETSY the other day, you supported Reddit and GME and today it’s BIT. Do you think you can find time to give your loyal stockholders a leg up?TSLA reached a high of $900 last week before earnings now TSLA is $817. Do the math. Thx"
tesla has an expected earnings growth rate of 60.5% for the current year. It has a long-term growth rate of 32.9%. The Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2% over the last 7 days.
"Tesla can get to $2500 in 3 years , based on Munster reviews.Ark Invest said $7000 !So, which one ?"

Musk considers selling a lot of tesla shares and buying bitcoin exchange with it under tesla.
Quick question to my Tesla people. Why did Tesla use Lidar on some cars recently?? Is Elon musk having a change of heart on lidar technology?? And if he does will will that have a negative impact on Tesla shares ??
So tired of hearing the “Tesla isn’t profitable without emission credits” baloney. Capex was over 3 billion in 2020. Emission credits a few hundred million per quarter. What that means is if Tesla would stop pouring money into building the most efficient factories in the world they’d be wildly profitable now. Building the factories is the right move of course. The emission argument is bunk.

"nothing to worry about boys, whole ev market looks down rn"
TSLA SP is going down on low volume. This is terrible news for longs. Buying volume is drying up. Even lower volume than yesterday!! (Yesterday was a trading day with record low volume)
"I see what chamnath is saying. TESLA is not a car company. It is actually an Energy company. The market for Energy is about 30T so in this scenario, tesla only has captured less than 2% of the market. If they grow to 4%, that doubles the entire stock price."

"Upside versus downside. Upside: with a manipulating tweet from Elon could go to 900..12.5% gainDownside: 64 cents per share @ 100 multiple (being optimistic) gives you a price of $64, a decline of 92% of existing price."
$TSLA Price some days is just funny to watch. It’s like a Ping Pong game.
thank god @cosmin can't actually afford a share. if he shorted 100 tesla shares hed be 100k in debt
Why would Tesla reduce prices now if demand is strong?
40 Beer Trucks?..... Verses $75 - $80 mil of t cash evaporating this week. How many trucks do you have to sell to put a dent into in that kind of sinkhole. What is the profit per truck from all borrowed cash? .....Built by an enterprise that is nothing but currently a dream?

"1/3 or 33% of all Model 3s sold in the June month were registered in California and Ontario as per InsideEvs.What happened to demand for the mass production EV? There are another 49 US states along with other Canadian provinces?As said before, no or low subsidies, no real market for EVs. They do not make financial sense yet and have many limitations still.My bet I on HEVs and PHEVs to grow in market share over the next decade or two. I believe BEVs will lag until solid state batteries or other higher density battery technology takes hold a decade or so from now."
"Luxury/sports car manufacturers always have a fan-base much larger than their customer-base. Part of the appeal with luxury goods is that only a few of its fans can afford the luxury item the manufacturer makes. IF Tesla was able to actually mass-produce a down-market car that most of its fans could afford, it destroys its brand value. Consider, if Rolls Royce started putting its brand on a car like a Ford Focus, would the Rolls Royce brand maintain its value and appeal?"

TSLA 700 by EOW!!! 
"Dr Michael Burry from the Big Shot just tweeted this is a super bubble ready to pop. TSLA hasnt had to act like a car company yet, but starting next year their leases will start to get returned. They will be sitting on lots of old cars. Will have to manage selling old vehicles. Margins will shrink. Get out while it’s being pumped."
hello... goodbye
"I laugh every time someone on this blog mentions this stock will be $700. $800 or $1,000.....not if any of these day traders have anything to say about it. This stock is OFF from it's earlier high by $11. Once again, another day of taking from the poor and giving to the rich. Do you think they care? NOPE!"
"From today’s NYT: flyovers of the lots in Burbank, Bellevue, Chicago, Dallas, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City have built a picture of unsold cars. With hoods open, many are non-workable and others are just sitting. The truck companies are not experiencing delays in shipping for others so maybe Tesla has tried to save cash. The article further presumed that the 400,000 orders are not accepting vehicles that end up costing $62,000. Is demand softer than it looks? Tesla claims it is selling all it manufactures but the rear wheel drive may not be wanted. Further severe shortage of replacement parts is occurring. Is this a company in crisis?"
"Musk cuts price of Model's 3 and Y, to help Tesla fans purchase them.He then, via BTC actions, likewise cuts the price of TSLA stock. What a nice fella! Keep the trend going, I say..."
I heard Apple will soon be getting into food delivery business with iCar. Watch out Door Dash. Tim Cook has no clue what to do with the company any more.
"So Tesla EVs have no hope, bitcon is only savior - ha ha ha !!"
"Greetings. I have a question for all of you here. Have you ever owned a Tesla? If you have made a lot of money on T)esla stock and have not bought one, shame on you. And if you can afford a Tesla but have never driven one, drive one today. I am on my second (first was S, second is an X, both pre-owned) and have turned many friends on to it, and they all are as passionate as I am. It just drives way better, and is way safer and smarter and just BETTER. More and more chargers and superchargers are popping up so the charging issue is all but gone and soon gas stations will include charging stations as well. I charge mine using the 220V outlet for my dryer in the garage, works like a charm. Lost my free supercharging when I traded in the S for the X, but it's worth it, the X is just Ludicrous.And can I buy a Tesla in brown or green? No, will I be able to in the future? Probably. Can I buy a Tesla convertible? No, but someday I will. Can you buy a Tesla in New Orleans? Don't think so. Can you buy one in every state? No, but someday but you will be able to. Can I watch a Tesla commercial on t.v.? No, but would that increase sales and awareness? Maybe. Tesla in some ways is in it's adolesence, and I see the future as bright. Is the future bright for Tesla stock? I don't know.that All I know is that I'm guessing that at best, a small per centage of people that can afford a Tesla has driven one, meaning a huge per centage of people that can afford one has not driven one.The future is bright, even with the imminent competition. EV's are the future, and to repeat, if you have made a boat load of money on Tesla stock, then buy one!!!! Why would you not?"
"I hope you all sold or short more, this thing is going to $100 very soon."
Tesla expected to blow last ￼quarter earnings by 13% wahoo!!
Tesla fanbois: people will buy more teslas with stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment.

"shorts are going to get wrecked-------------Tesla EarningsTesla earnings: Wall Street pegs Tesla earnings surging 107% to 85 cents a share, with revenue up 35% to $10 billion. Guidance on 2021 Tesla deliveries as well as updates on the Cybertruck and two factories under construction will be key.TSLA stock is extended, but after looking like a climax run, shares have traded relatively tightly over past two weeks. Tesla stock could be working on a high tight flag."
"Tesla stock tumbled deep into bear-market territoryMany on Wall Street define a bear market as a decline of 20% or more on a closing basis from a significant peak. A close below $706.47, which is 20% below the Jan. 26 record close of $883.09, made the bear market official."
"Tesla $1T+ valuation = $ 2M /car they sale (Which is only business with positive gross margin) = 40 timeNow People talking about Tesla making 10M car. First there is no 10M car market for $50K+ SO he has to bring 20K car.Let's say they reach 10M with average price of $35K. and $5K/car gross margin.their total gross profit is $50BCurrent valuation is 20 time peak revenue gross margin there.Let's say net margin go $2k car, that again hard to achieve but we assume possible. We are talking 50 time peak net profit.Even if you spare another few billions profit from subscription business, they still very very expensive even at peak revenue.All other business, they facing very brutal competition. Solar business they were No.1 now not even No.3Battery business so far all promise and 0 delivery."

Guys Powell said there won't be any inflation for the next 3 years so imagine that. Last year you made 10x. This year you make 10x. Next year 10x and the year after 10x. Now you don't add them but multiply these gains...That would mean that if you invested 1000 dollars 1 year ago you will have 10 million in 3 years. So cool!!! Awesome!
"I told you months ago that Panasonic holds all the battery patents and TESLA pays. Yeah, not just a car company. China XPEG and NIO will take market share away from TESLA cause their government says so and in Europe the Scandinavia’s and Germans have already increased their market share .

I was wrong."
"I'm gonna give you an opinion take it or leave it you make up your mind: tesla has been the absolute most shorted stock, like many billions lost. and with this new surge up, I believe it is due to shorts unable to take it any longer. this cannot go like this forever. at 500 post split this had a potential downfall to 300, at 850 nothings changed and the downfall is still 300. so I urge you to at least take profits. and if your a new trader do some math, you would have to reach 1600 to get 100%. I generally invest only in companies that can potentially reach 400% per year, you wont see that with tesla... on to some advice take it or leave it. #AAPL is getting into the ev spacs with hyundai spilling the beans that they are in talks with apple about batteries etc. #GOEV or canoo will be providing the skateboard and engineering services to Hyundai for their next evs and likely for Apple's. a company that has a market cap of 3 billion. now do you think a 700b company would be a better investment or a 3b company. I can see canoo going to 40 to 50b market cap pretty quickly ( next 5 years) do the math can tesla match that? are they going to be providing everything ever produced? that is where their market cap is going. I've been in canoo warrants at 1.8 and averaged up to 3.5. anything under 5 is a bargain. just some advice take it or leave it. go with your gut, your subconscious or whatever you want to call it."

"I sold all of my Tesla shares around $500, took a nice profit but can’t help but to regret it... when is Tesla gonna be a buy again? Too high right now...."
Tesla stock continues to trade at lofty valuations despite high risks and continued losses.
Here is the formula for Tesla at 500. 10 year treasuries go from 1% to 1.5%. Then Elon issues some new shares. Then the bulls will be run over by other bulls -- as they all stampede to the exits.
"Reddit has a ""framework"" for destroying shorts who harass companies trying to invent or reinvent. I hope the community uses this power to the fullest to bring justice to innovators like Elon Musk being harassed by Short Sellers. Its easy to say now that $TSLA is not the same as $GME, but at one point $TSLA was out to invest a new way of making cars while the short sellers wrote ""misleading info"" just because on anything and everything to destroy the value of $TSLA. (And Citron ended up reversing their position after $TSLA hit $174 and panic investors sold after reading Citrons ""supposedly solid research"")"
Q3 should be fun.....Muskrat will have another break down when analysts start asking the TOUGH questions....I love Muskrat love as he is the shorts best friend.

Tesla revs will surpass fords by 2022...    and then double fords by 2023    Maybe that will wake up the other half to what Tesla is really capable of.

"Declining growth, declining profits, declining production, getting crushed in europe and china now, and worst part the valuation doesnt support anything other than a 20 pe on core eps. We were 400- 500 in dec its going there at a min. Worst 100 or less as death trap ensues. Musk rather talk about dogecoin than invest in service stations etc. he is a fraud"
If yahoo never updates the pe ratio i actually like it. It will become yet another short trap. Smart people will know the real pe. Its actually genius.
Activists and hedge funds sitting with huge funds to jack up tesla stock price after hours. It will be a tug of war between shorts and activists investors other than fundamentals.

New GM EV innovation gonna give a hard time for tesla. GM is on the right track when it comes to EV. Also Ford gonna be unveiling more new EV models to compete with GM and Tesla . 2022 gonna be a tough year for tesla . imagine 2022 to 2024 how EV world gonna lead and compete? Robots taking over Jobs also . example many manufacturers use to have millions of employees and now the big ones maybe 200k employees? look at tesla barely 20% human run and the rest all robots so if every company replace human labor by 80% that's like more than 80% unemployment and I guarantee no smart regulators or anyone thought about humanity and these things way I did? things gonna be bad Elon u r not only one with brain power lol

Valuation is not right for TSLA. 25B revenue expectation and 400B market cap with 0 profit. TSLA should be in the 100-150 range not 400+
Look at JP Morgan's and Morgan Stanley's list of mutual funds.... Both firms have some Tesla buying in front of them so they are bashing because they are buying... I give them three months before they took a different view of the stock and it's a buy buY bUY BUY!!!!

Tesla investors just keep buying and buying. Elon Musk already told you the SP is too high several months ago. Michael Burry of the big short announced his expanding short position. Tesla already missed earnings and is lagging other major automakers in Europe in the EV market itself. Tesla doesn't even make money without energy credits. Tesla's forward forward 2023 PE is 150. So many warning signs that the SP is not supported by rational logic or earnings. The SP is only supported by HYPE and HOPIUM. WAKE UP AND BOOK YOUR PROFITS TODAY BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. DO NOT BE TOO GREEDY.
"Even if earnings come in line with expectations or better, it is factual that Competition is massive in 2021.The future is going to be very bumpy for Tesla. All the carmakers are producing high quality EV in 2021."
"No one mentions that Tesla yesterday presented refreshed S and X. Totally new interior, refreshed exterior Deliveries available from September in Europe! Tesla X plaid"
sold my Model 3 today on EBay It’s been less than 12hrs and I’m suffering from Tesla withdrawal syndrome. Model Y comes Wednesday. Pray I make it to wed. Might need some Valium
"Rare Earth legislation passed last Sunday in the stimulus package. These stocks are ripe for big gains. Linear growth with new EV, Solar, Drone, and Wind Turbine Technology! Stocks near decade lows. REEMF, UURAD, LYSCF, UUUU are a few of the Rare Earth stocks that warrant a look."
Probably bottom out around $400.
"Tesla is million times better than bitcoin. Tesla has a bright future with real assets and products that demand exceeds supply. Bitcoin has oh wait nothing, just a number. My money is on Tesla...the future of transportation, energy and many different products including tequila for a little buzz."
"For what’s it’s worth .. Futures are up , here’s hoping for a green day tomorrow.. we’ve had 3-4 days with futures up and Tesla barley afloat . Let hope tomorrow we can bust out of this rut & get some green"
Looks like people are selling AMZN and buying tsla ...both over 100 PE so who cares till the music stops
"Some selling from weak hands at the end of the day,but rebounded well..........nothing hurt"
Looking for a used car and there are quite a few Teslas for sale with high depreciation rates.
Took a HELOC to invest in Tesla. And it’s worth it. Thanks musk.
"TSLA Bulls.....TSLA is potentially (10X) by 2030. Probably more with $Billion short squeeze in your pockets. These shorts have lost $18B so far this year trying to short TSLA. Why? They have been crying the same fundamentals & PE ratio tune since $400. If you would like to find out about a (49X), stay tune............Elon has more surprises for short sellers. He plans 10 years ahead & he absolutely enjoyed BK Shorts.....There are some CEO that you never sell a stock for cheap. Hold on & get $10M when you sell. There are (35) huge catalysts minimum for the next 5 to 10 years. The most important thing you have to remember is this.....TSLA is (12) different companies in (1). They are not just an EV company.....The Artificial Intelligence with Autonomous single & mini Robotaxi will likely take this to $10,000 pps in 5 years alone. Robotaxi will bankrupt the like of Taxi,Uber, Lyft around the world with planned of 50% Mfg. year-over-year for the next 10 years. GM & FORD are 10 years behind in technology. This is bigger than anyone can imagine..... I still hold my 1,000 TSLA shares since $250. Not going to sell a single share until at least $8,000 to get my MOIB & the rest at $20,000 MIN by 2030. That's about (10X). If you want to find out about my 49X stock, stay tune!!!! My PT after September 22nd (battery day) is min. $3,500 (or $700 A.S). There is a billionaire investing $46.5M on TSLA. Until you understand this colossal planning for the next 10-20 years......you will see the massive potential of this 12 companies in (one). Most of its competitors are 10 years behind its many technology & will likely go bankrupt since they can't compete with TSLA..... These shorts are underwater & don't you even know it. I predict $25 B short bankrupt by year end. As mentioned above, Check out my profile to see my followers and find out my research on GPX-001, since January. This stock GPX-001 is potentially (49X) and GPX-002 is potentially another (150X) if no buyouts. If BO between now and GPX-001 trial halted, easy $5B. If another GPX-001 halted, probably BO will be $20B. Good luck! Always do your own DD before investing. Never followed anyone blindly including me! $TSLA, $GNPX"

"Assuming Apple could grab 5% market share of the electric vehicle market with a $75,000 iCar in 2025 that sports a 7% operating margin, the tech giant would only see a 3% bump in earnings. If Apple sells its electric car for $100,000, snags 5% of the EV market, and drives a 10% operating margin, Hall estimates the bump to Apple’s earnings would be 5%.Not too impressive for Apple given its much higher margin structure currently driven by making less capital intensive iPhones, iPads, and Macs using outside suppliers. But the somewhat subdued earnings accretion from an iCar, as Wall Street analysts call it, reflects the costly nature of making an electric car. Or, a car of any kind — see low single digit percentage operating margins at Ford (F) and General Motors (GM)."
I dont understand WHY you would sell when the future is brighter then ever and the end goal is in sight......lack of vision I guess.....stay hard longs

I sold $CCIV at $59 and started rebuying it back at $29. Lucid has plans for 400k cars and suvs a year from AZ plant alone & had 4.4Billion in cash to quickly become the other big EV player next to $TSLA. Lucid is going to 10X in 2-3 years for those who snag it down here below 30. CCIV is Tesla 2.0 baby!
"At least 90 million more shares, but more likely between 120-150 million more shares need to be exchanged today. The explosion is quietly awaiting to happen. Unbelievable!"

BUY THE DIP FOR MAXIMUM SHORTY ROCKET FUEL
"I had been watching Tesla for years, but never touched the stock because it did not trade in a normal fashion. I knew Elon exagerated everything. The first time I ever believed anything he said was his April 2018 comment... ""We are bankrupt""That's when I took my first short. It has been tough because of the looney far-leftist cultists and the 80% ownership by insiders and institutional funds that keep propping it up. Sometimes I wanted to bang my head against the wall, and once I completely covered with losses. But now I am healthy in the money in a big way. Likely no more frustrations-- Not this time"
"Legacy auto dealers still have huge unsold inventories of 2019 and 2020 ICE sedans, SUVs and pickups. Bargains out there for sure. But more buyers are skeptical of getting a new vehicle that cost over $50 to fill up and only gets 25 mpg. One that requires mandatory parts and servicing an EV doesn’t. The average BEV (with a range of 250 - 300 miles) recharge is about $10. It’s much less if the owner already has solar. Average new ICE car price in US is about $36 K. A new base Tesla Model 3 is $38 K. The EV infrastructure is rapidly expanding offering recharging and servicing approaching the legacy’s. One Tesla rep. said “Almost everyone, after test driving one, gets out of the car smiling.”Try it, you’ll like it."
"Tesla is set to join the S&P 500 prior to trading on Monday, Dec. 21, a move that pushed shares higher earlier this month since money managers with funds that track the S&P 500 will need to buy the stock for their portfolios. Want more picks before they run? Check out (http://trade-view.com)."
"Anyone that can do a basic DCF can show that the fair price for TSLA is no less than $900. And in the current growth rate of 60%, even $1500 is not crazy at all."
I dont know why shorts get so happy... this always happens to them

"What is happening here is easily understandable, so let me explain it to you quickly: GME and AMC have been creating massive losses for funds, forced to cover their short (lol). To balance their losses, they have had to close their long time positions like those ones on Tesla, bringing down the price. But this is only a drop in the ocean. Tesla is strong and will only need a few hours, if not days to climb back up, and remain even tougher than before. ""Deceiving"" earnings won't bring it down, Tesla is still a leader, has massive market shares in batteries, and, because no one is talking about it, just introduced the new model S and X. Those new cars are not only better looking (inside and outside), they also have longer range (from 628km to 840km autonomy for the higher version), a top speed of 320km/h for the Model S Plaid +, and 0-100 in just 2.1 seconds. Their cars will destroy the competitors, and its only about time that Tesla reaches a price of 1k per share. So hold long my friends, trading is about future, and Tesla is the future!"
"Tesla was trading in the 640s just minutes before the close on Friday. The broader market is also down big right now, TSLA is doing just fine today."
What is wrong with you people? Are you numb to valuation? This is so far blown out and not justified at this level or even half this price. Don’t complain when the scheme colllapses.
Do y’all know why these companies like NIO and $TSLA are offering more shares? Real simple! They know that these prices won’t last forever. It’s a smart move on their part but also it’s an indication of what is to come in the future. It’s really simple. They know their stocks are in bubbles created by the low interest rate environment we are in. They know that once the Fed signals they are raising rates that the bubble will burst  So they are cashing in now 
Tesla just keeps trucking along making money and growing. Congrats to all the strong Tesla share holders. 
Lookout guys- the Nike forum is about to become more entertaining than Tesla.
Volume for TSLA stock is about 20M so far today. There has been 80k in volume on the $700 Calls expiring today. That is 8M in equivalent since there is 100 shares per contract. One Strike at today's expiration alone. This move is all about the options today.
"** According to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, $80 billion worth of Tesla stock will have to be bought by index investors.**Tesla will replace Apartment Investment and Management Co. in the S&P 500 when the electric vehicle company joins the index before trading begins on Dec. 21, S&P Dow Jones Indices said Friday.Tesla will also be added to the S&P 100, replacing Occidental Petroleum in that index."
"Tesla Giga Shanghai Is Ramping Up Model Y Production to Meet Extraordinary China DemandTesla Model Y has shone like a bright star since its inception at the company's Fremont factory. The demand for the model clearly exceeds the current production capacity, but Giga Shanghai is actively entering the production process. The parking lot at Tesla's Chinese factory is almost completely filled with China-made Model Ys, which will be delivered shortly.Tesla Model Y is in very high demand in China, and attracts thousands of customers every day. Orders for the highly anticipated SUV have reportedly surpassed 100,000. At the same time, stores that already have Model Y on display are overwhelmed with potential customers, while other automakers' stores resemble a desert.Meanwhile, Giga Shanghai is ramping up production of Model Y. In images taken by Jason Yang, hundreds of Model Ys can be seen, which are located in the central parking lot and occupy a disproportionate part of it. A flyby of the plant also reveals that SUVs are located in other parts of it.The SUV segment is extremely popular, so the demand for Model Y will continue to grow over time. With experience organizing and ramping up production with Model 3, a quick start to the production of Model Y for Tesla's China team should go smoothly.Good luck and GOD bless,"
Sad when TSLA needed a healthy correction and was heading into that territory ANOTHER random analyst upgrades the stock to a buy of 1k or 1200. Its creating a bubble and as a shareholder im worried.
ARK buying in as we speak!!

Smart to sell the hype and buy again when the stock value makes more sense. The cannabis companies rose from 5$ to 300$ and fell to 5$ again. Watch out about hype companies.
"Elon also publicly tweeted not to worry about PDI inspection and was ordering his folks to just push it out aggressively. It could have been worse. On top of it, there is a aggressive price reduction in China in 2021. Let us see what Analysts are going to say now. They will spin positively to download their stocks."

Great day! Shorts very quiet now!
This stock looks tired
"California is loaded with Teslas on its roads. Of course, it’s only domestic plant (for now) is in Fremont. But the waiting time for delivery is significantly shortened (our special order Model 3 was was ready for delivery in less than a week). As production rises they are shipping more all over the country (and world) every week. Service centers, mobile service, Supercharger and Tesla destination charging stations are expanding rapidly. Online direct factory used and new Tesla BEV sales (and online software EV updates) eliminates the need for marketing or sales staff or dealers. Drive a Tesla before judging their worth."
To Mars!...With a quick detour to the asteroid belt.
The stock continues to amaze me. Go Tesla! Split coming?
I can admit that investing in TSLA these years has been a hell of a ride that it is paying off every single doubt I could ever had.
If you read the actual report the flaw is not teslas fault rather a flaw in nvidias tegra processor I mean really 8GB of emmc memory come on
"Norway became the first country in the world where the sale of electric cars has overtaken those powered by petrol, diesel and hybrid engines last year, with the German carmaker Volkswagen replacing Tesla as the top battery-vehicle producer, data shows."
"After S&P inclusion, $TSLA will maintain a high support price of - 0.5% to +5% movement on any given day. Those not in a position next week will have a difficult bar to entry. This is the stock of the century so don't let it pass you by."
"tesla may crack the 500,000 but they still won't be profitable. tesla has to reduce prices in order to beat at least one forecast, namely the sales figures. I rather doubt it. has apple ever cut their prices to be successful?I'm not short but I'm skeptical about that"

another price target hike.... another $13 billion added to the market cap on 880k volume....... behind the scenes... this must be one of the biggest jokes on wallstreet.
this is no joke bubble finally popping like it did in bitcoin in december!!!
"There are ~$100B in tesla shares that need to be bought for funds tracking S&P500. This means about 156M shares. And this is on top of the regular volume. Assuming there are about 30 days left for funds to rebalance their prortfolios, thats about 5M shares/day on top the usual volume of ~50M if spread evenly. That means we should see daily volume up about 10%. So far for the past few days vol has been lower than avg, which means the big bump hasn't even started yet. Big funds are ptobably waiting for weak hands fatigue hoping for a drop before they start buying. Eventually they will have no choice, and the great squeeze will begin. Buckle up..."
At what point does this bubble ever correct? 2000 PE? 4000+? This stock has single handedly defied everything I was ever taught about investing.
"TSLA sold 130,000 more cars this year than last year. so, does the stock deserve this price based on that? Interesting when one strip this all down what it really means."

"I don't feel Tesla will own the EV market and will come back to earth. However, I do feel EV's are coming in droves and countries need to upgrade their electrical systems.

This should just keeping going up as long as EV's are selling. This is something that is way undervalued and can go to the moon!

"With a PE ratio of over 1,500 what is going to happen when the people buying this stock suddenly realize it is only worth pennies on the dollar. Don’t get me wrong, I like this company and what they stand for and may even buy one of their cars in the coming years but Elon has convinced thousands of people to pay a fortune for this stock for a company that is not making money and it will be 10 years before the stock could be worth what is currently selling for. By the way if you own this stock I have a wonderful bridge in New York you may be interested in buying."
Bubble will burst on Monday.
is Elon Musk really just Matthew Stafford in a suit? Hmmmmmm. Think about it.
Easiest short in history at these levels.
"FSD subscriptions is an alternative to the up front payment TSLA now charges for the few people who want to pay extra. Probably an easy sell on a $100k car. Why not get all the bells and whistles when you are paying that kind of money.But, it will be a tiny market. No one buying a $25k car is going to what to pay an extra 1/3 for FSD and the monthly subscription will be even more expensive (according to Musk). (Think in terms of monthly cost of the car, which is how most look at it. An extra $100/month is not something most people will be willing to pay.The conventional manufacturer tries to sell the idea that it's fun to try their car. What's the point of having car that's fun to drive if you are going to be paying extra to have someone else drive it (as in FSD)."

Tesla Europe Market share is meager 6% right now. Some might say supply is issue but in reality it's demand issue because Tesla will happy to balance between North America and Europe.Also what that mean is 94% coming from traditional OEM. Who says they can't build EVs. They are building in larger number already.
"Here’s some really good advice, if you like Tesla’s stock price and want it to sustainably go higher, purchase or lease a Tesla next year, let’s get those sales up, and your stock will go up... people normally say “xyz stock to the moon”, let’s take Tesla to Mars.... "

Is this still in correction or will we touch $900 soon ?
when I look for stocks to invest in I always try to find companies with PEs higher than 1000 but thats tough. With this one at 1500+ it's a rare gem with almost no risk.

"To those down on Tesla's bitcoin investment:1) $1.5 billion is a relatively small percentage of the $20 billion in the Tesla coffers.2) Bitcoin sees grand fluctuations, but ultimately it ends up at new highs.3) Will this seem like such a bad idea when bitcoin is at $60,000, $80,000, $100,000, and that $1.5 billion is over $3 billion? It won't happen overnight, but it seems likely to happen.4) Even Visa is coming around to bitcoin. It's just a matter of time before it's mainstream.5) I don't know, but I suspect that Elon Musk's visit to see Ellison was in part to talk this over since Ellison is the second biggest holder of Tesla stock. If so, seems like he agreed.Overall, I think this will turn out to be a sound move."
Long and strong! Tesla will be back by June with a $1000 price :)
"Ive posted this before and I’ll post it again I am currently holding 5133 shares of TESLA and yes that’s $ 3.6mill dollars ALL OF IT IS PROFIT ANY ONE who can not see a run to $700 thru year end earnings report is a fool. And look at us now at $708 I posted this weeks ago and yesterday we’re just below $700 after we get fantastic year end numbers we will probably see $725 as a new support level. Then we will start a slow and steady run throughout the 2021 year. Shanghai now making the Model Y giving us a great 1st quarter for 2021. Making it 7 profitable quarters in a row while building 2 gigantic factories. 2nd or 3rd quarter will bring Berlin on line making VW sweat like a pig. Austin will follow with Cyber and Semi Truck If you can’t see $1000 per share come September then your simply Blinded by guys like Chanos, Johnson, Etc. Tesla has made me into a millionaire this is beyond my wildest dreams I’m not expecting a straight line to $1000 but there is very little room for any substantial down turns not with this calendar of events. If you need to scratch your itch for more excitement sell half and buy NIO. Just look at today’s rise of $28.75 on Tesla just over 4% rise in one day but look at NIO also up even better that Tesla on a % basis take your pick but EV market is still gonna be hot for quite some time. And today NIO is slightly better than Tesla I’m long and strong on both"

Consider that this large luxury sedan that just happens to be electric typically sells for north of the $100,000 mark. And consider, as they do, that about 60 percent or so have gone to American buyers and that means roughly 60,000 US buyers have picked up a Model S - that beats the sales of other large gas-powered luxury sedans. Tesla does not officially release monthly sales figures. Despite the excellent year-to-date numbers, the Model S still hasn't caught up to the other big names among electrics, the Chevrolet Volt and Nissan Leaf. And it's estimated that if you factor in the first-generation Volt and its Opel, Vauxhall, and Holden derivatives, General Motors has sold just over 100,000 of its range-extender EV since it first went on sale in December 2010. Sales have been off significantly this year, mostly due to production stopping in spring to retool for the 2016 Volt that recently went on sale in some states. But since the Nissan Leaf went on sale around the same time as the Volt, it's maker has managed to move almost twice as many, or about 200,000 cars globally. This, even as the Leaf's US sales were off more than 40 percent through November. Blame that on the Leaf's age, the 2016 model's noticeably longer range and that used Leafs are dirt cheap these days. The bottom line is that while the Tesla Model S has been a hit as far as electric vehicles are concerned, it hasn't caught up to the popularity of the Nissan Leaf yet. And with a second-generation Leaf due in the near future and the Tesla Model X possibly affecting Model S popularity, it's too soon to see where that car's momentum will stop. Zac Estrada Autoblog"
At what rate new share for five billion worth will be issued ?
A week from today we will be at $1000! See you all on the green side!
Time for company to sell 50 million shares and put the money in bank
"Musk, supposed genius and richest man in the world, is tweeting today about dogpoop coin. He sounds deranged. Are his shareholders not concerned that he's not working on improving on Tesla's abysmal profitability?"
Any new vin # sightings or reports?BWAHAHAHAHAHA!!

investing is so easy with Tesla.
Not selling until we hit that $4000 PPS!!!!!
"Tesla has nowhere near the logistical and service infrastructure capable of handling 500,000 cars on the road/deliveries a year. House of cards. Tick. Tock."
TSLA shorts have had to go from living in a van down by the river this year to living in the sewer. Your bottom in being a short is when you stop digging. It’s only going to get worse over time.

Let's see how the market reacts at open to the $78K car for the masses.

"Just looking back through comments and history. Isnt 500,000 units already suppose to be bet a long time ago? It looks like other EV makers are showing a bigger % in growth as well. I'm now thinking it might be better to hold off on buying an EV untill the price wars brings it down to a reasonable price."
"Tesla is still $3,400 a share pre-split. It will inevitably fall to the single digits. Tesla has never produced a single car profitably in its 17 year history."
I have realized after hours trading is irrelevant to its regular trading hours...
Declining market share due to huge competition and the hydrogen bogey man on his way - this stock price will crash quicker than one of Elon's rockets.
There is a weekness in the deathstar but the emperor chooses to keep on pushing
Another opportunity to UNLOAD
any time someone asks me what exponential growth looks like I just show them the tesla stock trend
"Only Elon can burst this bubble. If he burst it by himself, then this stock could recover. if it is burst by analysts, then it will not recover at all and the competition would make this irrelevant. This bubble has now become a huge balloon."
Just curious if anybody here is also invested in CCIV? To ride Lucid when it competes with Tesla?
"Everybody knows about this fraud. All hope, that it will proceed , but this will not happen.The bubble will burst within one day over night und investors will have no chance to sell their shares,PE 1500..... this is a Ponzi System, a Joker Game, the lat investors will loose a big part of their investments. Or can anybody remember something comparable has happened? New market 20 years ago was not so much overvaluation than by Tesla.Ridicolous 500.000 cars and 800 billion marcet cap. Disruption ahead ....apple, quantumscape, all big car companies , google, etc... Who seriously believes that this is an adequate valuation? This would be 60 usd.....yes you are reading correctly, it is if you compare with other carmakers,,which are Producing much more cars in a much better quality.Tesla is a House of Cards, which will break down over Night.Maybe musk is selling shares to bring its sheep’s on the save side. He often stated, that this valuation is too much and it is an overvaluation.Mark my posting."
"The general consensus is that TSLA is Overvalued based on low profitability and very real competition risks moving forward from GM,F,VW,Toyota, Honda etc... etc... (analysts are no longer talking about ICE companies missing out on the EV market with offerings and direct EV investments from GM of 27B, FORD 24B VW 34B etc... And if you want an even riskier play try NIO, it has to preform perfectly for the next few years to justify the share price ""trajectory"". Look out for Wallstreet tide change of the EV/ice Versus Pure EV companies as investors start to classify GM and F as EV companies with ICE profits which is being seen as positive when you look at Pure EVs companies - with low sales, loosing money as well as having to preform perfectly just to maintain the ""highly speculative"" share price. re: EV/ice."

Is there anyone here planning to buy a Tesla car or Solar roof with money they made from owning Tesla stock? Just curious.

"so it was reported that Tesla vehicles has a margin of ~30%. Average gas car maker is around 7-10%. WHich means, tesla by delivering 500k vehicles is actually selling 1.5 million. All this is getting reinvested into building an even more formidable charging network which will be key in the future. When all gas cars are banned, would you go with the brand that has a reliable charging net work or other brands that only work on stations that may or may not work at times? Think on that"

Stock split expected?
"Read a post elsewhere that reminds me of something all active traders should remember, and that all those who think short-selling is evil should understand: Tesla encourages short trade in the stock.(1) By far their most successful financing rounds have been in Convertible Bonds. Convertibles are commonly held as part of an arbitrage strategy for those holding short positions in the stock. Tesla clearly states this in their 424's for the Convertible issuances. High short float = more interest in Bonds = more successful financing rounds for the issuer (i.e., Tesla).(2) Underwriters of the Convertible issuance received significant Greenshoes ($120M in aggregate principal amount of the 2019 notes and an option to buy up to an additional $180M in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 notes, which were fully exercised). They are allowed to do whatever they want with these shares, including lending out for short sales as outlined in the Prospectus. This is a very lucrative aspect of the underwriter's business.If shorting is evil, then Tesla and their underwriters want you to commit evil."
"Well I just sold my shares at $677 after buying at $819 so a chunky loss of £3000 (yes I'm in UK). I'm a big Elon & Tesla fan but feel he's got a bit distracted. You can't spread yourself too thin bro, this is going down to $450"
fElon can always claim billions of dollars have evaporated in the blockchain and nobody will be held accountable because nobody owns blockchain.
"If you take elon's email literally, it could mean that, with a huge push this week they will get the number over 2000. Last week could have been 1000. Next week could be 900. It does not say that we will produce over 2000 every week'Tesla (TSLA -5%) CEO Elon Musk sent an e-mail to employees at about 3:00 AM Pacific time to tell them that the company will pass the 2K Model 3s per week production pace if things go as planned today, according to Jalopnik.'"
Seems like Yahoo cenzoring all my bullish comments ... seems like somone really want to manipulate this down
Tesla will be more than just EVs. I’m invested in Elon
Tesla is in the business of selling tax credits. EV manufacturing is just a side-business.
Rumor has it that it was aliens who destroyed the SpaceX rocket. Does anyone know if it was Martians or Mexicans?
"Believe I've figured out Tesla investors: Closed factories, rally. Busted supply chain, rally. Shoot a rocket, rally. Split stock, Rally. Huge earnings beat, massive sell-off. I think this investor base doesn't want to know anything about the company performance. I think its so kind of future fantasy investment where they think they own a piece of some mars colony so when they hear about actual revenue, sales, businessy stuff it's no longer as valuable so it sells off."
"""The market looks forward, not backward. The market sees $TSLA with 25% of EVs growing from 3% of SAAR now to 24% of SAAR by 2025. The market values TSLA delivering 4.8M cars in 2025, not 500K cars in 2020."""
There's a difference between a good company and a good stock. Awful stock at this price. Stop saying Tesla is a great company. Two different things!
"On the way to $1000. Big boys are rushing in. They finally realized EV is for real.Longs, keep thinking long, stay calm and enjoy the ride up. Cheers."

"I see possible competition with Toyota in the future. But that's in 2024. Toyota is going very slow, they are trying out hybrid EV's and experimenting with their own solid-state battery. In four years, TSLA should be producing close to 3M cars annually and be much further along on their FSD and robotaxi plans."

Should rebound sharply tomorrow.
260 by August.
"Cannot wait to see how the Tesloons spin what Elon has stated, which is exactly what shorts have been stating for years.1. Tesla is an auto manufacturer. 2. Auto manufacturing is a highly competitive, low margin industry that requires discipline, planning and cost controls.3. There is no first mover advantage. You are competing against the legacy companies.4. Margins are not fat.5. There is no endless demand for electric cars at any price - only need to make them."
"Elon, surf is absolutely flat in Cali this week and maybe next week. The worst flat spell this summer since you sold the boards. But at least surf is just flat. How's your stock????"
"Musk's comment that it was time to ""place your bets"" as a reaction to the Goldman analyst's sell recommendation seems at best unprofessional; at worst it could be a SEC violation as CEO's are supposed to keep their mouth's shut during quite periods(I'm assuming it is a quiet period-maybe I'm wrong).In any event it reeks of manipulation as most people would interpret his comment to mean good news will be coming soon. Of course, he can say that's not what he meant, but whatever the case it reeks."
TSLA will end up flat. Another flat OPEX. MM are stingy to pay option buyers.
"Hi I'm Tesla, would you be kind and buy some of my shares?"
Tesla is looking real good today I hope you got a bunch￼ I did
Question is can you day trade / swing trade Tesla and beat the market and not lose the amount of shares vs all in and let it ride.

"first limit short sell order at 685, second larger one at 700, hoping both get filled but i'm fine with only the first one"
"Tesla is more overvalued than even tech stocks in their prime. Including amazon, apple, google, Netflix, fb. Do the comparisons urself. This is gonna tank after earnings."
"Tesla is a lot more than just a car company. They own the majority of the satellites  in the sky & they’re planning on hosting a worldwide mesh internet network from space. They also sell solar panels & solar roof shingles that store power in power walls in your garage. I was a victim of the Texas power outages last week & I’m seriously thinking of buying a new roof with Tesla solar shingles & 4 Tesla power walls for my garage, so I can get off the grid & become energy independent. The power companies are going to be raising the rates for all Texas electricity customers because they just paid $9 per Kwh for 3 days when they normally pay $0.06 per Kwh. Those of us whom can afford to get off the grid & buy the Tesla roof & power stations will be making that investment instead of paying more for our electric company’s mismanagement of Texas power resources last week. This is why I invested in Tesla last week. I am similar to Warren Buffet in that I only invest in companies that make products or provide services that I’d actually buy. I wasn’t a huge fan of their cars, but I do plan to buy their solar shingles & power stations so I’ll never have to live through the blackouts I suffered through last week & because I don’t want to pay the higher rates for electricity over the next few years. This will also add value to my home & if I ever decide to buy that $25k Tesla they are planning to make, I can plug it into my Tesla power walls in my garage & not have to buy gasoline or pay an electric bill anymore."
Now musk wants to create a new growth diversion by consolidating all his companies under one name to justify a higher valuation. Guy is unbelievable

Why does it say that Tesla closed at $695 ?
"Musk has lost his MoJo. His announcements of products, services, factories, batteries, etc, all sometime in an ambitious distance future timeline (just beyond the attention span of the typical TSLA investor), has grown stale. The donkeys are no longer chasing the bigger carrot, on the longer stick. Tesla. Inc. will not reach ""One Trillion Dollars"" (don't forget the air-quotes). Building batteries in Bangelore, tunnels in Tampa, rockets on Roadsters, MuskCoin on Mars, have all fallen flat."
What if you started a company and created some process for cleaning all the air in the universe. You issued a billion shares and then had a trading program that just kept bidding the shares higher 8 out of every 10 days. And you told everyone there was really no limit on how much the company could make. How long do you think you could run the scam?

Why does Tesla need so many Giga factories if they can not keep Fremont factory busy two shifts per day?Tesla's January BEV market share slipped to 11%. Why would the 11% market share is worth more than remaining 89%?
"first of all, I am a fan of EVs... but lets think about this... on any given day there are 4.5 million cars/trucks that fill up with gas every single day.... if those gas cars/trucks are replaced with EVs... then where are all of these cars/trucks going to recharge... if you drive to and from work.. you would charge at home.. but if you need to go out of town then there really aren't that many places to charge... where I live in the building we have 4 charge stations for 400 cars... so very little are EVs and those charging stations take care of the Tesla cars in the building.... think of living in an appartment building with perhaps 1000 units.... where do you think those people will charge there cars over night.... logistic wise, we have a problem houston.... I love EVs... I just don't think we can flip all cars/trucks to EV ... maybe wishful but not going to happen thinking here...."
Really interested to see the US sales estimates for January. Especially since he mentioned in the conference call that there was US seasonal weakness and Fremont was only building for Europe and China.
"OK, going to pull the plug, and request my Model 3 deposit back. My base $35K version will not arrive until after the federal tax credit begins to expire, the build quality is embarrassing, human interface inexcusable, styling, interior and exterior, is ho-hum, at best. March 20th, 7:30 EST is my time stamp for request. I'll truthfully acknowledge an expedite refund, but will ridicule a delay response. Reservation# RN109057266. Wish me luck...."
Imagine the huge volume when everyone will be buying soon.
"Interesting. TSLA is up almost 6%, but my long put positions have gone up in value today."
Gonna have to issue more stock to run the company now that cash was used on btc
"New Model S/X is the ACTUAL news... they look better inside and out, they go faster and further, charge much faster, and plaid models are game changers. Gonna sell a lot of these cars. $1000 a share is on the horizon..."
"A stock with a joke valuation is especially funny if you guess right on when to short it. Back to mid 300s, where it was an eternity of 5 months ago."
Bngo will go to the moon #bngo #gme #amc #tsla #aapl
Literally hundreds of years of profits already baked into this price
The bears apparently didn’t learn from their mistakes in 2020. LoL
"I am wondering if we may see 3,000 again with a forward stock split coming by 2021 year end."
"When a goldman upgrade cannot and does not take the stock straight to that price within days, it may be time to lock in profits as the stock is really weak.That said though you buy tsla riot and mara on fridays and sell them on mondays.BuddahMicro pennies starting to come back like 1999 2000 when they went to 1 cent or five cent.Fare bkmp rton mine cctlGood luck"
"Every stock on earth has pull-back after run-ups. TSLA action has surprised me. It seems, every new high brings new short-sellers comparing with Ford, GM and 3 ton worth of data. These same guys are forced to cover by their brokerage couple days later. Short squeeze results in another spike. With more data and reasoning, short sellers initiate new short at $100 higher with conviction and HOPE for the awaited BIG DROP to $50. Rinse & Repeat. THIS SINGLE STOCK HAS CREATED VERY HAPPY PEOPLE & VERY ANGRY PEOPLE !!! (Elon is going - what did I do? ... just building cars, batteries, solar panels and space ships)"
STAY LONG GOING TO 800
Can anyone make a legitimate case for continuing to hold this stock? It has been flat or in decline for over a month while the rest of the market has been on fire. I do believe the TSLA has burst and people are starting to move on to other opportunities.
"GME with a market cap of over 22 Billion, is overvalued by about 22 BillionTSLA with a market cap of 777 Billion is overvalued by700+ Billion"
qs is a questionable buy as it is so light that roll overs will most likely happen and insurance will be higher.
"When interviewer Kara Swisher pointed out that many people would perish in that approach (herd immunity), Musk, attempting to keep his assembly plant open, responded: ""Everybody dies.""Your hero. Your God."
This forum short squeeze is gonna be epic 
Tesla the stock has clearly disconnected from tesla the company. I wonder if the options trading on the stock causes it to continue to rise?

"A lot of stocks are red this week, $aapl $sndl $nio $tsla. This is the first week theyve been red after weeks of being green. This is normal consolidation. If you hold through the red days you will be rewarded. Weak hands will sell for weak profits, hold strong."
"delivered 500,000 cars last year and valued at 800 billion LOL"
"I always kind of thought, if Musk is.so smart then why does the U.S government have to subsidize companies like Tesla to keep it afloat?"
Congratulations longs
Well done longs  Tesla is my favourite stock in my portfolio
Super bullish news - there is so much demand for Tesla Models 3 and Y it’s through the roof! Let’s go fam Happy holidays!

Elon Musk wishes he could report a quarter like AAPL just did. In his dreams.
"Tesla, Trading at $650, Gets $90 Price Target From JPMorganJPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman has told clients not to increase their holdings in Tesla to approximate its weight in the S&P 500 ahead of its inclusion to the benchmark on December 21."
"The prices we’ve seen range from a premium $196/day here in Orange County CA where Teslas are quite popular, to a silly $990/day in the SF Bay Area where Teslas are even more popular. There’s even one listed in Washington, DC, despite deliveries only having started in California thus far.We reported before that the average Tesla owner renting on Turo makes $923 per month, which is a nice chunk to help pay for the car."
"Cathie Wood bought another 23,966 shares of Tesla today."
"C'mon hooders....you don't want NIO getting bigger gains than Tesla do you?!?!? Buy more fractional shares, quick!"
Sold everything and all in on tsla
Where are the irresponsible fanboys asking you to buy the dip each time. 1000? we will see 500 first by next week. i have been warning seen it go downs to 821..
Doubled in 6 weeks!
where my longs at !? my tesla !!!happy weekend my tesla fam. shorts you can go to h e double 
"Have absolutely zero doubt that the vast majority of Tesla gamblers will lose every penny...and then some. Like every other bubble in history, retail always comes in at the top, or if they were fortunate enough to get in early, their greed will get the best of them they'll pyramid the margin so high on their increasing ""equity"" that even a mild correction will blow them out of the water.As Michael Burry said, ""Enjoy it while it lasts."" And welcome back to mommy's basement!"
50x your Tesla.... Ehang is the current tesla baby...one share of tesla for ten share of Ehang.. and Ehang appreciates 5 times faster then tesla... Which means you get 50 growth. How ...
Some people play Power Ball and Mega Millions lottery with almost 100% chance of losing. I choose to play $TSLA with 100% chance of winning.
Elon just grabbed my stimulus package......
"Bubbles like Tesla only come along once in a decade. This stock is worth $100, at best. Check out Ford's recent contribution to the Tesla bubble. Wait until the other guys get on board.

This has been trading sideways all week and I a certain that most have already taken earnings into account since they know what sales were. This might hold up through the earnings date and may even make it to $900 but after earnings this will see a huge correction if it does not go through it before.
"don't fall for market manipulation. this always happens, the big traders and funds try to scare retail investors. don't sell. they want your shares to sell to funds on Monday. you have been warned."
Think about it ... when have you ever seen people volunteer to help a company with their product? It’s just about unheard of .... it speaks volumes for Tesla long term .... the brand is Very very strong . They Just need to execute execute execute ...
"After this day I think the funds will take their profit from Tesla and they will sell their share.The competition is growing in the ev market, optimism is declining and fear is growing.It is my opinion and advice.What do you think?"
"I'd be careful on predicting the S&P 500 demand on Dec 21 since we don't know how that is going to play out (ie. some have ""already"" bought in the Nasdaq). I seriously doubt money-managers are going to be falling over one another trying to buy on the Dec 21, yes they are supposed to keep a ratio proportion of the S&P 500 stocks BUT keep in mind the level of ""contempt against Elon"" from Wall Street (ie, $80 valuations etc...). I think they are planning to drop it by $100 within days (if not hours) of the S&P inclusion. As well those ""requirements"" to adjust portfolios aren't not LAW and all Money managers have flexibility to buy over time, not just on Dec 21 st as implied. Also on the cusp of the S&P 500 inclusion J.P. Morgan said they are advising money manager clients to ""Not buy Tesla Stock at these valuations"" So. If you need to sell consider anything over $650 (I'm a Tesla Bull but that is a high price to pay assuming the future will play out perfectly)"
Huge correction to the upside in the new year. This stock is so undervalued.
Most likely Republican will Georgia Senate Election. Will that be good for
In due time to come Elon Musk stock will be just as expensive as Berkshire Hathaway
Does anyone else ever read (http://Pick-stocks.com)? They just mentioned TSLA this morning.
"Getting more and more evident that big money funds are lightening the load a little. Most are in profit zone, so respostioning 3Q for profit recognition and future loss prevention."
Is Musk still the richest person? If not why isn't the media reporting it like it did when he became?
Last chance to buy before it goes to 750
Adam Jonas who couldn't predict TSLA 1 year out ($10 price target pre-split) is making predictions about 2030. And the market cares. Wow.
"Toyota has joined the race, market cap only 1/4 of Tesla, $20+ billion annual profits, sells about 10M vehicles a year."
So we hit 810 target yesterday and immediately Chamath made a push up. What a play
Just a normal day of shaking the trees. Shake the apple tree the weak apples will fall. The S&P entry is gigantic for Tesla this might just be $1000 December 18th.
Bought 80 shares of tesla today hopping the stock will hit 700+ by and off the year
MASSIVE POP BACK TO 310 !!!! CONGRATS LONGS !!!
"Ben, with all due respect I love Tesla but the US or any other country for that matter does not have an electric grid anywhere capable enough to charge millions upon millions of electric cars. When they do start to build out the grid which will take many many years with all the regs and tree huggers what do you think these power plants will burn for fuel ? Elon Musk has said himself fossil fuels ARE NOT going away for a very long time. The CEO of Toyota has made it very clear that all electric isn't feasible without a much more capable grid. There are many states in the US that can barely handle the much needed air conditioners that are needed for our hot summers and cause rolling black outs in some states. Also the way it takes years to get anything built in the US can you imagine even trying to build new electric power plants ? We built a simple bridge in my town that was 5 years and 500 million over budget."
buy weed stocks and short tsla straight to 700
I wonder for how long will these people be crying about pe/overpriced/blabla or join the leaving train and make some cash ?
Tesla shares are trading higher following report suggesting the company has partnered with Samsung on a new 5nm chip for full self-driving.

UN SAFE AT ANY SPEED. coming to your local bookstore and also available on Amazon. Bawhahahaha
TSLA up 1000% on news that it hit a production target 2 years late.If this the metric....INTC will be A $500 stock if it can get 10nm out!
Tesla is losing value faster than my wife.
"Longs, we're extremely green today so slight drops doesn't matter.THIS IS THE WAY.Stay long."
General market looking bright today
Is Tesla's creation of proprietary charging stations going to turn out to be wise? As all the other EV brands rely on an ever-increasing set of charging stations that are non-proprietary more Tesla owners will use those stations. Leaving Tesla with a large sunk cost and a fixed operating cost for stations that are increasingly underused
What’s the next resistance level- anyone know?
"Where is the Energy?Tesla made a big deal of moving battery pack production to the Gigafactory, but there is almost no discussion of utility scale storage systems in the quarterly letter. In the financials, they don't even have a separate line item. It is just 'Services and Other' and it's a miniscule $88M (down from $121M the prior quarter)I get that the business will take time to ramp up, but I'd still like to see it broken out. How many KWH and $M worth of storage did they deliver in Q2?The silence on stationary storage was pretty deafening...."
"This is unacceptable, How can Tesla miss earnings by 22 cents per share?"
Tesla Short Sellers Lost $38 Billion in 2020 as Stock Surged hehehehe
The most advanced battery pack. Yep it’s the Model 3. https://evannex.com/blogs/news/tesla-s-battery-pack-is-both-mysterious-and-alluring-work-in-progress
"I owned TSLA but sold last week. I am amazed. I am dissapointed. Many of my stocks underperformed this week as much of the sells of my stocks went to buy this TSLA. I have read on other boards (for what its worth, that many ""investors"" are liquidating positions to buy TSLA. At the same time it has an EPS of 49 cents and a P/E of 1400. Everyone is buying this week because ""it is going in the S and P"" Buying because others are buying. I am not short would never short a good company, but what are the reasons a 1400 PE is justified here."
"so basically roadster has two times more battery and is two times more expensive than model S, meaning no battery cost improvement till 2020. I don't believe what media says about battery cost anyway. I only look at real numbers."
Tomorrow is going to be epic.
I think Tesla is gonna be the biggest company in the world. I also think that Tesla will be bigger than I am imagining. Anyone else feel the same way.?
"market imploding, its all based on margin debt"
Model 3 buyer in Germany had a delivery appointment for Monday and paid in full for the car. Then Tesla cancelled his delivery and said they believe his car might be on one of the next ships. Different continent....same customer service issues.
"MA,MA, 420 REALLY!"
Sell more cars Musk!! You can't dupe people anymore. F and GM likely will produce much more EVs than TSLA!
"I've heard some RUMORS that $XPOA will merge with the boring company of Elon Musk (Shervin is on the team, close friend from Elon, possibly hyperloop, Joby is another option) $TSLA $XPOA"
When are earnings announced?
It’s not just a car
The gains this shortened week will be STAGGERING. $TSLA will be the most lucrative stock from 2020 to 2024
"$TSLA credit rating raised to BB from BB-. Two steps from investment grade (BB+, BBB-). Outlook positive means further upgrades possible. Moodys should follow."
EM will prove funding secured. He did not say he was taking the company private with funding secured he said he was thinking about taking the company private with funding secured. The company will be private in the next year. The stock will shoot up beyond $420. It will run as private for 5 years and there will be another IPO at a $800 billion market cap. If EM can find a way for retail investors to stay in they should.
"All these fund manager that have to buy 80bn worth of Tesla stock will do anything they can to try and get Tesla shares as cheap as they can. They will their cronies to try and put fear and panic so that the share price is cheap enough for them to buy into. Let them fight between each other when to buy and they will, as self interest will prevail, and prices will naturally go up and we can reap the benefits out of it. This is the only time people when we have the edge and know what is happening. Don't sell your shares just yet unless you really have too. Let's fleece them whilst we can :-)"
"Symmetrical triangle pattern with lower highs and higher lows, significant reduction in average volume as an indicator of imminent breakout. Lets watch and see"
up 22% on my short position already
"Look at the ticket tape, I can see that there are some SHORTS covering early in the morning, after that day traders take care of it. There are still a lot more shorts that need to be close. So, I can wait, I guess that TSLA will hit new high again this week, so I have no problem to wait."
"Waiting for Musk to claim delays and cost overruns at SpaceX, are due to NASA squabbling over small details, like safely.Musk would never let that slow down production at Tesla."
Tomorrow 730
Why working when you can buy TSLA stocks and let speculators do all the job ?
Dont bet against tesla
"Drove my model x on a long trip today, 150 miles total. Screens completey blacked out. 3 times. Car still drove as it was resetting (2min) going 65mph. Scary stuff. No mph, no radio, no nav, no AC. Nothing but black."

"Ive been thinking of a way how I could afford to own a Tesla EV. With the current price and bullish rate of the stock, how many shares should I invest in to grow my money within 1-3 years to buy any of their vehicle? Would like to hear your advice pls"
Will drop another 50 tomorrow. Minimal profits and more competition coming in.
"The Tesla Truck has not even been designed yet. Tesla has absolutely no idea what the final price will be. They are printing what investors want to hear. Although we do know it will be more than $150K (300 mpc) and $180K (500 mpc). A loaded Model X is $154K, more than a Semi? The semis will have 10 tires, 10 wheels, 4 drive motors , 6 rotors, six calipers, larger body panels, massive windshield, wiper assembly, mirrors, more cameras, heavy duty shocks, roof fairing, complex coupler, heavy duty steel frame, giant cab, at least 4X battery capacity, all hardward for autonomous driving, and will sell for less than a soccer mom's grocery getter. You believe this pricing? Then you deserve to lose your investment."
"Okay, was I the only one that saw this (after hours) around 530pm EST DOWN BY $110!!?? I was so prepared to try this; only 50 shares but hey........."

I do not understand the bashers or pumpers. Instead of bashing short and instead of pumping buy. No need to tell people on the board what they have to do or insult them. People have different investment strategy. I respect those who do their DD and do their own choices and share information or news. Bashers and pumpers lack of self esteem and consider others unable to make their own choices.
Bounced off 100 dma today. I think it will continue to rally tomorrow due to the Short Sale Circuit Breaker. Thursday and Friday will probably depend on what the broader market does

Yahoo Finance with a clear interest to drag Tesla down. What a timely selection of news. How’s it going for you Yahoo Finance?
This stock is a strong sell too strong. All major car companies are now offering or will soon offer electric cars. There's nothing special about Tesla and the losses will only intensify. Sell now before this company files for bankruptcy.

"Very nice dead cat bounce! I'm happy. Stock is back to my $700 to $750 target range. But, I hadn't thought very carefully in setting it. Doesn't seem likely to stay in this range?Next major catalyst will be the 1st quarter earnings report which may show that how weak TSLA's position is in the face even of the limited competition now present."
Musk has made a big mistake attacking the USD by way of Bitcoin. The U.S. government is not going to sit back and let this dude set fire to U.S. currency. Eliminating TSLA energy credits would be a good first step.
"Let’s see what Li has in-store for tomorrow. If it drops, I will be adding to my position. This is simply fear selling which always happens prior to lock up expiration. No institutional investors will be unloading their shares. It’s too cheap. $LI $NIO $XPEV $TSLA"

"If you look at Tesla as a startup, it just started making a profit, so from that perspective, the upside is huge.If you look at it as a car company, it's basically the Apple of cars, so yeah--lots of growth.If you look at it as a growth company, PEG for 5-year expected growth is hovering just over 1, which means that the the company is not overly priced.And, finally if you look at Tesla as a niche company, then it has definitely found a nice little niche that leverages the vision of a great leader."

Elon plz offer more stock to buy BTC
"Last week, Cathie Wood of Art Innovation trimmed their positions in Tesla by selling 10,500 shares to make $56.00/share for a total of $588,000, but Wood then reversed the course by buying back 109,000 of Tesla's shares on Friday (Jan 29). Part of her Short Sale last week interrupted Tesla's share of hitting $1,000. Tesla Inc. posted it's first full-year profit of $721 million. Sales of $31.5 billion, it topped Wall Streets Sales expectation of about $31.1 billion. Tesla's cash holdings totaled $19.4 billion in 2020, up from $6.3 billion in 2019."
"It is historically significant that shares rarely fall in a straight line. However, I think tesla will be an exception to this. It is heading for 200 dollars in a straight line.I read so many immature comments on here that I fell the need to share some valuable insights with the inexperienced investors from someone who has over 20 years experience.Tesla is the worlds greatest ever bubble and it will crash.No this is not a time to load up.Get off this train if you can exit without incurring huge losses.Do it now before you are nursing huge losses when it goes below 200 dollars in as little as 8 weeks time."
$BRLL anytime you have .02 stock and they announce news that they are getting in the #Lithium game and just 18 miles from name dropped $TSLA gigafactory... its a HOMERUN.

"On Sunday, news broke of Tesla’s plans to set up an EV manufacturing unit in India. India like most countries now is keen on reducing its carbon footprint concerning its transportation industry. So, Tesla could be looking at a significant boost to its addressable market in this expansion. At the same time, India did express plans to invest $4.6 billion into companies involved in advanced battery manufacturing in the country. For more hot stocks like (TSLA) just go to (http://trade-view.com)."
How is everyone doing?
Shorts are doomed.lol
"up $24 yesterday down $6 today, i like this math LOL"
very pricey! $200 coming in 2021!
We are now in the Blow off top with all this froth!!! Musk cannot now claim Tesla is a car company..can he??? I thought it was a software company?? still sells a fraction of half-range vehicles that don't work in cold temperature!!!
"The problem is not TSLASs down day, it is TMs up day, along with their and other major car companies looming EV competition. Many more down days ahead for TSLA, and it doesn't help that he is gambling on Bitcoin with shareholder money."
Simple Question whats timing for next crisis according to you guys?
"When will this crash, looks like shorts are going to hit the jackpot if they short now, some have lost it all on poor timing"
"I will give it to shorts, they are putting up a great fight in what will be the last battle in the war between shorts and longs. However, you already have lost. You can keep fighting, but it’s going to cost you dearly if you don’t surrender immediately"
Hey Musk....I just called Ford and GM.They told me your lunch tastes good.
Súper Green on Monday
Will the sell off began Monday morning or Tuesday morning?
Goodbye shorts.. 30 billion of the market cap is gone

"Yes Tesla is overvalued, it’s been so for long, however that’s not the only fundamental that defines this stock. I mean if it were mere algorithms, all analyst should make same call. I believe TEsLA being industry disrupter, a whole new innovation subject. And yes not to be overexcited though, competition if getting tough with likes of auto major in the pool. However with Tesla yet to be on its full projected performance (given upcoming new build factories ) , EV battery and tech, FSD s, etc. So yes it’s a give or take, I would take and not just sit by mere algorithms, yet not ignoring them!GLTA with there thoughts"
"FSD Update: New beta version will recognized kangaroos, if they are wearing orange reflective vests. Wallabies are being warned to still use caution, unless they are dinning at a Burger King.

Dead cat bounce
"If all goes to script, I expect the following: 1) a run of ""analysts"" commenting on how the ""doubling"" of weekly M3 production is a harbinger of having solved the production bottleneck problems and that exponential production growth lies ahead. 2) Throw in a reference to record revenues, and a cash number that is not as ""bad as expected"" 3) The 400-100 per share pundits citing the success of the M3, the genius of Musk etc. 4) TSLA obtaings even more unfavorable financing and 5) Even more shorting."
SpaceX earns $150.4 million from the U.S. Department of Defense to deploy satelliteshttps://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/s0acex-wins-150million
Putting $1.5b into BTC is an awful idea for several reasons. 1) It damages Tesla's credibility as an environmentally focused company (BTC uses extraordinary amount of energy) 2) It raises serious questions about why Tesla isn't deploying its capital to grow a supposedly supply constrained business 3) It's a distraction to senior management who know has to watch the crypto markets and 4) It introduces another element of shadiness to Tesla's operations as BTC is highly speculative. Absolutely awful decision.

"Hover crafts, bitcoin, yet TSLA tanks 7% this week while the NASDAQ gained 1%. Going back the previous weeks, at least TSLA was merely trading sideways while the NASDAQ was mooning. It appears that the trend is going against TSLA and that the market is getting tired of the hype. Chart looks ominous. Bubble is popping. GLTA."
"Complete joke of a company . We are watching the next Research in Motion. One of the first to bring a product to market, and we watched it fall apart. Tesla is easy to duplicate, ridiculous valuation..... This Bitcoin plunge is another joke. Tesla is losing sales to other companies. Lousy quality. No service for 10 days. Has never made a profit on anything built. CEO who delivers promises that are always years late or never true. Watch out newbies. The EV euphoria is going to start asking , ""Show me the money "".

"Tesla's Dirty Little Secret. Tesla posted its first full year of net income in 2020 -- but not because of sales to its customers.Eleven states require automakers sell a certain percentage of zero-emissions vehicles by 2025. If they can't, the automakers have to buy regulatory credits from another automaker that meets those requirements -- such as Tesla, which exclusively sells electric cars.It's a lucrative business for Tesla -- bringing in $3.3 billion over the course of the last five years, nearly half of that in 2020 alone. The $1.6 billion in regulatory credits it received last year far outweighed Tesla's net income of $721 million -- meaning Tesla would have otherwise posted a net loss in 2020.""These guys are losing money selling cars."
"So who's paying for the replacement of 135,000 recalls?""Tesla says its faulty touchscreens that led to a recall were only built to last 5-6 yearsTesla agreed to recall more than 134,000 of its cars over faulty touchscreens this week.US regulators said the failing displays could affect essential components like the rear-view camera.Tesla agreed to the recall, and said its screens shouldn't be expected to last more than 5-6 years.Visit the Business section of Insider for more stories.Tesla agreed this week to recall more than 134,000 vehicles with flash memory units that may wear out unexpectedly, rendering the cars' touchscreens useless in some cases, but it didn't go down without a fight.In a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration made public on Tuesday, Elon Musk's electric automaker claimed its screens weren't failing prematurely - they were just designed that way.Tesla's legal chief, Al Prescott, pushed back against the regulator's definition of a ""defect,"" arguing that the eMMC memory devices in question were only built to last five to six years. He said that lifespan is standard for infotainment systems in the industry.""While the wear rate is heavily influenced by the active use of the center display system, even more so when the vehicle is in drive or charging, given a reasonable average daily use of 1.4 cycles, the expected life would be 5-6 years,"" Prescott said. ""The eMMC flash memory ... is inherently subject to wear, has a finite life (as NHTSA itself acknowledges), and may need replacement during the useful life of the vehicle."""

"Well, I was way wrong in my delivery estimates. Those who predicted 22k were spot on. Congratulations. I didn't sell though, despite my promise to Kevin that I would. I'd have sold if the miss was due to lack of demand, but I believe Tesla's explanation that it was due to autopilot hardware changes. (Reading between the lines, I think the truck decapitation accident caused the original autopilot vendor to get fired... It's a little harsh, but it speaks to a corporate culture with high expectations for individual accountability. In the long run, that's a good thing.) Still, I'm pleasantly surprised by the $10 jump. I was expecting a drop. Explanations for it?1: Despite the miss, Tesla's annual deliveries still rose 50% year over year. 2: The large number of cars in transit and the 3 month wait for new MS orders, bode well for Q1. (An astonishing 100% increase over Q1 of 2016 is within reach)3: The FF reveal event both validates the market and underscores how far TSLA has come since their first MS reveal.4: The gigafactory tour in Nevada yesterday (with the announcement that cells are being produced) pleased investors and/or frightened the shorts.Personally, I'm most interested in #4. The current battery cell design was locked in 5+ years ago. With M3 they are cutting in a whole new form factor and that gives them an opportunity to include a whole bunch of incremental improvements. I'm happy to see that they are ramping production now, and will use the cells first in stationary storage applications. There is always a risk in cutting in a new design. Those stationary storage packs can validate the new cells and provide the reliability and endurance data needed to optimize the battery warranty before M3 ships. Does anyone have any details of what was seen and said on the GF tour?"
"Fairly good interview relevant to both bulls and bears. This YouTube host is fairly neutral in regards to Tesla. Somewhat out of date considering that the $35K M3 has now been released, but Moore's opinions regarding possible manufacturing locations and margins are very interesting.

"Being able to produce abt 100,000 cars despite a challenging disruptive quarter to periods of factory shutdowns in Shanghai and Fremont speak very well for their manufacturing capability. They can produce faster and smoother than before. The new advanced manufacturing technology in Model Y must have play a big part in this which also helped Tesla bring forward Model Y deliveries. This manufacturing technology in Model Y is the hidden surprise element that would keep Tesla being able to exponentially increase their production number quarters after quarters."

going back to $400 . Most over priced stock in the market today
"Shorts, you've all been through the numbers a thousand times . . . can I ask the obvious question . . . how is Tesla still operating?

"Observations about @elonmusk's $420 LBO announcement:First, the context is odd: Musk promised on the conference call that $TSLA will be forever profitable. So why does he need to go private to ""end negative propaganda from shorts""? And why let them off the hook at $420?Musk suggests there will be no controlling shareholder in the LBO. He also says financing is already arranged. Ergo, he implies a syndicate of lenders has already signed documents for the deal. This is odd for two reasons...First, Musk recently rebuffed an investment offer from Saudi Arabia. If you're passing the hat for the largest LBO syndicate in history, why say no to a big check?Second, a $70B syndicate would involve numerous banks, dozens of lawyers, and multiple boards of directors. It's been [over] 12 hours since the announcement, and none of these parties has confirmed Musk's claims.Which raises a general point: a $70B dollar deal is a Jupiter-sized briar patch of legal and regulatory rules. It's a minutely choreographed thing, with legal risk for any party that says or does the wrong thing at the wrong time. With that in mind:Why did $TSLA not request a trading halt until an hour after Musk's tweet? Why did the company belatedly post an email from Musk, rather than an official statement? Why did Tesla not file an 8-K disclosing details of the purported LBO?Musk says he will not sell in the deal. What about his ~$800M in margin loans? Will lenders accept illiquid collateral? What about change of control provisions on $TSLA's debt? Who will fund the mandatory tender?"

"Normally when you ramp up production, margins increase. Tesla's margins actually decreased, probably because of all the vehicles that had to be repaired due to the poor build quality. Making more vehicles is not proving to be a profitable venture for Tesla. If not for $401MM in regulatory credit sales, they would have taken a loss on a GAAP basis."
Tesla will continue to innovate and will sell products and services in 5-10 years that not even Elon knows about right now. Cars will be an afterthought. You're getting this stock cheap if willing to hold.
Now Musk's full time job is market manipulation to benefit Tesla and himself personally.Great Job well done :)

"Follow the money. Did you see Bill Gates led fund is investing in natural gas clean conversion to hydrogen? Consider, each new EV produced whether by Tesla or every other vehicle manufacturer rushing to the party, will take out oil demand for fueling that car. As electricity is needed to fuel that car now, oil is essentially being replaced by natural gas as over 1/3 of all electricity generated in the US is via natural gas. Lower demand for oil would reduce associated gas. Lower supply and greater demand results in higher prices. Ever consider the increase in cash flow for natural gas producers once fixed costs are met? Ever studied how volatile natural gas prices are since it is a relatively inelastic commodity? We keep building homes heated with natural gas, power plants fueled by natural gas and LNG export facilities for natural gas exportation. Plus natural gas is a necessary feedstock in producing petrochemicals (plastics and such), fertilizer and is the most likely viable source for producing hydrogen. Think prices of natural gas can't explode higher? Disclosure: I am unqualified, I am prone to errors and financial beatings, I am long AR, SWN and HGTXU (very long). This is not investment advice. Do your own research and consult your advisors."

"So what do you think would happen if Tesla drops price of model 3 to $25K right now with incentives that buyers need to subscribe to FSD on monthly/ yearly subscription just like Office 365 subscription model? TSLA is not really a car company. I think it’s more of a subscription, cloud, AI driven, one-shop, service oriented company that just happens to sell nice cars also. How else do you think Tesla wants to sell batteries to other car companies also? Hell maybe some day other car EV car models can also charge at Tesla charge stations. In effect, other car vendors are Tesla customers or potential customers because they also buy Tesla EV credits. Tesla is expanding payment options and also investing in its cash by buying bitcoins AFTER it has critical mass adoptions by banks (the banks are building critical block chain technologies to support bitcoins future payment). Yes it is calculated risk taking to drive even more adoptions for the industry. Given all the money floating around with the fed printing machine, inflation is jerking around the corner and cash will loose value while bitcoins are like Gold....in time of inflation people buy Gold....it all makes sense now."
BANKRUPTCY COMING
"wow this is unfairly being shorted. do people even understand BTC and the utility as well as why TSLA would make an investment. i have worked within the blockchain sector and have a friend who is a top executive at TSLA. take it how you might but TSLA is focused on trying to grow their sales in China as well as obviously the United States and Europe. since China regulates the ability to cash out your BTC into fiat, and since China has some of the largest holders of BTC as well as massive mining operations, the idea of being able to accept BTC for the purchase of a vehicle is a great avenue for increasing those sales in China as well as the rest of the Asia. Since the Chinese government has mandated EV cars for their population, this is a really strong move for the company. Furthermore, many might not be bullish on BTC, but there are also many who think this will go over $100K. if that happens, this will create a massive ROI on the BTC position for TSLA. i completely understand people thinking that amount of cash is better deployed in the overall business, but I don't think Musk is actually gambling on this, if he were he'd have bought into Dogecoin, not just tweeted about it. lastly, many of the same BTC holders are of the same demographic as TSLA purchasers. dump the stock if you want but understand the strategy and economics of the BTC purchase before just blurting out whatever you might think of Musk and/or TSLA. my only thought is will TSLA skyrocket if BTC does too? or will this still just be shorted regardless? if it's the former, then don't even sweat the position where TSLA is trading today. if it's the latter, yes, this could be trading closer to $750 very soon. i guess only time will tell."

"Today Musk's bitcoin story covered a very bad issue for Tesla. Chinese government summons Tesla for it's bad quality and service in China. This is very serious, due to China, Tesla stock jumped 10 times so Musk can issue stocks to buy bitcoin. It can do the reverse to the stock as well. :)"

Tesla has only just begun. it has years of growth ahead unlike most stocks which are maxed out.
What happened shorts? LOL
STPK my friends. Talking heads say it's the next TSLA. AI driven energy storage with 1.2T TAM. Elon even agrees Stem is the next big thing. Do not miss out on this stock. Low float going to 500 in two years. Rafi loves you. Peace!
$700 incoming!!

Tesla new price target

"So does a $50b. market cap and $292 share price presume Tesla will have exponential growth? If so, does a production increase of 6,413 (86,555 q4 from 80,142 q3) exponential growth?

"TSLA is now trading at $4,157.do pre split price and people are buying it ????????????? What are they thinking?? Share price is higher than AMZN!!!"
Did I read that right? Aliens are responsible for Elon's pyramid scheme?
How much did people really think the index funds would actually pay for this? How long did they all think the buying would last? Did they all really think Wall Street did not have mechanisms in place for block trades and predicted large share demand?

This is going to 1700 on Wednesday!
"If you read the words of Elon who's saying Tesla will get it's delivery up to volume ""in the coming months"", isn't that a sign that it isn't going to happen as promised in the coming days? The street is anticipating the end of this month to see 5,000 T3's roll of the assembly line. It's only the 4th or 5th delay in the delivery window."

TSLA is still way ahead of its competitors. The investing in this company has never been about earnings. I have faith in Musk and his vision (and so does Cathie Wood). Never selling.

"""A crowd doesn't reason, it only thinks it reasons."""

His biggest problem - like many have said - is the lack of demand for the Model 3. People simply do not want the car. Add in the quality problems and bad interior it is not looking good. Here in CA it is well know TSLA is stuffing unsold units at stores and in fields across the state. It was a good idea on face value. When looking overall his cars are not green and he is fleecing taxpayers. Time will tell where this ends up.
"Tesla has confirmed that its next quarterly earnings report will be published on Wednesday, January 27th, 2021. Tesla will be holding an earnings conference call on Wednesday, January 27th.It will be amazing!!!! I will buy a couple of shares on Monday!!!"

This might be the quarter TESLA beats earning and drops. It will have to be a massive beat or the market may not react too well.

Elon has 40+ Million Twitter followers. Far far greater than any entrepreneur.
"Cmon Elon Musk twitter something positive about $GME and roast that shortys, Ill buy $TSLA shares from that gains ;D"
"Elon is wishing he took a salary. rather than stock compenstation based on share price. I've read that even his homes are used for collateral against his debt. He's going to lose everything. I'll give him credit for being a brilliant visionary and idea creator. So he will likely bounce back, and he's still young. But, I cannot imagine losing nearly $20B in wealth"
They are going to offer a $25K model which tells me the fanatics buying the $80K models are fading away. There's no money to be made on a $25K car.

"It has been a fun week. Have good weekend to anybody, no matter longs or shorts."
wait what?
Another stock split? Thoughts?
"Just getting here and I?m sure this been discussed. This quoted from the article: ?In its application, Tesla argued that the new tariffs on the Model 3?s computer would eat into their already-thin profit margins, and cause ?economic harm to Tesla, through the increase of costs and impact to profitability.?So, which is it, thin margins that are at risk, or Musk asserting they ?stand a good chance of having their best quarter? #$%$ world are we living in?"
$TSLA Tesla would have to post over 4x the profits of the top ten automakers combined to justify its valuation.
"Good morning. I know it's early. I only have one share of Tesla at $670 with about $145 in profit. Should I sell it to buy shares in CCIV after hearing about the merger between Lucid and Churchville. Sorry to all the Tesla fans. I'm not a basher or bot. Just trying to make some money with what little I have. I don't think it would make a difference with one share, when I can get on the rise with another EV maker. Thoughts? Appreciate it."
"I’m a new trader, if it’s earning day, should it going low?"
Tesla says the production halt is meant to increase the output.It's gotta be some genius math or something......
"Even if Tesla does 100K model threes, this quarter will be a disaster. This is purely an attempt to move metal for cash that is badly needed. You don't slash prices, lay off employees on 3 separate occasions, close stores, and move cars to Europe where you have lower margins if there is demand in North America. Tesla barely made a profit last quarter selling 90,000 cars. Imagine how bad Tesla will miss making a profit moving these lower margin models overseas were transportation costs and other costs will be much higher than in the US. Model 3 has cannibalized Model S and X sales and pre-orders for Model Y are under 12k hence the reason the ""expensive"" referral program is back. Musk has mortgaged his properties and his plane for personal liquidity. This is just another stock pump and his all-in moment. Tesla will lose 100's of millions of dollars and his only hope is deliveries will hide the fact that all demand has been pulled forward and Tesla cannot produce enough cars at high enough margins to survive.

I’ve worked hard all of my life I put 40 years into my 401k I never thought I would be a multimillionaire but TESLA changed all that for me THANK YOU ELON
NIO has better cars in few aspects...In China battery swap option will play a big role!

My simple advise don't short this stock even if its overvalued. Simple reason : Lot of people short tesla and some good news come out so they have to cover and stock goes up ...
The fund managers get a special discount
"When you buy Tesla, you don't buy a company - you buy the idea and join the movement, by essentially loaning your money to Elon...This is why I think that Tesla is not a bubble."
"Wow, even ARK itself is at risk because of TSLA and other highly speculative investments. Meltdown could become thermonuclear."
I see another stock split
TSLA is light years ahead of the competition that is just now starting to switch to EV. LUCID? still has a motor. More components to break. TSLA is a battery and a million mile vehicle. Buy the dip. When has this stock EVER failed your portfolio?

The high stock price is based on very high potentials Tesla has in the future. Invest with 3 to 5 year horizon folks.

"Been looking around the web about response to Nio Day. It is very bullish. $TSLA has the high stock price it has relative to sales because of its tech, first mover status, and the future sales it will and is starting to yield. $NIO just unveiled the type of tech that will have the same impact. And, comparing their growth story and sales levels to $TSLA, it is obvious that NIO should be waaaay higher (not TSLA levels, but it should get to about $175 EOY). It is not a matter of TSLA vs NIO. It is TSLA & NIO vs the ICE companies who are five years behind NIO and TESLA on the tech. The long drive to $175 starts Monday."
"1000 years from now, people will look at the current price and think ""that was a great buying opportunity"".Think not in decades but in generations."

"Lot's of naysayers and distractions, but Tesla has proven that it can deliver a quality electric car and home system at a profit. Everyone else is just talking. GM is cancelling it's first electric car because it was not profitable. I'd say Tesla is way ahead of everybody else at this point."
BUY WITH BOTH HANDS BOYS AND GIRLS>>>>ELON JUST SAID FILL SELF DRIVE WILL BE OUT BY Q2>>>>THIS is HUGE NEWS>>>>AND 20 BILLION TO INCREASE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TIME>>>WITH MANY MORE FACTORIES TO COME>>>>TESLA EVEN MAKES ITS OWN CHIPS AND BATTERIES NOW>>>REVENUE IS GOING TO GROW A ON THIS YEAR>>>AND NO PANDEMIC!!
"I was just able to short. So shares are available. Pleasant surprise, haven't tried for a few weeks. Thanks for the spurt!!!I think $300-310 range, Elon will do share offering"
"This is sad so many investors think teslas bull run will continue. I guess you have to have 20 years in the market to know that will not happen. TESLA must fall further, I have no doubt its a great company. But people can not sell everything they own to buy TESLA, its not rational. All those investors will start to see. This is just the beginning. I know it is scary to think about it."
I am still very bearish on this. $380

Shouldn’t have invested in Bitcoin gonna have fun shorting this
HONESTLY I COULD REALISTICALLY SEE TESLA GOING TO $1 PER SHARE USD
"From Wall Street Journal today:ZWICKAU, Germany—Five years and nearly $50 billion into the auto industry’s biggest bet on electric vehicles, Volkswagen VOW -0.78% CEO Herbert Diess and his guest, Chancellor Angela Merkel, stood in anticipation as the first ID.3, Germany’s long-awaited answer to Tesla, rolled off the assembly line.The event at the company’s flagship EV plant just over a year ago marked a “systemic shift from the combustion engine to the electric vehicle,” said Thomas Ulbrich, leader of the ID.3 effort.The car, however, didn’t work as advertised.It could drive, turn corners and stop on a dime. But the fancy technology features VW had promised were either absent or broken. The company’s programmers hadn’t yet figured out how to update the car’s software remotely. Its futuristic head-up display that was supposed to flash speed, directions and other data onto the windshield didn’t function. Early owners began reporting hundreds of other software bugs."
AIV Tanked 86% this morning.
"Regulators want to halt the stock for 30 days because they think investors will get hurt... as if they really care. If so, why did they let $tsla run from $164 to $4000 in two years? How about $AMZN from $500 to $3400 in three years? Oh, and $ZM from $60 to $588 in 6 months. So, it's okay for any other stock to run but NOT ok when one of their hedge funds gets destroyed from greed."
We are at a low right now...I'd get in with everything you got because this will continue to rise into the afternoon and will spike just before the close as the volume skyrockets. WE WILL SEE $700+ today folks.Also don't give into temptation...hold 100% of your shares...this will cause the buyers to bid the tape up...don't sell to them!
Will be interesting to see how this this stock will do if there is 1:4 split now.. shorts will be happy and so is JPM
"Tesla could soar over 300% to reach $2,500 in the next three years, the venture capitalist and veteran tech analyst Gene Munster told CNBC on Monday.

I was thinking of buying TSLA but Musk told me my money is better spent at BTC. Thanks ELON...
Drop was faster than I anticipated all of a sudden. Took off some risk. Sold 100 shares at $838 and $785. Bought a $750 strike LEAP call (jan 2020 exp). sold a couple of Feb 800 strike puts. Bouth a couple $900 strike March exp. calls.
"CEO Elon Musk has not sought pre-approval for any tweet related to the automaker since striking a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), according to a filing by the commission with a judge.

"From an options perspective, I think that Tesla has another year of status quo. It’s losing money. The subsidies are helping turn a profit. But in practice, Tesla is running one big marketing campaign and buying market share at a loss. They can’t make a profit on the car. And Wall Street will give it another year Of profits going away offset by business growing. But eventually what will start mattering to them is profitability. Which Tesla will not figure out and deliver. And then the markers will turn for Tesla. Another year...only thing that will accelerate that is a COVID-induced recession before then. Thanks for reading. Yes, I’m high."
I'm gonna be the one to say it. I have no idea what's gonna happen. so I'll wait and see
Only 2% pre-Market after 2 weeks of bloodbath? not even a good dead cat bounce. This is only getting worse

Remember the earnings conference call where Musk announced selling his FSD(full self driving) package to other OEMs which he announced already in 2016...and in 2021 it's called beta where the driver is responsible for everything. That isn't level 5 autonomy but level 3 and that's what Mercedes already has and it's much more robust. Not driving under lorries because they actually use radar and lidar.
the Tesla vehicles are just the beginning...similar to the iPhone....any Tesla owner is far more likely to also own a battery pack in home as well as a Tesla roof...both these segments took substantial leap up in recent quarter......and now Tesla has in house battery factory..and building 2-4 new factories....2 will be producing this year...with full self drive cyber truck and model y sales in china and being added to s and p...the full bull case has been activated...stay long this thing could easily double again boys!!!!!!!!!
"@Musk - Here's an idea: Seeing as Apple would like to infringe on your EV turf, how about a smart phone that puts customers first? One that doesn't track us and sell our privacy out to advertisers? We currently have two options in Apple and Google, neither of which put customer's privacy first. Elon Musk has saved the environment with electric cars, and saved the space industry with reusable rockets ... Save humanity with privacy respecting smart phones! (and take a chunk of iphone profits/marketshare in the process)"
"Musk's option compensation plan provides for 12 tranches of grants totaling a little over 100 million shares with an exercise price of about $70. The 12 tranches have a market cap requirement starting at $100 billion with $50 billion increments up to $650 billion. This market cap has to be sustained for both 30 day and 200 day moving averages. Right now, the 30 day moving average requirement is satisfied for all 12 of the tranches. The 200 day moving average is now around $400/share, well below the $650 market cap level since TSLA didn't move up to $650 billion in market cap until December, 2020. But, if the stock stays above about $675 for another 4 months, the market cap requirement will be satisfied for all 12 of the tranches. The important thing to understand, once this is achieved, it doesn't matter what happens to the stock price as far as the vesting of the options go.The second requirement for vesting of tranches involves 8 revenue levels and 8 adjusted EBITA levels. Any one of these can be used 1 and only once to activate one tranche of grants. So far, it appears that the first 2 revenue milestones ($20 billion and $35 billion) will be satisfied in 2021 as 4th quarter 2020 revenues were over $10 billion. The next levels ($55 billion and $75 billion) might well be satisfied when TSLA first sells 1 million and then 2 million vehicles respectively. This would be 4 of the 8 revenue milestones. If say by 2025 TSLA TSLA sells 5 million vehicles at an average price of $35k, all 8 of the revenue milestones will have been satisfied.But, Musk doesn't need to have all the revenue Milestones satisfied. The first 5 adjusted EBITA milestones either have been or will shortly be satisfied already as the adjusted EBITA was already at $1.85 billion for 4th quarter 2020 and the milestone of more than a total of $8 billion for 4 consecutive quarters requires only a modest increase in EBITA in the next 2 quarters to be reached. It's reasonable to expect adjusted EBITA to exceed $14 billion (the top of the 8 milestones) by the end of 2022.Achievement of 8 EBITA milestones and 4 revenue milestones will be enough to vest the options (assuming the market cap milestone is satisfied, which seems certain baring a sharp decline in TSLA stock. Musk will then have options to buy 100+ million shares at $70/share.If TSLA really is a $800/share stock at that time, this grant will be worth over $70 billion dollars. Not a paid payday for at most 5 years work. If you have a corporation which does great, except it costs nearly $15 billion year to pay the CEO, it is going to be hard to have much left over for the common shareholders.What will the next pay package require? Not likely that Musk will be so foolish as to settle for options when he already has 100 options ""in the bank""."
Anyone bearish on TSLA is either a troll or a heavy short lol
Still no refund of my reservation deposits. Could they actually be holding cash until after the quarter closes? Ya think that's a bad sign?
Head of production has left Tesla per Electrek
Buffet is too conservative. His personality vs Elan's is totally opposite... It's a no-brainer for Tesla to take advantage of the auto insurance business... win-win situation for them and the customers - customers pay less auto premium and Tesla insurance company takes most of the insurance money as profit because there are extremely tiny portion of the Tesla cars will be involved in accident. See how simple I am getting to the point...

"Tesla's success has sown the seeds of its failure. If Tesla hadn't gone up 10 times from it's price last March, but instead just rose a modest 24% each year, it might well have been an a successful track to increase in value 10 times by 2030.But, Tesla soaring stock price has drawn in a huge amount of capital into the EV market. The market always overdoes it when there is technological change creating a new product. There will end up being excess capacity and all the EV makers will be fighting for market share and profits will be meager at best. At least 1/2 of them will end up in bankruptcy. This is the lesson of the past. The 1960's had the color TV boom. Every household was going to buy one. And they did and the TV makers went bust or were bought out by the Japanese.Aluminum was the growth industry of the 1950's as lightweight aluminum was revolutionizing products. The big three aluminum companies advertised heavily on TV as the metal of the future. Kaiser and Reynolds have disappeared and ALCOA is still around ceased being a growth stock in the 1960's."

"Here is why the bitcoin investment is a huge red flag. You can downvote and be a cultist or do your due diligence. Tesla’s market cap can only be so high, relative to other automakers, due it’s first move advantage. It has to develop quickly and capitalize to corner this market. It is a fewer years ahead of the competition. But the competition is fierce and tesla needs to grow and grow fast to justify it’s current stock price. So how does a 1.5 B investment in bitcoin help? It doesn’t! It squanders the capital it could put into new factories and R&D by making a gamble. It signals to investors that a huge bitcoin investment is more profitable then investing on their core business.This crash will be spectacular"

Robinhooder’s are waiting for 1200 dollar to buy this by the time they get money. They will be able to afford 1.5 shares.
"I can't believe how many of you are getting this wrong.Previously:$49k = $35k base + $9k (Long range;RWD) and $5k (mandatory premium package; Glass roof, ect...)Now you get....$44k = $35k base + $9k Mid range (smaller battery; RWD) and no mandatory premium package.Nothing changed other than then new configuration. All they did was charge you more for a smaller battery, but not require a premium package (which by the way, is no longer available - you can no longer buy long range w/RWD)IMO, this could turn into a brilliant move and get more buyers to move up market to lock in $44k option with full tax credit, instead of waiting for $35k with partial credit. Underestimate Tesla at your own risk."

"Congrats to all the Tesla stock owners who have gotten rich off the stock. Sadly I was way too late to the game. To those future owners who are going to get destroyed when this stock collapses, I offer my condolences to you ahead of time. Everyone one of you knows that you can not make a rational, logical reason why Tesla should be above $300. Even $200 is stretching it. Though Tesla is the main game in town if you want an EV today, in 5 years that will not be the case. Consumers will have dozens and dozens of alternative models from Europe, Asia, and the US to choose from that fit their tastes. Even if Tesla remains the number 1 brand for EV, the odds of it taking more than even 20% of the market share is small. So ride the wave up but be careful. I admit these levels make me too scared even to entertain buying Tesla. Sure it might go up $1000 more in the next 6 months. The house could collapse in a few months down to $400. I will look try mining my riches elsewhere."

"Heavily margined Tesla gamblers (especially the fractional share buyers on platforms like Robinhood) are about to learn a very old and very hard lesson. It's amazing how every stock bubble always brings out these true believers who think they've stumbled upon the one true path to riches. As the stock goes higher and higher, they're justifications for the valuation get more and more absurd (Robotaxis!! Self-driving!! Hyperloops!! Fed will never let stocks go down!! ""It's not a car company...it's a tech company!!"" etc. etc. etc.)What's sad is that most of them will end up losing every penny and then some because they used margin, and they have been conditioned to ""buy the dip""...so they will chase Tesla down to the single digits."
Lol you guys acting like tesla missed earning first time? Revenue is growing and the plunge was because market was down and along with that earning missed so it panic
"I see the same arguments from the $TSLA shorts that were prevalent when $NFLX $AMZN were losing money during their expansion (BTW they are still expanding!!). Unlike the other companies, making cars and building necessary infrastructure is very costly. And yet, they ignore the fact that every single car tesla sells makes money (that is cost per car is less than what they sell for) and the reason for quarterly loss is the money spent paying for debt, and infrastructure building. They way things are going no capital raise needed and they are selling enough cars every month with enough margin to make the spending and expansion sustainable. Longs are not looking for profits right away (of course it will be nice), expansion is the game right now to make sure your #1 position is maintained when all these ICE makers are trying to compete with you with little to no success so far. The only ones bringing up profitabiulity and doubt are the shorts..no doubt about it. But next week they are about to be bamboozled"
"It was obvious since yesterday - institutions like hedge funds, mutual funds sold TSLA yesterday to buy up value stocks. Same thing will happen today - more selling on tech and buying on value (low PEs)People will realize it after they lose 50%+ of their capital like GME."

"Now that TSLA is at 850 and at 1617 P/E i think it's time to consider again the product vs. it's competition. There are many competitor EV cars and trucks now and many more coming that are more comfortable, roomier, ergonomically more sound, offer better customer service and better range. Tesla has great brand recognition but not a great product and I think in 6 months to a year's time we will be thinking of this stock more like a myspace. One of the originals but not the pick moving forward."

The next Enron. This bubble will pop soon. 500 billion market cap despite NEVER making a profit.

So many people here unable to adjust their hypothesis. This one is bearish for rest of 2020 and will restart in Q1 2021.

"Latest prices of Tesla $TSLA Nio $NIO Xpeng $XPEV and Li Auto $LI Tesla has slashed prices of its made-in-China Model Y cars to woo drivers in the world’s largest electric vehicle market, ratcheting up pressure on its global and Chinese rivals that focus on the premium segment.The Long Range version of Model Y starts from 339,000 yuan (US$52,074), excluding a government subsidy, 30 per cent cheaper than the price quoted six months ago when presale orders could first be placed.- Xpeng Motor’s P7 all-electric sedan, start from 229,900 yuan after government subsidies. - Li Auto’s ONE SUV sells for 328,000 yuan, - NIO’s ES6 SUV starts at 346,600 yuan. Prices are several notches higher for foreign marques, - Mercedes-Benz EQC going at 499,800 yuan- BMW’s iX3 retails for 469,900 yuan.I think the biggest competition to Telsa, Xpeng, Nio and Li Auto is the PRC traditional auto manufactures as BAIC, SAIC, Geely and BYD for example. I am personally and professionally bullish about the PRC EV market and think 8 - 10 companies will dominate like Telsa, Nio, Xpeng, Li, WM, BAIC, SAIC, Geely and BYD and then there will be least expensive (but not that profitable) and the top end luxury foreign JVs like Mercedes, VW doing well too to make up about 12-15 companies leading EV in PRC.For Nio, Xpeng, Li and WM, they will continue to do very well and have significant upside both in business and stock valuations."
Keep adding Tesla. Going to $4000

Interesting thing is recently all the things as promised are happening !!
"I love my Tesla but honestly, service sucks, the local service center is overloaded and the service quality is not good anymore (it was fantastic 2 years ago), a flat recently we had to wait for 2weeks to get an appointment to repair it. I think the net challenge is service for the company, more than the competition."
Dancing right now on our way to 400
Tesla's valuation increased by >$30B on 30th December after Dan Ives' bullish call of 510k-520k deliveries. Tesla's sales for 2020 are $28 Billion. Tesla missed its own delivery targets and surely missed the bullish case of 510k-520k deliveries. I wonder what this hype is about.I am dumping this piece of #$%$ as soon as the market opens. It simply doesn't stand a chance.

"Tesla's current valuation is pricing in perfection untill 2027: in which growth rate continues or accelerates from previous levels, Tesla will offer robot taxi, Tesla will have a cure for Alzheimer, Tesla will make own batteries, Tesla will use Neurolink for other applications, Tesla will be basically the only EV car without too much competition. To my personal opinion: it is trading at a high risk, low reward level."

I bought 100 Tesla shares in the 190s pre split (sold half of them at 700 post split to buy a duplex).Everytime there is some red the same guys come out as if this time is finally their time. But we all know how it always ends.
"$TSLA Tesla cannot lose until it has investors like me who believe in Musk and in Tesla. I was not going to sell if the price was $800 today and I’m not going to sell if the price is $100. In Elon I trust , he is very credible leader not like others who create hype and then disappear. he walks his talk, he even says when stock is overvalued. That is what make ppl trust him. $500 eod is imminent and I can’t wait to roast all the beers very very soon. Also, Elon will only reward those who believe in the company and hold strong in bad market. Bullish"
"Hardy last night the company gave no real guidance for 2021 on deliveries. But it will be more like 750,000 with wafer thin margins and a big fall in carbon credit payments. There is some forced buying as tracker funds top up after inclusion in S and P 500. But this is a bubble about to pop."

"In 2018, Musk predicted 2020 deliveries in a range 750K-1M. Now somehow, the 500,000 actual deliveries that will actually occur is being spun as a huge success rather than a big disappointment. For the most part, the press has given TSLA a free pass on the numerous occasions it has backtracked, sandbagged, lowballed, or otherwise manipulated sales and profit figures."

What do you think the impact on Tesla's stock price if the Solar City does not go through and what do you think the likelihood of that happening?
If it goes to $650 I may gamble on a bounce but not for long.
"Tesla does not have a COO (chief operating officer). Musk looks increasingly erratic.

"DO NOT SELL!!!!!! HOLD YOUR SHARES!!!!!! BE REWARDED!!!!!! Use your focus on Tesla's fundamentals to your advantageSmart Tesla shareholders have already used these coming fireworks as an opportunity. You can see simply from the nearly $200 per-share rise in the automaker's stock price since the S&P 500 announcement that those who might have sold their stock have instead held off, knowing they'd have guaranteed buyers come Dec. 18.Those who are interested in a long-term investment in Tesla will have two things to consider. In the absence of company news to the contrary, there's reason to believe the path of least resistance for Tesla's share price in the next two weeks will be upward. Following the addition on Dec. 21, many short-term traders will then sell off their stock for a profit, potentially creating a short-term dip. What might make the most sense for those looking to add Tesla is to buy half now and then wait until after the S&P 500 event is done to buy the other half.The key thing to remember, though, is that in the long run, the disruption caused by Tesla's addition to the S&P 500 won't matter much. If Tesla's fundamental business fails to perform well, then naysayers will be proven right. But if Tesla executes on all its potential, further gains lie ahead."

I thought there was a law against this stock going down. That's what my broker told me.

Latest news. Big trouble with Gigafactory 3...Just google or twitter yourself on JL W reports.
What everyone on this board think about SP reaction tomorrow resulting from the settlement.? My take is that the SP react positive and we should recover rather quickly from the drop resulting the lawsuit.

I dont think Elon goes to jail..I do think he has to step down as CEO of TSLA and is fined HUGE....then all the lawsuits will kick in and finally do the company in.
$NIO way undervalued compared to $TSLA. Nio deliveries 2020. 17702 Tesla 178000. Ie 10 times....NIO market cap 25 billion Tesla 442 billion ie 18 times .....NIO stock price 20 dollars Tesla 475 ie 24 times higher. Not saying Tesla is over priced but am saying NIO is way underpriced when compared to Tesla. Both companies leaders in their future prospects Truly believe major upside for NIO compared to Tesla GLTA

"LOL. When other autos build EV's in abundance, TESLA is doomed. Watch out everyone, this success will not last forever. People will sell off and buy other car makers very soon. BMW, APPLE, FORD, NIO, ETC this is just the beginning for them. TESLA can't keep up the hype the way he is influencing the masses right now. Its almost a 300 dollar stock again.

Day Traders are not Investors!!!
$695 is TSLA’s actual close price for today verified per E*TRADE. There were a lot of market order at close executed which trigger the huge volume and price spike at the close.That messed up my my covered call going to be assigned cause I thought the close price was at $658.34.Just bought back my 100 shares and updated my tax preference to Last in First out so it doesn’t trigger my long term gains all at once.What a crazy day’s action watching the price movement. Going to be crazy again all of next week.Good luck all!!!
You might want to let some go here..:
"Little history lesson, Just before the pandemic, TSLA was about 950. The pandemic hit, and it dropped to around 350. Then it slowly soared to around 2300 in August before the split. I see this going down again, just like before, during this next pandemic wave and the whole cycle repeats itself. After the split it was about 440 p/s so that 400 was the 2300 split which was soaring. So, cut that in half, maybe the 190"
"Holding 40 shares at average price $831, what should I do? :("
"Futures are green , hoping tomorrow is another lovely green day"
"Tesla is still trading at $3,400 pre split. This is not a substantial sell off. TSLA is a car company that's in the energy space and now bitcoin. I think $1,600 pre split or $350 now makes more sense."

"Steve ((((( Do not be confused by the Shorts misinformation campaign. The Model 3 will be profitable day 1 )))100% false. Tesla will fail to launch on July 1, 2017 . So on ""day 1"" the Model 3 will not produce any revenues nor will it incur any costs. It will not be in production. BTW on the first day of production the Model 3 will almost certainly produce a positive gross margin (not a profit) and will tend to push Tesla toward profitability. But that is based on assumptions related to the life of the Model 3 and how many units Tesla will sell. If Tesla spends $2 billion on the program and depreciates the costs over 5 years ($400 million per year) and assumes 200,000 units sales per year - then each units needs to cover $2,000 of fixed costs related to depreciation. That is on top of other fixed costs like R&D, overhead, managements, marketing, The first cars produced tend to have the highest margins because the buyers are motivated and want the new vehicle and Tesla can load them up with high margin options. As time goes on the margins tend to shrink and the ""tire kickers"" come in looking for a bargain. For a full line manufacturer this is offset by new products being offered for other segments. For Tesla it will be magnified because they have a very limited product portfolio."

"Newsflash: Stocks remain under pressure after Trump criticizes the Fed, and Tesla is about to run out of cash.In other news, ""Japan is facing a Ninja crisis."" It seems that it's hard to find ninja's given Japan's low unemployment rate of 2.5%.Amazing."
"Tesla has had a great run! If you’ve made profits take some off the table and listen to Goldman Sachs!Okay, I know the popular line is oil is dead...but is it really realistic to say a product with 95 million barrels per day in global demand (and quickly rising back to 100 mm Barrels per day) is dead?Secondly, the oil companies have developed a huge business and engineering infrastructure that will help them in the transition to green energy over the couple of decades.The investment thesis is as follows:Intro- Oil production is lower than global demand as evidenced by the lower trend of US & Chinese oil stocks. Going forward oil supply will be constrained by government policies to encourage investment in green energy, however, due to global reliance on fossil fuels, oil demand is not projected to fall until 2055 - it will continue to grow at around 2% per year. Thesis-The combination of decreased production and rising demand create the catalyst for the final long term secular bull market in the oil and gas industry with prices between $100-$150 starting in 2023. Details-Diversify your recent gains into the oil & Nat gas sector while the market is undervalued. The Green energy transition is limiting oil supply through government policy. Demand is rising as Covid cases are dropping and vaccines are rolled out. See the US inventory report released every Wednesday and the China inventory report.Secondly refer to the recent Goldman Sachs report about the start of the secular bull market in oil. Expect $100-$150 oil beginning in 2023 through 2040.The cash flow generated by these prices will drive further innovation in green energy from oil companies and further result in the strategic buyout of wind and solar companies by the existing oil industry.An example of this trend is $OXY. They have developed the worlds first carbon neutral crude and the world’s most advanced carbon capture and sequestration technology. Warren Buffett owns OXY preferred. Today you can buy excellent companies or ETFs with high distributors at 1/2 price.$GEL for $6.00; $ET for $6.00; $OXY for $21 or $XLE for $41.Take some profits and invest in oil companies. It’s the only undervalued market sector remaining. The bull oil market is here for the next 12-15 years."

Musk has lied about the status of the company and given the Saudi's confidence that he will be cash flow positive, etc., causing them to make the investment decision or 2. They are investing based on some perception of future growth in selling high end electric cars.If we give Musk the benefit of the doubt here (I don't personally, but you may), and assume there is a great future selling $50,000 mid size cars, then it will be 2-3 quarters before the market gets a sense of the demand after the 'noise' is reduced. Here are the 'noise' items:(a) Manufacturing capability - Can they produce quality cars at capacity without huge capex? (b) Demand - Are there customers who will buy midsize sedans at $35,000 to $50,000 after the early adopters have been satisfied?(c) Government incentives - What will the impact be of government incentives and their end?(d) Run rate financial condition - Can the finances of the company stabilize enough to understand/differentiate between capital costs and operating costs so that it is possible to evaluate the profitability and potential cost savings.(e) and just to throw in one more, will the cars remain appealing from a design standpoint once there are a vast array of alternativesSo I think it will be a few quarters before a true evaluation of the company can happen. I wonder if the Saudi's and other potential investors will wait? I wonder if the balance sheet will hold up that long?Guru."
soon many other big techs will move out of california...like FB and AAPL...bye bye pelosi...impose high taxes to feed illegal immigrants....
congrats people who made money 2020... looking forward to 2021... happy new year to all
TSLA is GME in slow-motion.
"Yep, that vast international market has not been tapped...not even a bit. The ad based TV programming and streaming should be very attractive and a huge revenue generator for $ROKU $TSLA $QQQ $AAPL $NFLX $MSFT"
I repeat -- getting out over $300 is a gift.
"Goals for new year include electric trucks, 'robotaxis' Tesla will ring in 2021 with a ""war chest"" of around $20 billion, plenty to fund ambitious plans that include the launch of its futuristic-looking, all-electric pickup and heavy-duty trucks.Tesla (TSLA) is fresh from a $5 billion equity tap, its second in three months , which Chief Executive Elon Musk said he and other Tesla executives debated but in the end thought it was ""probably a good thing"" as it would retire debt and increase the security of the company.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas calculated that $20 billion, saying in a note Thursday that was his estimate for pro-forma gross cash balance. At the end of third quarter, Tesla said it had $14.5 billion in cash and equivalents, a bump of $5.9 billion from the second quarter.""We forecast Tesla to spend (about $50 billion) in combined capex and R&D"" from 2021 through 2025, a figure that could prove to be ""very conservative,"" he said. That also compares with $27 billion spending target at General Motors Co. (GM) over a similar time span, Jonas said.Besides the plan for the new pickup and commercial trucks, the year for Tesla also includes seeing to completion its two new factories, one outside Berlin, Germany and another outside Austin, Texas.Tesla said it was ""on track"" to start deliveries from the two new plants in 2021, with the Texas factory tasked with building the Cybertruck and the heavy-duty Semi in addition to Model Y and Model 3 vehicles for the East Coast. Tesla's factory in Fremont, Calif., is currently its sole vehicle-making plant in the U.S.There are also plans to focus on developing a fleet of ""robotaxis,"" expand its insurance offerings, and continue to develop its in-house battery cells it hopes to be cheaper and better-performing batteries.While Tesla has not given official word of its sales goals for 2021, it came close enough for some.On a call discussing third-quarter results with investors, one analyst estimated 2021 sales between 840,000 to 1 million vehicles, and Musk responded by saying that sales likely will be ""in that vicinity"" and that the analyst was ""not far off.""Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn then added that Tesla will provide official 2021 guidance when it reports fourth-quarter results in early 2021, seeming to prevent Musk from saying more. Tesla has kept its target to sell half a million vehicles in 2020.Tesla shares have broken strings of record closes this year, with the latest boost coming from a Dec. 21 inclusion in the S&P 500 index. Tesla's market valuation hovers around $600 billion. The stock also went through a 5-to1 split in August Optimism on Tesla has also lifted shares of other electric-vehicle makers such as Nikola Corp. (NKLA) and China's Nio Inc. (NIO), Li Auto Inc. (LI), and XPeng Inc. (XPEV), which have soared past their initial public offering prices. EV maker Fisker Inc. (FSR) had its IPO in October.GM in November announced a renewed push on EVs, and Ford Motor Co. (F) also has plans to add more EVs to its lineup."

STAY LONG TESLA GOING TO 800>>>>>>ENJOY THE RIDE
"bought 89 shares of this baby at 386$ some weeks after the split, saw it ride all the way up to 880 but didn't sell, I sold at 806$ and felt very guilty in the moment of doing so but now I see it was a great choice"
Last call to exit with enough money in your pocket. Take a small loss of hold the bag for x years. Max 1600 years :)
"MIchael Burry gave Musk a great advice - issue a massive number of shares right now!Why? TSLA is burning cash every day - yup, every single day. With higher sales, it's burning much faster than before - check $ raised on last quarter in both stocks and debt, then look at cash balance.As someone said below, TSLA is aggressively reducing the prices since sales number is not as good as they thought.Now, Musk is open to a merger with other auto companies all of sudden. Why? He knows that the music is about to stop so he needs another catalyst to push the stock price.Unfortunately, there is nothing to talk about anymore but more competition and less demand."
Go NOW to Tesla website to see refreshed NEW interior of Model X and S!
even with a Recall of TslaShorts won't winStock keeps going up!!!!
"It's truly a miracle that this is still over $300, any normal company would be down >30% on such bad news."

Shorted 500 at $672It is called Irrational Exuberance
wow
Why can't Elon just stop tweeting nonsense like dogecoin? It's really taking a toll on the confidence of serious investors who believe in TESLA.
another 17% dropsee you at $539this may take couple days.....
Better sell now. God only knows what happens after hours today.
$330 at closing?
I'm holding long!!! Not letting go at least for the next 10 years!!!! hehehe
Overpriced garbage cars. When would dumb people realize that other car manufacturers are already making better electric cars than Tesla. Tesla stock worth more than 3 largest car manufacturers combined. Bloated
"I would feel much better paying $1,300 for a Tesla stock than $1,333 for an Ethereum coin.With Tesla you get 2 Giga factories that are up and runing, two+ yet to come... The possibility of owning a piece of XpaceX... And so much more.Etherum and other Crypto currencies just give you a piece of code?????I sleep well at night when I am invested in Tesla."
"Let’s get to 900 today and 1000 by Monday. 10,000 by February. Remember they sold almost 500,000 cars last year!"
I like to buy TSLA between 650-700
"longest bull market ending, return of da  bear"
Happy New Year to all Tesla longs. This will be a great year for us. Tesla will beat earnings at the end of the month and push the stock up to high 700’s. I believe robotaxi will be out by 2022 and change the perception of analysts. They will then realize Tesla is not just an auto company but a company that has changed forever the transportation industry with stock reaching 1000.00 again.
"The vast majority of retail Tesla investors will not only lose all their money, but will end up deep underwater due to margin debt.In everything bubble, retail thinks they've discovered a new paradigm and it will continue forever. The Tesla stock fraud had been particularly pernicious because it has been engineered by perhaps the greatest con artist of all time...Elon Musk, and enabled by the Fed and Wall Street while the regulatory agencies have looked the other way.many Tesla investors are not investors at all, but more akin to cultists along the lines of Scientologists. They have thrown critical thinking and skepticism out the window and happily burn their life savings on a car company which has never built a car profitably in its 17 year history, but builds vehicles with severe and extremely dangerous defects.There is no doubt that Tesla stock will crumble into the single digits...and perhaps go to zero as the company loses the only valuable asset it ever possessed: its first mover advantage. Unfortunately, the cultists will refuse to believe the tide has turned, and after a decade of buying the dip, they'll buy the dip all the way down to bankruptcy."
Shorts I know you're worried about the steady climb before opening. Did you make a huge mistake? Going to be crying to cover
Here comes another dip.BUY BUY BUY!!!!!HAHAHA
"Karma delays/abandons the mid-size sedan The Atlantic, instead moving ahead on a most likely SUV-styled offering. Why? Because the mid-size sedan market is collapsing! Model 3 is a mistake. The 400,000 ""orders"" (wink, wink) are a joke. Several other manufacturers will have alternatives to M3, about the same range and price, about the same time. And they will have the full $7,500 tax credit, while Tesla's will have been reduced, then eliminated."
Split coming soon 
I think musk should talk about Tesla instead of crypto
"Investor can’t blame on Tesla why it down 45point or 6.5%, because market down too. It may down another one or two days, than Tesla will jack up as helll it may up 10-20 % this Thursday- Friday or maybe early next week that the way how Tesla move"

"sold Visa, bought 1000 more TSLA this morning."
Reasons why I see $SOS as a 10 X stock short to medium term. Never said that about any other stock before. Including $TSLAhttps://youtu.be/C4frq87XoLk
"Tesla delivery number1.> <500K = Elon miss by 500. sound meaningless and I agree with meaningless in that aspect. so That is not bad news.2.> They produce About 510K and deliver about 500. They improve their production rate to 650k from about 500K which is acount for 3500 for 1 week or 7000 if you think average delivery time is 2 week. I think Elon always ship to Europe or other counties first and delivery USA at in last 2-3 week of Quater to keep Inventory low so 1 week if reasonable. So why he can't sell nearly 6500 car in inventory. This is really bad news in their release..Give stock run up bad news should matter way more than expected news. So While it going up, this is likely peak, Could end up generation peak given it now part of S&P 500 as well."
"From Charles Gasparino (via Seeking Alpha):""SCOOP: Bankers are inundating @Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) w refinancing ideas as two major bond repayments near,"" Fox's Charles Gasparino tweeted, not saying where he obtained the information.""One idea floated with be to raise about $5b in new senior secured debt to make payment etc on the notion the $TSLA battery brand and car are worth at least $10b in a worst-case bankruptcy.""""My UNDERSTANDING is that this debt would essentially take out the existing shareholders and these bond holders (if this happens and thats a BIG if) wld essentially control the company.""Interesting that the word ""bankruptcy"" is being used already."
"This is only the beginning. If you think this is fun, wait until the suppliers and bondholders come for their money--leading up to the December Chapter 11 filing"

"Some interesting Tesla-related news today. No, not the 100kWh battery, which is not the real news. That was released to keep you busy arguing about range anxiety and the value of 0-60 times.The real news was the SCTY filing sneaked in late in the trading day: ""Amendment No. 1 dated August 23, 2016 to Prospectus Supplement No. 23."" Not to bore the longs who think that the SCTY ""acquisition"" is hella freakin' awesome, but anyway Musk and the Rive bros. just ponied up $124M to buy 6.5% unsecured Solar Bonds. Yes, nobody else is willing to risk money on junk-grade investment instruments that SCTY is selling to keep the lights on until TSLA ""buys"" the company. So the Musk clan ponies up their borrowed money from share-backed loans or, in Elon's case, options exercised at the time of the last TSLA share issuance.I am guessing the so-called acquisition isn't about ""synergies"" at all, but simply a way to bury the disaster that is SCTY inside TSLA books. Today's event would yell you exactly that if you were interested. SCTY can't raise money any more.But anyway, the Model S can now go about 30 miles further, so let's get back to discussions about saving the world one $145k sedan at a time."
"This can't be good....... How come kimbal musk and all other officers sell every share they can every chance they get,.... like when options are issued and they become vested?Intelligent responses only please."

Tesla can not justify $809 billion of market cap.
"Hey shorties, why do you think we are three days away from the day, and 1 hour in we are already more than 30% volume today. Could it be that tracking funds are just now starting to buy? Could that be it?"
Pretty much hit his sky high goal of 500k deliveries in a 2020 pandemic year! Well done Tesla and Elon!!!
"Tesla also buying and developing big charge station infrastructure, thinking well ahead if the present, buy and hold long, ....."
"Buried in the 10k, but in BIG BOLD PRINT: ""Our future growth and success is dependent upon consumers’ willingness to adopt electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles. We operate in the automotive industry, which is generally susceptible to cyclicality and volatility.""So much for the contention that they should be priced like a big tech company. They are a car manufacturer period! They said it themselves and they put it in BIG BOLD LETTERS for everyone to see in their 10k. Everything else is BS!"

What if Tesla misses the delivery target? It is possible. It happened in the past and market reacted.
"Analysts were valuing it as a ""car company"" initially. They had low-ball estimates, and rightly so. ICE's depreciate quickly, the cost of production is very high, and margins are poor. What they missed are the AI aspects. From the factory to FSD. Software is a different beast. This will be the money-maker. To be fair, the analysts DO have one wild card left. If Tesla fails on FSD, the stock price will plummet 50% or more. That's the primary risk right now. Even with superior batteries, the valuation can't be justified without FSD."

I’m so glad I’m holding long term Tesla has made me millions we should ALL remember 20%. 50% or 1000% anyone holding longer than 30 days should be happy if your a day trader on Tesla you better be real good at timing cause this stock will eat you alive.

"My current position is very slightly short. I would never get long this pig but I am not going to get run over either. I really was surprised to see it cross above 695 today. I thought it would not do that. There is a pump going on right now relative to the yearly sales numbers. If it is above 500k, even if they had to sell at a loss to do that, then somehow that is a good thing. My assumption is that sellers will step in on the first week of the new year. The tax consequence of selling at the end of the year would be gone. Hopefully, the benchmark funds would be done with their buying. Re-balancing would have to occur with many funds, where they cannot hold any one position too large. Even for example, Ark Investments, had to sell some due to re-balancing. This stock is a hot potato. Buy at your own risk."
Is anyone else worried about all the competition that is suddenly coming out in the EV market?
"Even at $30 this is over priced. Total valuation is $52+ billion. Lucid has not sold a single car. Nada. All this talk about advance tech still doesn't equate to existing sales. Also, when Lucid does start selling, it'll experience recalls and customer reviews, etc which could drive the valuation lower. Remember, #TSLA has already gone through the cost of establishing a brand name. It doesn't happen overnight. Takes years. Lucid is no different. And, there is existing competition. Lucid has not even disclosed plans to sell in China, the largest EV market. Tesla and NIO, and others are already there. The real winners here are the Saudis. They got in cheap. They are not buying this at $30, or even at $20. This will drop to $25 billion valuation by/at merger completion. It's your money. Lose it as you wish. Buy SPACs where the underlying company is already making sales and are projected to grow. Good luck and thx for the thumbs down."

"If the mid-range version ($45K) only gets 260 miles of range, under perfect ideal conditions, what is the base battery ($35K) going to get? Overall vehicle weight, will be nearly identical, only savings will be in the cells themselves. All other components will be identical."

From $900 to $663 on it's way to $250 in one year. The competition that some thought would never come is coming from every corner now. And most of it high quality competition. Tesla's sales will suffer and margins will suffer even more. The recent drop is only the beginning.

"Oppenheimer raised its price target on Tesla to $1,036 from $486."
"Tesla is the most popular asset among young investors in Europe and as a result Tesla has taken a solid advance on strong growth. The stock market price has increased eightfold during the wonder year 2020, thanks in part to the enthusiasm of a new generation of young investors ('Robinhoods'). Just before Christmas, Tesla tore into Wall Street's most influential barometer - the S & P500 - sparking an additional buying wave. Tesla does not earn from the sale of electric cars, but from the sale of emission rights. The stock market value stands at a record $ 669 billion. In comparison, that is almost twice as much as the three 'classic' car manufacturers Toyota, Volkswagen and General Motors combined. Those three each produce about 10 million vehicles annually. The Tesla share is very expensive compared to the classic car manufacturers. I would like to know what the race will do on Monday. The stock market is not open today unfortunately."

Now, TSLA confirms to remain in public and the company has voiced a common voice and it seems like Mr. CEO has learned to control himself (i.e., no tweet about the plans or the decision) and focus on the tasks at hand.4. If there is any penalty or lawsuit settlement regarding the tweet, it will be minimal and will take a long time to conclude.Therefore, my guess is TSLA will be on the up near and far future. AND, shorts, you won't be sleeping well in the next few months."
"DeepScale has been using LIDAR on their test vehicle. Elon stated ""LIDAR is doomed"". Think there could be heated arguments as DeepScale is integrated?https://twitter.com/orthereaboot/status/1179126975505588224"
"Controlled destruction by the FED. Once the valuation becomes more manageable and less relevant, I'd not be surprised the S&P board delists this company out of the index. And then, folks, it will be a catastrophe for any longs holding at very high prices as the crash will be brutal."
Might we all remember Tesla stock price is simply back to where we were in December.
"ARK Invest bought 142,166 shares (worth over $54m) of $TSLA for their ARKK ETF today. In addition, ARK also bought 22,190 $TSLA shares (worth over $8.5m) for the ARKW ETF."
TSLA LONGS: Who else bought TSLA today?
"how many agreed that sales run through this week will be counted as being in March to save face with whatever teh ppor numbers are for the first quarter. Those volunteers cannot process orders / deliveries as fast as hoped. Yet there are people who actually believe Tesla can grow its production more than it is now but sale levels are capped with a tiny distribution network that is about to shrink when the stores are ultimately closed, either soon or when BK filing is made"
"I think it won't be long before you can book a trip to Mars. You pay via Bitcoin. The governments will have long since rendered their money paper worthless. The hi-tech will survive on its own. This is the way of progress. The Covid-19 virus has accelerated this. I now firmly believe in this. Tesla is a great thing and is above humanity. Musk has brilliant ideas. I underestimated it, but I've been converted."
Absolut to go up. Big.
And why is the stock falling over a protest?
"I was going to buy a Tesla car, but after losing thousands of dollars, I guess that idea is up in smoke!"

Correction over! It’s onward and upward again. $1000 by next week.
This market is going to explode. Gold losing -2.39% yesterday going back to the level shortly after the pandemic started with nearly dozens of trillions of dollars created out of nothing. The market might get up but inflation will go even faster.
"I'll preface this by saying shorting Tesla is a fool's game right now. But there is a timed race with Tesla. Take away the sales of the ZEV credits and this company is losing massive amounts of money. Tesla's entire operation is funded by governments fabricated credit scheme that allows Tesla to stay afloat. Should those arrangements change or should the demand drop for Tesla's ZEV credit sales, Tesla would be in deep trouble. One or both of those things will happen. As other companies develop their own ZEV vehicles, they will stop buying the credits. The only question is whether Tesla will be making money in their actual operations when it does."
I’ve been in and out many times never fully out. This over a 4 year span I stopped selling at around $1100 presplit. Currently holding 5133 shares and I certainly don’t feel like a big dog but I sure do feel like I clawed and scratched my way to a small fortune. I say thank you Elon almost everyday and all this because I bought the Model X in 2017 Tesla is fantastic !

Thank god I was able to free some cash and bought more...$1000 by end of the month
All of this talk about a chip shortage...Tesla is already ahead of that. They’ll just leave them out. One more recall won’t hurt

"If Tesla started the quarter with $6 billion and burns through $25 billion per quarter and they have to shut down for a month, they're done, right?"

UBS on $TSLA today: “Absent from the release was any color around future production targets. After ending 2018 w/ a M3 production rate of <5k/wk...we wonder if the company will ever be able to achieve a sustainable >5k/wk M3 production value.”
"Good bye sellers. HELLO buyers, welcome to $TSLA. Enjoy your stay and profits."
"For Tesla, Deliver, Don't Promise, in 2018BY MarketWatch— 10:44 PM ET 12/29/2017Elon Musk is best when he sketches out Tesla(TSLA) Inc.'s distant future. In 2018, Mr. Musk should focus on the mundane present.The new year will present Tesla's greatest operational challenge. Rather than issuing promises of an electric semi truck, a new sports car and a pickup truck, as he did in recent months, Mr. Musk needs to figure out how to produce hundreds of thousands of mass-market sedans at a profit.If he can't, Tesla could find itself trying to raise capital in a less-friendly market, meaning his highly loyal shareholders could be hurt by a wave of stock issuance. So far, the investors have forgiven Tesla for its production problems. Shares were up 47% in 2017, and Tesla's market value of $53 billion rivals that of Ford Motor(F) Co. and General Motors Co.But the gaudy stock performance belies a more-troubled picture.Tesla delivered just 220 of its Model 3 mass-market sedans in the third quarter, well below its forecast of 1,500. Tesla, which will report fourth-quarter deliveries next week, said in November that it hopes to achieve a production rate of 5,000 cars a week by late in the first quarter of 2018, after previously predicting it would hit that milestone this year.More downward revisions to growth expectations are possible. Analyst consensus calls for Tesla to deliver about 180,000 Model 3s next year; it will be very hard to hit that estimate without a quick ramp-up in deliveries.The Model 3 was supposed to generate big profits for Tesla but is nowhere close to doing that. Analysts expect an adjusted loss of over $10 a share in 2017 and the same in 2018, according to FactSet. A year ago, those analysts expected a loss of 97 cents a share in 2017 and a profit of $1.59 a share in 2018.Tesla investors have always been willing to forgive overly aggressive forecasts. But heavy capital spending to bring the Model 3 online, as well as Tesla's 2016 acquisition of SolarCity, have strained the balance sheet. That, along with fresh electric-car competition from rivals, means increasing urgency to actually deliver on these promises.The stock has sold off nearly 20% from September's recent high. Tesla needs to keep its share price high, since it uses the capital markets to fund its operations. More debt doesn't seem like a practical solution--Tesla issued $1.8 billion in bonds due in 2025 over the summer; those bonds now trade below par. And the lower the stock price, the more any new equity raise would dilute existing shareholders.Don't underestimate the challenges Tesla faces. The company has never produced a fraction of the cars it needs to deliver, and it has never made a profit while selling far more expensive vehicles. Producing more cars won't solve the problem without quantum leaps in production efficiency.In the coming year, Tesla will be judged on operations, not hype."
Lol where are the shorts today!? 
Good to see the TSLA stock having another nice uptrend day. Avoid the noise. The price will increase.
TSLA. What a day!!

"New highs to 700, and then 900. I am seller at 925-950"

"Chinese electric car start-up Nio said Tuesday a shortage in semiconductors and batteries will cut its production capacity in the second quarter to 7,500 vehicles a month, down from 10,000.Has Tesla been able to avoid this industry wide shortage?"

"Wheah’s Cathy Tesla when we need her . Oh , out buying bitcoin ."
"just to be clear, Ford DID take a taxpayer funded bankruptcy bailout loan. these are the facts"

"Everyone bashing TSLA for using less than 10% of its cash to invest in BTC makes me very bullish. It amazes me that to this day, TSLA continues to change the world yet people are surprised and wary of their actions. Hilarious. Go invest in bonds or something."
"No one is buying mid-size sedans.Dodge cancels it's 200 model, offers 84 month / 0% loan just to get rid of them. This is one of the worst performing segments; of which Model 3 will be entering. Market research shows consumers prefer cross-overs, hatchbacks, and SUV's. It should be ""pencils up"" in the studio in Hawthorne."
Should I add to my position now or wait for a pullback? My share price is around $555.
"All I can say is bravo to tsla and the longs. The PR nightmare and narrative going around is so compelling I bought puts twice but I covered twice in two weeks at a loss. Someone, a market maker or Elon himself or some backers + general belief amongst boards of musketeers is keeping this thing alive, and I think that also translates to marketability, and real value, a company like volkswagon would buy in for the reach alone. I think these valuations —while far too high— will be sustained so long as the stock market is performing as it has been. If there’s ever a major downturn while this thing isn’t profitable, it could see sub $100 again, but for now I’m not touching this again!!!"
They are doing everything to keep it above 800. Once this is constant or below the last 60 days the greedy pigs will leave and the house of ponzi collapses.
Look at how Tesla traded before and after earnings announced in Jan 2020. It really exploded for the following week. Aggressive 2021 delivery projections are going to take this higher. Good luck longs.
"market imploding due to record margin debt , margin calls"
"Competition for Tesla coming from all sides....Listen to the bell, Elon. It tolls for thee."
Major tax selling this week to pay cap gain tax in 2022...also last weeks push was window dressing for fund managers to get TSLA into their portfolios before year end...there will be pain this week on top of the fact of botched vaccine rollout and Jan 5th senate runoff which dems are currently leading in both and Wall Street completely did not think that could happen...

How undervalued is the entire uranium sector at the moment?The entire market cap of uranium sector (17 billion$) =- 2% of the market cap of Tesla $TSLA (834 billion$)- 39% of the market cap of Barrick Gold $GOLD (43 billion$)- 34% of the market cap of Newmont $NEM (50 billion$)- 9% of the market cap of Exxon Mobil $XOM (192 billion$)- 10% of the market cap of Chevron $CVX (175 billion$)- 14% of the market cap of Boeing $BA (118 billion$)While:- Demand for uranium is price inelastic!- The uranium demand and supply need a +-60$/lb uranium price in the long term to get back in equilibrium (today uranium price sits around 30$/lb)- A lot of long term supply contracts of western utilities need to be renewed in coming years==> price discovery is coming, because uranium miners will not restart existing mines and surely not take the risk in building a new mine without the cover of signed off take agreements before the start- A lot of new reactors are build in China, India,… New reactor cores need 3 times the normal fuel renewal of an existing reactorThe question isn't IF it (uranium price go back to at least 60$/lb) will happen, but WHEN it will happenNot suggesting to sell positions on other stocks, just mentioning this for those looking for new opportunities at the momentCheers"

Investors in Tesla are unlike traders and shorts because they believe in the goals of the company. There will be maybe a small drop tomorrow but I believe that the stock will rebound fast and may very well go as high as $500 before end October."
I don’t understand this. CNBC & Varney & Co. have been reporting all morning about Elon reopening his factory. Did I miss it or did they not report here on yahoo. This has happened in the past when it took yahoo a few days to report positive news.

"The TSLA 4Q17 update letter shows the company with a negative working capital of $1.066 billion. To get there, the company had an increase in payables of $600 million, accruals $500 million, lease guarantees $607 million, and $190 million in customer deposits. Sooner or later the vendors are going to expect to be paid in full. Their payables turn at around 91 days.Interesting enough, ""Other"" in operating item addbacks to cash flow were $516 million, up from $150 million the year before. What constitutes this ""Other"" category? Any ""analysts"" from the big brokerages ever ask or question that?Year over year, the company went from a positive working capital at 12/31/16 of $433 million to the $1.066 billion at 12/31/17, a negative swing of $1.499 billion. Negative working capital has an effect on the ability to pay bills. Crickets."

There is a possibility that we will revisiting Worldcom Scenerio . Specifically towards Revenue Recognition as the management is anxious to ship out the vehicle by cutshorting PDI . There could be a tendency to push the accountants to keep the books open for few days more and predate invoices. Hope that doesnt occur here.
Sell buy back when it completely crashes
Do the Shorts and WS thugs/analysts have a clear understanding of not just $TSLA but any disruptive technology or platform? I guess not. They seem patient at the beginning and they turn and become very impatient just around the time when company is in at inflection point of loss/profitability and only to be believers once solid profits start rolling in. Such is the case with TSLA and WS analysts. Regardless of what happens today we still have a year or so before the profitability is consistent and guidance is more accurate.
the day wont end well for the shorts now will it...

"Anyone, anywhere, find anything, regarding the exact KWh of each truck, 300 or 500 range version? Since Tesla is already confident of the selling price, and the range of each version, they obviously must know the battery capacity. Not looking for speculation, but actual quantitative numbers? ""Mind blowing"" and ""To the moon"" are not quantitative, and least in my reality. A simple question, really. Oil Philter seems to think 200 kWh is enough. Maybe for a depot tug."

"Shorting doesn't mean you hate the company or the cars or the ceo, it just means you have the guts to put your money where your mouth is when you think the price has become way overvalued, reached an unsustainable level.There is nothing wrong with betting that a stock will go down, just as there is nothing wrong with betting that it will go up. These bets are the only way to make any real money on stocks that pay no dividend, holding yields nothing.You might own a Tesla and love it (and they are very nice cars), you might think Elon is a genius visionary pioneer (and in many ways he is), but you base your investment decisions on research and experience, you try to see beyond the hype. You analyse the factors that have lead to the bull run and figure out if they are genuine and/or sustainable.Figuring out where the market top (or bottom) is for a given stock is the holy grail of investing. It is trying to emulate what institutional traders do, in an attempt to extract margins surfing that wave both ways up and down, just like they do.Traditional investing and holding applies only for stocks that pay a dividend high enough to justify the investment. All else is speculation, buying in the hope that in time others will buy too and push the price up, or vice versa.Don't be misled by the reported short interest volumes, there are countless derivatives out there that are not counted in. And don't expect the price to tank all of a sudden - the whales are selling but drip-feeding the trades slowly through sophisticated selling alogos, they don't want the price to crash. If you're short make sure you can hold that position for at least 6 months. If you're long and want to hold make sure you are prepared to hold it for at least 5 years, otherwise best exit while the price is still high and come back later."
"Elon’s Legacy is spaceX, not Tesla... Tesla was made to fund spaceX"
"Tesla shares will become more hard to come by. Why? The index and quasi index funds bought 100-150 million and they are virtually gone from the market as these funds will be holding them. There are tons of other funds who have buy and hold strategies in place. Also many retail investors like myself are not going to give up my shares. Finally, all the pension and retirement funds will constantly be buying more Tesla and holding on to them. With every paycheck - money will go into the 401K and to index funds that have to buy more Tesla. To me - that just means stability and steady price appreciation."
Monster. Will not fall
As usual if this company bounces back like a yo-yo. So cool.

Tesla has years of growth ahead. I wont be selling any of my shares.
I bought Tesla back at $400 pre split. Not a huge position but I am up 450% with 5x the shares I started with. I live in Vermont ski country and I see a Tesla everyday. When I see a Tesla everyday with plates from numerous states along with VT that tells me something. A year ago it was a rarity to see a Tesla around here. I am in for the long haul.

"It's actually quite spectacular this stock has not crashed yet, considering more and more major car manufacturers coming out and committing to EVs in the future. This is going to eat in to TSLA's EV dominance and future growth that was factored into prior valuations. Not quite sure how analyst are coming out with these price targets over $800. Very risky stock to be buying at these levels IMO."

Tesla management and its board continues to show time and time again that it cannot be trusted, something I believe is critical when deciding whether or not to own shares. Tesla closed Friday down $65 from the August 7th high after the go private tweet, and the 2025 bonds were approaching new lows even before this decision was scrapped. How much will they fall on Monday, absent some other push to prop up the stock like opening up Model Y deposits or something else designed to distract.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4202113-tesla-staying-public-big-trouble"

"Don't trust any analyst who downgraded TSLA price. They wishes TSLA price much more lower, so they can make good purchase at a low price. Buy Tsla and hold it."
so many bashers trying to buy shares to flip hahahaha
Just because something is down does not mean its on sale lol
"Every car maker is rushing out their new battery electric cars, but I don't even know anyone who wants one. I see Price Wars in the future."
Does anyone know how many cars were sold in January or de we only get quarterly numbers ?
I’ve mentioned on several occasions to REMOVE STOP LOSSES or set them very low if you’re too scared. The big boys and loser analysts will manipulate this stock until the S&P500 are included. On 12/21 you will thank me for this advice. Then do as you please. I hate to see the new folk losing money due to stop losses. Or older folk for that matter. It’s going to be a bumpy ride. Hold tight and watch or just come back on 12/21. Good luck to all 
How convenient for fElonAll he needs to do in the future to justify the loses is to claim that he forgot the password for the wallet.

"Yo SEC , $40mm ain't nothing now a days. Take Elon to court and clean out dem pockets!"
Tesla may be fundamentally overvalued today but the company should more than be capable over growing into this valuation once Berlin and ATX come online. $1000 in MSFT when they went public would be worth $2M+ today. Formulation > Concentration > Critical Mass > Momentum > Long-Term Stable GrowthWhere is Tesla?
"It was announced today that the US gvt is going to switch it’s fleet of 640,000 vehicles completely over from ICE to EV, all made in American factories. I kind of feel like TSLA is the most well positioned of American companies to meet that demand."

Then the virus wins."
"So who thinks they are building the car for $29k? The only hope I see for them to make any profit is if people buy the Standard +, pay $1500-$2500 for a different color, pay $1000 for white interior, $1500 for 19"" wheels and $8000 for AP & FSD. Of course that bumps the price right back up to $50k."

"After a decade of blood, Sweat & tears of careful investing my primary portfolio finally crossed the $1 Million mark this past August, thanks in part to my Tesla shares.

"People ask ""how long can this last,"" when comparing the valuation to other auto co's, and in response I ask ""how long will it be before the other auto companies step up their game?""1. The valuation is on another level because Tesla is on another level.2. People are still comparing Tesla to car companies. As long as they do that, they will be missing about 80-90% of the big picture."
"I would love to know, if anyone holds tsla of worth 50 million here. So holding about only 715k shares."
Just for the record I have changed my name from Bill to Big Bill per another posters request. And to clarify I am the Bill that asks the pertinent questions like how much does the Tesla Semi weigh.

"Twelve EU countries are allowed to allocate billions to a research project into a new generation of batteries for electric cars. On Tuesday, the European Commission approved the state aid of 2.9 billion euros.The European Union wants to compete with China and other Asian countries, which largely control the battery and battery market. By 2025, the EU wants to have enough batteries of its own production and no longer buy them from the East.Businesses in Germany, France and ten other Member States can now claim government support to develop the battery of the future. BMW and Fiat, among others, would like to be eligible. The companies themselves are investing another 9 billion euros in the project.The European economy is facing enormous renewal, says European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager (Competition). That is why it is ""wise"" that governments and companies work together and share the risks. ""To help the industry develop more innovative and sustainable batteries."""

"Isn't Tesla way over-due to reveal a new vehicle or product, other than software? Seems like it's been a long time since the Cyber Truck was revealed. I would have thought at least a teaser of either a real SUV, an off-road capable Jeep/Bronco thingy, or at least the $25K small sedan/cross-over. What exactly is Tesla Design doing these day? I know refinement of the Cyber Truck is in play, but Musk concluded no facelift for Models S and Y. Just seems like there's been a drought of fresh product. Musk promised ""renderings"" of the revised design intent for Cyber Truck in November. I'm guessing Elon is holding these aces in his back pocket, as there is obviously no current need to pump share price; it's doing that on it's own."

Yahoo Finance love Gordon Johnson - he keeps on singing the same old song over and over again! No wonder he is always proven wrong!
imo 900 today on the bitcoin news. This will increase demand for Tesla cars again.
mute people with different views and who might be saying things you are not willing accept or goes against a dogmatic approach to investing.....that makes a lot of sense @don (and others I'm sure). I have nothing against TSLA bulls...and really congratulations on an amazing run! bulls or bears.. history has shown that real wealth is usually build by approaching investment without being married to an idea and knowing when to exit and reinvest gains into further gains.
"merry Christmas one and all, longs and shorts and neutrals."
"We all know what would make Tesla the most valuable company in the world. All Musk needs to do is to partner with someone to make mobile phones. Yes...mobile phones. Acquiring engineering talent is no issue. The incredible addition of ""this"" revenue stream would fund Tesla's green efforts immensely. A mobile phone with Tesla/Starlink ecosystem is the ticket. Musk should announce it."
Beware the bubble is about to pop !!
Mark my words.. This will end up RED today.....

"Even China know how good Tesla/maxwells battery’s are going to be. - China SDIC fund (which is state owned) tried to acquire Maxwell in 2017, as they wanted maxwells dry battery technology, and wanted to take it to China.... that was rejected. Then Tesla buys Maxwell and then they start building a factory in China! Coincidence?? I think not. China now wants Tesla and maxwells battery technology as they know how good it is. Tesla are and have been making so many moves behind the scenes..."
Nice rocket failure today. Crashed the entire market. Really bright idea adding to sp500.
Buy more shares!
"Let me say this one more time that why I believe Tesla is the next Apple and Amazon. The era of sole EV sales is coming (large market like India and China announced 100% ban of ICE by as early as 2030). Tesla is the leader (years ahead) in battery technology, battery management systems, self-driving tech (read data vs. other companies are still doing road tests), and is catching up on production rate (confirmed 5k production of battery last night). And most importantly, Tesla doesn't sell one single ICE car. Nor does it own one. When Nokia and Blackberry realized that smartphone might be the actual future, it's already too late. The executives in those companies had to come up with reasons to persuade their boards and shareholders that they might need to take huge losses to 1) close down the assembly line for their ""dumb"" phones (at a lost of course), and 2) steer the companies' resource to invent in their own smartphones, operating system, app store, etc. without a clear idea if their new products will actually sell (the answer we know now is no). After years of struggle, Nokia and Blackberry smartphone divisions (cash positive even after iPhone's release) were both sold to other companies. Same ideology can be applied to all other ""disruptive"" companies because they don't own any legacy production line and product. Amazon doesn't own one single physical bookstore, and Netflix doesn't own one single DVD store. They can pour ALL their resource into expansion (at a lost of course in the beginning) without being worried about cannibalism. Let's look at car manufacturing. All other ICE manufacturers will face the same brutal cost-spiking profit-shrinking process, aka giving up their ICE assembly line, building EV powertrain line, and ramp up EV production. They can't just magically close down all the assembly lines and switch to EV without losing huge. Given that they are all public trade company (like Nokia, Rim), this process won't be looking good on their balance sheet and to Wall St. Every EV they produce will cost them not only the cost of raw material and assembly line, but also the loss of ICE car sale (assuming that people will actually buy their car, look at Chevy bolt sales vs. Model 3). By that time, once again, it is already too late. Talk about the so-called ""competition"" all day long, but to me, there's no such thing. It's already over when Tesla first reached 2k model 3/week."
So here it is January 16th 2019. Does anyone know when and where the semi is going to be built at this year? They took a bunch of deposits supposedly for a semi that is supposed to be in production in 2019. I haven't heard anything about pretty much since the launch and follow up puff pieces about how many reservations they were getting for it. Will it be built this year? If so where at? Did anyone ever find out what the actual payload is if you opt for the 500 mile range version?

"ONCE THE TRUCK AND THE ROASTER PUT ON MARKET, TSLA WILL HIT 2,500/SHARE !!! HANG IN THERE."
"Musk &Tesla aren't just about cars, if it was things would be done very differently. Telsa has already planted the footprint of its main goal, turn the world away complete reliance on fossil fuels. Promotion of innovation by leading, it has released all patents. Understand in the free market if a company does not evolve they will go out of business.Now all the major car companies of the world are going electric and researching fuel cells among other alternative energies.Mr Trump has approved Musk's vision of the future, this was very important for investors who certainly were tentative going forward.Years from now investors will have passed by this moment. We will be living with in home battery charges useful for any scenario. Complete solar roofs as the roof membrane, more importantly these roofs will have similar or better life span than standard 30year asphalt shingles. An average roof cost home owners $5000-$8000 for standard grade. A contractor with all materials involved before labor pays roughly $1500-$3000. Just like Amazon to smaller vendors and all retailers. Home Depot to contractors, roof installers, countertop fabricators, and electrical product manufacturers. Tesla and Musk are going to dominate a variety of markets, Space X already has. No one had any idea what Amazon or Home Depot would turn into after 10years in business.We can expect Tesla which is much larger than simply cars to do the same.Oil does not have to be against clean energy. Oil is over-taxed and regulated, the U.S should be self sufficient from international oil. Most oil companies are owned by poorly run government monopolies, they can never compete on the same field as privately owned businesses. The people can always do anything better, more efficient than any government. Meanwhile power for electric cars are from power plants. Understand these same plants no matter the fuel source can always be controlled and will always be more efficient than a small vehicle burning energy. Tesla at $150 a share again... many investors should hope for the opportunity given by a stock market crash or bad news. In the future it will be well over double. Happy Trading All!"
"From ampproject.orgTesla Inc. stock and American depositary shares of Nio Inc. got price-target increases on Monday, with Wall Street emphasizing the electric-car makers’ tech-company side.B. of A. analysts raised their price target on Tesla TSLA stock to $900, from $500, praising Tesla’s fourth-quarter sales as “solid” and saying that the company’s $5 billion stock offering in December reinforces their view that it “will utilize its stock to raise low-cost equity capital to fund accelerated growth.”"
At the end of the day Tesla is still a leader. Every company will have their bumps along the road which is completely normal. Tesla is years ahead of other EVs and will forever be considered “the iPhone” of smart phones. Long and strong
"$TSLA short interest is $8.9bn; 39.31 mm shs shorted; 29.62% of float; 0.73% borrow fee. Shs shorted have increased by +564k, +1.45% over the last month, but decreased by -373k,-0.94%, over the last week. Shorts are down -$73mm in Sept."

TESLA is GAME OVER . ONLY DOWN FROM THIS POINT. TO MUCH COMPETITION !!
"According to last week's Barrons the value of Tesla is $1.25M per every car they ship. Value of GM is $9.5k per car they ship. Tesla P/E is 1,650 and GM 22. The other car manufacturers have similar valuations to GM. So even if Tesla took 100% of the auto market (every other car manufacturer went bankrupt) Tesla would be overpriced by a factor of 80."
Can’t understand why it’s trading at this level when VW made 12B and it’s only 87B market cap? I’m gonna buy the puts for this stock because it’s defies logic

I hear Amazon is a bargain at only $3200 a share!"
"Tesla released a video about the making of the 4680 battery cell. Interesting how the cover song in the video has a line about ""million miles"" and ""you give me a charge"". Great things will continue to come from Tesla in the coming days. Avoid the noise. The price will increase."

On the bright side the entire project is a complete financial disaster.They can't repay the $1.6 billion government guaranteed loans. Here's the best part ----> They have asked the government to give them a $563 million government grant to repay the government loans. This way the government can say the loan was repaid. PS: The cost of this abortion averages out to $11,000 per KwHr for unreliable solar power. PV panels would cost $2,500 per KwHr for unreliable power.

"I loved his response to the question about LIDAR. I barely followed it with my physics degree but he was clearly thinking in a first principles way about the problem..... and his thinking was 100% correct. Active photons (RADAR & LIDAR) should be at a significantly different wavelength than passive photons (cameras)More importantly, his approach is working towards the long goal of having the car drive based on real understanding of visual information. Since the driving environment is designed around giving visual feedback to human drivers. I thought the insight that LIDAR was a crutch, driving people to a local maximum of performance that they would have a hard time getting out of was very insightful on a number of levels."
"So why did Tesla cancel the promised Long Range lower priced Model Y? They can't make a profit selling it. Tesla's profit (wink, wink) margin is no where near what they are claiming. By counting warranty repairs as ""good will"" gestures, and omitting R&D cost s from margin calculations (as all other OEM's do), they have created this façade of their car division as being profitable. Apple would make a killing on iPhones (more than they do), if they designed themselves."

I believe it is a very positive motivation that will push ELON MUSK, keep pushing the envelope even sooner. Probably, $ 25,000 car will become real sooner than every thing. I guess early 2022 will be the year that TSLA will tear down the Japanese's car empire in the US. Prius, Camry, Accord, and Civic will face the real challenge that they never know before it exists.

a very serious question for Mr Musk.... the question is.... at what price target would the board of directors consider a stock split.... there are obvious reasons where a split would create a huge opportunity for the stock valuation... at $1000 a split of 10 for1 would put the stock at $100. The stock would appeal to a greater amount of investors and would keep the momentum at a sustained pace... never hurts to ask.. the seed has been planted...
"The Tesla stock fraud victims are learning a very old lesson about gambling on story stocks. Unfortunately, many of the cultists will lose every penny...and then some, as the stock inevitably sinks to the single digits."
Investors selling #tsla and #btc to buy more NIO! Nio is very close to 100$ in h1 2021
No one will choose a nio car over a Tesla or other brands like Audi Porsche bmw or Mercedes people will want high luxury quality cars not some poorly made Chinese car it’s even bad calling nio a luxury car it should’ve be referred to that $TSLA $NIO
"when the stock goes down people say "" This is going to 50 dollars "" when it goes up people say ""this is going to the moon ""if you are new here just don't listing to this dumb investors buy and hold this company is worth the buy"
"As we await Earnings, just something to ponder. Earnings estimates for Tesla average 1.00, roughly 850 million. Volkswagen AG annual net income for 2019 was $14.948B, 15 to 20 times higher while being about 1/10 of Tesla's market cap. Might I also add that VW, as of the 4th quarter of 2020, is the world leader in electric vehicles sales. They are also not facing class action lawsuits for batteries and FSD."

"So, after basically an admission of a design flaw, Felon's solution was to cover the tablet screen with a ...film??"
Man shorts.. you all need to try harder if you wanna fuel TSLA up harder ://///
goodmorning culties dont cry today

"Red, green, red, green lol.. I cant take this lol"
"Elon Musk is starting to sound more like Maxwell Smart........500,000 ....would you believe 420,000...... would you believe 360,000 ..... Tesla will be profitable from Q3 (2018) forward....would you believe from Q2(2019) forward Would you believe autonomous taxis & ride sharing would you believe Mars colonization.....would you believe???"
"I have extended my short exposure MASSIVLY.The bubble actually stops and we will see abutting never seen at WALLSTREET.Tesla to Produce 800 million cars?PE is often used as a realistic barometer of a companies value. With an auto producer that PE could be extended to cars produced. For example, Toyota produced 8.8 million cars last year to achieve earnings. Their PE is 9.21. This indicates that Toyota needs to produce 8.8 million cars times 9.21 years of earnings to meet market cap. This total is 81,480,000 vehicles.Tesla produced 500,000 cars last year. Their PE is 1,628 and this is not a fully diluted PE. Multiply the two and the total is 814 million cars. Fully diluted and this number nears 900 million. There is not enough raw material capacity to achieve this in the next 10 years. World auto production in 2019 was 91,786,861. Tesla, at their present margin ratios which would include the sale of regulatory credits, would need to sell every car in the world for 10 years to have a PE similar to Toyota. The Tesla market cap is absurd at best. Buy it now and you will pay a hefty price in the next few years."
Take a look at the Tesla's Balancesheet and look at the debt of the company. Both Long term and short term debts. Total comes to about 18 Billions. It is worth looking more deeper.
"4% up? 5%? after 21% decline from all time highs you can expect a bounce back, always. Dead cat bounce."

Its gonna be Legend wait for it ................dary. LEGENDARY
Hey! Tesla is NOT a car company. Understand?
"Only the first trading day of 2021 and my primary portfolio is up $28K thanks to Tesla. Go Telsa, Go Elon!"
$420 and beyond today..probably will close around $425 or so. Merry Christmas!!
"TSLA went up from 70 to 695 in 12 months. That discounts 50%+ growth for the next many many years. TSLA is ""stupidly expensive"" stock, way way ahead of itself."
Just loaded up another 25 shares let’s go
Last chance for morning discounts before we see a new high
"If there is no stimulus today, Monday will be a bloodbath."
Christmas bonus has arrived. Need to buy more.
"lol if Tesla missed earnings by that much and gets an upgrade, why did they give such a ""low"" target then? Or what would they have given if Tesla beat earnings? 2000? ORRRR Tesla dropped too fast for them to get out and they need it to go up and sell right below the target they just made up."
"900 is coming. Sorry shortie, u don’t even have a chance."
770 and makes 80 cents a quarter is not a recession proof stock
"From Barron's: One of the largest public pensions in the U.S. just disclosed substantial changes in its stock investments. The New York State Teachers’ Retirement System initiated a position in Tesla.... The pension bought 999,948 Tesla shares in the fourth quarter."
"When $TSLA is added to the S&P 500, index funds will be forced to buy $50Billion of its stocks. $800-$1000 by end of the year!"
I have gotten a lot of my friends on Robinhood! We are all making money!! Fed printing money no end to it!!! Get on and get rich!!
No such thing as the Impossible can't be done. As it already has been done in the future. Were just still stuck in the futures past.
Back to 900 this week
"wait until FSD wide release and media acknowledgement that Level 4 functionally here, or even that it's close. you ain't seen nothing yet."
"Unless Musk announces DEFINITIVE launch dates, for Semi and the truck (wink, wink), we may see $700 for a long time. No one takes FSD Level 5 seriously anymore, so it's a non-mover."
"Kenneth, you graduated with who knows how many degrees from MIT? According to you I've earned nothing but peerless degrees.....by your standards. Here's a clue, Einstein. I've worked all my life. I've earned more than you'll ever see. I have accomplished some degree in success in the auto business. But I do know I'll never begin to infringe on your world-class DUI charges. So bash me as much as you want. The simple fact is you're angry loser who thinks the world hasn't provided enough for him. It's MORE than just brains, Kenneth. You're living proof of the worst about education. Nothing you post can ever change it."
Are the index fund going to buy tsla shares on Monday?
Those 685 calls are being rolled into next week options. that’s good news￼
"Morgan Stanley got it right, except for the 379 price target."
I would rather swallow battery acid than take advice from TSLA shorts. If I'd listened to them I'd be flying a sign on the street corner instead of living in my condo and buying a brand new car I bought over the weekend with some of the funds I made off this name...I only took some out I still have a ton of money invested in TSLA. And will buy more if it dips below 700 again. I wouldn't even be able to afford a beaten up bike if I was short.
$NIO & $TSLA shareholders during a tech pull but the shorts try to scare veterans that were here when both companies were almost bankrupt in 2019.
I believe in Elon making cars than Tim Cook
"EXACTLY WHAT I SAID HE WOULD do. Read my post earlier. This announcement is nothing more then a CYA by the Board trying to keep from being sued. In that report they say "" they are pretty sure Elon once spoke to the Saudi's about going Private'. He needs to go to jail Period. There is literally nothing Musk has ever said about Tesla that has been true in regards to the business. Nothing. Pull the taxpayer funding now given the fact he may be a felon."
Moonish start to the day. Hopefully we'll do a few orbits.
We will see $675 mid morning maybe a dip mid day and a run to $700 by close. Just wanted to get this out so I can say I told you so on Monday Either way Tesla longs are gonna have a great Christmas THANK YOU ELON !
The 9 Best Casino Stocks To Buy Right Now For details https://youtu.be/Xfhg5IWr7hc
Had dinner in Boca Raton last night ..... parked about 200 feet from the restaurant counted 4 Tesla's on my way back . Leaving my space and a brand new Tesla was waiting for me to leave .......
"Keep an eye on the message board chatter from the Tesla cultists. It’ll start with, “This is a healthy correction.” And then, “The gap had to be filled before the next leg up to 1,000 a share.” Followed by, “This is a short attack, the stock is too cheap at 650, hang on to your shares.” Then, “I’m in it for the long term, thanks for the cheap shares at 500 shorts!” Next up, “Elon Musk just tweeted about opening Tesla stores on Mars! This should send the stock back up to 300 in a big hurry!” Coming up a few weeks later, “100 a share?!? This is absurd! The future Cybertruck spare parts business alone is worth that.” Until we get to the final post....”That’ll teach me to gamble on Robinhood. Now how am I going to pay my mom back?”"
"Telsa slowly melting back to 80$ a share. VW launched its ID3/ID4 EVs in China at a price 12.000$ lower than Tesla3, invests 86bn$ in EV R&D capacity over next 5 years. Tesla is only affordable to rich car buyer segment that switch from BMW or Audi - this segment is too small to justify a 800bn $ market cap. VW just posted profit of 12bn $ in 2020, and their market cap is 100bn $. Dont buy the nonsense about solar, energy storage etc - this is a commodity business. I sold all my tesla share and collected a nice profit. The party is over."
People tell me to diversify and do a little at a time I did. And yet I still come back to Tesla on every dip I buy more. As for diversification TESLA helped me find NIO and Cathy Wood those two leads lead me to a dozen other companies each and everyone of them has more than doubled. NIO has more that 10x’d for me. Even Bitcoin has or will double for me within the next day or so I owe Elon and Tesla a great deal ! Thank you Elon. Thank you Tesla
500+ viewing on a Sunday evening. WOW. Never even saw that with $TSLA Summer of Hype 2020. This will explode tomorrow!
What is wrong everyone!in 2 years max there will be 5mil electric cars on the market to choose from .do you think Tesla will sell duble in this competion...no wayIt will drop from 2000 PE ratio straigt to a 25PE ratio as every other stock on DJGeorge
"The whole world is buying Tesla. Only goes up. Will be at $3,000 this year"
"Bitcoin to $51,000 Tesla doubling its investment to 3 billion ! In 1 month !Bitcoin just paid for the India factory. Only in America ! Go Elon go !"
price is gonna tank after induction blah blah blah price is gonna tank just a bubble blah blah blah price is gonna tank steal u longs out of retirement blah blah blah. still waiting congrats my fellow longs
Dr Burry gave a 2 week head start on dumping Tesla. Share price will end up at $50 or less.
"Strange, after musk's does $15 billion stock offerings, he's shutting down Fremont for 3 weeks and not paying his minimum wage paid production workers a cent.Imagine what he does to thechildslave labor he has mining for him in theCongo."
"The stock price now is only valid for the stocks sold now, it does not represent the value of Tesla. No one would pay that much for the whole company. So next week the stock price could be 1000 or 100 depending on if mania continues or not. I dont own or short Tesla but if I did own I would sell all and go short now. Only a few will become very rich on this bubble and they are folliwing my advice. 90% of the so called longs will be looking at a blood red trading account forever. The peak price will never come back. Good luck!"
"I suspect many of the $1,000 reservations will find it very difficult to recover the refund. As time passes TSLA is becoming less and less solvent."
richest person on earth soon
Chance to load the boat!
IMPORTANT REMINDER for those who have not been paying attention to my posts the past several weeks....we will see $700 before we see $900 again....just in case you are looking for an entry point.

Pump is over and now this stock falls back to a more real level not fantasy land
So a company that is proud to say they are saving the earth is buying a product that by creating it is ruining the earth??
LETS GOOOO!
"Can someone tell me where the money is going to come from for the 2nd line for the model 3 next year, the new plant for the semi and all of the robots for that plant, the money to build a plant in China with lord only knows how many lines and robots, the plant for model Y and pickup truck and their robots? This is all in the next 1-2 years."
"California adds $1,500 incentive for new EVs, total state + fed incentives now up to $13.5K.Footnote: This does not apply to Tesla buyers."
The plunge will happen when you least expect it.
"do people know that Model 3, X, Y won't open the door when it has a malfunction on its electrical system?same thing from inside - you can't open a door if the system fails."
If this keeps dropping in value. It's going to be easier and easier to short because cheaper. just sayin.. tesla goes where the cult goes
tsla begin to make money because of China market?... $tsla $nio $xpev
"I’m tempted to buy more PUTs today instead of waiting just before March 1st in case something drops over this weekend. I was hoping for a slight pop into the 315 area before March 1st, but not looking as likely anymore."
Big boys are now offloading onto index funds at ATHs. :-)
Perhaps the reason we don’t know the Q3 release date is that they are preparing a Chapter 11 filing at same time?

"I hold both TSLA and MSFT. MSFT is up $3.35 or there abouts, perhaps the JEDI issue between Microsoft and Amazon may be wrapping, if the price movement up on Microsoft is an indication, it could be in Microsofts favor."
"345 time for another drop back to 280! Wash, rinse, repeat"
How many NIO sent cars in space? NONE!!!  $TSLA FTW!
"Musk pulls another rabbit out of his hat. When owners had to buy a whole new screen when the MMC failed in the screen, it wasn't possible to replace just the MMC. Not what Tesla has to pay for it, it becomes possible, it's magical."
TSLA still up $42 todayYou guys act like it’s down 200.
"Buy order at 680 hope it fills, never know with Tesla."
"Elon the Stoner? Not guilty until found stoned: ""The plaintiffs are also proposing subpoenas of rapper Azealia Banks, who alleged in Instagram posts that Musk was using drugs at the time, and various media outlets.""Buy more Tesla."
Down over $4 early
"LOL a ""leaked email from Tesla"". I'll give you 3 guesses who 'leaked' it and the first two don't count."
Do people think that tesla stock will go down this weekend due to nio day? Did other ev stocks go down on tesla day?
Is tesla a big dotcom bubble? 
"The drop from the prior high to the current price is not much of a drop at all. Given all the good news that's priced in, if Tesla gets a bad earnings, I expected the stock to get whacked. It did not get whacked. This unicorn stock will not sell off properly."
Don't let the shorts get in your head with the overvalued card. Look at CMG for heaven's sake.
My advice to bagholders is get when there is a dead cat bounce intraday or tomorrow. It’s going to get ugly next week. Will bring more tunes to remind you tomorrow. Peace out.
the absolute best investment I've ever made
VOLUME VERY LOW . NO BUYERS !!!!!
Sell your shares on 12/22 and thank me later. The S&P inclusion is the final move before big move down. I just sold all my TSLA at $646 so I hope it crashes now LOL
"If Tesla just announced the Model Y and took preorders, it would have been the Ponzi scheme continuing. That is not what happened, Tesla announced more layoffs (3 rounds in like nine months), price reductions (3rd reduction in 2019!!), and changed the target release of the 35k Model 3 weeks after earnings call. Say what you want $TSLA is done. If you own the car try to get the value out of it while you can."
Tesla has a p/e of 1223. Simply put anyone buying or owning this stock is paying $1223 dollars for every $1 dollar of profit next year. It's not a conspiracy it's exactly how it looks. Tesla is going to have a severe correction or crash but no one can say when exactly. But history ALWAYS shows the average investor get slaughtered in the sell off.
Can anyone tell me why Toyota has yet to produce a fully electric car ?????
"Not only TSLA is down, the whole market is in a big correction.I believe it will take one month or so till market get stabilized.I did close all my open positions and I will wait for a new good entry point, may be in April"
It ran out of steam. Imminent collapse
Tesla = tulips made of lithium.
"Long term investors, make sure your shares can not be borrowed by shorties. You can achieve that by entering a target price of $2,000"
This run is a deadly combination of Shorts covering and Longs buying calls irresponsibly. Ends in tears.
"TSLA really jumped since the Nov. 17 announcement that it would join the S&P 500. All momentum traders will be in by now. Who is left to buy? A couple of buying the dip people, perhaps. But major stops will be hit, and TSLA will likely not be continuing its stellar ascent. It has certainly broken the short term up-trendline from Nov. 17 today."
""" $TSLA told them they are not able to do repairs on any noises & vibrations that may occur in the car after first 12k miles after the title is issued. Such as interior squeaks and rattles even when the car is under its bumper to bumper warranty"
Wow tsla.....talk about risk management
"The Shorties need to stick with Nikola, Nio, Xpeng, Li, Fisker, Lucid, and all the ICE. Leave Tesla for the Educated Investors!!!!"
Looks like the EV Stock Selloff is done! Look for opportunities in Junior Miners who dropped big time over the last twp days. They will be going up at least 50% to recover. Tantalex resources for example - Lithium.
Expect a strong open and run to 830-840 before noon.
Lucky my hands are made of diamonds! Phew! Been a rough week but been there and done that many times! I look forward to the bulls run (stampede) that will follow. Good luck longs!
"You know Elon about make a statement to boost Tesla, with so much news surrounding the EV sector right now, he always has several cards up his sleeve."
We got a taste of the crash today. Just a taste.
I think the banks sell to each other in a circle and put the bets. Most people lose. Seems this way. Only rationale. The retail investors buy a few shares just because it rises.
"A stock that gains 5-10% daily without news is a bubble, no doubt."
i just can't understand in this age of instant communication that this thing is still trading?
Shorts bail...or buy some Calls...or something...
Musk is again messing up with US government by challenging the financial system- US dollar. People pay sale tax with bitcoins when buying Tesla EVs?
"Three big developments occurred between late yesterday and today that caused this recent 6% drop and continued after hours weakness.1) Late yesterday’s report that Musk exercised 175,000 stock options that were not due to expire in over 3 years leading to a lot of questions related to possible margin calls.2) This mornings rip by Adam Jonas, long time strong Tesla bull, in a special Morgan Stanley Tesla asset call stating that at this stage Tesla requires restructuring.3) Final and maybe biggest blow also this morning was by Consumer Reports stating that Tesla has nowhere near the level of autonomy capability that Musk claims it has."

I recently read that less than 1% of people looking to buy cars online are looking at electric cars... and thats just looking I am still bullish for the 10 year time frame but I do think investors are setting their expectations a bit high who knows
Not very long - and it will read again. 5 minutes? 10 ?

Wedbush raised its price target on Tesla to $715 from $560.
"let's see how long tesla can play the role of hero, pe of 1100, manufacturing issues on China and $4500 ev made by saic out selling tesla in china"
"Huge buy orders. 8 9 million shares at one time. Saudi Arabia in for 80 billion. Tesla losing 10 million a day for 3 years but going to be profitable starting Tuesday. Elon said so after posting largest loss in companies history . And of course, the deal is done and the only reason it is not 420 now is because it is a down market and a Friday."
"2020 was promised to be 1M vehicle and roboTaxis. It will barely be 0.5M with Musk selling last minute incentives on Twitter. Lexus, BMW and Mercedes all sell> 2.5M/ year. Demand is way down with quality issues, competition and new market exhaustion"
will get cut in half again
Tesla reached an all time high at 669.27
How bout that bounce!!!!!!
"People who say buy the dip should acknowledge the word ""dip"" isn't means 8% drop after like 1000% rise"
"Regarding Tesla investing in Crypto currency, how this will be viewed by regulators and investors? will it affect share price of Tesla?"
"Musk tweeted when it was way lower that it was overvalued while he continues to hype the company for a good reason. When the plane comes down the passengers and their relatives will scream in vain: ""I told you.""."

"The free market should not be regulated to favor other people. If it is regulated, there has to be a balance between buyers and sellers. If the market can be tweaked to favor and help hedge funds as it screw the little guys, clearly, we need regulations that makes sure there is a fair trade for every single investor. Little guys invest with the fear of risks. Hedge funds should have the same fear. Anyone taking risks should not be surprised when things dont go their way. We understand fundamentals, we understand there will be loser but also, we understand that we are being screwed by hedge funds all the time. There's a reason hedge funds can make billions. These billions don't come from nowhere. These billions come from the pockets of regulare people. $GME $AMC $IPOE $BBBY $NAKD $SNDL $BB $TSLA $NIO"
"Slowly overprice stock market taker are reducing. Sure funds who driving keep going higher but they also growing slower.Most know this is inflated, many even don't support view directly but supporting such cause indirectly by investing in ETF like ARKK which very very high risk."

"EV is substituting energy from oil to the grid. Has anyone calculated how much it would cost for the grid to support this? What materials will be used for renewables, nat gas, nuclear, and how long it will take? Thanks"

Tesla will be the next..... Tesla! There's been nothing like Tesla ever before. Always my favorite stock. Made me 200% returns this year.
GM thinks it can go from a bolt or a volt to a hummer ? Ford can only COPY the model Y and call it a Mach E and they need 2 -4 years to do it they are doomed
Does anyone know what impact short supply of semiconductor chips will have on Tesla? Other car companies are announcing short term factory shutdowns or fewer shifts.
Anyone hear Model 3 number one selling car in SWEEDEN that includes ICE cars. I heard this today have not found the article yet
"When the history of this massive all-asset bubble - and the Tesla stock fraud in particular - is written, people will wonder how investors, no matter how cultish, could fall for a lie like the Tesla Semi truck when any freshman physics or mechanical engineering major - or even a long haul trucker with a high school education - could explain in 5 minutes why it is completely impractical and unfeasible from every standpoint."
Can it over 700 today ?
ok only 0.8 eps thats is massive miss how did it happen?
that correction was in need to now pass 900$
TSLA buying Bitcoin was the top. A new generation on investors is going to learn that P/E's really matter. The tech stock bubble is bursting. History repeats.
"Isn't it about time for another split, issue some more shares, leak some e-mails, have a battery day, aa new car that runs on salt water.........something to get us higher??"
"For everyone clamoring about competition, in the last 3 years Netflix has seen countless streaming platforms unveiled to compete. Their stock price is 3x over that timeframe and they just had blow out earning. Why can’t other streaming platforms overtake Netflix? Why can’t other smart phone makers overtake the iPhone? Because they were first to market and have enormous lead and brand advantages. It will be no different with Tesla. Competition is a good thing. It will lead to widespread EV adoption. For which Tesla will benefit tremendously"
I can smell the 900$
"I bought in when the 5-1 split was announced, the stock price was $1,500 per share. Divide that 5 and I got in at $300 per share. Definitely a solid investment. I did the same last week with Amazon, still waiting on that split announcement."

Insiders are selling the tesla stock so I am out now from tesla. Elon Musk's younger brother sells $25.6 million Tesla shares..
"While Elon was tweeting and pumping “good news” in late December, his CTO, CFO, and Board Member were dumping shares above $335. A week later the shares are diwn 10 percent on a sales miss, declining demand, and price cuts It’s almost like he admits one thing to his FRIENDS, while saying quite anither thing to his FANS. Sorry “believers.” Elon isn’t out to enrich you, he’s out to take advantage of your “belief.”"
Why is Tesla jumping on a daily basis with such numbers? Looking to understand the rationale
My pretend short sale a few weeks ago at 625 is in the money!
"Tesla to Start Making Cars in India, Targeting Vast Market"
When tesla does the robotaxi event and they show you how the future cars navigate through intersections and go at blistering speeds at highways. Make sure you don’t drool
Do people realize that the stock price of Tesla is 3700 $
Tesla's core business is not profitable. Tesla's current cash reserves are less than the amount of stock it's sold since IPO. Tesla buys bitcoin... with cash received from stock sales.Is this a joke? This is a pyramid scheme wrapped in a pyramid scheme.
"We all knew and expected some volatility this week, so this is actually quite mild considering. It will be well worth the wait."
"Elon is still high over SN9. Screw model 2, cybertruck and semi. Delay delay delay! 800 by close"
"As a person newly into stock trading I purchased 24 shares and so far am up nearly $4,000 with Tesla... I like the company but I don't know if I'm strong enough to weather a big storm if the price dumps... this is a majority of my savings tied up into this... Advice on what I should do with this stock please?"
SEC will demand disclosure on reservations
this will bounce back!
THANKS TO ELON MUSK AND BAGHOLDERS. HOLD AND BUY THE DIP. I sold it for 895. so it doesn't matter if the stock becomes 69.420
Just beyond me how this stayed above 300.00 for so long.
"The only reason Nio has been going up has nothing to do with Nio day or that they are backed by the government in China, it all comes down to investors who can't afford Tesla at these prices, they want Tesla but can't afford to buy many Tesla shares at $800 its understandable. So, they buy Nio because from thie point of view its the next best thing, and in China it might very well be the next best thing. BUT, all Tesla has to do is offer a stock split of 10:1 or 15:1 and all of those Nio fan boys will jump ship right after the split due to FOMO... Nio would sink back to its $15 - $18 range and stay there until they start increasing production and such."
Tesla will be trading in range of <$100 share in 2022 lots of new compitation from New EV /FCEV company
3 capital raises in 1 year.........that's incredibly bad.

"My “friend” Rolexx earlier replied to my post that shorts are pompous and that he was still 12% up. That means his average buy in was at about $258. It also means when Tesla stood at just above $380 he was up 50% and was too “smart” to take the profit. Another example of drinking the Kool Aide and sticking with your pompous leader, setting aside all common logic about company financials, increased compition,"
"just like $TSLA shorts experienced in 2020, $BABA shorts will learn a nice surprise in 2021"
Collapse
Will #TSLA touch $750 today?
Averaged out at $850 and just jumped back in at $715. Good luck to all
It’s a normal correction. The market could fall further but don’t need to panic. Average down and you will be rewarded.
Another breakout!!! It never stops!! 650 coming!!! So much for JP!!
Ron Baron and Elon Musk would make a lovely couple
"Not sure how anyone could be shorting such a great story, with most innovative tech on earth. TSLA is down 20% from ATH with earnings a month away and Elon said sales are looking good. Yes TSLA is expensive by most measures but they are leaps beyond their competitors. Small comment by Elon yesterday - the smartest people/students in the world want to work for us and SpaceX. This why they are above the rest, smartest people are all there, very simple."
TESLA SALES GOING TO THE MOON THIS YEAR WITH NO PANDEMIC STAY LONG>>>FULL SELF DRIVE THIS YEAR
The real buying and short squeeze will start tomorrow after market open..
I'm amazed that investors have fallen The Boring Co. hype……..how can a one way tunnel underground be expected to relieve surface street congestion? Someone has said that it's only to be used by super wealthy willing to pay an outlandish fee to make the transit. I hope Elon doesn't expect taxpayers to subsidize the super wealthy like they've don with TSLA automobile buyers
getting ready for S&P 500.the offering is needed to get ready for DOW next year.
i put a market order in and it just keeps going up!! 620 630 640 650 660 no stopping this today.
"This is funny. musk isn't going to pay the workers when he shuts Fremont down for 3 weeks,... but if they want, they can ""volunteer"" to help with deliveries.Sounds like tesla is in serious financial trouble."
Hey guys let’s take a moment to realize how blessed we are to have money to buy Tesla stock and Bitcoin. There are those that currently have nothing over the holiday season. Let’s be greatful for each other and look for a prosperous year next year with Tesla. I wish all of you and your families a safe and happy holiday season.
"Once book value gets improved in the future due to business growth, it will look like undervalued."
"TSLA investors making the same mistake as Henry Ford in 1927—consumers will only ever need a Model T, and no competitor’s design will ever beat it—how did that turn out?"
"When to cover? During second spike pull back TSLA had 20% intraday drop(exclude extended hour) twice in short span. Sell off will be bigger cause it will over shoot to the downside on 3rd spike.Since Nasdaq is set for 6 to 10% sell off TSLA will easily reach $450 area. Bottom will happen most likely Wed AH (3% to 5% drop off of regular clos). Then I am going long for quick 25% bounce back.For the record, I shorted Wed pre market but my avg coast is around 675Good luck all. This is rare opportunity."
"See, if you longs can reason this out? Say, TSLA does manage to increase it's sales by 50% a year over the next 6 years. That would be truly impressive, especially after 2023 with all the competition from other car manufacturers. If share count doesn't change, that would suggest GAAP earnings in 2026 of $8/share. Again, that would be very impressive growth of 11 times 2020 earnings.That would put TSLA's earnings just about where GM's are expected to be in 2026 (which is only about 25% more than expected 2021 GM earnings). Yet, TSLA is trading at 15 the times of the price of GM.BTW, I am long GM. I ""expect"" that if GM performs as I project, it will be worth as much as $100/share in 2026. But, I wouldn't be willing to pay $100 per share for GM NOW.Can you see the problem we have with this? Yes, growth is good. 6 years of 50% per year would be possible only in the absence of any sort of significant competition. Maybe it's possible for 6 years. I think it's highly unlikely. But even then, with TSLA selling over 5 million cars per year at current vehicle prices, it would have to grow more than 10 times from that to justify the current stock price. (More likely it would have to sell more than 10 million per year if it is selling a $25k vehicle).This just doesn't seem like an expectation that a reasonable man could have. It's as if you have concluded that Elon Musk can walk on water (not frozen) and therefore TSLA is worth $1000/share, $5000/share, $15,000 per share or whatever.It just doesn't make any sense."
"If u compare tsla and nasdaq index, the chart is 100% similar"
So RH only allows you to buy one share. How do all you Robin Hood kids feel now. You better prey RH doesn’t go BK. If they do kiss your accounts and money goodbye. So happy I never opened up an account with that gong show platform.$GME $AMC $NIO $PSTH $AAPL $TSLA
I see it's down $10.Nice going longs. Way to support this HOGSTANK of a company.
"Just going to post here to inform.Elon Musk is the biggest con artist since the Jones massacre in Africa. He keeps feeding the public spiked cool aid. And, they are chugging it down. He took technology invented and shelved by a scientific genius called Tesla and is taking credit for putting it into an electric car. Elon has done nothing. He sends rockets in space like North Korea. He digs tunnels that will not be used except by human rats and he uses a pit of personal cash to manipulate the stock market. He pumps up Tesla stock and shorts others we will not mention.Problem is he is burning money and making non except what he can brain wash investors to give him. When the barrel empties there is going to be a lot of hunger and whining from the gullible people he has dipped into. The Chinese have set him up and all the auto companies have caught up and passed him. He produces one car. A sedan which will soon lose its luster of novelty. Be ware . Be wise. Be running from Musk"
Who shorted at 850 
"Right now Cathie is digesting the uncomfortable presentiment that maybe, just maybe, she was reckless rather than savvy, and this is never coming back...."
"gold going up due to bidens massive spending spree coming, ticker gold"
If you look at the options book expiring today... record number of calls above 850 and record number of puts below 840 were purchased by speculators. The big banks will keep the stock between 840 and 850 at closing to maximize their derivatives profits.
"Welcome Elon to Texas. I left CA for Texas 30 years ago and never look back. Texas has no income. Now I have several rental houses, 500 shares tsla, cost about 250 a share. Life is good in TX."
"Buy at close, another explosion tomorrow."
"If Fremont runs only one shift, why does Tesla need more Giga factories. Arethey going to work one week per month?"
Tsla's valuation is insane...and I though it was way overvalued before the split. Can't fight momentum until there isn't any left.
"SO one speculative company buys ""coins"" of another speculative company? LOL. Yeah I can't see how this ends well."
there will be more buying than selling today that's fo sho
(((( Capital expenditures in 2018 are projected to be slightly more than 2017 )))) <====== Hilarious and sad They spent $3.4 billion in 2017. They can't produce the Model 3. Interest rates are rising. I gotta buy some 2021 PUTS when they come out.
"Gordon Johnson, what a character. I’m shocked anyone is still giving him money."
Sold on Friday at $322. Feel like I dodged a bullet but this reaction is wildly overblown.

"Successful launch, satellite deployment, and landing today:https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1340298167720415232?s=20"
Elons' tweets are like a runaway train for shorts who live in denial!
i have never seen anything like this in my whole life
"Somebody asked why you can see all the impulses in the volume. Everyone can correct me, but my understanding is this. This is a ponzi they sell the shares to one another to drive the price up and the higher it goes the more they unload until there's nothing to unload.When a big guy unloads the price drops. The manipulators then rush in to bring it back up.The basic shares used to rotate around will be dumped in the end on the robinhooders. I'd call that the propeller and in the meantime they just drive the price up for themselves or other third party with which they have an arrangement. It might be Musk himself.I followed it a couple of days...and this is what I saw.Ideas? We can write an e-mail to the SEC afterwards."
ELON is doing nothing out of the ordinary. He has plenty of Model S & X to meet demand. Its a smart move to move resources to the Model S & Y lines....their bread and butter product....the S&X are a small part of their product mix...
Just saw on a general second hand site with classified adds how many second hand Tesla cars are currently for sale .I am speaking of at least 100 cars are for sale.Not a very good sign ???
"Since Tesla has already fullfilled all orders for Model 3 to Tesla employees, and current owners, shouldn't they at least update their reservation web-page?""Model 3 deliveries are beginning in the US based on whether you are an employee, if you own a Tesla and when you placed your reservation."" What, no budget for web page development/maintenance?"
Why is this down today?
Tesla movement is just getting started
HOLD! Rumor that TESLA got an upgrade. I'm trying to find out if that is true. heard it in another chat room.
Check out (http://Multistockalerts.com). They just mentioned TSLA in the daily newsletter.
"Funds are selling, retailers buying. Good luck retailers, you know something better tan the fund managers for sure!"
"“After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,” the company said in a tweet."
"FSD will be huge for TSLA earnings once solidified as a product this year. When FSD exceeds regulators expectations, it will be implemented. This will be the innovation breakthrough of the decade. Tesla’s cars are already driving themselves and continue to improve. It will take some time for people to adjust to robo taxis, because humans are inherently resistant to too much change at once. It will soon be a lot cheaper to hail a Tesla that can ride you to your destination, than it is to own your own car. Especially in major cities."
You look like a stock picking genius if you hold an Index Fund compared to this.
"Still a good earning report! Total Revenue Grew 46% year over year in Q4!!!! Name another business doing the same numbers in terms of total revenue as Tesla that's growing revenues as even close to Tesla at this rate??? I don't think you could find one!!!Btw, The Republican party is the party of Fascism!!!"

"This is eventually breaking $1000, be it you like it anot."
"Used car market crashing. How are those Tesla lease returns, with overinflated residual values working out?"
still way too many people interested in this stock on a daily basis....sign that it is overvalued
Almost 2 million shares bought in last 10 minutes!
Called it yesterday $800+
Time for another stock split which will double the market cap.
"Kathy Wood 2018: ""Our $4,000 price target assumes that Tesla evolves from a hardware manufacturer with 19% gross margins to a company generating most of its profits from Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS)""so here we are.... $4000 pre-split price target achieved........ and not only have they made $0.00 with the fiction that is ""MaaS""..... but they're tracking BELOW the BEAR case Kathy Wood presented during that time for even auto...so according to 2018 Kathy Wood.... Tesla should be valued at sub-$700 pre-split.... that'd be less than $150 a share today."
"I haven't seen a CEO run not walk away from a new model, the Why?, since the Edsel debuted. Musk's silence on that car is deafening, extraordinary really after all the pre reveal hype."
A beta of 2 or more for a 750bn company shows this is highly speculative company rather than a long term investment.
I don’t think millennials ever saw a crash or even a correction before:p Blackberry is my first and last scheme I invested in.
"Tesla's DieselgateThis is real and it is not a joke. When will Tesla do their loyal but deteriorating base right? Tesla claiming unsafe range. Range is suppose to be part of their MOAT. If it turns out to be true, look out. Al l the #$%$ about efficient drive train is over. All you will have is a car that is well built on the driver side and poorly built on the passenger side. See Sandy Munroe's latest video, it is hilarious. ?Under the guise of ?safety? and increasing the ?longevity? of the batteries of the Class Vehicles, Tesla fraudulently manipulated its software with the intent to avoid its duties and legal obligations to customers to fix, repair, or replace the batteries of the Class Vehicles, all of which Tesla knew were defective, yet failed to inform its customers of the defects,? wrote the lawsuit.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-battery/tesla-owner-lawsuit-claims-software-update-fraudulently-cut-battery-capacity-idUSKCN1UY2TW"
"VW delivered almost half as much EVs as Tesla in 2020 across 3 of its brands (Porsche, VW and Audi). 231,600 EVs out of 9.5 million cars. Yet its market cap is only 10% of Tesla's."
"It doesn't really matter if one or two whales like Cathie are buying these 2 days. Look at all the EV bubble stocks. Down HUGE. That shows you the market sentiment that the EV bubble is bursting. Once Cathie and her friends spend all their powder that they have, TSLA will tank, and will tank even HARDER when they sell."
IF FORD IS WORTH 46 BILLION THEN TESLA SHOULD BE TRADING AROUND $0.10
its confirmed: buffet is buying tesla. price to 1000 now for sure
Elon need to buy Btc with his treasury cash. THEN you’ll see stock price skyrocket!
"I am 27 years old and my fortune is over $25.6 M thanks to Tesla; and that is before next earnings of which I predict my fortune will exceed $200M. Here is my story although no one asked or even cares.My last job was flipping eggs and bacons at Denny's (minimum wage) where I worked for 12 years. I started investing in Tesla when they went public. In fact, I decided to stop renting my apartment and move into my car back then in order to save and invest in Tesla. And look at me now I am TESLANAIRE!!YES YES I'm always here in this forum in the afternoons so I can brag about it. And by the way, after next earnings as my fortune will exceed $200M, I'm planning to vacation in Mars then, anyone interested?"
"If Tesla becomes a major player in the auto market, a reasonable valuation will be $200B max. That's if everything goes well for Tesla."
Remember the anger on this board after the last 5 billion sold by Tesla? The price stagnated for a bit and now it rockets.

Together shorties <3
So how will the market response to this on Monday? Interesting they put out news on Saturday. Time to digest. They’ve done it before. Wish stock market was open 24/7 like Bitcoin.

Long Tesla
Anyone buying the dip will lose half their money.
Serious responses only please. Is there any chance this will come back to 710-720 range before 1/15?Thanks in advance.
Could Musk just flee the country ???
Cramer just praised Tesla/Elon
"Buck hold on to your shares, heard all this before. Ha ha ha ha . See you at $60. Like I’ve said many times, just another car company."

"There it goes, TSLA slipping again. Drip by drip, but it won't give it up all at once.Bag holders don't want to let it go. They can't believe their precious little stock is selling off."
"With Big Tech Companies Earning Reports coming this week, shorts took the profit and moved there but less they know that $BNGO $NNDM are consolidating and will soar  soon.Also there’s a lot of hype around $GME $AMC which ain’t good for people who tryna enter today or tomorrow.

"Why is Tesla DOWN  ???Well... a lot of ""somebody's"" want to buy Tesla stock at a much lower price.So ... as ""they"" own thousands of Tesla shares... ""they"" have a strategy plan of ""Selling"" Tesla shares... probably 5-10 or so.... at lower and lower prices, continually throughout the day.... and THEN... when they have driven down  the Share price to a profitable level..... ""they"" buy back hundreds (thousands) of shares from the ""scared"" Tesla shareholders who dumped their Stock !!!What a GREAT strategy...... that has been happening over, and over, and over for years and years !!!And it ALL begins AGAIN... on Monday."
"I am curious when the music stops, what is happening in the stack market is beyond the human concept. On average 4 million people lose jobs a month and $ 600 stimulus is going to heal the situation?"
"NIO ain’t TESLA. “Our mission is to shape a joyful lifestyle by offering premium smart electric vehicles and being the best user enterprise. NIO Inc. is a pioneer in China's premium electric vehicle market.” First off Tesla is an American company. NIO’s profits all go to its HQs in Shanghai. It’s not as diversified as Tesla by a large margin. NIO is competitive to Tesla in EVs partially because it gets unlimited financing by the Chinese Communist government. They use less costly labor. The government will pay to install their charging network. Their revenue will be be generated from EV related product and technology. NIO had no significant interest in renewable energy, solar, electric storage, space, tunneling, worldwide satellite internet, insurance or connecting the human brain to computers (all these are industry disrupting). Many think that any one or more of Elon Musk’s other enterprises could grow larger than BEV manufacturing."
Still 90% to go before reach fair value. And it’s 90% downward. :)
"OK, current status of the race:Tesla Market Cap 42.737B.Ford Market Cap 42.733B.Exciting, isn't it?"

LETS GOO $ZSAN  $CLSN $AMC
"Although I'm long-term bullish on Tesla, I'm not going to sit here and lose a good portion of my 120% gain. I had considered placing a trailing stop loss (just hadn't done it yet) but after today's activity, placed a stop limit at $805 earlier. If it doesn't go that low, we're good. If we see a correction and it sells at $805, I've proected a 101% gain. I can see it going lower so I'm happy. People lose a lot of money because of greed. I'm not going to be one of them."
"sell all oil stocks, buy all EV stocks (regardless of the price), buy the comeback from the CCP Virus (regardless of price) - what wisdom"
Tesla will never go lower
Coming soon....
How many companies have a year-over-year growth of 45.5% during the COVID like Tesla?
I am a tesla fan but a correction is coming before it can move higher next year.
do you think there will be serious stock ramifications from the fact that they underproduced M3s this quarter?
"Amazing that people would still bet against this stock. If you can't beat em, join em. I did back in the 400s. I was late to the game, but still a fantastic profit in short time. Who really thinks that this stock won't continue upward?"
Nobody with a solid argument has discussed the electrical grid. How will it handle 20-50 million cars charging up !?
"Today I completed my analysis of Tesla valuation for 2025. My model for the valuation includes car sales, robotaxi fleet, FSD sales, insurance, and Energy. My bear case forcast is that by EOY 2025, Tela MCAP will be somewhere between 2.5 to 3 Trillion $. This is based on very conservative estimates using P/E ratio of 20. (Current PE for Google or Apple for example is 36). That's roughly 4X the current valuation. I assumed 30% adoption of FSD by car owners and a robotaxi fleet of 2M cars. I believe a more realistic projection for 2025 would be roughly double that. Do your own DD."
They will close it at 698 because of options. Doesn't matter if you are long.
Its price is like the Niagara Falls today.
Tesla traded sideways for too many years until the market finally realized how innovative and disruptive this company is and will be!
Well I’m at 725 theres any hope don’t tell me he’s going down to 400
Selling - Huge risk owning this stock during Monday
This would not be a buyout. It would be a bailout.
"Regardless of whether this trends up or down, reality is going to set in and I highly doubt it will ever trade like it use to in the near future."
Dayummmm... Who bought at 890??? better average down today.
Germany cuts incentives === EV sales dropped 55% in January You can talk about casting machines as if Tesla knows something that no one else knows. But in the end Germany cut incentives and EV sales dropped 55%.

AMC!!!Just a reminder that a short squeeze isn't just a 1 day event. Look at GME.On January 12th it closed at 19.95. On Jan 13th it opened at 20.42 and closed at 31.40Jan 14th thru 20th closed at 39.xx area. Jan 21st 43.03 closing price.Jan 22nd 65.09!Jan 23rd-24th weekendJan 25th 76.79 close with a $159.18 high of day!!!Jan 26th close 147.98Jan27th close 347.51 with a $380 high of day!!!Jan 28th high $483.00Jan 29th high $413.98You see how many were tempted to sell the first few days and missed out on huge continuing gains in the days following. Do as you will but AMC if it breaks out can see huge gains. And the stronger everyone holds their shares ... the higher the share price can go just the same. Good luck all! It takes time for a squeeze and I believe tomorrow meetings will accelerate and get things underway finally.
So a company that looses money every year and needs to dilute and raise more money just to stay alive and this news makes the stock go up? What am I missing?
"Margin Adjustment increase volatility expected: Wedbush Securities, a clearing firm, is increasing the margin requirement for TSLA to 50% effectiveThursday, December 17thuntil further notice.

Accounts holding long and short positions in TSLA will have a required margin of 50% of the position’s market value."

"Who is still drinking the Kool-Aid? In the Netherlands, someone gave them a choice (e.g. VW), and then they switched. That's it. They were given a choice.

The VW ID4 is particularly nice and is available now.2021 will be the year of the correction for Tesla. Not A Merry Christmas For Tesla In The NetherlandsDec. 27, 2020 6:33 AMAnton WahlmanSummaryIn December 2019, Tesla sold a whopping 12,053 Model 3 units in the Netherlands. It was 13% of Tesla’s entire global automotive unit sales for the entire quarter.This year, as of December 24, Tesla is on track for a 60% decline in the Netherlands. Mind you, that’s a 60% decline in absolute numbers.Which is worse, the decline in absolute numbers or the loss of BEV market share? Tesla isn’t even leading the BEV sales charts in the Netherlands anymore.New competitive models from Volkswagen and Volvo/Polestar have now matched or overtaken Tesla in short order. Hyundai too.Tesla is increasing sales in China, but in places such as the Netherlands, it’s losing both market share and absolute numbers of unit sales. Competition in Europe is growing fast."

"What the short-sellers and skeptics don't understand is the mind of a tesla/bitcoin fanatic. It doesn't matter what the revenue is, or what earnings are. They simply don't care what the share price is. They will continue putting all their money into Tesla and Bitcoin, and will continue to purchase the overpriced cars."
"The volume sure has tried up recently, at least compared to recent weeks"
A little bounce just above $800/share. Will TSLA break through $800 today?
Michael Burry gave bagholders a 2 week head start on selling. The panic selling will increase exponentially and drag down the S&P. Big winner will be common sense investing and futon stores selling to all the Robin Hooders moving back in mom and dad's basement.

This is awesome all the haters are back and the stock and company still riding high! Love it.
Yahoo is so funny... I just saw $799 for AH price
lol Tesla is literally raising money through stocks to reduce prices on their cars. In a way that's like buying your own cars to increase sales. Next year they can issue 1% of their stock and sell cars for half the price and double sales. Through literally brute strength they will become the largest automaker. How can any company compete when Tesla literally has infinite funds?

"The departure of the highly respected and experienced quality production head from TSLA is indeed a big deal. The thing that really speaks to that is the fact that TSLA has not been up front on disclosing that to the public, it is a significant and material fact. Of course, when you add it to the already OBVIOUS multiple departures of the very smartest , best people from TSLA in recent week, months and the last year etc, it really reinforces the concept that justifies the drop in TSLA shares from the $300's to the present level. The real question is whether the valuation should be further reset by the market to a sub $200 level , as many in wall street feel is appropriate and on its way to happening, of should it linger in the current range. Clearly those who are calling for a big move up in TSLA shareprice from here are out of touch with reality. Smart executives , would not be leaving TSLA in droves, giving up stock option wealth because of leaving , if they did not know for a fact that TSLA would not be able to make those stock options make them richer...…….. Think about it...…………..."

"Financial stocks sold off on Monday, led by Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan, after a report that several global banks moved allegedly illicit funds over the past two decades.A new investigation by BuzzFeed and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists found banks’ internal compliance officers flagged a total of more than $2 trillion in transactions between 1999 and 2017 as possible money laundering or other criminal activity.The report cited confidential documents submitted by banks to the U.S. government.These leaked suspicious activity reports do not necessarily indicate wrongdoing, and they were just a tiny fraction of the reports filed with U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the news report said."
Real world test. QS solid state battery against tesla model 3-both reached 80% charge in 15 minutes-keep in mind this test was with only a level 3 charger and old li ion batteries. We are curious what the new cells will be capable of doing.
Keep printing the $$$ daily. Easy upgrade and going to $800 and beyond. Will not sell until $1000 or even $1500.
"The main issue with stock crashes is not the short positions. Is the last tranche of buyers who entered late in the party, and not being able to find new buyers to pass those shares to. Once the price is in a downward trajectory some investors start to exit positions and index trackers continue to adjust the positions.By the time the rest of shareholders realize the price will collapse, it is already too late to exit."
"Looks like all the pumpers worked hard this weekend to try to keep this thing inflated this morning. Maybe tomorrow, they can increase their targets again and keep hoping."
"Reading Elon's email to the staff regarding the 500,000 deliveries, it reads as though TSLA will meet the 500,000 goal, but Elon has to keep it vague and sound as though he is encouraging the staff to continue to work just as diligently. He can't officially announce it yet, plus he does not want to violate any regulations. Avoid the noise. The price will increase."

"From Seeking Alpha!Summary • Despite having less than 1% of global auto market share, Tesla's market cap is now greater than that of all non-Chinese automakers, combined. • Tesla is clearly priced for massive growth, yet half of its current products are aging and its development pipeline is sparse. • The Tesla Semi, new Roadster, and Cybertruck have all been unveiled; they are already facing significant competition from other automakers. • Even if Tesla's most ambitious assumptions were to play out as planned, it would not be enough to justify the current valuation. • Tesla is already seeing declining market share in the most mature EV markets; as this trend continues in 2021, the growth narrative will likely come under pressure.At present, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has just four electric vehicle models in active production: the Model S, the Model X, the Model 3, and the Model Y. The Model S and Model X, while extremely innovative at the time of their introduction, are now aging platforms in decline, leaving the Model 3 and Model Y to carry ever more of the load. While both have proven popular, their addressable market is finite, as evidenced by Tesla’s having had to resort repeatedly to price cuts to keep demand from ebbing throughout 2020, even in the supposedly near-limitless Chinese market.CEO Elon Musk has stated that Tesla aims to produce 20 million vehicles per year by 2030, far beyond the wildest peak annual demand projections for the Model 3 and Model Y, combined. To achieve its goal, Tesla will have to bring a host of new offerings to market over the course of the next decade. Yet the company has struggled of late to expand its product development pipeline. As I discussed in a recent article, the Tesla Semi, which has yet to enter production more than three years after it was unveiled, is one clear example of this issue."
"Model S is going into 6th year of production, without any significant design changes, other than different letters on the rear end, and filling a hole in the front grill. This old nag is getting a tad long in the tooth. And with all energies going into the Model 3, don't expect a refresh coming anytime soon."
"So yesterday I was at a mall in Denver and I drove right by a Tesla Charging Kiosk/Station, I was floored! Never had seen it before, so not sure how long it had been there, but it looked cool and there were 6 Tesla's sitting in it. Those car's looked sexy, especially the black one's with tinted windows. I own the stock and have done well with it, but now after seeing that and being in the market for a new car I am considering buying a Tesla. I was considering buying something this summer but maybe i will wait and get on the waiting list, this charging station is very close to my office so it would be cool to go get lunch with some coworkers and charge the car while we eat!I'm sold, you would be too if you saw what the station looked like, cool branding, filled with Tesla's, convenient location, the list goes on and on!"

TESLA GOING TO THE MOON TODAY BOYS. LAST WEEK WAS SO OVER SOLD. TESLA IS THE FUTURE. THE REST OF THE OLD AUTO COMPANIES WILL BA BANKRUPTED. STAY LONG BUY THIS DIP
"Can it be more obvious how haphazzardly $TSLA is being run?Cryptic tweets and a 3-day runup to pump a massive restructuring/price cut.When that falls flat, suddenly there’s a Model Y reveal.Funny this wasn’t mentioned Thursday!"
"So I was reading a post about how TESLA would have a 1 trillion in profit in a few years because they would be selling 20 million cars a year. First off if my math is correct one would need to make $50,000 profit per vehicle to make it to 1 trillion. At present if you figure the average cost of a vehicle is $80,000 and they were 30% profit that would lower profit to $24,000 per vehicle. In addition 20 million cars is more cars than sold in 2019 by 3 million so it would require not only completely cornering the market on vehicle sales but also would require a 20% increase in sales. Furthermore, how many of the autos sold cost $80,000? an average car is closer to $35,000 so that would substantially cut into your profits. I'm guessing $50-$100 billion in profit may be realistic at some point but it will take quite a while to scale to that as well. I like TESLA and Musk and I think they are moving in the right direction on things but at this price the stock is so far over value that I am afraid it is really going to hurt the company. Many of those who made it what it is will be so rich they wont need to be there any longer and if it comes crashing down many will leave with a horrible impression of the TESLA name."
"So, Should long term investors Sell TSLA right now or hold and more on the dip?"
Tesla did the correct thing in a large purchase of Bitcoin. The automotive side of Tesla will be left in the dust. EV manufactures are coming out of the woodwork. Melon Husk needs to find a new gig.
The drop will be catastrophic
"The bear case: TSLA is way overvalued due to traditional metrics like PE, price to sales, etc. Rebuttal: TSLA is not a value stock, it's a growth stock, and a hyper growth stock at that. Crowd behavior and growth dictate the fair price of TSLA, not traditional metrics like PE which are irrelevant. It's way ahead of the competition, its EVs are superior in quality and performance, and total addressable market has only been 2 percent tapped. In other words, monster growth is still very much the story for years to come....shorts think because it's below 800 that their dreams are coming true. TSLA down due to rising rates, nothing to do with the company itself. This is a dip to buy, not increase your short position. So enjoy your pocket change shorties...it will be swiftly taken away once the market finds its footing again and rates start to fall back to normal levels."
"Tesla is evaluating the possible development, design, and construction of an electric-vehicle manufacturing plant in Austin...

Worrying signs in the options market (if you're long). Huge number of deeply OTM $20 puts bought for March. Could be used for a gamma squeeze. Also lots of puts bought in the $500 range for profit when the squeeze happens. And a very large number of calls at 800 and 850 possibly for hedging for short selling shares.

I have and am in both, TSLA being the only stock I admitting have shorted in the past; no more. With PYPLs estimated value and record of earnings, I am miffed that it is not jumping. Investors need to stop comparing it to SQ and unhinge analysis fro Crypto movement. The run to $385 will commence again if Dems will stop tearing down the bricks that have held up economic confidence!"
Owning 1.2MM shares of this @ .0027 saved my portfolio from loss today since $TSLA didn't want to come out and play and $NIO is still blah.

Diablo Canyon, just one of California's plants produces 8.6% of total California generation and 23% of carbon-free generation. One plant 18,000 gwh of electricity. Solar panels? power walls?

"Some say Tesla loses money on its solar panel and BEV business. There’s a lot wrong with that assumption. One, that all those big TSLA “competitors” will be timely and successful. Every Tesla solar system (private, business, industry, government, nation, and utility size) sold niw ultimately supports the grid and BEVs of all brands. Tesla’s recharging network smokes all the others. If rated on how fast these other systems come into fruition and online in the past compared to Tesla’s accomplishments they are slow pokes. While their deciding (they’re years behind) to invest and actually build them Tesla will be ridiculously ahead. Elon Musk never wanted to be the only sustainable power generator. He’s wakened them all to get with the program. Henry Ford’s detractors said the same things about his fledgling Ford Motor Company. It took years for his mass production to kick in high gear. Gm, Ford and other large manufacturers do not launch rockets, dig tunnels, establish world wide internet satellite networks or build gigafactories. “Tesla Killer” is an oxymoron."

It seems as if John Thompson's comments (from Vilas Capital Management) are dragging the price down. Be weary of fund managers who can legally manipulate prices for their own pockets or their investors pockets'.

I don’t want this message to look like I’m hating on Tesla because I really don’t I think it 100% deserves to have the valuation it does but what annoys me about this stock is whenever anyone starts off in the stock market the first stock they buy is tsla and they are getting so good gains now I’m not jealous I feel like that’s going to be there expectation for every stock down the line look for an insane valuation on any company that has a some what of a good future
"Dude. What you are about to read may seem completely irrational. However, I consider it counter-intuitive. Long story short... We bought 5,000 shares of TSLA today and what we are proposing is that you buy 5,000 shares of BNGO in return. It's not a bad investment. Think about it."

"The setup for $NTNX reminds me of $TSLA at the end of last year.

That's why I keep adding to my $NTNX position even after the stock has risen 10% or more in a short amount of time. To be honest, that's something I had to learn over the years, but if you did that with Tesla you could have made a fortune and I believe the same is true with regards to NTNX."

I am day trader and I trade it depending on the trend but it has always amazed me that why someone would buy a stock which has no profits in sight in years and even if they make some then putting PE at par with other auto stocks it would be priced way below $100... Although, when it goes up, I don't care why, I buy calls (as I did when it went down to $180) and when it goes down I buy puts. My question is just my curiosity, nothing to do with it's a good or bad investment as it doesn't matter to me."

"This weekend as I was driving around town (I live in Philly) I noticed something new, a gas station that had a whole array of charging stations specifically for Tesla. I didn't have time to count them all as I noticed it as I was turning a corner, but there had to be at least 10. I see Tesla cars on the road all the time now, but this is the first time I ever saw dedicated charging stations specifically setup at a regular gas station. I think this is a good sign going forward. Tesla continues to grow."
"I’m assuming the stock price is declining just because Elon Musk decided to invest over a billion dollars into bitcoin and is planning on accepting it as payment as well. If your a $TSLA long this is actually good news because Elon is “Future proofing” his company. It’s a smart move and he’s a very intelligent leader, plus the company has billions in cash Rn and I’ll bet my own money on Elon any day. So this is a opportunity to get shares at a lower price for long positions, and maybe even shorts if they want to turn a profit cause I see this ending up at $1,000 or more by the end of the year"

One of the greatest investors of our time billionaire Ron Baron bought $385 million worth of TSLA between 2014 and 2016 which is now worth over $6.3 billion. He still refuses to sell a even single share of TSLA. Believes it has a 3x left in it. This man has $45 billion in assets under management and one of the best track records out there since 1982. But you guys here many of whom cannot put a proper sentence together surely know best.
"In the history of the markets there has never been a stock like Tesla. Never. I can not think of another company that has never made money, whose losses get bigger every 90 days, whose entire business model is based on tax credits and subsidies/government intervention and whose cEO is literally a nut case. Every metric, promise of forecast is always missed and missed badly. Now you have that same nutjob literally come out and commit an SEc violation 10 days after his largest loss in a quarter ever. However, at that meeting he says he will be cash flow positive and does not need cash-another blatant lie-and the stock rallies 50 points.......and then the Private Deal Tweet.If the SEC does not shut this scam down we have no markets. We have no rule of law and there is no such thing as efficient markets. We simply have moved another institution into the political theater that has consumed our education system, health care, and courts. If the Left can infect the markets with the same moral and ethical decay it has everything else to protect one of its heroes like Musk... it is soon all gone...... 5 billion dollars of cash burn in the last 12 months and not one financial metric met and he is still allowed to operate after that criminal tweet?"

"“They” keep asking. where is the Tesla $35K BEV? All car manufacturers make most of their quick money on new high end, heavily optioned models. Then as those get bought they build and offer the lower priced models. Tesla is doing the same thing. Their first cars, the Roadster, S,X, high optioned 3 and now the top end Y no matter the price sell fast. These high margin sales generate immediate revenue. As sales of these slow down they offer lower priced versions of them. They’re now selling base model 3s and Ys that are snapped up. Their margin is lowered but is made up with higher volume. That’s why Tesla says it’s smaller $25k BEV won’t come out for three years. They can’t produce enough Model 3s an Ys to met demand. So it would be unwise to make the cheaper versions yet. They need the high margin sales to self-finance the new gigafactories and build more Superchargers. It’ll be the same scenario with the cybertruck and Tesla semi."

"Bloomberg NewsTesla to Start Making Cars in India, Targeting Vast MarketBy Saritha RaiFebruary 14, 2021, 9:15 PM PST Updated on February 15, 2021, 2:47 AM PSTGovernment minister says automaker has picked southern stateElon Musk all but confirmed entry into India in JanuaryTesla to Start Making Cars in India.Tesla Inc. is said to be closing in on an agreement to make electric vehicles in India for the first time. Katrina Nicholas reports.Tesla Inc. is closing in on an agreement to make electric vehicles in India for the first time, opening up a new growth opportunity after setting up production in China.Tesla has picked Karnataka, a southern state whose capital is Bangalore, for its first plant, the state’s chief minister said over the weekend. The automaker has been negotiating with local officials for six months and is actively considering car assembly in the suburbs of Bangalore, people familiar with the matter said.Tesla didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment and did not confirm the minister’s statement.The company is conducting due diligence for office real estate in the region and plans to set up an R&D facility, said the people, asking not to be named because the matter is private. Tesla has focused on Bangalore because it’s shaping up to be a hub for electric vehicles and aerospace manufacturing talent, they said. Tesla has incorporated its Indian unit and registered offices in downtown Bangalore.Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk all but confirmed Tesla would enter India in January after months of speculation. The world’s richest man on Jan. 13 tweeted “as promised” in response to a report on a Tesla-focused blog that the automaker was in talks with several Indian states to open an office, showrooms, a research and development center -- and possibly a factory.That revelation sparked euphoria from locals, such as Nikhil Chaudhary, a 20-year-old student at the University of Delhi who helped start India’s Tesla fan club in 2019.Despite the hype, Tesla’s foray into India may well prove challenging. The country hasn’t yet rolled out the welcome mat for EVs like neighbor China, where Tesla set up its first factory outside of the U.S. and now dominates sales of premium EVs.EVs account for about 5% of China’s annual car sales, according to BloombergNEF, compared to less than 1% in India.“Considering the price of a Tesla, Elon Musk probably won’t be able to sell an EV to most of the population in emerging economies,” said Pedro Pacheco, a Munich-based senior research director at Gartner Inc. “However, looking at the size of the population and the potential for economic growth, Tesla will probably target a fast-growing group of affluent individuals that, in absolute terms, compares quite favorably to what we see in many developed countries.”Charging SpotsPalo Alto, California-based Tesla may also use any Indian factory as an export base, leveraging several markets at the same time, Pacheco said.The expensive cost of a Tesla is viewed as a sticking point by other market watchers, too. Mumbai-based Basudeb Banerjee, an analyst at Ambit Capital Pvt, noted that the “size of the luxury car market in India is minuscule with brands like BMW, Mercedes, Audi and Jaguar Land Rover accounting for just 30,000 to 50,000 sales annually.”And despite India’s broader potential, charging infrastructure remains another impediment to large-scale EV adoption.According to the International Energy Agency, around 60% of the world’s public slow- and fast-charging spots are in China. As Chinese carmakers roll out competitive EV models and develop a diverse ecosystem, the country is “heading toward disrupting the current global auto industry landscape,” UBS Group AG analysts wrote in a report last month.Tesla Hands Over First China-Built Cars to Employees in ShanghaiA Model 3 vehicle moves off an assembly line during a ceremony at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Shanghai, in December 2019. India has been making similar moves, but not yet on the same scale.In 2015, it launched a Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and EV (FAME) plan, with a 9 billion rupee ($123 million) commitment to subsidies that cover everything from electric tricycles to buses, according to the IEA. A second generation of the FAME program introduced in 2019 was larger, with 100 billion rupees to encourage EV purchases and build out charging infrastructure.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-15/tesla-to-start-making-cars-in-india-targeting-sprawling-market"
"Still say anyone that hasn’t driven a Tesla (or more so owned one) is uniformed of nature of this extraordinary vehicle. Many of their comments and projections are conjecture. Sure they have their flaws but they’re correctable. Name one legacy ICE conveyance that hasn’t had significant recalls (many of them safety related). Really do hope they get their act together as the planet needs more EVs. The biggies are mostly basing their current profits on powerful ICE pickups and SUVs.On the California I 405:“In peak traffic, vehicle speeds average just 14 miles per hour, making for commutes longer than 45 minutes in the northbound lanes.” May 6, 2019That’s a lot of stop and go. EVs don’t idle. In the past 2 years bought for my 2016 GMC Terrane....fan belt, oil, filters, spark plugs, coolant, additives, smog check, emission parts, sensors, brake parts, battery and tune up labor. Not looking forward to repairing the brakes, exhaust system and emissions components. Hopefully others will make competitive BEVs and give Tesla a run for its money."

"Investors Double Down on Stocks, Pushing Margin Debt to RecordSource: Dow Jones NewsBy Michael Wursthorn Bruce Burnworth used to clip coupons and look for deals before his investment in Tesla Inc. made him a millionaire.He is part of a widening class of affluent Americans who are doubling, or even tripling, down on this year's highflying stock market. The S&P 500 has soared 66% since bottoming in March in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, while dozens of individual stocks, like Tesla, have surged even higher.Some investors have been tempted to chase bigger gains -- and have exposed themselves to potentially devastating losses -- through riskier plays, such as concentrated positions, trading options and leveraged exchange-traded funds. Others are borrowing against their investment portfolios, pushing margin balances to the first record in more than two years, to buy even more stock.Mr. Burnworth, a civil engineer in Incline Village, Nev., who is nearing retirement age, is using all of those strategies after turning a roughly $23,000 options gamble on Tesla last year into a nearly $2 million windfall. His growing Tesla stake had enabled him to borrow against his position to convert Tesla options into shares that have soared sevenfold this year. He says he also helped his daughter buy a home and purchased a Tesla sport-utility vehicle for another family member."

"Of all the momentum plays why would you go with TSLA? They’re losing marketshare globally to competition, which is easily overtaking their EV growth. With no underlying substance, market momentum will only take shareprice so far. Q1 will disappoint."
"Tesla dropping prices because they would rather sell a $55,000 Model 3 for $50,000, than a $35,000 version, for, uhm, $35,000. Lack of demand will force Tesla to offer cheaper version earlier. Rut Roh."
"I suddenly realized why TSLA stock does not come down: retail investors are powerful. Just look at GME, so if retail investors do not want to sell TSLA, the stock will not come down much. I cannot believe it takes GME for me to realize that. So for a cult stock like TSLA, fundamental or technical analysis simply doesn't apply, all the people who believe in elon musk simply will not sell, and they will buy any dip."

"The $1.9 trillions so-called COVID relief"" bill is nothing more than a Pelosi payoff to special interests. Virtually none of it is going to actually help the economy or people in need. Instead, if is just evidence the swamp is alive and well."

"Everyone definitely has a different opinion about today. Because fundamentals are out the door, about the only thing left to trade on is emotion and there seems to be plenty of that around here.As I'm sure everyone knows, never panic and sell.

"Ok, I went for test drive of Model 3:For disclosure, I drive an Audi Q7, my wife an Audi TTS, my son a BMW M2, and my daughter a new Jeep Rubicon. So, I do know a few things about premium cars. First, my overall impression of the Model 3 was that it is a pretty decent car. Fast off the line, brakes very well, good visibility. I’m 6 feet tall, I found the lower seat to be a bit “ short” ( no pun intended) in that the edge of seat did not come to the underneath of my kneecap.. for shorter distances probably no issue but I could see long trips having my right leg tire from less support.i liked the regenerating aspect of the braking.. solid marks there.Tried the Autopilot on the highway. Wasn’t a big fan of it, but then again I have 12 second auto steer on my Q7 and I don’t use it. I did not like the fact that I had to divert my eyes off the road to the middle screen to see basic things like speed. A HUD for some basic things should be standard in a premium car. I found the screen to be fairly well laid out, but I question having all vehicle controls run through one system like that. If anything goes wrong with the screen, you are pooched in terms of driving. To me, that’s a bad design to have that much reliance on one screen.I hate the look of Aerowheels.. the car I drove was RWD and had the silver wheels. Much nicer look IMO.Fit and finish looked fine. I did not see any visible issues from my brief walk around of the test car.So, overall I found the acceleration and braking to be very good, and the car handled well at 120 km per hour on highway. A bit more wind noise than I am used to with Audi or BMW, but not horrible. The interior was well appointed but I think the seats could be better ( support wise). Being in Canada, the seats are heated, but steering wheel isn’t. That surprised me that they left that off. So I guess I would say I was pleasantly surprised at quality of this car from a driver perspective. Would I buy it? Hmmmm.,, probably not because I am concerned about viability of the business and it’s sustainable nature, but the car itself was above my expectations as a driver. I am used to be a bit more luxury features in a car of that price point, but the driving asiects of the car were goodI’ll post some more intel I found out about deliveries, discounts etc in another post"

Lol. Shorts are definitely contemplating the use of more effective drugs!!!!!!!
TSLA is only at the beginning of its growth potential. Elon the visionary innovator of the century. Smart investors will increase their wealth significantly holding long term. TSLA will most likely split few times the next few years. Stock price will possibly reach $1500- $2000 by summerThe TSLA train is leaving the station.

"TSLA finds itself in deep zhit! Thanks to the kid who's at the helm: they're running out of operating cash, so they'll soon need to finance by diluting ... probably at a heft discount. They'll need to raise between $3 billion-$4 billion! Probably they'll end up raising around $5 billion. And to settle with the SEC and all the Class Action lawsuits they're facing, will require a couple more Billion! So, all in all, they'll need to raise between $7 billion -- $8 billion soon! And that means about 16% dilution from current levels. So the pps will fall to around $220 -- $230 in due course. I've my Buy order at $225 GTC+ext hours. It will fill in a couple of months!"

"GM released 2020 results: GAAP earnings of $4.23/share. GM will invest $7 billion in EV's in 2021 alone. Just one of the competitors TSLA will have to deal with in the future. I expect TSLA will be able to grow rapidly in 2021 and 2022 because the competition will be limited. But by 2023, expect multiple competing models in every EV category. Profits margins will be narrow and missteps will be costly."

"Hello allI am new here and am a very armature investor. But! over the past year I have made great gains in my portfolio ,after watching it going no where. TESLA is one of my winners, held off on investing in them for years. I thought EV, who wants a quiet running car when they they can hear and love the growl of an ICE vehicle. Well, apparently many do. I strongly think they well grow rapidly as we all know they are much more than EV cars and trucks. I am long with TSLA but who knows may sell off some profit only should they go above 1k a share. Currently holding 350 share post split, started buy a few here a few back in May. I There may be a small pull back here and there but in the long , its going to be fully forward do to the tech they have that will be used outside the EV market as well. So many just don't get it that TSLA is tech, software and hardware. I do think it will split again in 2021 just for the fact of how ambitious Musk is and all the projects and dreams he has. Another split will give them the capital to fund those dreams and ideas and continue to grow in all directions.Have a great day and Happy New YearThat is all."

"Tesla investors cash reserves that are typically used for innovation or purchasing assets to better position the company in their industry i.e. EV right?

They forget that Tesla is not the only company, with good intentions for environment and humanity. There are companies with even better technologies in some areas than Tesla. Some of them are not forced to push their workers to their limits, because their technologies are way ahead of competitors. Time for a correction, time for some justice!"
JP MORGAN IS WRONG BABY

"Yeah 900 is around the corner, right?!!"
A lot of people dont understand that Tesla isnt about cars. The people who invested early know this and could possibly reap massive gains in 5-10 years. I just bought some shares yesterday even though people saying massively overvalued. I want to live in a world with EV cars and generating my own solar energy. The world has seen enough wars and chaos over fossil fuels. Investing in what I believe in. If something crazy happens and I lose all my money at least it was for something I believed in and not just a financial bet.
"Dear Disruption Deniers (I made that up and you'll be seeing it more), Please enlighten us long term investors (I mean cult followers) why Tesla would buy 100 acres next to the Shanghai Gigafactory.

Anyone on this board that believes the lies you spread will allow long term investors to pick more shares at a discount. I guess we should be thanking you.

Shorts its your call. I pumped all weekend. More pain being severed and as always we feel for you.

Shorts should cover.. it would be more expensive for them to do so starting next Monday!
Now musk will use the short seller attack on the share price as the excuse for BK. There's no secondary coming. you heard it here first.
"I think it is clear by the chart....that nobody has any idea what this is going to do from one minute to the next. That's my thesis here. Long term, it is still overvalued. But, some out there will clearly pay even more. And, it is not going to $0."
"Many young investors may not be aware... but there was an 85% NASDAQ correction after Y2K! That is right - NASDAQ lost 85% of it's value over a 2-1/2 year period and it took 11 years - 11 years to recover back up to 3800. Before that massive correction, the feeling was much like it is today - everyone thought they would get rich on stocks and not have to work ever again. No one believed the market could actually go down. Apple, Amazon, Microsoft - they all faceplanted. People would buy the dip over and over - all the way down - for 2-1/2 years - ha! (Hence the term catching the falling knife). Where did all the money go that people took out of the stock market? Real estate... between 2000 to 2006 there was a massive real estate run up...which of course led to the massive, sub-prime mortgage fiasco in 2006 which plunged the US into a deep, deep recession. But anyway, realistically any young investors today under the age of about 35 probably have no first hand recollection of those events so I thought I would throw it out there. It is possible for the stock markets to massively correct and go dead for 10 years. It is possible to see your massive next egg slowly diminish away, so if you have made a ton of money over the last 10 years you might want to consider not being greedy and putting all of it - or some of it - in safe, conservative investments. It would be a real bummer if you lose 50%-85% of your gains, slowly over the next 2 years."

"Tesla Stock dropped just before being included in S&P. I remember it was trading at 440 and went down to like 404. And then with the news of the S&P inclusion - it went up to 440 - basically recouped the dip. I figured that the S&P was already priced in but boy was I wrong. It went past 500 and then 600 and then zoomed up to 800. So, basically, who knows what will happen with this earnings announcement"
"AutoPilot ===== the bottomless money pit that Elon Musk created Tesla has ""invested"" (wasted) hundreds of millions on hardware installed on production cars hoping to sell the software once it works. Result: Tesla is losing money selling the $50,000+ Model 3s. Tesla will lose more money if they are forced to sell a $35,000 Model 3 and include the AP hardware.Note: The average transaction price for a mid size sedan is $25,865. Obviously the mainstream consumer is not buying $8,000 option packages."
Tesla is way overvalued; all other cars manufacturers are ramping up EVs. Tesla PE of 1501 is called a Bubble^Bubble.
"tesla is at 1200 p/e. Is that normal ? the stock will tank. there is not fundamental to sustain 1200 p.e stop buying based on future earning,it already hit its intrinsic value. Its a bubble. RUN before it bursts"
"Yo, Musk, is the stock slightly overvalued again?It musk be, going down like a burning Model S on autopilot."
"Tesla has hired Moelis and Lazard, reorganization lawyers. The same guys that worked on the SolarCity deal and valued SCTY at $14, despite Musk doing the con-job at $25.Tesla is going down..."
WOW Great stock Market Down! No Worries! Tesla Up!
"Just because some of you liberal, Millennials think EVs save the oceans, does not mean that the overwhelming majority of the population believes that fallacy. Most people would never buy an EV (some would buy a hybrid) That is why EVs are not profitable. There is not enough demand to get the retail price high enough for profit. The ONLY reason so many auto manufacturers put out new EV offerings is for the govt credits and tax deductions. The M3 was the worst idea Tesla ever had. The masses do not want an EV. As you will see in Q2 and Q3."

"The only negative I can find during this correction is margin debt is very high. 99% of all traders lose money, so I am hanging on. Rising interest rates are a positive as they indicate investors are fleeing bonds and buying stocks. I like $NNDM and $TSLA. NNDM because it has patent protection and therefore 0 competition. I wonder if NNDM will go into the new ARK space fund? It is required for making guidance systems. The recent direct offering at $12.80 is also a floor. Whoever bought that offering will also be buying in the open market below $12.80. I also like TSLA, but at $500, not $750. However the 200 dma is $450 and rising quickly, so I may be too pessimistic. I like TSLA because their competition is ICE manufactures, not other BEVs. There is a shortage of batteries. TSLA is also the leader in self driving. Self driving is all about data collection and artificial intelligence. TSLA collects 100 times more data than their nearest competitor. The profit margins on self driving are 90%. 25% of new TSLAs pay the $10k self driving fee up front. Other owners can add self driving as a subscription as the hardware is already built into the vehicle."

"Teslas market cap is just ridiculously exaggerated. If more and more competing products come onto market in the next few years, Tesla will give up befor they have actually achieved the turnaround. Historically, automotive companies have a PER of 10 to 20. And that should also apply to TSLA, because they have same cost structures and margins. In terms of market cap and numbers of shares, that would be 40-80 trillionprofit per year. Wake up! This will be the next ""Big Short"". Not today, maybe not tomorrow but sure in the next three years :-)"
Buy Long and Accumulate!!!! Woo Hoo
"I'm not short, I don't have put, I've absolutely no interest in TSLA, I like very much the company and I've a big respect for Elon Musk but the market cap of TSLA is an absolute non sens. TSLA is becoming the mother of all bubble. I think investors are mixing up profit margin of a car company with a software company. How many years TSLA has to sell cars to justify this price. Investors are thinking that TSLA will be the only EV car maker in the world, who's buying now will have a bad end."

The truth is the shorts have lost BILLIONS shorting Tesla.
When will this be $700?
Everyone is scrambling to buy last minute because next week it’s gonna reach 1k+
The recent dips are due to etade and td ameritrade and others change the margin percentages forcing shareholders to sell or put up more money to cover. This is forcing people to sell and will be temporarily. Sad that its the trading companies forcing the price down. So its not the one week close or bitcoin news but them messing with us to force us to sell. Once margin calls are cleared and covered this will go up.

The NYSTRS disclosed the trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.NYSTRS declined to comment on its investment changes. With $120.5 billion in net assets as of June 30, the pension says it is among the 10 largest U.S. public retirement funds.The pension bought 999,948 Tesla shares in the fourth quarter.

Newbies following Ms Wood. Cathie Wood will end up worse than Lehman. How much did Ark lose in past week's purchases?Many think this is a buying point. It proved to be wrong in the last month. Why is today better than Friday ? why is not better to buy when it hits 65 or 70?
Cutting prices to sell vehicles is a tell tell sign you are not as strong in the market place than you realize!Musk needs profitability without Government Subsity: China will not allow THEIR Vehicles to be undersold; doesn't bode well for the FUTURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Smart traders are selling. The high of the morning is 724. It did not hold. That’s a sign that this stock will fall in the 600s very very soon. Only amateurs are buying. The Nasdaq has 10 percent fall to happen

"“What people should absolutely have zero concern about, and I mean 0, is that Tesla will achieve a 10,000 unit production week by the end of next year (Model 3 / Fremont). I think people should really not have any concerns that we won’t reach that outcome from a production rate.” Elon R. Musk 2018."
tesla haters r the worst they talk wayyy to much i need to get back in this stock just waiting for a lil pull back or correction
Only 5 business days to go after today prior to the S&P inclusion date of 12/21. The countdown to the purchase of $166 billion of TSLA shares has begun. 275 million shares to be purchased. Wow! 800 is definitely within sight now.

"Throughout the years Schwab rated TSLA as "" D"" or "" F "" which means "" Sell "". Imagine if you followed their recommendation......"
"Have no idea (or the timing of) what TSLA or the stock market and economy in general will do in 2021 and beyond. But they will both eventually come off the highs as they always do for multiple reasons. But it seems prudent to now take out enough from a growing/successful portfolio to: pay down/off personal consumer debt, own free and clear as much real and personal property (Teslas...) that are useful (home improvements, cars, durable goods etc. ) and add to liquid savings as hedge against uncertainty. Be more conservative on discretionary spending for goods and services. Continually research/shop for “needs” and curtail/reevaluate the “wants”. Of course, everyone has different specific and diverse income/resources and wealth levels. Only debt to carry is continuing long term/low interest and deductible. The stock market can be a cash cow or a money pit. Over depending on it to consistently grow is dangerous territory to navigate. Personally wouldn’t sell one share of TSLA. All of this is free advice and may only be worth what you paid for it (nothing). But certainly it’s something to consider."

Well if he bought BTC with Tesla’s cash knowing every year Bitcon has been the best beat by far even only holding a year will raise Tesla’s gross profits no matter what and if numbers is all that matters then TSLA get now under 750 and hold for one year lol
Just checked and tesla now trending green. Ryan Brinkman of JP Morgan cuts target and the press trumpets Tesla in free fall. These two sources have totally mislead their naïve retail followers.
5 words from musk and this will go up a 1000 a share in 1 hour..... we are doing cell phones.......
It's real deal. 420 is a magic number.
Someone should ask about the Model Y. Where will they build it?

"Cramer gave a BIG HINT in the last line of his article. Did y’all pick up on it? —> Cramer knows PLUG POWER is going to “dominate” the LONG HAUL CLASS 8 TRUCK Market —> because GREEN HYDROGEN Fuel Cell FCEV Trucks will have the following advantages: LONGER RANGE, 5 to 6 TIMES FASTER REFUELING, and LOWER OPERATING COSTS!CEO Andy Marsh said PLUG POWER is going to “DOMINATE” the LONG HAUL TRUCK Market.

Analyst Colin Rusch of OPPENHEIMER says that the largest business of PLUG POWER a decade from now will be the “Green Hydrogen” Fuel Business, not the Hydrogen Fuel Cell hardware itself. Again, it’s the “recurring” revenues from fuel sales which are the hallmark of a GLOBAL ENERGY COMPANY. Question: Does $TSLA make money from fuel sales? I think not, but $PLUG will make a boatload on fuel sales —> and, again, it will be “recurring” revenues! :)There you have it folks... $PLUG is a sustainable CLEAN GREEN ENERGY BUSINESS. Is $TSLA really sustainable clean energy? (Fossil Fuels power the electric grid for BEV recharging). PLUG POWER is an ENERGY COMPANY entering into the LARGEST MARKETS in the entire world. Just last month, PLUG POWER closed TWO (2) Multi-Billion Dollar Deals within just 6 days! ... The massive expansion worldwide has begun! Folks, I would not want to be a Battery-Only BEV Truck Fleet Operator competing against a “Green Hydrogen” Fuel Cell powered Class 8 Truck Fleet.

Are big firms quietly exiting tsla? Looks like Saudi royal fund is exiting tsla
This recall is nothing compared to Toyota which has recalled 1.5 million cars this year alone. As for 150 k EV recall is only occurring on cars made between 2016-2018 which Their USB or memory card needs to be replaced so the backup monitor can work probably. An easy fix and fast. No big deal.

TESLA WILL SURPASS 750 THIS WEEK. CONGRATS TO LONGS. STAY LONG 2021 the BEST IS YET TO COME.
"Many on here are missing the point - the BTC purchase is bad because it exposes an attitude to risk that is unacceptable for a S&P 500 CEO, a propensity to gamble with shareholders' funds. Remember he only owns 20.7% of the company. BTC may well go up to a million dollars each (or not) but that doesn't make it an investment grade asset, it carries a massive financial and regulatory risk."
Congrats to those that bought that beautiful dip.
2000$ next month
Shorts are singing the same old song everyday - do not fight the tape! Ride the tape!

"Looks like $TSLA $TSLAQ is now stiffing the GOVERNMENT in addition to suppliers. A Certificate of Judgment was just filed against Tesla for failing to pay $650,464 plus $4,040 of interest to the Employment Security Division of the State of Nevada. This includes $211k from Q1!! That is one way to push out those pesky costs."

"2030 EV sales forecastDeloitteWith one eye firmly on progress so far, Deloitte has analysed the most recent indicators to develop an up-to-date prediction of the EV market for the next ten years. We know that BEVs already outperform PHEVs globally, and predict that by 2030, BEVs will likely account for 81 per cent (25.3 million) of all new EVs sold. By contrast, PHEV sales are expected to reach 5.8 million by 2030. A recovery from COVID-19 will see ICE vehicles return to growth, up to 2025 (81.7 million), then experience a decline in market penetration thereafter.Our global EV forecast is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years: Total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales (see figure 2). Annual car sales are unlikely to reach pre-COVID-19 levels until 2024. However, the pace of recovery is forecasted to be a result of a slowdown in ICE sales; EVs will continue to have a positive trajectory during the COVID-19 recovery period and may well end up capturing a disproportionate share of the market in the short term."
Not spending on core business but buying bitcoin?
"As my fellow believers of The Cause can imagine, there have been countless requests for my updated valuation model for Tesla. Note that the valuation excludes:1. THE ONE’s cure for the virus2. Tesaquila3. Mars travel and colonization including mega-cities and real estate development4. THE ONE’s submarine (which Pedo Guy tried to steal)5. The Boaring company6. The teleportation business7. The 10 million per year robotaxi business8. Among, many, many others!!!! (including solar, more on that later)I’ll keep it simple for stupid shortie:2 billion cars per year at $100,000 per car. Followers will buy a new car each year because 1) we need to support THE ONE’s campaign to amass assets on Earth so THE ONE can bring THE ONE’s message to Mars and beyond and 2) The cars will appreciate in value every year to point that a new car each year will effectively pay for itself!!! The margins on the cars will be 90%, yielding $180 trillion in Pure Free Cash Flow per Year (PFCFpY). At a very conservative 20x multiple, we achieve a value of $3.6 QUADRILLION!!!!!! Or $21.6 million per share!!!! Now, Roberta, before you go crazy, I’m NOT saying this happens all that soon. Will take at least 18 monthsNow for solar. Its value is infinite. Literally. The sun is infinite and so is THE ONE’s grace and selflessness!!!!!Haha Shortie!!!!!"

"The people/investors are blind. There is worldwide no real demand for EVs compared to the current demand of ICE cars – except maybe in China but the subsidies there are getting smaller and smaller tendencie zero anytime in the future. Ice cars still make the vast majority of sold cars worldwide. Vast majority of potential customers for any vehicle company don't even think about buying an EV from all the pains they get, when they even think about this possibility.Only $NIO s business plan main Target is it, to create with the outcome of the whole visionary NIO ecosystem the demand in exactly this – vast majority – people, with relieving all their pains and give them much more than any car producers currently giving them (lifestyle best service etc) instead of betraying some poor people with tin cans like other startups and old manufacturers do. Betraying poor people, who want to safe the world and are looking desperately for any ev car, with exploding and falling apart tin cans, no service, no change in lifestyle in exchange for more pains in using a car (Battery etc).Yes, only $NIO is the real revolution here. The unique revolution of the driving experience. We will safe the world with this around the corner movement. Time – especially in China with less subsidies – will outpoint that this is the truth. $Tsla = Zero sales in 2030 in China and maybe in the world.Good luck to all, I will camp forever in $NIO waiting for that to happen and with that waiting for the change in the perception of the masses, which will be followed from this told happenings above."

"Volkswagen made $10.7B after tax in 2020. Tesla lost $800m [minus regulatory credit]. Yet TSLA market cap is more than 6 times. Volkswagen EV sales will probably be very close to TSLA this year and will surpass next year. BTW did you see Audi e-tron GT? It looks much better than Taycan IMO. TSLA has to go down at least 80% from current level and yet will be super expensive.I know I know Tesla is ""not"" a car company - blah blah blah! It's a Bitcoin gambling company. On one hand it eats up energy credit, on the other it gambles with environmental disaster BTC."
this will go to $1000 by feb 1st.
Don’t listen analysts call. They did downgrade for biggies to load their boat. It happens for $TSLA $PLTR $NIO $DKNG $PINS lot to add here. They work for corporate not for us.

Funny how guys dont see writing on the wall
"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is seemingly preparing to enter the Indian electric car market this year. A couple of days ago, Reuters cited a government document to report that the American electric vehicle (EV) maker"
"The U.S. electric vehicle maker TESLA saw 1,619 registrations of its battery-electric vehicles in 18 key European markets in January this year, representing a market share of 3.5%, according to the report. This marks a decline from Tesla's 1,977 registrations in January 2020 and a market share of more than 5%."

I want to know does anyone actually spend the bitcoins they purchased on goods and services?
The company bought the Bitcoin (with board approval). Not Elon Musk. His 10 year compensation package is payable in stock options not cash. He (the major stock holder) now has 241 million shares (including options) of TSLA. He hasn’t sold any of that stock. If the stock goes down substantially for any reason he stands to lose a bunch more than $1.5 billion. On the other hand Jeff Bezos (for the last 2 decades) sells $1 billion of Amazon stock a year and puts it into Blue Origin Rockets. BO still hasn’t reached LEO. Be nice if he would of given Amazon investors that $1 billion a year in dividends.
"Wells Fargo came out with dire warning about TSLA on the top of downgrades by Jefferies, CFRA, New Street, Morgan Stanley (they say a bear case for TSLA can be made), and JP Morgan (target price $90)."

LOL Tesla's $270 million in net income last quarter was buoyed by its sale of $401 million in regulatory credits to other automakers.

Hawaii is currently proposing to eliminate gasoline taxes in favor of a mileage tax. People would be taxed based on the number of miles they drive each year. This proposal is in response to an increase of electric and hybrid vehicles.
I love the smell of Tesla crashing in the morning
Why would a CAR company speculate in crypto markets?! It does not matter if they are right or wrong about bitcoin price. They should not be focused on that. They should be focused on Investing their cash into their still money losing business if you exlude profits from regulatory credits.
"looking at the charts, metrics, insider trading... TSLA has finally topped. 600s are on the horizon."

"A $600B company (TSLA) is replacing a $6B company (AIV) in the S&P. That has to cause some other shifts. If it is weighted, wouldn't all the other companies need to be sold also to fit $596B more in market cap?? I don't know that much about how the s&p is weighted so it might be a stupid quesiton."

Tsla isn't a car company. It's addressable market is the entire planet. About 400t. By end of the year they should he at least getting 0.5% of that which is 2t. Hence stock price should be about 2500

"Honestly, EPS don’t mean anything, those numbers can be manipulated in so many ways. A growing company will always be spending more to ramp up facilities for expansion and many times the cash outlay is more because expansion is faster than anticipated.Need to look at sales, the forecast, the pipeline and the competition. This company is far ahead of the competition. Looked at the Ford EV, it was a dog. Porches EV doesn’t have the battery life and is $40k more. A Tesla with FSD will only get better"
"unfortunately tesla stocks are strongly tied to bitcoin and there is going to be a rally there, this is no time for short, even though tesla is one of the most overvalued companies in history,but thats why everything will colappse soonse or later,the amount of greed is beyond historical levels on both bulish and bearish sides"

"Folks. Let’s have a reality check. This has had a monstrous move. We need a few months of forming a base. Bouncing up and down for at 3 months would do it. Not sure but if this goes straight up to the old high, it probably would indicate a strong leg lower. Input from the chart experts would be appreciated. No sure if I should sell covered calls."

i've been watching TSLA trade for many years and I've never seen it trade as choppily as it is right now.
"Two ARK ETF, run by ETF star Cathie Wood sold over 500,000 shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares yesterday, as the prices of those ETFs were basically flat. Each is up well over 100% in the last year. ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE: ARKW) sold 460,102 Apple shares."
"It's time to buy the dip. P/E is now only 1250, what a great deal !"
"VERY IMPORTANT. Alrigh, let me be clear. Just went through their financial reports again as I own lots of shares. I am going to sell all of them because what I discovered in the reports didn't look very cool. first of all They reported 19 b of cash (correct as they raised ot from investors through dilution of the stock split, which is very bad for us investors) and the stock based compensations increased by 100% in 1 year, so as we are losing % interest in the company Elon is getting 100% increase in stock compensation because its stock rised to the sky again, BECAUSE OF US! Also net income decreased for Q4 as the revenues remained the same but the expensese increased, they decreased the purchases in solar system(very bad) Capital expenditure increased and return on equity only 3,85% (Horrible) I get that we tried to support his ideas, but the fact that he has to get rewarded in stock share because we the achieved the market price target while he is diluting our ownership is #$%$ Be careful with Tesla at this point. I am selling everything."
VW sales of ID3 looking like something is fishy extremely high volume of USED ID3’s out on the market just a few months after being sold. Hmm pieces of junk or dealerships forced to buy from VW the sell cheaper as a used model. Big sales push in Dec to make 2020 carbon quota ? ?? Hmmm that actually makes sense even if it’s dishonest it won’t be the first time VW HAS LIED about something. Deus gate anyone ?

"as GM Ford and VW bring tons of EVs in the coming years, TSLAs market share will shrink and so will its market cap."
Thanks so much for the big dip 
Bought more below 700. Feeling pretty good about this addition.

ARK won't be able to save Tesla every day. $600 next week.
Tesla loses. 16.00. A share. ? Is that possible?
short-term gain is 50% in my point opinion at $1000 by mid-year. I went in at $670 and I am very excited. You never want to buy at the top and savvy investors buy at the dip. Good luck everyone and let's ride this all together.
690 is today’s bottom. Buy buy buy!!!!
Looks like some of the $5B offering were sold yesterday and the rest of them would be sold by end of day today. I expect Tesla to announce the selling is complete in the next couple of days. Great time to buy on dips since I expect the stock to rebound nicely after this offering is done.

My average cost for TSLA is $ 52 and watched so many people predicting Tesla collapse. I smile
The higher this goes the better for me because PUTS are getting CHEAPER AND CHEAPER and everyone knows this is a BUBBLE. Not even the Tesla fanboys are denying that now 
"If you think that $TSLA's story is just an EV story, then you already lost. Of course Tesla saw the EV revolution coming over 10 YEARS AGO!! Legacy automakers are now doing something Tesla has been doing for over a decade.Tesla's additional, unsurmountable, stories are FSD, battery storage, and robotaxis. No way legacy automakers can catch up with that. They're barely trying to get on with their EV tech."
Holding my shares forever. We are going to dividends. Early investors $$$$$$$$$$$$.Think of Apple.
"Ford & Gm have a 7 PE and an 8 PE Tesla has a negative 35--so lets say Tesla sell 26,000 this qtr -instead of 25,000all that is is another 400 million in loses -which means a faster dilution rate of speed-even with model 3 coming up- thats another 7 billion cash raise-This is a no win situation -and to raise that 7 billion , they will have to raise that at a 150 per share offer -DOOOOMED- the 500 million credit line increase is already spent on trade in values- to prop up the trades-they borrow funds from inventory- out of last qtr they had over 9400 BBNS cars -thats over 40 % of what they built-BBNS stands for built but not sold-and that # is increasing BAD SIGN-they cant build them but not sell themOOOOOOOPS Flush this TURD-I Have been a Ford dealer over 27 years- the customers are all ready BORED with the X-Big deal model 3 -will be also produced at a loss- increased compation in 2017--Nissian- BMW cuts into lower line-DOOOOOOOOOMED"

People need to understand that Tesla is the biggest producer of batteries and Giga Berlin will be the biggest battery factory in the world!Tesla most probably will even sell to the competition just like Samsung is selling screens to Apple.TSLA is way ahead of everyone in most aspects.Now lets be clear they have a lot of work ahead the factories need to be build they need to increase quality control greatly and the future looks bright
"Thanks TSLA, broke half a mil today"
Anyone want to guess what time it goes below $300?
"Given total silence by #Chamath #ElonMusk (Except buddy talk with RH where he didn't ask why he keep changing story & at end can't control laugh because their scripted show go well.) including Elon Musk get away from Twitter at critical time of Spaceship launch.So what we as retail investor do.1.> avoid $TSLA . It is at $1T for 10% gross margin product sale. Which is almost 40 time revenue for such large company. Without their Tulip Credit sale (Which I don't know who buying given everyone have strong EV program and selling lot of cars) they would make loss. So booking profit and not going with them may turn out real wise move as well.2.> Avoid all chamath SPAQs totally. He and Elon work to gather to get people on board and inflate price that put othersie at advantage.3.> Prove them wrong by supporting game stop business. (Assuming Game stop take hard word to make sure they selling at right price and not taking advantage.)Their eCommerce going 303%, To compare Wayfair report 100% growth and stock go $24 at 52 week low to $300.Do this and we atleast not played by people like those who want to show off as supporter against establishment but when that can hurt their relationship with establishment and benefit they hide."
First step is to break 742.
"Ask any car dealership what their biggest obstacle in business is and the first thing they'll tell you is hiring qualified technicians. With ICE vehicles phasing out on the horizon, this brings a tremendous advantage to Tesla. Not only will they eat everyone's lunch but they will also steal all their technicians. Automotive mechanic repair is a dying art already and Tesla is taking advantage of this on large scale. They are recruiting ICE technicians and retraining them in technological advance EV repairs. Technicians across the U.S. understand that the ICE repair industry is changing fast and want a better future. Tesla has the upper hand here with more EV's on the road than anyone else, qualified techs are not going to wait for their employers to play catch up. This is one perspective many have not thought of, and unfortunately for other OEM's, its again a clear disadvantage!"
"Blood in the water and the inverse of engineering earnings.Most successful startup enterprises find a niche product or service to generate cash and build forward with more profitable items to add to their foundation. The 2/3's $ off m3, mass produced or not, verses selling an already eye watering cash losing S or X, is the perfect scheme to die quickly. Then you have the big show rig job. Starting up maybe only if billions more are hacked by dilution. 2018 is about the end of the line for the old pay book. The promise of building additional cool stuff as a financing tool to stay in business, not so much any more. Earn, as in earning good real money soon, pay down endless mind numbing runaway debt, or be gone.... Sayonara."

"German VW dealers failed to recommend the brand’s flagship electric car, the ID.3, to secret shoppers with a “suitable driving profile,” according to a new study by Greenpeace. Out of 50 dealers visited, only eight of them (16%) recommended the ID.3, and the percentage was even lower (4%) for customers who didn’t specifically mention they were considering the ID.3."
"So, if Tesla turns a profit of one cent for Q3, is it a victory for the yay sayers? What would a small Q3 profit really mean? What good is ""beating"" a self-imposed goal if it can't make a dent in the current financial scenario. In just 17 days, some 230 million dollars is to be repaid to the bond holders, and a few months later a whopping 960 million dollars. Let's see if the ""beat"" makes any difference. Be serious, fan club folks."
Even the company with less than 100 P/E having inventory build up problem you get 20% sell off right off the gate. But now now now...... What a mess...

Saw a few uncredited posts on other walls saying lawmakers will soon push for laws requiring all new vehicles must have some sort of early detection tech on them. Anyone heard this and what will that do for companies like Foresight?
How such price and price movement possible. Simple they using their money to buy then our 401k and pension to inflate while they slowly dump to either directly (Willingly) or indirectly (Forcefully) to own account.
"Elon is such a generous guy and here’s why; Elon diluted Tesla stock by selling 7.something million shares for $5billion for Tesla to use. Right?Elon as of late August owned 34 million shares of the stock, a stake equal to about 18% of the company, which is valued $68 billion.At that rate Elon forfeited 0.8% of his shares and as the biggest shareholder he personally lost $544million in order to rapidly expand Tesla. And help us investors out.Say what you want about the guy, he is a legend. Good luck and stay long!"
"Tesla makes nice cars, the company's fair value should be about $70 or about 70B, but if you factor in future growth in all products and services in a bull case, it might worth $140 or 150B. Just can't see how this is a $700 when projected revenue is between than $80B to $150B in five years."
Elon’s brother selling his stake last week looks pretty smart now. Sold over $8 billion worth when stock was over $800. And now has to pay taxes. I wonder why?

"I am surprised by the apparent wisdom which the market has shown regarding the bitcoin scam at TSLA. I thought the stock would be way up on the news. Instead, the stock has been sinking since opening on Monday.Possibly, though it's just an example of sell on the news as the bitcoin purchase announcement may have been widely anticipated by the big money funds."

"Bitcoin is ""not an investment"" at best it's a gamble, it has no intrinsic value other than as a service facilitator. It's worth what it's worth because of scarcity and popularity ( mostly VIA first mover status), but scarcity of ""what exactly"" .. are we talking about re: Bitcoin is not unique and is extremely carbon intensive. It's not gold ie. if the gold market crashes gold still holds technical intrinsic value in manufacturing and jewellery, whereas BITCOIN WOULD BE WORTH ZERO because there are plenty of other facilitating technologies based block chain technologies that work the same. TSLA buying block chain runs counter to TSLA zero carbon pledge and looks more like a hail Mary to shore up profits as regulatory credits fade."
"Sell the news and avoid taxes on Monday, this stock isn't going down today boys. No one is going to sell and everyone is trying to buy in anticipation for Monday"
"Well, got to be on both sides of the fence, even though logically and fundamentally, Tesla's value should be worth peanuts....Price action looks to go higher"
"The increased volume is another key point adding to the possibility that today was the start of a blow off top. It may go up a couple days, but the days are numbered if it keeps going at this rate. I think next week will be fun. I sold my Calls today and bought more Puts, but I may buy back my Calls on Monday if it keeps running. Either way, I am going to have my finger on the trigger...."
"Do you think ARKK ran the stock up from $650 to $750 and then just held, while it drops back down to $680? Do you think they will hold even more if it goes down further?(Just to help you along, Cathy stated quite clearly that they buy low and sell high many times). Her fund is at 10% and they probably trade around that number all the time (don't know how strict their operational restrictions are), but really. What happens if the stock tanks? I mean down to $400 or $300, or something resembling a crazy price (as opposed to a bat dung crazy price). Do you think they will happily buy more to save your portfolio?I can answer that question . . . No. ARKK nor others will soak up shares on a company that has lost momentum and has 1.1 billion shares outstanding and is losing money in their core business. The reason is, because they are smart investors. They are taking advantage of your emotional response to rising prices, and when you figure it out, they will wait for a 'great deal'. Like 1x sales, or maybe 2x sales or a return to growth.But hey, I'm old and maybe I don't get it.Guru."
"Took a ride in a friend's Tesla. He's part of the FSD beta. While it generally does well, it really choked in two instances: One was road construction with cones directing you into the oncoming lane, and the flow of traffic was being directed by a police officer. We could see his signaling, but it was confusing even to us. I don't see how FSD ever gets to understanding this - which makes me think the robotaxi business is a non-starter. The second situation where it got confused and required my friend to take over was on a highway where they had redirected the lanes (1/2 lane over) to make room at roadside for what looked like sewer work behind a barrier. The lane shift had new lines and somewhat stripped / scrapped old lines. FSD couldn't understand what was going on.I went into this with an open mind. And while system is impressive in 95% of road scenarios, it utterly fails in the last 5%. And this comports with what I've read - the last few percent of autonomous diving is 95% of the work.So in conclusion, I think you can cancel your robotaxi dreams."
Started to buy Tesla way back when at $38. $100 and $180 a share 1000 shares was easily a part of any well seasoned portfolio. And today with 5:1 split that’s 5000 shares.
