We can’t fathom a world without them.But yet when a couple of people decide to not drive a car correctly the dimwitted investors get all bent out of shape."
Tesla will be an also ran auto company once incumbents come out with an Armada of EV’s. The energy side narrative is BS and won’t make a dime
Anyone know how much Elon got paid for SNL? reason I am asking I got a Birthday party coming up and I need a clown to hire for kids. Can Elon make it? Also It's OK if Tesla shares down Elon can make money other ways like we seen and also from dogecoin and bitcoin ;)

Lol hello fatalities.We're one or two dead astronauts away from this whole ""Fanboyz blowing Elon"" narrative to completely breakdown.And then we have the ""Tesla doesn't advertise"" BS, they are PR experts, and PT Barnum Musk-rat will be exposed. Got popcorn and already up 10% on my Exxon stock, green transition is 2030 at best, 2040 more likely. And the keyboard you're about to flame me from is made of petroleum, as is EVERY SINGLE bit of plastic in Teslas and every other item you touch or use today. So oil ain't going away in your lifetime, nor will humans be on Mars - the bigger the LIE, the easier it is to dupe the Rubes......."
is that it???? we will stay around 550$ next few days!!! ever gonna be back to 800$?
your Mensa c.e.o. Just turned your stock portfolio into doggie poo. Might as well start buying polka-dots... Lol !!
Quickly forgotten is emissions credits are penalties paid by ICE vehicle manufacturers who insist on continuing to produce toxic emission products. They don’t have to pay them if they comply to regulations. Tesla management would be incompetent not to take advantage of this earned windfall.
"Looks like all the AIR will come out of the over bloated options tomorrow and both sides will lose lol. The stock needed to move $40+- either direction for options players to make money. They're all going to lose lol. Congrats to the Wall Street Market Makers, they clean up again haha."

Audi's new E-Tron make Tesla models look like Tin Lizzie...lol
"Anyone who has watched a Tesla with ""FSD"" in an urban environment can see why they won't be a profit generator. Even when not unsafe, it's just too slow. A FSD car will wait at a stop sign as long as any kind of traffic is in or approaching the intersection. It's too passive about letting the human drivers go first. Only if all vehicles were under the same computer control, would it be efficient.Cabbies are cheap labor and smart drivers. They take calculated risks to achieve speed including violating traffic laws were appropriate. This is frequently necessary in high traffic urban settings. An autonomous drive robotaxi would have to be virtually free to entice a traveler who wants to travel quickly away from a human driven vehicle. Full autonomy should be of most value on the limited access interstates where reaction time is important and the roadway is controlled. But this will not a significant market for taxis."
If Elon is smart he will Sell BTC today..
Great earnings report let’s go Tesla 
"With the amount of FUD on Tesla, this thing is priming to explode upward."
TSLA vs ZM vs PTONWhich will will crash more from its all time high by the end of the year by %.... go!
The volume is huge. Last push or new direction? I guess its the last push.

No lunch dip today
More bagholders being created. The numbers (bagholders) are going up. Shorts on TSLA are the new Doge.

"Tsla should not make a truck big mistake. Ford 150 sells the most in North America. Now ev. Sales over 50,000 in 24 hours"
Should be $500 by open.
I am 100 percent in Tesla. The next Apple
"So, nothing wrong with Tesla's earnings today - people that matter on this board understand this, need not waste my time pointing out the key ER points to those that will just blood let it - just look at it like this, Tesla can be likened to a good vitamin supplement - takes a little time for the effects to kick in - Opening bell tomorrow!!"
Tesla is a Growth Company with Elon Musk the brilliant think tank behind it all. I bought more shares today on the pullback........(Pause to Refresh). Think long term 3-5 years and you will make lots of $$$$$ for Sure...........
get ready to see 800 by tuesday
The train has left the station!
Someone said 900 AH?!
$GME is ON guys.... sell $TSLA and buy $GME
What do you think Elon is going to do? Sell and pay 20% or 43% taxes? Tesla going down to $600
ARK Innovation ETF sold 146'672 Tesla shares yesterday. Thank you for your transparancy!
"Elon said during the call, ""Tesla is now more like an AI and robotic company"""
" I BOUGHT TESLA WAY BACK YEARS AGO & SOLD AT $818. Months ago NOW I’m buying Fisker They will DOUBLE  YES, Double MY MONEY Tesla did me well; but the party is slowing"
"Article in Politico today about how Feds are doing everything possible to support US EV battery manufacturers so China does not control supply. This will only help TSLA (who is specifically mentioned). Great long term buy.""As China revs up battery production, Dem lawmakers see another Middle East nightmare"" (With subtitle) ""Washington is racing to help build batteries for cars and the electric grid, but the bipartisan “Buy American” rhetoric may not be enough to counter China’s lead."""
"TSLA present forward PE = 49 calculating from revenue, margins from last quarter. This is not projecting anything from Shanghai2, Berlin gigafactory and Texas gigafactory.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Sd-d4gQCA"
"""This crash likely damaged the car’s engine that caused it to catch fire."" Even the Chinese media need to catch up on latest technology."
"In this crazy market, stocks fall even though earnings are bangers so who knows what happens."
"Once you all sell Tesla stock, which stock would you buy that is increasing in value at the moment ?"
What do people expect when a company is built on hyped... you are still up over 600% in 2 years.
"Who cares about that woman standing on top of the Tesla Model 3 during. the exhibition in Shanghai making huge fuss? The rich Chinese who can afford an EV will prefer an American made. than the domestic made no matter what. They know their domestic EV like NIO may look luxurious and a lot hypes, but they do not believe in their reliability at all. They know they are just hypes. This will not hurt the orders of Tesla unless the government puts in new regulations to limit Tesla's business. there."
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
"Heading back down to $600 and will trade side ways from $600-$700 until next earnings. If next earnings is bad, this is sliding down to $500. This is good for day trading not long term unless you got in at a cheap price."
"I just must respond to FLAFA who keeps mindlessly posting Tesla's PR talking points:1. Tesla - 12 startup companies in one. Blah, blah, blah.. every car company has multiple revenue streams - car sales, service, warranties, financing, partnerships, parts, paints, etc. BMW makes everything from boats to wheelchairs. Honda makes motorcycles and jets. Hyundai makes trains, ships and subway cars. The list goes on. Tesla is not somehow unique for being a production ""conglomerate"".2. Tesla is in the energy market.... blah, blah, blah... so are 100 other companies, producing everything from dams, wind, solar, solar panels, roofs, batteries, oil, gas, blah, blah, blah. Highly competitive market.3. Solar roof not just panels. blah, blah, blah... .VERY EXPENSIVE... VERY, VERY, VERY expensive. Solar panels are cheaper to install, easier to replace and much, much cheaper to insure.4. Tesla home HVAC. blah, blah, blah... no shortage of HVAC companies whose solutions can plug right into conventional or renewable energy source. 5. Robotaxi - a concept at this time at most. We can't even seriously talk about this unti Telsa's on FSD stop crashing into stop vehicles at high speed.6. FSD. A $11,000+ option that even most Tesla car buyers can't afford. The subscription service is just the ""$1 bargin bin"" to find another way to sell something most buyers can't afford. On top of all that, again - it keeps crashing into things. Still a long way to go on this.7. 4 modern giga factories with more to come. This is actually Tesla's disadvantage - lack of manufacturing facilities. GM, VW, Toyota and other companies have way more facilities. As far as ""more to come"" - Tesla has the money but chose to put it into bitcoin rather than more gigafactories... so apparently at this time there is no need for more gigafactories.8. Multi year product road-map. Every successful company has 9. Best engineering work force in the world. Meh - totally subjective.10. Projected 50% growth for forseeable future. blah, blah, blah... maybe - but that is already priced into the stock.11. Profitable last 5 quarters. HA - only because of carbon credits and bitcoin.12. Strong product roadmap. This is just another way of saying they don't currently have an affordable car, or a truck. Personally I think an affordable sedan should have been placed before the semi and roadster. 13. Laser focused. Really?? I'll say that again, really??? Flamethrowers, bitcoin, hover jets for the roadster... a semi that is years behind schedule?14. Yes, Musk is a genius and a motivated, clever business person. Yes, Tesla is a good company with great products. But it's just blah, blah, blah to parrot back their talking points - all of which are currently why the company has an insane PE ratio. Everything, including the kitchen sink are priced in. Now it is time for Tesla to PERFORM - to make money on real products, not just carbon credits. Blah, blah, blah..."
"Almost 4 years ago, The Tesla Roadster was revealed, and they started taking $250K deposits for it's next-gen super car. Today, still no confirmed start of production. However, Tesla has confirmed a date for a sedan, the Model S Plaid +, which still has it's basic 10-year old design, that has near identical performance specs. Imagine if you used that $250K to buy TSLA, instead of giving Elon a free loan? Hint: TSLA was at $61.12 when the Roadster was revealed. Elon, go ahead an admit it. Roadster is dead. It'll only hurt your ego for a while..."
"E. Musk has po’d a great number of top level executives in the very sectors that support his endeavors. He’s about to realize he doesn’t walk on water as Tesla will see pushback with chip delays, manufacturing issues, ect. About to get that axx taxed and rightfully so. Should have stayed in his lane with his auto pilot."
750 coming soon
This is scary screw up.. how can a Tesla not sense a tree???? Autonomous driving taking steps back now
Tsla will go to 800.
Tesla is on Social security credits
Congrats longs and enjoy your well-deserved weekend!
Tesla had a great report Will be $ 800 soon. Just a pause to Refresh. Apple will sell off as well than come roaring back......hold and make money. i bought more shares today.
"let's be honest this is played out, every manufacturer has competition coming down the line, wish I followed my gut and got out yesterday this is going straight to $650 today anybody who has owned this stock for more than a day knows this. time to find a new sweetheart."
"Short term I’m bullish. The next year will be rough for $F because of this chip shortage. But after that? Ford is ahead of most automakers in EV technology, probably only behind $GM (debatable since they brought a new EV to market before GM) and $TSLA. Expect Ford to take market share from companies like Toyota, Hyundai, and Mazda once EVs become the only option 10 years down the road. All of these companies are behind on EV tech, meanwhile Honda is buying GM’s architecture."
"Credit Suisse analyst is forecasting 929,000 deliveries this year, up from 500,000 in 2020! TSLA’s $1.5 Billion Bitcoin Holdings has also increased in price dramatically since purchased. TSLA’s Earnings Report will definitely be a huge BLOWOUT which will catapult stock price to the moon, probably over $1,500 after Earnings Report and $40 Billion SHORTS covering and closing their options!!!!"
"At the end of the day people who bought Tesla products were the people who loved Tesla product because of its performance and value proposition - as long as it keeps delivering compelling products it will remain in its leadership position - the EV market is Tesla’s market to lose,"
Do you think will test again the level of 563?
"TSLA’s stock price was $2,213.40 in September, 2020 before split! TSLA will get there again!"
Tesla's ZEV diet is like the Keto diet. Not sustainable.
"Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) first-quarter earnings call will be on Monday, April 26, 2021, at 2:30 pm Pacific Time or 5:30 pm Eastern Time."
"Why is Tesla down -5% this year, 2021 isnt the same story as 2020"
"Hey elon fans and longs...I've hit you fairly hard today with facts but I have even more evidence.elon is in this to enrich himself. Make no mistake about that. I and other have said that multiple times here.In the news today we learned that ""quarterly report on Monday hit targets qualifying Chief Executive Elon Musk for two options payouts worth a combined $11 billion.""And you guys are the enablers.In the end, you'll all be in the same bucket labeled ""BAGHOLDERS""."
"The big question is if $1.58 billion in Regulatory Credits in 2020 turned into $0.7 billion of GAAP earnings, then how much will the Regulatory Credits be in 2021 when many auto makers are making their own EVs?"
"On Tesla's Model S order page, when you switch from Long Range ($79,900), to Plaid ($119,900), to Plaid + ($149,990), the car image shown does not change. Either these cars will all look exactly alike, despite a $80K difference in MSRP, or Tesla has the most anemic website in the industry. Delivery has been pushed back to mid-2022...., sumpin' ain't adding up."
Cryptos are down. #DOGE Chill. Wait for $FB to announce the news! $BTC $TSLA
Just forget about TESLA and come to $NIO. Cut your losses now. NIO is super cheap now and it will be TESLA 2.0.
BIG Upgrade! Stock going to $1000 this year! Buying more !
-150mil earnings if you dont count btc gain + credit
Rumor going around Reddit boards that they are going to try and short squeeze bury!
https://news.wallstreetlab.io/2021/05/13/tesla-no-longer-plans-to-accept-payment-in-bitcoin/
"The police works slow. If you want news as to whom is to blame, then you will need to wait months and by then tesla would be $1000 already lol"
"I know the un-realist bulls don't want to hear this, but if it turns out that TSLA is just a car company prone to the same law of physics and accountability as all other car companies, then this bubble era unicorn may trend lower for years until reaching a reasonable valuation. To be honest, you would be better off hoping for a broad based 50% market crash so you get the Fed to step in and flood the market with liquidity to try and re-pump the bubble. A slow steady return to reality is your worst nightmare. STRONG SELL!!"
$595 close ?
Only 7 whole business days left ... real short squeeze is coming!
"""Tesla stock is rallying again. That’s no surprise, though. It always seems to rally ahead of earnings. What happens after earnings isn’t as good news for investors, however."" - Barons 4/15/21. This has been my my shorting strategy for YEARS. Mock all you want, but TSLA run-ups are a REQUIREMENT. So why not ride both waves, long and short? Owning TSLA is TOO risky, imo. A rapid collapse is inevitable. Keep buying / pumping, my little darling credulous unintentional co-conspirators."
"Tesla reports great earning, and as always, the shorts pull back and the stock sinks. It’s the only stock I watch that always moves in opposite direction."
"From 2012 – 2018, there has been approximately one Tesla vehicle fire for every 170 million miles traveled. By comparison, data from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and U.S. Department of Transportation shows that in the United States there is a vehicle fire for every 19 million miles traveled."
"many bitcoin holders are abandoning TSLA ship. I know a lot of people are canceling their orders. I was considering Model Y myself, but no longer.Alon is a huge liability for TSLA stocks."
"it is predicted that there will be a shortage of lithium between 2021 and 2023very light in atomic weight, lithium is less common in the Solar System than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements."
First trade for me on 5/13 is to sell all of my TSLA.
It’s not a blood bath today but still need a band aid . Eventually we won’t need anything because there will be no blood left to drain .
Anyone we that awesome futuristic underground Tesla transport system in Vegas?
I’m Elon. Hi!
"It appears the collapse of the TSLA bubble is now inevitably spiraling downward, and the new catalyst (rarely mentioned for some reason) to watch closely now is the expiration of the huge volumes of OTM call options (which become more numerous and further out of the money as the price drops) which will allow market makers to gradually unload their stockpiled shares, putting a very steady downward pull on the stock price over the next several months. Don't underestimate this effect - it will feel like gravity has been turned back on."
Who don’t buy Tesla today- will regret on Monday! Flying up
"Lucid talking about the $25,000 ... copying Tesla ‘s businesss plan . The shorts must get out more and see what people are driving these days"
Today we bounce up
"The same Elon Musk/Tesla dissenting doomsday voices are still out there after a decade of misdirection. They’re continually reliving TSLA’ supposed over-evaluation , apparent weak financial fundamentals, questionable demand scenario and it’s inordinate “cash burn”. The CEO’s tweetyness, missed projections and the disbelief of his altruistic motives to help humanity and the planet. They predict a TSLA death nell by an overtaking competition. Meantime every ICE vehicle built is another nail in the legacies coffin and an anti-environmental statement. Of course, new brands of technology will kick in, reactionary huge investment pledged and the legacies ramping mass production of their version of BEVs. Startups will fill in any voids. Market share, autonomy flavors, battery power, safety and performance attributes will bounce around as always. In this scenario everyone will win."
Can we agree shorting Tesla isn’t easy? Making money shorting Tesla is almost impossible to profit from. Best of luck getting out tomorrow.
analysts forget the bitcoin profits-tesla bought bitcoin well under 40k/shr. It's now near 50% up. That's 750m in bitcoin profits for the quarter alone.
No Worries Great buy price! love it!
next three targets 737-760-785
$780 price target!
Shorting Tesla and dogecoin to the ground!!!!
Tesla is going to be like Microsoft. Many sources of large revenue!!
Elon buying more shares
"Unfortunely Devastating bad NEWS for $TSLA. The huge NIO deal with Sinopec. Google Tsla Sinopec. And the even worse news is, NIO is planing 100 more of those deals within the next 8 months.Tsla shareholders right now are thinking that ""Tsla is eating NIos lunch"" but NIO is eating the ground Tsla is standing on in China, slowly but steadily.Google the story of Uber Didi Chuxing.This is what will happen to Tsla in China through NIOs hands.This news is extremely bad for Tsla, I, Ninjaswinga from Dankshire Hathaway, am giving tsla 5 years to decide if they accept NIOs domination in case of Battery solutions or to leave china with their stone age battery approach.Apple and then Elon washed everyones brains, swapable batteries are the best."
"I guess Wall Street does not like Musk. Out of the big 4. Amzn has gained 90 points over the last 2 trading sessions without earnings report. Google just popped 100 points after earnings. FB has touched the highest point ever. TSLA is still struggling since Jan. What happened to our 1000 target price? The most ridiculous of all, TSLA beat estimate. Billions in revenue. Yet Street said it is not good enough."
I know this comment probably won’t make any difference but I do want to spread the awareness.. over the pass months shorts have been spreading false information about Tesla to cause fear to bring the price down which they have been doing for a very long time now .. the short interest has gone up a lot this month itself . They want you to SELL . DO NOT . JUST HOLD. We are in the process of creating a beautiful short squeeze
Back to $750 tomorrow! Just bought in :)
Be a good baggie and hold your bag tight now
"I am a highly educated person who has been right every single time when I predict something is going to happen, and right now I am predicting that this month the market is going to get kicked in the bawls 15-20% over the course of about 3 weeks, the first few days of that being the most fiercely vicious of course. The good news is this will provide excellent buying opportunities and option plays, plus it'll end up annihilating all the main street retail yahoos who of course came late to the party and are all now ""warren buffett's"" in their own minds. Also factor in that millennials are relatively new to the investing world in which they are now neck deep in, and they have not yet had ""their 1987"", but of course every generation gets ""their's"". I believe May 2021 is going to be a harsh month for the markets hehe, and I hope so too. Weeeeeeee!Thanks."
Too much competition
way to $300s and under ;)
"I'm no EV apologist. It is a wildly silly business solution to a fascinating technological problem. However, driving to Austn airport at 5am recently, there were cars and trucks 3miles backedup in every direction to build the plants. Tsla has several of these being built at the moment. The balance sheet and earnings are going to look unrealistic until this build out concludes. Tsla realistically in 3 years is worth 5x what it is now. And I am neck deep in oil right now. Without oil, we live in the stone age people."
"Anyone wonder without Bitcoin and without the new Model X, and without the CyberTruck...and with the new Model S barely rolling out, and with the chip shortage and slump in Chinese demand... what Q2 earnings will look like? Ha ha ha ha!"
This has been a easy stock to short keep up the good work Elon
Turning around 
Even Baillie Gifford have sold $TSLA and is buying more $NIO
I'll bet TSLA shareholders are totally ecstatic that Elon's side jobs are working out so well for him. (Seems like his multi-tasking skills may not be as phenomenal as once claimed)
$666 - LOL
The stock of stocks 
The Fed bailing out the casinos and all Ponzi schemes - so why not this cripto company?
"""Tesla tells regulator that full self-driving cars may not be achieved by year-end"". The truth is it will never achieve FSD with current hardwares."
could Tesla and Cathie Wood's bring each other down? I see how it could happen.
huge call blocks bought on tesla from 780 to 800 today & past few days
Just wait for a big headge fund or institutions to get busted and we are going to see the start of the work stock market crash ever in human history.
"FYI Elon Musk shorted TSLA himself. He used billions of dollars in cash to buy Bitcoin and other cryptos. Instead of investing in his company or buying back shares. But you held long, for what? You think Elon Musk is going to take you to Mars? No. He just doesn't want to pay taxes and he wants YOU take on the risks as he pumps and dumps cryptos."
Great start to securing a 4th consecutive week of ending red.
"The biggest risk to this market is Tesla and Elon. Overvalued stock tangled with speculative vehicle and lead by unstable man, what could go wrong?"
Prediction: TSLA will end the week below $660. Today is a good opportunity for longs to reduce risk. I don't do short term bets.
the big 720 today?
Those telling to sell just tell them to take a look at $TSLA reactions. 43297 New Reactions. Is there any other stock with such a following?
"You know Elon will do everything in his power to hit 1,000,000 deliveries in 2021. That's a mighty high bragging right...., 100% increase in one year. Unparalleled, for a mature company with this high of volume. Easy for a start up (NIO, for example). If (""If"", so relax) necessary, Elon will sacrifice profit margin, to reach that goal. It's almost.., almost, as if Elon sand-bagged a little in 2020 to just under 500K, to make the numbers work. Regardless, it'll be a busy next 3 quarters in Shanghai and Fremont."
this leg may be much more brutal than the previous one.
"The drama in China is slowing turning to Tesla's favor. The girl that wore ""no brake"" T-shirt is being slowly exposed as a ""money seeker"" (in Chinese it is called ""Peng Ci"" meaning intentionally bumping for money. Her self-conflicting words change constantly. Before Tesla released data, she said Tesla had no evidence she speeded. Then after data was released her family started to say Tesla did not have right to release her driving record, violating's her privacy information etc. Then she started to say the data released was not hers.. lolNow she apologized for being jump on Tesla car at the the auto show but said she did not go to the show to do that but tried to contact Tesla because her being ignored for so long..., but people find it hard to believe it was not her intention to make scene because she wore a customer make T-shirt with words ""brake not working and Tesla logo on it?Tesla friends were able to find her social media record and some of her exchange of ideas with a another second hand tesla owner about how to create traffic volume on social media, how to get attention etc. lol"
Time to buy TESLA!!! Last chance to see the stock price in the lower 700’s
"No way this goes as high as cathie wood predicts, not with the national debt what it is and not with the huge tax increases coning to the rich."
It's Time to Buy and Cover Call Writing to Adding More Shares!!!
"Tesla stock upgraded by Wedbush after ‘paradigm changer’ delivery numbersLast Updated: April 4, 2021 at 10:03 p.m. ETFirst Published: April 4, 2021 at 10:00 p.m. ETBy Mike MurphyWedbush’s Ives boosts outlook, sees Tesla’s profitability improving in the coming years￼Tesla said it delivered more than 180,000 vehicles in the first quarter.Bloomberg NewsWedbush Securities has upgraded its outlook for Tesla Inc., following stronger-than-expected quarterly deliveries.On Sunday, Wedbush raised its price target for Tesla TSLA , to $1,000 a share from $950, with a long-term bull-case price of $1,300 a share. Tesla shares closed Thursday at $661.75 (markets were closed Friday).Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives also changed his rating from hold to outperform. “In our opinion the 1Q delivery numbers released on Friday was a paradigm changer,” he said in a note. New Stocks to Buy Now SEE IT ❯❯ Top 3 Stocks to Buy SEE IT ❯❯ Stocks Set to Double SEE IT ❯❯ Buffett Stocks to Buy SEE IT ❯❯ Ad| LocalOn Friday, Tesla reported first-quarter deliveries, its proxy for sales, totaling 184,800 vehicles, blowing past the FactSet consensus of 168,000. The Silicon Valley electric-vehicle maker said it produced just over 180,000 vehicles in the period in what Ives called a “drop the mic” number.“We now believe Tesla could exceed 850k deliveries for the year with 900k a stretch goal, despite the chip shortage and various supply chain issues lingering across the auto sector,” Ives said Sunday. He added “eye popping delivery numbers coming out of China cannot be ignored with the trajectory on pace to represent ~40% of deliveries for Musk & Co. by 2022.”Ives and his team also see Tesla’s profitability significantly improving over the next three to four years.Tesla shares are down 6.2% year to date, but have skyrocketed 628% over the past 12 months."
TSLA investors today buying the dead cat bounce.
#1 world's economy dumping crypto is going to cause the greatest financial collapse on every asset we ever witnessed . There will be no escape.
95% of day traders fail miserably. Long term investors do very well. Hodl Tesla and chill!!! Btc too
Get out and stay in cash. All ingredients are ready for a massive sell off.
"Going Up! Shorts, did you sell low and buy high today? Buy back now or it will go way higher at the close!"
Did you buy today?
"Imagine you are a money manager today and have cash to deploy. What do you buy? If there is a company Has EV delivery, solar installation, energy storage all grew big % quarter after quarter , you don't buy it? Yes you do. Some growth companies may be running out of cash, but Tesla has plenty cash. Some companies may have past success but has become complacent, but Tesla, with a big lead already, is till innovating like no tomorrow. You don't buy it? Yes you do.Morgan Stanley said the biggest risk of Tesla is not owning it. I totally agree."
Way More pain ahead tomorrow closing near the lows. Sometimes the experts are wrong Cathy Wood. Test of 565 soon.
"We all know Tesla killed on delivery..... the question is ...... what about revenue & profits? Guidance? Remember, they reduced the price of all vehicles by a lot and now that inflation is hitting hard the parts to build them are expensive..... What about chip shortage? I’m not bearish but you all need to think about this and make a decision before Monday market closes! Be wise and take some profits specially if you bought it back in the days! That’s just my 2 cents "
I have 30 contracts and I'm holding through earnings. order numbers are through the roof in just about every country. This stock is going to Rocket up 2 earnings and Beyond. Goodbye shorts..
"Gordon Johnson is right....read this.Johnson said in a note that comparing Q1 2021 with the same period in 2020 is “irrelevant” and the proper comparison is rather with Q4 2020. He said that majority of Tesla analysts are either overreacting to Tesla’s Q1 delivery numbers or misunderstanding them.The GLJ analyst said Tesla has a growing demand problem. Johnson highlighted the fact that the automaker was “barely” producing any cars in China in Q1 2020 and price cuts of approximately $8,500 for Model 3 Standard Range and $24,100 for Model Y Long Range had not yet been made.“More specifically, the ONLY quarter where TSLA had fully cut the prices for its cars in China and had full production in China was 4Q20, where the company sold 180.6K cars; so, the ONLY thing that matters for TSLA in 1Q21, and going forward, in our view, is sequential growth,” wrote Johnson.As per the analyst, the growing volumes of 2% in Q1 on a quarter-over-quarter basis “is not a good thing.”Johnson said that Tesla’s growth prospects in large car markets around the world have peaked out and there is “no more low-hanging fruit.”“This is not a company with a production problem; this is a company with a DEMAND PROBLEM,” wrote Johnson."
close above $700 you yoyo!!!!!!~
"At Tesla earnings for Q1 we know they only sold model 3 and model Y. The average selling price (without credits) for this quarter was 45 890 USD and the margin was 22,0%. From this we can calculate the cost price by subtracting the margin % from the sales price 45 890 - 22% = 35800. Despite this tesla stated that they had reduced their cost price to [below] 38000 usd. My question is then, where do they get the extra 2000 USD from in this equation?"
Should I jump in now or will it go any lower?
can't make money on this stock.
"Biden is being used (wow, suprise) to create fear and panic sellinv, alowing more banks and institutions to #$%$ every bit thwy can get. Dont fall for it. if you sold in 2017 hownwould you feel now? same arguments then as nowLet me let you in on a little secret. Biden doesnt know what bitcoin is. even if he does, he can barely remember his name he is totally incapable of doing wbat these bashers say, and there is a reason they are everywhere right now."

Dogecoin is fundamentally just as energy intensive as bitcoin. The only difference is there’s less competition to mine it. So if you drop bitcoin for dogecoin you’re just helping to move the mining competition from bitcoin to dogecoin and the net effect is zero.
Ten points in the TSLA 50-day moving average away from a “death cross.”

"tomorow big red day for tsla, outgoing stock to see what happens the crash"
People viewing this thread is rising faster than TSLA share price.
Elon said will do 10 to 1 split in summer so buy now before it splits and goes back to 1000!!!!
Do you remember when $TSLA was not making profit and this stock was shorted a lot. But this stock went skyrocket.And this is the same.
Beware: Any “news” website (Yahoo) that does not allow comments on its articles is likely just trying to manipulate you.
So this is what is feels like to be a early $TSLA investor. Always wondered how they put up with all the doubters. Now I know.
700 looking like the new support it’s trying to hold. the same way it played around in the 600s before it ran over 700
"Without regulatory credits, gross margins are still 20% plus. Give it up shorties. Tesla will have revenues of 250 billion in a few years and then ultimately 1 trillion. At that point they will have an app store and many other high margin software businesses, bringing in huge profits."
the Chinese will not forgive the offense and claim that the breaking between 75 miles/hour and 35 miles/hour suppose to take longer than 3-5 seconds. That is what the protest in Tesla booth was all about.
"FINALLY!!! Elon Musk comes to the realization that Bitcoin is not a adequate currency. The US likes that decision Elon made, I'm sure. Good announcement from Elon now he needs to sell his bitcoin shares, and fast."
"Tesla is just a podium, from which Musk preaches his crypto teases. ""Building cars is hard..."" he says, and therefore no longer fun. Tesla, Inc. needs, deserves, an engaged CEO. How much does TSLA need to drop before shareholders revolt? Being ""ahead"" of the competition is not the time to let off the gas (sic). Complacency and arrogance will be Tesla's demise. The board members are all Elon lap-DOGEs, so I do not see a favorable solution. Even though I am currently benefiting from this debacle, I would ultimately like to see Tesla become a viable U.S. company, but Musk's insanity is making that outcome unlikely."

Going to 677 then 671.FROM THERE HEADED TO 650
Shorties/bashers are coming out of their caves after seeing recent pull back. They were scared when Tesla stock jumped from $565 to $750 this past month and half. This quarter results will push them back to their caves again.
"Tesla is blatantly circumventing Canadian law to get their customers tax credits by offering a range limiting software option to get the price just under $45,000 CDN which they can then pay to remove after sale."

"Elon Musk makes money on everything he touches: Cars, software, batteries, Bitcoin, money market, rocket launches, recharging stations. The company is so much like Apple it’s like watching the 1980’s and 90’s replay Steve Jobs. It is why Tesla stock will grow and split several more times in the next few years."

Other ideas would be appreciated.Guru."

"Markets - quick check on where Tesla currently stands in sales.Jan-April we have maybe 85.000 in the u.s then another 75.000 in china, 30.000 in Europe - that would be 190.000- lets say about 220.000 YTD global. Is that about right ?"
Don’t sell a single share. I’m in 100 percent in Tesla
"Whatever the reason for the crash, this will dent the public confidence in the vehicles and the brand overall, even if a buyer isn't interested in an autonomous vehicle, it will make buyers suspicious enough to avoid tsla and go with a trusted manufacturer."

"Tesla Solar having business problems? I submitted a solar roof deposit refund request about 6 months ago because of delays for the slate style roof tiles, not available yet after years of waiting. Still no refund check. I escalated with customer service reps several times since then, and they just talk and string me along telling me it's being processed by the billing department. Right now I just spent 1 hour and 30 minutes waiting on hold to talk with Solar Roof representative who just told me the same thing and to wait up to another 15 days for processing.What if I was a new solar roof customer? Why wait on hold for 1 hour and 30 minutes?Does Tesla have cash flow problems, is that why they are holding onto deposits without timely refunds?Or is it organizational mismanagement? That is just as bad.Pick one or the other.If anyone from Tesla is reading this, my Order Number: EN4566155.I would SELL this stock if they can't get their act together to properly run the business."

"There is huge manipulation going on with Tesla Stock. Yesterday 10% rise was fueled by weekly call purchases and put sells. Funds do not need to report weekly options and they expire quickly. They could be pumping up the stock for them unload their large holdings before earning call. Or there may be another game here.Still expect this to keep dropping towards $400 by year end. The interest and pumo with TSLA is waning and reality of competition is setting in. Good luck.Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) first-quarter earnings call will be on Monday, April 26, 2021,"

Just waiting for people to realize that Tesla is not a car company. That's when the company will explode.
sweet Karma for Elon for tanking bitcoin
Did TSLA split again ? I bought it at $900 and now $590. What's going on ?
"What I really think is happening. US investors are still myopic and delusional. They still believe in FSD, energy company and earnings narrative. World investors are viewing Tesla a company that is rotting from the inside out. The CEO is not credible, FSD is dangerous, sales are falling, service is terrible and all divisions of the company are unprofitable. They are moving their profits to safety."
ready for the ride back up to $800's again
"Baillie Gifford, the fifth biggest holder of TSLA, reduced their position by 40% in Q1. So far as we know, they still own about 1.7% of TSLA shares; we won’t find out about any current dumping by them till well after the fact. Since 9/20, Baillie Gifford sold off more than half their TSLA position. Something to keep in mind as retail bagholders and others add TSLA shares to their portfolios."
"The fact that TSLA/Musk couldn’t have prevented the kind of alleged, irresponsible, abuse of FSD glaringly flys in the face of TSLA being cast as a leader in HIGH TECHNOLOGY"
"I added more TSLA . hedgies will cover before the close. Classic. May of them lost money from last Thursday. They are scared. They will cover before losing more tomorrow. Expect TSLA gap-up tomorrow. Buy buy before hedgies. Time to SQUEEZE them out. Buy with margin and hold it for long term , rates are so cheap. TSLA 725-750 today"
Bitcoin is collapsing and will take Tesla down with it. To link Tesla to bitcoin was another fatal mistake. Elon is an obsessive gambler and things will not end well.

"The Mystery of U.S. Tesla vehicle sales. Tesla doesn't officially give these numbers, but it surprises me that TSLA sold nearly 200k vehicles in the US in 2018 and sales declined in the US in 2019 (slightly).Musk is like a magician. He is a master of distracting one's attention from what is actually happening. So, in Fall of 2019 we had battery day and Musk was promising 1 million Robo taxis in the US in 2020. What he wasn't talking about was the decline in US vehicles sales by Tesla.Now, 2020, US sales were nearly 300k (it seems, again TSLA doesn't disclose official numbers).So, if TSLA is a super growth company, what's in store for 2021 in US sales? About 450k? Maybe, but, monthly sales figures have been in the low 20's so far (and the first quarter is at a record sales pace of all US auto sales in 2021). In other words, TSLA, so far, is lagging BEHIND it's 2020 sales pace in the US. Musk isn't talking about it.Instead he is speculating that the Model Y will be the world's best selling vehicle by 2022.Really?"
Tesla will have plenty of company with similar if not better performing EV's over the next couple of years. This will worth half of what it is today in a couple of years.
750 @ close

Cathy Woody says this is good.
"They are talking about the infrastructure bill and how 200 billion going to renewable energy....and of that 170 billion giving incentives to buyers of elec cars. Tax credits going back up. About time this country...this world starting moving from point A to point B more efficiently. A combustion engine is about 35% efficient, similar to the human body. An elec. motor? More like 90%. This country started out with elec vehicles 120 years ago until two guys named Ford and Firestone bought them all up and put them in trash can. Here we are 120 years later. My how time flies."
"Want to see something cool: check out and compare TSLA 6 month chart to BABA 1 year chart [12month], they look exactly the same!Remember the 6 month on TSLA to the 12 Month BABA#TSLA #BABA"
One question though! Base on market infor 4.66% shares of TSLA are in short position.one technical queation. How much the shqre price will go up if all the shorts decide to close their position? 4.66%?
"Per Marketwatch, the average analyst estimate for Tesla 1st quarter deliveries was 173,800. The actual number came in at 184,800, less than 6% above estimates. The fact that so many people here consider this tiny increase to be a ""blowout "" report is baffling. It should be interesting to see how the market reacts on Monday."

Why would you sell one week before earnings because one guy decided not to seat in the drivers seat? Teslas are still not FAD. Rip tho
Going back to 650 soon. Hop on
I wonder if this will have a gradual decline to test 545
Tomorrow green
This is done dam i sold with a massive loss $25k
I shall buy in at $4.20
Competition? Bring it on. The consumers will ultimately decide and we will tell every quarter what the demand is. Stop with the overvalued tired argument. If you are the leader in EV you get rewarded what bulls investors think you are worth.
Who else is buying going into earnings? I bought a bunch on Friday.
People should make Elon Musk try his own medicine... by dumping Tesla stock making a profit and then buying it back cheaper... isn't that how it works?...
"Let’s not all forget that without Tesla and Elon, EV would either be nonexistent or definitely no where near it is today"

"There was no reason for the price of this to go up today when they exceeded earnings expectations, because at todays prices, all future earnings are already priced in."
"I bought some TSLA at $600 recently.... couldn't resist the pullback from $900. Earlier that day, I passed three big car carriers on the turnpike, each with a full load of new Teslas. All white, all the same model. I hope this is the beginning and not the end of this company. I usually come too late to the party. Several years ago, when the cars first came out, I stopped a guy getting out of a new Tesla in a bank parking lot and asked him about it. He said he bought the car and immediately loaded up on the stock. At least half of the twenty-or-so houses on my street now have Teslas in the driveway, and a few have more than one."
At the start of the year was 730.....let us see where would be at the end......LOL
"The is $1,500 at beat in pre-split price. The split doesn't add value to a company's valuation. That is equivalent to $300 post split. Even at $300, most smart investors base their decision on valuation won't touch TSLA. Only wicked fund managers like Cathie Wood will gamble their people's money in hope to cause short squeeze and buy TSLA."
but but but...they told me 3000 by March.
this is the only one in RED zone still.....
I see 692 today maybe 700 if it break 684.50
"Sandy Munro was a little harsh on the VW ID4. He likes a car that requires little thinking involved. Now the real evaluation is underway. I think Sandy is going to be highly critical of engineering of the car. To me it looked like the ID4 involves a lot of parts and that will = a lot of labor or a lot of robots. In either case it = expenses. Other than that I think the car looks great, charges good, has good range 220 +miles, and will suit many drivers needs. Good job VW."

If someone buys tesla with bitcoin tesla will keep that bitcoin. On average historically bitcoin rises 100% per year. Let that sink in.
news? random +3%
"Funny - in an article on Yahoo today, Musk admits that FSD is still at Level 2 and will not be at Level 5 this year (2021). Ha - finally forced to admit his scam! Level 2 - TWO! The Honda Legend sedan is certified L3. GM, Ford and Waymo are all ahead of Tesla."
Just the facts please.Good cars. Good management. Unique market position. Stocks way overpriced.
Tesla makes everything themselves. It’s like apple  best EV car
"So ironic that Teslas have multiple camera, that constantly record what other drivers are doing. But not one camera that shows what the Tesla driving is doing (or did)? The only camera IN the car, is currently disabled."
Where are the battery swapping stations?
Today i See Green . Musk is angry because Shorters don't respect him! I hope it will up to 800 today!

Cathie Wood's Ark Loads Up Further On Tesla And Cuts Apple Stake
 GO Tesla. go catch up to FSR performing TEN X Bloomberg Analysts compares to Tesla early days. DOUBLE  PLUS!!!
Closing reeD
Whatever happens after hours rest assured it will go opposite by next week. Short term this stock is like a roulette wheel.
"I'm moving to FSR. That stock has bottomed...this, NIO and CCIV have a long way to go.$NIO $CCIV"
My guess this week Target $820.00. Tesla will wake up this week.
IAM bearish
WellTime to walk the dogNot too concerned as this morning was a bit stressful Shud be nice and green moving forward
No business model any longer. Competition has the scale and can copy everything quickly. Tesla has to built all from scratch. Sooner or later the valuation will be adjusted
Look they beat this on everything this happened too on other stocks they report good numbers and fall then next day they rocket after 10 Am
Once we break comfortably above 700 off we go to 1000
Let me tell you something￼ people Tesla EV cars best days are behind them. One one word for you. Competition￼￼
I missed my projection. I expected $1.40 minimum. Revenues came in on target. PE has gone from 1100 to 240. I was hoping for 1100 to forward pe of 90. Everything else is excellent and on course. Revenues and earnings and margins improvements should bring forward PE to under 100 in the next few quarters. Not bad for a company growing at more than 50% per year. Keep in mind that TESLA has achieved this in a pandemic that collapsed the world economies and also keep in mind of how well TESLA has weather the chip shortages.
All the best of technology stocks with low PE ratio sold off today and yet TSLA with enormous valuation didn't. Market makers are to blame for this. It'll definitely will sell off next week.
Amazing beat ... go Tesla! 
"TSLA very good earning report in this chips shortage, TSLA said it expected over 50% growth this year, so TSLA can raise to$1500 in this year, it's front view very bright, because people income strong raise,and it's margin profit raised,and government strong support,"
GOING UP! CRAMER LOVES THIS STOCK! GREAT EARNINGS!
We are gonna zip to $900 tomorrow
"Immutable fact. Competition is entering the EV market faster than the EV market is growing. Without a renewal of the EV Tax Credit, demand for Teslas in the US will level out within a year. The CyberTruck will be a big thing for 1 year, then it will be considered a gauche monstrocity for guys with small dorks. Tesla totally wiffed on the huge US pickup market by not putting out a more traditional model. Anyway, 2021 Tesla will fall short of 1M vehicles. With the CyberTruck and new S/X they will do 1.5M in 2022 and that is about where things will level off until Tesla has a true middle-class sedan under $35K - or until the government throws them another bone. But none of this matters since their profit comes from carbon credits - which will decrease gradually year over year."
"Just looking at the 6 month chart, and I'm no technical chart analyst haha, but it seems as though this thing is forming a ""cross"" where it's either going to go back down to 500 or back up to 750. I feel like it's only going to stay in that 600 range going sideways for so long. The theory about trading sideways usually holds true...the longer you go sideways, the bigger spring up or spring down results. What are ppl's thoughts? If you think it's going to blast up, hit the thumbs up, if you think it's headed back to 500, it the thumbs down. This will be a poll haha"
Shorties = Suave
"Hate to break it to you, but current regulations require that you can see a very specified area behind you using a review mirror. Tesla's Cyber Truck rear window (I'm tempted to call it a slot) violates the upper vision plane, by at least 100 millimeters (that's about 4 inches to those metric challenged). Rear widow needs to go up in Z-axis (skyward), totally disrupting the side view profile. One of a few dozen issues I have with the current ""design"". In short (pun intended), Tesla still does not have a sellable/buildable CT design."
Tesla is trading at 120X 2022 estimates that NO ONE can predict if they hit..sorry for the long post :)
this should be lower loll. over valued stock. and cyber truck is ugly.
It’s super green today
"Weren't some of you MORONS calling fElon Madoff the ""King"", the ""God"", the ""Savior"", the ""Genius"", who was going to make you all Teslanaires?! Aren't you happy where you're at now?"
"It’s only a matter of time before we find out Beavis and Butthead, who crashed the Tesla into a tree in Texas, were screwing around with defeating the safety features when they killed themselves in a fiery wreck. Looking forward to the crash data being released. I love how the Chinese protesters claims about “brake failures” were just destroyed by the data logs. Very handy."
"Just sat through an NVidia IX Cabin Perception presentation. System monitors driver's attention, via cameras that focus on head and eye movement, and AI interpretation. And guess what? I would know if the driver was missing. Tesla is falling so far behind..."
Tesla is the next Tesla
Don’t be fooled by shorties Elon is for the good people all the haters will be burned
"Presently w/ $0.64 eps, TSLA has a pe of 1140, hypothetically quadrupling eps to $2.56 we get a pe of 285 for a $730 share price.IMHO we’ll TSLA or plummet from 1140 to far more realistic, but still incredibly high for an auto stock, to 175......175 X $2.56 = $448/share"
you guys cheered when cathie bought.. now cathie sells.. it's only just a little bit.. lol... what the... fuh...
Glad I didn't buy before close. Will buy in tomorrow when it bottoms out.

"It's like someone made a decision -- and the price locks in....hmmm, I wonder if that has anything to do with the unlimited liquidity the Fed provides to all the major investment banks?"
"Hodak, co-founder of Neuralink, sneaks out the back door a few weeks ago, no announcement. Apparently, he didn't want any part of Elon's lies. Seems to be some ""disagreement"" about the monkey playing pong."
This is what happens when you believe you are untouchable. Enron Musk thought he was above the markets and the law.
"Weak hands are giving shorts exactly what they want. Take advantage of the cheap shares and keep accumulating more shares of $NIO, $XPEV, $PLUG, $WKHS, $TSLA. The entire sector is being driven down and there is no individual fundamental issue with any of these stocks, otherwise they would not have pulled back together. Excellent opportunities when extremely oversold without no changes but positive ones at these companies. Keep buying. Keep holding until 2025+."
Shang-hi Tesla factory is building a recycling parts dept.
$450 by next week
Tesla are apparently sold out. I believe the reason they are sold out is because they have run out of chips so have trouble meeting even anaemic demand.
"Have any of you longs ever stopped to consider what if Tesla does not win full autonomy and robo taxi? Do you have any idea what that would do to this stock? Without that this is just a small auto manufacturer. Substantially smaller than GM, which is presently 1/10th the market cap of Tesla"
Tesla to $ 850 to 900 before earning...
Michael Burry of ‘The Big Short’ reveals a $530 million bet against Tesla.
"Tesal doesn't offer rebates, or gouge customers, on their cars. They just suffer ADD, on a weekly basis, on what the MSRP should be."
"So what does it do to the mid-term profits if demand for high margin cars is close to zero ? And if Tesla turns out to be a producer of only two models in lower price and margin segments which are becoming increasingly crowded ? And if it turns out that newly added manufacturing capacities will not see full utilization in the foreseeable future ?Tesla is a good company and the cars are great. The business planning has been a bit bet however on a homerun for them, absent of other car manufacturers picking up. That bet has failed now. It is obvious for anyone except for Cathie and her clueless followers. Big names will gradually unload of TSLA stock, they just have to. Make sure they don't do it on your backs."
I'm not here to fight for or against Tesla... Just looking for information. But can someone share a reputable source showing Tesla posted fake earnings?
Elon was seen at Burning man festival this past weekend....
"F-150 Lightning starts at just under $40K, BEFORE savings."
wait until market correction 200
Buy Tesla stocks when they already PROVED that they make more money than Berkshire. Valuing this company at 600B right now and make money like a lemonade stand doesn’t make any sense. Fundamentals matter in the long run and you’re holding by hoping for another good news for a catalyst just to keep the price float which is not sustainable in the long-term.
"Thanks to your big boy Musk, manipulated the BC and sold when high, now waiting to buy again and everyone can buy a Tesla with BC again. Dragging all EV stock down."
Tesla will be bankrupt before the end of the year. Elon Musk will be laughing all the way to the bank with all of the money he ripped off from loyal investors.
"ELON IS THE GOD OF SHORTS KILLER. Shorts, go ahead and sell your house since it has gone up in value tremendously in the last year or so and short more Tesla???"
Haters will hate ! Go Tesla !!!
"Let TSLA crash more so i can buy more! LOL! TSLA is a good long term investment. It might actually monopolize the EV space come to think about it. But for now, need to get it at a cheaper price."

93 cents is nothing for a share worth 729. way over valued.

"Don't people realize that Tesla is an insurance company too?

And um.. some day far in the future they may have a $25,000 car, which will probably end up being a $35,000 car... and um... China... and um... bitcoin... Anyway, the point is this is not a car company..."
"Suppose FSD is here and it works!What does that mean for TSLA profits??Could TSLA get an extra $1k per car of revenue (on average per vehicle sold annually)? Maybe. But over time, competition will drive down the premium over whatever extra cost is involved installing the extra cameras.But $10k is simply a fantasy of Bulls. It's not really that useful, even if it works (more or less). Some might pay that much in spending $100k on a model X, but, few model 3 drivers would. Many people would rather drive a car rather than watch the car being driving. Will one, for example, be able to drive to one's local bar Saturday night, drink alcohol to raise blood alcohol levels above the legal limit and use self drive to get home safely and free from any drunk driving charge if pulled over by the police? Hardly, absent some changes in the law. This might happen eventually, but, TSLA's lead in developing FSD (if it has one) will be lost by the time legislatures act.Robo taxis are out for the very same reason. It just isn't legal to have a car on the road without a driver.This too might change in time, but, probably only after any lead TSLA had vanishes.One can see TSLA's move into auto insurance as not so much a way to obtain profits from a new line of business, but a necessity for TSLA owners if auto insurers don't want to take on the risk of insuring Tesla under FSD. Actually, I suspect one the negatives of a Tesla currently may be auto insurance premiums higher than for more conventional cars."
"Elon Musk was recently quoted as saying the following: “When it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world, and probably, next year. So I am not 100% certain next year, but I think it’s quite likely. I’d say more likely than not that in 2022 Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world.” Given that Ford sells over 1M F-150s per year and Toyota sells over 1.1M Corollas per year, and Tesla has only estimated sales of 750K total vehicles for 2021...what exactly is Musk saying? Is he actually saying Tesla plans to sell over a million Model Ys in 2022? If so, how many TOTAL vehicles would Tesla have to sell in 2022 to make that happen? 2M? That certainly is not the guideance Tesla has given. Tesla's current production capacity is only 1M/year max. Is he saying production capacity (and sales) will actually double in 2022? Thoughts?"

This will hit 900 before earnings.
"$NIO – WHAT $TSLA PUMPERS AND OUR WESTERN MEDIA DOES NOT TELL TO YOU:$NIO stole this biggest deal in EV-History with Sinopec from $TSLA – YES, Tesla had speakings with Sinopec about building charging stations but decided itself for the universal and better approach of $NIO!People do not understand $NIO s battery approach, NIO has everything what $TSLA and all others have and much more.NIO invented this whole unique battery swapping, mobile charging as a service, super chargers, home chargers and more to relieve customer pains, to become independent from the battery technology. There is only 3% demand for EV cars worldwide and this with subsidies. Not to talk about when they are gone. One of the main reasons is the pain vast majority of potential EV users still get when they think about buying an EV. This pain gets only resolved through NIOs approach. True demand drivrn through intrinsic Motivation can only be created through a pain relieving product and this is what NIos whole business plan is, a huge pain reliever. The best is, the self growing intrinsic demand is accomplished, NIO has now started with the upscaling and will overtake China and then the world, nobody can compete with NIo. This is why sinopec decided itself for NIO, to bomb its 35000 gas stations with the NIO Battery approach and not with the stoneage garbage of Tsla, even better, NIo is planning to achieve 100 more of such deals like with sinopec IN 2021! BUY AND HODL AT LEAST UNTIL 2035 and short tin can tsla!"

"I wonder if it will ever sell at a more reasonable P/E. I do not understand how you can have a P/E ratio of 1000+ and not be considered in a bubble. A similar situation happened in 2001 with the tech stocks. If you bought Microsoft then (obviously a fantastic company), it still took 15 yrs before its stock price recovered. That is a real possibility here. So I am not sure if I should buy more or sell some."
I prefer to own BOTH Tsla and Xlm. Like this if you want Elon to split Tsla so we can all buy more...

"This is Tesla's litigious nightmare:- Elon made outrageous claims about the future capabilities, in great detail, of Tesla products.- These claims extend to not only to the add on packages, but the cars themselves. (3X MSRP)- Elon made these claims in public forums, direct answers to specific questions, no ambiguity.- Tesla accepted payment, for the cars, and the add on products, prior to execution of said products.- Most damaging, Musk gave specific timeline for completion (delivery) of said products (since passed). - Elon Musk (and BofD members) personally grossly benefited from selling product to the public.Their only defense would be that the claims were so obviously outrageous, no sane person should have believed them to begin with. This is the tactic attempting to be used by those being sued by the 2020 voting system companies. Legal suicide. Just a matter of time before the class action lawsuits begin...."
Did anyone catch Elon stating Model Y will be number 1 best selling car of any kind sometime next year. Right now that’s the Toyota Corolla at 1.2 million units. And that 98% of all trade ins are Ice vehicles. This is a very big deal !
It's almost useless to come to Tesla posts and read these negative postings by short sellers. I have at least 2-3 year goal for my Tesla investment so what the stock does after this report or even the next one or two doesn't matter too much to me. Expecting $1400-$3000 within the next three years or so.

They brought it down to zero MPH and while the car was stopped, they climbed over the center console into the passenger seat never opening the door as that would disable Auto Pilot. They attached a chain with a weight onto the steering wheel to simulate hand pressure on that wheel. Then from the passenger seat they increased the speed from zero up to resume driving. Auto Pilot will not enable unless the roadway is properly marked with lines as was the test track at Consumer Reports. Remember the road they were the accident occurred was unmarked so even if they had done all that they did it still wouldn't have worked there.Could it be that options expire today, that this story keeps being brought up? Why aren't the ""journalists"" reporting all the facts and not just the minimum to make this tragedy only FUD and click bait."

I’ll explain (debunk) the short thesis of Cathy Woods Selling TSLA. The Ark fund has to rebalance their positions and can’t hold more than a 10% allocation in one particular company. Ark loaded up on TSLA on the last drop. Tesla stock took off and most likely exceeded the 10% limit. Ark took profits and bought shares in others companies. Seems like a smart move. Meanwhile shorts are high 5ing. When shares hit $900 Ark will probably selling more shares. It’s how the game is played. TSLA to $1000

I'm worried Elon's focus on Tesla is NOT where it should be. SNL could lead to casual hook ups with celebrity cool crew and then what??
Just a energy credit company. Will never be profitable if the company didn’t sell its credits.
Tesla will drop BIGLY once NIO’s sales surpass them in Europe
"Search for a new yahoo article ""Tesla Will Lose a Source of Revenue Pivotal to Profit Streak"".Longs, you've been told over, and over, and over. Now there are articles that say the same and many pundits here have been telling you.."
who is elon? the chief of tesla? or the chief of bitcoin and doge coin?
"TSLA is a long term investment. It's always good to take profits but if you don't want to play the trading game, just buy TSLA on dips and hold long term."
"When Bitcoin Crashes and Tesla sees the Market get FLOODED with Competition, their earnings quickly turn into MASSIVE LOSSES.... BEWARE!!"
Tesla investors now put their money in cryptocurrency due to Musk’s clues. The money should’ve been invested in Tesla.
"Approaching the March low of $563, it was inevitable that this low would be tested... but what way will it go next?"
"$590 close and 3% gain is not bad for longs. But this will happen on Friday due to OPEX. TSLA drops every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday."
Musk offended too many people. price gonna slowly downtrend
"I repeat - ""Wasn't this going over 900 today? Longs acting like everything is ok. You guys are sad."""
600 is coming back?
Apl.21 Vehicle delivery nos will lift TK to 800
My phone is blowing up about all things tesla.......wait........My tesla is blowing up about all .......Tie a yellow tesla round the old oak tree....
"PEOPLE YOU HAVE A SHORT MEMORY. Remember when kathy woods said TSLA is $3000 3 years ago when it was $450 before the split ? She was laughed at and the stock price tanked down to 250. She was proven right only 3 years later. A visionary doesnt see day to day. They see far into the future. TSLA market cap is the entire PLANET earth. Thats like 200T. Tsla should be able to get at least 5% of that which is 10T, which means the stock price should be closer to $7000"
TSLA AT $750 tom watch closely
"But still . . . down $33 isn't bad for a company that is losing money in every part of it's business except selling intangible assets to external parties and other speculations.The only question is when will they actually make money from building and selling cars, or batteries, or solar roofs or self driving software.Guru."

"buy the dip, tomorrow will dip more"
"Why Tesla Stock Looks Set To Rally FurtherTesla Net Income: The strong revenue growth will need to be accompanied by steady improvement in margins, with Tesla's Net Margins growing to over 21% in 2025This is possible, considering Tesla's increasing autonomous driving software sales and potential reductions in battery costs.This would translate into a Net Income of about $35 billion in 2025 and $280 billion in 2035. Tesla's Net Profit Margins could potentially be higher than rivals such as BMWThis is possible due to the company's increasing automation, improving economies of scale, declining battery costs, and higher software content in its vehicles.Tesla Revenues: If Tesla ramps up deliveries as detailed above, Total Revenues could potentially grow from $31 billion in 2020 to over $160 billion in 2025 and over $1.3 trillion in 2035.Tesla has been efficient in ramping up production capacityTesla has a fairly solid track record of scaling up production. Deliveries rose from about 2k cars in 2012 to 76k in 2016, 367k in 2019, and 500k cars in 2020.Tesla built-out its Chinese factory in a record 10 months and production is expected to scale from a run-rate of 250k cars per year, Tesla reports 499,550 vehicle deliveries for 2020.This means that Tesla should be able to build out new capacity and scale-up, as new models such as the Model Y and the Cybertruck are launched.Why is it possible for Tesla's Deliveries to jump to over 4 million by 2025 and 30 million by 2035? The auto market is sizable and Tesla is gaining ground with new models such as the Model 3, YGlobal automobile sales stood at about 88 million units in 2019 and the industry is electrifying at a rapid pace. For instance, the U.K wants to phase out gasoline cars by 2030. EVs look more like smartphones did for mobile phones back in 2008. All cars will practically be EVs over time. Being an early mover in this space, Tesla should have an edge in the market. As Tesla launches new models and the mix of EVs as a percentage of total global vehicle sales grows, the company could scale up sales meaningfully.Tesla Deliveries: While deliveries grew to almost 500k units in 2020, it is possible for deliveries to stand at close to 3.2 million cars by 2025 and around 30 million cars by 2035.Tesla's Deliveries grew 58% over 2015-20During its Q4 2020 earnings call, Tesla said that it expects 50% CAGR growth in deliveries over a multi-year horizon.While this appears lofty, it is possible for delivery growth to stand at 45% per year between 2020-25, declining to about 25% between 2025-35.If you buy and hold Tesla stock, the expectation is over time the near-term fluctuations will cancel out, and the long-term positive trend will favor you since the company is getting stronger and growing over the next few years and decades to dominate the EV market."
Tomorrow can be A judgment day for the SHORTS .... just saying
This must be the bottom. Today should be a buy buy buy day.
TSLA at $ 561 ? $400 can't be far behind.Bail ALERT !

Hello fellow Tesla friends I am buying some ford shares because they are doing the right thing for the environment.
"Wow - they only sold barely over 2000 model S/X. That is where their margin lies - higher priced cars. Will be interesting to see how earnings shake out. There is no doubt that the deliveries are impressive, but if they sold ~16K Model S/X in Q4 2020, and only just over 2K in Q1, that means their cheap, low margin cars had very high demand, but the question is, if Tesla couldn't make money selling more S/X models in Q4, and didn't have a great EPS in Q4, what do ppl think the EPS will be for Q1?"
"Tesla is hiring! Dire need for graphic arts specialists , especially those gifted in renderings and computer-generated imagery. Looks like Tesla is planning on announcing even more game changing future products."
"Friendly reminder: Tesla and Facebook have similar market caps, and facebook just reported net income of $9.5 billion for the QUARTER."
"Every day we get closer to my target price $160-$120s, are we almost there?"
"Over the past couple of years, Tesla has faced growing scrutiny from federal regulators over safety concerns spurred by self-driving car crashes. Last month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which oversees auto safety in the U.S., revealed it’s opened nearly 30 investigations into Tesla car crashes, including nearly two dozen that at the time remained open."

I'm not gonna lie I like tesla stock but from an eye for an eye perspective would it not make sense if elon has ruined most peoples crypto profits to just start rapidly selling tesla?

Friends ! join me in buying some F shares and get in on the next 10 bagger !
musk said the autopilot wasn't engaged. well you would think that it would engage when it detects nobody in the drivers seat with the car in motion.
Tesla will get to 30-50$ in share prices at some point. It’s so funny how people think just because it’s so high up it can’t fall lol
"The California-based electric vehicle and clean energy company Tesla is expected to report its first-quarter earnings of $0.79 per share, which represents year-over-year growth of over 240% from $0.23 per share seen in the same quarter a year ago."

"We are now a bit past half way through May and Norwegians have purchased 4,037 BEVs so far this month. This is already better than May of last year, and should show growth. The top selling car for the day and the month is the Ford Mustang.Tesla has sold 5 cars this month. Notable are that the first model Y has sold (yesterday I think) and today 2 Model 3's have sold. That means the ship (or first ship?) may have arrived for this quarter, and we should get a much clearer sense of demand. Last quarter was very good.It's also still early in the day for car sales (many deliveries happen at night, at least in North America). Tomorrow will perhaps provide more insight.For now, Ford is the early leader for the month.Guru."
HUGE GIFT TO GET TSLA MAY 21ST CALLS CHEAPER AHEAD OF APRIL EARNINGS. 
is bitcoin being counted to this earning or no?
"The good news is, Tesla won't have to go to the trouble of splitting its stock again for a long, long time! Well... unless a reverse-split becomes necessary."

"The bipartisan infrastructure bill that is currently under consideration contains no ""green"" initiatives; just roads and bridges. No indication the rich-boy-toy tax credit will be restored for Tesla buyers. Even if a follow-up, phase 2 green infrastructure bill is rammed through by dems, the talk is that there will be a price limit on EVs eligible for tax credit... so probably only the Tesla Model 3 will qualify. (Taxpayers should not have to subsidize rich boys who want a ""Look At Me"" CyberTruck or a 1000HP S/X ""Plaid"". If you can afford those vehicles you don't need taxpayer assistance)."

"So Elon complains about hedge funds and the SEC. that’s pretty rich coming from a guy that clearly saw Tesla wasn’t going to reach the milestones required to get his 11 billion option package. So he uses 1.5B of Tesla’s cash to buy Bitcoin, then talk it up and then sells enough to push the bottom line into the required range."
"Tesla having problems getting workers in Sparks. ""Come work at the biggest & most advanced factory on Earth! Located by a river near the beautiful Sierra Nevada mountains with wild horses roaming free.""No mention that you need to drive through the #$%$ hole of Reno to get to the mountains.

Cathie Wood is extremely bullish on TSLA. She has huge price targets. Guests on CNBC today agreed that TSLA is extremely over valued at its current price.

"This must be another gut-crushing day for those holding TSLA who bought in at or near the peak. I feel your pain.Not literally, of course. I'm cursed with the knowledge of basic mathematics and know how business works. That has kept me far from TSLA in recent years. But I do feel sympathy for what you are going through and what is to come. Being emotionally invested in any stock is a terrible, terrible idea. Like addiction, it hurts everyone around you."

"SpaceX is going to the moon, not Tesla.Tesla remains earthbound with competition by more than 200 electric carmakers.And stop telling, that Tesla is more than cars: Their solarbusiness is very small and not competitive, their battery business is interesting, but too expensive compared to chinese products. The only thing that works within Tesla are the cars, and these cars are losing their technical advantage over their competititors.These nice cars don't justify a value of Tesla of 710 billion $.The absolutely most interesting thing in Tesla is the ability of Elon Musk to sustain a extremly overrated company, so he can collect billions of dollars on wishfull thinking.Thats baffling."

If so, I just can't imagine what it is... production numbers - meh. FSD - meh... as of right now Teslas are still running into parked trucks.

WHERE is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to stop this illegal stock manipulation ???Where ???"
shorts is burning
"I’ve seen this type of media spin before with my $TSLA investment days (still holding 1/4). Only negative news and some how they can spin good news into bad news. For example the article now on YF from Motley Fool: AMC CEO says stock is under attack by shortsellers. This headline makes it seem that the CEO is desperate. There was no headline about the main great news which is that the CEO agreed to not sell ANY of the 500 million shares calendar year 2021 should the amendment in the vote pass. This just goes to show me we are indeed on the right path. It will be a battle of emotions and truth, we will prevail as long as we keep up with the DD and hold and buy shares. Eventually the short sellers will capitulate and lose. You can hold shares indefinitely without interest, short selling you cannot. And with borrow rates of 15%! You will definitely need them to cover soon. Hold, buy and turn off share lending."

"Clearly this latest crash with 2 fatalities is a concern as it is NOT an isolated incident. Also, while we have had several decades for our Fire departments to adopt policies and training to deal with EV fires, it seems to still be a problem. The concern here is with a problem like these battery fires along with self-serving features that seem to be problematic (still), ultimately, it will be the insurance company's high coverage rates that may make owning an EV cost-prohibitive.Surely, some issues needing to be resolved by EV manufacturers and their engineers. This along with a toppy market could lead to a price decline."
"Bad News for Tesla, but Tesla fanboys are ignoring.Pe of 1200 ...the valuation is. Big fraud.1. production start in Germany has to be postponed for 3 months Berlin Der für Juli geplante Produktionsstart im Werk des US-Elektroautobauers Tesla in Grünheide bei Berlin könnte sich deutlich verzögern. Hintergrund ist, dass womöglich noch einmal Unterlagen zum Bau der Gigafactory öffentlich ausgelegt werden müssen. „Wenn es die komplexeste Form der Auslegung werden würde, dann sind wir bei drei Monaten“, sagte Brandenburgs Wirtschaftsminister Jörg Steinbach (SPD) nach Informationen des Handelsblatts am Mittwoch im Wirtschaftsausschuss des Potsdamer Landtages.Eine Aussage zum Zeitpunkt des Produktionsstarts der Fabrik machte der Minister nicht. Das Thema Verzögerung, sagte er indes, hänge mit dem Thema Auslegungsverfahren zusammen. 2. big quality issues in China Tesla muss sich bei Chinesin entschuldigenNach einem Zwischenfall auf der Shanghaier Automesse ist der US-Autobauer Tesla in China unter Druck geraten. Das Unternehmen entschuldigte sich schließlich, das Problem einer Kundin ""nicht schnell genug gelöst zu haben"". Staatsmedien sprachen von einer anfänglich ""anmaßenden Haltung"" des Autobauers, der sich in seiner ersten Reaktion ""kompromisslos"" gezeigt habe. TeslaTesla 596,70Die Kontroverse begann mit einem Protest der Frau, die am Montag auf dem Tesla-Stand auf der Automesse auf ein ""Model 3""-Auto gestiegen war und lauthals Bremsversagen beklagt hatte. Sie wurde von Sicherheitsleuten abgeführt. Die Videos gingen viral. Bislang sind keine Probleme mit den Bremsen bei Tesla bekannt, aber in Reaktionen beklagten Kunden wiederum andere Mängel ihrer Autos.Der US-Hersteller wies den Vorwurf der Frau zuerst zurück. Sie sei für ihre Proteste schon bekannt. Doch dann kommentierte die Staatsagentur Xinhua, die Qualität von Tesla müsse den Erwartungen entsprechen, um das Vertrauen der Verbraucher zu gewinnen. Auch die mächtige Rechtskommission der Kommunistischen Partei mischte sich ein, forderte Respekt vor chinesischen Verbrauchern und warf Tesla vor, nicht der Ursache des Problems nachgegangen zu sein.Derart unter Druck entschuldigte sich das Unternehmen und versprach, ""aktiv auf die Meinungen, Vorschläge und die Kritik unserer Kunden, Internetnutzer und Freunde in den Medien"" hören zu wollen. Tesla wolle ""mit einer aufrechten Haltung nach Lösungen suchen""."

"Auto Pilot/FSD questionsOnce again there is a crash that involves a Tesla and the claim is that Auto Pilot was not engaged at the time of the crash. Tesla records always indicate driver error and Auto Pilot is never engaged. I believe there may be some truth to this claim. There seems to be this imaginary view that Tesla computers are seamlessly following the movements of every vehicle using Auto Pilot and learning. Modern computers do amazing things but does Tesla really have computers that are able to receive and process information real time from every or hundreds of thousands of cars? Do they monitor every single car every minute of every day? Imagine monitoring breaks, steering, and motor changes for all of these cars. I am thinking that the cars involved in the accidents are not being monitored. They probably are not actively monitoring many of their cars at all. All Tesla can really claim is we have no record the system was on."
Tomorrow this will rocket don’t sell it guys
"$RIDE short term is choppy. Long term, Lordstown Motors will not only help combat climate change but also create jobs, lots and lots of jobs. Similar but lower rung mkt cap as $TSLA??"

"well, bought my first tesla stock yesterday, so today this stock will probably half in value."
"Last time it went down a lot I bought. This time it went down I bought more. I don’t worry about dips. Never invest money that you may need fast. I don’t do margin. Nest egg secure, and that check is steady. Relax"
"Lets review Tesla's 18 years in business. They have STILL never made a profit from selling vehicles. They have never sold over 500k cars in a year. None of their ""other"" businesses make any money either. Yet their market cap is larger than most other car companies combined? You know the companies that sell millions of cars and make profits."

"I am wanting funding to start a new company. I don't have a complete plan in place yet but I do have this idea. It involved installing hitches on all EVs. Buying a carrier for the hitch and a generator that sits in the carrier. A plug will run from the generator to the EV's charging port. This way, you will never be stranded. But will just look funny carrying a generator on the back bumper of your EV."

Going to $1000 soon. I’m gonna hold.
Musk never begged the government for help. He created a successful business on his own. Meanwhile all the so called American legacy car companies are waiting for a government bailout. They can't afford their own operations! My money is on the smart guy that can get things done without help. No car company can do better than Tesla.
BIG BIG day ahead! Great Earnings call!! stock will skyrocket!

"Everyone agrees that Dogecoin is a joke -- nobody really argues with that. Elon Musk created this $85 billion ""market cap"" out of a crypto-joke. This should make Tesla shareholders stop and think.... how much of Tesla's market cap is also made up of the same bubble-froth enabled by the same people (fanboys) who are basically running wild, gambling in the market under the enamor of papa-Elon?"

"Tesla is not going to go bankrupt and it's not going to $3,000. It's just a volatile stock that people try to play for profit.Odds are the value of the stock will drift downward to more closely aligned with the other automakers.Tesla went nto a market that was not being addressed. They got head start. They were able to demonstrate significant demand existed for electric cars. They faced a significant learning curve and made a lot of mistakes"
How high do you guys think TSLA will reach end of year
"So, is Tesla worth more than all the other car companies combined? hhhhhhhmmmmm,..............absolutely NOT!!Other companies are catching up...........Way overvalued with a PE ratio of 577........ Headed to $300 by mid June........"
buy rating from Goldman with increased price target.
"Shorts bet on market sentiment. Longs bets on fundamentals. Log term, fundamentals always win. Tesla is going to make lot of money at 50% growth per year. The compounding power will make Tesla's earnings growth year over year at very steep curve up to the sky. That is what exponential growth means, which many of the short losers will never understand."
I'll be holding for at least 10 yrs. at that time nobody will buy an ice car
Option expiry day. Neither calls nor puts will make money. Stock will be flat. Sell off not today
"The sources that reached out the Electrek reportedly shared that Tesla has told employees that, with two months left in Q2 2021, production capacity for the quarter is already sold out. Keep in mind, this may be without the refreshed Model S and Model X, since Tesla continues to delay delivery times for those cars. The automaker is clearly counting on the Model 3 and Model Y, as expected."
Just bought more at this price! No doubt it will be a smart investment! Go Tesla!

"I find it very informative that TSLA’s USA deliveries have significantly declined each year following the 2018 high.This fact clearly shows a very powerful saturation factor in effect.

Let’s see. Last quarter was an earnings miss. This quarter would have been another miss were it not for Bitcoin profits. I wouldn’t stick around until next quarter at these levels.

Any chance TSLA will pop to 800 after hour? Any ideas?

Last premise related to Tesla any country that does not adopt electric locomotion will fall back by miles because it will become absolutely non-competitive while the rest will game 70% efficiency in energy distribution and that will go straight to their GDPAnd this premise goes for oil producing country non-oil pollution country charcoal pollution country any country that produces any energy including atomic will benefit from electric mobility will atomic maybe not that much but atomic is very dirty right you’re better off generating electricity thermo electrical production of electricity at the refinery and sending it straight to the batteries that’s what sufficient it’s so efficient to create a completely new industry the sky said carry the gasoline the big tank is full of gasoline that are expensive because it cost insurance the driver the dirtyThey’re also subject to being robbed you have to maintain pipelines it’s a hassle that costs a lot of money so all those people are going to be working in transporting goods and services create it with a 70% savings that’s coming is huge it’s great it’s going to be a boom bonanza for the entire economy of the world world
Should add more today
Just bought another Model S. What an awesome vehicle. I can’t call it a car because it is way way way way better than a car. Happy trails.
ELON BUY APPLE AND GOOG BWAAAHAHAHAHA hahahah And GME HAHAHAHA And ?? JNJ HAHAHA
Obviously it's time to BUY TSLA! Most analysts including GS raised their price targets after the ER. That means the ER is very positive and TSLA has a higher value!!!
GREEN DAY FOR LONGS.#$%$
"Cathie Wood erred in her $3,000 target in 2025. We will likely see late next year once the new factories are on line and the other auto companies lease their software."
Funds are picking Tesla. Going past $700 today. Let’s do this
What a great buying opt!
"TSLA is a Bitcoin world now?, I thought it is a technology companyHow does a 700 billion company report meagre 10 billion revenue and hope to survive. Figured: Bitcoin earnings and regulator credits. This is becoming a joke. Tesla is a great company, Elon is a true legend. But, TSLA stock is on weed. Maybe I will buy some to make some easy money as, I am sure, someone will come with $3000 PT.Inspite of everything, never bet against TSLA. If it can make you money, enjoy the Nirvana."
"Elon Musk already emphasize autopilot feature, but people ust don't listen"
"So many smart investors here.. this is tesla not bitcoin. Don't get it twisted, there is no bad news. Same buisness ethics and same profits ..."
"I need to pay alimony to my ex-wife for the rest of her life, and also provide her with a new car every 4 years. I'm thinking a shiny new Tesla, with FSD."
1200$ is coming soon.
"If the NHTSA does their job, they would force Tesla to shut down Autopilot until proper safeguards are in place to prevent these types of accidents. That is highly unlikely, though. That agency has failed to act on other problems with Teslas in the past, things they would have made any other manufacturer order recalls."
"So for all of you clueless slack jawed cult members who are standing around wondering why tesla is crashing after losses release,....if you go by the reported numbers without even digging into the details, it's reported that tesla made just under a billion in profits for the qtr.That's after all of the production records, the doubling of plant capacity, the 50% growth,... the hyping, the lying, the out right male equine dunging,.... after all of the struggling and musk begging cult members to go help at the dealerships (yes they'refreakin dealerships),... and round it up to a billion,... tesla is just a $4 b per year earnimgs company.Give it a normal multiple of a car company of 10 to 15,... no better give it AAPL's pe of 35 and it's a $140 billion market cap company at best with a still over valued stock price of about $140/shr.What tesla released today is not the numbers of a $725 billion market cap company.It's the numebrs of a $50 to $100 billion market cap company."
Don’t sell cuz it’s going higher
Investors who shorted Tesla lost $40.1 billion in 2020. Tesla surged 743% during the course of the year.This is the only real fact and the reason for so much hate and frustration among short-sellers and hedge funds.
"Don't get me wrong. Good company. Bright future. Just overpriced and needs to mature and get that PE down. Hope for your sake, they grow earnings, but sure seems like the market has a regression to the mean in mind. I personally think $450 is where youare headed."
"$450 limit buy order until May 31, 2021. 100 shares. Let's see. It might get filled."
Grid storage ADDS to electricity cost. Cheap Energy = Prosperity. We need Nuclear not grid storage to compete globally.
Supply chain is going to derail earnings on numerous companies. Plus with inflation prices will sky rocket.

"CNN-Washington, DC (CNN Business)Tesla's ""full self-driving"" feature has attempted to drive under a railroad crossing arm while a speeding train passes. It's nearly driven head on into a concrete wall of a parking garage, attempted ill-advised left turns, clipped at least one curb, and at least one driver was able to set a maximum speed of 90 mph on a street where the posted speed limit was 35 mph, according to videos posted on social media."
hopefully it goes down so i can get cheaper shares 
"The Tesla era ends before it has begun. As a monopolist, Tesla has not made any profits from cars production and will make losses in tough competition."
"doge is the new bitcoin. And the fElon himself has now dug himself into a 1,2bn hole.You can only hope it's lesson.."
TSLA isn't going to get a Participation Ribbon in today's Nasdaq bounce.
Let's face it guys Is tesla really environmental friendly company? Okay What about lithium mining? What about coal plants? Why people can't see this? it's so clear
"Tesla customer ""Brakes don't work""Tesla publicly release data log and claims she was speeding.Now, doesn't lack of braking ability lead to excessive speed?"
Stocks are too high. Everything is gonna have to come down unfortunately
Down 4%.Nice job longs...
"If I owned this stock I wouldn't sleep well at night knowing how much this company is betting on China. The same place where the communist party changes the rules on a whim, places it's own cronies inside companies, and disappears people that say the wrong thing. Look at Baba, Ant Financial, and Jack Ma as the most recent example. Elon's been careful so far not to say the wrong thing and offend Xi, but one day the CCP may just decide they don't need TSLA anymore"
"840 next, take it downtown and print it."
"party  is over, returning to $500"
"Test drove a Tesla Saturday, bought one that day, but no inventory in the NY/DC Metro area. This is because demand is up. The parking lot was packed and people waiting in line to test drive. Numbers will hit this week. I was refreshing their inventory page all day Tuesday, picked it up today. Its years ahead of anything comparable."
One thing I find ironic is that Tesla gets beat up for its high P/E ratio... but companies like NIO that are praised don't even have a P/E ratio because they have never made a dime of profit. If NIO made $1M in profit in 2021 their P/E would be off the charts. I guess better to make no money than just a little money!
Imagine one of these days dow down 400-700 points. Scary
"These days I can see that investments are being put in sectors. So the trades are being made throughout those sectors. This is not a good practice to see if $TSLA is being sold, all other EV needs to follow. $NIO has its own entity and it will behave independently soon. Because it doesn’t have a weird CEO like Musk who influences the market by a bunch of tweets for his own wealth. Ever wondered why $BTC got pumped and now being sunken after his tweets all the way through last year?Same history is happening with $DOGE once it’s pumped enough, he will push for a dump.$NIO’s William Li never tweets weird financial advices but he’s minding his own comapny and the future of it!$NIO will soon jump off as their plans are ambitious and realistic!"
"Everyone spread the news on well health technology and buy shares on Monday open. It does not matter how many you can buy personally 10, 100 or a 1,000. The more people you can get to buy even just 10 shares will force the shorts to cover and get out"

"Even if you are part of the cult, can you try to answer this question (not to me here or anyone else, just for yourself) most honestly and objectively? What is more essential for the long-term survival of this company, making profits on producing and selling cars (Yes, Energy, SD Software, blah blah and then more blah, even though 95% of the revenues are from selling cars), or short-term speculating on the most speculative intangible asset in the history of economic activity and on pure taxpayer handouts? Try to contemplate that in your mind."
we will see $700 this week!!! Tesla is unstoppable
Tesla has the best battery . If you wanna buy the best electric car you buy Tesla
TSLA has to include $1.5 Bitcoin holdings on EARNINGS report! Bitcoin has greatly appreciated in value since Elon Musk purchased it! BLOWOUT EARNINGS coming!

"Another day, another crash , another death. I know if you are a huge Tesla fan you say ICE vehicles crash all the time. True, with 1 big difference. FSD is paramount to Tesla's success. It is failing. You can't ask people relaxing behind the wheel who are paying attention, to suddenly make an emergency maneuver. You are late to react because you are thinking the FSD will kick in. It's dangerous and it's not right."
 WOW. NEWS. Bloomberg Analysts announces NEAR DOUBLE  Play on Fisker with Strong Buy Avg $21.50 price target $FSR Fisker; WARN $TSLA could drop $110 to find next support. THEN it’s a buy buy buy
"for all those who still own shares, I'm sorry yall got caught in the hype. The market will not reward you for your ""loyalty"". Next time do your own research."
I said for two weeks that Musk has to go. He was a libility to TSLA since he got itchy fingers. He must stay away from Twitters and focus on quality issues and core management.
Haaaahaaaaaaaaaaaaaa soon fair value - look at the tesla 3 design - who would get one now - with all the other e-cars.It looks like a turd

Will old Warren Buffet Jump into Tesla this week or next. They are talking something is up..
"QS solid state and TSLA battery day is the same scam. Everybody knows the next big thing for car battery is solid state. But only the two companies have claimed they are very close or already make it a reality. Others like Hyndai, GM, VW and Ford are just keeping do the research. It is the same for Level 5 Auto Pilot. All car manufactures are doing the research. But only Elon Musk has charged customers for it because he said he is very close to finish it."
"1 in 5 EV buyers return to gas. Reason, it's a hassle to charge. It takes forever. Good luck on long trips. EVs are good 2nd cars, but not too many individuals can afford 2 cars let alone one"
"this is so overpriced , basically a $150 company for $738 lol"
"Love Tesla and will continue to invest. An increasing positive outlook on lithium’s future and the United States speaking out on securing it’s domestic supply of lithium has lead me to also invest in Lithium Americas (LAC). Their Thacker Pass mine is the largest known lithium resource in America and recently got federal approval. LAC is seeking a partner rn and I believe Tesla will join them. Giga Nevada is only miles away. Their Argentina mine, Caucharí-Olaroz, is also only a year away from production."

All in on Tesla stock
Can tsla make it 5 RED days in a row?
Why are there so many Musk haters? The technology behind Tesla is unmatched. GM took a government bailout 10 years ago and still charge 75k for a Yukon with an average engine. Once the China news passes people will become aware of how much gas companies abuse our system. 900 by Christmas! Buy buy buy

Bloodbath incoming!!
"Question? Do you think TESLA will ever pay a dividend? I think they are waaaayyyy to greedy to ever even consider that. So with that said where do they rank in your mind as a company that really wants to create value for their investors? Also, who buys a stock with a PE = 1,001? Answer is most mutual funds... So HOLD ON when the market has doubt."
TSLA will be $800 before earning date
"The New York-based investment firm bought 47,031 shares in Tesla after selling most of its Apple shares.

"Can ANYONE out with that can give and ""educated"" answer as to why Tesla is kissed in the #$%$ one day (up 60 some odd point) Then the ""very"" next kicked in the #$%$ down 30 points ? What makes ""one"" days difference. A friend of mine had a theory that Hedge Funds are trying their best to discouraged investors into selling their shares. So they can pick them up at a cheaper price. I'm 70 years old and in good shape. I getting out of this Biden stock market all together, can you imagine 4 years of this old coot in the White House what the USA will be like? Biden ""Make America Weak Again"""
"And don’t believe everything you read about the tragic, but quite preventable and unnecessary accident.Media outlets of all types sensationalize just about everything- that’s how they keep viewers and ratings high,As once the dust settles and it has been thoroughly investigated the onus is on both the dead guys, and Tesla to some extent...

"TSLA, Dogecoin, Tesla, and ElonSo, will TSLA be saved by Dogecoin or will they both sink to deep sea. Poor Tesla once upon great company. I mean TSLA is a stock game and Tesla is car company, but how can TSLA survive without Dogecoin?. In all this Tesla and Elon may somehow survive.I meant to say no one can rationally tell us why TSL is insane 650 billion company with AP/E 673. Barron article says TSLA is dead Money for now or is it dead money for ever. But, at the same time there maybe other tricks Elon may play (other than Dogecoin promotion) to save Tesla. Never underestimate Elon though"

Con artist fElon bought hsi personal Bitcoin before he used Tesla money to purchase Bitcoin for the company.
Hey  guys. FSR. just signed the deal that $NIO and $TSLA wished they had when they first started out. 50% near term upside.
You can be upset that Tesla got 500 million from regulatory credits and you can be worried about competition. But not at the same time. Because you see the “competition” had to buy the credits from Tesla because they can’t / aren’t building enough EVs to meet the min gov requirements while Tesla IS building only EVs
Wait till next earnings report. This stock will get hammered. Total garbage. Running out of EV credits to sell. Bitcoin losses on books from running mouth off. Move to LEV. Government has desire for 45b in public transit conversion to electric. Lion electric building plant outside of Chicago. Going to be huge and not run by eccentric elitist.
Short squeeze coming now
"When a friend told me he was getting at least one solid pick every week from a certain program I was skeptical. Anyway, I checked out (http://Stocks-tracker.com) and haven’t looked back since. Join them."
So TSLA only turned a profit do to Bitcoin pump and dump by Musk and selling environmental credits... otherwise it turned a nasty loss for the quarter. What happens when the market is flooded with E-Cars?... TSLA will not sell so many environmental credits.
Kathy wood really played those retail investors! You got played!
"FSLR is a good object lesson for TSLA longs. The solar industry is booming. Installations now are a major source of new electric generation capacity. Yet, FSLR reached its all time high of over $300/share back in 2008. It's now trading around $80, well above it's average for the past 5 years. Will it ever get back to be above $300? Maybe not (at least in constant dollars).Will TSLA ever get back to $900/share? Maybe not in the next 13 years. It could easily be trading below $200/share in 2030."
i just gotta stock up on popcorn.
"APPL - 3.54, VWAGY - 3.98, GM - 3.38, AMZN -2.2, TSLA - 1.65.Guess which one is the strongest of the list and will go up the most when the market goes up? You guessed right, Tsla. And who is more nervous, the longs or the shorts? You guessed right again, shorts."
I kinda hope it drops i want to buy 15 more shares. it was good in march in the 5s. may never see that again this year or any year until split in 2023.
"I say it was a good thing TSLA is traveling through a valley, because the short fuel being stacked under TSLA in this valley is quite powerful, and will be enough to fly TSLA well over $1,000."
Looks like analysts are starting to price Tesla as more than a car company FINALLY ! Powerwalls and mega pac storage starting to play a role something other car companies are not able to do
see the red flash?
Enron Musk has cashed in his billions and ready for his next fraud: SPACEX. Tesla is not his priority any longer.

All you Tesla fans out there better have a look at this video and maybe you can finally understand why this way overvalued company doesn't have a chance in hell of dominating the eV market. It is about to run into a buzz saw of incredible competition. Not a single Tesla car made the list.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN4U2LkOku0
"In the middle of Tesla's home market, as many as 150 percent more Audi-e-tron were sold in the first three months of 2021 (4,324 units) than in the same period last year. That's a stab in the heart for Tesla. What do you expect for Europe? The new real car EVs from BMW, Daimler-Geely-Smart, Volkswagen, Ford Germany, Renault-Nissan, GM-Peugeot are made to dismantle Tesla before Tesla can even get a foothold in Europe. Tesla's business in Europe is going very badly."

I will never understand the people who are misinterpreting the Battery change solution of $NIO as a competition to tslas system.$NIO has everything what others have and the battery changing solution plus mobile charging wagons. There is even a franchise for battery charging stations available.BaaS is just one part within the universal battery approach of NIO to relieve all the pains vast majority of people outside of our crazy ev investor world gets when they even think about buying an Ev.The more people hate BaaS the more do they uncover their foolishness and unavailability to understand business plans and pain relievers within them.Nio is the future and hopefully $Tsla and $xpev will join BaaS to really change the world together and remove this last barriers to a better world hand in hand.

"PE exceeds 1000. though it’s a great Comp, don’t think Tesla could make meaningful profit in near future with growing competition. Even if Tesla delivers 10 times the current profit, won’t justify the current valuation. Wanted to get in but better to watch and wait"

"Firefighters said that it took 3-4 minutes to put out, but they were they for 4 hours. The media always twists the truth"
"WOW the paid short posters have flooded this board for many days, who is paying them GM, NIO?do they know real investors do not listen to them?"
So if you remove only the Regulatory Credit Sales Tesla lost money; again. And if you remove the Bitcoin profit (of which Musk himself PUBLICLY pumped up the price after Tesla purchased the bitcoin then scraped $100 million profit out of it) Tesla lost even MORE money. This stock belongs where its gonna be once the Bear market takes hold:$275 at the most.

Why does TSLA build cars w/ bad brakes for chinese then mock them on social media when they complain about it?

Elon is very smart. So why didn’t he come up with the idea of a gold backed cryptocurrency instead of AABB?
"Just my opinion....Tesla will report their best quarter ever at the close of the market on Friday, April 26th.Good luck to all my long investor friends."
"Whilst Elon is still buying Call options which have to offset by those buying stock Tesla may continue to rise. When that stops bankruptcy will soon follow. This fraud, when discovered, will eclipse both WireCard and Enron put together!"

Why only 5 to 7 % jump with Q1 record production numbers? Best wishes to TSLA holders but does this market reaction so for make you wonder to this holier than thou stock?
"The establishment media in collaboration with both long and short hedge funds, in collaboration with large individual investors, in collaboration with political/religious allies, etc. , use these news items to manipulate the stock in their favor. Sometimes they manipulate/exaggerate to buy more shares at a lower price and sometimes they manipulate/exaggerate to sell their shares at a higher. price. Other times they use it to enter their large option positions, both Puts and Calls. We have a mafia controlling both the establishment media, Wall St, and the Federal Reserve. A TESLA crashing and burning is only a small incident that has limited manipulation value. Inflation, Interest Rates and military actions etc. are the large topics where they can manipulate for days, weeks and even months. The power of the media is the key to the koshernostra's success."

"considering TESLAs addressable mkt, current valuations should be north of $1.2T, very undervalued at current price! ~$1500 would be fair..."
"I would be more inclined to buy Tesla stock if I actually saw a Tesla being used. I truly don’t think they will get a true foothold on the auto industry in America. On the west coast sure, but the rest of America. No. In my opinion, Midwestern’s would buy GM or Ford EV’s before Tesla. Why? Where do you think GM or Ford factory’s are? What do majority of people drive? People are naturally brand loyal."
Teslas have a history of becoming blazing infernos following even a minor collision
"Isn't it amazing how this website(you aren't allowed to use the actual name of the website) literally allows no blowback for their communist propaganda?

"Elon lost his way, I also have asperger's syndrome and I'm telling you he lost focus on what was important. He never should have put that cash in BTC as it was contradictive to what he claimed to stand for. Elon was on a personal power trip to manipulate what was said couldn't be manipulated. He went down a rabbit hole and lost his way. He got off on the instant gratification as he flip- flopped from Doge to BTC and everyone hung on his every tweet."

Tesla kiddies in love with crypto --> professing to save the world from carbon with ev's while creating more of it with digital currency. Like watching a fat man at a banquet espouse the virtues of diet Coke.
Revenue from regulatory credits jumped 46% to $518 million. Tesla recorded proceeds from sales of digital assets of $272 million and net digital assets of $1.33 billion on the balance sheet. Tesla bought $1.5 billion in Bitcoin in February.

Plus $1 today. Fantastic. Then $2 down after hours. The big bounce that all you bag holders are waiting for hasn't come so far. Maybe it's the lack of growth overall and the pressures in China. Or maybe it's the huge amount of competition that is getting stronger and stronger. Or maybe it's the weak revenues and the focus on Bitcoin. Who knows. but what's clear to all is that 2021 is not 2020.

That’s basically what Tesla is as a stock.Okay, so sales are forecast to expand rapidly because they have introduced a new and exciting product that will change the world.Let’s say that the sales will quadruple over the next few years. In that case, is paying $100,000 for a business that has $13,332 in sales still a good deal to you? At what point would you want to make a profit? Remember there are still employees to pay, factories to run and stores to maintain. Tesla’s profit margin is 2%, according to Yahoo, so 2% of those sales is $266 in profits, per year."

Bitcoin value has dropped too much since Tesla accepted it as the payment for EVs. Tesla must lose a lot of money. Luckily I have sold all Tesla shares when they started involving in bitcoins
Tesla down 300-450usd
"Risk vs reward has become more of an issue for me I am reducing my position(s)And shifting over to COIN, as ithas more upside than Tesla.."
Makes no sense .
"After his tweet it is clear he is a manipulator. He created the buzz around crypto, all amateurs go and by inflate the price and he now says it is unsustainable. Did he not know this in first place? He made millions in Doge and Bitcoin at the expense of inexperienced traders and he does the same with Tesla. It’s a proof he left many holding the bag here."
It is poised to explode anytime.
"This must be one of a seletced few stocks where the shareholders are falling for the same setup of institutions ten times in a row. Pumping for buyers in the morning, with subsequent selling, cutting down selling at end-of-day, lather, rinse repeat."
In addition Tesla has the solar roof business I also understand that the business is coming along I know that they’ve increased prices and the demand is very strong they are still resolving installation issues which it seems will take a little longer but that business is allegedly going to be bigger than the car business
Every time it pumps all day I short on the close. Works every time
Tesla’s business has not changed. Exponential growth in sales. Buying opportunity here. Being pulled down with the growth stock correction.
"Tesla Is Years Ahead Of Competitors With No Signs Of StoppingA lot of the leading car manufacturers in the world are playing catch up with Tesla. I believe this is because many of them simply didn’t believe that Tesla could deliver. But if you look at Tesla’s volume for the Tesla Model 3, there are some significant proof points that the company has. In fact, in December, the Tesla Model 3 was the third best-selling car in all of Europe. Tesla is not just eating into European car manufacturers’ hybrid sales, but also into their gas-powered vehicles as well. The automotive industry isn’t just made up of the auto manufacturers, it also includes suppliers and their partners as well, and in Germany this ecosystem is arguably the biggest. Many of the car manufacturers simply wrote Tesla off as a company that couldn’t execute and one that would never be successful. That was especially true of the Model 3, which has long been the company’s strategy for reaching a broader market and even more important, profitability. Tesla struggled mightily to deliver the Model 3 with numerous setbacks and stumbles, but eventually the company figured things out and started shipping Model 3s in volume and has shipped 400,000 vehicles thus far. Nobody really expected that Tesla would be able to ship 400,000 Model 3s by 2020, especially the European auto manufacturers. So much so, that both Mercedes and BMW have had significant shakeups including layoffs in the case of Mercedes and replacing the CEO in the case of BMW.Most of these impacts come from Tesla’s Model 3 and the vehicle’s success in selling into the same compact luxury sedan segments that BMW, Mercedes and Audi have the most volume in. The Model 3 is something different and something entirely faster and dramatically technologically more advanced. For example, the Tesla Model 3 Performance was put up against the BMW M3 last year by Top Gear and beat it in terms of track time and braking, which is quite unexpected for the performance version of Tesla’s ‘mainstream’ electric vehicle. The performance of the vehicle is fairly important to brand reputation and sales, but what’s even more important is the experience that the customer feels and the automated capabilities of the vehicle. That’s where Tesla is miles ahead of the competition. Many of Tesla’s competitors are still living in an era where a customer purchases a vehicle once and the only thing the manufacturer does is deal with warranty and recalls. On the other hand, with the initial introduction of centralized computing platforms based on NVIDIA, Tesla has effectively built a software-defined vehicle that is a constantly living and breathing platform evolving with the needs of users and Tesla’s roadmap over time. While Elon may have some lofty expectations for self-driving capability in Tesla vehicles, the company’s iterative approach to software is helping them inch ever closer to a self-driving vehicle beyond today’s Level2+ capabilities. The way that Tesla is able to accomplish this is through a multi-year effort to build their own high-performance custom computing architecture for FSD (Fully Self Driving) which includes multiple AI accelerators. Tesla is heavily using machine learning to accelerate what the car sees and how it can react to it while also adding features like Sentry Mode which give customers peace of mind. The system is not without its flaws, as the NTSB discovered in their investigation of a recent death in a Tesla where they blamed the company, CalTrans and the NHTSA. Tesla’s FSD computer, which to date is still not capable of ‘Fully Self Driving’, claims a compute performance of 144 trillion operations per second, a significant increase from their use of NVIDIA’s Drive PX2 in the previous version of Tesla’s compute solution. Tesla’s new FSD computer has capabilities that have dumbfounded the other auto manufacturers to the degree that they aren’t really sure what to do. A Nikkei tear-down of the Tesla Model 3 found that Tesla’s electronics are 6 years ahead of the #1 and #2 car manufacturers in the world, Toyota and VW. They even said an engineer at a major Japanese auto manufacturer was stunned, saying that, “we cannot do it.” This puts many of Tesla’s competitors at a significant disadvantage in terms of keeping up with the company’s capabilities and how close they could be to fully autonomous driving capability. With Tesla already putting the hurt on them last year, the near future doesn’t look bright for them unless they adapt, quickly. Car manufacturers are scrambling to respond to Tesla, they have been for quite some time. Some are partnering with companies like Waymo, while others are buying their own autonomous solutions like Argo.ai and Cruise. However, many of these companies still do not have access to the same hardware, software and chips that Tesla does, and while some of them have some experience in software, it’s what I would call rudimentary.https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorin"
Every single tesla on the road today must be recalled . Every single one
"LOL delivery of an additional few thousand cars is worth an extra 40b in market cap. Wow, definitely some irrational exuberance at play."
The TSLA stock will quickly bounce back from this.
"Options expiring on April 16, expect a big downward move"
Should've waited for Monday AM to announce
Shorts are covering and running for the hills
"When Elon talks, TSLA walks..."
going UP and closing GREEN! Can't wait for earnings the end of the month!!
Wildly overvalued at 64.00
So the Chinese customer that made a scene over allegedly faulty breaks is apparently refusing a vehicle inspection even by an independent 3rd party. Is demanding a large sum of money but won't provide evidence of the claim or even allow it to be looked into. Theatrics much? Possibly paid? Draw your own conclusions.
"Let you tell you something TSLA already hit 4000￼. Pre-split. And Catherine wood was spot on saying this one was $255 a share back in 2019 I believe was October 23 ,2019"
I have sold a $630 strike covered call with exp. today. Will I end up stuck with the stock?
Another very strong quarter. Price will go up as these strong quarters pile up this year so just hold and SP will be back over $800 in a few months and stay there
Good quarter. What happens to $TSLA on Monday?
"With Bitcoin over $62K, Tesla has added $1.5B to the balance sheet since end of January'21 (in 3 months)."
When do you sell a million shares? On up days.
Come on over to NIO. Hold long term and be rewarded just like you were at Tesla. No one is saying sell Tesla. All I'm saying is buy NIO before it multiplies.
Can someone explain why it’s dropping so much lately? And where do you see the stock going in the future
"Do not give up on Tesla, their largest growth engine by far is their land sat communication system which may replace cell towers."
"Ask any accountant and you’ll learn that an automobile warranty expense is properly categorized as part of the cost of making the vehicle. Yet since at least Q2 of 2018, Tesla in many instances has allocated warranty expense to “Goodwill” and other non-warranty expense categories. Why does that matter? Because it inflates both Tesla’s claimed gross margin and its reported net income."
"Folks, following the craze will hurt!! I never bought, not even in any mutual, bubble for 2 years on this"

THIS WEEKEND SHORTIES
2 KILLED IN TESLA CRASH. Am I missing something? Who in their right mind would not have his hands on the steering wheel of a Tesla that's on Autopilot? And what's the big deal about Autopilot anyway? Thanks. Drive safely.
"April Puts and Calls players who gambled on big movement from the earnings are going to get backdoored today as both sides get the air cranked out of them and find themselves down, puts holders will be down the least. Funny stuff, wall street played the players and took all their money again. Thanks for playin'.lol"
"When I traveled around by the world, I preferred inexpensive hotels and clean motels. When I came back, room and bathroom were clean. Bed was made up etc. Living at some one else's place seems like living without a service. For my money, I prefer hotels. It seems that there are different strocks for different talks. I bought one share at $156 to keep an eye on it. I think it is a great co and concept. But stock is overpriced. I would rather buy $TSLA as investment than $ABNB. Yet there are many Great SPACs than ABNB. Moreover, I would never rent my property or car to strangers. Some people do."
Fail quarter! Sell!
"Guess it’s forgotten the drop in share value when GM declared bankruptcy. “The stock has lost about 43 percent of its value since the start of the year. May 6, 2009”Ford almost went bankrupt too. “Ford took $6B government loan in 2009 — and debt still haunts company.”Those bailouts were funded by taxpayer dollars.Tesla was never involve in something like that. They bootstrapped from almost nothing to hundred of billions in market capitalization. And no plant shutdowns for economic or product demand reasons."
Go take a mortgage out and buy TSLA!!! They will control travel of the future.
Any serious speculation on earnings?
"As shylock plays with your emotions and mind always remember the fundamental FACTS about TESLA:1. $20 billion in cash and liquid dollars.2. Very little official earnings in the last 10 years BUT they have used their earnings to build new plants and buy cutting edge robots, computer, 4,6, and 8 ton die casting presses, huge modern automated Plants (machines to build the machines.)3. Assembled Top engineering team of thousands from around the world to build cars, computers, storage batteries, battery untilities, AI team and dojo computer to build a neural network that's feeding into automated driving softward for FSD.\4. The billions in profits that they made were poured into these huge companies in Shanghai, Berlin, Austin, Fremont, Nevada, etc and all the top projects.5. The combined worth of purchasing all of the above amounts to some $50 billion dollars not counting the intangible worth of the name.6. Add to that the $11 billion in liquid cash after paying $9 billion of current debt.When you look at the true picture over the last 10+ years TSLA has made tens of billions in earnings that were used to create and purchase the above reality."
"The reason for the delay with the Cyber Truck, is because the Tesla Semis, which was supposed to deliver them, was delayed, because there is a delay in producing enough batteries, because the Berlin plant is delayed, which requires all batteries that can be made, are to be used for Model Ys, which are selling good. So you see, it's a good thing. If your brain is hurting, it was intentional. ""When I be hurting; ibuprofen."" (Now you know why I list my gig as an marketing executive)."
so far shortes list 66 B ....adding more to reach 100 B before Q2.....Great marathon....who will win ....long.......or ...shorter
TSLA is building a big bullflag and feel good to get it good deal today.
"TSLA investors. 2 questions. 1. if FSD & Autopilot does not work is Tesla still worth $700 Plus ? 2. if you think that FSD & Autopilots do not work how is Tesla going to produce the kind of earning that Cathy Woods says is tied to Tesla's success, that being Robo-taxis making up 1/3 of TSLA value? it should be noted that GM is well ahead of Tesla's robo-taxi ambitions as they just sold ""Super-Crusie"" & Taxis ( driverless vehicles) to Dubai, the first country outside of the US to make driverless vehicles legal. Tesla's FSD is rated as a 2/5 for autonomous operations whereas GM's Super-cruise Taxi are 5/5. But if you listen to Tesla you would think its 4.5/5"
I keeps scooping up shares the last few months. I will keep buying but glad I doubled down!
tesla losing money on cars while musk took 18 billion in options last year
"Washington State legislature has passed “Clean Cars 2030,” a bill setting a goal to require all light-duty vehicles of model year 2030 or later to be electric. The bill passed as part of a larger package directing utilities to prepare the state for all-electric transportation.I wonder what company might benefit from laws like these?"
Elon Muskrat started his Bitcoin rant just after most people filed their taxes for 2020. So it seems that Muskrat is shilling for the IRS as they now know that Americans are heavily invested in crypto's and moving away from the debt ridden U.S. Dollar that has lost its spending power almost daily. Those investing in crypto's must now consider Elon Muskrat as a traitor and an enemy.
There is nothing left in this stock that could result in another huge rally like the ones we saw last year. There isn't a stock split anymore. There is no SP500 inclusion anymore. Earnings won't catch up to this valuation for the next decade. Only way is down.
It will reach $840 soon just like I said. T is long term hold and just like aapl v ma you will be rewarded.
"Consumer Reports says: ""Tesla is falling behind other automakers like GM and Ford that, on models with advanced driver assist systems, use technology to make sure the driver is looking at the road."" Tesla is not a car maker. Correct! And not even this."

Told you. Elon Musk is a liability to Tesla.
"Funny how a stock can lose 33% over 3 months and still have fanboys thinking it is a golden ticket to riches. Sorry folks, Tesla is no longer a growth stock. It is way overvalued and the correction has quite a ways to go."
"After having speakinga with both, Sinpoec decided to make the greatest EV Deal in History with $NIO. Why did that happen?$Tsla has a Fokus on battery charging and denies battery swap while the chinese people, the current NIO users, have an extreme high subscription rate, nearly doubling in every ER/Quarter, this indicates that battery swap in general has a huge future in China, NIO has besides of that everything what Tsla has and more with mobile charging as a service. The best in NIOs universal approach is, it is open to all other ev companys thanks to William Lis mercy and his great target to fight the air pollution in China and now also the world. Even Tslas get charged with the mobile charging service of NIO in China.This is why Sinpoec decided to give the greatest EV deal in history to NIO: Because NIO has the much better battery approach with a great future.NIOs battery approach was created to act as a pain reliever, a pain reliever to create demand in people for EVs – still vast majority – who still prefer ICEs.NIO is converting ICE buyers while Tsla and others living from subsidies and some few individuals who want to safe the world.The infrastructure decides the future dominator of the market and NIO is already overtaking Tsla, despite Tslas advantages for a too long time through the chinese government. The honeymoon is over, the chinese public is waking up about Tslas garbage/dangerous quality and garbage/non existent service. Tsla will never be able to conquer a monopole position in China, not only because it never will be allowed through the chinese government but mainly due to NIO, already overtaking China with the power of its Intellectual and management capacitys, to execute the best business plan in history of mankind in Lightspeed. LIVE WITH IT OR WAKE UP WITH THE BAG! A few months ago I wrote that a rebalancing of your portfolios because of above will be needed and now look at the sector, so much trash stocks there where they started and even NIO is due to this sector panic right now on sale. This is your chance , not to load up scams like CCIV or nkla but $NIO, the ONLY future of EV."
A good number of analysts are calling for a blowout earnings report after the close on April 26th....
"Tsla has a nice little niche market in BEV autos. Buses, trucks, trains, boats, stationary backup power going H2 though.Check out PLUG partnering with BAE."
"you guys saw Mercedes new ev EQS? this is crushing Tesla S on every aspect. longer range, nicer look, better build. Tesla better improve their car now because the big automakers are coming and Tesla will go quickly go from new tech to old tech."

Congrats all! Have a good weekend and hopefully the rally will continue next week. Go out and spend some time with loved ones and friends! $tsla $nio
NOONE IN DRIVER SEAT... NOT A MANUFACTURER ISSUE... $800!!!
The development inevitably takes its natural course and it is obvious that this thing will not end good.
"Why are people buying: Hoping for some good deliveries, short term wins. Stock remains completely overvalued and folding of the price will continue. A small delivery slippage or limted positive surprise will make this a 10% decline and unviel how speculative this stock is. Competition will do the rest during the next 6 monthes."
Tesla to the moon 
Buy in opportunity A giftU will see the results on Monday
"Tesla’s back on track with solar installs. “The company’s solar energy deployments hit a two-year high during the final three months of 2020, rising to a level that was nearly three times greater than when its solar business bottomed out in the summer after a four-year slump.”Lower industry solar panel and equipment cost, better install methods, high demand, attractive nothing down financing/leasing options and rising utility rates nationwide are bearing fruit for Tesla. Solar battery storage activity is peaking. Revenues for this sector are up, incentives from several sources are strong with more coming. Demand is rising as the higher summer utility bills start hitting home and business owners. The pandemic is seemingly getting better with increasing economic activity returning. Tesla’s market share in this will rise. Many buying Teslas are bundling it with rooftop solar and adding a Powerwall in a package deal. The Solar City acquisition will prove wise for Tesla."

What are the Earnings? Volume numbers mean nothing without profit dollars!
"Tesla P.E.----People were complaining that Tesla's P.E. was too high at 1200 a month ago. After the last earnings report and combined with the price drop the P.E. is 569, less than 1/2 of what it was. If Tesla continues to trade in the present range, the P.E. could be 50% less with a good earnings report, putting it at 200-300. This would be a huge drop from the P.E. of 1200. Even naysayers would have to admit the stock would be a screaming buy at that point, with the future of electric cars looking brighter every week, and Tesla still the leader."
500s. I will buy

we will not see $650 anymore ....it will be stayig around $980-1200 for the year. And $2300 when Tesla hits 1 MIL vehicle sold.
commodity prices going up chips shortages and input costs going up and inflation with a possible rise in interest rates competition increasing only thing that'll save this is bitcoin going up
Today TSLA rebound at $565 support line. It is a very good news for TSLA longs. Now chart looks much better.

"Tesla is the equivalent of a gas-guzzling car in 1980. There is already a shortage of electricity so the cars that are electric should be conserving electricity instead of a 1,000hp electric car that eats up electricity faster than a muscle car from the 1960s eats up gasoline. Maybe in ten years Musk will realize this and start shorting Tesla himself. Bitcoin will probably come up with a hard fork to drastically reduce its usage of electricity as Ethereum is doing (1% or less than currently), but I don't know what Musk is going to do--he is too unpredictable."

"Tesla longs, forgive me for my negativity.It is just so satisfying to see you all getting financially slaughtered on the daily... You all deserve it. None of you exercised any diligence. You heard about this stock form the coworker during the water cooler conversation, or maybe from a celebrity's tweet, or a 2 minute news segment on CNN, and thought, ""I'm in! This is a great stock!"" Making money in the stock market isn't that easy, longs... To make money in the stock market, one has to read earnings call transcripts and Form 10-Ks. I bet most of you don't even know what a 10-K is...Again, forgive my negativity but I can't help but be happy seeing you all suffer.

Elon is more interested in selling DOGE than TSLA.Doesn’t help that TSLA bought a ton of BTC which he isn’t pumping. An already bloated company valuation is seeing its leader on SNL instead of maintaining Tesla’s competitive edge.

"""going to the moon very soon."" Elon Mush"
This morning Jim Cramer said something very interesting. He said TSLA has no EBITDA or almost zero EBITDA like WorldCom because TSLA investors don't demand EBITDA just like WorldCom investors didn't demand EBITDA.
Go TSLA！！
TSLA cheated on earnings. Major earning came out of trading in bitcoins which is not core business of tesla. I now understand why Elon favors cryptocurrency and bitcoin. It is a support he provides to manipulate tesla earnings when car sales is not enough to justify earnings. This will be exposed and new scandal will hit the headlines soon.
"Chinese state controlled Global Times just tweeted: ""Despite record earnings in Q1, #Tesla's sales in China are expected to drop sharply in the coming months due to a public relations crisis that has put the image of the otherwise popular brand at serious risk."" Tesla is toast."

The extended range F-150 Lighting comes with an 80 amp charger connector for your home. I wired my new house for 80 amp and then Tesla stopped selling the higher current connector and the new one tops out at 48 amp. I can buy an older connector with a 24 ft cable on ebay for twice the price of the newer one. Now I am wondering if I should get the F-150 lightening instead of the cybertruck. I hate that 48 amp charge rate. Why did they lower it?
Oh no! Raising capital gains taxes on income over a million. What a kick in the teeth to the super wealthy. The republicans vague idea about raising “user fees” and tolls (which would raise revenue off some guy who just wants to get to work in the morning) is so much better. Why not just tax the poor? Oh that’s right they don’t have any money hence “poor.”

"Tesla bulls have basically one mind-frame which always boils down to ""but the stock price always goes up."" These kids actually think it's completely normal for a stock to increase 800% in one year even though the company's fundamentals have barely changed at all. If you do some research on the history of financial markets, you will learn something about the nature of bubbles. Ask your parents what happened in 2000, ask your grandparents what happened in the 70's and late 80's, and ask your great grandparents what happened in the 30's. It's all fun and games until the music stops."

I don't understand why FSD cannot be transfered. If it cannot be transferred it has no intrinsic value. That is why I did not order it. If I want it later I will subscribe. Look at all the people who bought it then sold the car so they paid for nothing.

"Texas police will serve search warrants on Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) on Tuesday to secure data from a fatal vehicle crash, a senior officer told Reuters on Monday, after CEO Elon Musk said company checks showed the car’s Autopilot driver assistance system was not engaged.Mark Herman, Harris County Constable Precinct 4, said evidence including witness statements clearly indicated there was nobody in the driver's seat of the Model S when it crashed into a tree, killing two people, on Saturday night.Herman said a tweet by Musk on Monday afternoon, saying that data logs retrieved by the company so far ruled out the use of the Autopilot system, was the first officials had heard from the company.""If he is tweeting that out, if he has already pulled the data, he hasn’t told us that,"" Herman told Reuters. ""We will eagerly wait for that data.""The crash is the 28th Telsa accident to be investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which regulates vehicle safety.It is also being probed by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which removed Tesla as a party to an earlier investigation into a fatal crash in 2018 after the company made public details of the probe without authorisation.In Saturday's accident, the 2019 Tesla Model S was traveling at high-speed near Houston when it failed to negotiate a curve and went off the road, crashing into a tree and bursting into flames, Herman said.Authorities found the bodies of two men in the car, one in the front passenger seat and the owner of the car in the backseat.""We have witness statements from people that said they left to test drive the vehicle without a driver and to show the friend how it can drive itself,"" Herman said."
"For all those who lost a Tesla or more in net worth today due to TechnoKings flip flop and thin skin, will you hold or purchase his stock or buy his car? From a purely investment standpoint, I’m actually now interested in GM or maybe VW in this space. A stock that had no fundamental justification for its market cap just lost the hidden element that kept it flying. . . faith. Fighting gravity might work for space x/ govt contacts, but it is not going to be friendly to a momentum priced business that needs tech savvy customers to buy its expensive commodity. Good luck to the longs but think through this one given the current price and self inflicted circus."
"AS AN INVESTOR... DO YOU WANT A CEO TWEETING OUT ""DIAMOND HANDS"" TO CROWD SOURCED MARKET MANIPULATORS?"
So now we know how Tesla will make its delivery numbers for the quarter: double charging customers. They will delay the refunds until after the 31st.
Thumbs up if we see $700 this week
Will close the week above $740
Wow no exit strategy for shorts. Earnings call in Monday stocks already on the rise shorts risk a good report and mind boggling updates on future revenue. Big one for me will be how much revenue they can expect from FSD as a monthly subscription. I’ve had limited autopilot on my model 3 I did not buy it on my model Y so as to keep under the 55k price limit for my state rebate. Now 10k to add it sounds like a lot but 150-200 a month that I would buy and so will thousands of other Tesla owners ! No throw in leaked info on parts suppliers looking to supply ENOUGH for 1 MILLION vehicles well that’s insane. Add Austin and Berlin and look out !
"Tsla will bounce back seriously these days, all you bashers will hide into mice holes"
"down today, upgrades tomorrow. don't bet against musk"
The story is not complete. Autopilot disengages as soon as the seatbelt is unbuckled. So if it is accurate them these 2 passengers had to take extra steps to trick the software.I am not sure but Tesla may even have the weight on seat sensor to disengage autopilot as well which in that case ll make this entire police story premature and irresponsible to make statement before full investigation is complete
TSLA earnings will be extremely good. But what happens after? Are we in for higher volatility after earnings are reported?
SHORTS! DO THE MATH PRE-SPLIT and see how much longs have made VS Shorts losses.THEN YOU WILL KNOW WHY LONGS HAVE NO FEAR ON DIPS. 
They had some interesting insights about TSLA on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.

"What are the chances of so-called ""FSD"" software being ruled ""illegal"" irrespective of driver having the hand on the wheel or not? Goes without saying in this case, he wasn't even seated at the driver' seat. Should Tesla be allowed to put non-Tesla drivers/passengers at risk till its so-called ""FSD"" software is thoroughly vetted by independent experts and actually becomes ""FSD"", which in all likelihood will take years, plus various regulatory clearances???"
at least +4 or +5% today
Relax everyone there’s just some profit taking. This may go down below $730 this week but will go back up before earnings. Should be above $800 before earnings.

Has anyone seen the neighborhood where the crash occurred? This is really strange? Looks like the car had a couple of blocks in which to get moving in before impact. The vehicle had to be moving fairly fast to compromise the battery pack from a frontal impact with a tree. Maybe it hit something prior to impact on the underside? The road is curvy. Very strange. Photo I saw was posted on Electrek.

"Bloomberg: Tesla Inc. is about to lose one source of the regulatory-credit revenue that’s been crucial to its almost two-year run of consecutive quarterly profits.Stellantis NV, the automaker formed through the merger of PSA Group and Fiat Chrysler, is exiting a European emissions-credit agreement with Tesla in a move that will have a positive impact on earnings this year. Chief Executive Officer Carlos Tavares first announced the plan in an interview with the French weekly Le Point.“Stellantis will be in a position to achieve CO2 targets in Europe for 2021 without open passenger-car pooling arrangements with other automakers,” the company said in an emailed statement Wednesday. A Tesla representative didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Tesla has steadily increased sales of regulatory credits to carmakers that need help complying with emissions standards that are getting stricter in Europe, China and the U.S. The revenue goes straight to the electric-car maker’s bottom line and has routinely exceeded net income on a generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, basis. Without the credit sales in recent quarters, the company would have recorded losses."

"Once Giga Texas is in production and pent up demand for Cyber Truck and Sedans [Y and 3] is satisfied, I hope Elon comes up with a more user friendly SUV or Pick Up for the technologically challenged [like me and my employees ] Hate to say it but more familiar controls and gauges that we are accustomed t would be nice.. See the VW and Ford Mach 1 as examples .Even though they call the Y an SUV , I still feel it is more of a hatchback . We'll see what the designers come up with next. The rest of the industry still has a lot of catching up to do , but will sell a lot of EVs because they know their customers and will produce EVs that they will be comfortable with. Elon's plate is getting a lot fuller , I hope he stays focused on the huge responsibility of running multiple huge enterprises."

Why is Tesla overvalued? I'm still new.
"c'mon folks, Tesla has never been a stock that traded on ""traditional"" metrics. Never. Musk is brilliant for sure and has single-handedly ""shown the way"" for the other major car manufactures how to enter the EV market. But when you try and reason as to why the stock trades at a PE which exceeds its current share price by a factor of at least 3, it's impossible to do. This is an emotional, feel good trade at these levels - and as long as there are traders who convince themselves that the future earnings of this company discounted back to todays $'s justifies the price? The shares will trade at that price. I'm not an EV purchaser, but I do marvel at how Tesla has been able to build a brand without earnings and how Musk with his ability has been able to keep the conversation always looking into the future such as production figures, and what Tesla will become, etc., vs. a lack of current operating income and what is actually going on today."
Sold some Tesla shares today and bought more ethereum
But Cathy said 3000!!
Any bull left here? I need company
The other way to look at this company is to ask what would be the price of Tesla without Musk? I’d guess $50 /share maximum. All the rest is the manipulation of this irresponsible (almost criminal) CEO
"EPS of 90 cents on revenue of $10.39 billion.Tesla delivered 184,800 vehicles in Q1, up 109% and beating estimates for 168,000. The EV maker posted EPS of 80 cents in Q4, its fifth straight quarter of earnings growth."
"Does GM or Ford take this much heat when someone crashes using cruise control? This is a non-story.. Sorry people died, but you need to pay attention when driving, no matter what you drive. Driver error, not vehicle error."
Great day 
I heard about TSLA the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Selling is on a High Volume compared to Buying. SELL SELL SELL!
Besides $TSLA RKT is by far is the easiest slam dunk in my lifetime.

"Tesla and GM roughly have the same EPS going out to 2023 and GM'S at 58 and Tesla's at 740. Both companies will be big into EV's , could someone explain ?"
Well done to everyone that bought in at 715.. Diamond hands To the moon
Tesla is not in the business of selling cars. The cars are just a front for Tesla's core business of selling auto regulatory credits and pump & dumping crypto. What happens to Tesla's profitability when the auto reg credits and crypto pumps disappear?
Bought another 125 shares. Thanks for the cheap shares. Price target $1000 eoy and $2000 end of 2022. Let's go !!
"184,800 Q1 deliveries up 109% YOY. GREAT NUMBER, going higher next week. Sorry to the shorts u r losing everything. Close ur short & go long on Monday. That is if u have any capital left. I’ll pray for u on this “HOLY GOOD FRIDAY”. Thank You “JESUS”."
"Funny, buy the time the Socialists push thru their capital gains tax increase there won't be any capital gains left to tax. Then who pays for their boondoggles???"
"Another lie is debunked, this time by Chinese police themselves. Teslas were not prohibited from traveling on a highway in China. The FUD is coming fast and furious lately. That makes me extremely bullish and indicates legacy and Chinese competitors are losing bigly."

"GM === 60,000 third party charging plugs throughout the U.S. and Canada. GM is partnering with companies like Blink Charging and ChargePoint to create a coast to coast integrated system of 60,000 chargers. GM EVs will have a dashboard app to find chargers. Speculation: Most likely the retail sales will go to GM and GM will pay their partners a discounted price. More Speculation: This network is ripe for exploitation as a sales incentive. Tesla once offered free charging for life. I suspect GM will offer free charging for a 2-3 years. when they need to boost sales."
"today we welcome Mr. 500 , its long overdue , Next earnings are far away and it brings the newer competitive cars closer to the streets. Teslas lead is almost totally gone. The competitors started with a lot of battery knowledge and how to make things right the first time. What is Teslas real stock price estimated value . Well since it can't make money on cars and its an automobile company .... its worth errrrr maybe not that much .Elon I am sure is thinking of selling some of his shares before we go down another $100."
So easy to predict direction following Mr Burry’s bet on $tsla. I’m going with him and will be super rich..  wohhooo!!

"Be sure to invest in my Space Kite. Uses wind and solar to launch, solar winds to maintain orbit.

"Enron did about $80 billion of legitimate business the year before the company collapsed. It was a relatively small amount of accounting fraud ""at the top"" the brought the company down. Enron was hiding the true financial condition of the company from investors, just as I believe Tesla is doing. Much of both companies' business operations were/are real; it's just a case of the truth about the financial state of the company is being hidden from the public shareholders."
$TSLA is going up...
"Some reports are saying it is unknown if auto was even engaged and that speeding was involved. Some say nobody was in the driver's seat. Sounds like illegal and reckless behavior was involved. If you're going to blame Tesla for that, be consistent and blame other autos every time one of their vehicles is in an accident."

"I’m a TSLA bull but their solar roof business may be cut if they can’t pull a profit on it. They already had to raise the price of it substantially this year to try and turn a profit on it. It looks cool and the tech is there they just need to figure out what their issues are, solar panels will only get more efficient from here but hopefully their solar roof business can get their act together before then or then will be toast. The better business for them will be to stick with energy farms, these at least have better margins for them. All in all, the main things holding Tesla back from skyrocketing is manufacturing capacity, battery shortages, and supply chain issues. All of these are currently being addressed for them. Also, the headwinds are in their favor as far as government incentives and stricter regulations on ice vehicles. The future is Tesla, the question is how long is it going to take to pan out?"
900 TODAY??!!
Shorts must be starting to sweat lolBetter buy back before you lose the house!
"In 1Q21, Tesla had GAAP net income of $438.0 mill. That's only .39/sh diluted. Without much in the way of recurring revenues, how exactly is Tesla ever suppose to become profitable in a meaningful way? The self-driving revenue is years away from happening. Tesla doesn't seem to make much money on car sales or solar installations. Tesla doesn't make money on charging stations. I think Tesla's biggest profit center was selling tax credits but with others beginningto sell their own BEVs, this source of revenue will dry up. So how exactly is Tesla ever going to make decent EPS without any real recurring revenue and razor-thin profit margins?"
"No EV credit and no Bitcoin.What’s left for next earnings, Dodge ?"

Tesla is going to be back making new highs in the next 2 weeks following their record earnings call mark my words!
Boycott TSLA for crashing Bitcoin! I won't be buying anything with Elon Muses endorsements!
$50B pay package for Musk? 50 BILLION? WTH
I would vote so Elon Musk resigns as a CEO of Tesla and I would send him to the Moon so that he would not harm Tesla stock.
Elon is an obsessive gambler. He puts toys in cars and then calls it autopilot. He collects money through Tesla and plays Bitcoin with it. His cars and bitcoin crash. What's going to happen to Tesla stock? Is replacing Elon not an option for the supervisory board?
Don't get it. Why the fall? As I see they corrected a lot of things. And they even beat the analyst expectations? Isn't this when the stock should go up? Or where is the problem? Help me see it.

ok.... let's see what max pain for today is..... hmm.... looks like $780... yep. straight to max pain... up 2.32% on news that Elon has told regulators a different story about FSD than investors.... nothing wrong with that... right?
The true Tesla fanboys have already loaded up to 100% position on Tesla; there are no buyers left and we continue to drift lower.
really bad slide. not gonna stop if earnings can't bring them above water. broke support levels and 10 yr bond yields increasing making a growth company like TSLA very hard to trust. awesome company but they need a lot more support than the resistance it's currently facing.
Love the negative sentiment. Means we’re heading for big run!!!

This can cost 57 and still would be expensive.
we could see high 7 almost 800 today we are ending the wedge pattern that was going into this month. let's hope we can break a high this week
"Can anyone translate ""already in production"" from Elon speak? Asking for Model S and X refresh buyers."

"It may be worth noting that competition is coming. In Europe last quarter, the top 8 vendors of EVs represented just over 2/3 of sales. Two years ago, that same group represented 95% of sales. Tesla is facing increasing and entrenched competition and it’s going to increase dramatically. Guru."
Yall remember that episode of the Simpsons where Bart was driving the  with his friends and he hopped in the back seat because he threw the cruise control on? This kind of reminds me of that...
I LOVE TESLA!!
"The downside of the good sales numbers is TSLA is moving one step closer to owing Musk yet another tranche of his option grant. There are 8 revenue targets and 8 adjusted EBITA targets; each target achieved entitles Musk to an additional tranche (up to a maximum of 12).The revenue tranches are the more difficult. TSLA was expected to achieve the $35 billion revenue target this year which is only about 10% above 2020 revenues. It had appeared that TSLA might achieve the $55 billion target in 2022. It now seems possible that TSLA could achieve it in 2021, and in any case no later than 2022.The next revenue level is $75 billion, which is about 250% of 2020 revenue. This seems attainable if TSLA can sell 1.5 million vehicles in 2022.This would bring Musk up to 8 tranches of grants by the end of 2021, with an excellent chance of earning all 12 by the end of 2022.He is a very expensive CEO.Each tranche is worth over $5 billion to Musk at current TSLA prices. (TSLA's accounting for it has a way of posting a much smaller expense on its books, but $5 billion is a fair measure of the cost to shareholders)."
The Tesla bandwagon is over. Hop onto the next big one $CCIV!
The train is leaving
Who's up huge today with both Tesla and Bitcoin???

"Have a new Tesla and just added another home solar system more than doubling KWHs. Solar companies now participate with utility’s programs where owners are eligible to add additional solar with all the same incentives. This enables using multiple systems. The house now has 2 owned and 2 leased separate solar systems. Part of the reason the new system is much larger is for charging the Tesla and a deposit on a Cybertruck. Also, the 15 year old original systems is producing less power. Of course, to qualify the site must have the available space, optimum sun orientation, structural and and upgraded wiring systems that meet local building code requirements. Also, availability of programs may vary by state. Utility rates are continually rising as are fuel prices. Still considering adding a Powerwall."
"Tesla could sell 1 million cars by 2021, Cathy largest position is Tesla still , Pelosi bough millions of Tesla stock, IBD, Motley, and Benzinga have Tesla as the one of top Stocks about to breakout"
Musk holds largest short position against Tesla 
"Cathy Woods attributed 1/3 of Tesla's staggeringly high Stock price to the future value of Robo-Taxis but Tesla does not yet have the capability to manufacture them yet and that is not addressing current issues TESLA is now having with it's own FSD and AUTOPILOT. The problem is that Tesla sells something that is under development as working (can you say class action lawsuit ?). However GM does have real FSD with ""Supercruse"" and just sold 4000 auto-taxi's to Dubai (the first country outside of the US to made FSD legal). ..that is ""real full self driving that works today without a steering wheel. GM will eventually overtake TSLA Share price when apples are apples."
its hilarious watching the shorts get head faked over and over again.......tesla the great short tease
"The thing with Elon is he can tend to cut corners ..... Tesla, has disbanded its press office, did not respond to a request for comment from The Independent before time of publication.Tesla’s Autopilot partially automated system can keep a car centred in its lane, keep a distance from cars in front of it, and can even change lanes on its own with a driver’s consent. But Tesla has said the driver must be ready to intervene at all times.Consumer Reports said that during several trips on its closed tracks with an empty driver’s seat, its Tesla Model Y automatically steered along painted lane lines without acknowledging that nobody was at the controls.In the Consumer Reports test, Fisher said he engaged Autopilot while the car was in motion on the track, then set the speed dial to zero to stop it. Fisher then affixed a small, weighted chain on the steering wheel to simulate the weight of a driver’s hand. He then slid over into the front passenger seat where he was able to accelerate and decelerate the vehicle.“The car drove up and down the half-mile lane of our track, repeatedly, never noting that no one was in the driver’s seat, never noting that there was no one touching the steering wheel, never noting there was no weight on the seat,” Fisher said. “It was a bit frightening when we realized how easy it was to defeat the safeguards, which we proved were clearly insufficient.”Consumer Reports noted the test was performed on its closed track and that “under no circumstances should anyone try” to duplicate it.""Let me be clear: Anyone who uses Autopilot on the road without someone in the driver seat is putting themselves and others in imminent danger,"" Fisher said."
Here is a few facts. Tesla reduced their debt. Tesla made $1 billion this Qtr. Tesla is growing at 50% a year. Wallstreet is still trying to figure it out...
"$MARA is the most oversold stock currently, easy 20% gain. Much better than $TSLA or $APPL or $COIN or $SPCE"
feds could arrest musk any day now.
Here it goes to $790 and $830 at pre market tomorrow.
"Tesla reported record net income of $438 million during the quarter, as well as earnings of 93 cents per share on $10.39 billion in revenue."
"Good news, Elon Musk says Autopilot not enabled in fatal Tesla crash"
I have a gut feeling that TESLA will be getting alot of crypto lawsuits soon
These seem criminally undervalued here $cciv $goev $vldr meanwhile$tsla $gm criminally overvalued
"Gosh, down over 3%. Starting to get a clue about how the PE ratio gets back to normal? Please fanbois, don't be holding the bag when the elevator drops."
Wait a minute. I thought they told everyone to switch to recovery stocks.
What Is Price-to-Earnings Ratio – P/E Ratio?The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is the ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its per-share earnings (EPS). A high P/E ratio mean that a company's stock is over-valued.TSLA: PE Ratio (TTM)572.99 ONLY -> Not that much compare to Bitcoin.
"According to Tesla website they produced 179,757 in q4 2020 and in q1 2021 180338 about 550 cars more than previous quarter. that is huge growth of over 0.3%. Also according to Tesla website they delivered in 2020 about 449500 but produced 509737 which should leave them with 10000 unsold inventory before q1. These are just a numbers and do not shoot the messenger."
"((( fully autonomous ride-hailing (robotaxi) service that is expected to generate some $327 billion in 2025 ))The four part logic : - Assume that going from $0.00 revenues to $327,000,000,000 in 4 years is typical in the taxi industry. - Assume FSD is going to work in 4 years - even though you know its not. - Assume FSD will be generally legal in 2025 - even though it is 100% illegal today. - Completely and absolutely ignore the real world where UBER lost $2 billion in 2018, $8 billion in 2019, and $7 billion in 2020."
Who holds a bag today? Elon says 1m robotaxies by 2021. Oh wait.
"The little country of Norway has done a fantastic job of moving forward the cause of BEVs. They have been a proponent for a very long time, and Tesla (and Nissan, VW, BMW and others) used this little country as a test market.Tesla came to the game a little late (2017), but has really overwhelmed the country with their cars. So how is that going?Tesla has sold 60,994 BEVs in Norway. Norwegians have purchased 387,531 BEVs according to government statistics. Tesla has a 15% share of that market as of this afternoon. Unfortunately, their share is growing much slower than the market, at just 9% for 2021. It's just more evidence that competition is coming and Tesla will have great difficulty sustaining anything close to their current market share in the future.Guru."
"Free with every FSD order. Two Tesla caps, embroiled with yellow and black crash test dummy symbols."
"Cars - losing $800 per vehicle once carbon credits and bitcoin are backed out.Insurance - no profit. Tesla only insures their own vehicles as a necessity because other companies won't.Solar Roofs - Tesla's roofs cost 3X more than SunPower or anyone else, plus all the kinks aren't worked out yet.FSD - an expensive option that most Tesla owners can't even afford. Strictly a niche product.Fully Autonomous Driving. Turned out to be hype. Still a long ways away, and Tesla isn't even the leader.Autonomous Robo-Taxi Fleet - Um, no. Just no. Semi Trucks. Years behind schedule.""Affordable"" Sedan - just in the Musk-Hype stage at this point. May or may not materialize in 3 to 5 years.CyberTruck - due in December, which means a few will be sold the last week of 2021. Plenty of competition - will be another niche offering. Not suitable as a working man's truck or a fleet vehicle.Charging Network - Plenty of competition from ChargePoint, Blink and others.Storage - The only bright spot in Tesla's product line besides cars, but not profitable yet and plenty of competition.At this point Tesla is still just an unprofitable car company. They may get a boost from the Infrastructure Plan, but ultimately their $750B market cap needs to come into alignment with VW, GM, Ford, and Toyota. So either those companies' stocks need to increase 3X to 8X or Tesla's stock price needs to drop by 70% to 90%."
I tested my autopilot on the way home today. The instant I unbuckled my seatbelt autopilot went nuts flashing beeping screaming at me also slowed the car down and would have taken me to the side of the highway and put my flashers on. The response was instant. I have a feeling there will be a lot more to come on this crash. No way a 60 year old would be stupid enough to try to create a driverless test ride. No way at all. If it were some you stupid kids out on a dare then maybe. Shame on the cop and big time shame on CNBC for running so many stories with so much bait clicking TESLA should Sue that police department and CNBC fir such hasty reporting.
It looks like 2019 all over again. A so called analyst comes early in the morning to say TSLA should drop 70% but the stock go even higher. I love it.
I feel the media making big show about single Tesla crash. With results in another six days shares will soon go and touch Mars... don’t shot and get caught
Predictions for tomorrow given Musks recent tweets?
Overall sentiment is bearish and looks like shorts are piling in on puts. you can smell squeeze from that miles away. as long as psychological support at $500 holds of course.
"I think the short is going to be in great pain , once it break up at $700 in the blink of an eye."
Sold my $TSLA and bought $NOK. I like this!!!
Seems like good numbers to me! Also raising car prices shows company’s confidence!
"We destroyed the shorties last year. This year Elon is super rich, and us super poor. Buy at the open and sell later today at 540. we love losses."
"Your face when you learn that your brand new $250,000 Ferrari Roma can't even accelerate as quickly as a $56,990 Tesla Model 3 Performance."
telsa has already delivered 193k cars as of Friday last week. Plus bitcoin profits.... It's going to be a huge quarter.
"Hah, I remember less than a year ago being sick of the resistance @ 420 and now we have support @ $700. I love this TSLA stonk thing. Meanwhile our factories are getting closer to being finished and we are still making money."
Coiled like a spring! $800 today!
If tesla thinks his stock is so great than why is he not doing buy backs on his stock instead of buying bitcoin so whats up folks he dosen't like his own stock or he knows its way overvalued..............
"I?m a Tesla bull, I?ve been holding the shares since 249.00 pre-split. However this Quarter has made me re#$%$ the holdings. I came to the conclusion that I won?t sell, i think they?ll be fine but this whole Bitcoin thing is what has me a bit worried. Yes it?s a weapon they could use to be profitable many quarters down the line but it?s not the Essence of the company and what they do. I dont know maybe things are becoming a bit to murky"
"Longs the moment will soon be here to decide if you want some profits or are going down with the ship. I get you didn't sell at 800, there was a lot of excitement and Tesla to 15,000 talk. At 400 you will be hesitant to sell because the stock will be cut in half you will believe is the bottom and it has to go up. Remember 400 is quadruple from 100.At 300 you surely will think is the bottom and won't sellAt 200 you will be feeling ill and (some of you will be holding at a loss), so you think you have no choice but to hold.At 100 you will be shocked and frozen like a deer in the headlights. At this point you will no longer sell and you will have held an asset for years with no gain."
I shouldn't have invested in this company...
What ever they will report: Tesla remains a profit underperformer. What would be exciting about a dollar quarterly profit at $700 stock value? The most overhyped stock ever.
Nice Spike today!!! These could see another huge spike in the near future. Go $SNDL $GTLL $HGEN $TSLA
I wouldn't buy this to hold long until it drops to 50 which is really 200 post split. That's still going to have a p/e of around 75 which is what it should have. The p/e of this is absurd. Tesla is a great company but stocks don't grow to the moon. There are two sides to every mountain.
"Struggling ! No Buyers ?.. whatever the Hype, hope it is true ! Look at the Executive Holdings. Amazon 10%, Starbux 3%, Tesla 0.1%... No Faith in their own company ? All the Options that mature are SOLD immediately. No holdng."
Sell! Or dont buy!
When this chat is majority negative sentiment it’s a good buy point. Means that everyone short is stressed and watching the price/board closely. Those are the types of investors you can squeeze out and make good $$. Just my opinion
Winners don’t come often when you are out there in the wild world of the markets. But all that can change if you join the right program. I joined up with these guys (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Now I am having solid picks every week.
"CPI numbers tomorrow morning. The street is expecting 3.6% rise in inflation, biggest jump in 10 years. It’s gonna sell off tomorrow"
Bought Amazon $240 sold at $460 it was overvalued. Netflix at $97 sold at $250 again it was over valued. Bought FB at $60 sold at $150 again it was over valued. I bought Tesla at $38 is it overvalued ?? I don’t think so I’m not making that mistake ever again.
"Relax folks.... Musk has this company on the right track. Nervous hands are exiting. After that there will be a steady rise. Not seeing north of $900, though $850 +/- is realistic in the next few weeks."
Understand clearly would solve what the problems tesla solves tesla solves the energy distribution cost which is gargantuan enormous the cost of oil add the refinery that’s after extraction and refinery is under $16 per barrel that is nothing nothing and that is the reason why by switching to electric vehicles any nation including the United States will save At least 70% in energy costs just from the switch that money can go to gross domestic production and become a bonanza for any economy that adopt electric transportation. That includes any country any city in the town any home anyone adopt adopting Electric transportation and replacing combustion with it will flourishThis is what tesla solves not pollution efficiency efficiency in energy distribution solving pollution it’s a collateral benefit
Musk needs vrought back to earth and stop playing around with other people's money
earnings fake and competition is growing
"Today -30 tomorrow-30 Thursday -30 Friday -30, yes this will be 120$ less"" better get out now and buy instead NIO!!"
Don’t believe what they’re saying! This forum keep pouring fake news to bring Tesla down. Just wait and see you will be regret soon!
Earnings call is next week I suspect MARGIN CALLS are the next squeeze. This dip just saved them a bunch Should be a blood bath come Friday. Rinse and Repeat. Until CyberTruck rolls off the Austin line
"Folks, take a quick break from your $h!tposting and take a look at this data... and then tell me we are not in the middle of an epic margin debt bubble. https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2021/04/19/margin-debt-and-the-market-up-another-1-1-in-march-continues-record-trend"

"The longs on this board live in an alternate reality, the world where because THEY bought this hyped stock they will naturally and surely become beautiful, sexy, and rich. The world does not OWE everybody a trophy, especially not to the delusional pie in the sky crowd."
Here come the downgrades! BofA lowered the price target by almost 30%
Why a stock with $36/share CASH trading $7/share????? Can any expert explain ???? 【CREG】---------
I bought a Model 3 Performance and it made my 2012 E class Benz feel old fashioned and slow!
1071 price target means 1.028T Cap in one year.
"((( 2020 California registrations for Tesla’s Model 3 mass-market sedan fell 34% on a yearly basis to 7,044. )) Let me guess - chip shortages."
Now the Low price target for Tesla on the Yahoo landing page is $67. That still beats GM which is sube $60. Using VW evaluation you get close to $100.
"time to buy, add more shares at this discounted price,,, everyone knows Tesla and Nio Will fly to the moon.."
"This got to be one of the biggest options haul I seen from (TSLA) has to be over $10 Billion, a very good payday for the boys on wall street, and that's only from 1 stock, Booyah."
"Elon Musk decided to give away bitcoins in order for their value to rise to record highs and exceed $ 100,000  https://elonship.me"
epic short squeeze coming very soon. those dpshts never learn
How much of the 93 cents EPS was due to Musk selling bitcoin?
"P/E of 2400, only profit from government subsidies, investing in Bitcoin instead of the company, China sales down 30%. The ARK fund led by Cathie Deadwood and USS Tesla with Felon Musk going quickly to bankruptcy. Time to panic and get what you can instead of catching a falling knife."
If F150 release today creates some stir Tesla will lose the truck market
Lol
"I,v had 49 shares but I sold them -5000 and bought game with that money and made 10000 in 2 days. Yes Tesla is good investment but it’s F stressful from 900 to drop 590-600. Will I feel bad if this takes of on Monday maybe. But it’s will drop again when cathie woods mentioned "
Anyone know how many Bitcoins Elon sold to cover for the gap in earnings?
I love Tesla and musk
"What happened this board, no posting, no news? May be all the people not interested in TSLA any more?"
"Nice pop holding up after profit-taking. I expect a late afternoon rise like we’ve seen so often with TSLA. With major analysts anticipating 950-1300, it’s a waiting game a few percentage points a day."
Why would anyone want to hold this Ponzi scheme when they can buy a real company like MSFT?
Maybe Musk should focus on running his company instead of tweeting about whatever coin and going on SNL?
Cathie back to the drawing board !!
"The nasdaq is in sharp correction right now. Lot of fast growth tech companies are in big decline, Nio is -9%, qs is -15%, zm is -8%. Tsla is down less because of its S&P status. But long term tech will always outperform, simply because that is what the US is good at --- technology and innovation."
Someone said we could see $500 before we see $600 again. Is that true?
The 200 day Moving Average is 655.05. If it closes below that it makes a major death cross. The begins the dive to 490 to 420.
Shorts are sure out in full force! FACTS: No one in here knows where this stock is going. Those who are bashing it are shorts or trolls. Those who are hyping it are growth investors. Don't listen to either in here.
Monday will hit $850
"Longs here have done a nice job riding up the bubble, but ultimately the stock will reflect the true intrinsic value of the company, which is about 10% of the current price."
"Does anyone else find it disturbing that the CEO is Tweeting about data involving a crash where people died? A good CEO would work start by showing a little sympathy for the victims and family, and work with authorities behind the scenes and then let the data come out naturally. I wouldn't want the CEO of Tesla tweeting about a crash my family was involved in."
felon is still at large
"A decent merchant procure critical expansion to the Board.If you need venture thoughts from genuine learned brokers, and financial backers look at him on telegram @AndrewKreiger212"
"TSLA/Musk now seems to have said, TSLA is charging $10,000 for Full Self Driving capability that doesn’t exist.USE TESLA FULL SELF DRIVING AT YOUR OWN RISK.......we at TSLA don’t believe it’s safe"
"Did you see this?""Turkey bans the use of cryptocurrencies and crypto assets to purchase goods and services. The crypto market in the country had gained momentum recently, due to spiking inflation and lira weakness.""They are banning the parallel currency. There might be other countrys with weak currencies, that want to ban cryptocurrencies too."
It was a good quarter but Tesla is actually dropping￼? Have people actually stopped and taken a look at the valuation they assigned to a single car company￼?
Michael Burry bets half a billion dollars against Tesla.
"If interest rates go up a everyone is predicting and even yellen is asking for, this thing will collapse like a cheap soufflé"
"Here is my question and i really wanna have an answer. If you buy tesla now at 700 dollars at share you expect that to x2 in next 2 years or this year? I just wanna understand the brain under logic which i hope someone will give me. My logic is, this is great company, great CEO, disturbing auto industry, solar and bla bla bla. But didnt you already price that in? It have a huge market cap, and still need to prove a lot. My biggest concern is risk/reward, right now buying at this level have no sense, expect you wanna wait next 5 years and even that a lot of stuff can go wrong and you can find much beter options. I am concern about volswagen who will be bif competitor. I will like some bulls to explain me there teasis, but my point is that we are already well priced in."
"Really looking forward to their earnings. There is a reason why Telsa just doubled their solar panel cost...accounting trick, they are able to double their receivables...inflating their balance sheet. Remember the deliveries? all were their low margin vehicles. Samsung tried to outfox Apple years ago using this technique...market share means nothing if you are not making money! We shall see."
"P/E of 2400, only profit from government subsidies, investing in Bitcoin instead of the company, Cathie Deadwood and Felon Musk saying $3000 per share, China sales down 30%. Time to abandon ship or take my investment bankers advice."

Tesla will be $1000 end of the year
i own none. but this baby is gonna ROCK on monday!!! up 120 bucks ???
I hate to say it from a morale perspective but the current COVID crisis in India would most likely prompt a faster acceptance of TSLA into in order to boost GDP. Good news for TSLA holders though.
Lot people buying $800 Call option on Friday. Call option got tripled. Next 3 weeks Heavy Earning week Market go higher. I will buy Monday $800 call Option for next week
"Im hearing $200... going once, going twice..."
"The Chinese state are deliberately constantly doing Tesla down - This from globaltimes""While releasing record first-quarter earnings on Monday (US time), Tesla CEO Elon Musk avoided any specific mention of the Chinese market, in an apparent attempt to brush its public relations crisis in China under the carpet - a notable sharp contrast to his previous high-profile emphasis on the Chinese market.That reflected a delicate and sensitive time for the US-based automaker, as it faces a reputational challenge in one of its most crucial markets over suspected quality issues of its cars and a widely criticized public relations strategy. Tesla is still betting big on the Chinese market. But its sales in China are doomed to experience a sharp fall in the second quarter and its global sales could also be affected, analysts warned.....""So if Tesla falls in China, loses market share in Europe (with the much delayed Berlin factory) and stagnates in the US ( with Ford Mach E doing well), what's the point in holding Tesla? All future shocks will be to the downside."
remember they lost over 100 million without tax credits and bitcoin sales
If it can get close to 750’s today Monday will be a nice day for those who are patient
Don’t sell to the shorts
Elon musk on Saturday night live will be free Tesla marketing
Heavily over valued
Buying quite a few shares today
"A dangerous position to be in, is to know enough about an industry of which you heavily invest, to think you're right, but not enough, to know you're wrong."
This will gap open tomorrow. Analysts will upgrade it before market opens tomorrow.
Buy Alert
Out Bitcoin investment is doing fantastic today
"My hat goes off to the lucky dude(s) who just bought a Tesla with BTC-USD at $64,642. You are my heroes. Not only did you buy at the peak, and pass the subsequent 25% depreciation onto Tesla, your purchase will soon be worth 3X what you paid for it, once FSD level 5 is approved. Savvy accounting geniuses, you little financial gurus."
The Germany minister of economy has spoken up against the rumours of Berlin delaying 6 months.
TSLA to pop to $832 by end of day.
The only reason TESLA made money is because he bought Bitcoin. LOL.
"Anyone remember this? Bears leave a nice record of how wrong they are, which I'm sure they'd like people to forget, but here's a reminder: ""Why Projections For Tesla To Sell 500,000 Cars In 2020 Are Absurd"" <== Just Google this.""If Tesla sells 35,000 cars this year, 500,000 sales in 2020 would imply a six-year CAGR of 56%.""""No complex product manufacturer has ever grown that quickly from a revenue base of $3 billion or more.""-- Mark B. SpiegelTesla should only produce 186,000 cars in 2020. It did almost that much last quarter. Oops."
"As others in addition to myself called yesterday, we saw the bottom. Nothing better than watching shorts lose money. I love it because shorts want businesses to fail which in turn costs jobs and hurts communities and small businesses which depend on the larger corporations to succeed. No doubt Tesla will be volatile for years to come, but I have no doubt it will be the world's most profitable company in the coming years both in terms of total revenue and per share earnings. Looking forward to a good day."
Low volume sell. It will be back like $TSLA did today. unreasonable sell off!
TSLA to the MARS
“ they do move in herds “
"Somebody help out a simple-minded long investor (vs trader)... Why would anyone buy stock in a mature company at a P/E at roughly 1000? What will Tesla do to generate 50 times the business that they have now, to justify the valuation? Do people realize that 'real' auto manufacturers are just biding their time until the demand for EVs actually makes them profitable (Tesla is showing EVs to be not so profitable so far). I see Tesla doing R&D that will help mankind, and the other automakers, but not the Tesla shareholders. I must be missing something..."

$800.00 again this week watch.
Blowout earnings and $40 Billion SHORTS SQUEEZE payout!!!!!!!
Market maker knows a lot of order to cover and buy before the close. Buy buy before hedgies cover. 700 is cheap vs all car delivered in Q1 + Semis and cybertruck on the way. Expect 1200 breakout before earning by end of April. The same for AAPL and AMZN. Big correction on tech
Well we'll well what we got here finally is the bitter truth about the overhyped way overpriced $TSLA vs the local high end EV brands in China.$TSLA $NIO $XPEV
just bought !!!
Can't believe this scam moves with cryptos
"About 10% more deliveries than average analyst estimates?Don't forget that earnings are where the rubber meets the road, not the sales numbers. Wait and see if the profit per sale is holding up."
"This is so Fin sickening and it's been going on for about 90+ days. DOW hits record highs yet my entire watch list (over 65+ tickers) is red.DOW, DAQ & SP go up, most tickers are RedDOW, DAQ & SP go down, most, if not all are REDGreat News, Great ER, Great Deliveries .... Fin Manipulated down$NIO $XPEV $LI $TSLA"
"Everyone tells me how great the FSD of Tesla is but as the Yahoo video showed, GM has a fleet of AV’s making daily deliveries, and Tesla’s AVs not even on the road . Wake up the ponzu scheme is about to end."
"For those who imagine that TSLA is a sure investment because EV's are the way of the future, the words of Warren Buffet: ""To further his point, he also made the case for why it isn't even enough to know which industries will boom versus bust. He noted that the emerging U.S. auto industry of the early 1900s eventually saw over 2,000 auto companies formed.""Of course, you remember that in 2009, there were three left — two of which went bankrupt,"" he said. ""So, there is a lot more to picking stocks than figuring out what's going to be a wonderful industry in the future."""
I love this stock
Ironically the range on a ten year old Toyota Prius is still twice that of a new Tesla. LoL. No wonder he needs to sell his bitcoin lol
That stunt he pulled hurts the brand
So just let me get this right... Tesla isn’t selling any bitcoin but elon just dumped the price 10% (15% at the worst). Is he trying to screw over his shareholders. Other than buying more for himself at a cheaper cost what is the point of doing that and still holding bitcoin... unless this was a strategic plan to buy more didn’t he just make his own stock go down?
"TSLA may get battered in the short term but only an idiot thinks TSLA won't return to the highs and then roar past them over the long haul. With EVs not even yet close to serving their total addressable market, and TSLA's cars for the moment being superior to the competition, only an idiot thinks this stock is going to 0. The P/E will contract on its own over time through earnings without the stock having to crater. Shorts have the same thesis now that they did when the company first went public despite the fact the company's long term prospects continue to improve. Let's assume cars are TSLA's only business...even with new competition all TSLA has to do is maintain its market share and volume and revenues will multiply 17 times minimum. The idea TSLA won't continue to come out with new and improved cars over time too is a big fallacy. TSLA has a family of vehicles, not just one car. Now, let's add in the other dimensions to its business. TSLA also makes batteries, chips, and is a technology and solar company. Factoring all this in, it's easy to see why competition won't cause TSLA to implode, because the other car companies don't make their own batteries or chips. Betting against TSLA for the long haul is like betting the sun won't come up tomorrow. The decline from the highs has been on largely non company specific news. When it's the company itself that has a problem then shorts have an argument for an implosion. Right now they had better count their lucky stars. Soon the market will find its footing and TSLA will roar higher. Not a question of if it will but when."
"Musk under investigation again, fradulent stock compensations. You baggies paid for it!"
bought more today. sitting on 460 shares at 180.31 average per share. Tesla to 3000 before that 5x spilt again
"A chinese news report says an accident that killed a policeman was caused by the driver playing cell phone. Looks it's nothing to do with TSLA quality. TSLA has #1 EV quality. With more and more TSLA cars on the roads, accident reports are normal just like other cars. TSLA will jump!!!"
This is a very bullish animal well done Elon | Check this report out >>https://chart-analysis.tools/TSLA
Congratulations bears. It's down 4% today. All us Bulls are SOOO worried. 4% dip = time to sell. Except.... Wait a minute... I'm a long term investor! Oops. I bought the dip. What was I supposed to do bears? I forgot. You almost got me.
sell today buy chip tomorrow
This is gonna slide hard atOpen.. no good
Will go to $600+/shrs?... 50/50Betting Time to Double or Nothing!!!
"Folks the real question should be if battery powered EV’s should be allowed or not, period! I mean you read about gas driven cars crashing at speeds on upwards 120km per hours and people survive (not all of the times) but if they survive the collision they have a big chance of being kept safe by the vehicle. This f’ing junk seem to be a Carbeque flames up like a bomb with nothing left of the car. I mean how fast could be doing in a cul de sac hitting a tree?"
tesla always drops after earnings
A strong bounce could take this to over $650/share. But the downward trend will continue and maybe there won't be even a short lived bounce.
"So, by my calculations, trailing years earnings is now an even $1.00 (GAAP fully diluted). That brings the P/E down to something over 700. Hurrah!Actually, I am a bit puzzled by the computation of the CEO option compensation for Musk based on the 2018 grant. I thought the number would be bigger, but, I confess, how TSLA is cooking the books is beyond me.The reality is that Musk is getting a tremendous payout of which only a little seems to be booked as actual expense.I am a little, but not entirely surprised by the after hours drop. I was expecting more of a drop tomorrow."
TSLA shorts 
"tesla traders, switch to NIO for bigger gains"
Earnings call is on Monday options expire on Friday do we see a short squeeze this Friday ??? I hope so !And I hope all the CNBC / Yahoo finance people who slant stories against Tesla I hope they get crushed never in my life have I seen such lop sided reporting. Simply horrible
"The truth is on on a day 1) the market was down AND 2) the media pounded Tesla repeatedly, TSLA held up very well."
I'm thinking 670ish
"Must buy solar roof/panels together with Powerwall. Why, may I ask? Musk telling his customers what they want and need. Now, I can understand Tesla trying to educate it's customer, explaining what a great idea it is to bundle, but to force them to buy Powerwalls seems absurd. Desperation?"
VW gonna be the dragon slayer within the next 18 months. better price/yield out of the gate with a variety of offerings.
Estimates assume cash payment and a 5.7kW system. Roof and solar costs are inclusive of federal tax incentives. Cost of mid-range roofing material based on an average complexity roof installed by a licensed contractor. - in another words Tesla is simply a middle man.
Anyone who can get in under 600 will double their money by the end of the year.
"Falling back to the $563 support pre-market. Certainly, not looking strong, but it might hold again."
I said it before patience. Now are you happy that you held ? Where are the shorts ?
"Jim Kramer: ""...do not look around... just buy TESLA..."" https://www.thestreet.com/video"
Well let’s go
"At this point Tesla is lucky they are in the S&P 500, because without inclusion in index funds this stock would be falling 10X faster. This is now a slow-growth, institutional investment stock, not a exponential growth stock for individuals."
Big Green day tomorrow +40!!!
HERE IS IT IS 666 AGAIN
But but...it’s not a car company
"As noted in the Company's latest SEC filing, Bitfarms expects its mined Bitcoin inventory will grow to 1,000 Bitcoin within the next 50 days. To put it in context against the most popular crypto stock in the world (Coinbase), $COIN only holds 4487 BTC and has no plans of acquiring more. Meanwhile, BFARF are going to be growing their inventory consistently from now on.. meaning that by the end of the year, they could conceivably have more BTC than $COIN. The next targets would be $TSLA and $MSTR (which hold 48,000 bitcoin and 91,579 bitcoin respectively.) How long will it take for BitFarms to hold that kind of BTC supply? It may take some time, but consider $MSTR's holding, which constitutes a staggering 82% of Microstrategy’s valuation... That company trades at $693 today. If you're planning to hold $BFARF for the long-haul, remain dominant against $HUTMF, $RIOT, and $MARA.. $BTC-USD continues to rise, technology keeps advancing against difficulty increases and they're able to keep up the current rate of BTC production, the question of a NASDAQ listed $BFARF reaching a valuation similar to $MSTR is not a matter of if... but when. Currently trading at less than $5 a share, the more you know about BitFarms, the value proposition more than outweighs any potential risks."
WH declared settlement between LG and SK Inv and move forward with both plan to produce EV batteries in Georgia. The infrastructure spending includes $178B to boost EV market and to install at least half million charging stations. $wkhs $ride $tsla
"Close your eyes for ones imagine the whole world is running EVs and either Tesla or VW is the leader,now where Tesla would be trading,today who is the leader of cars Toyota how much its stock worth,remember as the EV market grows the value of that growth shrinks."

3% is not enough to sustain a reversal after many sessions in negative territory. And don’t forget it’s still in bear territory
"Gee, analysts think Tesla might make 0.8% profit by the end of 2022. That's tiny. You can make more on a CD."
"Told ya to buy yesterday, when bull run is expected, but ppl downvoted me. Too bad if u had listened to shorts. They always make wrong decisions."
"people seem to be stuck on the valuation as a car company.. forget that it's a car company, it's much more. will be a trillion in next couple years no doubt"
"I’d pay a premium for a growth stock like Tesla...but I’m thinking like a PE of 60, not 600. This has to go down as one of the most overvalued companies of all time."
Back to $500
"If Nasdaq & S&P pull up when market opens, it's going to rip upwards."
"""650 before the close"" ""700 tomorrow"" ""900 by end of the week"" ""800 by next monday"". These are not only delusional quotes, it is actually the price these buyers entered into the stock and expect to neutralize losses. Typical stage one of the bagholder: not recognizing the loss."
"I'm not trying to be funny, but in a few years we will be looking back and saying 'do you remember Tesla cars?' There are so many new EV options from other manufacturers, it's becoming a very busy space and other offerings are so much more attractive and this crash shows the huge liability risk attached to autonomous vehicles.Investing a huge lump of company dollars into the massively speculative bitcoin is just a distraction from the business, which is struggling to find direction, IMHO."
"No doubt it’s emerging in the market now. While it is penetrating, it is said that these other companies are positioning themselves in revolutionizing the alternative financial system. This could possibly bridge the gap between financial services and the unbanked sector. Also, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that the company could now accept Bitcoin as a payment for their new electric car. This one seemed so fantastic! Furthermore, these other companies seem to engage in the exploration of mineral properties in Canada."
"What's happening, is the market broken? Why all stocks go up just as they announce a tax hike for corporations from 21 to 28%???"
"Hold Tesla LOOONNNGGG! Yes, it's going up...and up and up! Hold strong people, hold strong! I'm in this for the long haul. $825 by the end of today? Possible."
"Elon is smart. He could bundle his other companies SpaceX, Neuralink and Boring companies into TSLA. He could make TSLA as a holding company like Alphabet for Google. That will make this a trillion dollar conglomerate. We are investing in ELON not just TSLA. I've been watching him from his Paypal days. He knows what he is doing. Just ride on his back."
I think we will see $800 in may or jun. and $1000 before end of year.
"Just for S&Gs, go to Tesla's website, and try to order a Model X. Let me know if you see anything a little odd?"
Tesla shorties are busy stocking on Ramen noodles because they know they're going to end up being poor AGAIN this year from shorting Tesla stock.

"CNBC said this was a buy at this price, strong sell signal."
"BTW, the stock bounced off of support at the 100 Avg. All the FUD failed to keep it below. That means pretty good support at 712.69 now."
According to JPM Chase Tesla is worth $75 a share
happens every time.......manipulation for the big dogs to get more shares at a cheaper price......this will push $750-780 level end of week
"Why is Elon fixated with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?. I think he knows well the cult has kidnapped Tesla and have made TSLA unsustainable. He needs to escape from these cult members and be free again. Meaning, cryptocurrencies will bring down TSLA and start giving respectability to Tesla by bringing down TSLA to a reasonable price ($100?)No position"

Both sides declaring victory? It only off less than 1% so everyone is still trying to figure it out. Amazing how manipulative the opinions on this board are.
"In a tweet late on Wednesday, Musk said that from next week, all sales of the company's solar-energy products will come with its energy-storage battery Powerwall. Let me know when Tesla energy sales at least account for 10 percent of revenue for this company that does more than just sell cars "
Why is this tanking???
Am I reading the 10k right? Without the $800M from energy credits and bitcoin profit they lost $200M? Ha! Some car company. Good thing retail investors don't understand finance.
"only 0,58%??? where are you longs wake up!"
"Is Elon on this forum? If not, could someone please forward my message to him. Thank you Elon Musk for putting the environment ahead of everything else. If we had more people like you we could save this planet and everyone on it. You'll go down as one of the most environmental friendly CEO the world has ever known. We applaud your efforts."
Tesla did not 'know' what they overcharged customers so they know what the car had or did not have? lol
"Tesla autonomous driving is a marketing fake from Elon musk, nothing else.The whole company is fake, pe 1200. A Tesla car with no one in the driver's seat reportedly crashed into a tree in Texas and burst into flames this weekend.What Happened: On Saturday, a Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) Model S crashed into a tree in Woodlands, Texas. No one was driving the vehicle, and two people were killed, Houston TV station KPRC reported.Harris County deputies said the vehicle was traveling at high speed, failed to take a turn at a cul-de-sac, ran off the road and hit the tree."
The one month chart is looking pretty triple diamond to me.
"1000 EOY3000 in 20257000 in 20309000 by 2040Yes FSD is a thing, we as a society are not going back. Implemented in various degree. In 10 yrs when over 70% of the infrastructure is in place in urban areas, we will have 100% robo taxi. In 15 yrs it will be everwhere planetwide.Insurance for FSD will be cheaper than if you drive yourself. Auto mfg will provide FSD insurance themselves.In 20 yrs FSD will be combined with FSF.The future is exciting. We will routinely live to 100 with many making it to 110 and Tesla and other Elon companies will be a big part of it all.If you could go back in time would you invest in Davinci? That's all an gonna say, your move."
EV related stocks in Shanghai Exchange looks extremely good today. Tesla will up 5-7% tomorrow.
Gotta love a CEO that throws his own shareholders under the bus and promotes Dodge-coin.
ALL HAIL LORD ELON
$NIO at $42 when $TSLA trading at $420..... So $NIO should trade now at $74 minimum......

Stock is expected to be shorted by Robin Hood Traders.$350.00 is the realistic price for TSLA.
short this stock for 5 years please..
Lets go guys lets squeeze these shorts :)
Shorts are giddy when it’s down 2.3%. That’s hardly anything and will be heading back up. Do you really want to bet against a cult status following? And a new administration that is pro EV tax credits?
"Sounds like their results were salvaged by sales in China. Thanks, Joe."
"Dum question - is TSLA (and all tech stocks) down because the Nasdaq is down, or is the Nasdaq down because tech stocks are down?"
"Breaking News!Since earnings came out TSLA longs have been forced to sit down and feast on humble ""told-ya-so"" pie, therefore we think it's time to hold the 1st annual ""laugh at a TSLA long"" party that we're naming ""The Electric Laugh Party"". Who wants to attend?Btw this is a different party from the scheduled ""TSLA @ $50 Bucks Party"".Thanks."
"TSLA is just like any other stock.When the markets are in a DOWNTREND, all stocks go down. No exceptions. Since it broke through 670, it's HEADED towards 600 for sure."
"I live in an apartment, where can I charge my E/V"
"With EQS out now and Porsche Tycan, BMW coming out soon can we all agree that Tesla will never sell one more unit of Model S? Hahahahah VW and Ford will be taking care of the Model 3 and Y. All the best to you all"
"I decided to Up Cathi's price to 5,000 per share and mean...if were going to pump may as well get the BIG PUMP...a MEGA PUMP...I mean no one else is doing is doing EV right...oh yeah...I forgot...don't even mention VW. Boolean"

"Will all Teslas giga battery plants be soon antiques ?A 40 year old problem solved: A long-lasting and stable solid-state lithium battery that can be charged 10,000 times or moreResearchers demonstrate a solution to a 40-year problemLong-lasting, quick-charging batteries are essential to the expansion of the electric vehicle market, but today’s lithium-ion batteries fall short of what’s needed — they’re too heavy, too expensive and take too long to charge.For decades, researchers have tried to harness the potential of solid-state, lithium-metal batteries, which hold substantially more energy in the same volume and charge in a fraction of the time compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries.“A lithium-metal battery is considered the holy grail for battery chemistry because of its high capacity and energy density,” said Xin Li, Associate Professor of Materials Science at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS). “But the stability of these batteries has always been poor.”Now, Li and his team have designed a stable, lithium-metal solid state battery that can be charged and discharged at least 10,000 times — far more cycles than have been previously demonstrated — at a high current density. The researchers paired the new design with a commercial high energy density cathode material."

Will this give it all up again today and finish red? Could happen.
I think we all see where this is heading. Glad I closed my short and went long!
"So what does Elon know and what does he say?A billionaire running a few companies is supposed to know what he's doing. When he bought bitcoin with shareholders money and sold his didn't he know that bitcoin need to be crunched? So he didn't knew that chip shortage is partly because of bitcoin mining? Well, pretty amazing if you can believe his lies."

Quick question: more losses today?
Musk farts and changes markets.
"Degradation of American IQ of masses is linearly correlated to increase of Solar Tesla Shingle Roof price.... For an 8.2 kilowatt (kW) system in northern California, Tesla estimates that the solar roof will cost $48,460 before incentives if you have an intermediately complex, 2,000 square foot roof. However, if you update your roof to be considered “complex,” the price increases to $54,940 and if your intermediately complex roof is 2,500 square feet instead of 2,000 square feet, the price jumps to $56,460. You can dig further into these calculations in our comparison of the cost of the solar roof vs. standard panels."
"Smashed records despite-Chinese new year-Mostly not selling the S and X because they're in the process of rolling out the refreshes of these models-Q1 traditionally weak for all auto makersAnd a first was achieved, q1 was a 2.34% increase over q4 2020. Before they never had an increase from q4 previous year to q1. The trend and momentum is clear."
Tesla should be sued into oblivion for their self driving negligence.
"Nice little bounce. I wouldn't mind seeing it go a bit higher as I am short on some $600 strike puts expiring today. (It was $650 strike puts that I was short just last week).If it really moves up today, it might be a time to buy some more puts as I have been selling some of my long put positions this week. (I try to be both long and short at all times. It's soothing psychologically."

Very impressive indeed.
"iQ Batteries for Electric Vehicles is what is going to start a boom in $IQST stock. Thin film batteries are light weight and can carry a charge as long if not longer than TSLA. Imagine an electric vehicle weighing less because the batteries do. That means longer distance mileage, and an opportunity for longer range smaller smart vehicles."
"About to short more of TSLA, but need to confirm: Can anyone determine if the yogurt machine has been installed (or about to) in Fremont yet? I'd hate to get caught in a bear trap, if this new broke right after opening a large short position."
"This set of financials is screaming something Wallstreet completely missed. Tesla doesn't need the regulatory credits! But since their competitors keep giving them money, here's what they did with it.In 2020 they collected 1.580b in credit sales. In January 2021 they bought 1.5b of btc, that is not a coincidence. Over ten weeks it appreciates to 2.5b, and they sell 10%. leaving them with 250m in cash and 2.25b in a cash equivalent asset. All this wealth creation was made possible by the generosity of their competitors."
"News events are used to create illusions by the establishment media and their collaborators in the investment community. They use these illusions push stocks both open and down according to their investment needs. The corporate media oligarchs are the brain and engine of this stock manipulation. They have collaborators in the government, among institutional investors, among secondary media outlets. Using the latest REAL news event concerning the Tesla collision/burning in Houston, we can see that the media oligarch engines driving this were using it to buy TESLA on the cheap while covering their Puts. They clearly understand that TESLA earnings and revenues for 2021 will be explosive because of the massive demand around the world for TESLA products couple with 4680 battery and storage battery technology as well as the giga die casting presses coming online in the next couple of quarters. This is a time to buy on the cheap and the Houston collision provided the excellent opportunity fabricate a wild bear illusion that permits them to buy on the cheap."

almost time to short TSLA again. RSI 43. need to go back down to 22.
people finally catching on to musk just being a showman...he should be a lot more worried about getting his backlog of products ready than worrying about cryptocurrency.
"Great financial fundamentals, great innovation and supply of EVs despite the shortage of chips; what a great company the Tesla !"
Tesla needs to by this company fast so they can blow QuantumScape out of the water with a superior battery.GMG.v Graphene Manufacturing GroupThoughts?
Does anyone know when the first Tesla will roll off the Berlin Giga line? Seems like it’s taking forever .
Earnings--3 major components:1. Cars sales + autonomous software = $ .802 Storage batteries/utilities = .503. Zev credits = .804. Interest $18.5 billion cash (1.5%). =. .285. Bitcoin ($1.3 billion increase) = 1.35 This is just back-of-the-envelop type calculations but it should be close.Tesla may save some of the Zev credits for future quarters but I don't think so because the volume of sales should continue to accelerate putting pressure on selling all these Zev credits. I may be off on the margins but I think we will see explosive growth in margins as the Die casting presses lower the cost per car and as the volume of sales continues to ramp up.

"Tesla is the among the few technology companies without and the only one that can link its technology to the space program. When the company redesign it EV's dash system including the new and upcoming Cybertruck in this scenario the others in the space mainly the premium brands like Mercedes, BMW, Cadillac, Porsche, Jaguar, Range Rover, Volvo, Lexus and any others I have missed will be left i ce again year behind in the offering.Tesla's Elon Musk had this chess board so overwhelmingly in the winner take all lane that the pullback is presenting another buying opportunity for those seeking entry. Their EV's data mined, Crew dragon and now the success of Starship does present major valuations for Tesla for what is in the pipeline and is yet to come to society and the market."

Telsa might need to get a new CEO to get that stock back up.. I think the bitcoin debacle is not a good look.
"I have said before, TSLA isn't the most overvalued stock right now, just the largest in terms of excess market cap.HWIN, the $100 million market cap company that has as its only operation a closed deli, is probably the most overvalued relative to real value.Both stocks are signs that there is just too much money sloshing around and this will end badly. I don't know when, but it will."
"Some say there should be no government subsidies or incentives for BEV FSD development. Nor for its supporting infrastructure.

Yahoo has a -63% estimated return on TSLA. Seems like a big number.
"Why is this not a headline? Early owners of the Ford Mustang Mach-E, have experienced a battery problem that leaves their vehicles unable to start after charging, according to a service bulletin filed by Ford with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.Ford said a software glitch can cause the vehicle's smaller 12-volt battery to discharge while the larger high-voltage battery pack is charging.Unfortunately for Tesla, a news like this for Tesla will be all over CNBC news.

"TESLA IS KING!!! A Volkswagen joint venture in China has agreed to buy green car credits from Tesla to help meet local environmental rules, three people briefed on the matter told Reuters."

Like clockwork. The post-ER fall. Easy money.
Oh no Tesla is down so much today. Wait.. Let me look.. Yep I'm still in the green :)
Tesla 850C 05/21 what is your opinion?
Upward momentum building. All those who sold out between $800-$900 will start moving back in catching the next wave further fueling the momentum. At least until after earnings.
This stock is the perfect reflection of the broken financial system
"if it is inflation people are selling stocks. The next question is do you want to hold cash in a inflationary environment? The answer is no. You will lose your network value faster if you hold cash. So you either own something that stores value (bit coin) or growth (tesla). The symbol TSLA contains both. So I am not selling. Lets see who win in 2 years, cash or tesla stock?"
800 after earning! Record sales number in China. Beat expectation without doubt!
"gain in a -267 points Dow, bravo!"
I don't get why people want tsla to fall? Are they jealous of Elon success?
TSLA shorts so wrong again. Wait until tomorrow when this cruises higher they will be gone.
"Come on fan bois, even you have to admit now that something is structurally at fault with Tesla’s price structure. This is not short sellers in action, it’s the longs that are taking any bid available as long as they can fill a decent quantity. You will all be at 400 in no time and it will then hit you, why the F didn’t you sell at 900, 800, 750, 700, all of 600 and 575 even... hahahaha"
Why is this down in after hours? The earnings were really good! Beat the street!
Sorry guys but I cannot invest in a company with a bipolar CEO.
It’s now a meme stock .
Texas police will serve search warrants on Tesla Inc on Tuesday to secure data from a vehicle that crashed on the weekend. Apparently they will not take Elon's word that I was driving.
"Despite bears frequently saying that Tesla only has strong margins on Model S and Model X (which they sold almost none of in Q1 due to a transition period in production to the refreshed editions), gross margins on automotive revenue came in at 26.5% and 22% minus regulatory credits, both numbers nearly the highest in the company's history. Still going to say that Tesla doesn't have any profit margins on Model 3 and Model Y? How did they almost beat their own record without almost any help from S and X this time?"
Going back to 0
"Audi , VW, GM And Ford are spending millions of dollars advertising their BEV’s But not Tesla ! Not 1 dime on ads YET Tesla has the most sales how is that ?"
Buy more TSLA shares? You better be taking profits because the stock markets gonna be red tomorrow. And if you don’t you’ll be giving back all those Gains today￼￼
Bidens tax means no more newbie investors and Tesla fans so $300s and under a reality . thanks for bidens tax lol . May Sell Off reality lol

"The problem is that they forgot the really big car manufacturers! Do you think Daimler, VW, Toyota, the other big ones are just watching Tesla take the market from them? No! Car manufacturing does not consist of putting a creaky body on a relatively good drivetrain. That's what Tesla is doing now. Tesla will be lucky if they are still in the car business in 5 years."

"I bought 2000 shares Amazon in 1998 for $18 and sold it at $23 few weeks later and it split 3 times since. If i would hold on to it, i would be happier man today. So lesson learned, once you find a great company with great future growth, hold on to it and you will be handsomely rewarded. Think long, ignore short term noises, stay calm and enjoy the ride up.

I just want to congratulate Mr. Musk! Genius! Kept pumping Dogecoin and now people are selling Tesla's stock to buy it!

If anyone is worried about buying tesla don’t be every single one of us was in your position when we thought about buying or waiting there is no need to wait Tesla is not only a good stock it’s a good company this is a generational stock our great grandchildren will be able to Profit from this company this is the future love the future stick to the plan
"I see today close as about the bottom of the channel TSLA stock price shows on my chart. Accordingly, I sold $670 strike puts expiring Friday. Clearly, the stock price will bounce up or go down.In either case, the longer term trend remains down."
"Tesla is building large battery production into both Giga Austin and Giga Berlin. In other words, more integration and less risk of supply chain disruption. Tesla is by far in the best position to scale up EV production. Talk to me about ""competition"" when they have the batteries to supply all the EVs you think they're going to make."
Tesla has some work to do. Just saw a Cadillac Lyric and Wow! Plus Mary Bara is a great leader...

Elon must pay huge bidens tax on his bitcoin and dogecoin gains lol. that's why Elon wants to leave bidens market and sell his bitcoin maybe ? why take so much risk for so much low reward that you have to pay over half to state and fed tax?
Its gonna be hilarious when all these non Tesla evs come out and hardly any of them sell and they sell at astronomical losses per vehicle and the ZEV credits actually keep going higher for Tesla. Tesla can earn 1Billion in profit anytime they want and it might even happen this Q based on their volume expansion. Then once the world sees the first quarter with Giga 3 and Giga 4 online; that's when Tesla rockets to above 1Trillion valuation.

Did bubble woods buy the dip on this?
"What should be clear from the Q1 ER, and what should concern every shareholder, is that Tesla keeps setting record deliveries but is still unable to be profitable from its business operations. They keep needing more and more regulatory credits each quarter to eke out a profit. That is not sustainable. Until Tesla can show that they can be profitable without the credits, the market cap should be under $100B. Unfortunately, if the past is any indication, that may never happen."
"Remember, waiting for $40 Billion SHORTS covering and closing their positions! Patience everyone plus Blowout Earnings on top of it too!"

Tesla Lorry....seen on the roads today oooo interesting.
Take away all the hype off of this stock and the share price will be $50.
TSLA hits it's $40 up target today. Can we go higher for the next two weeks as we approach earnings?
I guarantee it will close green. I'm always right!!
Shorts are scrabbling to cover their options but they are gonna be broke next week
"This week Tesla will reach $850+, great earnings"
"Elon and Cathie, who is a better stock promoter? :)"
Was no losses take cash out original investment sooooo playing w house $$$$$$$
Before earning $850 after earning $1000
Great Day! Green at last.. let's keep this moving! Go Tesla!
Tesla's ProblemThey can double their production with Germany and Texas. The fact is it will not increase profit. Past history indicates they have shown no ability to make money producing cars. More cars will lead to more credits but not necessarily more revenue. There agreement is already for FCA/Stellantis. They will need to find a buyer for future credits. Past History tells us that Tesla will lose a significant amount of money as they begin production. The next 2 years or even 10 years do not look to be pretty.
Big drop tomorrow after the Tesla car crash news.
Oh no!

Tesla's Tech for Autopilot and FSD does not work well enough to put humans in the cars with it Full stop. You can believe it now or just wait but you will not see a Tesla RoboTaxi in the foreseeable future. GM maybe, or Honda (uses GM Supercruise) but not Tesla. And the analysts know it!!!"

"Sell TSLA, Buy XOM. Make lots of money the next six months."
There is something quirky and innovative about Fisker that will create a cult following like $AAPL or $TSLA. It doesn't have to compete it will create it's own niche as the most environmentally friendly and inexpensive (PEAR 30k) for the people much like Volkswagen was created for the masses.
"The law states that a licensed driver must be in the drivers seat. If the manufacturer is responsible for people who break the law, just think of how much other auto companies are responsible for."
Where is that $100 price target every short on here likes to spout off about? I thought Tesla was supposed to have tanked by now?
Nice finish folks. Congrats to long. More upside to come this week.
"Tesla just reported first-quarter vehicle production and delivery numbers for 2021. In total, it delivered 184,800 vehicles and produced 180,338 carshttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/02/tesla-tsla-q1-2021-vehicle-production-and-delivery-numbers.html"
GOING RED
TSLA will be ending up in green today! Shorties! LOL
bought more. Buy and hold.
25% OF their earnings was because of the BTC sale...
Anyone watched the Munro Live tear down of the VW ID.4? Pretty pitiful design for supposed “German engineering”. It’s like they cobbled together 3 different cars to make one. What competition?!
Earnings is good. What happened??
How many are still happy they voted forBiden?
"Unfortunately no matter what you say shorties and hater lads, this will go up. To be honest, you know that too. "
I don’t know what’s more revealing about the crash: that people think a car can be responsible for the driver’s decision to get in the back/passenger seat (in full abuse of the terms of use) or to discount the fact that Tesla cars with software enabled are 10X safer than the average car. Ignore the noise.
$540 tomorrow.
VERY SOON 400's
I'm still new to fundamentals. Can anyone explain how can Tesla become a 700B company that only makes less than a billion?

"Google announced earnings and instantly gained 120 points pre market. TSLA announced earnings and I instantly went down 40 points. So far a 5 percent drop. Both companies are doing well and beat expectations however a different result. So tell me why TSLA go down and google go up? TSLA made millions from the sales of Bitcoin and the Crooks claimed it was not good enough. Refresh my mind for a second, didn’t they make all the money from the gambling of stocks and funds? Morgan and Merrill and Goldman and Ark etc...... therefore their profits are all considered air if that is the standard determination? U can’t twist facts when on how one made millions and bring in profits the company. I don’t think TSLA investors are selling. All just a part of the game those crooks play into this stock."
it is building up quietly in the 580-590 range. Not selling one share. Get ready for the ride to 650.
Wow. Model 3 is #1 selling car in Germany !! And now Model 3 number 1 in France. Wow. Wow. !!! N
$TSLA $UPST short squeeze
"EV stocks are not following the futures for the past few weeks, so ignore the shorts who have been working overtime posting negative comments. These stocks $PLUG, $NIO, $XPEV, $WKHS, $TSLA...have been moving collectively due to algo-bot trading and the resulting sentiment. Also, the hype of crypto has been moving money over from these popular EV stocks as well. EV stocks were hyped for good reason, but weak hands and tax season had many taking profits. As we near the end of April, I expect EV stocks to begin popping up again and changing to an upward trend. PLUG has hit a critical support levels around 27 range...this should to bounce and finally begin recovery soon. NIO and XPEV are at motor shows in China this week and already getting excellent response from the public and positive reviews from the press. TSLA is extremely strong, but its swings influences other EV stocks. Most importantly, earnings is around the corner for most of these, and everyone expects positive results, along with the end of the month delivery summaries to continue increasing. That expectation should help push the trend upward as well. Keep buying the discounted prices and keep holding until 2025+/"
"The silver lining is the more TSLA drops, the less you'll need to pay in capital gains. It's a lose/win proposition."
This is the dip at 704! Now BUY BUY BUY!!!
I see Tesla repaired the windows in the two year-old prototype Cyber Truck resurrected for the photo-op / hype event in Austin. Where is the production intent version?
"Really interesting TSLA was up about 4 percent and ended up in red. While the Nasdaq had a really great day. My take, if they deliver 180K I think the stock goes up to 800 into earnings. If delivery missed 170K I think the stock goes to 560 range"
Top wall street analysts says tesla is a must own stock duh
This stock is gonna tank in the morning. Elon went about that Bitcoin announcement all wrong. Terrible decision making. Thanks for the discount on Bitcoin though Elon!
"""Hey, let's buy some bitcoin. I'll manipulate it up with my tweets. We'll make billions. Who needs to sell cars (profitably)?"" ... ""DOIGHT!!!"""
I bought 4 put contracts how low do you think this is going to go? to cover because its a very big position for me. Most of the times TSLA reports the stock goes lower. Its a great company but EPS and valuation is not close to the the stock price.
"I have no doubt Tesla will soar tomorrow - up 10%. Elon seems confident. But the sad fact is that EV adoption is happening much, much slower than originally predicted. ICE cars are still 30% cheaper up front, and unless you have a home charger there is no per-mile savings using electricity instead of gas."

It’s notable that Elon Musk, Cathie Wood or the new trendy green CEOs were NOT invited. As I’ve said countless times, existing energy companies will be the leaders with their existing engineering capacity, financial resources and global structure. They will likely receive grants from the infrastructure bull to develop carbon scrubbing tech & alternative fuels. In other words- to invest in $XLE and it’s component companies is to invest in tomorrow’s green companies."
Hi shorty how you doing today lol
People die everyday in car accidents but for some reason when it’s a Tesla it’s being reported. I don’t understand why people don’t like Elon Musk
Tesla will be the most affordable car. Elon will make it the number 1 EV. Not selling a single share
How is the sec not in ark offices yet?
GM will buy Tesla in a couple of years. For pennies on the the dollar.Elon will be able to concentrate on his trip to Mars.
Best Battery by far! Negative people need to get out of here. It’s way ahead of every other car maker. This will be $750 by next Friday. EV are still the future.

It's when all the folks who have only ever experienced quick sell offs followed by big recoveries keep trying to ""buy the dip"" only to get chopped to pieces by the churn. Then, one day, CRASH!!!! I have no doubt that TSLA will open 200-300 points lower at some point in the near future as all buyer's finally realize the danger they are in and go on strike. Be very careful."
Trust in JESUS for eternal life. John 3:16. 
Sweet fruit of Patience
Priced for perfection. All future sales accounted for..
This just in for clueless Bears that don’t do their own homework. Tesla “is” profitable without Regulatory Credits.
You know a report is good when the bears are forced send 1000 messages on why it’s bad
800$+ today.
I keep looking at TSLA after selling in between $620 - 670 and still can't believe anyone would buy above $500s. Good luck to all longs that don't sell before the year end of the summer... when the FED's free money ends!
Overall market was red takin a break from record levels. Tesla did a healthy pullback for next leg up... I can definitely see $800 by Friday with no problem! 
sell before it hits 400
"Wow, look at that slow, steady climb today."
Another red week.
I could care less if something is overvalued. Doesn’t really matter anymore these days. Look at Bitcoin. Most overvalued thing I’ve ever seen in my life (not crypto but Bitcoin specifically) yet I’m still kicking myself for not buying in early. And I’ve been kicking myself for too long over Tesla. Getting in before I’ve lost even more money by waiting around.
Expecting another record quarter and year deliveries
Tesla to $900 in 3 months 
"Why do I have the feeing that many of those who have attempted the ""Tesla Driverless Challenge"" have also participated in the ""Tide Pod Challenge""?"
Tesla is a growth company
When you vote for people that know absolutely nothing about economics and business this is what you get. He's just caused trillions to go up in smoke in a matter of minutes. I'd say impeach him but his replacement isn't any better.
"Tesla slammed daily by CCP in China.-Probe into Tesla brake issues-No.1 insurer won't cover Teslas -Video of big Tesla crash in Guangzhou goes viral-Owner protests unfixed SUA problems in Nanning-Video of NIO fans yelling ""Beat Elon Musk""-Wompy wheels on national TV news."

But every night at bedtime our dog still runs upstairs to the old bedroom and seems genuinely confused and bewildered that it is empty.

Tesla will be $2k by December. Don’t underestimate Musk.
"EVs: You now have Mercedes, Audi, Volkswagen, Porsche etc. as charged-up real car options. Dozens of fully configurable real cars.Would you buy a pricy old-style Tesla EV, that cannot even meet Chinese quality expectations?Might be, if you are a collector or a museum director."
"Tesla posts record net income of $438 million, revenue surges by 74% AND DOWN it's only because i own it... ugh"
"Soon we will hear Tesla crushed its 1st quarter profits and will blowout the quarter . Followed by monthly leasing of FSD thousands of Tesla owner will sign up. Then Tesla MIGHT license its software out Toyota ??? VW. ??? They could both gain by partnering with Tesla Then Tesla might open up its supercharger network via an app to ALL EV’s a simple adaptor and instant accessibility. Bit coin will be over 60,000 and Tesla will look invincible Feel free to add to this optimism and I didn’t even get to the factories and any new models starting up."
"Does anyone know why Tesla is raising prices?I did notice that sales in Europe are down so far this quarter (but their ship(s) have not come in yet).But I also noted that - copper is up about 100% in the last year and about 40% this year.- Lithium is up about 30% this year- Steel is up about 400%- Labor costs are rising (that's trivial really)- Interest rates are rising (up about 70% this year, but not for auto loans yet!)I wonder if any of these things will impact Tesla's sales and profitability?Guru.-"
This phase of the bubble is called new normal 560-590. The phase after this is fear driven drop/capitulation then despair when you realize you lost everything.

This is setting up to squeeze higher. 800 is possible next week.
700 at close as predicted
"OK, we can agree, 1 million in 2021 was a pipe dream, wishful thinking. Now the consensus is 900K. I'll take the under. Berlin is delayed, Cyber Truck delayed, no Roadster, ZERO Models S and X produced so far this year, and maybe a few dozen token hand fabricated semis, for hype, isn't getting Tesla anywhere near 900K. Just for reference, Musk a but promised 1 million deliveries in 2020, 1.5M in 2021. Not sure what Austin is going to be building. Model Y? To sell where, Germany and China? U.S. market is becoming saturated. Without FSD, Model Y is just another expensive, poorly built, uncomfortable, go fast car."
"Expected EPS 0.74, as per analysts. I think Tesla will beat that, EPS should come close to 1.1-1.2 this time."

"This stock is in the process of retesting the March lows. It may dip lower and bounce back up above $560, in which case one might claim that the test has held and TSLA is in position to climb upwards again.Or it may break through, in which case it may well head down to $400, where it was pre-S&P 500 inclusion announcement."
It's just over 100 a month. Should be zero by Christmas
Bitcoin community is mad about Elon. They are eager to short Tesla below $100 a share.
Buy buy buy!!!$3000 by summer when Elon moves to the Mars!
Will YOU be left holding the bag when the overvalued market crashes
How you like that comeback from -7% today?!? Haha
Everyone posting here has a purpose. As you will observe it is difficult to tell from many what their purpose is. I’ll make it clear! TSLA to $1000.
Rocket refueling
Market getting smashed but not TSLA.
i have a friend work at Tesla sale and he said they have a record sale by Bitcoin payment!
I love the green revolution and the tech in Tesla cars but Elon leaves a horrible impression on me specially lately. I am selling all. I stopped believing. Good luck to all.
"Behind ARK Invest's $3,000 Target Price for TeslaThe electric vehicle manufacturer, however, is on the correct path from a financial performance perspective, which is evident from the fact that 2020 was the first-ever profitable year for the company. For many years, Wall Street analysts questioned the ability of Tesla to become profitable, and the company achieved this on the back of strong revenue growth (from $204 million in 2011 to $31.5 billion in 2020).ARK Invest, which has a reputation for identifying high-growth companies earlier than the rest of the investing public, recently published a research report assigning a target price of $3,000 per share for Tesla by 2025, suggesting the company is significantly undervalued at the closing market price of $611.29 on March 29.ARK's investment thesisThis is not the first time ARK Invest has come up with a rich valuation for Tesla. In 2018, Ark Invest founder Catherine Wood (Trades, Portfolio) set a target price of $800 for Tesla's stock while it was trading at just $70, which seemed irrational at the time. However, the shares surged past $800 earlier this year, proving the fund manager was right on the mark.ARK had previously forecast a 30% probability of Tesla delivering autonomous cars by 2024, and it now believes there is a 50% probability of this happening by 2025. According to the firm, the rollout of autonomous vehicles will be one of the most important steps in the growth story of Tesla.In addition to this, ARK expects Tesla to achieve cost efficiencies in the next few years along with the expected increase in vehicle production. In its research report, ARK refers to Wright's Law on multiple instances, suggesting the production costs of future vehicles will decline significantly in the coming years, paving the way for Tesla to report high operating margins.Tesla, to its merit, has been keeping up pace with its stated objectives as well. For instance, the company announced a plan to deliver 500,000 vehicles in 2020 before the economic recession came to light, and ended the year by delivering 499,550 vehicles worldwide. The company's ability to deliver on its seemingly impossible promises is one of the key factors ARK has taken into consideration in its valuation model.Macroeconomic outlookDespite the economic upheaval caused by the Covid-19 virus-induced recession and the closure of the Tesla factory in California, the company manufactured 36% more cars in 2020 in comparison to 2019, which gives a glimpse of the strength of its global manufacturing plants. Strategically investing in China to manufacture vehicles locally proved to be a differentiator in 2020, and is likely to be a value driver in the long run as China is the world's largest market for electric vehicles.The price of electric car batteries plays an important role in the profitability of Tesla. Over the past decade, the price of these components has dropped significantly, making it cheaper for Tesla to manufacture vehicles. According to Adele Peters at Fast Company, the price of batteries has fallen to $137 per kilowatt-hour from $1,110 in 2011, and these significant cost-savings can be passed on to consumers as well, making electric vehicles much more competitive in comparison to gasoline-powered vehicles. According to data from Statista, Tesla is the clear leader of the electric vehicle industry globally, and this market-leading position paints a promising picture of what the future holds for the company given that cost of production is expected to decline sharply.Tesla is the largest clean energy company in the world and is on its way to becoming the most valuable automotive company as well. In addition to Tesla's battery-powered vehicles, the company also supplies solar power to residential and corporate customers under Tesla Energy. The company has a favorable outlook for the energy business considering the radical changes implemented by governments around the world to embrace clean energy solutions in a bid to promote the use of environmentally-friendly energy sources.There are two major threats to Tesla's success, which need to be monitored carefully.The increasing competition in the automobile industry.The probability of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations.Tesla is enjoying first-mover advantages to the fast-growing electric vehicle industry, and these advantages, which include high brand awareness and consumer loyalty, might help it thwart the threat of competition for a long period of time. However, the relatively young nature of the industry presents other automakers with an opportunity to gain market share by introducing high-quality products, so Tesla will have to continue investing in the business to retain its market leadership.Tesla remains focused on innovationThe founder and CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, is expected to unveil at least a couple of new vehicles by https://finance.yahoo.com/news/behind-ark-invests-3-000-170030637.html"

"Hey guys let’s get over the self driving Beta version that Elon has been pushing. As a FDS owner I’m confident FSD will happen, but not on Elon’s time frame. I’m looking at how things have progressed over the last 3.5 years and there has been huge improvements to FSD during this period. I’m thinking FSD is still at least 2 years out. It could be longer, but it’ll happen. Elon is very excited, but once it gets closer to perfection it’ll take sometime to prove its Technology. Ark has a 50-50 shot for Tesla’s FSD for 2025. Those numbers will only improve with time."

"The F-150 Lightening reveal convinced me even more what a collasal mistake the CyberTruck is. 3 million pickup trucks are sold in the US each year and instead of trying to steal the lion's share of that market, Tesla has settled for being a niche player. Honestly, is any blue-collar working man going to buy a CyberTruck? Are companies and governments going to buy thousands of Cybertrucks at a time as fleet vehicles? From the looks of it the CyberTruck cannot even accomodate a traditional camper shell or toolbox, and maybe not even a 5th wheel. Fast forward 5 years and my guess is Tesla will be selling 100K CyberTrucks per year and everyone else will be dividing up the other 2.9 MILLION pickup truck sales. Tesla is missing out bigtime."

I bought this pre-market this morning at 580 At what price should I average down and buy again￼?
You see that bit at the top of the chart. I bought there. Have a good weekend all :).
"shorts win, musk numbers are bogus"
What a weak rebound - too weak
"Tesla is half the market cap of Google. Google just reported $20 billion in profits. Tesla had $440 million, but actually lost money if you take away reg credits and Bitcoin speculation. Let that sink in."
I feel there are more to this market than we know. Ask for a proper guidance before investing in this pretty much complicated market. I've made over 8 bitcoin from an allocation of 1 bitcoin over the last 4 months using Barrow Marcus help. Things might get worse so just make the smarter move.

"How many reasonable people will sign a lengthy, complex WAIVER OF LIAbILITY to save a couple of dollars in a Robo-Taxi without a driver.In that context, why is TSLA/Musk so determined to beat Taxi drivers out of an honest livelihood."
This will be at 500 in NO TIME!! Then DOWN BIG TIME!
"Someone please explain. Auto business has been faced with low margins, over-capacity, too much competition and weak consumer demand and in US auto case poor quality. How does any of this change when all auto companies produce expensive EVs—seems to me it gets worse since few people want EVs..."
"Technically speaking, TSLA just broke the 200-DMA of $582.57 for the 1st time since last March COVID19-driven collapse. Not a good sign if they cannot go back up tough resistance within 1-2 trading days ...... Next support March bottom $539 and Sept 1,2020 - $502.49 market top before 5:1 stock split. Failure to hold on to these critical supports going forward, $300-400 is not impossible. Ouch !"
"Hey shorties, guess what? We are one week away from earnings announcement. You kno what that means? Another record smashing quarter!"
"They beak delivery expectations with a record number ... and yet, $TSLA still drops? Where is the momentum?"
I mean I’m holding this in the 350s lol. But you’ve gotta be thick to sell in the 600s 
OOOOOOOHHHHHHH NOOOOOOOOOOOO
Very large investor dumps his shares and has gone bearish on the company. LOL.
Earnings forecast is great for TSLA ! Price will skyrocket on day of Earnings Report!
There goes Tesla..
imagine selling tesla before monday record earnings ...
If it breaks $720 it's gonna be a solid day for the longs!
"Now that that's in the books, As I stated my short term target price for Tesla Now at $900 and come December of this year $1,720 target price. Tesla is a Awesome Company with Starlink , Solar, Insurance, RoboTaxi coming, it's Truck, The Semi, SpaceX, Now he Elon Musk will be on the Board of another company's IPO."
Well ...upgrades tomorrow?
At open this will stairway up to $620. Don't miss out!
"Hahahaha, my first visit to this board,, had no idea it would be so “smash bash as others” but ?! I guess you need to make the koolaid so the kids can drink it"
"Honestly, everyone is waiting to take profit from TSLA’s little rally in the past 2 days! We have to admit that TSLA’s pattern is different from last year now! Every single little pop is taken profit right away! Tons of headwinds upcoming!"
"Ideally, if all vehicles were on auto control, there would be no accidents as everyone would be following the same rules. The best option - go full automation - no steering wheels or any pedals - enjoy life - we have better things to do!"
Yahoo censors anything about China in regards to TSLA.
Back to $700 this week. Surprised it dipped after the pop on Friday.
Only people buying Tesla shares are people who already own shares. Keep buying the dip. No new investors.
ELON WITH THE BIG BEAT<<<< >>>AND CHIP SHORTAGE>>>>AND NOT YET USING THE 2 NEW FACTORIES THAT WILL BE READY BY MID YEAR>>>>AND LINGERING COVID EFFECTS>>>>>THIS IS VERY BULLISH>>>THEY ONLY SOLD MODEL Y AND 3 >>>>S AND X HAVE THE BIGGEST MARGIN>>>>BUY WITH BOTH HANDS>>>GOING TO 1000
"So when will we get our Cyber Trucks? ""You will be able to complete your configuration as production nears in late 2021."" Wait..., what? Notice it doesn't say ""Deliveries begin..."" Notice it doesn't say ""Production begins.., it just ""'nears' "".Notice it doesn't say ""You will be able to receive..."", only configure. ""Production Nears"" can be found in the same Muskinary as ""Factory Gated"". Elon is hiring better lawyers all the time."
Welp mmhmm. Just found out why Tesla share price going down to less than 400 tomorrow and it’ll end up in the mid 40s.. simple really..
Tesla is going to do the same what spacex did to the competition.. There will be players with one of prototypes and partnering for critical technologies like self driving / battery tech.. The power of vertical integration and state of the art manufacturing processes (like giga press .. etc) is going to be game changing. Nothing new here .. but when i heard NASA giving the moon landing contract to SPACEX bypassing blueorgin and other competitors ... the pace at which they are testing the starship prototypes.. never seen anything being developed like this and how it make people inspired and happy is priceless..
Just believe in Tesla's products! We'll do great!
"It will be GREEN for sure , i'm very confident about Elon management. 21th centurys prophet <3"
Unbelievable
"I come here to slum, to see delusional people defend the indefensible valuation of the Muskocar. But delusion continues in spite of reality. That is the problem facing the USA: massive financial illiteracy and cults of personality. Have I offended you? OK. You needed that."
Looks like $tsla exiting making cars and going into crypto trading - Elon Musk pyramid scheme ending lolhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/dogecoin-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-ethereum-elon-musk-094925821.html
"Elon is not just a ""technoking"" .He is a person who is exceptionally intelligent or creative, either generally or in some particular respect.""one of the great geniuses of this century"" ...""says Einstein"" :)"
"""Must Tweeted"" and ""AKEA Having Sale on Unassembled Furniture"" has about the same effect."
"If you bought this company it would only take you 1000 years to get an ROI, lmao"
Best thing to do is to say Elon’s Asperger’s syndrome has created a bipolar disorder which is common.
"Tesla forgoes claiming a large percentage of its profits to build $2 billion dollar gigafactories. No new gigafactories, no growth. Goal for 2021? Building 800K to 1 million BEVs."
Tomorrow we should expect reaction from the share. Large volume for the share today. Speculators place bets on the share.....
"Seems to hit a solid ceiling at $700. Here's the thing: Tesla already went to the moon. It already happened. The valuation is sky-high, and every bit of good news over the next 10 years, including FSD rollout, growth of vehicle sales, and eventual profitability of the energy business, all has already been baked into the current price. So.... no surprise it's difficult to climb higher for any reason other than pure emotion, and the hype is beginning to wear off."
20k TSLA BY 2030
Here is George after the news...
"Let's admit that's a bubble , the top was at 900 if you assume that a crack is coming with a total loss of 80-85% from the top, this can touch ~140$. This is possible , look at others bubble like cisco in 2000."
think TSLA can get to 540 or 500 ?
Nasdaq is back. We are going to $900 soon
"TESLA to sell 20million cars by 2030!!! THATS SOME MASSIVE GROWTH! and they will do it, Or man on MOON will slap Yo SHORT MAMMA!!!!!"
"spaceX and Tesla, mark my words. and than lets talk about price. my guess is first number will be 2 or 3 and the rest??? it is your fun."
"I really don't think the average investor fully understands how expensive this stock has become. Due your DD. I understand the narrative of what this can become, but at this price it's already been achieved apparently. It' s like giving the Nets the NBA championship now. They still have to earn it."
"My experience with investing in TSLA is one of missed opportunity. Last year around March I almost bought 100 shares when the markets dipped. TSLA later split 5:1. Had I dropped my loser (Baba) back then and bought in, I would be up a little over 300K right now."
"Just remember if it falls 0.5% of a percent, it has to rise 1 full percent to get your money back."
Ford and GM are out of excuses with their resources they should each be producing at least a million EV’s per year. Why aren’t they ?
Luckily I able to change my share from Tesla to NIO as NIO is monopoly in battery swap technology recently.
$TSLA said they expect 50% annual growth in vehicle deliveries
"$40 Billion Open SHORTS will take TSLA’s price to $1,000 after Earnings report!"
$650 close tomorrow?
Honda made $3 billion last quarter in profits. Company is worth $55 billion. When does Tesla make $1 billion in monthly profits for three months in a row?
Option Premiums drop after earnings. Anything near term otm contract is close to worthless after earnings.Stocks don’t move through earnings like people think. The market maker usually wins the option game.
Jeesh
What a genius! Kept hyping Dogecoin now people are buying it and selling Tesla!
"If you bought a TESLA when the stock IPO’d you would have paid just over $55k and that care would be worth less than 10k today! If you would have invested that same 55k into TESLA when it IPO’d at $18, you would have made more than $6million today! Don’t buy a fancy car. Invest your money and change your LIFE"
Will there be any positive factors fir Tesla in today’s environment announcements by President?
TSLA is known to go up when there more haters!!! Watch out guys
Tesla/Elon accepts Bitcoin as payment now question to ask how the Refund works if I don't like my Tesla and return it in a day or 2? will I get refund back with Bitcoin or cash $? And what if today I buy a Tesla bitcoin at $50k and price drop next day to $0 Zero? how will I get refund dollar or bitcoin? Elon is a scam lol if you have looked at his refund policy haha
"Elon being a market maker in crypto to fix his balance sheet is his John Delorean moment of running coke to save his business. Delorean was framed, Elon is the wizard."
I hate shorts...the squeeze is well deserved. More tomorrow...
"I want 3 Tesla’s.car, suv and truck"
$800 billion market cap for 1mn cars to be produced this year. Hard to connect the dots
BREAKING NEWS! Musk just announced a better version of FSD will be available in 2-3 weeks. OMG!
"PE went from 1100 to 250 in one quarter. When gigaBerlin and giga Texas and gigashanghai 2 comes on line we could see pe drop to under 90 with growth of over 50%. Not bad. The establishment media is out in force lying, exaggerating, distorting all to create FUD for those covering their PUTs and then buying low."
"Curious to what the consensus is for tomorrow...it could just as easily go down at first, but I think we're going higher for a while from here."
Bet against Elon? good luck with that 
You could have 12 shares of SAVA with bigger returns over the next 3 months than TSLA could ever return. Percentages are proving it. Alzheimers' cure is the next TESLA from 5 years ago.
"Wedbush analyst Dan Ives upgraded TSLA stock to Outperform, target price $1300.BTW, it is a three-month, end of summer, price target!!!"
They really want to stew the $700 call for straight 2 weeks. Can’t wait until one of the big short decided to give up. #willHappen
TSLA Q1 EARNINGS: Revenue of $10.389B vs $10.29B estimate. EPS $0.93 vs $0.79 estimate
"crash helmet on, phony earnings numbers sending us down"
When the New Audi electric comes out it'll make the Tesla look like an old shoe LoL
"Soon we will hear how Tesla has crushed its 1st quarter production figures. Followed by monthly leasing of FSD thousands of Tesla owner will sign up. Then Tesla MIGHT license its software out Toyota ??? VW. ??? They could both gain by partnering with Tesla Then Tesla might open up its supercharger network via an app to ALL EV’s a simple adaptor and instant accessibility. Bit coin will be over 60,000 and Tesla will look invincible Feel free to add to this optimism and I didn’t even get to the factories and any new models starting up."
Powerful day and a bright tomorrow.

"Q1 earnings estimate is 79 cents a share, according to the mean estimate from 21analysts, based on Refinitiv data.I would be surprised if Tesla beats this. Too many pricecuts for the boost of salesvolume."
Haven’t sold a single share of TSLA in months … hope y’all can say the same 
Missed on Revenues but nobody talks about that. 1200 P/E

I just think Tesla and Bitcoin is the place to become rich.
"The cult is dense.""Tesla went up all these years so it will go up all these coming years""That pretty much sums up their argument.They have no clue that it's the very definition of a Ponzi scheme."
TSLA going to $200 for sure... they have nothing.. their leader bought bitcoin instead of investing in his won company... says it all... SNL is what he's focused on..
too many RED days...

Stay tuned as this is only ""1"" of the downward pressures TSLA is going to experience in 2021. Other threats include Tesla's ""already has been scooped"" on the sub $25,000 mass market EV. and they are not even close to competing and the Mass market is the market and sorry 'Cathy but you didn't subtract the FSD fees from profit going forward. This isn't just Bear rhetoric. ... of the 14 major companies working on FDS Tesla is last. Tesla with only "" 12 "" miles before ""disengagement"". It's competitors: Waymo drives 11,154 on average (before the FSD is disengaged for safety reasons); GM Cruise 5,204 miles etc... so it's a fraud to sell it ? ... probably This needs to change now or Tesla will get the worlds biggest Hindenburg Bear attack (I expect it)"

A lot of accounting shenanigans in the earnings. Still very reliant on tax credits. But at some stage competition will hurt Tesla big time.
$800 today and up!
Also just wait until Elon steps down. Tesla will be done and it might pop all the other bubbles like BTC. Elon has already said he isn't in Tesla long term. He's under investigation again by the SEC. How many more of these investigations will he waste his time on? Not many his real passion is SpaceX. This stock is balancing over a cliff with all the weight hanging on the cliff side. The more it goes up the faster it will go down. Maybe not today but just wait for that catalyst that will crash this. Elon stepping down or Tesla dropped by S&P or Bitcoin tanks or VW and BMW sell more than Tesla. Or somebody comes out with a groundbreaking battery. Or someone beats Tesla on price as all the Chinese companies will. Minimal upside. Huge downside risk. This is pure bubble gold for the hyped-up FOMO warriors out there.
TSLA will go down below $550/share in couple of weeks
“I bought the dip last Thursday “
Bruh. Tesla would not have been able to beat earnings if it wasn’t 100m from bitcoin sale
People are finally going to get it. Tesla is production constrained and there's no telling what the real level of demand is. Prepare for a correction in Tesla stock soon - upward.
"Giant short squeezy tomorrow folks. Longs, congrats on nice GREEN day. More to come in next few months. Stay calm and enjoy the ride up. Cheers."
"Great entry point, to buy shares. Considering inflation, and the weight of the dollars worth being less, than any product it buy's. An example if this is realestate. So looking here for buying opportunities."
"there is green on my futures screen. whatever fortunes this trading or HODLing day may bring,cheers!"
Where are the times when cathie Wood was saying Tesla is going to 3000usd/share?
"If tesla tries to decorate their balance sheet using their paper profit on a super volatile investment on bitcoin, that will be the saddest and desperate attempt for them to hide the decreasing profit margins on the real long term car business. Long term investors will burn them down if they use BTC investment to show them that their balance sheet is looking good. Look at the example of NEL ASA when they did this with their Q4 results with NKLA paper profits."
Picking winning stocks is hard work when you don’t know what to do. I was losing big time until I found these guys (http://Fairstox.com). So glad I joined them.

"Looks like another good day for a short squeeze! And like every Friday for the past few months, Tesla’s going up!"
Elon will be forced to step down by SEC. He will step down but really it was forced.
Headed to $500 without a doubt. Bahahaha ! Timberrrrrrrrrr
Why did cathie wood ARKK sell Tesla today ?
So if they lose money the stock should theoretically go up? Lmao
Great earnings. Now picture what they would have been if copper hadn't doubled in price. ... and they are on track to do it again by first half 2022.
"I told you longs to sell yesterday at $745. You laughed. Now you're down $35 bucks from there in less than 24 hours, and I'm sure that $35 dollars times however many shares you had would be a nice little pay day today had you sold yesterday when I told you to, and were buying back in today down here, but you knew best (so said your greed), and unfortunately for you longs your greed mislead you like it does every single time and has since human records have been kept. Longs feel lousy today no doubt, even though their greed, which has ultimately caused them to feel lousy in the first place, will motivate their egos to post responses like ""I bought at $10 years ago so I couldn't careless today"" or something to that effect, when in fact they are feeling lousy and defeated because they were 100% wrong on yesterday's earnings and the effect it would have on the stock. Grow up longs and learn the lesson you're in school today for well because you clearly had too much greed and you're paying the price for it today. Told ya so yesterday, thanks."
First thing to understand about all companies getting into the EV space is the limitation in raw goods and second is the battery supply limitation. Tesla is somewhat controlling the entire world battery supply surplus (is there is a surplus). If you are Ford who actually has built a decent Mach E you really can’t ramp production much because of supply constraints related to batteries. These problems need to be resolved otherwise Tesla will continue running away from the competition. Prediction Ford and GM go bankrupt.
All bitcoin buyer are coming back to buy Tesla. I see green!!!
Heres a fact. Tesla has raised 10s of billions through selling shares. the company is not proven to be self sustaining...now when it's crunch time musk has overplayed his hand by venturing into cryptocurrencies and damaging the company's reputation. stability is key and i dont see that here.
"It looks like it will end beautifully today, and more upside the next couple of days before earnings on Monday.Remember, think long, stay calm and enjoy the ride up. Cheers."
Really a low margin business for TSLA. Only $430M net profit with $10.4B revenue. Volkswagen has 7B euro net profit of 60B euro revenue per quarter. TSLA profit margin will come under further pressure when new EV's are flooding the market.
Honestly have given up trying to convince people that owning some shares of Tesla will benefit them greatly long term. So shorties please just continue to sell and short the stock... would love to have my stocks at a discount before they blow up
"Explanation of trading the last 3 days. It rose almost 100 on COIN hype since TSLA owns Bitcoin. Also , the price of Bitcoin rose sharply at the same time. Now investors will take money out of TSLA to put directly into COIN. Thus todays drop. we may see more weakness now that there will be a direct way to buy Bitcoin."
"Shorties, you are getting less and less..... do you feel stranded by folks like Chanos closing out his short position? This would make a short squeeze much less interesting. Are you feeling stranded yet? :=)"
10 million cars. 20% margin is 100 billion profit. At a market cap of 700 billion today. We would be trading at 7 times earnings. !
model y not exactly selling like hot cakes. no semi no rObotaxi no cyber no fsd. delay delay delay. try to pump crypto's all in the musk handbook.
The next Apple. Everyone will be buying more Tesla shares after that news
Buying more shares after getting out at 680.00
All the other Tech stocks in Nasdaq are moving down. TSLA is being manipulated by bull institutions.
Would you hold such a stock over the weekend?
this joker doesn't know what's he is doing. used bitcoin to save his face (to show profit for his failing company) and tweets negatively now. company bankrupt soon
Look at the shorties now popping out of nowhere!!

All us market and stocks down while Tesla stock where Elon owns whole jar of jelly beans and he gets to control how simple is that? you see the benefits of owning jar of jelly beans you name your jelly price why not name a $1000 a jelly ? people will buy it Elon lol
Small beat on revenue due to China not impressing investors. Net cash outflow of 1.2 billion last quarter. Making company a Bitcoin play only complicates things.

"TSLA gained “fanfare” mass-producing a sub 3 second, 0 - 60 elapsed timesA very limited faction of consumers were overwhelmed, and rushed to buy the “incredible road rocket.” This has been a classic case of “flashings in the pan”....time will tell, however IMHO TSLA has shot its wad."

But none of the western countries are investing in the grid which would require upgrades on all levels. It would require plenty of additional coal, nuclear and gas power plants. It needs decades to build that many of them. The only countries prepared are China building hundreds of new coal plants and Norway with its surplus in hydropower. I assume it is the green vision of a poor, feudalistic society in which only a few selected will enjoy todays wealth. E.V.s and the search for the rare earth metals needed will ravage the environment"
Tesla website shows four to eight weeks for delivery of a Model Y that is ordered today. So it was just another lie on Musk's part that everything was sold out for the quarter. Probably another stunt to prop up the share price. The SEC really has to start doing their job.
"A good trader earns regardless of market fluctuations, I started investing using Edwin G. signals in june of last year, he shared his commercial techniques and helped me achieve my goals and now the profit rate is exponential. TeIegram> (@ Gregory012)."
"I like Tesla as a company and all - a lot of smart people there working on some cutting edge stuff in a bunch of different areas. But with a P/E this high, wouldn't this be equivalent to renting a house for $1500/month (all profit, no expenses) that you bought for $15.8M? I'm not shorting Tesla, and I am not knocking anyone who owns it, as I know a ton of people who own it, I'm just genuinely curious about this stock's valuation. And I understand how the current price of a stock can reflect the optimism shareholders may have for future earnings. But is that the case here? Do Tesla share holders expect this company to one day make ~50x more earnings than it currently is making? I appreciate any constructive answer to this. Thank You."
Burn the shorts forever ! All they can do is to cover their positions; this is a company with great financial fundamentals and innovation. Expect the stock price hit $850 by the earnings day

Hmm looks like allot of big tech companies aren't really reacting to positive news anymore. Could this be the market top.

Tesla car in crash Didn't Even Have FSD Installed in it!!!
Up we gooooo.
"For fun, let’s say energy bus will be as big as cars. Cars will likely do 500 billion in sales. So this means 1 trillion in Revenue. Appl does about 350?billion in sales. So Tesla could easily have a market cap double AAPL. So 2-3 trillion market cap is not that unreasonable. Then you the throw another 300-500 billion market cap for taxi and a max upside might be 3.5 trillion. This would imply share price between 2,000-5,000 per share."
"Printing WATERED STOCK has been TSLA’s greatest revenue producer.It’s as if TSLA/Musk fanboys haven’t noticed the connection between the watered stock Musk puts in his pocket as profit, and the dollars the fanboys remove from their pocket to pay for TSLA stock."
"Ford Motor (F) warned on April 29 that it expects to produce 1.1 million fewer vehicles this year, due to the semiconductor shortage. I'm wondering if the sales drop is really caused by the semiconductor shortage."
"Tesla was said to have introduced its futuristic ""Full Self-Driving"" package. Do you think this company could take the tech giant's tactics to the auto industry? In addition, these other companies were said to have established high-volume manufacturing engineering using a high-tech approach backed by data science. Make your travel experience extra great with this sponsored post! https://b.link/ExcitingMainstreamTrillionWorthSector These other companies seem to have good leadership as well as strong performance! Check the disclaimer on the landing page."
"The prospects for Tesla have become increasingly cloudy.The stocks already took a dip from unsustainable levels before it became clear that inflation and interest rates are picking up, and that the central banks will sooner or later have to withdraw from their policies of ultra-cheap money. This has already caused some rotation out of growth stocks whose business models and IRR expectations depend heavily on low interest rates, i.e. moderate discounting of future earnings.This process has only just begun, and for sure stock prices will not decline in a straight line but they will.For Tesla, the market environment has changed particularly. It has become clear that substantial competition is coming up faster that expected, and recent sales figures have not been overly reassuring. The pandemic will stay for a while, the 3rd wave is already running through Europe and it will also reach the US. The environment does not allow a significant pick up in car sales.Then we also have the chip shortage, causing production cuts and not even allowing to fulfill the actual demand.On top of all of that, Tesla is running into problems in China, the decisive market for all car manufacturer these days. Chinese officials have questioned Tesla`s integrity regarding data handling. While this is only relevant for government properties in the first step, it will impact the overall market. Chinese customers are very sensitive when it comes to integrity of their personal data, they are already exposed to extensive surveillance of their private lives. This is not a good sign for Tesla`s market prospects in China.With all of that background, we need to expect the Tesla stock to pull back significantly. Everybody knows that, but for sure the prominent market players need to avoid a stampede. This goes for the overall market (this is why Mr. Powell shows up frequently to reassure the market that all will be good), and this goes for Tesla in particular (this is why Ark Invest issues astronomical price targets). Everyone wants the upcoming process to be as smoothly and quietly as possible, in order to allow themselves to pull out in an orderly fashion.Cathy Wood is fully loaded with Tesla. Her funds have reached the max. Tesla holding allowed, so she can't even push the stock with her own means any longer (apart from rosy price predictions). Now, with the current situation evolving, she needs to find a way out which at the same time allows her to save her face.You can rest assured that she will - and that other big players - will find a way out somehow. They are well coordinated with these things, and they have the means and tools to get out without major damage to their numbers. The damage will remain with the smaller, individual investors. Those which are either involved in the Ark funds, or who hold shares directly.They will suffer the pain if they stick with the stock too long.THIS is the right time to get out of the stock. It is still heavily overvalued, given the actual market conditions and Tesla`s prospects going forward. At the same time, this provides a unique opportunity to sell the shares at decent prices before the inevitable market correction.This is no financial advice, just my 2 Cents. I really like the cars. I admire Elon Musk for his entrepreneurial vision.The stock prices are however unsustainably inflated.You need to make your own choices. Anyway, whatever you do, pls be ultra-critical when it comes to the professionals reassuring you that all will go on like before, and that TSLA will go to the moon. Just watch these people show up more and more often in a short amount of time, there is a reason for that."
I am selling 2000 shares! There is Ceo risk with this company.
Cathie sets a new price target for Tesla that is 3 times the entire auto industry . How do we get there folks? Fully autonomous robo taxis that are still 15 years away minimum? Solar roofs when one of the only things people buy less frequently than cars is a new roof? So much more downside than up at these over inflated levels
This going to be $20 stock

No arguments to be red
"Who would have thought this would go down... everyone that can do simple math and knows that no matter how ""good"" their earnings were they would never live up anywhere close to the price of the stock."
There are two ways to look at what happened. TSLA was creative in the numbers delivered with bitcoin etc. OR TSLA had to do all of this in the wake of competition to meet the numbers. You decide. ..Unless they come up with driverless cars that everyone accepts using or making cars that can fly :) ...this thing is coming down. Hype game is over i think. ...

Margin calls have begun- more sell orders coming for the long accounts with leverage.
"A GUY with good investment vision: He began buying Tesla at just $7.50, and now he’s retiring at 39 years old with $12 million worth — he still refuses to sell a single share“No, I don’t think so. The energy and transportation sectors are being disrupted, and Tesla’s stock price reflects that,” DeBolt explained. “I think we could eventually see $20,000 to $30,000 per share by 2030 if they can execute, assuming no more stock splits.”He said he currently owns 14,850 Tesla shares at an average cost basis of $58 each. His first purchase was 2,500 shares at $7.50 in 2013. That batch is now worth about $2.2 million, he said.“This company is just getting started,” DeBolt told Ramp. “We might not see a company like Tesla in the next 50 years.”"
I love all the FUD. Please bring down the price so I can buy even more!

"Can someone help explain this to me: Tesla's gross revenue between 2019 and 2020 grew by 29%. The year before that, gross revenue barely grew at all. Can someone explain to me how a company with a PE ratio between 900-1000 is justified when growth isn't really isn't that amazing? I mean 29% growth in top line revenue is great, but a 30-40 PE ratio would be justified with that growth. I understand Tesla has a lot of big ideas, but right now their revenue growth doesn't justify the price...can someone explain what I am missing?"
"For those who want to play call options through earnings, you’re better off buying long. Any option that is otm after earnings, is going to lose all its value because if volatility crush. That is an $850 near term call will be zero even if the stock goes up to $800 after earnings.Most of the time the stock doesn’t move much through earnings and the one time that it did gives you the illusion that earnings and options mean big gains. The market makers win the option game most of the time. GL"
I see how this will turn out next earnings. Numbers will look horrible due to the value of their bitcoin crashing over 50% sparking a massive sell off. The time is right to short Tesla now!
I thought Cathie Wood has $3k price target.
"I don't care if a stock is over valued. I only care if it will be even more overvalued tomorrow, or next week."
We could close above 700 today 
"Closed above 700. You know what they say, resistance becomes support."

The misuse of “overvalued” is right up there in deceptiveness as the old “cash burn” mantra. Tesla is guilty of neither. Both analogies are oxymorons.

I bought friday at 704 what should i do guys?
"If I'm not mistaken AMZN has placed firm orders for electric heavy trucks from TSLA as well as a variety of other companies. If it hasn't happened yet that is coming soon. TSLA will be growing its family of vehicles over time. Volvo, Freightliner, Peterbilt, and the other semi truck manufacturers will be forced to start developing their own electric semis. It's not a question of if the vehicle industry will become fully electric but when. There is no question that EVs of all types of vehicles will be on the road in far greater numbers by 2035."
My guess is before the 26th at least the stock will go down further maybe at lowest I'd say around 650-ish but that will be a prime time to buy the stock because I suspect it's gonna go up from there I highly doubt it will go to a 1000 but around 800 isn't a bad target.
"Ford said it sold 6,614 Mach-Es in the first quarter. Tesla, the industry's electric vehicle leader, said it delivered a record 184,800 cars worldwide in the quarter."

"I think bulls should take a 3% drop as a good sign. Analysts have let Tesla kick the can down the road further. The fact that they don't make money building and selling cars is still, still, not a significant concern for them and they are going to let the company remain 10x the value of all those other car makers that DO make money building and selling cars.Good for you!! This can only be evaluated as a big positive.(Until it's not).Congratulations on your success!! Guru."

"These are quotes from the fire chief on the Tesla crash, “With respect to the fire fight, unfortunately, those rumors grew way out of control. It did not take us four hours to put out the blaze. Our guys got there and put down the fire within two to three minutes, enough to see the vehicle had occupants. After that, it was simply cooling the car as the batteries continued to have a chain reaction due to damage.“We could not tear it apart or move it around to get ‘final extinguishment’ because the fact that we had two bodies in there and it was then an investigation-slash-crime scene. We had to keep it cool, were on scene for four hours, but we were simply pouring a little bit of water on it. It was not because flames were coming out. It was a reaction in the battery pan. It was not an active fire,” Buck said.“We did not (call Tesla), and I do not know where (that rumor) came from. There is a chance someone else did, maybe the Harris County Fire Marshal, but we did not call (Tesla). Tesla has an emergency manual for first responders,” Buck said. More disinformation from the shorts trying to make a buck. Our country really needs a law on Truth In Reporting. Just like we have Truth in Lending and Truth in Advertising. So many lies in the news, on everything!"

Ford is no kid on the block and yet they have already recalled every Mach E’s. Did they rush to market ??? And they announced 50,000 Mach E,s for the YEAR ! Model Y will do that in a MONTH. GM had to create a computer generated commercial for the Hummer it is still 3 years away GM almost partnered with Nikola thATS WHOW desperate THEY ARE TO catch up to TESLA NIKOLA THE BIGGEST SCAM OF THE century. Toyota still playing with Hydrogen. Mercedes benz Cancelling EV projects for now.

"As predicted, now that Hyubdai and other Asian cars are in the mix, they make Teslas look pretty bad and no one can deny the horrible build quality of Tesla. It's not their doom by any means, but there's also nothing special anymore and that fact makes the valuation absolutely bonkers. Worth picking up at 50 bucks."
"According to Cathy's projection Tesla would have 50% market share in 2025. I just don't believe it. More like 10% is realistic. Also the estimated gross margin is way too high. The competition will be fierce. I also have major difficulty to believe FSD will be near close to ready for robotaxis. Cathy think it's 50% probability, but I would say no chance. More like 2030."

The people holding up the permits of the Tesla Berlin plant claim that the plant will use 30% of the regions water. They don't want it to open because of this. So one might ask if it is possible that this plant never opens. Or at least remains closed until they can move the high water usage processes out of the region. No permits have been approved. They are building at risk.

With a share price of $15 today, but a price target of $50, he's predicting that CleanSpark will turn into a three-bagger in under a year. (To watch Dayal's track record, click here)"
Roller coaster again in the am then up

above $575 is a band aid at least. next resistance to overcome is $595 - let’s hope this will happen by monday.
Tesla is a 70.00 stock and when it crashes the fraud I investigations will begin. Elon is part Madoff part pt barnum
coconuts kill 150 people a year. Way worse than Teslas
Sales of Tesla in China has dropped 43% in the last 30 days
I see Green RIP SHORTERS
"Shorts dilemma: How to cover before the earnings critical mass on April 26. I call this the critical mass earnings because it will be the first time that 4 of TSLA's "" earnings streams all contribute significantly to earnings. Ziv credits + Battery storage + software = auto sales. I predict between $2 to $3.25."
"Oh boy, not red again"

"Every quarter Tesla catches flack for so much carbon credit revenue. Money is money. Carbon credits are essentially a ""product"" that Elon had the forethought to produce. Tesla will keep reaping hundreds of millions per year in carbon credit sales until the industry catches up. Carbon credit revenue will gradually decline as revenue from other sources emerge. Brilliant business, actually to create a technologically revolutionary car and energy company."
What are the best operational strategies books?
Well. That soufflé came crashing down...
"People dont realize it will be a 4000$ stock by 2030 or earlier, buy now!!"
"Why is it down after hours? Here's why. Excluding record ZEV credit sales of $518 M and $101M in Bitcoin sales, Tesla generated a Q1 operating loss of -$25M. Underlying business net income (loss) -$181M. Revenue declined 3.3% quarter over quarter. Excluding regulatory credits, revenue declined 4.6% quarter over quarter. This is not what you'd expect from a company with a $700 billion stock market valuation."
"To those that think TSLA has gone to the moon, it has...now just FYI the moon isn't the highest object up there, so that means lets see where MUSK can take this to. Maybe Jupiter?"
Nice $50 drop since Friday. Bye to my profits. :/
Inflation is definitely going to effect Tesla..I'm sticking to ExxonMobil.
Cathie loading tsla now
Big earnings coming
Who doesn’t want a Tesla?
Is the whole market trending down or just every stock that I chose to buy?
It’s going fall by earnings thanks me later
"GM, Mercedes, and three others are going to eat your lunch..This company is run by the 21st Century Pied Piper of Hamelin..Get out while you still have money."
I’ve always found it amusing the way shareholders make these unsupported claims about share price going to $xxx or some outlandish price........what do these people think? Do they believe others will believe that price is likely .....and follow up buying with the unsupported target as a justifiable price
"@LONG, SEE YOU GUYS AT"
these movements are like....
Sellllllll......
Tesla car self-drives into a tree. Both occupants were killed and neither of the occupants were driving. Who's at fault? Elon Musk? Not really. Someone in the car should have been paying attention to where the vehicle was going. Don't worry. The crash won't hurt the stock. 20 crashes wouldn't hurt the stock which will continue to climb. Investors are only concerned with sales and not safety.
Up and down syndrome = sideways before a big move
GM Bolt catches fire burns house down no a peep on the news. VW ID3 bricked still nothing. ID4 ?? Lucid delays everything scam ?? Hyundai recalls all EV’s battery issues anything on the news NOPE. Tesla crash n burn no driver did anyone care to report honestly NOPE !! The big boys are trying desperately to take Tesla down probably the big 3 plus the Oil industry. But it’s too late ! Tesla has already won.
"Ford Mach E is destroying Tesla!!! Ford EV Q1 sales 6,614. Tesla 184,800 "
"It is heading towards 110-160 eventually or might plateau on a higher level depending on how long the process actually takes. The company is doing well, the valuation makes people who went through a dotcom bubble blush.I think eventually Tesla will be worth 600 fundamentally but it will likely take untill 2027 with continues high growth and without competition."
Closing GREEN! No Worries! Just another chance to buy! Earnings coming soon! going up!
OOOOOOHHHHHHHH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
TSLA is going to ZERO!!!!!!!!!!!
"Frankie owns Tesla, Frankie trades Tesla, Frankie loves Tesla!"
Going to test 590 today
"Today is closing green, probably $750"
Elon had a really strong SNL appearance. Could this cause tesla to moon on monday???
Imagine being on a yahoo message board thinking your comments move stocks. Lmao
Is it worth buying Tesla now?
"So cute. All these little Tesla ants, trying to keep this 100 pound boulder from continuing down a 45 degree slope. A few get flattened, but are immediate replaced by a few more. Adorable."
Tesla will get you in places you want to go!!!
"This can't be, Cathie Deadwood and Felon Musk said $3000 per share. Since when can't a ponzi scheme I mean company be successful by making all its money by government subsidies and using company money to invest in Bitcoin."
Wow. Investing in electric vehicles has never been so... fakecoin/ guilt credit.. going to Mars with your savings? Good luck ladies. Sold out & won’t return. Doyyyyy!!!
"Step back, waaaaay back. Look at the amount of EV companies and cars coming. I worry bout TSLA even with its ecosystem of data, battery, and other associated projects. It’s can’t rely on its vehicle sales with the competition heating up in supporting its valuation. It’s gonna take a haircut. What are its other drivers? A bloated overweight cyber truck?"
"Tesla's Entire Future Depends On This. If Tesla Can Achieve It, What Will It Do for the Stock Price?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQcRjFRsfb8"
This being above 713 also means whole market is now in uber bullish melt up mode...
"The new Tesla Toilet is sold out for the next three years. Life changing innovations. 1 million reservations ($10, refundable deposit). A few software glitches, and a several unfortunate non-life threatening injuries, when males inadvertently engaged ""ATR Mode"". Musk ensures new code in a few month will rectify the problem, via an OTA upgrade. Elon Musk, always finding the solution, to a non-existing problem. (Automatic Tampon Removal)"
"Question for Telsa longs waiting for FSD: Why is it taking so long? TSLA has such a huge number of miles (100's of millions) of data, why is it still in beta?If the cameras in a TSLA were adequate for fully autonomous driving, why is it taking so long. Musk predicted robo taxis in 2020. Yet, TSLA has far more vehicles on the road now.Cruise has autonomous taxis in a limited trial with a fraction of TSLA's miles of data.So what is keeping TSLA back?"
In regard to the accident that took 2 lives. I just think it is very hard to believe that the people who bought Tesla know for sure that the auto pilot feature doesn't work 100% yet but still want to give it a try and sit in the passenger seat vice the driver seat. It is just unbelievable! Could it be that the driver was in the driver seat and crashed the car but someone like Tesla Shorts or hater twisted the story?
"TSLA is a true bubble, reminiscent of CSCO in 2000. Yes, TSLA will survive as an auto manufacturer; however, as CSCO survives at a fraction of former OVERVALUATION"
Como se dice timber?
Cathie is jumping for joy I’m sure
$800 by this Friday!!!!
Ok so stand back and look At the whole picture here Elon Musk genius Elon Musk future Elon Musk tesla stock is just a short term down few days ..THIS STOCK WILL BE 1500 BERY SOON FIRST 989 THEN 1500
"I thought the ""buy at the dip"" was yesterday. Is this another one, how cool is that? Elon is my God."
"Elon musk seems drinking and smoking too heavily. With too much gaining weight and drinkit too much, and having too much fun with family, tsla is going to be the best but not appoe best."
Tesla still gonna bounce up n down for a couple quarters but I see it passing $1000 before end of year and growing $1000+ every year for at least the next 10 years

Buy under 600 is gift this hit 700 anytime
"Could anyone point me to any videos of the Cyber Truck going through it's off-road trials? Since production begins in 6 months, Tesla must currently be conducting hundreds of rigorous testing cycles. Known for leaking photos and videos, I am impressed (yet disappointed) on how well Tesla has kept these activities clandestine. Obviously, they do not want to give any possible competition (as if there is any) any advance information, but it sure would be cool to see the Beast in action. Rivian has been showing their testing videos, and they are impressive, but Musk says Cyber Truck will be even better: cheaper, faster, more versatile, higher towing capacity, and have superior off-road performance, so I am like so geeked. But the suspense is killing me! Only 6 months to go.., can't wait!"
I'm confused as to why TSLA isn't a $1000 stock right now. Confused and greedy so I buy more. $$$
printing my money ... shorted at 700.... Michael Burry is on my side hehe
After earning 900
"Teslas build Model Y's in Shanghai, ships most to Germany. Germany Tesla plant to begin building Model Y's in Q4. So where are those Chinese Model Y's going then? Botswana?"
"Tesla trades on pure emotion. Boards like this are turning into a self-help support group for longs. If it traded on any rational basis of analysis, you know what would happen."
Close $580
I will start buying Tesla in the low $200s and all the way into the $100s.
Tesla is completely liable in the latest accident. NTSB has stated previously that Tesla does not have enough safeguards in place to prevent people from tricking the system. Plus they market it as a no hands system when it clearly is not. Tesla has shown time and time again that they are willing to risk the lives of their customers.
Hold very steady with huge volume!
Selling at the end of the day Monday
Got in at $340 back in September.. rode the roller coaster ride up to 100% gains.. Tesla this Tesla that but they keep steam rolling along. Looking to add on the dip .. and this this back up. Tesla an amazing company not just a one trick pony. 
Sell everything and buy Tesla!!!!!
this stock is not going anywhere. way way over value. when correction comes the stock will be back around 200 max

"Latest accident involving Tesla leaves one traffic officer dead and one injuredPhate ZhangMay 18, 2021(Updated with the latest police bulletin, which says one has died and the other is out of life-threatening condition.)"
"Bitcoin up almost 6% this morning. For TESLA and stock holders that means that TESLA has already gained over $100,000,000 in cash just on their Bitcoin investment."
"I purchased Tesla at $35 the first time I bought. And then I sold far too early and bought back at $295. Fisker (FSR) is an excellent value today, especially closing in on that infrastructure bill. They sold off hard because of that hedge fund liquidation last week. Nonetheless, it’s a worthy investment today and may double by August... the benefits of being high-growth and undervalued..."
The question still remains .... with inflation going to the moon will they be able to keep the prices at the same level? What about Chip shortage? If they say anything about guidance not looking good due to theses issue tesla will tank after hours! That’s a Fact! No matter how good are the earnings since Wall Street already knows we all know that they will have good earnings they are not looking at that they want to know the short term futures with both factors: Inflation & Chip shortage 
According o VOA news article Chinese government is going after Tesla in China because they need military space technology from Musk company. Chinese government is after a bigger fish than little car.
"Do you see Tesla copying Ford? No, the Cyber truck looks nothing like a Ford. Do you see Ford copying Tesla? Yes, they basically took what Tesla started and packaged it in the same old Ford body. A leader is now a follower. That says it all, and just makes me more bullish on Tesla."
"There are still 46,270,000 TSLA shares that are Open SHORTS positions that have not YET been covered or closed!!! Still waiting for the Payout from SHORTS!"
So people who didn't buy over the last few days are buying today? lmao.
"average annual income in India is less than $2,200. usd. how many tesla cost under 10k? 5x annual salaries....just saying"
"Tesla cutting prices <<==== ok I'll explain this again In general new models sell well. People want them. They want to be the first to get them. So the car companies sell fully loaded models with lots of options. And usually buyers are more than happy to pay full price, As the design ages the model become less desirable BUT the company still needs to keep production going so they remove content and lower prices. Then after a few profitable (key word) years they invest one or two billion and do a redesign. Teslas Model S was never profitable. Like the Roadster it never sold enough copies to make money. As the design aged Tesla couldn't find buyers - even with lowered prices: Model S sales in the USA:2016 - 29,4212017 - 27,0602018 - 25,7452019 - 14,1002020- 17,500Model S Sales in Europe2017 - 16,0262018 - 17,3862019 - 8,6352020 - 5,562 <== Yes these are annual sales numbers not monthly sales"
"Institutional manipulations, maybe!!?? They sell in after hours to consolidate their purchases in the a.m. prehour trading can see more decline? Suspect around mid morning a whiplash surge approaching 800. Not wise to sell a winner, PERIOD!"
"Fortunely, $Tsla will go down and $NIO up.Heavy bearish signs in Tsla chart while $NIO is getting stronger and stronger plus has a bullish divergence in weekly chart with last friday close.$TSLA monthly chart still nearly oversold, Breakdown of the rising wedge pattern with a hanging man and gravestone Doji yesterday. Bullish Breakout in NIO imminent, further breakdown in tsla with all the negative news and NIO stealing the greatest deal in history from Tsla (Sinopec) you should switch the boat to NIO as soon as you can. The Tesla cultists are still pumping but 600$ Bn dollar for an already failing company with global more and more competition and NIO eating the ground in China TSLA is standing on, this ship is a sinking one, the upward breakout was clearly fake due to bitcoin Investition of Tsla but bitcoin also fell out of the rising wedge pattern with heavy volume .... SWITCH TO $NIO, SWITCH TO THE FUTURE OF EVS"
Below 500 by Friday
Are you guys buying on the dips?

Why Buying A Tesla With Bitcoin Isn't Really A Good Idea: http://snd.qlitrk.com/r/sdaju
"TSLA will be a bargain at $35 per share. $40 billion market cap seems fair for this small and growing, but unprofitable company. I can't wait to buy it up on the cheap and finally go long."
Bought 2 shares of TSLA today at $732. I apologize in advance if the stock drops to $500.....pretty much the story of my stock investments...
"You can say whatever you want, you can try to make the stock move like whatever what you want. The fact remains that Tesla business is never this good and it is only the beginning."
Today’s move to 30k on Bitcoin will have a negative impact on earnings of Elon really does have diamond hands!!
I concerned about SEC investigations and lawsuits regarding crypto manipulation
Tesla the only tech stock down today.Your bipolar techno king is to blame piszing off the crypto investors
Tesla says first quarter sale could be low due to chip shortage but this would not fall under the first quarter sales it would be the second quarter. I think it is lack of car sales...........
Bought 50 over the course of the day!

"ADELIA CELLINI LINECKERSun, April 25, 2021, 8:00 AMTesla is expected to report a big Q1 earnings gain late Monday, after notching a 109% increase in deliveries."
LOL! Tesla gets noncompliance to the Clean Air Act from the EPA
"The fallacy: Competition will hurt Tesla. The truth: Competition will hurt legacy autos. Tesla will lose market share but it's growth will increase because of an expanding EV pie. The expanding EV pie will come at the expense of a shrinking ICE pie. The irony is that legacy autos MUST enter the EV space; however, doing so comes at the future destruction of their more profitable ICE vehicles. Legacy autos are killing themselves. So when I hear BS from Morgan Stanley about Ford's Mustang's Mach-E hurting Tesla I laugh. The only thing the Mach-E sales is hurting is FORD and GM and other legacy autos. Basically, the Mach-E sales means it replaced very profitable ICE sales. Like other legacy autos, Ford loses money on it's EV sales. The reality is Tesla is the most efficient manufacturer of EVs on the planet."
$800 on Monday!
"Tesla 2020: ""Best invention since sliced bread!""Tesla 2021: ""TSLA is toast!"" (Thanks, michael, for the comedic material)"
Tesla's future so bright its investors have to wear shades.
"I think Tesla cars are cool.. but it's also plainly obvious that Elon as CEO went to the casino this quarter.. put everything on RED (bitcoin)... in a hail mary to squeak out a profit this quarter. Without Bitcoin casino money and EV credits, earnings would have been negative. If any other CEO went to Vegas and put all their cash on RED at the roulette wheel to make a profitable quarter happen they would be crucified. Once again, I like TSLA products... I just don't see them becoming a money making machine like Apple with 40% profit margins. Yet, they are priced PE wise far higher than Apple."
New shorts will cover over $725 today and push us to a $750 close

The construction of the German plant in Europe was started without a building permit and a production start is not in sight at all, the company's profits are in a ridiculous range etc."
Gonna tank tomorrow!!!!!
$768 new stop! Resistance level
Roth Capital said Tesla’s fair value is $150. Should I wait?
get ready for split price soon. just like Apple. still sitting at 10 month old price
Tesla WAS years ahead with the EV industry and has blown the entire lead. Literally every car manufacturer out there will be caught up with them or ahead by the end of next year.
"Tesla Raises prices for the 4th time in a month, Bulls thought it meant demand was high and that's a good sign, really what it means is rising production costs, shrinking margins, supply constraints, and loss of market share."
I'm a value investor. I'm trying to figure out which one is more undervalued: TSLA or GME?
Big pump today and still the volume was significantly below average. Not many buyers at this level. This dog looks tired. This could be trouble for longs. Time will tell. Finished aquiring my Jan Puts that were on sale today. Good luck to all.

Musk conduct is the same as Maddoff in the 90’s and 2005-2008. Even worse as he manipulates the markets to his own convenience Nobody would dare to investigate Bernie because he was Bernie as nobody investigates Musk for being Musk today. What happened afterwards is well known.
"""Fatal Self Driving"" aka FSD"
"Valuation seems expensive, but only for few people. Many analysts project much higher share prices. That's because they recognized the tremendous potential of tesla for the next years to come. Elon Musk may be selling shorts again sooner than some people think."
Maybe green tomorrow but the downtrend has begun. We will see more lows than highs. Tesla is heading to a disaster

I dont even have their shares but I like Tesla and think they are a great company and will change the auto space completely.

"If (when) it is commonly acknowledged that Tesla's FSD will never come to fruition, in it's current configuration (meaning every Tesla on the road is already obsolete), what will be the fair price of TSLA?Elon's ego will not accept the huge error Tesla made (under his direction) by resorting to only the use of cameras, and the longer he tries to continue with the charade, the further Tesla will fall behind. Many studies on autonomous driving already puts Tesla dead last. Even his top engineers (most no longer with Tesla) repeatedly stated LIDAR would be required for level 4 and 5 autonomy, and perhaps even level 3. (Disclaimer: I am short TSLA, and disdain Elon Musk)"

Telsa is not a car company...it's an IQ test for the market.
"When Elon Musk said in Q3 2020, that he expected to make 2% in profits on selling his cars, he didn't say WHEN he expected to start making 2% in profits from selling cars. Certainly not last year, and this year is not off to a good start either.Don't worry, selling at 18x sales is no big deal for unprofitable companies in this new world economy. It will all work out sometime in the future. If not, then the shares may start to trade more like other money losing auto manufacturers. 0.3x book value is where most of them sit. That would put the valuation around $5 billion. That's a pretty steep fall from $750 billion, but I would never suppose it would get there in a rational way. Think 3-5 years to work it's way down. So lot's of time to work out how to control costs, get the economics in place for lower car prices, figure out how to market and then sell cars just like all of the other car companies. I suspect 1x sales will be the bottom in about 5 years.Guru."
"Tesla Cybertruck should go into limited production at the end of 2021, and the F150 BEV should be in mass production in 2022. Does it seem reasonable that everyone will wait for a Cybertruck when there will be other options available from dealers with a broad network and a history of quality vehicles and support?There are a LOT of unknowns about vehicles like this in the tough working world. It will be interesting to see how it all plays out. I suspect there will be a lot of people interested in the 'unique' styling of the Cybertruck, but I would hazard to guess that most who work for a living will prefer a 4x8 bed on their truck.Guru."

"It's funny how dump money lost money on $GME and then $TSLA and then $DOGE.I even know who lost over $200k on all three and still holding until he loses everything.Just sad.Think about all these crytos - the founders were busy dumping their initial coins that they rarely develop their actual technology/platforms. Actually, there is no sales/revenue/service provided ever.In real world, companies raise money in stock and use the money to complete their products/services. Once revenue/profit is generated, the company starts paying out dividends forever.What about all these coins? Nothing and all these coin trading activities are done by fake trades from bots to inflate transactions/liquidities. Proof? Look at the trade vols, spreads, size of blocks - nothing matches and several exchanges went burst (due to lack of capital when they are milking it with commissions?)Soon, regulators will audit the exchanges and criminal activities will be prosecuted.Think about one thing - who is the market maker for coins? and who has capital to provide liquidity?How come the trading vol is about 10x - 15x greater than actual?IMO, $COIN needs to be audited asap along with other counterparties who create all these transactions."

TSLA $1K!!!
Tesla is going to rocket 
"Lol, a P/E ratio of 580. Fords new EV F150 wipes the floor with the Cyber beanbag mobile. Volkswagen, and Ford are going to chew into Teslas market share like a great Canadian beaver. This stock is worth about $60/share and it's share price collapse will be epic and memorable."

Don’t trust this share anymore…it could drop to 420 in a matter of days if the bear market continues
How you feel about Kathy woods?
just wondering if Reuters has an arrangement with legacy auto makers to keep releasing bad pr On Tesla. REUTERS GIVE IT A REST ALREADY what a joke
The only thing good about the drop is Nancy Pelosi husband bought options when it was $750. Maybe she'll have to work until she's 90.

"The mechanism of the bubble stock scams. It's beyond a simple pump and dump.The stock prices (and bitcoin as well) are hyped primarily by people who are investing other peoples money. They don't care that it is a bubble and must collapses eventually. The loss won't be theirs. It will be their investors loss. In the meantime they collect fees based on the inflated values. This is why stock analysts are continually upping their ""targets"" for TSLA. Their employers want Bullish reports to help hype values. The rare Bearish analyst is someone who is being honest because he feels a need to enhance his credibility. This is why they frequently have bad track records. Too many Bullish calls that went bad, so they need to pick an easy one: a bubble stock that must fall eventually.The Ark group takes 0.75% of ""asset value"" as its fee. So, there simply is there incentive to hype value of worthless assets or push asset prices far above their true worth. If TSLA stock trades at $1000/share, Ark gets a cash ""dividend"" in the form of it's management fee of $7.50/share in the form of it's management fee. What do ordinary shareholders get in the way of a dividend: NOTHING.The supposed $3000 price target is simply part of the scam.This will, one day, all end very badly for the longs, the fund managers will be very rich."
"Extreme bad news for $Tsla. Sinopec, giant with 35000 gas stations along china, decided itself for $NIO s universal battery solutions with battery swap and many more, after speakings with Tsla years ago about building a charging network failed.Sinopec will build together with NIO thousands of Battery facilities along china within the next years and not with Tsla. Very bad news for Tsla. Tsla may ""eat NIOs lunch in china"" for now – thats not true because this market is huge and both still at the beginning – but NIO is eating the ground, Tsla is standing on in china.I have never heard such bad news than this for Tsla, this is devastating and will force Tsla in the long haul to pay NIO to be able to use its facilities and battery changing system because Battery swap will now become the standard along china, only future multi trillion dollar ev data robotaxi market.Cheers to all $NIO LONGS hold your shares for at least 5 years and thank me in our nio houses/ future nio millionaires and billionaires clubs."

"VoltaXplore: An Electric Vehicle Battery Manufacturing Company MONTREAL, April 15, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NanoXplore Inc. (""NanoXplore"") (TSX-V: GRA and OTCQX: NNXPF) and Martinrea International Inc. (“Martinrea”) (TSX: MRE) announce that they have formed a joint venture, VoltaXplore Inc. (“VoltaXplore”), a battery-based initiative to service the electric transportation and grid storage market.VoltaXplore will initially build a demonstration facility to develop and produce electric vehicle (EV) batteries enhanced with graphene, one of the world’s thinnest and strongest materials, with tremendous characteristics. The venture combines NanoXplore’s position as a world leader in the science and production of graphene and graphene-enhanced materials and Martinrea’s expertise as a leading manufacturer of automotive and industrial parts, specializing in Lightweight Structures and Propulsion Systems. VoltaXplore will be developing and manufacturing Li-Ion battery cells for electric vehicles initially in a new 1MWh facility in Montreal. The joint venturers believe that graphene-enhanced batteries will considerably improve existing battery performance.Following a successful demonstration of improved battery performance using graphene and based on positive customer feedback as well as building the business case, VoltaXplore intends to build and commission a 10GWh battery cell manufacturing facility in Canada.NanoXplore and Martinrea have each invested $4 million initially into VoltaXplore as startup capital to support the construction of demonstration facility, with each committed to provide up to an additional $6 million in development funding if, as and when required. NanoXplore and Martinrea each hold a 50% equity interest in VoltaXplore. Pat D’Eramo, Martinrea’s President and CEO, will be VoltaXplore’s Chairman and Soroush Nazarpour, NanoXplore’s founder and CEO, will be VoltaXplore’s CEO. Both are the initial directors. Each company will provide critical scientific, development and manufacturing expertise as appropriate.Soroush Nazarpour commented:“Graphene is a really exciting material for improved performance in Li-ion batteries. It increases the charging speed and capacity of the batteries while improving safety by enabling batteries to work at lower temperatures. VoltaXplore will benefit from using NanoXplore’s graphene-enhanced silicon anode formulation and will manufacture cylindrical Li-ion cells. One of the keys to an electric vehicle future is significantly improved batteries, and we believe we can be a part of the solution, both at VoltaXplore and as a graphene provider at NanoXplore. We believe the successful development of graphene enhanced batteries will result in the need for high volumes of graphene powder. We continue to benefit from our partnership with Martinrea, and this is another step in our successful working relationship.”Pat D’Eramo commented:“We are an increasing part of the EV landscape, and are very excited to continue to work with NanoXplore, as we have to date in manufacturing operations and in developing the world’s first graphene-enhanced brake lines that will go on vehicles this summer. Martinrea continues to expand its EV product portfolio, including battery trays and electric motor housings, where we have product wins with leading customers, including OEMs and EV suppliers such as Samsung. VoltaXplore is a natural next step for us, as we combine our abilities to make great products with NanoXplore’s leading work in the graphene space.’’About NanoXplore Inc.NanoXplore is a graphene company, a manufacturer and supplier of high-volume graphene powder for use in industrial markets.

"DOVER, Del. (AP) — A Delaware judge on Monday ordered lawyers representing Tesla Inc. directors to turn over certain communications that CEO Elon Musk may have shared with the company’s top in-house attorneys before the board approved a compensation plan in 2018 that could net Musk more than $50 billion.The ruling came in response to a motion filed on behalf of shareholders who have accused Musk and Tesla’s board of directors of breaching their fiduciary duties to the company and its stockholders, granting unjust enrichment to Musk and wasting corporate assets."

"So strange the Chinese consumers are LESS likely to overlook flaws and poor build quality, then the American counterpart. What happened? In the 1970's, the U.S was building junk (I know, I was working on an assembly line at the time, summer internship). But we bought the #$%$ anyway, as there were few choices. The Asian Invasion force GM, Ford, and Chrysler, to step it up, and ultimately, everyone benefited (except for a few thousand laid-off UAW members). The same has been true for EVs in the past year. But now numerous OEMs are launching superior quality vehicles, and most won't care that they don't make fart noises. Time for Tesla to ""step it up"" and build world-class cars; they are not even close."

Bravo!!! my goal has been reached (I put 747 this morning). next resistance is 780. Congrats to all longs! LOL ...
Tesla is a car company that pumped its own sales Bc the owner bought a bunch of Tesla’s for a bull project drilling tunnels in LV.
TSLA today:Puts DownCalls DownStock DownNow turn that frown upside down.Thanks.
The comments I see coming from shorts are hilarious. Man you guys talk a lot for a group that’s lost so much $ over the past years. Talk the talk but have nothing to back it up. Go buy NIO 
load up the next few days!! will drop till the earnings!!
Thanks for the free shares. Tesla's earnings are always good for a sell off or rally. Either way longs make $$$ if they do it right. I guess we'll have to wait a little longer for the 1000 sp.
Musk is a twot.
Proud of the TSLA fam !! Burning shorts together always feels good
Elon is touting doge coin which could surpass Tesla. Oh the irony.
It is going to bounce back up like it normally does... I hope you all loaded up yesterday. I bought more and so glad I did... here we go...up up and away
WHAT DID I TELL YOU YESTERDAY?? Buy FSR Fisker; Analysts saying TEN X is most likely
“Tesla has   “
"I read that Musk's goal is to sell 20M vehicles per year by 2030. That is unlikely since the two biggest makers in the world - Toyota and VW - only sell about 12M/year each. Plus, Tesla would need to build about 10-12 more factories in 9 years. But if he did pull off this feat, and losing $800 per car like he does now, that would be an annual loss of $16 BILLION! Careful what you wish for MuskRat."
Where'd the shorts go?
"Last it acted this way went from $350 to $900, this time?"
"This is the serious key person risk that put me off Tesla. Musk has done incredible things and I hope he continues to, but some of his behaviour is definitely worrying. The fact is he shouldn't need to be playing all these games -something isn't right. I genuinely wish you luck if you hold Tesla, but I'd be taking my profits parking my money somewhere safer -institutions certainly will be soon."

GRWG is easy money. Someone is exiting the trade today. But that stock is like a huge rubber band; it always snaps back hard.
I see Teslas driving around. Where is all this competition I keep hearing about?
How many bitcoins has Tesla accepted for its EV payment so far? It is likely Tesla is going to lose a lot of money this quarter

"This board is so unbelievably saturated with bears... It is kind of wild . What is the cause of this over abundance of hate for this company? The overvalued talk will always be there, as it is in so many other growth stocks. Many people venture their opinions into worlds that they do not understand and that will always be the case. Another main cog in this wheel of bears is a direct result of a 5-6 year sideways stock price movement prior to 2019 that no one takes into account now. Tesla continue to grow and improve, while the stock stayed stagnant due to a large abundance of bears for good reason early on. Ignorant new comers to the stock market and Tesla, fail to realize that is one of the main causes for the massive spike that everyone now looks at like it’s a damned demon from outer space . Now that Tesla has turned their dream into reality and have sold every car that they can possibly manufacture at every step of the way. Keep pushing back on Tesla and trashing their plan, while they continue to set record, after record, after record.  Good Luck to all! It has been a fun ride so far and I have a feeling it has only just begun!"

This was always a shady scamish company. Dumping tons of money into fake coins was probably his last desperate attempt at profitability. I can see the entire company going belly up and Ford or some other connected company taking all of their tech.
This stock is death. No more interest nor demand. Hype is over

As long as interest rates are rising Tesla will be crashing like SpacEx. That’s just the simple fact of the matter.

"$Tsla is already dying in China, people buying the stock are buying a number and hope, never let hope be your friend, sell the dream/lie $Tsla and buy the reality, $NIO, the conquerer of china, soon the dominator of the world and already the leader of inventing a new EV future with high quality, high quality service etc – wannabe Tin can $Tsla has none of this propertys."

"Cramer says buy TSLA before earnings and buy after earnings. I don't know what his problem is, he should know better."
Listen to Cramer. Tesla is gonna get vastly more efficient this year! With two more plants and massively more efficient manufacturing net earnings will sky rocket. Energy credits will just be additional icing on the cake. This stock is a huge value!
"Since TSLA is the poster child of the insane valuations in the last 4 or 5 years, it makes sense that it should be the poster child for the stealth (soon to be not stealth) bear market taking place in tech. Since TSLA is only down 25% from it's highs while many other ridiculously valued tech stocks are now down 50%+, I am expecting TSLA to catch up quickly. Look out below."
"I guess Tesla shareholders are ""testing the liquidity"" of their shares today."
"Let me guess, all the profit is from selling energy credits"
"fake earnings, headed to $500"
Interesting to see ARK dumped a bunch of Tesla today to buy Coinbase. They obviously see a big run coming there in their opinion.
"A big thing to take into consideration when it comes to the recent Tesla crash - is that these vehicles are NOT autonomous. The ""self-driving"" feature is really just a cruise control-type feature. I understand he may have made it seem otherwise, but any adult buying any vehicle should take the responsibility to understand what theyre buying and what the features in the vehicle do. The manual isn't there just for looks. Its clearly stated that the vehicle is not autonomous."
Selling shortly after open and but back in as this is on a downward trend for the past week.
"a lot of ppl will short this in morning, ev car is only $4000 a piece in china"

"As always, never short a stock when you don't know its peak."
"It’s interesting that the SEC gets sideways every time Elon Musk utters anything publicly about TSLA’s future prospects. But the CEOs of the legacies can announce as “news”speculations all the time on many significant prospects for their company. Both. GM and Ford offered specific timelines for introduction of advanced competitive BEV models, (and going all electric by such and such time). They also frequently don’t meet those deadlines. They continuously refer to market share, their thoughts on their future market capitalization and the opening and closing of their plants around the world. The SEC announcing their negative Elon Musk concerns and investigations causes disruption to TSLA stock holders. Far more in share value is lost than any shorter, bull/bear or detractor activity. It shouldn’t matter if the pronouncementsare done on social media or a formal company disclosure to the SEC. Not much equity here."
"Michael Burry bought more than 800,000 Tesla put options contracts in the first quarter worth $534.4 million, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission - CNBC$TSLA"
"So one car crash that it clearly states in the owners manual that the driver needs to be in the seat and ready to take over is going to drop the stock over 2%. Overall, I don't care as I'll sell TSLA in 5 to 10 years, but it's pretty bad the reaction from one car crash that should have never happened in the first place. Lastly, with more Tesla's on the road the fire department shouldn't have to call TSLA and ask how to put out a battery fire. They should know that before it happens."
"Tesla releases statement: ""Autopilot is not at fault. Video says it all. We will leave it at that out of respect to the families."""
Musk accepted Bitcoin for its vehicle when it was low and now sold it at all time high. I’d say that’s a pretty smart business move. Even thou Tsla is over valued.
People have lost interest in Tesla. Too many new EVs out.
great news from china (for short) community are banning tesla car
"The point is Tesla's automotive business remains unprofitable. The profits come purely from speculation and trading in cryptocurrencies and emissions certificates. That is why people see it as ""faked"" profits and Jim Cramer is strongly complaining about."

Just a quick reminder to all holders and longs.You had your fun.It's over.Just sayin...
It’s going back up
"With continued/steady reservation growth, strategic JVs w/ Foxconn/Sharp/Magna, commercial partnerships with ride share, municipalities (https://patch.com/california/manhattanbeach/henrik-fisker-create-police-cruiser-ev-manhattan-beach) etc...the risk of owning FSR or of its demise as a company reduces. Factor in financials, design, pricing, branding/marketing, macro factors, etc....FSR distinguishes itself from other new EV companies. It has a real chance to be the next #TSLA in my opinion."
All puts have been wiped clean.

"Crocs shoot up 17% because of 64% revenue growth. Tesla is down 4% because of 74% revenue growth. No wonder Goldman issued a buy today. Everybody knows today's price weakness is fake and can not last long.oh btw, our solar panel business grew even bigger 163%, and energy storage grew 71%."
"Tesla is a long-term investment. Tesla will still have to prove that it can obtain the market position that Ark investment believes is possible. The problem is that we will see one full economic cycle before it will be clear if Tesla did actually deliver on their promises. A market rotation away from tech stocks has already started. In a world of rising interest rates, inflation and higher taxes, tech stocks will not be in fashion for a while.There is no doubt that the Tesla shares will pull back to a sustainable level soon. I see this as an opportunity to pull out and wait for things to settle before I can get back in on a much lower price per share.I do not want to take the risk to lose 30-50% on my position in the short term. This could happen quite fast. In the beginning you think you can take the risk to wait for a few more days, but all of a sudden you too much under water to give up. The risk is that you run out of options if you just watch the market downturn occur, while hoping that ""your"" stocks will be spared out. I will rather sell and closely monitor for Tesla`s further progress, as well as the market developments. So my shares will hit the market tomorrow, feel free to pick them up."

"--WHY I OWN TESLA-Have you ever wondered why Elon has Space X or Why he is developing Neuralink, FSD, Hyperloops, Solar and Batteries? He is creating his total vision for how we connect, how we store energy, how we get around, how we live. Elon is developing everything necessary to move forward on Planet Earth. Elon's Starlink internet service will span the globe with performance that far exceeds that of traditional satellite internet. Since it's space-based, the Startlink global network will be free of the limitations of ground-based systems, which makes it ideal for Tesla's vehicles capable of autonomous driving. All of this and more is why so many are betting on Tesla and Elon Musk, that simple. Just remember you don't have to like his vision, you don't even have to like him, but the reality is he is building it, and doing so his way and successfully doing it."

"The true value of TSLA, without the hype and the cult-like true believers, is probably somewhere around $60-75. Even that price would be giving it a hefty premium (market cap to sales) over its competition, who are closing fast with plenty of more reliable EVs soon to be on the market."

RCA - UR nothing more that a TWIT Shortie. Go crawl back under the rock you came from... Long term TESLA is a WINNER!!
"Tesla registrations in China rise to a surprisingly record month with nearly 35,000 cars registered in March in the country."
"Service Revenue & Other continues to increase. I find it interesting that the company is now highlighting their 'used vehicle' sales as a good business. This is included in their service revenue. It is cars that are coming back to them for resale, either through returns (which they stopped their 'money back guarantee' in Q1 I believe) and a pretty significant number of barely used cars coming up for sale. I don't follow it closely enough to know whether their 'problem cars' are coming back super quickly, but this was the case in 2018 with all of the manufacturing defects. Perhaps the 10Q will provide more insight, but the company is highlighting this as a 'strong' part of the business, but sooner or later all of those used cars are going to haunt the company. When they start cannibalizing sales of new cars with over priced used cars, they will be skimming the low end . . . All very interesting that mass market psychology hasn't turned on them yet. But when the market can buy one of a half dozen good and new BEVs for under $40k, will they still take a second hand Tesla for $45K?Kind Regards,Guru."
"Lacking conviction, weak in pre-market."
The mullet is a good look.
They had some interesting insights about TSLA on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Bears want to talk numbers? Okay, let's do that:Ford:Total Cash: 31.29BTotal Debt: 153.97BGM:Total Cash: 23.94BTotal Debt: 111.07BTesla:Total Cash: 17.14B (not including bitcoin)Total Debt: 12.51BSee the difference? And legacy will have to spend a fortune to go all EV and try to catch up. Of course, they will spend a fortune on advertising, too. Meanwhile, Tesla is spending money wisely on new state of the art factories and R&D to expand their lead.Tesla is America's best chance at leading, and keeping market share, in the new auto market. Who knows, maybe the government will bail out legacy... again? Government is already helping them with charging stations while Tesla is building their own."
Hope you bought the dip because there is gonna be a big rally soon. The border to us and Canadá will reopen in the summer
"Enron De Musk’s bitcoin dumping have caused many cybertruck orders to be cancelled. Big buyer of EV credits from Europe no longer needs EV credits. Without btc and EV credits, good luck Enron in beating any earnings for 2021."
Stellantis bought $2.4B of EV credits from Tesla between 2019 and 2020. They expect to no longer keep buying them this year. Tesla has only been profitable based on how many EV credits they sell. That $2.4b seems like it’s most of their profit over the past 2 years. Longs should be peeing themselves. Tesla has never made a profit without EV sales hahaha
Big day tomorrow based on delivery beat. $750 is my estimate. Good luck all!
Tomorrow 625
$300 is my target. I remains rock solid on this. Sell before anyone else !! Charts r very bearish !!
Musk has been manipulating the stock for years. He should be investigated.

"Just received an email form Tesla, Subject: Local Availability—Model 3 and Model Y .Tesla still has my email , from when I had a deposit down on a Model 3. So I went to Tesla's webpage, and sure enough, numerous versions of each model available within 200 miles of beautiful Detroit, MI, for immediate delivery. Oddly, not one Model S or X."
Buy the dip
I own Tesla and plan tp buy more shares. I truly believe that by 2025 Tesla will be worth 1500$ share or more........ Im a long term Investor. Ive owned Peg since 1`970 and received a divy for 51 years. Not to bad id say !!!!!!!! Buy Great Companies at a fair price and hold. You;ll be richly Rewarded !!!!!!! $$$$
"This overvalued fraud will end soon.The postponement of a new model s obviously investors do not care about.The Ponzi system will burst soon, and the stock will fall MASSIVLY.Ridicolous +2% in comparison to last quarter and nobody cares about it.Use this peak, it will end in a drama for many small investors.Buy instead quantumscape,,.this company will disrupt Teslas battery technique and has much more potential.Mark this post."
"$WIMI $TSLA $NIO The fun has only just begun, which is why the stock is extremely undervalued and has a lot of upside to go."
"The threat here is that in a multi-vehicle accident the Tesla can burn for 4 hours while 32,000 gallons of water are used. ... the whole car pile-ups drivers and passengers could be burned to death, This is very serious and probably the biggest scandal to hit Tesla. ... this isn't a bear criticism but a reality for Tesla's battery construction which now need to change for better. The first step has yet to even happen re: an admission by Tesla that the cars batteries are dangerous. This is going to be long and drawn out, I also expect Teslas claims of FSD and Autopilot are misleading and may in itself lead to a class action lawsuit adjacent Teslas claims versus the now unfolding reality."
Short Squeeze? Which Short Squeeze ...? According to the information I have the number of stock shorts has dropped significantly and most shorts are out. So the drop in Tesla was caused by majority of Longs going out as the market begins to realize that the valuation is not justified. Those will not come back at this level just because of some modest positive news about deliveries and the ever optimists run out of money or cannot risk a portfolio just consisting of Tesla. Like Arkk. Any increase on Monday below 10% will just be a normal hiccup and below 5% or even a drop will just accelerate decline. And I wonder what is the point that more cars were delivered than produced? Competition will continue to impact Tesla. They only have 2-3 models to chose from. That already limits market outreach. People noy buying e-cars have a much broader choice to suit their real needs. The former monopoly is about to stop and so will Tesla's future growth potential never justify its valuation.
"Depending on what happens today, we may be at the verge of an important support level that will initiate the next leg down towards 388-410 and find some support there. Dangerous game now for longs and at some extent for shorts."
"Yes - let's spend billions to build our EV infrastructure. But, why overlook the low hanging fruit which can make our planet safer - banning crypto.A single bitcoin has a carbon footprint of 270 tons, the equivalent of 60 ICE cars.$SPY $TSLA $RIDE $NIO $FSR $TSP"
I expect TSLA to fall 40% tomorrow. Question is - will this be a buying opportunity - or the comedown of TSLA to rational levels?
"Shareholders need to make a choice. Sell or go down with Cathie Wood on her Ark. Buy Ford. If you have any doubts, check out the chart. Something you probably haven't done with this one."

Most sought technology achievement is self driving. Now the battery technology is almost matured. You can drive a car upto 40O miles with one charge. This is almost enough. Self Driving is something unique and needed. Anyone who excel that technology will almost own the entire automobile market. It is as simple as that. Many expect Tesla to be early inventor of FSD. Thats what the market expects and value this company at this level.

"The miles-driven comparison of ""Tesla with autopilot is 10x safer than the average car"" narrative is a joke that completely ignores the fact that autopilot is only used in conditions which are less likely to have an accident, i.e. highway cruise. If you are going to cite ""facts"" at least try to take the blinders off. Elon knows his fanbois will just mindlessly pump any news that sounds good."
Looks Elon got played by Chinese government very badly. Of course they will support their local companies and try to get rid of you and sell your establishment to local companies at pennies for a dollar. Good Luck TESLA. It’s going down.

Good day 
It has supports at 658 and 654. 4hr and daily chart is uptrend. Hopefully it would keep uptrend momentum to run 750+ next week with delivery news. Maybe today could be a profit taking for end of week for swing traders.

"Competition will soon kill Tesla; I just looked at the Mercedes EQS - Tesla models look like being designed from yesterday. And they have EQA, EQB, EQC as models to chose from. That's only Daimler. PayPal, SpaceX - all unique, a somewhat disruptive innovation like Tesla seemed 3 year ago. All those legacy car makers have decades of design, production, market experience and if they get the new e-motors right then there is no reason why to buy a Tesla. Elon is a genius, but not omniscient and obviously underestimated the speed by which all the others catch up and now they begin to pass by. Gruenheide delay just adds to the problem. And not to forget the schizophrenia to invest in Bitcoin but claiming to be soooo much sensitive for environment. This kind of messing around with consumers and environment alone would never make me buy a Tesla and I assume most people with some sense for moral follow this logic. Tesla recives poor press because of water supply and environmental damage casued in Germany and the green party is most likely to be elected in Sept. Irrespective where I look dark clouds and trouble."
OMG I was almost a bagholder.
How many cars this quarter?
If you don’t own TSLA now would be a good time to buy.
Ever wonder why only 2% of all new cars sold in US are EVs? It’s because 98% of buyers don’t want a frequing TESLA! People are waiting for a better more reliable EV with a real service network to come on the market!
Tesla Sales in Japan in March Increased 13 Times Over Same Period Last Year.

Look at TSLA burn :))) had to play opposite this week and the next boys sorry

"Does anyone have a sense when the meme crowd will come back and bring in a few more billion to push this up again?I fear for the longs who believe the company can return enough value to shareholders to justify a $600 billion valuation. Normally for companies with 5-10% operating margins, that would require about $60 billion in earnings, not just $60 billion in sales.The dream can live far longer than the realities, so I don't want to presume that the company won't return to $700 or $800, but the BEV market is normalizing very quickly and Tesla is losing their lead.[BTW, did anyone notice the GM Cruise is bringing a L5 autonomous vehicle to market in about 18 months?] Meanwhile Tesla is likely to undergo some regulatory scrutiny regarding their lack of driver monitoring systems (i.e. a camera) and their claims of autonomous driving capability. Of course the feckless authorities may let it all slide further.In any case, someone is selling and it is now looking more significant than the overall market.Guru."
"Bought right before close I have $50,000 on the line that this thing goes up tomorrow"
"OK, let's give TSLA a hefty premium to those other stodgy auto companies (that are just now gearing up their EVs); let's assume they're much more than simply a car manufacturer; let's ignore the oncoming EV competition from companies that spend way more on R+D; and let's assume sales grow robustly this year. Giving a valuation of 2 times sales (GM is 0.7) that equates to a share price of about $75.00. I don't see how Cathie Wood predicts $3000/share (albeit in 5 years)....but it's typical of those who have been right for awhile not to want to change their opinions."
"Short seller's are panicking as you can see by there comments. They know Cathie Woods ARK bought millions worth of COIN for average price $366, Yesterday and last night. Who would you listen to, the short seller negative comments here or a fund manager worth billions. NUF said. LONG COIN Like this better than $TSLA $GME $PLTR $SNDL today.

He or she skedaddle out of there or climbed into the back seat to try to escape the flames. Normal folk are just to enamoured by the fact that it was a Tesla and fail to look at it without out all the media spin on it. This type of thing happens alot actually. Driver of a crash leaves the scene sometimes not even realizing that they were in a wreck. Dont believe me, take a trip to good old google and it's all right there if you are willing to look.

As soon as GM, Ford, Toyota, Honda go thru the growing pains that Tesla has already mastered... they'll all lose market share but Tesla. ask Hyundai about recalling all their EV's over battery fire dangers. oh yeah, did anyone realize the Tesla energy will be bigger than car sales.

"The reason the shares are dropping is probably because Tesla engineers have clearly stated that FSD is not realistic even this year, and the CEO has said that it will be out in a few weeks for the past three years. This is a huge regulatory and credibility problem.Then he said that dogecoins were a hustle and he has been supporting that coin (ahem . . . hustle), and now people are more aware than ever that Tesla and it's myriad broken promises may also be a hustle.Can't say why others sell, but I certainly don't want to be invested in a business where the CEO and/or board members are involved in ANY hustle.Guru."

Tesla sold Bitcoin to enlarge revenue https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1386821144037236737?s=21
This will go to 800 on this run. It has been waiting for this
"Here's the thing: Tesla already went to the moon. It already happened. The valuation is sky-high, and every bit of possible good news over the next 10 years, including FSD rollout, growth of vehicle sales, and eventual profitability of the energy business, all has already been baked into the current price. So.... no surprise it's difficult for the stock to climb higher for any reason other than pure emotion, and the hype is beginning to wear off. Tesla fanboys are wildly overestimating the utility of FSD and wildly underestimating the time (many years) required for regulatory approvals, infrastructure improvements needed before full deployment, and there will be an abundance of time for competitors (many of whom may already have a significant lead on Tesla) to step in and force FSD prices lower, which will crush margins on this business. Do not put your trust in the analysts. Sell-side analysts will always give you wildly high targets while raking in commission fees on selling the stock. Wake up, folks. Same stuff happens every bubble. As for the Tesla insurance business, if you want to see this shredded to pieces, simply look at Chris Bloomstran’s arguments regarding Tesla’s capital constraints for insurance --- I’ve never seen a more complete public humiliation of an analyst report, and it proves ARK’s (yes, Cathie Wood’s) lack of understanding on this business. The upcoming earnings call will be full of more false promises and more excuses on repeatedly failed timelines on FSD. Musk will probably blame the regulators again... because it's much easier to blame someone else than admit failure on his promises to customers and shareholders. Young investors seem to have no clue the impact higher interest rates will have on speculative growth stocks like TSLA. Guys, seriously, it completely changes the game. Interest rates are like gravity, and TSLA will crash harder than anything, as if it needed another reason to, beyond sheer overvaluation. A stock rally based on emotion and excitement always runs out of fuel eventually. I've seen it a thousand times. It doesn't even require any bad news, just a lack of good news to dull the excitement, and then the number of sellers begins to slowly overpower the buyers. Good luck and be safe."
Sorry guys I sold all my shares today. I don't want to hold anymore after multiple manipulation of stock and crypto markets by this man.
95 percent revenue from car sales. I’m sorry I thought Tesla was so much more 
The amount of FUD is hilariously high today.
I thought your hands had to be on the wheel for autopilot to engage?
Wasn't this going over 900 today? Longs acting like everything is ok. You guys are sad.
FSD = full self delusion is a gimmick. Waste of money. LoL

"Never in a million years did this over 50, Chevy Suburban, Dodge Challenger, old school Chevy Nova lover ever think he'd own an EV. After the last 9 months of enduring power shutoff from our electric company every time the wind blows I'd had it, and did research on batteries for the home. Tesla wins that category hands down, but then I thought about filling them up in extended outages (we've had many), so I went searching for panels...Tesla wins again against Costco and all others (price, look, performance). cool.Now I'm making all of this juice and I see where gas prices are headed...bought a Tesla Y. (that blows the doors off of almost anything at a red light). This set up makes financial sense. It's also fun as hell.It took 4 months because of how busy they are.Feels good knowing I'm not feeding a terrorist with my oil money. Think about my story, look around you and see how many cars aren't EV, and how many home don't have batteries and solar.btw, home battery is like a bucket for the solar panels so you can use the juice whenever you want.Tesla is doing it right, and they have tremendous unrealized potential, imho"

2018 96% of all EVs sold in Europe were NOT Teslas. 2019 83% of all EVs sold in Europe were NOT Teslas. 2020 96% of all EVs sold in Europe were NOT Teslas. Hmmm ... kind of looks like some EV fans are not that impressed with Tesla products. There were thousands and thousands of Teslas on the roads in Europe last year. The word is out and Tesla is a pure EV brand. And still EV buyers in Europe are choosing other brands. BTW you can expect to see the same thing happen in China. The Model 3 is still new there but new doesn't last forever.

Im looking at weekly options for end of day... any tips
"AS a car company. tesla made a loss in Q1. Bitcoins is what gave it a profit. Analysis shows it probably lost $87M in the EV sector. Bitcoins bailed them out. Elon made a killing in profit, personal and for Tesla. Bought Bit coins low, then bought with Tesla funds and raised the price. Business sense ? EV not good, Playing with Shareholders' money. Want to see the EV sector make money on its OWN. AM I right in this view point? Someone please tell me I am wrong. My faith in the operations and company is slipping. The stock is down to 695 .....After such a good quarter ?"
Weird that some investor don’t know how to read earning report lol

It may stabilize at 408-420 before it tests new lows.We may see a trading halt due to the huge volume of shares to be sold . 100 billion will be erased in 2 trading sessions.
ELON ..what about the massive pollution you produce with those rockets !!can you reply please?
"Lol, media lying again about Tesla crash. When will you shorts learn that everything is recorded on Teslas. You can’t cheat data"
Really low profit margin business. $10.4B revenue but lost $25M on EV's. Only sale of bitcoins and sale of emission credits gave a profit...lol
TSLA made $1 billion in Q1 on bitcoin speculation and $0 on everything else. Did I get that right?
Bottom Line. 700 is simply a joke. You can't price a stock based on 5 to 10 years later projections. And that is assuming everything transpires perfectly with little competition.
"Here's a revised version of why Tesla will be the biggest company in the world?- Tesla is 12 startup companies in one- On energy front, Tesla will be addressing a market that is owned by top 7 out of 10 largest company in the world in term of market CAP.

"Oh, I didn't know that:Tesla is also facing regulatory hurdles in Germany, where the opening of its plant slipped to at least until the end of the year. The filing states that German authorities have fined Tesla 12 million euros ($14.5 million). That notice alleges that the company failed to make public ""notifications and take-back obligations with respect to end-of-life battery products."""
TSLA’s Berlin experience won’t end well for TSLA shareholders
"I had a 1,000 shares pre split that turned into 5,000 shares. I’m still holding 4,050 shares no way do I sell till 2025. I can’t wait for Monday !"
To all our fallen Tezombies
Shorts desperate to get this meaningfully below the 50 DMA and they failed. Will be a lot of covering at open tomorrow.
$800 before end of the week.
ark fund is collapsing
Me coming for the shorts after earnings
The FSD subscription base revenue will dwarf revenue from EV credits..the true nature of Tesla will be revealed. A software subscription business.
will be a big move up next week with earnings the following monday. Not hard to see that.
BIG day ahead! Can't wait for earnings this month! gonna sky rocket!
500 by next week!
Why did EM delete his tweet about TSLA having a >0 likelihood of becoming the most valuable company in a matter of weeks?
I sold all my Tesla shares earlier this year I wish this thing goes down to a dollar.
#TTCF is a strong buy right now
Lets go 1000 > 2000 > 3000
"If we can see a sharp fall today, then hopefully we see TSLA fall below $500 in the coming days. That would be the initial correction before we see the prolonged decline towards the $300 range. Good luck bag holders, hopefully you realize that you should sell before you lose all of your profits and start incurring more losses because you're high on Musk Branded Hopium."
Tesla finally has some good news and the stock stalls all week......big boys playing for keeps all across the market media to
The market is in bear territory..Even one or two sessions in green will not prevent a new low.
"What a mess.no bitcoin,no tax credits and cars that are not profitable.no r and d must focus on making a new line of profitable automobiles"
Fan Girls ....Elon just throw Bitcoin under the BUS....Because he just learned of the energy requirements??? My 25 year old son new this 3 years ago!
bashers are happy today but this is a basic sell the news move. people selling today bought in the $600s.
Before it is over Musk will be jumping out the air lock on one of those space ships.
"TSLA up in frankfurt 2,3%"
Elon Musk is about to announce the crypto currency he creates: Dogeatdogcoin or Dog1dog Coin.
HELP ME SHORT! I NEED $500 SHARE
who believes there's going to be a massive TSLA rally here?... why would there be? buying opportunity? $500B valuation on no profits? their cars keep smashing into things... seriously? there's no robo taxis coming to save the day. this story is dead.
CNBC says TSLA handily beat expectations in both revenue And earnings.
Amazing how easy it is to get the herd riled up.... Simple creatures we are... 
"If I donate my Tesla to Kars4Kids, can I deduct 3X the MRSP on my taxes?"
I told you. Now we will never see the 600s again.
745 today mark it.
Can we close $800?
"So, fElon did not sell his personal bitcoinsThe question is: did fElon buy his bitcoin before he announced that the company invested in bitcoin?That's a question for the SEC"
Back to $800 tomorrow 
"Since it is relationship with dogecoin, this stock is over."
$900 before earning after earning over $1000
the next support level after 563 is 403... this is just the beginnibg of putting this overrated stock back to reality
Hold on Tesla! Whole market down! Let's close positive!!
$800 soon
"From where this money comes and PUMPS the US Stock prices every single day, Despite ABSURD Valuations, Collapsing Economy, Tanking Corporate revenues, intense international competition, Record Stock dilutions, Astronomical record Debt.$AAPL $AMZN $JPM $TSLA"
I thought this is going to bein RED Zone today.
"WELL.... apparently the German Government is deliberately acting against TESLA... to prevent it from opening and manufacturing both batteries and cars for the SOLE reason of PROTECTING the Ford, General Motors, Volkswagen, Audi, and others, that have been there for decades !!!The Germans have been at the top of the list for Environmentalism..... EXCEPT when it comes in allowing a Company to leapfrog over ALL of the other calcitrant automobile manufacturer's in THEIR Country.Can You believe THIS ?????Quote:Hibernating snakes are complicating Elon Musk's plans for a gigafactory near Berlin.A German court has told the U.S. billionaire's electric vehicle company Tesla (TSLA.O) to suspend clearing of a forest at the site of the proposed factory after environmentalists said that cutting down more trees could endanger hibernating snakes.""The Landesumweltamt (state environmental authority) and Tesla will now be consulted, they need to make submissions by this afternoon and then we assess the situation,"" a spokesman for the administrative court in Frankfurt an der Oder in eastern Germany said on Tuesday.Tesla declined to comment. The Landesumweltamt declined to comment further."""
"no driver, no autopilot, but the car ran and burnt. need 230 IQ to solve this."
Many of us here know about TSLA!Shall we see TSLA join Trillion $ Club after the ER on coming Monday!
Bought more puts
"This stock needs to find a much more decent and “rational” level. Competition in EV’s is piling up like you have no idea how fast. Tesla is a great brand, but Tesla in NOT a miracle product. PE of around 550 is insane. I won’t bet on a future that is so clouded with competition."
"The great things about EVs is that they seem to promise much higher revenues and earnings for auto companies that produce them - quite amazing. Maybe we all now buy at least two cars each and pay twice the price for them...of course all of them will be EVs, too."
Cathie sold
11k cars not registered in this report due to no need. Bitcoin profit will add 736m to bottom line. They bought 1.5b bitcoin sub 40k. It's now nearly 60k. 50% uptick is 739m of pure profits on top of all other sales. I'm expecting this to hit 1200 by June.
Another Tesla EV in autopilot mode just crashed into the police patrol car today. Tesla should advise drivers stopping using the autopilot now
It's Tesla's fault when nobody is in the driver's seat? Just bears trying to spread FUD. It will blow over and they'll jump onto something else or just make something up. Gets old and predictable after a while.
How many CyberTrucks did you Pre-Order? And which configurations did you order? What is a good name for RoboTaxi Business?
"I want to be bullish on Tesla I own the stock, there are analysts who are bullish. However, Elon Musk does not seem to be focused on the operation aspect of the business; instead, he is too busy tweeting about bitcoin. Every stock is up exponentially but Tesla seems to be lagging the general market performance."
Monday open over 700 ??
"Gamers have already been suffering for months now as a lot still struggle to get their hands on the next generation console. While the PS5 restock and the Xbox Series X restock are supposed to compete like they always do, it seems like things have totally changed and neither is able to supply the demand for their consoles. I have found this site helpful when trading stocks like TSLA . https://daytradingsquad.team/Real-Time-Trade-Alerts"
Someone forgot to do research on India. Average family makes $2k and there is no middle class… lol Who are you selling these $40k cars to?… 
"Longs are you starting to understand? Tesla is enormously overvalued. Tesla is truly a struggling car maker. The Model S is doing well but the Model 3 is fading. When have refreshed models done well? never. Berlin is postponed to at least 2022. Tesla will not build a million cars this year. Good luck with the Cyber truck, might well well for a year."
I hope those big shorts here win big enough to knock Elon out of the top 5
Tesla can only make money from selling regulatory credits and Bitcoin. Overvalued.
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
Just closed my short position and holding my long from yesterday
lower lows each day....going to continue
It’s funny how the news would make a huge fuss over a TSLA crash but ignore all other car crashes in this world that have killed tens of thousands more individuals. Simply wow.
"In Dearborn yesterday, The President mentioned additional incentives to help EV adaptation, especially those built in North America. But before you sycophants start humping Elon's leg, he also said, those built by UNION labor."
This editor last release saw some amazing results... Thank me later:) https://b.link/saas-innovator-s-capitalizing-on-the-lucrative-human-capital-trends-of-2021
China new order number crashing due to fear of random brake failures. The real problem is that Tesla pretends there's no problem at all.
"Tesla computer: ""Is that a tree up ahead or a stop sign? Oh what the heII, let's drive on."""
Seeing some mid caps who are down 65% bottomToday. Would be very fitting to see smaller growth caps bottom here as overvalued big megacaps unwind the froth. I see zero zero zero froth in small mid and spac markets. $aapl $msft $plug $be $nndm $ddd $nflx $clsk- if your stock hasnt crashed yet or done time lower much lower like these smalls or $tsla u should be nervous
"Fat Shady bagged another $32B in. stonk options from you baggies. Turdsla lost $267 M last quarters sans bitcoin & zev credits, yet fElon collects $32 Billion in options. You Muskatards deserve to get Musk’d."
Shorts! Tesla will succeed because of Write's law. While other auto makers are literally starting from 0 to make EV's. Keep shorting. I can't wait to spend your hard earned money! Thanks in advance. Signed Beercan
Congratulations to the dip buyers and holders. Things are looking up at last!
"Musk has a serious PR issue, here and abroad. Time for damage control. Unfortunately, Musk is the PR Dept."
I cant wait for the ramp up in production and new models coming out with giga Texas and Berlin maybe we can stop hearing the noise on regulatory credits. By then Tesla won't need them. Right now it's just a tool as bitcoin to get them to sustainability and major profitability
"We all know that EV's like Tesla are the future for transportation. The components that are required to make the ION batteries, like soda ash, are what I have also been investing in. Genesis Energy (GEL) operates the world's largest natural soda ash mine and production site in Wyoming. Natural soda ash is cheaper and more environmentally friendly than synthetic soda ash. I'm sure there are other companies in the soda ash business segment out there to check out. Lithium (LAC) looks like it's getting some interest. I'm not in that one yet. Any other interesting related stocks out there?"
Dead cat bounce turning into death spasms.
"Musk is complaining that the SEC isn't being harsher on SPACs, which could threaten Tesla. What a Pushy Ash Beach."
"IEA report forecasts a 2.6% rise in global coal demand in 2021, driven by higher electricity demand and industrial output in China. Keep building those EVs in Shanghai, Elon. You saving the world is progressing nicely."
I'm telling you guys tesla image is damaged. this is gonna get worst. tesla got to where they are without advertising and word of mouth. I'm gonna bad mouth tesla cars for the rest of my life. and so will million others
There are interns at Tesla smarter than michale burry.
"Howie ~ ""BUT BUT BUT....TSLA is more....it is a battery company, it is an autonomous vehicle company, it is a software company and it is trying to become a utility company. So many will argue it is 5 companies in 1! I think this explanation is a stretch, but it is what Kathy Wood believes.""Let's assume tesla eventually does these things, although it won't. If you added up all of the market caps of the companies who already do these things at a profit, it would be a fraction of tesla's current market cap. So either tesla's market cap is overpriced by about 10 fold, or these other companies' market caps are undervalued by 10 fold.I'm pretty sure it's the former. And tesla is not profitable.And irregardless (yes that is an italianmob word) of the platitude on ""capex spending causing no profits"", some cult member will chime in with,.... A. tesla doesn't use profits to fund capex,...that's not how GAAP accounting works (if it wanted to pay for it with cash is would be taken from retained earnings,.. but tesla has about $6 billion in accumulated losses in retained earnings,... again balance sheet entries),... but B. tesla doesn't need to, it just raised (added to the balance sheet) about $21 billion it could use for capex (it's a deduct from cash and a credit to PPE on the balance sheet, again it has nothing to do with the income statement).And when these plants are complete, they too will operate at a fraction of claimed production capacity because the demand just isn't there and they will not earn a profit.In fact these new plants will take production away from existing plants.Anybody seen the movie ""The Accountant""?Great movie."
$TSLA < $TTM so that you know. Indian company that owns landrover and jaguar sells more cars and makes more profit by actually selling CARS !!! Comparison with Ford and GM is out of question!!
Sell-off during an earning's 'beat' announcement? Thank you for the discount ladies! #MoreForMe
"This robot-run fund loaded up on Tesla because it thinks the stock will soar. It’s been right before.Published: May 17, 2021 at 12:05 a.m. ET"
THIS is SCAM COMPANY. REPORTING PROFIT FROM TRADING CRYPTO INSTEAD OF REAL BUSINESS. Going to tank HARD.
"sell $TSLA, and buy $GME today."
So market cap of $789 Billion.. divided by $738 a share you get about 980 million shares.. they made $101 million off bitcoin.. so .102 of their EPS is off Bitcoin bubble buying? Seems like that is repeatable... HAHAHAHA
never selling my tesla 
In two weeks this will be a 1000$
It's irrelevant to ask how much have you lost here. The right question is how much will you lose.

NIO sales beats Tesla in China...
Holding since December! Selling this #$%$ now!
"I said on Sunday this was set to squeeze higher towards $800. It’s done just that. With today’s close above $750, it’s absolutely feasible that $1000 is in play in the near term."
Elon: ceo of crypto not Tesla. He shouldnt be ceo at Tesla cuz he’s at the wrong place
"In China Tesla is being outsold by a tiny $5,000 EV made by GM. In fact the little EV is the best selling EV in the world despite the fact that GM only sells it in China.Reality: September 2020 ===> Tesla Model 3 not the best selling EV in China October 2020 ===> Tesla Model 3 not the best selling EV in China November 2020 ===> Tesla Model 3 not the best selling EV in ChinaDecember 2020 ===> Tesla Model 3 not the best selling EV in ChinaJanuary 2020 ===> Tesla Model 3 is still not the best selling EV in ChinaFebruary 2020 ===> Tesla Model 3 not the best selling EV in China"

"a market cap of 721B+; this is sheer ridiculous, it seems. looks like better odds on the Dont pass line. still, would love to see this pioneer of a vehicle company make it and bring on more of their incredible products. I believe they are building in the Austin/Tx area. TX's gain is I suppose another loss or failure for states up north!"
"The ""bounce"" back gets smaller every time. Just like Elon's ""coolness"" factor"
NEVER SELL TESLA!!
"Just listened to a long podcast (Netflix) featuring Bill Nye. Obviously a strong proponent of EVs. His rational for electric vehicles was very propelling, and pushed me over the apex of acceptance. Perhaps not for every application, but definitely for the vast majority of transportation requirements."
"Pull up the YTD chart of TSLA. Now realize that it's most likely going to about $400, this stock isn't going to change direction on all the bad news ... that's still coming. downgrade from BoA by 28% from $900 to $700, it's the % down that counts not the $700 level."
People who think this company should be worth more then $700Billion because of this earnings are clueless lol
tsla is getting ready to fly.
I guarantee TSLA was a topic of discussion at the dinner table this holiday weekend. Buy buy buy.
There was literally very less to no production for Model X. It will sure be a miss. Stay cautious and do your ddl
The one thing that is not going to be delayed is Felon charging subscription fees for the non-existing Partial-Full Self Driving vaporware.

"For those with high expectation of the future of TSLA based on the semi business might note that the president of Heavy Trucks (James Guillien) sold just a little under 12k shares in the first part of March. If great progress is being made, wouldn't you expect him to hold onto shares?"
I think it was buy the dip again. Much fresh money going into the markets. Up we go.

"No robotic taxis, no useful FSD, no growth except building more factories surrounded by heavy competition. Solar roof story to the rescue.

Tesla production is 180000 cars per quarter or 0.9%. Even after Berlin and Taxes factories it will be less than 2% compared to Toyota 12% now and now go and compare market cap.

"I think that shorts will be in a difficult situation come Monday, especially considering the blowout sales news Tesla just posted. Longs have 3 whole days to line up every dollar they can get and tell all their friends about this blowout quarter.All their money and all their friends' money will be piling into TSLA first thing on Monday.NIO did great too, so this is not a one-time pop for just TSLA. This is the future. The whole sector is gonna roar.

This bubble will never pop
The article on Yahoo regarding to VinFast cars is buffed by Viet Cong (communist). They cannot make their own cars. The car is made by BMW not from Vinfast. I don’t trust anything builded in China and Vietnam. They cannot build a quality bicycle. How can they build an EV? They may steal the high tech from U.S or EU.

dead cat bounce corporate leverage in the USA is double what it was in 2008 inflation will rip fed either has to let inflation rip or increase interest rates can't have both.

"imagine in a day where all the stocks are +12%, this one is about to go red. Cannot get happier"
"No AH bounce, again..."
Do any of you shorts have seven figures worth of stock? We longs do. Looking forward to eight figures in a couple of years.
The only dip I’m buying is onion chive.
"Anyone that say that it will go down at the open most likely wanted to buy the stock at dip. Lol. This will be the $tsla of imaging. Increase of 70 percent is small compared to what it will be 10 years from now. Keep it for long like Tesla. If you would keep Tesla since IPO, you would have return of 20000% return in 10 years. 10k investment will be 2 millions in less than 10 years. Rocket emoji for Richard since he likes it"
have a great weekend everyone 
"The path to $1,071 - Tesla is underappreciatedDorsheimer more than doubled his price target for Tesla, increasing it from $419 to $1,071. In addition, the analyst changed his rating on the stock from hold to buy.While Tesla makes most of its revenue from electric cars, the analyst's upgrade for the stock today has a lot to do with his bullish view for the company's solar and energy storage business. He believes Tesla's energy generation and storage business could rake in $8 billion of revenue annually by 2025 thanks to an ""Apple-esque ecosystem of energy products"" and ""harmonized electrification."" Dorsheimer thinks that as Tesla resolves the battery cell supply shortage it said it was facing in its most recent quarterly update, the company is well positioned to grow the business through sales of its energy storage products. He also believes Tesla is several years ahead of the competition in energy storage, giving it an edge. Momentum in energyThough Tesla's electric-car business gets more attention than its energy storage business since that's where the bulk of the company's sales come from, energy storage deployments actually grew faster in 2020 than electric-car sales. Total energy storage deployments, measured in gigawatt hours (GWh), increased 83% year over year to 3 GWh in 2020.""This growth was driven mainly by the popularity of Megapack, our utility scale storage product,"" Tesla told investors in its fourth-quarter update. ""Powerwall demand continues to increase as the residential business continues to grow.""Impressively, this growth came even as production was limited. ""Our energy storage business continues to be supply constrained as backlog remains strong,"" Tesla said. But its efforts to increase cell production will help the company ramp up supply ""in the next few months."" Because of this, the automaker anticipates its energy storage business will grow at approximately the same rate in 2021 as it did in 2020.Tesla's solar business is growing slower, with megawatts of solar deployments increasing 18% in 2020 from the prior year. But this segment saw accelerated growth in the fourth quarter, when deployments grew 59% year over year.While investors should be sure to do their own due diligence on Tesla stock, Dorsheimer does highlight an often-underappreciated aspect of the business that could become a significant contributor to Tesla's bottom line."
So many catalysts ahead. 4680 Batteries scaling. Model 2 production. Two new factories coming on line. FSD! They don't need all of these to become the biggest company in the world. Battery production alone could get them there. How can the shorts not see this?
"There is an interesting macro picture here. Tesla is by far the most scale-efficient EV maker and they have the most robust battery supply chain. Yet, they are barely profitable. This likely means that no one else is remotely profitable in the EV space. However, governments are mandating the marketshare growth for EVs to go from ~4% currently to ~100% by 2030-2040. What is going to give?"
"TSLA is rapidly losing early 1st mover lead. It’s now clear that a multitude of superior BEVs are hitting the market.TSLA’s days as market leader in the BEV sector are rapidly winding down, get used to it."
"What happen to the analyst that changed his target delivery from 180,000 to 160,000+ and downgraded Tesla from$775 to $700? I am sure he realized he made a mistakes, This is what differentiate a top analyst such as Dan Ives of Wedbush who is right on target from amateur analyst."

People who panic sold yesterday
1200 tomorrow
He tANKed BITCOIN
NO worries! Was till earnings! Skyrocketing!
Guys Tesla dropping today had nothing to do with the crash. It’s a growth stock flush today. Gear up for earnings next week. It’s going to $800
"$750 by end of week, over $800 after earnings next weekwatch the ill timed shorts BURN!"
"Shorts here need to realise Tesla is not Bitcoin, they had a market before buying into bitcoin and they will have a market long after bitcoin. Tesla are clearly the ford of electric vehicles and Mr Musk has been quiet lately, the cheeky chap he is.....he usually goes quiet before releasing something big. I think it wont be long before they push the market for their commercial units and potentially in the future, the first electric planes."
"The TESLA bulls are bored... 20,000 more cars in 3 months couldn't convince them either.In volumes a car manufacturer in the third league. As far as profits are concerned, it's still in the district class. How long is it going to take before profits are made?"
Going green...Powell confirmed the market will boom now
Today's move is not that impressive. Longs need to get worried. Final hour slide is not a good sign and it shows that there is no conviction in buyers. Let us see what happens tomorrow.
"close price will be $850,"
"750 eod, 800 tomorrow. 900 end of week. TSLA is money printing machine!"
"Scottish investment banker/fund manager, Baillie Gifford, has reduced its outsized TSLA shareholdings by 40% so far this year, profit taking continues. Bailie Gifford had been a very early TSLA investor. The investment banker’s bout of “profit taking” may have become the COUP DE GRACE for TSLA’s spectacular run the last couple of years. PROFIT TAKING may have become the order of the day"
For a bright guy Musk sure didn't think things through when purchasing Bitcoin; first he's using bitcoin now he's not because it's consuming too much energy.You should have thought of that before Musky.
"Screw Elon musk. He only cares about himself. Considering GM, Ford, and Tesla. Comparing their production and how many cars sold, Tesla stock should be around $20. Putting Elon musk at $2b total net worth. He still owes the Chinese gov over $5 billion for his Shanghai factory that is due next year. If Tesla stock drops by then, Elon musk will have to declare bankruptcy on his $50 billion + in loans that he owes on factories and other parts and services. Narcissistic billionaire. He will fall flat on his face in the next coming years. He's been involved in hundreds of projects. 3 of them have been successful so far. The only 297 have all failed."
"Double charging customers:When he checked his account the next morning, on March 25, Tom Slattery, woke up to find his bank account depleted by nearly $53,000 more than he expected — the sum he agreed to pay for a long-range, all-wheel-drive, 2021 Tesla Model Y. It would be a second Tesla for his family.Slattery says he immediately spotted the duplicate and jumped to call and text Tesla. He spent the day getting stonewalled, people either did not pick up the phone or did not have definitive answers about a refund."
Question??????Why sp ups always frome upgrade rather than good earnings?
Nothing worse than seeing half of yesterday’s gains wiped out.
today is one of this days when you just watch money evaporate
"Elon the king of social media,how much shareholder money have you lost in bitcoin so far lets see some numbers ..................."
"Personally, I wouldn't go long or short here. I'm bearish long term for the company as it's simply overvalued and they will not increase revenue or earnings enough to deserve the valuation and the hype is wearing off. Short term however, it could fail at the 50 day around 710 dollars and move down or break out and head back towards 900 dollar high.I'm a neutral bear correctly."
another BIG day ahead! Wait till earnings are released! Going back to $900
tesla short shorted 534 million
"SO MANY SHORTS WERE SAYING TSLA TO $400, now some shorts have upgraded their fantasy sell price to $600 lol. I guess they loss hope as well as their money! "
Tesla in 6 months
Tesla will keep going
"It broke the devil number, next test is the 563 area where it was on March 7th"
"It looks like the Tesla balloon is popping with market analyst these past few years downgrading then pumping this stock where $3000 was one analyst prediction only several months ago which rocketed the stock from $340 to $880 and now the dumping continues for this grossly overrated stock, which appears to be heading back to the $400 level and repeat the process again ... what do longs on the board value this stock to be short term 6 months and long term 12 months ... any thoughts?"
"Haven’t sold a single share and I don’t plan to!!!! We’ve came to far to let these shorties win , it ain’t gonna happen "
TSLA will be $800 this Friday! Great price before smashing earnings report on April 26!!!!
Who bought at 596?
"I am buying and accumulating on AAPL, BAP, and AMZN. Also , dogecoin as well"
"Tesla produced in q1 2021 0.3% more cars than in q4 2020. It seem that till opening Texas or Berlin giga factories there will not be anymore growth in production. The only issue now is Tesla's profitability. Will they make money from cars or not? The fairy tales about FSD, Robotic taxis, insurance so far still a fairy tales. Does anybody needs FSD?"
Beautiful Mach-E sill eat into Tesla's lunch.Tesla is not apple.. 30% market share VS 1%...
"Now if I get the Tesla roof, I have to get the Powerwall that I don't even need/want. I'm already financially stretched on getting the roof, so that makes it an easy decision. This technology isn't for a middle class poors like myself."

"Keep an eye on Ford sales and watch how their EV sales grow and steal market share from TESLA. In less than 2 years, Ford will surpass TESLA by 2x or more EV sales."

"Look at the P/E ratio of SQ,... then look at all the branches of the Tesla tree,... Solar Roof, Batteries, EV's, Tech,... giga's popping up all over the globe. Where will Tesla be in 10 years? STILL far ahead of the rest of the pack. Is Ford manufacturing solar roof shingles? Is GM perfecting battery storage? Is Toyota focusing on the best self driving AI on the planet? NO. Who is? Tesla! Who's cars will be off making you money while you sleep, or are at work? Tesla! Who is about to blow the doors off of long haul trucking industry? Tesla! Product after product they gain ground and widen the moat around them."

Quality Over Quantity!$NIO $TSLA
Electric charging port is inconvenient and time consumption. This is not practical unless battery swap technology is implemented.
hey Elon i don't mean to hate but how that rocket going is it like your stocks
Back to 300 very soon.
I think Tesla is settling down in my opinion It's a very strong buy at this low level and soon It's going to hit $1000 plus mark my words guaranteed. (very very strong buy)
Basically like a 100 million $ loss without bitcoin and tax cred
"NEWS: Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said he is expecting good news from Tesla next Monday night, April 26, when the company reports earnings, with upside likely across the board.Ives reiterated an Outperform rating and $1,000 price target on $TSLA"

"Why are the bullish msgs being deleted?Manipulation to the fullest... don't worry stay strong , tesla always goes back up ;). 666 eow"
"I like Tesla but I’m afraid that now that Mercedes BMW Audi and Volkswagen is joining the EV market, Tesla is going to lose most of the European market, These brands are serious competitors that Tesla newer had to fight before until now."
I see more Teslas on the road every day and more Tesla charging stations in urban areas.
"Next two supports are $565 and $485. Drop below $485, we will see $300 very soon. This is a $300 stock. Even at $300, it is very rich valued but we will give TSLA that value because of its potential of being No. 1 BEV manufacture."
Bitcoin down 18% as I type. TSLA down 3% but more red to come. The Big Short is unfolding.
After watching every other ev manufacturer try to glam on to Elon’s star to sell their weak evs it’s clearer than ever who you should invest in. Tesla long and strong.
its ok my avg is 400$ ...if it goes lower we load the truck with plenty of shares...I cannot be happier if that occurs!

"Reminder to Tesla longs: You have no made one single dime until you SELL. Brag that you got in at 80, or 150 or whatever, but you if you are still in (and down from 900 to 550) you have not made a dime yet. See you back at 150."

"Soon we will hear how Tesla has crushed its 1st quarter production figures. Followed by monthly leasing of FSD thousands of Tesla owner will sign up. Then Tesla will open up its supercharger network via an app to ALL EV’s a simple adaptor and instant accessibility. Bit coin will be over 60,000 and Tesla will look invincible Feel free to add to this optimism"
In 5 years ford is going to sell more EVs in American than Tesla. All big auto makers walked effortlessly into the ev market. Remind me what is that special about Tesla? What warrants the crazy over valued stock price? When it’s time the market wants self driving tech every company will be able to easily develop the tech too. The market for self driving and EV cars is small.
I would love to see this get to $690-705 and stay there tomorrow but that might be tough with all the short term call option plays out there.
$550 coming ?????
Don't worry Tesla will give all the money they accidentally took from customers. All money will be returned on 4/1 after the quarter ends so Tesla can show it on the books for quarterly earnings.
"Classic double bottom @ $560.Should be clear sailing for a short term rally, although I think it will be capped at $650-$700 for the rest of the summer"
if the 10 yr yield hits 2% I'll only be willing to pay 400 for tsla. You have to discount future cash flows at a higher rate and the pe multiple has to come down to compete with the 10 yr yield.
$800.00 this week folks. Buy the Best Buy Tesla.. Thank me later.
Someone explain me why we are down???
Tesla panic selling coming
"I thought Tesla is being shorted heavily by bitcoin maxis now, I'm expecting more correction. Well that didn't happen, I guess gamblers have already lost a lot of money."
I heard rumor that Bitcoin groups are going to short Tesla to below $100 a share because Elon ruined their party.
What's the difference between Musk and a con man???
Bernie Madoff scammed for decades before he was caught. Elon is next.
PE Ratio is 561.00x. DUH!
I will wait for this overrated stock to go down back to 200 then consider buying.
rumor: TSLA to be shorted by Reddit gang and social media groups to protest Elon
Tesla trades with bitcoin now. They don't make money with their core businesses so the move up today was directly tied to the move up in bitcoin.
Let short it
I'm long holding but I have to say this market is a joke
Nice volume ! Good day for build the base...
"TSLA is still 10 X over valued!Still suckling on the Gov to survive, while the CEO gets RICH!"
You know is bad when even your own ceo tells you that your stock is too high! I’m a buyer at $189
JPM increased their price target to a whopping $90/share? That's hysterical. How does that analyst still have his job?
"No support, $415 in a hurry, smh."
"A very salient point so many analysts & people on this board are missing. When Tesla sells a car they make a profit. When Mercedes, VW, Audi, GM or anyone else sells an EV they lose money on that vehicle. If this ever becomes a war of attrition the big three with either have to merge or go out of business. With Tesla having such a huge head start even if they all switched over to all EV's tomorrow how could they possibly remain profitable? Something has to give. Unless they can quickly figure out how to drastically reduce the cost of their EV's they're dead man walking but just don't know it yet."

Come on Bull analysts! be the first to say out loud that the ""emperor has no clothes"" and Tesla will not get that speculative revenue it has been lauding it as a Stock price saviour."

Going autopilot in Tesla crash on very hi speed According to police specially in very steep turn which man with the driver cannot handle and you’re blaming the auto pilot￼ that’s not honest opinion ￼what they saying about the auto pilot of Tesla auto pilot you have to be trained how to use it when to use it and if you have to use it all the time it has to go by the speed limit of the street the curve like that should go 20 mile an hour maximum not 120 mile so I still believe in Tesla and there’s things should be Educated about the auto pilot nothing will stop tesla they started and they will finish it perfectly God willing￼￼
dogecoin investors are like do your DD... pbffftttt... tesla investors cut from the same cloth...
Good job Elon u crashed the crypto market
Return of the king!
A year ago Musk said Tesla share was overvalued at 140$..I trust Elon and wait the stock to go back to 100s level
$580.96 close.
in my neighborhood I see more and more new tesla's.1 guy bought an electric Ford mustang. 
((( “We had to focus on removing radar and confirming safety. That release goes out next week to US production. Then a week or two to polish pure vision FSD and v9 beta will release. Difference between v8 & v9 is gigantic.” ))) The first 8 versions of the software do not offer hands free driving. The 9th version will not offer hands free driving.If that doesn't impress you then just wait for version 10.
At $580 TESLA would have a forward PE below 40 judging by last earning report. That would be a super excellent entry point for a company growing by 100% for the last year and this year. In the next 5 years it is projected to grow by greater than 50%. A winner indeed.
Always a good day when bears get owned.
Stock of the summer! Don’t panic! Shorts are trying to bully us out

Easy short down below $500. The bulls are expecting this to drop to the $400 range and will not buy the dips until then. This company is way over valued. Fair price is $200.
phew - the first of the ponzi schemes is falling apart.Next up is Tesla
It’s PE ratio is getting better every day. When it gets to 15 I’ll buy.
I just bought another 100 shares last week!
It’s a good company but right now a share of Tesla doesn’t worth more than $150-$250. It’s all hype by YouTubers. People who are buying this right now are gambling.

"Understanding how Musk is a con-artist is just a matter of looking. Take, for example, his introduction of ""solar shingles"" when he was trying to use Tesla's stock to bail out the bankrupt SolarCity (saving his cousins and himself from losing millions). The solar-shingle roll-out was Theranos-level fraud. There was no product, no research and development; it was a mock-up of fake shingles (on fake houses -- all done on a Hollywood movie studio set); there was NO energy being generated by any of the tiles, yet Musk stood in front of the crowd explaining how all those roofs around them were generating energy.Or look at Musk's claim -- way back when the stock was under $400, pre-split -- that he had the ""funding secured"" to take the company private. The CEO of a multi-billion dollar company telling millions of followers on social media a complete lie just to juice the stock price -- and the Board and shareholders didn't boot him out after that nonsense?!Or even consider how Musk seems compelled to lie about relatively little things -- and can easily be caught in those lies -- such as the defense he used for calling Unsworth a ""pedo guy""; Musk claimed the term ""pedo guy"" wasn't any insult suggesting one was engaging in certain criminal sexual behavior, but that it was a term, common in his native South Africa, that just means ""creepy old man."" People in South Africa reacted, ""Say what?"" -- it's a bald-faced lie that the term is such an insult in South Africa.Or look at Musk's statements about the bankruptcy that almost happened when Tesla was trying to ramp production of the Model 3. Musk claimed, after the fact, that Tesla was ""single digit weeks"" away from bankruptcy during the Model 3 ramp -- the problem is, this ""single digit weeks"" from bankruptcy never showed itself in the company's SEC-filed financial statements; they always showed they had solvency out about a year or more. Their auditors never required any ""going-concern"" warning with their audited statements. The only conclusion: there are two sets of books and Musk was aware of a bankruptcy risk being just days away, while the other set of books -- provided to the SEC and public-investor -- showed much better solvency.Or just look at the bovine excrement Musk pushes to SpaceX investors -- it's too long of a topic to discuss here, but The Common Sense Skeptic has made an excellent video series (available on YouTube) that debunks the sort of nonsense Musk spews while promoting SpaceX.Musk is a con artist, plain and simple. While that doesn't mean the entire company of Tesla is like a Theranos, it is very likely similar to Enron's type of fraud. Enron did approximately $80 billion of legitimate business a year before its bankruptcy; it was a relatively small amount of accounting fraud at the top -- which hid the true financial condition of the company from shareholders -- that brought the company down. Tesla is a real company, just not a profitable one. While it has shown losses for most of its life, I see enough evidence to conclude those losses were actually a lot LARGER than have been reported; and those quarters of ""profitability"" that got the company into the S&P 500 were all just an accounting fabrication.Silicon Valley start-ups have a saying, ""Fake it until you make it."" It's essentially an admission that lying is OK while you're trying to build a business. That can work with some technology companies because the profit margins in certain technology companies can be so high, a company can actually make up (and permanently bury) for its previous lying while growing the company. I think Musk has used this ""fake it"" strategy with Tesla -- the problem is: Tesla is a CAR company, with low margins; there is no high-margin pot-of-gold at the end of its growth-stages. My conclusion (looking at a lot more evidence than the few items I mention here): Tesla is a house-of-cards with massive losses hidden using accounting tricks. (I actually suspect SpaceX and The Boring Co are being used in ways similar to the way Enron used its ""SPVs."") Ultimately, I expect it will implode like Enron did."

wait what pe ratio only 700 how is yahoo calculating this anyone knows? this has to be wrong
Keep falling. No hope
"So meagre 185 k Q1 deliveries for a 635 billion company and someone raised price target to $1000. This is how pump works. Expect more ppl to pump on Monday pre market. TSLA remains cult stock. It is a great company and Elon is a genius. Realistically price target should be $100 post split ($500 pre split) or is that too much. Even I may buy TSLA stock to make some quick bucks, easy money. Indeed, last year it was my one of the two best performing stock. But where is the rationality in all this."
Today…. The ROAR of the Crash Dive Alarm!
"Forget all the numbers except 1. 50% growth on avg year or year. People are not going to stay out of this stock for long with that kind of growth. GM, VW, F, cannot produce any level of volume for another 2+ years to slow Tesla sales down. The only thing to slow them down, long term? They just can't build the plants fast enough"
"Reading the Tesla Q1 report I had a nagging question in my mind so looked it up. If Tesla was still holding $1.2B in BTC at close of business 3/31, what is it worth today?As of just now $107 Million less, almost as much as they claim in profit from trading the crypto."
My portfolio:$TSLA $MMEDF and BTC.That's it and that's all.I back companies that are actually doing good for this world. Mindmed to me is one of the most important companies in my lifetime and I'm in heavy!GLTA!
"Tesla metrics were very good, but stock down. Will be theme in all big tech stocks this week. We are at peak. Buy SP puts. Market will correct."

"Tesla will claim that driving on FSD, without someone in the driver's seat, is not allowed. Allowed? Any decent lawyer will argue: Why is it even allowed? This high-tech company has no way to prevent this behavior, yet still releases the product? Tesla is culpable."
"I do not doubt the short activity or that they’ll be a buck to be made there, but when paid content is publishing “short” activity of Tesla, that’s when the amateurs come in and get burned as the pros stat to cover. I think this will pass"
"""Mercedes Is Standing on Tesla's Doorstep"" No, Tesla is standing on the neck of legacy auto. Just a matter of time before some go under. Try finding enough batteries and being price competitive with Tesla without taking a loss."
If “the competition is here” how is Tesla receiving more regulatory credits each quarter? The so called “competition” is years behind and most will admit it.
"Cramer says Tesla failed to deliver 'blowout quarter,' believes Ford and GM pose a threat"
So without the Bitcoin Tesla earning is 150M?
They had some interesting insights about TSLA on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
It's just short covering rally--the direction is still downwards. I am not buying before 250.
I don't see TSLA crashing to what it is actually worth anytime soon. It will take either a major correction in the overall market and/or a major earnings disappointment. (What would that be? Flat sales and negative margins?).But it is dead money form here on. I can't see any catalysts to drive it higher and all the news is likely to be of the coming competition.

Is Tesla still overvalued or is this a buying opportunity? Asking because there are a ton of very nice electric cars hitting the market ie the Porsche Taycan
Sorry to all who are stubbornly anti Tesla. It was 3 or 4 years ago when I saw the battery skateboard in the mall I bought 1000 shares at $38 then I lived thru the endless barrage of attacks on Teslas valuations. I can’t tell you how many times I went in and out of this stock. I finally stopped around 1100 Presplit. Today I’m holding 4065 shares all of it is profit. To all you bashers keep on bashing your helping keep Tesla in the news and giving them amazing publicity ! To all who have shorted Tesla I guess I owe you a thank you as is some odd way you have pushed this stock up and to Elon THANK YOU ! THANK YOU ! Thank you !!

There are countries where such a behavior is illegal."

"Tesla promotes Autopilot as if it’s the world’s most advanced self-driving system. It’s not. There are 6 levels of autonomous driving, from 0 to 5. Autopilot is a Level 2 system, which the Department of Transportation defines as “partial automation” that requires the driver to “remain engaged with the driving task and monitor the environment at all times.” This year, Tesla is rolling out what it calls a “full-self driving subscription,” available as a $10,000 software upgrade on most models. But the technology falls well short of Level 5 autonomy, or “full automation.”"

"Could Tesla's Vehicle Deliveries Soar 85% This Year?Here's why the electric-car maker could see a substantial acceleration in its growth rate this yearTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was up against some significant headwinds last year. Not only did the automaker face tough year-ago comparisons when soaring Model 3 deliveries led to 50% growth in vehicle deliveries, but it had to pause manufacturing in the spring of 2020 as it dealt with lockdowns related to COVID-19. Yet the electric-car maker still managed to grow vehicle deliveries 36% for the year.Though Tesla's 2020 performance was impressive, it might look modest in comparison to the automaker's 2021 sales. The current consensus estimate for Tesla's vehicle deliveries this year is 850,000 units, up from about 500,000 in 2020. Indeed, one of the most recent analyst forecasts calls for 929,000 deliveries this year, which would mark growth of more than 85% year over year. Tesla's Models S, X, 3, and Y lined up on a road with mountains in the background.MODELS S, X, 3, AND Y. IMAGE SOURCE: TESLA.HTTPS://TS.LA/TESLAPRESSKITWhy deliveries should skyrocketIt's not too surprising to see analysts so bullish on Tesla's deliveries in 2021. The automaker has been making remarkable progress on expanding its production capacity. Going into 2020, Tesla had installed tooling at its factories for annualized production capacity of 640,000 units. By the end of the year, Tesla's installed annualized production capacity had reached 1.05 million vehicles.Yet even these figures don't fully capture Tesla's manufacturing momentum. The company also had two production lines under construction at the end of the year -- a Model Y production line at its new factory in Berlin, Germany, and another one at its new factory in Texas. Tesla said in its fourth-quarter update that it expects to begin vehicle production at these new factories this year.What to watchFortunately, Tesla investors will soon get better insight into whether analysts' optimistic outlook for the automaker's deliveries is realistic. The company will release its first-quarter financial results on April 26. Tesla's updates usually provide insight into recent delivery trends, demand, and more.We already know Tesla kicked off the year with strong first-quarter deliveries, as it announced its quarterly deliveries ahead of its earnings report. Tesla delivered approximately 185,000 vehicles, up 109% year over year. However, other information in the earnings report should still be helpful to investors when assessing the company's growth potential. First and foremost, investors should look for any commentary from management on demand for its vehicles. Obviously, Tesla needs more than strong growth in production; it needs similarly high levels of demand, too.In addition, investors can look to see if Tesla provides an updated view for its deliveries this year. So far, the automaker has only said that it expects total 2021 deliveries to increase more than 50% compared to 2020 deliveries.Tesla will report its first-quarter results after market close on Monday, April 26.Good luck and GOD bless,"

"Can anyone please explain to me why SNL, or anyone else for that matter, would hate Elon Musk?? He's trying to save the planet, nay, HUMANITY! Green power and cars and Liberals are #$%$ off?!?!? Can anything stop them from whining?? He's practically the 2nd coming.. If you hate him,,, you probably hate yourself..I know Bernie doesn't like him strictly because of his net worth (there's profiling for you).. The bottom line is that he HAS to have that net worth in order to have a controlling interest in order to keep his vision going in the direction that gets us off of fossil fuels.. That's so bad?? There's NO profit motive - just existential motive (for you, me and the rest of the planet).. Jesus,, just get a life!!"

"Tesla will attempt to solve ""Phantom Braking"" in their next release, which means they will dial down the criteria of safety sensitively. This will mitigate, lessen, the occurrence of false positives. But of course, at the price of increasing the risk of false negatives.

It is 0.1 oz. white grocery bag blowing in the wind, or a 200# white boulder tumbling down the cliff onto the PCH? You would know, FSD would not."

"Today in German press Handelsblatt Tesla is massivly overvalued...Tesla scheint ausgereizt: Mit einem Börsenwert von rund 560 Milliarden Euro ist die von Elon Musk geführte Firma mehr wert als Volkswagen, Toyota, Daimler, General Motors und BMW zusammen. Wer heute Tesla-Aktien kauft, bezahlt das Unternehmen und heruntergerechnet jeden Anteilsschein mit dem gut 700-fachen Jahresnettogewinn. Der Branchenschnitt liegt bei knapp zehn.Tesla ist so hoch bewertet, als ob die Firma in Zukunft mehr als die Hälfte aller E-Autos weltweit verkaufen und damit mehr als 50 Milliarden Euro Reingewinn pro Jahr erzielen würde. Tatsächlich schafft Tesla Millionengewinne – und dies nur mithilfe des Verkaufs von CO2-Zertifikaten und Bitcoins."

That VW ID.4 that everyone is dismissing IS the best seller in that little country (that everyone is dismissing) called Norway.In the 'more good news' column, the sales of ID.3 in Norway have gone down to a trickle. Just 165 or so this month, so the uptake was about 'new release' fever.Guru."

Next, you're going to tell me Tesla's turn signals don't signal that the Tesla is about to turn."

"Contra view. When you hear Cramer mocking Cathie Wood everyday, when you hear CNBC analysts saying they are shorting Ark funds, you know it is near the bottom of great tech stocks.

S0 if you stay with Ark fund, in the long run you will outperform by big margin."
"Cramer is so inconsistent. He gives him the ability to say ""I told you so"" no matter what happens.So, now he is negative on the quarter after yesterday saying ""buy TSLA before the earnings release and after the earnings release"".Now Cramer claims the earnings report disappoints. It's a great quarter, just not great enough."

Elon must go in order to save tesla get a real car ceo in their before its to late.............
selllllllllllllllllllll
Jeez.... Doesn't look like the price and P/E multiple is sustainable. Downward trend coming... and probably below $700 when analyst call starts. Don't see any near term catalyst for price momentum!
This video caused a lot of people to lose money yesterday and prob today.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CR10eBwU4f0
"tsla heros learn to see the stock @ 5xx.00 so you will better adjust when its 4xx.00 . Love reading the stuff on this board like tsla doesn't really have to worry about competition as every co. has to worry abut that. Next quarter might be the final chapter , lose money on making and selling cars and forget about the $400 level its going lower ."
"More and more Tesla’s on the road, If you live someone where the sun does not shine year round, then you probably don’t see many Tesla’s.Over the last 6 months there are a lot more.Your welcome Midwest people"
Ha - Tesla gigafactory in Berlin delayed 6 more months. Quick - name a Musk deadline that was actually hit. Yup - didn't think you could.
oh the FUD on this board goes Round n Round gonna wish you owned as many $TSLA in 5 yrs from now. Just FYI to all you FUD
"If down on a position it's important to avoid the emotion of ""clinging to hope"" that the position comes back. A good way to objectively evaluate the position is to ask yourself if you had the cash, would you buy that position with that cash? If you honestly answer ""no"" to that question, your rational brain is telling you to sell."
"stop lying to yourself, tesla profit is small and based on pollution credits, can it ever make a profit given the increasing competition and can it ever have a reasonable pe ratio"
"On Saturday night, a Tesla crashed near Houston, killing the two passengers. Neither was in the driver's seat, making it extremely likely that the Tesla was using Autopilot or Full-Self Driving features."
"Time to diversify into SMALLER cars for Europe and Asia. Keep the Growth, innovation and LESS OF Musk's tweets. The company will do great and be on top of the EV Market !"
"Elon is really not that brilliant. He's good at commercializing old ideas that have been around a long time. Electric cars were around when cars first out. People tried all sorts of propulsion, including electric batteries. The Hyperloop is nothing more that a large scale Kelly Tube. Those are what you use when you use drive up banking. They were around in Department stores back in the 1940's...perhaps earlier. Nothing new here....just old ideas scaled up."
"Two things are clear: Tesla is still not profitable without regulatory credit sales, and they lose money on everything except selling cars. Thus, this company should be valued like the other automakers with a PE around 10."
"Cathie Ark is buying more Tesla stock, expected price is $1000 "
"I don’t even like using cruise control, lol"
Consider the downside risks outweigh the upside. This has been happening since February. It ran out of steam and a huge correction is due here
How does CNBC explain this one?? Even with chip shortages they blew away estimates?? I thought all the other EV companies were eating Tesla's lunch?? 
Don’t own shares of Tesla and not a short either. But we all knew this bubble would eventually pop. It was trading at a crazy valuation 1000x PE cmon. I really hope it works out for you guys but I think this has a lot more room to fall. Especially with the 2008 icon buying over 8000 put contract. GLTA.
"it is funny pfizer saves the world,pays a dividend,has a pe of 19.no one buys the stock.tsla has a pe of 600"
Announcing you're going to produce EV without a product/manufacturing infrastructure = not a competitor. Producing EV with tech and efficiency years behind Tesla = not a competitor. Also understand that Tesla isn't going to stand still and let others catch up. The world welcomes competition (good for all of us) and the market share is the entire ICE market. Plenty of growth and profits for ALL players. But there is only one EV company that is leads right now. (Not financial advise)
Tesla is trading at $987 currently in N. KOrea
No sustainability whatsoever to the current market. You have seen the final swan song of a juiced market. The great earnings won't be seen again for a long time if ever. All the great comps against a Covid economy are meaningless. A devastating correction is just around the corner.

"If Musk, via his lawyers, files a motion, to not disclose conversations regarding details of how his compensation package was contrived, TSLA will tank."
Saw my first Tesla 3 in real world use. Parked next to it at walmart. I waited for the owner to come out so I could see what he had to say. Friendly guy starts telling me all about it. What a pain in the ars to have to stop every two hours traveling cross country to charge. The only good thing he had to say was how fast the acceleration is.
"There are many problems with Tesla, including:They will fail, because of the ""continued lack of profitability"", ""stocks gonna tank"" and it will be difficult to raise more cash, especially if Elon Musk will undermine investor confidence""All they have are some good-looking electric cars that sell below cost""Tesla doesn't have unique technology, they are using the same lithium-ion technology as everybody elseEvery other manufacturer will introduce a 300+ mile electric car on the market (there will be no advantage)zero-emission credits as a source of revenues (in the U.S.) and in Europe (deal with FCA) will dry tooOther manufacturers are forced to produce a certain amount of EVs, so they will do it, even at a loss, and then recoup the cost on conventional models (this is a major factor behind the rising prices on crossovers/SUVs and full-size pickups). For Tesla, it's a lot of EV competition.Another problem is too many employees at the plants (in particular at the Tesla Factory - currently closed)The vertical integration is wrong, as you not only spend precious capital instead of ordering stuff from suppliers, but also will be required to keep investing to stay competitive with external suppliers of the rest of the industry"
I am selling all of my Tesla shares once the market opens. Bye bye guys. I think this will slowly tank down and never get back to its golden days
Just bought the dip
"What a load of horse an shovel - night watch crew are still at it - 'didn't hold support, 200$ off this yrs highs, see you at 300$, I told you so, longs didn't listen, Cathy did this Elon did that' - nice to see so many dedicated to losing, still further, potential gains until year is out."
"The stock market is simply crashing as predicted by renowned financial experts like Harry Dent, Jeremy Grantham and Dr. Michael Burry who predicted the housing market crash of 2008 (the film “The Big Short”). I dumped my $BNGO and other stocks already and I am glad I locked in profits. I’ll reconsider rebuying $BNGO if it drops under $1. Many of the lesser stocks are reverting to December 2020 prices. The economy is screwed for at least 2 years. $BNGO does have a bright future in the long term but like many stocks, this one is currently overvalued. $TSLA and BTC will crash by June at the latest.If you firmly believe in your heart of hearts that $BNGO is gonna rebound soon and are rich enough to do so, go right ahead and keep buying the dip. If you’re not wealthy and cannot hold out for some years, you may consider selling.Good luck!"
"TSLA will release earnings April 26, after market close!"
This’ll be open and end in green
Is Tesla dead ? Competition caught up and they already have better cars.

"Interestingly enough, Buck remarked that his team actually managed to put down the fire within two to three minutes, which was enough for authorities to see that there were occupants in the vehicle. After these first two to three minutes, it was only a matter of keeping the batteries as cool as possible by pouring small amounts of water into the damaged battery pack. Buck described the fire department’s strategy in the following statement. “With respect to the fire fight, unfortunately, those rumors grew way out of control. It did not take us four hours to put out the blaze. Our guys got there and put down the fire within two to three minutes, enough to see the vehicle had occupants. After that, it was simply cooling the car as the batteries continued to have a chain reaction due to damage.“We could not tear it apart or move it around to get ‘final extinguishment’ because the fact that we had two bodies in there and it was then an investigation-slash-crime scene. We had to keep it cool, were on scene for four hours, but we were simply pouring a little bit of water on it. It was not because flames were coming out. It was a reaction in the battery pan. It was not an active fire,” Buck said.As for the rumors that the fire department had to call a Tesla hotline for tips on how to handle a battery fire, the Fire Chief stated that these reports were untrue. “We did not (call Tesla), and I do not know where (that rumor) came from. There is a chance someone else did, maybe the Harris County Fire Marshal, but we did not call (Tesla). Tesla has an emergency manual for first responders,” Buck said. He also noted that he is not aware of Tesla having a hotline for tips on how to control a battery fire. Buck also provided some new details about the Model S crash and how the fire department was involved. According to the fire chief, the first calls about the incident did not involve reports about a car at all. Instead, initial reports were about a fire in the woods. And while the Model S fire was notable when the firefighters arrived, it only took minutes to control the blaze from the vehicle."
fsd will exist ....company just has to make sure it is safe..based on that alone...they are going to make a lot of money...good luck betting against them though...long term I am bullish.

"I've been a long term believer and holder in Tesla, but I consider myself also to be objective when it comes to protecting my money. Tesla's sp action over the last month has me getting very gittery. If it breaks below 600, which is a critical support line, I will be selling all my holding as I think that I will be able to buy it back much cheaper. I don't like the fact that much of Tesla's sp appreciation rests on Cathie Wood's shoulders. Looking at the way that Archegos Capital Management's liquidation affected share prices gives me grave cause for concern re: Ark.Good luck to all shoulders"
That car crash in Houston cannot be a good thing for the future of self driving vehicles. This will make people think twice.

Interesting EV comparison report just came out. They compared the Tesla s p100 to the Taycan (100) and the Mach E (88) and surprise....they all actually have pretty much the same range at 75mph. Which was around 210-220 mile range. Due to Physics of EV's they are all really the same under the skin.

"Tesla Solar having business problems? I posted this a week ago, still nothing from Tesla.I submitted a solar roof deposit refund request about 6 months ago because of delays for the slate style roof tiles, not available yet after years of waiting. Still no refund check. I escalated with customer service reps several times since then, and they just talk and string me along telling me it's being processed by the billing department. Right now I just spent 1 hour and 30 minutes waiting on hold to talk with Solar Roof representative who just told me the same thing and to wait up to another 15 days for processing.What if I was a new solar roof customer? Why wait on hold for 1 hour and 30 minutes?Does Tesla have cash flow problems, is that why they are holding onto deposits without timely refunds?Or is it organizational mismanagement? That is just as bad.Pick one or the other.If anyone from Tesla is reading this, my Order Number: EN4566155.I would SELL this stock if they can't get their act together to properly run the business."
Ready for lift off
The issue is the strong results other Tech companies have posted this quarter. And many investors have digested the results now. This is not looking good for Tesla.

It has a huge growth potential and I feel eventually with their new innovation of the battery swap technology, it will out beat Tesla sales for the EV and they will be expanding to Europe selling their vehicles to Norway in September this year and then already confirmed they will be selling to North America. They have a lot of growth potential."

When they realize that HFs don't want to hold a stock that is negative on the year that they already made bank on. Then you're probably telling yourself, well...the institutions, they have to hold. Let me tell you about them, they don't care either way because they make money on the fees they collect. So they are just matching the ETFs and trackers. They actually want the market overall to crash because they just keep collecting fees on their funds. So don't be a bag holder, sell this sucker and move on.

"For anyone thinking that Tesla can absolutely dominate automotive industry, you are obviously not watching the market at all. Companies like VW, Mercedes, GM, Hyundai have way higher R&D budget that is now completely shifting towards EVs. Tesla doesn't even have the best technology in terms of power-trains, that position goes to Lucid Motors. Others are already taking market share away from Tesla and unlike Tesla, others are doing it with way better margins. I am huge fan of Tesla, but the stock is extremely overvaluated."
"TSLA is over valued! Doesn't have the manufacturing capacity nor does it have the service shops for EV owners to take their vehicles to in markets like the legacy auto makers do (F, GM, etc.)."
"Tesla reports 180,338 vehicles produced, 184,800 delivered in first quarter 2021... what price we will see Monday??? 750?"

Elon should not comment on Crypto nonsense. He must quit Crypto transaction. It is jittery. He should not combine Tesla and Crypto. His comments on Crypto affects Tesla stock.
Tesla needs China to survive. China does not need Tesla.
So what law firm has some brass ones that’s going to go after Elon for market manipulation and front running he cost the average person the average blue-collar smile and person around the world collectively tens of billions of dollars in losses because everybody listens to what he says and yet he profits from what he is doing. Where is the government now to say that people of influence cannot voice opinion and profit because if you were a stockbroker it’s called front running and you not only can lose your license but you will lose all of your profits that you traded for an extended period of time if any of your clients on the same security.
At least Tesla managed to make a small gain today on a miserable market day. The Amazon share holders are pulling their hair out right now. The company reported another blow out earnings yesterday and Amazon stock was down today. This stock market is F up!
So their profit was from energy credits and Bitcoin
Tesla’s best opportunity from here on is their mega battery storage for grids. The EV market is getting super crowded and solar is already super crowded
Oh my puts
It may be a good time to buy before they drop some fun news in the earnings call.
Shorts? Shorts?? Shorts??? Where are you????
"Is it possible that the analysts and money managers are starting to see that the bloom is pretty, but the roots are rotting and there is no fertilizer left? Naw, that's a bad analogy, because the amount of piles of you know what still being shoveled is rather significant.Well, perhaps the reality of a company boosting their revenue by selling products at a loss to try to get utilization above 80% while they triple their production capacity with investors money and no clear path to moving products will open a few eyes.The reason none of that worked with the bond guys is because they understand depreciation and return of capital.If shareholders were to have a better understanding of return of capital, then this would be at $50. It'll get there in time. I believe that.Guru."

Does anyone really think Ford can compete with Tesla who has like an 8 year head start? And the media is falling all over themselves touting how the Mach-E is going to eat into Tesla's market share. This is the same company that brought you the Pinto & the Maverick."

Oh look yahoo put out a bunch of fake news yesterday and now that the truth is out...they are silent as a mouse.Elon put out that the car didn’t even have the full autopilot upgrade installed. The fire chief put out that it took 3 min to subdue the fire and they stayed on scene for 4 hours because it was a Homicide and ensured the damaged batteries didn’t reignite.Also said he has no idea where the rumor of them calling Tesla for help came from.There you go yahoo...

One year ago this stock was $163.
"While $Tsla s and others success depends on the global demand of only 3% for Ev's, that's nearly nothing, and subsidies – they are getting more and more cut in world biggest ev market china, $NIO creates true demand.True demand can only be created through intrinsic motivation. And only NIO works since day one to create this intrinsic motivation for NIO Evs, a product which like every other product in our lifes dies over the time, if the demand is not driven naturally.Nio creates this demand through its brilliant and unique busines plan which includes- An own social Media app with social commercing aspects (This app had 2018 only 100000 users and now 6 million, this is more than exponential growth. Social commerce plattforms will become according to hedge fund managers who are investing there and me, Ninja MFNG SWINGA from dankshire hathaway for it alone a multi trillion dollar market within the next 15 years and NIO will control a luxury product version of it)-A universal battery approach to releave the pains, 97% – remember only 3% demand in world for evs – of people still get if they think of the probability of buying an EV. This universal approach includes battery swap, charging and a lot of other solutions, more than any other ev company.-A unique intrinsic brand value created through the luxury lifestyle aspect together with the luxurious NIO houses which can only be entered with a membership, owning/buying a NIO ev- And many more thingsBut there is much more than that. $NIO is the most brilliant busines plan which ever existed in history of mankind.The membership includes an entering into a whole news world, the multiple subscription services of NIO which will create for the first time in history steady revenue streams with Vehicle customers, customers become only in the NIO ecosystem loyal users.The margin of EV vehicles will more and more shrink, only NIOs huge intrinsic brand value allows it to make it the customers to pay any price but this will not be needed, NIO will make trillions of dollars alone from its multiple revenue streams and social commerce platform.You can see, NIO is not the ""Next Tsla"" but the next apple, facebook, pinterest, google (datas collected in cars), amazon and an EV company names NIO all in one.This is the diamond of this decade. Know what you own."

"An autopilot is a system used to control the trajectory of an aircraft, marine craft or spacecraft without requiring constant manual control by a human operator. Autopilots do not replace human operators. Instead, the autopilot assists the operator's control of the vehicle, allowing the operator to focus on broader aspects of operations (for example, monitoring the trajectory, weather and on-board systems). For all the confused people out there. This is the definition of autopilot"
Let's bury Michael Burry with his massive short on TSLA
Musk pumps share price with emissions credits. In other words with taxpayers money. 3rd richest guy in the world got there directly from tax payers money. FACT
elon pumped bitcoin to save his neck on the earnings call and then dumped it when he didn't need it. (its too volatile to accept as a currency for tesla) minimal short interest meaning longs are dumping it. P.S. cathie woods = elizabeth holmes inflation is coming and crypto won't save you p.s. margin debt is at record levels as it was in 2000 and 2008 before the crash folks sell crypto to finance margin positions on stock

"Investigator-""It's clearly Tesla sabotage!"""
nio and $tsla to da moon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wait till it drop to 500!
Just can’t understand current valuations and how to justify with the productions and I think it’ll take 100yrs before Tesla gets to current valuation and think the valuation should be below 100
$800 this week? Love Tesla!
Likely to slip from here to close. People don't want to hold TSLA over the weekend. Who knows what kind of news or tweet might happen then.
98% of car sales are still ICE and open to be transformed int EV sales. Lots of space to grow.... and not just for Tesla but Tesla is for sure in the lead.
Any intelligent shorts would want to cover before earnings. You could see a 50-75 point upward movement with upward earning surprise with $1 billion profits from zev credits + $1 billion profits from auto-software sales + $300 millions from batteries and finally $2 billion gains from bitcoin purchase. This earnings report should definitely be biased on the upside.
TSLA is a strong buy now! Some people are over concerned with Berlin delay. Remember it's just a small delay by comparing other big projects in Germany. TSLA delivered 500000 cars in 2020. Wall Street only expects 800000 cars for 2021 while people believe TSLA is going to deliver 1 million in 2021. Both Fremont and Shanghai sites are already able to produce 1 million plus Texas one 0.5 million. The growth for 2022 is even warranted!!!
OH BOY 700 HERE WE COME
"Past earnings will be insignificant relative to the long-term projections. This is a growth company and past performance doesn't mean jack. It's what they say about the remainder of the year, demand, new plants being built, china negotiations, etc...."
MARGIN CALLS are the next squeeze. I actually fell a little sorry for them
Big institutions are loading Tesla by selling oil-based stock. This will increase demand for Tesla shares. Price should go up !!

"All the gloating over delivering a few thousand vehicles one way or the other is pretty silly when you consider Tesla’s market cap is more than all other automakers combined and it produces just a tiny fraction of the world’s cars. Tesla could produce more cars than every other automaker combined (it won’t) and it would still need to do a lot more to justify its valuation TODAY. In the end, when and whether this bubble deflates will come down to whether Tesla wins full autonomy and robo taxi, which seems to be at the main core of the disruptive tech priced into this stock. If it doesn’t, the stock will plummet. It will, of course, take years to know the answer to that, perhaps over a decade. Until then, it will be a lot more volatility, extreme peaks and valleys, and trading on emotion with this."
"Landline phones were once everywhere. They were cheap and produced in huge numbers. Cellphones were new and expensive. Where are landline phones now? Oh, and Apple is a 2 trillion dollar company because of the cellphone."
Apparently all I can truly afford is 1 share of Tesla. My $1400 stimulus check isn't enough to cover for 2 shares. Wish me luck. I'm getting 1 share of Tesla at $740. I'll use my remaining change for a bottle of Jack Daniels and some lottery scratchers.
I really hope this company gets flooded with doge coin orders.

"Tesla Future Profitability In Question With Loss Of Regulatory Credit Revenue From Stellantis, Says Analyst"
Elon.....I know you don't read these boards but I just want to put this out there. This week a friend of mine was planning on using Bitcoin to put his deposit down on the brand new Roadster ($50K USD). Now that you just did this he is a little apprehensive that his Bitcoin will be refused for his purchase. It makes no sense you say Tesla will accept BTC and now retract that statement? To use BTC being mined and using coal energy as the excuse really? Nothing has changed in the past couple week except that BTC has dropped in value? Your sales people said the deposit would be based off current price of the BTC at the time of the transaction. He as waiting for BTC to hit $60K and put 1 full coin down as his deposit. Are you willing to accept BTC for payment on a $250K USD vehicle?
forget the chart look in market long or hold sell

"TSLA's car business at the end of 2040 if it all works out well:1. Makes 20 million vehicles per year in a good year, perhaps 20% to 30% of worldwide production.2. Makes a net profit of $2k (2020 dollars) with an average vehicle price between $20k and $30k (current dollars).3. Has 2 billion shares outstanding due to capital raises and employee stock option compensation.4. Net profit $40 billion or $20/shares.5. It's a no growth industry as world population has peaked and everyone who wants one has a car, they last for decades.6. What's it's P/E? At 10, it's worth about $400 billion (2020 dollars). Or about $200/share. In 20 years."
it's funny all the bears mentioning Tesla is in trouble especially with all the other up and coming EV players. Seem to forget Tesla isn't just a EV company. Think bigger.
my prediction is holding true down 40 today 500 end of week. 100 june

"This is devastating bad news for $TSLA.$NIO won the speakings with the Gas Station Giant Sinopec in china – Sinopec decided with that against Tsla, google tsla sinopec.$NIO will spread its universal battery approach with charging and swapping all along china and force others to enter BaaS.Sinopec has 35000 gas stations, NIo is planning to achieve 100 more of this deals within 2021, you heard it right.Battery swap AND charging Is already winning in china – NIO has swapping and everything else what others have and a bit more with mobile charging as a service within the battery as a service approach.China is NIo s, congratulations earlier or later this will flood the news in the western world. You better load up now if you panic sold or still waiting. NIO will become a multi trillion dollar tech compan within this decade and with high probability the greatest Vehicle company on earth!"
"I bought 100 shares of Tesla on margin @ 760, how screwed am I????"
Bag holders
The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is the ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its per-share earnings (EPS). A high P/E ratio mean that a company's stock is over-valued.
Do I see $600 at closing today???
The same game has been played with a Tesla for years they beat up enough to make the weak hand sell then they buy it for cheap run it up and sell off when the weak hand buy in at all time highs
Bought more shares today. Way OVERSOLD IN CORRECTION MODE........WILL BE 900$ BY YEAR END FOR SURE.................$$$$$
"31 pro analysts say buy... 1 washed up one hit wonder (burry, who's lost against tesla 2 previous times) says sell . Hmmmm tough choice.... I'll buy more and thank the weak hands ;)"
How high yall predicting TSLA to go tomorrow?
This was 900 just over a month ago. Isn’t 580 screaming buy?￼￼
Another upgrade from Canaccord $1050. BUT it seems this time the retailers arn't taking the bait - good for you. Many want out and will sell the news.
"During the run up to battery day (Sept 22, 2020) there was a LOT of commentary on batteries here, but now it seems to have died down. The bots have been put to sleep I guess.Unfortunately, the battery developments have not disappeared. During the battery day, Elon Musk touted many interesting (and highly unlikely) things for their battery development. So far it looks like the 4680 is scheduled for production around 2023 (although I suspect the 'test' factory is already working on production issues to get the process in place.)Meanwhile did anyone notice that every other battery researcher, manufacturer and designer has been hard at work? Solid State Batteries are getting closer and closer and better and better.Perhaps by the time Tesla has a 4680 plant up and running the SSB will be just a few months away, making the whole thing practically . . . impractical? Perhaps not not obsolete, but think LCD vs. LED vs. OLED. The paybacks get smaller as the speed of innovation increases.Interesting times in the world of energy storage.I am betting that in 2025, there will be an awful lot of BEVs with SSB available. This will reduce cost, increase range, dramatically improve safety and still, (still!) not make BEVs a game changer for mobility. The environment will appreciate it though.Guru."
China owns 70% of the global minerals rights. While we were #$%$ about race and inequality they were buying up mining fields around the globe. This is what our fake news doesn't talk about.
Whole market blood bath tomorrow again.
"Next time Tesla ticks up I'm selling... I tried to believe, but Musk is just full of #$%$ The bitcoin thing was nothing less than financial manipulation to avoid a disasterous Q1, but the market saw right through it. Their solar roofs are 3X to 5X the cost of everyone else's solar panels. Tesla will never make money off insurance - they just provide it because no one else will insure their cars at a reasonable rate. FSD will remain unaffordable to most and it doesn't even work that well. A fully-autonomous fleet of robo-Teslas is complete pie in the sky. They have lots of competition in the charging network arena. Instead of prioritizing affordable cars Tesla prioritized the Sportster and semi. Given their current battery tech's proclivity for catching fire after an accident I have serious concerns about their new battery tech, which sounds like it is even more volitile. LOTS and LOTS of competition is coming, I don't see anything happening in 2021 that isn't already baked into the stock price. They are losing $800 per car if you subtract bitcoin and carbon credit revenue. Within a few years GM, VW, Ford and others won't need to buy carbon credits anymore. The only thing I can see helping this stock is the infrastructure plan, but even then the P/E - and hence the stock price - must come into alignment with the rest of the industry. The ""cool factor"" - which propelled Tesla stock to these insance heights is DONE. Neeto - speedy little cars with no interior...wheee... Sorry - DONE. In 5 years Tesla will be a niche player in the high-end EV market. Ford, GM, Toyota and VW will dominate the affordable segment of the market. Peace out."
So much jealousy...
So guys what’s going to bring this stock to 850 or 900
Gonna order a Tesla tomorrow and having mixed feelings. As an investor I’m happy they are raising the price. Compared to what else is available for the same $$ Tesla takes the cake. Let’s bring our balance sheets up. As a consumer I’m a little disappointed I didn’t pull the trigger a couple days ago. Oh well Tesla to a $1000 in the next 257 days or less! Best company in the world and they currently make the best vehicles for under $100k. If you want to hate go try one out and see how you feel afterwards.
still overvalued
This is a great level to pick up more shares and if it dips in the red I get a few more. Its not a race to sell Tesla stock these company shares are valuable and when this starts another legendary bull run I dont want to regret not having when I had the chance. # Diamond Hands
good to see a break above 700!
HEY GUYS I'M BACK JUST CHECKING ON MY PREDICTION. WHO THINKS IT WILL HIT MY $765.00
"bag hodlers, unite together and drop the bag. It is time to leave the Musky Cult of over promising and never delivering. FSD is a long shot that will not happen unless there are major infrastructure and civil engineering changes. Li Batteries will be worse for the environment if they are not recycled and the govt requires that a certain percentage of successive EV models are required to have a higher percentage of recycled material and recycled Li batteries. Beyond the obvious physical and financial limitations of our world, this simply will not happen. I'm not saying EVs won't become popular vehicles, they will. They just won't make any difference. Laws will not allow any passenger or pedestrian risking vehicles to ever be without a driver behind the wheel. Finally, no other automaker is interested in being a subscription buyer of Tesla's tech. Literally speaking, I have seen no indication of any major automaker desiring or paying Tesla to use their batteries or any self driving software/hardware."
"Don't mess with Elon, if Elon buys back TESLA shares, he would destroy all shorts. He is waiting at the right time to get all together and destroy them like what he did before for 6 years."
"Im bullish on Tesla, but this current market does not like an expensive valuation. I got out at 750 and I seemed to have for now made the right decision."

@dd Idk if your a bull or bear honestly. The whole market is a sea of red even $tsla is down. Can someone explain too @dd how the market works? Not all days are green but the dd is ! Long hold go $srmx!
"if TSLA's target is $3000 by 2023, it wont wait till that time to reach. Market will reward TSLA in advance and expect it to perform. This is how growth oriented companies are rewarded and valued. This means we could see $3K much soon most likely by this year end. Lets see."

"Tesla picked up another Buy rating on Monday from an analyst who sees Apple-like potential in the electric-vehicle pioneer.Cannacord analyst Jonathan Dorsheimer upgraded Tesla (ticker: TSLA) shares to Buy and increased his price target from $419 to $1,071. That represents a 124% boost to his previous target price."
Earnings report and subsequent results will take this stock higherSimilar situation occurred with alibaba stock a couple years ago and the setup for a huge surge Then a slight decline before settling in at those higher levels/700’s will seem cheap
800 Monday.
"As I troll this thread today... I see those screaming the loudest are the ones that are losing the most! All caps ain't gonna help the pain, shawty... only KY will ease the reaming you're gonna get with the squeeze that's coming. Looking forward to more all caps from the shorties when tsla crosses each hundred dollar milestone. $600=OUCH! $700=OH MY CULO! $800= MAKE IT STOP! $900= OMG!!!And $1,000? Well, I can only imagine the pain will be such that ya just can't even reach for the keyboard anymore. LOL!!!"
"Price is what you pay; value is what you get. Longs have done a nice job riding up the bubble, but the stock price today is not an accurate reflection of the durability of any competitive advantages Tesla has. Buying Tesla today will end badly."
Bigger green and smaller red... hold on to your stock and be happy on earning day.
"Have a strong feeling shorts are going to be depressed AH Monday, let’s hope so at least."
God bless you Tim Scott
short tesla at this level might be the best play of the decade
"Tesla's profitability in recent years has been driven by its sale of regulatory credits to automakers that hadn't hit their government imposed electric vehicle sales quotas.Stellantis purchased about $2.4 billion worth of the tax credits from Tesla over the 2019-2021 period.The regulatory sales credits represent pure profit for Tesla, and in 2020 represented $1.58 billion in revenue for the EV manufacturer. But Tesla only registered net profits of $721 million in 2020, meaning that the company actually lost money on its main business of building and selling cars."

Elon is wrong https://cointelegraph.com/news/banking-system-consumes-two-times-more-energy-than-bitcoin-research
what is really depressing in this forum is how surreal all this is. VW just sold 130.000 cars in Q1 in Germany in alone -- including 16.000 EV cars. Yet people are rambling about how Tesla is the number car company in Germany. Tesla sold 6000 cars in Germany in Q1.
Every time when it’s down 10 points. I am adding 5 more shares Shorts has to fill the order someday. That someday will be their pay back time.
Tesla is so much more than a car company . 95 percent of revenue from car sales. Yeah 900 was the peak
Yay!!! To $550!!
Mad Musk on the rampage again shooting himself and stock holders in the foot. Lots of bitcoin millionaires out there no longer want to buy Teslas or Tesla stock. Why does Elon have to be such a spoilt brat all the time?

Funny how this comapny always seems to get to the goal for Elon to get his payout.
Coal price up to $70 a ton from $40 a ton a year ago.
Week opened at $580.97. Can TSLA prevent a 4th consecutive week of loses? Inquiring minds want to know.
"TSLA has never been about retail and institutional investors making sure profits on a regular basis (the Wall Street mantra). It’s about moving the world towards energy sustainability and getting excess carbon out of the atmosphere. It’s been evident that any profits that Tesla makes (except for the small ones for the last 5 quarters) go right back into growing the company. Tesla was not set up for day traders, shorts or the competition to make a killing. One of its goals is to encourage other manufacturers to switch to electric transportation. Even if Elon Musk becomes a multiple trillionaire his previous actions and interest indicate his wealth will go right back into other Earth-improving projects and space ventures. Gigafactories don’t come cheap. Micromanaging and second guessing Elon Musk just doesn’t come into play. Don’t know if he will pull it all off. But it’s been a wise bet in the past to go along with him in the long term. He is better at what he does than anyone else doing what he does. He’s a genius, visionary, eccentric at times, unpredictable, adverse to risk and always doubles down. Sure there were missteps and failures along the way. But they ikturned into learning opportunities and with persistence applied to further success. He does particularly well with his enterprises that are closely held companies with only a few private investors and not subject to “slings and arrows” of the general market place. There is no guarantee with any stock that it will perform or even be worth what was paid for it. He’s not perfect but is a far cry from being reckless and irresponsible. Innovators always have headwinds. Ride too bumpy to own this stock? Fine, stay with the blue chips and “sure bets”. It’s prudent to make a risky investment a small part of a diversified portfolio. Best wishes for your investments and good luck."

Wall Street market makers to everyone who purchased TSLA calls and puts yesterday:
"TSLA is done! It's only going to continue to go down! Dumping all in the morning, putting it into Bitcoin, ETH where the real money is"
"Load a Tesla with people and stuff (follow manufacturer’s limits). Out on the highway it’s phenomenal how much power the Tesla still has to maintain speed, stop and safely pass other vehicles.

"Designing and Building EVs is not hard. Tesla, under Elon Musk's ""leadership"" just makes it seem that way. So why didn't other OEMs start doing it earlier? Because, due to battery cost, could not earn a profit doing so, just like Tesla. Now that battery costs have declined, and capacity increased, everyone is joining the fray. Tesla has been enticing a specific demographic, with silly frills, like gull wing doors, smart summons, and fart noises. All the consumer wants, is a car that functions as well, or slightly better, in all attributes, as their current ICE vehicle, for the same price."
5 analysis upgrades plus Jim Cramer all say but Tesla now with 4 over $1000 target !!! What are you waiting for ? Don’t listen to those bear all they want is price drop to get in and get your shares at cheaper price !! Don’t wait to get in at 800-900 which is coming after quarter earnings
Avoid the noise. TSLA closing above key technical level of 700. Going Long scaling in shares. Good Luck
"With a bit of time to kill today, I reviewed German EV sales in detail.Tesla sold 3,703 Vehicles in March and is at 6,074 for Q1. VW (not VW subsidiaries like Audi or Porsche, just VW) has many BEV models,If you include ALL of Volkswagen BEV sales their MONTHLY number (March) is 6,904, which is more than Tesla sold in the entire quarter. VW's Q3 sales in just GERMANY were 16,220 which is half of what Tesla sold in ALL OF EUROPE in Q3.For now, it's just one company, but competition is coming and Germany, like Norway has tailwinds due to incentives.Guru"
Judge orders Tesla to provide documents involving Elon Musk’s compensation. But you know who's tax returns stayed in the closet for four years & never came out. Comical .

Is Baillie Gifford continuing to dump TSLA shares. The 40% of TSLA holdings BG sold during Q1/21.....may be the coup de grace for TSLA’s future outlook.
Buy more tesla shares I am in the green since I bought this morning at 580.10￼. 
Going to 800 100% next week

"One simple question: Since TSLA has invested in BTC-USD, why is Musk publicly promoting DOGE-USD instead? Can you imagine Mary Barra telling everyone to go out and buy a Mach E? Not that long ago, a move like that would have gotten a CEO fired."

"One of Tesla’s engineers told California authorities that Elon Musk overstated the capability of Autopilot, the company’s driver-assistance system, early this year. The clarification was described in a series of records the California Department of Motor Vehicles released to the legal-advocacy group Plainsite, which published the documents Thursday. According to a March 9 memo, DMV officials asked CJ Moore, a director of Autopilot software, about Musk’s claims that Teslas would be capable of fully autonomous driving this year. “Elon’s tweet does not match engineering reality per CJ,” Miguel Acosta, chief of the California DMV’s autonomous vehicles branch, wrote in the memo."

"Here we are mid-May and the redesigned S and X are still not available. Q2 revenue from sales is going to disappoint. It is becoming clear that not only is Level-5 autonomous driving much farther away than advertised, Tesla is not even leading in this field! Throw in chip shortages, waning demand and support in China, the solar roof class action lawsuit (and complete lack of viability and sales), increasing competition, the delayed Semi and Cybertruck... there is just nothing to get excited about here. The one thing that may help is if the $7500 tax credit is restored, but rumor is that would only be for the Model 3. Things do not look good for the rest of this year for Tesla."

"WOW. Elon just went ALL IN, stating that ""data logs recovered so far show autopilot was not enabled."" This is good news for Tesla if accurate, but you better hope he is 100% accurate on this, or could get ugly real fast. Officials are saying they have witness statements from people who said {the two people in the crash} had left to test drive the vehicle without a driver and to show the friend how it can drive itself. Also noteworthy: Research of real road testing has shown that autopilot will turn itself off unexpectedly before a crash (see Missy Cummings research), so this actually creates a plausible explanation....."
back to 600 we go
People are being confused of what trimming of Tesla stock means. This is absolutely normal for any hedge fund company. This has nothing to do with Tesla. It’s simply increasing some liquidity to invest in other stocks rather then borrow or use existing cash.

"Not only Tesla didn't produce a single Model S or Model X in Q1 2001, it did deliver some ~2,000 copies from inventory. It BRINGS UP THE QUESTION, HOW MANY OF THE SOLD UNITS OVER ALL THE QUARTERS ARE REALLY ACCOUNTING TRICKS? If there is any demand for these vehicles, how come the company have over 2000 of the model for which they actually shut down the production right before Christmas and haven't produced one single unit during the entire quarter, despite Elon being on recording (I have the Q1 Investors calls recording) back in January 2021 and saying that Model X and S had gone through a refresh and thats why the production line was closed and now its open, and in fact they are producing those models right now. And in the SEC filling K-8 last week they are saying not one single model S or X was produced.Some more investigation of Teslas inventory and sales figures needs to be done, specially the bulk selling, I wouldn't be surprised its company owned entities via some complicated structures doing the bulk buying jacking up the sales and delivery figures, but in reality they are sitting in some warehouse somewhere in the world."

"One of the main key principles of Warren Buffet is that you have to look into a company to see if it has good management. For Elon to invest in Dogecoin, Bitcoin or cryptocurrency is like betting you Tesla stock holders' money on Russian Roulette. That is already not a good way of investing and Warren Buffet states he will never touch on cryptocurrency because it is not a physical commodity and that bubble for that bull market could blow out of proportion very easily. His way of investing your money is already down the wrong path and not intelligent. For you guys as Tesla stockholder's, will you want to to risk your money with his company on a Russian Roulette? Nio Inc. is an uprising EV company that is beating Tesla on sales in China and is confirmed to sale their ev to Norway this September to Europe and already confirmed eventually be delivering their cars to North America. They also have very good company management and have a lot of free cash flow to smart investing and not what Elon is doing. Those who want to buy low and sale high, this is a good time to transfer your funds to Nio. Nio has lot of top companies throwing in their money on them and is predicted their stock price can rise up to 300-400$ in 4 or 5 year. I totally lost faith in Musk when his methods of investing his (or our money) is extremely unintelligent."
"fElon lucked out w Bitcoin buy twofold:1) another diversion away from the fact that demand sucks2) zev credits dwindling, so he needed another revenue source"
Next stop 555???
"To the moon is old. To Mars, here we go! And TESLA is just ramping up production. The 1 million cars sold in 2021 is achievable. They have so many irons in the fire. TSLA will be the most valuable company in years to come..."
 All i gotta say. $732 GAP fill today ? maybe test $750
Elon should have stayed away from cryptos and Twitter. He may profitted from the BTC but he is hurting investors' interests.
breakout...
bagholders looking how their margin calls on long positions get evaporated
"The Execs of Tesla and the Big players seem to be planning a COUP ! I will believe it when I see $750..Bears seem to be winning. I have been a Tesla follower from when the stock was $17... strong believer, but now question the path being taken !"
Last Friday it moved from 670 to $710. Can the stock make the same move?
"The numbers don't lie. Tesla demonstrated quarterly production capacity of over 28,000 Model S and Model X vehicles back in 2017; they've produced at roughly half that capacity over the past two years. Tesla is clearly not selling all the Model S/X vehicles they COULD make -- and since margins/profits are so much better on the S/X (compared to the Model 3) they certainly WOULD be producing more S/X models if they could sell them.Look at the specific delivery numbers on Tesla's Model S and X vehicles from the time they first started to report deliveries of Model 3s -- that would be Q3 2017: In Q3 2017 Tesla delivered 25,915 Model S and X vehicles. In the 4th quarter of 2017, they delivered 28,425. In 2018, Tesla delivered (each quarter respectively): 21,815; 22,300; 27,710; 25,161 S/X vehicles. For 2019 Tesla delivered (each quarter respectively again): 14,163; 14,517; 16,318; 17,933 vehicles from their S/X line. For 2020 (yes, Covid 19 affected things some), the respective quarter delivery numbers for Model S and Model X vehicles combined were: 15,390; 6,326; 16,992; 16,097.Ignore the low number (only 2,020 vehicles) S/X models delivered in the 1st quarter of 2021 because of ""retooling"" if you want, but looking at the broad data on Model S and X sales over the past few years should tell you there is NO growth in the S/X model line."

Telsa will ship ~1M EVs in 2022. If you want to buy another $TSLA when it was cheap you need a time machine.
Need this back to $900. Then split it 9 for 1.
If you buy this stock you are gambling how long the mindless cult will ignore fundamentals more than anything
Smart investors will buy today
"bought my first share last week, thinking of adding some more, but do you think I should wait or will the stick price go up or down this upcoming week?"
Tesla first STONK ever to go down every single day for almost half a year all of 2021 so far. Anyone remember when Musk was the richest person in the world? LOL ! He’s not in the top 500 now
ELON the CON!
governments are investing heavily into renewable energy. renewable energy is now cheaper to produce than fossil fuels. the tesla vision. tesla cars being powered by renewable energy. last time I checked most all governments are going green. a bottomless pile of money going into green incentives for renewable energy.

"Wait until Tesla releases their $25,000 EV. GAME OVER!"
"Here's a beautiful history lesson for young investors following TSLA. In 1999, Cisco was viewed as a tech-genius high-growth stock perfectly positioned to benefit enormously from the internet. This is an article from WSJ in April of 2000 trying to justify ridiculous analyst price targets on Cisco (CSCO). Guess what happened next??https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB955485845794159366""So far, however, analysts such as Morgan Stanley's Mr. Kelly have been right on the money. Indeed, an investor who followed Mr. Kelly's ""strong buy"" recommendation back in 1990 and held the stock for 10 years would be up 111,900% on the investment, after nine stock splits. And there is no sign that the momentum-style investing that has carried stocks like Cisco to their current levels is about to change anytime soon.Even more extraordinary, however, is how readily Wall Street has set down its old tool kit for valuing the shares of big tech companies.""I spend a good deal of my time talking with investors these days about valuations,"" Mr. Kelly says. ""And it is a bit of an art. But with the stock's P/E ratio above 100, my job is to say how will investors value the stock going forward. How I feel about it isn't important,"" he says.Like I said, guess what happened next? Take a look at the CSCO chart in 2000. History doesn't repeat but it often rhymes."

Big Move. Up 170 from a few weeks ago. More steam left ?
Too bad they didn’t outfit with $AEVA 4d Lidar. This wouldn’t have happened.
"So, how big of a Q2 Bitcoin loss will Tesla have to report? Ha Ha Ha... Live by the sword, die by the sword!"
Ready for the next lift-off??? My models show $2000 / share by July 1. Then some very slight consolidation to $1800. Before next move to $5000 next year.
"In case anyone isn’t paying attention, the rest of EV/battery/green energy stocks are getting slaughtered again today. The rapidly deteriorating bubble euphoria in this area area may flow to Tesla soon, once the smaller caps fully deflate"
"Typical manipulation this will gap up big next days and week it had great earnings, cheap calls right now at 750 or 800 calls for a good quick buck and shares for the long rung always good, so just buy and hold"
It happens everytime Tesla reports. Earnings are priced in for the next 20 years guys.
"Sticking to the topic/ opportunity to buy and reap the benefits asIt’s not going to tank, the distractions are weaker, the stock will trend upwards towards what is expected to be a very positive earnings next Monday pm."
Cover my shorts. Will short again when it tests the new 52 week high.
"No further support until 370. This was the session were it was supposed to cross the 600’s if the stock was oversold, but it didn’t happen. If Bitcoin crashes to 10k the decline will be even more. Mr. Musk has already wiped all crypto holders out so you shouldn’t be surprised if he does the same with Tesla’s shareholders"
"no big shock, just a mild smooth pop after hours. that's my call. that's all i want. i don't want a 15% pop."
Cathie woods played tesla accurate. She lowered her position
Tomorrow be like
"Can't believe people still invest in $TSLA and think they will make money, those days are over. This company is a scam"
I have a great feeling we’re going to see some nice gains tomorrow. $TSLA posted $0.93 earnings per share when $0.79 were expected. Also sees 50% surge in deliveries this year. Let’s go $TSLA
Tesla shorts....
"I’m holding 4500 shares of Tesla and it has made me a fortune I’ve already sold my losers and my laggards to buy more and more Tesla. I’ve sold a few times over the years and I’ve bought it back. Mostly but not always it’s been a net gain for me. I won’t mortgage my house or take on any margins but I will buy more as money lands in my account my goal 5,000 shares by year end and a $1,000 dollar price target by 2022. And I am sure I am not alone on this. Thank you Elon for the greatest stock I’ve ever owned."

"Tesla claimed they don't need LIDAR for their self driving system, relying on radar and cameras only. Now Musk is stating they will go one more step, and eliminate radar all together, and use just cameras. That's what us older engineering folk call ""Going back to the drawing board"". Of course, this means more advanced cameras, and ANOTHER total rewrite of code. Musk as been touting that all Teslas bought since 2017 have the hardware for full autonomy, and will be worth 3X purchase price. Uh, no they don't, and uh, no they won't. The class action lawsuits are going to make a #$%$ load of lawyers very wealthy."
Tesla's reputation now forever tied to the nonsense of Bitcoin/Dogecoin. Thank you Elon Musk.
Volume is dead nobody is buying this anymore. Put your money in DOGE or just any slot machine or roulette wheel.

"Does anyone know what happened to all of those battery innovations from battery day? I haven't listened to the CC yet, but maybe I missed some important bits along the way.On battery day the company basically said that they were going to improve battery cost by 56% and increase range by 54%. To be fair, they said that it would happen in 2022 hopefully, so they have a bit of time. They also said that they were the leaders, but I have noted that others have million mile batteries and costs are dropping rapidly etc.Nothing that they have said has come to pass yet that I can tell, and there has been no evidence since that time. In fact, the company still produces cars for about the same price, but at a loss, and the range estimates provided for new Teslas have been clearly shown to be excessive (lies may be strong but, they are off by 15-20%) and have not increased.Any ideas about where things are at from the well informed?Guru."

I think mask is out of cash. In accouting auditing these are clearly red flags. This may be bigger than Lehman and Enron combined.
"lol... how is TSLA not down 10% right now?... 500 billion dollar market cap for a tiny auto company...... even if it grew up to be a big boy auto company, it's still worth less than 1/4th this market cap and possibly less if they don't figure out how to make their cars ACTUALLY profitable."
"""Honesty"" makes an excellent point. My 3-year old Silverado warns me if there is a gallon of milk in the BACK seat, but Tesla's FSD can't even detect if there is a DRIVER in the FRONT seat?"
So...Down AH on good earning news...Profit taking? Or was the expectation that earnings would be even higher?
what time is earning tomorrow morning? or after close?
My call spreads would love to see a close above $565 today.

"Really really bad news for Tsla. This is something, western media does not tell to you.

"Ford electric pickup reveal went well, very impressive specs and amazing features and entry level price under $40k.That's not what really surprised me though. Watching YouTube reviews by Tesla fans, and noting their overwhelming enthusiasm for the Ford, well, I read online of people cancelling Rivian orders and Cybertruck reservations to get the Ford.Please tell me again that competition doesn't matter to Tesla."
Where are the buyerS!
You gotta love how all the naysayer shorties on here are whining about how come of Tesla's earnings come from tax credits sold and Bitcoins and this and that... What difference does it make where Tesla's earning comes from? They're MONEY WHICH THE COMPANY IS MAKING LEGITIMATELY. Profit money coming in for a company is profit money. Who cares how they make it as long as they are not breaking any laws. I don't see you naysayers whine about Coca Cola making some of their earning from licensing their brand name for merchandise. Is that really a good source of income? Kind of iffy...!
"at this rate... with Austin and Berlin coming on line and model y still ramping, aren't we on track to hit 1m eoy? I mean, under 900k just seems empirically lazy at this point..."
I think shorting this one isn’t a good idea. Elon has a cult following - 1 day can again change things back for him.
Just saw a commercial for a Lucid. Watch out Tesla.
One wordFORD
Better stay in bed tomorrow xD
No one cares about TSLA earnings... they only care about a skyrocketing stock..... not sure about this one... seems cheaper now then earlier today.
"Dear Shorts,It might be time to cover. Tesla has tested the treadline at $591 and bounced off. It's possible it will head to $700 in the next few weeks. I bought at $600 today, and I'd probably buy again at $600.Just sayin."
"see you in 2030 Tesla WILL be way over a $1,000.00 a share. See you there !!!!!!"
"But the dip now. It will open Green. Seen it before when TSLA announced earnings. When it went down, within a couple of days, it will go up again. I did 20 shares @ 720 this morning. Good luck "
"Hmmm, Ford and Volkswagen are real threats alright...LOL! Talk about hyping Ford, which sold how many EVs? 4,000? LOL! And Volkswagen is buying some credits from Tesla? LOL! Some competition they are... Some analysts have no clue. Tesla doesn't have to prove anything. They're on a roll. EV's and tech that goes with them, solar energy, battery packs, roof panels and outside of it you have Boring, SpaceX, Starlink...did I miss any? On the EV front and not too far away are the Cyber truck and the Semi. Joint venture with Toyota for SUV EV's. Oh and India is knocking on the door. Hare Krishna! Namaste!"
should have just sold my Tesla stock when you named your child X Æ A-Xii. you're no longer a visionary but just a bored billionaire hooked on Twitter.

I love the data logs released by Tesla on the Chinese protesters supposed “brake failure.” Brakes work just fine according to the logs. Used 40 times successfully in the half hour before the crash. Speeding and stepping on the brakes too late and too little seem to be the cause of the accident despite the protesters crying. Ha ha ha. Kudos to Tesla for having the data handy. 
"Looks like the ""death by a thousand cuts"" scenarios is about to begin for TSLA. No major mover events upcoming. Where once TSLA would creep upward for any lack of tangible news, the opposite seems to be happening. Unless a stampede occurs, expect this herd of bulls to migrate peacefully to greener pastures."
The first TSLA 5-1 split really helped my portfolio. Looking forward to another one. Even hoping for the next split to be a 10-1.
"Look at Zoom, Snowflake, AirBNB, Crowdstrike as all these recent hot stocks have pulled back almost 25-50% from their highs. Tesla isn’t the only one but you don’t hear everyone slamming the others. If stocks only went up everyone would be in the market 100% ! These are pullbacks that will happen when they rocket up too fast. Hold and don’t let shorts get in your head as their game is to TROLL these boards and spread fear. Use your own head and NEVER use yahoo finance conversations as your investment guide!!!"
"Germany 2020 YTD sales as of April == 3,420 German 2020 YTD sales as of April == 6,513 Good luck everyone"
We’ve made millions from Tesla already  shorts have lost millions and will lose more 
"Although for the small trader or long option buyer, TSLA is dead money, professional longs who are lending their shares out to shorts and writing covered calls, the return still might look good enough to warrant holding."
Looks like Amazon is going all in on RNG... so much for the Tesla semi... maybe 1 day... but for now buying 1000 Wprt engines and potentially controlling the entire RNG engine market for a few $ billion.
"While TSLA will teturn to more reasonable PE over the next two years, it will be a steady decline, marked by occassional runups. So you have time to get out, even though you've lost about a third of your peak already. Use the spikes to exit. Don't be more of a bagholder than you are now."
Hello I'm Tesla!
$540 here we come. Will there be support there or will it blow thru stop loss and break $500 ?
is not going well with tesla I think word still lower me question why is still going lower what happened how long is going to be low
"All I see is shorts spamming. Not a single person this week, or ever, has provided any fundamental criticism. When you're paid to spam, all you're good for is getting reported for spam. I've been a long in many winners over the years because I had conviction in the company & their products/services. These include $TSLA, $NIO, $ROKU, $AMD, $JD just to name a few. Every single one I had conviction and have profited in hundreds to thousands of percentages with each. $XPEV is no different for me. The market momentum in the past month or so is driven by unfounded fear...this week's knee jerk selling due to already known inflation is disproportionate to the concern. EV stocks have gained popularity from last year as many new investors had fomo. That money moved to new viral crypto gambles this year as institutions pulled strings to make profits from all of their own losses from those viral plays they missed out on. So they have been driving the prices down in the EV sector for months to cheapen the price, knowing full well the adoption of EVs in China is going to be absolutely tremendous. In the next few weeks, you'll see filings by many hedge funds that have picked up millions of shares of XPEV and NIO. Every MM knows 5-10x upside to both of these stocks, as they both had great earnings this quarter with plenty of cash on hand, higher deliveries every month, and increased revenue. The entire market moved in sync today to bring down the prices as overblown fear was the catalyst, but the VIX sunk more than everything. People have liquidated from crypto and that money is going to also enter the stock market after learning how a couple of viral tweets doesn't just fly you to the moon, but can also bring you crashing down even quicker. Tech stocks have been overly punished in general. XPEV specifically had even indicated today they had already taken steps to allocate parts to minimize any disruption to production. Recent delivery numbers prove that XPEV is achieving that goal. EV stocks will come back very strong and these prices are a gift for all those that have been looking for a long entry. Blood is in the streets. Every hedge fund is buying. So should you. Keep buying. Keep holding. Until 2025+."

tesla got new supplier for chip & will be ahead of the game as musk always been...news will come in 1st week of May after earnings of other auto makers...this is buy time...
"All EV tech stocks are down; no individual fundamental has changed for any of these companies. $NIO, $XPEV, $TSLA are all on the same sentiment due to institutional moves to manipulate prices for huge discounts. Keep buying the 50+% discount you have been given in this past few months. Rest of the year is going to be the recovery of supply chains and continued growing. Keep buying. Keep holding for 5+ years."
$750 tomorrow
money must be withdrawn from here as quickly as from an ATM machine
Is TSLA down so much because of that crash or because they own so much BitCoin that has been dropping so precipitously lately?

Can someone please tell me how Tesla gets high marks for “governance” on the ESG scorecard. Musk and the rest of the Tesla board shows the antithesis of good governance. I also think his disdain for safety of workers and customers are bad marks on “social.”
"This is NVTA and PACB: Question: Simon - what do u think of the NGS company Jason has gone to ? Would it’s acquisition by $NVTA make $NVTA fully vertically integrated, like $TSLA? Is that the missing link for a run away winner in the Diagnostics/monitoring space ?Simon answers: I don't follow GenapSys too closely, but I imagine they could eat away at the low-throughput end of NGS if everything goes to plan. I'm not certain Illumina focuses too heavily on that part of its portfolio. Invitae already is fairly vertically integrated, however ...... as far as hardware is concerned, prenatal screening is migrating to Singular Bio instruments, a company Invitae bought in 2019. For the main sequencing cluster, I would guess that most of it moves to HiFi sequencing in the coming years. While that certainly isn't full ..... vertical integration, Invitae will receive preferential economics for ~5 years given the nature of its agreement with PacBio."
"Whatever the earnings are, 59ct, 68ct, 90ct ... everything below 10 USD is pain money-"

Tezzzzla will see $850 by the earnings day
"trades like a tech stock, reality is they build cars...and not yet profitably."
TSLA will go down at Market open and shoots backup causing a short squeezing. Tomorrow will be a big jump up for TSLA and lots of shorts will burn & loose tones of money. This is a classic move that keeps repeating over the years. Mark my words.
Come on baby 
Should be worth over thousand dollar stock price
Bitcoin crash right before Tesla’s earning. Looks like institutions want to pump Tesla to $1000 with leverage!
"can Tesla make it against the oncoming onslaught of E cars from BMW, M.Benz, GM, Ford , Chrysler, Volvo and others? Can they maintain this expulsive share price when they essentially make little profit? I hope so but have doubts!"
SHORTS SQUEEZE going on!!! We want the $40 Billion Squeeze too!
Musk makes 2500 dollars for every Tesla sold. Toyotas CEO makes like 50 cents off it.Thats what you call a ponzi scheme lol
So if the president endorses a electric truck does that qualify for an SEC investigation? Or at least a share holder law suit? F doesn’t have enough of those to be an “EV” company yet.

YTD return -2.5%. Sign of a big correction
TSLA PE 1173!? Selling cars at a loss! Is that a good investment?
At 568 this thing drops to 388 and everyone knows it . The rush for the door will be small and I'm sure the stock will be halted as the big guys get out .

"Instead of a 2-for-1 sale, Tesla apparently had a 1-for-2 sale last month."

"ARKK was right on the price target they issued in 2018, but they were dead wrong on why? The $5,000.

"Ark and Cathie will continue to sell more and more of their TESLA holdingsas TESLA shares continue to rise. They regulate their ETFs with buying/selling asso that no single company in their ETFs account for more than 10% of the total ETF.This is very smart. They have allowed TESLA to go over 10% for short periods of timebecause TESLA's upward moves are so fast. TESLA often moves up $50+ dollars in one dayand then pulls back some. With excellent earnings probable in one week, ARK mightbe anticipating dramatic moves upward. This is all in my informed opinion and I could be wrong."
"$800 billion market cap for 800,000-900,000 cars to be produced in 2021. I’m sure it’s gonna work out for longs who got into Tesla so late in the game"
What is wrong with Tesla stock folks...???
this is going to be awesome tomorrow $45 up
"Musk's ""Full Self-Driving"" fraud turns deadly....again. Remember how Mobile-Eye explained (years ago) that Tesla was being reckless with the technology when they broke off working with them toward FSD technology -- they didn't want to be associated with this sort of headline when Tesla's recklessness turns deadly."

tesla seems to have strong support at 700$ it's been bouncing between 700$ and 750$ for a month now
"The tractor was equipped with several standard safety features. Namely, the tractor had a seat contact switch (“dead man’s switch”), which was located between the seat suspension and the seat frame. This switch prevents engine startup/running when the seat is unoccupied. Additionally, the tractor was equipped with both a clutch safety switch and a neutral safety switch, which requires the clutch to be disengaged and the transmission to be in the neutral position for the engine to start.Examination of the tractor after the accident revealed that all three of these safety devices had been electrically bypassed, or “shorted,” at some time prior to the incident. This was the result of a “jumper” wire installed across the two wires associated with each switch. A jumper tricks the tractor into thinking that the seat is occupied, the transmission is in neutral, and the clutch is depressed when, in fact, those things may not be true. These conditions prevented the safety devices from functioning properly, allowing the tractor to start and continue running while unattended. Witnesses familiar with the operator indicated that he routinely started the tractor as he stood beside it, placing him squarely in front of the large, left-rear tire. While it was unclear who had performed the modification, the tractor was able to start while the operator stood beside it, and apparently the operator was aware of this fact.On the morning of the accident, the operator started the tractor in his usual fashion but neglected to ensure that the transmission had been placed in the neutral position. The tractor started and lurched forward, and the operator was consequentially crushed as the left rear wheel drove over him followed by the pull-behind mower. The mower deck trapped and dragged the operator as the tractor continued to move forward unattended through the parking lot before impacting a parked vehicle. Coworkers found him unconscious and fatally injured.Moral is people bypass safety switches all the time and cause injury or death...it is not a machine issue...it is a people issue."
Tesla is in for a world of hurt!!!!
TSLA back to $600 this Friday!
"Bad bad news for $tsla. Sinopec, the gas station giant in China with 35000 stations decided against $Tsla after failed speakings and for $NIO, to bomb  whole china with NIO swapping stations and charging stations."

"Tomorrow Tesla will fly,, see if you can catch up with it..."

"”believed to be driverless” this is a just an assumption. In my opinion its very hard to tell what happened to the body during the crash and if their even able to detect the body after the car has been burning for 4 hours. This is a sad story but if its believed to be true you would be wreck less to not be behind the wheel even if its on autopilot. Who knows maybe their is a third person behind the wheel? That they weren’t able to detect because of the fire. And if their was a third person it will be hard to assume autopilot was on, as we all know autopilot is extra cautious on the road when it comes to speed. Nonetheless their should be someone behind the wheel With autopilot."
"Tesla revenue per share 7% up in the last two years. Share price, 20 TIMES. Dillution took your money bulls and you won't get it back."

Hello there. The markets are shaky right now and a crash could be imminent. Do you know where to put your cash? go to (http://Pick-stocks.com).
...Can't wait til Monday. Can we see $750?
Tesla is a car company and nothing else. 95 percent of revenue from car sales. FSD is a scam and will be taught in fraud classes in 10 years. This stock is over valued
Meh...it's normalized...I can sleep well owning it.Very impressive
"Tomorrow Tesla will close at 641.54 $, -4,76%."
"This is WAY overvaluedAll ""earnings"" were from 503 Million environmental credits and bitcoin."
"Hey Elon, focus on your company instead of doge, btc, etc."
"I have sold all my Tesla shares. Too hot.Sales numbers were disappointing, a hype for bad numbers and earnings will be impact negativ MASSIVLY because auf price cuts and less sales of models s and Model x."
Might be appropriate to say that Cathie is losing her bra on Coin.
Check my Energy math: Just replacing gasoline never mind diesel and heating oil requires electrical grid to more than double in capacity. Where is the plan to do that considering it takes 10y to bring that scale online?California Gasoline usage 2015=15 Billion gal X 33.7KWH/gal=506 TWH.California Electricity use.. 2015=295.4 TWH.California has brownouts NOW. Where do they imagine they are going to double their grid?
"You don't understand what you are invested in if you are wondering why it is dropping. It is hard get your head around just how overvalued TSLA is trading . Yes the earnings were good if it was trading at 50 to 60 dollars. It's not . These sequential reports although improving are not enough. AOL, Blackberry were leaders once too at lofty valuations. You don't know what is about to hit you if you are long the next few years. The easy money to overhyped levels is over."

"FSD? Full Self Driving? Seriously? Tesla needs a better marketing department. Surprised that Model X doesn't market SOD (Self Opening Doors), or SUF on the Model Y (Storage Up Front). FSD just seems to be weak, not to mention, it's a misnomer."
"The price drops are all across the markets. Hopefully after the Fed meeting today, the markets will turn around and go back up. Don't panic and buy into the weakness."

So..............where are all the upgrades AFTER record quarter ?
This company makes money off anything but automobiles lmao
"after tax credit and bitcoin profits, TESLA made $0 dollars for the quarter."
Do you think we will be positive tomorrow like today?
Hope you guys closed your short positions today. Watch what happens tomorrow
Expect big sell off in Tesla tomorrow from crypto investors who are rightfully angry about the Bitcoin tweet. Questioning my Musk fanhood right now to be honest - that was wildly irresponsible and damaging to the very investors who are helping his company grow
Who is buying? Steep downward trend for 4 months. Why would anyone think this is the magical week when Tesla bottoms out? More clear than ever that this is a $100 stock.
ARK is closing positions in Tesla. total catastrophe now.
"Tesla owners love their cars a lot. Their views of CEO Elon Musk are much more nuanced, according to results of a survey by research group Escalent.Tesla's one-stop shopping for everything from financing to fast charging is a huge plus for the brand, the firm said, and it's one GM and Ford may not be able to replicate.Most people in the auto industry assume Tesla buyers are drawn to the brand's high-tech image. The real reason is simpler, and far more traditional: They like the cars. The results showed that Tesla vehicles appeal to both EV owners and those who intend to buy an electric car within five years. Their reasons are similar to what automakers hope for when launching any new product, whatever it's powered by. EV owners and intenders saw Teslas as alluring for their styling, performance and acceleration, build quality, and the fact that they're new and different. Battery range was the sole attribute among the top five named that is specific to electric cars.The study contains many other nuggets about Tesla and how it's viewed. Its youth as a company is of little concern, and in fact most respondents saw it as a positive. Because the company is fully committed to EVs, ""there's nothing close to it,"" said one participant.And Tesla's Apple-like “one-stop experience” proved a huge plus for owners. Its ability to manage all aspects of EV purchase and ownership—sales, financing, service, fast charging, and route planning that incorporates fast charging—were cited by an overwhelming 91 percent of owners as a reason to buy another Tesla. That, Dovorany suggested, is an ecosystem traditional makers will struggle mightily to replicate.Finally, getting people behind the wheel of an EV was widely seen as the best single way to convince shoppers that the cars were real and could work for them. Many owners reported they became much more open to buying an EV after knowing friends, family, or co-workers who had one. https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35797034/survey-tesla-buyers-not-musk-fans/"

"Death Cross coming to Tesla this summer. With 200 day moving average rising rapidly, the 50 day moving average falling and a low of 539 printed in March we know late spring and early summer will bring Tesla some bearish events. The first is Tesla will trade below its 200 dma which is rising about $2.50 per day. The 200 dma is 565 and it will continue to rise. With the volatility of Tesla, it could fall to 565 tomorrow or next week. Some time in May is easily possible. 50 dma is 687, trending downward, falling around $2 per day and over 100 dollars below its high in March. June will very likely bring a death cross. Hard to deny a bear market at that point. Longs, you are in trouble."
"Cannacord analyst Jonathan Dorsheimer upgraded shares to Buy and took his target from $419 all the way up to $1,071."
"Can somebody give me one reason why Tesla price will grow in the future. One reason? Considering that the actual stock valuation currently is around $170, and every world big automaker is already making EVs. And Tesla is currently the most overvalued stock on NASDQ. Give me one reason to buy Tesla. Please one reason???"
I like Elon he is so nice and cute like the Beatles.
I'm selling Tesla now. The German factory got delay while earlier on catching quite bad publicity in China
Try again shorts. Lmao.
"Traditional automakers with decades—or more than a century of history, in some cases—are investing aggressively in EV and autonomous technology. GM and Ford alone are throwing $27 billion and $29 billion, respectively, at EV and AV technology by mid-decade. GM plans to introduce 30 new EVs globally by 2025, with Ford also expected to offer 30 of its own EVs by the middle of the decade.Another problem that can't be swept under the rug with the Tesla buy thesis is its income statements. Even though it reported its first full-year profit in 2020, it was only profitable because it sold regulatory emission credits to other automakers. In all four quarters of 2020, Tesla would have reported a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) loss without its regulatory credits. When a $703 billion company hasn't even shown the ability to generate a GAAP profit from selling its core product, warning flags should be going off in your head. The final worry is that all next-big-thing investment bubbles eventually burst. For more than a quarter of a century, we've watched as the internet, genomics, business-to-business commerce, marijuana, 3D-printing, blockchain, and a host of other major trends all soared and eventually burst. This doesn't mean we didn't see winners emerge from these next-big-thing trends; but it does show that investor expectations for new technology pretty much always exceeds reality."
Brake failed again and again at low speed. Countless surveillance videos from China have proved it.
I see Elon being forced out as CEO soon. He has a big mouth and it is really hurting the companies image.

"Tesla's problem is ""exaggeration"" of FSD & Autopilot to a potential criminal level. The issue is a whole sale miss-leading of potential & Tesla owners by claims of performance they can expect through their understanding of Tesla's use of language: ie. Full Self Driving = FSD = {BUT}not at all safe. Tesla's Autopilot is also proving that it is not at all safe to take your hands of the wheel. Hyperbole is where Tesla and the Bull Media machine live, the question is ""can Tesla now be charged for misleading people about their cars autonomous capabilities ? expect court challenges. Also Considering Tesla charged $10k for the FSD package, something that doesn't work, is another existential risk to investors and opened Tesla up to a class action lawsuit. I'm not a bear and I love Elon and his vision, but I'm not a fool either."
"I will not sell a single share unless the company declares bankruptcy. Looking at their last financial statements, that seems quite impossible, therefore not selling. All this talk about value and inflation will not make me give you my shares so you can make money and not me! In my coffin, I’ll be holding on to my $TSLA shares."
Collapsing in AH now lol. Told ya so.
"There are not just opinions and shareprices, there is also a real world.In the region of the gigafactory Berlin in Brandenburg, they had the three hottest and dryest summers in recorded history. Along comes Elon, plans a Gigafactory, and the communities tell him: We don't have enough water.As he came for a visit, he really said: ""I see trees, so you have enough water."" The gigafactory is still not yet aproved, but he builds it anyway, and has spent 5,8 billion Euros so far. The communities tried to secure the water he needed, planed new watergrids, and he comes and says: ""Well, I need four times more water.""Now they are looking for any watersource outside the Brandenburg region, projects to build new waterpipes for hundreds of millions of Euros. A free gift from the communities in hope for new jobs.And he is still building the gigafactory with no permission. And still nobody knows, where the water in high quantities should come from.And all we hear from Elon is: ""No problem. I will walk over water, even if there is no water left. I will hover anyway."""
Wow amazing. Any positive comment I make gets deleted. Interesting.
"Eh, selling is over. buyers coming in. Im buying"
So to make it simple. Elon Musk is going to launch a Tesla crypto vallet in each car to support dogecoin payments. Tesla has probably already bought some coins to then again sell for the Tesla owners. You can use the coin for both recharging and in the future for Tesla taxi network. Information is coming out probably 4/20. Case closed. Long Doge. $TSLA
cathie sold tesla and guess what she bought... coinbase... jesus... she has to be getting paid to pump her ark trades for people to jump in
"Elon Musk, always the good sport, has intentionally delayed Berlin 6 months, so that all the other European OEMs can catch up. Elon has always insisted on an even playing field, so all companies can compete fairly, and are all treated exactly the same. His record of rejecting Tesla biased regulatory and legislative advantages speaks for itself of his selfishness. Elon wants to dominate the world's automotive sector, but wants it to be a fair fight, sweeter the victory. That Musk fella seems like a fine chap."

"In Europe, the Tesla share continues to fall unchecked into the bottomless pit.Tesla's market share is falling just as fast here, as the old manufacturers are now bringing technically real cars onto the market in series and are leaving the Tesla early EVs far behind.The European factory will be completed with an eternal delay, if at all. Because of Elon's bossy slave driver mentality Tesla can't find enough workers here. Once the factory is operational, it will no longer be needed because people will want real electric cars from the established manufacturers.Dead Cat Bounce is done...."

"Just received ANOTHER request from ANOTHER new EV start up, for exterior design support (That's what I do) for ANOTHER ""game changing"" vehicle. No details to share (NDA). The EV revolution has been a boom to my business, since the desire is for these vehicles to appear completely new, requiring total redesign (lots of billable hours). You can't put a battery in an existing chassis/body, and expect the public to embrace, even though that's what the first Roadster was. Next couple of years are going to be extremely busy, and in an odd way, I have Elon Musk mostly to thank, whom I totally disdain. Definition of irony."

"People are kidding themselves when they try to use Facebook and Amazon as historical examples to shrug off the extreme high P/E ratio of Tesla. Facebook and Amazon are practically monopolies in their respective industries and require relatively little capital for growth, while the auto industry is the complete opposite... extremely competitive market divided into ever smaller shares between fierce competitors, with very high capital requirements for growth and revised car models every few years. This is basic stuff but the fanboys don't get it. And, don't respond with the boilerplate comeback ""but its a tech company not a car company"" when 95% of revenue today is from car sales.... we can have that debate, but tesla is not leading in FSD either..."

Easy $ from TSLA. As always shorted it before the news. Consistently happening with TSLA. He he he

"I would like to know the breakdown. How many of those vehicles were delivered in the United States versus China to determine the company's rate of growth in the U.S.? Ultimately, it was a good qtr for Tesla, but not shattering to justify its obscene P/E Ratio of 983.07x. Furthermore, the original delivery numbers by analysts were originally higher. However, Wall Street lowered the number due to chip shortages. Had the analysts kept their original estimates, Tesla's delivery numbers would have fell short. imo Therefore, sell the news on Monday as these insanely overvalued companies continue to deflate.monday will be SELL THE NEWS DAY"
The definition of “shorting” is not in the dictionary of Tesla anymore
TSLA has a history of dropping after earnings. Buy on dip. This stock will be $1000 by end of year.
Catie probably will only hold TSLA and COIN in the end..
So what happened to the competition was coming in hard and eating away at Tesla’s sales? I had to listen to that all quarter.

"There will never be a stand-alone solution to the full self-driving problem. It will require the cooperation of all manufacturers to be able to solve this problem.To think that only one company could come up with a viable solution while all others are excluded is foolish.Eventually everyone must agree on standards. If you produce a full self driving vehicle it must be equipped with a minimum sensor suite and most likely some sort of device like a transponder in an airplane that will continuously transmit your vehicle type, speed, direction, intentions, and so forth to other vehicles in the immediate vicinity.Anyone or anything else operating on the same roads or in the same area should also be equipped with a device that identifies and therefore protects them from being run over.How many of the accidents that Tesla has been involved with to date could have been prevented if transponder technology had been implemented.?"
"Too many credits, no more charity profits, Bitcoin to zero, Tesla to sub $300 easy during macro correction. Then you will be too broke to take advantage of opportunities.Same ole story."
"The year usually starts slow, and production of Model S/X was down for upgrades. It will only get better from here. Q2 and Q3 will crush Q1 as business picks up and Model S/X refresh become available. Q4 will include two new factories, and the start of production for the cyber truck and semi. Next year will be even bigger as new factories continue to ramp up production. Giga Berlin will begin production of batteries in what will probably be the largest battery factory in the world. That will help allow Tesla to double the deliveries again, and continue to pull ahead of the competition. Tesla vehicles will no longer have to be imported into Europe, and Tesla's increased production combined with EV tax credits will drive sales higher in the US.FSD will be a game changer. There's a lot more profit margin in software, and no competition. Perhaps this is why bears desperately try to dismiss it as something that will never happen.The future belongs to Tesla. Everybody else is fighting for 2nd place."

"TSLA in the mid $700s is a bargain. All the naysayers are speculating based on a whole raft of special interest that need to see it fall. GM this, Ford that. Who cares? They are “burning” billions tomake up for dragging their feet on electrification. No one is as far along with EV’s quality, meeting environmental standards, charging network, safety, affordability, performance, autonomy, technical innovation and cost cutting than Tesla. IMO Tesla doesn’t want to outperform the legacies BEV production, just edge them faster into the 21st century. A good part of TSLA share value is the potential of all the other phases of this enterprise. Anyone of them could exceed profitably much higher than EVs."
Shorts are covering. They took it down to shake out the weak hands and the stop-losses. Now we climb.

Even then it is still overvalued, but at least it's getting closer to where it belongs. It will also take a while for the big players to unwind their holdings"

"Interesting valuation trend for assets ..Bitcoin and other crypto's now reaching $2 trillion valuation as compared to all the farmland and buildings in America at $2.7 trillion. There is an unlimited supply of crypto currencies and but little new productive farmland is being created. Tesla is valued at 1000 PE yet the majority of their available models are in multiyear sales decline. The fed is pumping Trillions into the economy and inflation is ramping up in response. Highly leveraged hedge funds are flirting with disastrous margin calls . Pent up demand, pandemic relief are lining up for a roaring 20's set up similar to the 1920's explosion following the 1918 Spanish flue pandemic. Hold on to your horses, things are getting weird. Renewable power generation is now touching 20% of all the power generated in the USA, yet there is a belief of much higher proportions . The EIA shows 20% Nuclear, 20% combined wind, hydro, and utility solar withe the remainder of grid power from fossil fuels. Coal still accounts for over 20% of the power produced in the USA. Make no mistake this is changing and the rate of change is increasing, but we are not there yet. The move to EV's will enable integration of wide ranging power storage options as a smart grid. The next 10 years will be very interesting. Is another world war on the horizon, is it bliss and progress, civil war due to left and right wingnuts or will the center majority emerge and engage to rein in the wingers........... Will Tesla earn its valuation or be re-priced. You tell me?"

"Tesla robotaxi revenueRobo taxi means level 5 autonomy.

$400 by September. Madness without a clear profitable direction and business in China is drying up faster than my wi fe. lol !
"Shorts probably don't pay attention to things like volume. The amount of volume present when TSLA sold off the 900s down to the upper 500s was very weak compared to the volume present prior to early February when the stock was rallying like mad. Other things dampening the bear case is that the short interest is dramatically lower in TSLA than prior to the pandemic. Back to the volume...these are weak hands that are selling, not the big boys and institutions. I will only get concerned when the big institutional ownership of TSLA dramatically drops. This is why you need to be buying the dip here, not increasing your short position. There is not strong conviction to this selling at all. Don't let all the bears in this chat scare you out of making a huge amount of money. Nobody with a brain dumps their life savings into betting this will crash. Anyone with an understanding of this company and the size of its total addressable market knows that the current prices are a bargain."

"Within the last days of last week, ARK Invest has bought 103'952 shares of Tesla.They are still buying this stock, although Tesla represents now 11,03% of the ARK fund. Above the limit of 10% per company."
"So which is worse: 1. Tesla crashes into tree while on FSD with ""driver"" relaxing in back seat? or2. Occupants burn to death after Tesla crashes into a tree because they are unable to get doors open. Driver desperately climbs into back seat to try rear doors.Hmm. I think the trial lawyer like the second better. Think of the pain and suffering damages for two men struggling to get out and burning to death?"
So Stellantis don't need to buy EV credits off Tesla any more? What proportion of EV credits come from Stellantis? And does this mean no more profits for Tesla?
How did the police conclude autopilot was enabled if the passengers were dead? LOL is this a short news plant
"FCA was one of Tesla's biggest customers. The former Italian-American automaker has spent roughly 2 billion euros, or $2.4 billion, to buy European and U.S. credits from Tesla since 2019. But that cash transfer will soon end, thanks to the electric-vehicle technology that PSA, the parent company of French brands Peugeot and Citroën and Germany's Opel, brought to the merger. It was not immediately clear how Stellantis's decision to end the deal will affect Tesla. But auto investors should note that without the income it generated from selling tax credits to Stellantis and others, Tesla would have posted losses in each of the six most recent quarters, including the first quarter of 2021."
I think today is bad day for tesla Red
"It's funny to hear ppl talk about a squeeze lol. There is no squeeze here children. If you're holding, you're sitting on the largest stock bubble in human history. That is by definition the opposite of a squeeze."
"Tesla Sales In China Are ""Doomed"" For A ""Sharp Fall"" In The Second Quarter, Global Times SaysThe next chapter in the ""China vs. Elon Musk"" saga looks like it could be ready to begin - and, indeed, it looks like Tesla's honeymoon in China could be over. The Global Times, China's closest major media organization to the state, published a scathing review of Tesla's earnings on Tuesday morning, stating that ""despite record earnings"" for the quarter, ""Tesla's sales in China are expected to drop sharply in the coming months due to a public relations crisis that has put the image of the otherwise popular brand at serious risk"".""...sales in China are doomed to experience a sharp fall in the second quarter,"" the report read.https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/tesla-sales-china-are-doomed-sharp-fall-second-quarter-global-times-says"
"Just promise me shorts that you will save enough money to pay your internet bill, I think I'll miss you guys when Tesla rebounds."
"Elon, we don’t need you. #btccommunity"
$800 with earning report 
Elon's irresponsible comments about bitcoin have caused people around the world to lose billions of dollars! There are a lot of #$%$ off people out there right now. I foresee even more short sellers taking their revenge on Tesla.
"Despite chip shortage, Tesla still made a record delivery for the quarter.What does that tell you about Tesla and their commitments to be the best in the World??? Remember...Elon hates Shorts to the guts and will make them lose BILLIONS OF DOLLARS MORE!"
"First quarter was a good quarter for the auto manufacturers. GM earned over $2/share and expects total 2021 earnings around $11 billion. It's interesting that little (just $300 million) of GM's profit came from China. The reality is that China just won't let a US company make a lot of money in China. If TSLA fans think TSLA is going to ever pull real profits out of China, they are likely to be disappointed.GM with $11 billion of expected 2021 earnings has a market cap of $80 billion.TSLA which might make $10 billion in earnings in 2023 (if it can successfully expand production and sell 5 million vehicles, 10 times its 2020 numbers) has a market cap of over $650 billion.Can you see why TSLA might be seen as over priced. It has to achieve 10 times 2020 performance to be still priced 10 times higher relative to earnings that GM makes now."
PLEASE LISTEN TODAY RIGHT NOW IS TRULY A GIFT TO GET IN RIGHT HERE THIS IS ABOUT TO LAUNCH TODAY  GREAT PRICE TO BUY
come on man I was hoping for $780
"As usual, shorts are losing big time today."
TSLA will replaced in the S&P by GameStop
"Why you Shorts fight against the man who will take our Astronauts to the moon, stars and beyond?"
HELP HELP !! Cops: Nobody was behind wheel of TESLA involved in fatal crash!
https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380057/tesla-solar-roof-price-increase-contract-amountTesla is burning its customers. Prices increased on solar roofs between 70% and 100%. I guess it doesn't matter to $TSLA because that revenue is only 1%.
Elon Musk taking the market and crypto with it.Watch this sink further than you can imagine.
Cannot believe I sold
The Bears own negative evaluations and thoughts are having them miss out on the beginning of a new industry and a lot of money.
"Shorts still dreaming of seeing $400 again on TSLA. Won’t happen. Shorts have loss so much on TSLA they will never recover.Also, pick up some RH. RH is low float rocket, has less outstanding than CMG, huge institutional support, and Buffet is an investor. RH going much higher."
"Whenever analysts make wild claims like $3000 a share, it always seems like that signals a top.In addition, with the Ford Mustang stealing share and GM and the German automakers ramping up, I don't see how Tesla sales will increase. I don't short stocks. I am a Ford shareholder, but not a lot. Just trying to be an objective observer."
"TSLA 750 today. I hear 1200-1300 by April30. Classic. AMZN, AAPL earning is coming by end of April too. These 3 unicorns has to correct huge this month. Hedgies game is ending. Buy before they cover"

Really good support at $600.
"One of these days we are going to hear about Musk being investigated (well he would probably be right now if we actually had a real DOJ). Believe me this stock is not worth 40 bucks. Wait until the avalanche of eVs coming out of Europe, Japan and Korea"
Musk very smart sell BITCOIN to cook the book without selling BITCOIN JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman said earnings before interest and taxes were worse than expected.
Tesla has not made money selling cars since it started.
Bargain price. Buy buy buy
Kathy wood is probably putting puts on her own ETF
Why do traditional auto companies trade at under 20x earnings and a slither of Tesla’s valuation? Is it perhaps because over time competition has meant that margins are squeezed and profitability is rationalised. I can’t understand why the bulls don’t see that Tesla are selling cars...
Tesla was pinned down all day long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn1Nm8IYvBM
Still laughing at shorts who thought it was going down today.
Down over 38% from its high 3 months ago. Can anyone actually still believe that TSLA continues to be a viable company?
"Say what you want Shorts but reality speaks for itself.When I drive around I see about 10 Tesla to 1 other EV like Toyota Prius. I have not seen Ford or VW EV yet. I try to put in order for model Y last Sunday and the wait list for delivery is 3 months out. Also, everyone I talked to is waiting for infrastructure bill to pass so they can leverage $10k EV credits. My friends are on long waiting list for the Truck and that will be a bonus when it comes out.That’s the reality and what we can expect Q2 numbers will look like. It’s going to be a huge year for Tesla."
No worries TEZOMBIES soon you will become TESLANAIRES!
What has Elon ever achieved?Is Telsa at the start of their endeavor? Will revenue grow at Tesla?
"GM gets deal for 4000 robo-taxi's in Dubai, first country to allow FSD deal outside the US. The fact that this did not go to Tesla should be a concern for bull analysts 'sunny ways' future projections and retail investor enthusiasm as one of Tesla most predicted profit streams crucial to the companies valuation is under threat. That's how you predict this is going down, Let's start speaking the Truth about Tesla's robo taxis aspirations, that being they are ill prepared. I predict class action law suits against Tesla if they doesn't come up with a working FSD system soon (as they charged hundred of thousands $10,000 in advance.)"

"$21 trq earnings more than $580 tesla, cooper used by evs is 5x the level of gas guzzlers, trq near new high"
What Tesla longs forget is just how super overvalued the company is. Even it were to be producing as many cars as Volkswagen.
$SPCE $5 billion - 0 flights; $NKLA $5 billion - 0 cars; $TSLA $565 billion - 0 operating profit; $BTC-USD $775 billion - 0 use
Elon musk really messed this up 
"TSLA eyeing either $plug $fcel or $blnk ? stay tuned! Eyes on ACRX too, milestones coming up, & note:500% +/- UPSIDE now: March 16, 2021ACELRX (ACRX) GETS A BUY RATING FROM H.C. WAINWRIGHT (FOUNDED in 1868)March 16, 2021H.C. Wainwright maintained a Buy rating set a price target of $7.00."

Wait for the GM and Toyota results and do your benchmarks.
"Below is a direct quote/recording of Elon on January investors call...""Regarding the new Model S and X, we are launching the -- we're super excited to announce the new Model S and Model X are in production now and will be delivered in February. So we've been able to bring forward the Plaid, Model S and X. And Model S will be delivered in February and X a little later. The Model S Plaid, and we're actually in production now, and we'll be delivering next month.""Tesla 8-K file with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows that no Model S or X vehicles were produced during the quarter!If this is not openly and blatantly lying than I don’t know what is... but as so many times in history doesn’t matter how many times your catch the leader lying the disciples will not allow it their brains to process the information."
"For those deceived by the anti-TESLA media propaganda, I strongly advise them to check out the progress on TESLA""s factories at GigaShanghai 2, GigaBerlin, GigaTexas, expansion at Fremong and Nevada. New competitive and superior TESLA products should be rolling out within the next 3 months. These new Gigafactories will be the most efficient factories in the world putting out superior products that will be selling at prices where competitors will have a very hard time competing on price and quality."
This is going to be unstoppable from this moment

"TESLA PE = 1165 todayTESLA PE after earnings(annualized) = 90 That's a 1300% improvement. With three megfactories coming on line in late 2021 and 2022,Tesla's production and sales should more than double by the end of 2022 and their PE (using today's share price of 740) should fall to between 10-30). What do you think will happen to the share price and PE of TESLA growing at some 50% to 100% annually for the next 5 years?Their PE could be back up to 80-100 and their share price should quadruple. This would mean the price of TESLA shares should be around 2800-3000. This is ARK's projection. Many things could go wrong but this is the best projection given the available data today. Only God knows the future. We can only project from available data."

"What did I say about the people who sold under 700? So predictable. Buy low, shove in a drawer somewhere, go spend time with family, look at it down the road, acquire gains."
"People are buying $ALYI like a Mutual Fund. The company has its hands in Zoomcar, IQST, EV Motorcycles, Cryptocurrency etc.. 400k share chunks being bought right now.

"That was an incredible earning report:1. Gross margin of making EVs was 26.5%. Show me another ‘car’ maker with this kind of margin. I know GM was making Chevy Bolt at a loss. And someone can verify Mach E’s margin, but I know it’s not 26.5% gross margin.2. Just like most oil companies hedging with energy futures. Tesla has a good investment mind. It outperformed many of the famed hedge funds’ performance for the 1st qtr. I think they should have a small investment team focusing on creating returns for its gigantic cash reserve. Why not?3. The cash flow from operations was enough to fund the constructions and growths of its giga factories all over the world, they did not have to touch any of the cash for new build out. Isn’t this incredible.4. TSLA has the capacity to build 1 million EVs in 2021, but it did not commit on more than just a 50%growth for 2021. I think it does that to later surprise Wall Street with better numbers. Setting the TSLA stock for hyper growth for the rest of the year.I am excited for TSLA’s prospect as a company and an investment going forward. Good luck everyone!"
Back under 600 soon
"Ok, all you Musk-eteers .."".Do you Feel Lucky"" Now"

Doesn't matter just print it until the dollar is no longer reserve currency. That might buy another year or two."
keep bring it short! i need $500 share
"If prospects for TSLA were so great (relative to its stock price), why are insiders consistently selling?When they exercise an option for say 10,000 shares, why don't they keep some instead of selling all immediately? Is it because they are trying to have a large taxable income and so pay more taxes to help pay for all the new give away programs? Or, could they possibly fear that the stock will tank?"
"Tesla brushes off shortages and rivals, and delivers a record breaking 185,000 vehicles. Eat it bears."

Then the wild ride began. By the time the contract was drawn up on May 8, the 160,000 dogecoins were worth $116,000 (or around $0.72 per digital coin) — meaning the seller of the land was up big on the deal."

"As as wrote earlier, her price target has got nothing to do with anything else than the “Endowment Effect.” It’s the tendency to ascribe a higher value — or higher returns — to assets you already own compared to investments that you don’t. If you own an investment, you often overemphasise its potential benefits while ignoring or downplaying its potential risks.I invite you all to an experiment. Sell your shares in Tesla if you have and buy them back, heck not even the day after but 2 hours later. But during this 2 hours objectively consider your investment you are about to make and what really motivates you to jump on that trade. Would be interesting to see how many of you honestly and objectively consider the pro's and con's and how many would actually start to feel liberated from Elons cult."

"GigaShanghai 2 going into production this quarter.GigaNevada begins production of cybertrucks next quarter.Take any downward actions as an opportunity to positioned yourselves before earnings.GigaBerlin begins production in July.GigaTexas begins production in October.Fremont 4680 battery production ramping up in 3rd and 4th quarters.Tesla Battery storage and Battery Utility revenues exploding upwards.I expect first quarter earnings, revenues, margins and free cash flow to beat handsomely."
knew the squeeze coming today judging by the amount of weekly OTM puts short were hoarding yesterday..
"Tesla and a slew of other overvalued ""momentum stocks"" led the NASDAQ up; now they will lead it down....way down."
Buy and HOLD!!
$700.00We will close
"Tesla is valued as if it's going to conquer whole automotive industry. It's clearly not the case, Tesla is already losing BEV market share in Europe, because guess what, european OEMs have a lots of very good EV models out there already.Tesla has massive problems in China due to US x China relationship. It's obvious that China will protect Nio and Xpeng and Tesla will be losing their market share in future.Tesla isn't ahead in autonomous driving. While Waymo doesn't have as much collected data, they have virtual maps and tons of machine learning hours done in simulation. Also MobilEye has probably more data collected than Tesla.You claim that Tesla has secured their battery future, yet they are the company that doesn't seem to be engaged in solid state battery research. VW has $QS, Ford + BMW got stake in Solid Power, Toyota has joint venture with Panasonic... SSB are the future and missing on this technology could be extremely damning for Tesla. Also Tesla's R&D budget is still just a fraction of R&D budgets of big OEMs.Lucid is behind the corner looking to take a crown as a EV technology leader. Apple is about to enter the EV market targeting the same type of customers as Tesla. Tesla keeps delaying Cybertruck and will very likely miss out on the US's most important market - losing ground to Rivian, $Ride, Ford...Tesla has still enormous built quality issues and is viewed as poorly made car by many car enthusiasts."
Company value. 706billionEarnings. 10billionIf you can't see the problem you are part of it.
"Lots of news coming in the next few weeks. If any of it happens to be good, that would be bad for shorts. New support is around $585, and based on the bounce this morning it's a strong one."
"If the entire Tesla profit were paid out as a dividend, that would be 0.15% for the shareholders, whereas CEO Elon Musk qualifies for $11 billion options payout.If you look at this ratio, you will understand why the Tesla share has long since passed its zenith and has become in 2021 a Nasdaq underperformer."

Tesla investors should switch to fuelcell and hydrogen companies as low priced Bloom Energy and Ballard Power.....Eventually - my guess - Apple enters the market in 2024 with a fuelcell-hybrid car...well...battery is good for short distance but hydrogen for the long run....
Now that’sa breakdown. Looks like a great buying opportunity at some point. At this point i would rather miss buying the bottom then trying to catch a falling knife. My gut tells me a buy signal is a ways off. I’m curious how support works at the post split level.
Tesla dry electrode is coming sooner. Do not sell
"solid support at 400 USD,"
Can’t break 600 no one wants to pay that for Tesla. Green before open red after.
"Don't let the shorts get to you, hold on to your shares. 3000 per share by 2025!"

Where is analysts who has a $60 target? He should go back to school.

Last time you see 750$ 1000$ next
About 17000 car crashes per day in the us. If you watch the news media you’d think crashes only involve Tesla cars
The first and the most important question is about possibility of moving without driver. Is it possible that Tesla is so behind technologically that it can not prevent this from happening? Tiger Woods still alive these two burned alive due to Tesla missteps
"Today I cut off two Telsa drivers lol, then I flipped them the bird at the next intersection while laughing at their ugly betaCuck ball-less car hehe. Nothing looks gahyer than a Tesla now, it symbolizes a woke beta male with feminine dominant genes lols.Anyways it'll be good for a few laughs when this collapses under $200 soon as it all falls apart and they hype dies off. Told ya so.Thanks"
2021 WILL BE REMEMBERED AS THE YEAR OF THE TESLA SHORTS
Tesla is about the only entity that Main Stream Media cannot destroy!
"Freightliner eCascadia coming to market mid-2022. Rivian R1T EV Pickup coming to market, this quarter. Ford's Lightning pickup will arrive in mid-2022.Tesla has yet to release delivery dates for Semi or CT. Who's playing catchup?"
Looks like a green day shorts
Is there a bigger bubble in the entire stock universe than Tesla? Highly doubtful.
"Wall Street expects Tesla to report delivering 170,000 cars in Q1 2021. If it pulls it off, it will be a 92% year-over-year-increase. Tesla only produced 102,672 cars in Q1 2020. During that quarter, just one year ago, Tesla delivered just 88,400."
"Elon, stick to payment businesses like Paypal, that you helped form, you know them best and how they work.you didnt form Tesla, you bought a failing E/v business and diluted shareholders and pumped the stock to insane valuations.go back to creating a new payment processing business."
"$OZSC $OZSC news: Tesla battery storage $TSLA, Patent (PR with patent #), Solar Panel news, possible $100 million from Blackrock $BLK (worlds largest asset manager $8.67 trillion assets), SPAC news w/Blackrock! Target   "
Try to wrap your head around this. Tesla is valued at roughly the equivalent of the entire auto industry while selling just a tiny fraction of the world’s cars. Pumpers say it’s because it’s more than a car company. But 95% of revenues come from auto sales. And without regulatory credits and Bitcoin they don’t even make a profit on those sales. Full autonomy probably not happening this decade. And when it dies it’s highly speculative Tesla will be a big winner there. So how do we get to a $750 billion valuation? Solar roofs? 
"It will get really Ugly in $Tsla. There is no next $NIO in China. it is $Nio and everyone else. The Shanghai auto [NIO]Show demonstrated that well, not to talk about the greatest deal in EV history with Sinpoec stolen through NIO from Tesla. Get used to it, Tsla is Fred Feuerstein and $Nio Star trek."
Elon needs to stop doing drugs and start generating cash
"Tesla, what a scam. Pumping and dumping bitcoin. Showing positive results only due to taking advantage of investors.I liked Tesla, but they just scammed the heck out of retails lmao"
Falling sales on three of their vehicles the 3 the S and the X. Is this really a growth stock?

THE CPI REPORT IS AN INVENTION OF THE SHORTS
Good afternoon everyone.
Book value around $24.00 a share and stock selling over $600. I think I'll buy some puts.
We did it boys 725$ now sky is the limit
"Increasing the EV tax incentive from $7,500, where it currently sits, to $10,000 would be a big deal for Tesla. Everyone can afford a Tesla"
some explain why the analysts have earnings at 0.86 when TSLA made over 1.50 in bitcoin this quarter alone...looks like a softball estimate...we are going to smash it!
$700 close today. $750 Friday
my guess is tesla drops to $400/ share by June
Shorts winners
"India, China, Canada, USA. We are all coming in now. Soon it will go to $1,000 this month"
If you don’t buy Tesla. You are gonna miss out
"Under $700 tomorrow looks like. Longs had their chance today to sell in the $740's, something you probably wish now that you had done. You could've at least sold out at $745 and bought back in tomorrow for $695. $50 bucks off your shares cost right there. Too late now.Thanks"
"Disappointed in Elon I must say. Are you telling me his idolised intelligence couldn’t discern Bitcoin mining energy demands. Absolute rug pull, shilling coins taking profit and leaving the market in disarray."
"Glad to see the selloff is continuing. MSFT is also under selling today. Hopefully this is the start of a massive market collapse, down 10000 points on the Dow. Thanks"

Awesome cars. Awesome management. Just insanely overvalued.
"Tesla just announced they blew Q1 deliveries out of the water. 180,336 vs. ""expert"" consensus of 168,000. That's 7.3% better than anyone predicted, and that's with chip shortages and other hiccups."

"Could be Model Y and 3 new price increase is due to growing demand. Tesla is production limited with those money-maker models and should get higher margins on them. Also, the announcement that Tesla only will sell solar systems tied to a Powerwall and Powerpack is because solar buyers are adding non Tesla battery backups to the Tesla’s lower priced solar systems. Makes sense for a Tesla to sell their own battery storage product with roof top and utility sized projects. Also a Tesla solar system integrated to a Tesla battery storage is more efficient and easier to service. Aftermarket stuff is not always compatible."

"EARNINGS:Last years GAAP earnings were 64 cents/share.My E*trade screen shows under it's earnings summary page:2020 $2.24 [Presumably this was the ""reported"" not GAAP earnings} Estimates 2021 $4.322022 $5.922023 $7.252024 $9.41{Similarly, one assumes this is the consensus estimates of ""reported"" (not GAAP) earnings.]Presumably, these estimates ""priced in"" the current market price.So, one judges the information learned upon the release of TSLA 2021 1st quarter earnings and subsequent conference call relative to the above projections.Often though, there are ""whisper numbers"" reflecting more Bullish expectations, not shown in published estimates but which may already be reflected in the stock price.Personally, my guess (no inside information available to me) is that the 1st quarter ""reported"" earnings will be closer to $2/share than the consensus estimate for the first quarter of 79 cents. I think TSLA could achieve ""reported earnings"" in 2021 closer to the consensus $9.41 shown by E*trade's page for 2024.Based on that earnings, TSLA might be worth as much as $100/share (something over 10 times earnings, which is what is typical for the industry) in 2021.Of course the dreamers think they can project growth into the future and anticipate that TSLA might be earning as much as $50/share by 2030. The dream could come true. (It's not a logical impossibility.) But even then, the stock would, in 2030 be worth only $500.This is why I think the current stock price of $730 is simply crazy."

"why do people compare tesla to apple, apple is litterally the biggest company on earth and they sell premium mobile phones that everyone can buy with a lot more goodwill than tesla, and besides apple is a grown company wich trades very richly. Apple could also be valued at a 10PE so around the same markt cap as tesla while the company is much bigger and has a far more scalable, tech, and less capital intensive bussiness model. so what is for god sake the upside in tesla wich trades the same as apple on a 10 PE?!!"

Tesla will report EPS of $1.15 to $1.20. Mark this post.
All thanks to our wonderful friends at the cia!
Elon just tweeted crash car did NOT have Auto pilot. As in it was never even purchased ! And “limited auto assist”would not activate on that road which is a dead end culdesac. Police should never have given such a statement without first investigating this accident. When you look at all the facts we will learn that this was driver error maybe even drunk driving with a run away driver. Or maybe a wounded driver is still out there in the woods dazed and confused. Anything is possible. Such a sad accident one that has happened many times before all without this public grandstanding. Especially CNBC they for sure took this story and ran it as hard as they can pay attention to them they are always anti Tesla hence the constant dragging out of Gordon Johnson
What a gift!! I wonder who tweaked this story to drop it 30 bones before a major upswing on earnings ??

Sorry to all who are stubbornly anti Tesla. I think it was 3 or 4 years ago when I saw the battery skateboard in the mall I bought 1000 shares at $38 then I lived thru the endless barrage of attacks on Teslas valuations. I can’t tell you how many times I went in and out of this stock. I finally stopped around 1100 Presplit. Today I’m holding 4065 shares all of it is profit. To all you bashers keep on bashing your helping keep Tesla in the news and giving them amazing publicity ! To Elon THANK YOU !
So far so good! we should see 750 tomorrow if we can stand on 720 today.
Run Telsa run the smart investors know to focus on path and earnings will be great!!!!

Musk is running out of options to turn a profit he used bitcoin as a distraction to Chinese regulatory proceedings so the stock price wouldn't drop pumped bitcoin to boost earnings by accepting it as a currency for tesla then trashed bitcoin and said he wouldn't accept it (probably because the price is too volatile) maybe he will pump it again to turn a profit at the next earnings call or maybe cathie woods will increase her price target to 10000 USD. Be fun seeing how it turns out but it won't get short squeezed when the short interest is only 5%. This is not financial advice do your own DD.
"Tesla cars can drive with no one in driver's seat: Consumer Reports.Influential U.S. magazine Consumer Reports said on Thursday its engineers were able to operate a Tesla Inc(TSLA) vehicle without anyone in the driver's seat, but the system failed to send out a warning or indicate that the driver's seat was empty.The engineers tested Tesla Model Y this week as investigators probe an accident where two men died after their Tesla Model S, which was believed to be operating without anyone in the driver's seat, crashed into a tree on Saturday night north of Houston. Over several trips across half-mile closed test track, the Model Y automatically steered along painted lane lines, the magazine said.""In our evaluation, the system not only failed to make sure the driver was paying attention, but it also couldn't tell if there was a driver there at all,"" said Jake Fisher, senior director of Consumer Reports' auto testing. ""Tesla is falling behind other automakers like GM and Ford that, on models with advanced driver assist systems, use technology to make sure the driver is looking at the road.""Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.The report also comes amid growing scrutiny over Tesla's semi-automated driving system following recent accidents and as it is preparing to launch its updated ""full self-driving"" software to more customers.Tesla's Autopilot is a driver assistance system that handles some driving tasks and allows drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel at times, but Tesla says its features ""require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous"

"If you can't learn to roll with the punches of a currently highly volatile market, owning a stock like TSLA is not for you. Shorts foolishly call for the end on every big selloff, only to get upended when the stock roars back to life. Shorts were so confident they were right at 597, yet here we are at 743 and they still call for the end. They've been calling for the end the company's whole existence, even as sales have materialized, they've achieved profitability and become free cash flow positive, etc. And what's worse, they act as if TSLA is strictly a car company, when anyone with a brain knows they are a car company, battery company, chip company, solar company, and technology company all rolled into one. I don't feel sorry for the still existing shorts...they had plenty of chances to cover their positions yet now find themselves so broke many of them may be homeless. It's not going to get any better. With just 3 percent of their total addressable market met, all they have to do is maintain market share and volumes and revenue will grow explosively. I am almost at a loss for words why shorts still exist...Einhorn and Chanos still refer to TSLA as a cult stock when it has more than made the dream reality. Arguing against EVs at this point is like arguing the sun won't come up tomorrow. It's not a question of if cars will go fully electric but when."
Three years ago I was told by my advisor that TSLA would reach $5000 a share in five years. I bought 2000 shares. With the 5 for 1 stock split it only has to hit $1000 a share for him to be correct. I have made more money in the last three years with TSLA stock than in my entire life up to that point. I want to publicly thank Ben Wallen.
"Bought TSLA last August at $480, it jumps to $900 and now this... Will give it a few more months."
Tesla soon $200 wait and watch plz don’t buy
"Gamblers are not investors - TSLA, GME are for gamblers who are playing music chairs"
Tesla sold out of entire quarters production in one month. Facts matter kids. Why don’t you just short the stock instead of posting nonsense? I love watching short sellers get reamed. One of my simple pleasures in life.
"$WIMI $TSLA $QQQ Medium - and long-term no problem in line with the policy, floating chips are also much, a short - term news point fire, the stock price is easy to get up"
I will never own a Tesla product and support a person like Elon Musk
YIKES Did you hear what FSR Fisker Just Reported. ? That’s the NEXT TESLA - $11 now; $211 this time next year EASY. Fox con & Sharp Electronics deal. That’s APple computers iPhone maker. LOOK OUT my fellow Teslites
"I wonder how Tesla's management is feeling about taunting the world's largest automakers about their EV plans?It's got to be rough to see VW, Hyundai, Ford, GM, Mercedes, BMW and Geely (and now Toyota) all building out massive supply chains for EVs just about the time the company is making promises for never ending growth and world domination.Perhaps magic will happen.Guru."
Ever heard the phrase “a day late and dollar short?” Ford is following everyone in trying to develop its own battery manufacturing. The announcement would have been timely about 2 years ago.
"(Reuters) -Two men died after a Tesla vehicle, which was believed to be operating without anyone in the driver's seat, crashed into a tree on Saturday night north of Houston, authorities saidtwo more idiots get a Tesla burial."

"Bonds are rising and rising, competition is taking market shares from Tesla. Poor bag holders. I feel, the final Tesla sell-off is ahead."
I just bought some Call spreads which means the rally is probably over. ha
Can somebody explain why all EV stocks more-or-less go up and down in lockstep?
Why does everyone mock Bitcoin while our government just prints dollar bills as fast as the press allows I’m no longer sure which one is fictitious

The accident that happened is not Teslas fault. When entering Autopilot or FSD the safety instructions say you must stay in driver seat and have hands on the wheel or ready to take over at any point. If you dont follow the safety instructions for anything what do you think will happen???? Silly to blame this on Teslas FSD and not on the drivers who failed to comply with safety guidelines.
FORD = found on road dead. Not a quality product
Look at plug power. Tesla chart will look the same very soon.
Should be a Good Friday for the market and TSLA
Blue Oval and SK innovation joint venture. The missing link? BlueOvalSK.
I have just read a theory in Seeking Alpha...based on outstanding options in Tesla and the link to daily trading volume as a kind of arbitrage; 18th june must be a very important day ref. expiration or so.....well.....stock should move into the direction of 400 - even that is too high when you take the 5 :1 split....2000 $...well....
Incoming short squeeze

I'm wondering if all those who bought years back sold above 500 or decided to lose it all back.
so people react like this with news from over the weekend by dumping stocks in the company? Some investors walk on egg shells....
"On average there are 171,000 car fires per year resulting in 345 deaths! Where are all the news stories investigating ICE car manufacturers???"
I pray Tesla succeeds where they want too as the auto industry will be boring with out them.
Tesla is not a $700 stock. Would you hold the pumped junk over the weekend?
"Just read that the first GMC Hummer EV pickup was auctioned for 2.5 million dollars . GM reserved the first production unit V0001 for an auction . All of the 2.5 million will go to the Tunnel To Towers foundation which benefits veterans, gold star families and families of first responders killed in the line of Duty . I’m sure Elon has done something similar ??"

Gotta love democrats.. they will safe the planet... from themselves!!! lol
Friday will be a sell-off. I would load tomorrow for below $700.
"4:30pm... fresh out of the kitchen, Elon has finished cooking the books and will no doubt report great results, despite the fact that Telsa had virtually no sales of the high-end, high-profit X and S models; and despite the fact that Tesla was slashing prices daily during Q1. But Elon the master chef will not disappoint!"
I repeat $280 target on this. !!

Fisker WINS  hands down compared to Tesla the chances of it outperforming Fisker; which analysts say can DOUBLE TO TEN X is just three to thirty six months. NO WAY Tesla can do that.
watch it drop after earnings. who wants to bet?
"Cbeee,I tried to post a message to your query about 'who is manipulating this', but Yahoo won't let me.Here is some insight for you:Good Morning Cbeee, you haven't posted for a while but I think it is important to realize that this is called a 'long con' or a Ponzi scheme. With enough money and enough people, there is no need to be held responsible for the promises made . . . until the money or people who can be convinced run out.Tesla has overcome the 'gap' to make it a mainstream company, but the manipulation has been by those promoting the company, not by those highlighting the broken promises. The stock is doing well (it started last year at $85). You should take at least some of your money off the table. This sort of move away from the median, away from the fundamentals of the company, can only be a result of manipulation. The manipulation has been caused by the marginal buyer, not the sellers.Best of luck. Guru."
"As soon as the anti-Tesla hype and FUD tune down reason and direction will return. The TSLA vault will continue as predicted. Tesla frequently moves up and down quickly. But the trend forward overall for highs is inevitably there. Patience longs, as it will come to pass."
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9KtkIarbnMg
"History has many times demonstrated positive s for the stock - Tesla today, shows a huge pre-market jump indicating a good buying opportunity to position yourself in a multi-sector brand that will undoubtedly have a massive upside on today's price - It's a BUY"
"The government has stepped in with lots of cash to support electric vehicles.They will help pay for 500,000 electric vehicle chargers over the next decade. This helps Tesla competition more than it helps TeslaThey will help to pay for modifying factories to build electric vehicles. This helps Tesla competition more than it helps TeslaMore grants and tax incentives to encourage buyers. This helps everybody unless there is a penalty for already having sold a whole bunch of cars (Tesla/GM).They will help to shore up domestic supply chains to make electric cars and trucks. This helps the traditional auto manufacturers who rely on such supply chains more than it helps Tesla (vertically integrated).Tesla provided proof of concept, made mistakes, and got a bit of a head start. Every major automaker will now pile on. The lead will erode, market share will be re-allocated, and there will eventually be equilibrium."
Elon is so leveraged we could put him in the poorhouse

Just keep remembering 1 billion cash no debt several manufacturing partnership deals and 113 mill profit in 2023 with new deals and partnerships coming every day. $AAPL rumors who knows? Fisker is in a much better position than $TSLA was starting out plus Europe and the US wants to go completely electric in next decade. 12 a share. This will be a $100+ company in a couple years.
Another TSLA crash reported…faulty brakes now..this is gonna go down the hill fast. Next stop 411.

Interesting short term technical analysis of TSLA on JP Strategic Investments You Tube video channel.
"Sell crypto and short tesla , he brought it on himself"
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. auto safety agency disclosed on Thursday it has opened 27 investigations into crashes of Tesla vehicles, 23 of which remain active, and at least three of the crashes occurred in recent weeks."
Looking for big gains tomorrow on the way to $800 after all the media lies.
I will keep buying till earnings. good luck guys 
"I will honestly say if you are a long termer you are good..it's the short term people who are hammering the stock, but holding will more than likely balance things out in the long term. It's just like when earnings happen with a stock and you get a temporary boom so a stock goes super high, this stock reacts to any news and goes super high or low...so if the fundamentals are in place long term holders will do just fine.."
"Tesla sold more vehicles in 18 key European markets than any other car maker in March—23,841 new registrations—according to a report from Schmidt based on public data."
"Guys, I'm new to investing. Why is Tesla climbing like that? Was there some news?"
"Tesla's quarterly revenue made it barely past estimates, relying mostly on sales of environmental credits and the liquidation of 10% of its $1.5 billion bitcoin investment. LOL!And a global shortage of computer chips is expected to limit production from all manufacturers in the immediate future, and Tesla won’t be exempt. In fact, given the ongoing importance of its production ramp-up, it may even be more heavily impacted."
Tesla has been issued 18 notices of violation and 21 permit deviations in 2018 and 2019 for polluting the air in Fremont.
"After California DMV decision to put Tesla self driving mechanism under review, expect significant drop of Tesla share price tomorrow and days to come!"

"When asked about start of Cyber Truck production this year in Austin, his reply was """"Limited production of Model Y this year, high volume next year."" Again, the question was ask: ""..and Cyber Truck?"" Musk did not respond. We were promised a reveal of a production intent CT to be shown last November, albeit only renderings. Even those did not materialize. Half a year later, nada. Hey Elon, I'm a captive fan (of Tesla's products, not you), so C'mon man, bring it!"
"When Tesla releases v9 of their FSD, market would pickup. Most likely Model S and X refresh would have some awe factor that could excite the market. Importantly, if Tesla issues FSD kit to other cars already in the market, then that would be a huge plus and additional revenue. I am not sure whether it is possible."
It’s over..sell the company for
"Shorting TSLA is the easiest investment now. Why?Musk knows his company cannot be profitable, so he is playing with BTC and DOGE to cover Tesla's loss.Without BTC, Tesla was losing money for every car they sold. Next quarter, Musk would have to come up with something to dress up Tesla's earnings. Short TSLA."
"That would be very nice if your God would concentrate on his business rather than destroying bitcoin and promoting Jokecoin. Very bad for your image, guys."

"Great quarter, better than most Tesla quarters. Still a skeptic because only one model has growing sales and the three other ones are in sales decline. One day, perhaps when the stock price comes in a lot, I will consider buying some shares . That price is a long ways off. Will there be sales growth in the 2nd quarter? 3rd? We will see. Perhaps business improvement will close some of the gap from bubble to reasonable ... I just don't see it"

I've recommended Ford shares for weeks now. EV's are the future and so is Ford. Tesla's had its run and Ford's just starting. Don't believe it? Then just check out Fords chart. You'll make money; instead of losing it.
443usd before 1june hedge you're shares same as the big boss will do:)))))
"Media and bots aren’t profiting off the stock so they are blatantly trying to be divisive towards TSLA. First, TSLA is not just a car brand like Ford, it’s competition is not only future EV companies but also battery companies, each it has a head start on. Second, TSLA has a speaker design and has produced way more cars than any other producers like F or GM. Lastly, if anyone is thinking TSLA is going to get beat by two dinosaur companies run by non-engineers good luck, I’m sticking with Elon for this."
3500 per share...
Tomorrow! What say?

"If you look at the 5 year chart.....it only goes one direction, up. You don’t like the company, Musk, or their products. You could be short and hate everything and want everything to fail but this only goes one direction, look at the chart. This is the easiest call in the market, buy."

Watch Tesla on the 15m chart. It’s about to blow up today
"Any CEO that doesn’t try to earn more from some of their cash holdings, take advantage of every legal industry incentive, environmental subsidies, renewable energy funds, government rebates and tax credits is not acting in the best interesthis company or its stakeholders. Pro-active leadership is a commodity in sharp demand for large and small businesses Playing it too safe following dated business plan fundamentals stagnates rapid growth. Tesla upcoming GFs production capacity of its highly in demand product is yet to be unleashed. Eventually all BEV manufacturer’s customers will lose their incentives. The new administration’s energy policy locks in a market for renewable energy on a scale never seen. Elon Musk is so far meeting his 10 year compensation plan incentives and is on target of becoming by 2025 the world’s first trillionaire. And worth every Penny of it."
Wow Cathie did you mean to say 300 instead of 3000 because 300 sounds more like it............................

"Ignore the short trolls that only come out on dark days. Everything has pulled back in sync; NIO, $XPEV, $TSLA, etc. There's absolutely no fundamental reason for any of these to pullback except for market overreaction across the board. This is the worst time to sell. It's the best time to buy and hold with an iron grip. All three of these EV companies will have even higher deliveries this quarter. XPEV and NIO will be back above $45 within the short term. Keep buying. Keep holding. You've been given biggest discounts of the year."
the cult is dense today my friends
"Tesla's small print - hilarious ((( If you are entitled to a refund of your payment or to a buyback, we reserve the right to refund to you either the exact Bitcoin Price that you provided to us at the time of purchase or an amount of US Dollars that is equivalent to the US Dollar price of the product that you purchased, at our sole and absolute discretion, taking into consideration operational efficiency. )))"
how ford can make 10x tesla earnings and 5x revenue and be worth 20x lower

TSLA is the only flying car! Has electric cars too and has Bitcoin holdings! The other electric car makers don’t have a flying car or Bitcoin holdings!
How many bitcoins did the other large cap companies need to sell?
It’s so funny the shorties are puffing their chest today. When this hits $650 and bounces back the longs will puff their chest. This stock is a casino so no matter which side you’re on this stock is just gambling .

Cathie and mafia pump again....buy now before it's too late...you can get bankrupt soon...why wait?!
Same ole story. 10-year Treasury yield spikes. Fed buys rates back down despite evidence of runaway inflation. Absolutely reckless.

Big run up tomorrow to much good news !!!! Shorts will take a beaten in premarket can’t wait 
"I follow the Tesla news daily and it is incredible how old stories get rehashed by crooked media supporting either side. Particularly those supporting the shorts. The German factory delay is already factored into the stock price as that was part of the communication during Q1 earnings call. There was even noise about that before when Tesla/Musk was venting about the red tape in Germany. So now a so called ""report"" that German production is delayed by 6 months. How absurd are those trying to bash the stock. I would not be surprised that there are powerful hedgefunds that manufacture noise to make money off their positions."
i see you at GREEN area sooon today.
"52 week low is 136. Yes 136 !! It has had tremendous gains in a year. Can it get back there ? Probably not, but never say never. All the analysts with exorbitant price targets will start to lower their targets soon."

incoming tesla $450 
Gap up to $700 tomorrow would be nice.
TSLA buying bitcoin was the top of the market.
Break out of this bull flag takes Tesla to $830. Just a matter of time before we're into price discovery again!!!
"See Bloomberg article ""Tesla Accused in Suit of Firing Worker to Cover Up Copper Theft"". yohoo won't let me post link. It sounds an awful lot like the case of the guy who reported excessive damaged battery cells that were wasted. Retribution against people who report problems to management seems to be a real problem at Tesla. If you ignore problems or cover them up they only get worse. just think what message this sends to other employees. This unhealthy attitude may be the root cause behind some of the awful customer service issues we hear."

The FUD this week has been amazing it’s like all the powers that be launched an attack on Tesla. But we’re still here the big boys are looking scared.

"The Elon con: I never said Elon wasn't smart. I wondered about the usefulness of the bitcoin: we know he bought it to enable him to boost earnings when needed to keep the sheep from wandering. But, how does he know he will have profits in bitcoin to be realized when needed? The answer is in the 10k. It's a sort of heads I win; tails you lose game. The bitcoin will be marked down to the lowest price attained in a reporting period with the write down being treated as a restructuring or other expense (so not in reported earnings).With a volatile bubble like asset like bitcoin, either the prices just go straight up, in which case there obviously will be profits that can be tapped at will to enhance a weak quarter, or, they go up and down, in which case the downward move will give an opportunity to push the ""cost"" of the bitcoin down with a restructuring expense, thereby ensuring an unrealized profit in the future to be included in earnings when needed.From the 10k "" In determining if an impairment has occurred, we consider the lowest market price of one bitcoin quoted on the active exchange since acquiring the bitcoin. If the then current carrying value of a digital asset exceeds the fair value so determined, an impairment loss has occurred with respect to those digital assets in the amount equal to the difference between their carrying values and the price determined.Impairment losses are recognized within Restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the impairment is identified. The impaired digital assets are written down to their fair value at the time of impairment and this new cost basis will not be adjusted upward for any subsequent increase in fair value. Gains are not recorded until realized upon sale(s), at which point they are presented net of any impairment losses for the same digital assets held within Restructuring and other. In determining the gain to be recognized upon sale, we calculate the difference between the sales price and carrying value of the digital assets sold immediately prior to sale."""
I'm giving you fair warning: A severe lack of supply of commodities is currently choking off production which means there is NO WAY sales forecasts will be achieved going forward. Sell now or be left holding the bag.

TSLA started to hire in Texas. Buy and accumulate. The more more buy and hold at this level the more explosive become the short squeeze. At least in Q1 I see 1200 breakout . Buy after hour"
Is Tesla going to send any of those ventilators that they built in Buffalo to India?

Instead of trying to maintain the technological lead in the EV sector, the CEO is wasting his focus on crypto‘s while the competition is catching up and taking over. In China, local manufacturers continue to impress growing rapidly - no chance for Tesla keeping up with them in their territory. In Europe soon the same; just saw a brand new e-tron, yesterday- boy that car looks like a high class bullet. In the US, the true authentic brands like GM & Ford will come up with competitive models, which the people will prefer mid-/longterm due to better quality & service infrastructure"
Startup's face the most difficult part: scaling up production. Anybody can say they are going to do it. Talk is cheap.Legacy auto has ICE weighing them down like a ball and chain while swimming.Perhaps that why we don't see any meaningful competition yet.
"Legally, Elon's biggest mistake, was not just making preposterous claims about FSD, but giving definitive timelines for it's completion. He can't kick the can much further down the road, since he has already missed serval promised dates. Customer's patience is beginning to wane. It's put up, or shut up time, but Tesla has nothing to offer, and Musk is still talking."
fake news from car death. the fire took 3 minutes to take out according the the firedepartment and police investigation showed that autopilot was not on during crash. Noce try shorters
Good to see Tesla worth $750 billion again if you use the 100mn shares of comp and warrants. Or should we not include all that free money shareholders gave to management ?
boys just keep buying...long term tesla will be 3000 a share...ignore the shorties ...they want ur shares....just buy and hold .
200 day moving average is $580. If that doesn’t hold this is going to make shorts a lot more money.
Elon distancing himself from crypto is actually bullish for this stock because the fiat cartel was about to take him to the woodshed otherwise. You could tell by the amount of increasingly regulatory actions/crackdown on Tesla these few months.
"China has landed a probe onto Mars. Rumors is, they are looking for the idea location for a Chinese Takeout, so that when Musk finally arrives, he can order his favorite, General Tso's Chicken, extra spicy, with two egg rolls on the side."
"Which one of those scenarios Tesla is better of in terms of its bottom line?1. EV industry is gaining a lot of recognition, noticable shift towards it by the industry, tge future is undoubtably EV and significant regulatory tailwind. But coming in a lot of competition. A lot of serious startups and the big boys coming in like VW, GM, F etc. 2. EV industry is still in its infancy, industry is ignoring it, there is regulatory support but it is not significantly large, also the support is shortsighted, there are new srartups but nothing is really a threat to the marketshare, big guys are asleep and Tesla is ruling the gameThe latter has been the case so far but I think we are at an infliction point to 1. Tesla might still rule but the landscape is changing quite dramatically. So, when you think about it which case favors Tesla in terms of its bottomline and eventually the stock performance?"

They have more cash than debt, the most EV deliveries globally, and more demand than available product. They also have their own charging stations and energy business. The CEO even has a space program that will help return America to the moon.ICE manufacturers: struggling to catch up after procrastinating and moving into EV at a snail's pace with mountains of debt. Startups: have yet to prove that they can scale up production, which is one of the most difficult things to do.Chinese manufacturers: limited to the Chinese market so far, and Nio doesn't even make their own cars."

Do people not see how Tesla will grow 50% CAGR for 10 years to total 3Terawatts of battery production by 2030. The P/E WILL come down. It sure looks expensive if you don’t account for the growth. Margins will get better once production really starts to ramp up and start to produce their 4680 cells in 12-18 months. BE PATIENT
Wall Street just started heavily short selling it since last Friday morning! TSLA’s chart was reacting completely opposite to the broader market!

Add up over the life of the BEV all the incentives, various rebates, not buying gas, less maintenance and repairs a Tesla’s cost is competitive with a similar ICE. Range anxiety? Millions have a second ICE vehicle at their disposal. Most utilities are providing nothing down home/business solar systems with large incentives. It’s the future and good for ME."

Better interiors, more local service locations, Electrifyamerica locations with 150 kW fast charging. Tesla will need to do something radical to stay competitive.

"I have extended my short exposure MASSIVLY.The bubble actually stops and we will see abutting never seen at WALLSTREET.Tesla to Produce 800 million cars?PE is often used as a realistic barometer of a companies value. With an auto producer that PE could be extended to cars produced. For example, Toyota produced 8.8 million cars last year to achieve earnings. Their PE is 9.21. This indicates that Toyota needs to produce 8.8 million cars times 9.21 years of earnings to meet market cap. This total is 81,480,000 vehicles.Tesla produced 500,000 cars last year. Their PE is 1,628 and this is not a fully diluted PE. Multiply the two and the total is 814 million cars. Fully diluted and this number nears 900 million. There is not enough raw material capacity to achieve this in the next 10 years. World auto production in 2019 was 91,786,861. Tesla, at their present margin ratios which would include the sale of regulatory credits, would need to sell every car in the world for 10 years to have a PE similar to Toyota. The Tesla market cap is absurd at best. Buy it now and you will pay a hefty price in the next few years."

"Demand for Tesla's is fading in the U.S. due declining resale value. Resale value is declining substantially due to economic conditions and introduction of better technology and lower prices of new models. Model Y will be the one bright spot this year(not an SUV by the way.) If you want to own a 'Not an Automotive company', be prepared for 'Hardware depreciation'. Impact on lease residuals will be noticeable if accounted for. The fallacy of appreciation is laughable, as is the idea of FSD / Robofleet boosting resale.

"With Panasonic agreeing to build TESLA's 4680 cells, we may well see a million tesla cars built in 2021. Consider this. Tesla was already building these cells in Fremont, yet Elon seemed frustrated that they couldn't scale it fast enough. Now Panasonic comes in and says ""bro, we got this, you won't have to go it alone with the new battery"". I have a feeling Panasonic knows a secret that they are not sharing with Elon on mass producing the 4680 cell. After all, Panasonic is a mass battery expert. So Panasonic will have Elon and Tesla on the hook for awhile."

"It’s been a great run and I’ve been a Tesla bull for a while, but I’m selling now because I don’t see how long this can go on for.I held on for a long time when virtually every analyst was screaming sell. There was just something about the stock that told me “no, hold on”.I already made 6-700%+ and that is very hard to ignore, plus with so many other players nipping at their heels I think it’s time to liquidate at least partially and spread the bet. I bought some at 240 way before the stock split so I’m quite happy.It’s mad that the split stock is now trading near pre split price. That doesn’t make sense to me given the underlying value in the company. To justify the valuation they would have to hit no hiccups at all in the next decade. I think there has to be a pop at some point and it may be a good point to sell, wait then buy back in. I already did that a couple of months back over a dip and made a bit of extra cheddar.I may of course really regret it and miss out on more. Could be wrong and good luck to all of you that have held on for the ride and done well. It’s a crazy stock that often defies logic so I’m past trying to understand it. It’s done so well that I’m essentially playing with the house’s money now and there are other great stocks out there too.I’m actually more interested in Space X and am waiting for an IPO or similar news on that.Well done all Tesla kids, you really made the grade "

"So who's paying for the replacement of 135,000 recalls?""Tesla says its faulty touchscreens that led to a recall were only built to last 5-6 yearsTesla agreed to recall more than 134,000 of its cars over faulty touchscreens this week.US regulators said the failing displays could affect essential components like the rear-view camera.Tesla agreed to the recall, and said its screens shouldn't be expected to last more than 5-6 years.Visit the Business section of Insider for more stories.Tesla agreed this week to recall more than 134,000 vehicles with flash memory units that may wear out unexpectedly, rendering the cars' touchscreens useless in some cases, but it didn't go down without a fight.In a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration made public on Tuesday, Elon Musk's electric automaker claimed its screens weren't failing prematurely - they were just designed that way.Tesla's legal chief, Al Prescott, pushed back against the regulator's definition of a ""defect,"" arguing that the eMMC memory devices in question were only built to last five to six years. He said that lifespan is standard for infotainment systems in the industry.""While the wear rate is heavily influenced by the active use of the center display system, even more so when the vehicle is in drive or charging, given a reasonable average daily use of 1.4 cycles, the expected life would be 5-6 years,"" Prescott said.

I just drove a Dodge Hellcat. What a great car. There is one point I like better about the Hellcat and that is what they call gasoline. When you run out you simply go to the nearest replenishment facility and within minutes you are ripping up the asphalt again.

Anyway I give the Hellcat a recommended buy for anyone that isn't doing any across the country driving. (long distance)Go ICE's!
"Tesla Recall Email (Full Text):""In order to ensure your safety, Tesla will proactively retrofit a power steering component in all Model S vehicles built before April 2016. (No other Tesla vehicles are affected.) There have been no injuries or accidents due to this component, despite accumulating more than a billion miles of driving.To be clear, this recall does not apply to any Model X or Model 3 vehicles, only to Model S vehicles built before April 2016.We have observed excessive corrosion in the power steering bolts, though only in very cold climates, particularly those that frequently use calcium or magnesium road salts, rather than sodium chloride (table salt). Nonetheless, Tesla plans to replace all early Model S power steering bolts in all climates worldwide to account for the possibility that the vehicle may later be used in a highly corrosive environment.If the bolts fail, the driver is still able to steer the car, but increased force is required due to loss or reduction of power assist. This primarily makes the car harder to drive at low speeds and for parallel parking, but does not materially affect control at high speed, where only small steering wheel force is needed.Our records show that you own a Model S affected by this voluntary recall. At this time there is no immediate action you need to take and you may continue to drive your Model S. Tesla will contact you to schedule an appointment when parts are available in your region. The retrofit will typically take around an hour.Thank you for being a Tesla customer, and we apologize for this inconvenience. If you have any questions, please contact us by phone at 844-248-3752 or by email at ServiceHelpNA@tesla.com.""Commentary: We know the recall involves replacing 3 bolts. The cost will be ~ $1/car. They say the recall takes an hour. In reality that is 30 minutes of a repair tech's time ($25) and 30 minutes of useless waiting around while they wash your car and give you coffee. ($10). (all numbers pulled out of my tush, but you get the idea) $36/car * 123k cars = $4.4M for the whole affair. If the bolts didn't meet Tesla's spec much of that will be eaten by the vendor. Either way, its not a material expense."

"""So tired of hearing the “Tesla isn’t profitable without emission credits” baloney. Capex was over 3 billion in 2020. Emission credits a few hundred million per quarter. What that means is if Tesla would stop pouring money into building the most efficient factories in the world they’d be wildly profitable now."" ~ juanMYGAWD so tired of seeing clueless cult members post cluelsss nonsense. A. Every car maker has capex. If what you say were true, all other car makers would have several fold higher profits than they report. tesla is nothing special in that regard.But unfortunately for you morons,...B. New capex is not expensed. For you clueless cult members, that means the $3 billion spent on capex in 2020 is not deducted from revenues on the income statement, so it has little immediate bearing on tesla's bottom line.Capital expenditures like equipment and new plants are put on the balance sheet and depreciated over years. For you clueless cult members, that means only a small fraction is deducted on the income statement. Depending on the asset and current tax rules (like during pandemics when the government might encourage capex or not) it may take 5 to 39 years to deduct the cap ex.If you look at tesla's cash flow statement in the Q3 10Q it shows about $1.7 billion in depreciation over the 9 months. That's an accumulaiton of deductions over its entire life of buying assets. For the qtr that would be depreciation of about $500 million.Ford shows over $7 billion for the first 9 months or $2.33 billion per qtr. If it didn't dedect this, it would have reported earnings of $5 billion for the qtr. or $20 billion per year with a PE like tesla has, it should have a market cap of 1400 x $20 billion or $28 trillion.What tesla's cash flow statment also says is, were it not for tesla issuing $10's of billions in stock because it makes no profits, it would be close to insolvent."

And come Q3 when Ford and GM are finally selling real EV's that people want, I wonder what happens when Tesla has negative sales comps."

"Take an ICE car, throw away the entire engine except the alternator, install alternator onto transmission - you've just created an electric car - figuratively. No mote hydraulic lifters (4-5 parts), no more candhafts (2-8 parts including gears plus attachment hatdware and bearings, belt, idler pulley, tensioner, attachment hardware, belt covers, more attachment hardware), pistons with at least 4 ring parts each on a 4 cylinder car - that's at least 20 parts on a 4 cylinder plus 4 wrist pons plus 8 securing clips, 4 wrist pin bushings, 4 connecting rods, 8 bearings (8 half bearings), crankshaft, at least 5 bearing parts for that, possibly 4 to 8 oil squirters, flywheel or a torque coverter for automatic transmissions (multiple parts to this assembly and a requirement for several quarts of toxic synthetic or real oil, the list of parts in an ICE engine can reach over 1000 finished parts. Anyone (some Wall Street analysts will tell you an electric car is more complicated and harder to assemble than a gas car. That's a blatant lie. Read my first sentence again."

Sold all my tesla shares gonna buy bitcoin now
General market feels like its going to pullback some gains from last week today
Tesla fell 30% last fall before more than doubling. What makes anyone think this will be any different? The future is bright. Lots of catalysts coming. Onward and upward
Don't you pu55y shorters get it? Tesla stock is TEFLON! Ha ha ha! Lol! $872.00....read it and weep!! Serves you all right!
"So who thinks they are building the car for $29k? The only hope I see for them to make any profit is if people buy the Standard +, pay $1500-$2500 for a different color, pay $1000 for white interior, $1500 for 19"" wheels and $8000 for AP & FSD. Of course that bumps the price right back up to $50k."

"Never shorted a stock , but I am putting 25% oF my portfolio in shorting this for the long term. This short position will pay my children’s wedding and school tuition. I could not be more excited about shorting this for the long term. I will keep the short and watch myself get richer by the next 6 years"

"Longs don't seem to realise that there is a list, as long as the giggle factory, of class action lawsuits as well as individual lawsuits, not only by shorts who lost money based on a fraudulent lie, but LONGS too, who bought at 270 expecting the price to go to the takeover price of 420. Some of those longs too (who bought and/or added to their positions) are sitting on massive losses. THESE LOSSES ARE AS A RESULT OF A BLATANT LIE BY MUSK. Contrary to other class action lawsuits that seem to run into the sand, all these Tesla lawsuits are now validated by having the SEC settlement on their side. This proves their case.This is a complete unknown quantity of negativity and potential loss for tesla, but guaranteed it will run on for years and cost billions! If only one of these cases is won, the floodgates will open."

Tesla was TheStreet's stock of the year in 2020 after its unprecedented rise in the past year. ""In all the excitement generated by Tesla (TSLA) the stock, we often seem to forget about Tesla the company and what it stands for. Elon Musk has a vision and that vision is to make a car that doesn't destroy the environment. He has had this market pretty much to himself for several years and, like a Netflix (NFLX) or an Amazon (AMZN), the company's sales hit a level of scale that allows Tesla to fund its business at very inexpensive levels in the stock market through incredibly eager buyers. In this case, Tesla's doing it with stock sales -- $5 billion at the market right now, second tranche by the way,"" Jim Cramer wrote in his column for Real Money."
J. D. Power today ranked Tesla number 30 out of 33 car brands for reliability which is the top concern of most buyers. And this is supposed to be the future of autos?

"have predicted the past handful of quarters correctly from some information given and will attempt to do it here as well. don't care if you think I'm just blowing smoke but this will be a BIG beat for TSLA, hence why so many price adjustments northwards. capital was deployed to build out factories so the balance sheet takes a small hit BUT the secondary offering pretty much canceled that out. deliveries are on track to outpace last year and China market still a place of strong sales. expect a profit and revised guidance for subsequent quarters. interested in hearing about the other parts of their business (SaaS, solar, etc..) which aren't the key revenue generators but are still very important for future growth."
"Tesla shareholders do not see ""the future""; they see only their imaginations. Many of them have excellent imaginations. The problem is: they are imagining things without a good foundation in science, math, or business knowledge -- knowing science, math and business allows one to imagine future events accurately. Their imagination is delusion because it is based on flawed premises."

I'm guessing those suppliers decided not to give that money back........eh?
"Please, please, what a lame excuse for cutting supply to Norway. So, instead of keeping the badly needed delivery numbers up in Norway, Musk decides to cut supply - because of some problem with the delivery trucks. What a load of rubbish.

NasdaqTesla's Crazy Valuation in 1 Chart26 mins ago
Things are getting desperate inside Tesla. Elon is cracking the whip. Vehicles being rushed to build process to make profits. I wouldn’t be surprised to see more cars exploding into flames in the near future. That won’t be good for business.

why would anyone short a stock in general? just find a stock you like and invest in the company
"Reminder - Bailie Gifford & Co is one the largest shareholders in $TSLA . The fund is the largest shareholder of $NIO and started their position in 2018. Here’s why they believe $NIO could reach a valuation of $300 billion: What it does:NIO designs and jointly manufactures smart, high performance, premium connected electric vehicles. Why we own it:- An emerging, uniquely Chinese brand champion that aspires to completely reimagine the experience of car ownership and shape a community of 'joyful users' with premium member services offered through NIO House and NIO Life.- A vast market opportunity, China accounts for 60% of incremental EV sales globally with huge pent-up demand given the chances of citizens obtaining a licence plate for a non-EV in e.g. Beijing are 1-in-800. Nor is the market limited to China.- An aspiring founder who naturally thinks in a long time frame and invests personally in his distinctive vision.- An attractive business model. THere is considerable space capacity in the Chinese automotive industry and NIO is happy to outsource the manufacture of its product to high-quality partners while retaining control of key intellectual property. How it could be worth many times more:- Over ten years, 1m premium vehicles a year (RMB400bn), licencing IP to a further 1m (at least RMB40bn) and an affluent community of 5-10m embrace.- NIO Life ancillary offerings (clothing, clubhouses, entertainment) at RMB30k each p.a. (RMB200bn+).- Margins are 2x traditional premium vehicles (20%) giving a post-tax cash flow of ~100bn RMB and valuation of $300bn Short 10 Questions: 1.) Can sales double in the next five years?Just the fothills. Progress toward 0.5m cars per year and approaching 1m members cumulatively. 2.) Ten years and beyond?Mass-market IP licencing, premium memberships, autonomy. Joint ventures with Changan and GAC capable of 2m cars per year (1/3rd of market)? Level 4 autonomy to be commonplace in China before the West? 3.) Competitive advantage?Deep connection with its member community. Aspiration brand and lifestyle choices. Technology. 4.) Is the business culture different?Yes. Bringing joy to customers through design, value, community, exceeding expectations, honesty. 5.) Customers like you? Contribute to society?So far, emphatically yes. Demand has been greater (and broader) than even the company expected. 6.) Are returns worthwhile?Not at the moment. Still investing heavily behind the vision. 7.) Will they rise or fall?If NIO becomes primarily an IP licensor with low manufacturing investment, returns could rise steeply. 8.) How is capital allocated?Technology (Primarily software), R&D and expanding the NIO House network. 9.) Could it be worth 5x as much?100m affluent customers by 2020. Car ownership per capita 3x lower than most developed economies. 10.) WHAT DOESN'T THE MARKET UNDERSTAND?Lazy anologies to Tesla (the visions differ) combined with fearfulness at the short-term capital needs."
"Classic bull trap stage in the typical stages in a bubble, mania phase is over, now comes the blow off phase which starts with bull trap, we may bounce back upto mid 700’s then as people think we have “return to normal” comes fear and capitulation as the stock price corrects over 50% by next year, good luck to the morons buying at these levels"

"I spent a half hour on the numberous websites and blogs where Tesla owners voice their complaints about Tesla defects and poor customer service. Just sounds like as nightmare to me. Brand new cars with multiple issues, service centers and call centers with poor knowledge and slow service. I would feel sorry for these buyers if it was a Ford or a Toyota (a responsible purchase) But not for Tesla buyers. If Tesla buyers had done any research at all, they never would have purchased it in the first place."

"Dow Jones 8/1 After years of losses that made many investors wonder if the Silicon Valley car maker could ever operate in the black, Tesla has sustained a profit through one of the worst economic shocks in history, helped in part by the sale of regulatory credits.

It's amazing how manipulated the market is. Look no further than Bitcoin and Tesla. Two entities that should be at $50 a share max. Sham of a company. Sham of a business.
"just think, Tesla has data on every driver, what features they like to use most and have and they will keep learning and find features to charge the owners. High profit margin features. ICE cars are not able to do this.Every Tesla moving down the road, is real time AI data and the ICE guys don't have this. tons of data being processed. Example: One day if Police need video footage of some event, they can pull from Tesla, there are mobile safety cameras every where basically. Live AI all moving about the city roads."

And I’ve enjoyed working at a company with such a great passion, with such incredible customers and with a mission that is so “electrifying.” All the best, Tesla!

Valuation is so out of whack and even if you’re bullish you have to agree this is way outta control greed. No stock has ever held such gains over a short period of time. Not invested in TSLA but baffled by this unprecedented gain. Should make for a good story one day.

"While on AP I noticed that the car uses the asphalt on the inside corners where the lines have worn off. I'm always cautious when the road takes a right turn. It is a little unnerving when the car gets a little close to the double yellow. AP is really improving as it learns. Another test I ran was bumping the speed up by 5 mph over the speed limit. On a curvy road AP drops the speed by a few MPH below the speed limit. Not quite there yet, but it'll be cool when the car can recognize green and red lights."

After the tweet and a few weeks later, it's in the $320 range.3. Now, TSLA confirms to remain in public and the company has voiced a common voice and it seems like Mr. CEO has learned to control himself (i.e., no tweet about the plans or the decision) and focus on the tasks at hand.4. If there is any penalty or lawsuit settlement regarding the tweet, it will be minimal and will take a long time to conclude.Therefore, my guess is TSLA will be on the up near and far future.

For a simple reason, not because the bitcoin purchase, not Chip shortages, My decision to sell is as I said was simple: here is""Toyota stock price today went up higher 6% While Tasla tanked almost 6%, this told me that something fundamentally wrong with Tasla""Iam out."
"Performance based now. The institutional ownership will educate the new buyers same as: TLRY, BYnd, spot, crop........hype, hype, hype. New buyers think they are smart......so did the afformentioned. If musk truly cared about ev, he would organically go about business. His product is great. His vision is outstanding. His abilities are off the charts. He will loose it all when we lose faith because he sold his soul to some algorythmic, HF, hedge fund make- me- rich scheme. If it is meant to be it will be.

The company is hanging on by strings.

"There has been a lot of hope and hype about growth for Tesla, but I suspect that a lot of it is misplaced. We now know that almost their entire growth last year was around China. Their sales in Europe were down for the year, and outside of China, any growth was modest or a result of entering a new market.The problem is that much of that growth has been (continually) at the expense of reputation, with consumers and regulatory bodies. The quality of their cars has come into question in Europe (see Netherlands taxi cab story), In the US (see stories about recalls in US) and now China (see stories about Tesla risks wearing out welcome in China). Now there are even reports that highlight the (long known) fact that Tesla has been hyping their range. Now there is serious competition and it is growing rapidly just as the 'wow' factor for Tesla is wearing off. What will be interesting to watch is when the same 'wow' factor wears off on the share price. Of course a move from $900 to $800 isn't really a sign of that yet, but a break down to $600 or $500 would be a pretty serious outcome.The lack of profits and declining margins on growing sales was a warning shot. When sales start to stabilize and profits still don't show up, well, investors may take notice. (And when I say investors, I don't mean day traders and swing traders. I mean investors who are buying into the idea that Tesla has some sort of magic battery or secret cool factor.These things only last so long . . . In Europe's top markets, Tesla had 10% share last quarter, and while the data for this quarter is way, way too early, Tesla currently makes up just 2.5% of the market. No one company has to be better than Tesla when 9 out of every 10 EVs is sold by other companies. The number of models (and companies) is growing rapidly and Tesla laid the foundation for that sea change.Good luck with your decisions, but the bloom may be off the rose.Guru."
still of all EVs this Tesla is unbeatable
Shorts are desperate now! Must be thinking how to get out of debt!TSLA to $1000 next week!

Here come the Buys! going up up up
a very serious question for Mr Musk.... the question is.... at what price target would the board of directors consider a stock split.... there are obvious reasons where a split would create a huge opportunity for the stock valuation... at $1000 a split of 10 for1 would put the stock at $100. The stock would appeal to a greater amount of investors and would keep the momentum at a sustained pace... never hurts to ask.. the seed has been planted...
"Almost up, eh?"

"According to Reuters, Tesla's board of directors is seeking more information from CEO Elon Musk about the finance for his plan to take the U.S. electric car maker private.And here is the punchline: While Tesla's board has held multiple discussions about the proposal - as it documented in its statement on Wednesday - it has ""not yet received a detailed financing plan from Musk and specific information on who will provide the funding.""if the board has no idea where the funding is coming from, there is no way it could have signed off on it, thereby ""securing it"", which means that all else equal, Musk's tweet that sent the stock price soaring was a fabrication."
"Tesla shareholders have one new big worry: when will ARK dispose of shares to pay for withdrawal of funds? Make no mistake, Ms. Wood is a huge player with $47 billion under management and a large TSLA position. ARK funds are down 23% in the last two weeks."

TSLA longs might take a look at the GME Conversations. There the pump and dumpers are also urging the bag holders to hold on. Look at the GME stock price and envision the same thing happening to TSLA. Do you really want to see 75% of positions value vanish in a week? It could happen because TSLA valuation is based on nothing but hype.
Honest question. Can anyone give an example of a higher priced company with as much competition as Tesla has right behind? The valuation is absurd. A bubble stock if I've ever seen one. Or am I not seeing some big picture?

"Buy a Tesla. Order the $10,000 FSD option with click of button. Tesla turns it on also at with the click of a button. Tesla has already written the FSD program that’s sitting in their computers. Other than normal updated improved versions they have little or no cost providing the already coded program. Their markup for this software sale is now huge. Now what business is Tesla in? It makes awesome BEVs at a much lower margin. But it makes far more profit for the dollars invested selling options and applications. Think they know where the money is for them with this business plan. Can’t blame them for that. This is one thing that makes investors and others wonder what business Tesla is in. Smart company."
Tesla shorts when it finally falls more than 30%
I'm invested in Tesla but I still don't understand how is this stock still moving up so much? 3% up in premarket and literally trading 190x its P/E ratio..
Could tesla break all time highs today?
"max pain for Friday's big ( quarterly) expiration has now moved down to $275. As such I think that it is more than likely that the stock will lose momentum this week at prices higher than $275. Next week, with so much happening is going to be , of course, very interesting , to say the least. But currently the max pain is lining up to be $270. (april 26 expiry)."

"To show how overvalued Tesla is (and yes they are a great company with a visionary leader) let’s compare this to the biggest company in the world, Apple (who also had a visionary leader in Steve Jobs). In 07, Apple released their first touchscreen iPhone. They climbed to a market cap of 175B, while making close to 35B in revenue. Their P/E ratio at that time was less than 40 and they were trading around 6x sales. Fast forward to 9/2012, Apple reached a market cap of 650B (after 5 whole years and before crashing down to 365B) while making 156B in revenue with a p/e of about 12. In comparison, Tesla is expected to close out this year on 31B of revenue, while it has a market cap of close to 850B, trading close to 30x sales and has a p/e close to 1700!! This makes Tesla 5x (500%) more overvalued than what the biggest company in the world was when they released their most innovative product. Then, everything else that’s going on with the economy. People losing their jobs (unemployment at historic highs), small businesses closing left and right and last week they were expecting 70k jobs to get added to payroll, but instead 120k jobs were reduced. I get the market is forward looking but it must be looking 2+ years ahead these days and for Tesla, 5+ years ahead. Yes this will likely be a 1T+ company and bigger down the road, but with 100% certainty, they are wayyyy too ahead of their time. A crash is certain (for the whole market) but who knows when. I’ll stay on the sidelines in the meanwhile. The only thing driving this crazy market (especially this stock) is fear of inflation, FOMO and stimulus (not fundamentals). Just look at all of FAANG stocks and compare historic P/E ratios to this year. I see some people saying p/e is something created from way back when, well news for you, it’s not going away and reality is going to hit sooner than later."

"This could easily go back to the sub $500 dollar range, but if it does I can guarantee it won't be there long. It could also have a huge recover any day now. I was kicking myself when I sold at $675, but now I'm kind of glad I did. I'll be a buyer probably anywhere in the 400's."

"How long can Ark keep injecting $140m daily in this stock and what will happen to the price when they can no longer do it?It's still down over 20% from the highs despite over $1bn Ark intervention.

It's becoming like the whole stockmarket now, i.e. if Fed stops printing and injecting $trillions it tanks. Except Cathie isn't the Fed."
"Looking at past expections vs actuals. Wall Street analysts were usually over optimistic on results. Only 2 qtrs of the last 10, did Tesla beat."
LOL TSLA shorties probably thought their dreams were coming true yesterday morning. Into the close yesterday and throughout today they've been burned massively. Keep insulting the longs like me who still have most of your money and keep shorting it more and giving us more of your money. The fact some of you would throw away your life savings to see this stock go down is absolutely astonishing. Even if TSLA were to crash it still wouldn't even go near the March lows of last year. Keep dreaming of your mansion in Beverly Hills while longs actually earn the money to buy one.
"shorts are coming out of the wood works, must be about time to buy?"
We need cash for clunkers again.
"Below $190 it would not make financial sense to issue a secondary to raise funds for continuing operations and debt servicing, even for Tesla.Since bond issuance is quickly becoming impractical, the stock needs to stay well above $200 to still be a viable source of funds.Fact is that Tesla's existence is currently dependent on its stock price.My estimate for cash available at end of Q1 is for just under 2.9 billion. If they can't or just don't raise funds by end of Q2, cash available would then be below 2.0 billion."
Why are longs so happy??I thought that $1000 per share was a certainty.
after market $750!
700 tomorrow....the valuation is fraud ...a Ponzisystem.Watch michael burry.... he explains the bubble as MASSIVLY overvalued exaggeration and went short.
I expect a big pop in the stock today after hiring Stuart Bowers. I think he was responsible for that new mango flavored tea at Snapple.
"The inventory issue will be the final nail in the financial coffin. Let’s examine the 114 X/S sitting in inventory in Canada. Right now they are Finished Goods on the Tesla Balance Sheet as at end of Q3.., now, it is highly probable that Tesla will have to offer significant discounts to move that inventory.Remember, this is a company desperate to raise cash due to pending debt obligations. Having a $130k cdn car ( $100k Usd) sitting in some parking lot in Canada does nothing to raise cash. Rather, they drop the price through discounts to monetize the car and raise cash, but take a loss on the car ( Hurts GAAP earnings)The Balance Sheet is overstated... the inventory is too high and only way to move cars quickly is to incent people. Tax credits are gone ( Ontario) or are dropping off quickly due to Tesla hitting 200K mark for US tax credits.., a perfect storm against Tesla profits.I would really appreciate others on this thread going out to their local Tesla store, look at Model 3 and S/X inventory available through the sales reps Tesla system ( just say you want a car within 2 weeks or so.. they’ll show you inventory)Also, I plan to keep watching for the first October production Model 3 to land in Toronto. Then, by asking enough customers when they ordered the Model 3, we can get a sense of whether Tesla is still filling backlog, or now filling very short term orders.Once I see only September or October orders being delivered, I know backlog is exhausted, then, by counting new deliveries per week we get a good sense of ongoing Model 3 demand. My intuition and the fact there are 33 inventory Model 3s in Toronto available for sale ( I could have one in 5 business days if I found one that I liked the combo of FWD/AWD, colour and wheels, I could have it by next Friday! ). That means either:1. Previous customers have walked away from their orders ( probably due to loss of Ontario tax credits)2. Tesla is keeping production numbers > actual demand and building inventory.., most people look at weekly production numbers and ASSUME that means that is equal to actual demand... what if Tesla now building cars in excess of actual orders ( like most car companies do).., big difference is Tesla does not have financial strength to play the inventory holding game!!!! Anyway, Canada and Toronto does not tell the whole picture. Dallas was a partial corroboration of my findings. If others can gather info from their local Tesla store ( take an hour or two o time), a bigger picture will emerge.I am a short via Puts. But I gather real data to confirm or refute my thesis. So far, my thesis about inventory seems to be on point!"

"Tesla claims it can sell every car it can make (still production constrained, I see) so let's pass a taxpayer funded bill that hands $7,000 to the next 400,000 Tesla buyers, with no limit on MSRP. The new Roadster may now only cost $243,000. Plaid Model S? A mere $113,000 (after savings). I'm so glad we aren't wasting these taxes on the unkept masses."
Good to see the TSLA stock turn around and have a nice uptrend move up. Avoid the noise. The price will increase.
"So in April, having grown disillusioned with my MJ stocks, I liquidated them all and purchased 750 shares of TSLA with the intent of making a few dollars once the market corrected from COVID. Then, thanks to a fortuitous split and an ever increasing market, my wife and I have now been blessed to enjoy a realm of financial stability that certainly came quicker than expected!!As I mentioned on here a few weeks ago, when the stock hit $675 it triggered a sell order of 400 shares which has enabled me to pay off my parents home and allow them a worry free retirement. True I’ve not been ‘long’ for many years like some, and call it dumb luck or karma, but I am fortunate to now call myself a Teslanaire. I now believe in Tesla as a long play and have no intention of selling any other shares. With this I wish everyone a Happy New Year and for those fortunate enough to have enjoyed this insane ride, congrats!! "

I believe this morning's drop shook off a lot of weak hands. Especially hands of people who probably bought @ 745-845. They were trying to save their small profit or avoid margin calls.
Why Tesla will go to $2000+. Tesla makes its own battery. While the other EV just make the cars. Battery is very important. Without it what is the use of an EV car?? Tesla can rent battery for exorborant amount to add on to their EV !

"New Year Greeting from your friend - a TSLA long term investor:Hello shorts, Greetings, Happy New year. Just want to say hello on this new year from the West Coast. I have been doing some reflection in the new year day, and I have some conclusions about my personal life, as well as my investments including TSLA stocks. And I just would like to share with you some of my reflections because it is related to you ladies/gentlemen who is shorting TSLA. I punderstand why you are upset after such a record year in all fronts for TSLA, a record breaking business results, stock at all time high, stock price x7 in one year, largest shorting loss ever. Please understand, we long term investors have not done anything intentional to make you upset. We have invested in a good stock, and it's been good to us, and we just try our best to defend the stock we own with what we consider as fake new and stories.I have heard all kinds of name calling toward me: cult members, greedy, immoral, fat pig get slaughtered...etc. Let me tell you something, It just won't work. As I have said over and over again, I am so much in the money I have enough capital strength to ride out the peak and valley. Why don't you guys stop trying to save me from myself. I would really appreciate it.Have a great happy new year! Instead of spending all days and nights bashing TSLA and its shareholders, why don't you spend some quality time with your family, relax, get some exercise, eat well, walk your dog so he/she does not feel neglected, and contribute to our GDP in a positive manner.Last but not least, do not bet against TSLA. As the previous shorting efforts have resulted in record loss which I will not reiterate here."
Remember guys.... TSLA always goes up!... never down... because that's how stocks work.
Man this stock is a hot mess. bawhahahaha. can anything go right
"Congrats to all the Tesla stock owners who have gotten rich off the stock. Sadly I was way too late to the game. To those future owners who are going to get destroyed when this stock collapses, I offer my condolences to you ahead of time. Everyone one of you knows that you can not make a rational, logical reason why Tesla should be above $300. Even $200 is stretching it. Though Tesla is the main game in town if you want an EV today, in 5 years that will not be the case. Consumers will have dozens and dozens of alternative models from Europe, Asia, and the US to choose from that fit their tastes. Even if Tesla remains the number 1 brand for EV, the odds of it taking more than even 20% of the market share is small. So ride the wave up but be careful. I admit these levels make me too scared even to entertain buying Tesla. Sure it might go up $1000 more in the next 6 months. The house could collapse in a few months down to $400. I will look try mining my riches elsewhere."
I Expect a Lot of Volatility With Tesla.
"Why is this down? A $20 million shareholder dilution and another top executive departure? We used to go up $50 on bad news, $80 on good news. What's going on?"
"Just like crossing $500 and $600, there will be one or two sub $700 days before the next leg up, Of course, the shorts will giggle like schoolgirls and post non-sense, but the direction of TSLA is clear! Happy New Year Tesla Heads!!"
more shorts are covering every minute
All i see is empty charging stations and so few actually driven on the roads that i can count them in one hand.With such an inflated stock price i guess anything is possible but I don;t have buy into this possible scheme?
10 to 1 Split announcement soon. Since 5 to 1 didn't last so long.
Is the company still profitable if the government ends the EV credits?

"When the bubble pumps more and more, stranger explainations appear. When it passed all other car companies in the world, with a fraction of the world production you said IT IS NOT A CAR COMPANY! Now you say the Tesla share is not a share, its an asset against printing dollar or inflarion. I think now even the hardest bulls have run out of arguments to protect this ponzi scheme. Prepare for a bubble burst not seen before in history since tulip mania."
"We can finally see why Elon Musk has pumped out propaganda for Dogecoin, it is to remove focus from Bitcoin so he can buy more!"
"Thanks to FED, Oil price is skyrocketing. Inflation is skyrocketing now.The US Government has PUMPED Oil prices by 300% in the last 3 months, artificially, DESPITE SHRINKING Demand and Exponentially rising supply.Enjoy Free Capital gains without working!$XOM $JPM $TSLA"
who smokes and drink more? elon musk or tsla longs?
"Tesla has better manufacturing. The giga press eliminates many parts and robots, and produces a better product. They also have an unassailable lead in driving data and, apparently, better software. They are already entirely EV so they don't have the expense of converting over to it from ICE. To make EVs mainstream and capture market share, you have to make it affordable. Tesla's competitors are either more expensive, or unsafe."
I think the scary thing is that people still think there's significant value in this companies stock despite the absurd valuation. WE KNOW TESLA HAS VALUE BUT FFS THAT DOES NOT MAKE THEIR STOCK ANY LESS OF A BIG GIGANTIC BUBBLE. Unfortunately the retail investor will be the one that pays as that is the rules of the market. Today marks the end of index buying as I put on Friday when it dipped below that 5 day VWAP. This will be trading for real now in the S&P the monstrous rally of the past few weeks was index buying. I can imagine there will be tonnes of profit taking but of course who won't be profit taking? Most retail investors. Enjoy the slide.

NO SURPRISE THIS FREAKING STOCK IS IN THE RED AGAIN TODAY. DOESN'T LOOK GOOD FOR EARNINGS>
"From Tesla's recent 10Q:Changes in operating assets and liabilities for last six months:Accounts receivable decreased by $98 millionInventories decreased by $1 billion Customer deposits increased by $42 million Accounts receivable INCREASED by $900 millionThey are not paying their bills. Their AP sits at just over $3 BILLION. The only way Tesla becomes profitable and cash flow positive is if AP increases by about $500 million for this quarter. And in case someone is not able to look it up, AR is at just over $550 million, about 1/6 of their AP."
When things go back to normal our stress will be gone and will not need to watch the stock on daily base. I know next week is very critical for all longs and short term investors. Lets all pray everything will be alright
"The TSLA stock is trading very erratically in premarket. Up, down & back up."

Who will write the Mars Constitution?Or will it be monarchy? If so, who will be the Monarch? Or will it be Putism, like the Russian system under Putin? Will you be the Martian Putin?"
Wonder how the battery charging in Texas is going. A real eye opener for buying an EV.
"This is the most irrationally exuberant market I've ever seen in half a century, and Tesla is the Poster Boy of this irrationality. The Teslas, Snowflakes, Shopifys, Carvanas, DoorDashes and AirBNb's of the world, along with the SPACs and Bitcoin, are powering on momentum alone, and when it disappears, as it will...rapidly...look out below. In my opinion, will be sudden and fast."

"Tesla & Panasonic update:“Both Tesla and Panasonic continue to invest substantial funds into Gigafactory. That said, we believe there is far more output to be gained from improving existing production equipment than was previously estimated. We are seeing significant gains from upgrading existing lines to increase output, which allows Tesla and Panasonic to achieve the same output with less spent on new equipment purchases. However, we will, of course, continue to make new investments in Gigafactory 1, as needed. Most importantly, contrary to what is implied in this report, our demand for cells continues to outpace supply. It remains the fundamental constraint on Tesla vehicle and Powerwall/Powerpack production,” Tesla said."

"So yesterday I was at a mall in Denver and I drove right by a Tesla Charging Kiosk/Station, I was floored! Never had seen it before, so not sure how long it had been there, but it looked cool and there were 6 Tesla's sitting in it. Those car's looked sexy, especially the black one's with tinted windows. I own the stock and have done well with it, but now after seeing that and being in the market for a new car I am considering buying a Tesla. I was considering buying something this summer but maybe i will wait and get on the waiting list, this charging station is very close to my office so it would be cool to go get lunch with some coworkers and charge the car while we eat!I'm sold, you would be too if you saw what the station looked like, cool branding, filled with Tesla's, convenient location, the list goes on and on!"

"Let me get this straight. All other EV stocks are down while Tesla is up 3x as much as the S&P; higher than pre-earnings miss, when the only news is that they will have to pay for replacing computer chips on a lot of their cars. Makes perfect sense."

TESLA $10.5B>GM
$263 a share on September 7 2018. This has been designed from the beginning to rob retail of its few remaining percent. Nothing will happen to Elon. Him not running Tesla is tge most severe penalty 100% of these cases are handled with a plea to a lesser charge. Its sad.
Many many listed traded companies remain inBusiness reverse split after reverse split formore than 30 years ! Tesla will remain in business ; ) to !
Can Elon Musk still run TSLA while he is in jail?
The stimulus will pass next week and we should see new money pouring in soon.
"Although I'm long-term bullish on Tesla, I'm not going to sit here and lose a good portion of my 120% gain. I had considered placing a trailing stop loss (just hadn't done it yet) but after today's activity, placed a stop limit at $805 earlier. If it doesn't go that low, we're good. If we see a correction and it sells at $805, I've proected a 101% gain. I can see it going lower so I'm happy. People lose a lot of money because of greed. I'm not going to be one of them."
"Investor's Business Daily is a reliable resource for market news and analysis of stock charts. IBD says that Tesla has just experienced a climax run. In trading just last week alone the stock is up 25% or $175. In the last 4 weeks it's up from about $600 to $880. Yes, by definition that's a climax run, which is doomed to correct substantially. It's not just the chart; competition is and will be continue to be a major headwind . There are a lot of EV players in China, and then you have VW and other US car companies. There's absolutely no barrier to entry in this space. Tesla sells low margin cars, and their profit is based on regulatory credits. A correction to $650-$675 may be reasonable for starters."
"I'm systematically making my way through the Piper Sandler 100-pg report. It is full of inaccuracies and wildly optimistic guesses. When I bring some of these to light, the Tesla bulls claim I'm ""cherry-picking"". So I can't address it generally, but I can't pull out relevant mistatements bc those are cherry picked.Btw, Alex Potter is a ""transportation technology"" analyst. Why is he making projections about energy, insurance, etc.?"

"Every defense of TSLA relies on a view of the future that is extremely unlikely - namely, that Musk will successfully execute on his stated initiatives. Totally aside from whether those initiatives are going to be good business opportunities, we have to ask if Elon Musk is competent enough as a business executive to deliver on them. High executive turnover is the single biggest evidence that he can't get it done, IMO. A good team can make almost anything work, but TSLA is a monoculture focused on Musk rather than the customer. Holding puts."
"Tesla registers more than 6k new Model 3 VINs, estimated ~100% dual motor AWDhttps://www.teslarati.com/tesla-6k-new-model-3-dual-motor-awd-vins/"

"With the DOW and the NAS up significantly today, the cult is giddy even gay-er than usual although justifiably shocked that tesla found a life saver and gained some buoyancy after walking the plank with the weight of its abysmal financial results and the insane never before seen behavior under logical if not softball questions about what musk himself said the future of tesla depends on,....Edsel 3 production,... of the Chief Excrement Officer Enron Musk.Unfortunately for the cult, this is a temporary condition because everyone knows tesla -1. has designed an un-easily manufacturable vehicle (and will never sustain 5000 Edsel 3's per week) and/or2. has even less demand for the $60K ""car for the masses"" than there has been for the S and/or X (so even if tesla could produce 5000/Edsel 3's per week, they'd have to rent a place to store them) and/or3. loses over $25,000 on each and every car it produces.There are no other options.musk's behavior in the CC confirms this.And tesla can only hide it for one more qtr, then it's last man turn the lights out."

"Controlled selling going on folks, smart money coming out through the back door (don't try to be a hero and catch a falling knife). Goldman was hired to help with restructuring the balance sheet.

Of course there will be massive dilution to current shareholders."
"""Tesla buying $1.5 billion in bitcoin opens the company up to further scrutiny""It's like buying a derivative of a derivative.

"I don’t like posting on these sites, but I feel that the report on TSLA is wrong. Sales were good. Profit was down and missed the so called numbers BUT if you dive deeper into the numbers money is being spent on plant expansion and new plants. Tsla bought land that is full of lithium for battery production, new semi truck, research for new products and new plants in Berlin , texas and China. They are doing the same thing AMZN did reinvest in more of the parts to build the company and take market share now rather than future ahead of the competition"
"Can Tesla afford all the lawyers it needs for all the investigations? Not just SEC but worker safety, labor, traffic safety, transportation safety, solar city bail out fraud, supplier lawsuits etc."
"Say you bought Tesla at 110 and despite all the bad news of debt, non production, battery problems etc, you still feel good because your statement reflects a huge capital gain. The question that should be troubling you is on what date you will hear the inevitable coming announcement that ""Public trading has been halted on Tesla stock as the company announces a ""voluntary"" reorganization in Federal court"". Regardless of the price of your stock at the time, it will soon be worth next to nothing. When bankruptcy comes it will be sudden, unannounced in advance, and devastating to common stock holders."
Buy now! Will be last chance when lunch is over. After that there will be a run to 1k prior to earnings. After earnings it could pop to somewhere between. 1100-1200

"Not sure anyone is realizing how big it is that Tesla is about to go into India. If they get big in India and China, as well as they are in the US, then this could actually solve the pollution problem created by internal combustion engines and gas pollutants."

"Taking a gander at Tesla's 7-seat Model Y. Somebody call Child Protection Services! So cute how Tesla revised the description of this $3,000 torture device from ""7-Adults"" to ""7-Persons"".

"Lost in the euphoria of the zealot screaming about 95,000 deliveries are few more realities they all refuse to recognize:1. There is no more ""big picture"". That evaporated long ago. What's left is a mad scramble to cobble out some kind of story, any story, acceptable to the followers...no matter how far-fetched it might be.2. Losses now stand, halfway through the year, at OVER $1.1 Billion. With the summer upon us, historical sales in the auto industry begin to slump. Making money, even break-even, is impossible, no matter how many games. In fact, Tesla is pacing to set the record for he worst loss year in history at over $2BILLION!3. This is a whopper! Tesla sales after 2 quarters stands at 158,000. That means to reach the lower hurdle of 360,000 deliveries, Tesla will need to average, AVERAGE 101,000 sales each of the last two 2 quarters of the year.

"Can't believe I bought $TSLA at 420 (symbolic purchase) but no regrets moving most of my portfolio into $NIO a month ago. I think it's reasonable to expect Nio to double well before Tesla does. I also don't like how Elon is so distrustful of hydrogen cell tech - calling them 'fool cells' is juvenile. Li batteries will be in passenger cars for years to come, but industrial/commercial/transport tech will be moving increasingly towards hydrogen cell tech like $PLUG. The competition is coming for you Elon. Your reliability issues and lack of profitability is scaring away long-time investors."
Is there a point at which TSLA is considered overvalued? Or does it have infinite value? Valuation is approaching 5% of GDP.

"Once again, we have been treated to excessive exuberance as this story unwinds. From the board down, players at the company have offered themselves to liability beyond imagination, possible prison sentences and real indications that TSLA is a house of cards. There is no such thing as a private company with thousands of stockholders avoiding disclosure laws, undisclosed $70 billion secured financing for a company with negative net worth that is plowing through cash is a pipe dream, and every share that traded on this tweeted news both sell and buy will be in question. For your next chapter read the revised 10Q filed today as the board attempts to squirm out from under the scandal. Finally, examine the depth of the short interest in TSLA and ponder if they are all naive day traders."

"People really need to take a deeper look at our electric grid when discussing EVs. Many of our grids do not have enough capacity to support widespread EV use at the local level, especially in older neighborhoods. If one or two people per street have an EV then that’s no problem, but in many locations there is not enough capacity to support everyone on the street charging an EV at the same time (as TSLA investors seem to believe will happen based on the share price). The electrical distribution system was not designed for this and it hasn’t been a problem so far. The transformers and wires were sized using something called a “diversity factor” - an assumption that not everyone would be using full power at the same time. Go take a look outside your house if you live in a city/subdivision and have an overhead power line supplying your street. If the secondary (low voltage) wires are the size of an extension cord and there is a 50kVA transformer feeding 10+ houses, then the infrastructure is not sufficient to support widespread EV use at your local level. This means $100s of thousands of dollars in upgrades would be required on your street if all your neighbors decided to switch to EVs. This would be a massive undertaking."
"Can someone please help me understand where to look for pre-market Monday expectations can be found? Specifically, Mike below stated CNBC at bid ask $165 - $171 and Fidelity $159 - $167. Thank you very much!"
"In the early 1900's, at one point there were 1900 different car companies, producing over 3,000 models. With the EV evolution, new companies are popping up overnight (Fisker, Canoo). EV vehicles, due to their modular nature, are not to dissimilar to that of the built-at-home PCs of the early 2000's. Buy the parts, assemble, load software, and voila! Buy a skate board (chassis), battery, slap on a body, and you're the next Tesla (first Roadster was a rebranded Lotus). Styling, Configuration, Software, and Price, will be the differentiating factors. Margins will be LOW, and most start ups will fail. But all them will cut into Tesla's market share, another reason why I believe TSLA's current valuation is unjustified."
Don’t sell guys it will go to $800 by Thursday momentum is super high for Tesla right now
"Speaking of capitulation, Morgan Stanley's math on Tesla teases out $3,000 per share, a few hours ago today. I say $9966 in 6 years! My math: 50% growth rate announced in TSLA earning call last week for the future years, then 1.5^6 = 11.39. 11.39* 875=$9966."

"Just returned to balmy Detroit after a 3-week hiatus in Tucson. I was amazed on the growth of this metropolitan area since last visit (two decades ago). I kept wondering how the residents keep cool in the summer (late spring and early fall also). The growth of America's Southwest, combined with the migration from ICE to BEV as our primary mode of transportation, will only perpetuate our glutenous thirst for electricity. You can hear it already starting, the whispering of the forbidden ""N""-word. (No, not that one).A grid powered primarily by Nuclear power. The windmills are cute and all (the pig in the insurance commercial)and solar farms are oh so shiny, but they will never be able to keep up with our insatiable demand for power. Sure hope you don't think replacing the light bulbs in your basement to LEDs will save humanity. If Tesla's (and other's) goal of a near 100% electrification of transportation reaches fruition, there is only one solution. Be careful what you ask for, or at least understand the trade off and consequences."

Volkswagen EV sales will probably be very close to TSLA this year and will surpass next year. BTW did you see Audi e-tron GT? It looks much better than Taycan IMO. TSLA has to go down at least 80% from current level and yet will be super expensive.I know I know Tesla is ""not"" a car company - blah blah blah! It's a Bitcoin gambling company.

Just take a look at the # of shares trades in the past 6 weeks and and what price levels. take comfort in that, but do buckle up for the ride.for the newbs in here - don't listen to the doomsayers on this board, I've been holding 4 years through each and every 'dip' or 'correction' and the trend is your friend, always has been for me.by the same token - there's a lot of irrational superpump in here with no backup just pure exuberance. Wait for Elon's 2021 guidance - he hit his 2020 guidance. They'll produce and I bet deliver better than a million cars this year, imo. And by the end of 2021, they'll have capacity in place to produce probably 1.5 million or better in 2022. Just my opinion. Cheers!"

To develop a heavier open interest at that strike, and then maybe they hope to kill those options there on Friday. So maybe they expect a big jump tomorrow and then a sell off on Thursday and Friday?I can't be sure. What I am Certain of is that the Tutes are not going to be sleeping on this. They know what people are expecting, nothing is going to be a surprise, so I'm sure they are arming themselves with the tools to take everyone's money. Especially the retail investor that can't afford to play long term. I can see that the Price is trying to be 775 even AH."

"What is happening here is easily understandable, so let me explain it to you quickly: GME and AMC have been creating massive losses for funds, forced to cover their short (lol). To balance their losses, they have had to close their long time positions like those ones on Tesla, bringing down the price. But this is only a drop in the ocean. Tesla is strong and will only need a few hours, if not days to climb back up, and remain even tougher than before. ""Deceiving"" earnings won't bring it down, Tesla is still a leader, has massive market shares in batteries, and, because no one is talking about it, just introduced the new model S and X. Those new cars are not only better looking (inside and outside), they also have longer range (from 628km to 840km autonomy for the higher version), a top speed of 320km/h for the Model S Plaid +, and 0-100 in just 2.1 seconds. Their cars will destroy the competitors, and its only about time that Tesla reaches a price of 1k per share. So hold long my friends, trading is about future, and Tesla is the future!"

"This got us thinking about Tesla's $1.8bn of high yield bonds, maturing in August 2025. Last time Alex Scaggs checked on their health in May, it didn't look too pretty -- the debt was trading at 88 cents on the dollar in the secondary market, suggesting the so-called smart money of Wall Street foresaw a dim future for Tesla.Given the renewed optimism in the equity, we'd expect the bonds to follow, seeing as bondholders have primacy over shareholders when it comes to claims on Tesla's future cash flows.This week however, the bonds have not followed suit, despite roughly tracking the equity over the past month."
"Well Musk survived another challenge to his suitability to head TSLA. He shouldn't rest easy though, he is still being scrutinized for his operational capabilities to produce the model 3 in quantity and quality at a margin sufficient to generate a profit. I don't see that happening since Musk is much better suited for the role of visionary/DQ where he is not accountable for delivering on his promises. And unlike previous years, there has been no letting him off the hook to deflect away from delivering on the M3. It remains to be seen whether TSLA can either produce the M3 in quantity(maybe) AND generate margins sufficient to generate bottom line profitability (doubtful). Right now it is concerning that TSLA shows no signs of being able to be a low cost producer of the model 3."
"This is my general feeling regarding the Market and TSLA. Regardless of what earning are for TSLA and how much it goes up TSLA and the market will return to the March low before it goes higher despite the FED's attempts to intervene. The question is will it break those lows. The reason for this is because it is becoming clear that it will not be a V-shaped recovery and that America is not clear on what it needs to pull out of this mess. We can see this as people are protesting and business are pushing to open. Because of the push to open the economy, we will likely have a second wave covid and the economy will struggle to get going. what are your thoughts?"

less than 1% up pre-market. Just after losing 3.7% the previous session and 35% over 3 weeks. And people celebrate there is change of fortunes. This is not over. Last week it opened at 2% and a sell off was triggered to plunge the stock -11% to very low 500's. Even the Nasdaq was planning to halt trading.

Advice for everyone interested to make money in the long run. Stay out of Tesla. You play with fire if you short and you sure as hell pump gas into your dormitory as long as you stay long even if it feels good it ain't good. Stay away from the casino. This is where they want to see the chickens.

We all have done that and will continue to do it if we keep playing markets. no, what I am sorry for is that you continue to fall for all of this progressive left win BS in everything not just Tesla. Read a real book on the history of the Left as it is defined today -everything they touch turn toi total disaster. not a high 5. not a large amount-everything. Like all things ""progressive' Tesla was totally dependent on government for not only financing but also penalizing the competition . Passing laws and regulations to shut out the truth so their ideas can survive. Maybe solar and EV's will make sense one day but unfortunately by having Dems and progressive forcing it long before it was ever ready or even wanted we probably moved back the possibility of it by 30 years. Read ""The road to Serfdom by F.A. Hyeck. Learn from this or continue to go down the Road to Serfdom"" that the Left always leads you to........"
"It is amazing the lengths that Tesla goes to put its customers safety at risk. First there is Autopilot, and now the refreshed Model S and Y. The car ""guesses"" what gear it should be in.

I believe in Elon Musk and his work. The dude has an extraordinary way of innovating and delivering results.

Profits margins will be narrow and missteps will be costly."

For the past year GM has outperformed TSLA by a little over 17% not counting dividends. And I thought TSLA was supposed to be some sort of super stock. Why do people continue to hold TSLA? If you are day trading that is different and you could have made a bunch of money shorting, then buying low and selling high, then shorting again. But if you have just been holding this since Sep.

"Tesla’s share of the critical European battery-electric-vehicle market crumbled in the first month of 2021, and China has taken the top spot from Europe in the EV race, according to new research.Tesla’s trajectory in Europe is in decline. The U.S. car maker delivered 1,619 battery-electric vehicles to 18 key European markets in January, representing 3.5% of all battery-electric vehicles registered that month, according to a report based on public data by automotive analyst Matthias Schmidt. In 2020, Tesla delivered 1,977 vehicles in January — more than a 5% market share.Schmidt called Tesla’s January performance “consistently low,” noting that the company’s European delivery schedule sees volumes peak at the end of each quarter. However, the analyst noted that Tesla’s 12-month rolling volumes have now fallen behind Hyundai and Kia, which are now the third-most popular EV group in Europe.The tide turned for Tesla in 2020, with Tesla dropping behind both the brands of Volkswagen Group and the alliance between Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi.Last year, Tesla made up just 13% of the European market despite a smaller proportional decline in the number of vehicles it delivered — around 10%.More broadly in January, China raced past Europe to reclaim its crown as the world’s largest market for electric vehicles. There were 179,000 battery-electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles registered in China in January, compared with 110,000 in Europe. The boost in China comes after a standout year for Europe. There were 1.33 million electric-vehicle registrations in Europe in 2020, topping 1.25 million in China, amid a pedal-to-the-metal push to increase EV adoption from European governments and supercharged demand from consumers.China is home to a strong domestic electric-vehicle sector, including manufacturers Nio, Xpeng and BYD.Schmidt’s report shows that Volkswagen Group, which manufactures VW, Audi, Skoda, Seat, and Porsche, remains the most popular battery-electric vehicle group in Europe, with more than 22% of the market share after delivering 10,193 vehicles.It is closely followed by Stellantis , a group formed earlier this year through the merger of PSA — which included Peugeot and Citroën — and Fiat Chrysler. Stellantis delivered 9,005 vehicles.Behind Stellantis is Hyundai and Kia, increasingly popular in Europe, which delivered more than 7,087 vehicles. That puts the Korean group ahead of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance, which delivered 6,018 cars, though Renault’s Zoe remained the most popular battery-electric vehicle in Europe in January.Then comes Mercedes-owner Daimler, BMW, and Volvo, which all delivered more battery-electric vehicles than Tesla in the first month of the year.Germany remained the single largest market within Europe for electric vehicles. The 16,315 battery-electric vehicles registered in the country in January were more than the totals of the next-two largest markets, France and the U.K., combined."
Thats why Elon and his brother sold
What makes this a good ER? I don't own any TSLA.
"Credits to Joe. You are correct: there was a LOT of money wasted on trying to achieve automation that just wasn't possible (or practical); at the same time, a plant HAS been built, and Tesla is producing cars. It's not any great milestone to achieve 10,000 vehicles a week at that plant; it was done years ago with far less automation (and less employees) than Tesla currently has. I see the problem -- what will drive Tesla into bankruptcy -- is that they've borrowed all sorts of money to build production capacity when there isn't enough demand; they won't be able to SELL enough vehicles to pay their debts they've taken on to build the factory."
Nio will sell well in China but will never find a big market in the west. Tesla will sell well all over the world.

"I remember when the cult said tesla deserved a $1 trillion market cap because of its ""energy buisness"" and other things like it was yesterday..............In fact it was yesterday.And speaking of yesterday, yesterday $FSLR, an $8 billion market cap company with a more normal, albeit still high, PE of 21, reported Q4 earnings, something that seems to elude tesla like two like kind magnetic poles,..........of $1.08 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.27 by 15%.Including one-time litigation losses, the company reported GAAP earnings of $1.09 per share against the GAAP loss of 56 cents recorded in the prior-year quarter.First Solar’s sales of $609.2 million in the reported quarter missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $720 million by 15.4%. Moreover, the top line plunged a massive 56.5% from the year-ago quarter’s $1,399.4 million.I mean tesla loses money on its insignificant (and for due cause) energy (aka solar panel) business,.... it loses money on its car business,.... The cult tells us every business tesla is considered to be a start up in (after 20 years of being in business), when it matures, gives them a $1 trillion market cap, and so they deserve that now... and yet when you add up the market caps of all of these (mature) businesses already doing these things, it gives a market cap of $50 to $100 billion.1/10 to 1/20th of $1 trillion.tesla has failed. It's so yesterday.It's time to say good bye to yesterday, not good buy."

"Every stock on earth has pull-back after run-ups. TSLA action has surprised me. It seems, every new high brings new short-sellers comparing with Ford, GM and 3 ton worth of data. These same guys are forced to cover by their brokerage couple days later. Short squeeze results in another spike. With more data and reasoning, short sellers initiate new short at $100 higher with conviction and HOPE for the awaited BIG DROP to $50. Rinse & Repeat. THIS SINGLE STOCK HAS CREATED VERY HAPPY PEOPLE & VERY ANGRY PEOPLE !!! (Elon is going - what did I do? ... just building cars, batteries, solar panels and space ships)"

"Lots of NIO shareholders come to $LI and $XPEV trying to convince people to sell LI and XPEV and buy NIO as if the entire market use yahoo commenting system.But let's get past the hype that seems to blow NIO shareholders minds. NIO in the presentation said that they'll use Nvidia's chip and another company's battery to make their cars even better than Tesla's cars. They avoided saying who created the battery but the battery company is Qing Tao and was confirmed at Qing Tao. At first glance it sounds great. But adopting Nvidia's chip and another manufacturer's battery means that NIO didn't produce any of these tech in-house and have no way to prevent every EV company out there from also adopting Nvidia's chip and Qing Tao's battery.Another concern is Qing Tao, up to this point, has not been able to declare that their battery works on vehicle yet. One analyst quote, ""Chinese startup Qing Tao Energy Development says it’s created the first solid-state battery production line in China, with one big caveat: Its batteries don’t work with electric vehicles (yet).""Another analyst quoted, ""Right now, they are using the batteries for “special equipment and high-end digital products”, but Nan says that they are talking to “a number of large automobile manufacturers” about using their solid-state batteries in electric vehicles.""One analyst went on to comment about the presentation, ""In this statement, NIO’s CEO William Li, didn’t choose his words carefully, he didn’t say NIO is making.. but rather NIO adopts.. This definitely indicates that NIO is simply buying the battery from a supplier (likely CATL), rather than making their own. If this is true, then the timeline of Q4 2022 for delivery of the first Solid State Battery in a car, will be heavily exposed to delays by the 3rd party.""This presentation from NIO day is a great bullish news for Nvidia. Not so much for Nio. As for other company Qing Tao, well they might never be able to release their product at all 2 years from now. Remember $QS said that they had a breakthrough and they can't release their product until 2024 at the earliest? It's not easy, and I would pick QuantumScape over Qing Tao any day.I understand NIO shareholders want to think NIO is the next $TSLA, but let's be clear. NIO is no TSLA. Not even close. TLSA would create its own chip and its own battery. That's how it prevents other EV companies from also using them."

"Tesla competitive position around world.1.> They having hard time selling and retaining 10% market share in China that they forced to export (Something Elon said not going to do at all just months ago)2.> They scared so much from new Lucid car that lower Model S price twice in two day even when Lucid car not available.3.> They only manufacture Model S/ X in Fremont plant and no plan to expand anywhere. They can't utilize 100% capacity of Model S and Model X as most not buying it anymore.4.> They are so scared from China competitor that they price Model Y way below market expectation.5.> Europe Model 3 is not NO.1 EV car anymore6.> Even Norway which has highest EV market share in EV, VW beat them with similar price ID3 (It actually bit higher as per my google search)7.> EV credit sale is only reason they have double digit gross margin and small net profit. Without EV credit Sale ( Not clear who spending billion to buy as 80% of EV sale by other manufacturers and So by that way total EV Credit worth $5B which does not add up at all)So can they manufacture 5M cars by 2030 sure. 15M cars sure why not 150M cars.Question isn't about Supply, Those problem temporary and can resolved.Question is demand. They have bit edge in technology as per Analyst estimate and yet Other Car maker already beating them in their own game ( Analyst forget other car manufaucture advantage and how they able to manufacture EV cars in large Volume (Tesla stock jump $100B like they achieve something imposible task to manufacture 500K car even after raising 10's billion dollar though new stocks) that China Tesla has 12% market share and Europo < 10% now."

"Tesla has huge advantages over traditional automakers. First, they have Musk and are years ahead in EV technology. Second, they are not burdened by legacy factories that make ICE cars and trucks.

"Pumper articles been coming in like crazy the past week. Here's a partial list, in case you missed them: 1. Tesla will probably likely maybe easily exceed 500K cars for 2020. Result: Nope.2. Tesla's china factory producing 8,000 cars per weekResult: Fake news. Tesla and Elon stated that the China factory would eventually ramp up to 3K/wk when it was built, with an initial goal of 1k/wk. Tesla has not announced any major expansions to that structure, and definitely has not tripled output from a factory designed for 3K/wk.3. Adam Jonas from MS pumped a price target for 2021 that was 10% higher than the current price was at the timeResult: He got the attention he was craving. He also did the lowest price target not too long ago to get some attention.4. Model Y 1st quarter production reportedly sold out in China. Result: That is likely to be less than 25,000 cars since production is just getting started. 5. Tesla pre-leased space in Seattle, and Amazon did too. Result: Meaningless until we learn more."

"well followers, we see that the Real Deal W , has once again supplied actionable accurate info to you. The inclusion transpired essentially spot on with my recent analysis of how it was proceeding , which, I note was given long before it unfolded. The high achieved, was of course , at the 16:00 o'clock est close, at $695, which though breathtaking on the level of the year long rally, was not hugely above the previous high on Dec 9 , of $666ish in premarket, which is VERY much in line with the parameters I had indicated. And note that after that one moment high was acheived, even before today's general market risk off event, TSLA shares traded down in postmarket on friday. I stand , very much, by the MAIN communication/analusis I have repeatedly posted in the last month or so, that sometime between the HIGHS achieved by the inclusion and the jan 15 2021 option expiration, there will be a VERY significant weight on the stock exerted by that option expiration which has HUGE open interest and and associated Total DOLLAR VALUE of the series, which is positioned to create selling pressure on the stock, at the appropriate time.........WATCH and LEARN..........................."

"US Renewables Account For 18% Of Energy Mix, Hot On The Heels Of Nuclear | CleanTechnicaRenewable energy deployment grew at a near-record pace in 2017, increasing by 14% to account for 18% of total US electricity generation, double its contribution a decade ago, and bringing it hot on the heels of the nation's nuclear energy fleet, https://cleantechnica.com/2018/02/16/us-renewables-account-18-energy-mix-hot-heels-nuclear/"
I am starting to think this is a new era of investing. Pe doesnt matter in this company. Its all about trust in Elon and his products and innovation.

dropping price helps sell low price cars to masses............ but do low priced cars make money????10x increase in stock needs 10x increase in eps......
Should I buy TESLA or is this the highest moment for TESLA?
cybermonday tesla sale.......dont miss out......sell your nio and get on the tesla train.....choo choo
Anyone that wants to argue what the other automakers are building EV's to take on Tesla kinda needs to see that mandates are the driving force not profitability. They lose money. No brainer.
Either way this would have trade at $100 for me to feel slightly concerned....
Any bank hired to give solid financial advice would look at the books and tell Tesla that Chapter 11 is the only answer.
Reading these posts are better than watching Comedy Central. The ONLY investors who buy and sell based on these posts are Robin hood traders trading fractional share.

Advice to shorts: try to short cheap stock such as Apple or Amazon that is 3600 stock before split( as we speaking now) just give it and save the rest of your money to buy groceries lol
"Model 3 Production is going great, says Musk. Oh, btw, and I just fired my VP of Model 3 Production."
"9 months ago in March this year, Tesla traded at $400s before split which $80s a share per today's calculation, that was when everyone panic about Tesla missing production or went BK. Find me one internet promoter that has my vision. Not even Katharine Woods at that time.

Tesla files lawsuit against cnbc for false news - suit 1.7b the amount the stock fell when that news came out.
"There is no ""EV-Revolution"" $Tsla (Elon) is a freak stealing billions of dollars like trevor Milton while sinking some of the money into an already failing upscale process. Exploding cars, bad service, blaming customers, ugly design tin can like quality, thats testla. Old manufacturers will easily catch up with this company cause there is nothing unique to make entering the key business severe or impossible. And it is the quiet similar same case with $Xpev, $li, $kndi, $fsr, $lucid ($cciv) etc.This Tulip mania based on future expections for companys which will not exist. Never exist, because there is no demand for this kind of products. These companies are especially in china LUCKY because of the Subsidies. But we are about to enter a new episode in China with less subsidies and more need to Demand created through intrinsic motivation - the normal behaviour of humans.Only $NIO works on this issue, only $NIO is creating right before our eyes a whole new industry to create the demand with intrinsic motivation through building a big intrinsic brand value, a lifestyle Brand with many products beside of the EV aspect and a lifestyle brand many services beside of the ev aspect with building battery as a service industry, an autonomic drive as a service industry, a safety as a service industry - quite similar to ADAC in Europe and and and ....what do the others? Selling trash, compared to $NIO and once the demand in china is not statecontrolled anymore, NIO will outpoint its unique position on all spheres in this run. Even old manufacturers who trying to catchup with the ev startups will have to rethink their strategy in case of NIO because all of this things NIO is doing are cumulated the reinvention of the driving expirience quite similar to how steve jobs changed the world with the smartphone revolution. Dont blame me like many of you freaks now when the cliff fall of all of your stocks begins to remaining again while NIO remains standing strong and rising unlike the others."
"So if Elon is selling out his properties, cashing out billions and parking it in his accounts while his Company is still bleeding, what does it tell you? Elon said that his company was overvalued at the 200 dollars range after so many splits and the stock got propped up by Wall Street to over $600. What do you call it now? He has sold and packed his bank account with billions when we are facing a massive depression ."
"Good Morning, Tesla will hit 900$ very soon "
"On Tesla forum today a man related that his wife was hit from behind on the highway. Her Model 3 shut down immediately, and display said ""Cannot maintain vehicle power"". The brakes stopped working so the car could not be stopped before it hit a wall and another car. The airbags didn't work either and she was injured. His wife is too scared to ever drive a Tesla again. This is serious. Is Anybody willing to risk family in one of these cars? Safest car ever?"
Is it going to $900 today?$1200 by Jan 29?
Anyone selling TSLA right now is a DONKEY
"All I can say is bravo to tsla and the longs. The PR nightmare and narrative going around is so compelling I bought puts twice but I covered twice in two weeks at a loss. Someone, a market maker or Elon himself or some backers + general belief amongst boards of musketeers is keeping this thing alive, and I think that also translates to marketability, and real value, a company like volkswagon would buy in for the reach alone. I think these valuations —while far too high— will be sustained so long as the stock market is performing as it has been. If there’s ever a major downturn while this thing isn’t profitable, it could see sub $100 again, but for now I’m not touching this again!!!"
"So said I sold 350 puts last Wednesday for 400% profit, and not today for 1080% :("
Anyone have a pre market quote for TSLA?
Congrats to tesla on all its 2020 achievements and it’s miracles growth!
fisker is winner!
Tesla will be the first car company to have a presence on Mars so it deserves the highest valuation on Earth.
Tsla price target raised to $1036 from 436.. Oppenheimer..just now..lol.lol
"This can't be good!...............Tesla shares fall after Needham downgrades to sell, citing huge increase in Model 3 cancellationsTesla shares fell on Thursday after Needham & Co downgraded the stock to sell from hold, citing a doubling in Model 3 cancellations.""Based on our checks, refunds are outpacing deposits as cancellations accelerate,"" wrote analyst Rajvindra Gill in the note Thursday. ""The reasons are varied: extended wait times, the expiration of the $7,500 credit, and unavailability of the $35k base model."""
"TSLA longs are still sitting on very nice profits……..I suspect devotion to Mr. Musk will cause much of the TSLA ""fan base"" to ride share price back to a loss in the not too distant future"
Bitcoin investment is certainly out-of-mind move. I would be surprised if the stock is still green at the closing. Expecting the stock puling back just for this move.
"tsla looks good for the long run ... Elon looks very comfortable. We don't really know tsla will be up or down; however, if i have to take a chance, I like to be on his side. Not all eggs in one basket, but willing to put 20% of my asset at the moment and will adjust to what is appropriate. Looks like tsla could break 400 before yr end. happy trading and good luck to all."
you guys should thank me that I am not buying :)) I bought 3 times and it went down very badly
"""Tesla’s sales in the U.S. are gaining on BMW and other luxury car makers"""
TSLA is bitcoin and bitcoin is TESLA.... same people promote it... same people buy it... the music will stop.
Surely with the stock price drop a few shorts could afford a Model 3 by now.

PEOPLE: the more TSLA bashers you see on this board only CONFIRMS you are investing in the RIGHT company. Your CONVICTION is spot on. The bashers are shills and they are worried MASSIVE disruption is coming. HOLD!!!!
"I do not own tsla and I think the market cap is extremely high, however kudos to musk for manufacturing in the USA with new giga factory being built in Austin. More power to them if they keep building cars using USA labor and materials"
Elon posted on Twitter the battery assembly line in Texas
"Nio sells ok cars and the coming ET7 is mostly vaporware at this point. Nio will never achieve much market outside of China, Just like Xpeng hasnt. Tesla does and will continue to dominate EV sales around the world."
We can all spit shine this stock up but it aint worth its current price. It wont be worth it for many many years. You all made Elon very rich so he can now work on his Space program.
Congrats to all my fellow longs! Time to celebrate - have a wonderful weekend and please stay safe!
Tesla’s decade!
Alot of people here doesn't understand AI and self driving technology. Programming using self and reinforce learning is much easier these days and it doesn't requires the amount of training data as it used to. So the barrier of entries isn't as huge as most people think. I don't see Telsa have a huge advantage in this front.
"$TSLA and $NIO closer to $500 and $50 from $420 and $42. Next year, they will be $600 and $60. Maybe. Who knows?"

Every Tesla headline on the wires is negative. This is not looking good folks
"$STLA is well positioned to excel. They already have EV's and working on their own battery technology. They have a full range of cars from innexpensive to luxury and you can't replace that with poorly made $TSLA, $NIO or $XPEV. They also have the experience and infrastructure to scale up. That doesn't happen over night and $TSLA know that. Buy $STLA on the dip. It's a quick profit come monday."

Perfect! Tesla + Bitcoin = Ponzi Squared!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
There has been some debate about what’s going to happen tomorrow with the options expiration. I’m pretty curious to see how it plays out. Not concerned either way as I know it’s heading up long term ... but may buy more if there are any opportunities because I think that will be last chance for a while.
Is it going to 1000 still? I’ve been waiting
"What happens to share price on July 1st if Tesla confirms over 90,000 cars delivered in 2Q 2019?"
"Tesla is an AI & Data company compete in a automobile industry. One of its goals is to make EV cars more affordable whether that means to lead the entire industry forward then so be it. But the other goal is to build a connected network of individual cars and to collect driving behaviors that help train and improve autonomous driving models. It will be like a continuous, reinforcement learning model that improves over time with every iteration better than before. Time is of the essence so 1 year ahead of the competition is an exponentially competitive advantage.Something like below https://www.youtube.com/embed/YWOo5ypvZ2o?autoplay=1&FORM=VIRE4&PC=OPALIOS"
"What is up with the April options? Nearly 50,000 contracts each on the 800 and 850 strikes. That is a $1 billion purchase on over $8 billion in underlying equity. And that is all this morning."
"Just curious, why are you guys buying Tesla now knowing that 1.4T market cap would not be possible for Tesla in the short term. There are way more stocks out there with less downside"
Do longs just have morning wood for this stock. It's up every day in pre market regardless of what it does the rest of the day.
"Stock was $40 two years ago. They barely make any profit. Maybe did 500,000 cars in 2020. The value with 950 million shares outstanding @ 850 is $807 billion. They need to do sales of 1.5 trillion with their current 2% profit margin to make any sense. $1.5 trillion in sales would be 25 million cars at an average price of 60K."
LETS GET GREEN TODAY!!
everywhere I read they saying TSLA is bubble stock # 1
"No one seems to understand Tesla selling a car to an individual, the individual makes money letting the car be an autonomous taxci, the individual using the profit to pay for the car. Tesla has millions of cash cows this way."
"Great earning coming up $1500 by summer, over 2k and another stock split in oct 5/1. Rinse Ann’s repeat for the next 4years there’s no stopping this monster "

Tesla will continue to innovate and will sell products and services in 5-10 years that not even Elon knows about right now. Cars will be an afterthought. You're getting this stock cheap if willing to hold.

"William O'Neil research has found that when growth stocks get 100%-120% above their 200-day line it's a big warning sign. It's not a sell signal, but a shot across the bow.

"Most of you longs know this is a ""sell the news"" event--just like the delivery announcement. Your profits are today, before the ER"
Bull case for Tesla. Berlin factory to straight up destroy VW & BMW in Europe NEW Mega casting for front and rear of Model Y & 3 eliminating 60% of the build line Berlin Margins will break 30% OR Elon lowers his pricing again thus crushing its competition simply put he will be making better cars at half the price and selling them LOCALLY NO IMPORT DUTUES no SHIPPING half way around the world I can go on about FSD or that Tesla insurance is about to double by expanding into Texas. I can go on about a lot of other side stories Making a Bull case for Tesla is quite easy.
"I won’t be able to sleep tonight TSLA going to 50,00000 tomorrow"
"Someday, we will wake up to a headline (could be any one of the following) to the effect of 'tencent reduced holding in tesla''model 3 production is horrific''there is little demand for model3''tesla to raise 1.5 billion in capital'and the sp will fall $30 in premarket trading"
"It’s been fun messing with both shorts and longs here strictly for entertainment purposes. Nothing posted here effected nor moved stock price since we all hold too little shares and I am willing to bet not more than a few hundred readers actually read anything here. Leroy is a nice guy but on the wrong side of the trade (longs thought), nothing personal. I will hold on to my short positions for the time being."
Tesla could be the slow bleed that everyone experienced with Boeing.
"Nancy Pelosi's husband has placed up to $1 million worth of bullish bets on Tesla stock,"
Which other company other than TSLA has created tens of thousands of high paying manufacturing jobs in the last 5 years? The battery factory in Nevada is almost finish and will add several thousand more jobs. The Model 3 production in 2017 will add several thousand more jobs. Musk is making America Great Again by leading the world in cutting edge EVs vehicles and lithium batteries. Trump should appoint Musk to his technology advisory team.

"VW delivered nearly 134,000 electric vehicles, and 212,000 electrified cars in total (including hybrids and plug-in hybrids). That's an increase of 197 per cent and 158 per cent respectively.The German Volkswagen Group is the largest automaker in the world as of 2015. As of 2019, it has 136 production plants, and employs around 670,000 people around the world who produce a daily output of over 26,600 motor vehicles and related major components, for sale in over 150 countries."
How much does it cost Tesla per day to store thousands of cars on a lot in the desert?
Do not sell !We have a car in space! We have a car in space!Buying opportunity!!
"Many try to diminish the importance of Norway's sales data, but I think that is a mistake. Here are some data and insights.Norway has about 5.3MM people in totalThey have about 2.8MM passenger cars registered.To date Norwegians have purchased about 372,041 EVs (about 13%)This makes Norway, the biggest adopter of EVs in the world. There is a strong argument to be made that this little country is a useful model for what might happen in other countries as EVs are adopted competition increases.To date, Tesla has sold 58,915 of all EVs sold including:111 Roadsters13,829 Model X21,120 Model S23,855 Model 3Its worth noting that the bulk of sales happened before there was any significant competition. If you take out the Model S/X sales, Tesla's sales are mediocre at best, and in the last two years, they sold less than 2,000 model S in Norway and 3,000 Model X. Put another way, now that there is choice, those vehicles don't make the grade for the vast majority of buyers. (As an aside Porsche sold 1,200 Taycan's just last year at almost double the price!)Tesla has 15.8% of the EVs sold in the country over that three year period.Now you can massage the numbers anyway you want, but here are some conclusions from my analysis you can look at EU-EVs to see some nice graphs:1. The number of competitors has jump significantly. In 2018, six auto groups represented over 95% of sales. In Q4 2020, those same six groups represented just 80%. Renault was the largest in Q1 2018 at 40%, now it is VW by a large margin at 29.2%, Tesla maxed out at 29% in Q1 2019, they are currently (Q4 2020) at 16.3%2. Nissan and Tesla were both beneficiaries of early adoption. Now the field is spread very widely in a 'normal' market where there is competition and Tesla has moved to third place in marketshare in Norway in 2020 behind VW, Hyundai and Renault/Nissan. VW is the only company to show dominance.3. The idea of domination is probably passed. Tesla can claim such a thing in the USA, VW can in Europe but other than that, there is broad adoption or such small numbers as to be a misnomer. In Norway, VW brands clearly dominate having gone from 16%, 25% and now 30% marketshare over the past three years. Tesla went from 18% to 30% to 11%. 4. Finally there are a lot of arguments about capacity and those have yet to be borne out for any manufacturer in any meaningful way. Competition is ramping up everywhere, and all suppliers appear to be constrained by supply. That data will become clearer this year and next when substantially more production comes online.Overall though the reason that Norway is important is because it is a small window into the future of EV sales and competitive markets.You can ignore it. You can misrepresent it, you can acknowledge it, but it is still happening and it isn't favorable for Tesla.Guru."

"Could tesra see the $190's (for all you who didn't quite get the teens thing) today? Probably.As previously shown several qtrs ago, and then most other analysts followed suit, tesra in its best qtr was worth $180/shr,Now here in the era of musk emailing employees saying he was going to have to drastically cut expenses,..... tesra is a $50 stock. And even then they have 10 months to survive on the recent capital raise, according to musk, they just perpetrated on unsuspecting rubes.Buy on the dippers,... if you thought it was a no brainer in the $240's, you'll love the $180's."

"We all know Tesla have plans to build a factory in China.And I am sure we can all agree that only a fool would say that they know with a 100 percent certainty that it will not happen.So the big question must be if they do build it, what impact it would have on their long term future.I think producing 500,000 cars a year free of import tax in a country that has a huge appetite for EVs In a highly efficient factory, benefiting from lessons learned from GF 1 and 2With the cost saving from combining a GF1 and GF2 on one site.Would be a game changer for Tesla.I must admit I am long on Tesla to the tune of just over 500 shares at an average of about 220So I look at this in a positive light.But I think they have a better than 50/50 chance of pulling it off.If they do I can see them repeating it many times, in many countries.It would be transformational for both Tesla, and my portfolio.I am sure many on this BB will see things differentlyBut time will tell Good luck to allDYOR"
THANK YOU SHORTS for providing the ROCKET FUEL!
Let the downgrades commence...
Just chilling. Buy after huge dips. Never let short term dips affect long term gains. Been here since pre-split.
why does tesla have to mention pre-orders for model y? are they afraid that the share will collapse?the cybertruck was done the same way and suddenly there were cancellations. for me that's not credible
You can make money long on Tesla and also think it’s a bubble. Those 2 aren’t mutually exclusive.
Next strong support is 680. few bumps down the way at 750 and 720. Let's see how far this can go before bulls try to regain control

"Looks like the memory chip card pullout wasn't all that bad, no??"
 .. T Ev S L A+ R ..No Spell Check Necessary. .. Cheer$! .. @ The TeslaNaires
People are not talking about how much Tesla will earn from licensing FSD to the other manufacturers. Elon has said licensing would definitely be an option.The other companies will have no choice if they want to stay in business.Tesla will be making additional profit on every car sold by their competitors as well.
The only money they make is ripping off other car companies and taxpayers.
Tesla flying in mechanics from service centers to build cars. Go long on SpiritAir! (Short on TSLA). What a cluster bleep Tesla has become. All for a fake profit in Q3.
"I am a buyer at $70, TSLA needs to retest it’s lows before it can move higher, this is a healthy correction but not a buying opportunity, TSLA will not return to this level for another 10-15 years"
Higher and higher we goooo. Ringing in the new year with mo $$$ Who says stock picking was this easy. Who needs a financial adviser or stock analyst. Stocks only go up and up EVERY DAY.
Go ahead longs try to catch the falling knife see how it goes

I'm getting bored with this movement. What happened to buyers?

Elon understand his limitations and pull money out of TSLA and invest in Digital currency because TSLA being expensive EV can’t sustain against China affordable billions EV worldwide
Ark with the call. 1 billion under management lol not 5 billion or 10 billion. Just 1 billion lol I hope they go belly up tomorrow if they lose 5 clients there done 1 billion. Lol

"Stop shorting and see it deflate. Shorts themselves pull it upward. Downward it can only fly like a rock, look at the B-shaped price volume distribution chart.

"My friend's delivery date was just moved by about 6 months; she had an early Model 3 reservation. Date change was posted when she logged in 4 days ago. That is the second time. Reservation cancelled, and she is buying an Alpha Romeo."
"Other auto companies are unionized, they are done, Tesla has the auto market, everyone knows it, this isn’t about auto anymore, hasn’t been for awhile, 1tril market cap isn’t based on auto duh! Elon can now enter any industry he wants, hire all the smartest people in that particular industry, and conquer it, and when he does the market cap will go up and give him more money to enter and conquer another industry. People who say this can’t be justified by the autos they make are totally missing the point. He will crush many industries by outbidding all competitors for skill. I stopped shorting when I realized this a few months ago after losing a painful amount of money. I wish I had the balls to actually buy in right now because I believe Tesla is only getting started but I can’t bring myself to it."

Drip. Drop. Tick. Tock. Sell sometime before earnings longs before the real hysteria sets in.
Tesla is prepping to go above $1000 - shorts will be covering in massive droves soon! There will be an epic short squeeze on the horizon! Buy the dips!
there were so many articles supporting shorts in the past two weeks... That make short army so bigger and bigger ... but as I see that was the institutions tricks. We will see the shorts push TSLA go over 1000 after earning report. Good for the longs!
"i used to be impressed if a person said they r a millionaire, assuming they invented something cool or had special skills. but after seeing stocks like this, that title is akin to someone being able to go to the toilet without pzzn on their shoes. its somehow lost its luster and respect"
Started to buy Tesla way back when at $38. $100 and $180 a share 1000 shares was easily a part of any well seasoned portfolio. And today with 5:1 split 5000 shares is not hard to believe add 1000% rise in price and you have a TESLANAIRE

"I still do not understand why so many in the media give Musk credit for ""telling off the analysts"" at the CC. Am I alone in thinking he did not sound like a leader taking control of a situation, but more like an aloof baby?"
I'm more confident to short this than ever. The only special on Tesla is their autonomous driving software. But this wont be finish in the next 5 years if at all. As long as autonomous driving isnt working properly they are in heavy competition with other car makers with almost same technology but more capabilities in manufacturing

"I'm very bullish on Tesla stock, because I know that Bitcoin will go to 250k/coin since Elon Musk is supporting it and it's going mainstream. Apple will be the next major corporation to purchase Bitcoin and this will set a trend. All fortune 500 companies should keep at least 10% of the cash balance in bitcoin. This will protect against inflation. Another reason why this 1.5 Billion investment into bitcoin will bring incredible wealth to Tesla shareholders is because even at current prices, Tesla is up 600 million in profit on bitcoin, so if you use the current 12month trailing P/E ratio of around 300, it would translate into 180 Billion additional market cap! This will materialize next quarter."

"READ TO THE END TESLA IS THE ONLY ONE WITH POSITIVE SALES :U.S. auto sales: TrueCar forecasts U.S. auto sales will fall 18% in July to 1,189,928 units to mark the fourth month in a row of sequential improvement. New light-vehicle sales decreased by 34% in March, 48% in April, 30% in May and 23% in June. ""Mainstream brands are steadily increasing their new vehicle sales month-over-month, especially brands with healthy inventory levels such as FCA. Their Jeep brand stands out for strong performance, likely driven by strong incentive programs as well as the inventory levels needed to satisfy the unique demands of shoppers,"" notes TrueCar's Nick Woolard. He notes that luxury brands BMW and Mercedes are recovering at a slower rate amid the tough macroeconomic backdrop. July forecast by manufacturer - General Motors (GM) -18.4% to 192,881 units, Toyota (NYSE:TM) -19.3% to 169,759 units, Ford (F) -14.8% to 164,423 units, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU) -11.4% to 149,342 units, Honda (HMC) -13.7% to 121,880, Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY) -26.5% to 72,675 units, Subaru (OTCPK:FUJHY) -11.1% to 56,970 units, Hyundai (OTCPK:HYMLF) -5.9% to 55,464 units, Kia (OTCPK:HYMLF) -3.6% to 51,499 units, Volkswagen (OTCPK:VWAGY) -12.2% to 49,073 units, Daimler (OTCPK:DDAIF) -18.6% to 22,420 units, BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY) -25.7% to 19,291 units, Tesla +21.7% to 15,581 units."

Tesla may be fundamentally overvalued today but the company should more than be capable over growing into this valuation once Berlin and ATX come online. $1000 in MSFT when they went public would be worth $2M+ today.

After hour continue upwards surge... sorry shorty. Not wise to short a great company.
The valuation is reasonable. Maybe a little low.
"Pop goes the weasel! Sorry to the longs who were duped into buying into 'unlimited growth' and 'profitable car company' at $800-$900 a share. As you contemplate the future, note that Tesla has about $38 billion in net assets and 1.1 billion shares outstanding. While it isn't a perfect calculation, their intrinsic value as a company is about $35 a share. Everything else is hopes and dreams for the future.They have $31 billion in revenue. Car companies traditionally sold (high margin, low cost, ICE vehicles) and were valued at less than 1x revenue.Tesla could return to a valuation nearing $100 billion and still be significantly above traditional/historic norms.Not to say that $650 a share isn't what you will pay, but waiting for a much lower valuation will seem wiser in the coming years. Guru."
I don't have any skin in this game. Most people are thinking that $TSLA will hit $280+ tomorrow. Be mindful that sometimes stocks will not do what you think it's going to do.
"Elon is wishing he took a salary. rather than stock compenstation based on share price. I've read that even his homes are used for collateral against his debt. He's going to lose everything.

How much refunds will Tesla have to pay to other car owners based on the settlement on the autopilot issue?Very rough calculation:25.000 Tesla car owners with autopilot package will claim to have a refund. 25.000 is a fair number and is considering that a lot of cultist have bought the car also who will not ask for a refund. 25.000 x 8.000 = USD 200.000.000 (USD 5.000 plus cost involved for lawyers = 8.000 per car) plus internal costs for TSLA and their external lawyers. How much cash do they have at the moment? Well make that roughly 200m less.

This is old news from 6 months ago. The NHTSA investigation was opened back in June 2020. It applies to 2012-18 Model S and 2016-2018 Model X touchscreens. The 159K vehicles is the same as was reported in June.
"Last week I was clearly saying ""Now is NOT the time to short Tesla"". Things are going to look good for the coming quarter or two as they mass produce the high margin premium M3's, and they might even GASP make a little money. The time to short is AFTER the surge, when they start losing their shirts building the 35k variant, demand drops, and they LOSE THE FEDERAL EV subsidies bit by bit. This company is ultimately doomed (or will at least retreat to a much lower level), but it will take another year or two for the games to come to an end."

"Just saw a straw poll over on the Tesla fanboy sight. The poll is asking Ontario reservation holders what they are going to do now that their EV rebate has been cancelled. Only 21% have said they will move forward with their order anyway. 29% are waiting to see if they can get the rebate re-instated and ""will cancel soon"" if it is not, 9.7% have already cancelled, 35.5% are waiting to find out about the rebate and will ""probably"" proceed with an order.So it looks like at least 40% have or will cancel with government money. Can we expect the same drop in demand once the U.S. credit is gone? And if other countries drop their incentives can we expect the same there as well?"
"Elon can shoots more rocket into with this $850 Million. I have friend said that every time Elon shoot his rocket into space, TSLA shoot up!SpaceX, a company led by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, raised $850 million in a funding round last week, CNBC reported Tuesday.What Happened: The space exploration firm raised the funds at $419.99 per share. After the latest fundraising, SpaceX is valued at $74 billion, according to CNBC.The latest raise values SpaceX 60% higher compared with the previous round in August when it raised nearly $2 billion at a valuation of $46 billion.Why It Matters: Notably, the funds were raised just one cent shy of $420, an infamous figure that caused plenty of trouble for Musk in 2018. In December, it was reported that SpaceX was seeking a valuation of $92 billion in a new funding round.The company plans to send four space tourists to orbit Earth on “the world’s first all-civilian mission” during the fourth quarter this year.Related Link: Elon Musk Unintentionally Sends 'Marscoin' Cryptocurrency Soaring 1,800% With A Tweet"

"Tesla's Dirty Little Secret. Tesla posted its first full year of net income in 2020 -- but not because of sales to its customers.Eleven states require automakers sell a certain percentage of zero-emissions vehicles by 2025. If they can't, the automakers have to buy regulatory credits from another automaker that meets those requirements -- such as Tesla, which exclusively sells electric cars.It's a lucrative business for Tesla -- bringing in $3.3 billion over the course of the last five years, nearly half of that in 2020 alone. The $1.6 billion in regulatory credits it received last year far outweighed Tesla's net income of $721 million -- meaning Tesla would have otherwise posted a net loss in 2020.""These guys are losing money selling cars."
"I am a bit disappointed as a long. With all the incentives offered and price reductions, I would have thought they would crush the number. Oh well, I expect some short term pain, but it will recover. We all know the valuation is high but I can't sell. Musk constantly boasts big ideas within a certain timeframe and rarely gets it done. The market doesn't seem to care, so I will keep riding this until it does."

"VW posted over 12 billion profit and this turd will be lucky for 3 billion. I love how people say TSLA is not a car company yet the only revenue stream is cars/tax credits and the stock rises and falls significantly on announcements related to its car business. The typical response is TSLA is a company of 20+ startups, to which i counter 90% of startups fail and the ones that I’ve heard about are just jokes that people with too much money (Musk) created out of boredom (e.g. the boring company and it’s flamethrower)."

Everyone in these chats love to hype in a bullish run and complain a stock is worthless as soon as it drops any. Many of them young investors getting into the market during a time where they think the stock market is all about continuous green days and guaranteed money making. Whoever has this mentality needs to wake up and grow up and loose a little during this bearish time to bring them back to reality.
"Tesla lists the gas savings as part of the credit/savings in the price of the car. So, in essence, Tesla is stating that the gas savings that a typical customer is likely to enjoy over the suggested timeframe of 6 years should be passed onto them upfront as part of the purchase price of the car? Forgetting about the time value of money for a second, how then do the gas savings accrue to the end customer?"

"Today's price was an over-kill to 7% staff reduction. Although this was a surprise, Tesla had hired quite a bit of workers last year to ramp up model 3 production. Now, with automation in place, these excess workers are not needed, Elon is cost cutting so it's actually a good news. It depends on your point of view. It should not have caused 13% in stock loss. It seems like a buying opportunity. Tesla is like Apple as it deserves luxury premium. So far, all other EV makers are Tesla want a be's."

"One thing the sales rep could not understand.The non refundable deposit on the S or X is $2500 cdn. And $3200 on the Model 3... made no sense to the rep since the S and X are higher priced carsMade perfect sense to me. It is called grabbing as much deposit cash as possible as the Model 3 represent about 8O% of sales I did have one laugh. There are 6 Model 3s in inventory across Toronto, Montreal and Quebec City.. the sales rep asked me if I liked the colours of any. The Montreal car was red and I said it looked nice. He said it would cost me $500 to ship it. I laughed and said I wouldn’t pay an extra $500 to clear up Elon’s priblem..

"Latest prices of Tesla $TSLA Nio $NIO Xpeng $XPEV and Li Auto $LI Tesla has slashed prices of its made-in-China Model Y cars to woo drivers in the world’s largest electric vehicle market, ratcheting up pressure on its global and Chinese rivals that focus on the premium segment.The Long Range version of Model Y starts from 339,000 yuan (US$52,074), excluding a government subsidy, 30 per cent cheaper than the price quoted six months ago when presale orders could first be placed.- Xpeng Motor’s P7 all-electric sedan, start from 229,900 yuan after government subsidies. - Li Auto’s ONE SUV sells for 328,000 yuan, - NIO’s ES6 SUV starts at 346,600 yuan. Prices are several notches higher for foreign marques, - Mercedes-Benz EQC going at 499,800 yuan- BMW’s iX3 retails for 469,900 yuan.I think the biggest competition to Telsa, Xpeng, Nio and Li Auto is the PRC traditional auto manufactures as BAIC, SAIC, Geely and BYD for example. I am personally and professionally bullish about the PRC EV market and think 8 - 10 companies will dominate like Telsa, Nio, Xpeng, Li, WM, BAIC, SAIC, Geely and BYD and then there will be least expensive (but not that profitable) and the top end luxury foreign JVs like Mercedes, VW doing well too to make up about 12-15 companies leading EV in PRC.For Nio, Xpeng, Li and WM, they will continue to do very well and have significant upside both in business and stock valuations."
"Even if Tesla does 100K model threes, this quarter will be a disaster. This is purely an attempt to move metal for cash that is badly needed. You don't slash prices, lay off employees on 3 separate occasions, close stores, and move cars to Europe where you have lower margins if there is demand in North America. Tesla barely made a profit last quarter selling 90,000 cars. Imagine how bad Tesla will miss making a profit moving these lower margin models overseas were transportation costs and other costs will be much higher than in the US. Model 3 has cannibalized Model S and X sales and pre-orders for Model Y are under 12k hence the reason the ""expensive"" referral program is back. Musk has mortgaged his properties and his plane for personal liquidity. This is just another stock pump and his all-in moment. Tesla will lose 100's of millions of dollars and his only hope is deliveries will hide the fact that all demand has been pulled forward and Tesla cannot produce enough cars at high enough margins to survive. He will need additional funding and it will have to be tied to production not results."

"Elon wanted to keep the factory open so the share price wouldn't plummet subjecting 10,000 workers to a possible outbreak... let's say there was one, and 10% of the workforce contracted it... mind you, that's probably low. the infection rate is on average 4 people for every case... so that would be 4 people infected likely outside the factory and let's say it jumped one more time... so each 4 that contracted it also infect 4 more people...that'd be the original 1000 people, plus 4000 people they transmitted to and 16000 people they transmitted it to... so 21,000 people. there's a 2% mortality rate... which would be 420 people. (hmm... coincidental number eh)so... another way to put this is... Elon wanted to keep the factory open so the share price would stay high and was willing to kill 400+ people to do it... and again... those are conservative numbers."
"look at this thing drop!!! where's da,oil, dino, etc??? i know kenny and leroy are trolling in a desperate attempt to justify the loons behavior but the others are just quiet."

"Poof! And they want to place humans aboard these rockets, this year? What happens when the Dragon (manned capsule) fails to disengage from the upper stage booster? I wonder if those two private moonie ""astronauts"" have asked for their deposit back? The good news is, they can switch their deposit towards a Founders Series Roadster, as there still seems to be plenty available."
"Soon tesla will have the resources to produce a Tesla city. Just think, clean power grid with universal HVAC, boring tunnel transport leaving earth level free from vehicles, 3d printed housing. Roads and highways take a lot of space on earth level and drivers waste a lot of time jamming. Tesla flying car delivery, semis and drones deliver products. His brother is working on vertical farming. They are developing a whole TESLA ECOSYSTEM, people who see a car company lack the vision to truly understand what is happening here. Trying to short or bash Tesla is like bashing the future of your generations. I believe that all investors should support the companies that are trying to improve our collective situations."
"Not much upside and 80-90% chance that top hit at 880$. IBD advised that 6/7 indicators showed that Tesla is reaching a climax run. After a climax run, comes a BIG pullback.P/E ratio- all time highP/S ratio- all time highRSI- off by one point from 2013 all time highTesla expected to make 31B in revenue but has a 800B market cap!! If anyone can find any other stock that has ever done this in the history of stocks (tech, auto, whatever) please give me the name. Apple disrupted the cell phone market when they developed the first touch screen iPhone (35B in revenue at the time - 175B market cap), Amazon disrupting brick and mortar business (amongst all other things)(had a 3600 p/e at one point but were making 55-60B in revenue and had a ~150B market cap), Google- I’m sure you’ve heard of them (highest p/e they ever had was around mid 50s), Netflix disrupting streaming business (traded at a about 450 P/E at their highest, while making close to 4B in revenue and had a 45B market cap- highest PS ratio of about 12). So just compare Tesla to any other major tech company and you’ll see the insane overvaluation here (even though as it stands Tesla makes most of their money from selling cars!). Up close to 900% since March. People need to get a close look and see that numbers like that can only be compared to .com bubble. Welcome to the EV bubble. You have companies like NKLA with no revenue valued close to 10B. There’s a new EV company every other day and competition is EVERYWHERE. Tesla could sit at this price for the next 3-5 (or more) years and still be grossly overvalued.Reality is Tesla is expected to make 31B this year, 45B next year and 65B in 2023. With this growth, fair value they should be around 300-400B market cap and that’s still being very generous. Don’t worry, there was plenty of blind FOMO buyers in the .com bubble as well. They would speak the same language as the pumpers here. Keep in mind that it took investors 10-15 years to make their money back (and that’s if they invested in amazon). Looks like history will repeat itself. This coming earnings report should do the job! Y’all better hope they smash expectations by at least 100%! Since they barely met 2020 delivery expectations, I expect a modest beat at best, then let the massive selling begin (sell the news)!Leaving off with this. On 12/3 Musk stated to his employees that Tesla needs “to cut costs or the firm's stock price could be “crushed like a soufflé under a sledgehammer.” - that was around 550$ SP. Well we’re now ~55% higher and I am sure Tesla didn’t magically make any drastic changes to their cost cutting within a month. Should be a big warning sign "
"There was an article recently that claimed musk was vindicated with the rude awakening warning he put out for shorts several weeks ago,........................ the record loss tesla just reported.Some cult member please explain how a record loss is a rude awakening for shorts.And bonus - please explain how selling only 18,000 out of the 28,000 Edsel 3's it produced is good."

In the long term it will go down. Too much competition not enough margin. This is not like a phone company. There’s nothing you can do about the stock people will buy it lose a lot of money and eventually it will go down. There’s nothing anyone can do about it. It is what it is
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-is-very-fully-priced-says-investing-legend-byron-wien-195839534.html
"The only negative I can find during this correction is margin debt is very high. 99% of all traders lose money, so I am hanging on. Rising interest rates are a positive as they indicate investors are fleeing bonds and buying stocks. I like $NNDM and $TSLA. NNDM because it has patent protection and therefore 0 competition. I wonder if NNDM will go into the new ARK space fund? It is required for making guidance systems. The recent direct offering at $12.80 is also a floor. Whoever bought that offering will also be buying in the open market below $12.80. I also like TSLA, but at $500, not $750. However the 200 dma is $450 and rising quickly, so I may be too pessimistic. I like TSLA because their competition is ICE manufactures, not other BEVs. There is a shortage of batteries. TSLA is also the leader in self driving. Self driving is all about data collection and artificial intelligence. TSLA collects 100 times more data than their nearest competitor. The profit margins on self driving are 90%. 25% of new TSLAs pay the $10k self driving fee up front. Other owners can add self driving as a subscription as the hardware is already built into the vehicle."

"Tesla 1Q Production Totaled 34,494 Vehicles, Up 40% from 4Q"
why is it dropping post market
"Many believe that sell side analysts like the guy at Wedbush rate companies based on the agenda of his investment bank, rather than the real fundamental story. In Europe, Tesla is getting pummeled by the EV competition from major players like VW and Renault. Sales in the U.S. are not great, yet this analyst is incessantly cheerleading future prospects for the very competitive China market. Then with overbought conditions (a move from $400 to $850 in 8 weeks, an RSI at 80) he's still raising the price target. It's irresponsible for traders, and many will be sorry they listened to the Wedbush analyst and bought at the top."

In the real world tweaking a prog die takes almost as long as building it."

"See, if you longs can reason this out? Say, TSLA does manage to increase it's sales by 50% a year over the next 6 years. That would be truly impressive, especially after 2023 with all the competition from other car manufacturers. If share count doesn't change, that would suggest GAAP earnings in 2026 of $8/share. Again, that would be very impressive growth of 11 times 2020 earnings.That would put TSLA's earnings just about where GM's are expected to be in 2026 (which is only about 25% more than expected 2021 GM earnings). Yet, TSLA is trading at 15 the times of the price of GM.BTW, I am long GM. I ""expect"" that if GM performs as I project, it will be worth as much as $100/share in 2026. But, I wouldn't be willing to pay $100 per share for GM NOW.Can you see the problem we have with this? Yes, growth is good. 6 years of 50% per year would be possible only in the absence of any sort of significant competition. Maybe it's possible for 6 years. I think it's highly unlikely. But even then, with TSLA selling over 5 million cars per year at current vehicle prices, it would have to grow more than 10 times from that to justify the current stock price. (More likely it would have to sell more than 10 million per year if it is selling a $25k vehicle).This just doesn't seem like an expectation that a reasonable man could have. It's as if you have concluded that Elon Musk can walk on water (not frozen) and therefore TSLA is worth $1000/share, $5000/share, $15,000 per share or whatever.It just doesn't make any sense."

Not enough TSLA stock to go around - a few weeks ago I wrote how Tesla being in the S&P now locks up about 150 mil shares in mutual funds that basically take it out of circulation. There are probably more funds that also buy and hold. Cramer said on CNBC that there are not enough stocks to invest in so the high demand and low supply is making the price go up. I agree with him completely. If you had money you want to invest - what would you buy? Not money markets. Not bonds. You buy stocks of course but which ones - you buy Tesla of course and since there are less sellers - the price goes up.
"Can someone post ""TSLA to $400!"" again, please. I'm having a hectic day at work, and need the comic relief. Last minute exterior design changes to the Ford Mach-1.

TSLA hypothetically dropping 25% would cause buyers flock..... not to mention 2021 to 2030 is a very EV friendly decade."
Compare AAPL's super high PE to TSLA it would make TSLA valued at $21.25 (over 40 times the speculative value compared to APPL). TSLA is a great company but way overpriced at $880. Protect your gains and capital. For the first time I just shorted TSLA. At minimum 600s is on the near horizon.

Regulators in the Obama/holder era turned a blind eye to the predatory shenanigans of the bozo.

"I’d like to understand the bullish point of view, where do you guys see Tesla in 5 years (in terms of rev, sales etc)?"
So they payoff debts and plans to expand production and the street punishes NIO. $TSLA does recalls blows up a car and it goes up
Elon needs to do another production halt to pump the stock.
"Tesla up big, AGAIN, today. Congrats to longs. When will the Merry Men come for Tofutti (TOFB)?"
"People that can't see why gamestop is so valuable probably also think $tsla is so valuable because they sell cards, see the future folks!"
Over 700 plus pre market let’s go fam 
"to the Tesla bulls...how do you feel about the fact that Tesla's profitability is down partly because of the stock compensation for Elon (who happens to be the richest person in the world...lol) coupled with the fact that the short percentage on this company is at historic lows, hopefully there aren't any calls for WSBs to come ""save Tesla"" on this forum"
I bought into the Tesla story in 2018 at $54 . You guys just have to believe in this great company
Last chance for Elon to issue more shares at 700+. Come on Elon there are some buyers now.
They say Musk is able to move markets with tweets. How come those tweets doesn't move his own company's stock?
Just released Tesla bull says TSLA is very super duper fully extra priced with a cherry on top... 
"Wait is the production bar moving down again? I just read that TSLA is trying to maintain production of 5,000 per week for this quarter. I swear, 5 weeks ago, they said it was starting at 5,000 and ramping up to 6,800 by now. How does this number keep drifting now without someone at TSLA being held accountable?"
is this the end of the road for TSLA stock?....seems there is a lot of competition coming down the pike....the big automakers are also aggresivly developing EV's...the market will soon be flooded with a large variety of EV models to choose from....
Sell off today
"I am up 120%. Still, I don’t know when to sell."
what do we want? $800 ! When do we want it? Now !! keep on moving
"1200 PE is hard to explain when 22 PE is considered very unsustainable even by established firm like Apple, Google etc."
Should have announced secondary at $379/share. That ship sailed and is never coming back
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-monitor-tesla-elon-musk-063109452.htmlOh, absolutely!Further, I do not care how a spectacular tsla fall would hurt longs, at all. It's not like they haven't been warned, over and over and over and over...Expect more red today."
BUY BUY BUY !! People this stock is guaranteed to be at 1200 next week !!!! Price targets are all ABOVE 1000 !! Min 1000 at least by next wednesday. GUARANTEED !! JUST USE MARGIN AND MAX OUT NOW !!!
I have friends that bought tsla thinking it was going to 420 they lost thousands i think they should sue tsla for musk tweeting his nonsense. I know the market is risky but a ceo of a company should never do what musk did have a great day

Once again congratulations to everyone who bought the dip yesterday. These are rare opportunities to buy this gem. Did you know nio et 7 is not available until the end of 2022 ? Did you know tesla will make model Y from Berlin with the new 4860 battery cells this year already?
Some brokers maybe looking for margin call cash...
"Can someone answer a serious question? Im new to trading and dont know what the hell im doing. I pick a stock and hope it goes up. I bought TSLA at 630 so i am happy. My question is who is logging in after hours at 6pm seeing tsla at $834 and going ""i have to buy that now""?"

I would start to sell Tesla only if something happened to Elon musk or if he starts selling some shares.
"Jay Leno adding Tesla Model 3 to his collection of unique cars. It will sit along side the Doble Steam car as the best technology of the time but not economically viable. Doble Steam Motors Company. The first model E was sold in 1924, and Doble Steam Motors continued to manufacture steam-powered cars for the next seven years. In 1924 the State of California learned that Abner had helped to sell stock illegally in a desperate bid to raise money for the company, and though Abner was eventually acquitted on a technicality, the company folded during the ensuing legal struggle.For all their innovations, Doble [change name to Tesla] cars were hindered by two significant problems. The first was the price: the chassis alone sold for $9500, and adding a body virtually doubled that figure, making the car a luxury item in the 1920s. In 1922 the brothers had begun work on a lower cost model, projected to sell for less than $2000. This was named the Simplex, and was to be powered by four uniflow single-acting cylinders. One prototype is known to have been constructed, but the car never approached production stage. The other problem was Abner Doble himself, who was said to be such a perfectionist that he was seldom willing to stop tinkering and actually release an automobile for sale. http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a6228/jay-leno-and-his-doble-steam-cars/"

So the CCP has set up a plan for locals to build their own semiconductor factories.

"$TSLA is Apple all over again. People preaching $F and $GM will kill $TSLA 's run are a parallel to people saying Android, Samsung, Etc, Etc are better builds. They might be right but all that matters right now is brand perception. People are confident in the ability of $TSLA to take over the lion's share of people with the buck to upgrade their car every 4 to 5 years just for the LOL's and a couple fancy upgrades and newer form factors, not really a chance for competing against traditional automakers."
"As EV sales trend results are starting to come out by region/market worldwide, China, Europe, etc. it’s become obvious now with Tesla’s drastic declines, it will only ever be a niche player, much like Audi in the sports/luxury market—i.e., TSLA way overvalued"
"I am 27 years old and my fortune is over $25.6 M thanks to Tesla; and that is before next earnings of which I predict my fortune will exceed $200M. Here is my story although no one asked or even cares.My last job was flipping eggs and bacons at Denny's (minimum wage) where I worked for 12 years. I started investing in Tesla when they went public. In fact, I decided to stop renting my apartment and move into my car back then in order to save and invest in Tesla. And look at me now I am TESLANAIRE!!YES YES I'm always here in this forum in the afternoons so I can brag about it. And by the way, after next earnings as my fortune will exceed $200M, I'm planning to vacation in Mars then, anyone interested?"
"I have only 9 shares, still happy"
"I wonder if you Bulls have any explanation for all the insider selling by Directors of TSLA? These can't be dismissed as mere short who try to drive the stock down. Why, after exercising stock options are they invariably selling the shares acquired? They could get a very nice return selling stock options instead if they weren't afraid of a major stock price decline.You think you know something that they don't?"
Keep a close eye on the dress and physical appearance of Elon Musk in the coming year. Suspect he will not be seen in public very often and when he does appear his mental descent will be hard to conceal. Eerily reminiscent of Jim Jones and Howard Hughes.
"Netherlands Q4 2019 = 29,922 Model 3s soldNetherlands Q4 2020 = 3,967 Model 3s sold <<<=== 86% decline, despite price cuts Tesla's ""growth"" in Europe is not sustainable."
Wow! Tons of desperate shorts coming out of the woodwork today. I wonder why? Could it be that they’d finally like to cover and go shart somewhere else? Maybe try dragging down a different company? My advice is to stop shorting and go long. That way you can make money and support companies you like!
So it appears that shorts get very excited when a stock falls by less than 1%. It’s a BFD. We feel sorry for them but wish them well.
"And the good news? Demand for Model 3, S and X for the next 4 weeks will be ""though the roof!"" And now the bad: Tesla reduced production of S and X in 4th quarter (per their admission), and we can safely say Model 3 is ""production constrained"".Tesla is very good, at missing opportunities. And now more good new (sorta): Should the final reconciliation bill rescind the tax credit, the problem of being production constrained goes away, for ever."
"5 to1 or 10 to 1 split, when??"
Very disappointing results...other EV makers will catch up and Tesla will no longer be that unique

"A German car rental firm; EC rentals just posted this on their webpage. Not only is China company suing TSLA but stories like these will tend to stop people from buying TSLA cars.<<< ....Unfortunately, we had to cease our activities.Due to increasing technical difficulties, and the lack of timely parts supply by Tesla Motors, we could not longer operate half of our Tesla rental fleet since mid-december 2018. Because this situation is no longer maintainable and a solution does not seem to be within reach, we had no other option than to stop all of our rental activities....."

"in a sea of market red and McConnell's blocked Christmas stimulus, that's a nice days green finish for TSLA, holding up within about 4.5% off its all time high."

"Tesla signs contract with lawn service company <===== let's speculate our brains out The move will drastically alter the way Tesla mows their lawn. It frees up dozens maybe hundreds of employees who are desperately needed on the assembly lines. Savings in the form of reduced mower maintenance could make this a game changer. According to Elon the idea came to him while he was digging the $10 million tunnel. Some analysts urge caution because such an ambitious plan might take several years to implement - ""there is no way to know if hiring an outside firm to mow the lawn can even be done."" The details of the contract are unknown but we do know Apple also uses an outside lawn service sparking merger rumors. In other news - dramatic evidence of Global Cooling hit the region last night and will threaten our very existence until Friday when we will see catastrophic Global Warming heading into the weekend."

"Ron Baron, for instance, is a longtime, renowned bull on electric maker Tesla(TSLA). In an interview with Barron's in early 2020, Baron said he expected the electric-vehicle to reach 1.5 trillion market value by 2030. Tesla stock soared more than 740% last year and is now halfway to that valuation. It also is the biggest driver by far, of the 149% gain for the $7.1 billion Baron's Partners Fund (BPTRX) which beat the Russel 3000 by 128 percentage points.The Baron Partners fund began buying Tesla in 2014. It last purchase was in Feb 2016 for less than $40 per share. The stock is now $850. Co-managers Ron and Michael Baron have trimmed the funds on Tesla position since then. At the beginning of 2020, it had grown about 17%, The fund sold 20% of its stake throughout 2020 but the stock rose so quickly that by the end of the year, nearly half of the funds assets were invested in Tesla. We are more confident in Tesla's business fundamentals than we were at the time of our first purchase says Michael Baron, adding that the firm is nonetheless mindful of portfolio concentration."
"I have too much money and hate paying taxes, so I'd like to invest in a company that always loses money and whose guidance looks ‘unrealistic’.Preferably with a genius CEO.Any recommendations?Serious responses only."
don't be surprised if Tesla goes down 20% in 3 days like it did on Sept 1-3. And it was only $500 then! A lot of room to drop. $700 tomorrow is not out of the question. Very tough week ahead for longs.

More than 20,000 superchargers available globally. This is like adding the equivalent income from owners of gas stations such as Shell or ExxonMobil or Chevron to a car company.8. Home charging units installed by Tesla. 9. The only car company with over-the-air upgrades.10. Auto-pilot and self-driving. 11. Tesla Gigafactories. That is why Tesla's market cap has exceeded $570 billion and has reached over $800 billion. Can its market cap go higher than its present value? No one can tell.

"“We see Tesla more as BlackBerry versus Apple,” Johnson says. “If we move to the world’s largest EV market where competition is the strongest, Europe, their market share last year fell from 30% to 10%.

Coronavirus acted as a catalyst to “kick start” TSLA’s inevitable correction.Note the rate of TSLA’s sell-off continues at about 3 times that of market in general, and I anticipate TSLA share price has much further to fall"

"The Musk Auto Pilot needs a new feature: Targeted Collision System.Now Teslas collide with random things that the auto pilot doesn't see, sometimes invisible 18 wheelers, stopped school busses, little children, or parked cars. It would be much better if users could pick up their preferred target, say a child crossing the street or a stopped school buss full of kids going to school."

"Spak admits that now that Tesla stock has run up nearly seven times in price, its new price is likely to be something of a ""self-fulfilling"" prophecy, giving Tesla the financial firepower to essentially buy for itself the valuation it thinks it deserves.How does that work?""Our biggest miss was how TSLA can take advantage of its stock price to raise capital inexpensively and fund capacity outlays and growth,"" explains Spak. With Tesla's current elevated stock price, the company is able to both avoid taking on debt and still raise massive amounts of cash through minimal stock issuances that don't dilute existing shareholders much at all.Tesla can then take that cash and invest it in buying up competitors and new technology, and in ""capacity additions"" (i.e. new factories), enabling it to rapidly expand production and produce more cars (and thus collect more revenue)"

GM and F are pricing WELL BELOW TESLA, and Tesla against making anything cheaper yet. I am not a bear, you could take the time to read my other posts if you prefer to distrust anyone that doesn't agree with you."

"Tsla will continue to drift lower now...everyone with 2 brain cells knows model 3 real production rate is about 1500/wk at best. ramping to 2-3k finally will not even pay for overhead because the finances were originally designed for 10k/wk cars and line profitability at 5k cars but only will the high margin long range optioned out cars for which there is limited demand...not that many people want a $50k compact sedan. so stock is almost guaranteed to drift lower till earnings which will be horrific and push price even lower...then people start worrying with lower price dilution on next raise is highers and push price lower...self reinforcing cycle.but that's what happens when your only ability to keep the lights on is by constantly raising money. there is very little air left in this balloon, and soon even the most avid long will realize that roadster, semi, even model y are mostly empty promises as TESLA simply doesn't have the over $10 B to bring those to market as it keeps losing 2-3B just keeping the doors open.Perma longs on this board have been warned many times what this company is. Its not some profitable company that might have a bad year and some price fluctuations but is fundamentally sound...this company survives purely on the belief of others to send more money and not on anything it actually sells. so when this thing goes down, its not going up again."
"VW: “By 2020 we will offer our customers more than 25 new electric models and more than 20 plug-in hybrids,” Elon Musk: “By 2020 we will offer our customers 2 electric models, not 1 of which will be new, and one electric People's Car for the poor,.”"

"Percentage comparisons with Tesla and other automakers is a joke. Example: GM's US deliveries were down 7% YoY, but Tesla's worldwide deliveries were up 30%. But GM delivered over 660k vehicles that quarter. Tesla only delivered 63k. But if we compare this quarter's deliveries with 4Q2019, we get a completely different situation. GM's deliveries were down 16% QoQ, but Tesla's were down 27%."

"The Tesla Truck has not even been designed yet. Tesla has absolutely no idea what the final price will be. They are printing what investors want to hear. Although we do know it will be more than $150K (300 mpc) and $180K (500 mpc). A loaded Model X is $154K, more than a Semi? The semis will have 10 tires, 10 wheels, 4 drive motors , 6 rotors, six calipers, larger body panels, massive windshield, wiper assembly, mirrors, more cameras, heavy duty shocks, roof fairing, complex coupler, heavy duty steel frame, giant cab, at least 4X battery capacity, all hardward for autonomous driving, and will sell for less than a soccer mom's grocery getter.

"Fact: Tesla has never made a profit from selling cars. Without government subsidies Tesla would be bankrupt.Fact: The NHTSA has just compelled Tesla to recall over 100,000 vehicles. It’s customary for credible automakers to self-report these issues, not to be forced by the government.Fact: Tesla is a very expensive vehicle with very little time on the market. Its long term reliability has not been tested or proven.Fact: The United States has an unemployment problem yet Tesla fans (they’re not investors-it’s too emotional to be an investment) think $40,000 base model cars built by a start up company are just what the masses want.Fact: Elon Musk made his money from creating PayPal. He’s not a manufacturing guy or an automotive engineer.Fact: $F has an army of highly experienced best in the world engineers developing a new electric F-150. Ford has vast experience in automotive engineering design and manufacturing from over a century of lessons learned - that Tesla still has to learn.Fact: The Ford F-150 is the best selling vehicle in the United States for over 25 years running.Fact: Other Real automakers are developing electric vehicles using their vast experience in vehicle design and manufacturing. With pre-established proven technology and supply chains.Fact: Tesla is currently valued at 1700X’s earnings - earnings which without Government Subsidies would not exist.These are indisputable facts.Tesla is the definition of a bubble. It’s not investable. It’s overvalued and will crash.The best corollary is NetScape versus Internet Explorer in the 1990’s...NetScape launched the first real internet browser - ie. Tesla as the first EV - but then Microsoft used its existing knowledge and infrastructure to crush NetScape.Tesla=NetScapeWhat should you do?Invest in real companies with essential products, growing demand and real assets that are trading below traditional valuations.

"Clearly investors are disappointed with the Delivery number for the valuation they gave to Tesla. Investors clearly knows that what took to get this delivery number. ie., 1 year charge, 3 months FSD. Still they didnt meet the target. They also realized that the margin is going to suffer. And 2021 Price Reduction. If Tesla were to attract new customers by price reduction, we need to run away from this business as fast we could. Margins will suffer and competition is severe. Importantly EV is getting into commodity space. Apple is looking into this space to be a differentiator in this field and wipeout everyone. That is going to be a real threat."

"Tax Credits ===== the situation is worse than anticipated So far Tesla has sold 144,399 cars in the USA. Using realistic optimistic MS production numbers(*) : If we assume quarterly sales on the Model S and X will be down 10% (they cut production) then they will sell about 6,075 Model Ss and 5250 Model Xs per quarter. Tesla claims they were making 1,000 Model 3s per week at the end of 2017. That's 13,000 a week in Q1. Then 2,500 a week in Q2 and three (32,500 per Q). At that rate they will reach 200,000 in Q2. In Q3 - full credit of $7,500 In Q4 - half credit of $3,750 In Q1 - half credit of $3,750 In Q2 - credit is cut to $1,875 In Q3 - credit remains $1,875 Q4-2019 credits are gone Using Elon's make believe numbers: Tesla reached 200,000 in Q4 last year. The credits will be 100% gone on January 1, 2019.(*) Using the realistic optimistic production numbers means Tesla will post a series of massive losses."
Why is TSLA going down? I thought it was suppose to go to the moon like $1200... Serious replies only.
All the bashers here saying when it crashes people will lose money. Well yeah but if they only give back some of what they gained it isn't losing. I've only had shares since the end of November that I bought just under $550. It would have to drop 30% from the current levels and I'd still be even. So anyone who has had it pre split is not going to lose sleep thinking they might go broke. They have a ton of green to play with.
"IMO, the bubbles like 2000 will force FED to raise rates, and economy in spin."
So Tsla raises capital by diluting shares and gambles the money on Bitcoin?
today tesla opens below 20ma support. In short term it will test 250 again.

"Cobalt prices ==== almost doubled in a yearApril 20-2017 - $54,500 per tonne (LME) April 20 -2018 - $91,000 per tonne (LME) It is possible and likely that Tesla or Panasonic has hedged the price of Cobalt. Often times the way a supplier (Panasonic) hedges the price of a commodity is to pass the cost increases along to the buyer (Tesla) as a contractual obligation. Another way is to simply lock the price in with Cobalt supplier. We know that Tesla tried to do this with one supplier - Ivanhoe - and they refused to make a deal with Musk. Tesla cars contain far more cobalt than any other manufacturers. The costs increases will put them at a disadvantage."

"I'd love to share some thoughts on TSLA as I'm a money manager and a long time trader (yes both buy and sell) of the stock. Im not going to offer advice just give some clarity b/c as always it seems this message board is all over the place.Today's drop in share price is NOTHING to be concerned about. The security (TSLA) is acting just as anyone who is knowledgable would tell you. It had a TREMENDOUS run up over the past couple of weeks and some (not anywhere near all) people who held onto this are taking gains. This does NOT mean this is the beginning of the apocalypse and anyone who is reading that should be warned it's probably shorts who are littering this board. Yes, NIO is very attractive and will continue to grow. But TSLA is not just about selling cars as many of those EV companies are. They also rake profits on a SaaS platform whereby anyone using their open source for their batteries and internal displays need to utilize. So, essentially in many cases the more EV cars on the road, the better it is for TSLA.As for news....if you don't think there is anyone BIG news upcoming then you just don't know TSLA. I have had the opportunity to speak with Elon Musk in the past and in that ONE conversation he said that he prides himself on being able to move the stock price through a series of ""events"", some of which have been tweets obviously. Well, in about a week or so, you will be getting the ""deliveries"" for 2020 which will be announced BEFORE earnings report, which is due at the end of January. I'm 99% certain they blow past the 500K benchmark set forth and this will take the share price close to if not exceeding $700. Of course, weeks later, there is the Earnings Report which, if some other posters talking about option activity sinking the share price, will end up being a catalyst soon thereafter.All this to say stick to your guns with TSLA. If you're NOT a trader, then don't try to do it. Shorts have lost an exorbitant amount of money and if you think truly that the S&P is going to ""allow"" or ""permit"" a company to join that will tank and take the index with it, then you're just plain foolish.Hope this helps..."
"If you cultists think this is bad, wait until it crosses below 100 a share on its final descent to single digits.This is exactly why retail investors always end up losing all their money in stock bubbles. They thought they were geniuses in the way up, and refuse to believe the party is over."
"Mark Spiegel just posted an interesting take on the postponement of the European tariffs.“Trump postponing European tariffs is actually very bad news for $TSLA. Tesla's European sales are rapidly heading into the toilet anyway so counter-tariffs wouldn't affect it anywhere near as much as would U.S. tariffs on European EVs about to destroy Tesla in its home market.”This is actually terrible news for Tesla over the next 6 months as competition is heating up.Many people, including myself, just read the headline."

"Can't believe what I just read, Apple had be developing an electric truck for two years. But them abandoned the project, when it was determined that it would never be profitable (obvious parody). Sounds like the perfect product for Tesla. Dow developed a solar roof, that sorta worked, but they could not make a profit selling them, so put the kabash to it. And then, here's comes Tesla, with what? Yep, a solar roof. I appreciate the way Tesla is validating what real companies had already figured out."

"Here is why the bitcoin investment is a huge red flag. You can downvote and be a cultist or do your due diligence. Tesla’s market cap can only be so high, relative to other automakers, due it’s first move advantage. It has to develop quickly and capitalize to corner this market. It is a fewer years ahead of the competition. But the competition is fierce and tesla needs to grow and grow fast to justify it’s current stock price. So how does a 1.5 B investment in bitcoin help? It doesn’t! It squanders the capital it could put into new factories and R&D by making a gamble. It signals to investors that a huge bitcoin investment is more profitable then investing on their core business.This crash will be spectacular"

"Bob Lutz: Tesla is “going out of business”Bob Lutz is now flat out stating the company is going out of business.“At this rate they'll never get to 2019.”Lutz also makes the claim Tesla is selling its cars below cost, referring to the company as a “losing enterprise,”...“They are hemorrhaging cash,” he said. “They're going to have to go for another capital raise.”Lutz is an industry veteran who has worked for the likes of BMW, Chrysler, Ford and General Motors.

"In response to a large number of requests for my take of the monday eve ""ELON TWEET""------ I offer the following:.First a disclosure, though a longtime holder of TSLA , , and one who has grown to acknowledge the genius ability of Elon Musk, I don't worship him. He is brilliant, talented, CUNNING, cruel, and not a very nice person, certainly not a sterling example of transparent honesty. He has had to wage war with ""the shorts "" and industry enemies who sought to destroy TSLA and for many years had the upper hand, but in the last year he has turned that around in a big way. So while I don't worship him as many do, I certainly have a deep respect for his warrior ability. I see his tweet as just the latest chapter in the story of the ""war"". He certainly does not intend to sink the stock, but rather to walk the fine line he perceives in the best interest of the company that is his baby and his source for riches.. A number of things come to mind, we know that many people around the world want to buy a TSLA, many would wait if a new technology was imminent . He cannot have that, he wants and needs current sales to be robust. On the other hand, he also needs to keep good news flowing to support the lofty shareprice. I am convinced he has that news, we will learn some of it today, there will be more in the future, he will walk the fine line as he sees fit. Those who short TSLA , especially on weakness , should bear in mind and take very seriously his formidable warrior abilities. I, for one , I am not dismayed about the tweet, it is classic, typical Elon. There is more reasons I can think of for the tweet, but for now the above will suffice.The above being said, those of you who have followed my posts, know that I anticipate much more reasonable share price action than the extremists on the board. The extreme pumpers who spoke of $600 and more this week NEVER were going to be right. Those who think the stock will be at $1000 by year end are also wrong. I also believe the extremist bashers will continue to be wrong It is going to be interesting , that is always true for TSLA .................Less"
Absolutely no logic or reason to this lol idk what to think at this point
11:41 am News. JMP reiterates . TSLA to outperform with a 347 price target
time to sell tsla before elon sell his shares
TLSA is massively overvalued and is correcting along with the rest of the tech stocks. Short term downside is 500.
"Not selling a single share, because I don't think i will be able to buy back lower."
Michael Burry VS Elon Musk and Ramath Palihapitiya I will side with the business Billionaires who are long Tesla VS a millionaire investor who got one bet right and may never happen again.
That explains the large gaps in Tesla models: they were filled with drugs.
Why is the volume so big? It doesn't make sense or does it? Who wants so many oversold Tesla shares?
No learning from yesterday?

"I would feel much better paying $1,300 for a Tesla stock than $1,333 for an Ethereum coin.With Tesla you get 2 Giga factories that are up and runing, two+ yet to come... The possibility of owning a piece of XpaceX... And so much more.Etherum and other Crypto currencies just give you a piece of code?????I sleep well at night when I am invested in Tesla."
"Teslarians, here is a short history about The Musk while we wait for green. I think this will even inspire haters and shorts to change their evil ways and join us. (I've had bad luck with links so will post separately)."
There are 2 areas that I think people are going to play for Tesla in the near future. 50 sma and 200 sma. Currently the 50 sma is @ 481.91. It can adjust downwards as the share price falls. The 200 sma is @ 216.25. At both these prices Tesla is still considered frothy. As you guys know Tesla had a 1:5 stock split. Even at the 200 sma this puts this at 1081.25 pre-split. Still a frothy value. I think people are going to play both sma lines for a day trade. It's just too bad cathie wood got caught with her hand in the cookie jar. I like her but there are many thesis for Tesla and the bear thesis right now is winning. Stocks go where people want it to go. Not because of your conviction behind your thesis.
"With all the bitcoin promotion going on by elon........ We will probably see 100 ""dollar a share per tesla.. This guy is whack AF.. Can't wait to sell once it go back to 850..."
"At $327, I was back to breakeven with all my current and previous closeout TSLA positions/trades.But I have had significant amts of capital invested in this for months, which could have been making money in other issues.

"QS will soon take all the profits from the electric car industry. Without the great QS batteries, Tesla is just a bad phone."
its getting weak. Elon knows he needs to buy bitcoin to keep this up. Bitcoin will hit 200k++ on TSLA investment and TESLA will goto 1-2 trillion MC. If they don't back to the 400-500 range.

Elon musk going away from Twitter for while. What might real reason. I think It's about people asking to show real money support and he can't refuse and he can't go against establishment and actually put money. Our richest guy is really worthless can't fight he pretend believe in because he take too much favor from establishment and can't refuse to further commit because it will sure back fire and hurt $TSLA.

"From Motley Fool today's article: (sorry longs to ruin your party)...""To justify an $800 billion valuation, Tesla has to grow quickly -- and for a long time. If the electric vehicle maker ""only"" quadruples its sales over the next decade, the stock is bound to plunge sooner or later. Even if Tesla develops meaningful ancillary profit streams over time (e.g., recurring services revenue, battery sales to other automakers, an autonomous ride-hailing network, etc.), the company would probably need to grow sales to at least 10 million vehicles annually to justify its current valuation. It would also have to sustain margins far better than any other major automaker has ever managed."""
Tesla's done. See you around $500

"Tesla recall 200,000 cars safety issue"
"What Tesla really needs to do to re-ignite its growth engine is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for Tesla (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if Tesla just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem.

He bought in at $3.90, it was trading around $50 when insulted him a second time...today he's worth 8 million at the age of 46. Double my value.

If this is only a mild correction again, look for 548.If it is more sever 50 % look for 442,21.Most sever would be 62%, or 336.10.Below that, Bear Market.The worst scenario of 336,10 is 50 % more than Toyota's market cap.

"I have been looking at ""e-commerce"" stocks in my Value Line Reports (mostly companies like Workday which provide software services in the cloud). Most of them have never made a profit and the stocks have been soaring. Is this what the TSLA fans think TSLA is about? The beauty of the ""software as a service in the cloud"" model is that most of the costs (developing the software) is fixed regardless of the number of customers. Client acquisition is also a big expense, but, there there are large economies of scale and the dominant player is at a great advantage. Gross margins and operating margins are huge.But, despite all the protests that TSLA isn't just a car company, the fact is that nearly all its revenues comes from selling cars (or EV credits) and it is really just a car company. Growth will not greatly improve margins. You are not going to find buyers of a $25,000 car paying $10,000 for a self driving software package. Nor, are the mass of buyers going to appreciate a $100 software update charge being added to the monthly cost of their lease payment."

Bottom line, I wouldn’t want anyone other than Musk at the helm of TSLA. When he steps down, I hope whoever succeeds him is a very senior member."
"Just for comparison purposes, about Apples P/E of 40. Amazon P/E 95, Netflix 87, Tesla 1400....got it??"
short sellers get ramrodded again
"I keep hearing reasons why TSLA will go up. FIrst it was a stock split, then the excuse was incorporation into the S&P 500. I am curious, now what is the reason in the Kool Aid?"
Zeroing in on a bankruptcy date -- this is getting much more speculative -- but I've taken some (significantly) out-of-the-money PUT positions for September.
Why would anyone sell or short Tesla. Its growth years are only just beginning.
A Tesla car made in the USA and sold in Germany pays 19% VAT.A Tesla car made in Germany and sold in Germany pays 19% VAT.BTW the VAT was temporarily lowered last year to 16%. This would have tended to pull some car sales forward.
700 for sure tomorrow
Everything will go green the minute Elon tweets or speaks and he loathes short sellers.
if sndl gets to $5 I can and will buy a tesla
"When news of Musk bullying and name calling employees surfaced, even fellow multi-billionaire Warren couldn't sit quiet. Mr. Musk likely isn't playing with a full deck."
Sounds of desperation. A $78K compact car.
"I got short squeezed on two stocks today. Roku, and really bad on Wayfair. But it is all good, for I am heavily short TSLA. The fun is just about to start."
"This stock will end green today. Mark, My, Words"
"Irony is that $8.25 FRO is paying out a 50 cent per share quarterly dividend = the same 50 cent EPS amount that $2,175 TSLA earned in the 2nd quarter.In fact, if you wanted to get paid the same amount as $TSLA 2nd quarter sales revenue of $29 per share (= $6 billion sales / 207 million shares), then just buying 58 shares of FRO @ $8.25 = $478 would pay the $29 of cash dividends.And if you bought the same $2,175 TSLA worth of $8.25 FRO = 263 FRO shares, you would be paid $131 in quarterly dividends, close to the entire 2020 year of TSLA annual sales revenue of $145 per share (= $30 billion sales / 207 million shares)."
Sky rocket 
Tesla's core business is not profitable. Tesla's current cash reserves are less than the amount of stock it's sold since IPO. Tesla buys bitcoin... with cash received from stock sales.Is this a joke? This is a pyramid scheme wrapped in a pyramid scheme.
"Here is my biggest concern with Tesla’s valuation. Leaving a parking garage yesterday I noticed the incredible variety of cars around me. Many different makes and many different models (hundreds). People love variety, their car is part of their identity and what differentiates them from others. Based on Tesla’s current valuation the market is saying someday Tesla will make at least 30-50% of all cars on the road. That would be an incredible assumption because of the desire for variety in the cars we like to drive. I don’t see Tesla able to profitably develop such variety. I think Tesla will grow into a very significant and important company, but they will not be the Apple of cars because the car market seeks variety."

The down SP500 and Dow is temporary. Today there is profit taking for the purpose of delaying taxable gains until 2022.
Why is Tesla worth more than every other car company- 2 simple facts : 1.) 98% of consumers do not buy electric vehicles and Tesla has no products to even offer them.2.) But if you consider just the EV niche - the competition has no problems dominating.The best selling EV in China is GM's Wuling HongGuang Mini EV.The best selling EV in Germany is the Renault ZoeThe best selling EV in the Netherlands is the VW ID.3.The best selling EV in France is the Renault Zoe.The best selling EV in the Norway is the VW ID.3.The best selling EV in Sweden is the Volvo XC60.
"Congratulations to the longs, but this irrational exuberance can only go so far. He’s not making 1 million on each car he sells."
q1 doesn't get better. there are some callbacks due
Tesla will hit 1k next week and heading 2k within 2months.Wanna know more please leave ur thoughts.
Does it worry any Tesloons that the share price is down by more than $15 on average volume?
Based on the valuation Elon gets 50 mln shares each time I presume. I don’t know what is his last trench that would be the time he will unwind his position.If you are buying at these prices even God can’t save you!Gl!
It is hard to believe that someone is still buying $TSLA BUBBLE at that INSANE VALUATION! The stock price is up by 4000% in a single year FOR NO REASON!
Ark price target in 2025 for Tesla: 3000 usd! Bull scenario: 4000 usd!
"Don't forget- pre-split, it is still trading at $3,000/shares - extremely overpriced for the tech that is not something unique. all of auto companies are building same EV but with better features."
"Tesla will reach 100,000 a share within 2 years. This price target doesn’t even reflect how good this stock is. This is the future."
when and if the bottom falls out of this stock there will be a lot of weeping and gnashing of teeth!

It was a great run while it lasted. Will reload around $60
"I might be totally off base in this assertion, but I'll espouse it at any rate. I think there is a shift in long buyers occurring. I think retail investors are giving strong buying support, while institutions are slowly backing away. The only confirmation of this thesis is the last news I heard about T. Rowe Price and Fidelity Funds reductions in holdings. All speculation, absolutely no basis for this hunch....... just a feeling that a 40 year market veteran has in his gut."
"FB is valued at 770 billion compared to tesla at 700 bil. FB made 25 BILLION in earnings the last 4 quarters, Tesla made 560 MILLION with tax credits. O but Tesla isn’t overvalued. LOL So many examples of why this is massively overvalued."
Sliding again. Market open buyers are bagholders just buying the dip. The big money sells consistently so as not to disrupt the market.

"tesla is at 1200 p/e. Is that normal ? the stock will tank. there is not fundamental to sustain 1200 p.e stop buying based on future earning,it already hit its intrinsic value. Its a bubble. RUN before it bursts"
"Not sure why the longs are crowing like something wonderful happened. The company had record losses and is only trading about where it was 1 month ago. Tesla is supposedly at a 5k per week run rate and supposed to be at a 6k run rate by the end of this month an yet fElon is only forecasting sales of about 3800-4250 per week. Model S & X sales are flat to declining. Right now they selling nothing but the highest priced models that would naturally have the highest margins , especially since you do not get very much for the amount of money being paid for those options. But next year that mix is going to change markedly and the avg. sales price is going to plummet. Tesla has a huge amount of debt to start paying back soon. They plan on building a plant in China. They still need someplace to build the semi they took reservations and money up front for that is supposed to be in production next year. And last but not least the U.S. tax credit will start going away on Jan. 1 '19 and will be completely gone at the end of Q4 '19. And as we have seen previously everywhere the incentives go away so does the demand. But don't worry. It will all be just fine."
Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed in an email that Fremont Factory car production line is up and running as of yesterday Feb 25 after parts supply shortage.
"Like I said, at or below 580 at close. Then push down about $50 AH, good news or bad. Then it starts march to $1000 by Friday..."
"Tesla investor are whining about Tesla's decision to invest $1.5 billion in bitcoin. The $1.5 billion would have been sitting in the bank earninga a fraction of 1% or something relatively small for interest. With Bitcoi, $1.5 billion just made over 560 million yesterday. And what about from the time Tesla bought in January when it was only $34,000. The valuation it mades will show in the balance sheet as profit on next quarterly earnings. Bitcoin is risky and volatile but it starting to get support from big company and its times for Corporation to reap the profits of the liquid assets instead of the bank loaning their money to someone else."
lets do the split at 2k more people will buy more and more until reach Apple net. this tesla stock is awesome. I'm making what I lost and moderns and Pfizer. that was a fiasco...

It's so cute how strategic small purchases get TSLA artificially inflated in pre-market. Just adorable...

"""Reverse engineering"" ==== More Tesla hype ((( A few weeks ago, we reported on two Tesla Model 3 vehicles spotted in air freight inbound for Germany. We assumed that they were purchased on the used market by a German automaker to be reverse-engineered and benchmarked. ))).....((( “Each sub-assembly system was put to the test, but the testers were especially impressed by the power electronics. Compact, expandable, fully integrated, modular, easily accessible, well-protected, reasonably priced and astonishingly clever in many details – that was the verdict of the experts, to which colleagues from other manufacturers also agreed.” )))Stop suspending reality and think."
"Webbush analyst EV sale from 3% today to 10% to 2010.Today Tesla market cap is equal to rest of auto industry and yet even in EV Market they don't have even 25% market share. (At their 0.6% of overall market share, this is just 20% of EV sale.) How in world he can justify such valuation when company can't generate genuine profit today.Let's take their 2030 5 million scenario.Let's assume average car price is $45K today's dollar (Which no other car maker with similar or bigger size have today.). Let's assume cost of car is $30K. Let's say operating cost $6K (It is higher because Tesla run all stuff themself and I am underestimating. Profit per car is $8K ( I think with out insentive this likely <$5K for sure.So Profit is $8K at best case scenario. at 30M that's $24B profit. So in otherword it trading 40+ time 2030 earning today if Tesla able to dominate brand name and EV evolution continue and not divert to Hydrogen car (Which Elon refuse as viable option even for SEMI) and FSD without Lidar is sufficient ( Elon continue his chant on expensive and not needed even while all other expert keep saying it's absolutely nessasary for Safe FSD and other Automaker able to include in their offer that cost lower than Tesla EV car.Now question about their Battery technology. Look like it's already becoming outdated specially with $QS testing result."
"As a kid, my favorite cartoon was Looney Tunes' ""Road Runner"" I always wondered what the antagonists's middle initial ""E"" stood for. It's obviously Wile Elon Coyote.

analysts are not responsible for their assessments. they only drag people into a delusion who have no idea about stock valuations. they only help to improve their own margins. why do we only see insider sales? definitely not because the share is so cheap.
they should've never put this into the s&p 500.
If only we could directly invest in SpaceX. I don't want to buy Google.

Going to crash
"If you see charts TSLA has rallied whopping $200 in a span of ~6 months (From $180+ to $380+), so it can happen again this time with short covering bigger than the last time, Now TSLA is building 5000 cars per week, which was a dream when TSLA hit $380+ last time. We will trade beyond $380+ this time and reach all new times high several times going forward."
I just can't see how Bitcoin worth anything. Is Elon even allowed to use cash to buy fantasy money? What a joke. This stock is worse than I thought.
"Ok... so bitcoin is fallling like a heavy rock today... so that indicates tesla is loosing money today... profits for tesla are down... not because tesla has issues with its car sales, but because someone is taking bitcoin down... why is our tesla stock relying on bitcoin.."
Overvalued. By a historically high amount.
Going to test 330$ tomorrow
Will TSLA bring down the entire stock market when it dives? Maybe sell some calls in other bloated stocks.
$900 on Friday. mark it down
I want 10% today! Would be a good shorting point
"To everyone that says Tesla isn't a car company.... It is the EV optimism that has helped push the stock price higher, just look at NIO which has a market cap of $92B with only 44,000 sales last year."
"one thing is for certain... NOBODY acts like this when things are going great. Elon has basically pre-announced some sort of near term failure. There's plenty of evidence now that The Tweet was impulsive and not backed by reality. Which means, $420 is a made up number and the chances of that happening are simply random instead of ""secured"". But what IS now known is that there was desperation behind it. So, why the sense of urgency Elon? Why now?... is something lurking around the corner that you can no longer avoid?"
BREAKING NEWS: Every model 3 purchase comes with 1 million dollars space cash!
"(1500 shares) $269.34 - $323.00 AH that’s $80,490... believe me I thought about this for a long time.. But I took the $80,490 it’s just to much money in this market to risk..Longs it was rough, it was painful, but if it goes up tomorrow I wish ALL of you $400+...Cause we have earned it.. nice end to rough day"
APPLE + iCar = Tesla's Tomb
$775 will make Elon richest man in world.
"$BMIX This stock is heading up by end of week to a quarter and here is why. (1) Jan. 4 of this year BMIX landing a massive goldmine in securing (2) permits for dig of lithium in Brazil! (2)Elon Musk, $TSLA, saw the importance in lithium and mentioned Brazil as a prime location for it & then BMIX goes and grabs (2) permits!!! (3) Lithium is needed for electric vehicles which is trending. (4) There is an expected shortage of lithium so those that have secured permits will be Golden! (5) Democratic Party favors green (solar and electric) so this stock will rise at least for the next 4 years!"
Capital? We don't need no stinkin' capital!Tweet: We need a bunch of capital. About $420/share should do it.
Most down in pre market apart from tesla and baba..people coming to there sences. And jumping back on the tesla express all the way to 1000
"May is my call for the timing of the Chapter 11 announcment. I calculate that Tesla has less than $750M in cash, and much more money going out than coming in right now. Elon may be able to stretch it a little longer if there are enough fools willing to donate deposits, but that is unlikely with all the recent news. We are also going to see serious legal issues for Elon and Tesla in the next couple of months."
Finally the bid discount is on it's wayI'll buy at 580

"As the American economy declines. I think Teslas are probably the best choice in America than gas vehicles moving forward in terms of an investment. The reason is because versus an ICE (not hybrid) the cost to maintain and upkeey an EV is much easier especially with the less moving parts. The only reason the media portrayed EVs as a terrible option was because of corrupt dinosaur money.Electric vehicles are pushed harder in countries like Japan, China, EU, where they also are moving towards new energy. Elon Musk helped a lot in allowing electric vehicles to become a social norm. If it weren't for Musk, it would have taken 5-10 years more."

People quoting Elon Musk's brother selling $25m worth of shares should also state that this was just 10% of his personal shareholdings in the company. He had sold several time before in the last few years. People sell as they need cash for personal use.

Don't you recall Musk himself said Tesla was way overvalued at800- 900 a share pre split. That was when TSLA was trading at about 300 billion or 180 a share. Wake up! Owning 2-3 Billion in BTC can not save this stock. Also there are at least 15 competitors in the EV market now and Regulations and over taxation by states and Gov to pay for the stimulus money is just starting.

There has been a lot of price manipulation using Calls for the past few months and it looked like this was going to get pegged to $800 and there was over 130k volume in the $800 Calls that expire tomorrow. If this surges tomorrow like it did today, it is going to make some a lot of money and someone is going to lose a lot. I have been wondering if Options could be the cause of the next financial crisis like credit default swaps were in 2008. The Option volume has been insane lately, especially on the Call side."

"Tesla's success has sown the seeds of its failure. If Tesla hadn't gone up 10 times from it's price last March, but instead just rose a modest 24% each year, it might well have been an a successful track to increase in value 10 times by 2030.But, Tesla soaring stock price has drawn in a huge amount of capital into the EV market. The market always overdoes it when there is technological change creating a new product. There will end up being excess capacity and all the EV makers will be fighting for market share and profits will be meager at best. At least 1/2 of them will end up in bankruptcy. This is the lesson of the past. The 1960's had the color TV boom. Every household was going to buy one. And they did and the TV makers went bust or were bought out by the Japanese.Aluminum was the growth industry of the 1950's as lightweight aluminum was revolutionizing products. The big three aluminum companies advertised heavily on TV as the metal of the future. Kaiser and Reynolds have disappeared and ALCOA is still around ceased being a growth stock in the 1960's."
Tesla is diversifying into agriculture. Tesla tulip bulbs are under development.
Elon i played poker with you in Vegas Why would you talk about your hand ..Unless you shorted it... Come on man ..Gme????

"Ride’s over, hope you had fun"
"It's actually quite spectacular this stock has not crashed yet, considering more and more major car manufacturers coming out and committing to EVs in the future. This is going to eat in to TSLA's EV dominance and future growth that was factored into prior valuations. Not quite sure how analyst are coming out with these price targets over $800. Very risky stock to be buying at these levels IMO."

"A stock's price -- and its entire market capitalization -- is all based on the price of ONE share: the last one to trade before the quote is published. Volume numbers can be meaningless with algorithmic-trading, where a single share can be traded back and forth between two computers millions of times in a day, creating completely fictitious appearances of liquidity. So long as no significant numbers of shareholders try to sell, everything looks ""wonderful""; but the moment one-too-many shareholders try to convert their paper-gains into real money, the entire house-of-cards collapses."
Something appears to be very much a miss with the Bloodberg Tracker. My son’s M3 was in the 100k plus range and they are showing VINs delivered in the 120k area yet only built 94k. This would indicate Tesla is sitting on 20k of VINs. Bloodberg even shows VINs in the 115k zone delivered and it takes a few weeks at least to get there cars in a customers hands???? What gives? Bloodberg thinks Fremont is basically shut down. Could be to preserve capital for the end of quarter numbers
Can TSLA jump 5% or 6% tomorrow like AMZN or AAPL?
so are innocent individuals picking up the large amounts of stock that smart money sold at open today? Large volume first part of the day was impressive and hopefully will continue daily until BK filing when the bottom will finally fall out altogether.
A one product car company now valued more than all auto competitors combined. Absolutely absurd. Will be the short of a lifetime!
"To all Tesla long holders and believers:I know it's very tempting but don't sell a share. Think of all the good events were expecting this year. Giga Texas, Berlin, Tesla solar day, robotaxi, tesla insurance, new 4680 battery production, etc"
"For the shorts and bashers:Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is going to benefit so much from pent-up electric vehicle demand in China that one analyst says his best-case scenario for the stock will see it rocket 70% higher to $3,500 per share from its current price of $2,050. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives told investors in a note."
Bull case for Tesla. Berlin factory to straight up destroy BMW in Europe NEW Mega casting for front and rear of Model Y & 3 eliminating 60% of the build line Berlin Margins will break 30% OR Elon lowers his pricing again thus crushing its competition simply put he will be making better cars at half the price and selling them LOCALLY NO IMPORT DUTUES no SHIPPING half way around the world I can go on about FSD or that Tesla insurance is about to double by expanding into Texas. I can go on about a lot of other side stories Making a Bull case for Tesla is quite easy.
If you’re thinking of diversifying you’re EV portfolio then take a look at $VVPR. as a solar company they just announced their intentions to go into the EV market -specifically in Australia’s industrial market valued at 12b$ and figured to grow by 2b$ a year. Might be a good play with $TSLA $NIO $SOL Good luck to all
Like the Indian billionaire said. Don’t sell one share of Tesla! Only buy it!
"Follow Musk, Bitcoin is a better investment than TSLA"
I guess the moral of the story is to buy companies that will run out of money within a year.
Waiting for the tweets from Elon
"question for the shorts (and anyone with a view): if we are expecting a correction in the price next week, how do we factor in the sizeable holdings of S&P tracker funds now? As long as Tesla remains a component of the S&P, I would imagine a huge chunk of the shares bought in December (~70M on December 18th alone!!) wouldn't be sold off anytime soon right? any selling would be from smaller retail investors / investment funds with more discretion? Would be crazy to assume that as it is now part of the S&P, there is a lot passive capital that will remain invested in Tesla, and therefore keep a floor on any upcoming selloff?"
This platform is simply to come on and vent when all of us have lost money

Good night all... the earnings certainly surprised me (and I was thinking +50 to 200 million.) I think Tesla may have crossed the hump...

"It is historically significant that shares rarely fall in a straight line. However, I think tesla will be an exception to this. It is heading for 200 dollars in a straight line.I read so many immature comments on here that I fell the need to share some valuable insights with the inexperienced investors from someone who has over 20 years experience.Tesla is the worlds greatest ever bubble and it will crash.No this is not a time to load up.Get off this train if you can exit without incurring huge losses.Do it now before you are nursing huge losses when it goes below 200 dollars in as little as 8 weeks time."

"A Dogecoin walletthat holds almost $3 billion of the coin spent much of yesterday buying up the numeric equivalent of Elon Musk’s birth date. As picked up on Reddit, the wallet, whose owner holds $2.8 billion of the coin, or 36.8 billion Dogecoin, and is the biggest bag holder on the network, yesterday placed 20 transactions for 28.061971 DOGE. No coincidence, surely, that this mirrors the day Elon Musk was born: 28th June, 1971."
WOW....Looks like they are going to take this thing over $1000 by Feb. Then what? Worth almost 4X Toyota already.
what about Nio?
"The day TSLA realizes LiDAR is a must, SP will fall back to Earth."
"Low volume, no one was selling out. This stock is going to take off. There are daily Youtube videos about the progress at the Tesla plants under construction. It is mind boggling that they will have the latest technology, latest hardware, and facilities that can produce whatever they want. With Starlink, SpaceX, and Neuralink Elon has proven that he can make his visions come true. Who would have thought he could put hundreds of thousands of LOS in orbit? He already has 955 in his network orbiting now. I laugh when people come here and comment about Tesla being a car company and worth more than all other car companies combined. This is my second ride up the numbers and being long is fun with this company."
"Cramer commented the increases during the week: a self-fulfilling prophecy. S&P 500 fund managers have to buy as the periodic 401(k) money comes in. Prices go up as those fund, mutual fund, ETF’s, managers fill the orders per the formulae (by the market caps, I think). These purchases drive up the shares. Shorts need to cover due to the higher shares. Squeeze. High shares beget higher shares. Cramer predicts more analysts revisingtheir share targets come Monday. We have a cycle going. ."
Enjoy the ride down longs!
Expect Musk to ramp up his fraudulent Tweets and announcements as the stock price gets closer and closer to his margin call levels.

"J.D. Power released its annual quality study and it's terrible news for Tesla, which ranked dead last among the 32 automotive brands it measured."
All the leaders look like they are starting to roll over. I think we just passed the top a few days ago. Most of the charts are starting to look like break downs. We could still reverse here and I really thought we would stay up until stimulus checks and bonuses in March.
"""On Saturday NIO unveiled its first ever luxury sedan called ET7 which industry experts see as a competitor to Tesla?s (TSLA) model 3.""Now that is an understatement. We have all seem the fit and finish of the model three. We have all seen the basic interior. We have all heard about the ride, compared to that of a cabbage wagon. The model 3 is headed down the same road as the S and X, extinction. People don't want to just go 0 to 40 fast. They want to ride in comfort and luxury. Time for some new models Tesla. you have the money. How about three #$%$ prototypes this year for your fanboys?"
"In my humble opinion to those who noticed the GME short squeeze rally, the only way the squeeze can continue is if GME stock splits, allowing more retail investors’ inflow into stock. This is because as the higher the price goes the more it becomes difficult for retailers to commit to purchasing GME.Shorts should all be roasted."
Is it 342 pre market?
Musk has tweeted himself out of favor with Wall Street and TSLA will be punished severely. The market moving tweets have become a distraction and disturbing. A 50% retracement lands TSLA in the $400 range.
over $1000 24 hrs from now!
going green in a sea of red?
"Last year I couldn’t even afford a model 3 with my Tesla shares. Today I could easily buy two model X with all the addons. What a heck of a ride this is. Every penny deserved, this company is made up of many smaller companies and it’s going to change the world in ways most don’t fully apprehend yet, except for the longs that have understood this."
Tesla will pass Apple and Amazon guys. Goodbye Bezos. Tesla just passed Facebook cap. Goodbye Zuckerberg. Buy as much as you can and hold it’s that simple! See you guys at the 1 Trillion pit stop soon 
Do u guys think there's more downside or is it a good time.to get in now?

"Here's some predictions for next year:January 2nd Eletrek report on estimated Model 3 sales. The figures are again not good for Tesla - just 380 delivered in December. Stock falls below 300.Feb 2nd - Tesla reports 4th Quarter results. Its a beat - thanks to some credits Tesla only lose $580 million in the quarter. Tesla report that they may be trouble being a going concern withing the next 12 months. Elon states - ""no capital raise"" Stock falls to 240. March - Jaguar release the I-Pace to rave reviews. Tesla Model 3 sales hit 1000 for the month. Still somewhat behind the GM Bolt and now the Nissan leaf which sells 1500 for the month. Telsa now below $200.April - Tesla releases first quarter results - still another $600 million loss. August - Tesla enters Chapter 7. Elon Musk resigns to focus on Space XNovember.

"Would it be reasonable to hypothesize that the Tesla bear blitz is backed by a PR machine supported by institutional investors who want $TSLA shares to be cheaper (and reflect their valuation) so that they can buy at a heavy discount and also make $TSLA pitch-able as a ""safer"" investment for their clients?"

Norway just partnered with NIO on an electric vehicle initiative. Could have been Tesla ......lol.
Elon told u 800 pre split was overprice = 160. This can go down 75% more and still overprice.
"Can someone confirm Tesla options are American style, meaning they can be exercised at any moment instead of only at expiration?"
"I feel bad for those analysts that downgrade TSLA and lower its price target, the market didn’t listen to them. What a shame"
"It's amazing how much support this stock has. The other week the stock was hammered every morning and it kept recovering. Today there's massive downwards pressure and it's holding up pretty well, even after the huge morning sell. Hold the line, baby!"
"NIO +1000km car, bye Elon and Tesla!!!"
"For everyone concerned about P/E just remember, earnings day is around the corner and that number will no longer be that outlandish. Don’t forget Amazon had a similar P/E once"
"Musk, who has himself used his massive reach (he has around 42.5 million followers on Twitter) to spread misinformation to his many followers, specifically around COVID-19 and its severity, also followed that up on Thursday morning with a reply expressing a lack of surprise at WhatsApp's new Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, which will make sharing data from WhatsApp users back to Facebook mandatory for all on the platform."

"Tesla is not only a car company but also an ""IDEA"" company. Any time Musk gives any idea in a statement, it becomes belief in the market that it is bound to happen without any competition and investors pour money on its future bet without happeing materially. There is no shortage of blind investors in the market."
tesla SP tomorrow
many longs here are in denial and soon they will be in panic
"Funny seeing everyone panicked. Relax, TESLA WILL REBOUND!!"
"I am going to short Tesla - today. IMO the valuation has reached an unsustainable level, production & delivery challenges are sprouting up (which will likely be revealed in the 27th earnings call) and the competition is quickly catching up to chip into market share. The bold and committed investors will do the same; the curious, fearful or brainwashed will sit on the sidelines and watch the pullback without the financial windfall in their portfolios."
Q3 will be make or break for Muskrat love...I think it is obvious they wont be anywhere near profitable even if they sell a ton of Green credits to other car manufacturers.
TSLA should IMO be making an investment in HYSR as it has the technology. that has the potential to to either help TSLA and other car manufacturers or if ignored put them out of business. Do your own DD.
I wonder how many of you own an EV.
"put your hard earned dollar into hydrogen.the ego of this guy ,assuming we will all want self driving cars, just because it can be done ,doesn't mean its a good idea.space travel ???for one percenters maybe, but im not going to put my money into paying for the development of rich kids fantasy'sdo some good for the future ."
Hyped beyond belief. How many Teslas do you see in traffic? I see more Lamborghinis than Teslas! And I see a Lamborghini about once a year in general traffic.
Sell other shares and buy Tesla now
This cannot be compared to amazon. Amazon is used in the everyday life of pretty much everyone. The chances that you or anyone you know buys from amazon is relatively high. The same cannot be said about Tesla.

What elon musk is doing with tweets is legal and brutal to shorts. they are getting what they deserve... its that simple... it doesn't matter what assumptions you want to make about what the compnay can or cant do or if they will go under... no one can decide or know that but musk and his affiliates who have more money than APPLE is worth in market cap.
"If you take elon's email literally, it could mean that, with a huge push this week they will get the number over 2000. Last week could have been 1000. Next week could be 900. It does not say that we will produce over 2000 every week'Tesla (TSLA -5%) CEO Elon Musk sent an e-mail to employees at about 3:00 AM Pacific time to tell them that the company will pass the 2K Model 3s per week production pace if things go as planned today, according to Jalopnik.'"
"To justify this share price Tesla would have to produce over 50% of all cars sold globally. Currently in the countries with the highest adoption of ev vehicles they are losing ground to the likes of VW.Ask yourself if you think Tesla’s price will increase because you want it to, or because it is actually undervalued."
LOL this is hilarius
Is anyone cover at 253 ?
"The reason the stock continues to decline is because of his comment that Bitcoin is to expensive right now. People don’t understand why he moved 1.5 billion off of cash into bitcoin. Mostly because 90% of the world does not understand crypto and that bitcoin is a store of wealth. This is a good time to but Tesla stock!! Bitcoin will more than likely be at 90,000 by this April. Microstrategy getting ready to purchase another 900,000 this week starting today I believe."
FACT: TSLA is the ONLY realistic & significant growth story the market got right now.
"Musk: “If you have anyone who can do a better job, please let me know.”That number seems to grow exponentially every day."
"I've been holding Apple for 20 years.

Look at how low the volume is on this up move. MM manipulation to help funds out!
"Elon is playing with the shorts. Tesla deliveries have already crossed 500,000 for the year. I placed my order just today!"
Has Elon tweeted today?......about hiring Johnny Depp as a pitch man?
the 78 year old guy with dimentia is in control of your portfolio now.
Constant hype not earnings or value keeps this #$%$ alive. amzn pulled this off but there we no or weak competition. Tesla has deep and strong competion. AOL and Yahoo were in a similar situation in 2000. Where are they now?
Where is SEC?
Robinhooders think it's free to trade on Robinhood and other free platforms. They don't know that the order numbers are being sold to the big money so they can bet against. Then they get all the positive news from the boiler room. No jobs. You can't blame them for trying to make a buck but if they refuse to accept other opinions they deserve to fail in the long run. It's always about the long run.https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boilerroom.asp

Is it too late to short this?
Tesla+Nio+xpev and other ev companies the price is fallingSale some shares and buy the dip tomorrow
Glad I bought appl insteas of tsla
** BREAKING NEWS ** Tesla seeks FCC approval for a new type of radar.
"Investment is all about the future. Tesla has a lead over other car companies and holds 18% of the EV market. Extracted from another site is the following:""Earlier this year, Consumer Reports published its annual report on vehicle owner satisfaction. Once again, the report, which is based on extensive surveys of vehicle owners, found that Tesla owners are the happiest with their cars. In particular, the Tesla Model 3 won the 2020 competition."" VW EV transformation would place it second in the EV market followed by GM, Ford, and Nissan. Chinese companies such as BYD, NIO, XPEV, and LI are major contenders to the EV/Hybrid market in China.Personally, I would buy a Tesla over other EV car companies since it owns supercharging stations located all over the US, Canada, and Mexico. It has the ability to upgrade software over the air plus all the features you might find in high-end cars."
Shorts checking their bank account
Tesla upgraded to $1000. Only going up up up
"Test drove a Model Y Wednesday and it's true what they say, the car sells itself."
euphoria is not a good sign on the stock market. I've often made the mistake and afterwards I was punished. In the end you sit on losses and still hold onto the share because someone said something positive (Morgan Stanley) and you don't want reality to come true. be careful. i know the longies hate me
What's happening?? Is the flux capacitor out of banana peelings??
It's Ramen noodle for dinner AGAIN tonight for the poor Tesla shorters!
Simple math. Elon passed Bezos in wealth. Amazon trades at 3162$. Too the moon Tesla!!!!!!!!!
"SEC news is imminent. Once that is released I think it goes straight to 244 , maybe worse. ELON will be asked to leave . He was the company. I think the stock goes sub 200, 150 or so. As they really look into the books , it gets MUCH worse. This is my opinion of what's going to happen shortly."
your girl friend is going to be mine when I pull up my TSLA car right next to your GM/Ford cars.....think about that
"Does anybody know why the S&P, DOW & Nasdaq dropped yesterday at 11am?What caused that?"

6 month old recall news being spread by market makers who want to buy all of the shares before Tesla skyrockets to $1000 for 4Q earnings coming up!
"There def are some very similar comparisons to the late 90s early 2000's with the tech bubble. New technology with the internet. People veiwing computer stocks differently because it was a new era. Things got way ahead of themselves and crash. Sure Amazon and a few others came out on the other side but not after a big fall. History always repeats itself. Always. Humans never learn. Is this exactly the same. Maybe. New tech new era in cars, electric, etc. Stocks getting way ahead of themselves. Bubble. Probably. Bubble isn't bad unless you are stuck in it when it bursts. And the horror show happens when people buy the ""dip"" when the knfie is falling not realizing the bubble has burst making the horror show 10 times worse. Im treading lightly. Investing a little. Not betting the house, the car, or even the dog on it at the moment."

Adam Jonas who couldn't predict TSLA 1 year out ($10 price target pre-split) is making predictions about 2030. And the market cares. Wow.
"The value of Tesla has no bearing on the simple fact that they cannot even sell 500k cars per year. Yet nothing is wrong , right?"

"Tesla is not a stock, it’s an asset like Gold/Bitcoin. Just like Bitcoin, Tesla will only go up."
I was a pro Elon and Tesla but not this time. Any ideas of how Tesla can pass this problem?
"Ford, sold 4.6 millions cars in 2020 and has a Market capitalisation of $47 billion, TSLA sold 0.5 millions cars with a MC of $700 billion.$70 price target for Tesla still bigger than Ford and Quantum Scape combined at $68 billion.My believe $70/share is an ok valuation, assuming No Chinese, Korea's, Europeans or Japanese competition exists."

"Am only a small investor and decided to hop out of Tesla at 660. Made 250 a share. Turned around and put it into something that was 15 and has gained 3 bucks already. I love Tesla and plan to rebuy at some point, but I figured it was my stop short term and dont regret it."
time to bring it back to 900 guys...buy now before we get 950 after rocking earnings

$0.80/share earnings means $3.20 per year @ this price the Price-to-Earnings ratio is only 270. The stock should go up by at least five times.

This is all in the next 1-2 years."
"5,000 new orders for the LR Model 3 per week < ===== Doesn't make sense IMOTesla has been taking orders for this car for over 2 years (100 weeks). They have (had?) about 400,000 reservations. About 30,000 of these people wanted the LR versions ($50,000+). Let's call it 60,000 to make the believers feel good. That's about 600 a week. What would cause orders to go from 600 to 5,000 a week ? Did 5,000 Tesla fans recover from a long term coma ?"
I will try to open a position in TSLA if we get a significant pullback. I still think the current valuation is insane but at a lower level I like there charging station network. I want to reach 100 shares. To achieve this I will try to make money with puts on pullbacks and then buy the stock on the way down. I was able to break even with my puts this week by rolling into some 880 puts then roll them JAN15 840 after they triple. I also made some money with a 810 call on the weekly.
THIS IS A GREAT ENTRY POINT FOR ANY NEW INVESTORS>>>>THIS COMPANY HAS A TON OF UPSIDE>>>TONS OF MONEY ON BALANCE SHEET FULL SELF DRIVE COMING THIS YEAR>>>>>CYBER TRUCK AND SEMI>>>>>>STAY LONG AND BUY THE DIP>>>WE GOING UP
Crazy share price. Does not equate to its revenue & EPS!

Its time
Below $294. It's official. Less than $50 away from setting a new 52 week low by Labor Day.
"Observations about @elonmusk's $420 LBO announcement:First, the context is odd: Musk promised on the conference call that $TSLA will be forever profitable. So why does he need to go private to ""end negative propaganda from shorts""? And why let them off the hook at $420?Musk suggests there will be no controlling shareholder in the LBO. He also says financing is already arranged. Ergo, he implies a syndicate of lenders has already signed documents for the deal. This is odd for two reasons...First, Musk recently rebuffed an investment offer from Saudi Arabia. If you're passing the hat for the largest LBO syndicate in history, why say no to a big check?Second, a $70B syndicate would involve numerous banks, dozens of lawyers, and multiple boards of directors. It's been [over] 12 hours since the announcement, and none of these parties has confirmed Musk's claims.Which raises a general point: a $70B dollar deal is a Jupiter-sized briar patch of legal and regulatory rules. It's a minutely choreographed thing, with legal risk for any party that says or does the wrong thing at the wrong time. With that in mind:Why did $TSLA not request a trading halt until an hour after Musk's tweet? Why did the company belatedly post an email from Musk, rather than an official statement? Why did Tesla not file an 8-K disclosing details of the purported LBO?Musk says he will not sell in the deal. What about his ~$800M in margin loans? Will lenders accept illiquid collateral? What about change of control provisions on $TSLA's debt? Who will fund the mandatory tender?"
Biggest sell of of a stock coming soon. This will crash like nothing we have seen before

Thank you for whoever advised me to not wait for 250 and buy at the open yesterday.
$TSLA Market Value is now 750% greater than Volkswagen. The funny thing is Volkswagen Sales are 1300% greater than Tesla Sales...
You’d think after this long folks would realize you always buy the dip in this stock

CNBC; BREAKING: NTSB opens an investigation into Tesla crash in Florida
"the dumbest reaction yet ""people say tesla has no profits how do they build factories and have 20 billion in cash"" - HOW MANY ROUNDS OF STOCK SELLING.... lol if you sell shares at exhorbitant prices you have raised cash. NOT from the net income but from selling shares to investors and that's why tsla is heavily debated because tesla could have never gotten to this point without selling shares over and over again. now... they are at a point where they need to be profitable because theyve promised so much with products and a self sustaining business... but we will see"
More then likely will be a great long term buy but this gotta be FOMO and some lol healthy correction is needed. I can’t imagine people are adding to their positions or opening new positions at this expense. TSLA is about to have the market of FB on 1/3 the revenue 
Tesla went green today. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
TSLA trading at $840+ already in FrankfurtI can't even imagine being short this stock. The pain just has to be indescribable.
"Oh my, below $700 again when that happens it ususally spells huge downside action. Please, please be careful the P/E vs. mkt. cap is very high."
Another shellacking after hours even as Naz futures run higher. Look out tomorrow.
Every time TSLA goes up 50% and then drops 10% the haters act like they've won.Someone needs to explain to me the math on that.
Future will open in 1 hour 12 min. I will be watching S&p future.
"I love these quotes from today's Yahoo article...""Elon Musk says a bunch of stuff which seem to indicate one thing, and then the quarterlies, which are legal documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, say something completely different. He doesn't outright lie, but his statements are as humanly close to a lie as possible.""Nardone says that Tesla is ""so far behind"" in manufacturing the Model 3 that it is a wonder the stock hasn't completely tanked. ""The only explanation I can find for why the stock hasn't cratered is that people that do own the stock have fallen under his charismatic spell and they believe what he is saying and even extrapolate from his words things that he hasn't said,"" he says. ""It is almost a cult."""
Shorts here never learn.
700 finish? Haha. Muskface had a mile headstart on the whole ev market selling overprice Model S at over $100k each yet still never could make a profit on selling cars. Now the competition will swamp market in 2021.....use common sense you blinders wearing bulls. Just because you have long position should not eliminate your objectivity
the whole world is embracing green energy movements. more EV and more new highs for TSLA and other EV makers. so invest in several EV makers of you can......go TSLA!

"I highly recommend that no one take delivery of a Model 3 built in late April, 2018."
"The company delivered 499,550 vehicles during 2020, above Wall Street estimates of 481,261 vehicles"
Yeah.......going private is definitely the best option.No doubt about it!
"I believe China will reconsider their love with Tesla. They have to protect their local car makers, like they are doing with IT companies now. Safety concerns is a good point to start with. More bad news from China are coming this year. It would be a hard blow for Tesla to shrink their most promising market."
755-775 CLOSING TOMORROW... SLOWLY STEADILY GOING UP !!! WILL SURPASS ALL TIME HIGH WITHIN MARCH WHEN MUSK ANNOUNCES TSLA WILL HIT THE PRODUCTIONS TARGET !!!!!!!!!
A big factor in Tesla growing demand is customer satisfaction. Many of its buyers invest in TSLA because of the company’s perceived future earnings and value. They’ve built a better mousetrap.
Down down down. Watch for $600 soon
Why is this car company trading at 1000 PE ratio instead of 15?
There is EV competition?Tesla is not just an Electric Vehicle like the others. It is an Electronic Vehicle. It is the fundamental difference.
"“The speed crown matters to automakers. As we noted earlier this week, most all of the major auto manufacturers have been frightened by Tesla into embracing hybrid and/or electric vehicles. How successful Tesla is as a car company is almost beside the point and is surely open to extended debate. But it has already forced the rest of the industry into following its electric lead.” https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-11-17/tesla-keeps-scaring-the-other-automakers"
Carefully reasoned scenario as to Tesla's valuation...
Elon will slowly convert your TSLA investment into Bitcoins.
"Toyota generates $250bil revenues, with $25bil profit... only worth pe 9x $210bil..... Tesla worth 4x with 10x less revenue, 25x less income.... BUT TESLA IS GROWING... so who knows what's what... it's just awesome"
There's no way this accountant is leaving 3 weeks before end of quarter if they are having a good quarter.
Elon Musk in the near future.
"Is this a swinging opportunity?Notice the price is hovering around S&P entry level. Since index funds are just tracking S&P recent price fluctuation is probably due to retail spooking and profit taking, notice there is inflow of larger transactions. This suggests in my opinion that it's not gonna move down too much and fluctuate around 690 till some catalyst (Stimulus maybe) moves it up! let me know what you think. You may disagree but let's hear your reasons, everyone is familiar with bubble and overvalued argument so that won't add anything to the discussion."

"Elon is buying 1,000s of cars each quarter why not he makes more on the stock price. He can melt the cars and still make money"
Tesla's daily price swings are greater than the total market cap of Ford..............lol ...too funny
Was that Musk I saw dumping bags of nickels and pennies into the CoinStar at Walmart?
I’ve watched this TSLA go up on upgrades for the last year. They produce less than 1% of the cars built but the company is worth as much as all car companies in the world combined. Can stocks just go up on upgrades?
YESSSS!!!!! It ended in GREEN!!

"Can any of you explain HOW, as a private company, Tesla stock, if any of you keep it, could actually increase in value?? To my knowledge, stock in a private company doesn't move one way or the other. Stock in a private company becomes a percentage of ownership. If someone wishes to see how valuable their ownership might me, an outside business appraiser would need to conduct a full-scale audit on the company to determine worth. In other words, and as I've said before, moving one's stock from public to private IS NOT POSSIBLE. Doubt me if you wish. No amount of wishing, hyperbole, or seances will change the outcome."

"The current short-term Wall Street bet is now on cyclicals, thus Ford and GM are temporarily rising because they're car companies. And Wall Street is driving down Tesla stock -40% from its recent high because it's a ... car company? Hmm, confusing. But not really. All of that just proves Wall Street finally believes the indisputable global EV leader Tesla is actually a tech company that just so happens to make cars. So when the short-term shortie dopes on this discussion board cluelessly claim Tesla is only a car company that should be valued as such, just ask them: Given that Wall Street is now temporarily shifting some money to cyclicals (e.g., car companies), and if Tesla is only a ""car company,"" then why has Wall Street put Tesla in reverse price-wise while rising the stock price of the cyclical antiquated ICE car companies? [Cricket sounds ... ] There's your answer: Even the hopelessly clueless Wall Street finally figured out Tesla is a tech company that happens to make cars. All of Tesla's so-called ""competitors"" don't have the foggiest clue how to catch up to the innovative global EV leader Tesla which is many, many years ahead of all the ICE-makers. Just imagine the next few years: Each antiquated ICE gas-guzzling automaker may come up with some half#$%$ EV that sells maybe 25k or 50k units a few years from now. All the antiquated ICE companies will have tons of growing pains with their half#$%$ EV joint-ventures. Why would anyone want to spend their hard-earned money on some antiquated ICE gas-guzzling manufacturer's first shaky attempts at an EV when Tesla's been designing and manufacturing EVs for 21 years? Answer: They wouldn't. The great thing about the antiquated ICE automakers' announced attempts at EVs is that it's now bringing huge global attention to EVs. That's more free advertising for EVs. And when the world thinks ""EVs,"" it instantly thinks Tesla. And when the world thinks Tesla, it thinks ""EVs."" This is all going tremendously in Tesla's favor. If you ask Elon, he's loving this. Elon would say: Go ahead and compare the ICE-makers' half#$%$ EVs to Tesla EVs. Bring it on. The EV industry is booming!"

I have 75 shares as of now. I have no doubt I will become a millionaire within the 2020s; my question is whether I will become a multimillionaire or not by 2030. Or I mean multiteslanaire ;)
tesla may be right about the 2500 and 5000/wk numbers after all.I suspect there will be at least 2500 cancellations per week by the end of q1 and 5000 cancellations per week by the end of q2 and bankruptcy by the end of q4
Keep strong grips of your baggies Longs cause nothing but downhill from here and on.
"Tesla Would Take Nearly 1,600 Years To Make The Amount Of Money The Stock Market Has Put Into It......."
is Tesla excempt from all crisis aspects ? Analysts increasing their target prices all over with old arguments = nothing new. Results for the 1st quarter should come about 29th april...well....buy on rumors (analyst reports) and sell on facts :o)
tesla shorts cover now or $1000 at next split announcement
This has peaked.
all the people with the instant testing think they will get out of this in time... no one will buy.. you get stuck.
"Just an observation... Shorts are not going after this stock anymore so there will be no more squeezes? The price is completely driven by retail investors, who are simply having FOMO and like Kramer said simply because this stock didn't go down for a long time. In the past several days, ARK has sold its shares of TSLA... More and more articles of overvaluation are coming out... so my question is it time to sell or hold till 01/27?"
"""I am become meme, Destroyer of shorts,"" Musk tweeted. Your superhero, ain't ""right"", if you know what I mean. He is also a engaged in criminal stock manipulation, imo."
"8k cars in Janprob 10k to 13k cars FebFor March... China has 3100 cars, Europe around 5000 They will sell these and some more shipments might make it in time for March delivery.But that's it Tesla will be lucky to sell 45k cars in 1Q. And the US sales coming look to be RWD cheapies-so less revenue/car.And 1Q will be the best quarter of 2019 for Tesla.It's all over for Tesla, GET SHORT!."
Stop selling people this is a strong buy right now cancel your sell orders for 2 days this will be at $800
Tesla never made sense at $700 pre-split. It makes way less sense now at $3500 pre-split. Tesla needs to sell every car on Earth to justify today's share price. Think about that. Also think about the lies that all these so called analysts keep pushing out to spin this higher and higher.
$4500 ev is a joint venture of saic and gm
NIO has better cars in few aspects...In China battery swap option will play a big role!

Let that sink in. $TSLANetflixAndLamp added,Elon MuskVerified account @elonmuskReplying to @physicsJRoughly 4 to 20 minutes for light to travel from Earth to Mars3:57 PM - 21 Jan 2019"
Dead cat bounce. Did Elon put the Souffle in the microwave?
"q1 projected loss is $800 mil, @ 29,980 units or -$26,684 loss per unit... 27% of total units are m3's... As the 3's increase, $40 - $80k less per unit is collected.. How much less does it cost to build the little m3 gems?.. Still waiting to hear how thiswill ever work?.. Also might want to keep in mind q3 cash burn = $1.4 bil, and likely headed back that way with interest onlydebt expense with other cost factors and issues at work.. = -$46,698 loss per unit, with q3 cash burn from 2 1/4's ago."
When Cathie Wood reiterated the $4k target the other day it was a secret code signal to her hedge fund buddies to sell and fast...  Did anyone else pick up the signal or was it just me?....
Where are my bulls at?
If you are limited by the number of batteries you can produce then why not sell the most profitable cars? Drop the cheapest from the list for the moment. Makes complete sense to me. People are more satisfied with the long range versions in any case. All makes good business sense.
Selling flamethrowers was the jumping the shark moment
"Tesla had a 5 for 1 split several months ago. Now it’s selling at $840 and 1 analyst has a $950 target. Do you realize that means the stock is selling pre split at $4,400 a share? Tesla pays no dividend, so who would pay $4,400 for a share of stock that has a PE of over 1,000. All the Tesla fans have made Mr. Musk the richest man in the world. When reality finally sets in, ask yourself are you really willing to pay $850 or $$4,400 pre split per share of stock with your hard earned money? Less than 6 months ago analysts thought $1,000 was high before the split. Too much competition to think Tesla has a lock on the auto industry going forward. The other guys are not going to lay down and not compete in the EV sector. There is going to be competition, so is $840, $440 or $100 realistic? Time will tell."
Now this is a rude awakening.
"Did you guys see how Elon comes with a buch of news at a time like these? video update, 25k teslas and all that? do you see how he do things and all this times? that's who he really is. reason for all that is to manipulate stocks. think and look at his actions and timing and events. you will understand his intentions."

The announcement regarding the Saudi's investing 2 million dollars in Tesla just a little less then 1 1/2 hours prior to Musk's going provate tweet also leaves me with a couple of questions. What exactly did they get for that $2 bilion? Did they get equirty of in the company or was this a cash infusion into the company?
"Oh, my! ""Tripp claimed that punctured battery cells had been used in certain Model 3 vehicles."" ""Even though no punctured cells were ever used in vehicles, batteries or otherwise"" according to Musk.Elon, can you please define the otherwise?"

"Just purchased a Maserati because I've always loved their styling. I learned they come with Ferarri engines, great styling and the most advanced electronics you can ask for made by Panasonic. As a panasonic shareholder, I'm constantly impressed with what they make and the markets they serve. More importantly that they are dropping the low priced, low margin electronics and moving into automotive electronics where they not only supply all the batteries for $TSLA, Toyota and many other EV makers. They also make for them, the most advanced electronics and entertainment systems. $PCRFY is a growth company and will eventually see a market cap of $500B."
"Who else wants to bet this will go right back down 2-3% tomorrow? There seems to be the very consistent pattern lately, up 3% and then right back down."
"+7% on TSLA today equates to an incremental market cap rise equal to GM's total market cap.Makes sense given how many more cars GM sells than TSLA, and the many more EV cars GM will shortly be selling than TSLA."

"There were a lot of interest in GM this morning, I would like to share a quote form Barron's today on this:""GM has been investing a lot in EVs recently. The company plans to have 30 all-electric vehicles on the market by 2025. What’s more, GM plans to spend roughly $27 billion in capital from now to then on EV and autonomous-driving development.""Now, where do you think the $27 billion in capital is coming from? two ways - sell more stocks, or provide the funding from its cash flows. Either way, it will be very expensive for GM to do that relative to its total capitalization.

"The crash will be epic, when people realize that it will be impossible to sell FSD for 100k. This is only possible if FSD drives better than a human and there is really no intervention by a human necessary and every situation.

Musk issued to Tesla employees that Tesla’s stock price “will immediately get crushed like a soufflé under a sledgehammer” if Tesla doesn’t reach the profitability Wall Street has already priced into the stock.Musk himself famously tweeted that “Tesla stock price is too high imo” back on May 1 ($148.74 high of day). Tesla’s stock price has roughly quadrupled in the seven months since that warning.This is going to be VERY exciting to watch.

The manipulators then rush in to bring it back up.The basic shares used to rotate around will be dumped in the end on the robinhooders. I'd call that the propeller and in the meantime they just drive the price up for themselves or other third party with which they have an arrangement. It might be Musk himself.I followed it a couple of days...and this is what I saw.Ideas? We can write an e-mail to the SEC afterwards."

"Traditional auto makers from Asia to Europe to the Motor City have been trying to catch up with Tesla, announcing scores of projects and billions of dollars of investment plans.Auto industry executives have long looked at Apple's balance sheet and worried what kind of muscle it could bring to a business that has traditionally incinerated lots of cash and resulted in low margins. Apple had around $192 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand at the end of its latest financial year that closed in September."

"GM’s new Bolt EVs are unimpressive. They’re high priced and deliver lesser power than Tesla Model 3. I have test driven an older Bolt EV and it’s nowhere comparable with a Tesla. I’d rather pay a few thousand dollars more to get a Model 3.As these big companies drag their feet on EVs, the relatively low priced Cybertruck is projected to be on the streets this year. Elon has said that he’s looking to bring a $25000 car in next couple of years. If the government decides to extend tax credits to ALL vehicles and not just an arbitrary first so many x00000, watch the demand for $TSLA vehicles grow beyond your wildest imagination.I believe that Tesla will be the undisputed leader in the battery and vehicles market in a couple of years. It is unstoppable; and deservedly so. $TSLA kept going even as it faced liquidity issues. Other car manufacturers like $GM, $F, $TM, $HYMTF barely paid attention to this market segment despite having a strong brand name and deep pockets. They had several years to bring out a well priced and quality EV but were ineffective. I can’t help but think that these big automakers are finally taking interest in the EV market because of $TSLA rich valuation."

"Just a reminder and as stated in the 8K Filing on February 9,“We continue to target weekly Model 3 production rates of 2,500 by the end of Q1"" So we are now just a couple of weeks away from the ramped up production. They must be flying off the line about now."
"Observations about @elonmusk's $420 LBO announcement:First, the context is odd: Musk promised on the conference call that $TSLA will be forever profitable. So why does he need to go private to ""end negative propaganda from shorts""? And why let them off the hook at $420?Musk suggests there will be no controlling shareholder in the LBO. He also says financing is already arranged. Ergo, he implies a syndicate of lenders has already signed documents for the deal. This is odd for two reasons...First, Musk recently rebuffed an investment offer from Saudi Arabia. If you're passing the hat for the largest LBO syndicate in history, why say no to a big check?Second, a $70B syndicate would involve numerous banks, dozens of lawyers, and multiple boards of directors. It's been [over] 12 hours since the announcement, and none of these parties has confirmed Musk's claims.Which raises a general point: a $70B dollar deal is a Jupiter-sized briar patch of legal and regulatory rules. It's a minutely choreographed thing, with legal risk for any party that says or does the wrong thing at the wrong time. With that in mind:Why did $TSLA not request a trading halt until an hour after Musk's tweet? Why did the company belatedly post an email from Musk, rather than an official statement? Why did Tesla not file an 8-K disclosing details of the purported LBO?Musk says he will not sell in the deal. What about his ~$800M in margin loans? Will lenders accept illiquid collateral? What about change of control provisions on $TSLA's debt? Who will fund the mandatory tender? Why did Musk's initial tweets portray this as a done deal, if his subsequent email revealed it to be merely his intention?Were these plans in the works when Musk publicly predicted a ""short burn of the century"" and a short squeeze larger than Volkswagen? Were they in the works when he aggressively purchased $TSLA shares in the premarket?If this deal is real, it won't be wrapped up for at least 6 months, and probably longer: a) need to assemble an independent board to vote on the deal (a court ruling this year decided that $TSLA's board is not independent of Musk), b) need a proxy statement with extensive risk disclosures (some think this is why $TSLA couldn't take the Saudi PIPE in the first place), c) need a shareholder vote, d) need antitrust review, even if perfunctory.Meanwhile, cash burn continues - in order to avoid default on their ABL, they must have cash/avail on Jan 1, 2019 sufficient to cover both 2019 convert maturities as well as a $400M buffer. That comes to $1.8B. At June they had $2.2B of cash and are burning close to $1B per quarter. Tough math.Musk says shareholders won't be forced to sell. How does that work? A private company with thousands of shareholders is still required to make SEC filings. How will unaccredited investors retain shares?The fact that none of these details was alluded to by Musk is further evidence that Musk has not discussed the deal with lawyers. Which brings us back to the question: how do you line up $70B in financing without involving a legal team?"

People buy cars for lots of reasons. Just because Tesla had the ONLY EV crossover on the road in the US, didn't make it the best. Now the competition is showing that there is more to BEVs than rapid acceleration and an infotainment screen.The price of the shares assumes that Tesla will sell ALL EVs to ALL car buyers in the very near future. But the reality is they are down to selling 1 out of 10 EVs and the competition is just starting. It's a good business to be sure, but 1x sales is probably appropriate.Guru."

Does anyone has any guess why Musk is flying to see Larry? Musk is not a vacation man!Go TSLA the only EV manufacturer per many evaluators conquer the world but some short sighted!
"With TSLA being in a dip and heading to 500$ level, no fast recovery. You can still jump on it in the next weeks. Hold the shares you have. Easy money to be made fast are cheap stocks that Wallstreetbets are promoting like GME, AMC, HCMC. HCMC is at 0.0025 right now with the forecast to go up to over 1$. Once you make some profit you can always buy more TSLA later, even model Y with it. There is no reason to sit and cry and watch a dip/crash for the next days."
"The manufacturers have their own #MeToo movement.First Musk declared that Tesla Wants to Be the World's Best Manufacturer, then Toyota, and now Kim Jong-un announced that North Korea Wants to Be the World's Best Manufacturer.Who's next?"

Man I had so much fun reading the comments on here. Seems like a lot of folks think Tesla just makes cars and thats it. LOL!
Good job fam! Will go even higher after earnings. I'm so excited.
"Greetings. I have a question for all of you here. Have you ever owned a Tesla? If you have made a lot of money on T)esla stock and have not bought one, shame on you. And if you can afford a Tesla but have never driven one, drive one today. I am on my second (first was S, second is an X, both pre-owned) and have turned many friends on to it, and they all are as passionate as I am. It just drives way better, and is way safer and smarter and just BETTER. More and more chargers and superchargers are popping up so the charging issue is all but gone and soon gas stations will include charging stations as well. I charge mine using the 220V outlet for my dryer in the garage, works like a charm. Lost my free supercharging when I traded in the S for the X, but it's worth it, the X is just Ludicrous.And can I buy a Tesla in brown or green? No, will I be able to in the future? Probably. Can I buy a Tesla convertible? No, but someday I will. Can you buy a Tesla in New Orleans? Don't think so. Can you buy one in every state? No, but someday but you will be able to. Can I watch a Tesla commercial on t.v.? No, but would that increase sales and awareness? Maybe. Tesla in some ways is in it's adolesence, and I see the future as bright. Is the future bright for Tesla stock? I don't know.that All I know is that I'm guessing that at best, a small per centage of people that can afford a Tesla has driven one, meaning a huge per centage of people that can afford one has not driven one.The future is bright, even with the imminent competition. EV's are the future, and to repeat, if you have made a boat load of money on Tesla stock, then buy one!!!! Why would you not?"
"It's good to see Model 3 production stabilizing (around 4,400 / week). Perhaps now they can finally concentrate on that quality thingy, that Tesla buyers don't seem to care about."
Futures mean NOTHING. Watch the interest rate on the 10yr. The higher it rises above 1% the more of a headwind it becomes for high PE stocks aka BUBBLE STOCKS. You’ve been warned 
Without Government subsidies Tesla would have lost money in the Q4 2020. Tesla's business model relies on Government subsidies.

you realize that this priced larger than the entire auto industry that also makes electric cars and actually has significant earnings. what is actually funny is that musk became the richest man from a company that since its ipo has lost just under 10 billion dollars. but they've sold lots of stock so i guess that's what matters in todays market.

"GM, with millions of cars sold and a dominant auto position, has done poorly as a stock over the years. Its entry in the EV business will do nothing more than reduce its dominant position. The illusion is to think GM should be re-rated because it’s entering the EV business. TSLA is higher because Tesla is growing insanely and will be a dominant player in the new world order. It’s coming from nothing. But, GM’s total auto business and profits will SHRINK as it enters the EV fray. It is getting weaker. The loss in ICE sales/profits will NOT be made up with its EV sales. A company with declining overall sales/proftis and dominance will see a falling stock after the hoopla is over."

"The fact that stock has moved up so much today after all the rally in the past 1 month, the earnings results will be blockbuster.

Apparently on twitter alot of call options have been cancelled. The call options on Tesla have forced firms to buy to hedge. Now there are more put options skew. So firms will sell which will beget more selling. This crash is going to be epic. Don't forget that shares can go down as well as up.

What is the difference between a short and a broken clock......The clock atleast tells the truth 2 times every day.
"You guys have to stop valuing Tesla as just a car company. I agree from a auto manufacturing perspectives it’s overvalued but you have to think about Tesla’s other business lines and revenue streams (software and services, battery supply, robotaxis, stationary power, insurance). I’d say 30-40% of its current valuation is related to its car business. Not to mention that Tesla is light years ahead of other EV company and has gained not only marketshare share, but trust. I’m a CPA and have been studying fundamentals for nearly 20 years and this company is not even close to be fairly valued. Open your eyes to value and not short term pessimism. Tsla will probably go down a bit today due to yields, chip shortage, etc. but when things normalize, I hope you do you DD and realize the value in this company. God bless all bulls and shorts."

11 days from order to delivery. The demand for the higher priced models and features must not be going as well as planned. We know production has not ramped nearly enough to be able to turn around a vehicle that quickly. So my guess is if they do actually still have 400k+ reservations they are about 95% for the lower priced models and or from countries that they are not yet selling to. So if they run out of orders for the high priced models and options prior to 3-6 months worth of at least 5k production of the higher end models will they be forced to start building and selling the lower priced models sooner than expected? If so will that cause them to lose money and die?https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/eleven-11-days-from-order-to-delivery.123633/

As of next year, the 12-brand group will roll out a new battery-powered model “virtually every month,” Chief Executive Officer Matthias Mueller said at the company’s annual press conference. “This is how we intend to offer the largest fleet of electric vehicles in the world.”______So, 3 models this year, and a new model every month next year.Questinatorhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-13/vw-secures-25-billion-battery-supplies-in-electric-car-surge"
"How can Tesla offer immediate delivery of Model 3's available when they have over 400,000 on back log with some of those orders now over two years old? If you go onto Tesla's web site, the only Model 3's available are the rear wheel drive, starting at $49,000 or the dual motor all wheel drive for $54,000 or the performance all wheel drive for $64,000. I would have to state without any hesitation that Musk is telling all of those that are waiting for the basic Model 3, priced at $35,000 to pony up to the higher priced model on sit and wait till hell freezes over to get the basic one. In the mean time, he's going to use your deposit money to try and keep the company afloat."

" 600 MILES ON A 25 Minute charge NOW IN THE WORKS; Does $TSLA Know about this? Read the end for the positive answer. THE FACTOIDS: The combination of Romeos new partner, Ecellix, with their high energy density materials, and Romeo Power’s advanced truck battery architecture, has the opportunity to reduce the weight of a 1 MWh battery pack by up to 9,900 pounds. This is equivalent to reducing the weight of a battery-electric Class 8 truck by up to 25%, therefore exceeding 660 miles of range on a single charge.""We are thrilled to collaborate with Ecellix. Their battery material technology is impressive, adding up to 50% more energy to current generation lithium-ion batteries,"" said Lionel Selwood, Jr., CEO of Romeo Power. ""Together, we can accelerate the clean energy movement and offer tiered products to meet and exceed our customers’ requirements at every level.""

"Tesla is not just a car company so comparing it with Ford, Toyota, etc. is not really comparing apples to apples. Tesla is not only your traditional auto company. The tech that goes into making a self driving car has a lot potential applications else where. The other auto companies are years behind Tesla... Tesla is also an artificial intelligence company. It's an energy company, a space company, insurance company .. Another difference with the traditional autos is that they dont have an Elon Musk. :)"

"Answer me this. If Musk really have investors lined up to buy all the remaining shares of the stockholders that can't/won't keep their shares after going private at 420, why aren't they already loading up on the open market for a huge discount? Why would they wait and pay a huge premium at 420? Why didn't they jump in on Friday?This isn't a hostile take-over where Tesla is in a position to set the price. No, Musk is explicitly putting Tesla in the showroom and is desperately eager to go private. He manoeuvred himself in a position where he now doesn't even have a choice any more.Do the longs really believe Musk is pulling the strings at this point and is in a position to set the buy-out price?Do the longs really believe 420 is still a target to go private?"
SHORTS DON'T REALIZE ...how much they are contributing to this stocks meteoric rise. When I thank them from bottom of my heart. They get mad. I'm in a bind.
"In all honesty, if Tesla was to build, and sell at a profit, 50,000 Model 3's in 2018, it will be consider quite an achievement in itself, imo, to go from essentially nada in 2017, to those numbers in one year. Doubling that number in 2019 to over 100,000; also impressive, 200,000 in 2020 would be unprecedented. And all extremely do-able. The problem arises when Mr. Big Mouth starts throwing unsustainable exponential growth claims, then falls flat on his face. The story should be that Tesla is doubling Model 3 production year-to-year, not ""Tesla Fails to Meet Guidance, Again"" And all this is needlessly brought on by the extraordinary claims of a megalomaniac. Being good and successful is not enough, Elon needs to be ""special"". Poor management at Tesla may turn what should have been an American success story, into a heap of smoldering ruins, all for the sake of one man's ego. Taking it personal? Not really, just call it as I see it."
Imagine coming to a board ALL day EVERY day to bash a company you missed out on  big ole weirdos Same few people here all day everyday trying to scare people away the same way they were scared years ago
"I for one actually find it surprising and strange that Elon gave that NYT interview in the manner he did. Being so candid has its place, but here, with the disturbing things he said, it's as if.. he intends to drive down the price by that interview."

"((( September 20, 2018, a day after he got the $85,643.51 car. ))) That's an $85,000 Model 3 sold in Q3-2018. I'll explain this again. - in Q3-2018 Tesla was selling lots of high end fully loaded Model 3s in the USA.Buyers got the full $7,500 tax credit. With a little help from ZEV credit sales they posted a profit.In Q4 2018 they had to offer lower end versions of the Model 3. The profit deteriorated.In Q1-2019 they ran out of high end buyers in the US and started shipping overseas.Tesla also cut prices across the board US tax credits were reduced by 50%. But they had to cut prices and offer cheaper version in China before they delivered a single unit there. For Q1-2019 they lost $700 million. Partly due to a large number of cars being in transit. But that does not account for the whole loss. Q2-2019 - Tesla cut prices again.They offered a lease for the Model 3. Leases are not sales, they are not usually lucrative. They then sweetened the lease and lower the payment to $399..They enhanced the Model S/X product. They even offered the base Model 3 ($35,000) for a few days. US tax credits are set to be cut again in July - that might help pull some sales forward. Tesla is offering free unlimited charging on a few cars.It's May and Tesla still have 2018 leftovers. Q3-2019 is going to be a bloodbath. The US tax credit will be only worth $1,875 Chinese buyers will have a compelling reason to wait for the much less expensive Domestically built Model 3s. Europe will have had 6 months of Model 3 sales, the motivated buying will have subsided, A trade war could mean more tariffs on American Made cars going to China. Suggestion: Forget the fluff (robo taxis) and watch the actual story unfold. Wait for real numbers like quarterly sales and the financial reports. The rest is entertaining but of little value."

What happens when the market is literally flooded with EV's from all the other car-makers and new EV companies?

In 2021, the breadth of the competitive attack that Tesla faces will be greater than ever.Whether Tesla can defend its lead in China will be key to its wider growth and earnings trajectory. While still in its infancy, China’s electric-car market dwarfs that of other countries and the government is intent on further expansion amid commitments to reduce fossil-fuel use. Tesla’s fate in China will also show whether it can grow into a truly global carmaker, an ambition investors are banking on after pushing the company’s shares up almost 700% this year.Chinese automakers are notorious for building copycat cars that look just like the real thing but deliver underwhelming performance and quality.

"if anyone is confused about the price action the last couple of days... understand this:unless there is a dramatic reason for the stock to swing wildly up or down... the stock is constantly moved up by large funds associated with Elon that want the SP higher. that is the sole reason why it's the #1 shorted stock. it's completely overvalued because it can't sit still when there's no drama. it just moves up in a very predictable way. what do I mean by predictable? I mean, it will either bounce off $288 and drop back down to $286... or it will break through $289 and snap to $293... then trade magically at $296 tomorrow for virtually no reason after bouncing off $298... where then longs will declare $400! once again."

I'm excited about the MS/MX next battery pack. (of course I won't be replacing mine) The M3 pack is 80% of the MS/MX. If the M3 can charge at 120 KW the new packs will be at 150KW. Tesla will have to most likely change to higher voltage charging. The cabling gets hot in the summer and so either larger cables would be needed or higher DC voltages would have to be used.

"Look at frankfurt TL0, amazing."
Tesla not far away from LOSING money in its bitcoin gamble now
EVs are a fad at this stage of the game. The major portion of electric to charge them still comes from fossil fuels. The only way EVs will be sustainable and worth value is if they become 100% solar. Even if that was possible today Big Oil will not permit it to happen. Research the Fish Carburetor.
So if it’s at 850 premarket (& closed $816 thurs night) what do you estimate you can buy it for Friday opening bell?
"Wow shorts in full swing today. It’s an artificial pullback, the media, all the articles, everyone going after Tesla. Enjoy the discount if you have cash ready. I’m buying anything under $800. We have seen this numerous times it always recovers and shoots up higher."

I predict it reaches $2000 per share and stagnates until another stock split.

TESLA is resisting the voluntary recall because it would cost half a billion dollars or more to fix properly. They will end up with a mandatory recall and a probable class action lawsuit. Damages could be in the billions. If nothing else it shows where the company stands when it comes to their costumer safety and that they wont stand behind their product.

Why are people excited about earnings? I think the hype is better than the reality. Earnings will only highlight this. I think better to stay excited about Cyber Truck and Semi. Earnings not a good thing to wait for.
If iPhone buyers wait in lines for hours or days how huge is the demand going to be for a self driving Tesla or how about $25k Tesla?

"Will, for your informative list:1. How can a genius that can make anything he dreams up a reality, couldn't figure out how to get the cars he said he would produce, to his dealer network?? Did the company actually think the cars would distribute themselves? 2. There cannot possibly be 400000 people with deposits when I can either get one today or build one today and have it within 4 weeks (per website, build one and see the answer)3. The leader of Tesla has a serious character flaw. He is acting like a child with no accountability. The SEC settlement was a complete joke. If any other CEO manipulated his company's stock the way Tesla's CEO has, he would have been in jail. And Yes he did a wrongdoing! 4. What happened to leasing? their guaranteed re-purchase?5. Non Tesla dealers cannot get warranty work done or buy parts unless they can prove they are the owners.6. How is their remarketing of trade-ins doing?? Non Tesla product?? Thats cash....Tesla has many followers and loyal customers, but like any relationship, things can start to get un comfortable, and thats what Tesla is about and that's why leadership is leaving in droves."
This is not robinhooders increasing the market cap the value of GM or Ford everyday. This is fed money flowing thru wall street manipulating asset prices.
Going to take the $600 stimulus and buy a PUT on this. No matter how good this company is the stock is WAY OVERVALUED. When it finally collapses it will be EPIC!
Total expected sales for 2020 will be 505959 vehicles. Elon is going to be announcing his intention to step down and will be nominating suitable replacement soon.
"Interesting that upgrades don’t have an immediate impact on a stock, but a downgrade has rapid affect."
"All the shorts and sour grape eaters are whining Tesla stock price being too high. I disagree. At least by one measure it is not expensive: price / sales ratio. Right now Tesla ‘s p/s is at 25, vs snow’s 300, pltr’s 40, plug’ s 34. If Tesla trades at plug’s p/s it should be $1200. So stop whining and buy the stock first thing Monday morning.In fact, given the prospect of blow out 4th qtr earnings report, entire 1st qtr capacity for model y Shanghai being already sold out, and the the potential FSD sales (software sales- the snow category) , Tesla should trades at the 300 p/s which should be around $10,000. But let’s be conservative and call $2000 for Tesla by end of 2021 and do a second split."
IF the overall market is down tomorrow this goes under 800 and likely a healthy 20% correction. uptrend will stay in tac on this thing forever

"""Chinese Tesla rival Nio unveils first production car, grows workforce in San Jose Chinese car company Nio has announced its first production car, the ES8, taking direct aim at Tesla’s luxury all-electric sports utility vehicle, the Model X. Nio's new car was introduced over the weekend by chairman and founder William Li. Nio claims its seven-seater SUV has more features than its Tesla rival — and at a fraction of the cost.At 448,000 Chinese yuan ($67,765), or roughly half the price of the Model X in China, the ES8 is the first all-electric car aiming for the mass market."" Know it, Learn it, Deal with it !Do you really think China would simply let Tesla move in unchallenged? They have the whole Chinese government backing them up. Telso had it's limelight, like Apple those days are over. Shorting TSLA is the way to profit."
"Thank you longs (and shorts) for making Tesla the best investment in 2020, and probably one of the best investments in 2021. The gains have been life changing for me and my family. #willnotsellTesla"
This just paves the way for the real lawsuits
Shortyyyy - come out to play ayyyy
Things get interesting if and when Tesla earns its first profit. Let's assume all the stars align and 2019 they have earnings of $.75. That would give the company a p/e of 469. Let's say things get really crazy and they earn 2 bucks. That's still a p/e of 175 which still seems a little high for car slash battery storage company.
A good entry here if you want to invest in Tesla. I foresee it going to 1000 before they release their earning
when is q4 delivery no coming ?
"In my opinion: I think Ford, Chrysler, ￼￼GM, had many opportunities three decades ago to really build out the electrical vehicle, but the oil industry kept them from design and production. When Elon opened Tesla he was never beholder to the oil industry. And that is why he is the richest man on the planet."

"Questions for longs and shorts? Do you own or have you ever driven in a Tesla? Have you experienced a recent version of FSD in a vehicle with someone that knows how to use it properly? As passionate as a lot of us are about this company, it seems silly if you have not experienced the quality of their current main product. I have owned a Model 3 AWD since June. I purchased FSD about 2 months later. And purchased the acceleration boost a few days ago. I am long. BTW, I tested the new 0-60 and 1/4 mile yesterday with a VBOX (after the upgrade) and it did 0-60 @ 3.567 and best 1/4 was 11.89 at 117 MPH. A $2000 software upgrade I am very happy with. I estimate this paid upgrade could add about $85M to Q4 revenue."

"If Tesla won't claim 50% of the EV market (there's at least twenty other EV manufacturers today) the stock will collapse, because it's valued and expected to be a world dominator. The risk is extremely high here due to the expectations.Selling cars is a business with small overall revenues due to the hard competition. I would never put money in the long side on these levels."
omg $TSLA is my favorite growth stock!
"9,766 divided by 13 is 752 and not 2500."
Tesla advertises the Model 3 starting at $35000. Try to get the $35000 model. What you can get ends up at $50000 plus.This is classic bait and switch. Tesla gets a pass because they are green. Non green companies doing this get fined billions of dollars. https://www.tesla.com/model3
"Not only can the market makers take your TSLA shares by dropping the price and have you sell at a lower price with a loss; they can also entice you to sell at higher trading prices with a gain. But, after you have sold those shares they continue to bring the price up and you have to buy back less shares and at a higher price."

"This stock doesn't depend on math or how many cars, or anything else Tesla delivers, it depends on Belief. The stock will only crash, when people stop beleaving, it can go down very fast, as most people don't understand how it works, they are unsure, single thing can pop everything up, one by one. If a big piece would go down, people would go in anxiety mode, everything would depend on how much You still believe. If You don't, You would die the momment this would go down a large piece. The momment when most people will stop believing in this, this stock will crash, but if people still believe in the ""Safe, high tech, zero emission future"" It won't crash. You have to understand that years and years younger generations been exposed to climate change, food additives, air pollution, and everything else to the point where everyone worries so much about their health, that believing in a Company like Tesla, all the news that Elon say's, how he say's takes away people minds out of years and years anxiety, Corona virus is a good thing for a company likes this too. People live in their own heads most of the time, worrying about everything, this company is like miracle for them. It's a problem soliution that they had for a long time, it's a wishfull thinking. Until Musk will say everything will be allright, people will believe that, because they had to. You want to believe that too. Another thing is Youtube, more and more people are sharing Musk and his companies news, so more people are getting into this everyday, it will grow little by little. As more people are getting exposed to what Musk and Tesla is. Memes are combined to reach out young audiences, as they are more likely to join Tesla becouse of the worries and fears they already have as I wrote prior to this. World is in ""Danger"" and Musk looks like the one who could ""Save"" everyone, even if he can't it doesn't matter, kids will be already exposed to this using memes. Musk is not stupid, everything he does is pure live advertising. The momment when he smoked weed, it's all about getting more and more people into this. Smoking weed looks a cool thing to younger audiences, as well as other pot smokers, they natturaly want to be a fallower as he looks like one of them. Everything about this company is more about human psychology, and emotions, not about numbers and revenue. Numbers do affect everything, but as long as this company just down fall by messing up something very bad, it will only go up. If you don't believe me, look up to a Elon Musk hall of fame video, watch it till the end, the way he ""Cares"" and almost cries, the way he messed up at the beggining of the journey with rockets, 3 fails, he spent his own money, and so on. Watch yourself, how do you feel after watching video like this? And imagine how a kid feels when he sees something like this. It's a dream, emotions that flow, he looks like real hero. Even if he is not, that I don't know, I can only assume he is a good gay. Anyway, I hope it may help someone to just to think how belief works, and what can it do. Other companies never worked on a ""Vision"" and belief before as good as Elon does, that's why this company is worth more then it should be."

I just want to share with you a summary of their metrics from Tipranks, and you be the judge for yourself on their performance.Adam Jonas - 4.25/5 stars, Ranked #942 out of 7,185 Analysts, average return per rating: 10+%Ryan Brinkman - 0.10/5 stars, Ranked #6,778 out of 7,185 Analysts, average return per rating: -0.51%Stuart Pearson - 1.00/5 stars, Ranked #6,091 out of 7,185 Analysts, average return per rating: -0.66%Gordon Johnson - 0.00/5 stars, Ranked #6,986 out of 7,185 Analysts, average return per rating: -9.6%I deliberately put them in descending order of their return per rating, because that is more data driven, and objective. Now who is the top performer of the 4 analysts who covers TSLA?"
"Does anyone recall the first SEC offer made to Elon that he rejected? Seems like a century ago. Then when the 2nd offer was extended, he had to sit another year in the Chairman penalty box, AND Tesla was fined $20MMusk tried to say he would pay $40M instead, the SEC said Nope.. $20M Tesla; $20M MuskMusk wasn’t happy about that. I’m not sure why, but my hunch that Tesla ( the corporation) pays a fine is a tactical SEC decision that will bear fruit down the line. Could it be related to other things they are investigating inside Tesla?Maybe the 1st penalty is just needed to open the door wider for other sanctions? I do not know, but I recall that Musk was very upset that Tesla had to pay a fine. There is more to this story than just who pays the $20M., that much I am convinced of ."
It is apparent that Tesla has failed to raise significant cash from Semi and Roadster reservation. Countdown to bankcruptcy has started.
Overvalued by any measure. Tesla has been overvalued for years...
"But... But.. I thought today will close over 1000 that the reason I bought few shares last Friday over 800/s. Aren't we closing at 1200 today, riiiiiight??!!"
There is not end of flimsy and illusionary news in TSLA world. Everybody is so fascinated to listen these and forgetting the real things to happen. Stock price level is at astronomical high level and at this point no analyst's can justify its price valuation. Most new entrant will regret in coming sessions very soon.
"TSLA up but charging station stocks down, go figure that one"
I live in Belgium . BMW and Audi are coming strong into the EV market in Europe .Lots of commercials in the streets and tv adds . Huge competition in 2021 for Tesla. Believe me !!
It's interesting to watch a financial bubble pop in real time.
"Tesla was ordered by the Chinese government to shut down its Shanghai factory over concerns about the coronavirus, a closure that will delay Model 3 production and ultimately put slight downward pressure on profits in the first quarter, the automaker's finance chief Zach Kirkhorn said during an earnings call Wednesday.Prior to the call, Tesla reported Wednesday $105 million in net income, or 56 cents a diluted share, compared with $140 million, or 78 cents a share, in the same year-ago period. Tesla earned $386 million, or $2.14 a share, in the fourth quarter when adjusted for one-time items. Tesla generated revenue of $7.38 billion in fourth quarter, just 1% higher than the $7.2 billion generated in the same period in 2018.Model 3 production will be delayed by a week and a half, Kirkhorn said. Novel coronavirus, a new form of the family of viruses known as coronavirus first cropped up in Wuhan in late December 2019. Since then, thousands of people have contracted the virus, causing the government to take measures such as shutting down transit and factories throughout the country, including Foxconn. Automakers Ford and Toyota have said they will idle some of their Chinese assembly plants for an extra week, the NYT reported.""We are in the early stages of understanding if, and to what extent, we may be temporarily impacted by the coronavirus,"" Kirkhorn said. ""At this point we're expecting a one, to one and a half week-delay in the ramp of the Shanghai build Model 3 due to a government required factory shutdown. This may slightly impact profitability for the quarter, but is limited as the profit contribution from Model 3 Shanghai remains in the early stages.""Tesla is also closely monitoring if the coronavirus will cause interruptions in the supply chain for cars built in Fremont. ""So far we're not aware of anything material, but it's important to caveat, this is an unfolding story,"" Kirkhorn added.The first deliveries of Tesla Model 3 sedans produced at the Shanghai plant began in early January, one year after the U.S. automaker began construction on its first factory outside the United States.The deliveries to customers was a milestone for Tesla and a critical step for the company in its aim to carve out market share in the world’s biggest auto market, as well as lessen the financial pain caused by tariffs."
"Tesla TSLA Reports Q4 2020 Earnings Results $0.80 EPSTesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), the California EV maker reported Adj EPS (non-GAAP) of US $0.80 per share, and record revenue of US $10.744 billion for Q4 2020, exceeding Wall Street's average estimate. After Tesla trading officially closed on January 27, 2021, the company released its Shareholder Letter before its Q4 2020 Earnings Call, which will be hosted today at 3:30 p.m. Pacific Time / 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time.HIGHLIGHTSCashOperating cash flow less capex (free cash flow) of $2.8B in 2020$4.9B increase in our cash and cash equivalents in Q4 to $19.4BFree cash flow $1.9B in Q4Profitability$721M GAAP net income; $2.5B non-GAAP net income in 2020$270M GAAP net income; $903M non-GAAP net income (ex-SBC*) in Q4$575M GAAP operating income; 5.4% operating margin in Q4SBC expense increased to $633M in Q4OperationsHalf a million vehicles produced and delivered in 2020Model Y production at Gigafactory Shanghai started in December 2020Updated Model S and Model X launched in January 2021FINANCIAL SUMMARYRevenueTotal revenue grew 46% YoY in Q4. This was primarily achieved through substantial growth in vehicle deliveries as well as growth in other parts of the business. At the same time, vehicle average selling price (ASP) declined by 11% YoY as our product mix continued to shift from Model S and Model X to the more affordable Model 3 and Model Y.ProfitabilityOur operating income improved in Q4 compared to the same period last year to $575M, resulting in a 5.4% operating margin. This profit level was reached while incurring SBC expense attributable to the 2018 CEO award of $267M in Q4, driven by an increase in our market capitalization and a new operational milestone becoming probable.Positive impact from volume growth and regulatory credit revenue growth YoY was mainly offset by lower ASP (including price reduction of China-made Model 3 and price reductions of Model S and Model X before the introduction of updated models) but also by a series of notable items. These included a portion of Q@4 SBC charges, vehicle warranty accruals, additional supply chain costs, Model S and Model X changeover costs and other items.CashQuarter-end cash and cash equivalents increased to $19.4B in Q4, driven mainly by our recent capital raise of $5.0B (average price of this offering was -$632/share) and free cash flow of $1.9B, partially offset by early debt repayments (early conversion of convertible notes)."
Tesla has only just begun. it has years of growth ahead unlike most stocks which are maxed out.

"where are all the index fund, who has to buy it? He? He? No one will rescue you longs"
It’s not a bubble it’s people’s belief in the company. Nobody who buys this stock gives a damn about investor fundamentals. They want to own a piece of this company and that’s it! Also it provides great returns. If you like the company and it’s smart then invest in it. Tesla is a proven company. Who gives a damm about the numbers. Tesla is a world changer in every way.
Shorts and Longs should continue betting whether TSLA goes private or not in VEGAS!!! Thumbs up if you bet TSLA will go private
"Just for Roland ====> Tesla now gives the premium package away for free on the mid range Model 3's You previously claimed that the new mid range cars did not require paying for the ""premium"" package. I just looked at their site and they now include the Premium Interior package (glass roof) in the base price. There is no other premium package offered. I have provided a link - but not sure it will work. So, it seems, your logic and math (below) no longer apply. $49K = $35K + $9K (long range) + $5K (premium interior)$45K = $35K + $10K (mid range)https://3.tesla.com/model3/design?#interior"

"Elon Musk cracks me up. Tesla is out of cash, but Musk won't stop tweeting about expensive things he supposedly is doing at Tesla. He has now promised, simultaneously, ALL of the following things that Tesla DOES NOT have the cash or borrowing capacity to fund: A multi-billion dollar China Factory, to be producing cars within the next 9 months. A pickup truckAn SUVA semi-truckThousands of new superchargersThe purchase of a trucking company (he lied and claimed he already did this one, lol)Hundreds of new service centers, so no-one is more than an hour from oneBuying and operating Tesla's own body shopsReducing the turnaround on new paint jobs and collision repairs from ""many months"" to ""one hour""Tesla does not have the cash or borrowing capacity to afford to do a single one of these things. And yet Elon has promised to do them ALL. Why? Because he is a liar and a fraud."
Many people thought this will go back to 500 after inclusion. They might wait forever lol. The train is leaving the station once again.
"GDP collapsing, debt spiraling, interest at zero, the virus still making amok. The USA, the land of the permanent debt slaves, kept hooked on the federal reserves printing notes out of thin air. The US dollar’s status as the dominant global currency is at risk of being eroded because of mounting government debt. With the US Federal Reserve continuing its aggressive monetary policy of quantitative easing, there is a rising risk of a sudden loss of confidence in the dollar."
"Model Y launch in China, no one will buy NIO, even Chinese don’t trust Chinese products, Tesla sales will further boom "

Is there a possibility that a firm lost so much money from shorting “meme stocks” that they had to give up their positions in TSLA? I mean there’s been billions of dollars gone just within the last week.

"Tesla also performed a groundbreaking move by purchasing $1.5 billion of Bitcoin in January 2021, a move that was detailed in the company’s most recent 10-K filing. Bitcoin could be the company’s way of simplifying the purchase options in international markets, especially as it aggressively expands to markets outside of North America."

$2450 before the split. My theoretical AAPL comparison after announcing the split.
"Tesla should establish an automatic, direct stock purchase plan. Under such plans an existing shareholder can automatically purchase shares of stock directly from the company on a monthly or quarterly basis. A fixed sum of money is periodically paid to the company and whatever number of full and fractional shares can be purchased for that amount is credited to the shareholder's account in book entry form. The share price is determined as an average of the closing prices for a specified number of trading days prior to the periodic purchase. A discount of 5% to the average market price is common. Dollar cost averaging results from the automatic and periodic purchases. A direct purchase plan is similar to a DRIP except the shareholder must make arrangements to automatically transfer money to the direct purchase plan.Setting up a direct purchase plan would establish a steady source of new capital flowing in from those who are most supportive of the company's goals - its current owners (shareholders). Shareholders are rewarded for participation by purchasing at a discount to the recent market price."

You know that sound when the air is being let out of a balloon....?
S&P will be down over 100 points by the end of the day. Where do you think this hyped ponzi will be?
"Stock was below 260 ten days ago BEFORE Tesla revealed the collapse in sales, IT should be crashing down FROM 260 to 200 today. But Elon manipulated the stock UP above 290 so it could “crash” back to unchanged at 260. Funny!"
"Below $300! $25,000 car in three years, but TSLA will not be around in three years. No demand for Model 3 after reservatiuon list. They should drop the price by $10,000 and that is their $25,000 car, because that is what it is worth."
looks like recovery day tomorrow for stock market
A Heavy Correction of 75-80% is imminent!KEEP GAMBLING!
Only down $50 in pre-market. Should be many hundreds. The trend is your not friend with this firm declining Average Selling Prices are here to stay!
"AARP seems to be cautioning its members about putting a deposit down on a Model 3: ""Each preorder of a car requires the $1,000 deposit, and some who put money down....have been waiting months for refunds."""
"TSLA is not a car company. Cars just happen to be one of their products. They are a technology company, a battery company, and a leader in EV car technology. Even GM can compare given they have had EVs for 10 years now. When companies like TSLA are looked at in the stock market traditional measures are difficult. It is, for sure, higher risk than say Ford and TSLA's dynamics defy gravity. If you can't roll with that then you should not own TSLA."
"does nobody see what's going on with the economy? how can you not be in cash, gold, silver or SHORT right now?"
"My friend is a manager at a Jaguar dealer. Jag supplied Ipaced and Teslas at a test track for him and others to drive all day. At the end of going over bumps and rough track all day the Ipace was still rattle free but he said the Tesla was horrible with everything loose. Audi, Jag, etc are producing high quality luxury electric cars, not cheap kit rattle prone cars by Tesla. As more main stream electric cars appear, how will they affect Tesla sales?"
the Long Squeeze...
The only way you keep growing profitability in a competitive landscape is having a superior product like Apple or service like Amazon..TSLA has neither and is already getting into price wars....
"Blackstone prediction for 2021 is Tesla will acquire a major car manufacturer! This isa rubbish prediction"" . Tesla is in the business of building modern EV factory and not to acquire a a legacy ICE factory. Acquiring a losing business is a recipe for failure"
"Disclosure - I am a Tesla owner who purchased 2 model S vehicles (in 2013 and in 2015). I love the cars although they are expensive. I am also a big believer in anthopogenic global warming. BUT I am short this stock and negative on Elon Musk's tweets etc. that promote the stock and mislead/deflect investors. The latest nonsense from some of the analysts who are trying to put lipstick on the horrible delivery numbers include: 1) because Tesla sold fewer low margin Model 3's their gross margins will be better and earnings loss less (nonsense- by that analysis Tesla should never sell any Model 3's and their gross margins will be even better); 2) A slower but consistent ramp up is better (meanwhile Tesla's cash burn continues as other competitors take market share); 3) the slower Model 3 vehicle sales mean another quarter before the 200,000 US vehicle delivery is reached so there will be more tax credits to entice buyers (nonsense, they already supposedly have 400,000 orders which they cannot fill). Analysts will say anything to prop up this stock. Musk should have had a secondary offering of 20 million or so shares when the stock was 330+ to raise the $6 billion of cash needed to cover cash flow shortages over the next year. Some dilution is better than a cash crisis which appears imminent in 3 months or so."
"Huawei, Apple and Baidu are all rumored to or have plans to enter the EV space.Nio, XPeng and Li Auto are already developing competitive models and growing gangbusters.Lucid is going to enter the high end market and Fisker is partnering with FoxConn to produce a competitively priced SUV this year and a self proclaimed revolutionary automobile soon.The space is heating up with the world’s largest electronics heavyweights entering as soon as this year.Tesla has a target  on its back.Amplified risk wit $1.5 bil bitcoin Seeing severe copper, nickel, cobalt inflation.This is going to be a crowded space soon where the ones with the most money to burn and crowd pleasing innovation will capture market share.Not sure Tesla, with its tiny margins and later than prognosticated FSD arrival will win out."
"Cathie really thinks that one day down the line Tesla Flips Uber and has an autonomous taxi business all over the world. Just think about that for a second. Maybe it sounds good in theory .. gonna need another 5-10 years for that to play out. In the meantime, there is zero infrastructure in the rollout of that plan. Does Elon even talk about that?"
I say that if SEC doesnt do the right thing against Musk we sue the SEC!
"At what point does Elon announce a new, largest ever, share offering? I'm thinking Elon wants to convert bubble money (e.g. the stock price) into real money. I'm thinking he wants to raise at least $100 billion in cash. It is very, very accretive to the company, if he does so. The only issue is that he doesn't want to crash the stock. He has to nurture the bubble. I'm guessing he will make some kind of an announcement regarding new secondary offerings at the earnings report."
At $100 this is still 90 bil market cap and it is ford and gm together
"Elon Musk is standing on the shoulders of giants the likes of DaVinci, Newton, Edison, Tesla, Einstein and van Braun. More than any multi-billionaire business mogul, charismatic political or reverent religious leader Elon Musk is advancing far into the future sustainability of Mother Earth and furthering humankind throughout the universe. Not a utopian disciple but a disruptive, effective and encouraging force. Any other motive prescribed to him is fallacious."
Cathie Wood doubling down won’t matter look what happened to Workhorse they doubled down on that too and that tanked. Classic bubble trading double down to try and prop up the price. Works until it doesn’t
Rumor of a another financial system collapse as per the CEO of IG brokerage just on newsmax a few minutes ago.
Do the Shorts and WS thugs/analysts have a clear understanding of not just $TSLA but any disruptive technology or platform? I guess not. They seem patient at the beginning and they turn and become very impatient just around the time when company is in at inflection point of loss/profitability and only to be believers once solid profits start rolling in. Such is the case with TSLA and WS analysts. Regardless of what happens today we still have a year or so before the profitability is consistent and guidance is more accurate.
"Musk tells the the world, without any warning, that Tesla was within weeks of bankruptcy. Can you imagine being the Accounts Payable Manger at Tesla, and being told by your boss (Musk) to negotiate extended terms to suppliers? ""Everything's great, no problems whatsoever, of course you'll get paid"". Musk must always portray himself, and Tesla, as the underdog, beating the odds, (it's the Drama Queen within him) even though it is Musk himself, that is increasing those odds, against success. Not fit to be night manager of a Loco Pollo, let alone a CEO of a $50B (and dropping) publicly traded company."
$380 is coming
The sales forecast is a joke... nothing is said about the company's cash flow.
the damage from the recall is capped at $400 million. we all know that is a drop in the bucket with TSLA's strong cash position. in my opinion it's not a big issue. Investors are smart they know this. looking forward to a potential smashing record in earning.
Shorts right now seeing their account negative.
"Something is in the wind , Talked about on Bloomberg news Rumor $AAPL + $FSR in some form. Like over $TSLA"
"Feb 2018 === Elon said “[We] expect the new automated lines to arrive next month in March."" And the followers cheered and clapped and declared victory and insulted anyone who questioned the official party line."
Funny how only $TSLA or the stock market is claimed to be in a bubble. What about the real estate market? Everyone is working from home or out of a job so who exactly is buying new homes or office buildings?
"The favorite narrative is that Musk is environment-friendly, and that EVs are ""zero-emission"", however, there's a largely untold (or dismissed) story about how unfriendly the mining of battery ingredients are for the environment as well as Tesla's choice of battery ingredients. With every decision there's a plus and a minus. And conveniently leaving these CO2 emissions out of the calculations are necessary to promote this false zero-emissions story. Moreover, The CO2 emissions from mining for these ingredients is a CO2 incursion not applicable to ICE vehicles. It's been told that the total construction of EVs (mining for battery ingredients included) coming off the assembly line (before having driven a mile) have emitted more CO2 emissions than a comparable ICE vehicle coming off the assembly line, and that it takes a number of years of comparable driving before the total CO2 emissions of an EV vehicle finally falls below that of an ICE vehicle (yes, of course, the burning of gas is highly CO2 emissive too). I'm sure there's other sources of CO2 emissions in the construction of an EV, but here's a few to consider: - High CO2 emissions from mining for Lithium - High CO2 emissions from mining for the extra 350% copper required for building an EV - High CO2 emissions from mining for other battery ingredients - the choice of Aluminum in batteries vs Manganese results in a higher risk of battery catching on fire, which is also highly CO2 emissive. Tesla cars catching on fire remains one of the most common complaints (including by Chinese consumers as recently as January 2021) - Choosing to leave Cobalt out of the battery, although it preserves a rare mineral and saves money, it also increases the chance of a battery fire, which, again, is a highly CO2 emissive event - Choosing to include Aluminum in Tesla batteries, though it results in higher range and increased risk of fires, it also results in a lower car lifespan, meaning Tesla owners will be either buying cars more frequently, or replacing the battery. Its been reported that 8 years is a rarely achieved lifespan for Tesla EV batteries, and replacing one not only costs @ $16,000 but it incurs another set of high CO2 emissions from building yet another battery. I, as many of us have, owned and drove one ICE for 25 years. Hypothetically, if I had instead owned a Tesla during that stretch, the associated CO2 emissions incurred would be for three Tesla batteries, not one."
Yesterday they make multiple bad news in $shop as good news and today multiple $tsla news as good news. Look like some powerful Force overwelm any sell off activity. Good side on Shop was it close at low which means limit is closer then look. Let’s see where TSLA end trade. My bet 785 area but I think Tesla also have lot of believer
"At the entrance to the company’s Dublin, Calif., center recently, an agitated Model X owner was trying to drop his SUV off for repair. A Tesla service agent said he couldn’t leave the car there because the facility was too busy. He could make an appointment to bring it in another time, maybe in a couple of weeks.“But I don’t want to drive it!” said Kaushal Bhaskar, a software engineer from nearby San Ramon who complained he sometimes couldn’t get the passenger door to open, while other times the door would open up all by itself – including once on the Interstate at highway speeds. “This is a safety concern for me!”A safety concern? You don't say."
"I live on the east coast, everywhere you turn there's a Telsa. Real 100% EV's on the road, not a form to fill out for updates on its availability but here now and on the road in some of the most densely populated states in the country. Think about that for a moment!"

STAY LONG. HUGE 2021 AHEAD WITH OUT PANDEMIC. NEW CYBER TRUCK COMING. FULL SELF DRIVE ALSO FULL SELF DRIVE WILL BE TESLA BIGGEST REVENUE DRIVER. IT IS STRAIGHT PROFIT. NOT TO MENTION BORING CO TUNNELS THAT ARE ALREADY BEING BUILT. ONCE BUILT THEY WILL UTILIZE FULL SELF DRIVE AND WILL ALSO ALOW ELON TO ACTIVATE TESLA INSURANCE. ANOTHER HIGH MARGIN VENTURE. TESLA IS FUTURE AND GOING WAY HIGHER 1000 SHORTLY. CANT STOP THE COOL FACTOR.
First time owning tesla 20 shares @$634. Thank you for the cheap shares!
"wow, glad i didnt buy, was going to buy 10K just 2 minutes before the market closed."
"Simple reality === Tesla is getting beat at its own game. VWs ID.3 = 7,144 units sold Renault Zoe = 5,349 units sold Tesla M3 = 3,293 units sold VW is a massive OEM that sells millions of cars every year. Their unbridled success in EVs is just a little icing on the cake."
VW plans on releasing over 70 models of EVs by 2028. Meanwhile Tesla is trying to improve a few models to be the best they can. Even if you deny the logic there it still shuts down the idea EVs aren't the future.
"Didn't realize Tesla's price cuts in Europe we so severe: In Germany, the Model 3 price fell 4,000 euros, and in France the price dropped by as much as 6,000 euros."
"Tesla likely hit a peak Friday, or it could keep rising for huge gains for a few more days, with even bigger daily point gains. Selling at the very peak of a climax top is essentially the great fishing story for investors. Many will claim it, few will achieve it.Investors may want to sell some Tesla stock into strength, because when a climax top occurs, shares can fall to earth even faster than they rise.After a climax run, stocks often suffer huge declines that take years to recover from. Qualcomm (QCOM) finally surpassed its 2000 climax top peak last year.Tesla stock had a climax-type run in late 2019 to early 2020, peaking on Feb. 4 at a split-adjusted 193.80. Shares then plunged 64% to 70.10 on March 18, with the coronavirus market crash no doubt contributing to the losses.Perhaps Tesla stock will have a climax top, sell off and rebound rather quickly once again. But do you want to sit through a 30%, 50%, 80% decline on hopes for a rebound? If Tesla stock corrects or crashes and then bounces back, investors can always buy it back. After the coronavirus crash, Tesla stock offered buying opportunities slightly below and above the February peak."
Once this baby break 800 which it will happen soon it will run like a train to 1000 fueled by mega profits of quarter 4 on Jan 21. Hint : when stock hit 1000 that will be just 50% increase since the start of this year and all of us are predicting 600% increase this year alone which it will translate to 4200 after split but split will happen this year when we hit 2000 by august this year( 5-1) which translate to More shares and more profits. Finally: Tesla will hit 1 trillion money cap at 3500 tag price after split and ofcourse Elon will be the richest man in the world without any near competition

"Here comes VW.....Volkswagen is ramping up its e-mobility strategy to plan 16 production sites around the world for electric vehicles by the end of 2022. It also says that future partnerships with battery manufacturers have been agreed for Europe and China.....VW Group currently produces electric vehicles at three locations, and in two years' time a further nine group plants are scheduled to be equipped for this purpose. To ensure adequate battery capacity for the massive expansion of environmentally-friendly electric mobility, partnerships with battery manufacturers for Europe and China have already been agreed with contracts totalling around EUR20bn. VW also said a 'supplier decision for North America will be taken shortly'......When ""Roadmap E"" was launched last year, Volkswagen announced plans to build up to three million electric vehicles annually by 2025 and market 80 new electric group models. This year, another nine new vehicles, three of which will be purely electric-powered, will be added to the group's electric portfolio of eight e-cars and plug-in hybrids.Questinatorhttps://www.just-auto.com/news/vw-plans-16-ev-production-sites-by-2022_id181685.aspx?utm_source=daily-html&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=13-03-2018&utm_term=101412&utm_content=545910"

Thinking of buying a diesel truck. Long lasting and well built.
"I am selling my the rest of my Tesla shares today, I am buying GM shares with proceeds. Good luck to all Tesla longs... Enjoyed this amazing ride !!!!"
what just happened
Ford ups investment in electric and autonomous vehicles to $29 billion through 2025. How's that compare to Tesla's R&D budget? I believe it dwarfs it by 20x.
800 again by the end of the month
"I bought in when the 5-1 split was announced, the stock price was $1,500 per share. Divide that 5 and I got in at $300 per share. Definitely a solid investment. I did the same last week with Amazon, still waiting on that split announcement."
"I clearly remember October 17, 1987. I was driving across town to the factory from the engineering center. It was about 1 hour after the market opened and the market was already falling. Then it recovered for about 1/2 hour, then resumed falling more. That happened 2 or 3 times during the day and ended the day at the low, down almost 23%. I don't remember any major stock avoiding the fall that day. I was actually not surprised, because on the Oct 16, a program called Wall Street Week featured, among other guests, Marty Zwieg. He was a highly respected market analyst. Louis Rukeyser asked him about the market. That day, Friday Oct 16, the Dow had fallen about 100 points, almost 5%. HE said something slightly out of character ""I am worried........"". He was usually very careful not to be so direct. Rukeyser did not press him to elaborate. I think Louis knew full well Marty might be right on and a much lower market was very close. Little did they know the extent and sharpness of the fall the following Monday. I have never lost the impact of that market psychology leading up to that Monday. I now have a very similar sense for Monday, Oct 29, 2018. If not that day, then sometime during next week. That fall could be sudden and short lived like 1987 or it would be like Oct, 2008 when the steepest part of the fall lasted much of October. I seem to remember 2 or three days that month, the Dow fell about 1000 points during a day. I think the crash we will see next week will be more similar to 2008."
"Long TSLA. I would never have thought it was possible, but Tesla market cap is actually approaching $1 Trillion."
When TSLA debuted on july 2010 if you were lucky enough you could buy a share for $3.84 (split adjusted) that was on 6/27/2010. One month later you could by one Bitcoin for $0.08. Supposed you bought for $1000 on each asset. Today TSLA would worth $172'135 while BTC would worth $332'925'000. That means 1'934 times TSLA investment.
"Q4 earnings will be a blowout. Stock above $1000 for sure. Record amount of cars were sold. I expect at least $3.50 in earnings per share, which would take the PE ratio to 59"
Most shorts won't survive today.
"$750 today , stay strong"
"walle, beyond pollution, leroy....etc etc etc"
"Most manipulated stock, EVER"
You better not have bought on margin. The boogie man is coming to get you.
ExxonMobil is my #1 pick and #2 is AT&T. Both are stocks I recommend.
"We now have a Meme driven stock market. PE and earnings are for grandpa, now it's all about who's CEO is the coolest on Twitter."

Gap down and trading halt?
 JUST BOUGHT MORE. After re-reading the list of partners and $TSLA news lately = VERY STRONG BUY.
800 today?
"$TSLA negative datapoint from Deutsche Bank: ""In our conversation with the company, it acknowledged its remaining pipeline of Model 3 orders is now mostly from customer overseas, or from US customers waiting for a leasing option or cheaper variants of the vehicle.""11:55 AM - 18 Jan 2019"
Market cap is still 3x of toyota while toyota sold ...3t revenue and tesla sold 30b. Tesla must sell 100x more what they do and cut cap into half. Basically they need to sell 100x more and stock need to be $300 a share
"150,000 California households were without power Tuesday from a combination of downed trees and power lines, and utilities proactively shutting off power to prevent fires. 100 mph Sana Ana winds... Your ICE powered SUV in the driveway is asking ""Are you loving me now?"""
"The most amazing thing to me is that there are buyers at all. Must be quick trades, in and out."
TSLA is where Amazon is 10 years ago. The valuations make sense to me now once you understand that model. People keep saying PE and all that. It doenst matter. Look at all tech companies. They are all price to sales of above 50X. TSLA price to sales should be at least 30X MIN as its a softweare as a service company. NOT A CAR COMPANY.
"luther, you seem to forget that Larry Ellison has enough free cash to prop the stock up for quite some time and what do you think Elon is doing with that 2 billion dollars that he got for diluting the shareholder's equity yet again?"

In my neighborhood there are a lot of Teslas parked! We also have a battery staging sight too with many Tesla’s hooked up to it....Long and strong TSLA!

Trying to play the rise of Bitcoin in the coming years through TSLA is not advisable. Play the rise of Bitcoin through $GBTC . Good liquidity. Low cost. Buy. Hold. Chill.
Elon Musk just offered to trade all of his Tesla shares for all of the Bitcoin in the world
Goldman “reiterates bearish stance”. Don’t fight the Goldilocks.
GM can't compete with Tesla. They are just trying to survive. Tesla is over 10 years ahead of everyone. Tesla in the EV market is like Apple in the smartphone market.
"Soon, Tesla will have to announce negative delivery numbers (more people shipping cars back to them) lol"
"think it will just trade sideways for the next 10 days or so, up a little, down a littlethen...as always, Motley Fool and the other's will print their web articles as they always do, about options indicating the market is expecting a big move in one direction or the otherand then Q4 results will come out, beating the Street expectations by hefty margins, at about the same time Stimulus #1 for 2021 rolls out to the peopleand the market will move Tesla in the direction it always does, which will be another breakout to the upsidehistory is your guide and the trend is your friend!"

Fast climbing before ER usually is not a good sign though... i am not holding any shares but sharing my experience. good luck guys.
"ready to make mo money! Countdown!With tesla of course the king, $nio (a little step child from asia), $QS ( an recent infant), Apple ( rich uncle Joe)and pltr ( policeman)"
"July 1 to July 24, Tesla delivered 5748 M3s. Think about that longs. Nearly 20K built m3s have not been delivered. Tesla is now advertising (never before done that) Tesla is hiring for a call center to get sales. Tesla has cars in lots that are not moving out. Tesla Motor Club has people posting saying they are getting deliveries as fast as 10 days from ordering. THERE IS NO DEMAND FOR THE M3 that tesla will build. It does not take a rocket scientist to figure that out. TSLA could likely crater before ER. Will certainly crater afterwards."
"I dont need to look for any links regarding 2019 delivery numbers. When I see the $TSLA stock price shoot up to $480 pre-market this morning, I will know, and so will you"

It has been oversold but from here it is going to move forward in upward direction until it will reach to $1000 plus .
"Is $TSLA buying $OZSC, or is it a rumor?Great company for charging stations and can help with SPACEX program too."

this is just a setup for shorts to get all excitable and get head faked hard.........ouch.........the life of a short must be very stressful
"I suspect many of the $1,000 reservations will find it very difficult to recover the refund. As time passes TSLA is becoming less and less solvent."
Orderly fashion please 1 at a time guys the titanic is going down. Institutions get first life boats.
"This sentence speaks volumes: In a memo to suppliers in July, the company asked some suppliers to refund some payments to help it turn a profit."
My simple advise don't short this stock even if its overvalued. Simple reason : Lot of people short tesla and some good news come out so they have to cover and stock goes up ...
"Feds. please pass all stimulus, sign it and stamp approved !!! Open another building and buy more printing machines !! HURRY IT UP !! it will create jobs too !! hahaha"
"With the semi truck announcement coming soon, has there been any information on where it will be built and how much it will cost. This smacks of typical MUsk misdirection. Whether it is debt or equity, I see another financing request coming soon. Whether it is debt or equity though, it might not get the reception that Musk has received in the past. Equity investors are tired of being diluted and want to see real progress on the Model 3 ramp up , and the bond markets already reflect what the reality that Musk can expect."

90% of the posters here suffer from Schadenfreude. That is not good. Some come here specifically to bully others. You could be short. That doesnt mean you are bad or you need to lose money. Or you could be long and it doesnt mean you are bad and need to be rediculed. In this market and for this stock trend is the key. You could be long 10 seconds back and change to shorts 10 senconds later. Please fix your Schadenfreude.

"Any word on the Model 3 ramp up? It seems like any production that is occurring is being done manually. If that is the case, why bother? The Model 3 is supposed to be a high volume low cost car. I am not a production line expert, but f there are ""bottlenecks"" due to automation or supply, wouldn't there be a lot of WIP cars? Is that the case? ."
"Tesla earned $331M in net profits in the 3rd quarter of 2020. Of that amount $397M came from ZEV credits that Tesla sold to other auto manufacturers. Meaning Tesla's auto and other businesses lost $66M last quarter. So, without ZEV credits, Tesla was not yet profitable as of last quarter. Does anyone know when these credits will end as other manufacturers need them less and less when they make their own electric vehicles?"
This sure looks like a good exit point.....
get ready for more analysts to put a straight sell on these shares too
This is a systematic sell off. Funds can dump daily as it drops 5-10 points per day.
Ky jelly is in every shorts glove box and medicine cabinet
"Not only am I predicting that this stock will get crushed soon, but also the whole market (especially Nasdaq). Powell stated that they will hold rates near zero “unless inflation rises”. It’s very clear the market has been getting pumped (especially Tesla) due to stimulus (inflation worries)- assets (stocks) go up due to the dollar being worth less and not due to fundamentals- p/es are at historic highs for multiple stocks (do the fact check yourself, simple google check of historic p/es- this includes forward p/es). Now we’re between a rock and hard place. If the Dems get another stimulus approved, that means a rise to inflation. If inflation rises, that means feds increase interest rates. The last time they increased rate, the nasdaq dropped ~20% in 2018. If the Dem stimulus doesn’t pass, there is no more reason for worry of inflation and people move to cash, especially due to overvaluation. RIP to FOMOs"
"Logically, it should retrace to 694.7833 off the 811.61 top. Not suggesting you sell, this is the 61.8% retrace level traders like to use."
Tesla is a great company. But price movement based on 10 year outlook is insane.Any bad news will crash the market value by 40%. be aware and act.
Tesla made $721 million profit in 2020. Tesla made $725 million profit with Bitcoin so far in 2021.Proof that investing in tesla is really investing in Elon Musk.
Nice shake-up for next level !
14 days to earnings call for Tesla
"Tesla is the leader in battery technology. Battery costs coming down, longer range, $25,000 car all means more revenue, dominating the market means more profit."
Buying $TSLA shares at P/E=1500 is a new hobby...P/E=1500 means that it takes 1500 years to get back the capital you have invested. There have never been such high valuation multiples as Tesla's in history.
PUMP PUMP PUMP
Still up triple digits on my Tesla stock. What’s in your wallet ?
you should not buy a stock if is valued at 1500 E/P it is pure common sense.
Super low volume...preparation for launch 
"Step outside. Look around your neighborhood. Check out Walmart or McDonald's parking lot. Within a span of 1 hr you can count 30 Teslas. As for the competitor's cars, good luck seeing one! The Musk owns EV revolution, period."

"Tesla is not just a car company, Tesla is a hope, Tesla is a promise , Tesla is a leader to change our world into a better place."
Market values $1.400.000 for every car unit they sell. Thats makes $650Billions. Still a very low number. We will go higher to 2000 by Jan end.
This thing is about to past Facebook in market cap? In reality how can that be possible? Facebook is a growth company too and has the revenue and balance sheet more superior than Tesla.

"Tesla just reported they will announce 4Q earnings on 1/27! Knowing that 4Q deliveries was their highest ever, what do you think earnings will report?"
"Tesla is one of the most over valued stocks ever. Companies are valued (or should be) on the basis of a stream of likely earnings in the future. To value it sensibly at $ 800 billion, it would have to be able to generate profits of around $50bn a year in fairly short order. That is simply not possible. The car market is intensely competitive. Tesla is now being outsold by three other companies in Europe. I suspect the big fall will come after 27th January 2021. The cult like followers are anticipating incredible results. When they are merely in line with expectations perhaps a sense of reality will set in. Moods change very quickly in markets."
"BUY THE DIP BOYS AND GIRLS THIS IS THE STOCK FOR THE NEXT 5 YEARS>>>>>STAY LONG THIS IS HSORT TERM PAIN>>>>FOR A COMPANY THAY IS CRUSHING ALL ""COMPETITION"" BUY ALL WEAKNESS>>>>>>FULL SELF DRIVE THIS YEAR ALSO!!!!!!!!AND CYBER TRUCK AND TWO NEW FACTORIES TO INCREASE PRODUCTION!!!!"
"Amazingly low volume today, after Tesla missed on earnings predictions and Elon basically admitted that their future is bleak, plus increasing warranty costs. Fans are holding out for hope in battery-trucks, and a few still believe in FSD."

"December 30, 2019 is the day of the first China sales deliveries to actual customers. Plus this year ends on a weekday, Tuesday December 31, 2019. No weekend days should help last minute deliveries."
I say that there is no way he has funding secured. I say that is a big fat lie. Who in their right mind would loan money to buy out a company that has always lost money at about a 20% premium at an already over inflated price? He needed to raise money and this is one way to do it I guess.
Collapse
Up 2.5% in Frankfurt
I suppose it is too much to ask that Tesla close out the year lower than where the share price started the year.
"P / E> 1000, toooooooooooooooooooooooooooo expensive !!! Normally in the market advanced companies P / E = 40"
It's dropping because of the nature of the stock market. Nothing can go up forever and everyday. It's a healthy pullback! Let's go TSLA. Long term is the key!
ELON JUST SAID FULL SELF DRIVE WILL BE RELEASED BY Q2 BUYYYY THE DIP BOYS AND GIRLS.

"A history lesson for today's young investors. There was a huge market run-up leading up to Y2K (That is the year 2000). Everyone thought they would get rich on stocks and retire young. Then the ""correction"".... NASDAQ fell 85%...over 2-1/2 years. Dip after dip after dip.... a 30-month slide erasing 85% of NASDAQ value. It took 11 years - until 2013 for NASDAQ to reach its former value (of 3800). 85% loss, followed by a slow, 11 year recovery. Some perspective..."
I'm sure the 45 million dollars of in the money calls sold by the big boys in 4 separate trades last week are all going to be wrong about where the stock is heading.....LMAO.

"My hat is off to longs. I went flat a few days ago. I was a writer of options. I will not disclose my current position. But, how this stock can stay a 3-digit stock More highly valued than Ford and GM by market cap is beyond me. They have lost 3 key financial executives this year (two this week!!), and Elon is obviously pulling a PR stunt to backload production numbers to the end of the quarter, and he is spreading himself thinner in his quest for stardom via things like The Onion outreach today. Longs are being scammed by the greatest showman since P.T. Barnum."
"TSLA has a minimum of 2 billion data hours (my own metric and estimate) for building its neural net, which is used for TSLA's 10 times safer than a human 2021 full autonomy. Any competitor has that?? What's that you say? Nothing? I thought so."
THIS IS A PREVIEW OF WHAT IT WILL LOOK LIKE WHEN TESLA POSTS THAT HUGE Q4 BEAT ON STRONG MODEL Y AND 3 SALES!!!!!!!!!!!
I wonder who’s buying in at these prices.
crash
This stock is like you go to the casino every day and hit lucky 7s every time.
"Facebooks earnings is more than Tesla’s revenue or approximately the same, yet tsla is worth about the same as Facebook!FB earnings ~= TSLA revenue"
"In Q4 Tesla only sold 30,475 Model 3s in Europe Sales of the Model S and Model X were almost non existent. Reality: Tesla invested more in Bitcoins (1.5 billion) than their business ($1.1 billion)."
NTSB and Tesla wheres the investigation results for all other Tesla cars including the one that hit the freeway divider in California? the NTSB said the model s in FL crash battery ignite twice even after crash when it was put down...wheres the results on actors crash west Hollywood? they hide every results ...keep contacting local gov and feds...contact senators let them know of all elons and these safety regulators corruptions..do the right takes more than one person to wake those regulators know they need to be out and choose right public workers that cares for your safety.
TESLA IS GOING TO THE MOON TODAY BOYS AND GIRLS. THINK NEW ALL TIME HIGHS. ELON IS THE VOICE OF THE PPL AND TESLA IS ELON INK STAY LONG. THEY WILL DOUBLE SALES THIS YEAR WITH NEW FACTORIES PRODUCTS AND MARKETS THEY ARE ENTERING. FULL SELF DRIVE WILL BE REVOLUTIONARY!!!!

"Musk has pulled a Trump by painting himself in a corner. Basically stating that funding is not secure and that the Saudi's have held conversations of additional investment. Tesla and Musk now have additional issues: 1) discussions have been occurring without the Board of Directors in the communication: 2) everyone who has worked funding deals knows that unless there is an Letter of Intent that nothing really moving forward; 3) the hot air disrupted the value to short sellers on the market at a key moment; 4) required filings with the SEC on a material event have not occurred; and 5) market was not notified prior to the event announcement to address trading, as well as managing employee/management trades. Adding that he just weakened Tesla's ability to negotiate a strong buyout, Tesla almost needs to negotiate any kind of deal for a partial buyout now. Musk's only hope is that the Trump SEC is as dysfunctional as the rest of the government. This one is easy for the SEC to determine as Musk just revealed that the text was incorrect. If Tesla Board is smart, they will remove Musk from the daily management and start mitigating a very expensive error for the company. What could be a $100 million fine might be difficult for Tesla to pay; adding that employees may be barred from any transactions for 12 months could cause a stock drop. Mindless errors."
buy shares today and I guarantee you less then a week we will make money
Anybody else think Lucid and VW gonna eat into Tesla’s market share?
No reason for TSLA to be down $70The only reason is a technical one as it was covering its GAP UP from last week!ButIt gapped down from $880 and it will cover that gap as well.Go TSLA!

So how will the market response to this on Monday? Interesting they put out news on Saturday. Time to digest. They’ve done it before. Wish stock market was open 24/7 like Bitcoin.
Stock is going to lose a lot more value than the $1.5B investment in BTC
Very strange you guys.Daimler up 9% today...Tesla down. How can this be? This is against the laws of physics.
Tesla just announced 4Q earnings on 1/27 WOOHOO!!!!

There were elderly people who invested in Tesla bonds. sad...hopefully Musk will do jail time.
Musk just gave the short a better bet
"I know it’s early on in the AH, but I love the pump"
I bet 90% of the kids pumping their money into Tesla don’t even know it took amazon 10 years to recover its 1999 highs after the internet bubble burst. I’m sure most of them think they are willing to hold that long. But most won’t
"I am so ecstatic that Elon Musk is saving the planet; helping out the human race in multiple realms. He is even taking on the monumental task of helping to relieve the inconvenience of wealthy Californians of heavy traffic while attending a baseball game, not to mention the 30 minute rocket trip to anywhere on the planet. Passengers will no longer need to suffer the 12 hours of misery in the $16,000 First Class Suite on an Airbus 380, or the cramped confines of their own personal Gulfstream G650. It's so reassuring that Musk has the hearts and souls of the common folk, when he envisions these great accomplishments. Musk will go down in the laurels with Jonas Salk and Albert Eisenstein with his contribution to humanity. Musk is my hero."
I made over $23k today
Would love to see Tesla run over FB market cap by this Friday.
Once the tax credits go away ...how much will Demand go away ?
What Gordon Johnson is thinking now?
"Watching Bloomberg right now. Looking at their 2025 bond price chart. Talk about a blow out! Wow. That is a huge drop in a week. What this means is much harder to raise capital and MUCH more expensive to do it. Then show $6,500 cash burn minute. Zero cash end of 2019. Will need 2 billion in near term or more. Their last bond was over 5%, those days are gone. Now 10% or above. Tesla debt is getting out of control. You knew that already. luck"
"The Jonas report is BS. 48,000 cars delivered is the expectation. Then they claim only a $30 million loss for the Qtr. Something is not adding up. Maybe the 48,000 was just for Model 3. The SEC should be looking into Jonas now."
$TSLA never goes down! Tesla Inc. is the BIGGEST PONZI SCHEME in history!$10 Million Book Value $700 Billion Market Value!
"The one consistent aspect to Tesla's performance is the chart, it is woefully bearish.There is a small support at 600, but next major support is 460.If there's any sort of an overall market pullback Tesla will undoubtedly see 460 in double quick time."
"Hi shorts, another great year start right? LOL"
"tesla will provide green energy and global power distribution for bit coin mining, eheheheheheh"
TSLA up in Frankfurt 2%+
"Take note of today Nov. 8, 2018, TSLA crossed over 350 for the last time and will never revisit 350 again."
There she goes...ready to dive from a big cliff :D
Tesla price to book value ratio is 10 times higher than S&P500 average.

"lots of GAPs to fill...if this is the correction, support is at $740 (fills a gap) 20dMA...then $614 50dMA..."
"Idea - turn the electron microscope off and just look at the big picture. a.) Tesla can make about 7,000 cars a week (being generous), that's 91,000 per quarter. b.) Selling 91,000 Tesla cars is not profitable. In Q2 they sold 95,200 and lost $400 million. c.) Tesla is cutting prices (the reason doesn't matter much - lower prices means less revenue.) . IMO trying to estimate deliveries, inventories, shipments, and the ever elusive ""demand"" is entertaining but not very meaningful. A Q3 operating loss is hardwired in."
"I'm so happy with Tesla, long term.... I see similar stuff with OpErA limited, they are expanding like crazy, great fundamentals ton of cash, users expanded to over 80 mil+, VPN security features ad free browsing and I'm sure they are collecting the new oil, data. good short to mid term play... long bullish on Tesla, about to myself one. this is awesome. happy 2021..."
"""In July, Musk tweeted that he had ""verbal"" government approval to build a Hyperloop that would connect New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C., though no formal announcements has been made."" Just saying..."
"Wasn't this guy supposed to go to Jail?? Ughhh someone said the SEC was on to him and they were cheering?? mmmm Lets see was these cars built in a tent?? I have not forgotten what was said am Elon Musk and my children's children never will. Now go start writing the history books. Don't own any stock, wish I did...was never payed to pump. Congratulations is in order to Elon Musk I knew he could do it and to all the new millionaires take profits and wait for the next runup. Remember this race is a marathon not a sprint be prepared for the next surge. Whatever you choose to do GLTA."
Monday will be nice day beautiful green.
"One of the largest public pensions in the U.S. just disclosed substantial changes in its stock investments.The New York State Teachers’ Retirement System initiated a position in Tesla (ticker: TSLA) stock, bought more Charles Schwab (SCHW) shares, and cut back in investments in Intel (INTC) and Oracle (ORCL) stock. The NYSTRS disclosed the trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.NYSTRS declined to comment on its investment changes. With $120.5 billion in net assets as of June 30, the pension says it is among the 10 largest U.S. public retirement funds.The pension bought 999,948 Tesla shares in the fourth quarter. It didn’t own any shares of the electric-vehicle company at the end of the third quarter.Tesla stock rocketed more than eight times in value last year, and so far in 2021 through Friday’s close, shares are up 12.5%. In comparison, the S&P 500 index, a measure of the broader market, rose 16.3% in 2020, and is down 1.1% so far in 2021."
Iwould rather own TSLA than Bitcoin at these prices. TSLA has a business plan and a following. Bitcoin has thin air and a following. If both lose the following only TSLA will still produce profits and be able to distribute them.
Laughing at the people that bought puts today.

"Why is it so hard for the die-hard longs to just admit that Model 3 production in 2017 was a huge disappointment? They will delivery less in 6 months of production, then they guidanced for just one week, albeit the last week of the year. It's OK, let it out, it won't hurt for long. Then you can focus your energy on how Tesla will be building 5,000 / week by 3/31/18. And when that fails, there's always the fallback plan of 10,000 / week by 12/31/18. After that, however, I can't help you none."

"Goldman and MS will now restore coverage of Tesla-with their current sell ratings and targets pf 180. But longs will say that is good news. Expect Musk to say ""profitable.good cash flow and do not need cash"" at least 10 times in next week."
"Didn't take long for at least one fund manager to seize the opportunity to sell a chunk of his Tesla holdings. Remember if Tesla stock, the collateral the company uses for much of its loans, drops below 300, many of those loans become callable, and stock must be sold to avoid default. The company no doubt has set up various holding companies with cash to buy back stock when it approaches the 300 mark. Yesterday they overbought, the stock rose too much and this morning fund managers are seizing their chance to sell. Tesla is burning more cash."

"Tesla management is playing with fire just like casino on high speculative and leverage investment. Investing in bitcoin, company is going away from its core business model.

"It's too funny to see bears jump in as soon as stock drops like 5-10% haha. The stock ran over 1500% last year. Give it some breather space. Longs will still be green if it drops another 70%. Let that sink in and realize what you have missed :P Anyways, did anything change on Tesla last one week? NO! So this drop is just a technical drop and it will rebound easily if the underlying business doesn't change."
"Shorties have no exit to run to, so sad but they deserve it"
China has the world's largest army. Funny how that suddenly become relevant to TSLA's share price.
"When it crashes I'll sell and buy back at the lower price ,until then I'm riding the wave 50 ft Maui Waui wave!.. lol "
"Really, once Tesla can mass produce a $25000 fully autonomious and reasonably practical car, with a range of 500 + miles, while would you buy another car unless you have special needs ( probably less than 30% of car owners)?And when Elon says, thats just 3 years away, we give it an additional year.So at most 5 years from now, not only Tesla has the capacicty to produce more than 2 millions vehicles/year(they have fully optimised their manufacturing and added more factories in more locations) but they will also be able to reinvest and build more Gigafactories around the world and meet a good chunk of new cars demand. 5 years is what i think it will take to propel $Tsla beyond $4000 whiteout ever looking back."
"So when this hits 766.60$ tomorrow, do shorts start shouting 666 #$%$ again?"
Why EM does not just invest his own money in Bitcoin and leave the TSLA shareholders out of this speculation. What does bitcoin have to do with an operating company? And is this a responsible thing to do by the mgmt of any publicly traded company?
Tesla Option traders are Dumping massive amounts of Calls. Latest News !!!
Haters will try to find anything to criticize to make up for the fact that they've been wrong for the last up to 10+ years on Tesla.If Elon ordered a salad for lunch they'd say he should have ordered soup. They'll look for anything to unleash their hatred for this man and the company he runs.
If bitcoin increases in value is that going to help Tsla share price ? ..

"Musk is leveraging his legacy using shareholder funds. There are two fates. He will go on to a much higher level or he will crash and burn. I think he will crash and burn. His legacy will be that he flew too close to the sun. His financial autopsy will show that he made the mistake of arrogance. Investors were as much at fault for the implosion of Musk as he was. Musk will be remembered as a case study, a cautionary tale, in the annuls of business, leadership and strategy. Brilliance gone wild. Investors in TSLA should now clearly understand an autocrat is running the company. They should take any credit or fault for what happens here on out. I have no positions in TSLA, and no plans to do so directly or otherwise."
Is it time to guess the weekly production rate of Tesla Model 3 by the end of Q1?I say 1850 Model 3 per week. Just 26% short of expected (revised) volume. Not bad if You consider how much Elon usually exaggerate.What is Your guess?

Have you checked if Tesla will enhance the set-up for the breaks (for more weight or power) also? If not, the AWD and Performance Model 3 will be even more dangerous as the USD 60k version currently sold. I would love to see youtube videos comparing Model 3 and other cars by their capability to decelerate the best!"

TSLA is 2600% over valued. It will take 13 more years of last years growth to justify current stock price.
Who think that the Tesla stock is going back to 360 Monday?!?!? Me!!!!
Many recalls on their vehicles. Losing loads of cash if it wasn’t for those carbon credit sales. This is the most over valued stock on the market.
"No raise, no model y reveal, as of yet no capital for China, demand in the US is dead, few orders in China, barely any in EU, model S/X production cut in half, no replacement models with better batteries coming, no semi production plans, and 34 yo CFO. What'd I miss? $TSLA @TeslaCharts"

None of Tesla's Chinese co's will be able to manufacture at scale, since they depend on the Chinese government for subsidies."
Yeah with the new green energy initiative coming out it doesn’t matter what company in the US it is it’ll probably continue to go up! Might take time but get real this isn’t the first time it’s been this high and it won’t be the last.
Tesla batteries have a fundamental flaw in the structure with the battery the lithium in the battery the anode grows a “finger-like” structure across overtime when that reaches the other side all the energy in the battery is released causing the explosion

"If Tesla just announced the Model Y and took preorders, it would have been the Ponzi scheme continuing. That is not what happened, Tesla announced more layoffs (3 rounds in like nine months), price reductions (3rd reduction in 2019!!), and changed the target release of the 35k Model 3 weeks after earnings call. Say what you want $TSLA is done. If you own the car try to get the value out of it while you can."

They expect GP to have 10% of the market share. Do the math, the current $650M market cap is a steal!!"
So when will workers say enough is enough and walk out enmass on strike for being horrendously overworked? Imagine the stock price reaction. Musk is treating people like machines to reach production goals.
Why EV's will fail to ever take more then 5-10% of the market. Drive down any street in any neighborhood. How many cars are in driveways and the street? How many people live in apartments and condos ? Getting the picture yet? They all have no easy way to charge an EV.

"Just for fun # 8 === Tesla ends the year with a bang They sold 878 EVs in France in December 2020.The ""legacy automakers"" (*) only sold 31,024 EVs. (*) The term ""legacy automaker"" is supposed to convince you that people prefer EVs and they prefer Tesla EVs over those offered by the other manufacturers. The numbers show that people prefer ICEVs over EVS. The numbers show that French consumers who buy EVs have no preference for Tesla at all."

"Entire market tanks and shorts still take credit for TSLA riding the same tide down. Shorts should be very careful now. Don't be surprised if they ban shorting for a while. The Trump is more desperate than ever to artificially fix markets...and Powell can't think straight either. This is the bloody streets that many waited for on the sidelines...bloodier than anyone expected. While many sectors have been impacted by the virus slowing down their businesses, consumers are spending less on smaller luxury purchases and just focusing on necessities. One necessity is still an automobile and anyone who was planning to get a new car, is still going to get a Tesla. Consumers that had a Model Y reserved are still going to take delivery on time....they're even going to likely get a better financing rate as well. So while there will a significant reduction in consumer wants-spending at malls, stores, and any other personal items that aren't a true need....I believe Teslas will keep rolling out of showrooms. And if you're one of the people that have a Tesla on order...investing in TSLA now will help pay for your Tesla. The key is to keep your mind focused on the long term rewards with TSLA and other tech stocks that took a hit. This is the biggest investment opportunity for anyone who's been waiting to invest in the stock market. I don't think the knuckleheads in DC can keep trying to control the market and someone may finally tell them to stop trying to help. Today may finally be the bottom. Everyone's at their wit's end. It's time to buy....everything is undervalued now and way oversold. Bull volume is going to come out ahead sooner than the skeptics want you to believe. The country has locked down in the past few days and the virus spread will slow now. If you're skeptical, invest in 10-25% chunks of your and slowly to your portfolio over a few days. Keep in mind...the outlook at $TSLA, $AMD, and many others has not changed at all....they are still focused on long term goals and companies have taken huge steps to keep their employees safe. Their products will continue to sell. Volatility is always temporary. Buy the bottom and keep holding. TSLA is still a $1500+ target for 2020. The short cockroaches that show up on dark days like this are like a broken clock that's right at least once a day. Keep buying and keep holding. Nothing has changed."

I'm noticing a lot more Tesla cars on the road lately.
Got a Model Y last week. Just put $100 down for a fully loaded Tesla Cybertruck. Am sure it won’t be available for delivery for awhile. There are 2/3 million preorders in the works. By then should of made enough on TSLA stock like last time to pay for it.

"From Wall Street Journal today:ZWICKAU, Germany—Five years and nearly $50 billion into the auto industry’s biggest bet on electric vehicles, Volkswagen VOW -0.78% CEO Herbert Diess and his guest, Chancellor Angela Merkel, stood in anticipation as the first ID.3, Germany’s long-awaited answer to Tesla, rolled off the assembly line.The event at the company’s flagship EV plant just over a year ago marked a “systemic shift from the combustion engine to the electric vehicle,” said Thomas Ulbrich, leader of the ID.3 effort.The car, however, didn’t work as advertised.It could drive, turn corners and stop on a dime. But the fancy technology features VW had promised were either absent or broken. The company’s programmers hadn’t yet figured out how to update the car’s software remotely. Its futuristic head-up display that was supposed to flash speed, directions and other data onto the windshield didn’t function. Early owners began reporting hundreds of other software bugs."

TSLA short interest went up by about 1/3 between 12/15 and 12/31 to a total of 60 million shares. Persistent short selling to establish a large position might explain the relatively low volatility following the inclusion of TSLA in the S&P 500 index on 12/18.Was the surge in price from the upper 600's to 880 driven by short covering? Look on 1/27 for the short interest report as of 1/15.
"Tesla is a fantastic business that is worth $800 billion, aiming to disrupt and dominate the global energy industry in the long game. The electric cars are just the warm-up act for a much larger endgame. For more hot stocks like (TSLA) just go to (http://trade-view.com)."
Have a strong feeling this stock going run to 1000 dollar in between this week on next
"I wonder how many of fElon's suppliers will not be able to produce 5000 pieces per week by the end of June? I wonder if fElon himself will be able to produce 5,000 cars per week even if the supplier can supply the parts."

"For Elon Musk yesterday was pump day. Interview pod cast with Ark where he said. Pump #1 ...FSD by end of year. You can sleep on the way home and your car will drop you off and park itself. Pump #2 500,000 cars in 2019. Pump #3 China factory stamping, paint, and assembly, with production this year. None of these things are true or even possible. That qualifies as fraud. Musk knows it. He is flagrantly violating his settlement agreement with the SEC. And today his high powered DC General Council quit after only two months. Butswinkas surely realizes that Musk is out of control and his actions indefensible. Obviously council would have advised against making such statements, but Musk has too high of an opinion of himself to accept advice from anyone."

...another day older and deeper in debt.
Nio just announced in China that even though the Chinese govt is reducing EV subsidies by 20% in 2021(which buy the way does not help TSLA) it will match the 2020 subsidy through Jan 10th by giving extra incentives...the competitive landscape heats up and will eat at TSLA profits like every other car company in the world that operates on single digit margins...2021 will be a very rocky year for TSLA especially at the current valuation...
still showing a long-term downward trend in my opinion.
"Investors, if you really want to know the who holds the EV battery secret, check out Panasonic (PCRFY). They make the batteries and own the technology. They also developed the new batteries that will double battery life."

"I don’t understand why investors buy ANY stock other than TSLA. With 10% per day guaranteed returns, I need nothing else in my portfolio.Except maybe some Bitcoin."
This would not be a buyout. It would be a bailout.

Elon musk need to worry about Tesla instead of GME and Bitcoin
As bitcoin continues to see a hike in price it is a good indication that the coin will do well this year and after the purchase made by TSLA today it will see bitcoin reaching its new ATM of $50k. I made $200K profit with help I received from Kyle_harrison on telegr:m he is the best signal trader I have seen.

"Tesla investors cash reserves that are typically used for innovation or purchasing assets to better position the company in their industry i.e. EV right? Musk uses 1.5 billion to buy bitcoin which has nothing to do with the EV industry....that's pretty cool. Musk should get another 1.5 billion in powerball tickets that would be cool too! This guy is way too cool.....love that name that he named his kid something like :""+__))(&^^; I think that is what it is? I am almost certain that the kids name doesn't have any letters in it which is also really cool!!"
Elon Musk dumped his shares from Tesla and invested in ExxonMobil. .That was a clue.

"Ummm, do you guys realize that electric cars are not going to solve climate crisis? At this moment electric cars are making it worse.

"A lot of the people who hate on Tesla are just people who wanted to buy the stock but felt like it ran away from them. So instead of biting the bullet they kept waiting for the drop that never happened now getting to the point where they need a monumental crash i the share price just to put them back to the point where they had first thought it had already ran away from him.Seriously, why else would they even be here? They’re not short selling or have ever suggested that they had, so where’s all this interest for TSLA coming from?"

Tesla makes a great car that is the ultimate status symbol. I would buy one but I'll buy the stock instead and get rich first. I don't like geyser mobiles GM and Ford makes.
Musk could and should raise a quick $10 billion with an additional share issue. That would be enough to build several gigafactories and would only dilute the share base by a tiny 1%.Seems like an obvious choice with the stock price at this level

"I am thinking that after the second whitsleblower coming out last week, we will start seeing more insiders blowing the whistle.I would like to see some info coming out about dwindling M3 demand and/or suppliers requiring COD. Something big is brewing on this front... Why the slowing production and buildup of finished goods in the parking lots? A couple of analysts have theorized that the thousands of cars rotting in lathrop and burbank and santa barbara are pre-built RWD versions (the cheaper variety of M3) If that's the case, that would show that lower Tesla price does not make demand rise.There is probably very little demand for m3 at all, hence very little probabiliy that Tesla will survive to see 2019 without a Chap 11 reorg"

I wonder how the market will react to not hitting the 500,000 mark. Any predictions?"
Buy and hold till Wednesday you will thank me stop looking at a quick buck you will make serious coin next week buy and hold
It's the express EV to the BAG HOLDERS CLUB
I heard that only rich professional people invested in Tesla.

"This company part of S&P now so they better not miss these targets. As a reminder to bulls, Musk said in 2016 that by 2020 we will be producing 1 million cars and and reality is barely making to half of that mark. It seems, all along Musk trying to burn shorts by setting these unattainable goals and giving false promises to investors of TSLA. Over last year or so, everyone on winning side (investors, traders) got used to this bubble but one day reality will hit and its gonna be bad. Research telling by 2024 there will be just 10% of car volume will be EV. And not that all will be tsla and there is some serious competition out there in that space. TSLA has few IP blocks which has kept them ahead in this tech sector - EV car, Autonomous driving software/hardware and battery technology. For each of this IP block there are some serious competitors and for me interesting thing is they have their own design/architecture and not just copying what TSLA doing. Typically competition copies leader and catch up with them sooner or letter (Example Intel, Irbot). But interestingly Tesla competitors surely gonna distinguish themselves. By 2024 or before that each IP block will be well developed, there will 2 to 3 decent options and it wont take long for companies like Toyota, Honda, GM, Ford (may be apple) to integrate and put some great product out there for consumers. To make matter worse for TSLA, car sales are going to be significantly down in coming few years (~30%). There are all kinds of projections which indicates 30% of population will never return to office work and that should directly impact car sales. So 10% of EV car volume by 2024 will be just 7% and out of 7% even is mush gets 70%, that will be just 5% of total EV cars for TSLA. So everyone make money as long as you can so that total gains surpass that big loss going to come soon. Good luck!!"
"What we can expect over the coming quarter:- End of Jan Earnings: Based on delivery # that we already know and increased relevancy of model 3 & Y, Tesla will see margin compression. Shares will trade down- February: Fed will provide visibility into rate increase schedule. Shares will trade down- March: Lower share price will cause need for additional financing, i.e probably debt as rates are still low (the smart choice). Shares will trade down."

RBC got it wrong. They overlooked the fact that Tesla can use its overvalued share price to fund operations and acquisitions. Way cheaper than normal auto companies that need to turn a profit. This thing literally flipped the narrative. The stock funds the company people...

"So the guy who died in the car crash, was an Apple engineer on his way to work. He left a wife and two kids and seems like he was a well liked and a smart and reasonable guy. But local news reported something odd. The man's brother claimed that he had complained of the autopilot malfunctioning and swerving towards that same barrier at least 7 times in the past. He said the guy had taken it to Tesla but they couldn't reproduce the problem. That doesn't pass the smell test.This is silicon valley. We get technology. An Apple engineer should be credible and able to work the system to report a serious malfunction like that. If I had that problem and they couldn't reproduce it, I'd mount a GoPro to document it and tell them I'll put the video on YouTube in two weeks, unless I get a call from a smart and curious Tesla engineer who is eager to get to the bottom of the problem.Also, Tesla has extensive logs and diagnostic info of how AP is used. Surely they could go back and capture the event in the logs if there was a malfunction like that. This accident occurred within 10 miles of Tesla HQ in Palo Alto. An Apple engineer who speaks that language would be *eager* to report an odd ball bug like that. Not only to get it fixed but to open doors and network. (He can use it to meet the engineers who designed the AP system. If they hit it off, that's a future job contact.Malfunctioning or not, the driver ultimately has to stay in control of the vehicle. I'd expect an Apple engineer to be sophisticated enough to understand the risks of continuing to use a malfunctioning system."
everyone worked up over an old recall in the meantime my 2019 chev Silverado has been in the shop 7 times for repairs and recalls and I haven't hit 20 thousand kms yet.
"I only see three possibilities for the people who complain about Tesla:1) They are bearish and they are shorting.2) They wish they got in earlier and are hoping it goes down so they can buy at a lower price.3) They are whining about a stock that they have no position in, nor any intention to have a position.Which is it?"
"Again: LOOK at 3 month chart above. The most reliable TA indicator of them ALL, a classic head and shoulders pattern on right side, and we are at the drop off point on the right shoulder.

"The mindset of short-seller is exactly why they missed AMZN when it's $300 dollars, AAPL when it's $400 before the split, and NFLX when it's $80. Looking purely at financials without realizing the bigger picture (the tidal wave of technological evolution) did teach them a lesson."

"A couple of years ago, I sold the shares that I owned. Had I left it alone, I'd have been a millionaire. Bad idea. Over the last 2 years I've bought and sold. Not again, no more. I'm not touching it now. Not fighting Tesla anymore, instead...enjoying the ride. In for the long haul."
"Gap in the $600s need to be filled. If that fails to hold, $400s. Too much EV competition heating up, TSLA went up way too much on hype and S&P 500 inclusion. TSLA only makes a profit from tax credits. WHEN, not IF, other auto makers stop paying TSLA, it's back to no profitability and will be booted off the S&P eventually again. Don't get greedy people. Bulls make money, bears make money, but pigs get slaughtered."

I found $5 bucks in a parking lot the other day. That's more profit than this company has made the last 3 years. FACT !!
Anyone about to buy a Tesla car  just lost all their money. Lol 
"Musk to yard boss: ""Spray some dirt and mud on that that 3 year-old Cyber Truck mock-up, mount it on a trailer, and parade it around the Inland Empire for a few hours. I'll leak an email to the the press that we are off-road testing""."
Buy on the dips... even one share will make you 600 in 3-6 months
"In January, inflation higher, just as I warned, that China manufacturing down and U.S. consumption up leads only to inflation. That'll lead to Feds increasing rates. That leads to bubble collapse. Not to mention China businesses are on the verge of collapse as well. Japan, the third country by GDP appears to be the next country this virus takes hold, and China all the while has been dumping U.S. Treasuries all last year. Every expert is questioning why the market is going higher, not simply inching up but rocketing up as if it's 1999 again. One conclusion is China must be manipulating U.S. stocks and pushing the indices higher from proceeds of U.S. Treasury sales??? Chinese are scared shizless and not all returning to work. This thing has another great depression written all over it. Most articles don't mention this, but the great depression was preceded by massive stock rallies. This cannot end well.https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/02/19/us-bonds-treasury-yields-in-focus-as-part-of-the-yield-curve-inverts.html$^GSPC$^ICIX$^DJI$YANG$TVIX$TSLA"
"$TSLA we here at BTC thank you!! $NIO next to use BTC!! also, look @ ACRX, a new 52 Week High pre market"
Buy the dip!
Was the electric car thing an inside joke that went too far ?
I bet your glad you sold at $900.00
I thought this was supposed to go back up to $900. Wha happened?!
It's all about a retest of the 52wk low.
Very interesting. One of the evidences of the bubble top is exponential rise in the price. The closer to the top - the higher is the rise. We see now every day +3% rise non-stop. Also analyst are driving it with updates - normal situation in the bubble market. Excited to see this bubble during my lifetime
Who was the guy who said after earnings at least it’s not down 10%
It cost my neighbor $600 to fillup his Tesla in Austin last week.
Sad that traders are missing the next big story coming out this year on Tesla. It is energy. Their Powerwall will be huge. Also look for Musk to do an IPO with Starlink. Cathie Woods new ARKX is coming out soon.
Tsla bulls are giving a.heck of a fight but dropping now. Fundamentals are catching up to reality
Tbh I was hoping for another couple big red days so I could load up even more... watched a video today basically explaining how Tesla bought up the batteries/ metal supply and there is no way it’s competitors who are 5-10 yrs behind are gonna be able to have enough Battery supply if they even try to compete. Check mate
What a fun week! Enjoy this weekend long fellas
"So when GM sells 500,000 EVs, should its market cap go from $70 billion to $700,000 billion? Just asking."
Don't get excited and buy this level just because historically it always gone up. Some point every stock go down.Look at $ZM Zoom just couple month ago it look non-stop force at any price that will never go down. Today it go bounceless while break very very strong long term Support line. Likely unfortunate case Just amazing how much money power use going using algo that design to build pattern that people believe and even break it in way that anyone thing it's imposible to trap retail investor.
"Tesla cult, Lucid coming for you with $CCIV take advantage and diversify. Will hit 100 just on immanent Merger announcement pre Superbowl!"
in a week TESLA cab move up $200 easy ... elon is a wealth building machine!

"The battery swap youtube ""demonstration"" was why I started looking at Tesla as a short. I watched it and was like - ""wow... good idea and presentation!""... this was back when I was considering buying a Model S. I was doing research to see if it was worth the $75k+ w/ credits... I would never have considered it without the credits. Colorado+Fed would have been $13.5k credit. So I watch the video of Elon showing the swap... then I look at the date of the video... then I see that it was well in the past and searched to find that it was available in the Model S... then found it wasn't and realized... I WAS JUST ALMOST CONNED!So I did not buy the Model S and instead became a permanent Tesla Short."
I can rest easy knowing this beauty is sitting close to $900 before battery day. Have a nice weekend!
"THIS is the place where one would expect to see official notice of a publicly-traded company being taken private. Funny, as of 6:30 PM EST, there is no such information from Tesla: https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001318605&type=&dateb=&owner=include&count=40"
It's about time to short it big drop. Just according to the chart.
Fellow shorts: What price did you short at? I shorted yesterday at $880.
I told you a couple of days ago. It’s over.
The myth is dead with the real EV cars from the automobile giants. Tesla will never have significant operational earnings. So sad bubble story.
Elon says he has plans to take starlinl to ipoRetail investors mstly tesla investors will have priority

"Pump and Dump new 52 week low before the week is up, then the big drop,"
its 1999 all over again...
Tesla Stock Split: Is Another One Coming?
The only negative I can see in Tesla is the $10 billion in debt. We need to recognize that the 10 billion has mostly gone into infrastructure and R&D. Tesla will hit 13 to 14 Billion in revenue this year and 25 to 30 Billion next year. They have 25 billion in revenue coming in just on the model 3 pre-orders alone. 500-600 next year.
Finally broke 5 day vwap index buying is over good luck next week everyone

"""Buy the dip""!!!"
The higher a valuation the higher the risk. Most people buy something after it already went up a lot thinking it will continue forever. An investor finds undervalued companies with good management and a clear business plan. A gambler just follows the others to the casino. Which one are you? :)
"Coal, oil, ICE companies are all in the way down. Solar energy and EV on the way up. I wouldn’t bet against the future."
"The departure of the highly respected and experienced quality production head from TSLA is indeed a big deal. The thing that really speaks to that is the fact that TSLA has not been up front on disclosing that to the public, it is a significant and material fact. Of course, when you add it to the already OBVIOUS multiple departures of the very smartest , best people from TSLA in recent week, months and the last year etc, it really reinforces the concept that justifies the drop in TSLA shares from the $300's to the present level. The real question is whether the valuation should be further reset by the market to a sub $200 level , as many in wall street feel is appropriate and on its way to happening, of should it linger in the current range. Clearly those who are calling for a big move up in TSLA shareprice from here are out of touch with reality. Smart executives , would not be leaving TSLA in droves, giving up stock option wealth because of leaving , if they did not know for a fact that TSLA would not be able to make those stock options make them richer...…….. Think about it...…………..."
No such thing as the Impossible can't be done. As it already has been done in the future. Were just still stuck in the futures past.
How soon will we see $1000? Summer? We wanna be rich like the other Teslas.
Question for Tesla Long:- here is detail of Civil Lawsuit against one of ex-employee.So it's Civil charge and not Criminal Charge even while claiming he theft data.Is it Civil charge because Criminal charge would harm lot more? Tesla try avoiding Federal Investigation into matter? If So why? Is this method to prevent whistleblower or is this because tesla afraid of some wrong doing come out into process?https://t.co/Nw7i8AgJZi
test $900 this week!
Being long in Tesla must feel like Marcellus Wallace felt in Pulp Fiction when that dude was behind him wheelin and dealin.
"To help save the planet, Tesla has developed a carbon-free footprint electric chair, comprised of an array of solar panels, 10 PowerWall batteries, a power converter (it's the amps that get ya, not the volts), and a new and improved version of 'Ole Sparky.Testing in currently ongoing, using only ""volunteered"" Tesla employees (ironically, those who recently submitted safely grievances in Fremont) . Musk calls it a win-win for humanity, and expects demand to be so high, that even California is considering bringing back the death penalty. Comes is basic black, red an additional $2,500, rainbow striped (CA only) $5,000. And of course, deposits will be gladly accepted, years in advance."
Cry me a river - you weren’t able or were too scared to invest at the beginning of 2020 like the rest of us longs looking at a 10x. No we’re not gonna sell now or ever. Buy Tesla. Hold Tesla. Period.
"some people have high expectations it was only 1000 last week now 1500 and it went to almost 1800, even it go down at 1000, come on this still good! Greed will frustrate people who does not have knowledge with stocks."
Bought more shares today and Monday Have been buying since $70 ($350 pre-split). Never a bad time to buy Tesla!

"If I'm not mistaken, I do recall the shorts saying, ""TSLA will never see above $800 again."" Very wrong, you were, shorts! The demand for TSLA shares outweigh the supply, and every week ordinary people put a ton of money into TSLA automatically through S&P funds."
"Word of caution on relying on oil phalic's energy ""numbers"".A. He's a proven moron. (More evidence provided below.)B. He's a kool aid gulping cult member, so prone to lying.C. When he originally tried to say all of his energy was $10/mt because of the solar panels, he failed to mention the upfront costs of the PV system he bought, until I brought it up. D. The moron bragged about doubling his electrical service to save energy use.H'Yeah,... bizzarro.Now let's do some real ciphering on those numbers oil forgot the mention when he said his energy bill was $10/mt.Say you wanted to power a home 100% with solar panels and the average usage is 2000 kwh's per month. Using one of these solar panel sizing calculators, say in Texas (a relatively sunny state) it says you'd need at least a 15kW system. In less sunny states it would be much larger.If the average cost of a system is $3/kW, that's $45,000.If you were to finance the system for 20 years at 5% the payment would be about $300/mt.I know Texas is a deregulated state so you can get electricity off the grid anywhere from $0.04 to $0.10/kwh depending on how well you shop. Let's assume $0.07/kwh. At an average usage of 2000 kwh's, that's a monthly cost of $140/mt.That's less than half the payment for the ""free energy"".It gets worse.If you take the $45,000 and invest it in something that returns 5% per year (yours truly regularly gets 10 to 20%/yr out of it),.... That's $2250 per year or $187/mt.That would pay the electric bill (and dinner for 4 at the all you can eat Chinese buffet,... where the owner walks out after cabin boy and his date leboy have been there for a couple of hours and says - ""you go home now,.... you eat too much,.... you too beeg,... you eat all my flied lice,... you go home now.) and you'd still have your $45,000.Let's say you cut your energy usage in half and buy half the solar panels. The payment is still $150/mt and now you're miserable.This isn't rocket science. You'd have to be a moron to buy a solar panel system. And we have the evidence,... oil phalic bought his."
Take heart my fellow shorts. All that BTC hype only moved TSLA up 2% today while the rest of the EV bubble stocks are red against a green NASDAQ. The EV bubble may finally be bursting.

For the first time i'm considering canceling the Cybertruck order for the Apple car they just announced!
"So why did Tesla cancel the promised Long Range lower priced Model Y? They can't make a profit selling it. Tesla's profit (wink, wink) margin is no where near what they are claiming. By counting warranty repairs as ""good will"" gestures, and omitting R&D cost s from margin calculations (as all other OEM's do), they have created this façade of their car division as being profitable. Apple would make a killing on iPhones (more than they do), if they designed themselves."
"What is the conversion rate to sales for employees with the Model 3? We know all 40,000 employees (Tesla and SpaceX combined) were GIVEN (no need to pay $1000) an effective reservation for a Model 3. If demand for the Model 3 is so extreme (I'd expect it to be especially high among employees) seeing how many took their option to purchase a Model 3, would give us a good idea on the conversion-rate to expect on the rest of the (supposedly) ""500,000"" Model 3 general-public reservations."

This recall is nothing compared to Toyota which has recalled 1.5 million cars this year alone. As for 150 k EV recall is only occurring on cars made between 2016-2018 which Their USB or memory card needs to be replaced so the backup monitor can work probably. An easy fix and fast. No big deal.

Fun facts... 1.4 billion vehicles currently on the road. Predicted all EV by 2035. Tsla leads all EV sales @18%. If they JUST MAINTAIN that % it equates to 252 million tsla’s on the road compared to the current 1 million. Bullish I’d say so...

TSLA will be up at least $60 tomorrow
"If you read the words of Elon who's saying Tesla will get it's delivery up to volume ""in the coming months"", isn't that a sign that it isn't going to happen as promised in the coming days? The street is anticipating the end of this month to see 5,000 T3's roll of the assembly line. It's only the 4th or 5th delay in the delivery window."

"$NIO $TSLA Hey all hope the weekend is or was nice. Check my streams and see what I said for ex with tesla I told you to buy on the dips because its going right back up. When it dropped to 1418 I bought another share and minutes later it went right back up to where it is now and I am holding in the green. Day traders will try to cash in for tiny scrap of money but I am waiting until we hit around the 2k mark which is coming soon. I hear so many speaking of battery day and all this finance charts but even the best analysis has no clue when or what can cause a spike. Tesla can and probably will hit 1800 - 2000 even without battery day on a whim and all we need is that one positive news feed about anything on any given time and the same people with shakey hands will begin to fomo because they see the price rapidly going up. China USA tension wont mean anything and you should be using that to buy in. With NIo its the same Nio has shown to move up multiple points and is already up and holding when it used to be at 4's and now is at 13's it already hit a high of mid 16 and will go higher at any given time earnings or no earnings. Both NIO and TESLA are ev suppliers that have actually electric 0 emissions and are producing high quality vehicles now. Tesla and nio can both profit in china the market space for potential is huge with over 4x the buyers there than in Both the USA and EU alone. Long term is the only way to hold shares with EV stocks such as these that have a clear future. EVs are the future and clean energy is becoming a standard world wide. Follow the Money and the Money is in China. Stop letting your prejudice, National pride, or fear prevent you from making some money in the market or in some cases a better person."

BREAKING: MoviePass in talks to acquire $TSLA at $430 per share.
"New research from Morgan Stanley argues that traditional internal combustion engines—the mainstay of automobiles for more than a century—are destined to become money-losers as early as 2030. “We believe the market may be ascribing zero (or even negative?) value for ICE-derived revenues at GM and Ford,” auto analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a Jan. 29 analysis. He lists a variety of factors likely to “transform what were once profit-generating assets into potentially loss-making and cash-burning businesses.”"

"The *voluntary* recall is a cheap and easy fix. Replace 3 bolts prone to corrosion. It's only an issue where a lot of salt is used on the roads, but Tesla is replacing all of them worldwide, so people don't have to worry about buying used cars.This only affects the power steering assist. The manual steering linkage would still work fine. No accidents or injuries have been reported. I wonder if they will honor the recall on salvaged cars? (Most Japanese car makers will.

$1500 by July 4th. God Bless America and $TSLA.
Started to buy Tesla way back when at $38. $100 and $180 a share 1000 shares was easily a part of any well seasoned portfolio. And today with 5:1 split that’s 5000 shares.
"Go Tesla!Tesla sold 5,798 Model 3s in the United Kingdom in December. This eclipsed the Volkswagen Golf, the second-place vehicle, by 1,328 units. The Ford Fiesta, the top seller in the UK for 2020, finished third for the month, with 3,367 units sold."
"If I ever need to ramp up production from 10,000 a week to 1,550 per quarter I'll make sure to ask Elon how."
"When a factory shuts down, no inventory is being produced so instead of costs allocated to production, a certain amount of costs fall to the bottom line. Will this not cause a negative earnings surprise next quarter? Factory through-put is essential to maintain a factory's costs."
Let’s go Tesla $1000
where is Walle these days??
Think about how challenging it'll be to secure financing now to support their debt based operations.
"Since Elon believes in “ transparency” as he stated after his 420 tweet, why not be transparent and show the model 3 reservation list changes in the past 3 months.. nothing fancy, just a daily Excel table will do.. And can anyone explain how to build more than 5000 cars a week when the paint shop is the production bottleneck? That makes no sense at all"
"an analyst moved his target from 500 to 1200 yesterday. thats manipulation and (should be) criminal. EVERYBODY with common sense knows, that Tesla will not be a monopolyking over EVs in the future. And yes, Europe is being taken over by the real carmakers now. Theres loads of good evcars coming in the coming months and tesla will have a market share of 5-10% in the future. oh, and by the way, they still dont make any money on it. :)"

"SERIOUS QUESTION. Esp for 3 owners Li Ion batteries catch fire because of a manufacturing defect or damage. This starts a chemical reaction. This in turn overheats the other cells to overheat causing a chain reaction and catch fire. This is called thermo runaway. A lot of times this happens when charging. Since most Tesla owners have charging stations in their garages, If Tripp is correct, wouldn't you want to know if your batter pack was damaged in any way. I don't want to hear about smart charging. Most cell phones have smart charging yet they caught fire. The Fire in LA proved that these car cannot detect a Fire.

Everything they bought in Q1 was above $300.which means they are the ones holding this up right now. and they will be more likely to rapid sell if they can't hold it as their average buying price was much higher than FMR's.

"Tesla's inclusion in the S&P 500 forced index-tracking funds to buy shares, boosting its shares during the fourth quarter. Some hedge funds such as Coatue Management significantly cut back their stakes during the same time period, leaving them less likely to gain from the company's 13.4% gain for the year to date.

"@richardIf I were Musk I might be inclined to build 5 gigafactories rather than 1. If the market wants to give you free money, why wouldn't you take it?In the end, I don't believe Tesla cars will be that much superior to any other EV maker. And a lot of other EV makers are coming. With that said, what Musk can do is just beat them all to the punch. He can just be there far sooner than they get there. For that to happen, he has to spend, and spend big. VW has committed $90 billion to EV. That's nine zero billion.They are coming. Do you get that? Musk will not have this business to himself. But what Musk does have is far cheaper capital than anyone else."

"Tesla paradox alert: Tesla claims they will grow 50% yoy for multiple years. Analysts say anywhere from 10-30m cars/year. Yet Musk also says the robotaxi business will boom and car utilization will increase by multiples. Don't these two predictions contradict each other? If car utilization increases by 5x, that means car market is 1/5 what it used to be. So how are they going to sell 30m cars a year when the worldwide car market contracts to 15 million cars because of FSD?"

"I once lost a good deal of money in an investment. The company was lead by a very charismatic leader, who was universally popular in the industry. He was a smooth talker and always spun things to his advantage. One day he couldn't outspin the cold, hard numbers and his company went bankrupt (and my investment went to zero). I learned then to identify this character and vowed to never lose money to such a charlatan again. Musk is a mirror image of that con artist, only 15 years younger and even more popular. I warn you all to do thorough research into his history. There are resources, but you have to search for them because loving Musk is ""cool"" now. I'm afraid mainstream media and the banks have failed you because they're too busy trying to ride the pump train.For those you care, scour the court filings (Musk has many suites).

In 2022 Tesla will have 4, maybe 5 models, S, X, 3, Y, maybe Roadster (which will be a money loser). Model S is way overdue for a redesign. Model X may be cancelled by then, also, as it shares so little with the other platforms (huge blunder by Musk, btw) and therefore, expensive to produce."
You’d think shorts loosing over $40 billion in 2020 betting against Elon Musk and Tesla would be more contrite.

They just won’t let it go.

"If you're old enough, do you recall the first time you heard about barcode scanning for groceries? It seemed such a novelty at first, but soon you began to see it in your neighborhood grocery stores. No more tedious hand-punching of prices into a register, and the check-out lines sped up. It seemed pretty marvelous. Now it's the norm. I think this is what we'll be seeing in the next couple of years in terms of self-driving cars. The first ones we see will seem like a novelty. Then very soon after, it will become so common as to be the norm. We're on the cusp of something very big here."
For tesla to maintain their current valuation they will have to have 65% of the ENTIRE care market in 10 years. Do you really see that happening?
"DETROIT (AP) — Tesla Inc. is balking at recalling about 159,000 vehicles with potentially defective touch screens, so U.S. safety regulators are moving to force the company to take action.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Wednesday sent a letter to Tesla saying it has tentatively determined that the screens are defective and pose a safety risk because they can cause backup cameras to go dark and defrosters to malfunction.The agency wouldn't comment beyond the letter, which is a rare step toward a public hearing and eventual legal action. Experts say the letter means that Tesla has resisted doing a recall that NHTSA feels is necessary.“It's obvious to me that Tesla told NHTSA to go pound sand, so what they're about to get, they've earned it,” said Frank Borris, a former head of the agency's Office of Defects Investigation who now runs a safety consulting business.Messages were left Wednesday seeking comment from Tesla, which is based in Palo Alto, California.Last June, the agency opened an investigation into complaints that the giant touch screens would go dark in certain 2012 through 2018 Model S cars and 2016 through 2018 Model X Tesla vehicles. It upgraded the probe to an engineering analysis in November.The letter says the agency has determined that the screens are defective because their computer processors have a finite number of program-and-erase cycles. NHTSA says the screens would fail in five to six years, which isn't sufficient for safety-critical features.“The lack of a functioning windshield defogging and defrosting system may decrease the driver's visibility in inclement weather, increasing the risk of a crash,” the letter said.In data submitted by Tesla, the agency found more than 12,000 customer complaints, field reports, warranty claims and other claims related to the screens, the letter said.NHTSA also determined that the failure rate for the screens is higher than the rate for vehicles involved in prior recalls for similar problems.Tesla tried to fix the problem with several over-the-air software updates, but NHTSA said it tentatively believes the fixes are insufficient.“I think it's planned obsolescence, which requires physical replacement of a part which Tesla tried to gloss over by sending a software update,” said Jason Levine, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety.The screen failures also can cause the loss of audible chimes and alerts that are part of Tesla’s “Autopilot” driver-assist system.The letter says that if Tesla formally decides not to do a recall, it has to provide NHTSA with an explanation. The agency can schedule a public meeting on matter and could turn it over to the Justice Department for legal action, Borris said.Borris, who reviewed the letter, called it very thorough and said NHTSA has a strong case should Tesla decide to challenge the agency in court."

"Sales of Tesla's Model X continue to tank, meanwhile sales of the Genesis GV80 soar."
"Apple's revenue is barely $300B.Apple's market cap is $2T.Apple is considered a tech company.Conservatively assume TSLA will produce 10M cars in 2030.If average car price is ~$35,000 (before FSD software), this makes $350B in revenue.FSD alone can have ~$50B (if half of the car buyers include FSD).Energy business will generate ~$200B in revenue.If you add revenues from robotaxi, insurance, HVAC etc., the revenue can very well reach $700~800B.Assume TSLA is valued as a tech company (for the sake of argument).Do 6~7 multiple (I think it'll be higher) to the revenue, then TSLA will be worth ~$5T by 2030.That is about $5000 in stock price compared to current market cap.you can argue and nitpick each number I present here, but if TSLA becomes the disruptor in EV and Energy business as it claims it will, you'll be happy if you buy the stock now and hold for the next decade.But, it's just my humble opinion."
"I find it most interesting that Rusch 1,036 and Ives 1,250 new targets for the first time have not pushed Tesla higher. Once upon a time in this fantasy world, there long term targets would be hit in weeks. In November Ives raised his base-case stock price target to $560 from $500. Best case, you all fooled him. So he more than doubled it. Basically, in two short months say Tesla is not a 560 billion dollar company but a 1.2 trillion dollar company. Yes 300 billion for the two existing and two to be built factories. Not enough cars built on the planet to support that number. And you know what, all of you bought it. So why aren't you buying it anymore?"
"Scotty, you've got to hold $280. I'm giving it all she's got Captain!"
So tired of hearing the “Tesla isn’t profitable without emission credits” baloney. Capex was over 3 billion in 2020. Emission credits a few hundred million per quarter. What that means is if Tesla would stop pouring money into building the most efficient factories in the world they’d be wildly profitable now. Building the factories is the right move of course. The emission argument is bunk.

Breaking news - $TSLA will give one car per share to each shareholder
This is the end. This is the end my beautiful friend. The end.
"TSLA at $700 ($3,500 pre split) and BTC at $30,000. Is something strange going on here or is it just me? Is there an infinite demand for TSLA stock with no end in sight or will the markets take a breather and wait for some 'show me the money' milestones? 510-520k EOY deliveries will likely buoy SP a bit. Sell on the news would make sense except that earnings are around the corner and could be gangbusters with added revenue and China margin improvements. Will TSLA see 800 or even 900 after that? Makes little sense to hit those levels at this stage but who would count it out given Tesla 'fever' taking over?"

"After the model 3 production hitting the 5k mark, 10k mark, then it comes a huge proliferation of energy storage stations across the globe, followed by semi truck, model Y and roadster 2 hitting the market. This is only a $360 stock, not even at 52-week high. Wondering how soon it will hit $500."
well i didn't think we'd get to 825 this fast.. better say lets get to $835!

what will happen if Elon sells all his shares for Mars colonization?
Q1 production was down 45% versus Q4. Musk says it is because Panasonic can’t produce enough batteries. Does anyone believe Panasonic’s battery production fell 45% in Q1 because they couldn’t produce them when they could in Q3 and Q4?
where the f is tomorrow can't wait ( -10 % ) my puts gonna be like the feds printing cash

I really wish I had listened to the bagholders when they were relentlessly said to buy at $378 instead of shorting there.

does anyone think the market will crash this year. personally i don’t see a reason but i want opinions... i’ve been hearing stuff
"It's so funny: All the ICE CEOs say they're doing all kinds of joint ventures to someday maybe come up with a half-mediocre EV. Keep waiting ... and Waiting ... and WAITING ... Meanwhile, some people think maybe Apple will try to do an EV. Oh yeah, Tim Cook is a real EV guru! LOL. Cook doesn't know squat about EVs. Jobs developed the Mac, iPhone, and iPad. But ok, Cook gets credit for the earbuds. So Cook's gonna jump from creating earbuds to creating EVs? Too funny. If Apple's going to do anything EV, it will be with like three or four other joint-venture partners and they'll probably put some piece of chraep EV on the road in like 2027 or later. Then it will give up after nobody buys it. By 2027, Apple will be about 50 years behind Tesla's EV technology."
Made 220k on #TSLA in 10 months! i will get back in but sometimes you have to face reality! Love this company and i still believe in Elon!!
"Good job longs! You pushed this up nicely. I was able to buy some $650 strike puts today for the price I sold the $600 strike puts last week.Now, you can ease off. I had been worried that TSLA would drop below $600 by March expiration, but, now I am well enough positioned for that. Thanks again."
"So semi is out, pickup truck is out, Moden Zen is out, rocket is out, tunnel is out, Mars colony is out.

Does the snakeoil salesman and born liar has anything more this week to lie about?"
Personal reasons: I don't want to go to jail.
TSLA misses! Yay!!!
Tesla investors just keep buying and buying. Elon Musk already told you the SP is too high several months ago. Michael Burry of the big short announced his expanding short position. Tesla already missed earnings and is lagging other major automakers in Europe in the EV market itself. Tesla doesn't even make money without energy credits. Tesla's forward forward 2023 PE is 150. So many warning signs that the SP is not supported by rational logic or earnings. The SP is only supported by HYPE and HOPIUM. WAKE UP AND BOOK YOUR PROFITS TODAY BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. DO NOT BE TOO GREEDY.
"LONDON (Reuters) - Short-sellers are sitting on estimated profits of $3.5 billion from their bearish positions on Tesla shares in the past seven days, as of Feb 23, data from financial analytics firm Ortex showed on Thursday"
$20.23 to get to $750.00
"TSLA's SP may very well start to erode now with little to no end in sight. Why: Too much real competition with many leading EV makers reaching 100,000 in volume in 2022, TSLA 2023 numbers going forward are going to get revised down. GM comes out as a surprise competitor whom may actually be better positioned than tesla (with many partnerships building cheaper cars and they currently hold the title for a best selling EV in China now) ! NIO has battery tech that seems to be better than Teslas, but Tesla's biggest problem is the $25,000 sub car market, you know the main part of the car market for the average consumer. Many EV manufactures are much closer to the goal of a mass market $25,000 < EV. GM is emerging as major competition for Tesla , NIO, XPeng, Li, BYD right now ! GM's stock will go up more than tesla's this year and possibly more than those other EV manufacturers as well. Everyone wrote off ICE manufactures but GM has been making incremental upgrades the whole time. Don't count out ford with the Mach-e either. As far as I'm concerned Tesla will maintain its market share on the higher end EVs but doesn't have a chance against EV competitors that already have sub $25,000 EVs. Tesla makes 4 vehicles out of --> 100 <--- different types needed to replace ICE. Keep in mind that Tesla's rise from 2017-2020 had a lot to do with traditional ICE manufactures only pretending to compete, because they believed Tesla would falter, well fast forward to now and we can see that it is a much different environment with ""everyone working on EVs"""

"Trading below every closing price in the past year, again... mainstream articles about Musk running out of time, expectations of 1q production target miss, every borrowable TSLA BOND borrowed and sold short, valued for perfection... We may be right there... the break down point! Once it drops another $20-30 quickly, a new (needed) equity funding round becomes highly questionable and BOOM - death spiral!"
Can we say squeeze or rally? 
"The inexperience of TSLA-longs can be seen with their comments suggesting they think those short the stock ""have lost everything."" They're telling us they only understand an ""all-in, completely NON-diversified"" position when investing.

"Some of the longs fail to realize some very obvious tell-tale signs.Musk has toned down the necessity of producing 10,000 Model 3 per week. ""Because we need quality builds.""The reason is simply that the reservations are dropping at an alarming rate. It would make no sense to waste money on yet another production-line that would never be used. There will never be demand for more than max. 5,000 Model 3 per week. Even that many is a stretch and the car will never be profitable!Musk has claimed that there are not batteries enough to build more than 25,000 Model S and X combined per quarter. The real reason is that demand is fading as well. Jaguar and AUDI are about to release newer and better cars, made in production-heaven by companies who puts giant networks, massive funds, pride and many, many years of knowledge and knowhow into it. Porsche and Mercedes to join later.Let's face it. The Tesla fad is over. It's over Elon!"
"Musk, and Tesla directors are throwing TSLA shareholders under the bus, while they individually invest and pump cryptocurrencies, using Tesla's cash on hand."
What a discount buy buy buy
The only reason Tesla keeps going up is not financial but psychological. It is called f o m o: fear of missing out.Now it does make sense because people see the stock goes up and they say I want to join the party too... However the party ends eventually and all the so-called investors will lose so much.Everybody that owns the stock knows that Tesla is a bubble or a big bubble. So It can give you a nice gain but it blows eventually. If you don't realize it's a bubble then don't be in the stock market
The P/E of this stock and NIO will fall back to reality without notice. I have seen this scenario several times in my career.

"I was on a walk with my middle schooler and during dad - son talk, he suddenly told me "" Dad, you know, Elon Musk will be the first Trillionaire in the world"". I couldn't believe he said that and how much he knows about Elon and Tesla. Looks like Kids and youth follow and know a lot about Tesla and Elon. It looks like Elon is going to be the first based on what I started seeing about TSLA spikes and posts from E.E. Many of the investors will be millionaires and billionaires from TSLA. Elon is the only CEO I admire at current times. I bought total 27 in last two weeks, my first TSLA investment. I won't be a millionnaire but I might make half a million if hold it for next 10-12 yrs. Any thoughts?GLTA $TSLA, $GNPX"

Waiting for the action to happen like
"Some people judge a stock by its revenue and earning alone. This is so wrong and that’s why some have difficulties to understand Tesla crazy growth. I agree it is very high but one has to understand the reasons behind it. I will say one word, trust is the word. You trust a company that moves the world, you trust the people behind the company who believe in what they are doing and achieving, you trust in the company culture made of innovation, you trust it, that’s a reason why some stock may seem crazy. Innovation and breakthrough can make a rocket."

Tesla recently raised 5B$ through a share offering. 1.5B$ of those are going into buying bitcoin rather than investement in the core business. It means that Musk is looking for a better return from BTC than EV.What does that tell you of the high growth story of tesla?

This will go back to to $900 tomorrow. trust me.
"Dusaniwsky said Tesla short sellers lost more that 40.1 billion in 2020, nearly six times the losses they endured betting against any other stock in the market. Not only Tesla a bad stock to bet against in 2020, it was the single best-performing S&P 500 stock of the of the year gaining roughly 700%. Tesla was by far the worst short in the market in 2020."
"Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained his Neutral rating on the automaker and increased the 12-month price target to $950 from $715. The analyst established a bull case target of $1,250 upping it from the previous $1,000 target."
With Bidon winning the election and his love for renewable power and the entire world predicted to be 90 -100% run off renewable energy by 2050. I think Tesla is miles ahead of the game on this tech sure people might have other great ideas but Tesla will always be the big dog and it’s definitely not going anywhere anytime soon.

"IF TSLA went bankrupt today, what would it do to the share price?"
Model S sales down Model X sales down Model 3 sales (outside China) down Model Y is new. So they lumped all China sales with the Model Y to hide the declines. Tesla is not Enron but they are far from transparent.

The Max pain is $440, with 3x as many puts as calls. What does this all mean? I have no idea, but I think it means that lots of contracts are in the money and those contracts will be exercised this week. The recent run up is likely due to the purchasing of shares to cover these contracts? While the massive bets against the stock likely mean we are in for a wild week. Any option experts out there have any idea what these crazy numbers mean for real?"
Looks like poeple are using tesla stock as a hedge against inflation. Noone wants cash when feds prints money ever day lol.
"Blood in the water and the inverse of engineering earnings.Most successful startup enterprises find a niche product or service to generate cash and build forward with more profitable items to add to their foundation.

Starting up maybe only if billions more are hacked by dilution. 2018 is about the end of the line for the old pay book. The promise of building additional cool stuff as a financing tool to stay in business, not so much any more.

BUY THIS DIP GOING TO 800 TODAY BY THE CLOSE>>>>>>>ELON HAS MADE GREAT INVESTMENT IN BItCOIN AND HAS ALREADY MADE 50 PERCENT RETURN>>>>>CATHY WOODS SAYS SHE NEEDS TO RAISE PRICE TARGET BECAUSE OF TESLA AUTONOMOUS NET WORK THAT IS COMING THIS YEAR
"I hate to rain on everyone's parade, but the only reason that Tesla reported a profit of $250M was that they increased their current liabilities by $750 M, which means the are still running the American corporate gambit of covering their shortfalls with borrowing. If they had had $500 M more of revenues, they could have paid their bills and broken even. Forget the $250 M of bond debt coming due, how are they going to pay off the $10.8 BILLION of current liabilities?"
"I can't believe how many of you are getting this wrong.Previously:$49k = $35k base + $9k (Long range;RWD) and $5k (mandatory premium package; Glass roof, ect...)Now you get....$44k = $35k base + $9k Mid range (smaller battery; RWD) and no mandatory premium package.Nothing changed other than then new configuration. All they did was charge you more for a smaller battery, but not require a premium package (which by the way, is no longer available - you can no longer buy long range w/RWD)IMO, this could turn into a brilliant move and get more buyers to move up market to lock in $44k option with full tax credit, instead of waiting for $35k with partial credit. Underestimate Tesla at your own risk."
Don't let the shorts get in your head with the overvalued card. Look at CMG for heaven's sake.
"Ha - Tesla cutting prices again. Their 2021 ""profit"" will come from carbon credits and Bitcoin - not from car sales, insurance, power or any of their other unprofitable sectors. Look for Elon to ""put a good face on it"" by hyping (or should I say re-hyping) ride-sharing, FSD, semis and all the other pre-hyped stuff that has never materialized."
"Wait for the earnings...not only demand is not there; even if there was demand, the factory has been closed for a month and another month to follow. Of course, EM will spin his way; but reality is too harsh."
"Barrons headline: ((( Tesla Cuts Prices In China. That Could Be Bad News for NIO, Li, and XPeng )))The logic is irrefutable. Tesla is forced to cut prices but somehow this hurts the competition.BTW the article is just filler. Almost no facts. The price cuts are not identified."

"It's not a bubble and retail doing most of the buying. Retail's too scared to buy at these levels and most buys were of massive size. I'm long and the movement literally seemed other worldly to me. I got queasy. And .... the day's volume was way above average. So who's buying? Smart money on Wall Street and those with the connections to know about it and gamblers who will see they made a good decision. But qualifying this movement as a result of hype is a fantasy. There's a good reason for these increases. We just don't know what they are - yet. So just chill and observe but don't short because if you do, you will cry."
WHERE IS MY MONEY ELON & CATHIE?!
The stories now fade quickly.
This may be the easiest stock in history to trade....
$1000 by mid year.
"Tesla's maybe someday story stays alive. Next model will save =the company since demand is so low for the existing models.

There is a $2.6 billion cash shortfall right now. On November 7, the total number of Musk + $TSLA + SolarCity lawsuits we identified was 324. On November 27, 420. By December 7, 441. Today, we have identified over 500. We've found 505, to be precise. And counting...But worry not my friends next year or next model"

"Any guesses the price will drop back to $611 by Fri like it was last Fri morning. If so, we might term this the ""immaculate week"" or maybe ""last gasp""."

"Goes up every day So this goes up everyday and the people shorting this keep screaming that it's going to crash. When do you stop? When do you run out of money? When do you go to another stock or board? I do not understand. I am not making fun of anyone in the butt if I was a short I sure wouldn't keep telling people that I'm shorting because they will all know that I'm slowly going broke. If there are any shorts please enlighten me as to how you think. Again, not ridiculing just trying to comprehend. I don't want anyone to lose any money, but for now anyway, it looks like this is a Bad Bet. I would think you would wait for a down day or two and then jump in and short a stock and not keep saying you're shorting a stock every day that it goes up. Good luck to all!"
Guys why are you not talking about the energy sector that Tesla is heavily ramping up on?!?! The stock will exceed expectations for sure.
"$TSLA is the next $GOOGL +next $AAPL. Elon Must is the leader of the tech world. SpaceX, Boring, Tesla, he is creating a BATTERY of multi-B conglomerates. If this goes down pre-market, Institutions and Wealthy individuals will get in at these levels. People keep saying Volatile - not sure why. This should be a stable trading day for TESLA. Q3 earnings beat news is already out - leaked in email ;-). Battery Day, followed by Monstrous Q3 numbers, . .maybe S&P Inclusion surprise? Tesla is now the ENERGY company: Automobile (Efficient Energy Dissipation) +Energy Store (Efficient Battery ) + Energy Creation (Mining, + Some sourcing): All of this is now TESLA. Shrewd investors will see that and hold LONG and buy at dips. Likely : $455 - $ 470 end of day. If this dips, folks will start buying at all levels"
Can't deny. The run here has been amazing. I sold out way too soon. Congrats to the longs.
Now musk will use the short seller attack on the share price as the excuse for BK. There's no secondary coming. you heard it here first.
"This is much greater than the 2000 dotcom bubble. A lot of people will be crying when this is over. Guaranteed. I would still not recommend shorting TSLA because you never know when and at what level the bubble will implode, you just know it will happen."
"Fanboys surely remember Sandy Munroe promoting Tesla tech. He threatened to sue a twitter TSLAQ detractor who claimed he wasn't impartial. Today, he admits to investing in TSLA, buying $22K and selling recently at $170K. Strangest is claiming, ""I made so much money"". I guess that is a lot in Detroit where the profits could buy 6 houses, but barely pay for an outhouse in California. Jump to 58:00 min in the youtube.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZ19jzO3_Lo&feature=emb_logo"
Couldn't a secondary offering be done at $220 or so raising $4 billion and put a floor to stop the bleeding? Then the company could focus on Capex as needed and not be squeezing pennies during expansion mode.
The bullish channel at 3M chart held up. Check that. It is $Tsla is headed to $530 by Friday.
if this continues....Musk will be moving to the bottom of the billionaire's list....
Longs are you really serious about your posts. I see nothing but cult mentality when you think a few customers getting their configuration requests for a car they have been in line to get for almost 1 year and will still be another 30-60 days away from actually getting is big news.

"Sam This stock is momentum and moves mainly on news. When it makes smaller moves, then it doesnt become a momentum and will shunned by retail investors."
"Day down by 8%, Days up 3%(?) . the overall trend looks horrible. I told Elon to issue new shares at 800+ and dilute shareholders but that option is now gone. The souffle has less and less buyers."
https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/model-x-weld-seam-cracking.100798/Rushed to market product with the lack of testing is what will ultimately bring Tesla down. The seem is at the gull wing door latch. OTA's are not going to fix that.
"Bitcoin up over $52,000 dollars !!!!’Tesla has nearly doubled its investment into Bitcoin. Tesla just can’t loose !"
I am really hoping this stock keeps climbing and climbing up to new and new highs. It will be fun to short this stock going into the Q1 2019 earnings call.
"Elon is a cool guy so this should probably be the most valuable company on Earth, makes perfect sense."
How many Texans will be ringing Teslas bell for a solar roof and powerwall. And a cool CyberTruck to boot
Does Musk always sound this unsure of himself? He sounds like a teen on the CC.
TSLA announcing the end of the full tax credit if orders aren't in by Monday smacks of a desperate attempt to not nave to disclose on the CC in two weeks that orders are no longer going up. The end of the absurd stock valuation is getting closer
Joey just lifted tariffs. Less money for the US. Less money for jobs. No money left for Tsla. Lmaooooo This aint going anywhere lol 
Next in the news: You buy Tesla and Tesla buys lottery tickets for you and shares the profit. Go figure.

Abandon ship!! This is not a drill!
"I don’t know if shorts and analysts that are skeptical to TSLA actually own Tesla cars or solar at home, I bought a 3 and traded for an X, on order for a Y waiting for refreshers to take effect and the tri-motor cyber truck along with solar on my two homes. TSLA is way ahead on many ways, I am long because I love their products, started low and continue investing, less than 300k now worths 2M, I’m not selling unless other company beats TSLA Products (Cars, semi, autonomous, supercharger network, solar energy, energy storage)"
This is the Last Chance to buy Tesla below $275. But you could also put some puts.
i have never seen anything like this in my whole life
877.42+61.38 (+7.52%)As of 11:00AM EST. Market open. LOL this will end BADLY
tesla forecasted for even bigger growth for 2021. shorts and bashers cry all you want but this baby is just going up. sure there will be dips and slight corrections but no denying this is the future. long and strong
Is good to buy after the open today ? Will end around 4 %?

dubai alone would be a trillion opportunity just with roadster 2. They love fast cars.
"Tesla is headed to the mid to high $500's. WHY !!? Because we counted out GM, F, VW, Toyota and Honda a bit quick i think!. Keep in mind that Legacy car companies did not start to compete with Tesla until this year 2021, before they were still hoping Tesla might fail but have all but given up on that and now and are 100% behind EVs tech. So the competition has really only started this year. When values were calculated for Tesla 2022-30 we all just assumed they would just double their sales for ever! .. or at least until 2030, but that actually seems ""impossible"" now that the sleeping giants of the car industry have awakened. PS. GM, F, VW, and others are outselling Teslas in China, Germany, Norway and the EU. with this in mind we need to be more modest about 2022 - 30 sales and this re calculation will have a pull back in Teslas ""perceived value"" I personally think the Top was. $800-$850 and we will slowly travel back to the high $500 over 2021 as sales figures come in for the EV/ice companies. Assuming that someone who has bought 4 GMs (or F,VW etc...) in a row is going to buy a Tesla are just plain wrong. Legacy car companies currently have 98% of the car market, assuming that somehow that will be gifted to Tesla is also wrong"
Is it on yet ? I still got #$%$ music !!
"- Missed targets.- 175k less vehicles shipped than Isuzu. - Yet company is worth more than the entire automotive industry.Checks out, definitely not a money laundering scam stock."
Base of tesla has been strong around 650 to 660 . It will pop 10% soon and hold next new level.
I will buy more once earnings is out always ranks after earnings and a massive run up glta

I said yesterday it would 740 today and the shorts laughed. They are quiet today.
"Tesla's P/E is 1,633.67 Model S sales are steadily declining in Europe, USA, and China. Model X sales are steadily declining in Europe, USA, and China. Model 3 sales are steadily declining in Europe Model 3 sales are stagnant in the USA. Model 3 sales doing great in China, thanks to price cuts and new lower priced MIC version. The growth in China is also due to the new factory."
TSLA is poised to surge and will be several folds from here much sooner than many anticipated. Elon is transforming auto to smart auto just like a phone a decade ago and smart phone today. And the good news is tsla is going to be evaluated its value like a tech company. It will be very big deal for tsla longs ... very profitable and will change many lives in a very positive way. happy trading and good luck to all.
watch them report 20000 M3s produced in Q2 - or 5000 in the last week and 1250/wk for 12 other weeks.
Tesla is looking real good today I hope you got a bunch￼ I did
tesla been very confused lately.. but then again. it was may or Hine when the stock jumped on the thousands
I’ll hold my shares. Never sell off until I see it hits 1000. No sell No lose.
Don’t let one red day misguide you about TSLA! We have many strong catalysts ahead of us!! Breaking $1000 by March  also For the true TSLA investors who believe in this companies future... after getting scammed like 4x on aliexpress I finally found a legit site that sells quality TSLA Merch... their link is: https://stockjunkies.ca/collections/tesla-tsla
50 week range: 70-900. Seems like we are a lot closer to the top than bottom..
WOW... +30% production. Still CASH BURNING and +750% Stock Performance!! Is this a joke? 
1000$next week
Today is the day I short Tesla...
"There is a yt interview with a young guy his IRA is over $29M from TSLA. and was as low as $2,700. He was a former support personnel at a brokerage firm. In the video he says most of the options being sold are from Market Makers that are doing delta hedging strategy. Look at the 36min mark when he starts talking. video title: Going from $2,700 to $29 million. anyways sort of interesting to hear. check it out."
IMO will finish at $902 eod due to funds still buying up especially on a red day.
I feel sorry for shorts at this point. It’s not looking good for them.

"this pretty much sums up my thinking:""Think about it for a second. Previously, Tesla produced on a five-day, two eight-hour shift basis. That’s 80 production hours per week. The 5,000 Model 3/week objective was set on that basis. Now Tesla is gearing for the same objective, while using 24 x 7 = 168 production hours per week. On the old basis, this means Tesla has found its production line to only be able to produce 2,380 Model 3s a week.""https://seekingalpha.com/article/4163596-tesla-quits-producing-5000-model-3s-week-producing-5000-model-3s-week"

"The drop is unjustified and an opportunity to buy on the dip. GM is based on fundamentals and 100 years of stability. It will prevail and ultimately win. $TSLA makes 2% of the cars in the world and irrational investors are treating it like it's going to take over the auto industry. Wake up, this will never ever happen. They don't have the scale, the experience, the army. $GM, $F, and $STLA can get to the numbers and masses much faster. Invest in these stocks and your investment will be safe and grow. Stay in Tesla and you're going to lose everything."
I am a tesla long but how it trades at 512 right now is insanity to me. I guess people invest 5 years into the future? Well I dont have a crystal ball and i trade according to current situation. Good luck to all longs i guess. You will need it.

people are realizing sleepy Joe is about to destroy the economy.
It's your chance to buy the DIP. TSLA will go back up 900$ in upcoming Days.
Lots of shorties again which means Tesla gonna soar soon!
Imagining internal rationalizations of someone betting against TSLA as it increases 10x in twelve months is something truly amusing.
Tesla's valuation makes sense if you consider the fact that the EVs are installed with money printers that print money for their owners everyday.

"Wood and her team seem to have a ""special talent"" for finding and promoting the MOST over-valued speculative-bubble-stocks in this market, and Wood's ""worship"" of the con-artist Elon Musk is particularly troublesome. If Wood can't see that Elon is an obvious fraudster, I question the rest of her abilities at recognizing honest hardworking scientists, engineers and business people making real progress with technology.Understanding how Musk is a con-artist is just a matter of looking. Take, for example, his introduction of ""solar shingles"" when he was trying to use Tesla's stock to bail out the bankrupt SolarCity (saving his cousins and himself from losing millions). The solar-shingle roll-out was Theranos-level fraud. There was no product, no research and development; it was a mock-up of fake shingles (on fake houses -- all done on a Hollywood movie studio set); there was NO energy being generated by any of the tiles, yet Musk stood in front of the crowd explaining how all those roofs around them were generating energy.Or look at Musk's claim -- way back when the stock was under $400, pre-split -- that he had the ""funding secured"" to take the company private. The CEO of a multi-billion dollar company telling millions of followers on social media a complete lie just to juice the stock price -- and the Board and shareholders didn't boot him out after that nonsense?!Or even consider how Musk seems compelled to lie about relatively little things -- and can easily be caught in those lies -- such as the defense he used for calling Unsworth a ""pedo guy""; Musk claimed the term ""pedo guy"" wasn't any insult suggesting one was engaging in certain criminal sexual behavior, but that it was a term, common in his native South Africa, that just means ""creepy old man."" People in South Africa reacted, ""Say what?"" -- it's a bald-faced lie that the term is such an insult in South Africa.Or look at Musk's statements about the bankruptcy that almost happened when Tesla was trying to ramp production of the Model 3. Musk claimed, after the fact, that Tesla was ""single digit weeks"" away from bankruptcy during the Model 3 ramp -- the problem is, this ""single digit weeks"" from bankruptcy never showed itself in the company's SEC-filed financial statements; they always showed they had solvency out about a year or more. Their auditors never required any ""going-concern"" warning with their audited statements. The only conclusion: there are two sets of books and Musk was aware of a bankruptcy risk being just days away, while the other set of books -- provided to the SEC and public-investor -- showed much better solvency.Or just look at the bovine excrement Musk pushes to SpaceX investors -- it's too long of a topic to discuss here, but The Common Sense Skeptic has made an excellent video series (available on YouTube) that debunks the sort of nonsense Musk spews while promoting SpaceX.Musk is a con artist, plain and simple. While that doesn't mean the entire company of Tesla is like a Theranos, it is very likely similar to Enron's type of fraud. Enron did approximately $80 billion of legitimate business a year before its bankruptcy; it was a relatively small amount of accounting fraud at the top -- which hid the true financial condition of the company from shareholders -- that brought the company down. Tesla is a real company, just not a profitable one. While it has shown losses for most of its life, I see enough evidence to conclude those losses were actually a lot LARGER than have been reported; and those quarters of ""profitability"" that got the company into the S&P 500 were all just an accounting fabrication.Silicon Valley start-ups have a saying, ""Fake it until you make it."" It's essentially an admission that ""lying"" is OK while you're trying to build a business. That can work with some technology companies because the profit margins in certain technology companies can be so high, a company can actually make up (and permanently bury) for its previous lying while growing the company. I think Musk has used this ""fake it"" strategy with Tesla -- the problem is: Tesla is a CAR company, with low margins; there is no high-margin pot-of-gold at the end of its growth-stages. My conclusion (looking at a lot more evidence than the few items I mention here): Tesla is a house-of-cards with massive losses ""hidden"" using accounting tricks. (I actually suspect SpaceX and The Boring Co are being used in ways similar to the way Enron used its ""SPVs."") Ultimately, I expect it will implode like Enron did. $TSLA"

I’m new to trading and I had tripled what was in my bank account but now the stock is dipping and I have no clue what to do.. if you have an advice I’d love to hear, I want to hold for at least 5 years but I’m not sure Tesla will be anywhere close to 600 by then."
What is more riskier - bitcoin or Tesla ?
"Not sure how anyone could be shorting such a great story, with most innovative tech on earth. TSLA is down 20% from ATH with earnings a month away and Elon said sales are looking good. Yes TSLA is expensive by most measures but they are leaps beyond their competitors. Small comment by Elon yesterday - the smartest people/students in the world want to work for us and SpaceX. This why they are above the rest, smartest people are all there, very simple."

For a company that produces 500,000 cars a year? $800 bn is roughly one third of the gnp of the United Kingdom. It is more than 60 times the value of Renault. With $800 billion you can buy every single uk bank, HSBC LLOYDS BARCLAYS NAT WEST. And guess what? You will have only spent about 25% of the value of Tesla."

"Tesla loses money on every unit sold, but that's OK, they're going to make up for it in volume."
"he always seemed high when he did he presentations, now we know"
"that is the reason why TSLA trades greater than GM. it has nothing to do with Elon, Tesla, shorts or longs... there are algorithms to jack volume when this stock should crush down 20% in a day... there's algorithms to move it around when volume drops. 5 million shares per day are from this algo on QUIET days... when we saw the 20m share days... the algo was 80% of that."

Mutual funds have to have a total of $80 Billion of Tesla to mirror with S&P 500 and this is a fact. That is why all those funds are trying their best to short in order to buy it cheap. But there is time frame and they are finding among themselves while they have no choice to buy at the end. So Keep accumulating because soon it will be $1000 and you all will follow my posts more closely... Cheers
Looks like game over folks. Cathie will HAVE to start selling if she doesn't want to go under
I have a theory that current investors of Tesla also have moderate to large exposure to BTC. With BTC correcting nearly 25% off its weekend high it is very likely that their investment portfolios are down double digits. If either of these assets fall further there may be a tidal wave of selling.
"Tesla 8-K Shows Tesla's Chief Accounting Officer, Dave Morton, Has Resigned $TSLA"
Why does Tesla need to buy Bitcoin to accept Bitcoin as payment?
"Tesla still hasn’t seen the full force of competition yet folks.“North America saw 15 (EV) launches last year, but 64 are planned for this year.”“Around 65 new EV models launched in Europe last year . . . 99 scheduled to hit the market this year”"
"Those who think the SEC will offer another deal to Musk are dreaming:1. The first offer from law enforcement is usually the best; the negotiation power is all one sided. Tell me what leverage Musk has over the SEC to try to get them to “ sweeten the offer”?2. This is a very high profile case. The SEC gave Musk an out. He chose to say No. You really think any investigator on the SEC wants to be known as “ giving in “ to Musk? Think about it, the SEC is no different from big companies.. political and positioning battles occur all the time as people grasp for a higher ring on the ladder. Zero chance anyone on SEC wants to be labelled a weak SEC official.. they gave careers to think of too.3. You can be sure the SEC has talked to several of the departing executives.. who knows what else they find? Electronic emails and records are all there for them to piece together a wider picture. Musk spat in their faces.. let’s just say the DOJ will have lots of time and they can access info from the SEC and even note. SEC is tame compared to DOJ... 4. Think of the pressure the CFO is under. He even sent Elon about 20 minutes after the infamous tweet.. completely blindsided.. he knew the implications and was trying to do major damage control on the situation by working with legal to send out something for than a two line tweet. There is zero chance the CFO of a publicly traded company ( or private for that matter) is not aware of a financing matter. Just doesn’t happen if the deal is real and legit!"

"I need your opinion please. I am trying to justify buying Tesla at today's share price because I knew about when it was only $8 ps 10 years ago and did not pull the trigger. But here's the thing I think, since no one thinks it is a big deal that Apple is up 38,405% (by my calculations) in the last 10 years, why do people find it difficult to understand that Tesla is up 16,220%? I know the financials are completely different between the 2 companies, but hey, if Apple can be up 38,400%, why can't Tesla? TSLA still has a long way to go to catch up to AAPL....yes?"

"In the latest delivery report released on Thursday, Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) beat most analysts' delivery estimates by handing ownership over to about 88,400 customers in Q1 (Form 8-K filing is here). This was, as expected, a record for any 1st quarter. It easily beat 1Q19 since Model 3 deliveries did not begin in Europe and China until mid-February last year, so Tesla's numbers benefited this year from worldwide deliveries of Model 3 for the entire month of January and early February.However, the ratio of vehicles built versus delivered in the quarter was the worst since 1Q19. While Tesla indeed delivered 88,400 units, it represented 86% of the total production of 102,672 vehicles resulting in a surplus of 14,272 units. Combined with excess inventory from prior quarters, Tesla's unsold inventory spiked to 26,961 units, an increase of 112% from 4Q19.First, we can see the huge increase in unsold units that soared 120%. Part of this increase occurred in China in Jan/Feb where Model 3 deliveries were 83% of production (5,487 deliveries vs. 6,583 units produced. We are still a few weeks away from verifiable March numbers). Europe also appears to have ended with a large surplus inventory. During the quarter, seven ships transported units to Zeebrugge, Belgium with a few continuing on to Southampton, England. TeslaMotorsClub.com member Troy does an excellent job of pulling verifiable data together to track most European sales. For Q1, his spreadsheet (here) shows 22,728 deliveries which are almost identical to 2019 at 22,759. Norway and The Netherlands have been replaced in the top spot by the U.K. This may not account for other smaller EU markets. But if each ship carried an average of 4,000 Tesla vehicles, we can see that a good portion of these unsold units is probably sitting in Europe, waiting to be delivered to buyers in Q2 due to the coronavirus shutdowns in many of those countries.Second, in the press release last week, Tesla oddly chose to combine Model 3 with Model Y production and delivery figures. Some would think they did this to hide relatively low figures for Model Y out the gate. But if we look back to 3Q17, in the above chart, Tesla had no problem reporting just a few hundred cars in Model 3's initial quarter. It would seem Tesla is actually trying to mask the severe drop in Model 3 global sales which were the worst in a year since Q1 2019. That number last year was unusually low for several reasons. First, 4Q18 marked the end of the full $7,500 FITC in the U.S. which pulled Q1 sales forward into Q4. Second, Model 3 deliveries in both China and Europe did not begin until about halfway through the quarter in mid-February. This, of course, made 1Q20 deliveries look better in a YoY comparison.It has been and still is my belief that moving the introduction of the Model Y forward to March from later in the year was due to the slowing of orders for the Model 3 and to fill a drop in revenue that Tesla has known was coming in the first half of 2020. This became very clear last year when total U.S. revenue dropped $2.2 billion from 2018 levels."

"so the touch screen would not last as long as the car,it sounds like we will find out more about EV ownership,it aint going to be cheap.My ICE is 2003,I have just one repair-power steering !"
So many thought TSLA would be more stable as an S&P 500 stock. That is wrong. TSLA should be even more volatile. Think about it. Indexes just took away from available shares. So the SAME number of traders are now trading fewer available shares.
Combined Tesla EV+Glass Tiles+Boring+SpaceX+Neural Link this is still undervalued.Logically this stock will hit $1000 end of Jan furthermore $2000 end of this year.

"BTW, Other EV companies are not taking market share from Tesla. They will take market share from other ICE companies!!!! Therefore no competition for TESLA!!!! LOL"
"I have no stake in this stock, wish I did. But, where does it realistically go from here? It is essentially valued such that over the next few years it needs to generate as much revenue and net profit as the next 4 or 5 largest car makers combined. That is just not happening. Yes, it is a growth story this year, but the long-term growth has been rather uneven and there is a lot of new competition coming into view. Plus autos are a low margin business. This is not a pure tech company as so many apparently believe. Something like 90% of their revenue comes from low margin manufacturing. Not too sexy. What would the dudes on shark tank think if Musk pitched this business at 35 times revenue and 1300 times earnings? Insane stuffNot sour grapes, just been around a while and know this cannot hold this valuation long-term, something is going to give at a certain point..."

"200 day moving average is still under $400/share. An indication of how fast this stock has climbed.It's also relevant to Musk's 2018 option grant. He as a way to go to earning all of the 12 option grants but, it looks likely he will soon have earned the first 8. The 8th requires annualized adjusted EBITDA of $14.0 billion. There's a chance he will have that award with Board certification after the 4th quarter earnings release.Even if the stock drops from here, the past momentum makes it likely TSLA will soon all of the market cap requirements for future awards as the top level is only $650 billion."

"For those who believe that $TSLA is a profitable company: (simple accounting method)1. GOOD accounting practice aka conservative approach (all the auto companies):- Expense all the items via COGS & SG&A that are related to a company's sale including cash reserve for recall/malfunction parts/warranty claims proper calculation on depreciation for manufacturing arms/machines/old model parts write down receivables that are 90 days old or on repo/collection status set aside legal expenses associated with claims from vendors/customers/governments2. BAD accounting practice aka aggressive approach ($TSLA, start up/tech companies):- DO NOT expense the items on #1 and capitalize them by putting them in assets as ""CAPEX - Capital Expenditure""- Once a stock price gets super high, write off bad debts/old model parts/warranty claims as ""one-time"" charge as they are not related the ""current"" production line.- Raising Billions of dollars to inflate the balance sheet via stock sales which don't show up on liability section- Start adding non-related business/investment into the company so it confuses the company's shareholders, analysts, accountants and regulators.Which one has the long term value? You don't need an accounting degree to answer this."

"Most likely short term scenario: price goes to $900. Elon then announces another split. Stock goes to $1,000 pre-split on the news, 5 for 1. Then he issues another $5B in stock (because there’s actually a Tsla stock shortage now that institutions have to buy and hold due to S&P). Then the share price splits to $200 without a decrease to accommodate the $5B offering. Elon gets the cash for R&D, and the shareholders get the returns. Easy peasy."

"Tesla crash in Fredrikstad, Norway. The driver of the Model 3 ""braked hard - with no response"". There are no brake tracks on the site. Police will investigate. $tsla $tslaqThese cars sound incredibly safe! I want to get one to drive my kids around in. Yes, it's risky, but it's worth it to be a part of something. Remember all those magazines that called Elon Musk a ""visionary genius"" after he got the hairplug surgery? THAT'S why you buy a Tesla, not for safety."
"This is a bigger cult than I ever imagined. Most of you people could care less about saving the environment, you all just want to make a quick, unearned buck. I can't stand MUSK's vision for the future. Living in a digital world is definitely not what I want to do. I am not on fb, twitter or any of the other social media muck holes. Social media platforms are low grade digital ghetto's where the dregs of humanity congregate to alternatively commiserate or flaunt their pathetic lot in life. Full self driving where you play video games instead of enjoying the driving experience is an anathema for me. Bitcoin is a freaking ponzi scheme and Tesla is overvalued, not just as a company, but as an idea. I am neither on the side of the wall street coke boys. I neither own nor have shorted TSLA, I just can't stand the future the Electric Messiah is attempting to create. Call me a Luddite. At some point, the younger generation is going to be in a world of hurt because you all want to have someone else do the work for you. Guaranteed income? Then who will be working at the grocery store or deliver your meals? Who will fix your car? Who will build them for that matter? Our society is falling apart, pusing toward a socialistic utopia, but will that work? Sadly no. Will my ranting stop the ""progress"" Nope, but remember this. Societies downfall starts will excess. And I will continue to root against the digitization of the society. Have a nice day."
"When the weather improves in the spring, can we finally expect to witness the coast-to-coast full autonomous trip, proposed in early 2016, promised to occur in 2017? One would think this rudimentarily task would be a mandatory predecessor to unleashing a hoard of robo-taxis upon the unexpecting masses, thus increasing the value of all Teslas produced since 2018 by 3-fold. ...or does Elon get a pass on this."
"Uncle Joe Pro EV, can’t hold TSLA down much longer"
IT WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME FOR APPLE TO COMPETE WITH TESLA. HONESTLY NOT A GOOD LOOK FOR A PREMIUM BRAND LIKE APPLE TO DO A DEAL WITH A DEFINITELY NOT PREMIUM CAR BRAND. AND THATS PUTTING IT NICELY. TESLA DOUBLING SALES THIS YEAR AND EXPANDING RAPIDLY. APPLE IS MAKING A MISTAKE HONESTLY.
Way back when Amazon was under $100 everyone screamed overvalued not making money selling books they will never de thrown Barnes & Noble I panicked and sold at $450 happy with my $350 profit. Biggest mistake of my investing career. I learned from that which is why I won’t sell TESLA It wasn’t hard to own Tesla way back when at $38. $100 and $180 a share 1000 shares was easily a part of any well seasoned portfolio. And today with 5 times the amount and 1000% rise in price well this has made up for all of Amazon. I’m getting that same Amazon feeling of sell sell now I’m firmly in the camp that TESLA is in it’s early stages selling now would be like selling Amazon at $450

Other models (S and X) collapsed.Same is happening in the two largest markets outside the US (China and Netherlands) when you look at January sales.In the Netherlands, the drop between December and January is something like 99%.In China, the virus might explain and the heavy competition from local EV manufacturers.So why this January seasonality ?"

Just as the most recent crop of pre inclusion call buyers got KILLED by the massive IV drop and calls went to either ""worthless completely"" or worth less MUCH less than they were purchased at, History will repeat itself again.

The Tesla train has long gone. Get into Nio. Tesla is overvalued in my opinion. The market valuation is just unbelievably high. Approaching a trillion dollars in market cap. Buy Nio and get in while they’re still cheap.
"Even if these numbers are true ( they are) what a 20X overvaluation - party on Garth, we'll be back above $2000 again on Monday ! Tesla is a bubble. It's a car company first and foremost. Credit where credit is due - after 17 years of hard work the company sold 500,000 vehicles last year. Odds are that they will sell more cars than that in 2021. For kicks, let's give them credit for 1 million vehicles sold in 2021. At a price of $40k per vehicle that gets you $40 billion in sales.As I sit down to write this article, Tesla's share price is $771. Using 1.1 billion shares fully diluted outstanding, that's a Market Capitalization of $848 billion."

Instead of talking smack be grateful if you made the gains and let it be a teaching moment if not. NOBODY can predict the market. I am way up in mine but as an honest and real person I've made mistakes in the past and lost. Anyone who says they have not is a liar. So kudos for the gainers and hopefully in next dip some can buy back in.It's funny reading here......I'm probably only one of a couple women here with a voice of reason. But I can tell you this.....I have a fantastic time visualizing in my head the smack talkers.......what they look like behind their worn out keyboards in real life........its very entertaining.

That's still ~ 40 people.""Elon, but what if you are wrong. What if it's 1 in 5, not 1 in 1000? That would be 8000 saboteurs.Can you handle that many?"

"Friday was another great day for Telsa where it jumped $60B in market cap, which ended a week in which its valuation grew $152B USD, or in other words the value of Boeing and Ford combined.But this isn't the largest bubble of a generation, for as the Robinhood boys know, traditional models on Tesla are all wrong. Looking at things such as Tesla's earnings, revenues, EBITDA, etc is for senior citizens.Instead, a better measure is a percentage of total annual U.S. GDP of ~$21T USD, because it is clearly the best company in the country. Tesla is the USA, and the USA is Tesla.For uber-bulls, however, how about a reasonable multiple of total global GDP of ~$142T? Say, a modest 10x, which brings you to a very defensible $1.4 quadrillion. This is my favorite valuation. And I think is very doable in the next five years. Because, you know, if Tesla takes over the world..."
"Upside possibilities: to reach a price of 1000, Tesla shoulda) 1000% increase of earnings to justify a multiple of 150b) increase of number of vehicles to no less than 15 million units per year (from existing 500k)c) maintain high prices as today and assume no other competitor will launch EV's at the same scale."
best stock to gamble!!!
I'm guessing the reason the stock is up in extended hours is because of the news that Cathie Wood said she bought more today.

Biggest unanswered question is will the SEC hold the board liable for approving a policy to let Elon determine what is material or not before deciding of review of his tweets were necessary or not. Especially given Eon’s statements that he “absolutely does not respect the SEC”. At some point the SEC has to hold the board accountable.

"What's important today is...breaking below $275 and staying there at close. Then we can work on $240 with $275 being the new resistance. To break $240, will probably need battery recall, or rejections of new borrowing that will be required late this summer. I am planning one year to cover at $59.Too many shorts on this board think TSLA is going to fall off a cliff. That's not going to happen with nearly 60% of shares held by institutions. But be assurred they are bleeding some off during these little pops to $286 etc. Also some weak shorts are covering for small change. If you want the REAL $$$, it's going to take awhile.

"Tesla Inc’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) investment in Bitcoin (BTC) is a sign that the automaker has “run out of viable internal uses” of its capital, according to GLJ Research analyst Gordon Johnson.The Tesla Analyst: Johnson kept his Sell rating on Tesla’s stock and maintained his price target of $67 on the stock.The Tesla Thesis: Johnson, a long-term Tesla bear, came down heavily on the Elon Musk-led company for its .5 billion dollar investment in BTC.“TSLA took a large chunk of the cash (i.e., $1.5bn, or ~12.2% of the ~$12bn in equity raised in three offerings in 2020) generated from three secondary equity offerings in 2020, and invested it in a highly volatile and allegedly manipulated crypto currency,” wrote Johnson.The analyst said the company had run out of viable internal uses of capital as it did not invest it in research and development or capital expenditure. As per Johnson, the Bitcoin news was released at a time when the company is facing “negative business developments” and is a distraction.The GLJ Research note pointed to declining car sales in China, quality control issues, delay in the German factory, and the inability to obtain the full $1.2 billion in subsidies in that country as the negative factors.The analyst said in his view BTC is an “environmental disaster” as it consumers as much power as the entire country of Switzerland.GLJ noted the potential regulatory pitfalls of the Bitcoin purchase, which they admitted were unlikely.“We see this as a sign of desperation from a CEO whose company is facing real competition for the first time ever,” said the analyst — adding that even if Tesla were to sell its BTC holdings today, it would pocket up to $200 million in profits “that fall 100% to the bottom line, offsetting any losses in its core business of selling cars.”"
I’ve been in and out many times never fully out. This over a 4 year span I stopped selling at around $1100 presplit. Currently holding 5133 shares and I certainly don’t feel like a big dog but I sure do feel like I clawed and scratched my way to a small fortune.

Cathie Wood's price targets:
So has anyone ever gone to the Tesla investor relations page and looked at the forms? I wonder what it is that every quarter the file a CT Order to have things left out of their reports. Is that common practice? I have not seen that on any of the stocks I invest in. I wonder what it is they do not want to disclose to investors?
how is even possible that Tesla stock is over 700 $ and a company like Ford wich they are from over 100 years in business the stock is 11 $And ford has 1000 times more sales than Tesla This stock will go down is not a matter if will go down but just when. And when this will happen will be below 10$. you won't have time to push the button SELL. THIS STOCK IS FULL OF

Just wondering what you guys would do. I currently have 25 shares at an average price of $341 I was thinking of selling 10 shares if it reached $800. I had bought 5 shares before the split that turned to 25 and i want to take some profits or at least my initial cost.Any thoughts.

"Yep $GS is on the wrong side of the $TSLA trade it appears. They are about to lose big. They are now essentially admitting that Q2 will beat expectations for sure. Now they are projecting the future q by q which was clearly wrong the last q. Of course with new company and disruptive tech, its hard to get to that reliable and stable place quickly. There is brand recognition (the cool factor) and there is demand. tesla is figuring out how to make cars cheaply and meet the demands, and manage the profitability. Mind you they are still increasing their productioncapacity for the foreseeable future"
"Tomorrow, Monday should be an interesting 1st day of post split. We have been up a little over 50% since the company announced the stock split. It wouldn't surprise me if we climb another 20% until the battery day. Once Elon announced a million mile battery (rumor) & it costs less to make the new battery, SP will jump another 20%. The demand for all TSLA EV models especially Model S all electric will be a huge demand.........TSLA ""S"" Model dropped from $74k to $65k. Instead of a 400 mile range, it will be 700 mile range. ......TSLA will likely announce EV price slashed due to lower new battery technology to manufacture. Most Everyone will buy TSLA EV over its competitors........most other EV companies will be bankrupted. Q3 Earnings report on October 28th. Another SP jumps expected. The S&P inclusion could take place probably in late October, after Q3 Earnings..... All index fund managers are required to buy TSLA shares for rebalancing....another huge SP jumps expected. TSLA is currently in top 10 MC company, bottom 10. The next 10 years will be very exciting for TSLA. I predict TSLA to surpass AAPL in 10 years. Remenber is (12) different companies in (1). The AI autonomous mini & semi Robotaxi will be colossal successful when the like of Taxi, Uber and Lyft around the world will go under.

"Aug 10QAccordingly, we expect to achieve a rate of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of 2017. We expect to further ramp to a rate of 10,000 Model 3 vehicles per week, and an annual Tesla vehicle production rate in excess of 500,000, at some point in 2018.Nov 2017 10Q Based on our current progress, we expect to achieve a production rate of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the first quarter of 2018, although the precise progress of the ramp is difficult to predict given that our production growth rate is similar to a stepped exponential, so there may be significant rate increases from one week to the next. In order to optimize the incremental improvement of our automation processes and the efficiency of our capital expenditures, we will implement the capacity to further ramp production to 10,000 units per week only after we have achieved a 5,000 units per week run rateFeb 2018 10kBased on our current progress, we are targeting a production rate of 2,500 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the first quarter of 2018 and 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter. It is important to note that while these are the levels we are focused on hitting and we have plans in place to achieve them, our prior experience on the Model 3 ramp has demonstrated the difficulty of accurately forecasting specific production rates at specific points in time. We are systematically addressing bottlenecks and adding capacity and resources in places like the battery module line where we have experienced constraints, and these actions should result in our Model 3 production rate significantly increasing during the first half of 2018. In some cases, we may not achieve the manufacturing labor efficiencies until we ramp up to fully automated manufacturing lines, which may take us longer than anticipated. In order to optimize the incremental improvement of our automation processes and the efficiency of our capital expenditures, we will implement the capacity to further ramp production to 10,000 units per week only after we have achieved a 5,000 units per week run rate."

"With people ignoring Demand supply ( Elon launching Standard range after saying it not worth as range is just <250 mile) is clearly problem on Demand side Tesla seeing.Market can celebrate but more they ignore bad news and valuation worst outcome at end. May be I won't benefit and lose $100K at end but I am not worried about that. I may not good at making money but I know how to recover once go in loss. It take month or two but will recover it. Lot of people will not able to. Once recover I get more greedy and get stuck eventually. Eventually I will learn how to control my greed. If I started with $2k risk and double down as it go up I would much better shape. Not saying I won't recover. This stock going 50 up daily. If it just go down 75 in 1 week, I will in profit."
This FRAUD car company has been up 11 straight sessions.. WHAT A JOKE. It will NEVER meet these valuations. It should have never been put in the SP..
This company gets purchased when the bond holders take their 50% haircut along with ordinary creditors and someone can use their $10 billion to fund operations going forward. Might be a buy for GM or Ford. Chanos is going to have the last laugh on this.
I don’t want this message to look like I’m hating on Tesla because I really don’t I think it 100% deserves to have the valuation it does but what annoys me about this stock is whenever anyone starts off in the stock market the first stock they buy is tsla and they are getting so good gains now I’m not jealous I feel like that’s going to be there expectation for every stock down the line look for an insane valuation on any company that has a some what of a good future

"Are electric cars more likely to catch fire?The simple answer is probably not. Chances are they might even be safer, though it's tough to say that definitively.""The propensity and severity of fires and explosions from ... lithium ion battery systems are anticipated to be somewhat comparable to or perhaps slightly less than those for gasoline or diesel vehicular fuels,"" according to the results of an in-depth investigation into the relative fire risks of the two types of vehicles conducted by Battelle for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration last fall.About 174,000 vehicle fires were reported in the United States in 2015, the most recent year for which statistics are available from the National Fire Protection Association. Virtually all of those fires involved gasoline powered cars. That works out to about one every three minutes.Tesla claims that gasoline powered cars are about 11 times more likely to catch fire than a Tesla. It says the best comparison is fires per 1 billion miles driven. It says the 300,000 Teslas on the road have been driven a total of 7.5 billion miles, and about 40 fires have been reported. That works out to five fires for every billion miles traveled, compared to a rate of 55 fires per billion miles traveled in gasoline cars.Can the fire risk for electric cars be reduced?Yes. And Risser and others say that is likely to happen.Research is taking place for new materials that might not only make batteries lighter and more efficient, but could possibly make them safer. ""Gasoline is a very risky material. We have had 130 years of designs and experience to make a gasoline powered vehicle as safe as possible. We're still at early stages of understanding how to make lithium ion batteries safe,"" he said."

"Surprisingly, tsla is still within 6% of the all-time-high, after the bitcoin purchase. I would expect it to contract at least 20% since tsla stock is built on confidence, and this confidence is demolished by the bitcoin move--i.e., it is a claim that the bitcoin has brighter future than tsla since tsla had just recently sold its stocks to buy the bitcoin."
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WANT TO equate TSLA with AAPL and/or AMAZON in terms of share price growth rates from their early valuations …TSLA share price has grown from $5 (Jan 2011) to $880 today. That represents a 67.5% yearly share price growth (compounded) over the last 10 years (2011 - 2021)AAPL share price grew from $3 to $143 = 30% yearly share price growth (compounded) over the last 15 years (2006 - 2021)If TSLA share price were to grow at the rate of AAPL's share price (growth of 30%/year compounded) …. for 15 years …...from Jan 2011 to Jan 2026….starting at $5/share in 2011…we’d see that TSLA share price would grow to $256 (by 2026!)AMZN share price grew from $22 to $3300 = 32% yearly share price growth (compounded) over the last 18 years (2003 - 2021).If TSLA share price were to grow at the rate of AMZN's share price (growth of 32%/year compounded) …. for 18 years…..from Jan 2011 to Jan 2029…..starting at $5/share in 2011…we’d see that TSLA share price would grow to $740 (by 2029!)NOTE: Share price numbers are all split adjusted for all 3 companies …….Conclusion: If you’re gonna claim that TSLA current valuation is fair given that it should be compared to the growth rates seen from AMZN and AAPL then you’ll see that TSLA is way overvalued.

Tesla’s core competency is manufacturing so anything they deem super profitable they can get into and dominate. People see Tesla as a pure car company but they’re not they’re also an energy company and in the near future energy is going to be one of the largest markets. Energy and robotaxi not factored into any walll street valuation model nor do they expect 20 millions car produced/year in 2030. Elon describes Tesla as a hardcore engineering team so sky’s the limit they have unlimited growth.

I told you weeks ago to sell TSLA and buy $XLE $OXY $ERX. Tesla remains way overvalued. Get into oil and gas stocks while you still have tremendous upside. Stimulus is inflationary for the dollar.

"Tesla to Produce 800 million cars?PE is often used as a realistic barometer of a companies value. With an auto producer that PE could be extended to cars produced. For example, Toyota produced 8.8 million cars last year to achieve earnings. Their PE is 9.21. This indicates that Toyota needs to produce 8.8 million cars times 9.21 years of earnings to meet market cap. This total is 81,480,000 vehicles.Tesla produced 500,000 cars last year. Their PE is 1,628 and this is not a fully diluted PE. Multiply the two and the total is 814 million cars. Fully diluted and this number nears 900 million. There is not enough raw material capacity to achieve this in the next 10 years. World auto production in 2019 was 91,786,861. Tesla, at their present margin ratios which would include the sale of regulatory credits, would need to sell every car in the world for 10 years to have a PE similar to Toyota. The Tesla market cap is absurd at best. Buy it now and you will pay a hefty price in the next few years."

Tesla is making a strategic maintenance in its factory in China. Production capacity will increase more rapidly than what was predicted just a few months a ago due to the uglier situation of Covid19 in the US. The 500K cars for this year can still be achieved is Freemont reopens by the end of May. The extra production they are setting up from China will rebalance things.

I really can’t remember any thing quite like this with so much public involvement. Do you think the left coast underestimates the dreadful situation?"

And you would be correct!!!!! So your hearts have all been in the right place, all along. Absolutely no denying it. I really implore you to look at other investment options in EVs: NIO, KNDI, SOLO, just to name a few. Full disclosure: I am long NIO. But that's really not the reason why I post this, so I can lure you into NIO. Follow your heart and get out of this stock.

"$TSLA $QQQ $SPY Catalysts for good and bullish ER next week:1. rapid adoption of TSLA car insurance by current tsla owners: currently 1M + vehicles on the road. with significant discount compared to other insurance companies, its a no brainer for tsla owners to sign up with tsla. 1M x $125 = $125M per month of revenues. That is $1.5B of potential revenues per year. Even if 50% is spent on payouts thats still a cool $0.5B and will keep increasing over the years. Think about that!2. Giga factory 3 in China operational: Will announce that production has started and will re-iterate expected #s by the end of this month. This will begin to address the demand in China and the Pacific at a lower cost/vehicle.3. Revenues and profit/loss will be better than expected. It will once again demonstrate (fud and misinformation from shorts, notwithstanding) that every vehicle they sell makes money (or is profitable). The expansion of infrastructure: giga factories, new service/repair centers, additional charging stations etc etc are capital intensive and thats why the expense exceeds their revenues. However, that should slow down once the China factory is in full, operation = more cars sold = more revenues = less loss or even profits in the next year or so.4. TSLA will also show that even in this tough market where all vehicles sales from other companies are going down, demand for TSLAs still remains robust. This talk about 100K vs 97K sold in Q3 is just utter none-sense promoted by dis-tractors. The number is still record high from Q3 last year or Q2 this year. # likley to go up in Q4 once G3 in China ramps up production."

"I am thinking of starting a gofundme for Pudgy, sounds like he lost his house on this $TSLA gamble."
Name any other company who has a better EV? Can you name another company whose mission is to better the climate? Be on the Right side.
"Keep accumulating!!! TSLA will be $4000 - $5000 a share in 5 years!!! Tesla's EV (2 Trillion), Battery(2 Trillion), Software/FSD Full Self Driving (1 Trillion), Solar (1.5 Trillion), RoboTaxi (1 Trillion). Tesla will be a multi-Trillion Dollar Market Cap Company!!!Btw, the Republican party is the party of Fascism!!!"
Will TSLA test its 52 week lows?

"Tesla couldn't keep up with the market today. The institutions know something and it's crazy retail that's propping up this sideways action. Meanwhile the institutions are offloading. My guess is earnings are going to be a big miss. Credits were front-loaded in prior quarters and they're less and less necessary, meanwhile costs are going up with all of the factory construction and design work. I can only imagine the overtime engineers must be putting in to make the ""exo-skeleton"" Cybertruck compliant because that's what Musk demands."
"Tesla Profitability is depending on scale. Sadly for Elon, he is planning an expansion in capacity thinking that the only EV supplier will be himself. What will happen with all that capacity built when all major competitors will saturate the market with EV, at high scale? Answer: not only zero earnings but huge losses. This industry needs to leverage fixed costs."
"Let’s get this show on the road. Sub $400. Sorry longs, valuation, fundamentals, and technicals always matter."
"What is a taxpayer-subsidized car company really worth that loses billions every year, 10-billion? These battery vehicles also have intense EMF radiation when they are turned on, which if you study, is cancer-causing. Great, now among other things, my car is giving me colon cancer. Sales are great, but they're losing money on every single car they make. He will never be profitable, ever."
"For anyone that has studied bubbles, if everyone is saying it’s a bubble, it’s not a bubble. Only when most, if not all, of the skeptics capitulate and buy in, believing outsized gains are the new normal, does a bubble at risk of bursting take hold. Tesla is still too early in its life cycle. There are still an enormous number of skeptics, as can be seen. I’m holding at least 3 years, possibly 5. There is still massive growth ahead for this company. Once everyone buys in to Tesla’s world changing products and services, only then will I consider selling."
If you look at the options book expiring today... record number of calls above 850 and record number of puts below 840 were purchased by speculators. The big banks will keep the stock between 840 and 850 at closing to maximize their derivatives profits.
Bitcoin just hit the highest mark in history . The stock price has dropped more than 120 points since the peak? It’s the first time in history that TSLA continues to drop in more than 3 weeks. All big Institute are buying. Why this is going down ? TSLA is not target for short because shorts dare not to touch this name. It’s doesn’t make any sense???
This market is making smart people really queasy.
Will go down as the most expensive buzz in history.
Nix on Nike....Nix on TSLA
"Joined WSB and SSA over the last two days. I like it! I'm all in for strength in numbers. In general though, I get more info overall and one can't have to much information. Let's take TSLA to the moon boys! https://qrco.de/shortsqueezearmy"

Trump tweeted (after Elon's tweet) his remark about China tariff was misinterpreted by market & he's in fact expressing optimism about the outcome of his upcoming meet with Xi. After that Shanghai & most other Asian markets turned green & US market future turned greener. Shorts' wish for another market sell-off to cover cheap is denied by Trump & Elon

Elon Musk announces another Stock Split coming in 2021.
- there is no funding- there is no profits in Q3- there is no Model 3 for $35kand - there is no demand for Tesla cars
"Just for fun -->2018 US sales ==== 191,627 *2019 US sales ==== 192,250 *2020 US sales==== 202,274 * Tesla is not growing. They merely expanded into China with a lower cost domestically built car."

"Tesla Stock ExtendedShares rallied 7.8% to 880.02 on the stock market today, hitting a record 884.49 intraday. Tesla stock is well extended from its 466 buy point, according to MarketSmith chart analysis.In the last three days, TSLA stock has gapped up three times. Those stock jumps are seen as exhaustion gaps. They occur after a long run, when a stock opens above the prior day's high. Gap ups are usually a sign of strength at the beginning of a stock's run. But in the later stages of a meteoric rise, a series of gaps could precede a sharp drop.https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/tesla-stock-flashes-climax-top-signals/"

Someone explain why a rational person or entity would invest $60-80 billion dollars to take Tesla private and become Elon Musk's junior partner.

All eyes should be on CCIV on Tuesday. Strong rumors say they will acquire Lucid Motors which will compete with Tesla. I love Elon Musk but this is about making money. If you don’t buy it at least remember to follow it Tuesday because you will see I was correct. Get in before you miss out. 
Remember the split so multiply todays losses times 5

$TSLA is slammed after Wedbush has cut its shares' price by 16%. this might push it downward to below 200. watching how the market will react to this. Also watching this small cap https://smallcapmarket.watch/xrav5
62 MILLION cars sold worldwide in 2020 and Tesla sold a measly 500k. Where’s the market dominance and growth? All these ICE cars need to be phased out before mass adoption of electric. Everyone isn’t just going to ditch their newly purchased ICE car. Electric is no doubt the future but It’s going to be an incredibly slow shift to get there. I don’t have a horse in this race but there is no value here only speculation.

How about $AMZN from $500 to $3400 in three years? Oh, and $ZM from $60 to $588 in 6 months. So, it's okay for any other stock to run but NOT ok when one of their hedge funds gets destroyed from greed."
"Elon should issue more new shares and get more cash. He will need it. Shareholder dilution? of course not, there are many buyers there thinking to buy the ""dips""."
"China market is down about 14% from its peak in the matter of weeks. US bubble market is next. The whole world is heavily intoxicated on debt. Debt based prosperity, right.

Time for one of the hard core bag holders to claim this is bullish because it didn't drop as much as it could have.

The number of vehicles they are projecting is not attainable. Even if they did attain those projections it's not sustainable. This will be a zero growth stock. Best case scenario is they one day hit a projected number and then collapse. Do people realize how hard it is to attain a top ten market share in the auto industry?? Go research the market shares of auto makers. It's nearly impossible to even carve out a 2% market share. Look how many vehicles they would need to sell to get to just 2-3%.
"Almost $3,500 per share .... let met me say that again....$3500 per share.When a bee falls into honey, it don't matter if it is drowning, it keep drinking :)No doubt - Longs have had a amazing run --- Kudos to you.But when Musk kick the bucket --- will you keep drinking the honey? :)"
"It’s amazing how no one seems to discuss Tesla’s Autopilot technology, which is 3 to 5 years ahead of the competition, and could revolutionize automobiles. Huge game changer that could be worth Trillions. And NO media mention?"
It's inevitable that this gaps down as people and tutes trim and take profits. I'd buy back in when it's at least 40% lower than current. Everyone knows this. It's just a matter of when.
Tesla trailing PE went for 1650 to 1350 after just one earing quarter. So valuation will go down with new earnings this year.

So the run up on Monday has evaporated the last 4 days?Imagine that....
The only way to save Tesla is for Musk to show extreme humility and ask the World to forgive his behavior. Otherwise he is done and Tesla is done. BK is very near. MAYBE an established auto manufacturer can take them over after BK for pennies on the dollar and salvage what little they have in the way of name recognition. All other aspects of the company are not salvageable.

"Hmmmm, Google is partnering with Volvo for an EV car. I wonder who Apple will pick? GM? Things that make you go hmmmm."
"Here is a good lesson about Tesla, based on some favorite ""Long Buyers"" comparisons. I have been screaming at my computer screen for a year that Amazon's stock was totally over-inflated, that there was no fundamental support to justify a $1600, 1700, 1800, 1900, 2000 price per share. It took one earnings report for growth to slow (and just a smidgen) and a market reversal to send the stock into a downward correction. In two days it lost 14% of it's over-blown value. It is off more than 20% from its high. Tesla has a similar story in the stock price (nowhere else, mind you), in there is no fundamental support behind the stock price. The valuation is made up, I suppose upon a belief of future earnings. It takes small bad news to send the stock cratering, like rather innocent tweets, and the stock caves 3% immediately. The bonds still loom as a problem, as cash to cover the seems like a drain on existing cash reserves. Another stock offering is inevitable, and soon."
"Tesla is the world’s most valuable carmaker- together the value of almost all other big players in the World. Think about it. Tesla sells 500k cars for the whole 2020 of market big as 62 mil. cars Per year in the World - 14 mil in the USA. It is such a small percentage... Competitors do not sleep. Lets see the Numbers from Europe. Tesla is pressed in Europe by VW, Volvo, Chinese are coming. Same situation in China... Musk is investing like crazy and has overcapacities. This valuation is not justified. Unfortunately, this will take the whole market into a deep dive."

Supply will go way up, demand will increase slightly, but not enough to offset the number of choices we will have in the next couple of years. TSLA can't possibly maintain this share price with such a substantial increase in competition on their doorstep. They need to get aggressive and build airplanes with the same technology used in their cars. Just my thought..."

"Now that TSLA is at 850 and at 1617 P/E i think it's time to consider again the product vs. it's competition. There are many competitor EV cars and trucks now and many more coming that are more comfortable, roomier, ergonomically more sound, offer better customer service and better range. Tesla has great brand recognition but not a great product and I think in 6 months to a year's time we will be thinking of this stock more like a myspace. One of the originals but not the pick moving forward."
Just took a 2nd mortgage on my house and plowed all the money into Tesla. Looking forward to getting rich with all of you.
"Tesla is in multiple, simultaneous, long-term growth cycles and every time there is news of something new, whatever that may be (compact Model 3, compact Model Y, status of construction at Brandenburg or Austin, purchase of land for Gigafactory in Oklahoma, expansion in Shanghai, battery advancements, power storage, a contract with Target [example] to install Superchargers at all store parking lots, the date of production for Cybertruck, etc,) will be a positive catalyst, increasing the value of the shares. There are literally an infinite number of future plus events that make $TSLA a strong and long opportunity for those who have the ability to foresee and understand the evolution of transportation, energy generation and storage. Indeed, it is not difficult to comprehend TSLA creating and producing revolutionary products previously unknown. Long $TSLA (2012)."
Elon currently bragging about Tesla’s LGBTQ quality index rating on twitter. It’s Not like the company is losing $700mm a quarter and a week away from another Moody’s downgrade. Priorities.

"The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on Wednesday asked Tesla Inc to recall 158,000 Model S and Model X vehicles over media control unit (MCU) failures that could pose safety risks by leading to touchscreen displays not working.The auto safety agency made the unusual request in a formal letter to Tesla after upgrading a safety probe in November, saying it had tentatively concluded the 2012-2018 Model S and 2016-2018 Model X vehicles ""contain a defect related to motor vehicle safety."""
Here is the formula for Tesla at 500. 10 year treasuries go from 1% to 1.5%. Then Elon issues some new shares. Then the bulls will be run over by other bulls -- as they all stampede to the exits.
"Since everyone and their mothers are going hot and heavy into electric cars, Tesla is WAY overvalued. I owned it in the past, although would never consider buying it now."
I am wondering how many people bought Tesla on margin in an attempt to maximize their gains and have been forced to sell because of this correction. Someone always falls prey to this. But is this part of why Tesla is dropping so rapidly? Because of margin calls.
"Cost Tesla $200M to move those cars in Q4 to meet delivery estimates, with supposedly no competition."

"Tesla has delivered 500 k cars in 2020 the un-normal year, also Tesla has jumped to an almost 700% since the start of the pandemic of 2020 That is really a unique and an amazing phenomenal. Question here: now can anyone imagine how far this stock can go in normal year of 2021? If we say the stock will jump just 400% this year that will lead us to 2800 after split and in worst case scenario to 2000 which is 250% by the end of this year. I think only crazy people sell this stock, for me, that better than buying gold or crypto. Will hold it forever and sky is the limit of this baby"

"You longs are so scared, will probably stay up all night tonight"
"This message is for any new Tesla members. There is a lot of fear spread on this board by short sellers .. often messages about Tesla falling. For example, there were tonnes every other minute about stock tanking the week after s&p inclusion. It’s true the price was volatile around the inclusion but it rebounded to new highs. I used to get worried about these warnings so much so that I sold once too early and it cost me in fees, taxes and missed opportunity $. Since then I bought back in and gained, but I would have been much much wealthier had I not sold.Summary point is don’t be scared by their warnings. Tesla has a bright future, is lead by a revolutionary genius, and continues to go up despite small set backs here and there. Be strong and hold especially on red days. Don’t give into the FUD by shorts ... it’s a trick, they want your shares at a discount. Remember my words, you will be rewarded "
"The bear case: TSLA is way overvalued due to traditional metrics like PE, price to sales, etc. Rebuttal: TSLA is not a value stock, it's a growth stock, and a hyper growth stock at that. Crowd behavior and growth dictate the fair price of TSLA, not traditional metrics like PE which are irrelevant. It's way ahead of the competition, its EVs are superior in quality and performance, and total addressable market has only been 2 percent tapped. In other words, monster growth is still very much the story for years to come....shorts think because it's below 800 that their dreams are coming true. TSLA down due to rising rates, nothing to do with the company itself. This is a dip to buy, not increase your short position. So enjoy your pocket change shorties...it will be swiftly taken away once the market finds its footing again and rates start to fall back to normal levels."
So Panasonic is going to build Tesla's new battery format. That's interesting. That lets off a lot of pressure from Tesla to mass produce it on their own. Panasonic will probably do a better job mass producing that new battery.
"I know Elon Musk is really smart, so maybe he has already thought of this. Why doesn't TSLA make a public offering of TSLA stock in exchange for bitcoin? Now, there is a really inexpensive way to buy bitcoin, no cash involved. Sort of like Musk's employment compensation.Offer say 100 million shares at the rate of 500 shares per bitcoin (it might have to be more, but I am trying to keep the arithmetic simple). That would ""buy"" 200,000 bit coin. Nice!?If bitcoin goes up in value, this bet is big enough to be a really significant driver of stock value. If bitcoin goes down, so what. It was bought with stock, not cash, so that doesn't really count as a loss does it?"

Tesla is great but it's expensive for most people. You don't see many tesla in Europe and other countries. For this price to be justified you have to see them dominating everywhere.

"subsidiary Waymo announced in its blog that henceforth the company would address its mobility services as ""fully autonomous driving technology,"" and ditch the term ""self-driving.""What Happened: Starting with the fully-autonomous labeling, Waymo’s blog said that its technology is distinctly separate from the driver assistance systems of other automakers that require human intervention.While Waymo didn't name any automaker directly, it has contested the claims of Tesla Inc.'s (NASDAQ: TSLA) full self-driving being at par with its autonomous driving technology before. Waymo said that accurately wording the technology could also save lives. Of late, Tesla has been mired in safety-related controversies, which picked up much more steam after a fatal crash in South Korea led to two people being injured and one fatality.At the beginning of 2020, Tesla faced 14 scrutinies by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for accidents that involved its autopilot systems.Why Does It Matter: Waymo clarified that erroneously branding driver assists as fully autonomous sends a wrong message to auto buyers and enthusiasts. The post suggested that misleading impressions could inflate the ability of the vehicle and result in an unnecessary risk to drivers, passengers, and others on the road.""Unfortunately, we see that some automakers use the term 'self-driving' in an inaccurate way, giving consumers and the general public a false impression of the capabilities of driver assist (not fully autonomous) technology,"" Waymo said.""That false impression can lead someone to unknowingly take risks (like taking their hands off the steering wheel) that could jeopardize not only their own safety but the safety of people around them."""

"my thesis is adding up correctly as i see it. not what the bulls are pounding in these offbeat powderpuff blogs.the market was never ready to support a 50K green car for the masses. those who have a bit more affluence are just dabbling into 100k versions of ev's and the status cars making them purely a speculative purchase. the Karma for example at 130K is a beautiful style, but i wouldn't trust a new technology in purchasing one unless i had millions to burn. 99.9% of americans do not have millions to burn. 85% of all americans cannot get a loan to buy a car that tesla currently builds. that leaves about 15% at the top with over 2 dozen choices. with the embedded toyotas, nissans, hondas, bmws, porches, merc benzs, jags, volvos, and other makers selling to that segment, tesla, karma, the 4 or five other high end want to be's have little shot at gaining the market. tesla will be the first to build, then burst as they are now having a fire sale on their doorstep. market secured!"
Time to move to CCIV. It seems not much upside on TSLA at this point.
"I expect at least $1/share in earnings for the 4th quarter. Analysts have been sandbagging with low estimates. TSLA is very profitable now. And would be even more profitable if it didn't have the cost of the options granted to Musk in 2018.Post your own estimates. TSLA is very profitable now. And would be even more profitable if it didn't have the cost of the options granted to Musk in 2018. This would stop growing if the stock price would drop back down below $100/share. So, considering that and all the cash TSLA has raised, I think TSLA is worth that much. That would be about 30 times what I project for 2021 earnings.None of this matters really, as the stock price is so inflated. The real question is what will TSLA earn in 2022 and 2023 when the competition gets significant?TSLA bulls are expecting great things. But, it's curious. TSLA is not spending very much on R&D nor on capital expenditures in general for a company expected to grow 10 times in sales in just a few years. TSLA's R&D expenses were just a little under $1 billion for first 9 months of both 2019 and 2020.Relative to market cap, TSLA is now spending only about 0.1% on R&D annually. Yet, this is a tech company destined to grow 10 times in a decade?GM's Cruise division (80%+ owned) shows GM's net investment in auto drive along about equal to TSLA's entire R&D budget, yet TSLA has 10 times the enterprise value. Does this make sense?"

"$TSLA missing 2019 deliveries is not news. reason why it was severely pushed in Q1 and Q2. Cowen wants to re litigate history. The fact is Q3 and Q4 are far better than expected and will likely be close to or beat the lower estimates. If you follow Cowen and act accordingly you will miss big moves. Today was just an excuse to realize some profits, but as we all know, ALL dips are followed by rapid RECOVERIES and are just BUYING opportunities. I would be slightly concerned if it breaks below the 7% form recent highs (just technically speaking) when the computer algos take over the selling. $QQQ $SPY I just hope that more shorts have jumped in to short some more...will provide the much needed fire in another anticipated rise from $400+ base....."

What's important is the trend. The trend right now is down, and there is only weak support in the mid $600s. The more major support is in the $400 level. That means in just weeks, this will be in the $600s testing that first minor support. If that fails, there's a huge gap back down to $400. TSLA has a history of dropping as much as 50% or more before recovering, as does many stocks that go up fast.https://photos.app.goo.gl/aq595oDUm213aefY8"
What kind of earnings are we expecting? Storm coming?
Lithium hasn't been produced from clay in commercial quantities before. Mining Analysts say Elon Musk's plan won't succeed. Let's backtrack a few years. Electric Vehicles haven't been manufactured in commercial quantities before. Automotive Analysts said Elon Musk's plan wouldn't succeed. Who would you give the benefit of the doubt to?
"Last year 500k can happen and 2021, it could increase by 100%. 1 million tesla car delivery."
Yesterday all my problems seemed so far away. Abandon ship! I repeat abandon ship!
"Normally when you ramp up production, margins increase. Tesla's margins actually decreased, probably because of all the vehicles that had to be repaired due to the poor build quality. Making more vehicles is not proving to be a profitable venture for Tesla. If not for $401MM in regulatory credit sales, they would have taken a loss on a GAAP basis."
Take a look at the price of GME. The price is what it is because enough of the little guys not only hold but keep on buying. It is called a short squeeze. There are plenty of shorts on this stock. Buy more and hold no matter what and the price will go up. This is only my opinion.
Mute the long messages praising the stock. They are in a huge debt already...
"Some of you have absolutely no idea what will happen if there are no short-sellers left, in a downturn only thing acts as a brake is the short sellers covering, be careful what you wish for."
"A large part of the bullish debate in relation to Tsla's valuation, is that it COULD BE, MIGHT BE the next Amazon, Apple. Just because Amazon, Apple etc etc have done what they have done is no reflection on tesla, and has absolutely no bearing on what tesla's future holds. Judging by sales and increasing debt it may be more appropriate to compare tsla to 'better place, solyndra, plug power' and a long line of others."
Who can pass up these great after Christmas clearance sale prices?
"TESLA WILL HIT 1,000+ BY MARCH. NONE TO WORRY !!! ANY LITTLE HICCUP ALONG THE WAY ONLY TO MAKE IT MUCH STRONGER THAN LATER.BUYING MUCH MORE UNDER 700."
Telsa will fall 3x as fast as it went up before hitting sub $200? Thumbs up if you agree
"Anyone look at the VW ID.4? I know Tesla is better in a lot of ways, but it starts at $32.5k after the $7500 tax credit and it is going to be available Q1 21. I wonder if that is why Tesla is now building the 2wd Model Y."
"Looks to me that Musk will set foot on Mars before he ever becomes profitable with battery operated cars. Selling since it has been one delay after another, a serious cash burn and $billions of government funding down the crapper."
"Other than Kildde, has any other company made accessories or after market products for Tesla cars? https://www.kidde.com/home-safety/en/us/products/fire-safety/fire-extinguishers/for-business/"
"Could GM be an attractive acquisition target because of it's vast reservoir of automotive engineering and manufacturing talent? GMs assets in factories, engineers and know-how could become an attractive acquisition for those with deep pockets interested in entering the EV marathon. That would include AAPL, TSLA and AMZN, etc., all which easily have the financial means of acquiring GM. Those three are all in the race with some hiding their full interest. The company who acquires the GM assets could easily win this race. GM shareholders would give up over 50% of their holdings for a purchase price between $100 to $200 billion. With the present market cap at $60 billion, that would put the price of GM shares at $100 to $150. Imagine the full know-how and assets of GM in the hands of Elon Musk! No one and I mean no one could compete."
"looking at the charts, metrics, insider trading... TSLA has finally topped. 600s are on the horizon."
Prepare for more red numbers tomorrow..
Will tesla be able to service all these cars as they get bigger?
"Can’t use your solar panel, wind power and charging station when the power is down!! Go green? Go home! Oil is staying!!"
Good bye Tesla. Bank O time!
Bidens stimulus includes tax credit for EV cars.
Today I saw 3 Teslas parked on 1 NYC block. We’re talking NYC. No sidewalk charging here or you’ll need a 600ft extension cord. BUT that’s how I know TESLA has won. 3 cars parked on the same block on the streets of NYC. I AM IMPRESSED. and no my model Y was NOT one of them if I found a spot it would have been 4 TESLAS
Tesla has to compete with Amazon and Google ouch.The analyst is concerned over the rising risks from other companies. He said Amazon could have a negative impact on the transportation logistics market and Alphabet's Waymo may hurt Tesla's future autonomous car opportunities.

"tesla as a car company is overpriced. just like Amazon as a boon store is overpriced. tesla is leading the energy and self driving revolution. step aside haters, we bout to make money"
So when does Tesla have to pay the $900 million bond payment?
how'd u like those articles this weekend describing tsla's cluster-plhuck of operations?
"Mark B. Spiegel@markbspiegel·45mBy the way, I've never heard of a company unilaterally closing all its stores without first negotiating the lease terminations or filing for bankruptcy.

Why does Tesla need so many Giga factories if they can not keep Fremont factory busy two shifts per day?Tesla's January BEV market share slipped to 11%. Why would the 11% market share is worth more than remaining 89%?
The Bitcoin network consumes more energy than all Tesla cars combined. Strong support at zero!
$GME games are crashing market as hedge funds are selling long positions to cover margin calls

by reading the comments of longs you can easily understand that we are in the euphoric sentiment phase which will turn in denial soon. dip buyers will push the prices back up but soon the reality will set in and most of them are gonna sell not when they want to but when they have to
TESLA GOING WAY HIGHER. WAIT TILL CYBER TRUCK COMES OUT THEN FULL SELF DRIVE. THEN NEW FACTORY IS COMPLETED. THEN NEW MODEL Y SALES IN CHINA. AND NEW COUNTRIES THEY ARE ENTERING. JUST REMEMBER TESLA IS “THE CHOSEN ONE”

I feel sorry for those who left the party early. You won't be rich if you don't stay long to drink the $TSLAquila.
Even missing by a small number. Tesla will drop around 50~70$ max in the week before climbing to 780$ End of month
"tesla dilutes shareholders in equity raises, not one poster here can deny that, Elon does it often."
TSLA Will rise tomorrow Falcon 9 was a success as was it's pinpoint landing this morning. This is the genius behind Tesla.
Longs to shorts right now
"Im doing a master in computer science and bought TSLA shares for a simple reason. That is, their software. Other companies might produce EVs, but none of them will come close to Tesla's software.People are stating that the stock is overvalued claim such thing because they can only see the EV part and have no proper understanding about the software. The autopilot alone is enough the transform the market haha. So it dont matter that the stock drops. I will hold it even if it drops to bikinibottom and meets Spongebob because I firmly believe that Tesla is the future."
record earnings means record gains
All traffic lights are red but the Tesla traffic light shows green. Don't worry about the train...it will have it's reasons why it's green!

"Why will TSLA model 3 sales drop sharply? Most who booked Tesla, wanted it for ($35K - $7.5K). If these are available only after 6 months, there will be no -$7.5K - which means tons of cancellation."

It may not happen today or tomorrow or next week but eventually those who put good money into this badly inflated stock over the last few days to prop it up will lose a lot.

"Most likely 3rd down day in a row, at least that's what premarket is showing now. If I had shares I'd try to beat the other bagholders out the door. This will be a slow slide accelerating on January 4th. The pendulum has a long way to swing."
"High Demand Stocks Ready for Bullish Gains: VXRT, SRNE, VBIV, IBIO, TSLA, SOLO, QUBT, RIOT & ZOM Based on my analysis, TSLA will break the 700 range come end of January 2021. This is the leading benchmark EV company so invest without worries with TSLA."

"I checked, ARKK alone had added 200k shares of Tesla, that's $156M in 1 day"
Cant wait for another couple EPS miss and pants will be flying off along with the shirts this quarter! Hah!!
"This bitcoin buying is utter nonsense....you don't need to own it to accept payments in it...TSLA could then sell them immediately on the open market....instead he's tied up $1.5 billion in capital that could have gone to R+D, which is about the amount TSLA spent on it last year. Some of his competitors spend 5-10 times as much as TSLA on R+D...and we're supposed to think they won't catch up?? This is a dual red flag on two of the biggest bubbles around."
"Also remember that only 1-2 % of the total amount of shares of a company trade hands on any given day and this trading determines the value of ALL the other shares held.... mutual funds etc etc.This relatively small amount of shares determining the value of all of the shares causes volatility ( big movements in share price ) = stock price easily manipulated in the short term. Large capital investors are slow to react and take a position or change position so consequently won’t effect a stock price until it is clear the fundamentals are exposing the direction the company is moving before they make a change in large positions that move the stock price.Over the long run, and I mean long, like 3 quarters a year or multiple years... FUNDAMENTALS always WIN."

"Ive been holding a long long time and sold half on Friday before it dropped... imo Monday is the key, this could easily start a snowball effect of selling v quickly - all those people who made a killing (like me) aren’t going to want to see it evaporate because they held blindly... on the flip side I do still believe in the company, it’s vision and it’s future! Maybe a pullback will be v healthy for tsla in the long run, setting it up for the next big leg up eventually in future? Let’s see what happens..."
"Good day to pick up more shares of $PCRFY (Panasonic). It is extremely undervalued. $TSLA, $NIO, $XPEV, $LI, $BYDDF are bubbles and will come crashing down soon.

They are extremely undervalued."

"Analysts at JPMorgan said Friday they remained “highly cautious” on Tesla due to its stock valuation, but they raised their price target on the stock to $125 from $105, the lowest among FactSet-surveyed analysts.“While still suggestive of large downside, we do not regard our price target as ungenerous as it actually values Tesla as the world’s second largest automaker by market capitalization, behind Toyota and ahead of Volkswagen despite these automakers each currently selling on the order of magnitude of 20x as many vehicles annually as Tesla,” the JPMorgan analysts, led by Ryan Brinkman, said in their note."

"Tesla $1T+ valuation = $ 2M /car they sale (Which is only business with positive gross margin) = 40 timeNow People talking about Tesla making 10M car. First there is no 10M car market for $50K+ SO he has to bring 20K car.Let's say they reach 10M with average price of $35K. and $5K/car gross margin.their total gross profit is $50BCurrent valuation is 20 time peak revenue gross margin there.Let's say net margin go $2k car, that again hard to achieve but we assume possible. We are talking 50 time peak net profit.Even if you spare another few billions profit from subscription business, they still very very expensive even at peak revenue.All other business, they facing very brutal competition. Solar business they were No.1 now not even No.3Battery business so far all promise and 0 delivery."

"Another confirmation of previous upgrade: Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch was more upbeat, saying he would be ""buyers on any near-term weakness."" Rusch reiterated the outperform rating he's had on the stock for at least the past two years and kept his price target at $451. He said Tesla outlined a ""robust reimagining of battery design, manufacturing and performance,"" including targeting a $25,000 vehicle in three years and a 20-times capacity increase by 2030. Rusch also noted that Tesla's 30% to 40% delivery growth guidance for 2020 is above consensus estimates. ""We are impressed with the ambition of the endeavor and believe this roadmap charts ongoing technology and cost leadership for [Tesla] enabling sales into the entire LDV market,"" Rusch wrote in a note to clients. ""While limited details may weigh on shares, we would be buyers on any near-term weakness.""

"I hope many of you bought the $600 dip......This is a bargain. Understand the motive behind the oil price drop. They are trying to compete with the eventual adoption of EVs. They realize the EVs threat is going to come faster than even they expected. Proof: Tesla continues expansion into China and German factory locations. But here's the biggest IMO: in April 2020, $TSLA will hold their Battery Day event and I expect Tesla to announce their accomplishments over the past year since they acquired several technologies to help improve battery range dramatically. We could see a 30% improvement in range in Tesla vehicles coming out after April and on top of that, we will see a reduction for price to drop below $100 per kilowatt hour. This will be huge. I believe TSLA pps will go from today's low of $600 drive the price up past $1000. The oil sellers realized they don't have much time left as profits will drop significantly for them within 3-5 years as the world will have a massive EV transition. 5 years is what I give all other auto manufacturers to finally have EV models that will also be successfully selling to compete with TSLA to a degree, but this will be a bigger blow to the oil industry....not kill it.....but significant pain to their profits. In the past couple of weeks, you had one of the biggest auto makers announce they are fully committed to EVs more than ever....GM. Oil saw this too and after they had their emergency meetings to deal with a crisis that will start for their industry sooner than they expected, they foolishly decided cutting oil prices will help scramble for as much profits as possible for the few years left for them to take advantage of their monopoly over the auto industry. Buy $TSLA with a target of $1500+ and $NIO to $16+. You will regret missing out today's low of $600 TSLA and $3.00 on NIO. Keep buying and holding."

David Einhorn? Hello? Yes should I short more at this price? Hello?
I'm going to predict that there will be some second-generation Roadsters that will use silver-zinc batteries instead of Li-ion. It's the only way the company can reasonably achieve some of the performance goals that's been suggested the car will have.
Tesla's share of EV sales === Germany = 4% in 2020 = DOWN from 8% in 2019 France = 3% = DOWN from 10% Norway = 5% = DOWN from 20% Netherlands = 9% = DOWN from 45% Sweden = 4% = DOWN from 10% In 2019 over 83% of the electric cars sold in Europe were not Teslas.In 2020 over ~95% of the electric cars sold in Europe were not Teslas.Conclusions: 1.) There is a lot of competition in Europe. 2.) The European competition is winning and Tesla is losing.
future are up really nicely... tomorrow's going to be good for all those calls
anybody looking at TSLA volume charts over the last 5 years or the last year? Looks like there is forming a top...volume is getting really low....which in most cases is a technical sign for tops...less demand>>less volume
"Regarding the long haul (semi) market (and bus markets for that matter) . . . “Electric-powered motors are considered less viable for heavy-duty trucks than for the average passenger vehicle.” Natural gas seems to be the most practical solution as evidenced by the following actual commitments: * “Amazon purchased 1,000 Cummins/Westport natural gas engines for their heavy-duty trucks . . . Amazon has ordered more than 700 compressed natural gas class 6 and class 8 trucks so far” * “United Parcel Service Inc announced plans to buy more than 6,000 natural gas-powered trucks” * Los Angeles County Metropolitan Authority, the largest transit bus fleet, “signed a new agreement for an estimated 47.5 million gallons of renewable natural gas (RNG)”"
"Bargain shopping day! Waiting for more funds to clear, so don’t load up too quick! LoL. BTW: Where is ARK’s Pied-Piper?"
Elon just beat Elon for the world's richest person.Maybe he should use the money he made today to buy up all the Teslas. Drive the stock up further.Snake eating its tail.
OVER VALUED BY 800 BILLION
"Tesla recall is major. If it happened to other maker, would be big news. The ironic thing is that the other maker would know how to handle the matter. Tesla will end up with NHTSA camping out with them and calling all the expensive shots."
I have a feeling Elon and the guys are talking about doing another 5-for-1 split!
Merry Christmas to all TSLA-naires!

I’m going to buy more Tesla tomorrow. Whatever the price I think it’s going way up this 2021 year. It will be the richest company.
"Why is everyone so opposing to Tesla’s Bitcoin investment? If they sell now, they make about 1 billion from Bitcoin already!"
Should we cover now or keep shorting?
Free charging for high priced version of Model 3 is another sign that demand is just not there. Free charging is a long term liability; Tesla still kicking the can further down the road.

"Musk's true colors being exposed in the Unsworth case. Hard to determine an actual financial hit, but it sure isn't positive PR. All Elon needed to do, was stick with his initial (albeit insincere) apology, and this all would have gone away. He didn't even need to pay any monetary damages, as Unsworth wasn't seeking any, until Musk continued to taunt him. However, I'm thrilled that the world is starting to see Musk for who he really is, as many of us ""haters"" (I prefer ""skeptics"") have believe all along. You God is just a human, and not a very nice one at that."

"AAPL sold 11M phones in 2008, and now they sell more than 200M phones.TSLA selling a car is like selling a pack of 50 iPhones (1000$ a piece). Tesla sold 500k cars, that is equivalent of 25M phone sales this year. I am comparing both companies by first successful year and Tesla is already ahead of Apple and will surpass APPL in valuation in future. Now imagine where TSLA would go in 10 years? BTW Tesla has their own factory and Apple outsourced it.There is no cheap android or samsung around to compete in next 4 years. Unlike phones, cars are order of magnitude difficult to make.Can you now understand what Tesla’s potential is? It is just the beginning.... wait for the bigger hockey stick when they start selling software and apps and games in their self-driving cars.You can thank me later..."
"When does TSLA report earnings, in the morning or AH of the earnings date?"
Its funny how people write off a stock after a 3 or 4% drop in a week. That is a normal correction and necessary for the stock to perform well going forward.
"NB: It seems that every time Tesla has a bad day ( loss of 10 or more), the very next day a large premarket order is placed that jolts the stock upward. It may be a good play to but Tesla at the end of a bad down day and then be ready to sell the following late morning or afternoon as the surge peaks. Then again one of these days the plunge may continue and not be followed by a jolt upward."
"The CEO bought own company’s shares instead of cashing out and worked on the production line and sleep on the factory floor with two other private companies making unreal progress. I am betting on the vision, motivation and meaningful effort, progress instead of 5k/wk. bears have only tunnel vision with short sighted"
We already need another split. 3:1 would be nice or 8:1 to put it below $100

"I think it won't be long before you can book a trip to Mars. You pay via Bitcoin. The governments will have long since rendered their money paper worthless. The hi-tech will survive on its own. This is the way of progress. The Covid-19 virus has accelerated this. I now firmly believe in this. Tesla is a great thing and is above humanity. Musk has brilliant ideas. I underestimated it, but I've been converted."
"Investment bankers and fund managers around the world are talking among themselves -- they are concluding that NO ONE has spoken with Musk about financing any deal to take Tesla private. When everyone is convinced Musk lied about that ""funding secured,"" expect the price to crater."
"Ouch, GNPX & TSLA Bulls......Thank you for your understanding & very high IQ. Instead of talking about my 70% long-term stocks that double every year min., Shorts like to talk about my 2.5% IBIO stock or almost another $2M I bankrolled on TSLA so far. Or 4,900% & $100M bankrolled for Genprex in a few years at my $150 PT (with my 620k shares so far). I am not done accumulating Genprex shares especially when shorts borrowed........My TSLA PT is min. ($20,000 in 2030) with my 1,000 shares (5,000 shares after stock split) from my research. I said minimum! The recent catalysts are massive......Even if you didn't get in at $250 & decided to get in last week when SP was around $1,450. That's 1,279% (Or almost 13X at $20,000 minimum in 2030). But, if you are looking for 49X, check out my research/thesis for Genprex. The $150 PT is only (1) of dozen markets. Shorts Can't be too bright if borrowed high interest & losing $18B so far shorting TSLA. We really need them to short more of Genprex & TSLA. Remember our $8.4B & $25B for Genprex & TSLA goal respectively. Keep standing in my way if you dare! $GNPX, $TSLA"

Volkswagen AG annual net income for 2019 was $14.948B, 15 to 20 times higher while being about 1/10 of Tesla's market cap. Might I also add that VW, as of the 4th quarter of 2020, is the world leader in electric vehicles sales. They are also not facing class action lawsuits for batteries and FSD."

"I missed the Tesla run up. Far more downside than up at his point. Since valuations really don't matter, I am going into NIO. The stock is more affordable per share and more upside. Yes Tesla has better tech at this point that does not matter. China is the biggest car market in the world. NIO has something that Tesla can never have in China. That being its a chinese company. The Chinese are very nationalistic and they will support their Chinese companies more than Americans will support American companies. NIO may not do well in America but they will do well in China. Much better in the long run than Tesla will in China. For that, I think its a good investment."

"I'm not pumping at all, I've done my DD a lot on this company. They've already sold the gold mine last week and are awaiting profit results this week which will easily skyrocket this stock from 0.05-0.20 , 5x-20x depending on the figure. This company is also working on a gold backed cryptocurrency that has already been finalized and we are only awaiting the next steps, this is a x100 $1 catalyst by itself. This company is in the process of having it's finances audited through cpa waters, and when complete, this ticker will be immediately uplisted to higher tier otc. The 2020 financials and quarterly revenue is 5x higher than ever before which is a multiple cent increase x3-4 by itself. This company has multiple other mines, including a lithium mine that can provide resources for the electric vehicle sector, aka $TSLA. This stock is x20+ short term, x100+ long term. Goldman has it at a 9 cent PT short term, which is a 9x increase from it's current price of .01, but that is nothing compared to the actual value of this stock. This stock is on absolute fire right now, about to explode, 1700 followers on ST up from only 10 a month ago. We got mms, shorts, and bears absolutely sweating bullets, posting misinformation, trying to cover and scare people away so they can grab cheaper shares before the boom,, but it's too late, next week, we climb, and we climb very fast. Not only considering the flawless DD on this stock, but also, the chart is perfectly positioned for the jump to orbit. $TSNP x3600 in 5 weeks, $AABB is lined up for the same! Don't let insane shorts and mm scare you with their loud mouths and trash talk, they just want cheaper shares! Good luck, and Love you all!    "

Just wondering what you guys think of Paul Pelosi buying call options on Tesla to me it's a pretty huge deal for the Longs just curious ???? What everyone thinks
Never bet against Elon!!!!
"In Bloomberg: “Tesla has made it absolutely clear that it never intends to comply with that settlement, that it will continue to allow Musk to make material public statements without any sort of controls whatsoever, and that no lawyer can ever tame him. Don’t get me wrong, this is funny, and I enjoy it, but it is also a genuine problem for the SEC. It is hard to enforce securities laws against everyone else if you’re openly letting a high-profile CEO ignore them”"
"Felon claim that the production rate reached 1000/week at the end of December.That should translate to at least 12,000 per Q1, assuming the lowest production rate possible and that there were no increases in production whatsoever for the entire quarter.Anything below 12,000 M3 for Q1 means Felon lied to investors again."
"Trump is going to kill TSLA. Don't believe me -- look at his record. He has a near-flawless record of revenge on anyone who has spoken out against him. Musk is very firmly on-record as stating, pre-election, that ""Trump is not our guy"".Yeah. Know what? Trump is going to humiliate Musk, just like he humiliated Hillary. Bye-bye federal subsidies. Hello, TSLA trading at $50.Go ahead -- ignore me at your peril. The power of Trump's revenge-drive is near-infinite."

farewell to the longest bull market ever!
great time to sell tsla here
How do you like them 20% gains today shorts  fake michael burry where you at bruh ?
Guys l guess there is nothing we can do much but to wait until next Tuesday AH. It’s the 4th quarter earnings and l expect it will blow all expectations away. Then we will properly see 900. Fingers crossed and sit tide. I myself invested twice and average at 840. Hopefully it will turn around after next Tuesday.
The TSLA long speculation and valuation are flawed. EV consumers worldwide want personalized design from a variety of automakers. This isn’t like the smartphone business. Otherwise everyone would have rushed to buy a Toyota Prius when they debuted 20yrs ago. That didn’t happen
"I wanted to buy Tesla - any idea where I could find the money? I, of course know If TSLA a goes to 0 on Monday, I will not need any money to own the company."
"if bitcoin falls to $20k, Musk should personally buy 100 billion dollars worth, and have Tesla buy 200 billion worth. That literally would be over 50% of the bitcoin supply and would give Tesla huge leverage."
It will be interesting to see a 1 trillion or 2 trillion company fall down by 10x.
Short sellers are becoming completely irrelevant. They have been the charging station(get it) that fuels this stock more and more when needed
"Elon Musk is starting to sound more like Maxwell Smart........500,000 ....would you believe 420,000...... would you believe 360,000 ..... Tesla will be profitable from Q3 (2018) forward....would you believe from Q2(2019) forward Would you believe autonomous taxis & ride sharing would you believe Mars colonization.....would you believe???"
This week the tsla going to green and high.Next weekend(September) tsla will be $550+.And October 1 after tsla big day tsla will be $750+
"So does a $50b. market cap and $292 share price presume Tesla will have exponential growth? If so, does a production increase of 6,413 (86,555 q4 from 80,142 q3) exponential growth? I wasn't a math major but I think that is 8%. So now let's talk q1 2019, does laying of 7% of the workforce equate to an exponential increase in production for q1? Longs please give my some answers."
"$35,000 Model 3s =======> could be collectibles (((( The vehicle is virtually identical to the more expensive Standard Range Plus version of the Model 3 except that Tesla has software-locked the battery pack at 90% of its capacity and disabled some features like “onboard music streaming service, navigation with live traffic visualization, and heated seats.” )))) This doesn't lower costs. It just victimizes consumers. If you live and breath Tesla - fine, buy one and be happy. Mainstream consumers are not interested."
"Elon Musk bought 1.5 billion of bitcoin via $tsla. $SQ already owns bitcoin. Bitcoin miners like $mgti, $MARA, $ftft should all benefit and move up with bitcoin"
"There you go, long overdue. If the investors are often discounting future earning it seems like Tesla investors are discounting the hereafter lol. Nothing wrong with Tesla but everything wrong with the price. Long overdue."
NIO new sedan ET7 with autonomy of 965 km . Unbelievable !!!!

"My fellow TSLAns, there will always be down days so never panic. Hold, uninstall your trading app, switch off your PC or go for a walk. $TSLA never disappoints in the long run."
"guys serious questionI have lost everything, and I'm not sure how to continue. This summer I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into ornamental gourd futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions, I decided I'd try to do something similar with another vegetable. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's gourd yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Mexico and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the gourd bubble burst on November 12th. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for thanksgiving, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of December 2nd, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive gourd shipment from Argentina, scheduled for early March, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the gourds in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound. I am ruined."

Tesla will a multi trillion dollar company in 5 years. 60% of my portfolio is in tsla.

elon is very quiet in the monent. something is definitely coming. I stay inside
"Tesla model 2 is on the roadmap, starting at 25k usd 250 miles battery that can last 1M miles. That will be the best selling car in the world"
Elon said that battery news will the biggest news in Tesla history.... I am so excited
"Moodys may be considering a Tesla upgrade, wise decision!!"
"So, Should long term investors Sell TSLA right now or hold and more on the dip?"
"If the PE goes back up to 1600, the pps will be 1280. New PE 1050 now at 80 cents ps."
Recall is old news but Tesla isnow forced to act under pressure from US Security regulator
Any predictions for next week even for Q4 earnings?
"The stock price now is only valid for the stocks sold now, it does not represent the value of Tesla. No one would pay that much for the whole company. So next week the stock price could be 1000 or 100 depending on if mania continues or not. I dont own or short Tesla but if I did own I would sell all and go short now. Only a few will become very rich on this bubble and they are folliwing my advice. 90% of the so called longs will be looking at a blood red trading account forever. The peak price will never come back. Good luck!"

"Oh man, shorts going to cover again today. lol."
"I'm as big a fan boy of Tesla and Elon as the next person, but I worry about Elons health. He hasn't looked the best in a long time, and his weight gain is very noticeable. He needs to take better care of himself and build up his resilience for the next 10 years or he will break down or worse have a heart attack..."
Tesla is the first stock we have ever bought. Until now it has been only Vanguard 500 index. This adventure would be exciting if not so scary! What have I done?

Yes! Go Tesla! 
"Amazing how many MS, M3s and MXs you see in Newport Beach Ca. Tesla has definitely saturated the market here. All the tax credits going to one of the wealthiest cities in America is heart warming. /s. Checked out several M3s and think they can be making good margins on any selling in the 50k range. They are downright tiny and have the cheapest interiors. If a real car company manufactured these, they would have much more luxuries interiors for this price. Anyone who comparison shops, or waits a little bit for the many new competitors vehicles coming out, will be glad they did. The M3 looks like a low end compact four door with an ipad mounted on the dashboard."
"Collectively, the Musks sold Tesla stock and bought Bitcoin. Retailers would do well to follow their lead. I did. The Bitcoin proxy $GBTC is the way I play. Own $GBTC . Don't trade it."
Chart not looking great... may be time to pile on the short.
"In 2005, eccentric hedge fund manager Michael Burry discovers that the United States housing market was going to collapse and made a mint shorting. Now he says Tesla will collapse. I am a little worried given how smart this guy is. I saw the movie the big short."

Earnings will be fantastic. Q3 deliveries will be more than Q2 and Q4 will be more than Q4.This is the next Apple/Amazon.
"1.Chevrolet EV star selling today !2.This week Jaguar Land Rover, said Jaguar brand would be entirely electric by 2025 !3.Ford said its first European-built, all-electric passenger vehicle will be produced at the facility from 2023 !4. Apple will make EV before 2023 newsletter"
"$TSLA battery day = announcement from CATL, packaged as $TSLA innovation. ALL other EVs will basically get the same batteries."
"Elon, what do you do when you abandon a plan and have no Plan B?More of the same?"
"I wonder how can Arc, Vanguard, Blackrock and Elon with hundreds of million stocks quit the game without burning the whole thing? One day they need to escape."
"Musk will go into other sectors. Insurance, energy, robotaxis, etc. Selling just cars is not profitable, the margins are too low. Tesla cars are good, but Musk will have to hit the jackpot with something else. Either FSD or robotaxis. Similar to what Bezos did with AWS; Amazon was losing money till Cloud."
So everyone just conveniently ignoring how strong the support over 800 is? You call this a crash? lmao
sell sell sell
"Tesla is now worth more than the combined values of; GM, F, Honda, Hyundai, Toyota, Daimler, BMW, Suzuki, VW,, FiatChrysler, NIssan, Subaru, Renault, Mahindra....I did not include Ferrari because I didnt feel it was really comparable. I also left out the ""Suzuki of India"".But with all of that, Tesla is still worth 6 billion more.Now you Bulls tell me that this stock isnt coming down.LMFAO"
"I have a question. Did I dream this, or sometime back didn't Tesla (Elon Musk) say they would share their technologies with everyone. Not patent, and such, so the world could benefit (sorta Nikola Tesla like)? Am I wrong, dreaming that happened? Let me know."

is there a market selloff now?
"Once Tesla confirms guidance over 800K deliveries the stock price will shoot to $950 but the squeeze could take that to $1,000"
Tesla doesn’t know how to squeeze shorts more..because it has nothing interesting in pipeline for one more year..so they have to find out ways to do that..yes this is an effective idea..but also fraud
What time do they release the earnings?
"Hmmm... dunno what Musk was REALLY thinking about when he tweeted ""420"" ..."
Maybe we'll get some of those $TSLA profits here today to help bury these shorts...
"It will 100% go up tomorrow. Most analysts focused on revenue, here is the revenue and it is positive. Earnings can be missed slightly but that does not an indication of Tesla is a bad stock! First of all, it is a company that relies on innovation and as Cathy Wood says innovation runs today and our future!!!"

"The extreme cold temperature of Urumqi which is below -30C, gives the advantage to fuel cell vehilces rather than pure electric vehicles whose litihum ion battery performance is greatly affected below -20C. Presently, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles that can work in temperatures of -30C have been adapted and launched in China, thus meeting the operation requirement of Urumqi."
"TSLA could hit $1.5T market cap. Most over-hyped , most over-valued stock in the history of world's stock market."

"Serious post now. Can any long make a real argument why this stock is so cheap at $250. A real argument based on facts. I have spelled out my short case. Huge losses, cash flow negative. convertible bonds coming due, production promises never being met, bipolar CEO, so on and so on. All I have seen from longs is ""EV is the future"", ""musk is a genius"" ""great buying opportunity"". Please give me a solid reason why, not just blind faith or because ""I say so""."
A lot of you posting here fail to realize that in the long run Tesla is not a car company. Looking at Tesla as a car company is like looking at Amazon as a bookstore. Open your minds.
Whose buying this expensive stock?
vote in Elun Mosks mommy in the board and brother
"Look, I'm (negligibly) long in TESLA just because I believe in Elon. But here are the facts. $TSLA beat earnings. Elon musk evaded questions. The conclusions you draw are going to be biased towards your belief in the company. Shorts have the right to he suspicious of his behaviours. Longs have the right to be frustrated at a drop after an earnings report that exceeded expectations."
Tesla about to crash this week. Smart money getting out.
First principle is key to Tesla’s success
When you see crazy valuations of the companies like TSLA is when you realize what a joke US stock market is. However it does make you money thou
Today I'm buying some more. Just need to time it correctly.
"The price of a stock or any product is how much buyers or market think it's worth. There's really no wrong or right price IMO. At this time, $TSLA is worth $800+ dollars because buyers have determined that Tesla is a very valuable company to the world's future. So let it be written and let be said."
"Their energy growth is incredible, that's where they will make tons of money. 1500mwh :D"
Headed to energy sector Baytex Energy for some nice gains! bte
and hopefully the daam insurance companies give us lower prices too !! EV are more simpler than ICE. and just as safe or safer !! Less complex motors and engine !!
"Terrible company, cant fund itself on operations only capital raises. Not good. See ya at 75 in a year."
that little dip gave us the nice little boost to get this thing rolling to $875
Down on an up day again. Very worrisome. I’ve pulled my chips off the table for now. Could easily drop below $300 if production has truly dropped to 600-800 per week.
Make that money longs. Longs outnumber the shorts and the numbers are getting stronger. Live with it
"Nothing seems to be moving with this stock, up or down lately"
"London (CNN Business)Battery electric vehicles accounted for more than half of all cars sold in Norway last year, putting the country way out in front in efforts to kill off the internal combustion engine. And Tesla (TSLA) lost its sales crown to the Volkswagen Group.Norway is using huge tax incentives to help ensure that every new passenger car and van sold in the country by the end of 2025 is a zero-emission vehicle. Record electric vehicle sales in 2020 means the country is now ahead of schedule, according to Oyvind Solberg Thorsen, CEO of the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV).The market share of electric cars in Norway increased to 54% in 2020 from 42% the previous year, according to data published by OFV on Tuesday. When hybrid vehicles are included, the share of electrified vehicles hit 83% last year."
Anyone got any cheap 600 puts for sale?
"Bear case is rearing its head. Notice that the stock is not reaching new heights and is trending sideways. If earnings miss by even a hair, this will signal a bearish downturn that no bulls can stop. The valuation issue will get a spotlight and the big guys might trim their tsla holdings."
"Out of the money put options? I feel the premium is high, and the Theta bleed is extreme, that makes trading as a contrarian on Tesla harder."
if this goes below 700 there will be gap down to 685.
hold until $2500/
Can we please go just one day without hearing about PT Barnum on the news?
UH OH SHORTS. Nice recovery from the lows
"#NIO; #XPEV; #TSLATwo commonly known golden nuggets from legends such as Buffett: 1. Be greedy when others are fearful... 2. Invest in a company you understand and you and other customers love its products...The first principle may not always work. Not all crashing companies will recover (if not supported by fundamentals), but for Nio the fundamentals are so strong and getting stronger (more sales, more products, more orders, more cash, more partnerships, more government supports...).The 2nd principle will always work out for true investors. NIO is ranked #1 in luxe EV in China with pristine quality of German engineering and design. Most importantly, it is loved by its loyal customers with the highest customer satisfactions and word-of-mouth free-agent enthusiasm. I invested in NIO very early, NIO, the car, not the stock, was love at first sight. Even though Nio is not available in the US, I am certain I will be among the first to get one when Nio arrive here.Have been through this cycle several times. Watching NIO crashing from post IPO high of $11.60 to $1.19, I averaged down. As NIO strengthens its fundamentals continuously, I averaged up and down later. Now, with the super sale prices, I am adding again.If you believe in NIO's fundamentals, if you love NIO's cars, hold and/or add to your positions.Do your DD and invest wisely. GLTA."
Read marketwatch report if you're questioning legality of the tweet. Perfectly legal in summary. All there needs to be is an agreement of the funding signed by those investors and majority vote of shareholders-and according to the tweeting-he's got about 90% of the shareholder votes.

Mutuals with TSLA heavy holdings continue to shine. But for how long?
Here is a stock that is priced for absolute PERFECTION...and they miss earning estimate by 20%. Yikes
Tesla opened India office at Bangalore yesterday according news flash
"Think about this: there is no way Felon will ever give up his Tweeter account.

Short above $500.Buy below $300.Easy money.
There is no dose of reality strong enough that will make the longs taste the real flavor of the TSLA coolaid.
When do we sell guys?
"all of thr good news and future revenue sources are already baked into this cake, bubble!"
"Let's assume that TSLA gets to 50% marketshare tomorrow and then holds it indefinitely. This is not a reasonable assumption, but humor me. Further, let's assume a 5% net margin (vs 1.89% most recently). Now, the worldwide market for new vehicles (number of vehicles x average selling price) is around $2.8T. So, TSLA would get $1.4T and would earn $70B (@5% net margin). Now since we've assumed growth stops at 50% marketshare, a reasonable PE would be 12 (No more growth, just dividends). So, 12 x $70B is $840B, which is basically what the market cap is today. Good job.Now TSLA has other businesses and they could get more than 50% marketshare. And the market for new vehicles in 2030 is expected to be $3.4T, not $2.8T and they can make money from subscriptions etc. But seriously? Tesla vehicles are great, but Tesla's stock no longer is. JMHO."

Now I'll be the first to post that I expect there to be a potential of 50% decline in US sales and we will soon hear about production halts due to inventory buildup... maybe they'll mask it with ""prepping factory for EU""... but...if the sales drop is as bad as I think it could be... Tesla could be in imminent trouble... to me it looks like raising Super Charging rates and the like... to be signs of survival mode."
I wonder how many people became millionaires all thanks to TSLA.
Tesla sells out of Q1 Supply of Model Y in China just days after opening order page
"What is the incentive for posting “SELL NOW” advise here? it is obvious these posters have shorts or puts position and trying to create selling pressure.Investment is like nurturing tree, you have to be patient and wait for its fruit. Don’t SELL if you are a investor, you may sell if you are a trader.Selling on 8% drop causes you to lose another 20-30% of your investment leverage because of tax. You will be waiting for another 20%-30% drop before you can buy and to take same position. With stocks like TSLA, you will easily miss boat by 10% on upswing trying to time market.Net result of panic selling is no profit, simple tax donation and extra headache."
I'm expecting margins to drop to the 10% level... OH MAMA! Good job Tesla isn't going to wild on expenditures in the next few months.

"While the kids are playing investor with failing companies like $GME, $BB and $NOK, the adults have been slowly adding to our positions in $XLE and $OXY.For those who are too young to understand, these are businesses with assets who sell their products for money.

We will need oil and gas forever. The population will grow and more will be needed.This is called investing like an adult.

Bitcoin doesn't exist physically but cocaine does. What can you sell when the internet is down? :)))Tesla should buy all the cocaine fields in Central and South America and should sell every Tesla with a cocaine subscription therefore keeping the customers loyal!
tsla is starting making its run ... see how far it will go before yr end. my take is at least breaking all time high and how much after that is to be seen. it is a must own stock. happy trading and good luck to all.
"I just can't imagine what goes someones mind when buying $TSLA right now. There are so many other better deals on the market and we're still double the price of where we were 4 months ago.What fueled the gains? -over 500k deliveries - not happening this yearI have tremendous respect for Elon and believe that Tesla could be a big player in the future, but right now things look bleak and they have a lot a lot a lot a lot of debt to service"

New 52 week low is approaching fast...
"TSLA made me some really nice money after buying in April 2020, gradually selling at 500 700 and finally out at 850. I give thanks to Tesla, the stock market bull run, and everyone who helped push the TSLA stock price up and up. I wish Elon Musk and each of you great future success. Even though I am now out, I do hope the stock price doubles soon for all of you faithful longs!"

Nothing achieved yet but everyone here wants to paint a colorful picture for Tesla's future. In the whole history where FOMO and greed made the winners think that they know it all were the one who got punished most. 2021 is the year where many users will switch to EV at three same time other manufacturers will take a big chunk of this increase. Tesla has managed to give (rare scenario) no negative news for a very long time. But when negative starts flowing out, there will be no mercy on this stock."

This should send the stock back up to 300 in a big hurry!” Coming up a few weeks later, “100 a share?!? This is absurd!

Does anyone here work for Tesla. A friend of mine said that’s his brother works there and gets stock options from the company. I understand management might but he’s just a regular line employee. Thank you for a response.
"According to Musk, only 2 American car companies did not go broke.So, he didn't say only 2 tech companies or 2 energy companies or 2 bitcoin companies.He said 2 *car* companies. But he also noted that the cult is very, very dense."
"In EU (europa) as the biggest market for EV cars then Tesla is not nr 1 company but Hyundai and VW are much bigger and own a much bigger part of the market in EU so what is the reason that Tesla has a 10 to 20 times bigger market value when they are like nothing in the world??? very good question and I think the value of the company is 20 times over valued, but if Tesla in the future are getting a bigger part of the market and can expend the company and get a bigger earnings after tax then maybe they should have a bigger value on the company but I think they have to show that they can do it first like produce 10 mil cars and get very big positive cash flow but thing that is some years before that happen.So a fare value on the share is around 40 to 80 $ as it is today"

"HEY KENNETH. I need some help with physics. If a 1730 kg Tesla Model 3, driven by a mime (45 kg), is traversing through the redwood forest at 45 mph, bearing heading 275 degrees, and a 180 m tall, 2 .5 meter diameter redwood topples over and lands squarely on it's roof at the mid-point of the roof, does he scream? Assume standard air pressure and temperature.(this question is just as relevant as that planet acceleration thingy)."
"QuantumScape's solid state battery ""Technology in development"", it is suggested that this new ""dry electrode"" battery (that eliminates a step in manufacturing and ensures a much longer-life battery making the liquid components dry, more stable) would be a Tesla Killer. IMO Elon would most likely release a competing battery technology ""before"" QS can actually have a material impact on the market. Tesla's economies of scale and technological superiority are virtually impossible for a startup to catch never mind exceed. At the end of the day the QS battery tech will help Tesla by forcing it to further it's lead in the market and stay ahead of the EV solid state battery curve. So hedge your bet and buy some QS but I suggest there is nothing to be concerned about."
"At least China might start making their own “Tesla” cars. We can buy a brand new “Model S” for $30k in a couple of years, after Tesla is out of business."

"If/when this hits 1k a share I will certainly begin shorting. Ill start with just 5 shares, and add 5 for every 100 dollar level upwards. If somehow it manages to go to 2k ill take my loss. I give myself a 95% chance of success."
Seriously guys how impressive was the total annihilation of that $625 floor yesterday? Eviscerated within minutes. So much smart money ready to pounce on the overselling. With that behind us it’s a steady climb to the 900s by April

"Saudi's may have taken a 5% stake in the company recently, but it is pretty clear that that stake was not based on an understanding of the balance sheet. The balance sheet shows pretty clearly that the company is insolvent. There are two options:1. Musk has lied about the status of the company and given the Saudi's confidence that he will be cash flow positive, etc., causing them to make the investment decision or 2. They are investing based on some perception of future growth in selling high end electric cars.If we give Musk the benefit of the doubt here (I don't personally, but you may), and assume there is a great future selling $50,000 mid size cars, then it will be 2-3 quarters before the market gets a sense of the demand after the 'noise' is reduced. Here are the 'noise' items:(a) Manufacturing capability - Can they produce quality cars at capacity without huge capex? (b) Demand - Are there customers who will buy midsize sedans at $35,000 to $50,000 after the early adopters have been satisfied?(c) Government incentives - What will the impact be of government incentives and their end?(d) Run rate financial condition - Can the finances of the company stabilize enough to understand/differentiate between capital costs and operating costs so that it is possible to evaluate the profitability and potential cost savings.(e) and just to throw in one more, will the cars remain appealing from a design standpoint once there are a vast array of alternativesSo I think it will be a few quarters before a true evaluation of the company can happen.

"What’s gonna make Tesla pop ! Year end production numbers ? Maybe not as were all expecting this. Year end record profits ? Maybe maybe not again an expected event. BUT what about a Model S refresh ? That would be cool. My guess being able to pay for FSD as a service or perhaps FSD for $50 or even $100/mo instead of buying for 10,000 Elon has indicated this is possible. And why not I’m on my 3rd Tesla why should I buy FDD 3 times. 25k car getting unveiled ? Those should be 3 surprises that will make Tesla pop Then just wait for the Semi and Cyber trucks to roll out. It will be game over"

Went to Starbucks today and as I’m in line I see a beautiful white model 3 in front of me. It had the paper license plate on it. After I left Starbucks I’m heading towards the avenue and a gorgeous white model Y passes me and it had a paper plate. And as I’m getting home close to turning the block I see another model 3 (this time black) and guess what it had!? A paper license plate. These are all recent deliveries! Imagine those going around with regular license plates that are also recently delivered. Honestly I’m taking this as a good sign... just thought I should share.

"On Reddit greenmoustache asks for help. His model 3 in minor accident has a damaged wheel and bent control arm. Towed to service center and quoted $1300 for repairs. He told them to order the parts. Two weeks later they put it on a lift and call him. Say there's also body damage and they can't touch it. Also canceled his parts order and told him he has to return the loaner and take his car to an authorized body shop. He asked multiple times if body damage is structural or cosmetic, but they wouldn't say. Also won't help him get it to a body shop. He called multiple approved body shops in the area and none of them would take his car because they already have such a backlog of model 3 waiting for parts. He also emailed the Tesla body shop. Remember when Elon was going to revolutionize body shops by opening his own so you could get your car fixed the same day? total bs. The poor guy hasn't even gotten the Tesla body shop to respond. He doesn't know what to do. Faced with paying for a rental for months. Absolutely loves the car though. Just can't drive it anymore. I suppose he could go see it on visiting day. Give it a hug or two."

Currently the recall is voluntary but they are moving to make it mandatory as it poses a safety concern as it controls the car. TESLA is hesitant because it isn't the easy fix they currently claim. We are talking about changing out an integrated chip which would require the removal and disassembly of every screen and replacement of an integrated component if it is even possible.

With hoods open, many are non-workable and others are just sitting. The truck companies are not experiencing delays in shipping for others so maybe Tesla has tried to save cash. The article further presumed that the 400,000 orders are not accepting vehicles that end up costing $62,000. Is demand softer than it looks? Tesla claims it is selling all it manufactures but the rear wheel drive may not be wanted. Further severe shortage of replacement parts is occurring. Is this a company in crisis?"

"Hello followers and happy new year. I have been on an extended holiday, and have just returned. I have analyzed thoroughly and see that TSLA is sitting in the perfect position for the ""ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTIES"" ( the option mm's and their followers/players) to effect the VERY significant , most significant in fact option unwind in the history of TSLA. You see that this friday , the JAN 15 options will expire. These were the former leap options that have been around for a couple of years or so, so they naturally have a lot of open interest , but in fact, they have more open interest than ANY series of options that TSLA has experienced EVER. So much interest , that if you choose the strike price which renders the LOWEST dollar value of ALL the combined options outstanding for JAN 15 expiry added together. ( what all the calls and puts of the whole series would be worth if TSLA closes at that strike price), they would still be worth $14.3 BILLION . That compares with the analgous figure of $380 million for the Jan 22 expiration , a small percentage of the dollar open interest of the jan 15 exp. At yesterday's close of aprox $850, the jan 15 options would be worth aprox $22.6 BILLION . Now I have seen TSLA swallow $2 BILLION of change from the LDV without trouble when it has news or huge momentum, but never has it had to swallow such a difference before. It is going to be interesting to see this expiration. Have fun my followers!"

Compare the movement of the Nasdaq Composite to EV bubble stocks in the past few weeks. Nasdaq has been on an uptrend while EV bubble stocks have been trading sideways. Next observe that EV bubble stocks have been trading with very low volume for the past 2 weeks now. Hype dying down? Pool of irrational buyers drying up? I believe the bubble may very well be on the cusp of bursting as people realize that they have been buying on EV hype and an Apple EV is the biggest hype there is.
"Elon think he can get better ROI on btc than expanding tesla, this is a red flag"

"Info on Tesla, great numbers according to some desperate souls: Delivered only 3,590 vehicles(all models combined) in November in the US, down 18% from a year ago.Also, the 3,590 vehicles amounts to a market share of only 0.26%, of the 1,393,010 new cars and trucks sold in the US in November."
"Wall street news is reporting the news as it is. Tesla didnt beat the numbers. It just a bit shy less from its target. It is not a exciting number to move the market to gap up. The main reason is that the stock is way way ahead of the actual performance of the company by more than 5 years. so just meeting its target is not convincing for bulls to take it further.But again no sane person would buy this stoc at 1400 PE. With increased competition, tesla cars becomes price sensitive. Meaning, it is becoming to become like a commodity. Apple is going to be entering the market. This is a 1000 pounds gorilla with a proven track record to reckon with."

"Rumor: Tesla Model 2 Already Developed in China & Goes to Production in 2022On January 8, information was leaked from the Chinese media that Tesla had already developed a new car model, and would soon be ready to begin production at its Giga Shanghai. The affordable compact car is expected to be produced and delivered in 2022.According to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, some of the best works of art in the world were created in China, so he believes that projects created in China will also be popular around the world. The Chinese have always been distinguished by originality, speed, and intelligence, so China is a great place to develop, create, and implement the most original and unexpected solutions.At the ceremony of handing over the first made-in-China Model 3s to owners, which took place on January 7, 2020, in Shanghai, Musk announced that Tesla plans to establish its own R&D center in China, where the company will create a car for the whole world. Musk said:“Something that would be super cool...so we’re going to do it...is to try to create a China to actually design an original car in China for worldwide consumption. I think this will be very exciting.""As early as mid-January 2020, Tesla began recruiting employees for the new development center and called on them to help the company build Chinese-style cars.Today, the Chinese media, citing reliable sources, reported that the new Tesla car model already was approved as early as September 2020. Product verification is expected to be completed in March 2021, with production and first deliveries scheduled to begin in 2022. Tesla will build its new model at Giga Shanghai.According to sources, the chassis of the car is based on the Model 3 chassis, which will also speed up and simplify the start of production. Perhaps this is what made it possible to develop a new model so quickly. Estimated price will range from RMB150,000 to RMB200,000 ($25,000 - $30,000).When Tesla opened recruitment for the R&D center in mid-January 2020, the team used an image of an interesting new concept car. We've never seen anything like it before. Whether Tesla will develop something similar at the new Chinese R&D center, or it's just a picture that has nothing to do with Tesla's future projects, we do not know. But the new China-made model is sure to be as stunning as the entire Chinese Tesla project.Good luck and GOD bless,"

Most are working from home. They will postpone their decision to buy car until schools and work place are open. Though I am positive that Tesla will meet their delivery target.

Wow Tesla!!!
"Terrific analysis by Morningstar’s John Rekenthaler. Bottom line: TSLA is a collectible: Most of the company’s terrific stock market performance owes to its business results. In 2010, Tesla’s annual revenues were a modest $117 million. Early believers were undeterred, believing that the firm’s sales would skyrocket. They were correct. Last year, Tesla recorded $31.5 billion in revenues, making for a 39% annualized 10-year growth rate. Tesla would not have appealed to Ben Graham, but he would have appreciated the reason for the stock’s success. Recently, though, Tesla’s stock price has sometimes appeared to diverge from its corporate affairs. In 2020, for example, Tesla gained 780%, although the firm’s revenues and profits finished slightly below analysts’ estimates. True, those results were achieved during an unanticipated global recession, so there was good reason for the stock to rise. But the amount seems excessive. So, too, does the stock’s 19% increase on March 9, a day without significant company news.It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that, to some extent, Tesla’s stock has become a collectible--a security that is prized not solely for its company’s virtues but also for the belief that it will appreciate because others desire it."
"""We may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims."" Does Tesla already know, what we suspect?"

"If a company’s stock is trading at $100 per share, for example, and the company generates $4 per share in annual earnings, the P/E ratio of the company’s stock would be 25 (100 / 4). To put it another way, given the company’s current earnings, it would take 25 years of accumulated earnings to equal the cost of the investment.TESLA would take 1325 years of accumulated earnings to equal the cost of the investment.You will return your investment in year 35226 ! Can you live for next 1300 years or you think Do you think that Musk can extend your life by a thousand years ?"

"Tesla unveils first home charging station (and lies) that it can be plugged into a commonly used wall outlet, a NEMA 14-50 plug. The 1-15 and 5-15 types comprise the majority of outlets in a home, never saw a NEMA 14-50 receptacle in any any garage in the country... But Tesla LIES and says, "" This Wall Connector allows home owners to install a high-voltage charging system in a home without hiring an electrician. Just plug it in."" Except that you need to run a new high voltage line, with new circuit breaker, to garage with the new plug , requiring a licensed electrician..."

"People think TSLA won’t do well with competition. That is simply false. There is no way TSLA will ever be able to make enough cars to meet all the demand around the world. There will be other players such as NIO, XPEV, Lucid, and VW to fulfill the remaining demand. TSLA’s market share will be gigantic still. Shorts have this idea fixed in their head that competition kills. That’s not always the case. Look at Coke and Pepsi. Square and PayPal. Bookings and Expedia. I don’t see any of those companies bleeding to death due to competition. TSLA will do just fine."
$TSLA positive full year earnings maybe in store. Would need about $2 EPS to be green for 2019. Positive for Q4 and trailing 12 mo (fy 2019 at this earnings) would make TSLA eligible to be added to S&P 500 after this earnings! How much money would funds need to buy on that event.

"Pump and Dump. The dump is well overdue, but right now I still see a lot of pumping going on.People talking about the next stock split or people saying that Apple is going to buy out Tesla.At 1200 times earnings, I think it's already been pumped enough. We have seen it sell off before after the event. After the split, it was supposed to go to the moon, but instead sold off.Right now, there could be a bit of residual buying due to S&P inclusion. Also, some people may be reluctant to sell at the end of year due to tax consequences. Even so, the dump is well overdue. PS, if I were afraid of selling now due to tax consequences, I'd probably buy some puts now and then sell immediately after the end of the year."

"Extremely unclear as to how $TSLA is trading above $2.00 given the information available to the market. It's over. There is no viable path forward.Why not? First, almost no one is buying the cars. There's no profit left at the new low price, which is just there now to balance bad PR. The star CEO is is civil contempt of court after committing securities fraud. The CFO left. The GC left. The HR VP left. So did 60 others.Those that weren't laid off in Big Layoff 1 or Big Layoff 2 want to leave because they see the writing on the wall. Top talent is already gone. Gigafactory 1 will soon be Panasonic's. Gigafactory 2 is an empty fraud subject to clawbacks. Gigafactory 3 is an open field in China.The stores are all closing. The Model S and Model X lawsuits continue to pile up because of design and manufacturing defects, including those from buildings cars in a tent. The Model 3 has more flaws than the S or X, but those lawsuits haven't even hit yet for the most part.There isn't enough reserved for warranty repairs. The DOJ was investigating Model 3 production numbers long ago, and is likely triply interested now. The Parulekar accounts payable wire fraud case is still mostly sealed. And there's likely been an SEC referral to DOJ over Musk.Then there's the cash crunch. Today, $920 million in cash vanishes. They misled investors on cash position in the 10-K so they probably only have a couple hundred million left (if that), so the company is running on fumes and has to delay small claims hearings over $5K disputes.Can someone on Wall Street please explain where the $50 billion in value remains for this company?Because if that wasn't enough, the cars also have a tendency to A) change lanes on their own; and B) spontaneously combust, killing people, as if we're back to the days of the Ford Pinto."

"What do you think ? Should TSLA buy the small Israeli company Foresight Autonomous ( FRSX ) for its all wether cameras ?Foresight’s new vision for autonomous vehicles is achieved by fusing stereo visible-light cameras with thermal long-wave infrared sensors that provide depth perception and obtain a clear 3D view. The IP-protected technology is based on 3D video analysis, advanced algorithms for image processing and sensor fusion, achieving an unprecedented accurate obstacle detection in harsh lighting and weather conditions including complete darkness, rain, haze, fog and glare. The technology generates a 3D point cloud of data that enables analysis of different terrains and 3D sensor fusion.Foresight’s technology scans the road ahead to foresee possible collisions with vehicles, pedestrians, animals and other obstacles. The technology can be customized to address the challenges of ADAS and autonomous vehicle markets, including object detection under diverse road, lighting and weather conditions."

I’ll call that exponential growth, Ford, GM and Chrysler have all lost sales TESLA is the only car company that is actually growing I like that I think I’ll buy more shares on Monday"

"Having now watched NIO's presentation I have to say that I'm really impressed.Everything seems very well thought and they are really on the edge of AD. The big range of 1000km, replaceable battery will be able to make this a game changer. This can have Teslas valuation in a few years but with 10 millions of vehicles sold.Building the replacing stations will make ""charging"" much quicker and they don't need so many as the replacing of the battery will take max 5 minutes. They can recharge all the batteries in the station overnight and have them ready the next day. Every car manufacturer will have a replaceable battery.I never thought I might consider investing in a car company, but this looks, even given it's extremely high value something, very interesting. It's interesting to know how much IP they have in form of patents. I haven't researched that yet. They topped the camera by a factor of 7 compared to the current Teslas...use flexible lidar to enhance the tracking of only certain objects, have redundancy with the multiple viewing angles. They equip all cars with the same hardware and you can book AD on a monthly basis which is great if you don't want it or if you travel abroad for a year. It's really a milestone in car manufacturing the way I see it."

"Tesla is having quality problems most notably with their displays and battery life. China is now playing games with them. Elon is moving said company to another state. The EV field is now over crowded with companies that have a long experience making cars plus a plethora of new globally local manufacturers. GM and Ford have some exciting products being released shortly. Very exciting stuff but this is legit competition to Tesla which has been absent in the past.I credit Elon for accelerating [pun] change the future of automobiles. I know I’m happy and excited about this outcome. Legitimate investment experts [Goldman, Forbes & more] are telling us this is a poorly run automobile company making a poor product. Argue all you want about solar panels and rockets this is the main product that this stock is valued for. Ignoring all the pomp and circumstance here these issues are real and consumers will react accordingly.I had some skin in the game and let it go at $850. Made some decent money, thank you Elon. I will keep an eye on Tesla and the industry obviously."

"All in all the whole of markets are over bloated and in dangerous territories, over priced and no longer going on shares earnings per pricing fundamentals,most whole of markets are going on popularity favoritism based shares,most fund managers and people are not doing there DD or home work bur telling people to keep investing in a over illed priced dangerous market just waiting to collapse,there is a bad market crash on the horrizon.The trouble with those signs is that while they are very obvious with the benefit of hindsight, they aren’t so easy to see in real time.In 1929, JFK’s father Joseph Kennedy Sr. picked up on one of those subtle signs and didn’t just get out at the top, he scored a massive windfall on the way down as well,yes he was one of those few who did not loose all his money back in the devastating 1929`s crash,how you ask..by sitting in a shoe shine chair having his shoes shined ...and yes it was the shoe shine boys advise that made him think drastically,this all very simple sign most people do not care to believe in or digest has always been proven right time over time,once again it seems it will prove more over."
"My favorite comment in here ""why is the stock down"" the term bubble is being thrown around A LOT and it's 100% apparent when Rappers like Meek Mill are telling people to buy TSLA when the guy has no fundamental understanding of the market.The institutions are slowly selling off as to not #$%$ you all, you're the bag holders who are washing the free QE'd money they printed. If you made money, be smart. GET OUT.If not, live with your own choices when it inevitably does, greed clouds judgment.a"

"$TSLA had $50mm ""Placed for Collection"" in July, & another $6.8mm placed for collection in August, per D&B. No wonder Tesla customers can't get through to customer service, busy fielding calls from debt collectors. One way to juice the Q3 balance sheet"
"When the ""CO2 is the sole driver of the climate"" religion fades and the fact that the earth - sun relationship is the real driver of climate and climate change and the tesla fad is over because regardless of the above it didn't make economic sense to pour trillions into the grid when there's so much energy dense fossil fuel just laying around waiting to be used by efficient ICE vehicles (a current and apparently under the radar trend) and musk has bailed on the cult, what ICE dealer is going to take a tesla as a trade in?"
"""Tesla says new Autopilot would likely have prevented fatality""so... what's this?... an admission to liability that the version of software they sold their customers was flawed?if this version ""would likely have prevented a fatality""... then what aren't they aware of in this release that will likely cause a fatality?why are they allowed to release any of these features at all?... they claim they make people more safe... and use statistics gathered from 1/100,000 of the total miles driven per year to justify these claims.it is quite obvious they are endangering the lives of their customers to sell a $3000 software package and provide misleading evidence that Tesla is the ""Future"".this is criminal."

"Intermittent Full Self Driving, which is what Tesla's FSD actually is, takes away the most valuable metric a safe driver possesses: Situational Awareness. When FSD informs a non-engaged driver to immediately take control, he/she needs to instantaneously ascertain the risk, develop a plan of action, act upon that action, and have the car response to their inputs. You just traveled 100 meters at 70 mph. Ever notice yourself unconsciously slowing down (or covering the brake) in congested areas, when black ice is suspected, or kids/pets playing nearby? FSD does none of this, but drives like a kocky (sic) teenager, and then hands the wheel to you, with no advanced warning, when it has no solution."
"Bitcoin mining emits 36.95 megatons of CO2 annually. That’s equal to the emissions of about 8 million ICE automobiles, according to the EPA. Let's throw in a few natural gas wells in Texas for good measure. Invest in our clean future, my fellow sycophants!"

Shorts might be lucky if the overall market is down. $350 is still likely if the ride turns later.
"Looking at the chart both long and short traders lost on Friday. Don't fall for the casino. You only lose money and if you want to go long this is a total no go unless you are indoctrinated and believe Tesla is worth so much more than just a car company. My mining stocks had huge gains on Friday even though the metals fell.Why is that?Well bond yields rose but not because the FED wanted it! They rose because nobody wants to hold the bonds any longer. They rise because the inflation is backed into the cake. That being said stupid people sell gold or sell because of margin calls and smart people buy metals and mining stocks. The inflation will be huge. The money velocity is EXTREMELY low at the moment, yet money creation rises exponential. I start to believe this whole pandemic is more about staying in control of the monetary systems around the world and redistribution of wealth from the bottom 99% to the upper 1%. In the scenario of rising bond yields and inflation TESLA is a catastrophic gamble and it's coming this is just the beginning. You ain't seen nothing yet."

Shorts - Today should be no different than any other day. The stock will give back all the gains and go into red at close. Keep shorting.
Who would buy a Tesla EV when the build is sub par and it can take weeks or months to get an appointment at a service center?? Seriously...who would do that?

Volume is extremely low for the last 3 sessions. No Buying appetite !!
Love the per market We will hit 1000$ soon get ready 
"Investing $10,000 in $TSLA ten years ago would now be worth $430,151 at today's close. Thanks"
SHORTS picking up the posting pace here in the last 45min of trading ... so fun.
At this TSLA's stock price level the retail investors are no longer effecting stock price. It's the Mutual funds and MM who buy and will buy millions and millions of shares. have more effect on stock. The S&P inclusion will encourage more and more institutions to buy. We are only at the beginning of TSLA's growth potential. Musk is the innovator of the century creating the future for generations to come. TSLA today is the AAPL 20 years ago...those holding long position will be the winners..as TSLA will split few times in the next few years. I believe that by Battery day TSLA will reach 2000 to 2400..After battery day the stock can reach 2500 to 3000.
"Good to take a stroll back in time to a little more sane reality regarding Tesla. Elon Musk said in around the end of April. """"Tesla stock price is too high imo"" (in my opinion), Musk said on Twitter."" If Tesla was overvalued then, how much more is it overvalued now? Even Elon knows this stock run up has been a joke."
All the run up last week was based on deliveries not production...Ives was wrong again...he thought deliveries would be in the 510K+ range....didn’t even get to 500K...production did...who cares about production.....
"The military ban in China is one potential risk for Tesla. But, you can drive a Ford, a GM, a Toyota to a military compound with hidden devices to gather data if that is what you want. Easy to do with today's technology.In the end, it is if the US will decouple with China or not. As far as I see it. Elon is a global guy, he is concerned about the survival of human species. And China embraces globalization and they fit.Long term I do not see decoupling because the world can not live with separate systems --- two different Internet, two 5G, 6G standards . So that leaves us two scenarios, 1) US does not accept China's rise, US China get into war , 2) US realize China is a big country, its rise is enviable, and accept it and seek ways to benefit from its rising.It scenario 1) happens, we all die. then if we held Tesla stock or held cash when we died it makes no difference. If scenario 2) happens, Tesla stock will grow multiple times, it is much better than holding cash.So scenario one cash and tesla stock the same, scenario 2) Tesla stock win big over cash. Then what to do is obvious - stay invested in Tesla."

"$TSLAMy average for Tesla is below $100.I am fully aware that Tesla had its run and NIO is undervalued and misunderstood. I'm pretty sure all the Tesla bulls will hate me even though I got into Tesla 2 years earlier than majority of you. Most of you probably bought tesla post stock split or above $1000 PRE STOCK SPLIT.I got in Tesla beloe $100s. So I continue to add I to NIO and sell Tesla. Why? Because Tesla is not better than over 10 automakers combined in terms of market cap, especially not Toyota. Tesla is great though, but I never expected tesla to even pass 500 when I got in initially when they were on the verge of bankruptcy.I don't care if Tesla drops because my average is so low that I can laugh at you late buyers post run up. I can't even justify the current market cap.For NIO I can because it's a luxury EV/tech/infrastructure company that has all the components of Tesla except better in an economy that will surpass America aka China.So I can actually justify the market cap moving up because this is Chinas future cash cow. Everything Cathue woods priced in for Tesla is 10-25 years forward and has not been priced in for NIO yet.Hate me? Too bad. So do all my friends who doubted me when I told them to buy tesla 3 years ago and they bought in 2.5kNow I'm saying NIO is like tesla on steroids and will surpass Tesla because the Chinese economy and Chinese companies are undervalued and misunderstood. Good luck. Don't come on to nio board to hate on tesla. I have been in both companies longer than you."
"People who are involved in technology will usually reach a point where they realize that most of the people in the world are quite science and technology ignorant. Some will try to rip-off those who ""don't understand."" From the mechanic who tells someone he needs repair to his car he doesn't, to the CEO of an electric car company who tells people they're ""saving the planet"" buying his car. I'm not sure how we stop this problem of dishonest people deceiving those less knowledgeable than them."
"Here is a warning. Be cautious on China. Sales of Tesla cars are doubling in China. But note China is beating up Tesla on quality. That is a signal for for Tesla not to become too big, to strong. CCP and Commerce will in the end support their domestic EV manufacturers to the point regulating, or subsidising their domestic manufacturers. If you need an example of regulating and controlling, look at what they have done to Alibaba's Jack Ma. And he is their own. To big, to strong, to dominating is not a good position to be in China."

This company has made more money from selling its own stock than selling cars.
"Even if $TSLA gets cut in half, it will still be above it's 200 day average price. Kudos to the longs who were smart enough to sell above $800 while the bag holders were buying."

Another down day on higher than average volume. Not a bullish sign for $TSLA
This Goldman finance analyst is a genius^I better listen to him and just did upload some more levered $TSLA call options :)Alrdy gained 250% $$ since S+P announcement and hope we hit 780$ soon to get another 250% gain ;D
All turned into bears out of a sudden.
"If Dems win Georgia, you could see $600/week unemployment again. That would take Tesla to $2K, just like in July."
Musk guilty of insider trading and securities fraud:1) insider trading. Musk bought shares while discussing private deal with Saudis. 2) Securities fraud. Funding was not secured. There was no contract or anything when Musk made public statements last week.

"Elon Musk just became the richest man in the world. Next, Tesla to become the largest market cap company in the world. Watch you will see that day. Take my word for it. Cheers."
"I wish Musk had clarified in his tweet last week as to what ""secured financing"" meant. I would not have harvested my kidney to buy shares last week."
"I like how when the analyst says he's raising his target from $500 to $750, the cult sees it as good news to run it up to $880."
"Let's be honest, Musk bought bitcoin to save the planet, he's such a great man."
TSLA rocks again on a big down day in the market. PYRNF and URAGF team up for battery capacity improvement 3-4 times greater than that of graphite currently used in commercial Li-ion batteries. This will keep the party going for everyone in 2021. Silicon is a much more efficient then graphite.
We'll see a gushing Cathy Wood with all the additional TSLA buying opportunties coming up soon - so cheap!
"first i like to congratulate the long, you made your money.

While the revenue of GM, FORD and Chrysler is 17.6 times that of Tesla. All the wall street and market experts on this board, please tell me what I'm missing here.I suspect TESLA will crash big time without any notice. This stock is being control, manipulated by Market Makers. Good luck everyone"

"Everyone wanted to buy $TSLA yesterday at $650. Investors should be all over $TSLA at $626 with the S&P buy-in next week. Buy low, sell high. Price target was just upped to $780 by Goldman and then to $2500 in 3 years. Hold, big money is flowing into Tesla next week."
Tesla + Bitcoin. the portfolio of 2021+
"TSLA is not overvalued. Again, it is much more than a BEV car manufacturer. No legacy car company (domestic or foreign) is as diversified as Tesla. They have no new BEV dedicated gigafactories. Tesla gets their batteries and solar panels from Panasonic. But Tesla is starting its own battery production at its Fremont plant. Tesla builds utility size solar battery storage facilities (Kauai, PG&E, Australia, Texas). It makes its Powerwall/Pack battery modules and packs. Tesla is beyond the prototype stage in building the class 8 Electric semis at its new Austin GF. Also, the all-stainless steel body electric cybertruck will be built there. Tesla has its own worldwide proprietary Supercharging network. Other charging systems are a confused mixture of different technologies with no universal billing standards/pricing or plugins. Tesla has an incredibly large and learning BEV data base. No one is as close to applying Full Self Driving on a large scale as Tesla. Almost all Teslas built are equipped for a FSD over the air software chargeover (Robotaxi capable). Tesla leads in online software updates and applications. Demand is through the roof. The competition (wish them well) is way behind and “burning” for more cash to catch up than Tesla ever did. Tesla never advertised. It’s CEO (who builds successful rockets and digs tunnels in his spare time) has a sense of humor and almost 50 million social media followers. All the above adds up to Tesla investor’s perception that the company’s future is worth its current $650 billion market capitalization."
"All I read when I see Tesla hate is, ""I'm sad Teslas not dropping, I hate when things don't make sense"""

"Cobalt prices ===== another $1,000 per unit disadvantage (*) (**) Like it or not Tesla is the high cost producer. If Cobalt prices continue to spike their disadvantage will eventually grow larger.1.) Tesla uses more Cobalt than other EV makers.2.) Tesla was unable to secure a long term contract with Ivanhoe Mines3.) Tesla does not offer a PHEV - a low cobalt alternative, 4.) GM is working on a battery chemistry with no Cobalt. 5.) All of the other ca makers sell millions of profitable vehicles and can sell EV s at a loss almost indefinitely. 6.) Tesla depends on EVs. January 2018 (((( When BMW AG revealed it was designing electric versions of its X3 SUV and Mini, the going rate for 21 kilograms of cobalt—the amount of the metal needed to power typical car batteries—was under $600. Only 16 months later, the price tag is approaching $1,700 and climbing by the day. ))))2018(( A big part of the GM plan is altering the chemistry of its EV batteries to eliminate cobalt, the most expensive component used in today’s batteries and one whose price on the world market is rising rapidly. ))(*) The actual cost disadvantage is unknown. The $1,000 figure comes from Bloomberg there is not way to verify it. (**) Most long term contracts provide for material cost increases. In the case of Panasonic and Tesla one of these parties has likely taken on the risk. If Panasonic offered Tesla a fixed price for the cells then Panasonic priced the risk into the cells. If there is a clause in the contract that allows Panasonic to pass along material price increases - then Tesla will pay more for the cells. Of course, either party can hedge Cobalt prices in the short term. Panasonic would have hedged Cobalt for the duration of the contract with Tesla. One way Panasonic might hedge the price of Cobalt would be with a long term contract with their suppliers. If Panasonic can contractually pass on price increases to Tesla based on commodity prices then Panasonic might go for a long term contract with their suppliers to get lower prices. And now Panasonic can increase prices to Tesla even though they are not paying more for Cobalt."
I've a feeling that tesla's big sp days are over
"Tesla's BOD claim they are concerned about El Ron's drug use. In Muskratland speech that translates to:We tried to contain him and direct Tesla in the best interests of shareholders, and customers, but we can't control his drug habit/s.

What will happen to Tesla's carbon credits it used to sell to auto manufacturers now that they are producing their own EV's?
is there any truth to the rumor that Musk is being investigated for violating the foreign corrupt practices act?

"((( Ark's Cathie Wood explains how bitcoin could increase by $400,000 )))Her logic: She thinks bitcoin is a ""big idea"" and therefore it is worth about $6 trillion dollars. I am not even making this up. Here's the logic: (( “Bitcoin is only [at] roughly a $600 billion market cap,” Wood says. “So even half the size of Apple or Amazon, right now. Doesn't that put it into perspective? And yet, it is a very big idea, I think. A much bigger idea than Apple or Amazon.” ))"
Why is this down so much?? Didn't investment banks have 800-900 price targets recently??
"Shorts on here any indication, they have low quality long stocks and value traps.Longs have Apple, Amazon, Tesla etc."
"I had been watching Tesla for years, but never touched the stock because it did not trade in a normal fashion. I knew Elon exagerated everything. The first time I ever believed anything he said was his April 2018 comment... ""We are bankrupt""That's when I took my first short. It has been tough because of the looney far-leftist cultists and the 80% ownership by insiders and institutional funds that keep propping it up. Sometimes I wanted to bang my head against the wall, and once I completely covered with losses. But now I am healthy in the money in a big way. Likely no more frustrations-- Not this time"

Not selling one single share as this is stored value!!!!!! Tesla price will triple
"Notice as this stock threatens to go below 300, mysterious buyers appear to guarantee a close above 300. Those mysterious buyers are IMHO Tesla held and funded holding companies that are charged with preventing the stock from closing under 300. Loans made to companies that use their own stock as collateral are callable if the stock declines below a certain value. 300 seems to be the magic number for Tesla loans. If they are called, the company will be forced to sell stock and a deep downward spiral will commence toward the true value."
how come it is up in premarket?
shorts quiet rn
Your dreams are over. PE 1200??? Good night.

Congratulations to Elon Musk for becoming the worlds richest person. I cannot think of a more deserving person today for his incredible contributions in leading industrial and scientific sectors. He is most deserving of any and all Person of the Year awards. We need more people like him.

There is no one to service my Tesla unless I pay a service ranger $1500.00 to come out.
No one will choose a nio car over a Tesla or other brands like Audi Porsche bmw or Mercedes people will want high luxury quality cars not some poorly made Chinese car it’s even bad calling nio a luxury car it should’ve be referred to that $TSLA $NIO
This is a precursor of how the green new deal will work out.

I am missing the point. Tesla is a spaceship company with mining rights on Mars. Whatever!"
Please let it gap open tomorrow. Will be buying puts.
Shorts panicking! lol

"It seems that everyone is interested in the EV industry these days. Apple, Amazon, Google, Baidu, and names I never heard of before. As the attack intensifies, Tesla (the leader in this industry) invests in crypto currency, an area questionable to many investors. In fact my bank does not even allow me to buy crypto. But, the point is that Tesla should use every penny to solidify its leadership in the EV industry. Private investors like myself can make their own decision to invest in crypto or any other stocks.Everyone makes mistakes and I think Tesla just made one with this Bitcoin investment IMHO"
"Tesla got loads of cash, but not enough to pay their staff during this shutdown. They have been asked to take holiday. Just what you need a holiday in a shut down state in February in a Pandemic."

They lost $900M this year but the stock is up over 100% for the year? This is why I will never understand the stock market. I will stick with dividend paying stocks that make a ton of money and share the earnings.
"NIO to start new brand, for lower price cars in China. Great marketing ploy, as the different name will not tarnish the high perception of it's currents products. Tesla has ""talked"" about a $25K variant, but hasn't seemed to have progressed the product. For supposedly being a nimble company, Tesla sure seems to be moving slow. Musk was to reveal the production intent Cyber Truck in November. Roadster? Semi?"
Monday: Up or down?
Tesla back to $300. Overvalued. Nio is going to take over the EV world. I drove a Tesla in 2012 and nothing much has changed. Not innovative at all. Just created new models with same technology.
"firmware update confirmed to have rolled out starting yesterday, claims to be reducing stopping distances by over twenty feet."
"If you put one million in $AMZN, $NFLX, $TSLA, $MSFT three years ago, you already doubled up that one mil."
"I'm new here, but have a sincere question....Will the cost of borrowing $100,000 to buy a Tesla car increase if interest rates rise? I really like the blue one."
"Tesla Berlin will get the go ahead, but at a price. Don't yet know what that'll be, but incensed German's get pretty charged up (and vindictive). I live between Boston and Munich and this is a big story in Germany.Politicians can't let (what they regard as) Tesla hubris go unpunished. They could restrict water supply, which certainly would reduce output. They could also charge Tesla exorbitant annual fees for a myriad of violations. Germans also see the $323 million annual lease that Tesla pays China just to set up shop there, and they feel a bit had. I think next month's ruling will probably irk a lot of Tesla investors (and it won't help Tesla's valuation either)."
So Tesla made more profit from Bitcoin than selling cars all year round from which they make zero profit

$TSLA will be added to the S&P 500 in one shot on December 21 rather than in tranches. S&P will announce the company Tesla will be replacing on December 11
"We’re at the point where Model 3 and Model Y are the most dated looking and spec’d offerings in the EV market space. Think 1980s Ford Taurus, they were cool ——> for awhile......."
"What would you rather own, a BMW EV or Tesla?"
Are we shorting again mates? I'll cover tomorrow then...
Fisher-Price and Hasbro have been making electric cars a long time......now tesla is trying to steal their idea!!
Bottom line - these analysts don’t know any more than we do. They simply work for the benefit of their firms.
"200,000 Teslas sold in America where the average driver travels 30 miles a day thats 6,000,000 gasoline free miles. Average mpg is 22 so that is 300,000(roughly) gallons of gasoline per day not burned. Thats not nothing! Add in Bolt Volt Prius all the other models coming out we are talking a serious hit to oil companies! The cats out of the bag and there is no putting it back."
Elon for Pope!
"Will Elon Musk be listed on Tesla's next 10K as ""Known Risks""?"
If you visit the board more than once a month...I feel sorry for you. Hold Tesla until you retire. It really is that simple and ignore the noise.
"Oppenheimer raised its price target on Tesla to $1,036 from $486."
He is tripping over himself trying to justify the valuation.
"Here is the way how I see things. TSLA is one of the most shorted stocks. However, when the time comes for it to blast off, it will be a straight up gap (hopefully 20%) squeezing shorts out at the same time. that will be the day.... just be patient...."
Teflon hired VP engineering from Snapchat to start a dating service for Tesla.
I am watching right now on tv a commercial add for a Opel Corsa EV with rechargable battery in 30 minutes for 169 euro/month.Competition for Tesla in 2021 is unprecedented.
How shorts feel here amongst all the longs.
Panic started
Sell TSLA and buy SILVER
"after nio day presentation, it seems nio will pass tsla soon."
I am playing with the house’s money and laughing at all shorts and analysts who missed out.
PE is 1375.
The stock will be able to be shorted today there’s no way that it can maintain an open level of 22 points especially with everything else that’s being sold off￼
"Post your estimate of the revenues and net loss/profit for Q3!Mine is: revenues -> $6,2b and net loss of $250m"
"The shorts that said that the tesla factory is only able to produce 6000 cars a week... DONT make me laugh...LOL... Tesla has expanded the factory and it is much bigger than the old plant. Tesla has the most advanced production line with high tech robots with the help of grohmann engineering that have experience building automation line for big automotive companies like bmw,daimler and etc....Tesla acquired this company few years ago.. Comparing the current production line to the old production line 10 years ago are like comparing the nokia brick phone that are capable only of text message and call with the current smart phone"
I wouldn’t buy this @800.....pre split.
"The only think that is ""secured"" is some jail time for Musk"
"Tesla recently filed a fresh recall of up to 36,126 imported Model S and Model X vehicles in China because of touch-screen failures - the latest after several rounds of recalls in 2020 - which analysts said would slightly impact its branding in the world's largest car market, but reflects the brand's ignorance in understanding Chinese consumers."
"Elon Musk on twitter: ""SpaceX needs to pass through a deep chasm of negative cash flow over the next year or so to make Starlink financially viable. Every new satellite constellation in history has gone bankrupt. We hope to be the first that does not."" So Elon setting up the perfect excuse to start selling some of his shares. I would suggest longs start selling before he does!"
"Thank you to Elon Musk for making me look like an effing genius when in fact, I just got lucky. Up about 15K in 2 days."
tesla will be $175 by Friday!!!!
"Even the best growing companies miss on earnings at times, i.e. Amazon, Paypal, etc. etc. etc. No big deal. Strong buy TSLA on weakness because the weakness won't last."
"Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, has made a huge splash in the world of Bitcoin after one of his companies, Tesla (TSLA), revealed that it spent $1.5 billion on the premier decentralized digital currency. This news hit the cryptocurrency space like a bomb, with the valuation of Bitcoin jumping up by more than $10,000, breaking previous records for the highest-ever valuation of the currency.

I'll bet everyone is excited Tesla is in the S&P. Now everyone gets a ride.
is going to touch 260 again?

Something strange in premarket it seems recovering and inching up after nasdaq and Dow were deeply down. Any explanation. Seems like it will open green!
"I live in Rhode Island and I definately have started to see Teslas pretty much every day. So that pretty much proves Tesla is worth $45 billion. Except that I see a lot more Fords every day and people didn't wait 2 years for them, they aren't falling apart, and they can get parts and service for them. So that must prove Ford is a trillion dollar company."
I am new here. Does anyone know how much the battery weighs?
Soon it will be 1000 and split into 50. I'm worried about the lives of short sellers.

I know I am getting a little ahead of myself since they have not even reached 5k per week yet but what is the new planned date to reach 10k per week? Originally it was this month if I remembered correctly. Then it was moved to sometime this year. But with all of the delay in reaching 5k per week I was not sure if it got pushed out further. Will it require any additional lines? We are already @ 3 lines to be able to reach 5k per week.
Still holding Tesla did very well for me
I wonder if anyone over at Vanguard - $VOO is disappointed that the s&p committee did not add $TSLA. They lost a TON of customers when the announcement came out.
"So, if $TSLA specifically told their employees to lie about cars being ready to get customers to pay and sign paperwork so they could be financially delivered to pad numbers even though the car actually wasn't there, this would be a pretty big deal wouldn't you say?"
I wonder how many of the M3 deposits were from China?
Investment idea...buy a Tesla model X and put it away for the 2050 Barrett Jackson auction ....what do you estimate the price of a vintage X in like new condition in 2050 to the collector market???
"Shorting this Wall Street ponzi scheme is financial suicide.It has been the closest bet to a sure thing as I have seen in 23 years of trading. The way Wall Street has made billions on it has been pure genius. The recipe is simple. Great story, under promise over deliver, create ongoing short squeezes and have bought and paid for analysts keep upgrading their price targets so Wall St can make massive banking fees for each raise. As for the analysts particularly Ives who went to school with he can sell ice to an eskimo. No-one can articulate the #$%$ valuation story better than him. He could convince someone that OJ is innocent. This ponzi scheme will not end until either the Fed or bond vigilantes make an attempt to protect the currency with interest rates hitting a point that matters. What bothers me is all the posts from retail shorts who keep fighting this and losing real money. My advice is to stop fighting. Its a rigged game. The fix is in. To the longs particularly Elon. Congrats and a job well done. Happy trading"
"Okay, I amend my forecast for 2021. With Bitcoin speculation, it is entirely possible TSLA will make GAAP earnings in 2021. Of course, It's not a a source of income that is predictable. I can see how a con man would like the Bitcoin investment. It's like going to Vegas with the stockholders money. If he wins, he says, see we really are profitable company will real GAAP earnings. If he loses, he says, well on a ""adjusted earnings"" basis we will add back our gambling losses. Either way, it enable him to disguise loses from the car business.I never said Musk wasn't smart."
"pe ratio=1405 at current pps level, don't see how it can sustain. will check at the end of year."
Thank God I took some of my Apple after it split and plowed it into Tesla before it split! Long and STRONG!!!
Will those car-carriers be jack-knifed proof too?
guess it's time for analysts to raise all their targets based on absolutely nothing again
"This stock needs to chill, there’s zero catalyst on it, go buy some crypto"
"Instead of hearing ""How your predecessors did it and got lucky, consider yourselves lucky the stock market is irrational and moving up!!,, Enjoy while it lasts....make the best of it.. A very rare opportunity. We are all lucky in this respect. Prepare to tell your stories, including the pandemic and politics to your successors..... Yep. Who knew we would experience all of this in our lifetime????"
Are you accounting the fact that 2020 was not a normal year? 350k vehicles sold is more than welcomed
"It should gap down tomorrow opening around 790. The support of 825 is broken and the next one is at 740-750. I don't expect that to be broken before earnings. However, earnings this time might give a little positive surprise due to record deliveries. Depending on earnings, this could be below 700 or above 900 in first week of Feb."

"Instead of all the Damage Control staff at Tesla, you'd think they'd hire one or two Quality Control ..............https://www.consumeraffairs.com/automotive/tesla_motors.html"
A whole new pack of buyers are probably waiting at 288. It may be too much to ask to break that level today when already down 13 points.
"The $35k M3 was just a Tesla bait and switch tactic popularized by Sears in the 60's. Oh, we don't have any of the one as advertised in stock but we do have this nicer one available."
1014 per week ... 954 per week .... 834 per week ... 622 per week < ===== doesn't look like a production issue If it was a production issue then it would have been addressed and the number would have increased. At the very worst the number would have dropped and leveled off. I can't think of a production issue that would cause the number to go down progressively for 3 weeks in a row.
"Tesla is a good example of the limitlessness of human greed. Imagine a person owning a business that, for two decades, had never earned a profit. The business finally turns profitable, earning less than $300 for the year (with similar few hundred dollar profits projected for the coming years); the owner is offered $660,000 for the business. Instead of grabbing such a generous valuation offer, some people would go crazy with greed and respond, ""I'm going to hold out of $1.2 million!"" or ""I'm going to wait for a $20 million offer!"""
"Tesla Gets Street-High $810 Price Target From Morgan StanleyGood luck and GOD bless,"
Tesla is selling new cars that you have to bring back to the service center for months while they let you use their used inventory cars. So you are paying a new car for driving a used car.
"All you Tesls shorters should give it up already before you end up losing ANOTHER $38 Billion of your money in 2021. It's only the first trading day of the year and you're already losing money, that's a bad omen right there!"
"Probably, Tesla reached the top. Maybe Ford is a better investment at this point."
"ARKK still buying $PYPL & $TSLA. These are not short term accumulations and being done with confidence of profit. I have and am in both, TSLA being the only stock I admitting have shorted in the past; no more. With PYPLs estimated value and record of earnings, I am miffed that it is not jumping. Investors need to stop comparing it to SQ and unhinge analysis fro Crypto movement. The run to $385 will commence again if Dems will stop tearing down the bricks that have held up economic confidence!"
"If I wanted to go long Tesla, why would I buy it here with the stock up almost 70% YTD while we are in a deep recession and unemployment is surging? Seriously, can anyone provide a rational answer? Why not wait for the stock to fall to much lower levels before buying?"
STAY LONG HUGE YEAR AHEAD><>>>DOUBLING IN SALES WITH NO PANDEMIC EXPECT STRONG GUIDANCE FROM ELON THAT WILL PUSH STOCK HIGHER 1000
"the bots have taken over, they will push market to 2800, maybe 3000 then its SELL SELL SELL. it will be FUGLY once it all goes down, but that's what people deserve, just like 2008"
Boom! >330. Have a great weekend everyone!
"Never short explosive growth. Revenues are expected to grow at 50% a year for at least 5 years, Elon said 10."
God bless Elon Musk
"One bubble (TSLA) buying another bubble (bitcoin). Instead of doubling TSLA's R+D, which was about $1.5 billion last year, he put it into a vastly inflated ""asset"" at the very peak of its valuation. Don't look back Elon, they're gaining on you."
Bitcoin at 47k +6%. Tesla touching red. The link between the market belief in Bitcon and Tesla has been broken. Musk lost all credibility here.
If you can’t hold Tesla shares until the year of 2030. Sell it to someone who’s going long.
M3 orders are down to 2000 a week .....assembly lines shutting down early and going home...fact.
"Here we go ... Tesla 10 000 points, Bitcoin 500 000 points Let’s go strong earnings report we build biggest bubble ever , right !"
Alright guys I’ve joined the tsla bandwagon. At 835$ !Was it a good decision?
"Only 70 days ago Tesla was trading at half of this price. In these market conditions when stocks have increased so fast, normally you see a painful downward trend where still many believers will keep buying. When external factors will trigger a market correction is when Tesla will be shaken badly and landing brutally to 50-60/share."
Shorts didn’t realize the only people who sold yesterday were momentum traders. There’s not a long out there who would sell before earnings

Brace for $70-$100 drop days very SOON!!!
almost every company has electric car in market which will give tough time to tesla.
"News for price, not price for news - don't you know? Negative news are only for creating a mood for the stock to go down. No matter how serious news are. What direction they intended for - what is important. And Tesla is ready for correction."
"Even if earnings come in line with expectations or better, it is factual that Competition is massive in 2021.The future is going to be very bumpy for Tesla. All the carmakers are producing high quality EV in 2021."
why is it rising?
What's next? Tesla Organic Water? $5.95 per 12 oz bottle. These group-think (sic) lemmings are hilarious.
Most people on this board are not understanding the role low interest rates have played in soaring PEs. Even with the Fed plowing money into bonds the 10yr rate has jumped BIGLY to start the year. What this means is that companies have to increase earnings by the same amount or else stocks will plummet. Watch the interest rates VERY CLOSELY. If they keep rising at some level they will trigger a sell off.
Tsla quality flaws are a big problem for the brand

Good Mornin' future TSLA millionaires! Up 20 bucks already and the market isn't even open. Congrats on hitting $400.00++++ today. Next week back over $500.00 then onto $750.00 by year end.
"guys!!BofA analyst John Murphy raised the firm's price target on Tesla to $900 from $500 and keeps a Neutral rating on the shares. The stock is ""driven by growth afforded by valuation,"" said Murphy, who has tried to estimate what the current stock price affords to Tesla in terms of incremental plants and units and what those incremental units translate into in incremental revenue and profits. Building automotive industry capacity is expensive and often generates low returns, but ""the higher the upward spiral of Tesla's stock goes, the cheaper capital becomes to fund growth, which is then rewarded by investors with a higher stock price,"" argues Murphy."
Tesla was marginal without competition and made their money selling green energy credits.Now the companies that were buying those credits are making their own EVs and no longer need to buy them from Tesla.Tesla is about to turn unprofitable again.The share price will follow.
Gordon Johnson is there for comedic relief.
"$1500 in memory of Nikola Tesla, happy birthday bro!"
"Tesla is also unusual in the way it reports some of its key financial metrics. When calculating gross margins — the sales price of a car minus the direct costs of manufacturing — traditional carmakers include research, development and engineering costs. Tesla does not, which tends to make its margins look better."
"""I made so much money at some point but I didn't sell..."""
"Elon musk is under investigation for manipulating the stocks market with his Twitter post. Selling my 50 shares when market is open, shall see what happen in the next few days."
I think TESLA stock will reach 1000$ in january.
"As Ford, GM, BMW and other auto manufacturers ramp up EV's, they will NOT have to buy the ZEV credits from Tesla. Therefore, almost a billion per year will disappear for Tesla. On top of that, there are no tax credits for any of Tesla's vehicles anymore because of the numbers sold. Tesla hasn't earned a dime yet. They have billions in losses and would be totally unprofitable if it wasn't for the ZEV. They don't compete, they are subsidized.However, the stock is just an idea, like BTC. Shorting this is a Fools errand at this point."
"Tesla has confirmed that its next quarterly earnings report will be published on Wednesday, January 27th, 2021. Tesla will be holding an earnings conference call on Wednesday, January 27th.It will be amazing!!!! I will buy a couple of shares on Monday!!!"
Don't bet against Elon Musk. In conventional terms the stock is over priced but Elon and all his companies under the Tesla banner are worth five times as much. Elon is just getting started.

"At some point suppliers will start asking for payments up front if Tesla doesn’t start to make money and can’t borrow anymore except at high interest rates. Debt is death in a rising interest rate environment. Then orders start being cancelled, deposits returned, and the whole company collapses into bankruptcy. Can happen very quickly as it did in 2008 and 2009 to many. Tesla has a limited window to show profit."
"what can you say about the market and some of these stocks. just amazing. I do think we are very over stretched. At some point, this will correct. nobody cared about profits in 98/99 either. was all about growth. but then reality hit. profits do matter. at these prices and no down days in sight, Musk should sell $10s of billions in shares for a war chest. They will need the money for the growth they need to justify a 100p/e, let alone a 1000 p/e"
"The question for anti-tesla fanboys… What happens if tesla flips to profitability this quarter? What happens if they meet their increased projection for production goals? What happens if they blow away the numbers given the cost reduction measures they’ve been using? Given how hard it is to knock this down on a relentless series of attacks, what do you think happens to this stock?"
2023 I think TSLA will hit $1T market cap as Elon Musk reasoned last earnings call. That's a pretty good investment to me!
"Model 3 production 4,450 < ==== scratch that - it's now 4,404 and falling Q.) Why are they cutting production while 400,000 US consumer wait ?A.) Selling the Model 3 for $35,000 will create huge losses so they are delaying the launch and also stripping the base Model 3."
"Just wondering... since all the supply chain VP and Directors have left the company... If a major supplier demands COD, and they are already 100 days in arrears of pmts from Tesla--- Who will do the negotiating on behalf of Tesla to get the needed components?OH WAIT!

"TSLA is going down because shorts are borrowing and then shorting, now there aren't any shares available for shorts to borrow. Watch and learn."

"Telsa options players again took a major haircut after earnings, despite Tesla being up by 2% most calls have lost 50-80% of their value and puts up to 96% The only ones making out are the Wall St hedge funds who sold them to you at a massively inflated price"
Food for thought.Tesla an $850 stock has an EPS of $0.64 per share.GE an $11 stock has an EPS of $0.58 per share.GM a $54 stock has an EPS of $2.23 per share.AAPL a $155 stock has an EPS of $3.70 per share.I don't think Tesla is overvalued at all.

How far can Tesla fall. Musk said Tesla was overvalued around May where adjusting for stock split was around $150 per share. So it can go down another 400-500 bucks and still remain in the overvalued range.
"This is not a stock with any business potential. Nobody thinks about Tesla's future in revenues or profit, but what Mr Musk will do in his next tweet. Enjoy the bubble while it lasts."
We got a taste of the crash today. Just a taste.
"Seriously, what is the big deal about producing 500,000 cars?"
Elon Musk said there are two things stressing him out most: production delays with the Tesla Model 3 and the dangers of artificial intelligence.The CEO is flat out warning you guys right there that there will be production delays again. Gotta be blind to miss it.

"Howdy Folks!As of Friday, we hit a 1 trillion dollar market cap here.That's taking into account the fully diluted shares outstanding!End of Quarter 3 numbers there were roughly 1.105 billion shares outstanding. equaling 976 Billion Dollar market cap!Now take the extra shares outstanding we were slightly over 1 trillion dollar market cap!That's a WOW!Considering when you take the top 18 auto manufactures with their 836 Billion Dollar market cap combined!Plus they make 1.7 Trillion dollars a year in revenue!I'm sorry folks I don't think Tesla will ever make that much money!"

"If Tesla were the ONLY car company in the world then MAYBE it might be worth $785 billion. But, it isn't. In fact, it is trading at roughly 16 times the high estimate of 2021 REVENUES! That is beyond insane."
"Dissident. Tesla casts the body parts. Unless it’s pressing molten metal, there’s no press. And as far as other car manufacturers “late to EV”, my neighbors benn driving a BMW EV for over a year now. And Toyota’s hybrid Prius has been around at least 5 yrs. they’re not late . There is no sense of urgency. The Texas disaster is a clear case why NOT to buy an EV. BTW ask someone with a TESLA what it cost to charge their car. $50 to $80. Every week. I can fill up my Toyota for$30. And drive over 450 miles. It’s just a toy and loosing its attraction . Going down very hard. The longer you wait to get out the more it’s gonna hurt."

Buying BLNK. They have over 1500 electric vehicle charging stations in US and growing fast. Should be the new gas stations !
The only moat Tesla has is Elon's Tweeter account. See how strong it is.
"Back in December, with TSLA trading around it's current range, I thought it was grossly over priced. But overpriced stocks with upward momentum can become even more over priced. And that is what happened.TSLA even touched above $900/share. But no TSLA is a broken momentum stock. It wasn't able to hold above $900 for more than a moment and within a few trading days it broke below $800. The first two weeks of February proved that TSLA could no longer be counted on to close above $800.By the third week of February, TSLA dropped below $700 never closed above $800.The fourth week of February, TSLA has not closed above $700 once.This drop is faster than I had expected in the absence of any actual news. Possibly the stimulus checks will be squandered by recipients in buying more TLSA, which could give the stock something of a boost, but, smart money is clearly heading for the exists.Why would you want to be the last one out?"
"Another one bites the dust:Tesla Treasurer and VP of Finance Leaves the CompanyMore stories by Dana HullMarch 13, 2018, 6:30 PM CDTTesla Inc.’s corporate treasurer and vice president of finance has left the electric-car maker, according to a person familiar with the matter.Susan Repo, who had worked at Tesla for about five years, left to become the chief financial officer of another company, said the person, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be named. Her departure follows Tesla’s disclosure last week that Chief Accounting Officer Eric Branderiz had left for personal reasons. Lyft Inc. also hired away Jon McNeill, former president of global sales and service, to become chief operating officer of the ride-hailing company in February."
It will be now time for many to balance portfolios. This valuation is now insane and not justified by any fundamental. Great company but bad stock. It has gone to high too fast and history should remind us this will not last forever and the correction can be brutal
"$880 wow.I’ve 20x my all in position and yet I’m not selling. I truly believe that this is the best company with the absolute best fundamentals long term than any other stock on the market. The reason being that I can see 10 years ahead and it is extremely bright. At a growth of more than 50% a year in car manufacturing alone. When you add the solar biz, storage,FSD, HVAC, and who knows what future products it’s mind boggling how massive this company will become. I honestly don’t care if the price drops short term. I’m all in for the next 10 years. Also, when starlink ipo’s, Tesla shareholders will get to buy before the opening. I will put have of everything in starlink and ride them both into the sunset. Happy ever after. Cheers!"
Board of Directors scared to co-sign Musk's lies. They don't want to legal exposure.
"Just sold all of my shares since may 2020, even if Tesla produces 22 million cars by 2035 with annual revenue of 1.2 trillion that’s only $60 in earnings per share, do I believe in musk and Tesla revolution I do, but it’s time to take profit and chill, thank you all and happy 2021"
"sold Visa, bought 1000 more TSLA this morning."
Just wait until another stock split is announced and all of you bashers and shorts will be buying in the stock just like last time to help drive the price higher... Once the stock split happens yes it will drop even further which is good because now a larger pool of investors can afford the stock to help propelling it up... This is a win-win for Tesla...

It’s unpatrotic to want this company at this stage to fail. This is 100% American company

Tesla up 23.66 % after the 5 days of the new year. I like a stock that pays me money to do nothing.
I really sympathize retail investors buying after the split. Stock split isn’t supposed to have any impact on the company value. The only thing it does is to attract inexperienced investors who think the stock is more affordable after the split. That’s when the harvest by institutions starts. $TSLA $AAPL
"don't forget during the sub prime housing crisis mortgage default rates were skyrocketing, there were red flags galore, yet the mortgaged backed bonds remained AAA and unchanged for 6 months+ , confusing many bears.

WOW! Time to Short! Watch out below...will begin now!
"How you can perceive Tesla out with the begging bowl, and stating in their letter that donations from suppliers are 'essential' to tesla's survival, as good news is beyond me. It reeks of utter desperation"
"Was a bad choice to invest in Crypto. I see tesla falling and Elon stripped as the richest person in the world title. Crypto is a collector's item with no intrinsic value. It's a scam, poor choice IMO"

"The INTC example. Cramer has said TSLA is like INTC whose stock price surged successively in the 1980's and 1990's as Intel came out with successive new ""generations"" of CPU: from 8088 to 80826 to 386 to 486 to Pentium, etc.. Large increases in the stock price were thus justified.But look at the chart.INTC doubles in price from Jan. 1982 to Jan. 1986 (4 years)INTC doubles again from Jan. 1986 to Jan 1990 (4 years)INTC doubles again from Jan 1990 to Jan. 1994 (4 years)INTC increases doubles twice from Jan 1994 to Jan 1998 (4 Years)INTC more than doubles again from Jan 1998 to Jan 2000 (2 years)INTC reaches peak of $75.81 in Apr. 2000 (more than doubling the price range of Jan. 1999)INTC never has exceeded that level again in the more than 20 years since and now trades around $50/share. Still, if one bought at the peak and held on, one would not have too bad a loss considering that INTL has been paying dividends.INTC might have been considered a ""bubble"" in 2000, but it's rise was quite measured and related to fundamental changes (like the introduction of new chips). TLSA has soared 10 times in little over 1 year without ANY fundamental improvements. It's just the hysteria of the investors. So, don't expect that the price of $750 will EVER be even approached again after the coming crash in the next 20 years."

Tesla has head start in this space!"
"So Tesla said the production was completely stooped for a few days in February. The illusion: It was stooped to prepare for the installation of robots from German. Effect: stock goes up almost $20.Next show, the production stooped for another few days. Illution: To install robots from German. Effect: (predicted), stock goes up more $$.Next next show, production stopped again to maximize new installed robots speed. Illution: Production will reach Mars. Effect: Stock up up in the Sky.The reality is, robot still being disassembled in German, production never stopped but advance at very slow pace and will never reach the speed to Mars, but never mind, I think David Copperfield work at Tesla."

Tesla got slayed today
Should we expect the market cap to increase proportionate to the number of vehicles sold or do you guys expect instead for 1.3 million per car to have 5 million per car when Tesla has 2 million cars delivered because they are taking over the galaxy and will have a monopoly on all the wheels?

"Musk has lost his MoJo. His announcements of products, services, factories, batteries, etc, all sometime in an ambitious distance future timeline (just beyond the attention span of the typical TSLA investor), has grown stale. The donkeys are no longer chasing the bigger carrot, on the longer stick. Tesla. Inc. will not reach ""One Trillion Dollars"" (don't forget the air-quotes). Building batteries in Bangelore, tunnels in Tampa, rockets on Roadsters, MuskCoin on Mars, have all fallen flat."
only 787k lost their jobs last week. much better than expected. tesla is going to 750

current polls for Elon Musk to stay as CEO is 97% for. There's no way he'll be booted from the position.
The company bought the Bitcoin (with board approval). Not Elon Musk. His 10 year compensation package is payable in stock options not cash. He (the major stock holder) now has 241 million shares (including options) of TSLA. He hasn’t sold any of that stock. If the stock goes down substantially for any reason he stands to lose a bunch more than $1.5 billion. On the other hand Jeff Bezos (for the last 2 decades) sells $1 billion of Amazon stock a year and puts it into Blue Origin Rockets. BO still hasn’t reached LEO.

"SHAREHOLDER ALERT : Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC Notifies Investors of Class Action Against Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) and Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 9, 2018ACCESSWIRE ACCESSWIRE•August 22, 2018NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / August 24, 2018 / Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC notifies investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed Tesla, Inc. (""Tesla"" or the ""Company"") (TSLA) and its CEO, Elon Musk (""Musk""),on behalf of shareholders who purchased or otherwise acquired Tesla securities between the now extended dates of August 7, 2018 to August 14, 2018, (the ""Class Period""). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm's site: www.bgandg.com/tsla.This class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.The complaint states that on August 7, 2018, Musk stated on Twitter: (1) ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420;"" (2) ""Funding secured;"" (3) ""Shareholders could either to sell at 420 or hold shares & go private;"" and (4) ""Investor support is confirmed."" Following these tweets, Tesla shares went up as much as $45.47 per share, or 13%, during intraday trading before closing at $379.57 on August 7, 2018.Since then, both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla's board of directors are reportedly investigating the truth of Musk's tweets, and whether in fact funding had been secured. Several large investors and banks have said that they are unaware of any funding. Following the news of these investigations Tesla stock has dropped to close at $355.49 per share on August 10, 2018.The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) contrary to Musk's statements that funding had been ""secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 per share, no such funding had been secured; and (2) contrary to Musk's statement that investor support to take Tesla private ""is confirmed,"" there was no such confirmation.The complaint continues to allege that on August 13, Musk tweeted ""I'm excited to work with Silver Lake and Goldman Sachs as financial advisors . . . on the proposal to take Tesla private."" However, on August 14, Bloomberg issued an article titled ""Goldman Is Said to Have No Mandate When Musk Tweeted,"" and said that neither entities were working with Musk when Musk wrote that the firms were advising him.A class action lawsuit has already been filed.

just placed an order for a Model Y....woo hoo
What do people here think about Tesla investments in bitcoin. I feel like people are just fueled by memes and tweets. Bitcoin is the opposite of reducing carbon footprint. It doesn't make sense on a ecological point of view. Wouldn't you agree?here is an article explaining this a bit https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275243/teslas-bitcoin-purchase-clashes-climate-change-mission
Enron is creating a culture of systemic corruption
"Who else thinks TSLA stalls here? The ""fast money"" that chased TSLA can now be coverted into ""short busting"" stocks with a 50-100% return in a day. Why settle for a couple percent a day"
Can you feel the Squeeze....................
Still some time to get out.
"""tesla is five years ahead of the competition"", ok so at a 40% growth rate yoy in five years that means Tesla will have to deliver just under 2 million vehicles to sustain it's current growth. At $100k/average selling price (very unlikely) per vehicle that is ONLY 192 Billion in salesHow can this company be worth this much if in five years when competition catches up, they'll only be able to produce and deliver $200 Billion worth of sales.Meanwhile ford has capacity and sales to deliver 6.6 million vehicles and investors don't care"
TSLA is now facing serious competition from NIO in China. I believe in few years from now NIO will be outselling more EV than TSLA. In China of course.
Lucky my hands are made of diamonds! Phew! Been a rough week but been there and done that many times! I look forward to the bulls run (stampede) that will follow. Good luck longs!
"From the Skabooshka twitter board....a recent buyer ofa model 3 that was produced in may posted photos of a really poor paint job...this is what he stated""My model 3 is a May production. I just shared my paint defects on TMC. I’ve got serious issues with cracks all over the vehicle. When they get wet they bleed what looks like rusty water.Love the car but makes me a bit sad. $TSLA has fixed some but I keep finding more randomly."""
hold and let the shorts talk... they always lose at the end
What will be symbol when the company name change Tent Motors ????
"I believe in the EV revolution and that TESLA is a great company. But when SP often move up sharply by the CEO's irrevelant postings on twitter, I think it's not unreasonable to start asking whether this is a hype or the real deal."
Bagholders bought the dip in $500 and spent all their powder. This means $500 will be over in an instant and we see $400 next. Then the next wave of bagholders will keep buying until we go to $100. GLTA. It's going to be a bumpy ride but we all know what always happens to bubbles.
Elon Musk becomes the richest person in the world after leaving California...Go figure.
That is much better. Down a dollar every ten minutes is a very nice exit rate. Keep up the good work!
"900 today, sure I’ll take that!"
"I have been long tsla, till a friend of mine bought a Tesla car, I could not believe my self when he show me the option where the car can FART literally, I sold my holding, then went short on the stock, my reason was if the car car fart, obviously it's full of #&%$, excuse the language."
Last chance for morning discounts before we see a new high
+5% today
short-term gain is 50% in my point opinion at $1000 by mid-year. I went in at $670 and I am very excited. You never want to buy at the top and savvy investors buy at the dip. Good luck everyone and let's ride this all together.
"$20 in 2018, followed by bankruptcy in late 2018 or early 2019."
sony revealed its autodriving technology. Its combination with Japanese car makers will compete with TSLA. TSLA faces a tough time ahead.
"ARK sold 100K shares today, just FYI. Good luck to all."
"The shorts need the world to burn in order to make money. Panic selling is based on fear and I hope many of you took advantage of it. With a low of 511 yesterday and then 600+ in premarket, the likes of Morgan Stanley got what they wanted from TSLA and many other stocks. TSLA has so much support above 785 and it can get back faster than the drop over the past few days. The same reasons it got it up to $950+ is the same momentum that will drive it right back up extremely fast when bullish volume returns. The bonus: Model Y deliveries begin today. Today, AMD, APPL, TSLA, NIO have the most bullish volume in premarket....if you bought any of these yesterday, you're already up 10%+ from their yesterday's lows. If you're waiting for the bottom, stop listening to the media frenzy. No one can time the bottom perfectly. What happened in 2008 and 1987 and other huge selloffs are not always the same...and this past week's drop is very different. The virus fear and potential impact to the economy is causing panic, largely induced by the media and a president who doesn't have the ability to calm a nation. Our economy is very healthy and this is not a correction whatsoever. People want to call it that because they've been hoping the world burns so their short positions make some money. The demand for products from $TSLA, $AMD, $AAPL, $NIO are going to continue to change the world and their innovation is why their value is going to keep climbing in the near and long term. The virus will not stop their business. We're not in a plague or apocalypse...keep this perspective. You've got a 50% discount on almost every stock and you're going to make 50% back within a month IMO...likely faster as many know the recent highs of TSLA and others that hit before the virus fear. No other reason for any of the price drops....no recalls, no product failures, no sensational fraud......all of these companies were and are at the top of their game. You are the market...so you decide the price of a stock. Buy and just hold. Never sell in a dip. It's really that simple. Keep buying and holding TSLA and AMD, AAPL, NIO...any others you believe in. Mute the shorts...they only come out when it gets dark....like cockroaches."
"according to the shorts tesla stock managed to ""dead cat bounce"" it's way to the top! along with the help of market manipulation and elons tweets about, well, FACTS"
Somehow I don't think that we'll hit $530 today.I guess we'll have to wait another week.da? What do you think.
Oh and the line is shutting down temporary!!! Oh this is so rich.....
Roadster 2.0 to BK 0 to 60 in 1.9 Seconds
Hyundai Kona EU sales ====> UP 317% in Europe Tesla Model 3 EU sales ====> DOWN 33% BTW the Europeans are heavily subsidizing EV sales now to stimulate the economy. That is not sustainable. And even with the heavy subsidies Tesla sales are falling.
EVs will take Market Shares from ICE companies!!!!! This is what people and Shorties don't seem to understand!!! EVs are competing against ICE cars!!! You better recognize it!!!
HAHAHAHAHAH oh man
"1) Elon said at end of Q1, Tesla had significant delivery issues and used that as an excuse for the lowly 63K salesBut then, why has he not delivered more than 10K globally so far in April?2) Elon kept guidance intact, saying 90K+ deliveries in Q2But how can he do that when he hasn't sold 10K by April 24? Is he going to deliver 40K in May and 40K in June?3) Elon warned that Q1 would be a loss. And today he said Q2 will also be a loss. But, he said 3Q and 4Q will be strong in the profit.But how can that be with less subsidies, no new models, and an already satisfied population of M3 buyers?Don't be a gullible lemming!"
What do we think is going to happen after earnings report? massive dip?
"Well I’ll say one thing: the CPA’s in both Canada and the USA are delighted with Tesla. Once the 10Q comes out, there will be thousands of newly minted Yahoo accountants parsing every single word. Will be an epic battle between bulls and bears!I’ll go out on a limb, there probably had never been a 10Q in history that will be as examined so thoroughly!"
tsla had 1.2 bilion shares800 bilion to that companyyy????bubblleee
Which way is better in Georgia for Tesla? And why?
"U.S. safety regulators have asked Tesla to recall 158,000 vehicles... Ya, right, good luck with that. We all know Musk prioritizes profits over people."
"Hey Tesla shorters, I've made $122K YTD from going long on Tesla. How much have YOU made from shorting YTD?"
If only they could get the panel gap corrected. Everyone complains about that and it's easy to fix.
"As per my understanding, Musk and TSLA used the semi-truck and roadster unveiling to attract easy deposit-money from potential customers. Then again, is he and TSLA now not obliged to set up 2 additional productionlines for these two vehicle-types?Where are the money from that going to come from?"
"Tesla’s $25,000 electric car could be coming sooner than we thoughtGood luck and GOD bless,"
One month chart looks a lot like Model 3 production ramp
"Tesla loses about $80 million per week. Assuming they have a 25% margin on Model 3, with an average selling price of $50K, if they sell 5,000 per week, they'll make $62.5 million. So, Tesla has to sell 6,400/wk just to break even, and not increase capex spending. New factory in China, new factory/assembly lines for Semi and Roadster? It's not looking good even with the most optimistic scenario possible. BWAHHAHAHHAHHA!"
Just 2 month ago Elon said 250Mile car range does not make sense and cancel and now he bringing back. Clearly he lied and try to sell as many 50K+ as possible before bringing back.Not sure how such person treated so good way. Normally if GM or Ford do that we would have backlash.World sure going worst way. Regarding Stock price. Sure I am poorer by almost 50K if this remain inflated (May be even $90k if remain high) but atleast I fight for sanity. People are working to make thing worst. End of day those dollar will worth 1/10th anyway.
"Note to all. CA was on target for ""clean air"" but failed miserably on vehicle emissions. Maybe if all of the electric car owners had to pay for their electricity that would be a real fete! I get taxed for ""solar"" as a part of my electricity bill when I don't even have solar. That is how CA puts it to the little guy who lives in a apartment!"
"Remember Tesla shorters, the more Tesla shares you short now, the more you're going to have to buy back later at a higher price in order to cover your position, and the poorer you'll become!"
"TSLA patent for Lithium Metal / Anode free batteries yesterday is going to solidify it's lead even further, dominating all kinds of batteries for all kinds of purposes. It's the ""elephant in the room"". This is NOT just another E-car maker by a long stretch!"
apple car with elons arch enemy Gates backing it. this will get interesting.
Bought 20 shares yesterday at 656. Should I sell at market open or this will go over 700$ today?
I just understood it. Tesla isn't a car company. Its a software SaaS and energy company. The real TAM is over 20t. If they get even 10% then it's 2t valuation
Look at nio chart and other big tech charts. All had huge dip at 11:10
"poor oil dealers, F,GM, Xom, ......."
The real collapse has just started. Selling will accelerate until all your left with is 1.5 billion in Bitcoin. My bad that's Elon's money.
Nepotism is a red flag. A company where a CEO hires his brother to be on the board & later votes to bail out a co. run by their cousins - that is a red flag in a red flag. The fact that $TSLA longs continue to ignore warning signs shows that no red flag is big enough for them
VERY odd the company is reporting tomorrow Oct 24 instead of their usual Nov date......there is a reason but not sure what that might be? Anyone care to guess?
"Tesla should buy a part of facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Twitter and you don't buy only Tesla...no, no, you buy a stock and a fund and so much more...A bunch of ponzi..."
Keep talking. While Tesla keeps producing and performing. We are just getting started.

"And why didn't Elon announce at the results, that he was getting rid of a huge number of workers? Because it would have tanked the stock. It will tank on Monday anyway."
bankrupt before 2020 imo
"Not only does NIO give 1000km with the new 150kW battery since it's replaceable you can upgrade your car with the new one.Tesla will crash not because I want to, but because this is a huge milestone of the competition."
C'mon LONGS! We can do it up to $1000+
"So would you hold the stock or sell half, keep half. Talking 200+ shares holding which makes up 50% of portfolio....risky I know"
"I hope the TSLA Faithful understand there's absolutely no breakthrough technology in TSLA's BEVs.Battery powered transportation vehicles, over 100 year old tech.TSLA is nothing but modernized century old technology"

How are the model 3's coming along? If I wanted to buy one today when might I be able to pick it up? 3-5 years?
"If I'm not mistaken, Tesla does not report monthly sales. So, what is the most reliable source for the monthly sales data?"
"Does Tesla hold these bitcoin as ""available for sale"", ""held for trading"", or ""held to maturity""?? This affects their accounting and whether Tesla records fluctuations of bitcoin in their income statement or not. Also, why did they not also purchase Dogecoin? Thats better than Bitcoin."
"Yep, that vast international market has not been tapped...not even a bit. The ad based TV programming and streaming should be very attractive and a huge revenue generator for $ROKU $TSLA $QQQ $AAPL $NFLX $MSFT"
If there is such a large reservation list for all of TSLA products why are they pricing lower than competition? Makes no sense...large line all the time for Apple IPhone....they do not price under competition out of the gate......something is suspicious and does not add up here...
Heading to 1000 by next week As Elon Musk said details next week

"Ever watch a Shark Tank episode where the owner/inventor is super passionate about their cause? So passionate they have borrowed money from every family member they know, and are now so desperate for an offer that they are in tears with the thought that all their thought and sweat equity may amount to nothing and the reality they may never be able to pay family and friends back, but deep down inside, they just know it will work....if they only had more cash from an investor......that’s Tesla."
How much of the $4.19 do I get for my dividend? Nice for them to put it in parentheses so I could find it on the financial statement.
"$1,000 this month"
"Dummies were saying '$1000 on open' - phahah you know NOTHING, just pure finger in the air predictions based on past Tesla hype."

I would expect a massive pressure today...158.000 cars without service department and it is 25% of whole year production. Theat will end badly today.
It seems that that jump in the morning was a temporary condition after all.Kind of like a glitch in the Matrix.
"Roll all my put to 760 strike expire 1/22. Basically now $40K at risk. While I am not sure where all this buying power coming, those $600 only go so far and can't just go to single stock. Also lot of big boys need to book profit and they will do one of this day. When we don't know but soon for sure."
Who knows what the 1.93mm shares bought at the close today were? Someone taking out a large short?
"Just got a 900 price upgrade from bofa after 5 other upgrades from major banks in the last week with prices ranging in 700-810. Works until it doesn’t, big boys hopping out"
"Guys, Tesla is not about a car...it's....it's about a technological way of life...yeah, that's it...a technological way of life - got it? Great."
"Tesla is only at $820B market cap. It’s got a long way to go to catch AAPL at $2T. Likely to go to 1,200 per share in the short term and then split, paving the path to catch then surpass AAPL in the fourth quarter."
Tsla is absolutely a buy if you are holding long term.
((( Model Y reliability woes put Tesla near bottom of Consumer Reports rating )))This might be a reason why Model 3 sales fell ~35% in the US.

BUY AT THESE LEVELS. WILL BOUNCE AT OPEN
"Elon Musk says, ""We are a small company in one of the toughest and most competitive industries on Earth, where just staying alive, let alone growing, is a form of victory."" Sounds like a buy at a $58B market capitalization no? BUY BUY BUY!!!"
Lots of buys coming in !
"People got greedy and wanted Tesla much lower than this, keep holding strong everyone, believe in the company!"
The Saudi are lucky the market lowered only a few dollars when they sold. Such massive selling by institutions will cause large drops in the market because the individuals cannot absorb only a few shares. Early birds catch the worms.
Why is Elon the only CEO of any stocks I own that I would actually like to have a chat with. Not about his companies. I'd like to hear him talk about interpersonal relationships. Just saying.

"This stock is certainly in bubble territory and someone is going to get caught at the top. Just do a comparison between Apple and Amazon. Both innovative and massively growth companies, that are literally everywhere. When they had 600+B market caps, they were raking in 100s of billions of dollars and more profits than what Tesla makes. Meanwhile, Tesla is expected to hit 30B in revenue for 2020 Qs and 45B in revenue by the end of this year. Very understandable that Musk and Tesla are revolutionary, but so was Apple. When they released the first iPhone in 07, was Apple trading at a p/e of 1500+ and 27x sales?! This isn’t a growth company that’s expected to triple their revenue this year. They had a 26% increase in revenue from last year and are expected to increase 45% by the end of this year. Solid growth, but this evaluation is just insane and reality will hit. The FOMO is through the roof here and never mind all of the competition in the EV industry."
By end of January...my guess is 1000$
"Now, I’m confused. I just read an article where Musk calls $420 a ""proposal"". For some reason I thought $420 was already secured. A proposal is nothing, secured is a huge deal. Now, did he really secure $420?"
Trump is a money man and I’m so sure he will do something to boost up the stock market. He wants to be re-elected and he knows by keeping a strong economy and healthy stock market people will vote for him
Really interested to see the US sales estimates for January. Especially since he mentioned in the conference call that there was US seasonal weakness and Fremont was only building for Europe and China.
"Hold on tight Tesla longs, the Tesla rocket will be reaching orbit soon!"
This stock price is a credit to how good of a salesman Elon Musk is.
"(((( Analysts on average estimate Tesla delivered roughly 78,100 cars worldwide ))) 4 Body lines (three in Fremont one in China). 2 Paint shops (one in Fremont - one in China). 6 final assembly lines - 1 Model S/X Fremont - 3 Model 3 (includes the tent) - 1 Model Y - 1 China And they are building more capacity in Europe.

And before you Trump supporters get mad, here's why. And you can come try to convince me to revote for him.1. He acknowledged the decline of the U.S dollar purchasing power. He also acknowledged that cronie capitalism was a thing, and that wallstreet was screwing over Americans. While we here are investors, I would give up a lot of my money if everyone jumped on the boat to be agaisnt cronie capitalism. This trade off is worth it. The biggest contradiction was that he uses things like GDP and the stock market to reflect Americas wellbeing. But that's exactly what he was agaisnt. I believe he did this in order to win votes and to please his supporters. But this goes exactly what he was agaisnt.2. Trade with China. In my honest opinion, I would have loved to see more pressure on China and their companies. Why? Even though I invest in companies like NIO and Baba. I only invest in Chinese companies I do extensive research on. To make Chinese companies listed on U.S stock exchanges abide by more rules is a great thing for Both Chinese companies and investors. You get more trust in the company. He did a poor job, with the trade war. Promised deficits, now it's at all time highs. I see no reason to believe this will not happen.3. The U.S debt. Debt effects everyone. And Trump acknowledged the debt and wanted to cut back and bring back jobs. Did he bring back jobs? No, the jobs created were low skill, low requirement jobs that were not necessarily needed by society. That is why the unemployment rate was hit so hard during the COVID-19. Because these jobs created were non essential for a reason. You get this when you increase our debt ""fake jobs and service based.""Is this Trumps fault? No.Large corporations have more power and decide where they hire people.Zoom is another step towards the solidification of outsourced remote work. So not only is our manufacturing being hit but our physical labor is too.Again, not Trumps fault, a problem in the making for decades.Trump has increased the debt by over 36% and will continue to do so. This is not okay because while Trumps supporters will be dead in 100 years. The future of America will have to pay for these things.If you expected China or any other nation to produce things for free, you're dead wrong.4. A win win or a lose lose:The U.S might still be NO.1. But this is being challenged tremendously. And if you don't believe me. Look outside, social unrest, distrust in the goverment, decline in political participation, tons of negative propaganda about China (this shows insecurity to me, not security. When you have to slander a threat rather than beat them shows WEAKNESS.)This is not Trump's fault. But Trump wants to participate in an unwinnable battle with China. Nope. You can't beat them. Because America is the people, not the clown politicians. And how are your people doing? More divided than ever (you win by working as a team and having structure, having social norms that allow strangers to have similar morals and beliefs), we are losing on metrics from wealth inequality, education, technology, SKILLED LABOR ( unemployment rate doesn't matter if you're raising a bunch of idiots that can't transition into the future.)To be fair, if Trump could be president till the day he dies. Perhaps maybe if he busted out the real facist side of him and acknowledged the real problems he did pre election. MAYBE then U.S would be a winner again or head in the right direction. People are so dumb that they need to be told what to do.And because Trump can't do this. It's a win win or a lose lose. You can't be NO.1 forever and history has proven that. Rome? Whatever, people these days have the attention span of a gold fish and are too busy swiping right that they can't even fathom the predicament we are in.We need to work with our allies and get China on board. If we don't everyone loses. This is how wars start. It's okay, you don't have to be number 1 forever, especially if you didn't ensure your place as no.1 by making the sacrifices you tool to get there. And this isn't Trumps fault. He acknowledged this pre election. But now, he has taken the wrong steps towards creating a better future. It's better off being a win win than a lose lose. I actually like Bidens approach to create skilled labor jobs and focus on education. We have to make the sacrifices now to ensure a better future. Why did America give up on investing in our future? Trump. You can't win the battle of capitalism and technocracy with China. They're leagues ahead and people in America are too stupid to realize that.5. Handling of the COVID-19. I don't know if the COVID-19 is real nor fake. But you had a good chance at unifying a divided country by separating petty differences. You didn't, you made the country more divided."
"I am so excited for exactly one week from now on the 27th when TSLA reports earnings. Get in now or you'll be left in the dust when we beat earnings and rocket up past $1,000!"
Trading day #4 of the year. Day 4 of Tesla shorters hemoraging money. Gotta love it!
My cost basis is 228. My plan was to hold for 7 to 10 years and im sticking to it. Tesla will be worth much more than what it is today even after this price action. Not selling a single share.
Tesla (NASDAQ: $TSLA) CEO Elon Musk Becomes The Richest Man In The World + Bitcoin Just Under $40k!#YouTube Link >> https://youtu.be/6-59D1UClX0
"Tesla Inc chief executive Elon Musk said on Saturday his company would be shut down if its cars were used to spy, his first comments on news that China's military has banned Teslas from its facilities.""There's a very strong incentive for us to be very confidential with any information,"" Musk told a prominent Chinese forum during a virtual discussion. ""If Tesla used cars to spy in China or anywhere, we will get shut down."""
"When $TSLA is added to the S&P 500, index funds will be forced to buy $50Billion of its stocks. $800-$1000 by end of the year!"
"Wow, even ARK itself is at risk because of TSLA and other highly speculative investments. Meltdown could become thermonuclear."
The squid is involved now as a consultant.Investor_Elvis5 days ago $TSLA conversationSilicon valley has disrupted plenty of industries - but manufacturing cars and managing complex supply chains they show no understanding other than outsourcing it to Asia.Let this thing collapse under it own mistakes. Get Mr. Musk out now with some excuse that this was all beyond his control and thank him for his efforts. Let him continue playing with spaceships.Restructure what is left of TSLA and get any usable pieces over to GM and Ford. Get the manufacturing and design into Michigan and Ohio and let them do what they know very well how to do - make and sell cars globally.The squid can make that happen and the current administration would be wise to encourage it.
What’s a good entry point for Tesla?
"Apple beats expectations and yet it drops.Just some Wall Street trickery!Hold Strong Tesla Longs!,,I see major $$$$$$$ in our future!"
"Waiting for Musk to claim delays and cost overruns at SpaceX, are due to NASA squabbling over small details, like safely.Musk would never let that slow down production at Tesla."
GOOG and AAPL will make Electric Car on their own - OMG!
$20 stock with these fundamentals. Why so overvalued?
I’ve never shorted a stock in my life or bought a put for the purpose of shorting but Tesla is too good to pass up. It’s current valuation makes ZERO SENSE. That doesn’t mean I’ll succeed on my puts strategy but I’ll take the risk for the reward. Right now puts are VERY CHEAP.
Holding on to a 80k loss on my tsla short position. Not sure how much longer I can hold
"minimum wage bottomfeeders say they can't afford tesla shares, so why do they come here to post?"
"Good bye sellers. HELLO buyers, welcome to $TSLA. Enjoy your stay and profits."
"Kanye West endorses Trump, and Tesla. That all but guarantees both re-election, and a profitable Tesla in 2020."
"Danger Will Robinson ...DANGER! The 10 dma has just dropped harder than a prom dress at midnight. Now with Fidelity and others jumping ship, there isn't much to hold this up. You know if they sold last quarter, they sold cheaper than it is now so can there be any doubt they and other institutions are unravelling their positions?"
"This will be Elon's final testament: ""It sure was fun while it lasted"""
Revenue from regulatory credits shot up 202% to $401 million.
So Tesla has been selling EVs in the US for the past 10 years . . . and have had a near-monopoly in EVs during that time . . . but the EV adoption rate after 10 years is still a low 2 - 2.5% . . . why in the world would Tesla leave promotional ad campaigns to be conducted by a competitor 10 years later?
People should understand that this CEO isn't the CEO of a 1 million market cap app development company but the CEO of a close to 1 trillion dollar company and he answers like a school student. This is insane!!! You could name the kebab salesman engineer.
"There are some growth companies where earnings don't matter because they are software as a service companies with large customer acquisition costs. The acquisition costs are all expensed, but they produce future earnings. This is why investors look to revenue growth primarily and give the failure to achieve substantial GAAP profits a pass.But TSLA IS A CAR COMPANY. That where essentially all it's revenues come from. When TSLA builds a new plant and equips it, the expenses are all CAPITALIZED. So investors must ask, what are the actual profits from selling the cars?And TSLA's hypothetical future growth businesses are also very capital intensive. (Meaning that the expenses of scaling up to large size are all CAPITALIZED, not expensed. So, again, investors need to see evidence that the businesses (like the energy business) can produce real profits. So far, the energy business hasn't."
Tesla is overvalue. Time to sell.
"I think that Tesla cultist who runs the ARK fund is busy writing another letter to the board outlining how Tesla can get to $10,000 a share if they install wireless cappuccino machines inside the flying robot taxis they’ll be building in the future."

ARK bought TESLA.To the moooooonnnnnnnnnnnnn$900 tomorrow

"Tesla is a lot more than just a car company. They own the majority of the satellites  in the sky & they’re planning on hosting a worldwide mesh internet network from space. They also sell solar panels & solar roof shingles that store power in power walls in your garage. I was a victim of the Texas power outages last week & I’m seriously thinking of buying a new roof with Tesla solar shingles & 4 Tesla power walls for my garage, so I can get off the grid & become energy independent. The power companies are going to be raising the rates for all Texas electricity customers because they just paid $9 per Kwh for 3 days when they normally pay $0.06 per Kwh. Those of us whom can afford to get off the grid & buy the Tesla roof & power stations will be making that investment instead of paying more for our electric company’s mismanagement of Texas power resources last week. This is why I invested in Tesla last week. I am similar to Warren Buffet in that I only invest in companies that make products or provide services that I’d actually buy. I wasn’t a huge fan of their cars, but I do plan to buy their solar shingles & power stations so I’ll never have to live through the blackouts I suffered through last week & because I don’t want to pay the higher rates for electricity over the next few years. This will also add value to my home & if I ever decide to buy that $25k Tesla they are planning to make, I can plug it into my Tesla power walls in my garage & not have to buy gasoline or pay an electric bill anymore."
Tesla bitcoin of wallstreet
THIS IS WHAT TESLA WILL DO THIS WHOLE WEEK
Tesla can’t get their solar roofs down properly. Is that really more technical than a car.

"Little history lesson, Just before the pandemic, TSLA was about 950. The pandemic hit, and it dropped to around 350. Then it slowly soared to around 2300 in August before the split. I see this going down again, just like before, during this next pandemic wave and the whole cycle repeats itself. After the split it was about 440 p/s so that 400 was the 2300 split which was soaring. So, cut that in half, maybe the 190"
"$TSLA insurance. At least 1M cars on the road. Increasing by 400K every year! Prices are competitive or better than other insurance. SO chances of all TSLA owners switching to TSLA insurance is very high. Insurance is $100 per month at a minimum. 500K x 100 = 50M reve per month = 600M per year. Not bad at all and the thing is its going to keep increasing. I know all the smart ones will point out revenues does not = profits. But the insurance is more like 150/month. and because the repairs are mostly done by TSLA shops, there will be a much better margins and efficiency. I was paying 290/month for model 3 with AAA, and it is $156/month. I asked the AAA guy why so expensive, the answer was teslas are expensive to repair and take longer time. Clearly an opportunity for TSLA to cash in. Its almost like punishing the owners of TSLA for most likely other peoples fault. They should be increasing premiums for non-TSLA owners. Barbecue TSLA has data on every driver's driving habits, they can adjust the premium a lot more precisely unlike the other insurance companies who actually dot do the repairs."
Elon will designate Tinkerbell as VP in charge of manufacture...
Tesla surpassed Audi for luxury sales in US.
Tesla still too overvalued.
Tesla stock at all time high. Short interest is low and there is no catalyst. Distance to drop at least 20 percent
"Calm down, shorts, don't start the crying, yet. TSLA still has to go to $1,720 before you lose all of your money, it's still very far away. You are good now, you still have all your money. When TSLA gets to $1,400, though..., maybe you will want to roll down a tear "
"I'm thinking if I should sell 6 figures worth of teslas and put it on a stock that can 3x... Too many epic stocks to 3x this month.... Too bad elon musk doesn't like his own tesla stock but rather buy dodge, short it for btc. Otherwise, we would be near 1000 a share by now."

"With a PE ratio of over 1,500 what is going to happen when the people buying this stock suddenly realize it is only worth pennies on the dollar. Don’t get me wrong, I like this company and what they stand for and may even buy one of their cars in the coming years but Elon has convinced thousands of people to pay a fortune for this stock for a company that is not making money and it will be 10 years before the stock could be worth what is currently selling for. By the way if you own this stock I have a wonderful bridge in New York you may be interested in buying."
"There we go, another day, and they are PUMPING $TSLA BUBBLE again!"
Good news: Model 3 gets 5 star crash rating for driver survivability. Bad news: Surviving driver likely incinerated...
"NHTSA summarily dismissed the concern of Sudden Unintended Acceleration (SUA), stating that in all cases the data shows that the driver confused the pedals. I find that unusual since the only ""data"" is that the computer thought the driver pressed the accelerator, which could be the fault. Now, it turns out the engineer who made that decision is a Tesla/SpaceX fan and an investor who has posted well about Tesla. TBD if he owns TSLA stock or call options.https://twitter.com/PlainSite/status/1349055661632417794"
"I am guessing on a 10-15% loss fall today, lets say close just around 520, after a trip til 480. And by summer between 100 and 200. The manipulating ""analysts"" have already been exposed as cheats and frauds. You know their names. The dynamics of this is, that it is an unstoppable snowball now. The more stocks that comes in real free trading, after being held and therefore frozen for a long time, the faster it falls. See also the SEC filings, the executives of the company is selling with arms and legs."
Elon please delete your Twitter
Elan must be buying silver

TESLA Stockprice is 26% up in 10 days on NO NEWS ..............!!??
why go to school? buy some shares and retire. Easy
"This is the most overhyped company of all time. It constantly goes up off things like price targets, potential S&P inclusion then actual S&P inclusion, battery day, price targets, tweets, carbon credits. This house of cards is about to collapse."
"Microsoft now partnering with GM to develop full self-driving technology. Anyone who thinks that Tesla is going to own this whole market, is dreaming."
It looks like Tesla will meet you 500k target. Elon;s email to employees indicate that they are close to achieving that target. Question is whether market priced it ?
Very interesting pregame. Could we see 750$ today? 699-750$ roller coaster play
"The future for Tesla is so bright you could take an extended vacation and when you come home TSLA will be a lot higher. You say, more competition ? I say the market demand more EVs and Tesla will have a nice size market share"
Why did it suddenly go up?
I personally feel the open interest on expiration tomorrow will propel this share price even higher tomorrow! $900 coming
No brainer buy. This auto company should be $10T valuation... we’ve never seen an auto company successfully sell cars. This is gonna be HUGE

Did everyone view the Munro interview with Elon? YouTube!
More giga factories are needed to keep up with insane demand.
Based on trend it has to hit $540 for a bounce.. So either sell now and buy low...or hold for bounce.. this is not a short term stock.. EV is market is the future and no other company can beat TSLA.
"It's never a good idea to buy into an Obama era cult stocks like Tesla especially when competition can make the same products a lot cheaper. Forget the company and the story behind it, it's the stock you need to worry about it. 2018 is going to be the year shorts ship finally came in.,"

"146% up, when to sell?!"
"AutoPilot ===== the bottomless money pit that Elon Musk created Tesla has ""invested"" (wasted) hundreds of millions on hardware installed on production cars hoping to sell the software once it works. Result: Tesla is losing money selling the $50,000+ Model 3s. Tesla will lose more money if they are forced to sell a $35,000 Model 3 and include the AP hardware.Note: The average transaction price for a mid size sedan is $25,865. Obviously the mainstream consumer is not buying $8,000 option packages."

If this stock doesnt start going up soon watch capital leave it to go to the new momentum plays like PLUG
This TSLA can't go any higher until it revisits $280 first.... I won't buy a share til then...
If Pre-Market point drop is any indication.. what goes up...
"There are some huge gaps of support on the way down. First is 280, next is 270!"

"Stonks only go up, I am new to investing have 200k in tesla and I don't own anything else... Since I joined the club in march last year I have only seen gains.... Am sure this will change short term but am investing not trading so the noise is irrelevant..Love u all"
Tesla is consolidating now which is a great thing. Might do this for another 3 weeks. It’s a nice buy under $800. I’m waiting for $750. Once ARK invest updates new projection in early March it will gain momentum again.
"shorties here claim to short less than 100 shares. not only are they losing money, but they're paying higher fees! a double loss for shorties!"

"The Giga Press is the largest high-pressure die casting machine in the world. It can produce a single-piece rear body instead of welding parts together, and eliminates the need for 300 robots. Tesla will have eight of them at Giga Berlin, which is about five stories tall. Tesla is focusing on making efficient use of space - eliminating all those robots is an example - yet the factory will still be huge. It will also be the largest battery factory in the world. Getting ready to crank out the cars in Europe."
"Due to overwhelming demand in China, Tesla has moved up the production of a new model priced around $25k to as early as 2022. Wow. My fellow longs the sp will hit $1000 in days. $2000 in weeks then another cap raise and reverse split? We made it baby."
Can’t wait until the next earning report. It’ll be Tesla’s first profitable year. That’s finna be great! Hoping that along with crushing sales numbers gets us some  Bought at 620; before the s&p inclusion!
This stock is impossible to short!! There is always something that pushes this higher!! Why would anyone short an Elon Musk company? This guy is always working hard to prove you wrong!!
"I'm a buyer at $40. Patience, Danyoson."
"I am hearing TSLA is producing massive volumes other than circle 8 (batteries). Once the bottleneck is resolved the units produced will easily surpass the goal and catch up to make good of the delays. I think the stock will breakout higher. if you are short, you may want to be careful."

EM should transfer that bitcoin to SpaceX and focus on space exploration.
"The price is rising, but not a single investment house or a fund comes forward with a buy announcement.No one's buying. This rise in price is not triggered by investors demand, it's street scam. They juggle the stock between themselves forcing these short squeezes all the time.But I do have to admit these scam work. They, the street - the market making companies, do that with market leaders. That's how they made Amazon. They pump money into a leader until it so big that there's no one left to compete. Meanwhile ain't no one's buying it. Amazing, but true."
Yahoo needs to update its target price for TSLA. Oil has a $1000 price point. Yahoo is sitting at $431. BAWHAHAHAHA!
"Food for thought ====> ((( “The radars they { TESLA } use are apparently meant for detecting moving objects (as typically used in adaptive cruise control systems), and seem to be not very good in detecting stationary objects,"" he says. ))))Might be time to reconsider the whole thing.

I've frequently stated $46 and I hold to that. that's the best case scenario... and now Elon will attempt to milk the last dream to hold this stock up... fully autonomous electric robots taking over the world... (yes... this is what I've always meant by ""robots""... i never gave a s... about the factory automation)let this be clear... there will be zero personal transportation vehicles on the road without a driver for many many years... so how do you value this company while factoring that in?... 63k in a quarter while it's competitors do millions per quarter... it just continues to be the most ridiculously overvalued company that's ever existed. it will end abruptly."

What are the chances of stock dilution announcement on this share increase?
Should be enough of a beat to trigger more analyst price boost. Plus stimulus money rolling in. Married couple could purchase 2 shares after digging thru the piggy bank for the xtra 2 hundred. 3rd catalyst possible Georgia dem sweep which looks more than 50% likely now. That would bring in more of the alternative energy crowd. Possibly then exuberance exceeds logic and common sense finally kicks in.
"Congratulations! Tesla has finally increased Model 3 production to meet actual demand, 50,000/year. Now they can take a deep breath, enjoy the long holiday weekend, and start to focus on quality improvements, and cost reduction. (That's the plan if I was CEO). But alas, that's not what they will do. Instead, they will continue to sprew out as much garbage as possible, to meet a self-imposed unrealistic deadline. Tesla brand will become tarnished, service center overwhelmed, and you will be able to change all the old jokes, replacing Yugo, with Model 3."
"I'm a little bit #$%$ that I didn't buy more on the pullback yesterday. Congrats for those who did. Buy, hold and forget, and then look back at your portfolio in EOY. Avoid playing lotto tickets with weeklies and you'll be fine with TSLA."
This week will not end well for one group of investor...You have the shorts and we have investor determined to teach the shorts a lesson. Push up the price and force the shorts to recover because of margin call or have to sell more profitable position to avoid margin call... the higher the stock climb the more exposed long betters become and the equity short sellers are forced to find more equity to hold their position. Calamity will happen soon
The whole market is red dont sell hold

"Musk, plz don't waste everyone time.Just show the proof."
