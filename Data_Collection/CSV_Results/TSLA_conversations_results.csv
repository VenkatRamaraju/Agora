tsla is not an investment its a momentum play and when playing with momentum you never know when youre going to lose and how much youre going to lose consumer reports just rated tesla 25th out of 26 due to its bad reliability but everyone will ignore such studies and such overvalued fundamentals because tesla is a marketing genius and now everybody dreams of holding a stock which 10fold in a year stop dreaming be rational this wont 10fold every year after a 10fold it will most likely underperform and once reliability issues spreads while other well established car makers continue to take their part of the market itll be hard times for tesla investors this hype may continue through the first half of 2021 but dont try to time the market im not bearish but i know ill be buying an ev in 5 years and tesla doesnt fit my needs while other car makers are already selling evs which fit my needs and im certainly not the only one and i know that tesla is not only a car maker but at 600b you better deliver a lot im super happy for you guys who 3fold 5fold or even 10fold with tesla simply be aware that theres not only tesla which returned tripledigits this year best investments are found in stocks that most people arent even aware of yet stay safe be careful good luck

“they” keep asking where is the tesla 35k bev all car manufacturers make most of their quick money on new high end heavily optioned models then as those get bought they build and offer the lower priced models tesla is doing the same thing their first cars the roadster sx high optioned 3 and now the top end y no matter the price sell fast these high margin sales generate immediate revenue as sales of these slow down they offer lower priced versions of them they’re now selling base model 3s and ys that are snapped up their margin is lowered but is made up with higher volume that’s why tesla says it’s smaller 25k bev won’t come out for three years they can’t produce enough model 3s an ys to met demand so it would be unwise to make the cheaper versions yet they need the high margin sales to selffinance the new gigafactories and build more superchargers it’ll be the same scenario with the cybertruck and tesla semi

i just called elon and told him that a lot of shorts are complaining about the stock price too high he told me that dont worry the stock price will come down to 400 toward the end of 2021 after another 51 stock splitshorts will really be happy to see tesla stock at 400
and here comes another factory
i think the europa markt love tesla and i dont maybe if nio is cheap than europa people wil buy nio but now nio is only on china markt let’s go tesla and go to the south america market
will musk split the stock again in 2021
just to be clear smart money will flow out of expensive bloated tsla nio and xpev to undervalued stocks f gm and stla theres no two ways about it whether you like it or not
careful momentum traders momentum is a twoway street and its always faster on the downside of the street than the upside there always comes a the king has no clothes moment and the fact that tsla has gone hyperbolic is a sign that moment may not be very far off and the greater fool theory i realize this is nonsense but ill follow the trend and get out when it turns does not work very well in practice
people are insanely emotional about this stock its a stock folks not a family member dont let emotion blind your thinking and remember that 20 years ago we all saw just how fast and far stocks could drop if youre sitting on large unrealized gains then do yourself a favor and buy some put options for downside protection
where is the sec
when people digest this news on apple with ev goals they will see that they have to partner with tesla on this 700 by next week
tsla over 10 times market cap as gm wowwho would tesla take out if ready to buy another player

everywhere i read they saying tsla is bubble stock  1
tesla  nasdaq tsla gains 431 over our january 2020 buy call elonmusk is numero uno elon httpsyoutubey89cekvpkgi
currently over 90 of leadacid batteries used in typical gasolinepowered vehicles are recycled compare that to less than 5 of lithiumion batteries experts project 11m tons of lithiumion batteries will be discarded between 2017 and 2030
after the bubble bursts there will be a movie about all the people who lost life savings and pensions
now that tsla is at 850 and at 1617 pe i think its time to consider again the product vs its competition there are many competitor ev cars and trucks now and many more coming that are more comfortable roomier ergonomically more sound offer better customer service and better range tesla has great brand recognition but not a great product and i think in 6 months to a years time we will be thinking of this stock more like a myspace one of the originals but not the pick moving forward
some might be tempted to sell tsla and chase after riot  mara because of the early huge moves this early premarket tslas price will increase
the competition is heating up and tesla will come back to earth whats up with those rocket launches anyway that rocket fossil fuel dont seem to add up with teslas ev vision
tesla reports quarterly results in january if the results are not super spectacular this will be a sell off like no other the stock is currently priced way above perfection i am taking my profit and sit on the sidelines

the casino takes the money of shorts and longs shorts just see it faster at the moment and longs want to hold it because it goes up but when the drop comes the longs will lose as well the casino is well orchestrated didnt think would go so far stay out if you dont wanna lose or in if you think you manage your timing right which for the vast majority shorts  longs will be missed
what happens when other automakers like vw and bmw flood the market with their wide array of ev model designs will customers still only buy cookie cutter model 3s to justify tsla’s valuation

this is gonna be the biggest bloodbath on monday  in historythis price of 620 is far beyond it’s real evaluation and only held up by private investorsif you work with funds then you know that it is common that funds are not going in above tesla 150i forecast denial from all funds on monday leading to an instant drop of tesla price to around 300 hereafter it will drop to 200 at the end of the year and start building from 200 next time we might see 600 will be after 2025 if tesla dosnt file for bankruptcy before then

tsla is not a car company cars just happen to be one of their products they are a technology company a battery company and a leader in ev car technology even gm can compare given they have had evs for 10 years now when companies like tsla are looked at in the stock market traditional measures are difficult it is for sure higher risk than say ford and tslas dynamics defy gravity if you cant roll with that then you should not own tsla

sleepy joe win yay 
when someone like micheal burry announce publicly going short on tesla i would consider it that means he is quite sure
unless we see a strong reversal upon the release of earnings tsla has definitely lost momentumthis could bring the well deserved correction1 momentum players stop buying and sell2 margin buyers get squeezed3 short move inwhats the floor when does tsla seem such a compelling bargain that one cant miss buying its hard to find a point above 100share more like 40

so many here want to compare tesla to amazon but dont actually do it amazon does over 10x the revenue similar if not better growth patterns and profitability yet only 2  25x the market cap using amazon as a benchmark for tesla yields results showing tesla overvalued by no less than a factor of 4 if you have a real case to make then make it simply mentioning tesla in the same breath as other wildly successful high cap companies means nothing
all said and done i think tesla gave a fabulous result in 2020 some people are saying tesla fell short of its delivery commitment really i am expecting tsla to go up next week don’t try to bring down the stock with pessimism just so you can buy it when the price falls let’s give tesla it’s due worth and move on with its increasing share price

tesla likely hit a peak friday or it could keep rising for huge gains for a few more days with even bigger daily point gains selling at the very peak of a climax top is essentially the great fishing story for investors many will claim it few will achieve itinvestors may want to sell some tesla stock into strength because when a climax top occurs shares can fall to earth even faster than they riseafter a climax run stocks often suffer huge declines that take years to recover from qualcomm qcom finally surpassed its 2000 climax top peak last yeartesla stock had a climaxtype run in late 2019 to early 2020 peaking on feb 4 at a splitadjusted 19380 shares then plunged 64 to 7010 on march 18 with the coronavirus market crash no doubt contributing to the lossesperhaps tesla stock will have a climax top sell off and rebound rather quickly once again but do you want to sit through a 30 50 80 decline on hopes for a rebound if tesla stock corrects or crashes and then bounces back investors can always buy it back after the coronavirus crash tesla stock offered buying opportunities slightly below and above the february peak
i keep hearing analysts mention there is no more news eventscatalysts for tesla to keep gaining on i think they’re oblivious to the 800 lb gorilla in the room known as stimulus if households are going to again receive checks then why wouldn’t the retailrobinhood investor do exactly what they did before and put it into the market tesla is still cooler than miles davis run baby run

a stocks price  and its entire market capitalization  is all based on the price of one share the last one to trade before the quote is published volume numbers can be meaningless with algorithmictrading where a single share can be traded back and forth between two computers millions of times in a day creating completely fictitious appearances of liquidity so long as no significant numbers of shareholders try to sell everything looks wonderful but the moment onetoomany shareholders try to convert their papergains into real money the entire houseofcards collapses

i would focus heavily on amzn tomorrow guuys it will announce xmas earnings

could gm be an attractive acquisition target because of its vast reservoir of automotive engineering and manufacturing talent gms assets in factories engineers and knowhow could become an attractive acquisition for those with deep pockets interested in entering the ev marathon that would include aapl tsla and amzn etc all which easily have the financial means of acquiring gm those three are all in the race with some hiding their full interest the company who acquires the gm assets could easily win this race gm shareholders would give up over 50 of their holdings for a purchase price between 100 to 200 billion with the present market cap at 60 billion that would put the price of gm shares at 100 to 150 imagine the full knowhow and assets of gm in the hands of elon musk no one and i mean no one could compete
amzn aapl goog and fb are now old geezers in the sp and mostly all played out people and funds who put their trust in the sp welcome the breath of fresh air tsla which has significant room to grow i believe tslas growth potential is the main reason the sp welcomed it with wide open arms to join its indexes
tsla just announced production of 509737 vehicles in 2020 and delivery of 499550 ie 98 sales of manufactured itemswow that represents 36 increase over previous year and 180070 vehicles delivered in 4th quarter represents 30 increase over 3rd quarter deliveries to the moon

will never buy a electric that doesnt have easily changed batterynio has the right idea on thisalsoselling the car without battery and leasing one is another great ideahow nio plans to set itself apart from other ev playersin august this year the company launched a battery subscription model referring to it as “battery as a service” baas under this plan customers can purchase nio cars without a battery which is usually the most expensive component of an electric vehicle this would offset the total price of the car by rmb70000 and customers can subscribe to a 70kwh battery pack at rmb980 per month essentially what this means is that nio is providing its customers the option to separate the purchase of its cars and batteries making its cars more affordable to buy and therefore more attractive additionally it also means that as batteries improve drivers can upgrade easily for nio this means that the company could potentially see increased sales by making its vehicles more accessible and the subscription model creates an ongoing revenue stream for the companythe company also offers a battery swapout service instead of waiting for their vehicles to charge which usually takes a long time in tesla’s case overnight is recommended drivers can swap out their empty batteries for fully charged ones in three minutes at one of nio’s battery swap stations

tsla only closed the model x  s production lines for the holidays those models only account for 11 of deliveries they are focusing on mass producing and delivering as many model 3s  model ys as they can for the last two weeks since those two models are in heavy demand notice how they encourage the workers to help with deliveries or work on other production shifts if you go to the tesla website it takes 2  12 weeks to get delivery on model 3  model y it takes 8  12 weeks to get delivery on the model s  model x because they know they will stall production on those two models they have some inventory for model 3  model x but no inventory for model y they will encourage reservation holders to take delivery on the model 3s already in inventory to speed up the delivery process and get those cars out of inventory one incentive is the 1000 miles of free supercharging avoid the noise the price will increase
many believe that sell side analysts like the guy at wedbush rate companies based on the agenda of his investment bank rather than the real fundamental story in europe tesla is getting pummeled by the ev competition from major players like vw and renault sales in the us are not great yet this analyst is incessantly cheerleading future prospects for the very competitive china market then with overbought conditions a move from 400 to 850 in 8 weeks an rsi at 80 hes still raising the price target its irresponsible for traders and many will be sorry they listened to the wedbush analyst and bought at the top

i have no stake in this stock wish i did but where does it realistically go from here it is essentially valued such that over the next few years it needs to generate as much revenue and net profit as the next 4 or 5 largest car makers combined that is just not happening yes it is a growth story this year but the longterm growth has been rather uneven and there is a lot of new competition coming into view plus autos are a low margin business this is not a pure tech company as so many apparently believe something like 90 of their revenue comes from low margin manufacturing not too sexy what would the dudes on shark tank think if musk pitched this business at 35 times revenue and 1300 times earnings insane stuffnot sour grapes just been around a while and know this cannot hold this valuation longterm something is going to give at a certain point

jacob sonenshine reports tsla as posed to drop upon earnings release citing tsla as among the least shorted and most expensive of the sp 500 stocks also earnings estimates have been raised 21 in the past 3 months and i will add that there are whisper numbers that are even higher so even if tsla beats its published earnings estimates by a little it may still disappoint given that the stock price has doubled in 3 months

a short squeeze is a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to technical factors in the market rather than underlying fundamentals a short squeeze can occur when there is a lack of supply and an excess of demand for the stock due to short sellers covering liquidating their positions1short squeezes result when short sellers of a stock move to cover their positions purchasing large volumes of stock relative to the market volume since covering their positions involves buying shares the short squeeze causes a further rise in the stocks price this newly increased price can inturn trigger additional margin calls and short covering which in turn may drive up the price further still in a vicious feedback loop short squeezes tend to happen in stocks that have expensive borrow rates these expensive borrow rates can increase the pressure on short sellers to cover their positions further adding to the reflexive nature of this phenomenon

this should be turning up right about now i guess when you announce a 5 billion influx of stock will dampen the price hey musk if you are reading this board i would like to make a suggestion for you instead of issuing new stock why dont you do like the rest of the big companies and issue a 5 billion corporate bond and pay out a little interest that way your not diluting your stock holders you get the 5 billion that wont drift up and down like a stock will how about you issue a corporate bond easy peasy

we all assume big institutions are confused and disorganized and waiting for market to open to storm and buy no it is not the case everything is predetermined and it will be done in an organized manner just like drs doing a bypass surgery ledger entries would be made stock volume changes without any change in price volatility that is how it will be done watch
to justify this share price tesla would have to produce over 50 of all cars sold globally currently in the countries with the highest adoption of ev vehicles they are losing ground to the likes of vwask yourself if you think tesla’s price will increase because you want it to or because it is actually undervalued
tesla isnt a car company tesla isnt an energy company tesla isnt a tech company tesla is an asteroid mining company you heard it here first once elon combines tesla with spacex he will create the space mining industry look up 16 pscyche it is an asteroid with a value of 10000 quadrillion in rare metals hold hold hold this is the company that will create the trillionaires of the future

dear shareholders of tesla apple is launching its ev model soon with partners tbd make no mistake they will grab more and more market share of the ev sector and eventually dominate as they always do in any angle they decide to hardly invest in also apple pb sits at 34 while tesla is at a stuning 48 plus apple pays a dividend which will gradually grow with time the pick is easy imo at current conditions glta

time to split again 
everyone knows they did a split right literally nothings changed about the fundamental story  in fact they actually missed their delivery targets and stocks up 600 just recognize the single greatest reason this thing is up is because of fed monetary policy and that eventually rates willl go up the fundamental story holes will reveal themselves and the bubble will burst until then enjoy
tesla will continue to innovate and will sell products and services in 510 years that not even elon knows about right now cars will be an afterthought youre getting this stock cheap if willing to hold
some smart but foolish investors cant get past that tsla trades at 175x 2021 eps intellectually they know a stock is the present value of future cash flow they know they compare tslas pe to forward growth they refuse to believe a car company can trade at 175x eps their objection soon every auto brand  porsche mustang and corvette will have an ev and tslas ev share will drop they miss that tsla has a 10 yr head start and tam keeps expanding as tsla enters new segments and markets they miss that tsla is much more than an ev company and so tsla remains unloved and incredibly cheap
model y deliveries yes
when the bubble pumps more and more stranger explainations appear when it passed all other car companies in the world with a fraction of the world production you said it is not a car company now you say the tesla share is not a share its an asset against printing dollar or inflarion i think now even the hardest bulls have run out of arguments to protect this ponzi scheme prepare for a bubble burst not seen before in history since tulip mania
if recurring history is any indicator the current prevalence of paid bathers undoubtedly means another significant run is imminent
3k cycles of 8 gb everyday is 56 years life on the chip the misleading part is that it doesnt cycle everyday and sometimes not at all for days so it should say at minimum 56 years

whos in the mood for a 350 point retrace tesla motors implied decline of 41electricvehicle ev manufacturer tesla motors nasdaqtsla might just be the markets most polarizing stock following a greater than 700 run higher over the trailing year wall street is looking for a retracement of 41 to its oneyear consensus price targetobviously tesla has done something right or it wouldnt be up more than 700 in 12 months in 2020 the company was short only 450 ev deliveries of ceo elon musks promised goal of 500000 still its an incredible accomplishment for an auto stock built from the ground uptesla also continues to hold tangible competitive advantages in the technology department over other auto stocks during its september battery day event the company unveiled its nextgeneration battery which will improve range by 16 increase power by a factor of six and offer five times the capacity slowly but surely the possibility of a 25000 ev is taking shape however the big knock against tesla is that its still not profitable from selling evs its reported a profit in each of the past five quarters but in four of those five quarters it was aided by the sale of renewable energy credits investors shouldnt have to worry about a nearly 800 billion company still being unable to generate a profit from its product or service

too bad tesla is allowing the model s to die a slow painful death its basic clean design still holds street creed still has a great stance especially from rear 34 view a modest mca midcycle change facelift involving only the hood fenders decklid boot for you brits front and rear fascias as well as all lighting would extend its appeal for several more years other than filling the catfish mouth in the front fascia she looks just like a 2012
i started low in 2018 then last year i watched videos from ark investments catherine wood and associates they predicted 1500 3000 and 7000 before split institutions analysts shorts critiqued ark comparing tsla with legacy auto industry got all wrong tsla is more than that vertical operations own energy network of superchargers solar storage no need for chevronexxon gas stations logistics and service no need for dealerships and transportation autonomous and software do a rough math the valuation justifies 7000 before split now 1400 in 3 years easy jim cramer a long critic of tsla got converted after his wife bought a model x i spoke with few tsla middle managers and all agree in no time tsla will be a 1t company making story short a little investor with 300k in tsla position now worth 17m thanks to this i had a model 3 traded for an x ordered y and cybertruck last year the shorts lost 38b and i don’t feel sorry for their stupidity and greed i will continue to buy more tsla stocks and can’t wait to invest on other elon’s private enterprises that become public spacex boring starlink

question from below  i have the same one im new to selling options on tesla how has the dec 18 and 24 out of the money calls on tesla increased instead of decreased despite the lost time value and flat stock price since monday afternoon today for example the calls are flat even though tesla is down 2 yesterday tesla was barely up but the out of money calls were way up on the day volatlity increase im guessing is outweighing the time value loss but beta was already extremely high before i sold the options
were opening at 810 tomorrow
the other thing tsla will be a leader on is bitcoin elon will exchange us dollars in the tsla treasury for bitcoin so you’ll have massive appreciation even in stagnant treasury funds pretty brilliant

i can never understand in a trading market why those with huge profits dont take at least part of their profit this is beyond a fear of missing out tesla is not for sale i dont think elon musk is the company hes the pioneer the innovatori get all that i just dont get parabolic moves 11 straight days of gains from 650 to over 850 in 2 weeks yes 2 weeks of trading yes i missed this no im not short but im tempted i want to hear from rational experienced traders where does teslas stock price go from here does it go to 1000 5000 pre split or does it correct back to 700 or less soon

tslas forward pe is 206 but gms forward pe is 86 which is the better stock to hold and why
party is over happy thanksgiving
hey longs a food for thought remember aocs suggesting that unrealized stock gains should be taxed
so roughly 15 of all tesla’s ever produced need to be recalled and upgraded on top of the quality of the cars being ranked second to lowest
now that the krazyness is gone stocks fly back up over recent drops
i am moving 10000 into my short account for this stock i will document the exact price i short it when the inevitable correction comes in 2021 i expect this stock to decline to a reasonable pe of around 150 which even if earnings increase greatly implies a stock price of 200 dollars or less
would you believe it this pesky tesla keeps going up  must be magnetism  must be north always points up

shorts when tsla is only up 5 now instead of 7
the naivety of people assuming the masses can afford these high price points is laughable tesla has barely profited even with the emission credits are we to assume that duringafter a global pandemic one in which more economic devastation was incurred than in any other period before people will be lining up to buy a new tesla i know theyre much more than a car company and thank god for that for longs because im pretty sure fordgm dealers sold more vehicles in the state of illinois in 2020 than tesla did in the entire world

isn’t tesla’s book value like 16 i’m really sad that i didn’t get in on it but is this investing or gambling i guess it’s all just gambling in the end but one day this will go to its book value
if people are buying this company at this level they must think tesla will sell 80 of all the cars every year in the world sorry but the crash out in this poster child of excess will be epic
everywhere it is said tesla is the new aol but have you ever seen elon stand still no so it doesnt compare to aol or anything thats why the stock is only going up

tesla is not an automobile company it is a technology energy and finance company auto companies all started providing a form of transport which at the time was dangerous undependable and dependent on energy they did not control tesla has a ten year head start over others in making and providing energy for evs and building batteries the real question is not if tesla is overvalued it is really what value will traditional car makers have in 10 years just like the smartphone destroyed nokia be sure that gm and ford wont make it their legacy costs are not going away

i would buy this dip if i didn’t already have my life savings into it already
a lot of the people who hate on tesla are just people who wanted to buy the stock but felt like it ran away from them so instead of biting the bullet they kept waiting for the drop that never happened now getting to the point where they need a monumental crash i the share price just to put them back to the point where they had first thought it had already ran away from himseriously why else would they even be here they’re not short selling or have ever suggested that they had so where’s all this interest for tsla coming from

analysts at jpmorgan said friday they remained highly cautious on tesla due to its stock valuation but they raised their price target on the stock to 125 from 105 the lowest among factsetsurveyed analystswhile still suggestive of large downside we do not regard our price target as ungenerous as it actually values tesla as the worlds second largest automaker by market capitalization behind toyota and ahead of volkswagen despite these automakers each currently selling on the order of magnitude of 20x as many vehicles annually as tesla the jpmorgan analysts led by ryan brinkman said in their note

nice closegood day why do i say that because its hovering within 35 of its all time high thats not a bad thingi would rather see it trade sideways in this range for a month or 2 than keep on the parabolic track where it is likely to get to a point where it falls harder than it rose in a couple daysbuilding a sp500 base once were in therell be a nice solid floor to build upwards from again in 2021think of the 630s as the new tesla share price zero

im huge on tesla but i do have a concern when yahoo was added to the sp 500 some time ago their share price went from 272 to 79 dollars in a matter of days can anyone knowledgable give their opinion as to why this wont happen with tesla 
so i agree that stock rose really quickly but most of investors of tsla are long especially oracle cofounder larry ellison with his 15 million shares i dont think he will sell them anytime soonso that stock is not finished to bubble up as long as tsla has good earnings then that stock will still go upwhen cathie wood said it worth 6k she was right and we are on that path tsla already reached 2kstay long for those who want to short it then its at your own risk and you need to say good bye to your money because you are likely to lose it

tesla beats expectations with record vehicle deliveriesthis will trade close to 900 monday
the shorts will scare the longs about tracking funds having bought share already so they say the sp inclusion is a nonevent it is simply false active fund mgrs do that but not tracking funds tracking funds only turn on the buy switch a former derivative trader with a trading firm explained that concept to me that along with the ownership of three largest etf index and it has no tsla shares so the switch is not yet on it is not the objective of tracking funds to get stocks bought at the best pricelt i am long on tsla i think it’s probably a great investment and i intend to hold for the lt but the shorts are outrageous in creating false narrative and i just want to share what i know
tesla is cutting the price of its cars now because theyre overvalued musk will be selling some more shares soon for the same reason another 5 billion in january or maybe 10 billion
780 goldman price target  why sell or short now

government is thinking of buying all the cars tesla can produce and give it to people for free best way to fight climate change
fun fact apple reached a 1t market cap in 2018 when they were making close to 260b in revenue so tesla is about to reach that market cap with 31b in revenue and 45b expected next year whoever thinks this isn’t overvalued by 400b is beyond dreaming sell off post earnings
450 short of 500000 but they still beat the estimates this is going to 1000
tesla is overvalued for sure and it’s teetering on the edge of a cliff anyone buying is 100 out of touch with reality tesla has to beat earnings every quarter to maintain this price and grow the moment it does not meet expectations the stock will be crushed like a soufflé as our leader says i’m happy for everyone who became uber wealthy but i can’t justify buying right now i would need to see it in the 200300 range to get back in
wells fargowarns for investment in tesla stockthe valuation is massivly too much a ponzi system
i feel like this stock is now trading solely on investors fear of missing out and greed
tesla will reach 100000 a share within 2 years this price target doesn’t even reflect how good this stock is this is the future
i think next week 27 of january tesla would announced their earning for q4 is that true
thank goodness the week is over see yall next tuesday best of luck and hope you have a better weekend than today
thumbs up if you’re a teslanaire 
1000 coming then back off to mars we go people
all the fears of it being hammered once it officially become part of the sp appears to be just another mirage for shorts boolean
hey bulls wheres the volume wheres the bidall those calls will expire worthless again this weekcould it be that tesla stock is overpriced could it be that next weeks earnings report will be a bustall we need is just a little bit of selling in the broader market to pop this bubble
this ponzi scheme will crash with the results of the senate runoff elections in georgia that will leave kamala harris as the tiebreaker yes corporate taxes are going up and tesla will officially be in a loss on paper why coz buddy musk doesnt wanna pay taxes oh and those ev credits haha theyre gonna be gone too
has anybody checked the volume  nothing special strange 
i buy a call it goes up and still lose money goes down lose massively too i buy a put i lose money on the way down goes up massively lose massively as well i try looking a graph and technical analysis nothing helps

when is tsla going into the s  p 500 and how much of a pop should we expect 
musk could and should raise a quick 10 billion with an additional share issue that would be enough to build several gigafactories and would only dilute the share base by a tiny 1seems like an obvious choice with the stock price at this level
mercedesbenz has just unveiled the eqa a member of a diverse family of mercedes eq electric vehicles its just one of a full lineup that will be rolling out this year and next each is based on a conventional internalcombustionengined mercedes from aclass to gwagen spearheaded by the eqc a derivative of the glc the eq family will grow with further models such as the glbbased eqb followed by futuristic standalone models including the eqe and the eqs

tsla tesla would have to post over 4x the profits of the top ten automakers combined to justify its valuation
why is everyone so bullish on the fact that they are going to deliver 500000 carslast year they delivered 364000 carsthis has gone from  37 to 77 dollars in 2019to  69500 today9 fold run on 40 percent growththis company ran too far too fastthe price is trading like they are selling over 3 million carslook at toyota and volkswagen they sell roughly 10 million cars a year eachok this year they might only sell 8 million cars eachthis company is trading 2x more than both companies combined

so index funds literally have a gun to their head and have to buy massive amounts of this stockclosing date for this purchasestranslation end date in mondayinteresting and they are praying on weak hands selling so they can enter cheep i dont feel index and shorts understand my new generations  the way we trade we buy and hold great companys so the chance of buying in cheep is cutegod loves youps contrary to poplar belief some of us newbies know your tricks and how the system works rinse and repeat
why did it suddenly go up
tsla is a great stock but at a market cap of 700b how much higher can  will it go 2x 3x maybe but 10x nio is already at 80b more room to run up but 10x is also unlikely before they exceed 500000 cars per year xpev and li are valued at less than 12 what nio is however monthly production rates and growth rates are very comparable which are most likely to give you a 10x return
i own significant holdings in both tsla and nio and i want them both to do well in the longterm the ev market is easily large enough to accommodate both good luck to all tsla and nio longs
tesla price has gone up 4 out of 5 times between earnings date announcement and earnings report and earnings was just announced

gotta love it when my 3 million  invested in tesla is tax sheltered gotta make sure my tax dollars dont bail gm ford and chrysler out of bankruptcy again

the last time citron called a stock a casino was tsla pltr and nvda look at where they all are now tesla is hitting records every day nvidia is up 153 this past year and pltr survived the citron short last week so do not be fooled by their panicinducing selloffs hold strong buy the dips and watch citron bleed
i keep hearing reasons why tsla will go up first it was a stock split then the excuse was incorporation into the sp 500 i am curious now what is the reason in the kool aid
electrektesla will rule ev market for another 3 yrs minimum
lots of smart minds out there all have different opinions there could be short term volatility around the time of inclusion but dont get scared out of your stocks with all the useless noise or youll miss the big gains still to come ive said this before i would rather bet with elon than bet against him good luck
musk is a genius longs think in buying tsla they are buying musk but all they get is shares in a car company they dont own musk and he has other more interesting projects to attend to geniuses like musk arent interested in attending to the details of following through on execution once they have proved their concept correct yes in desperate times musk slept on the factory floor to ensure that the model 3 production would be successful hes been there done that dont expect him to devote himself so much in the future especially now that his maximum bonus options to buy 10 of tslas shares at 40share is about to be fully earnedso the future of tsla will be dependent on how well its executives perform versus those at other car companies tsla has no monopoly on talentits ironic that the higher the stock price goes the sooner musk will move his attention to other things
10 trillion company i believe
dont listen to other the money is your money not them
anyone here bashing tesla probably couldnt figure out how to use the flat door handle
im long but this is insanity and not just tesla stockkeep printing money until blue in the face its just a game of musical chairs and somebody else is controlling the music and placing bets and owns the chairs

i told a friend to buy one share for 600 presplit price  he said playing with stocks out of my league so it didnt happenwere not playing first mover advantage greatest tech lead you try to help someone who cant see the trees for the forest bummer
in eu europa as the biggest market for ev cars then tesla is not nr 1 company but hyundai and vw are much bigger and own a much bigger part of the market in eu so what is the reason that tesla has a 10 to 20 times bigger market value when they are like nothing in the world very good question and i think the value of the company is 20 times over valued but if tesla in the future are getting a bigger part of the market and can expend the company and get a bigger earnings after tax then maybe they should have a bigger value on the company but i think they have to show that they can do it first like produce 10 mil cars and get very big positive cash flow but thing that is some years before that happenso a fare value on the share is around 40 to 80  as it is today
low volume no large blocks in either direction it will go up today just need the buyers to wake upli xpev nio tsla
meanwhile the stock market goes up as if it was detached from washington dc smh
boom sold 860 puts at 9 3x return in under and hour
tsla market value is now 200 greater than finlands total gdpthe valuations are beyond insanity how the stock prices can keep going up with falling nominal corporate revenues and collapsing economy
i hope to be right here as welljust remember electric vehicle maker tesla tsla at one point was hit with downgrades as it was accused of fraud etc by misleading investors demanding that musk be removed as a director in the company the stock moved up not down so when they yell fraud it appears to be a buy signalgood luck longs  we have nothing to lose by taking chance for additional 0018 left to lose  most likely 001 if you try to sell nowi really hope that kb will come out the winner even though i dont like or agree with his acts as the ceo good luck all 
what all calls losing money today lol
look for another 6 month chart like t scam buy all you can of that one too
one thing the sales rep could not understandthe non refundable deposit on the s or x is 2500 cdn and 3200 on the model 3 made no sense to the rep since the s and x are higher priced carsmade perfect sense to me it is called grabbing as much deposit cash as possible as the model 3 represent about 8o of sales i did have one laugh there are 6 model 3s in inventory across toronto montreal and quebec city the sales rep asked me if i liked the colours of any the montreal car was red and i said it looked nice he said it would cost me 500 to ship it i laughed and said i wouldn’t pay an extra 500 to clear up elon’s priblem i’d just order it from the factory lol no intention to unless this test drive next week knocks my socks off and even then why would i buy a car from a manufacturer that might be bk before the snow melts in toronto next spring

stock is expected to stay low prior and around sp inclusion there won’t be massive volatility to trigger panic however don’t expect steep surges as been use to this year sp will ensure stock remains less volatile
if you bought a model s between 2012 and 2018 or a model x between 2016 and 2018 you’ll want to get in touch with your local tesla dealership sooner rather than later turns out that tesla’s sold during that period used nvidia tegra 3 chips in their central displays problem is those chips have a habit of wearing out when overwritten too many times leaving the screen blank and unresponsive according to the nhtsa 158000 teslas are susceptible to the fault and is encouraging the company to issue a formal recall

david einhorn  notorious tesla short seller  just had his best quarter ever economist john maynard keynes famously said the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent and einhorns performance in recent years highlight just how much of a toll a single short positioncan take on an entire portfolio when the stock in question gets caught in a potential market bubble short positions can result in unlimited theoretical losses whereas standard long positions are capped at just 100downside
that’s what y’all say about amazon when it was trading in the 47s it’s not making money every quarter it loses money now look where they are now tesla is the same way it’s not making money it loses money you’ll see in a few months time this will be trading in the 1000s

todays market runup owes a big thank you to janet yellen but easy money will only carry this mkt so far before underlying fundamentals kick in and share prices reverse to more reasoned levels even rbc and bac are now predicting tesla growth rate to decelerate dramatically over the next five years
a funny thing about this board is that the bear rhetoric in 2021 is exactly the same as the one in 2014 while old bears went bankrupt and left the board only to be replaced by new bears screaming this time is different in the meantime bulls supporting the mission and appreciating innovation have accumulated significant wealth over the years anyway happy new year
i bought 20 shares last august now 100 shares post split my investment is now up 114 in 45 months it is starting to get a little scary at these levels
nothing is stopping the momentum in tsla from getting to 1000 
we have been going on about how this should fall reality is even when it does its a small fall and then it leaps even further should switch over to being a pumper
and the march up continuesnew highs
tesla today sell promise of fsd at 10k even when current hardware at best it will autonomus car and self drivingsome point to me that that is very high margin item while i disagree as cost to maintain is very very high even if its very high margin it already account in their gross margin which if you discount ev credit its in single digitso if they have 80 margin on fsd sale they have negative gross margin for rest
just look at it this way jpm just increased teslas price estimate by 125650  125  73125
when you short a momo stock in a bubble market you have to be patient for the right pricestill waiting to short lol

bad news for tesla short term sell to lock in gains if you really like this stock get back in cheaper
market cap of tsla is 832 billion or 175 million per car sold each year versus 9000 per car for gm wake up
this is classic bubble behavior the most remarkable thing about it is the market cap and the extraordinary speed of the rise 10 times over the past year intc aol and csco merely doubled the year before the collapse this suggests that the fall will be extraordinarily rapid qs might be a warning
repeat after me 1000 1000 1000
how many of you see more amazon vans than teslas i live in northern california three people in my gated community own them and i would say it is not even close i see many more amazon vans and they generate revenue unlike the mythical robo taxi
so many people bought tsla at this low level i bet tomorrow tsla will go back to 850
i am bearish and just bought some more shares why i can sell an out of the money call option and net a nice premium more than 10 if the stock rises so that my stock is called away at expiration so much the better this moves only costs me if the stock drops more than 10 by expiration but that would please me because i have a large inventory of long puts it also reduces the margin required for my short leap option positionsif my buying and the buying of others making similar moves pushes the stock price up so much the betterwe are all fake longs in the sense that we are long the stock and dont want really to own it once this turkey dives were out
this is not a bubblekeep telling yourself that
sell xpev buy more nio and tsla 
tesla car sales have fallen sharply in the netherlands and germany this is because more and more chinese car brands are added and they are even better than tesla “tesla has built a strong brand image with technological innovation and an innovative way of selling cars but some of their cars are still unnecessarily large and heavy and when i see the reactions of customers after purchase tesla still has some improvement in terms of production quality and customer service

if you are short and did not cover on the dip you are in for a big surprise  you can still cover now before it’s too late all great news coming soon
i would rather buy nio than tesla the more and more other ev companies continue to perform well it makes me more bearish on tesla showing that they can’t dominate this market and competition is their major headwind

tesla is resisting the voluntary recall because it would cost half a billion dollars or more to fix properly they will end up with a mandatory recall and a probable class action lawsuit damages could be in the billions if nothing else it shows where the company stands when it comes to their costumer safety and that they wont stand behind their product
up again today looking good
super undervalued going to 50000 next week
why its going up
way undervalued people dont get what addressable market is and that tesla isnt a car company tesla isnt bound by the auto industry its bound by the entire planets economy 200t this year 1 of that is easily captured by tesla and hence its easily worth 2000 per share right now the price is totally wrongthe analysts are keeping the price down

we can call tsla as technology company in the last 5 qtrs it made money in selling cars not shippingdownloading or implementing technology let call spade as a spade it is a car company he gives free charging for a year to sell cars he is forcing forced timeoff to cut productions these are typical car companies do

i find it very interesting how much attention and how much investment appears to be going into the ev and autonomous vehicle space it doesnt appear any have looked at the profit margin of the transportation industry players not many clear an economic profit after deducting a cost of capital i guess the real game is not sustainability but the transaction of fooling others on a capital raise or ipo the manufacturing of a dreamy new vehicle is the story needed to get the millionsbillions to take the fee

here is my biggest concern with tesla’s valuation leaving a parking garage yesterday i noticed the incredible variety of cars around me many different makes and many different models hundreds people love variety their car is part of their identity and what differentiates them from others based on tesla’s current valuation the market is saying someday tesla will make at least 3050 of all cars on the road that would be an incredible assumption because of the desire for variety in the cars we like to drive i don’t see tesla able to profitably develop such variety i think tesla will grow into a very significant and important company but they will not be the apple of cars because the car market seeks variety
this message is for any new tesla members there is a lot of fear spread on this board by short sellers  often messages about tesla falling for example there were tonnes every other minute about stock tanking the week after sp inclusion it’s true the price was volatile around the inclusion but it rebounded to new highs i used to get worried about these warnings so much so that i sold once too early and it cost me in fees taxes and missed opportunity  since then i bought back in and gained but i would have been much much wealthier had i not soldsummary point is don’t be scared by their warnings tesla has a bright future is lead by a revolutionary genius and continues to go up despite small set backs here and there be strong and hold especially on red days don’t give into the fud by shorts  it’s a trick they want your shares at a discount remember my words you will be rewarded

gordon johnson is getting some air time today talking tsla down unsuccessfully since he put his crudential in linkedin i reviewed it todayits interesting he has been at every company he worked for about 2 years 3 for1 year each and 3 for 2 year  covering health industry and chip industry and then he had worked at axiom as a managing director for 10 years covering material science so i would say he would specialize in material science as he has not done so for health and chip for more than 10 years he has no experience in automotive industry neither does he have any experience in ai and datascience he has been in his ceo position for barely a year now i understand he has a credibility issue no one believes him if i were buying research report i would not buying from himfrom the nature of his ceo position he is just selling research on the company he covers i am really not sure how he gets the funding to short it i think he is probably shorting it himself another word i think he is full of it for those of you who might be skeptical with what i say go look it up on his linkedin profile as it is public

after watching cnbc yahoo finance and bloomberg spend most of the day ripping tesla i’m now convinced of a few things most importantly do not listen to any of these condescending pundits and smarmy analysts whose track record is worse than flipping a coin if you did you lost a lot of opportunity with tesla and will into the future

i have a theory that current investors of tesla also have moderate to large exposure to btc with btc correcting nearly 25 off its weekend high it is very likely that their investment portfolios are down double digits if either of these assets fall further there may be a tidal wave of selling
just an observation shorts are not going after this stock anymore so there will be no more squeezes the price is completely driven by retail investors who are simply having fomo and like kramer said simply because this stock didnt go down for a long time in the past several days ark has sold its shares of tsla more and more articles of overvaluation are coming out so my question is it time to sell or hold till 0127

lets assume that tsla gets to 50 marketshare tomorrow and then holds it indefinitely this is not a reasonable assumption but humor me further lets assume a 5 net margin vs 189 most recently now the worldwide market for new vehicles number of vehicles x average selling price is around 28t so tsla would get 14t and would earn 70b 5 net margin now since weve assumed growth stops at 50 marketshare a reasonable pe would be 12 no more growth just dividends so 12 x 70b is 840b which is basically what the market cap is today good jobnow tsla has other businesses and they could get more than 50 marketshare and the market for new vehicles in 2030 is expected to be 34t not 28t and they can make money from subscriptions etc but seriously tesla vehicles are great but teslas stock no longer is jmho

it is so obvious that tsla shares will be shortage due to the portfolio balancing of hedge funds managers why do you sell your shares
tesla is a risky volatile stock plain and simple as long as you know that going in its finei did not put all my portfolio into tesla and have some very good stable dividend stocks to balance out the risky plays to those that say tesla is over valued i agree but many things in life arebuy or don’ t buy your call but why bash those that have
i hope tesla shorts had taken there 10 profit otherwise there will be more homeless shorts and that will increase unemployment numbers
i see the same chart pattern tsla had last year when it went from 600 then 700  then 1000 then going all the way to 2000 hang in longs this stock is going for a second split early 2022
this will test 600 this week
do a low pe ration means your paying less for a company with little to no future growth and a high pe means your paying a lot for a company that is either over priced or is over developing now i get it teslas pe of 1000 means we’re paying a lot for the company but the company is giving us a lot back in return this makes perfect sense so if you study teslas future you see that we are not paying too much money for a car company like tesla because it is growing what a novel idea i like that i think i will buy more shares on monday
so because 2 analysts said they think tesla will have delivered over 500k cars this year tslas market cap goes up today by 5x the entire market cap of the next smallest by production numbers automaker mazda mazda sold over 500k cars in the first half of the year

question for the shorts and anyone with a view if we are expecting a correction in the price next week how do we factor in the sizeable holdings of sp tracker funds now as long as tesla remains a component of the sp i would imagine a huge chunk of the shares bought in december 70m on december 18th alone wouldnt be sold off anytime soon right any selling would be from smaller retail investors  investment funds with more discretion would be crazy to assume that as it is now part of the sp there is a lot passive capital that will remain invested in tesla and therefore keep a floor on any upcoming selloff
healthy pullback or have we peaked
bought 1 share at 799 all i could afford atm im so late to this train but yolo
my recommendation is dont sell at all if you do need to sell sell the original investment or portion of the original investment only let the profits play

for anyone that has studied bubbles if everyone is saying it’s a bubble it’s not a bubble only when most if not all of the skeptics capitulate and buy in believing outsized gains are the new normal does a bubble at risk of bursting take hold tesla is still too early in its life cycle there are still an enormous number of skeptics as can be seen i’m holding at least 3 years possibly 5 there is still massive growth ahead for this company once everyone buys in to tesla’s world changing products and services only then will i consider selling
almost 4000  for 1 tesla share 
people ask why tesla keeps jumping higher and higher for long investors like me we hold tesla not because it is a car company but because of its unlimited innovations led by musk team in addition tesla is like apple for at least now in which products are not the main source of income but software also the mushroom effects between space x and tesla is very obvious and the more success of space x is the more revenues for tesla furthermore the pioneering works for providing the world with cheap unlimited internet connection can make anyone speechless and the amazing innovations and skyrocket sales of its state of the art solar system which is the cheapest in usacan generate unlimited revenues for tesla  last tesla has the biggest gigafactories in the world which it will help the company to produce more cars and their total monopoly on cell batteries industry will enable it to sell their cars for 24 k each in three years because if a company can control the costs more mass production and more cheaper prices than all competitors
this is your last chance to buy at this discounted price power buying will begin tomorrow and tsla is headed towards 800 by the end of next week get in now before you miss the train

looks like its trying to decide to go up today question  we all know s and p funds will have to add tesla the day it is added to s and p 500 on dec 18 presumably at close and trades monday dec 21 for first time in s and p on the 18th at 515 pm we also learn which stock will be taken out of index with tesla market cap i read that every 10 dollar swing in tesla will sway entire s and p by one point  i m a bit confused on how the s and p funds will have to re balance and what that will do to tsla if tesla equal 16 percent market cap of s and p then will those funds have to have 16  of tesla in their fund that means lots of buying of tesla  or they will trim all their positions in their fund so they have to buy less amount of tesla but tesla will still be 16  of their fund  is that correct  either way the demand for tsla will be huge and i guess the 5 billion offering will be served up that day to help prevent huge volatility but the offering is only 1 percent of float so it still seems to me that the demand will outstrip supply and if that is the case tsla should run  it seems too obvious thats why i dont like it seen too many times stocks run on anticipation of news and then when drug or rocket launch or news stock sells off but in this case its not going to be peoples emotions its large funds mandated to buy the stock  again seems to obvious what am i missing  so not sure why everyone is not thinking for at least until dec 21 this thing will set new high above 700 now after the 21 st i think this will gradually fall back to 500 as it is way overbought overvalued and has come too fast too quickly anyhow now me and my 100 shares are along for the ride  would welcome and be thankful for what and why tsla will do on dec 21 and the days leading up thanks in advance b3

investing in tesla was the best decision of my life

watch the stock go up 10x in the first quarter next year it seems that many funds have yet to buy they must think that tsla will go down ha it ain’t going downthere’s going to be such a stampede to buy in and the thing is that no one is selling and no one will sell until the price is rightfor me the right price is at least 10000 per share
q4 earnings will be a blowout stock above 1000 for sure record amount of cars were sold i expect at least 350 in earnings per share which would take the pe ratio to 59

cathy woods he elon is a provocative soul and he is brilliant hes our renaissance man and what we should have done is keep our eye on the prize we believe that tesla will be in a poll position to dominate because of its advantages in artificial intelligence and the amount of data it has collected and the ai expertise that it has according to her teslas battery technology was already three to four years ahead of the competition tesla has 15 billion miles of real world driving data collected and the next closest is google with 25 million

guys reminder goldman sachs price target for tesla is 780 and ark invests price target for tesla is 7000 presplit  still a long way up to go 
there is no way tesla will go down to 90jp morgan do not seem to be consistent with their analysis they bask tesla so they can push it down and then buy back in at a lower price and they are an underwriter for doordash which opened today at 180 valuing dash at over 30bwe are always being played by these financial companies each and every daydo your own due diligence research the companies and the founders see what their annual profits are then stick with the planthere are still some honest analysts keep up with the cnbc midday group and also cramerwatch out for the others

one of the potential contributing reasons the sp rose so dramatically in the last couple of weeks was due to call buying and market makers needing to cover their positions by buying the stock if there is a selloff and the call options begin to get sold and closed will this have the contra effect of market makers then selling the stock because they no longer need to cover the call contract if this is the case then we could see a cascading selling effect due to closing down open call positions anyone have any insight to this possibility

i have to admit scrolling through the board is pretty shocking to see the number of negative posts about tsla despite its incredible achievement this year it is also encouraging to see the number of supporter who believe in this company i noticed quite a number of shorties talking about tsla production and delivery achievements as fraud a common example cited is enron let’s look at the fact enronis now bankrupt and arthur anderson the largest cpa firm in the world is now out of business because of the scandal we should have faith in the system that pricewater house has the integrity as a public firm not signing of its report on tsla if there is any doubt i think we have to have faith in the system a bit

the analyst comments while the range of outcomes is admittedly high the market has ‘chosen’ to ascribe a higher level of discounted value to tesla than that typically discounted for its peers despite the extraordinary run in the share price we continue to believe that tesla can outperform vs our sector in 2021 in our opinion tesla is still the best positioned company in evs and avs under our coverage due to its people its technology business model and access to capital furthermore it is important to note that the company has no entanglement with the environmental liabilities that burden its legacy competition put it all together and we believe teslas business model can unlock recurring mobility services revenue faster and more profitably than the competition we struggle to find a more innovative company with the ability to execute against the high degree of difficulty inherent in sustainable transportation and energy at scale we reckon its a rather short list

id be careful on predicting the sp 500 demand on dec 21 since we dont know how that is going to play out ie some have already bought in the nasdaq i seriously doubt moneymanagers are going to be falling over one another trying to buy on the dec 21 yes they are supposed to keep a ratio proportion of the sp 500 stocks but keep in mind the level of contempt against elon from wall street ie 80 valuations etc i think they are planning to drop it by 100 within days if not hours of the sp inclusion as well those requirements to adjust portfolios arent not law and all money managers have flexibility to buy over time not just on dec 21 st as implied also on the cusp of the sp 500 inclusion jp morgan said they are advising money manager clients to not buy tesla stock at these valuations so if you need to sell consider anything over 650 im a tesla bull but that is a high price to pay assuming the future will play out perfectly
tesla will halve very very soon the valuation is massivly too much ridicolous 175180 te cars 4 th quarter in total maybe 650 te per year and a valuation of 625 mio eurovolkswagen and toyota sell 10 mio cars per year profitable and with a lot of models for each segment tesla is one car show but has the valuation of all car companies togetherthis is not explainable and nothing else but a big fraud hence the bubble will burst dramaticallyapple attacks tesla in its heart disruption will tesla will kill teslas market value to minimum 50
pe ratio is 1600 doesnt that mean their market cap is 1600 times that of their annual earnings
tesla is not overvalued it is the entire market that is overvalued until the market crashes i will not be suprised to see more non sense meltups
ok so you have to finish the jokewhat did elon say when he was told he is now the worlds richest man
now lets move to 850
flying high and going higher
when i invest in a stock i always ask if i can double my investment thats why i dont invest herethere is too much risk for such a little profir right nowpeople who buy now do you think it will double i thinks it is going to drop 50 rather than double
tesla to start making the tesla phones and tesbook laptop in 2 years time to compete with apple apple to make the ev appl car
setup for delivery of new model y before christmas planned on selling some tsla stock to partially pay for it but decided to hold on and sell other stocks instead tsla is too valuable to sell now because of the coming uptick for its s  p inclusion demand for tesla bevs are off the chart and the s and x production shutdown on the 24th for 18 days to expedite deliveries of all their bevs tesla in 2021 will be a barn burner for production and deliveries from fremont china germany and texas the next 5 quarter’s of tsla numbers will tell the tail of manufacturing over one million bevs add texas 2021 cybertruck and semi deliveries and it gets even better “tsla is a new disruptive auto company that may or may not be dominant in the longterm but that does not matter as long as it can keep funding outsized growth with almost nocost capital driving capacity expansion which justifies a high stock price writes bac analyst john murphykeep this up and there’ll be a new cybertruck in my garage by next christmas yo ho ho 
don’t forget about earnings in a week
nio now has better batteries than tsla which can also retrospectively be upgraded in older cars within 5min better cameras for autonomous by about 6x lidar which tesla doesnt use nio has without question positioned itself as the pure ev play for anyone wishing to invest in the worlds biggest ev market not li or xpeng
tesla was unstoppable in 2020 but 2021 is a much different story with gm ford xpeng nio and many more all bringing competitive evs to the marketplace tesla 2023 growth numbers going forward are not necessarily something they can achieve anymore gm working with geely blackberry xpeng has fsd and a new car nio is planning on manufacturing a less expensive car and they have introduced a new battery tech offering staggering amounts of range with 1000k as an almost average 150kw battery pack tesla is scooped by the solid state lion ipo spinoff for nio and virtually every country now has evs and most are much lower cost than teslas and remain unexposed to the ev behemoth teslas blind spot is the sub 25000 ev auto and i think they will be beaten to the finish line with many other competent ev manufacturers already closer to that goal tesla is manufacturing 4 different types vehicles out of  100200 different vehicles types used today   that will be needed to replace ice vehicles when tesla goes down which is personally believe 2021 will be the year it will take the whole ev industry with it but fast rising names will be nio gm xpeng li byd and maybe even ford the future is unwritten its time to hedge
i bet they run this thing to 1000 right up until earnings on jan 21 then they blow out earnings and it pops another 250 to 1250 on jan 22then musk announces another split and they run it to 1600 have seen it before

raise your hand if youd buy a car without an engine or battery nio sells car shells for a whopping 50k and then youd have to rent the battery hahaha nio
im sure this will eventually be higher but this is due for a big bitcoin style collapse remember when bitcoin fell from 19k to 3k and took years before making new highs i can see tesla doing something similar and falling to 200300 and taking years to make it back up
we all knew and expected some volatility this week so this is actually quite mild considering it will be well worth the wait

hey shorts looks like another successful green day is coming right d
i trimmed my tsla position i still have some credit put backratios on for march but nothing earlier than that i also have some small number of shares short but overall my tsla position is nearly delta neutral i would still appreciate a very sudden and violent down move but if it does not happen i am ok too i may now add to the position using june contracts or may instead add bearish positions in other stocks a number of these recent ipo spacs are overbloated pure speculation and a number of them will go to zero the bearish opportunities are everywhere right now i am always on the lookout for the perfect bear trade that is where the opportunity is right now these are the trades i want there is so much more potential downside right here than upside yes the fed keeps printing money but the speculative fervor has gotten out of control

an unbelievable growth company sitting under your nose and most cant see it tesla haters keep comparing it to car manufacturers and no clear vision to see whats around the corner all antiquated ideas you need to look at the big picture no matter how many new evs are rolled out by ice manufacturers tesla stll delivered 500000 units and has 3 billion miles worth of autonomous driving data in a time where data is king ask yourself this how many more billion miles worth of data will tesla have by the time ice manufacturers catch up to teslas deliveries of 500k units now ask yourself this with 3 new manufacturing plants coming live for tesla 1 in germany 1 in texas and 1 in india how many more units will tesla deliver over its competition now look at the expense structure for both manufacturers tesla doesnt have a combustion engine division that needs to phase out tesla also is on its way to manufacturing its own battery and already produces its autonomous driving chip it alsi does not have contracts and licenses with dealer franchises tesla sells and services direct to the customer doesnt have to change its eco system who will be more profitable they will easily dominate the industry and i didnt even mention semi trucks and the home solar roof division

if youre going to stress you shouldnt be in the stock market im not an experienced trader but i can tell you stress will make you lose more than what you earn im going to be patient and see how this turns out
i love tsla and believe in its long term potential but these movements over the past year seem to have all the hallmarks of a classic pump  dump by these major institutional investors some of the recent price targets have been indefensible 800 its not supported by the fundamentals elon musk himself said the stock was overvalued 7mo and 400 gains ago 160 post split at the time and very little about the fundamentals have changed the sp inclusion has given the perfect crescendo to this runup as retail investors believe that these funds need to keep buying and buying and buying until 1221 but it is just as likely these institutions are pumping these gains more likely some combination of the two what if these whales start dumping before 1218 with their massive ytd gains it feels so risky and so speculative to try and guess the top of this and get out before it drops when the selling starts this will likely fall so hard and so fast it could erase the last three months or 50i again am long term bullish on tesla i love musk and the company and see growth potential for the business itself i just feel like it makes much more sense to wait until the inevitable pullback in the coming weeks before taking a positioni know this comment will get heat on here but i do not have a short position i just want to understand can anyone convince me that this is not a pump and dump scheme ie that these buying patterns are organic
staying away from tesla this thing will crash and burn i am neither long nor short but amazed at the money chasing this thing
everyone and there uncle is gonna be talking about three things over the thanksgiving weekend turkey gravy train and tesla winning maybe some politics and covid too
everywhere i turn i see a tesla on the east coast on some of the most densely populated states in the country when you go to their website theres no form to fill out with updates on availability its here and now on the roads this very moment with one heck of an infrastructure to back it up there is no antiquated car buying middle man system where you barter for the price of the vehicle everything is manufacturer direct no independent dealers and complete transparency not only revolutionizing the vehicle but the car buying experience as well long overdue
targeted with their first big class action lawsuit involving driver safety will teach elon and tesla what the auto industry is really like
tesla will be 1000 next year
musk  heres an idea seeing as apple would like to infringe on your ev turf how about a smart phone that puts customers first one that doesnt track us and sell our privacy out to advertisers we currently have two options in apple and google neither of which put customers privacy first elon musk has saved the environment with electric cars and saved the space industry with reusable rockets  save humanity with privacy respecting smart phones and take a chunk of iphone profitsmarketshare in the process

my trip to the service center a controldevice board had a lte device on it went out i called the roadside service and the guy on the phone was able to get my cars logs and verified the problem message it was throwing was a bad antenna at this time they didnt know if it was the device board or the antenna so i took the car in to the service center they mechanics hooked up a computer and in 5 mins they told me they were going to install a new mcu it took less than 30 mins what took all the time was the software updates i guess they had to run 3 or 4 updates to bring it up to the latest update the whole process took 2 hrs and 30 mins car works perfect again while there i was able to talk to the guy that was my delivery specialist this is the go to guy for facts i asked the burning question about fit and finish as i had a hard time with the monroe report on how bad m3s were i said i found a few minor problems in the lot cars ok there have been problems he pointed out a bumper on one that wasnt seated correctly but on the whole the cars are good obviously things have become much better over the early production and this car will have the clip engaged before delivery as i stated earlier delivery hell starts in q3 and q4 now i suspect there will be a bunch of shorts blasting my car but tesla was great getting this resolved in short order so i give them a 10 on service they even offered a wash which i had already done earlier in the day the service center was spotless with white floors no oil gas smells or exhaust fumes nice waiting room with wifi and coffee there was no yogurt machines or popcorn service people kept me abreast of the results and process at first they offered me a p100d ms oh mama i can say speeding ticket for oily would have been guaranteed i told them i wanted to take the mx on a camping trip over the long weekend yep sleeping in the mx with my gf on a blow up mattress with memory foam going into the wilds

quantumscapes solid state battery technology in development it is suggested that this new dry electrode battery that eliminates a step in manufacturing and ensures a much longerlife battery making the liquid components dry more stable would be a tesla killer imo elon would most likely release a competing battery technology before qs can actually have a material impact on the market teslas economies of scale and technological superiority are virtually impossible for a startup to catch never mind exceed at the end of the day the qs battery tech will help tesla by forcing it to further its lead in the market and stay ahead of the ev solid state battery curve so hedge your bet and buy some qs but i suggest there is nothing to be concerned about

anyone heard of puge bought the dip risking 500 with 250k shares catalyst soon
is this the future of tesla´s share price  what is your opinion tesla valuation completely detached from fundamentals on the contrary teslas stock is now so far detached from the companys fundamentals that it now exists in a kind of valuation twilight zone after all the ecar maker is now more valuable in terms of market capitalization than the entire auto industry was at the start of 2019 with a current market capitalization tesla is even ahead of warren buffetts investment vehicle berkshire hathaway 5424 billion except that berkshire reported ebit of 106 billion in the last fiscal year while teslas was 06 billion this fact alone is remarkable in addition however tesla is increasingly having to fight for its market position in europe after all the competition has now also realized that electric vehicles have great potential for the future furthermore the car market is generally tied to the development of the economy and would grow at its pace if not slower to justify the current price tesla would have to dominate the global car market in the next few decades and there is little evidence of that cornell capital summarizes the three scenarios but what does this mean for the future of tesla stock in order to come up with three future scenarios here the analysis firm took a closer look at the electric car makers numbers and derived a base bear and bull forecast from them spoiler none of the scenarios foresees a further increase in teslas share price for the base case scenario cornell capital group assumes rapid growth and industryleading operating margins for tesla for this case tesla stock should end up at a price of 14471 measured against the current share price this would represent a whopping 77 percent drop the bull scenario also assumes stronger growth but only arrives at an implied share price of 30111 us dollars and then there is the bear scenario which continues to assume that tesla is a successful carmaker but sees the share price at just 7271 us dollars  a discount of almost 89 percent according to cornell capital this analysis shows that tesla is not only overvalued but unleashed so what to do if the stock market experts have their way sell tesla shares short

tesla is one of the most over valued stocks ever companies are valued or should be on the basis of a stream of likely earnings in the future to value it sensibly at  800 billion it would have to be able to generate profits of around 50bn a year in fairly short order that is simply not possible the car market is intensely competitive tesla is now being outsold by three other companies in europe i suspect the big fall will come after 27th january 2021 the cult like followers are anticipating incredible results when they are merely in line with expectations perhaps a sense of reality will set in moods change very quickly in markets
will it happen1000 market price
tesla cannot just meet expectations at the current price it has to blow numbers away priced to perfection and produce “less” than is 5075 points down get used to misses and going down going to be a dark 2021

why does barron’s cnbc et al give gordon johnson publicity at all destroying their own credibility
from motley fool todays article sorry longs to ruin your partyto justify an 800 billion valuation tesla has to grow quickly  and for a long time if the electric vehicle maker only quadruples its sales over the next decade the stock is bound to plunge sooner or later even if tesla develops meaningful ancillary profit streams over time eg recurring services revenue battery sales to other automakers an autonomous ridehailing network etc the company would probably need to grow sales to at least 10 million vehicles annually to justify its current valuation it would also have to sustain margins far better than any other major automaker has ever managed
elon musk is  the revolution   he built spacex from nothing till beating ba completely tsla is one of the greatest innovation that most of the ice oems want to kill also the oil companies i believe that auto industry is completely change by elon musk tsla has every thing that nobody has i really love what toyatas ceo talked down tsla i believe it is a very positive motivation that will push elon musk keep pushing the envelope even sooner probably  25000 car will become real sooner than every thing i guess early 2022 will be the year that tsla will tear down the japaneses car empire in the us prius camry accord and civic will face the real challenge that they never know before it exists hydrogen is a big joke solid state battery has cost problem which tsla already experienced plus tsla is never stay still  game over

i think tsla was around 408 before the sp inclusion announcement and hit 695 right at the close before the rebalance started that is a 70 increase almost 300 this should drop a lot a 30 drop from 695 to 485 would not be unreasonable and would still be up almost 20 from before the announcement that is still way higher than most companies move after being added to the sp
im all in with f gm stla pcrfy and ge they are still cheap especially when you compare them with tesla this is where you need to be if you want the next tsla stock
it would be nice if just one person could justify the price with math
buy for life or day trade options short whatever all in  if it gets to 1000 i can retire imho
tesla permabulls can say what they want but tesla has yet to prove their business model until their fundamentals catch up to their valuation they and their investors havent won
do longs really believe that fund managers will wake up on the 22nd and just then realize they need to increase their stake in tsla and hit the buy button that is so cute
institutions own too many shares to try and leave retail “bag holders” price is too high for that game not enough retail i the game on this pricey stock

tesla’s run has been so powerful that many bearish investors have abandoned their moneylosing bets sending short positions on the stock to a record low short interest in the stock as a percentage of shares available for trading recently fell to a low of 5 down from roughly 18 earlier in the year ihs markit data shows
extremely good earnings from tesla next week  if its actually materializing is already priced in with a 100 gain in the stock price in the last 2 monthsfrom this next week earnings one can only expect to remain at this level of valuation at best or going down sharply conclusion  not much to gain but much more chances to loose from next weeks earningsobviously  longs should have this in mind 
earnings will take this over 1000
i have a feeling gm will take over nio and scale a lot faster than nio or xpev or li i am going to bet 12 of nio money invested into gm and keep tsla shares where it is  soon to be millionaire with stocks onlyless than a year away
tesla will double sales and double stock lrice with cyber truck and full self drive in 2021 stay long and remember tesla is the chosen one

tesla is a no brainer stock buy and hold and get easy returns unless you want to day trade for faster gains
when consumers sit down and compare in chinaa nio vs teslathe consumers go with the nio over the tsla it only makes sense and you would too if you took out personal biases from country origin you would pick the nio too the thing is the vehicle is the 2nd biggest investment youll ever make next to real estate nio surpasses tesla and i think tesla owners know that too as of right now nio offers more quality and servicefor the lower end market do you want a tesla or a byddf or xpev yes there are luxury automakers in the ev market but none of them offer anywhere near what nio has in autonomous technology services and product which is why nio will win market cap from the luxury market i see it because as a consumer even i would buy a nio
this run is amazing congrats for those that held on i offloaded before the split made great profit but those that held are loving it

most people on this board are not understanding the role low interest rates have played in soaring pes even with the fed plowing money into bonds the 10yr rate has jumped bigly to start the year what this means is that companies have to increase earnings by the same amount or else stocks will plummet watch the interest rates very closely if they keep rising at some level they will trigger a sell off
subsidiary waymo announced in its blog that henceforth the company would address its mobility services as fully autonomous driving technology and ditch the term selfdrivingwhat happened starting with the fullyautonomous labeling waymo’s blog said that its technology is distinctly separate from the driver assistance systems of other automakers that require human interventionwhile waymo didnt name any automaker directly it has contested the claims of tesla incs nasdaq tsla full selfdriving being at par with its autonomous driving technology before waymo said that accurately wording the technology could also save lives of late tesla has been mired in safetyrelated controversies which picked up much more steam after a fatal crash in south korea led to two people being injured and one fatalityat the beginning of 2020 tesla faced 14 scrutinies by the us national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa for accidents that involved its autopilot systemswhy does it matter waymo clarified that erroneously branding driver assists as fully autonomous sends a wrong message to auto buyers and enthusiasts the post suggested that misleading impressions could inflate the ability of the vehicle and result in an unnecessary risk to drivers passengers and others on the roadunfortunately we see that some automakers use the term selfdriving in an inaccurate way giving consumers and the general public a false impression of the capabilities of driver assist not fully autonomous technology waymo saidthat false impression can lead someone to unknowingly take risks like taking their hands off the steering wheel that could jeopardize not only their own safety but the safety of people around them

once the sellers dry up which i think are banks and hedge funds that accumulated shares in the recent dips then the price will jump retail buyers do not have the power to manipulate a stock like this my opinion only but once 7080 million shares are sold and once the price crosses 650share they will be hard pressed to keep a lid on the price
wow this is the best stock deal going probably 10x after this incredible earnings beat
i estimate tsla to have 40 million individual investors that is a lot of advocates and potential customers and there is still plenty of investors from the 150 million direct stock investors in the world to come onboard the tsla train

tesla earns more in ev credits every quarter than profits from car sales and energy storage without ev credits tesla is still not profitable i dont know when but those credits will go away at which time tesla will need to rely only on its business for profits the current forward pe assumes that these credits are part of the business for the foreseeable future

i don’t get it now is it a car company or not if it isn’t why the hell is the us transportation authorities involved in this and are making them recall cars tesla is not a car company and also why is all of sudden everybody saying other car companies have much much more recalls i mean again it’s not a car company it’s a company that derives 94 of its revenues from selling cars but the profits comes entirely from the operations of green energy certificates people needs to keep that in mind and should write to the transportation authorities complaining about why are they really getting involved in a software energy robotaxi and tequila companies business and they should be focusing their efforts of gm ford vw toyota and other car makers and leave the companies that merely drive 94 of their revenues from manufacturing and selling cars alone as they are not car companies but rather software bla bla bla and whatnot companies

just think all of the deliveries the company will announce on monday will not be potential customers for q1 2021 musk has already picked the low level fruit he has a limited number of potential customers that want to buy a tesla after theyve bought your likely customer base has dried up a bit where will he find new customers theres a lot of competition coming and tsla with a pe of 1417 needs to sell a lot more cars to justify that pe plus they need a lot of margin and i understand to prop up current quarter sales musk is droppiing prices thus less margin last thing i knew my milennial aged kids werent flocking to tsla to buy a car they were buying suvs and minivans from jeep and chrysler i think its 40 to 50 year old men buying tslas but soon they will be contemplating buying the ford mustang i dont see tsla numbers growing i see tsla being a fad a phenomenon and yes the stock price a ponzi scheme

today and tomorrow mehfriday and monday yeh
i love shorts they sound scared good sign this is a great investment
imagine if you shorted tesla my god hope your ok
the big rise of tesla has started because a little bit of profit has been made it can also be an accounting trick musk offered his tesla to apple but apple did not respond tesla has risen like a comet in 2020 another split and for dessert tesla went to the sp 500 tesla has shown a huge increase in 2020 happy new year and a lot of strength for the shorters because there are happy shareholders but there are also people who are in a lot of pain this year ago i empathize with them
elon is anxious worried and desperate to keep the stock price at this level he is saying many things to prop up the stock like  impossible taking tesla private etc these nervousness are highly visible at the same time market is noticing increased competition increased new entrants with higher production targets tesla is losing its early mover advantage elon thinks he can talk his way and prop up the stock but the market is having a bigger stick hidden behind their back and would not hesitate to use it if tesla disappoints on any metrics

lets lay out a few facts tesla keeps lowering pricescompetitors are increasing their ev sales despite the lower prices from teslatesla shipped chinaproduced cars to europe even though they just entered the chinese market and had supposedly huge demandtesla has the most capital ever and could potentially raise billions more capital why wouldnt they be building out more factories more quickly with such easy access to capital if demand is so high the reality is that tesla wont dominate the global auto markets they arent even taking the appropriate steps to do so they should be working on 5 or more new factories right now if there was even the slightest chance of dominating the auto markets globally

100000 next week yes sir
people need to realize that tsla is truly a life time opportunity to buy in to a company that is literally changing the world for the better over the years people have dreamed of getting in to companies like microsoft and amazon that have changed our lives today this dream is a reality if you have the stones to buck the naysayers and embrace a great company with an incredible visionary leader for those of you who look at the financials of tsla and claim that we are in a bubble take a second to research the pe ratios of amzn and fb earlier on when they were establishing their foundations for success you will find that amazon had a pe of over 3700 and fb over 1400 there are many examples of extremely high pe ratios for companies starting out that went on to change the way you navigate in this world tsla is only in the 2nd inning of this ball game stay strong bulls and don’t let the shorts make you look in the rear view mirror some day and regret your decisions merry christmas

is this the right time to buy tsla
does it strike anyone else as odd thata tesla rose 150 billion in market cap  almost the value of toyota simply by announcing inclusion into the sp basically a paper transaction that adds no real value and in fact will make tesla’s numerous accounting frauds face greater scrutinyb that small investors are paying over 500 billion for a car company which has never produced a car profitablyin its entire existencec that small investors are paying over 500 billion for a car company which still can’t produce a high quality vehicle ranking near dead last in consumer reports  quality issues so extreme that customers are finding human hair in the paint jobd that “analysts” continue to spout absurd price targets for tesla stock but never seem to raise their capes figure to account for the money that will need to be spent to achieve that imaginary growth
i see a democratic sweep in georgia as favorable for tesla shares because more money printing favorable regulatory environment for evon the flip side democratic control of senate could mean higher corporate tax rates which could possibly result in a general market correction with tesla already grossly overpriced i suppose either result could result in the stock selling off

hey tesla long term investorswhenever i see a research analyst doing one of these doom and gloom prediction on tsla price i start to pay attention jp morgan analyst ryan brinkman in december upgraded tsla price from 8090 and i was like whats up with that with a sell rating because i have about 45 of my portfolio tied to tsla and i want to make sure i see what he is seeing so i did some research on what the guy is about i just want to report back that i dont have too much to worry about and let me explainthe guy is a legit automotive research analyst having more than 10 years of research experience in the automotive sector my problem is not with what background he has but its what he does not we all know there has not been a whole lot of innovations in the automotive industry except tsla until this year when all the automotive legacy companies jump on the bandwagon because of tslas established success in this area but we all know tsla is not just an ev manufacturer its also autonomous drivingartificial intelligence battery technology with current production unlike another company called qs energy storage robotics software development car insurance hvacetc now how could a guy like that covering all these areas with just automotive research background with a master degree in accounting oh my god just we need another research analyst with accounting background if its that simple joe from our own chat room can do his job easily i think an ideal person for this type of analyst has to have a combo of 57 years of auto manufacturing industry 23 years of sw industry 2 years of artificial intelligencerobotics experience and a couple years of solar energy solutions industry an analyst with this combination of experience would be very expensive for investment banks but its absolutely necessary to cover a company such as tsla welladditionally i always want to see what credibility does this guy have i have extracted some information on brinkmans past performance from tipranka site which keeps the performance of stock research analystsand share with everyone in the forumranked 6701 out of 7182 analysts on tipranks 14083 out of 15010 overall expertsaverage return of ratings he gave out 44i dont know about you but why is the media even give this guy the time of the day given that terrible performance record

average volume is around 50mil give or take a day if at the close we saw approximate 220mil on the day and 220 mil or approximate 86 bil needed for rebalance due to required inclusion into the sp 500 indexespassive mimic portfolios the math would conclude that there is still demand for a minimum of an additional 50 mil shares right now these shares are not available at the moment there is an in balance in tesla share trading because of low remaining shares availablefloat supply and high current share demand this creates and upward sp and share selling on the economics of decisions based on the higher price overtime as the price moves up more decisions will be made to sell shares this will free up shares to be purchased at higher and higher prices until balance is restored imo there is even more demand than reported as investors are going to go into a buying frenzy for shares as shares prices rocket even other funds that dont hold tsla by requirement will want to show having held a position in tsla in their portfolios to print having a position during the q4 and 2020 i foresee much volatility in ps thru jan 2021 with the price moving much much higher i wouldnt be surprised to see 8501050 by mid feb

the chinese market will only have red numbers for tesla they are gonna try to lower the prices to destroy the newcomers but the chinese government will subsidize them and will sell resources at a premium to tesla you need to know that most rare earth minerals come from chinayou need to understand that the bashing of chinese companies in the west will have an effect on how these western companies can do business in chinagiven the fact that china produces most goods in the world and they actually have started fighting pollution ev numbers in china will quickly risei remember when i was in china 2018 and lots of scooters had electric motors like really old ones and they just turned them electric when the chinese start moving into something its going to happen very quick and surpass the developing speed that is usually found in the westthe daughter of huaweis ceo is still under arrest in canada awaiting extradition to the us a few days ago canada blocked the acquisition of tmac resources by a chinese company this will have consequences and because the chinese market of evs will rise the fastest tesla will try to get more market share but they can only do that by creating more red numbers

just remember tesla contains  a dozen of startup companies within it
to potential tesla stock buyers please read the following before buying sharestheres a lot of debate about the valuation of tesla proponents of the stock will recklessly promote it and will tell you not to believe posters like me they will tell you that i am spreading fud but i am honest and presenting the reality you should read the arguments from both side before risking your money in this stockto anyone considering tesla understand that 1 it has had an amazing run that defied all standard expectations for a stock given the companys actual financial performance 2 past stock performance is not an indicator of future results 3 by every metric of company valuation tesla is grossly overpriced 4 tesla has overpromised and underdelivered repeatedly with respect to its products and 5 tesla does not have any lock or monopoly on any of its businessyou can believe in tesla the company its supposed mission and elon musk but none of that means that the current price for the stock is appropriate or sustainable proponents or bulls will regurgitate that its the future without elaborating they will tell you its more than a car company despite well over 90 of its revenue coming from cars sales they will disregard competition from existing automakers and new ev startups they will do just about anything besides admit that they have been wildly lucky and hit the equivalent of the lottery with teslas past year runup so just think about it before you buy
tesla just broke the record of light speed someone call guiness book of records
tesla cheats it’s investor calculating always with percentagesthat’s a big fraud you also have to consider the numbers absolute and these totals in prices shows the dilemma and what a big fraud the valuation is teslas fanboys ignoring this factto have 60 growth of one product like models y is not a good message in totals it is ridicolous and there is also a cannibalism effect with respect to model 3this shows all press releases focus on one good number while there are many bad numbers included  when there is a correct interpretation the valuation is the biggest bubble ever and will cost many shareholders big losses90 is my prediction jan 20 reuters  tesla incs vehicle registrations in the us state of california jumped nearly 63 during the fourth quarter compared with last year largely due to the success of the companys model y according to data from crosssell httpsinfocrosssellcomteslaspecialreport0 a research firm that collates title and registration datathe automaker reported betterthanexpected 2020 vehicle deliveries earlier this month driven by a steady rise in electric vehicle adoption even though it narrowly missed its ambitious fullyear goal of half a million deliveries during a punishing year for the global auto industrythe report released on wednesday showed registrations in california a bellwether for the electric carmaker and its largest us market recovered from a thirdquarter low of about 16200 vehicles to around 22117 vehicles in the three months ended decemberat about 11417 registrations in the state for teslas model y compact crossover utility vehicle surpassed those for the model 3 california registrations for teslas model 3 massmarket sedan fell 34 on a yearly basis to 7044total fourthquarter vehicle registrations in the 23 states where data was collected stood at 44749 with model y accounting for nearly half the registrationsregistration figures might not accurately reflect the number of vehicle deliveries during the quarter as registrations in the united states typically take about 30 days from the time of saletesla whose shares surged over 700 in 2020 is expected to report fourthquarter results after market close on jan 27 reporting by akanksha rana and ayanti bera in bengaluru and tina bellon in new york editing by vinay dwivedi

tesla makes nice cars the companys fair value should be about 70 or about 70b but if you factor in future growth in all products and services in a bull case it might worth 140 or 150b just cant see how this is a 700 when projected revenue is between than 80b to 150b in five years

25k car to be on production lines and delivered late 2022
jim cramer loves tesla that alone will move this stock higher close green today
lol elon is probably bidding up his own stock just to mess with the shorts why would anyone buy this at a pe over 1500
tesla is surely heading higher here as 1000 is a nice round number
double digit pullback today it’s gonna be a bad week
so elon closed factory for 18 days and offers only weeks pay for employee better yet he tells them to volunteer in other parts of the company since they will not be working  elon what a cheap sob
tesla will be above 600 before dec 21st i recommend holding after 21st its your choice
i just sold my 200 tsla shares good luck all i hope i do not regret it
this is not a car company this is a tech company engineering company and an energy company does the stock price make sense now three companies in one
if tesla clears the 920am halt trading flag then take 66267 x 110 and look for 72893 about 94210 am  pure speculation  best to watch the ticker tape till noon  option premiums could be inflated both sides of the put call  only four trading days this week  maximum inout option window not to exceed 10 minutes holding any option more than 10 minutes would be high risk 
we all know tsla is the biggest bubble in the century regardless if it’s an auto or tech company though it may not burst for a long time for as long as wall street has stories to tell and they can continue blow it higher to make profits

in 1914 ford drastically increased workers wages to almost double the average working wage first to get better workers but an added bonus workers could afford the car they were makingits widely believed that henry ford also upped wages to expand his market — paying employees enough to buy the cars they made while that wasnt fords main motivation it was a welcome byproduct and a game changer says university of california berkeley labor economist harley shaikeni see something similar going on here in the tesla stock price going up investors in tesla stock seeing the value of the stock raising so much they can now buy a tesla im just curious how many have bought a tesla product car or solar panels from the money they made on their tesla stock im guessing people have done this with apple stock and products but the tesla products are big ticket items this could be a game changer in the stock market
incredible as they say at mcdonald’s i’m loving it
even if earnings come in line with expectations or better it is factual that competition is massive in 2021the future is going to be very bumpy for tesla all the carmakers are producing high quality ev in 2021
for tesla to have a pe of a still ungawdly height of 150 vs its currently insane 1500 it would have to have net earnings 10 times what they currently are or about 5 billion per qtr or gross profit of about 50 billion per qtr or a gross profit of 200 billion per yearthats 7 times teslas annual revenuesin other words teslas gross margins would have to be about 700 vs the current approx 22some clueless cult member please explain how tesla will sell cars with a 700 margin to get them to a pe of 150
60000000 share being shorted increase of 34 this is a good buy anywhere from 200  400 at 800 oi the end is near

bank of america assigns a new price objective of 900 to tesla nasdaqtsla as it moves forward its sliding scale of valuation based on the theoretical growth opportunity seen which is now consistent with 23x evsales prior 125x and 118x evebitda on the firms 20212022 estimates
i find it most interesting that rusch 1036 and ives 1250 new targets for the first time have not pushed tesla higher once upon a time in this fantasy world there long term targets would be hit in weeks in november ives raised his basecase stock price target to 560 from 500 best case you all fooled him so he more than doubled it basically in two short months say tesla is not a 560 billion dollar company but a 12 trillion dollar company yes 300 billion for the two existing and two to be built factories not enough cars built on the planet to support that number and you know what all of you bought it so why arent you buying it anymore
i am all in with 70 since 52300 i think the price will skyrocket in the first hours and then they wont let it close above 700 due to op ex thoughts

i missed the tesla run up far more downside than up at his point since valuations really dont matter i am going into nio the stock is more affordable per share and more upside yes tesla has better tech at this point that does not matter china is the biggest car market in the world nio has something that tesla can never have in china that being its a chinese company the chinese are very nationalistic and they will support their chinese companies more than americans will support american companies nio may not do well in america but they will do well in china much better in the long run than tesla will in china for that i think its a good investment
it would be nice to see everyone here be positive about the tsla stock
its monday morning the stock cant hold 600 all the hype about going into an index is gone what will be your investment thesis going forwardmusk getting paid billions more by you the shareholder congratulations you had a good year move on

ah heatherthis time its differentits not a car company they are mobile power plants to generate needed electricity to fuel the grid thats why there are government subsidies youll see when elon is the first trillionaire im in for the long haulexhausting
big bubble at the latest we should see tax related profittaking one week into the start of the new year i dont see any reason why anyone sitting on big profits would wait any longer than that as a minimum some funds are going to have to rebalance which means selling winners they dont want too much risk sitting in any one stock this stock is all about momentum and speculation and theres a lot of it so much happy talk right now apple is going to buy tesla tesla stock is going to split again on and on full bull and ready to burst
still another round of trades below 66590 just keeps repeating like i said easy trading keep buying low and keep selling high folks

tesla wins nhtsa 5 star rating up we goooooooo
i cannot believe the craziness on this boardnow tsla will cure lung cancerthe longs complain about how many times bubble is mentioned and i am sure the shorts are tired of hearing “it is not an auto company”haha lolkeep telling yourself thatwe will see how much it really is an auto company in 2021 when competition increases and sales and margins take a pounding
i am sure tim cook is a good guy good in accounting and operational but he does lack the visioning he will now have to answer to the board and investors why he did not even talk to elon musk instead he spent billions of dolllars on a car which has no deliverable to me stealth project is the equivalent of a failed project
a real risk that i haven’t seen posted in this blog yet is chairman xi’s response to us restrictions in chinese telecomspossibly he nationalizes tesla shanghai factory that would be a huge retaliation against us and wipe out at least 50 of tsla market cap
i just do not get tsla evaluation it got upgrade two days ago with pt of 810 and today is 60 over that

musk called teslas stock a souffle under a sledgehammer according to the report if the automaker cant start delivering real profits for the past five quarters the electric carmakers profits have largely come from regulatory credits the ceo said teslas actual profitability is very low at around 1 for the past year
all the bashers here saying when it crashes people will lose money well yeah but if they only give back some of what they gained it isnt losing ive only had shares since the end of november that i bought just under 550 it would have to drop 30 from the current levels and id still be even so anyone who has had it pre split is not going to lose sleep thinking they might go broke they have a ton of green to play with
id pay good money to be able to beech slap some of the negative nellies who are running around on this forum shouting how tesla shares are too high  that the sky will fall because of itif you negative nellies think tesla is too high then go buy another stock which you think is cheaper i hear amazon is a bargain at only 3200 a share
one of the challenges will be maintaining sales growth once people who want a tesla already own one it will be a while before they buy again the used market will eventually be flooded with these with phones they are cheap enough to upgrade every generation not so with cars till then ride the bull
analysts are not responsible for their assessments they only drag people into a delusion who have no idea about stock valuations they only help to improve their own margins why do we only see insider sales definitely not because the share is so cheap

ask any car dealership what their biggest obstacle in business is and the first thing theyll tell you is hiring qualified technicians with ice vehicles phasing out on the horizon this brings a tremendous advantage to tesla not only will they eat everyones lunch but they will also steal all their technicians automotive mechanic repair is a dying art already and tesla is taking advantage of this on large scale they are recruiting ice technicians and retraining them in technological advance ev repairs technicians across the us understand that the ice repair industry is changing fast and want a better future tesla has the upper hand here with more evs on the road than anyone else qualified techs are not going to wait for their employers to play catch up this is one perspective many have not thought of and unfortunately for other oems its again a clear disadvantage

tsla aka “total sunroof launcher apparatus”listen i’m invested in nio and tsla tesla blazed the trailelon is a visionarybutnio’s tech is unrivaled in the ev space they’ve essentially overcome the greatest hurdle for ev’s charging time with 150kw battery and 3 minute batt swapping on the way tsla is in big trouble in the end there’s room for all but if you want a 610 bagger in 510 years nio is where it’s atcase for nio 2000 a share tsla continues to have quality control issues as nio becomes largest ev company in europe and asia nio eventually becomes the number one seller of ev’s in the world through expanded production greater options smaller economy cars autonomous taxis busses and lauries watch out huge chunks of that tsla market cap will move to nio if baas takes off with other car companies nio could be worth 2500 a share easy not today not tomorrow but one day everything is on the table as we move rapidly towards full ev adoption across the globe who will have the quality and technology to manage thisfood for thought

just 2 month ago elon said 250mile car range does not make sense and cancel and now he bringing back clearly he lied and try to sell as many 50k as possible before bringing backnot sure how such person treated so good way normally if gm or ford do that we would have backlashworld sure going worst way regarding stock price sure i am poorer by almost 50k if this remain inflated may be even 90k if remain high but atleast i fight for sanity people are working to make thing worst end of day those dollar will worth 110th anyway
longs that have had skin in the game for a while give a thumbs up if you added today
too high a valuation for such a niche ev player the educated ev consumers of norway are perfect evidence where tesla places a dismal 7th with only 2081 sales top of the list was the audi etron with over 7000  which bodes well for its parent volkswagen mercedesbenz’s eqc and even the nissan leaf outsold it while the ofv’s statistics don’t break out electric from conventional sales for the vw golf and hyundai kona it would appear highly likely that their electric versions also easily outsold anything put on the market by tesla
tesla to sell 5 billion in stock from time to time

the company delivered 499550 vehicles during 2020 which was above wall street estimates of 481261 vehicles according to refinitiv data
when tesla starts paying dividends will this stock become cheaper as far as i can see right now there is no point in owning tsla unless you speculate it so people speculate it this is indeed a bubble and a casino of musk
listen i am making this promise to everyone if tsla doesnt experience the sp effect zzzzzoooooommmmm up 30 by year end i will not post on this board for the whole of january
just use your brains 1 europe likes evs and the competition is moving in and tesla is being pushed aside the model 3 was new in 2019 and sold well sales dropped hard in 2020 2 tesla is a strong ev brand in the usa but americans do not like evs and sales are declining teslas new product  the model y  was a bomb it sold so badly tesla will not reveal sales numbers 3 china is teslas a relative bright spot because the mic model 3 was new in 2020 even still tesla had to cut prices to spur sales
stla is well positioned to excel they already have evs and working on their own battery technology they have a full range of cars from innexpensive to luxury and you cant replace that with poorly made tsla nio or xpev they also have the experience and infrastructure to scale up that doesnt happen over night and tsla know that buy stla on the dip its a quick profit come monday
while i’m by trade most definitely tsla long and i’m sure tesla will enjoy its dominance until at least 2030 i wouldn’t entirely discount appl’s recent icar news once they are ready in 2024 the company will resurface with more might after all they didn’t get here by not being good tsla long tho haha
1100 pe sounds about right
investors are sitting on their hands waiting for the earnings release they will beat and elon may release some exciting news about robo taxis and the tesla truck to mention a few
sorry shorts but all know you loss all your money on tsla and would need this to fall a lot more just to get a small portion of those losses back that’s very sadbut i have some work at my home you can do to make some money shorts 
if tesla is having to build its own factories to make its own batteries to keep up with the demand despite buying from every other battery manufacturer where are their competitors going to get enough batteries from to compete
500k is elon’s like taking it private street bars are beat the  earnings numbers will be later this monthseems to me share price could be slightly down or a lot up on monday

joe is right we need a 50 tax on electricity it’s the only thing that will save the planet banning air conditioning is an idea that’s long overdue
you’d think shorts loosing over 40 billion in 2020 betting against elon musk and tesla would be more contrite though acknowledging its latest quarter and year end numbers are impressive many still speculate on all the he same talking points that could lead to the bev manufacturer’s demise they just won’t let it go
i do not want to go on a huge rant this is my opinion for any new investors that may not be able to take big losses no matter how well this stock is run or future potential if markets turn bad for hundreds of reason like interest rates spike due to money printing or us raises taxes to combat there spending that is out of control or 30 year bond rises unexpected all of these can cause a panick in markets and cause a major correction in all sectors these markets are grossly over valuated and its due to history low interest rates do your home work learn about fundamentals learn charts etc and invest not just on hype because you can be trapped in a stock very fast
i challenge anyone to find a single instance where a stock was diluted but the price went up the same day anyway lock in gain and sell buy back on dip
kevin
what should i do with tesla i have 10 shares around 492 a share should i sell or hold before they enter the sp 500 it’s coming down to the wire but i’m bullish with this stock but nervous at the same time
i am still convinced this stock will go higher in the short term hit a wall a pretty large negative stimulus is going to hit and then it will tank to 200 or less for about 10 years before it finally begins to recover towards this current price point seen it before with other stocks like nvidia etc its coming folks make no mistake
i am up 120 still i don’t know when to sell
i have never seen anything like this in my whole life
volume very low  no fresh buyers for tesla stock today 
for a split second i thought bout selling some shares for profit instead bought more at 598 bringing avg to 186 5 yr plan continues
tesla couldnt sell all the cars they built in 2020 thats why they cut their model y price in china significantly to boost sales not good news

so much demand for its stock tesla sold all 5b worth of stock in one day tesla inc completed the sale of 5 billion of its common stock on wednesday the company said in a filing late thursday the silicon valley car maker announced the equity tap on tuesday and a final settlement is expected to be completed by friday according to the filing tesla shares have rallied 650 this year compared with gains around 15 for the sp 500 index the company is about to ring in 2021 with a war chest estimated to be around 20 billion which the company plans to use to fuel its expansion plans
tesla is not done for the year can go all the way to 750 by tomorrow close what a year
slow rise and stability is what we want to see
i suspect that a door as wide as the grand canyon will be required for exit after sp inclusion it is estimated that inclusion will require 18 billion worth of shares 600 billion divided by 18 billion is only 03 only 3  of the float is needed for inclusion the next two weeks will be very interesting
the tesla gamblers love to compare their pet stock to amazon of course what most of them dont realize is that amazon lost over 90 of its value in the dotcom bubble and took 10 years to recover considering the length and severity of this bubblenot to mention that the economy is in far worse shape than it was back in 2000 it wouldnt surprise me to see tesla lose 99 of its value
investors are buying for the future tesla has years of growth ahead of it it has only just begun to live
wow elon is the richest person in the world  passing bezos woooow

teslas market cap is 4 x bigger than bmw vw and mercedes together but tesla sold only 3 cars compared to the three german carmakers this is 120 times crazy
when a billionaire makes a statement about his position regarding another billionaire’s company it can be prudent to listen if you’d like to fatten your own wallet
correct me if im wrong but if this gets added to the sp 500 tomorrow and at least 80 billion worth of this has to be bought wouldnt that may the stock go up a little no matter what peoples opinions are of the pe ratio etc

bear case is rearing its head notice that the stock is not reaching new heights and is trending sideways if earnings miss by even a hair this will signal a bearish downturn that no bulls can stop the valuation issue will get a spotlight and the big guys might trim their tsla holdings
people cant read 59904 does not equal 600 but if they could do simple math they wouldnt be buying tsla go figure
tesla is not going bankrupt theyre not cooking their books theyre not enron theyre not goldman but what everyone has to agree on is a 700 run in 2020 when people are starving because of the virus doesnt make sense
by reading the comments of longs you can easily understand that we are in the euphoric sentiment phase which will turn in denial soon dip buyers will push the prices back up but soon the reality will set in and most of them are gonna sell not when they want to but when they have to
everyone is out for this stockwant to see it craterbut it just keeps defying gravityjust up and and updestroying all naysayersup dramatically in a horrible market yep the pros as usual know nothing
this is going to pop huge  remember tsla does the exact opposite of what everyone expects it to do 
what do you think for tomorrow

musk knows somethingstay tuned and be careful what you put your money inwhy it matters tesla is betting on cameras and radar in furthering its selfdriving push with musk taking a public stance against the use of lidar sensors noted electrek musk said this week that even if the cost of lidar sensors became zero tesla would not utilize them“i mean totally free well i think even if it was free we wouldn’t put it on” musk told an analyst as per electrekthe new sensor reportedly appears to be a move that would improve the company’s efforts to enable fullself drivingrecently tesla rival nio inc nasdaq nio launched a new electric sedan in china that features highresolution lidar
a very serious question for mr musk the question is at what price target would the board of directors consider a stock split there are obvious reasons where a split would create a huge opportunity for the stock valuation at 1000 a split of 10 for1 would put the stock at 100 the stock would appeal to a greater amount of investors and would keep the momentum at a sustained pace never hurts to ask the seed has been planted

ya know ive been reading a lot of these comments and many people seem to think there will be a lot of people who sell next week to lock in their profits and put off paying taxes on the gain for a yeari see a flaw or two in that logicfirst why would someone sell to lock in a profit when the stock continues to go up and you can put a trailing stop loss in place to protect against any downside losssecondly this is assuming you hold the stock in a taxable account which leads me to this question what type of account do you hold your tesla stock in1 taxable account2 traditional ira3 roth ira4 rollover iraour 500 shares are held in my wifes rollover ira so we will never pay taxes until she take qualified distributionsso im not too convinced about a selloff for tax purposes i see absolutely no reason for anyone to sell right nowjust out of curiousity what type of account do you hold your shares in

seeing it jump yesterday 10 with the afterhours like 70 billion dollars made me realize that this ponzi is very hard to predict and the people involved are orchestrating this a jump at this valuation in a day is like 50 when it was 5 times lower just imagine not even 1 year ago on no news a jump of 50 in a day dont you think theres something odd about this this is a scam both for longs and shorts

the run up for the past two trading days was mainly due to a bunch of analysts saying that deliveries for the 4th q would be higher than 180000and that tesla would handily beat the 500000 delivery mark for 2020 i wonder how the market will react to not hitting the 500000 mark any predictions

why tesla will continue going up and 100 of the ev spacs going public 20202021 will fail one easy answermoney  it takes a massive amount to make a ev company successful just ponderthink about this quote talking about the dyson ev disasterwhile the company reportedly set aside some £25 billion for the electric vehicle project that pales into comparison with the £50 billionplus volkswagen is spending on producing its own electric vehicle – and it has preexisting experience designing and manufacturing cars volkswagen has even recognised that amount isn’t enough partnering with ford to share costs and collaborate on ideas “i think dyson hugely underestimated what it costs” bailey addswhere are all those ev spacs going to get that kind of money to become successful like tesla they wont and will fail tesla and the huge auto makers will only make it even some of the large auto makers imo will fail thus leaving tesla as the market leader the rest of our lifetime the ev spacs of 20202021 will all be destined to fail tesla to 10000
i fully agree with mike brown i dont like the paint job at all munro says thats a bad paint department i would be sacking the guy in charge and during the shutdown i would have had a whole new paint shop put in with that said elon my man shut mike up real fast and offer the most beautiful colors you can it’s amazing how a minimal cost rise can build a huge profit and you can never have enough money ￼￼ ive continued to make adjustments on my business knowing there is always room for improvements￼ customer feedback is very important that is your lifeline and who you must cater too in order to be successful at business also elon you need to focus some more cash on customer relations ￼ i think you have the cash make it happen cheers my man

tesla is not just a car company so comparing it with ford toyota etc is not really comparing apples to apples tesla is not only your traditional auto company the tech that goes into making a self driving car has a lot potential applications else where the other auto companies are years behind tesla tesla is also an artificial intelligence company its an energy company a space company insurance company  another difference with the traditional autos is that they dont have an elon musk 
cramerdeadly combination of events happening today for tesla1institutional buying at record pace2china and europe are selling well3texas4stimulus boosts the market 500points minimum if passed5 short covering must happen today to close all options6only one thing missingmusk announcement of some new equipmentim guessing musk will surprise unveil something today because he just plain old hates shortiesall this is a deadly combination for put holder
popped its lid like a volcano eruption to 750
right about now elon will sell 5b worth of stock like he did sept 1stfree money
the damage from the recall is capped at 400 million we all know that is a drop in the bucket with tslas strong cash position in my opinion its not a big issue investors are smart they know this looking forward to a potential smashing record in earning
at what point does elon announce a new largest ever share offering im thinking elon wants to convert bubble money eg the stock price into real money im thinking he wants to raise at least 100 billion in cash it is very very accretive to the company if he does so the only issue is that he doesnt want to crash the stock he has to nurture the bubble im guessing he will make some kind of an announcement regarding new secondary offerings at the earnings report
still a bargain now before it hits 1000 and morei call that a bargain the best i ever had the best i ever had the who
as i raise my glass of scotch hey is hoping and praying shorts lose another 50 billion this year  betting against the king go tesla
actually virtually any other car manufacturer is more attractive to invest in than tesla at current valuation thank to the tesla hype which seems to be near its end of lifecycle the entrypoints in other stocks are really attractive
teslas plan is to sell 5 million cars by 2030 the funny thing is that given todays market capitalization 5 million cars are still totally overvalued at least 8 times as much so please stop dreaming and start calculating the share is now only driven by news and these are deliberately controlled in addition we have only seen insider sales since a year please start thinking clearly and stop dreaming
this really is a once in a lifetime opportunity
going to be interesting how the election affects the stock market tomorrow

i expect at least 1share in earnings for the 4th quarter analysts have been sandbagging with low estimates tsla is very profitable now and would be even more profitable if it didnt have the cost of the options granted to musk in 2018post your own estimates tsla is very profitable now and would be even more profitable if it didnt have the cost of the options granted to musk in 2018 this would stop growing if the stock price would drop back down below 100share so considering that and all the cash tsla has raised i think tsla is worth that much that would be about 30 times what i project for 2021 earningsnone of this matters really as the stock price is so inflated the real question is what will tsla earn in 2022 and 2023 when the competition gets significanttsla bulls are expecting great things but its curious tsla is not spending very much on rd nor on capital expenditures in general for a company expected to grow 10 times in sales in just a few years tslas rd expenses were just a little under 1 billion for first 9 months of both 2019 and 2020relative to market cap tsla is now spending only about 01 on rd annually yet this is a tech company destined to grow 10 times in a decadegms cruise division 80 owned shows gms net investment in auto drive along about equal to tslas entire rd budget yet tsla has 10 times the enterprise value does this make sense

tesla has delivered 500 k cars in 2020 the unnormal year also tesla has jumped to an almost 700 since the start of the pandemic of 2020 that is really a unique and an amazing phenomenal question here now can anyone imagine how far this stock can go in normal year of 2021 if we say the stock will jump just 400 this year that will lead us to 2800 after split and in worst case scenario to 2000 which is 250 by the end of this year i think only crazy people sell this stock for me that better than buying gold or crypto will hold it forever and sky is the limit of this baby
as i said a few days ago tesla will be 1000 by end of year i just bought 500 more shares today before close to add to my 4200 shares i have been buying for the last 4 years i should be able to retire by january 1st thanks tesla bulls for making my dreams come true

concerns over price drops in china are unwarranted drops in lithium prices  overall battery costs are falling in line with recent price drop in addition 3 million people applied for a new ice car license plate last year and only 70000 were approved starting this year plate applications for ev cars go to the front of the line if you had to wait 3 to 3 12 years to have your new ice vehicle legal to be on the road or you can go out on the roads immediately with your new ev vehicle which would you buy great timing elon to cut prices and still maintain healthy margins
so odd that once tsla is included into the grand sp 500 some news of apple entering the ev market is dug up and put back into the news fud in a new disguise avoid the noise the price will escalate
all tsla has to do is issue more shares this will easily drive the price to 2000
getting quite upset with tsla performance here and im in the trade so i want this to rise but this is the second friday in a row that everyone here has pumped this up stating 9001000 by friday well its friday again and tesla new lows once again not feeling good about earnings or this would be getting some kind of lift
looking at this from a political standpoint a few things have struck me tesla is predominately composed a more liberal investment base id wager that it’s almost entirely or predominately liberal the addition to the sp forces a massive influx of conservative demand not yet accounted for in its share price conservatives indexers are not likely to divest from the index because of tesla’s inclusion the liberal investor is least likely to divest from stock if for nothing else their green political biaswhile there are plenty of investors i would call inclusion buyers that have bought tesla because of the elevated buying of the sp inclusion that plan to sell before an almost certain correction on monday and tuesday it stands to reason that the additional demand of the conservative investor will most assuredly overwhelm the sell off of the the inclusion buyers for the medium to long term bottom line with conservatives being forced to purchase a largely liberal equity that they otherwise would not and liberals showing absolutely no signs of tiring tesla will continue to rise following next weeks sell off
aa batteries from tesla perform better than energizer and duracell can eat away into their market too what is this a 10b market maybe tesla can make consumer house hold electronic batteries for flash lights and so forth take away energizer and duracell customers  that is another huge potential  battery packages hanging on the racks of retail stores that say tesla instead of energizer or duracell  hahaha

well the big day has arrived the close today will be the sp500 inclusion calculation point i see we have set a new marginal high in premarket in the low 670s  above the 666 on premarket on dec 9 the option expiration  which is a quarterly and decent amount of open interest would normally be a substantial factor in todays shareprice towards expiration  but today is a special day with the inclusion outweighing all other factors  so it should be a very interesting day remember todays close is a one time event ivs on the options are very high as my friends the option market makers will make anyone who wants to play  pay up after todays event at the close is over  it is a whole new ball game and i reiterate that the jan 15 2021 option expiration is setting up for a very very different story than todayshave fun

its time yesterday it couldnt go below 645 so theres no downside trend most likely today will be a big breakout when it can break 690 then its straight a way to 700
i may not have a tesla car but i do have tesla stocksgreat ending to 2020long and strong

what tesla really needs to do to strengthen its technology leadership in semiconductor industry and the entire tech sector is to buy this fastgrowing semiconductor company that has products with high demand made by cuttingedge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level making it a steal and great fit for tesla and a great contribution to the us even if tesla just got 25 ownership of the company it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and topnotch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this companys major moves in the future it would be similar to american companies and institutions ownership in asml one of the most important semiconductor company in the worldrumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global hightech gem this small super tech may double in price in a swift it already has since we started covering it one year ago closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon read our last analysis and you’ll seehttpsseekingalphacominstablog40777835gathoncapital5529995unitedstateislosinggoldenopportunitytobemajorshareholderofworldsbesttechcompanyhttpsseekingalphacominstablog40777835gathoncapital5519600biginvestorsswarmnvidiageofchinaafterastonishingprofitgrowthinq2andq3httpsseekingalphacominstablog40777835gathoncapital5495008gequalcommtiappleshouldacquiregeofchinafordirtcheappricenowhttpsseekingalphacominstablog40777835gathoncapital5490372geofchinaenjoyedstrongprofitandgrowthamidcoronavirusoutbreak

europe  november sales numbers are in they are not pretty tesla sales are down 14 and they also lost more than 50 of their market share their share fell from 15 to 6 and all this happened despite prices cuts
tesla had a 5 for 1 split several months ago now it’s selling at 840 and 1 analyst has a 950 target do you realize that means the stock is selling pre split at 4400 a share tesla pays no dividend so who would pay 4400 for a share of stock that has a pe of over 1000 all the tesla fans have made mr musk the richest man in the world when reality finally sets in ask yourself are you really willing to pay 850 or 4400 pre split per share of stock with your hard earned money less than 6 months ago analysts thought 1000 was high before the split too much competition to think tesla has a lock on the auto industry going forward the other guys are not going to lay down and not compete in the ev sector there is going to be competition so is 840 440 or 100 realistic time will tell
why is everyone on the tsla board talking about nio just shows how much better nio is nio to the moon
vaccine from moderna approved stimulus getting approved from congressand shorts think tesla and the market is going down 
gotta love computerized trading the market is simply computer codes against computer codes and if valuation doesnt factor into the code welltrading in tesla is what you witness40 to 900maybe back to 40 or 4000
i remember talking about whether tsla was going to break 800  back in june it has gone up 5 x since then so i have 5 times more shares of tsla since then
i think tesla will keep going to 1k this month
expect it to close at 600 before market closes and that is still overpriced by 100 also i expect mutual fund managers to book some gains before the end of year so the selling in the last 10 days is normal and i dont think tesla will have any news until midjan except for the december unit volumes in first week of january better to stay away from this stock unless you are buying puts or selling short

the value of tesla has no bearing on the simple fact that they cannot even sell 500k cars per year yet nothing is wrong  right

guysbofa analyst john murphy raised the firms price target on tesla to 900 from 500 and keeps a neutral rating on the shares the stock is driven by growth afforded by valuation said murphy who has tried to estimate what the current stock price affords to tesla in terms of incremental plants and units and what those incremental units translate into in incremental revenue and profits building automotive industry capacity is expensive and often generates low returns but the higher the upward spiral of teslas stock goes the cheaper capital becomes to fund growth which is then rewarded by investors with a higher stock price argues murphy
yes still up 800 tomorrow

i live in the mountainous north east and have never even seen a tesla in person i was wondering something do the teslas have heating and if so does the heat take energy from the batteries if a tesla were just sitting outside in 20 f can you start them to let the vehicle warm up mostly just trying to determine if electric vehicles will be able to be efficient in mountains running heat when it comes to fuel mileage
is to late to buy tesla or i need to wiat for couple of days any suggestions plzzz

thank you shorts for providing the rocket fuel
predicting questions in march “today’s share price is 80 should i get in now or is it too late” answer no it’s not but wouldn’t you rather have gotten in at 58 or lower we’ve seen these questions weekly since 2s look at the 1 year trend and consider where nio may be 12 months from now too many positivestrategic things happening to keep sp below 100 for long the fastest growth in 202120222023 will belong to nio not tsla when shorts suggest the sky is falling daily ignore them or tell them to look at the charts as they speak for themselves nio is just getting started folks

i exoext a big crash on monday in tesla stocks accelerating by selling more and more to save their profits
the strangest thing just happened that should not have happened but happened anyway right at the close the exact minute 2 second after i had a gtc order to sell 37 shares at 695 and it should not have filled but 35 of the 37 shares did fill anyway so basically i caught an instantaneous tail one of those flash prices that only last for a millisecond i am long gamma and i can do small scalps to get back to delta neutral so i can put the trades on in advance very very strange but is probably worth about 1225 free money i guess but with tesla it is easy come and easy go you cant really count a profit until your position is neutral
normal tesla trading around earnings earnings beat stock drop after beatinghold and buy the up coking dip
why is there warning next week when they already announced the q4 delivery this monday
this stock will topple faster than cheney silverstein al qadi and george hw toppling the world trade center
watch this dip get bought up like clock work robot machines
teslas growth is not based on the true value of tesla it is based on the investors belief and faith that buying tesla shares will earn
who thinks it will hit 700 next week
recommendation wait and buy later after a couple of months until we know the true stock value everyone knows it rose top high too quick with all the uncertainty thats around the evmarket
tesla is working on 24 new features for the future cars this stock will only rise until a car can beat its technology they are hiring the best engineers and innovators around the world they pay them well and believe me when i say they are all go getters tesla will shine for at least another 3 years according to my predictions this will double and double again in the next 3 to 5 years
from empire research whitney tilson and i couldnt paste the charts hereafter its extraordinary run over the past year electriccar maker tesla tsla closed yesterday with a market cap of 538 billion – making it the sixthmost valuable company in the us – trailing only tech giants apple aapl microsoft msft amazon amzn alphabet googl and facebook fbfor any company to warrant such a high valuation it must be extremely profitable or extremely rapidly growing – ideally bothtesla certainly fails the first test as it’s barely profitable – and not from making cars but rather selling zeroemission vehicle and other regulatory creditsbut at least it’s growing super fast rightwell as with seemingly everything about tesla bulls and bears disagree…the bulls argue that even with its main factory in fremont california closed for two months and its new giga shanghai one shuttered for a month tesla is on track to sell a half a million cars this year up 36 from 2019 plus the company is likely to sell 867000 cars in 2021 up another 73 estimates from troyteslike – his full spreadsheet is hereon the other hand tesla bears argue that this growth is driven by launching new models and opening new factories which is masking the reality that sales of tesla’s “mature” products – the model s x and 3 – are declining in its most mature markets the us and europelet’s look at the data for the model 3 which accounted for 73 of the cars that tesla sold in the first three quarters of this year this table provided to me by a friend – here’s his source shows unit sales broken down by region from january 2019 through october of this year the latest period available note that us data are hard to get so those numbers are lumped in with the rest of world “row” at first glance the numbers look decent tesla sold 19 more model 3s in the first 10 months of this year relative to the same period last year then add in rapidly growing sales for the new model y and the growth story gets even more exciting rightbut when you break down sales by the three regions you can see that model 3 sales are actually declining in the more mature markets usrow and europe and this is being masked by china sales as the new giga shanghai factory ramps uplet’s first look at the usrow the us accounts for roughly 80 of this as you can see total sales are down in eight of the 10 months this year for a total of negative 16in europe it’s almost as bad sales are down in seven out of the nine months for a total of negative 14the only growth area is china which isn’t surprising given that tesla was starting from zero it will be a challenge for tesla to maintain growth in china when it has competition from literally hundreds of local companies especially nioin conclusion tesla has become one of the most valuable companies in the world due almost entirely to its growth story – and indeed at first glance its growth has been impressivehowever the most impressive kind of growth comes not only from new products in new markets but also from steadily increasing “samestore sales” to use a metric common among retailerscostco wholesale cost is a great example though it’s been around for more than 37 years in the past five years the bulk retailer has grown revenue at a healthy 79 annually in two ways growing store count by 32 annually while at the same time increasing samestore sales by an average of 6 each year investors wouldn’t value costco’s stock nearly as highly if sales at its mature stores were stagnant or worse yet decliningyet that appears to be the case with tesla sales of tesla’s primary car the model 3 are actually in doubledigit decline everywhere in the world except for chinai am not advocating shorting the stock – i’ve seen too many of my friends get run over – but those who’ve had a wonderful ride on this rocket ship might want to bank some profits especially if it’s in a taxfree account…

richardif i were musk i might be inclined to build 5 gigafactories rather than 1 if the market wants to give you free money why wouldnt you take itin the end i dont believe tesla cars will be that much superior to any other ev maker and a lot of other ev makers are coming with that said what musk can do is just beat them all to the punch he can just be there far sooner than they get there for that to happen he has to spend and spend big vw has committed 90 billion to ev thats nine zero billionthey are coming do you get that musk will not have this business to himself but what musk does have is far cheaper capital than anyone else

no reason for tsla to be down 70the only reason is a technical one as it was covering its gap up from last weekbutit gapped down from 880 and it will cover that gap as wellgo tsla
so according to maxpain total open interest for this friday is 32 millions contracts that equates to 320000000 shares to either exchange hands or expire on friday the max pain is 440 with 3x as many puts as calls what does this all mean i have no idea but i think it means that lots of contracts are in the money and those contracts will be exercised this week the recent run up is likely due to the purchasing of shares to cover these contracts while the massive bets against the stock likely mean we are in for a wild week any option experts out there have any idea what these crazy numbers mean for real
not much upside and 8090 chance that top hit at 880 ibd advised that 67 indicators showed that tesla is reaching a climax run after a climax run comes a big pullbackpe ratio all time highps ratio all time highrsi off by one point from 2013 all time hightesla expected to make 31b in revenue but has a 800b market cap if anyone can find any other stock that has ever done this in the history of stocks tech auto whatever please give me the name apple disrupted the cell phone market when they developed the first touch screen iphone 35b in revenue at the time  175b market cap amazon disrupting brick and mortar business amongst all other thingshad a 3600 pe at one point but were making 5560b in revenue and had a 150b market cap google i’m sure you’ve heard of them highest pe they ever had was around mid 50s netflix disrupting streaming business traded at a about 450 pe at their highest while making close to 4b in revenue and had a 45b market cap highest ps ratio of about 12 so just compare tesla to any other major tech company and you’ll see the insane overvaluation here even though as it stands tesla makes most of their money from selling cars up close to 900 since march people need to get a close look and see that numbers like that can only be compared to com bubble welcome to the ev bubble you have companies like nkla with no revenue valued close to 10b there’s a new ev company every other day and competition is everywhere tesla could sit at this price for the next 35 or more years and still be grossly overvaluedreality is tesla is expected to make 31b this year 45b next year and 65b in 2023 with this growth fair value they should be around 300400b market cap and that’s still being very generous don’t worry there was plenty of blind fomo buyers in the com bubble as well they would speak the same language as the pumpers here keep in mind that it took investors 1015 years to make their money back and that’s if they invested in amazon looks like history will repeat itself this coming earnings report should do the job y’all better hope they smash expectations by at least 100 since they barely met 2020 delivery expectations i expect a modest beat at best then let the massive selling begin sell the newsleaving off with this on 123 musk stated to his employees that tesla needs “to cut costs or the firms stock price could be “crushed like a soufflé under a sledgehammer”  that was around 550 sp well we’re now 55 higher and i am sure tesla didn’t magically make any drastic changes to their cost cutting within a month should be a big warning sign 
the government hopes the policy will energise the market for electric cars in the uk and help the country achieve its climate targets including reducing emissions of greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050 the organisation has previously called for the government to commit to significant longterm incentives for electric vehicle purchase and to set fixed targets on charging infrastructure arguing that higher prices and concerns about charging are keeping sales downthe government is expected to provide around £500m funding for charging infrastructure from next year according to the newspaper’s report

having now watched nios presentation i have to say that im really impressedeverything seems very well thought and they are really on the edge of ad the big range of 1000km replaceable battery will be able to make this a game changer this can have teslas valuation in a few years but with 10 millions of vehicles soldbuilding the replacing stations will make charging much quicker and they dont need so many as the replacing of the battery will take max 5 minutes they can recharge all the batteries in the station overnight and have them ready the next day every car manufacturer will have a replaceable batteryi never thought i might consider investing in a car company but this looks even given its extremely high value something very interesting its interesting to know how much ip they have in form of patents i havent researched that yet they topped the camera by a factor of 7 compared to the current teslasuse flexible lidar to enhance the tracking of only certain objects have redundancy with the multiple viewing angles they equip all cars with the same hardware and you can book ad on a monthly basis which is great if you dont want it or if you travel abroad for a year its really a milestone in car manufacturing the way i see it

took a ride in a friends tesla hes part of the fsd beta while it generally does well it really choked in two instances one was road construction with cones directing you into the oncoming lane and the flow of traffic was being directed by a police officer we could see his signaling but it was confusing even to us i dont see how fsd ever gets to understanding this  which makes me think the robotaxi business is a nonstarter the second situation where it got confused and required my friend to take over was on a highway where they had redirected the lanes 12 lane over to make room at roadside for what looked like sewer work behind a barrier the lane shift had new lines and somewhat stripped  scrapped old lines fsd couldnt understand what was going oni went into this with an open mind and while system is impressive in 95 of road scenarios it utterly fails in the last 5 and this comports with what ive read  the last few percent of autonomous diving is 95 of the workso in conclusion i think you can cancel your robotaxi dreams

detroit ap — tesla inc is balking at recalling about 159000 vehicles with potentially defective touch screens so us safety regulators are moving to force the company to take actionthe national highway traffic safety administration on wednesday sent a letter to tesla saying it has tentatively determined that the screens are defective and pose a safety risk because they can cause backup cameras to go dark and defrosters to malfunctionthe agency wouldnt comment beyond the letter which is a rare step toward a public hearing and eventual legal action experts say the letter means that tesla has resisted doing a recall that nhtsa feels is necessary“its obvious to me that tesla told nhtsa to go pound sand so what theyre about to get theyve earned it” said frank borris a former head of the agencys office of defects investigation who now runs a safety consulting businessmessages were left wednesday seeking comment from tesla which is based in palo alto californialast june the agency opened an investigation into complaints that the giant touch screens would go dark in certain 2012 through 2018 model s cars and 2016 through 2018 model x tesla vehicles it upgraded the probe to an engineering analysis in novemberthe letter says the agency has determined that the screens are defective because their computer processors have a finite number of programanderase cycles nhtsa says the screens would fail in five to six years which isnt sufficient for safetycritical features“the lack of a functioning windshield defogging and defrosting system may decrease the drivers visibility in inclement weather increasing the risk of a crash” the letter saidin data submitted by tesla the agency found more than 12000 customer complaints field reports warranty claims and other claims related to the screens the letter saidnhtsa also determined that the failure rate for the screens is higher than the rate for vehicles involved in prior recalls for similar problemstesla tried to fix the problem with several overtheair software updates but nhtsa said it tentatively believes the fixes are insufficient“i think its planned obsolescence which requires physical replacement of a part which tesla tried to gloss over by sending a software update” said jason levine executive director of the nonprofit center for auto safetythe screen failures also can cause the loss of audible chimes and alerts that are part of tesla’s “autopilot” driverassist systemthe letter says that if tesla formally decides not to do a recall it has to provide nhtsa with an explanation the agency can schedule a public meeting on matter and could turn it over to the justice department for legal action borris saidborris who reviewed the letter called it very thorough and said nhtsa has a strong case should tesla decide to challenge the agency in court

its very interesting how all these analysts have been saying all year long that tsla is gonna crash to very low prices every time they say it it goes down just a little bit for a few days but then tsla recovers right away and ends up going higher to new record highs this same cycle has been repeating itself over and over again all year long so im not worried at all because the same thing is happening now again after a few days of selling tsla will recover again and then it will break 700 on monday when it gets included in the sp 500 index or shortly thereafter and then the next milestone it will reach is 800 staying long and strong

on the phone with my broker this morning he stated a downside to 700 level in the coming weeks way over valued i buckled and sold hopefully buy back in at this said mark uncertainty with market and upcoming administration ive made so much but im willing to protect it i love elon and his visions not only in vehicles but space solar and possible ai news blip out today from one of tesla shorts that has called the down side and to be ready to short i dont know how to short and dont care to but hes been on target in the past rough road ahead for a while watch the gold prices for an indication of a market correction glta sad to be out but being protective of my tesla fortune
my new price target based on the collective wisdom of analysts is 420000 per shareonly values company at about 750 million per car sold instead of measly 15 millionpe should be at least 750000 not 1500
tesla employee leaked details in the code
i have been looking at ecommerce stocks in my value line reports mostly companies like workday which provide software services in the cloud most of them have never made a profit and the stocks have been soaring is this what the tsla fans think tsla is about the beauty of the software as a service in the cloud model is that most of the costs developing the software is fixed regardless of the number of customers client acquisition is also a big expense but there there are large economies of scale and the dominant player is at a great advantage gross margins and operating margins are hugebut despite all the protests that tsla isnt just a car company the fact is that nearly all its revenues comes from selling cars or ev credits and it is really just a car company growth will not greatly improve margins you are not going to find buyers of a 25000 car paying 10000 for a self driving software package nor are the mass of buyers going to appreciate a 100 software update charge being added to the monthly cost of their lease payment

best case tesla stock price is risk to tesla as company for following reason1 elon already very worried about going other way in even faster speed pushing employee on every front this will drive gray line activity and fraud at out of control way it already have that and may be market manipulator betting on that2 end of month there are stories how tesla pushed lemon car to customer this is easily end disaster tesla most love car can become most hated with such customer service fiasco there are enough alternative and hotest new car lucid coming to market as well3 all those big boy club working to gather and sec is sleeping now with democratic control and there are some non corrupt socialist out there who hate rich people this again huge risk because if sec wake up and crack down all this algo trading this can end worst possible way4 tesla employee who making millions from options at best get distracted and worst leave for own ventures so can drive slower development5 premature not tested stuff will in end up car which is huge riskover all this isnt helping elon going to 20m except ability to keep raising capital they already raised 10s b which enough for next 45 factory

with panasonic agreeing to build teslas 4680 cells we may well see a million tesla cars built in 2021 consider this tesla was already building these cells in fremont yet elon seemed frustrated that they couldnt scale it fast enough now panasonic comes in and says bro we got this you wont have to go it alone with the new battery i have a feeling panasonic knows a secret that they are not sharing with elon on mass producing the 4680 cell after all panasonic is a mass battery expert so panasonic will have elon and tesla on the hook for awhile

nio just announced in china that even though the chinese govt is reducing ev subsidies by 20 in 2021which buy the way does not help tsla it will match the 2020 subsidy through jan 10th by giving extra incentivesthe competitive landscape heats up and will eat at tsla profits like every other car company in the world that operates on single digit margins2021 will be a very rocky year for tsla especially at the current valuation
robinhooder trying to process what is happening to tsla

all the shorts and sour grape eaters are whining tesla stock price being too high i disagree at least by one measure it is not expensive price  sales ratio right now tesla ‘s ps is at 25 vs snow’s 300 pltr’s 40 plug’ s 34 if tesla trades at plug’s ps it should be 1200 so stop whining and buy the stock first thing monday morningin fact given the prospect of blow out 4th qtr earnings report entire 1st qtr capacity for model y shanghai being already sold out and the the potential fsd sales software sales the snow category  tesla should trades at the 300 ps which should be around 10000 but let’s be conservative and call 2000 for tesla by end of 2021 and do a second split

tesla solar and powebank adoption has been rapidly increasing i believe tesla is more than just a car company but an energy and technology company soon their ai by itself will be a product just not on cars theres a lot of room for his next innovative reinvention

i’ve got to say from what i’m reading about brightdrop from gm is very impressive and the fact that they are bringing it to market this year is even more impressive tsla who
model y achieves 5star overall safety rating from nhtsa
tsla is at the iron grip of goldman this stock didnt move upto 1400 pe with any logic or reasonings or any fundamental strength now expecting this stock to crash or trade down on its failure to meet the target is highly illogical it is not going to happen it is cult many retail investors have tesla stock trading statement in their prayer cabinets they will only sell if they find that the tesla stock dropped more than 50 from their purchasing price my hunch is that it may not drop tomorrow much but they will decide to take it down gradually
longest bull market ending return of da  bear

everyone is entering the ev market so to see tsla with a market cap above 800 bn is totally out of reality ev prices will come down significantly and tsla will never be able to earn the money to justify the actual market cap this ponzi car will fall down to earth

tesla stock at all time high short interest is low and there is no catalyst distance to drop at least 20 percent
if all you small fry tesla shorters were smart and thats a big if you would be looking at the example of hedge fund managers like david einhorn who have been shorting tesla stock einhorn was so successful at shorting tesla that his net worth have plunged from 18 billion two years ago to only 700 million today the dude have literally lost over a billion dollars from shorting tesla
to long term investors of tsla i understand its disturbing to have the stock going down the last couple of days if you have been a long term investment of tsla we know how volatile it can be but at the end of the day by holding it through the up and down we have thrived with the stock price where it is today this is like a minor storm comparing the tsunami we have been through to get here it is unrealistic to think that tsla as a stock goes up and never goes down have the strength to survive this will give us the long term rewardtsla has a very ambitious goal of making 20 million evs in 10 years full fsd coming and the full suite of businesses on top of fsd it will be an incredible journey

this stock will start coming down if the sec bans short selling on this stock not that they are allowed to do one single tweet from musk where he said he had an offer to go private to 420 when the stock was at 280 which had created a short squeeze and saved the company from bankcrupcy i would say musk is an evil genius who took a calculated risk by tweeting fake news that caught shorts off guard and the squeeze is automated since then the only way to break this automation is to stop shorting
way back when amazon was under 100 everyone screamed overvalued not making money selling books they will never de thrown barnes  noble i panicked and sold at 450 happy with my 350 profit biggest mistake of my investing career i learned from that which is why tesla has made me into a multimillionaire it wasn’t hard to own tesla way back when at 38 100 and 180 a share 1000 shares was easily a part of any well seasoned portfolio and today with 5 times the amount and 1000 rise in price well this has made up for all of amazon

theres nio and tsla comparison going on this board primarily bullish on nioi have not taken a serious look at nio i have studied tsla quite well  its strengths and blemishes for every legit stock originating from china there are 15 bogus fake fraud stocks all sound great during ipo and during runup then the massive dump and eventual delist too many to mention ill say baba is one example of a legit stock that will still be around in 2030 i cant tell you how many stocks originating from china have gone under suddenly china is very non transparent the first thing a public company needs to do is  be transparent good luck to all those who are piling on nio history tells me a few will make bucks during the runup and fomo will cause millions of americans holding the bag lets see where nio is 3 years from now make that 2 tsla on the other hand has one serious problem it is the lone warrior with illwishers and behemoth auto companies wishing for its demise today tsla is the best technology company on earth tsla shareholder has not invested in just a car even better than apple  google elon musk is a simple leader that makes him charismatic to private investors with deep pockets he has standby and private funding sources if not  big auto would have already taken him down teslas battery day presentation has shaken the battery industry they got enough clues to go back to the drawing board and rethink ultra light and high capacity batteries they will play catchup because tslas rd still is nimble hence faster

how do people feel about teslas prospects in china over the next few years is competition from nio xpeng and others really going to materialise or is tesla simply too far ahead of the curve chinas electric vehicle market is seen booming this year with teslas model y forecast to shake up the market thanks to aggressive pricing that undercuts german rivals julian satterthwaite reports short link httpsrefinitv3ngqduk
none of this makes sense

im new to selling options on tesla how has the dec 18 and 24 out of the money calls on tesla increased instead of decreased despite the lost time value and flat stock price since monday afternoon today for example the calls are flat even though tesla is down 2 yesterday tesla was barely up but the out of money calls were way up on the day volatlity increase im guessing is outweighing the time value loss but beta was already extremely high before i sold the options
people used to postulate tsla would eclipse aapl now that’s taken as a given the real question is how much over 10t will the market cap get and when if you don’t think so then you don’t understand the enormous change that’s happening

to the tsla millionaires  congratulations but remember that it is not a gain until you sell it dont be the last one holding
it’s interesting to note that em has stated in no uncertain terms that tsla has just 1 profitvehicle  this dismal profitability is very different from the 15 profitvehicle so frequently claimed by multitudes of tsla sycophantsthe chickens are soon coming home to roost as the truth about profits is absorbed by the investment communityadditionally em drew attention to the fact that energy grids will soon be overwhelmed as we approach tsla’s lofty and unrealistic market share goals

tesla is the most popular asset among young investors in europe and as a result tesla has taken a solid advance on strong growth the stock market price has increased eightfold during the wonder year 2020 thanks in part to the enthusiasm of a new generation of young investors robinhoods just before christmas tesla tore into wall streets most influential barometer  the s  p500  sparking an additional buying wave tesla does not earn from the sale of electric cars but from the sale of emission rights the stock market value stands at a record  669 billion in comparison that is almost twice as much as the three classic car manufacturers toyota volkswagen and general motors combined those three each produce about 10 million vehicles annually the tesla share is very expensive compared to the classic car manufacturers i would like to know what the race will do on monday the stock market is not open today unfortunately

nio no factory no problemi think you should do research on and come to your own conclusion i own baba and xpeng because i am bullish on the chinese economy but i see tesla more like i do byd and xpeng more like byd while nio is like a upgraded tesla this is only in their respective marketsso why not xpeng motors i think its a good bet long term i think xpev nio tsla and a few other chinese evs are better bets than things like workhorsenikola shll etcits also cheaper to build factories in china than it is in the us also the chinese government would be incentivized to assist nio in building a factory because they would benefit as wellhaving your own factory means little to me the tesla gigafactory costs around 2 billion the problem here is that people think that this is such a big deal its not what people dont understand is that you can own your own factory but without demand its worthless so does nio need a factory now sort of they have been selling since 2018 and have sold 75000 vehicles tesla has sold 500000 vehicles in 12 years so the demand for nio is and will continue to increase because quality of a product speaks volumes clearlyhave you ever considerd that china spends money on things like ghost cities to increase gdp because they have a surplus of wealth the way they disperse wealth is different than in the us to the lowerpoverty class very different china spends billions on infrastructre and will capatalize on the large debt the us owes themso nio can raise 26 billion in share dilution and be able to build their own factory this actually might happen in places like eu but why do it it when you have jac motors in china why does jac gets such a bad reputation they pump out other vehicles of quality like volkswagen so convince me what exactly about the quality is bad its clearly beating tesla and the consumers love the vehiclesa factory will come in time but it isnt needed yet thats what people dont get when we see monthly deliveries of 10000 a month on average i could see this happening and when sedans do come on the market from nio they will i bet my left nut they willin terms of service nio offers more than xpeng and tesla that is why consumers who sit down and compare the 2 or 3 companies go for tesla the 2nd biggest investment a vehicle in terms of service in china and quality along with re sale values winner is a nio as battery technology increases and denser smaller batteries can be made nio will most likely build adapters for these smaller more powerful batteries to fit in the ec6es8es6 while being able to accomodate the newer vehicles moving forwardrobo taxi you have an entire road infrastructre with easily moveable nio battery swap stations that takes 1 day to move to accomodate your autonomos self driving robo taxi enough said here you also have nomi a crucial part in taking transactions and being able to identify passengersnio no factory no problemsxpeng doesnt do any of these things i could go on and on but you need to do your own research i still believe these are all good bets so dont worry

yesss green again
as ford gm bmw and other auto manufacturers ramp up evs they will not have to buy the zev credits from tesla therefore almost a billion per year will disappear for tesla on top of that there are no tax credits for any of teslas vehicles anymore because of the numbers sold tesla hasnt earned a dime yet they have billions in losses and would be totally unprofitable if it wasnt for the zev they dont compete they are subsidizedhowever the stock is just an idea like btc shorting this is a fools errand at this point
here is my take and bash all you want im excited for this earnings call it may not have a huge run however i feel it should be significant the stock has been stagnant with no big drops and no big gains the setting is nice for a positive earnings call this is going to be a good week

assuming apple could grab 5 market share of the electric vehicle market with a 75000 icar in 2025 that sports a 7 operating margin the tech giant would only see a 3 bump in earnings if apple sells its electric car for 100000 snags 5 of the ev market and drives a 10 operating margin hall estimates the bump to apple’s earnings would be 5not too impressive for apple given its much higher margin structure currently driven by making less capital intensive iphones ipads and macs using outside suppliers but the somewhat subdued earnings accretion from an icar as wall street analysts call it reflects the costly nature of making an electric car or a car of any kind — see low single digit percentage operating margins at ford f and general motors gm

tesla will be as big if not bigger than amazon amazon doesnt have an actual hardware product most of its revenue is derived from software services cloud ecommerce etc amazon does not build things from the ground up alexa and kindle are junk they are really good at selling someone elses product through clever marketing gimmicks like prime amazon grew big thanks to cloud but now that microsoft and google are on the scene cloud revenue is likely saturated bezos will have to find a new venture tesla is much closer to apple building products from the ground up integrating hardware and software to provide phenomenal performance maximizing shareholder return through vertical integration if youre an investor here you can easily get the amazon gains youll likely get the apple gains as well
fairly obvious to me that ev will be a commodity even more so than ice vehiclespoint is that its going to be very hard to build a moat around yourself and so the valuations on all things ev are bound to come down down downin the mean time there is money to be made trading the emotion merry xmas

the stock split has helped tesla bring the price down to a level where younger investors can jump in myself included strong companies with smart leaders understand this to those who dont your loss
what is the incentive for posting “sell now” advise here it is obvious these posters have shorts or puts position and trying to create selling pressureinvestment is like nurturing tree you have to be patient and wait for its fruit don’t sell if you are a investor you may sell if you are a traderselling on 8 drop causes you to lose another 2030 of your investment leverage because of tax you will be waiting for another 2030 drop before you can buy and to take same position with stocks like tsla you will easily miss boat by 10 on upswing trying to time marketnet result of panic selling is no profit simple tax donation and extra headache

tesla shares will become more hard to come by why the index and quasi index funds bought 100150 million and they are virtually gone from the market as these funds will be holding them there are tons of other funds who have buy and hold strategies in place also many retail investors like myself are not going to give up my shares finally all the pension and retirement funds will constantly be buying more tesla and holding on to them with every paycheck  money will go into the 401k and to index funds that have to buy more tesla to me  that just means stability and steady price appreciation
i find it funny for the past 5 months that people have been saying the stock is over valued it has only gone up
when ppl talk about tesla normally think it is auto company actually the energy sector is much much bigger than auto sector tesla will be big star in this sector too we will see how fast their energy sector revenue increase in the coming earning report

all tesla potencial competitors are 23 or more years behind in the meantime tesla will continue to develop and optimize the production process and new features and capabilities on his vehicles therefore it is reasonable to assume that this advantage will be maintained in the following years tesla will capture more market share not through price war but product technology substitution this strategy is so robust that it is not crazy to think that tesla will be a big player in the automobile industry in sales and profits

congratulations to musk for achieving the historical milestone  job well done 
tesla faking numbers  total fourthquarter vehicle registrations in the 23 states where data was collected stood at 44749 with model y accounting for nearly half the registrations so only 45k cars for the 23 states wheres the other 140k cars coming from  certainly not china felon lying again  i am very suspicious of teslas numbers which always just make the estimate in any case musks lies will be exposed rump is gone now only musk is left 2 great cons of the past 4 years

850 call tomorrow down almost 2k i lost 4k last week with telsa 
we will get a tiny down move today but it wont be nearly enough it might move down 10 or 20 this stock would be overpriced at 400 the issue is that theres too much magical thinking right now theres a lot of competition and the market is treating tesla as if has none this magical thinking will eventually ebb away but it may take quite some time it could take a year for this thing to correct like it should
are you guys seeing all the action in ford today and this after the tear gm has been in for the past week i think everyone just realized there are other automakers besides tesla maybe someone at a hedge fund picked up a consumer reports or someone at an investment bank left a car and driver in the bathroom

tsla at 700 3500 pre split and btc at 30000 is something strange going on here or is it just me is there an infinite demand for tsla stock with no end in sight or will the markets take a breather and wait for some show me the money milestones 510520k eoy deliveries will likely buoy sp a bit sell on the news would make sense except that earnings are around the corner and could be gangbusters with added revenue and china margin improvements will tsla see 800 or even 900 after that makes little sense to hit those levels at this stage but who would count it out given tesla fever taking over

how many people know tesla is providing insurance in california 20 percent lower rate up to 30 its just a car company thats also approved as energy utility provider in the uk and also working on it in germany solar and power banks for homes software for full self driving most parts on a tesla are made in house meaning tesla is also manufacturing on a higher scale then the typical automaker one giga factory alone makes so much power 100 would power the world this company will be worth 10 trillion in 2030

fighting teslas rise is like fighting the fed it doesnt matter if they need to sell a car to each member of an amazon tribe in order to meet the current goals all that matters is the stock is being bought you short this one you lose every time
if you dont own tesla shares and still post here its safe to say you earn a minimum wage salary that requires you post here yet im a millionaire
the tsla long speculation and valuation are flawed ev consumers worldwide want personalized design from a variety of automakers this isn’t like the smartphone business otherwise everyone would have rushed to buy a toyota prius when they debuted 20yrs ago that didn’t happen
today is a good day nothing to do with the stock market but purley on basis i feel confident we have a resposibal adult in charge
compare aapls super high pe to tsla it would make tsla valued at 2125 over 40 times the speculative value compared to appl tsla is a great company but way overpriced at 880 protect your gains and capital for the first time i just shorted tsla at minimum 600s is on the near horizon

the fact that elon approached apple to acquire tesla and apple refused to even consider says a lot about apples vision in my opinion apple is getting itself in trouble by entering the ev industry so late i guess they have a ton of cash and looking for ways to flush it
buy with both hands hwre we going to 800 full self drive and cyber truck coming out this year and 20 bullion on balance sheet and being added to s and pand elon put out this email talking abkut ramping up model 3 and y production i predict huge 4th quarter stay lingwe are fortunate to have the high class problem of demand being quite a bit higher than production this quarterto ensure that we have the best possible customer outcome and earn the trust of the customers and investors who have placed their faith and hardearned money with us we need to increase production for the remainder of the quarter as much as possible

lots of nio shareholders come to li and xpev trying to convince people to sell li and xpev and buy nio as if the entire market use yahoo commenting systembut lets get past the hype that seems to blow nio shareholders minds nio in the presentation said that theyll use nvidias chip and another companys battery to make their cars even better than teslas cars they avoided saying who created the battery but the battery company is qing tao and was confirmed at qing tao at first glance it sounds great but adopting nvidias chip and another manufacturers battery means that nio didnt produce any of these tech inhouse and have no way to prevent every ev company out there from also adopting nvidias chip and qing taos batteryanother concern is qing tao up to this point has not been able to declare that their battery works on vehicle yet one analyst quote chinese startup qing tao energy development says it’s created the first solidstate battery production line in china with one big caveat its batteries don’t work with electric vehicles yetanother analyst quoted right now they are using the batteries for “special equipment and highend digital products” but nan says that they are talking to “a number of large automobile manufacturers” about using their solidstate batteries in electric vehiclesone analyst went on to comment about the presentation in this statement nio’s ceo william li didn’t choose his words carefully he didn’t say nio is making but rather nio adopts this definitely indicates that nio is simply buying the battery from a supplier likely catl rather than making their own if this is true then the timeline of q4 2022 for delivery of the first solid state battery in a car will be heavily exposed to delays by the 3rd partythis presentation from nio day is a great bullish news for nvidia not so much for nio as for other company qing tao well they might never be able to release their product at all 2 years from now remember qs said that they had a breakthrough and they cant release their product until 2024 at the earliest its not easy and i would pick quantumscape over qing tao any dayi understand nio shareholders want to think nio is the next tsla but lets be clear nio is no tsla not even close tlsa would create its own chip and its own battery thats how it prevents other ev companies from also using them
ok watch out im going to buy a share for the first time this is your warning to get out it will tank immediately after my transaction

the unit sales expectation for tsla in 2021 is 860000 will be smashed because texas giga factory will be done in spring together with berlin i believe these two new factory will pump up at least 300000 units this year so i believe the number should be more one million units

im bullish long term but tesla is going to tank so hard this week150 above 200 day moving average it was showing signs of stalling out at 860 it went red in premarket sentiment is bearish insane valuations 11 days of bullishness 3 gap ups be prepared for a drop its due for a correction
seems logical  james emanuelcomments155   followthe interesting thing is that the spike this year has been on the back of hype and speculation primarily about tesla joining the sp500 now that has come true it will be interesting to see what happens nextonce the passive funds invest in tesla the demand dynamic changes the speculative hysteria goes awaymore particularly the sp500 is weighted according to market cap and so passive funds need to adjust their holding purely based on market cap so let us assume for whatever reason tesla share price corrects 20 in the new year after a bit of profit taking it is common for a share to spike prior to being added to an index and then dropping sharply within 45 days after the event so hypothetically if the share price falls 20 then all these passive funds will be required to reduce their weighting of tesla holdings by a corresponding 20 thats about 20bn of shares being force to be sold what would that do to price depress it by a further 10 perhaps which would require the funds to sell off more of their holding to adjust the weighting again and so you get a negative feedback loop where it falls and falls then the robin hood investors panic and start selling who would buy in such circumstances no one wants to try to catch a falling knife as the old market saying goesim not saying that this will happen but it is one of a number of possibilities only you can assess the risk of it happening but so far this year all tesla buyers have experienced only moves higher and so are lured into a false sense of security we dont know how they would respond if the market turned bearish for these shares its likely to be a blood baththe question that i always ask tesla bulls is at what price would you consider the shares to be overpriced resulting in you selling without exception none have ever been able to give me an answer this too is a red flag for me because it indicates that they are treating a tesla share as a lottery ticket rather than as an investment2021 will be interesting for tesla shareholders but anyone expecting a repeat of 2020 is likely to be in for a rude awakeningdisclosure i have no shares in tesla and no intention of buying at current market prices03 dec 2020 0351 pm
the fact we’re still green despite the massive market sell off today just makes me happy i’m long

at the 800b market cap tsla is trading at roughly 20x next years target revenue of 40b most car companies trade at less than 05x revenue because the margins are so slim and there is no reason to believe in the long run that tslas profit margins will be any better than any other carmaker so if tsla grows revenues by 50 per year compounded unprecedented for a car company in roughly 7 years they will generate enough revenue to warrant a 1x revenue multiple  and the stock would still be overpriced the more likely scenario is they grow much less than that and the stock price falls to a realistic multiple so in 7 years it might be worth 50b100b

at this rate tsla will be worth more than rest of nasdaq top 100 companies they lost market share in europe in 2020 to vwchinese govt might control nio and that wont be good for tslafree subsidies will stop in us with states reeling under budget crisis including cabut millenials think the whole world will only dirve tsla by 2030
tesla shirts since the stock split
how much faith i have to show in tesla i dont understand the current valuation with its fundamentals
there are a few things that keep coming up that i think need clarification1 yes ark funds do sell tesla shares its because they have to in order to balance the funds if tesla rises significantly they have to trim shares so that a certain percentage of the fund isnt exceeded by tesla alone and so risk is managed since tesla has been on a tear its value in the funds skyrockets anyway its just normal maintenance for very wellmanaged funds and it signals no more than that if you have doubts visit the ark invest site and look at the number of shares held vs shares sold2 yes tesla is astronomically overvaluedif youre judging by standard figures and philosophy but as we know tesla tends to defy such valuation there are a few analysts who have recognized this early on and several who are finally coming around to the idea teslas value comes from the potential of all of its irons in the fire not just current car sales and revenue even if we ignore the attraction to elon musk for his various endeavors like spacex and the irrational exuberance and cultish nature of the stock we cant ignore the potential tesla holds in various sectors battery tech solar power electric utility car insurance autonomous cars and robotaxisand oh yeah cars its a long list yes there are those who kick and scream about it and its understandable nonetheless the reality is right in front of us has it crashed in the past sure its been quite volatile can it crash again absolutely can it continue to rise also absolutely but one thing is for certain its real and there are good reasons behind it even if theyre not the typical ones3 if elon musk decides he wants to sell some shares good for him i would if i had such a quantity i have no idea what he plans to do with his fortune but if he were to sell some shares it doesnt indicate a loss of faith or guidance part of elon musks compensation is stock if he wants to sell some shares he has every right to do so and should as hes worked hard for it and deserves his pay4 tesla is musks only publiclytraded company to get in on the others like spacex requires highdigit private investment if theres any opportunity available at all i do recall musk mentioning that if starlink goes public tesla investors would have first crack at shares im not sure about the logistics of that but it would be nice for us will spacex go public probably not as musk likely relishes the freedom to not have to answer to stockholders on that onejust my two cents hope it provides some clarity for those with concerns andor questions good investing and best of luck to all of us
bubble imploding
tesla will probably be worth twice as much under biden versus trump
on route to 800
another great article about how competition is slowing tslacannot believe they actually sold less cars year over year in europe and the stock sits where it iscompletely overvalued

new strain pulling down tsla stock hope it hits 850 by 15th
i love how anyone thinks tsla will do anything but go up everyone and their mom has tesla stock i wouldn’t be surprised if it went past 1t in the next year

tsla could hit 15t market cap most overhyped  most overvalued stock in the history of worlds stock market
the big buying will occur tonight at close index funds have to buy then let’s go fam happy holidays 
hello followers and happy new year i have been on an extended holiday and have just returned i have analyzed thoroughly and see that tsla is sitting in the perfect position for the royal canadian mounties  the option mms and their followersplayers to effect the very significant  most significant in fact option unwind in the history of tsla you see that this friday  the jan 15 options will expire these were the former leap options that have been around for a couple of years or so so they naturally have a lot of open interest  but in fact they have more open interest than any series of options that tsla has experienced ever so much interest  that if you choose the strike price which renders the lowest dollar value of all the combined options outstanding for jan 15 expiry added together  what all the calls and puts of the whole series would be worth if tsla closes at that strike price they would still be worth 143 billion  that compares with the analgous figure of 380 million for the jan 22 expiration  a small percentage of the dollar open interest of the jan 15 exp at yesterdays close of aprox 850 the jan 15 options would be worth aprox 226 billion  now i have seen tsla swallow 2 billion of change from the ldv without trouble when it has news or huge momentum but never has it had to swallow such a difference before it is going to be interesting to see this expiration have fun my followers

california is loaded with teslas on its roads of course it’s only domestic plant for now is in fremont but the waiting time for delivery is significantly shortened our special order model 3 was was ready for delivery in less than a week as production rises they are shipping more all over the country and world every week service centers mobile service supercharger and tesla destination charging stations are expanding rapidly online direct factory used and new tesla bev sales and online software ev updates eliminates the need for marketing or sales staff or dealers drive a tesla before judging their worth

i have so many enemys on yahoo since i speak out loud the truth they try to silence me since months with different methods reporting with false claims copycat accounts diffaming you people cant silence the truth nio is overtaking the game and china is entering a new phase with less subsidies but more need for intrinsic motivation to buy evs and only nio is creating the intrinsic brand value needed for that you cant silence the truth but you can decide to hold the bags denying to rebalance your ev portfolios for this new phase nio will overtake if you like it or not tsla xpev li

2 trading days into the new year and ive made 24k already how much have you lot of tesla shorters made so far
my honest opinion is turn off stop losses immediately the big players are in this game and the stock could drop by 50100 for a few seconds before bouncing back even stronger there is currently minimal risk of this stock dropping near term i don’t like guessing numbers but we will be up by 1221 take it or leave it i really don’t care i just don’t want investors losing money due to manipulation good luck to all 
for all you bulls at what point will you sell unrealized gains cant change your lives
tsla stock shall it cross 700 tomorrow
tesla almost bigger then fb facebook matter of weeks months enjoy your evening
so many thought tsla would be more stable as an sp 500 stock that is wrong tsla should be even more volatile think about it indexes just took away from available shares so the same number of traders are now trading fewer available shares

ark sold 44 thousand shares of tesla yesterday
the stock price now is only valid for the stocks sold now it does not represent the value of tesla no one would pay that much for the whole company so next week the stock price could be 1000 or 100 depending on if mania continues or not i dont own or short tesla but if i did own i would sell all and go short now only a few will become very rich on this bubble and they are folliwing my advice 90 of the so called longs will be looking at a blood red trading account forever the peak price will never come back good luck

too late to buy some calls
some people judge a stock by its revenue and earning alone this is so wrong and that’s why some have difficulties to understand tesla crazy growth i agree it is very high but one has to understand the reasons behind it i will say one word trust is the word you trust a company that moves the world you trust the people behind the company who believe in what they are doing and achieving you trust in the company culture made of innovation you trust it that’s a reason why some stock may seem crazy innovation and breakthrough can make a rocket
800 soon  elon we love u

might i suggest backing up your long term investment in tsla with a longterm investment in an energy fund which are low right now as evs will increase demand on fossil fuels in the near future since over sixty percent of the usas electricity comes from fossil fuels in essence tsla is run mostly on fossil fuels also a fund based on electric utilities will be a good long term investment as the evs tax the electric grids more and more and electric companies rake in the profits as demand puts pressure on supply capitalize where you can tsla longs

lord jesusi am not a holder nor a hater but this is fun to watchi personally think it will crash before the year ends eventually tslas financial statement will need to show something to prove that its productsservices are that valuable i keep hearing that its going to be more than a car company yea ok but as of right now its just a car company mind you its a car company that makes its profits from selling creditsanyway i hope none of my fellow retail investors lose a material amount of money over this
my small position in tsla is worth a lot more than my large position in xom thank you elon
big ol juicy bubblesomeone made a good point comparing to apple rather contrasting when apple reached 500 billion in market cap which folks was really not that long ago they were doing over 150 billion in revenue and raking in 30 billion in profit to put this in perspective tesla does not even 30 billion in revenue at this point and is in a much more competitive space with a significantly lower margin product anyway i think everyone knows its a bubble at this point just how far can it be inflated
been hearing on the street rumors that musk wants to split 251 then merge with spacex
i’m short at 713 what about you my fellow shorts
so for every share you buy for 844 tesla makes 29 in revenue and 2 of that is profit seems like a real good deal
tesla investors please buy signal stockso that i can laugh
900 before feb
are we gonna have short squeeze tomorrow
stock split by may 2021
this will bounce back harder on monday but will go down till eod today
all believers that tsla should be the most valuable company in the world raise your hands thumbs up
amazing that tesla produced and delivered 500000 cars in a pandemic where every other automaker saw demand go down incredible
oppenheimer analyst colin rusch assigned a buy rating to tesla tsla – research report today and set a price target of 103600 the company’s shares closed last tuesday at 84455 close to its 52week high of 88449
how tesla feels after beating street estimates again
why the latest pop the average wait time to get a license plate for a ice car in china is 2 12 3 years but in 2021 you get to the front of the line if you have a ev car not hard to understand what kind of car people would want to buy in china 
helloyou are all hindsighters who think you are wizards and predict teslas directioni dont think of myself as a wizard nor a predictor of any future direction however i am fortunate to understand an opportunity when presented and realize common sense that is clearly visible hence the now obviously good idea to stop daytrading tsla from 2010  2011 and buy a decent number of shares in 2012 which i continue to hold and addedtraded additional shares from timetotimei think there are many other investors who have bought tsla early and continue to hold when the ev movement has resulted in todays action with many new players entering the space and being traded higher at a rapid pace selling makes zero sense
at some point tesla should sell enough cars to justify their valuation plus profit from car sales a very long way to go or the valuation will drop to meet what they actually dohttpstwittercomtweetmyinboxstatus1345771438603726848
tsla has been single handedly holding up the s  p 500 in 2021

theres a song from the 1980s call shooting for the moon sung amy holland that epitomizes the year 2020 for me on august 3rd of this year i completed my mba degree then three weeks later the rising value of all tesla stocks in my primary portfolio pushed it over the million dollar mark it took me 10 years and alot of blood sweat  tears of careful investments to get my portfolio to the million dollar mark as the song goes funny how sometimes life just changes over mightwhen youre shooting for the moon and finally make it guess a lucky star is shining on you the candle on the cake is yours so take it
if gm had the same pe as tsla its market cap would be almost as much as aapl amzn and msft combined
tesla so little revenue how can it be valued to 500b 1100 pe is surreal everyone knows margins in the car industry is very tight therefore car companies have pe 50 at best
so glad i shorted for a couple hrs and covered good return on this overvalued stock thank you long for a nice xmas gift pls buy the dips so i can come in again
just like tsla shorts experienced in 2020 baba shorts will learn a nice surprise in 2021
this thing will never stop
ride this higher until you see a turn competition is certainly coming not just to tsla autos but also to their technology margins are going to get hurt with so many entering the field they already are dropping car prices dont fight the trend higher but be on the alert
volkswagen is in turmoil they are years behind tesla they are having internal issues about how to catch up to tesla you dont know anything about volkswagen their ceo might get ousted because he is telling the family owners aka porche that they are way behind tesla but porche doesnt want to hear it

i offer my sincere thanks to all short sellers you are amazing and wonderful contribution to tslas rise
 tesla expected to reach 1000 prior to the sp mass buyout   better buy in before dec 21
like what this has a pe nearly 20x higher than amazon this is the unholy mother of all bubbles most overvalued stock ive ever seen by a large margin
between nio day and the applehyundai news it will be interesting how tesla will trade on monday any predictions
this has proved that people don’t care what valuations they’re buying into they care only about the stock price split this to 10 and they will run it to 1000 again
so much hate for bitcoin and tsla from people who have never made any real money off either but would be absolutely loving it if they had
suppose its going to bounce back and forth between 845850 again starting to think the ceiling is going to be approx 850 until jan 27 and then it could go either way by quite a lot after selling at 850 i am on the sideline now tsla is an enigma to me at the moment
would be nice to hear elon provide some information on the production and delivery of the cybertruck and semi to get the markets attention the price will increase
it’s hard to tell exactly when this insanity will end but to me it seems it has already begun this is the defining quarter
super fun drive 350 miles yesterday in tesla model y performance this is the most amazing car i have ever driven thank you tesla bad traffic seems so nice  good traffic seems like a day at the indy 500
soon tesla will go to 1000 thums up if you agree with me
tsla will be for month normal
i know i might not have the amount of shares some of you might have but i finally got to 100000 and im 25  40k gain so far
inside transactions show lots of selling and can you blame them
i can’t believe the afterhours price hike
50 dec 2018
goldmans upgrade of tsla announcement indicated tslas price decrease was really due to improvement in cost and it was passing the cost savings to the consumers it was funny the shorties always assume the worst they claimed the price reduction was due to loss in market share if that were truly the case where is the unsold inventory
at 81 yes 81 tesla is still overvalued extremely strong sell
gm was once big cisco was once fashionable steel industries was once grand so was the mgm and cigarette stocks great inventions evs are fantastic not forever my friend not forever
tslas market capitalization is over 13m per car produced in 2020 the future is simply not rosy enough to rationally support this price
and if you do your homework to see how many out of 17 million are sold under 25k you would be shocked to think tsla will make profit
just for everyones info  tsla addressable market is about 300400 trillion at a minimum they are already getting about 1 of that easily that means the stock should be worth at least 46x more which is around 3200 per share its only 850 which is nonsensically low  buy buy buy 
yesterday sell off and morning is the time where shorts should have covered the 5b offering share sale is done so path is cleared for only growth from now to 700
why is tesla a better investment than amazon on the retail side amazon could never compete with walmart not even with prime amazon didnt make a profit until aws no doubt bezos did very well with cloud where amazon holds a monopoly however aws is 100 software and software can be replicated you are starting to see microsoft google oracle etc grow their cloud business what about tesla margins for traditional automakers are generally low thats why most analysts were bearish on tesla till recently musk figured out how to improve those margins with automation specially designed robots in gigafactories for the first time you have a car company approaching a trillion dollar market cap secondly tesla is penetrating china which amazon can never do since china has its own version jd baba etc this puts tesla in the same playing field as apple lastly the tesla bet is not on hardware but software particularly level 5 autonomous driving tesla will be able to charge something like 150 per mile reaping massive profits so tesla can reap similar profit as amazon from software if you think of tesla as just a car marker then its clearly overvalued with software the valuation is much higher
i havent looked if oldtime tsla investors have been taking profits but if they are who cares inclusion into the sp should draw 10 times more investors into tsla we thank the oldtime investors for bringing tsla to this point but we dont need all of them anymore thumbs up if you are an oldtime tsla investor and you still plan on holding tsla long into the future
anyone else buying lotsa tesla in the 850 range expecting it to go way up after the inaguration and the stimulus checks
to everyone waiting for the pull back to buy ini’ve been waiting for the tsla pullback since 400 pps never got in
thank you elon and tesla employees
everyone knows we are not just investing in this amazing company we are investing in elon with his leadership devoted work practices and thrive to make a difference he is changing the world at a drastic rate tesla is the people’s link to elon future leader of mars and saviour of our beautiful planet earth

 teslas 25k car with fsd to start production and sale next year  game over every college student and grandma will now be able to afford a tesla
isnt tesla way overdue to reveal a new vehicle or product other than software seems like its been a long time since the cyber truck was revealed i would have thought at least a teaser of either a real suv an offroad capable jeepbronco thingy or at least the 25k small sedancrossover what exactly is tesla design doing these day i know refinement of the cyber truck is in play but musk concluded no facelift for models s and y just seems like theres been a drought of fresh product musk promised renderings of the revised design intent for cyber truck in november im guessing elon is holding these aces in his back pocket as there is obviously no current need to pump share price its doing that on its own
when tsla was 50 a share people said company will collapse again when it was 100 people said it is inflated and will collapse it went to 200 and the same messages it went to 300 then 400 then 500 then 600 then 700 then 800 then 884 and they say it will collapsei cant help but smile
who are the shareholders that get diluted and push the stock price higher can only be computer algorithms programmed to take it higher
my friend brought his model s into tesla service its axles are clicking the car is under warranty he drives mostly in chill modethe service center said all axles are breaking pre raven modelsas are ball jointshe told him to drive in chill mode all the time what and the service manager told him tesla will cover repair once and no more even under warrantyclass action customer lawsuits are coming
guys serious questioni have lost everything and im not sure how to continue this summer i invested 17500 six months salary and my entire life savings into ornamental gourd futures hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry after watching a video about vincent kosuga and his monopoly on onions i decided id try to do something similar with another vegetable i did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this years gourd yield would be far smaller than the past due to deteriorating soil conditions in central mexico and a warmerthanaverage spring at first demand soared around halloween and prices skyrocketed but the gourd bubble burst on november 12th unfortunately the coronavirus caused a massive dropoff in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for thanksgiving and prices plummeted i had invested early enough that i thought i would still be fine but then on the morning of december 2nd a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel the massive gourd shipment from argentina scheduled for early march had arrived i was planning on selling off my futures right before this in february but this ruined everything to top it off the gourds in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan some topping 4 pounds each causing the priceperpound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound i am ruined
we break 69500 today
780 yet
kaboom
why so much salt today i guess shorties saw that downgrade got excited and bought more puts only to be crushed again
when vw sells more evs this year than tesla i wonder what excuse tesla fan boys will have for keeping this stock at a market cap thats more than the entire rest of the auto industry combined and come q3 when ford and gm are finally selling real evs that people want i wonder what happens when tesla has negative sales comps
was the rumor true that tsla in china received 100k orders upon price cut
they are pushing it down to get in lower before earnings buy the dip boys and girls
truly wonder if sec should become involved  opportunistic timing of upgrades and news alerts should ms be recommending it to its customers w great number of risks including inflation
i have 620 shares purchased at 259 what should i do
tesla is cokenio is rc cola
just for conversation how many cars will tsla have to build to make 4200 a share to get to a 20 pe and grow into this valuation things that make you go hmm
nio is more innovative and has larger sales than xpev so valuation is expected 20 higher at the least from xpev keep your eyes on alyi its basically repeating the process of tsla but acquiring funds through crypto currency release rather than government funding
i love how everyone thought tesla will have a major pullback if you look at history it has always gone up after it joined the sp what would make you think it will pullback tesla will rise to 800850 every time i called something out i’ve been right and made millions

what happens if they give targets like tsla for spce cant imagine how people rush to buy for long investments
longs i predict a shakeoff this week triggered by whales and high rollers on the sidelines they would want to get in on this beautiful action at a lower price so dont fall for it dont sell hold your tsla shares tight like your high school crush
yay the bounce begins

surely finished for the day right or maybe just enough time to squeeze in another ford market cap 
elon is headed to be the next henry ford when ford first started producing cars they were expensive to build and expensive to buy people think of the model t but there was a model sn k and a model a not the same as the 1930s long before the model t when tsla sorts itself out the way ford did with a vehicle everyone can afford with mass volume and a low production cost it will be the second coming of the industrial revolution thats what is being priced in here 
super green december 1st the best month is about to come is everyone excited  let’s go higher in january 2 months of green benjamin’s
serious question  if these index funds have to buy tesla on friday and investors are aware of thatthen why are share prices not double what they are right now i am thinking in terms of simple supply and demand given the current market cap i am not trying to ask a leading question or convince anyone of anything i am asking to honestly gain a better understanding thanks
apple cant compete with roku in devices and netflix in streaming do you really think they can compete with tsla in autonomous driving while they can its going to be harder and in the end they will be a conglomerate whose own stock price will suffer investors will ask that the firm be broken just like they are asking google to be split up so no i dont think apple is a threat

mnv great future with tsla 2021
can we have some panic sellers so i can restock my stocks 3
shorts wow how can you guys take this many hits
over 800 today thumbs up for yes
recall is normal for any car company i guess some of the media tries to play the news to force the weak hands to run i just wait for the drop which i think it may be in the range 1030 points i am a long term which i think it will recover later
i try to be very logical with my wifes ira that i manage thats where we keep our tesla stock i keep a very close eye on this to protect our profit ive considered using a trailing stop loss just hadnt placed it yet because of teslas volatility ive heard this week tesla could see a significant drop because of the short interest after yesterdays drop i wanted to protect profit because i felt tesla would continue to go down so i placed a stop limit on our 500 shares at 805 i should have made it 800 because unfortunately it briefly dipped to just under 804 triggering a sale i was fine with that at the time because it locked in a 100 profit then i saw the premarket and thought  so back in at 83085 that little mistake cost me almost 13000 live and learn right i need to do better with my exit and reentry strategy i guess or perhaps just dont sell i just dont ever want to lose a lot of profit because of greed
tesla will double sales this year with model y sales in china chinese design factory cyber truck and full self drive elon also himtes at an autonomous day further suggesting full self drive this year stay long tesla will double sales and double stock price boys and girls

tsla has nothing left sp500 stimulus did nothing and battery day was a joke
they say theres good debt and there bad debt yes thats true but in times like this wheres the good debt as the good debt causes everyone to loose it all to banks  so in the end theres no such as good debt even if that debt paid you for years because in days like this can loose it all back as they programmed it for you ok fine but is there such as good and bad deficit  i say no unless you say only if deficit paid directly to the people  not in the name of stimulus where the money never reach that purpose
not enough tsla stock to go around  a few weeks ago i wrote how tesla being in the sp now locks up about 150 mil shares in mutual funds that basically take it out of circulation there are probably more funds that also buy and hold cramer said on cnbc that there are not enough stocks to invest in so the high demand and low supply is making the price go up i agree with him completely if you had money you want to invest  what would you buy not money markets not bonds you buy stocks of course but which ones  you buy tesla of course and since there are less sellers  the price goes up

ya knowi like spending my days in a positive wayit amazes me how many tesla bashers are on here no one is encouraging you to believe in elons visionor that he isnt just focused on the evsowhy jump in a tesla chat room if you keep saying  the sky is falling  ponzi scheme as of today this is still a capitalist society it took bezos 14 years to turn a profit do you think he stayed primarily focused on book deliveries you all believe in ford first auto manufacturer after the horse yet decades later they had close to 600k recalls over electric issues and infamous brake issues on the f150and no vision that evs were the futurebottom line keep your day fulfilled dont own a tesla or buy the stockcarry on my friend
if youre concerned about the pe then look at their forward pe thats is a major drop translating to massive gains in financials revenue and cash flow will be off the charts
for those tha feel the impending correction of tesla in the immediate future im not here to bash tesla love the company have the utmost respect for musk especially in the direction he has been able to push forward in what i am here for is to explain what is going on with valuation anyone saying tesla will go to 20k is just ignorant i know tesla doesnt trade on fundamentals but think about this for a moment tesla has been the most shorted stock ever when they hit the sp500 bigger funds begin to buy in making those that recently have been short unable to continue and have been forced to buy back the stock at a loss increased price this will not last much longer eventually you will have some big time shorts currently just micheal burrell come in and this will fall hard it will get back up but do you want to risk that much depreciation look at the numbers you should invest where you can make 100 to 400 over a year can you look at teslas market cap and really believe all the big hedge funds that are now buying in are going to hold when it reaches 30 or more  than what it is now and how hard do youthink this will fall ive been investing in spacs for less than a year what do i know right i do have a portfolio that has gained 756 and they arent sitting in overvalued positions they are reinvested into companies with the potential for 3 to 400 returns for the year currently my latest position was in hcac warrants hcacw i bought them at 18 also bought more at 35 they are at 47 now they already merged with canoo and will likely get to 10 to 15 in the near future everyone should have seen by now hyundais surge nearly 20 billion added to market cap just on the rumor that they are in talks with apple heres the fun part canoo is doing the engineering services for hyundais ev sector they have designed their new skateboard platform for them they have their own as well and will be a disruptor in the market in so many ways but just think about this aapl has talked about their monocell as superior battery tech they are now talking with hyundai musk has said that monocells are impossible and canoo tweeted the new year in with ready to keep engineering the impossible in 2021 as if to give musk a heads up then of course left with thisjust read between the lines but the rumor and sell on the news im not here to pump im here to help those that have a gut feeling right now listen to it its made me 756 for 2020 and im already up another 60 since then canoo is goev warrants are goevw roll your profits over and gain another big run them when tesla has had its correction we can be ready to jump back in again

when i look at tsla i think of csco on a split adjusted basis one could have bought cisco at less than 10 cents a share when it first traded publicly in march 1990 by jan 1992 it had almost tripled by jan 1994 it had double about twice more by 1996 it had doubled again in jan 1998 it reached a high of 1079share two years later in jan 2000 cisco had doubled again it reached its all time high of 82share in march 2000 in jan 2002 its monthly high was only 2184 in september 2002 it reached a low of 1048 today csco trades around 44 if you had bought csco in january 2000 and held on over 20 years to today you would have a loss if you bought csco in january 1999 you would have a modest profit something more than a 50 gain over 23 years and would not have kept up with the sp 500if you bought csco back in january 1998 more than 2 years before the peak your investment would have doubled twice but thats only about a 7 annual rate of return and just about average for the marketcsco reached a market cap over 500 billion at its peak in 2000 it now has a market cap less than 200 billioncsco was no enron it has shown growth in annual earnings every year for 20 years

im gonna give you an opinion take it or leave it you make up your mind tesla has been the absolute most shorted stock like many billions lost and with this new surge up i believe it is due to shorts unable to take it any longer this cannot go like this forever at 500 post split this had a potential downfall to 300 at 850 nothings changed and the downfall is still 300 so i urge you to at least take profits and if your a new trader do some math you would have to reach 1600 to get 100 i generally invest only in companies that can potentially reach 400 per year you wont see that with tesla on to some advice take it or leave it aapl is getting into the ev spacs with hyundai spilling the beans that they are in talks with apple about batteries etc goev or canoo will be providing the skateboard and engineering services to hyundai for their next evs and likely for apples a company that has a market cap of 3 billion now do you think a 700b company would be a better investment or a 3b company i can see canoo going to 40 to 50b market cap pretty quickly  next 5 years do the math can tesla match that are they going to be providing everything ever produced that is where their market cap is going ive been in canoo warrants at 18 and averaged up to 35 anything under 5 is a bargain just some advice take it or leave it go with your gut your subconscious or whatever you want to call it

what if tesla misses the number and disappoints 500k delivery will the market forgive  why did elon sent that email to employees why did he cut 14 working days when shipping and deliveries are critical why did he flew to hawaii to meet his buddy elisson in hawaii why did explore and vocally thinking about taking it private when you connect the dots it reveals that he is working on plan b if he misses the number and alerting his friend larry and its employees about the possibilities one thumb rule in investing is that wallstreet doesnt like surprises or being misled this is going to be very very interesting and will occupy lots of cnbc time in january hopefully he doesnt tweets anything and  the market

does anyone have a schwab account my tesla price is off by 30 and i dont know why
currently the recall is voluntary but they are moving to make it mandatory as it poses a safety concern as it controls the car tesla is hesitant because it isnt the easy fix they currently claim we are talking about changing out an integrated chip which would require the removal and disassembly of every screen and replacement of an integrated component if it is even possible
my prediction tsla share will be 1000000000000000000000008956wait and seejust wait and see
gordon johnson says i told you so their delivery number would beat expectation because they low balled the expectation earlier they can do much better

i just invested the kitchen sink all family savings and childrens college fun and a loan from wifes parents into tesla at 810 and didnt even tell my wife i want to surprise her next year with my gains am i safe here

watch out the bears are standing behind teslas in the dark so they can buy some shares when the price is at 3400
tesla up 2366  after the 5 days of the new year i like a stock that pays me money to do nothing
tesla may need to keep dropping their price and offering free stuff to meet targets pls drop it here in the states i would buy the model s for 25k for sure also does anyone feel confident about buying a used tesla

howdy folksas of friday we hit a 1 trillion dollar market cap herethats taking into account the fully diluted shares outstandingend of quarter 3 numbers there were roughly 1105 billion shares outstanding equaling 976 billion dollar market capnow take the extra shares outstanding we were slightly over 1 trillion dollar market capthats a wowconsidering when you take the top 18 auto manufactures with their 836 billion dollar market cap combinedplus they make 17 trillion dollars a year in revenueim sorry folks i dont think tesla will ever make that much money
upon reflection upon some of the bizarre numbers coming from tsla bulls and the frequent posted hope that a new stock split was coming it occurs to me that there may be longs out there who dont understand that a 5 for 1 gives you 5 times as many pieces of tsla but each piece is 15 the size thats why absent extreme mania or ignorance among investors stock splits do not move the total market cap telsa now as about 1 billion shares outstanding before dilution by elon coming option bonuseseven assuming tsla sold 1 million cars in 2021 to earn as much as 350 share for the full year it would have to have a net profit not just operating profit of 3500 per car sold that just isnt possible especially when most of the assumed sales have to be in china or india since there is no way us and european sales are going to top even 500000 in 2021 they might even be down year over yearthe reason it isnt possible for tsla to achieve such high margins is that what tsla can do in manufacturing can be done by everyone else there is no room for magic here if tsla can successfully use robots on the production line to achieve substantial labor cost savings there will be other manufacturers doing so as well if automation is cost effect it will be duplicated by competitors this is especially true in new markets like china and india
too many amazing catalysts for 2021 i know you some of you day traders are tempted to sell but this is gonna the big winner yet again in 2021
i recommend checking out the uk car registration trends and where tesla model 3 stands in december  spoiler alert they are number 1 you should also crunch the numbers in terms of the marketshare over 26 of the battery electric vehicles bev with the model 3 being shipped from the us now that is in a segment that grew 344 in december 2020 compared to dec 2019imagine the opportunity once giga berlin openshttpswwwsmmtcoukvehicledatacarregistrations
another opportunity to sell in 800s today
dear god elon  i has have worked hard for you almost 9 years long until now can you please make my portfolio of tesla account getting fatter please thank god elon  so i can retire comfortably
lets hope we all get to share in the great share dollar amount today
i consider a 5 billion cash raise above 600share as prudent wise and great longterm news for tesla shareholders last time they did the same slightly below 500share which was also wise this time is even less dilutive with todays news and the big brokerages working closely to help elon and tesla now i am totally convinced the stock price will surpass 700 before christmas glta

apple products are massively overpriced yet plenty of people pay a premium whats the secret ecosystem a series of products that complement each other once youre in the ecosystem its hard to get out the final objective is for people to buy tesla cars lease them out via robotaxi and cover liabilities via tesla insurance the car battery will be teslamade upgrades to the car software will be tesla specific and done by tesla remotely fsd will be teslapatented the charger will be tesla made the only parts of the car not designed by tesla will be some chips and the entertainment system
simply incredible i dont think there has ever been another stock like this on earth i left the tesla train for now good fortune to the longs

just for fun  8  tesla ends the year with a bang they sold 878 evs in france in december 2020the legacy automakers  only sold 31024 evs  the term legacy automaker is supposed to convince you that people prefer evs and they prefer tesla evs over those offered by the other manufacturers the numbers show that people prefer icevs over evs the numbers show that french consumers who buy evs have no preference for tesla at all
stock jump 17 which is 16b when add already issued options you can buy 300k of those 500k with that money what even more important is they produced 10k more but only able sell  500k if you ask elon for reason he will use logistic issuei believe him but then question is why its problem every quarter after quarter world most decorative genius cant figure out simple logistic issue to deliver 500k car even after forcing user to buy lemon car either by promise or forceful way if possible but those old out of touch car maker worth 10th of market cap will never have that issue
a message from elon indicates the 500k delivery achieved
im taking a poll herehow many deliveries do you think they will announcemy guess is if the number is under 210k i think we get a correctionmaybe 195k to 210k we get sideways actioni still think this is one of the top 5 most overvalued bubbles in the market right nowplease share your thoughtsthank you
congratulations to all new and existing teslanaires

if youre old enough do you recall the first time you heard about barcode scanning for groceries it seemed such a novelty at first but soon you began to see it in your neighborhood grocery stores no more tedious handpunching of prices into a register and the checkout lines sped up it seemed pretty marvelous now its the norm i think this is what well be seeing in the next couple of years in terms of selfdriving cars the first ones we see will seem like a novelty then very soon after it will become so common as to be the norm were on the cusp of something very big here

the auto market brings as a whole is 25 billion dollars a year by 2025 how is tesla worth 20x there potential market this is madness even if u assume they own 100 of the global market they won’t touch they’re market cap then let’s look at batteries that’s only projected to make 115 billion by 230 and lithium ion will most likely be up rooted why is tesla worth this much the prospects of out shipping amazon and or the millions of companies well established in that space are grim

saying tesla is a car company is like saying disney is a cartoon company 
we are at a low right nowid get in with everything you got because this will continue to rise into the afternoon and will spike just before the close as the volume skyrockets we will see 700 today folksalso dont give into temptationhold 100 of your sharesthis will cause the buyers to bid the tape updont sell to them
tesla and bitcoin are both obvious ponzischeme style bubbles fundamentals have nothing to do with either one its all just speculation and momentum one key difference is that musk can issue new shares for tsla at any time ironically musk may have to issue new shares in order to keep tsla from crashing if the souffle is about to pop you have to turn the heat down a bit holding tsla shares is suicidemaybe you can get away with very short duration bull call spreads as long as youre allocation is not too large
the 5billion announcement has crushed the momentum im so bummed i finally got into tsla for my first time and it was right before they announce the 5 billion share sale my calls are not happy right now

congrats to all longs i dont have petition in tesla but you deserve to be rich happy new year and all the best
i just opened a short position at 883 that i may increase with time i like the company i like the ceo but you guys must be honest with yourself and admit that tsla is way overpriced and has been too far too quick it turned to a speculative vehicle with little in common with reality
anyone referencing 1600 pe or the per vehicle multiples has no idea how to value stocks relative to growth rates this company will have 100b revenue in the next few years and could eventually earn 10 plus profit margin thats 10b earnings on 800b market cap today so that would be 80 times earnings in a few yrs avg stock in the dow is 20 times earnings currently and is fair valued tesla will still be growing 4 times as fast as the avg stock in a few yrs so this stock is priced reasonable not cheap but not anywhere close to the overvalue people on here and elsewhere are talking about they dont understand how to value stocks
people still bad mouthing the tsla stock please avoid the noise the price will escalate

a musk always promised 500000 vehicles out of fremont alone not fremont and some other plant the 2020 goal should have been 1 millionb 499550 is not 500000 and its certainly not the 1000000 promised remember all of the millions of preorders and orders they used to publish 499k is an yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge misstesla delivered 499550 vehicles in 2020 a 36 increase over the previous year and just a few dozen short of hitting an historic and longawaited milestone that ceo elon musk has been aiming for more than five yearstesla reported saturday that it produced 509737 electric vehicles in 2020tesla was able to reach the 500000vehicle target by ticking up production and sales in the fourth quarter — a final push that has mirrored numerous other endofthequarter efforts by the company tesla delivered 180570 in the fourth quarter setting a new quarterly record and 30 higher than the previous quarterthe companys production and sales figures were also driven by the launch of the model y its midsized suv and a new factory coming online in chinaand yet tesla still loses money on each and every car sold
sorry but this train has long since left the station elon is a genius shareholders hit one rare jackpot
do you think seriously that a battery car company can have valuation like this  this company is now more valuable than facebook however facebook is a wide moat cash machine while tesla is a nearly zero profit company without a moat hahaha facebook should have the 50 times value of tesla
hi everyone ik this aint a place for taking suggestions but i bought 52 shares on margin for 615 should i hold overnight or just pay and get rid of the margin at this 595 price
price seems right bout primed for a dilution you can count on musk to do so he needs the cash and needs it fast

tesla earned 331m in net profits in the 3rd quarter of 2020 of that amount 397m came from zev credits that tesla sold to other auto manufacturers meaning teslas auto and other businesses lost 66m last quarter so without zev credits tesla was not yet profitable as of last quarter does anyone know when these credits will end as other manufacturers need them less and less when they make their own electric vehicles

thoughts on monday
tsla been too quiet for a weekgoing to be a huge spike today
i notice a lot of nio graffitis on tsla board here along with all other kinds of noise as to how tslatesla is going down etc i dont think any of the ev companies especially tesla or nio should worry about going down because the ev ecosystem is in the infancy stage just getting started and has an abundance of real estate to go about
today musk will become the most richer man on the planet
even if earnings are in line  the problem is the goal or forecast sales in 2021i am sure for 1000  that any number given by tesla optimistic not realistic number willnot be met in 2021 to convince yourself i invite everyone to check their sales in europe fex which are on a real declinecompetition is massive in ev in 2021 and in the years to come
the good story for tesla is that there will be no serious competition outside of china for perhaps 3 to 5 years but the most optimistic projections have tesla earning no more than a total of about 30share 30 billion by that time after 2023 its not clear that tesla will be able to compete profitablyall this surge in the stock price is sowing the seeds of future competition when tslas market cap was below gms apple might well ignore the ev market with tsla with a market cap approaching appl its natural to figure that it is worth designing a better ev just like it designs a better cell phone why shouldnt ever apple phone user regard the apple car as the natural extension of its ecosystem apple may well capture the high margin ev business and the old car manufacturers like gm dividing the low margin ev market there may not be much of a place for a tesla
just invest in the real thing called tsla or tesla which is run by a competent transparent and smart ceo you can afford fractional shares through robinhood leave this dubious nio company for the chinese market

tesla valuation is greater than all of the usa majors combined values tesla is the largest manufacturer of ev in the world expansion into foreign markets germany india china and yet again in the united states secured the leadership position in the ev i am optimistic and bullish in the longer term for a steady upward price trend btw shorts had a few good days last week if your timing was spot on right

man every time i buy this thing goes down
nio people know that after todays 15 gain it will all come down again because shorts will take all profits and come back to tesla for a furtjer gain that is how day and week trading works not to worry and do not do any irrational today last week tesla up 20 this week nio up 15 guess what will happen next week
i only see three possibilities for the people who complain about tesla1 they are bearish and they are shorting2 they wish they got in earlier and are hoping it goes down so they can buy at a lower price3 they are whining about a stock that they have no position in nor any intention to have a positionwhich is it
can tesla bulls explain to me why they think any of teslas supposed businesses  cars solarenergy battery and robotaxis are actually great businesses to be in of course there are profits to be made there but all are capital intensive slowtoscale and low margin hypothetically assuming tesla dominates each of these industries it wont why does it deserve a tech company valuation on a bunch of hard goods commoditized businessesdo you know what are excellent businesses  easily scalable software and platforms like fang

we’re inching to 800long and strong
to show how overvalued tesla is and yes they are a great company with a visionary leader let’s compare this to the biggest company in the world apple who also had a visionary leader in steve jobs in 07 apple released their first touchscreen iphone they climbed to a market cap of 175b while making close to 35b in revenue their pe ratio at that time was less than 40 and they were trading around 6x sales fast forward to 92012 apple reached a market cap of 650b after 5 whole years and before crashing down to 365b while making 156b in revenue with a pe of about 12 in comparison tesla is expected to close out this year on 31b of revenue while it has a market cap of close to 850b trading close to 30x sales and has a pe close to 1700 this makes tesla 5x 500 more overvalued than what the biggest company in the world was when they released their most innovative product then everything else that’s going on with the economy people losing their jobs unemployment at historic highs small businesses closing left and right and last week they were expecting 70k jobs to get added to payroll but instead 120k jobs were reduced i get the market is forward looking but it must be looking 2 years ahead these days and for tesla 5 years ahead yes this will likely be a 1t company and bigger down the road but with 100 certainty they are wayyyy too ahead of their time a crash is certain for the whole market but who knows when i’ll stay on the sidelines in the meanwhile the only thing driving this crazy market especially this stock is fear of inflation fomo and stimulus not fundamentals just look at all of faang stocks and compare historic pe ratios to this year i see some people saying pe is something created from way back when well news for you it’s not going away and reality is going to hit sooner than later

long term investors wouldnt you want to invest in a company such as tsla which has its product roadmap all built out its just a matter of achieving them or do you trust other ev makers which announce 1000 different products without any idea what they will do a year from now hope you know the answer to this as i do

this is the real mind blowing thing tesla produced 500000 cars last year and has a market cap of 766 billion and ford made 900000 of just f150s and has a market cap of 35 billion
this is a stock that only moves with hype there is no major change to their business in last year or so and yet the stock has market cap bigger than all of the auto industry
this stock is going up fast like it did last summer any guess as to another stock split another 51 split  on aug 11 2020 tesla announced the 51 stock split it closed at 1374in the next 10 days it went to 2049 on august 31 it was around 2238 then the following monday split 51

do you folks really think tesla can compete with plug power in the long haul fleet trucking market — lol plug power is just starting to work with oem’s to deliver their hydrogen progen engines 30 to 45 higher energy density“power” than the competition which are very advantageous for long haul fleet trucking here’s the main advantages of hydrogen versus batteries1 liquid “green” hydrogen fuel clean zero emissions — versus — toxic batteries charged by an electric grid using primarily dirty fossil fuels and batteries are putting a tremendous strain on the electrical grid — increasing the potential for “black outs”2 500 mile range per liquid “green” hydrogen tank so install 2 tanks and drive for 1000 miles — “double the range” of a battery semi truck3 5 to 6 times faster refueling — time is money by the time a battery semi is getting charged a hydrogen fuel cell semi truck is already at their destinations loading dock — unloading their cargo — lol 4 lower operating costs — plug power offers real time iot monitoring of predictive servicemaintenancewith plug power vertically integrating to build the “green hydrogen superhighway” across america the issue of a lack of fueling stations will soon be a nonissue  as a plug shareholder i sure am looking forward to the long haul fleet trucking market getting rolling  and with plug power’s new stateoftheart automated pem stack  electrolyzer gigafactory soon to be operational the manufacturing costs of the engine components are expected to be lower by 50 at the same time plug will be building the 5 new liquid “green” hydrogen generation plants along the “green hydrogen superhighway” which will increase their gross profit margin on the “recurring” revenue stream of fuel by between 30 to 35 in the near future plug power is going to enter into the long haul fleet trucking market i just wanted to give the tesla shareholders a “heads up”   invest  hold plug  for the long haul 
guys anytime theres a big long extended pullback like this its almost always because word has leaked that theyre going to do another capital raise im pretty good an used to it by now the mms short the stock and push the price down in order to secure the best possible price for the issuance this will be a good thing though plus as the share price increases any future equity raises will have a smaller and smaller impact li bin is pretty wise about how he spends his money look at tsla elon cant even do proper equity raise anymore they have to raise money at whatever prevailing market rate they happen to find good luck with that

will be interesting to see what happens when tesla posts they achieved their production target my guess is its priced in already just like the anticipation for battery day too much high expectations for this stock it will probably remain flat for 2021 its already 10x the market cap of general motors hard to fathom
earnings date 12721 i have a feeling that tesla is going to be flat until we get to the earnings date and the institutions will react accordingly so if you think tesla will meet or beat then its time now to start loading up if you think tesla wont then you might want to cover the shorts at this time are in sphincter muscle tightening mode so its best not to sell at this time but the smart move is to cover your bet and if you load up then get the rewards on the earnings date 12721
any opinions about tesla buying ford  there are a lot of rumors it would make sense

my favorite comment in here why is the stock down the term bubble is being thrown around a lot and its 100 apparent when rappers like meek mill are telling people to buy tsla when the guy has no fundamental understanding of the marketthe institutions are slowly selling off as to not  you all youre the bag holders who are washing the free qed money they printed if you made money be smart get outif not live with your own choices when it inevitably does greed clouds judgmenta
here’s the thing with tesla it’s volatile because it’s a hype train it could rocket it could drop it’s not a safe stock by all means because at any point the market could catch up to its actual worth which is a lot less than it’s trading at it’s not a bad investment it’s just not a rock solid stable one
bitcoin should crash this week or next week then all of a sudden all that money shall flow into tsla

do y’all know why these companies like nio and tsla are offering more shares real simple they know that these prices won’t last forever it’s a smart move on their part but also it’s an indication of what is to come in the future it’s really simple they know their stocks are in bubbles created by the low interest rate environment we are in they know that once the fed signals they are raising rates that the bubble will burst  so they are cashing in now

tsla short sellers lost 401 billion last year and have been defeated its hard to imagine anyone has had a better year than elon musk did in 2020 his personal net worth soared like one of his spacex rockets increasing by more than 100 billion and his loudest critics aka investors who shorted tesla tsla stock on the assumption the share price would go down lost a record 401 billion betting against him according to analysis by s3 partnersmany of the shorts were forced to admit defeat last year about twothirds of the short positions were unwound during 2020 which in itself was a factor that helped drive tesla shares higher as the short investors were forced to buy higherpriced shares to exit their positions

the people who are buying these bubble stocks really have no idea what they are buying tesla is priced as if it will own 50 of the entire ev market for the next 30 years this is preposterous but it wont stop the bubble buyers peloton is priced as if they have cured cancer but in fact they sell exercise bikes quantumscape was priced by the spac target the premerger seller quantumscape management itself as if it was worth 10 per share and now a few months later it trades at 50 door dash is a completely unsustainable business model who is going to pay an extra 10 for a burger it has no earnings but is now worth 60b there are literally bubbles everywhere you look the buyers are completely nonselective anything going from lower left to upper right is a good buy regardless of future earnings the idiocy is just really off the charts right now all thanks to the fed and money printing machine this wont end well and all i can say is dont be the bag holder crashes do happen  2001 and 2008 are perfect examples the millennials werent born yet and assume that it could never happen to them what is needed to end this drunken party is just a little bit of profit taking a little bit becomes a little bit more and then crash is on

tesla has done it again  model 3 experience is unique if these stories are true then consumer reports should experience similar problems with their model 3w then give tesla another pass  today at 10am i wired the full payment to tesla prior to tomorrows expected model 3 delivery tonight at 5pm i got a call from tesla telling me the drive unit failed and now i have to wait for another car  my model 3s 12 volt battery died now i cant unlock or start my car  tesla model 3 down wont power up and is inaccessible  we picked up our model 3 in denver on friday and on the way home we heard a rattle and clunking noise every time we drove over an irregular surface  tesla model 3 sets new range record at 6062 miles  we reached out to sean to see if more details were available yet it seems that they don’t have any answers but the car is currently being towed to a tesla service center
so shouldn’t those analysts who predict a 70 dollar price for tesla be fired
the problem with this stock is that it will hold one of the biggest risk in the market the expectations are sky high
the crazy part is the volume isnt even insane its just normal

class action against elon musk damages  90 liability for all damages and deaths incurred from covid 19 on or after the date april 1 2020 which is around the time the virus would have been controlled if felon would have let us shutdown the country also 100 billion dollars of ill gotten gains from his deadly and fraudulent coronavirus denial campaignwe seek compensation for these damages plus cost of legal fees
there def are some very similar comparisons to the late 90s early 2000s with the tech bubble new technology with the internet people veiwing computer stocks differently because it was a new era things got way ahead of themselves and crash sure amazon and a few others came out on the other side but not after a big fall history always repeats itself always humans never learn is this exactly the same maybe new tech new era in cars electric etc stocks getting way ahead of themselves bubble probably bubble isnt bad unless you are stuck in it when it bursts and the horror show happens when people buy the dip when the knfie is falling not realizing the bubble has burst making the horror show 10 times worse im treading lightly investing a little not betting the house the car or even the dog on it at the moment
the increased volume is another key point adding to the possibility that today was the start of a blow off top it may go up a couple days but the days are numbered if it keeps going at this rate i think next week will be fun i sold my calls today and bought more puts but i may buy back my calls on monday if it keeps running either way i am going to have my finger on the trigger
this is what people said about nflx amzn fb now last train is tsla and i am not missing it

thoughts on buying nio shares
i think this can go to 1million per share
for everyone concerned about pe just remember earnings day is around the corner and that number will no longer be that outlandish don’t forget amazon had a similar pe once
been looking around the web about response to nio day it is very bullish tsla has the high stock price it has relative to sales because of its tech first mover status and the future sales it will and is starting to yield nio just unveiled the type of tech that will have the same impact and comparing their growth story and sales levels to tsla it is obvious that nio should be waaaay higher not tsla levels but it should get to about 175 eoy it is not a matter of tsla vs nio it is tsla  nio vs the ice companies who are five years behind nio and tesla on the tech the long drive to 175 starts monday
great year for tesla congratulations to tesla investors 2021 will continue to be a great year for tesla i sold some shares at 630 to raise some cash to pay for my model 3 and now it is 705 but i am glad to be an investor first and now a model 3 owner i drove around for last couple of days and just fell in love with the car its accelration feels you are pushed from behind its so quiet too its total new expereince you will have to drive one to feel ittesla is a great company and you should hold your shares for at least a decade no matter what others sayhappy new year

teslas valuation should not be like this this will make the stock very volatil if even small expectations arent met many investors will loose money because of this its legal but its near to manipulation

tslas sp may very well start to erode now with little to no end in sight why too much real competition with many leading ev makers reaching 100000 in volume in 2022 tsla 2023 numbers going forward are going to get revised down gm comes out as a surprise competitor whom may actually be better positioned than tesla with many partnerships building cheaper cars and they currently hold the title for a best selling ev in china now  nio has battery tech that seems to be better than teslas but teslas biggest problem is the 25000 sub car market you know the main part of the car market for the average consumer many ev manufactures are much closer to the goal of a mass market 25000  ev gm is emerging as major competition for tesla  nio xpeng li byd right now  gms stock will go up more than teslas this year and possibly more than those other ev manufacturers as well everyone wrote off ice manufactures but gm has been making incremental upgrades the whole time dont count out ford with the mache either as far as im concerned tesla will maintain its market share on the higher end evs but doesnt have a chance against ev competitors that already have sub 25000 evs tesla makes 4 vehicles out of  100  different types needed to replace ice keep in mind that teslas rise from 20172020 had a lot to do with traditional ice manufactures only pretending to compete because they believed tesla would falter well fast forward to now and we can see that it is a much different environment with everyone working on evs

not only am i predicting that this stock will get crushed soon but also the whole market especially nasdaq powell stated that they will hold rates near zero “unless inflation rises” it’s very clear the market has been getting pumped especially tesla due to stimulus inflation worries assets stocks go up due to the dollar being worth less and not due to fundamentals pes are at historic highs for multiple stocks do the fact check yourself simple google check of historic pes this includes forward pes now we’re between a rock and hard place if the dems get another stimulus approved that means a rise to inflation if inflation rises that means feds increase interest rates the last time they increased rate the nasdaq dropped 20 in 2018 if the dem stimulus doesn’t pass there is no more reason for worry of inflation and people move to cash especially due to overvaluation rip to fomos

teslas success has sown the seeds of its failure if tesla hadnt gone up 10 times from its price last march but instead just rose a modest 24 each year it might well have been an a successful track to increase in value 10 times by 2030but tesla soaring stock price has drawn in a huge amount of capital into the ev market the market always overdoes it when there is technological change creating a new product there will end up being excess capacity and all the ev makers will be fighting for market share and profits will be meager at best at least 12 of them will end up in bankruptcy this is the lesson of the past the 1960s had the color tv boom every household was going to buy one and they did and the tv makers went bust or were bought out by the japanesealuminum was the growth industry of the 1950s as lightweight aluminum was revolutionizing products the big three aluminum companies advertised heavily on tv as the metal of the future kaiser and reynolds have disappeared and alcoa is still around ceased being a growth stock in the 1960s

in the tesla chart there is a regular bearish divergence rd also pay attention to the broadening wedge as well so we predict that the price will decrease bottom of the wedge at 602ishafter that the price may rise once again and break the broadening wedge
tesla never sleeps buy before we hit 1000 next week
every time a minimum wage paid basher posts tesla goes up no wonder tesla has been going up 247 since ipo

teslas market cap is 40 of the next 10 automakers makers is that a bubble
elon is getting tired of this stock at this price he is getting worn out he will announce a good news but will give a warning along with that this will make him to focus on running the company rather than managing the stock price he now realize that he need to get detached from the stock market

added more around 440 today massive number of shares will be bought by funds and they arent the robinhood types who trade on a whim basically the float will be reduced into the foreseeable future then tesla will most likely exceed 500k deliveries by year endits insane not to be long now insaaaane

tesla will within several years have an extremely large installed base of 50 million or more along the way the company could by selling software and services to the owners of its vehicles become profitable enough to enable tesla stock to outperform the technology sector as a whole want more picks before they run check out httptradingstrategyscom
i wonder if a market maker is going to get carried out tomorrow there has been a lot of price manipulation using calls for the past few months and it looked like this was going to get pegged to 800 and there was over 130k volume in the 800 calls that expire tomorrow if this surges tomorrow like it did today it is going to make some a lot of money and someone is going to lose a lot i have been wondering if options could be the cause of the next financial crisis like credit default swaps were in 2008 the option volume has been insane lately especially on the call side
tsla crushing shorts massive gains made tsla to 800s next year i put some of my call profits into the shop february 19th calls too 
ev leaders1 apple new ev king 2 nio3 tesla tsla falling behind
tesla would take nearly 1600 years to make the amount of money the stock market has put into it
little history lesson just before the pandemic tsla was about 950 the pandemic hit and it dropped to around 350 then it slowly soared to around 2300 in august before the split i see this going down again just like before during this next pandemic wave and the whole cycle repeats itself after the split it was about 440 ps so that 400 was the 2300 split which was soaring so cut that in half maybe the 190

500000 vehicle sales at 70k each let’s just say is 35b plus some other business lines which are much smaller like storage spacex etc and this is trading close to 700b i know future growth is built into that but come ona value correction is in the near future
toyota expects to sell 16m vehicles in 2021 thats 21 times 750k which is tesla 2021 estimate yet tsla is worth 25x more than toyotai get that tsla is not only a car company and that someday their revenues may come from other sources but they are also not a pure software company they car sales portion of the company will never scale or have margins like a pure software company the economics of the car business will be more like toyotaeven if tsla price was cut in half it would be speculative at this price its rather insane just my opinion
closing price today
guy what do you say buy tsla when markets open or wait a bit 
the price on monday will go down once in the index funds the price will only change when someone buys or sells the fund only individual owners will move it and there are not enough to make much of a difference

well the numbers are in for the tsla short world “ marktomarket short losses for tesla totaled over 40 billion as it was “far and away the most unprofitable trade in 2020 and had the largest yearly loss we have seen historically”the bulls and the bears did battle in the pit with no holds barred no one knows how it will play out for 2021 but even with the competition finally gearing up for a piece of the bev market share it will challenge their resourcefulness in one important sense elon musk has already won his personal vision and purpose of acting as a catalyst for encouraging all players brought into being energy sustainable transportation the biggest vehicle manufacturing entities in the world cannot ignore their altered renewables future some will in their own fashion and innovation carry the industry forward and prosper the financial industry and its market’s own uniqueness will play their role since wall street’s early 19th century beginnings next year will certainly be exciting can hardly wait to see what lies ahead

since traders have been used to buying based on momentum and seeing stock go up every time it would be hard to break that habit in the postsp inclusion but as these momentum players find it harder and harder to make easy money they will have to give up at some point and become more realistic we will see stock going down and up and down again and as the fund buying dries up it will crash to its 5day ma of 450 starting next week trailing pe of 1160 forward pe of 152 and pricetosales ratio of 22 are astronomical numbers  even with sales growth of 3045

shorties be aware i think it was about 2 qtrs ago the delivery numbers was announced to be close to the target but it was also astronomical growth number when it comes to earnings announcement it smashed all previous records knocked the research analysts off their chairs and it had the majority of this run up which contributed to the split and sp inclusion now you have to read elon’s cue when you read this announcement from yesterday “this is a conservative estimate and this is not earning announcement” i tell you the earning announcement might pull a surprise with positive adjustment for final delivery numbers as well as earning record which smashes all expectations don’t underestimate the power of tsla mark this page

id love to share some thoughts on tsla as im a money manager and a long time trader yes both buy and sell of the stock im not going to offer advice just give some clarity bc as always it seems this message board is all over the placetodays drop in share price is nothing to be concerned about the security tsla is acting just as anyone who is knowledgable would tell you it had a tremendous run up over the past couple of weeks and some not anywhere near all people who held onto this are taking gains this does not mean this is the beginning of the apocalypse and anyone who is reading that should be warned its probably shorts who are littering this board yes nio is very attractive and will continue to grow but tsla is not just about selling cars as many of those ev companies are they also rake profits on a saas platform whereby anyone using their open source for their batteries and internal displays need to utilize so essentially in many cases the more ev cars on the road the better it is for tslaas for newsif you dont think there is anyone big news upcoming then you just dont know tsla i have had the opportunity to speak with elon musk in the past and in that one conversation he said that he prides himself on being able to move the stock price through a series of events some of which have been tweets obviously well in about a week or so you will be getting the deliveries for 2020 which will be announced before earnings report which is due at the end of january im 99 certain they blow past the 500k benchmark set forth and this will take the share price close to if not exceeding 700 of course weeks later there is the earnings report which if some other posters talking about option activity sinking the share price will end up being a catalyst soon thereafterall this to say stick to your guns with tsla if youre not a trader then dont try to do it shorts have lost an exorbitant amount of money and if you think truly that the sp is going to allow or permit a company to join that will tank and take the index with it then youre just plain foolishhope this helps
there we go another day and tsla at pe1600 adds another 4 already will tesla ever go down or it is a free money atm

you realize that this priced larger than the entire auto industry that also makes electric cars and actually has significant earnings what is actually funny is that musk became the richest man from a company that since its ipo has lost just under 10 billion dollars but theyve sold lots of stock so i guess thats what matters in todays market
markets can remain irrational longer than one can stay solvent most people know that tesla is overvalued but shorting it especially in the short term is risky if you are long or short make sure it is less than 5 of your portfolioremember that only 5 of day traders make money in long run and this crazy ev hype with small companies will end companies that will do with ev will likely be vw gm tm and others followed by tsla i would touch nio li etc with a 10 foot pole best would be buy and hold well diversified index funds vti etc

so tired of hearing the “tesla isn’t profitable without emission credits” baloney capex was over 3 billion in 2020 emission credits a few hundred million per quarter what that means is if tesla would stop pouring money into building the most efficient factories in the world they’d be wildly profitable now building the factories is the right move of course the emission argument is bunk

once this baby break 800 which it will happen soon it will run like a train to 1000 fueled by mega profits of quarter 4 on jan 21 hint  when stock hit 1000 that will be just 50 increase since the start of this year and all of us are predicting 600 increase this year alone which it will translate to 4200 after split but split will happen this year when we hit 2000 by august this year 51 which translate to more shares and more profits finally tesla will hit 1 trillion money cap at 3500 tag price after split and ofcourse elon will be the richest man in the world without any near competition

nice little rallypicked up another 15 shares  618will keep adding on the dips
slow and steady we can reach 1000 by the end of the yeari am holding long 35 years minimum i bought it around 520 waiting for a cheap entry point but it continue going up put 50k of my savings and waiting for a big pay out in 3 years now i am up 12kdont miss it i should have bought it when it was 180 but i though that it will go down and get a cheaper entry point kicking my self for no doing it at that time i will be up big time 130k
what happen to stock price after earning
this is kevins mum
i had 43 shares of tesla at one point and sold at 643 hoping for a dip that would allow me to buy 44 shares but it took off that is a sad feeling fortunately i invested in one of the chinese ev brands now i am the proud owner of 47 sharesthis stock has its bad days but when it takes off you only see its tail lights getting smaller and smaller and you are left eating the dust not a good idea to bet against tesla
best part about tsla shareholders is that theyre willing to pay anything for a share
must be strange buying at all time highs at unsustainable price levels thatll decline over time

going to get 900 boys and ladies 
so bulls if you really believe in tsla and the magic of elon musk as the way to make your fortune you ought to be hoping that the stock price goes down rather than up for if the stock price goes down you will be able to accumulate more of that magic stock at the lower pricewhen i invest in a stock because i see it as a great long term value and it shortly thereafter goes up i am disappointed because i am no longer to accumulate the stock while the price is cheapso dont input nasty motives to the bears as what they want is what you should want a lower stock pricethe only ones who ought to be cheering on higher prices are the pump and dumpsters they are the ones who tell you to never sell tsla because they want to be sure they can unload their shares when the those who have been fooled bid the price up the last thing they want is to be a long term tsla holder they are just in it for the quick buck with the old pump and dump
i dont get it but my portfolio does

excerpted from stanphyl capital’s october 2020 letter to investors discussing that there is no china growth story for teslawe remain short the biggest bubble in modern stock market history tesla inc tsla which currently has a fully diluted market cap of approximately 429 billion which is nearly 90 of those of toyota vw gm daimler bmw and ford combined despite unprofitably selling fewer than 500000 cars a year to their nearly 40 million the core points of our tesla short thesis are• tesla has no “moat” of any kind ie nothing meaningfully proprietary in terms of electric car technology while existing automakers—unlike tesla—have a decadeslong “experience moat” of knowing how to massproduce distribute and service highquality cars consistently and profitably as well as the ability to subsidize losses on electric cars with profits from their conventional cars• excluding sunsetting emission credit sales in 2020 tesla will again lose money as it has every year in its 17year existence• unit demand for tesla’s cars is only maintained via continual price cutting

wall street news is reporting the news as it is tesla didnt beat the numbers it just a bit shy less from its target it is not a exciting number to move the market to gap up the main reason is that the stock is way way ahead of the actual performance of the company by more than 5 years so just meeting its target is not convincing for bulls to take it furtherbut again no sane person would buy this stoc at 1400 pe with increased competition tesla cars becomes price sensitive meaning it is becoming to become like a commodity apple is going to be entering the market this is a 1000 pounds gorilla with a proven track record to reckon with
this news about a recall is old and already baked into tslas current price
it is just recommend to recall not mandatory to recall big difference

the strongest evidence of teslas accounting fraud elon musk telling people tesla was single digit weeks away from bankruptcy during the darkest days of the model 3 ramp  yet the official accounting as filed with the sec during that time never showed this condition according to what tesla filed with the sec the company always showed a year or more of solvency the books are being cooked

you have to ask yourself how much more gains are left after 100 to 200 gains in 12 months with much of those gains coming from pe multiple expansion also known as bubbles i know nobody wants to hear it but it’s the reality these gains this year are insane  you’re not going to get these kinds of gains every year aapl tsla zm nio snap amd mrna li pltr snow

investors business daily is a reliable resource for market news and analysis of stock charts ibd says that tesla has just experienced a climax run in trading just last week alone the stock is up 25 or 175 in the last 4 weeks its up from about 600 to 880 yes by definition thats a climax run which is doomed to correct substantially its not just the chart competition is and will be continue to be a major headwind  there are a lot of ev players in china and then you have vw and other us car companies theres absolutely no barrier to entry in this space tesla sells low margin cars and their profit is based on regulatory credits a correction to 650675 may be reasonable for starters

what if you started a company and created some process for cleaning all the air in the universe you issued a billion shares and then had a trading program that just kept bidding the shares higher 8 out of every 10 days and you told everyone there was really no limit on how much the company could make how long do you think you could run the scam
honk honk 7000 in a few years
i have seen this type of mania so many times i cannot count them all this stock is going to destroy so many people who recently came in maybe and i say maybe it is worth 300 a share thats a big correction i have said it and i say it again take your profits put them in the bank and pat yourself on the back but for heavens sake get out before you get destroyed it always happens with stocks like this a single stock that has a market capitalization so high that it would need to produce all of the cars sold on the planet and even then with an extended multiple to be worth what it is trading at and dont try to sell me on how its more than a car company because all they do is lose on all the other businesses and they will continue to lose there

the pe ratio is presently over 1200 to one how can tesla ever earn enough profit to bring that down from orbital altitude has anyone calculated how much net income that would require and what the sales might need to be to get there people may be holding huge gains on their shares right now but can tesla ever grow into the share price if so have you laid the numbers out in excel to see what it would look like a place where the earnings would have to be to create a 20 40 or 50 to one pe ratio at this price this looks for all the world as if net earnings dont matter as long as the dreams are alive and well good luck but when do you ever sell will this go up forever
when tesla shareholders find out what they invested inhttpsmediagiphycommediajuozjhlvm8d7ogiphygif
from seeking alphasummary • despite having less than 1 of global auto market share teslas market cap is now greater than that of all nonchinese automakers combined • tesla is clearly priced for massive growth yet half of its current products are aging and its development pipeline is sparse • the tesla semi new roadster and cybertruck have all been unveiled they are already facing significant competition from other automakers • even if teslas most ambitious assumptions were to play out as planned it would not be enough to justify the current valuation • tesla is already seeing declining market share in the most mature ev markets as this trend continues in 2021 the growth narrative will likely come under pressureat present tesla inc nasdaqtsla has just four electric vehicle models in active production the model s the model x the model 3 and the model y the model s and model x while extremely innovative at the time of their introduction are now aging platforms in decline leaving the model 3 and model y to carry ever more of the load while both have proven popular their addressable market is finite as evidenced by tesla’s having had to resort repeatedly to price cuts to keep demand from ebbing throughout 2020 even in the supposedly nearlimitless chinese marketceo elon musk has stated that tesla aims to produce 20 million vehicles per year by 2030 far beyond the wildest peak annual demand projections for the model 3 and model y combined to achieve its goal tesla will have to bring a host of new offerings to market over the course of the next decade yet the company has struggled of late to expand its product development pipeline as i discussed in a recent article the tesla semi which has yet to enter production more than three years after it was unveiled is one clear example of this issue
happy new year from uzbekistan thank you elon musk and all the people that work so hard in tesla for making me so happy this year all the best for everybody and their families wish you all the very best

cramer called apple to ask about their car project response  no comment
tesla will likely miss their guidance of 500k car deliveries in 2020 which they maintained since cv19but with most of ca back in purple they might be able to blame the renewed cv19 which wasnt probably gone by april as elon had tweeted
the world has changed folks i was about to make a searing post about watt insiders because they are padding themselves on the back while the 7year old company is making only 65k in revenue per quarter for expenditures of 35 million on ga and 4 million on rd i mean watt has real wireless charging technology how hard is it to make billions selling technology that actually charges through the air no way a sucky company like watt deserves a 82 million valuation i thought but then i remembered plug is 38 now i was going to buy plug at 10 because i had a feeling it was going to 100 but i changed my mind after seeing its revenue and debt vs its market cap garbage fcel is 12 now qs which hopes to see a small dime four years from now is 130 nndm which thankfully i stuck with has sold nothing but shares in the last four months to the tune of 05 billion and yet it is going up like crazyi realized what is going on the world has come full circle the honor system is back in play with the new generation as it should be many companies have found enormous success adopting the honor system amazon modeled its business around it you buy and return willynilly mcd has made it its culture it is inherently necessary in online commerce you accommodate it you succeed bigthe new generation have the honor system inherent in them and it is beginning to reflect in the stock market as it should be the stock market is the heart of the economy and society can no longer work without the honor system it can no longer be about the limiting dynamics of the exchange of goods and services but about the trust that within everyone is an inherent tendency to do good the stock market is now reflecting this by freely flowing capital to people to do their thing

people always want someth8ng to lasts forever especially if they made some money off it but don’t make the mistake of marrying yourself to a stock especially first movers or you will end up like shareholders of xerox pan am jc penny polaroid black berry phones sooner or later nothing lasts forever my guess is tesla will reign for 57 stocks peak in 12 years if not already stock price will never reach 1000 my guess
logic and common sense rule the investment i give you one take health care pe under 15 with the dividends you will sleep well under any circumstance there are a few that is very conservative and ceo is the great salesman ci i hold some positions on next month ex date dividends 4 dollars a year last year no dividends
not to say that it will go down the maximum a long could lose is it’s share price very improbable event the maximum a shortie could lose on the other hand is unlimited just think about that for a few why does anyone want to short if you don’t like tsla why not buy a stock a shorty likes i think the gambling mentality is rampant among the shorties and it is far more dangerous than actually invest

friday was another great day for telsa where it jumped 60b in market cap which ended a week in which its valuation grew 152b usd or in other words the value of boeing and ford combinedbut this isnt the largest bubble of a generation for as the robinhood boys know traditional models on tesla are all wrong looking at things such as teslas earnings revenues ebitda etc is for senior citizensinstead a better measure is a percentage of total annual us gdp of 21t usd because it is clearly the best company in the country tesla is the usa and the usa is teslafor uberbulls however how about a reasonable multiple of total global gdp of 142t say a modest 10x which brings you to a very defensible 14 quadrillion this is my favorite valuation and i think is very doable in the next five years because you know if tesla takes over the world

webbush analyst ev sale from 3 today to 10 to 2010today tesla market cap is equal to rest of auto industry and yet even in ev market they dont have even 25 market share at their 06 of overall market share this is just 20 of ev sale how in world he can justify such valuation when company cant generate genuine profit todaylets take their 2030 5 million scenariolets assume average car price is 45k todays dollar which no other car maker with similar or bigger size have today lets assume cost of car is 30k lets say operating cost 6k it is higher because tesla run all stuff themself and i am underestimating profit per car is 8k  i think with out insentive this likely 5k for sureso profit is 8k at best case scenario at 30m thats 24b profit so in otherword it trading 40 time 2030 earning today if tesla able to dominate brand name and ev evolution continue and not divert to hydrogen car which elon refuse as viable option even for semi and fsd without lidar is sufficient  elon continue his chant on expensive and not needed even while all other expert keep saying its absolutely nessasary for safe fsd and other automaker able to include in their offer that cost lower than tesla ev carnow question about their battery technology look like its already becoming outdated specially with qs testing result

classic bull traps jp morgan warned us all i took heed and sold last week understanding a bull trap a bull trap occurs when a trader or investor buys a security that breaks out above a resistance level—a common technical analysisbased strategy while many breakouts are followed by strong moves higher the security may quickly reverse direction these are known as bull traps because traders and investors who bought the breakout are trapped in the trade

i would like to make a new years toast to the shorts thank you thank you thank you
my thesis on tesla for the next two months my opinion do your own research blah blah blahimho tesla will be dropping this week and continue dropping the week following christmas my reasoning besides hedge funds front running sp inclusion is that there will be some hedge funds mutual funds and also some large investors that may want to book their profits this year under the current tax rate for fear of president elect biden raising taxes next year so as you know those sellers will have to wait 30 days if they want to repurchase shares or it becomes a wash sale therefore i believe share price could remain depressed at least until the last week of january now an interesting variable in this thesis is that the more shares sold for those reasons the more shares they are likely to be repurchasing in other words the lower the drop the higher the pop starting the last week of january which btw if tesla remains true to form q4 and full year earnings will be announced the last wednesday of the month on january 27th i also believe tesla will once again obliterate wall street estimates and believe we could break through 1000 before the end of february

so many people analysts included have been saying tesla is a sell since the price was 100 pre split lol at the end of the day it comes down to whether the people like the company tesla is popular it does well so the the price has increased exponentially

whats going on with teslas proprietary driving computer and the industrial robotics company that tesla bought in germany and repurposed to work for tesla computer vision and airobotics have a massive future by themselves tesla by now has more expertise in this area than other car or most manufacturing companies and through the robotics company they own could be a very consequential player in that space computer vision sensor fusion and neural netsai have an impressive future and tesla could be a formidable competitor both in the tech and capital requirements other companies in that space are small specialist and not robot companies too i dont know if this is part of teslas overall value or not but it should be it would be surprising if they didnt exploit this tech themselves or license it for nonvehicle useswe read that spacexs manned capsules now dock autonomously at the iss have we read anything about that system are they using any tesla fsd ip like a hardened version of the tesla computer i suspect that nasa might insist on a more conventional approach presently than trained neural nets for this purpose but it would not be surprising if they used some of teslas vision ip of course there are other approaches entirely

shorting this wall street ponzi scheme is financial suicideit has been the closest bet to a sure thing as i have seen in 23 years of trading the way wall street has made billions on it has been pure genius the recipe is simple great story under promise over deliver create ongoing short squeezes and have bought and paid for analysts keep upgrading their price targets so wall st can make massive banking fees for each raise as for the analysts particularly ives who went to school with he can sell ice to an eskimo noone can articulate the  valuation story better than him he could convince someone that oj is innocent this ponzi scheme will not end until either the fed or bond vigilantes make an attempt to protect the currency with interest rates hitting a point that matters what bothers me is all the posts from retail shorts who keep fighting this and losing real money my advice is to stop fighting its a rigged game the fix is in to the longs particularly elon congrats and a job well done happy trading

this stock doesnt depend on math or how many cars or anything else tesla delivers it depends on belief the stock will only crash when people stop beleaving it can go down very fast as most people dont understand how it works they are unsure single thing can pop everything up one by one if a big piece would go down people would go in anxiety mode everything would depend on how much you still believe if you dont you would die the momment this would go down a large piece the momment when most people will stop believing in this this stock will crash but if people still believe in the safe high tech zero emission future it wont crash you have to understand that years and years younger generations been exposed to climate change food additives air pollution and everything else to the point where everyone worries so much about their health that believing in a company like tesla all the news that elon says how he says takes away people minds out of years and years anxiety corona virus is a good thing for a company likes this too people live in their own heads most of the time worrying about everything this company is like miracle for them its a problem soliution that they had for a long time its a wishfull thinking until musk will say everything will be allright people will believe that because they had to you want to believe that too another thing is youtube more and more people are sharing musk and his companies news so more people are getting into this everyday it will grow little by little as more people are getting exposed to what musk and tesla is memes are combined to reach out young audiences as they are more likely to join tesla becouse of the worries and fears they already have as i wrote prior to this world is in danger and musk looks like the one who could save everyone even if he cant it doesnt matter kids will be already exposed to this using memes musk is not stupid everything he does is pure live advertising the momment when he smoked weed its all about getting more and more people into this smoking weed looks a cool thing to younger audiences as well as other pot smokers they natturaly want to be a fallower as he looks like one of them everything about this company is more about human psychology and emotions not about numbers and revenue numbers do affect everything but as long as this company just down fall by messing up something very bad it will only go up if you dont believe me look up to a elon musk hall of fame video watch it till the end the way he cares and almost cries the way he messed up at the beggining of the journey with rockets 3 fails he spent his own money and so on watch yourself how do you feel after watching video like this and imagine how a kid feels when he sees something like this its a dream emotions that flow he looks like real hero even if he is not that i dont know i can only assume he is a good gay anyway i hope it may help someone to just to think how belief works and what can it do other companies never worked on a vision and belief before as good as elon does thats why this company is worth more then it should be
with bidon winning the election and his love for renewable power and the entire world predicted to be 90 100 run off renewable energy by 2050 i think tesla is miles ahead of the game on this tech sure people might have other great ideas but tesla will always be the big dog and it’s definitely not going anywhere anytime soon

i love this stock
new to tsla what does it usually do after earnings
yeah someone has to hold the bag seriously every metric you people use to pump this trash is so wrong the only reason this stock continues to go up is because of continual short squeezes thats the reality
forget the stock price fundamentally tesla is desperately trying to look like they arent about to go bankrupt they already have more debt than cash and with the zev credits running dry everyone who knows something about finance knows they can never turn a profit without environmental regulatory credits that they can sell to toyota with nobody buying zev credits in the near future they will dig themselves into a deeper hole of debt sure they will do a public offering and raise money the way a good old ponzi does it but in the end it wont offset the fact that they are a business without a product that has caught on with anyone their offerings are worthless and so too will the stock be in a few years
tesla is the dominate ev company and will remain so

this company part of sp now so they better not miss these targets as a reminder to bulls musk said in 2016 that by 2020 we will be producing 1 million cars and and reality is barely making to half of that mark it seems all along musk trying to burn shorts by setting these unattainable goals and giving false promises to investors of tsla over last year or so everyone on winning side investors traders got used to this bubble but one day reality will hit and its gonna be bad research telling by 2024 there will be just 10 of car volume will be ev and not that all will be tsla and there is some serious competition out there in that space tsla has few ip blocks which has kept them ahead in this tech sector  ev car autonomous driving softwarehardware and battery technology for each of this ip block there are some serious competitors and for me interesting thing is they have their own designarchitecture and not just copying what tsla doing typically competition copies leader and catch up with them sooner or letter example intel irbot but interestingly tesla competitors surely gonna distinguish themselves by 2024 or before that each ip block will be well developed there will 2 to 3 decent options and it wont take long for companies like toyota honda gm ford may be apple to integrate and put some great product out there for consumers to make matter worse for tsla car sales are going to be significantly down in coming few years 30 there are all kinds of projections which indicates 30 of population will never return to office work and that should directly impact car sales so 10 of ev car volume by 2024 will be just 7 and out of 7 even is mush gets 70 that will be just 5 of total ev cars for tsla so everyone make money as long as you can so that total gains surpass that big loss going to come soon good luck

200 day moving average is still under 400share an indication of how fast this stock has climbedits also relevant to musks 2018 option grant he as a way to go to earning all of the 12 option grants but it looks likely he will soon have earned the first 8 the 8th requires annualized adjusted ebitda of 140 billion theres a chance he will have that award with board certification after the 4th quarter earnings releaseeven if the stock drops from here the past momentum makes it likely tsla will soon all of the market cap requirements for future awards as the top level is only 650 billion

if musk is rational he will release another block of shares prior to sp inclusion i mean why should he let speculators pump and then dump it how does that benefit him some shareholders win and some lose but that does not benefit him in any way it would be much better for the company if he were the one to dump it by releasing another 5b or 10b on new shares

all car makers are producing evs now i dont see why just tesla should be valued x20 compared to others they all have their own fsdai
tsla addressable market is not automotive only its the entire planet this is around 100t to 200t and maybe more even even if tsla can get 2 of this market its valuation is around 2 to 4t easily that implies a stock price of around 6k to 7k by end of this year

theres reason to be positive on tesla as a company but not silly positive with the current stock pricing 1 tesla  23x ford  13x general motors  8x volkswagen  4x toyota volkswagen and toyota generate the most revenue of all automobile manufacturers ford and gm are among the top seven tesla is does not make the list of the top 20 peugeot doesif we cut teslas stock price in half its still very optimistic at 400share it would be 12x ford  6x general motors  4x volkswagen  2x toyota toyota revenues and earnings are 10x that of tesla how long will it take for tesla to catch up to toyota and be worth even 1x as muchanother example tesla brings in 12 of the revenue and earnings of peugeot peugeots market cap is 23b a fair valuation for tesla would appear to be 12b but ok lets give tesla a higher valuation for being innovative and possibly opening up new markets but this is speculative what multiple of a fair valuation makes sense twice as much three times as much certainly not 80 times as much

here is the upgrade noticeupdated  january 5 2021 432 pm estmorgan stanley analyst adam jonas raised the price target on tesla nasdaq tsla to a street high 81000 from 54000 while maintaining an overweight rating the firm set a bull case of 1232jonas raised 2030 volume to 52 million units versus 38 million unitsthe analyst comments while the range of outcomes is admittedly high the market has ‘chosen’ to ascribe a higher level of discounted value to tesla than that typically discounted for its peers despite the extraordinary run in the share price we continue to believe that tesla can outperform vs our sector in 2021 in our opinion tesla is still the best positioned company in evs and avs under our coverage due to its people its technology business model and access to capital furthermore it is important to note that the company has no entanglement with the environmental liabilities that burden its legacy competition put it all together and we believe teslas business model can unlock recurring mobility services revenue faster and more profitably than the competition we struggle to find a more innovative company with the ability to execute against the high degree of difficulty inherent in sustainable transportation and energy at scale we reckon its a rather short list

what do you think will happen next week as 80 billion worth of tesla stock will have to be bought by index investors before friday i dont think the stock will fall next week probably some up and down but not a fall but its my personal opinion i hear mixed opinions here and there some are saying tesla is overvalued or a hype of course it is but the market stock is betting for the future elon musk keeps building surprising he aggressively wants to write a part of our tomorrow i think the electric transport is coming a little bit faster because of him thats maybe also why people want to invest in tesla hes not the only visionary man in the world however hes very committed

with a pe ratio of over 1500 what is going to happen when the people buying this stock suddenly realize it is only worth pennies on the dollar don’t get me wrong i like this company and what they stand for and may even buy one of their cars in the coming years but elon has convinced thousands of people to pay a fortune for this stock for a company that is not making money and it will be 10 years before the stock could be worth what is currently selling for by the way if you own this stock i have a wonderful bridge in new york you may be interested in buying

any thoughts on when the socialists will stop giving out fake money or better when the world stops accepting the us dollar fake money should start tracking the value of a share of tesla in ounces of gold will give a much better picture of the real value of tesla

tesla is much better than bitcoin
hello alli am new here and am a very armature investor but over the past year i have made great gains in my portfolio after watching it going no where tesla is one of my winners held off on investing in them for years i thought ev who wants a quiet running car when they they can hear and love the growl of an ice vehicle well apparently many do i strongly think they well grow rapidly as we all know they are much more than ev cars and trucks i am long with tsla but who knows may sell off some profit only should they go above 1k a share currently holding 350 share post split started buy a few here a few back in may i there may be a small pull back here and there but in the long  its going to be fully forward do to the tech they have that will be used outside the ev market as well so many just dont get it that tsla is tech software and hardware i do think it will split again in 2021 just for the fact of how ambitious musk is and all the projects and dreams he has another split will give them the capital to fund those dreams and ideas and continue to grow in all directionshave a great day and happy new yearthat is all
the pe is only 1600 a good value
tesla to produce 800 million carspe is often used as a realistic barometer of a companies value with an auto producer that pe could be extended to cars produced for example toyota produced 88 million cars last year to achieve earnings their pe is 921 this indicates that toyota needs to produce 88 million cars times 921 years of earnings to meet market cap this total is 81480000 vehiclestesla produced 500000 cars last year their pe is 1628 and this is not a fully diluted pe multiply the two and the total is 814 million cars fully diluted and this number nears 900 million there is not enough raw material capacity to achieve this in the next 10 years world auto production in 2019 was 91786861 tesla at their present margin ratios which would include the sale of regulatory credits would need to sell every car in the world for 10 years to have a pe similar to toyota the tesla market cap is absurd at best buy it now and you will pay a hefty price in the next few years
buying tesla  apple shares for my portfolios has been the best decision ive made in my life second best decision applying to graduate school then finishing my mba last august third best decision getting rid of my now exwife
once a stock such as tsla reaches a certain price and maintains that price range for a long time duration is debatable that price range becomes its real value in the minds of investors analysts downgrade or lower price target would do little to change that i frankly dont see tsla going below 600 forever if it remains above 600 for about 2 months
750 after hours 
keep buying folks  theres no limit for a good company like in 1929

i can say that nobody is going to buy at this price insiders are selling to common folks robinhooder those are the people that will hold the bag if you are saying institutions are buying think about this every year they would want to make a profit to show investors how good they are they need this stock to go down substantially in order to make good profits for 2021 you have been warn and if you look at charts everything is overbought overvalued if you swing trade then probably fine but if you going to hold the bag by all means do as you wish

even shortsbears are buying tesla right now
tesla correction coming tomorrow no more big news now that it is on the sp it will be scrutinised heavily it does not have any fundamentals worth its price even if everything works perfectly telsa would have to own the auto market and sell nearly every car on the planet for the current price to be worth it batteries insurance solar panels self driving technology you have all been spouting out as the reason for the valuation which are all done by other companies tesla again would have to have a monopoly on the market in all those for it to be close to this price tesla is a good company dont get me wrong but it is not worth anything close to what its trading at the price of 695 is for 2030 with total global domination
this is legal fraud why in the world its allowed to drive stocks to irrational prices so that noone can predict or calculate anything they turn economy into casino and the bank always wins this hurts stock market this will make many people loose money the shorts but also people who are really investing  in that moment when the bubble pops what should people do with their money in a time without interest rates there is no alternative to stocks and this is the place for fraud and no one cares supported by fed and politics  sad world and these tesla fans dont know what is really happening they are just a playing ball of wallstreet sad  sad sad
lol easy money here
elon and musk are going to become verbs 
the real problem is that most people do not understand numbers and they do not understand probability you can just about make a case for amazon facebook and google these trillion dollar companies have a kind of monopoly in the world but tesla a valuation of more than 800 billion for a company that produces 500000 cars a year 800 bn is roughly one third of the gnp of the united kingdom it is more than 60 times the value of renault with 800 billion you can buy every single uk bank hsbc lloyds barclays nat west and guess what you will have only spent about 25 of the value of tesla

what tesla really needs to do to reignite its growth engine is to buy this fastgrowing semiconductor company that has products with high demand made by cuttingedge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level making it a steal and great fit for tesla and a great contribution to the us even if tesla just got 25 ownership of the company it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and topnotch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this companys major moves in the future it would be similar to american companies and institutions ownership in asml one of the most important semiconductor company in the worldrumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global hightech gem this small super tech may double in price in a swift it already has since we started covering it one year ago closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon read our last analysis and you’ll seehttpsseekingalphacominstablog40777835gathoncapital5529995unitedstateislosinggoldenopportunitytobemajorshareholderofworldsbesttechcompanyhttpsseekingalphacominstablog40777835gathoncapital5519600biginvestorsswarmnvidiageofchinaafterastonishingprofitgrowthinq2andq3httpsseekingalphacominstablog40777835gathoncapital5495008gequalcommtiappleshouldacquiregeofchinafordirtcheappricenowhttpsseekingalphacominstablog40777835gathoncapital5490372geofchinaenjoyedstrongprofitandgrowthamidcoronavirusoutbreak

why no bulls dare to answer where is the king of combustion engine market cap today because they know whether you are king or not cars valuations cant be so highalso many said that ev can decrease pollution do you all know that coal are used to make electric the more electric this cars uses the more coal will be burn therefore more pollution elon should solve the root first coal burning not carsso bullswhen you say we bashers have no pointsi give you these 2 points to counteri dont think you can because that is the reality
looks like the market cap is going for 785 billion
low volume move up todayhigh volume dump tomorrow
to summarise tesla diluted their business by 08 by selling 7something million shares in return for 5billion to help accelerate there lead in multiple fieldson 1221 117million shares will have been bought by the sp500 indexthen benchmark funds which track the sp500 will probably buy 100 million sharesanyone else think that the 7million shares sold for 5billion is a small drop in the ocean i certainly do now is the time to make money and not listen to the select few muppets on this board good luck
i would buy before earnings call this will have strong guidance

cowen analyst jeffrey osborne is jumping on the bandwagon by expecting a strong end to the year for tesla in a tuesday note osborne raised his price target for tesla stock ticker tsla to 380 from 300 he points to positive december delivery trends in the us and europe and now forecasts 181500 fourthquarter deliveries up from his prior estimate of 156500 analysts polled by factset forecast deliveries at 174000 for the quarter “data from countries with realtime registration data in europe and our own checks domestically suggest that tesla is having a strong close” to the year osborne wrote “which was enabled by numerous exports from both fremont and shanghai to zeebrugge oslo and bremen in november”

every time tesla goes up more than 3 now they are adding more in market cap then they do in annual revenue itd be like ford adding 130 billion in market cap please let that sink in i understand theyre not just a car company but until their financials resemble something else this company is wildly overvalued by even the most positive outlook
amazing that people would still bet against this stock if you cant beat em join em i did back in the 400s i was late to the game but still a fantastic profit in short time who really thinks that this stock wont continue upward
a little error in my last post tesla share holders have to love panasonic pcrfy they own over 5b in tesla stock httpsirteslacomstaticfiles012cf3208f264275a8aff2f8d62d5871text2d2d they have a long term contract to supply them batteries and they also have a contract to supply toyota and other ev makers which will be even bigger they will have a huge jump on their next earnings and will be announcing new battery technology on jan 11 at ces onlineget is before its too late httpsfinanceyahoocomquotepcrfyppcrfy
deutsche bank survey says bitcoin and tsla would more likely halve than doublei guess bitcoin but many shorts literally gave up shorting tsla so when thinking about tslas sp halving it’s not incorporating the absence of discouraged short sellers who know it’s impossible to short tslahowever it’s too much of a wishful thought tsla hypothetically dropping 25 would cause buyers flock not to mention 2021 to 2030 is a very ev friendly decade

i think the more ideal place to short is around 675 or higher with so much momentum i would have assumed it would get there then elon came in and did his thing he let some of the air out for all we know he could sell 5b more every 30 days i think dec 21 is an obvious sell the news location forced buying for a brief moment and then it is over what is left to hold it up at that point the only question is will it sell off before then the irrational exuberance on this board is truly a sight to behold this stock is well overpriced httpsseekingalphacomarticle4392768addingteslatosandp500wasbadideainseptemberevenworsenow

tesla hasnt had any real completion the mainstream automakers didnt take electric vehicles seriously for a decade now they see the success and sales tesla has starting having after a decade of struggle and are coming out with their own electric vehicle lineups starting in 2021 that will be the real test for tesla and should lead to more competitive vehicle prices
false narrative everyone if you all are believing that there is going to be some sort of mad rush for shares next week you are about to be sorely mistaken first off the majority of the investment funds have already compiled most of the shares needed they will book huge gains when they then move the shares to the holders of their sp 500 index funds the holders of sp 500 index funds will then take on all the downside risk plus all you individual retail investors it could get ugly everybodylock in your gains
sky is the limit for thisas its not trading by fundamentals but something else i hope this wont crash
keep buying tesla will soar 
will the tsla bubble ever close in red again or it is a no risk free money atm
tesla has scheduled a battery  powertrain investor day in 2020 and some suspect that this will be the occasion for a momentous announcement elon musk has hinted that there are a couple of new techrelated goodies in the pipeline and some teslawatchers believe based on the prices announced for the cybertruck and model y that tesla could be sitting on a substantial battery advance tesla’s vehicles already have enough range and way more than enough performance to satisfy most buyers so any increase in battery capacity could translate to lower prices  and many more potential sales

when musk speaks of a battery company rivaling the auto division youre now looking at two big companies in one for starters the million mile battery will be the next bomb hell drop hopefully out of the blue with no prior warning to shorts the guy is planning on being a cornerstone battery supplier to all brands in the future he knows well that the battery will be as important as the combustion engine is now hes getting in on that ground floor and likely has the million mile tech already

tesla is the only stock that i know of where you can buy at the highs and still get paid i bought some last night at 750 very reluctantly as the stock is overbloated but i had some short calls and i have to keep my deltas approximately neutral then i bought some more just now at 770 for the same reason and will likely get paid again i should not be getting paid but i have been getting paid it wont last i think i am going to close the calls and the stock this thing is a hot potato too much risk this thing could get crushed in a millisecond the next most obvious catalyst for a down move is elon announcing another secondary offering as he increases his cash position of course this thing doesnt really need a catalyst to sell off all it needs is a little puff of wind
lol nio is up1380 and tesla is up by 075
this is such a simple clue to how overvalued this stock is never in my life 64 years old and an investor for 45 could i have ever imagined 10 youtube channels of young kids touting the bull case on a single stock it have become a church it is ludicrous none of them have a single bit of understanding of how many cars can actually be sold around the world the margins in auto the fact that soon the auto demand will begin dropping due to ride sharing and self driving cars and the longevity of ev cars this will be something to watch good luck kids soon the grown ups will take over
fun fact tsla market value is 1300 greater than bmw while tesla sales are 70 lower than bmwthe us stock market is a fraudulent system
you really want to see teslas stock go to the moon just have them split the stock to 101 and alal of the people who couldnt buy in because of todays prices will be lining up to buy tesla at below 100 a share they would hit 3 trillion by the end of the year

shorts just got 69 and 420 by elon lol closing price 69420 roughly done 
it almost seems unfair i mean look at the money us longs have made truly life changing stuff and by all accounts tesla is just in the infancy of their true potential
i will be so happy when elon is no longer a billionaire this thing is going to tank hard the only question is how many years in jail will elon serve who will serve more years him or elizabeth holmes of theranos those two creeps have way too much in common
shorts this morning getting margin called
the 695 high was pretty much artificial except to those who actually paid that price and you thought money managers were brilliant the real closing price was 66499 looking at it from that point of view we made a new all time hight today
tesla couldnt keep up with the market today the institutions know something and its crazy retail thats propping up this sideways action meanwhile the institutions are offloading my guess is earnings are going to be a big miss credits were frontloaded in prior quarters and theyre less and less necessary meanwhile costs are going up with all of the factory construction and design work i can only imagine the overtime engineers must be putting in to make the exoskeleton cybertruck compliant because thats what musk demands
777 tomorrow
see the buying action starting to fadesee you in the 600s in a few weeksway overbought and it is hitting an exhaustion point
anybody sitting in this stock right now expecting to see a profit in the next 23 years is a tool
premarket is unreliable it will drop like a rock when the market opens
i wouldnt bet on a correction anytime soon there is enough frns being printed to keep this going higher for a long time tsla is no longer a company or a stockit is an idea just like btc valuations mean nothing at this point and the stock price is just a number this is a daytrader and grifters dream what is the real value of tsla who knows at this pointbut right now the market does not care timing a correction is a fools errand

how many times have the haters reset the game just to be right onceyes obviously tsla is going to drop 10 20 30 from some point that doesnt make you right when youve been saying it for the last year or two
the volume is slowly picking up let’s see whether it goes up at the end of the day
 gms current bankruptcy is expected to cost us taxpayers a whopping 10 bln    its expected the taxpayers will refuse to bail out the failing automaker once again
if tsla had a superior product like apple it would not have to be priced the lowestpricing it the lowest is not the right call for the long termelon is only chasing numbers but it does not help the company’s in the long run 
chinese evmaker nio inc for example often called the biggest rival of industry frontrunner tsla inc in that country now commands a market capitalization greater than gmanalysts now say that investors may have underestimated gm’s potential including its joint ventures battery technology and possible cost savings from a restructuring in north americaboomberg

i admire from afar would never buy or short love the daily price action and the message board is priceless
its not a nkla or a tsla or a nio but its traded in the us ovtc and germany and tsx dynacert dyato is on a tear right nowjim payne president and ceo discussed how the company integrated longevity into the corporate strategy noting this is a global solution to reduce pollution that works now this is technology that were not thinking we can do or hoping we can do its done its proven worldwide along with that you look at all the patents that weve got just last week i was talking to an analyst and he was saying you know jim that one worldwide pattern youve got on the means and methods of monitoring and monetizing carbon credits with an internal combustion engine thats a trillion dollars in itself should see a 50 gain over the next few days
im long tsla but dont want to lose all my gains whats a good stop 600 620

800 seems like real possibility end of the year
i wonder in which year nio will enter india 2030 
i will not be surprised at a 625 going into sp and a sharp pull back going into year end but then we climb into 700’s year end numbers are gonna be great
tsla good time to buy now or wait to fall  please advise
people buying on elon promise that he will have his magic battery  to me its evolutionary and based on presentation i am almost certain it will not meet cost goal density goal which i think more important is also not easy to achieve and there is risk that other have viable revolutionary solid state battery while tesla focus on evolution which isnt really bad for tesla given price likely prohibitly high but if that happen tesla stock will consider old tech  valued like other car company in other word at 3040b value
we going high tomorrow boys and girls stay long 2021 is year of tesla s and p inclusion will poor billions in cyber truck coming this year and full self drive and tesla has 20 billion to expand and execute tesla is going to 800 get your jet packs
tesla is the company of the year very easily no competition
so let me get this rightonce tesla is included in the sp500 index on dec 21 all funds have to buy approx 132000000 shares 80billion  60600 so that they can track the index so technically speaking the price of tesla should spike to like 800 900 1000maybe 1200
why do investors keep saying tesla’s pe ratio is 1400 pe ratios are based on full years earnings let’s wait until the 4th quarter earnings are added in to get the true trailing pe ratio really we should be looking at the forward pe ratios for growth companies this is where the shorts fall short lol
compare to the faangs apple is actually expensive considering the market cap amazon is a massive bubble facebook survives on ad revenue netflix  limited growth potential google  not bad but watch out for competition with amzn and microsoft
only elon muskyou need to work extra hard for same pay in 4th quarter so we can hit the numbers i promised good job we made all the models s and xs we can sell so youll need to take time off some without pay and of those days when you are not getting paid we encourage you to volunteer to help deliver cars this is coming from a dude whose personal wealth increase to 12 figures in 2020 1xx00000000000 happy holidays
buy 1222021 660 strike puts tomorrow on sale accumulate 10 contracts i’ll probably hit this one unless this goes to 1000 by next week which it might for no reason whatsoever
shorts losing their sanity right now
tsla option expire 600 call today once hit 600 go down to 580 faster just waiting for sell call option today you can make money
1500 by july 4th god bless america and tsla
fan bois unite 5 trillion by 2025 full self driving a pony for everyone
so not to be outdone by that other company that is up 9 today when is tesla day
watching the shorts and tesla haters get crushed this year has been so pleasant mmmmlike a fine glass of red wine and some dark chocolate delicious 
many great  wonderful things will occur for this company in the days to come the price will increase
there’s absolutely no reason tsla only has a market cap of 750b while aapl is over 2t this is going parabolic in the next month easily topping 1000 in february super bullish on this company and on elon
1000 in three monthsi am bullish on tsla for its leading edge on ev markets
you better buy the dip boys
in tesla we trust
all this analyst rating and price target totally meaninglessonly reason stock move so much because those manipulator need news to excite their following herd their game is gone beyond doubt that those analyst media newly world reachest man and manipulators all working to gather normally consider insider trading but today when sec and doj dont even look so it consider genius strategyall those money retail invested and at risk like ark has billions in tesla is huge problem what we really need is regulation on funds on what valuation they can invest based on sizeso its ok to buy 1000 pe stock at 1b market cap but not even 100 pe stock at 1t market cap size to market ratio can apply as bigger it go there is large limitation on performing betteryou can trade bitcoin at 1m does not mean bitcoin should really worth that much if usa govt crack down on bitcoin trading this can go from 1m to 1 cent in record time
i have extended my short exposure massivlythe bubble actually stops and we will see abutting never seen at wallstreettesla to produce 800 million carspe is often used as a realistic barometer of a companies value with an auto producer that pe could be extended to cars produced for example toyota produced 88 million cars last year to achieve earnings their pe is 921 this indicates that toyota needs to produce 88 million cars times 921 years of earnings to meet market cap this total is 81480000 vehiclestesla produced 500000 cars last year their pe is 1628 and this is not a fully diluted pe multiply the two and the total is 814 million cars fully diluted and this number nears 900 million there is not enough raw material capacity to achieve this in the next 10 years world auto production in 2019 was 91786861 tesla at their present margin ratios which would include the sale of regulatory credits would need to sell every car in the world for 10 years to have a pe similar to toyota the tesla market cap is absurd at best buy it now and you will pay a hefty price in the next few years
tesla will soar again to pre split levels deal with it or move on

teslas current valuation is pricing in perfection untill 2027 in which growth rate continues or accelerates from previous levels tesla will offer robot taxi tesla will have a cure for alzheimer tesla will make own batteries tesla will use neurolink for other applications tesla will be basically the only ev car without too much competition to my personal opinion it is trading at a high risk low reward level
unit sales are up about 37 from last year 2019  367500  2020 500000 yet the stock is up 700 at that rate the stock would be 300000000 per share by the time they had 1m unit sales in a year i think it is a little ahead of itself ha

news flash the entire world does not own 3 tesla vehicles and even that would not justify this valuation this is not a game you are playing here many here will get seriously hurt financially buying up here
tesla is buy because its only 1t valuation company that wont impacted by biden taxreason simple it does not make real profit
congrats to all who made a killing on tesla what concerns me the most about this stock and the current market in general is younger investors have never had to suffer with a bad market sure the market temporarily dropped with covid but it came right back up when tesla does go down they simply buy more because lately its always gone back up the problem will come when the folks keep buying on the dip and it never rebounds massive short squeeze happing right now with and even bigger bubble to follow if you made a killing take some profits dont know when the tesla bubble will burst but it will at some point way to many players getting into the game even all the business channels are scratching their head on the valuation of this one
will be interesting to see how this this stock will do if there is 14 split now shorts will be happy and so is jpm
shorts going to have a rough day
i think apple would be great at building cars like what they did with mp3 players build it little shinier and curvier and call it icarits called an ipodtheyre going to make it sound like they invented it and theyre going to claim it will improve your productivity and will make your life and health betterit will also have wheelsthey will most likely put in a underpowered motor and small battery and try to convince their fans about how much better it actually islol

bottom line  these analysts don’t know any more than we do they simply work for the benefit of their firms

it is probably like this most sp 500 index funds are in large mutual fund families with a lot of funds that are not indexed so they had their non index funds buy shares and on yesterday they transfered them directly between funds so now they are now set then you had hedge funds that have no index funds and they bought shares with the intention to sell yesterday for the short term play and they are dumping them on the open market those are the shares driving the price down because they do not have an index fund to transfer them to my guess is more tesla shares than were needed to add tesla to the index funds were bought up to the inclusion now they are looking for buyers to sell to because they dont want to own an over valued stock long term but it may take them a while to get out too many shares to sell at one time they need to sell slow enough so that the price does not collapse

i wish i owned this stock it never seems to stop going up and up regardless of anything congrats to all longs and bulls here maybe ill buy some shares although at this point it seems very expensive any comments
my short patience with rolling calls has finally paid off for all the longs belive it or not i am sorry this is happening not because you are losing moneythat is just part of this game  we all have done that and will continue to do it if we keep playing markets no what i am sorry for is that you continue to fall for all of this progressive left win bs in everything not just tesla read a real book on the history of the left as it is defined today everything they touch turn toi total disaster not a high 5 not a large amounteverything like all things progressive tesla was totally dependent on government for not only financing but also penalizing the competition  passing laws and regulations to shut out the truth so their ideas can survive maybe solar and evs will make sense one day but unfortunately by having dems and progressive forcing it long before it was ever ready or even wanted we probably moved back the possibility of it by 30 years read the road to serfdom by fa hyeck learn from this or continue to go down the road to serfdom that the left always leads you to

guys lets just think about this for a second retail does not have the ability to move tsla institutions are loading up on shares especially those that are benchmarked to the sp 500 before inclusion this does not include the hundreds of millions in shares that need to be permanently taken off the table by the sp 500 this locks up the probably 1220 of the float of which 53 of the float is already owned by instituions 20 owned by elon  team leaving the remaining 27 in retails hands or around 270 million assuming a billion shares funds need to lock up 120 million200 million shares in the coming days and they have to buy this stock do not sell hodl this also means the float will be much more illiquid postinclusion so there will likely not be a significant drop likes some people are expecting

spak admits that now that tesla stock has run up nearly seven times in price its new price is likely to be something of a selffulfilling prophecy giving tesla the financial firepower to essentially buy for itself the valuation it thinks it deserveshow does that workour biggest miss was how tsla can take advantage of its stock price to raise capital inexpensively and fund capacity outlays and growth explains spak with teslas current elevated stock price the company is able to both avoid taking on debt and still raise massive amounts of cash through minimal stock issuances that dont dilute existing shareholders much at alltesla can then take that cash and invest it in buying up competitors and new technology and in capacity additions ie new factories enabling it to rapidly expand production and produce more cars and thus collect more revenue

evidence that autopilot is frauda new 4d radar with twice the range so tesla is figuring out that there old hardware will not work we all knew that 3 billion miles of data and the car get around a simple roundabout consider that they have been charging 10000 for full self driving and they know the hardware is insufficient i am not sure how that would be explained in court imagine the cost of retrofitting every car since 2016 they will never do it i am going to speculate that fsd is 5 years away not just for tesla but everyone too much liability for producers to assume they will just pray that the old cars find their way to the junk heap httpselectrekco20210113teslamillimeterwaveradarelectriccars

keep an eye on the message board chatter from the tesla cultists it’ll start with “this is a healthy correction” and then “the gap had to be filled before the next leg up to 1000 a share” followed by “this is a short attack the stock is too cheap at 650 hang on to your shares” then “i’m in it for the long term thanks for the cheap shares at 500 shorts” next up “elon musk just tweeted about opening tesla stores on mars this should send the stock back up to 300 in a big hurry” coming up a few weeks later “100 a share this is absurd the future cybertruck spare parts business alone is worth that” until we get to the final post”that’ll teach me to gamble on robinhood now how am i going to pay my mom back”

tesla is part of sp500 greatlets compare with other top companies price to earnings ratiostesla 1006xamazon 91xnetflix 78xapple 36xmicrosoft 34xgoogle 34xfacebook 31xprice to sales ratiostesla 18xmicrosoft 11xfacebook 10xnetflix 9xapple 8xgoogle 7xamazon 5xmost companies that joined sp500 had a short term pop but were lower 6m1 year later most of the appreciation happens before joining sp500
why isnt tsla dropping it is recalling 117k vehicles in the us and 50k china at the cost of 2500 to fix the suspension per vehicle that is roughly 500million that tsla doesnt have not to mention class action lawsuits to follow so why is it still not falling
please quit harping on valuation something is worth exactly what someone else is willing to pay for it and traditional fundamentals do not fit these circumstances

these shorters especially the tesla shorters suffer from a nasty bias call escalation of commitment they teach you about this in business  graduate school and the reason they teach you about this bias is that its not just the small fry shorters who fall into this trap many big time portfolio managers like david einhorn have also fallen prey to it as wellafter a shorter loses 1000 from shorting a stock hell be under the impression that he already has 1000 invested in this shorting endevor so he cant give up now hell keep on shorting in the hopes that hell recoup what he lost and make some profit in the processhedge fund manager like david einhorn is a classic example of an extremely well educated guy who have forgotten about the dangers of human biases the dude have literally lost billions of dollars of his clients money from shorting tesla

somebody asked why you can see all the impulses in the volume everyone can correct me but my understanding is this this is a ponzi they sell the shares to one another to drive the price up and the higher it goes the more they unload until theres nothing to unloadwhen a big guy unloads the price drops the manipulators then rush in to bring it back upthe basic shares used to rotate around will be dumped in the end on the robinhooders id call that the propeller and in the meantime they just drive the price up for themselves or other third party with which they have an arrangement it might be musk himselfi followed it a couple of daysand this is what i sawideas we can write an email to the sec afterwards

real deal w herefor those who doubted my post concerning the power of the jan 15 option expiration unwind as a huge downward force on the share price of tsla  not a factor in the weakness now but will be as we approach jan1115 i would just say to you if they can take down the stock like they did late yesterday  on a plus 300 dow day no less  and on the sp500 inclusion buildup week and again today even sharper down then how can you doubt that the royal canadian mounties of the finance world will have any trouble taking tsla shareprice down much more when the jan 15 2021 expiration week arrives especially late in that week when the force of the dollar amounts of the downward pressure are literally 10s of times more than this week  and there will be no sp500 inclusion to buoy the shares then watch and learn

on nov 20 2020 catherine wood of ark invest literally said in her own words if you look at tesla on a 1 year timeframe it looks like one heck of an expensive stock however if you look at it on a longer time frame the problem is that everyone is only looking for short term money nobody is okay with losing 50  which they should be because it will eventually moon when the technology is invented at tesla
december 2 2020 musk says our stock will immediately get crushed  if we don’t control costs from the same email elon adds  this is a tough game of pennies requiring thousands of good ideas to improve part cost a factory process or simplify the design while increasing quality and capabilities a great idea would be one that saves 5 but the vast majority are 050 here or 020 there hint tesla cut prices on october 1st on october 15th they cut the price of the model s again by 3000 conclusion cutting prices by thousands of dollars per units is easy cutting costs by even 5 per unit is very difficult on top of that  volume is down at fremont causing costs to increase

ok i went for test drive of model 3for disclosure i drive an audi q7 my wife an audi tts my son a bmw m2 and my daughter a new jeep rubicon so i do know a few things about premium cars first my overall impression of the model 3 was that it is a pretty decent car fast off the line brakes very well good visibility i’m 6 feet tall i found the lower seat to be a bit “ short”  no pun intended in that the edge of seat did not come to the underneath of my kneecap for shorter distances probably no issue but i could see long trips having my right leg tire from less supporti liked the regenerating aspect of the braking solid marks theretried the autopilot on the highway wasn’t a big fan of it but then again i have 12 second auto steer on my q7 and i don’t use it i did not like the fact that i had to divert my eyes off the road to the middle screen to see basic things like speed a hud for some basic things should be standard in a premium car i found the screen to be fairly well laid out but i question having all vehicle controls run through one system like that if anything goes wrong with the screen you are pooched in terms of driving to me that’s a bad design to have that much reliance on one screeni hate the look of aerowheels the car i drove was rwd and had the silver wheels much nicer look imofit and finish looked fine i did not see any visible issues from my brief walk around of the test carso overall i found the acceleration and braking to be very good and the car handled well at 120 km per hour on highway a bit more wind noise than i am used to with audi or bmw but not horrible the interior was well appointed but i think the seats could be better  support wise being in canada the seats are heated but steering wheel isn’t that surprised me that they left that off so i guess i would say i was pleasantly surprised at quality of this car from a driver perspective would i buy it hmmmm probably not because i am concerned about viability of the business and it’s sustainable nature but the car itself was above my expectations as a driver i am used to be a bit more luxury features in a car of that price point but the driving asiects of the car were goodi’ll post some more intel i found out about deliveries discounts etc in another post

one of the very early  real  green tech firms that made me a nice profit im so grateful for that    
how do tesla bulls feel about the notion that part of the reason there hasnt been a correction in the stock price is many investors are holding off until the new year to defer capital gains taxes we know there will be selling from institutional investors who are required to rebalance their portfolios and if that coincides with any negative press say recalls associated with defects from the south korean accident for example that set the stage for a bubble to burst no

when zoom is at 400 and beyond meat is 130stock price wise higher than apple why tesla cant be at 700 yes since sp is over  it may come down a bit but this company is worth the price  dont just look at what it is doing now look at what it will do in future tucks semis  self driving taxis  may be in 510 yrs  and if you say competition i dont see any decent car on road that give tesla run for its money by the time competition catches tesla which i really doubt tesla will be way ahead and planning something completely different so current price is worth it

wow tesla shorts have lost 35 billion this year about twice as much as all the airlines combined the federal government may have to bail them out
with people ignoring demand supply  elon launching standard range after saying it not worth as range is just 250 mile is clearly problem on demand side tesla seeingmarket can celebrate but more they ignore bad news and valuation worst outcome at end may be i wont benefit and lose 100k at end but i am not worried about that i may not good at making money but i know how to recover once go in loss it take month or two but will recover it lot of people will not able to once recover i get more greedy and get stuck eventually eventually i will learn how to control my greed if i started with 2k risk and double down as it go up i would much better shape not saying i wont recover this stock going 50 up daily if it just go down 75 in 1 week i will in profit

heres how the bestest stock in the whole wide world tesla gets to 100000 a share1 tsla gets added to sprises to 1500 a share2 tsla gets added to the dowrises to 20000 a share3 tsla gets added to the russell 3000rises to 50000 a share4 tsla gets added to the wilshirerises to 100000 a sharewatch out shortie
this is really getting funny will be interesting to see the reaction when reality finally blows up this bubble
when the stock drops it will drop 200 points on the open and keep falling this willl stop order meaningless that will leave the longs in shock and will find a bottom at 50 within a day hedge funds and other shorts with their super strong money power will act in unison  imo more than 80 billion dollars will be consolidated before the shark attack so that longs will be crushed with that type of bazooka goldman will be on the driver seat doing this work there will be a blood bath on this thread be careful protect your profits dont loose money unnecessarily hope is a bad word in english as for as stock is concerend
as a university student what i learnt in my trading course is once a stock gets added to the sp 500 especially one as significant as tesla we tend to see a shock increase on the announcement date as people want to front run institutions and index funds when they buy to add on the cd date dec 21 based on this i bought on the announcement date haven’t sold locked in the gains from the post announcement drift and sold for a massive gain now sold today based on this logic i expect the price to decline on monday as historically happened on cd date heavy volume though let’s see if this is true on monday

when tsla hits 1800 then i will agree it is overextended it can’t keep up with ev demand holds hundreds of related proprietary patents is mindsharing rd with nasaspacex holds a market niche’ surpassing all other auto manufacturing companies “worldwide” and has an “out of the box” minded leader tsla is boldly going where no company has gone before
full self drive and cyber truck this year not to mention mode y now being offered in chinathis is going to 1000 expect huge color and guidance from elon on q4 earnings call with how thet will spend the 20 billion raised

does anyone know if elon musk promised to produce 500k cars in 2020 or deliver 500k cars in 2020 the analyst are mixing these two numbers up to support these case whatever they are
tesla has seen 2000 before what is a mere 800 l say 850 by eow and 975 by end of year go figure l called it monday you will see 740 to 760 range at least
i bought into the tesla story in 2018 at 54  you guys just have to believe in this great company
can’t even do 500k in a year and they expect to replace 800 million cars 
initial numbers 2020 goal prepandemic  500k delivered cars 2020 deliveries during a pandemic despite factory shutdown 499550 delivered carsthis is not a rounding error at this point anymore they technically beat expectationsour delivery count should be viewed as slightly conservative as we only count a car as delivered if it is transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct final numbers could vary by up to 05 or moreexpect a surprise

owning shares is basically owning a piece of elon musk anyone who has done their research knows that elons companies are truly his priority and passion he has more invested and more to lose than anyone else and yet he holds his shares who are you little shortie to tell me my shares are overvalued i own an eternal call option on arguably the greatest inventor who ever lived
so last year musk tweeted that tsla was overvalued at 700share now that its at 3600share is it still overvalued asking for a friend
some analyst wrote that tesla has a negative cost of capital which is why its a good investment lol investors dont even care if tesla makes a profit they will pay for the privilege of giving money to tesla
so many articles coming out lately bashing tsla what is their problem i bet none of the writer hold tsla share lol 700 when it is included in sp next week expect record numbers in q4 in term of delivery and er then it will shoot to 800

nio has nothing on king tesla this just a normal correction after 11 day rally don’t get me wrong i own both stocks
dude it only drop 5 bucks
musk now wants to merge with another automaker let me break it down for the slow ones musk knows the stock is hugely overvalued in a big bubblehe would like to sell stock but that will crash it so he wont do that you see he wants to lock in those gains and convert the high stock price into cash to fuel further growth so he needs a way to sell stock without selling stocka merger will do that for him because its not really a merger its an acquisition hes using his current high stock price to buy up another automaker he will then acquire all the manufacturing capability in the other company as well as their full cash position the current tesla stock price easily 10 times what it is actually worth so he may as well use it as currency for him its free money
tesla will be the only autocompany in 20 years
stop taking a lunch break guys keep the momentum going lets see 900 today

tsla stock is never overvalued at this price keep calm and watch in 2021
i bought tesla stock because i test drove one 4 years ago it is an insane car i’ve since bought the x 3 and y i traded the 3 in for the y my son owns the s nothing beats first hand experience owning a tesla has been the best car i’ve ever owned i’m 65 and between myself my wife and my 2 kids i’ve seen just about every make and model out on my driveway all were different from mustangs to chevy to buick lincoln to jeep mazda’s my first car ever was a 72 mazda rotary engines rx2 wow that was a cool car but came with tons of headaches i’ve owned them all nothing has compared to tesla and now tesla stock wow nothing i’ve owned in 40 years has been better than tesla 
tesla dilutes and dilutes and dilutes but investors dont seem to care why is delivering 700k autos in 2021 going to justify this price is delivering 40 more than that in 2022 going to justify this price the market will continue to get more competitive and teslas will have less and less demand as the large automakers shift their focus to electric and hybrids
tesla will go up 1015 in q4 earning market my word
why would anyone short tsla
robinhooder’s are waiting for 1200 dollar to buy this by the time they get money they will be able to afford 15 shares
i sold tesla pre split  about 800 sigh i thought it was insanely overvalued at that point at this point i don’t know how it might be possible that any earnings report will satisfy investor expectations honest question for tesla bulls what future are you buying into and why is tesla dominant in that future despite very competitive market with many capable companies
good to see the tsla stock having another nice uptrend day avoid the noise the price will increase

tsla is a 50 stock in 5 years when people realize they can’t charge monthly for fsd and an fsd taxi service isn’t going to break the bank it will likely be a money losing business even worse by the time that regulation happens other automakers like hyundai will be in the game having said that short term i’m bullish

toyota has had recalls of 15m cars that might be about how many cars tesla has ever made
elon hubbard musk has announced that tesla will launch a new smart phone hes managed to copy steve jobs means of hypepresentations so he might as well go full hog against apples ecar challengeit might never get off the ground like his mars mission but it can futurefake another 50 bucks onto the tsla bubbletime for a phone day surely
tesla is a good stock to invest 1375 is too cheap this is the year end sale price buy with both hands
im 100 bullish on tsla but the price might have gotten ahead of itself tsla will dominate evs as everyone knows but its it will be a dominant player in the energy storage  a trillion  market the solar market the autonomous vehicle market  taxis delivery etc the long haul trucking market and more in a few years when these other areas begin to produce revenues tsla will be worth todays value and on its way to to amazon

longs mantra has long pun been dont bet against elon muskbut if you stay long you are now betting against michael burry md the hedge fund manager profiled in the movie the big short as he now has a large short position on tslaalso last may elon tweeted that the 150 price then was amazingly high so going short would actually be betting with elon

congrats to all the tesla stock owners who have gotten rich off the stock sadly i was way too late to the game to those future owners who are going to get destroyed when this stock collapses i offer my condolences to you ahead of time everyone one of you knows that you can not make a rational logical reason why tesla should be above 300 even 200 is stretching it though tesla is the main game in town if you want an ev today in 5 years that will not be the case consumers will have dozens and dozens of alternative models from europe asia and the us to choose from that fit their tastes even if tesla remains the number 1 brand for ev the odds of it taking more than even 20 of the market share is small so ride the wave up but be careful i admit these levels make me too scared even to entertain buying tesla sure it might go up 1000 more in the next 6 months the house could collapse in a few months down to 400 i will look try mining my riches elsewhere

the institutesfunds are going to buy this stock on 1221 by that time at least around 750 price i do not see the stock price going down soon after 1221 and i see an upward moment after that too the financial institutes and funds will invest billions of dollars to buy the stock and i do not think they will want to see this going down what do you guys think
be thankful but dont chirp most if not all of us have had successes and failures be humble in your successes and gracious to those who fail and you will be far happier we all understand the pain of losing  learn from it and dont rub it in when someone else is on the unfortunate side of a trade as we hopefully dont kick someone when they are down in lifes many challenges
ive received multiple questions about a specific relevant issuethere seems to be a lack of understanding re process of the sp500 inclusion many expect an outsized move to satisfy demand by index buyers at the last minute there are entities lets call them financial middleman arbitragers individualsfirms with deep pockets who immediately upon the nov 16 sp500 committee announcement began to accumulate tsla shares these entities are not long term investors they do things similar to this whenever opportunity strikes so their plan was to buy tsla shares with the express purpose of selling those shares to the last minute index buyers particularly the passive index tracking funds these entities will not hold tsla shares past the close of post market trading this friday dec 18 so their accumulated shares are must sell shares  even as the passive indexers are must buy shares so the last minute buyers will have a very ample supply of shares to buy at the regular close or shortly thereafter in postmarket friday to satisfy their ability to mimic sp500 starting on monday dec 21 it has been largely the buying by these entities and others joining in that has caused the rise in tsla stock  in this last month since the announcement  from the 400s to the 600s now that is the spike a month long one  naturally with fits and starts if there are more must buy shares than must sell shares available at the close the stock will tick up if there are more must sell shares  the stock will tick down the down this week has mainly been driven by some of the must sell people realizing that they may have overshot on the buying that they were risking giving up on the profits by waiting to do it all or none so the down through wed may have overshot the selling a bit and today we are seeing a corrective move in the opposite direction while it is not easily discernible to determine the exact balance of must sellmust buy shares the action so far is highly indicative of a very close balance being reached and thus the friday close is likely to not have a large spike up or down from wherever it is in the hours leading up to the close

the whole world is trying to find a way to disparage the genius of elon musk the juggernaut that is tsla is not about car sales
i am under pressure pe ratio of 1200 is just scary i dont want to lose money when stock drops from 630 to 400  should i sell or keep
tsla is the only stock worth holding long term we are on the verge of a hard reset of the economy led by a new kind of company cars as assets coming this year all none self driving cars will be worth nothing sort of like the bank accounts of tsla short sellers
be very careful to invest in tesla as you know people in china is or was buying tesla mainly as a protest to government but after so many recalls it is changing stay as far as you can
overall market bouncing back up to green did you buy that dip
i would start to sell tesla only if something happened to elon musk or if he starts selling some shares

great news  tesla sales are down double digits in europe europe buys about 15 million cars every year so far tesla has sold only 58000 units tesla has about 0 of the eu auto market tesla has about 6 of the ev segment but that is down from 15 last year summary teslas price cuts did not help much
i am wondering if we may see 3000 again with a forward stock split coming by 2021 year end
although i feel tesla is way overpriced overbought and pumped i do believe it will easily hit 700 within a week or two i felt same bf when it was trading at 300 way before the split but it just keeps climbing so i’m finally in and i’ll enjoy the ride while it’s fairly predictable that it will trade up bought at 428 so i’m already way up in a short amt of time it’s up 25 in after hours trading btw i’m wondering if they allow fund managers to transact after hours and adjust somehow bf am so they don’t affect markets whatever the algorithm it never seems to affect actual stock price too much when they list or delist from sp 500 this is 3rd time going through a listing or delisting for me so i’m guessing around 2 increase max but thats because of all of the others buying because of that even more others buy the hype works many will now own it who never have others who own it will buy more it will be over 700 by christmas
