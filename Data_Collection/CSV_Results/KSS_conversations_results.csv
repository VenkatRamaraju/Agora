Way overwalued now.
hth is kss up on a bloodshed day like today!?
"The short position shrank by 500k shares down to 27M so we have plenty of fuel in the rocket. Yesterday looked like a bit of covering to me during the rally so it will be interesting the last report on the short position at the end of the month. Remember, this is a game of musical chairs with about 190M players but only about 163M actual shares. When the bulk of the short position covers the stock will move significantly."

Jack Baur and Dzikoski where are you???? 
Get ready for run down to 17s
"anyone else concerned by this double top pattern, and the 2,000 puts in place to expire on the 24th?"
Might as well take the loss on those puts
was mike able to cover his short position?
Profit of about $1/ share in the midst of the height of restrictions and covid! Every quarter this year will be up! Year/year!Dividend soon in the bank!
"i'm glad it's going up, but any explanation of why both the market and KSS is going up in spite of the bad news this morning? I want to buy some KSS but not if it's going to drop 2% by this afternoon ...is this increase strange to anyone?"
Kohl’s was going out of business before Amazon partnered with them to allow returns. This run up makes no sense as their business model still sucks and don’t know why people think they’re going to be better off than they were before. Just talk to the coal workers and you will get the real story
It will turn green. Diviend payout is near. So nobody is selling and everybody is buying
Restored dividend quarterly payment will be 35 to 70 cents per share approximately.
"Now thats over with,kohl's will move steadily higher due to higher Sales and good next quarter!!"
"Is Kohls the next Mervyn's? I remember Mervyn's, they closed in 2008. They were very similiar to Kohls - the stores were seperate from malls, and they sold similiar items such as kohls. They also attracted a similiar demographic. Is kohls going to have the same fate as Mervyn's?"
Kohl’s Down on Friday’s- Up on Monday’sFriday 4/5 - down 1.99%Monday 4/1 - up 2.09%Friday 3/29 - down .42% (was down 1.26% the day before)Monday 3/25 - up 2.54%Friday 3/22 - up .51% ((down 2.03% the day before)Monday 3/18 - up 1.66%
great divedend
stores opening next week all across the midwest.. it could really lift off
"Go to KSS and check them out for yourself. However, if you do go in the store don't be surprized if you buy something, because its too tempting once you enter to leave without some gem in your hand."
"I strongly belive that KSS will break $40 this week and will still be undervalued considering its strong leadership, historical dividends and loyal customer base"
"don't worry, covid 19 new case continue decline, kss and fl have very good business, just hold it,sure be make a lot of money."
I started investing 6 months ago and hold 8 companies. Sods law that this was my smallest investment but is the most profitable. May do some shuffling tomorrow and go bigger here. Still see 80% up from here in 12-18 months.
maybe next year after the fire selloff
"I was at a kohl’s. There were more people in the amazon return line than checking out at the registers. I constantly hear “...but the parking lot is full!”. Ya, the lot is full, full of people returning stuff to amazon!"
When there is Target who goes to Kohls!!!?!?!!? Target is the place to be!
"I love it how the company beats by 12 cents but analysts only raise their yearly estimates by a fraction of that. Guess they won't have much trouble making their numbers for the year.As to moving off the $80 base, that is going to be tough with analysts projecting virtually no revenue growth next year. My take is they need 4% revenue and a 4% stock buyback in order to warrant the 10% earnings growth that should garner a 15 P/E. So far it looks like they can make the revenue growth number but they will fall short on the buyback. I do think Q4 is going to be a blowout, but we won't know that till after the Thanksgiving week."
KiSS your $ goodbye with this junk!
backing up the truck here.
"WOW, nice sales add in the morning paper. Classy for KOHLS sales"
"Gerhard, the big money boys must have sent out a directive to Wall Street, they are pumping technology today, while dumping retail. Part of their daily sector swaps."
Love these little Bull traps ... exciting
"Minor short covering, so the move down in the 2nd week of April was a sudden lack of buyers and sellers getting worried, they must be listening to Stoxx."
"They don’t want this stock to crash just yet, they wanna sucker in a few more buyers."
Bad time to be a person who shorts stock today.Coming months are going horrible for shorts!Worst in history in fact!
"You guys will get hosed. Should have taken profits! You longs never learn.Retail #s up was today's buy and tomorrow's sell sell sell. You small time retailers make big dogs like me rich,so thanks!"
You clowns better buy this up major support fell yesterday unless you wanna be longs do something $15 will be here fast
Kohl's reached a 52 Week high at 47.80
25 next week.
What is up with KSS this morning?
"at this price the company is valued at half it's quarterly revenue. granted the revenue will fall big for the next quarter, but this valuation implies that this company will not recover from this setback, which is ridiculous in my opinion."
boycott Amazon GUYS
was that shorting at close?
So am I right in understanding the tariffs have yet to be implemented on the goods they buy? That would be in the next round when Trump goes 25% on everything post the late June meeting? So all we have so far is a benefit from cheaper goods as Kohl's got the benefit of the currency devaluation. Makes it clear why retailers have no problem beating earnings lately but missing on revenue.
"Red everywhere today, but KSS holding up nicely!"
Time to get on the KSS train for the next leg up. This downward move has no legs.
Down big on high volume. Big boys are saying they want to see some transformational changes at Kohl's and fine tuning adjustments are not going to cut it. The department store slice of the Kohl's pie is going to have to be reduced or else these results are going to be a regular occurrence each earnings release.
MM'S ARE KEEPING THE PRICE LOW TO GRAB YOUR CHEAP SHARES. DON'T SELL. I DOUBLE MY SHARES TO 10K. $30 BY THE END OF THE MONTH!
"We will litterly have the alphabet soup of retail bksJCP, Kohls, Lord&Taylor, Macy's, Nordstrom"
"Macys is $5, how come you think KSS should not crash?"
"KSS is still a good company,with good management,the problemwith buying it is it will either have a dead cat bounce tomorrow orit takes another 2-3 drop,so you'll get stuck for a couple bucks andhave to hold it for 2-3 quarters or miss it totally,you just have to takeyour chance & hope for the best,not a good way to play a stock."
Kohl's is up 13.16% to 17.88
where are the buyers ?
"From here Forward, Kohls LOOKS GREAT and the manipulating funds know it. they'll run it up soon."
"So today investors are waking up to the fact that Amazon will need a brick and mortar presence to execute autonomous delivery, a 50% savings over today’s delivery. Kohl’s and Amazon will increase it’s mutual beneficial relationship as they need each other."
"Kohls opened in Maryland last week. I was shocked to see the parking lot completely full when driving by. Q2 will be the last unprofitable quarter, and Kohls will outperform in Q4. After selling off for nice profits, I double my position on the dip."
just put my online order in!
"Kohl's just indicated that they will be selling anti-American, anti-family, anti-capitalist, pro-marxist BLM attire.How dumb!?!Hard pass on this stock."
great buy on the crazy dip I m adding on 500 shares
this is moving like Target is being bought by Amazon
When Trump is booted out of office in a massive landslide Nov and his corrupt Republican supporters in Congress loose control of the US Senate it will be a great day for all Americans.Watch retail stocks soar upward in price. Before that day will see a spike upward as a new Vaccine receives FDA emergency approval in late Sept or October marking an end to the Coronavirus crisis and return to normal life.The later part of this year is going to be great for these retail stock survivors who will gain market share and return to profitability as normal life returns.
"BREAKING: Maverick Capital Ltd. Purchases 246,270 Shares of Kohl's Co. (KSS). BUY THE DIP...https://ledgergazette.com/2018/03/01/maverick-capital-ltd-purchases-246270-shares-of-kohls-co-kss.html"
"Well we are ex today, now we can see whether the shorts continue to cover more, Mondays rally in retail certainly was due to the stronger jobs report last Friday. We will also see what happened to the short position post earnings, I assume it increased significantly. Should make for an interesting week."
"I wonder how many ""longs"" bailed"
2000 more shares cheap and long for the grand kids! Thank and good luck!
Dividend is now almost 20% of share price? ... somethings gotta give with no revenue coming in
Hello 30s. We missed you.
"Value Trap....Retail in general is a value trap due to Amazon...Amazon is still very aggressive in its e-comerce initiatives and no one can touch them. Until Amazon's AWS business slows down, they will not do more for their consumer retail operation. As for value trap per specific retail company, M is the most exposed since mall traffic will be less and less going forward and they still have too many stores. In addition, America is getting older and as the baby boomers retire, they spend less in fashion and things plus the dressing down of America is a game changer in that everything apparel seems to be getting so informal that athletic wear and T-shirs are the trend...no margins on these and other than those like housewares, well, Amazon's own them. As for KSS, I think now the last X-Mas sales is as goos as it will ever get as we had a GOP tax benefits plus and a growing economy...BUT BUT as for the economy, the catalyst from above has probably been priced in. Also, the experiment with ALDI, well it is still too early so that is not a catalyst...an Amazon taking over the space instead of ALDI would have kept the stock as a takeover Amazon play and would have put a floor on the stock....but now...well looks like KSS will not be making new high anytime soon and will be pressure. Amazon some day will buy KSS but that may be 2-3 years away and will depend on Amazon's e-commerce growth as well as the momentum on their AWS which is still expanding but competition is clearly gaining."
Shorts are getting squeezed. Nice turn around this morning in down market.
Kohls is like a large Gap store but with cheap chinese home goods. Good riddance.
"Thank you for the deep, $60 stock, beat earning in lockdown, 15 billions in assets, will be a happy holidays shopping"
"God I sold at 55, right before the fed announced rate cut and trump tweeted. Expect it to fall more after more tweets and of the fed downs flower rates to consumers wants. Will buy lower if and when that happened"
And you two could email each other and save the rest of us from all these long posts.
I am thinking todays action is all about the China trade deal being delayed
Kohl's is up 6.82% to 24.58
"Wait...am I the only seeing this? If AMZN buys Kohl's and stock up the existing stores with electronics and appliances, BBY is toast...their $40 billion annual sales would migrate to AMZN and they will file bankruptcy like Circuit City did. And if they also provide grocery, man, Target will take a hit as well. The revenue from this move would result in $40b annual sales taken from BBY and another $40B from other retailers including target, JC Penney, Macy's, etc. for a whopping $80 billion in the intermediate term (3-5 yrs) which would be 40% of they current e-commerce sales of $200 billion in the US for 2017...now that is what you call revenue growth! Plus it would help their margins all around because the stores would provide ez returns, buy on line pick up in store, warehousing/fulfillment and efficiency in the ""last mile"" delivery, and sell more of their own branded products, etc. etc. Man the synergy that can be achieved will surely allow them to keep that 150 forward PE."
Kohl’s under attack from too many angles.
Shorts getting rekt
"Don’t let politics cloud your business, blocking lindell and my pillow is stupid. Won’t be spending my money there. Corporations just need to refrain from commenting on anything political"
Kohl's stock price target cut to $16 from $20 at WedbushToday 8:27 AM ET (MarketWatch)
Futures deep RED your heading lower-will buy 38-40
Nov stock market will hit 30 when trump wins and Biden is in a rest home .
I thought our economy was growing??
SEL SEL SEL THIS TRASH!!!
We always do school shopping at kohl’s but no school so no shopping for us
An easy sell here on a fake pump
At market close 41.25 and 42.00 after hours.
"The White House, Congress and Senate just closed the doors to the public because of the virus, but hey lets go shopping at Kohl's, I need a new top!"
You can thank Welfare Mart and Amazon for this.
Up and away!
Well that at least looks like some shorts are thinking the bottom is likely in. Most likely we will have to wait for 4mvp to stop getting paid to trash the stock on this board to be a bit more comfortable about that.
"TRump and the Republicans are going to be kicked out of Office Nov 2020.This will great for the stock market, especially retail stocks. It means the END of the Trade war with China.A trade war that was foolish and harmful to the USA and world economies with no benefit at All.The USA economy was harmed with no benefit at all. Farmers, retailers, and nearly all parts of the economy will be happy to see the end of Trump corrupt, incompetent administration. It is time to end Trump's corruption, fiscal incompetence and spitting on USA allies in the world.Time for restoration of business as usual with China and other important trade partners.Watch retailers and other industries rise after the humiliating defeat of the Trump administration and Trump cohorts in Congress.It will be happy day for the world, and the USA."
"Can anyone explain to me who is buying this junk? Physical general retail is gone , it’s over for this whole space imho"
20% of clothing shopping in America was done online (Google it) before the pandemic. will it go to 100% after this is over? I think not. People love to browse and find deals. They will do it again and soon
Kohls selling a lot of Lands End stuff as they beat!
This might be down 15-17 percent at open.
WHOA!!! what happend to KSS this morning/over the weekend? why the huge drop?
Cramerites OH MY
Macys killing it
"Huge shorting on XRT and KSS in the first two weeks of the month, 2.3M shares of KSS and 2.4M more of XRT, so this is definitely a spring getting wound up once it can press into the $80's. Likely it takes Q2 or Q3 earnings if they are aren't bullish about the 2nd half in the Q2 CC. Should be some solid money making opportunities in this stock going forward."
stay long friends
KSS will be in single digit after 2nd quarter earning
The only thing that can drive this down is MM and bad financials coming for EOQ at the end of this month. This is going back up fast this summer.
"Per today's Investor Presentation, the $1.5B revolver has been fully repaid in October! Fantastic news, this opens the door to dividend payments. Depending on capital needed for the Spring 2021 FLX line, etc."
"Price target of 25, why buy in the 20’s when you can buy back in cheaper? If you wanna go long this stock."

I am not drinking the Koolaid again. What a slide down from $29 to below $19. Over 2% every single day this week? I hope we have a better week next week. But this is not good my friends.
"Was hoping to see the reverse effect of the opening pop and sell-off as the opening drop should have lead to some short covering. However, they might think this has a few days to run so they hope for an even lower price."
Timber!!!!
Moderna just announced a second vaccine has been proven 94.6 percent effective at preventing covid and can be kept at a higher more practical temperature of negative 20 degrees celcius for a long 30 days of storage.Exciting news. Now the USA has two highly effective vaccines which will receive FDA approval in a week or two with vaccinations of the public to begin next month.Bullish for companies hard hit by civid.
"So the Orange #$%$ Clown says he's going to talk to China and Kohl's goes up, you people are so gulible!I can see why Target will stay in business, same model as Walmart with groceries in store along with Starbucks and others, Kohl's is just another JC Penney and Sears waiting to happen!Just a matter of time!"
Amazing that KSS posted a profit last quarter even though for half the quarter their stores were closed.This quarter ALL their stores are open for the whole quarter Expect a much larger profit Kss is in a positive cash flow position. This stock will triple by year end.The wind is at our backs.
Fire sale! Time for Amazon to place a bid to buy this great company that has recently stumbled but will be back stronger than ever
Do they think we are not watching them SEC should investigate and BANG EM IN JAIL!!!!
Senseless Panic selling going on. The end of the world is near..
"Is everyone on this site named David, or is it one guy posting all that? He must be losing a lot of money in KSS"
"also, I thought the retail report wasn't stellar...why is KSS still moving up today?"
can't trust book value. look at JCP
Kss is a great buy at this price. With all the craziness in retail numbers were good. Just added
the economy will double in the next few years kohl's will get double the last 52 week highs!
Kohl’s will come back up! Look at how Grubhub is up now after their messy recent report.
waiting for $15 or below to get in
going to 40 fast
I'm happy with my profits and I like the dividend also !!!
"Ltmcf is drilling 300m deep for lithium in the upper part of the country chili, in the coming weeks. There is a TEM geographic phenomenon in the area of 63sq kilometers. Finding atleast 500mg/ of lithium near the surface. Company says once they find a concentrate of lithium of their liking. They can start the extracting process and will be able to produce lithium at 1/2 cost compared to the competitors. Check it out. Before it's too late."
what's going on today and what should we expect for the future?
"Corona virus scam equals Wall Street scam. Multiple countries have already presented very positive data on treatment plans with very high success rates, many of them were last ditch efforts that were only employed when patients were near death, so some of the successes are even that more positive. The mortality rate is showing much lower percentages outside of the two hardest hit countries of Italy and China. Czechia and Israel both have over 700 confirmed cases and both have zero fatalities. Germany has over 17K cases and only 44 fatalities. Meanwhile we have the CDC and WHO propagandizing the virus by providing weak or poor guidance. Not having solid research after four months since the virus was first isolated. Still putting ambiguous information about how the virus will react in warm weather conditions even though half of the world is still in late summer and we have spent billions of dollars to create exceptional labs for research such as this."
When do they report?
when doesJcp report earnings
KSS shares are on fire. Now KSS is all time high
What is driving the after hours price? Haven’t found any news.
"Kohl's downgraded to sell from hold at CFRA, price target cut to $50 from $68"
Thank you to those who are selling! It’s like having a 10% off coupon at checkout.
"Is it time to squeeze shorty? They must file as of the close today, then it is reported after the close next Monday. My guess is we have had short covering since the big selloff on earnings day and it will be substantial. That means there is little stock available to buy at these price levels and momentum has a way of feeding on itself."
My wife will purchase bras and underwear and makeup online. But when it comes to work or casual clothing she wants to try it on first. Some clothing runs to big or two small. Her clothes always look great on her!
"Lol l paid 13.50avg for 5,000 shares in April!!!"
I hope everyone on this board is BOYCOTTING AMAZON. Amazon hurts all retailers.
Kss beat EPS projections by 102% in the 3rd quarter and 3.78b in revenue. Great job kss.
They need a new head of women's merchandising.
Kohl's has an awesome online selection for kitchen and kids as well as clothing. we're doing a lot of our Christmas shopping online this year at Kohl's and have it shipped straight to them. Go KSS!
"I like brick and mortar, but the issue is not many people go and sale less, cost more"
when do options expire since the market is closed tomorrow?
"This stock is a day/swing traders delight. I did it successfully twice last week. and made a quick $800. Just put in a limit order for 1000 shares at $10. Let's see if it gets filled. And, I almost never do this. The volatility of this stock is the real deal, although I would never hold it for the long term. GL to the rest of you. Nothing wrong with making a few bucks now and then."
"Poor Bechody, he deleted his post about a $17.09 short."
Just voted the blue card to support KSS management.Threw the white card out from the activists. Activists support sale leaseback which is bad for KSS.Real Estate is their strength and it gives them lot of flexibility.
BOOM!
Amazon needs to buy KSS in 2020.
no looting at kohls by blm because the stores are not in the hood
Time to buy. Way overblown reaction to Nordstrom privatization failure.
KSS actually not the biggest % loser in this bloodbath today. look at the banks freefall. not a good omen.
"4mvp, yet under the Obama administration you were willing to walk around without any masks when the Swine flu hit the US in 2010, 56,000,000 Americans contracted the illness, over 500,000 were hospitalized and over 12,000 eventually died because of it. Currently what we know about Corona, is that in Italy, the average age of the patients who have died is 81, of those patients most if not all were suffering from other ailments compromising their immune systems even further. World wide we have only surpassed the known rate of infection of 100,000 people, and deaths are under 2,000 people. We can assume however that many people have the virus and don't even know it. Also we know that this year alone 1 billion people will have the typical Spanish flu and that 500,000 people will succumb to its effects, that happens every year. Nice fear mongering though."
"covid-19 New case strong down in 3 days,that's natural down,so covid 19 disaster can finish quickly,maybe it finished in September,so kss 2h year will be very good,so kss can reach 1 year high in winter,"
"Selloff way overdone in my opinion, despite the mgmt blunder in setting the expectations. Bought some more here."
"If you guys are wondering what's happening....the smart money went on the short side because gasoline is approaching $3.00 per gallon, which is the tipping point for consumer change in sentiment...gasoline national average is now $3.92...Plus add the rising interest worry which also affects consumer and you have a indecisive situation for retail never mind what the company's outlook is which are always rosy."
"So some thoughts to the shocking news that the short position increase, and significantly from 12/1 to 12/15 and the subsequent continued strong increase in the share price since. I think this clearly shows that we have renewed buying interest in the stock and given the strong holiday shopping season and the tax cuts that really is no surprise. What is a surprise is the continued shorting. My guess is from 12/15-12/31 we will see another increase in the short position as the stock technically has made a top at a key level of resistance at $57.27. For shorts, who still think they are right (they are not), this is the point where you double down on your bet and I think with the price action in retailers yesterday and today, that is clearly the case. Obviously there is new buying interest in the stock so their attempts to drive it down with additional shorting will fail, as they did earlier this month. That will set up a lot of upside pressure once, and of course if, Kohls breaks above that new key potential level of resistance. In any case we have to watch the stock price action, yesterdays large down day on lower than average volume is a strong sign that there really aren't a lot of sellers out there, so the only way for shorts to drive the stock price down, is to increase the float by shorting more. It is going to be a very interesting battle till earnings, when I think reality will set in. Indeed, I think early in the year we will have some institutional shorts cover their positions as they assess the massive losses they have taken on that position in 2016. The guys trying to hold onto their jobs, like JB, are selling the case that now it is going to go down, honest. If their bosses believe them, not with huge losses buddy you are fired, they have a chance, but with anemic volume on large down moves, the writing in on the wall.It is going to be an interesting new year for us and there will be lots of action I am sure."
"Last chance to buy discounted stocks. The Corona scam is quickly coming to an end. Even one of the most liberal governor's in America is rethinking the concept of shutting down the entire economy. Realizing that forcing containment of the 80% of the population that will be asymptomatic with the most at risk population, those who are over the age of 65 and with a pre-existing condition (98% of all Corona related deaths in Italy have been in that group) was unwise and probably contributed to the hospitalizations and deaths. Furthermore, by this weekend we should have confirmation of the French doctor's drug combination trials on a much larger scale, the combination of Hydroxychloroquine and the Z pack, once a safe treatment option exists, this will begin to drop from the news media's radar. Though we will also have a huge population of people who will already have been exposed to the virus and already have the anti-bodies in their system, so we will need people to donate blood for those who have heart issues and can't safely receive the Hydroxychloroquine treatment."
Weekend sales were through the roof in my regional stores.....Monday and Tuesday will be major restock days for floor personnel....amazed by the amount of foot traffic to go along with the online boom
Sell on news happening here. I think we will be heading up over 50 soon.
Longs you better pray the FED turns the printers on this week. Last week was brutal and you clowns took a hosing while I cleaned up on puts and shorting.
In Barron's striking price column a recommendation to buy Kohls Jan 2019 calls for the potential that amazon could potentially buy them for a physical presence. Much like Whole Foods. I thought about wagering some money. opinions welcomed.
Heavy option's trading on MACYS. Don't be surprised if they also file for Chapter 11.
Shame that these days an earnings beat gets treated the exact same way as an earnings miss (TGT)
Another example of a big run up before earnings and then a small correction. Earnings were already built into the price. Once market opens it will correct and go up
"From website:""Kohl's will host its quarterly earnings conference call at 9:00 am ET on August 20, 2019. The phone number for the conference call is (800) 398-9397. """
Kohl's price target raised to $65 from $41 at CFRA.... I am glad that I am holding this.
Wallstreet manipulation at it's best.
$42.'s coming soon to a Market near you!
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kohl-apos-taps-facebook-clothing-142000581.html
Even JCP is up big today!'bout all ya need to know! Going much lower!
"so TGT is killing it and KSS is going out of business, yeah... right."
"Since the dividends are suspended, if i invest now... will i get the dividends when they are back on track, and offering dividends again?"
"The only retailer I like...great prices, excellent service, no check out lines (at least not for long) and I love their clothes!#$%$.....!"
great opportunity to sell this morning and I overslept
Chase to cover
"Run up is dead, I’m out of this and into something that will make money in this climbing market, retail stocks have had their run ups. Get back in this stock at cheaper prices."
35 bucks by end of year tax loss selling will accelerate
sell or hold?
"I’m a day trader I make 500$ a day roughly, and can only focus on so many stocks intraday, I like trading this stock a lot cuz it’s range is predictable and I feel comfortable trading it with the price ranges it goes at. 21-16 is the price range apparently"
"Funny thing, I once heard an analyst say stores like Kohls and Macys don't have any mote protecting sales from competitors.Wrong! Absolutely Wrong!Fact is the latest government sales figures proved conclusively that when these retailers were forced to be closed their customers did not go to their competitors online. Instead, they chose to delay clothing sales until their favorite brick and mortar stores reopened.That's great news. It means the nonsense of a retail apocalypse is false! It means firmly 75% of all Americans will not ever buy clothes ONLINE! People want to see the clothes, feel the material, try it on and they love to go in person to make these personal purchases. These people never ever will buy online! NEVER!It is solid, firm, immovable mote that protects clothing sales forever! It means ONLINE clothing sales are limited in potential to take away market share because of the psychology of the buyers or general public.Thus I see a V shaped recovery in retail."
KSS is grossly undervalued. The wind is at our backs. $ 2 invested today will be worth over $6 in a mere 6 to 18 months.Try getting that return from a bank account or a money market or an annuity or a gold ETF or even an index mutual fund.Greater risk means greater reward potential.
Glad I did not buy yesterday.
When do you think KSS will begin paying dividends again?
"some Fund is trying real hard to manipulate this stock down, won't WORK,,MORE BUYERS getting in."
"On the way to $60 again. Folks can't wait to spend those stimulus checks at Kohl's, TJX, and Home Depot."
"Retail getting crushed today. Macy#$%$ new 52 week low, Nordstrom close to it?s 52 week low, Amazon drops back below 50 DMA, Target and Kohl?s give back gains from earnings beat. Weak employment report due to weather while wages are up. International financials very weak. I believe we are in a Goldilocks situation, very bullish for the long term. Interest rates will be lower for at least another year. Great dividend stocks like Kohl?s will be more attractive in this environment."
its gonna bust the 20 nut before close and i stand behind all my statements
'Sup with Kohl's today?
Missed out on a big day for Kohls.. still a value buy this week? want to dump a large sum in
Any short who didn't cover is going to lose a lot of money when those margin calls hit
Each drop is an opportunity to buy more !
"Earnings beat, guidance raised, and she drops?"
Thanks for the buying opportunity!
"Kohl's is now my man store. Went to return an Amazon purchase. Asked the women if they get a lot of Amazon returns...""OMG yes!"" Before leaving, I bought $58 worth of goods. Increased my position today. If the Coronavirus pushes people indoors purchasing Amazon, Kohl's will be a clear winner. Kohl's is the clear winner when Amazon buys them. 90% of all people in the US live within 10 miles of a Kohl's."
Great buying opportunity. Will resume run to 50s soon.
what is the long term debt situation on this mess? someone post.
Waiting for earnings 11/19
Maybe now is the perfect time for AMZN to buy KSS?https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geKaDdv4degz0AEwrBGOd_;_ylu=X3oDMTEyMW8wMTYwBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDQjk4MzJfMQRzZWMDc3I-/RV=2/RE=1585983582/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.fool.com%2finvesting%2f2019%2f04%2f25%2fis-amazon-inching-closer-to-buying-kohls.aspx/RK=2/RS=l4dXHgbj79ponI7aAqhhJMTcxms-
"So there where a lot reasons for Kohl’s earnings miss & guiding down, weather, ineffective marketing , accounting change for leases, tariffs, closing cost for stores that are going to be replaced later this year, & upfront costs for Amazon returns. Nothing materially permanent yet one way or the other. On the good side Kohl’s has been picking up business from competition closings in the Midwest. I didn’t hear anything about At Home, Aldi & Planet Fitness. The dividend is now at 4.7%. Short sellers will compare Kohl’s now to Macy’s with the high yield but I don’t agree."
"Another reason for the miss was the increased CapEx which exceeded Depreciation by 8M this quarter. That might just be because they spent more, in 2018 their average depreciation minus CapEx was almost a $100M positive impact, which after taxes translates into something like a 40 cent impact on earnings. Last year that gap was $110M, so that more than explains the headline earnings miss. It is the new distribution super center that is impacting earnings this year and significantly."
Kss had a huge drop from April-may in 2019. Anyone know the reason for this big drop in share price. Went from the $70' down to the $40'.
Morgan Stanley is waaaaay wrong about Kohl's. Hard to believe that Kimberly Greenberger still has a job!
Picked this up at $61.68 last Friday. Nice couple of days this week. Looks like some of the Brick-and-Mortar stores are gaining momentum since Amazon is taking a bit of a beating right now.
Green Bay........Went past Kohl's East (the slower of our 2) about 11 AM today. Lot maybe 1/3 of a good day. Target lot quite full. Went to TJ Maxx.....many shoppers.Kel............a holder
still have quite s few days left before this stops going down
And you guys laughed at me a few weeks back when I said amazon is in talks
Will it operate in Georgia?
guys this is totally normal!! KSS has been soaring the past 2 days and the dip always happens. stocks give a little then go back up!! its just a small pullback!!
How can anyone invest in a retailer now when we are entering a 2 year Depression ...dividend must go away soon
Amzn can bank this
This Retail Stock $KSS Just Triggered The Mother Of All Head & Shoulder Patterns... http://bit.ly/KSSTriggered
Ridiculous volatility.
finish high 21 fridayOption 22 EXP. OOM. (if exercised)leaves 2 days to earnings will be a beat but by how much?within those 3-4 days begin climb/fall to:Bull: 30Norm: 24.00Bear:18.50
My wife said they need yo revamp the women's clothing line.She said the clothes are matronly.
"I've been buying one value stock during this selloff and it has paid off..Took a hit on KSS as I had expected and indicated here since it has gone up 30% twice since Nov. so I was not surprised. By the way, Amazon's e-ccommerce business again really was nothing to brag about. ""Revenue from third-party seller services (commissions, fulfillment services, merchant loans, etc.) grew 41% to $10.5 billion. That was well above the 20% growth recorded for Amazon's online store (direct e-commerce) sales, which carry lower margins on average and totaled $35.4 billion."" In spite of its strong sales guidance, Amazon only expects Q1 operating income of $300 million to $1 billion, which compares with a year-ago level of $1 billion."
Sorry. I am selling tomorrow at close. I don’t care about the dividends. Next day will drop
I like the company but NO GROWTH
"I went to Kohl's Christmas Eve, only four people in front of me. I sometimes shop at Kohl's but as an investment, I'm not seeing it. The place seems stuck, like it's the same as it was five years ago. I think they should expand the types of items they carry or widen brand base."
Worth holding it through earnings?
"I think this is a very rare case where a completely unrelated company (Macys) has completely remove the downside risk of earnings. Kohls is not a Macys, yet it dropped the same amount (approx 12%) on it's earnings release. No guarantees, but I think this is a good risk:reward here."
500$ made on my Kohls options both of them 282% ROI thank you Kohl's
Bullish case eps 10 with amzn x 12 is 120 so a 30% discount =$
"Looks to me like the shorts got some buddies to sow some hate on the stock to take it down early and they have been trying to cover what they can without letting it run. Monday Kohl's will be able to buy back its own stock again and we will have data on the Black Friday weekend, including Thanksgiving, so likely positive news. Also, after Monday we should get data on Cyber Monday sales which I think this year are going to be disappointing because a lot of on-line sales were likely pulled forward to Black Friday and of course Thanksgiving. It will be interesting to see how the on-line hype is reported next week, likely giving naysayers something to hang their hats on, despite the fact that it isn't reality of the overall state of retail."
"COLD here in MN, but $TGT and $BBY stores huge Black Fri. ACRX keeps moving higher, Seeking Alpha article out giving ACRX 695% UPSIDE, highly recommend digging into ACRX. not sure why $KSS is red"
"Everyday it loses about 3% this week. False start to suck more people in. We have NOT discovered a true bottom yet. This from a hardcore KSS bag holder. Bearish short term. We need unmanipulated bottom discovery, purely on supply and demand and not hysterical positive spins."
GOP loonies claim fraud and expect the world to believe with no proof. LOSERS! They shop at walmart. No loss here.
"Go Away Shorts, do you want to lose your house, wife and lazy life you have????"
"The Bear Case as I had outlined several days ago was due to bad Weather, Consumer Stretch, Lock Out Period , Sell in May go Away. Now you can add disappointing results from BBBY, Botton, etc. Today, you can also add Consumer Sentiment, which is lower than expected. AND going forward, rising fuel cost, which affects consumers spending power. And people are saying ""recession"" starting in 2019. PLUS this cycle is long in the tooth. And that even does not take into account trade wars, Syria, Saudi Arabia & Yemen (Iran(.... Sorry boys, I warned you to watch your step and it seems to be panning out."
"kss making moves with Amazon helping out with increasing price . Christmas shopping, winter wears, increasing foot traffic all indicates earning beat and the reinstatement of dividends . to the mid 30s we go"
"Has anyone read one of the greatest most popular books on investing called ""Peter Lynch: Beating the Street""If you did, you would have read his advise gained from decades of beating the market.Peter Lynch says "" The key to making money in stocks is not to get scared out of them. This point cannot be overemphasized. Every year finds a spate of books on how to pick stocks or find the winning mutual fund. But all the good information is useless without the willpower. In dieting and in stocks, it is the gut and NOT the head that determines the results.""Here you have the words of Peter Lynch himself, one of the most successful investors of all times telling you that when you get a great bargain like KSS sold at bargain prices during a covid scare, to succeed all you have to do is relax, be unafraid and hold and watch the inevitable happen as it rises to precovid prices.This is a golden opportunity to what every $2 invested in KSS become $6 in 6 to 18 months. Ignore the short sellers who post nonsense trying to scare you away and enlarge your position as the opportunity arises.Buy KSS and enjoy getting richer. Soon covid will be past history as will this golden opportunity."
"Oooh Goody, time to short you morons again. Easy money."
"Tune in to the call , 9am ET Michelle is among the best of modern retail CEO's imo"
Pretty sweet day trade here...will probably close 55.
"Like I have said many many times on this board, lets come back mid Feb and see what the price is............forget all the #$%$ about amazon this and that. If all you can hang your hat on is a buyout then what does that really say about this store. I asked about 10 millennials where I work when was the last time you were in a Kohls and out of 10 only 2 said once over the last 6 months.......its not a store the younger people like and shop at so what does that say about their future."
"A miss is never good but reality is that the hurricanes like did have an impact in the Q, so not totally unexpected. Good news is with the drop in the share price they will be buying back a lot more shares before Christmas. In the end Kohl's is turning into a short squeeze play where the shorts have bet their life that the company will go under. There is some very bad news in the Q report for the shorts in that they increased revenue Y-Y and that with the hurricane impact. The company bought back 11M of 177M shares over the last year and that will continue it looks like.The balance sheet looks solid and everything on a per share basis has improved significantly for shareholders since last year.So I think we get an opening drop but it might rally as smart shorts may decide to take some profits and sellers are drying up on this stock. Remember when shorts short they create a new seller, so over the past years they have created the down draft. At some point they have to cover and then they will run into trouble. For long term holders getting a nice dividend the only thing that is important is whether the balance sheet is improving, is revenue stabilizing (it is) and are they continuing to buy back stock aggressively as they reduce inventory and property, which they seem to be."
"Man this one wants to bust out, as soon as the few sellers wash away. Those pullbacks to 17.75 won't last much longer against the uptrend. Shoppers have been needing to transition to Summer outfits. They made their decision last fall if they would shop this Spring or not. Those old shorts and t's were tossed before COVID came, and doesn't change the demand."
"Wow, I am back. I was thinking of trading this between 36 and 43 as I did years ago. Now it has gone even further below."
$2.20/share profit !! WOW!! Dividend restored and approved by board of directors. They even will start buying back shares making everyone's shares worth more because fewer shares outstanding!! I estimates total yearly earnings at $5/share possible!!! At a PE of 15 stock is worth at least $75/share!! Expect dividend increases yearly!!
"50s , 60s and a juicy dividend!"
"Today is a very interesting trading day. It looks like the shorts tried to drive it down again after the open but they have failed. Further, being up 4.5% on just 1.6M shares (remember that early volume) simply goes to show that the shorts have this all wrong. There is no supply of buyers ready to sell. The shorts and the companies buyback over the last months have taken out any real sellers and now, if the short position as grown again, have loaded the spring for a significant move hire if the shorts finally give up. It is going to be very interesting as I don't think they can allow the stock to run into earnings without covering because Kohl's will have a very good story to tell come earnings, especially if they have been buying back shares more aggressively than their $300-$400M guidance."
hope Kohls insiders start buying in Unison and bury the shorts in used covid masks -- get em Insiders!!!!!!
"Wanted to like KSS for the dividend, but this feels like a trap is being set! Retail Box Stores! Nah uh!"
Target fell less than Kohl's .... I guess you have to miss earnings to win in this race
One more thing about the debt. Currently Kohl’s has a credit rating a couple of notches above Investment Grade. Lowering or pushing out the date of debt will help keep Kohl’s from having a costly downgrade below IG. It is worth the expense of buying back debt and of course not to add new debt at this time. Macy’s credit rating has been recently confirmed a couple notches above Kohl’s and Nordstroms credit rating is one notch above Kohl’s.
Covid cases are going up daily and with thanksgiving next week people are becoming nonchalant about wearing masks and might worry less about catching or spreading the virus with mass inoculation on the horizon. Investors are underestimating the continued threat of the coronavirus. If there is another nationwide lock down it will tip companies over the edge over the coming weeks and months. With no guarantee of a second stimulus there could be a tough few months before an economic recovery takes hold.
This has barely fallen compared to rest of retail. Dangerous and risky entry point right here.
Looking positive into earnings. Gl longs!
Kohl's is down 6.52% to 30.38
"You don't cut people because sales are up, but there will probably be a bump up tomorrow."
OMG! Are you taking advantage of these free trade alerts? If not there literally has to be something wrong with you. go to (http://Multistockalerts.com) now.
"My guess is that if we bounce later today that the shorts whacked it so they could do some covering. We get an update on the short position as of 5/15 later this week, then we will have to wait to see what the status is port earnings. Kohl's was heavily shorted prior to these earnings, so the fact that the stock was down compared to pre Q4 earnings is basically due to that. My guess is that today we got short hit pretty hard early and the question is now do they cover on this nice short term gain or do they think this can drift lower? JCP is clearly in trouble and the stock will go to zero as they will be forced to refinance their debt. Sears is also closing 40 more stores than earlier this year. So clearly the weaklings are dying and the question is really how fast.Bon Ton will be gone come Q3 and Q4 and that should provide a nice boost later in the year."
Any reason why KSS is down so much despite decent results.
What the heck is going on with almost a 3% drop? My wife and I shop Kohl's and traffic has surprisingly picked up. Parking lot has quite a good number of cars. Pure profit taking??
Word over at JCP is that Amazon is in talks tonight with JCP... May be an acquisition....?
Please keep in mind this low stock price was artificially created by your govt shutting #$%$ down - so keep quiet till everyone is back to work .. stock will float backUp over 30 just on economy opening
"Closeout ""up to 85% off"" items might have more net value as donations because not much of that stuff is selling."
CNBC said to buy this yesterday
I so want to go to Kohl's with people walking around wearing masks and coughing!
KSS is down 6.58% to 32.37
Up .63 cents ^^^^ at 2:50 p.m. LOOKING BETTER
Over at SKT (Tanger Outlets) we feel for you guys as well. Pulled down every time a completely unrelated retailer takes a hit.
Kohl's is down 6.68% to 29.50
KSS getting pumped right now on CNBC!!
With bbb huge beat I sure would not short Kohl’s ... 
Soon we get our first dividend payment and of course the capital gains are great too.
Falling as there is no tomorrow !!!!
Excellent results. Strong cash position with 1 94 billion in cash.Completely paid off their revolving credit bill. Great inventory position with inventories dropping as sales are excellent. Very good management and execution.Dividend to be restored early next year. Patient investors will be richly rewarded.
They like to pump up premarket to give a false hope and then they'll likely let it fall during the open unless the market breaks up through its resistance.
and another down day
"New here. I was a sucker yesterday and bought some. Bought some more today to average down. It looks like just normal trading range and I happened to buy at the top opps. I hope I don't have to buy some at 17, but I'll stick around for a few months to see how it goes. GLTA"
"When buying stocks, one must have an investment horizon of at least 5 years and ignore daily moves.Basic investment premise is solid with regard to this investment.Insanely underpriced temporarily due to covid nonsense that wont exist soon.Remember its an investment not a trade. You lose nothing if the stock rises or drops in price on a daily basis, because the long term prospects of the company are solid.Great long term investment. Dollar average and diversify your investments."
"After the shutdown Kohls will be back in business. All they need to do is use a forhead temperature thermometer at the door before letting people inside. As well, store clerks and floor managers will keep a six foot distance. The shutdown will give Kohls plenty of time to buy PPE for their stores employees. If they cut their dividend they could slash merchandise prices accordingly."
"So Stoxx is selling us a two for one story, higher inflation and gasoline prices will crush the consumer. 1st higher oil prices are already captured in higher inflation, so he is really just selling the story that higher inflation (which at 2% isn't high at all) is going to crush the consumer. This is simply nonsense. Further, our energy industry is growing rapidly, so as long as energy prices stay up there is ZERO chance of a recession anytime soon, indeed we might have a multi year expansion ahead of proportions we have never seen before. Then there is the national debt, it doesn't matter if wealth is growing at a faster pace AND if nominal GDP outpaced debt growth. Both of these are currently at play. The debt scare stories is just more Obama loving liberals trying to convince the American voter population to commit financial suicide by voting the Democrats back into Congress, that worked so well from 2007 to 2011 you know."
Strong Buy once again!
"$46.22 another day, another new low for Kohls!Who's dumb enough to hold the bag for this dying business model? Seriously?"
"After opt exp tomorrow & the robots settle down , expect to get back to the highs as these prices will force inst. to buy, esp at a decent dividend rate..."
Going out of Business soon
Impressed with new hire for CTO.
"Historically, this stock is at a price level that says fire sale! 52 week high alone is around $60/share.Only reason it is temporarily at this price is covid."
clubber is not impressed with this computer algo buying these trashy retailers on monday.
"From the retail sales data we saw that sales were increasing in line with the growth in income and the growth in employment. It will be interesting to see if we also start to notice the tax cuts in coming months as consumers have plenty of cash to spend. So watch the income growth numbers in the monthly labor reports and the actual employment growth. They tell you how much new money there is that can flow into retail and clearly so far we are seeing the American consumer true to form, spend it."
"Goldman Sachs says the stocks like KSS and Macys went up in May and June while FANG stocks dropped because of the ending of Covid scenario.When covid started to rise again that rally ended and FANG rose again.They say investors are under estimating the impact a vaccine and ending of covid will have on FANG stocks and stocks like Macys and kss WILL RISE while FAND plunges.Today we see that again. FANG stocks are very overbought while stocks like KSS and Macys are heavily oversold. Macys and KSS stocks hit the hardest because of covid will rise the fastest.Like today we see them rising as FANG plunges. It is inevitable! Normal cycling Vaccines are real and they work and will indeed end the covid crisis soon returning life to normal for KSS and Macys. Back to consistent profits with far fewer competitors.Macys says $10 billion of sales bankrupt competitors can be theirs to pocket. Lord and Taylor gone, Penny gone and many, many others leaving the strongest one left like KSS the biggest department store with 1158 stores in every state but Hawaii to prosper and grow taking up the sales of the dead retailers."
KSS Board and CEO does not need help from backward activists!!
Conference must not be going so well. Something negative was said. Back to $60
Now people are buying KSS stocks like crazy because they want to ride the train to the sky.... Look everything down but KSS up. That means insider information leaked about huge earning and people are BUYING this.
That was quick!!
Interesting this went to 19.70 on 04/17/20. Now falls to 15.60 so a 4.00 drop since then. October 2020 calls are calling my name LOL
"isn't it bullish for kss if jcp,m, and sears go belly up!?... bought at 35.77 today. GREAT Company"
In my opinion KSS is down because of the Amazon JCP rumors and not because of the earnings. Too bad for Amazon if they go through with that acquisition. I did not have any expectations from Amazon on KSS acquisition anyways.
Stay calm KSS stockholders.
P/E is very low and the Kohl’s already gave a guidance. Worth to buy - this is the only store left all around the country. Donot under estimate.
The Wuhan Chinese virus cannot be stopped as China surrounds Taiwan. China maritime accelleration comes when the Aircraft Carrier Theodore Roosevelt is docked and out of commission with 600 sailors ill from the Chinese virus.
Going Going gone $3 bucks today
"Hilarious!!! I bought 5,000 back in April! Paid $12.50, chaaaaching."
$100 here we come!
Is this going up or what?
Big sell off coming of this overvalued stock. KSS headed to 10.00 or lower. P/E is absurd for a retail brick and mortar business.
KSS reached a 52 Week low at 15.79
"thiswillhave ascaryscary crashcrashbelow $12 ,they lost to walmart and target, a bad bad double bad whammy it goingto get worst in q3 and q4 ,notgoingto get better"
"Kohl’s is definitely one of the stronger retail picks. Not associated with malls that I am aware of, strong on-line sales, and Amazon relationship is a plus. Not to mention it’s still well off it’s highs. Wish I had held my $15 shares longer but in again now and holding long."
"Way oversold. I think once the next stimulus package is announced next week followed by the first vaccine shortly after the election and then when everyone realizing that most people already had a minor version of the virus already, this thing will be back up 25-50% or more. Very low downside risk right now (was at $17.50 six months ago), and huge upside in the short term ($24-29+)"
"The real reason why $AMZN was lagging versus the market is because everyone investing in small cap, that's suicidal, investing in the likes of $KSS when no one will be shopping with them. If you hold $AMZN stock, don't sell, all the analysts I've heard are saying this stock is the GE of our generation, the amount they invested in R&D will establish it as a juggernaut so no worries about it, even at this price everyone agrees it is a BUY."
"KSS had impressive quarterly results in the 2nd quarter far exceeding my expectations.All their stores forced to stay closed by the government for 50% of the time and yet their sales and profits were very impressive! Remember too, they were open at reduced hours too with the headwinds of covid, with governments asking people to stay home too. IMPRESSIVE Indeed.Per GAAP, they posted POSITIVE CASH FLOW! A profit that quarter!Incredible!This 3rd quarter ALL their stores will be open for 100% of this quarter, though at reduced hoursshould post again very positive cash flow - PROFIT!"
This stock will break $60 when earnings are announced and the shorts have to cover the March dividend.
KSS is up 4.91% to 71.73
Once the short squeeze is over this is going back to sub $20. I hate to tell you guys but Kohls is not the next Amazon. They are the next Blockbuster!
"about a year ago or so the talk was about Amazon buying Kohls any thoughts on this now,the stock and company are doing ok"
Just ask yourself where would you rather shop Kohl's or TJ Maxx a store full of things that didn't sell well at other stores. I'm not convinced these 2 are comparable like CNBC suggests. certainly not for the shoppers I know
Anybody know what the effects of the common stock will be when the “ high dividend “ etfs are forced to sell because of the suspended dividend ?
oh no its too early to bounce off. omg
BOYCOTTING AMAZON YET? or just watching while Amazon takes down America. Amazon and Bezos are both cheapskates contributing almost nothing to recent disasters.
Amazon has warrants to purchase up to 1.7 million shares of KSS at $69.68 per share. Just something to think about as we approach that level......
this gonna go up today as ppl add to get dividend tomorrow?
KSS short interest yesterday was through the roof: https://fintel.io/ss/us/kss
"If the stock price goes much lower, wouldn't surprise me if Amazon doesn't make an offer."
I am out.. get out of u still in it. It will close near 39
Nordstrom is soulless
"They finally posted the short position for 5/15 and it increased 2.4M on Kohl's, the XRT data isn't there so I can't say how much they shorted that. Given that the stock dropped from $71 to $64 in that time it is clear they can do a lot of damage. The big question now is did they continue to short post earnings miss, likely, or did they cover? Given the price action being so negative, my guess is they were piling on. This is actually some positive news as it likely will explain why the stock dropped so much and that once they stop shorting it should rebound, likely back to the high $50's or low $60 level. This would seem only logical as Dillard's now trades at a higher price despite a much worse outlook than Kohl's. So I think we likely will recover some here if the stock markets don't continue to sell off. In any case, once we see the 5/31 results in June we will know which way they went. Remember, the damage from shorting has now been done, all that is left is the benefit when/if they ever cover. Given that Kohl's was pretty clear in the CC that they would continue their stock buyback, at some point there will be a fun game of chicken that should work out positively for shareholders. Of course if the sector continues to deteriorate we likely have to get through a recession later this year or early next year first. My guess is with growing energy production a recession is not possible."
how come KSS trades so violently up and down compared to similar retail?
"Really? To you who support overthrowing our government. I applaud Kohl's for dropping a would-be insurrectionist's product line. If he'd just voted for Trump and then accepted the results of a free and fair election, he and his company would have been just fine-he crossed the line and did this to himself."
This market is becoming a complete joke. It acts exactly like a casino for high rollers.
Kohl should also have robot  to serve the customers
The next Enron?
$47.41 low water mark for the day already set!Soon will see $46.'s and below! Another earnings miss and it's all over!
"I wonder if Amazon is looking to take them over at a huge discount..Strategy: Make sure they are a nonessential business, so that the shares get driven down even more in a few months.. Then Amazon can take over the stores, and virus problem goes away.."
I just read Trump extended tariffs on Canada. I wonder how that will play out for KSS with them being a Canadian based business....Not to mention tariffs with China.
"kss is not trading, the ticker is manipulated and false, just ticking numbers, not real."
"These are really nice stores located away from malls, in affluent areas. These qualities tend to minimize the riff raff you usually encounter at the malls."
"E a lack of buying interest is keeping the stock down, that likely means the shorts are still in control of the stock and not yet ready to throw in the towel and cover. Taking it down after an open pop is very normal for this stock and it usually is a sign that the shorts are interested in covering or at least keeping the stock from running. I think tomorrow we will find out how much their shorted before earnings, unfortunately we have to wait till 12/11 to find out how much they shorted after earnings and how much they may have covered. Analysts are also very bearish right now on brick and mortar and we will have to wait for the Cyber Monday hype to pass and the real facts to come out about retail sales in November. That again puts us into the middle of December for people to realize Kohl's is a cash generating machine and deserves a higher valuation. So patience is in order. Also, realistically with Kohl's stock down more than 20% and entering a bear market it may take as much as a year for the company to set new highs. That is unfortunate but for long term holders it simply means Kohl's can buy back more shares at a cheaper price. Long term investors are looking for the day that shorts have covered and Kohl's can demonstrate its sustainable long term earnings growth plus the normalization of depreciation expenses with CapEx, which takes years."
"Looks like they are finally covering, 1.34M shares so far since the 10/1 - 10/15 period. That means that now the buyback, which should start again post earnings, won't need to be sucking up new short shares first. That should give the stock a strong upward bias going into the end of the year, especially if the shorts continue to cover."
Time to back up the truck and load up on kss stock!
This shutdown is the final nail in the coffin or retailers. It's a tragedy. People are being forced to adopt new consumer habits. People who never would have done e-commerce are now doing e-commerce. This is dragging6on long enough it will become a habit. Ingrained. The retailers had it tough battling ecommerce before. This is the coup de grat
23.81 top band 21.16 bottom band support 22.60 on the 20 day
Bit disappointed. Thought price would be closer to $58.50 today.
Strong Buy!
"Solid bounce off of where the stock should have bounced on a sizable retracement. The run to $80 is now likely on before earnings and if it fails we could get another retest of this support level. I think if the market turned south in Sep/Oct we would break below it, but I don't really see that happening. So likely we take a run at $80 before earnings, fail to break it and then go back to test this high $60's levels before later this fall taking out the $80 level, likely before Q3 earnings."
"Can't get my post to stick, but there is an article out there that Amazon returns has driven up Kohl's customer traffic by 24%; customers staying in store for longer than 16 mins up 14%."
I love short shorts!
"So just an interesting point on the CC transcript. Kohl's new management seems to be very focused on debt reduction as opposed to what they said, i.e. that they would return all excess cash to shareholders. So the buyback has been rather anemic so far this year at just 2.5M shares yes they are even buying back debt in the open market. To me this says they are very paranoid about missing earnings estimates and are doing everything they can to bolster EPS numbers by reducing debt payments. This isn't bad, but it clearly signals that management is in it for themselves and not so much for the shareholders. They should have been much more aggressive with the stock buyback in Q2 given the pricing they had on the stock price.Overall they are making a lot of progress and their large to small footprint hasn't even started throwing off cash from leases, so a bright future if the economy can stay strong."
Need to announce and do buyback to bring it back to 50s. Or we just have to wait and collect ~$3 dividend a year.
"According to Kohls store locator, 107 stores are still closed. Here's the list so you can check yourself: store number 33,71,162,188,189,190,255,263,265,267,273,274,275,276,277,278,280,282,286,298,315,325,333,337,338,339,343,359,374,376,377,378,379,380,393,394,395,396,397,411,417,418,424,431,479,505,516,528,529,530,531,532,535,536,539,540,546,551,554,574,575,581,587,625,639,655,664,681,691,692,694,729,740,765,766,767,769,781,782,973,986,988,991,1045,1047,1048,1065,1068,1133,1156,1167,1174,1246,1277,1283,1328,1355,1395,1405,1411,1454,1457,1466,1476,1480,1484,1506"
Time to buy. I just did...
...and there is the drop at the open...
"My experience with men’s casual shirts is illustrative of the Kohl problem. Used to buy the polyester Hawaiian print types for warm weather and vacations. Several years ago the quality took a serious turn south. Multiple shirts of the same Kohl private label and the same size all fit differently. Horribly inconsistent. After returns and rebuys and retry so all fit, after one or two washings they would fall apart or shrink badly. Just zero effective quality control. The second tier brands are ok...but no bargain. Available many places for far less everyday than the Kohl “regular” price from which they heavily discount. Marking merchandise high in order to offer big sale discounts doesn’t work any longer when competitor everyday pricing checks are a click away.Turning into a more promotional 1980 style JCPenneys with iffy quality house brand products and very old school marketing practices. A shame because a few years ago this place was seen as an off mall winner. Something happened and management may be the culprit. They still make Money...unlike JCP. Time for a management change perhaps, before a turnaround is doomed."
"Lot of hate still in retail, but with JCP and Sears soon to be history, who do you think will fill in the void? The spoils accrue to the strong. Buy M!"
Amazon is definitely going to buy Kohl's. When does everyone think it will happen? Merger Monday?
"On 3/11 we will find out what the short position was just prior to the earnings release. I think there was some covering on the 1st and the 3rd, but not that much. Today we certainly will have had some covering, my guess around 800,000 shares. That should still leave us with a load of shares for shorts to cover to drive the price up.Realistically Kohl's will earn well north of $6 in 2019 and that means at some point this year we see a $90+ stock price. I think there is also a good chance we see $100 on a real short squeeze, i.e. when the shorts finally decide they no longer want to be short on Kohl's and that 25+M short position gets back down below 5M where it should be."
Looks like Short Covering
Amazon 3rd quarter as it concerns Kohl’s. Amazon has stopped gaining online share over the brick and mortar stores.Amazon has no response to the Omni channel yet. When asked on the CC no mention was made of the deal with Kohl’s. Amazon is having a problem with Whole Foods. Sales continue to decline while they just gave everyone a raise there. Amazon retail continues to be more and more dependent on third party sales (53%) that will need to start collecting sales tax next year.
I was getting sick and tired of getting creamed in the markets and then I joined this one website I found online and the picks have been awesome. If you want solid stock tips delivered to your inbox all you need to do is go to https://stockdorkalerts.blogspot.com/ .
JCP closing 242 stores. USATODAY article.
"KSS downgraded and price target lowered to $40 and yet on a day like today it goes up, go figure"
"I am a Retailer, small-time mind you, but a Retailer. I successfully compete in a 70B with every competitor at my door. I am excited about Kohls and its management because they have it right. They understand their value proposition, have a good balance between brick and online, and their balance sheet is reasonable. Sales can go flat from time to time as part of normal trends."
"Retail sales figures just released for June. Online sales at Amazon down 2.5 percent while clothing sales at brick and mortar stores UP by a record 105 percent! WOW!!!As I said, it is all nonsense the hype that ONLINE is taking over brick and mortar retail.People will always be reluctant to buy clothes online. It is a simple human trait that just cannot be overcome.Currently, 75 percent of all clothing sales annually are at brick and mortar stores. Online cannot penetrate anymore than it has now down. Even with a shut down of all brick and mortar stores people refused to buy clothes online. Instead the numbers prove people chose to wait until their brick and mortar store opened and delayed clothing purchases.Proof positive that the online hype is way overblown. Way too negative on brick and mortar retailers.The strong who survive like Macys and Kohls will have less competition as the weak retailers go out of business and they will take over their sales.JCPenny gone, Brooks gone, Arrow gone and so on....Macys and Kohls are the winners here. Huge gains in their stock expected over the next months and years.Amazon is realizing too that it must buy brick and mortar to gain market share.Online is limited in potential forever.Macys and Kohls are takeover targets by Amazon too.Then of course the shorts have gone way out on the limb and heavily betting against them.Short squeeze set up."
they do have online store open right????? stock oversold like they completely shut down.......
We will see $3 in few days - Sell short
"Mike Lidell and most retailers dropping his products are because his products are LOW QUALITY and HIGH PRICED and they are just a FAD that the consumer is avoiding. ON TOP Of that this moron, poor businessman MIKE LIDELL has offended and annoyed most Americans with his insane delusional crazy political stance!!Politics has no place in business - wake up Mike Lidell! Go see a psychiatrist!!"
Seems selling has dried up...hope it bounces hard
"they are coming out with a new cosmetic line, it could be bogus but ir ead somewhere that it could be kyle skin or possibly kim kardashians line. anyone heard this? wow, wouldnt that be cool..."
"I'm buying now for next years share price , 300%plus dividend !"
"I'm loving this, but can someone explain?!"
There goes my 5% yield
It’s funny how talkative this board is when the stock goes up. But when the stock is down it’s quiet. Where are all those people convinced the stock was going to $30 in a week? I thought Amazon was buying kohls? If that was true do you think the stock would be at a 6 month low going back to $10?
in 2 weeks when the news groups show kohl's packed with shoppers and the restaurant eating away Las vegas gambling away ! hope you didn't forget to stock up!
First stock Warren Buffet bought with his sister at about $40/share.Immediately it dropped to $27/share and especially his sister was concerned so when it rose to $41 giving them a small profit they sold it all.Later the company bought back the shares at $212/share.Warren Buffet learned from that mistake to be more patient and not to be tempted to take a small profit when with patience a far greater gain would be his.A word to the wise regarding KSS stock.
can anyone explain what is happening now? going from 69.48 down to 66.30? Thanks. is it a time to buy more or is there something i'm missing?
5 buck stock. Macy's out of business in 6 months. No more stores for them to close.
"FWIW, yesterday our local kohl's was packed and the parking lot overflowing almost like it was early black Friday. Lot's of shoppers for the Veteran's day sales. Very encouraging."
Back up the truck
"Why the sudden reversal in pre-market?, Anyone!"
"well, almost $46, watch for the huge selloff tomorrow"
"Bought a little today we will see what happens, come on amazon make an offer"
Lowered entry from 42 to 38-39
Zero pricing power. That’s the problem. Stay away
"Most mutual funds, Index funds and even ETFs are expected to yield poor to negative returns next yearas post covid life returns. The winners next year will be those most hit hard this year by covid and the winners this year will next years losers."
Love the 50s and 60s. They were great times - soon to come again for KSS - the 70s are even better!!
buy at the open 2morrow
"Actually, a good article from Fool yesterday as it relates to Shopko BK. Lots of overlap between Shopko and KSS locations, especially in the Midwest, so this should definitely create a boost for KSS once the Shopko stores start to shut down."
"Ha, Macys is such a pc of garbage it affected this one. Don't worry Kohls is fine, M has a disease."
WOW Did you see the 60cent manipulated push in 5 minutes right before Lunch-FIXED!!
"So later today we will get the short position report for 5/31. It should tell us some very important things, for one it looks like there was heavy shorting going into the Memorial Day weekend as oil prices continued to rise (this is actually normal). Further, the resignation of the JCP CEO and bailing for another company was taken as a big short signal. So the question will be how much did the short position on XRT, M, JCP and KSS increase. If it did not increase, especially on Kohl's, it would simply be an indication that smart shorts took advantage of the selloff to pare their positions. This would be the most positive scenario as it likely indicated that covering has continued since and we will see that with the 6/15 report out later this month. Of course the other scenario is that we saw heavy shorting and it wasn't till oil prices reverse that the shorts even started to cover. That would mean very little of the short position on Kohl's will have covered by now but it also raises the possibility that they have no interest in covering. That you will see if we move up on very low volume as the momentum of the recent move up fades (if it wasn't short covering supported).So by tomorrow morning we shall have some insights, I think the best news would be to see increases on all those mentioned but a slight decrease on Kohl's."
"This stock terrifies me....falls on an elevator and climbs or at least pretends to, on an escalator. Any bad headlines, tanks."
"Never buy above 20.00, you will be a bag holder. If you bought below 20 and don't sell above 20 watch your profits evaporate every time."
If we are to go off the RSI then you could argue that a pull back next day or so could occur on KSS before rallying up. have you guys heard of awesomeSTO-CKS. i started receiving their allerts and so far i am happy.
This is a mess...new dividend safe thru 2020?
What an opportunity was to buy this during pandemic at 12$... I have actively selling covered calls on this and was very profitable pre pandemic. Held through it and recently sold around 60s. Not sure how far can this go but I'm fine with taking profit now. Do you think it has more room to go?
Just shorted 5000 shares of this garbage. See you at 10.00 or lower after shocking terrible earnings. This is the next JC Penney. Will be a penny stock soon.
"The dividend will be the first to go when they start to see sales really plummet,no safety in dividend protection here or any retail stock for that matter,it's sit at home and shop!"
Gildan Activewear (GIL) today reinstated FULL pre-pandemic dividend. Why does Kohl's talk about a $2B buyback but won't talk about paying a full pre-pandemic dividend?
Very nice experience taking Amazon return to Kohl's. When did that start?
Kohls stores are like ghosttowns. No shoppers
smells like Mervyns 2.0. Executives milking it prior to getting booted.. Poor store performance not meeting goals.. Kohls will get obliterated with $15/hr min wage hike to boot.. Jump ship now.
Dividend will be announced very soon! CEO said last year they plan to resumethe dividend starting in the first quarter of 2021 - that is soon.
"this is one of the worst stocks. it will fall as the current pandemic continues. UBS downgrade from Neutral to Sell and price cut from 17.5 to 14 is another indication the company is under huge pressure. Retail business will be affected when you have 40 mil unemployed, ~4mil infected. if you wait and see till 08/18 earnings call will beat the price back to teens where it actually belong."
Stores reopened in CT 2 days ago and have been DEAD. Aside from food and home improvement stores every other business around has been a ghost town including local malls.
when are earnings tomorrow before or after market
I told you ladies dept.needs new merchandiser
I still think Amazon will buy kohls would work out well for them. hold long.
Time to pick up some more. :)
"Best shopping in my area is Kohls. Safe, non mall locations. Sears, Kmart, JCP all closed, so more traffic to Kohls. It's either Kohls for nicer stuff, poor selection/quality at Target, or fight the crowds and Covid for whatever is at Walmart. Kohls will have great holiday season."
See you guys back at 16!
@Gerhard. KSS is a little too high for a buyer right now isn't it.
They should give away kohls cash with every return and get people shopping.
"Time to SELL, COVID will drop price,ran as far as it could, buy back at 25."
"I have sooooo much confidence we will soon have a pop...Sooooo many reasons:1. Rumors...rumors AMZN buying Kohl's will sooner or later February - May2. Rumors... rumors Kohl's is partnering with AMZN 365 to fill the 30,000 sq ft. void on the downside stores before earnings report.3. Rumors...rumors Kohl's is partnering with Kroger, Trader Joe's4. Earnings Report confirms blowout quarter and partnering with AMZN365"
"Keeping trying 4mvp but today the stock price movement said you are going to get burned. Down on low volume and recovered. The only way you can make this stock go down is to short more and shorts only look like they are winning after they short, they just don't know how much money they are going to lose until they cover."
Want to own KSS shares in 2020? If so have patience and wait for $9/s price when the next crash washout unfolds...place your gtc but orders at $9
is this more shorting? or just some profit taking?
Macy is better buy with diviend yield 5% . Today is last day to get macy diviend .
Kohl's is up 10.24% to 58.10
I sat on the fence for 3 weeks about joining (http://Stocks-tracker.com) for their weekly picks. Big mistake. KSS exploded and I completely missed out. Don’t make the same mistake I made. Join them today.
"I think the recovery in the stock price on such low volume clearly is signaling that it takes shorting to drive it down. There are just not many sellers when analysts are rapidly taking up their earnings estimates and the stock now actually trades at a significant discount if you look at market level P/E ratios and 2018 earnings. This will become totally obvious come earnings on the 1st of March. I mean the guy at $6.25 for 2018 may just be off by a year, as 10+% earnings growth, supported by aggressive stock buybacks, can get us to such numbers quickly."
"Kohl's is going to benefit big time from Kmart/Sears close outs in the future. I know a lot of people near me used to be diehard Kmart fans, but now they shop at Kohl's and love it."
The next JCPENNEY
85 bucks by year end hold
shorters are jumping now
Macys is next retailer stock to get white hot soon!
Never understand why people continue to buy retail. Single digits and then bankruptcy coming for kss. Just a question of when not if.
"and don't you know this will drop even faster than it went up, the speculators have made their money"
"Is it buy or sell time for $MU , $CRM , $KSS , $NFLX , $SNES ? http://crweworld.com/article/news-provided-by-pr-newswire/304904/is-it-buy-or-sell-time-for-salesforce-kohls-micron-netflix-and-senestech-inc"
The bottom is not here yet for any stocks so be patient and buy at a bargain.
"Two problems I've experience with Kohl's. I used to shop there frequently but their men's clothing lacks style and quality, even more so now. Also, when you a large seller of clothing....DON'T CLOSE YOUR DRESSING ROOMS. I've moved on to Von Maur and higher quality Dept. Stores and now understand the difference in higher quality pants and shirts. A little more but well worth it."
10 bucks coming soon After those earnings
Don't fight the technicals...trading below the MA on the 5 day
Just left a Kohl’s store and I overheard some employees talking about some stores closing. Anyone have any information on that?
"Kohls in our area (SJ) open and parking lot full , long lines at checkout !"
Best opportunity to buy at these fire sale prices. JMHO of course.
well this is what I get for waiting.... I will never understand the stock market...how the hell does the stock rise when the company isn't even open.....
10.00 after earnings report.
Oil prices 2% down. People will drive to retail centers. Political news are good. Trump meeting with Kim as planned. Job reports good. Next week will be 5% up
just bought some more cheap shares thanks and good luck!
"Individual investors indeed can beat the market. KSS is a perfect example of an undervalued stock that disproves the theory of efficient markets.All the time some stocks are grossly overvalued and others insanely undervalued.The markets have always been that way.Eventually these errors in valuation are corrected, but contrary to efficient markets theory these corrections are not quick often but sometimes last long periods.KSS and TSLA are perfect examples of undervalued and overvalued stocks needing massive correction in vakuation."
CNBC Fast Money folks are a joke. They have a 43% track record on stocks they rate as shop it or drop it. Guy is most of the time guessing or uses a Quija board.
If the retail and department stores also would be afforded the high valuation of tech stocks. None of them were going bankrupt. All tech stock have EV/Revenue above 10 and department store UK under 1. If market were giving them the same valuation they could have raised money to get rid off their debt and much more.
So the Amazon partnership is not helping..
ruh roh. looks like the momentum trade is over. where is the next support level?
"Kohls bonds are doing great. Most are north of $100. Hoping to see great progress on significantly or completely repaying the revolver this quarter, setting the stage for dividend payments by years' end."
You shorts are in the wrong position with this stock.Unlimited losses is you future.
Buying more here. This puppy is headed to over 70 soon.
"Interesting article, worth a read:https://www.yahoo.com/finance/news/layoffs-hit-4-year-high-in-2019-challenger-gray-data-says-190116585.htmlThe stats seem to show a sizable reduction in the number of layoffs in retail which might well be signalling that the shift to the internet is starting to run its course. Most of the layoffs last year came from stores going bankrupt, so that is still there but if you are a retailer that isn't going bankrupt it seems you may well have weathered the storm."
Looks like we are heading to 55 just like I had expected.
12.5 percent SEEMS an overreaction. Hoping for the $57/58 close tmrw that we were gonna get today before that analyst piped up.
"On CNBC interview the interviewer indicated that last year this time Kohl's had $700M in Cash, now this quarter they all of a sudden have $2B in Cash. Where did they come up with all that cash?? Not from great sales last year, they were ok, but not enough to almost triple your cash. Think there is some shenanigans in the financial Dept."
"The Activist Investors’ slate includes only one current or former public company CEO, while Kohl’s Board includes five!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Buh Bye Kohls!
Did not line that pull back .. ugh
"I hate when I'm right ALL the time!Another day, another new low for KSS!$45.'S NEXT STOP!"
Its been a long time this looks like a marriage
This Stock looks like it could be one of those crazy short squeeze situations.
Adding to short 2000 at .60
"Typical pattern for KSS earnings announcement, just so you can all prepare for next week: If they miss expectations, PPS will tank. If they meet expectations, price will tank. If they exceed expectations, price will tank. KSS can never win on an earnings announcement. Only way the price takes off is if I sell before earnings, and I’m planning to hold, so that won’t work!"
Boycotting Amazon yet?
Good time to buy?
It’s for Amazon.

"8,000 calls bought today with 4 days expiration... what's the news"
glad I listened to Jim Cramer and didn't buy in teens 
"Well, I guess shorts got lucky today with this ridiculous overreaction. Better cover while you still can. You won’t be happy when we’re back at PPS of $80."
the low was 40.46?
Disappointing earnings to say the least. So what does this mean to the share price needs to be seen.
"Interesting price action this morning as it started off slow despite the DOW's spike at the open. We are ex dividend today, so that accounts for 61 cents of the price movement. As is volume is fairly anemic yet we are up a reasonable amount, that seems to indicate no shorting and of course a lack of selling. It also signals a lack of buying but that might change as the stock price moves back up. Later today we will find out the short position as of 11/30 which will give us some insight into how we got taken down. Hopefully they used the sell-offs late last month to reduce their short positions as we saw in the prior report. That would be a positive and would set up the stock for moving up from these levels as the sellers seem to now finally be exhausted."
Great buying opportunity today!
I won't suggest to buy now
"Omnichannel: The case of HYPE and Reality of growing from Zero...KSS and other retailers touted their omnichannel strategy last Holiday and boasted the significant increase in their e-commerce operation as proof that they too can do what Amazon does very well. Well, the hype was during the last holiday where it seems all the starts were aligned properly for there retailers as the benefit of tax cuts and lackluster prior years resulted in better than expected holidays sales. But But wait, there was an extra weekend and retailers had planned to scaled back inventory so in essence they got lucky. If you look at KSS's holiday numbers very closely, they really did not git the ball out of park, they merely did not disappoint and with the fresh GOP tax cut ahead of them, the share price rose in anticipation of the benefits thereof. As for the ""significant"" rise in their e-commerce operation...well, if you didn't have any to speak of then any rise from that is in fact ""significant"". We will soon see the rise in KSS's e-commerce was one-off. We will soon see that athletisure which they touted as their saving grace has now been adopted by everyone else. We will soon see that the benefit of the tax break from 38% to 21% is not enough to offset weak sales. We will soon see the retailers are once again unloved as prognosticators will point to Amazon, consumer over extended, rising fuel prices reducing consumer expenditures of apparel, as well as rising interest rate worrying the consumer."
A small rally up to dividend and drop?
"Sorry shorts, KSS is going to finish in green today."
@artie is spot on below. KSS has been reduced to a play toy for day traders. sad. a great American company. painful to follow this stock daily.
"In the second half of August the short interest increased significantly by 3M shares to 23.2M. This likely accounts for our ride to sub $45 and likely some of the pop we have gotten lately as that will have been shorts covering a wrong bet. With the yield curve no longer inverted, the signal that it portends a recession is busted, that signal also requires a 3 month inversion, not just a short term one. The dividend is also payed, so we have recovered from the lows by over $7 already, nearly 15%. Friday will be interesting as I think retail sales will be strong as the consume is flush with jobs and growing pay."
Good day so far...expecting $23+ close
Aldi inside Waukesha Wisconsin Kohl’s started hiring.
"Wow, big run up for $KSS. Still a tramp but happier today."
"Option alert : July 17.2020 22.50 calls volume 6,273 open interest 796"
It’s a mess now. No short squeeze .these investors are destroying Kohl’s.
There could even be another stimulus getting approved before the election. Both parties want one and at this point I don't think it matters much politically one way or the other if it gets approved
My short from yesterday is so juicy. Easy money
"more short covering or what, is retail suddenly hot again?"
"Hey Ruiz you were right it went to 11.00, dummy."
"$50, yeah!"
Shorts i and confused
Good thing is I think we now know resistance at $58-$60 is strong in this stock after two weeks ago and Tuesday.
Looks appealing off > 30% but you take a look under the hood and see this thing is a flopping fish out of water. Saying there are significantly better things/places for your $ is an understatement. IMO
"Khols should shrink it's footprint around the Chicago area and reduce the number of stores quickly and their size. I personally don't shop at Khols any more in large b/c their employees do not speak english. Retailers need to reduce sq.ft and the number of products at brick and motar and expand online and relocate their h.q. to where it is cheaper to operate like Texas, Flint, Michigan or Oklahoma why they would be h.q in nyc or chicago makes no economic sense and is bad for the bottom line."

"Time to load up if there ever was one. I can wait for sanity to prevail. We get 5% dividend to boot. All in all a win win situation,"
Makes me wonder if a certain life insurance company owned most of the 9.5% bonds. Can't make sense of it any other way what were they thinking?
I will hold this stock. It will rise later. Today overall market is afraid of going down and people are holding cash. THat's why
Will shorts finally start to cover ? The insider selling not an issue now .
"If you go by the chart, get ready to sell when it hits $22.5 or to close your Calls. $22.5 has been the resistance several times recently."
W O W....what is happening here today ?
Why is everyone so bullish on this turd? I know it will go lower because everyone is bullish. A stock doesn't bottom when everyone is bullish. When it hits $5 it will be quiet.
"whoa, what made the markets just jump so high?"
Back to 50$ we go!

On track...10 times the probability that KSS will hit $40 before it hits $60 again.Tell me all about the low PE...Tell me all about the high cash Tell me all that and convince yourself that KSS will swim upstream against the current.And that is during good times. Throw in a recession in the next 2 years and we'll be talking $30 to $35.
Sinking ship!!! welcome $14 today
Up 10.95% BH's
So any reason why we are down 3% today?
Kohls nearly turned a profit during the worst part of the pandemic with a ton of stores closed...you shorts are hilarious
Any thoughts about why the SP is dropping in an up market? Thanks.
"Those who think retail stores are dead are very wrong, people want options and all surging retailers will be multichannel... take a good look at Lululemon and Apple where bricks and mortar and online channels drive business to each other!"
BOYCOTT AMAZON
KSS is going sky high. Shorts are covering....
Just sold all my positions of KSS. Stupid stock. Retail sector is always stupid. Just waste of time and money
I'm really excited about the possibilities for the FLX product line. There's no reason Kohl's can't run neck to neck with Lululemon as an activewear retail destination and as an investment as well.
FWIW Quarter end window dressing is what is happening in the market. Unfortunately more pain to come..
It would have to go up 50% to get back to its most recent high of $29.50 back in June. A vaccine is right around the corner/November or December - 60 to 90 days away!
"Well that was one nasty sell-off on Friday and I don't think it's done yet. Likely it will require at least testing the 50 dma on the major indexes and maybe even the 200 dma on the Russell. What set this off? Well it looks like the spike in the 10 year and that would likely go to this twit Neal Kashkarian, the fed governor in Minneapolis. He has been the biggest vocal dove saying we needed to err on the side of caution for years now. Last week he came out flipping 180 and talking about accelerating the rate hikes. So I think this was his doing as it flipped a dove to a hawk on the fed and that means the market must factor in more rapid rate hikes. The reality is the economy is accelerating and the fed likely does need to be a bit more proactive, unfortunately the good news on the economy has not yet been as visible to offset the fear of rising rates."
Zero pricing power. Get out now
This stock just won’t quit! $50 incoming!
KSS Ain’t target or Walmart or even Ross. Bankruptcy will be when not if. Shorting at $20 to single digits will pay off handsomely for me. Just watch.
It’s hilarious that anyone actually believes Amazon will buy Kohl’s when Bezos is much smarter than that. All the malls will be Amazon stores within a few years for a fraction of the cost it would take to take over KSS. Retail will be screwed when this goes operational.
This is a 5.00 stock. Going the way of JC Penney. Idiots way overbought this and it's extremely overvalued.
"I'm pretty annoyed b/c as the market was tanking I had changed my orders from $14 to $12 to then $10 and I was going to let that one fill. Never got there and here we are. Still freaking waiting. NOW, on a very red day, it spikes up... right before what is going to be a horrendous earnings report? WTH. I want in but not above $14 and feel like $10 is a ""more correct"" buy point but fear missing the dang boat again. Opinions, forum mongers?"
Should close 39.50 by EOD
"Long term, shorts are in a losing position. Great time to be long kss."

"average down or is this going bankrupt? I feel this isn't one of the weaker retailers, but my cost is 26 and market seems to be pricing bankruptcy"
"i cant believe people are shorting this stock. i made that mistake once before but come on, they are teaming with the Amazon powerhouse. this stock is going to kill it in no time."
30s here we are - just like I posted a couple of days ago. We have a lot higher to rise!Will be in the 50s soon.
"I have been trying to figure out why the market went up so much today. In thinking about it, I have come to the conclusion that the interview with a patient recovering from a near-death situation where he was given the malaria drug chloroquine with such great success. He was given it at night and the next day his recovery was dramatic and then he was interviewed on TV. I watched it. This must have been seen by millions of investors, including those with a lot of money on the sidelines. These investors see a new normal in the future where anyone that catches the CV as you call it will get treatment with chloroquine and recover because of this drug. The medical community is still testing chloroquine, but investors are risk takers. They see the future as one where this drug defeats this CV scourge. That was my vision when I saw his interview last night. This drug is a game-changer I believe. I hope we can count on it. Time will tell. If everyone with the disease reacts like that man did last night, then this economy shutdown can be over very quickly. The drug supply will then become the question. I believe there is a lot of it available at about $8 per dose. The whole world will be asking for it overnight."
"Soon will be climbing the 40s again with renewed momentum.Then 50s, 60s and 70s and beyond!Buy, buy more hold and collect the dividends and enjoy capital gains too.Peter Lynch said his biggest gains were stocks he held 3 and 4 years.Patience is a virtue with this stock now."
Dummies who shorted and sold yesterday are in real pain today!
"Never Ever buy KSS, it is going bankrupt"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5AQMSt_P3g
Gerhard knows the facts and hedoesn't promote fiction nor doeshe fabricate bulls!!!. He knows KSS will be on a run this year.
"I think Kohls may see may gains thanks to the tax bill but when the dust settles this will start declining and wont look back. Do you Longs really think this is a target for Amazon, please dont say yes. Amazon isn't in the retail brick and Mortar business......Whole foods was for the grocery business and doesn't compare to a loser Kohls store. Yes Im short 2k shares at 49 and will what till mid 30s to cover."
KSS is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).
"@TR it’s understood that today so many newbies who use Robinhood big margin to boldly leverage everything including bitcoin trades have to sell! They have no choice! As real investors, we should take advantage of this situation!"
"In case anyone is curious, Kohls has at least 343 stores out of 1,133 in states that are either shutdown or partially shutdown. That's about a quarter of their stores. Where is the growth going to come from to pay the billions in debt due?IL = 62 storesCA = 116 storesCT = 22 storesDE = 5 storesNJ = 37 storesNY = 51 storesPA = 50 stores"
good entry point to short. Short on any strength $15 coming
I have traded some shares between $37 and $39. This time I think that I will hold onto my shares. Quarterly report was good and we are heading into the winter holiday season. Besides the 6% dividend is safe and good. Just my thoughts. Would like to know what others are thinking.
"End of the day selling in 3,2,1!"
I am in nov.09 will I get dec. div?
"UBS is full of s***. Take a look at Amazon’s return procedures when you select to return items at your local kohl’s. And yes, amazon implemented this when they invested in kohls. Everytime you want to return something you bought from Amazon, you can select your participating local kohl’s store as a return location. EVERYTIME YOU RETURN AT KOHL’s, you get a 10-15% off coupon to spend at kohl’s! This creates more revenue and more door swings and converting amazon shoppers to make a quick pick up at kohl’s and they are already a busy chain. Keep your heads up folks and don’t worry about them getting cut. As long as Amazon is on their side I truly doubt it."
"Kohl's CEO has indicated yesterday at the ICR conference that they plan to partner with a grocery store or convenenience store to lease space in its downsized stores...whoa, are they baiting AMZN to act? They will announce who they will have news on March 1st...who could it be? An AMZN partnership or ""test pilot"" is no brainer."
CEO is a woman of her word.Today she said the dividend will be reinstated 1st quarter 2021 post covid as earnings and sales return to normal.
"Sure are lots of wishes, hopes, and dreams that Kohl's will float upstream while all other stores selling similar products are floating downstream with the current.Kohl's would be doing fantastically to paddle like heck and just stay in place.....But throw in a recession within the next two years, and you'll be able to pick up shares in the mid 30's...Thoughts of returning to the sixties...or hitting $70 are just wild eyed naivety."
Why are kohl’s and target going in the opposite direction the last 2 weeks?
ZAAG is a poke at the $$$$
KSS reached a 52 Week low at 40.05
Any time.amzn is mention going into a business what happens In this business kohls is with the ripper
"Hit or about to hit the last 4 months' resistance level of $23, if the share price turns and goes south again in the next several day, I plan to buy $18.5 Puts to capture the downtrend."
"If M (Macy's) drop a bit more, its dividend pay rate would be 7%. And it is just 10 trading days away for 1/4 of this. Crazy!"
"toldtold you the worst is yet to come walmart and target beating themthey will beat kss in q3q coming scaryscary crash crashbelow $12,beveryvery afriad to loss alotlot more money"
$45.24 and still dropping?Longs even deserting their positions!! $44.'s Soon!
Cutting corp jobs is trimming the fat. Great news for investors. Becoming more efficient.
This is like a gift. Penny and Sears are goners because of the pandemic. Kohls is the only major midlevelclothing retailer left. Most people don't like to buy cloths at discounters or on line. Four months fromnow back to school shoppers will fill these stores. Hold on now and you will triple your investment by the end of the year.
anybody know why KSS dropped $1.31 in after-hours trading on Fiday 6/2?
"JB, just wondering, what would cause you to cover your short position. I assume that the news has been better than you expected on the stock. Do you have a price target? I know the $59 level is like a multi year peak, so if it breaks $60 would you toss in the towel then? Just interested in your thinking as I can't seem to find a reason to short a stock that has already been so heavily shorted."
"Stock is down again today but volume is relatively anemic. Later today we get the report of the short position as of 1/15 and then tomorrow likely positive GDP news and early next month retail sales for January. Those should all help boost the stock, though in February there will be no active buyback going on."
"If you have not started BOYCOTTING AMAZON yet, I hate to say it, but you deserve the sell off in KSS today. Please Boycott Amazon for the health of all retail."
Morgan Stanley's recent sell rating on Kohl's with a $15 dollar price target is looking veryridiculous now that it's 37% higher than their $15 target issued a few days ago. Never use MorganStanley for advice. I would never open an account with them.
Is $KSS still a #$%$ Just checking.
I guess the 10% drop is just because we've passed ex-dividend date?
seriously?
KSS is down -4.91% to 73.53
"i have 1,000 Kohl shares at 23.26 am down over 4,000. am worried should i sell, or will stock go up around Thanksgiving even with covid?"
cash burn
Honestly David is brilliant. He’s getting all the sheep in this chat to buy and he’s selling. Bravo David.
KOHLS in the North East have been DEAD lots of racks marked down heavily though...but getting people into the stores is almost non existent. They better pray heavy online sales. Also unemployment for many runs out in 1 month...not going to be good! People are worried about food...not clothing and gadgets!
3 days of 20% increase in stock. The trend line is set. We should see $25 soon.
"To all you shorts sellers and options traders, I can’t wait to be sitting in my brand new lambo next year cause of these stocks: $CCL, $SPR, $CRS, $PLNHF, $CAKE, $PLAY, $KSS"
"KSS is basically a financially sound well positioned department store. That said, if KSS eliminated its dividend, they would be financially stronger in the short term. Some institutions holding KSS would have to sell. Many others would sell causing a major drop in share price presenting a buying opportunity for those willing to hold for a couple years as we adjust to COVID-19. Once stores are fully opened, KSS would again be very profitable and able to offer a very good dividend and share price."
HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE TODAY ON BLACK FRIDAY - IS CORPORATE CLOSED? OVER AN HOUR ON HOLD WITH NOBODY ANSWERING PHONES!!!!!!!!!!
Sure didn’t stay down long. Poor shorts barely got to celebrate before the party was ruined. Almost 19 now. 20 next! Lol
"Airlines are up 10% oil stocks are up, trust me the market has been going higher and this is now in the red it’s had its run up, selling now at this price and will get back in when it’s lower."
Calling it now. Another 15-20% gain before the next pull back. Easy money ride it to the top and then back to the bottom.
"if you have enough money, just buy kss, kss sure be reach history high, please visit kss, see how busy inside."
Swing trader runs this. Just FYI.
"shep you need to cover your short, I realize you are just likely a bot that the professionals are using to try to talk the stock down but reality is that you risk a $95 buyout on Kohls now AND the stock price is likely to not go down, which means soon the dividend surfers will want to buy some.Cover now before the rush starts. This new partnership with Amazon is going to pan out and next year they will roll it out to more stores (maybe even this year). Then Amazon is going to realize Kohls footprint of stores is just what they need across the country and buy them. After all any underperforming stores they can just turn into shipping centers."
Another rare opportunity to buy KSS at a 50% discount to fair value. Dividend is safe! 6% at this level.
KSS raise to BUYBY JED
"finally this thing has come down, the recent appreciation made no sense"
I also think a bunch of hedge funds are getting the stock off their books because it's the end of the month/quarter tomorrow and then they will buy back in on Thursday and Friday
Perhaps a short-term pull back is more likely before the next rally on KSS? Do you guys find it difficult to know when to buy or sell something? I prefer to get my stocks from awesomeSTO-CKS.
no money for shopping to busy buying all the KSS I can stock!
"No looters at Kohl’s, was told they have nothing worth looting."
"BREAKING: USA told OPEC to increase oil production and oil is down 1.2%.. When oil is down, retails are up because people more enjoy driving cars to retail centers and buy items. Today, will be another green day for KSS up to 3%..."
"Jcp finished flat in friday's carnage, Kohl's was almost 5% down as most other retailers.Need to call Lancer titanic who has no position!"
"On the weekend Kohs parking lot was packed, over spilling into next lot -WOW@!!!!!@@@"
Any ideas on what's causing the rise today? have to do with Under Armor at all?
"Watch for dead cat bounce and sell before next leg down, bottom under $11. with price target $12.65"
"Kohls strategy has paid off, they did not close stores, they pared back on inventory and then the spent on advertising over holidays to capture customers from areas where retail clothing stores were closing. This is a winning strategy and will force the huge short position on Kohls to cover as losses are only going to get worse. We should get a good bump here and then likely another run after earnings when guidance for 2018 comes out and the full positive effect of the tax cuts become apparent. Kohls is on track to earn $5 a share in 2018 and at a market multiple given the strong earnings growth that should get us a nice stock price."
Kohl's cash
Traffic will increase because of Amazon return desk which means more potential buyers walking through stores. Great concept but there's more to the story stay tuned.
"Same thing happened with Etsy. HUGE quarter, but future guidance not sold as better.The market is very fickle"
a 3 dollar upgrade this morning leads to down almost a dollar?? apple would be up 20 dollars!!
Just took small position at 19.40. Looking for a 3 month hold up to 28. Just left and inside was busy. Lines lines and more lines
why is kohl’s going up? when other stores aren’t going up as much?
That earnings guidance is the nail in the shorts coffin. As per the article yesterday they already had big losses in Kohl’s and they made the big mistake of doubling up. Are they ready to lose another $ billion. It’s not a secret anymore. They are starting to look really bad. If I was a pension or insurance fund and I found out about this I would take action and take my money somewhere else. They’re algorithm traders that don’t have time to read balance sheets or listen to conference calls and expect a machine to do the work for them. There loss is our gain.
wow did kohl's online shopping beat the inhouse sales
Anyone else ever check out (http://Multistockalerts.com)? They just sent a tip about KSS
Ridiculous volatility in the market. the stocks are moving up/down by more 1-2% in a matter of seconds. All this is due program trading. Welcome to the world of AI.
"I actually think this is a good time to buy. The amazon program is still in it's infancy, I think it is crazy to think that just after they started it that it would go gangbusters. It takes some time for people to see it and use it for it to gain scale. But think about all the people that have to return stuff from Amazon for Xmas - I think it sets KSS up well as people go into the store to do the return and see an item or two they want and need. So I actually think it will help with Q1 and rebound, and right now the stock is on sale essentially."
&0% of what they sell isClothing looking for a death spiral to 10 again
I will never buy anything from the deranged mad man called Mike Lindell!His products are banned from my family and my family owned corporation! Forever!
"Gee, who could've possibly seen this coming?JC Penney, Sears, Kmart, Shopko"
"KSS actual earnings date March 1, 2021. I think time to add some KSS, but I am going to hold Macy's (M). Macy's earning date Feb 23. Macys has the best online sales growth. Kohl's advantage : not in malls, own brand merch. Macy's advantage, They own their stores in new york, SF, chicago, giant properties worth billions, Great brand and high margins."
"I'm not scaring people, just indicating the facts: Here are the facts as reported:1. Weather was BAD during the quarter.2. Weather was partially blamed for the labor report coming short of expectations.3. Bon Ton stores reported to be liquidating...which means in the area where the stores are located, prices will be down and competitors like KSS will be affected.4. BBBY earnings report disappointed...so you can extrapolate that home goods at other retail stores will disappoint as well.5. Rising fuel prices pressures the consumers...fuel is $.32 higher than this time last year.6. Rising interest rate pressures consumers...the Fed is raising interest rate...see the stocks of the home building sector and the are way down. I'm short the names by the way.7. Have you all noticed that when a company announces earnings...even if they report good, the stock does not rise or rise only slightly? And if the disappoint, they get really punished...you think KSS will hit it out of the park this Q1 with all of the facts above? They will disappoint and fall hard.8. They report in May...this year don't you all agree that Sell in May will be what will happen due to the lethargic action of the DOW? Don't you feel like everyone is trying to get out instead of getting in?"
Up she goes and begins a long upward trend.While insanely overvalued techs begin a long downward plunge.We are moving back to post covid.
2018 guidance was strong but they guided down for Q1. Also with tax effects taken out they came in at $1.87 but with the extra selling week adding 10 cents they really were in line with estimates. So this wasn't a big beat quarter and likely explains the selloff.
time to take some profits for all you Long's I think you've seen the high and in 2018 this thing is going to tank Kohl's as a store sucks
"Book value is 34. I would have to think that is about as low as this stock would ever get. I would also think Amazon relationship would be getting better and better over time. Those stores are massive and Amazon could maximize that space. So, PE of 8.5, 7.5% Div (reflecting new rate), book value of 34...all seem like good numbers."
"Are their any specific dates on when kss will start to open their stores in Georgia, Florida, South Carolina and Tennessee?"
"Whenever Kohl's had a big move, it is followed by a little pullback. Do you expect the same when it drops big? How about a little bargain hunting? Maybe to 55 today?"
"There will be a time to buy, just don't think it's smart to at this weeks action. I have saved over 3% on what was half my position since I sold yesterday."
she hates shorties !!
"Online shopping, Kohl's currenty, Amazon Rtns, steady management and high integrity, this company will adapt and thrive. People will need under garments more than ever before!"
"Just make sure to maintain the dividend, keep buying back shares, and continue work on debt reduction. This will come back. Still need time to see the effects of Amazon now at all locations and the leasing of extra space to Planet Fitness and Aldi. Oh yeah, and don’t even think about trying to acquire At Home."
Current fair value of kss based on a number of key components is $85-90.
"Looking more and more like a short squeeze here, the break about $59 shouldn't be discounted as I think technically it is the last nail in the shorts coffin. There is nothing about the charts that now says short this stock, so likely we will see more covering as the pros throw in the towel. Especially this talk about 4% and 5% growth has to be scaring some of the professional shorts.Kohl's will raise the dividend so they will have to pay up in March as well if they want to hold it till the next recession, which may not hit for another few years."
Great week. Should finish north of 23 after this up cooking week. Kids getting phased into school. Lots of clothes shopping happening.
love you kss...want to see you on 75 Again......ummmmmaaaaa
"Cut by Citigroup, back down to 60"
how well are the stores running in other states?
Earnings will beat. Big boys already know it and will take the stock lower so they can buy cheaper just before the report.Bumpy ride ahead. Know why you own this stock and trade accordingly.
WHo was the analyst on Cnbc's fast money that said shop it?
Anyone make 50k or more from the rally?
how depressing
Looks like the Black Friday sales came early. Going to wait out the panic a bit and then buy in. 10-11 P/E is a bargain right now.
EVERY RALLY is a FAKE RALLY. SHORT IT IF YOU CAN
Spoke to an associate today.She said that they have a young and dynamic CEO.She said the best move he made. was to take back Amazon returns.Amazon customers come in to return and leave buying merchandise on the way out with a Kohl's coupon given to them by the return desk.She said they were busy for the back to school season. .
"So one more day of trading to go before we get the big Q1 report. It will be big because it will likely lead to some earnings adjustments as Kohl's will have its first quarter with the full effect of the tax cut. Given the 4.5% increase in retail sales in this period and the sizable increase in clothing, it is highly likely Kohl's will do well on the top and bottom line. That 4.5% by the way comes from wage gains, some improvement to take home pay from the tax cuts (it is about 2.4% more take home pay) and of course the significant number of new employed who now have wages to spend. Those new employed are a bigger deal for Kohl's than one might think because it will now allow those people to spend money on discretionary items, not just food and the basics. So if you look at employment gains and wage gains plus the tax cut effect, the consumer had about (2.9% + 2.4% + 0.5% = 5.8%) more take home pay to spend and as usual they spend a good chunk of that as we saw with the retail sales increase compared to last year. Clearly higher gasoline prices are not a problem and we have the reality that the $22 increase in oil over the last year and the additional nearly 1.4M bpd production will add about $250M to the US economy every day plus with the recirculation effect that turns into about a $1B a day in more economic activity from oil alone compared to last year. That is about 1.8% GDP growth just from oil!"
$44.'s coming!
I know I am a bit of a dreamer however... When Amazon bought Whole Foods they had a mission in mind. Now they partnered with Kohls who serves the middle to upper middle class of America there is another definite strategic option in focus. I would not be surprised is Jeffrey Bezos made another nice play as Kohls is seeking to take itself private now anyway. Big changes are at hand.....
"If it wasn't for the nummy daily horsejerk short sellers kss would be at $$40 , EASY,EASY,EASY!!!!"
I will buy your shares 46-48-probably 46
kinda toppy here -- up 25% since thanksgiving......too far too fast.....sales slowed in December
It's going under now.
For weeks and on May 6 th ZACKS had a #1 rank buy on KSS stock based on its earnings Estimates. Today they have a # 3 out of 5 rank! They have a problem with accurate information? They should stay neutral until they collect moe solid information? This happened with CVS and WTI recently. CUIDADO
Crazy to buy this stock... market at all time highs and it keeps falling. Imagine when market correct! Didnt you all learn from other retailers!?!?This is at best a $36 stock. The only way out is if amazon buys it
Long and strong there’s nothing wrong
Buy prpo good news
"New lows coming! Retail is a bad bet even with the dividend which will be the first to go,your all sheeple if you don't think this stock is highly manipulated up and down by the big players,you'll be left holding the bag as they start store closures!"
"If you look at today's volume it is still anemic, that means we still haven't seen the shorts run for the hills. I can't believe they haven't thrown in the towel yet given all of the signs that were so clearly visible weeks ago. If they are going to wait for Q4 earnings it is going to be very painful for them. Analysts are not going to rush to raise 2018 earnings, so there will be a beat and sizable guide up coming and given the comparison of 2017 to 2016 earnings, which already shows growth for Kohls, the stock should get quite a bounce."
What's going on with Kohl's? Another sell off? Hope the expected earnings on 11/9 will rebound the stock with good earnings.
Looks like this suckers gonna plunge ! Covid surge will kill sales this quarter!
"don't buy tgt wmt hd and amzn,because their earnings growth unusual,they maybe sold more unusual things about covid 19 disaster,after covid 19 finished, their sales will strong down,kss earnings down was temporary, it's hurt by covid 19 disaster, so it's earnings can rebound to grow to continue grow,so strong buy kss can make huge money, because it's stock price too low,"
30 dollar end of this month!
who is going to beat KSS or TJX ?
"Last year Wall Street was able to derail the markets around this time based on Fed raising rates for the 4th time, this time they will blame the drop on trade. So we shall see if the Wall Street boys and girls can impact Main Street Christmas season and retail this time around. Looks like the computers are in full force making it happen this morning."
Doesn't KSS put out a press release announcing when their quarterly conference call and quarterly report will be released?
Miss earnings and shoot up 3% on the news. Makes absolutely perfect sense.
I suspect Sun Capital Partners is studying $KSS for a scrap heap purchase
Store's closing! Chapter 11Save yourself!
corporate Income tax to increase from 20% to at least 28%. Average hourly wage at Kohls to increase from 9.75/hr to 15/hr. There goes the profits.....again. Maybe the My Pillow guy wasnt so bad after all.
"LOOK OUT BELOW HERECOMETHE SCARYSCARYCRASH CRASHBELOW $13 THEY SAY OUTLOOK NOT LOOKING GOOD ,ALMOST GARENTEE COULDGET DOWNGRADED ANYTIMENOWGETWHAT YoU CAN NOW ORGET ALOTLOT LESTHEN $13 coming"

Back to 60's by tomorrow afternoon!
"wish my 401k had a FAANG, TSLA fund :("
Holding well.Bodes well for near future.
"some dog is manipulating Kohls, they SANDBAGGED over 4 dollars last week- JACKHOLES!!"
Nightmare for shorts here!
I love it when a company doesn't ignore the shorts and squeezes them instead. Go Kohls!
"Well that explains yesterday, the smart money must have gotten an some insider information about the bad JCP and Dillards reports. JCP is clearly done for, especially with rising rates.Will be an interesting few days into Kohl's earnings and then later in the month an idea of how much shorting was done to accomplish the drop."
"AEO and ANF didn't recover fast enough Wed -- still down couple percent. Will they make it up today? after all, nothing company specific but trade imbalance,"
3 cents off the low nice little bounce
"Look at last 5 days -- AEO and ANF dropped everyday for a total of about 7% while KSS, GPS, M, and TGT all UP. Make sense?"
"Ugh! I never knew how hard it would be to sell something for 200% profit. You'd think it'd be easy. I'm very bummed to get rid of my stellar position, but I absolutely will be buying more and starting a new position. You day traders must be totally stressed out doing this every day."
Thanks for the cheap shares!
"I know it has a lot of debt but I have the feeling it is going to do really good on its next ER 8/6. I bouht 1.5K more today. Reasons I like it:1. Everytime I go shopping there, the line is about a 20 minute wait. It wraps around the store. Good bargains and coupons. A beloved store.2. Bank of America lifted it to a buy rating.3. 95% of Kohl's stores are in non-mall locations.4 Lots of stores in Midwest (less CV). 5. Will pick up sales from JC Penney store.Holding it at least until the earnings report."
"On the positive side, the short position as of 11/30 is now down to 24.5M shares. Another good chunk of covering during this sell-off. While that hasn't made the price go up, it likely has prevented the price from going down and of course will make it easier to move up as traders won't be able to buy back their shares cheaper down the road as they are now gone. The size of the float that is trading is shrinking and if Kohl's is also buying back some shares here that means the noose is getting tighter. All we need is some fuel for the fire now, i.e. good news."
long term this is solid but just give it time
https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/07/kohls-ceo-real-estate-is-an-asset-emerging-from-coronavirus-pandemic.html
who cares about a dividend when the stock has loss 50% in a year . real good dividend...
Stores reoping won't help low traffic and purchasing to operating costs won't make up for interest payment expenditures. It's a no win situation for KSS. Governors don't have a clue.
"I'm pretty new to KSS. That said my experience in other earnings plays tells me to take some gains tommorow before earnings. It can go higher but, we've seen some pretty big moves in the past week. You may not get max gains, but you won't be kicking yourself if it drops $8 a share in one night. GLTA"
"Kohls are conveniently located in shopping centers near your neighborhood. Need to buy a gift for a birthday party, no driving through traffic and fighting crowds at the mall. They have nice brands and getting better. Store has Kohls coupons and Kohls cash."
"One of KSS sales strengths is its coupons, shoppers love a bargain. When stores fully open, I suspect the they will need to reduce inventory with massive discounts of 20 to 30 % mail and online discounts. Also, you can return AMZN purchases and most stores.."
"If you are long it is best you take a profit here., believe me. DOW 24000 is a near top give or take 300 points. Market has tested it severak times and it has not held. Target $12 is real, don't get caught"
"Love how all these communists come to prop up the stock of a company that just #$%$ off half the country.Good sales or bad sales, how much business did they just drive away vs how much of their total sales was mypillow?Its just stupid business. What are these people thinking?"
"buy kss FL and LB can make huge money, because their earnings very good,their business have huge room to growth,their stock too,don't buy amzn wmt and tgt, after covid 19 end, their sales will decline."
"I am also not trying to downplay the miss, it was very bad considering their track record lately. Also their losing focus with the At Home acquisition talks is a red flag that the management team might be losing focus on the core business. Not warning was also not good. The CEO was out a lot getting interviewed this quarter, so there is no excuse for not preparing the market.On the positive, buybacks continue, the dividend is nice and the stock still should generate a bit of cash this year, even after the dividend and the buyback. So watch the cash down the road, that is the most important thing at this point."
"Hey kohl’s, I buy My Pillows products direct now! Can you spell Loss of Margin! You cancel cultured yourself out of margin! BTW, I no longer shop at Kohl’s! I canceled you!"
It will be positive by end of today.
"anyone who didn't sell will not sell now, anyone who is going to buy will buy today. Jump on the wagon or get left behind"

KSS is up 8.71% to 14.23
Slow march back up. 26.26 was the high 10 days ago. Easily could hit 24+ in the next day or 2. Glad I covered!

Dont be surprised when KSS ends up for the day. Hey it's a stock not a bond.
"If I buy today, can I get dividends?"
"Well 11M shares traded and we got a nice long candle out of it. To me that is saying we likely had shorts take it down and then cover volumes. This puppy is going to run again soon enough making today a very nice buying opportunity. Also, later tonight we should know the short position as of 12/31, which will give us some insight into what they were doing. I think given the quick run from $60-$70 they have been covering, only shorting tactically to drive the price down so they could cover some more."
60-70 dollar end of the year
In at $14 out at $47. Enjoyed the ride.
"Lets see, you got in at $65... and now its $45.... Now, tell us again about your ""fat"" $2.68 dividend check that proves its really a $70 stock.Look for ""selected"" store closings as 2020-2021 unfolds. The story line will be to improve profitability... Expect that method for improved profits to be repeated over and over. (the Sears method of streamlining the company to boost profits)"
Let's see 10% today with ease. 10+ tomorrow would put this at almost $23 which means it's back at around what it was last week before the sell off. This moves fast and it closed above it's old resistance and new support. Shorts who didn't cover will learn the hard way come tomorrow!
It's the weirdest thing when men post on here as if they are beautiful white women
Going to 52 week lows AGAIN before it is over. Kohls has turned into a serious BUM STOCK....any store that sells clothes is hated by wallstreet....I guess they want everyone to order from TJmaxx and Ross or go naked.
Someone bought over 500k 77 calls that expire tomorrow. Me thinks that is someone who wants to cover a short position.
Looks like a new troll on this board 4mvp who clearly made the mistake of shorting KSS a long time ago. Sorry buddy.
"Seems all retailers in the Kohl's type of offerings are headed lower as the ""in store"" retail tide goes out... never to return.Thus even fairly good ships will also go down. Kohl's doesn't stand a chance to have a long term improvement.On the contrary, when the next recession hits in a year or two, KSS will easily sink to the 30's, and very likely enter the 20's at some point.(Please don't tell me about Target, Walmart, and such. They offer a hugely different offering in terms of what bring customers in to shop for a wide variety of products. Kohls has a very narrow offering, much more subject to the retail decline we see all around us)"
KSS hasn’t been this low since the 90’s.
"Drove by my local Kohls yesterday and didn't even realize they had reopened. 5 cars in the lot...employees. GHOST TOWN. Unemployment highest in history and people are hoarding their benefits because they don't know if the job they once had will exist after their benefits run out. Businesses are going bankrupt at a record pace with no end in sight. Also people are still nervous about going out due to COVID numbers INCREASING,but no longer being the front line due to these riots and protests. KSS is great for swing trading,that is about it."
"i have a feeling tomorrow, the start of July, when Kohls renounces that they are going to be accepting amazon returns, that the stock price will jump tremendously. I hope everyone bought at this discounted price to reap rewards going forward :) best of luck."
I got a feelin’ Amazon is going to scoop up kohl’s...hmm
"The 3 most recent analysts within ETrade have Kohl's rated at a buy with price targets of $39, $40, and $49."
BOYCOTT kSS SINCE THEY JOINED forces with amazon.
$KSS trading in a zone right now between 18.50's to 24. Easy money for short term swing traders. Strong support at the 18.50 area. That area is a good risk to reward entry and ride back to $24 area. For people who play the charts
Analysts must be smoking crack cocaine if they think it will lose $1.76 a share in Q1 but only a fraction of that in Q2. Reality is Q2 is going to be worse than Q1.
So this looks again like a short thingy trying to create panic selling to either drive the price down or cover their positions. Likely if this is programmed they will take the massive profits on the 10% down and cover. So looking at the price action today is going to be very interesting.
Target and Walmart will survive because they sell food too!... you can get a new top and pair of kicks there too. Kohl's is done!
Sears and JC Penny shoppers will need a retail outlet store if/when they close
Have anyone received kohl’s dividends? Ex date was 06/23 but I haven’t seen the dividends paid
Count me in as another that absolutely dislikes this new format.
Both Macy's and Kohls guidance were similar from their prior FY guidance. Now KSS has run up nicely into today Macys not that much though the EPS misses for both are pretty good but they are not huge misses for these type of moves. I'm sure the market will try to press them even lower tomorrow but near $44 or lower could be a bottom if markets rally like they seem to do almost every day. I bet we do see a rally since the Dow is only 58 points from 20K. What markets are ignoring are the inflationary pressures the consumer is now facing gas prices are up .20 in about a month here in NY and oil is higher along with health care costs and deductibles and now I am seeing it in some dairy prices. What amazes me is that the markets are celebrating higher energy prices (along with Yellen) which is always a tax on the consumer.
Time to load up in my opinion.We will see 85 before 70.
"Trump tweeted that the post office should raise rates for shipping packages, the post office is losing money while AMZN's revenue is growing. Another reason why AMZN will buy KSS. As I posted here, AMZN would benefit greatly by buying KSS, using the free cash flow for capital expenditure to remodel the stores to suit its need AND as a bonus AMZN can expense the capital expendure 100% with the new tax bill. Sooooo many reasons why AMZN will buy KSS."

Its always darkest before dawn. Michelle Gass said in the earnings that they are seeing the open stores doing 50-60% of normal business. Thats a good sign moving forward as more people begin to venture out and more stores open. Hold this diamond in the rough and you will be rewarded. glta
"beat on everything and the share price down over 8%, go figure"
"All aboard!! Next stop, short-squeeze city!!"
Stop send me useless Kohl's coupon in the mail. It's a scam. this company is a scam.
"Interesting article on 4 online clothing retailers that send you stuff.https://moneyish.com/upgrade/heres-what-happened-when-i-tried-4-clothing-subscription-services-to-adult-my-work-wardrobe/This might be an option for the big city where it is a pain to go shopping around, but I think the prices would scare most away. You are much better off with Kohls, especially with kids, than these kinds of services that seem to be targeted at young professional women who spend over $100 on a top."
Houston we have take off!
it's a buy all aboard next stop is a full blown shopping spree at kohl's!
will never see 50 again . guaranteed. Best economy ever and it isnt surviving
"Did I do the math correctly, CEO gets $3.6 million selling 95,000 shares at $38.44 and also receives 208,00+ more options?"
Kohl’s will definitely go up in a month.
Anti-American sewer dwelling short sellers driving another great company down. Hope they win a free trip to Italy or Spain.
This stock was downgraded again by another analyst but the morons had to take it back up again. Keep paying a p/e of 42 on zero growth and less margins and see where that eventually takes you. This is a 8.00 stock at best.
Should moon upon reopening in a couple weeks. This is like the wal-mart of clothing stores around here. No one wants to pay Macys prices in middle America
About to crash come on darlin Dow she goes
"Bank of America stays positive on Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) following he company's strategic updates and into the holiday season.Some number crunching form BofA: ""We are wary of long-term margin targets in retail and our model does not include a return to historical credit profitability or prior gross margin levels. We forecast F20/21/22 operating margins of (2.5)/3.5/3.5%. Based on our 2022 revenue forecast, we estimate that Kohl’s could generate $5.32 of earnings with a 7% operating margin (vs. our $2.06 estimate).""BoFA also calls the robust balance sheet at Kohl's key to the story. The firm keeps a Buy rating in place and price objective of $30 (45% upside)."
"Every time I drive by the Kohls near us, the parking lot has been packed since they reopened. Sure, government shut them down for 4 months, so Q2 will be bad. But they were making money before Covid 19, and the store seems even busier than before since it reopened. I see a return to profit Q4 for Kohls, analysts have overblown this one."
"High p/e low growth, massive debt. Time to short KSS again and the dumb minions chasing it."
"Holy #$%$! 3 qtrs. of dividends gone!So glad I sold my shares for small profit @ $51.26, had a feeling this was going much lower!"
"Here's a stock that's gone nowhere in the last 5 years, now we know why. More interested in politics than in running their business. There's one in my neighborhood I'd visited twice over the Christmas season out of pity...but, they didn't have much of anything useful, so that I won't be going there isn't any loss. Will watch for their store closings with glee."
great upward momentum!
Is Kohl’s actually going to open a As Seen on Tv stand alone store? Seems like terrible timing.
When is the next ex-dividend date? or when it might be?
"Great news. My family and friends have stayed loyal to KSS. When we could not get to the store during shutdown, we shopped online. When the stores started ope.ning we visited ASAP. I am a believer in Peter Lynch. We followed his advice by knowing the goods and services of companies we were considering for our portfolio. We saw parking lots with a large number of cars, lines at the register and good sales. In NY Modell's closed, so many folks started going to KSS.I am totally bewildered by Cramer. He insists that KSS is not doing well. How can a company not doing well buy back shares and re-instate their dividend? He has been wrong on this one for the entire move up."
Wow getting hammered on raising guidance! I guess they didn't read the details. Let's see how the stock reacts to the early sell-off.
This is the last bargain in retail.
"what do you make of the ""At Home"" talks? How might that affect KSS stock price?"
"Will Amazon wait to buy Kohl's in March 2018 after the 4th Q earnings report in February or in June after the 1st Q earnings report in May? It behooves AMZN to buy KSS in March so they will ample time to remodel the stores for Xmas 2018. Fuel cost is rising and the longer they wait, the margins suffer. Michelle Gass is due to become KSS's CEO in May, but a buyout before then does not matter to her since she will most likely head ""department store"" side of Amazon's business. You guys like this idea? How about this one... AMZN buys KSS sometime in January before Amazon report their 4th Q result that will show disappointing margins due to rising costs especially fuel (people will then say, now we know why Amazon bought Kohl's because it is becoming clear, they need brick and mortar to alley in part the deteriorating margins and speed up technology based shopping, not to mention buy on line pick up in-store as well as in-store retunes). It will also be an opportune time to buy KSS before it rises any further when reporting 4th Q result in February, Pretty smart for Amazon to buy them in January at say $75-$80 because for sure next Monday the stock will gain 10% to $60 when Mansell reports outstanding holiday sales and guides upwards due to the tax bill and rosy outlook on the economy in 2018. Why, with minimum wage going up and thousands of dollars being thrown around as bonus. So a 25%-30% premium from $60 gets you $75-$78. I WILL TAKE IT, but $85-$90 would be better when the stock will be at $70 after the 1st quarter report in May as 25%-30% premium from $70 is $87-$91. Somebody are going to lose the shirt, right Mr. Blunder?"
I'm going shopping!
Oversold
Get in while you can. $24 short term price target
Are you BOYCOTTING SCAMAZON yet? Or just watching stores close up? I won't set foot in a Kohls anymore since they do business with Scamazon.
kohls... lol
This is a safe-haven stock. Should move up to about $80 a share.
"Extrapolated from Cramer's comments on CNBC this morning, Cramer believes Kevin Mansell should take Kohl's private. I wouldn't be surprised if he books Mr. Mansell on Mad Money to discuss the issue. Any hint of going private takes KSS to $45 in 1 day."
going back down to $10 $$$
"how about that, kohl's ended up KIng of the hill!"
"Maybe the S&P500 index committee needs to put KSS back in, or do we need to wait for a vaccine?"
who wishes they would have sold a couple days ago?
"Some things in life are so impressive, you will be at a loss for words.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzCsDVfPQqk"
hey out there don't let fear mongers scare you into thinking kohl's has anything to do with Sears Macy's or jcpenney! we are the Victor's! don't be caught in the back of the line when she opens!
No bottom. Maybe 60.
so painful to be long. everyday more pain and I bet a huge share dilution is on horizon.
0 stores have reported any damage.....the worst is over
this this just got hit by miles Garrett with it's own helmet
Analysts expect 59.9% earnings growth in 3 years from $KSS https://simplywall.st/NYSE:KSS/kohls
Shorts cant believe their luck. Will cover now that the market has been dumb enough to bring this down so much.
Shrots taking advantage of the drop by taking it down more? Might it shoot back up this afternoon?
Wow Dow up over 200 and Kohls down again..........come on guys your smarter than this. Don't lose all your money thinking this is a 75-90 stock when its a 20-35 dollar stock. I know there are the really smart one waiting for the mother ship to come and rescue them........that is even funnier.
"Went to Kohl’s yesterday for a Amazon return. They put the return desk in the back corner of the store. I was third in line. The return was fast and they gave me a 25% off coupon. I ended up buying $88 worth of golf shirts on the way out. Now they just raised the dividend. Yeah, I like Kohl’s."
"the Manipulating fund stopped selling and started buying, they'll run it to 45."
will it ever see 50 again?
KSS is no were near bankruptcy those comments are just ignorant says it all about the poster.
wish I had money to buy today!
Why kohls going up today?
"As the owner of both Amazon and Kohl's shares, I think the idea of partnering with each other is a great idea."
Bezos is laughing and laughing here! He offloaded all his junk merchandise on some dumb reject from the cosmetics counter CEO and now Kohls is screwed. Time for said dumb as a fence post CEO at Kohls to go!!!!
"Good News for my Amazon takeover theses: It is reported today that people just opened $90 billion in unwanted gifts this holiday. Some 15% of purchases are retuned per FedEx estimates. Consumers prefer to return packages at stores, according to FedEx. Consumers will return $90 billion worth of goods this holiday season, according to Optoro, a firm that specialized in business of return shipment. Shoppers prefer to buy online but return goods in a store, Raj Subramanian, who head FedEx's marketing, said on a call with investors last week. About 15% of goods are returned, while apparel returns come back at twice that rate, he estimated.Do you guys know what that means? It means Amazon, who as reported captured 55% of the online business and if 15% is returned, that means customers are returning $7.43 billion ($90b x 55% x 15%)...that is almost the current market cap of KSS at $9.55 billion! Now we know the Amazon people are very smart and I'm thinking if they only have a retail store where then can return those items and pick in-store replacement, the result would be a whopping amount of retained sales. All Amazon has to do is purchase Kohl's 1100 plus locations, stock them full of what has been selling at Amazon.com so that EZ in-store return is achieved and better yet pick-up in-store replacement of the product that is being returned to recapture what is being returned otherwise. That is a no brainer folks. People say Kohl's inventory is the same as everyone else...I say yeah, but inorder for Amazon to really boost the retail side of the business and prevent any leakage via returns, they need Kohl's 1100 off mall locations fully stocked with what has been selling at Amazon.com....GENIUS!. $90 buyout baby by summer the latest, as they need to remodel the stores to include big appliances like refrigerators, ranges, washer/dryers and more electronics and best selling small appliances and apparel at Amazon.com. And the good thing about it is the recently approved tax bill gives advantage to capital expenditure... WOW everything is aligning for a takeover."

Entered a small position because of high dividends. 8 PE with 8% divvy is a good entry IMO. Hope I don’t regret this in a year or 2 lol. GL
KSS reached a 52 Week low at 12.72
"If you are not BOYCOTTING AMAZON, you deserve losing money on Kohls. It is your choice."
Another short shorts day!
"short squeeze up and then it goes down. all gains were made yesterday and she is talking about tarrifs on conference call. this is an overpriced crapt store that is going no where. it's not confusing at all, take your money out and if u must be in retail buy tjx, walmart, or target."
KSS holding up today buy signal. bottom is in.
Only stock in my portfolio going down today. Why ?
whats the hurry to buy? market primed to drop again
"Today's slide not surprising after yesterday's announcement. A 20% haircut is considerable pain. Depending on your tolerance, this might be an attractive entry point. Perhaps for others, but NOT for me."
32 to 16 in 5 days flat. Kohl's should buy back shares hand over fist.
Kohl's is down 10.95% to 22.08
"I will listened to the experts. Not Tom, #$%$ and Harry day traders on this conversation.Merrill Lynch analyst Lorraine Hutchinson reiterated a Buy rating on Kohl's on Wednesday, setting a price target of $36, which is approximately 23.37% above the present share price of $29.18.Hutchinson expects Kohl's to post earnings per share (EPS) of $0.31 for the fourth quarter of 2020.The current consensus among 9 TipRanks analysts is for a Hold rating of shares in Kohl's, with an average price target of $30.5.The analysts price targets range from a high of $36 to a low of $28."
Buy Macy's
Getting near my entry 46-48
wow...what happend today? any new news?
few Months ...will get back to 60
"CNBC today, retail consultant said he is seeing a consolidation of sales into a smaller number of large players. Due to other players disappearing. Kohls is one of those large players"
Some things in life will leave you at a loss for words.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzCsDVfPQqk
when is kohl's going to give a dividend?
"KSS sales strong growth in holiday, that means people trend to shopping REAL stores, SO Macy's future bright, Macy's ranking higher than KSS, SO tax cut will help people shopping Macy's,"
50 by June 2021 and will have a dividend
"Looks like today we are profiting some from short covering to me. Kohl's should be making some statements about their holiday shopping season over the next several weeks, so we might get a good rally off of these new recent lows."
"At my local Kohls there is a Home Depot, Target, Marshalls, TJ Max, and Kohls as the major retailers. Target opened Monday as did Kohls. Target and Home Depot were always open. Target had no lines to go inside and seemed moderately busy. Home Depot lines decreased as the TJ Max lines were crazy long. Kohls looked like it was still closed with few cars. I would have liked to see a whole lot more action at the opening Kohls and was dissapointed. What are you all seeing where openings are occuring? I want to be a buyer of Kohls but expected more anticipation and return on the opening in Flowery Branch Georgia."
"Interesting, the short interest increased by 2.1M shares going into earnings. The price rise was still significant going from like $50 to $59 on the 15th. So clearly when this stock pops shorts quickly start to short it again because they know it will come back down again, sort of like a cyclical trade. We are back up to 20M short shares and likely we got shorted on the earnings, so it will be interesting to see how we end up later this month. The price action despite the 2.1M shares being shorted was quite positive though, though of course the earnings were not."
"If I have to take a guess, I'll say upper 15.XX but more so around 16.00, just where it was pre-earnings hysteria."
500 set for .45
Can’t get over .30 now I am short 3500 at .19
If Krammer doesn't like it. that means you buy it it's going up
you are being punished because of a miniscule miss on revenue and Macys colossal miss. I am in jcp and am getting the same treatment even though they don't report until tomorrow. it will come back. Kohls had a good quarter in my eyes.
"I am a retailer for 20 years. Retail is currently about exclusive brands, service, knowledge, and leading edge. Partnering with Amazon is like giving in instead of increasing ones competitive advantage. CEO needs to go even if she is hot."
I called the corporate office and told them what a terrible idea to let Amazon in and that I would be boycotting from now on.
"great time to buy. 4% dividend, low pe and sales growth"
I'd rather order online then put my family in jeopardy ;(
Must suck to be short on this
I think its time for KSS to go back to 45 or so. The tax reform is delayed. Also lots of folks on the hill are uncomfortable with the border adjustment tax idea. So maybe its not a slam dunk as the street seems to think.
I’m getting hammered with kssWhen is it going up?
"Will Amazon buy Kohl's soon? We all know it's not easy to buy clothes online. You can already return things bought on Amazon at Kohl's and there was strong rumors in January that Amazon would buy Kohl's. Amazon bought whole foods, and wants retail locations to compete with Walmart and others. I think it's happening soon. It's too good of a deal for Amazon to pass up right now."
"Bought a couple shares, this will boom tommorow for sure!!!"
will be green soon
"anyone else considering buying on weakness. macy's is out of the question, but kohls still has potential in my eyes."
JnJ vaccine and stimulus approval should give a boost
"clothes and shoes sales strong rebound in July was just beginning,it can keep continue grow at least 4years, so kss have huge room to going up,"
Hello 21...
"even Macy's and jcp are green, go figure."
bounce hopefully
"So I think with continued buybacks and as depreciation comes back down to in line with CapEx, Kohl's can double its EPS in 4-5 years, which means the stock is worth $140 today, not $70."
Revolver repaid and they still have nearly $2B cash?! dividend expense will be a pittance so I assume we'll see some further debt reduction
KSS will file Bankruptcy soon - sell short
"Kohl's is another Macy. May be way better than Macy. With all strong holiday sales and tax cut , earning will be huge.. Prepare to get rich tomorrow . Will be up 9%"
Signed up to (http://Rightpicker.com) last month and instantly saw why my trading buddy has been banking so many winners. She tried to fly under the radar but the secret is out. Join them today.
solid buy in a year will be in the forties .good buy.
OMG this just does not get a break does it? 15% down every day.
Kohl's is like shopping at a used car lot. Don't like this price? How about this price? Here's a coupon. Here's two coupons. I'll stick with WMT.
"So a little anecdotal field report here....Our local Kohls has two main entrances, with a set of about 4 registers at each one. They have one of the entrances closed so that set of registers is closed.At the other 4 registers, a single line forms and the next customer goes to the next available register. Well today the line went across the end of 3 isles and then back an isle 1/3 of the way back the store to the fitting rooms. Now this was at noon on a Thursday, Imagine a Friday evening or Saturday.Amazon & store return areas were not busy at all."
"kss FL still #1 worth to buy stock, because their earnings very good, and their stock price too low,"
Amazon has an option to buy about 1.7 million shares of Kohl's stock at a $69.68 exercise price. Long term this stock could go beyond that.
"Time to re-post the obvious...(first posted six days ago....but more true today)---------------------------------------------------------------------------""Pretty much a guarantee KSS will cross 45 before hitting 55.And along the same lines, 40 is a much more likely target than is 60.60 is years away if it is even ever seen again.The retail tide is going out ... and out...and out.""-----------------------------------------------------------------------------"
Looks like a good buy. Thank you.
As of today I am down true but once it breaks 53 then I'm in the money (53 is my average). I will cover at 37 or 38 for a nice profit of approx 60K. It will be nice to take all of your money...........oh but keep dreaming of that buyout......HAHAHAHA.
"No shares in this stock, just stopping in to say don't worry about it. KSS is doing fine, it's basically the favorite place to shop for the people that have to be budget conscious and let's just say that segment of society isn't going away anytime soon."
They better open their doors next month.. Target is eating their lunch.I've seen a bunch of businesses that are pretending to be essential that have opened their doors over the last month.. But Kohls has to stay closed?
UPS is shipping Kohl's products in high volumes imo
"Burn shorts, burn.....!"
"be carefulthey were giving stuff away super cheap before X-massounds like a lot of sales dollars, but profits were low, I betI thought they might have financial problems and needed the cash flowgot a bunch of nice winter knit hats for $2 each, how much did they make on them? not much if anything it would seem like $6 or $7 or $9 hats for $2I like the store in general, but Wall Street pumping after a major run up looks a bit silly"
"All you people with ""The Intelligent Investor""on your bookshelves won't follow its advice and buy this now. Great value."
"Well some price action today. It will be interesting to see if we get back to the 200 dma before earnings or actually land above it after. What the outlook is like will be key and given the recent massive debt buyback one would expect Kohl's to guide up. Given how strong they think their business is that could be a big upside surprise, especially as people start seeing year over year earnings growth for Q1 and Q2/19 being much stronger than 2018, maybe even 10+% stronger which gets us to that dream earnings growth level that justifies a much higher P/E."
I’m a buyer at these levels! I’ll sell at 30 maybe. Everyone shops at kohl’s except the bearish clowns on here wishing they hadn’t shorted at 12.
"Stock did well today given the sizable market sell-off, should signal a bottom and hopefully get the shorts to take their profits and go away. Can't imagine they love to pay that dividend every quarter."
KSS reached a new 52 Week High at 77.15
"Macy's CEO was asked yesterday by a CNBC reporter if he had been talking to Amazon. Well,his eyes lit up and stated ""No comment"". Doesn't take a genius to read between the lines."
don't listen to the short bottom feeders
KSS will go down each day $5
Next quarter result will send the company stock to $10
"Once Kohl's announces store closings again, the bottom will drop out! Look out below!"
range bound?
"short interest has decreased in kss, bad money has been put to work for share increase.. low to mid 30s b4 earnings with the dividend reinstatement"
"I can see it now, all of the big, fat cats sitting around the dining table at Davos in about six months drinking 100 year old Scotch and laughing about all of those middle class smucks they raped and pillaged during the 2020 Corona virus scam."
kss sales volume is amazing.....even if margins are low the high volume will fuel profits into Q1
"Did I miss something here? Are people going to stop buying clothes because of coronavirus!?This is a buy. Take advantage of the ""chartists'"" stupidity."
KSS- Strong Buy. PE 10+ 6% Dividend- Value stock. Don’t wait until the stock is over 60 to start buying.
Yesterday i went to Kohls to Return one Product and after returning the Item i got 25% Discount Coupons for Kohls so i did shopping for me ...Great Decision By Kohls....:)
Bulls are winning.
It’s not just Kohl’s!!Look at Macy’s
short some for a big crash tomorrow
My hope of ultimate support is 18.64. if that breaks then I have to reevaluate. Can anyone offer their perspective why one should hold pass that point? How do you guys think October through December would fare?
"Locked in some profits by selling some Oct $82.50 calls. We have not seen a short squeeze yet, so we can still pop by then, but if they aren't throwing in the towel yet, they likely will wait a bit longer."
Hi I'm new here. could any long tell me whether they cut dividend? thank you
"It’s looking like the price for At Home is about $1.8 billion. Add in another half billion in long term debt and obligations. Total current assets are about $1.8 billion that includes property, inventories, and goodwill. Net sales last year were $1.165 billion. Sales have been growing at over 20% based on new stores. The expansion is about one third into there plan. This company had come back out from a previous bankruptcy. Moody’s downgrades the companies debt to negative last month. The stock has been run up on takeover speculation. The At Home stores are huge with a lot of different items which is kind of opposite the direction that Kohl’s has been going. Also they don’t have much of an online presence. I’m hoping that Kohl’s management sees value in the room for improvement getting inventory more efficient and use their fulfillment platform to roll out a online business.The market is there for home items. They may be getting it cheap if they are right but it is risky."
Your ONLY hope is the delivery companies get so backlogged everyone HAS to go to the stores. Gift cards are going to do very well this year.
Longs enjoy the incredible capital gains and 1st quarter dividends!Ride it all the way back to $100/share!
Why is is this down? Is it time to buy ?

"This company is now trading for HALF of its book value, with a ridiculously low forward p/e although that is pretty much a useless number over the short term. A dividend cut is totally fine when you have a forward yield of over 16%!! The stock is priced for bankruptcy and I really don't think that will happen.Kohls is devoted to expanding it's online presence. It's reinventing its brand offerings and evolving tech to do more targeted marketing. The Amazon return thing is not generating much sales growth to speak of but it can definitely be seen as a support pillar that encourages foot traffic and retention of customers.Somebody please give me a reasonable argument for why this isn't a deep value opportunity looking ahead the next five years?"
Just the beginning of a long upward move.
"I don't think there will be any tariffs on any of the consumer goods it's all a game to tweak and push Fed to cut the rates, but you make your own stakes. I am loading on retail. End of the year is coming and stock is cheap"
Looks like KSS wants to reach 60 in a hurry.
"almost every morning a double dip,, then higher,keep your hands off the Sell button,,BUY,BUY,BUY!!!!"
Just wait til they reinstate the dividend!...KSS will be upper 30's in no time!!!!! IMHO
IM LOOKING FOR KRUNT
"So looking at the financials you can see that earnings in 2019 were boosted by a $43M reduction in interest payments and a $27M reduction in depreciation over 2017. That comes out to about $50M in additional after tax income or roughly 30 cents. It just goes to show how powerful paying off debt and not having grown CapEx robustly over the last few years can be for earnings. Depreciation is income that is not taxed and if larger than CapEx is extra cash added to the balance sheet that can be used for debt buybacks, stock buybacks and increased dividends."
I am voting my shares against the activists! No to their directors!!
Back to where we were before the shenanigans with the pps last week. I think KSS will not disappoint tomorrow.The question is whether the pps moves in the right direction after the results.
does this mean that it will start flying up really fast though at some point? Is it good to buy more now assuming it will sky rocket?
Looks like it is heading to $52.50 by next week....200 DMA will not hold.
short Jun $61.50 puts yesterday for $2.58. will be happy with a quick 4+% gainer.
80 is proving to be a hard but to crack...cmon break through!!
"OK< what did KSS need to do other than a blow-out qtr. and increased guidance? Down close to $2.00 is insane,"
Nice already made up most of the drop form the 61 dividend.
at low and dropping
whats up with KSS this morning?!
Bleak outlook. What a mutt. Zero pricing power. Just ugly
thank you UBS for highlighting the bottom
this pillows suck anyway soon he will be selling bed frames
"Kss would be a major indirect beneficiary if jcp did file BK, although I suspect the news is more of a rumor released by jcp to get their bond holders to the negotiation table. ￼"
"DON'T BE FOOLED with Kohl's,, it has a ceo ANCHOR TIED ON TO IT !!!! DOWN SHE GOES !!"
"Does anyone know why some if not all of the fitting rooms are closed? In Carmel, IN the fitting rooms are closed and the inventory is really limited. Both of these problems need to be fixed for sales to return to normal."
71 here we come :)
can you please tell me if you are still hanging on to your Kohls stock? when will this stop? @gerhard @stoxx
"Loss will be much less than expected. Stores are busy ! ,parking lots FULL !!!!"
"Dont believe kss can hit 50s, 60s and 70s soon? Look all around at dds, Jwn, bbby, etc..."
Kohls is on clearance of over75% off of high. Time to stock up.
hold on .. market going down july 28
@ Emma the dork stocker. What happened to your pullback?
"Going by nasdaq website forcasted eps for apr 2020 –1.14 x number of shares (155M shares) =-176.7Million of the 723M on the books so say $550 Million left. the high estimate is +.38 cents, I don’t know about that since they did .38 cents last year same quarter under normal circumstances. But the real question as I read in recent Marketwatch article is will KSS have enough money to pay for the upcoming inventory?"
"Ticker has been Corrupted for 2 weeks, it owes KOHL'S $4 Dollars, lots of STEALING !!"
chart says 35 test
"So two articles recently pooh poohing the recent stock rise and telling you to bail on Kohl's. Now let us remember analysts project 12% earnings growth over the next 2 years, so 6% a year and the company is paying nearly a 4% dividend. Add those two together and the stock is worth a 1.5 times the 10 earnings growth plus dividend P/E and that means at current prices its worth $90+! Now it isn't trading there right now, but odds are that it will get there over the next 4 years as if it generates the 6% earnings and pays its 4% dividend the stock should garner you a 50% net return, stock price gain plus dividends. That is a very solid return for 4 years."
"they are CORRUPTING the ticker AGAIN,should be a BUCK HIGHER,such Jackholes!!"
"So ... Yahoo Finance is telling me that this PIG KSS Stock is under valued, but has a HOLD rating? Gee? Thanks for the great advice! Strong Sell! Big Box Retail is Dead, Sears, JC Penney, Kmart!"
"Ticker is highly manipulated today, I benchmark with DOW, it owes us 60 cents today!!"
"ok guys beat, guide up and get a 10% hit on 3x volume, and now every analyst except MS, who was 20% up by end of yr is looking for 10% more down across the market because why because the the world is ending in 2019 what is going on, who is making $$$, are there that many shorts in the world?"
"This time the retail sell off will hold. Only thing holding any of them up is Stimulus across all aspects of the US economy.When the unemployment give away runs out , then things will get ugly.Until more trillion dollar stimulus.This will end badly"
SELL SELL SELL THIS LOSER!!!
KSS is worth a minimum of $60-75/share and would have been at that price right now if that covid nonsense had not occurred.That's a fact Jack!
KSS is cheap at these prices. See you all in the 60s then 70s soon.
"Hey Guy Adami on CNBC ""Had Money"" what does your QUIJA Board say about KSS now. Clueless individual."
so oversold
"No Surprise here! Down another 20% before next earnings miss,then $20.'s and JCP numbers!"
"""Buy low sell high"" I don't know who's going to buy Amazon at its highest. It's better buy Kohl at it's low. Retail will come back to the life very quickly and within 6 month nobody will remember covid."
only a fool or a manipulating fund is buying at this price.
Averaging $19 here. Feeling good about this one.
"This is ridiculous....All I can do is laugh,,,Sell before the news is the new way..."
"Yeah not good, this year is in the crapper. Will have to see where cash end ups. Revenue was decent, which likely has to do with online sales but the store miss was pretty big (interesting considering the revenue beat)."
anyone listening to conference call? any highlights you'd like to share?
"I drop in on this board from time to time. I was in years ago and traded between $36 and $45. When this stock was well above $60 even a few months ago people thought that I was crazy to consider it to drop that far. Well here we are. Not quite cheap enough for me yet but I wish you all luck. Oh yes, the stores were busy at sub $40 share price."
KSS is a winner and RAD is too.
No longer trading this stock. Discontinuing the My Pillow line was an insane thing to do. If KSS wants to kill free enterprise over their political ties. I am not comfortable investing my dollars into a company managed such as that. Trying to kill an product Made in the USA KSS should be ashamed of themselves.
Citigroup downgrades KSS. chart overextended. correction coming.
"On a techical stand point...if this stays below the 20 DMA, which it is doing now, it will confirm that it is a good short play for earnings disappointment."
Kohl's hosting its own Prime Day today. told my wife about this today. She spent 188.00; saved 180.00 and came away with 45.00 Kohls cash. Nice shopping. My question is why did I have to find out about this on line and no mention on TV or Radio.
What this company needs is a bunch of new directors that have experience ruining other retail businesses....oh wait....I think they just accomplished that.
"shorts go away , you'll get burned on a big news report !!"
"I read through the CC and they highlighted a tax savings which gave them a lower tax rate in Q3. So I think like Target Kohl's missed on earnings. How this washes out over the next few days we will have to see, clearly technically damage has been done and these massive sell-offs over the last couple of years take a while to recover. Fortunately the dividend yield is better than the 10 year so even if you have dead money for a few years you aren't doing any worse than treasuries."
Polls indicate Trump and Republicans are in for a massive loss in Nov.Its going to be a landslide defeat for Trump and the Republicans in the US Senate.That is great news for the world and the USA! The end of the harmful trade war and a returnto prosperity and normality with the world and restoration of good relations with the world.Watch for a gain in stocks.
Order online with kerbside pickup is an excellent idea. A positive step towards opening of stores.
"Dillards got a nice pop post earnings, Macy's up to bat in the morning."
I don't know what is going on with the pricing but I just bought some more. I still can't complain my other KSS holdings I bought a little over 6 months ago for $18 share.
Any news?
You were told to short this after the gain as any sensible strategist would do. KSS will like other stores be near empty if they open due to the residule effect so trade it like it should be traded. They have less than 3 months before it colapses in price and debt bites them big.
"Looks like Macy's is even up a lot today and Kohl's might even end up closing above its 200 dma, which would be a real bad sign for the shorts. Likely we are seeing short covering on this news as they don't want to be short into the best quarter of the year for these retailers and from the earnings news today the chance that the revenue collapse is done may indeed be the story."
this will fall like maceys
It was like a mini earnings report. With one week less for shopping- that’s a very good number.
Tripled since October.....lol.
Now that's more like it. Green is good.
Almost $50/share today!! Soon 60 will be the new destination
https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/18/kohls-sees-billions-in-market-share-free-as-retailers-go-bankrupt.html
"do you think this is shorts covering, or people just loading up at low prices for the dividend next week? Doesn't seem like very high volume"
Kohl's reached a 52 Week low at 30.77
"Nice to see this stock holding pretty strong after a nice run up to $40. I had feared a big sell off, but is longs believe in the future. Still wouldn’t be surprised if it dipped to $35 before running back to the 40s and holding there"
is this the next stonk ? ha ha
"BABA AMZN...two behemoth from two different countries where each don't have presence in the other's territory. Would Amazon go to China? Would Alibaba come to the US? My humble opinion is these two companies are growing so fast, they have a need to keep growing to increase their moat. I have a feeling one of these two will #$%$ up KSS. AMZN need a bric and mortar location and BABA who is already buying bric and mortar in China is looking to the US for growth. AMZN is closely watching BABA. besides any of these two can buy KSS for $80 a share with just 2% of their market cap."
Another buying opportunity.
Kohl’s product offerings cater to a favorable market niche. They will learn to better harness their huge advantage over online retailers like Amazon! With a footprint that places their stores within a ten minute drive of 80% of all Americans in predominantly stand alone warehouses the potential leverage they have for developing greater online sales by offering immediate pickup or same day delivery will give them huge multichannel clout!
"You can only raise the COL so much before the consumer taps out. Don’t know about you guys but our electric, gas, water, grocery, insurance and tuition has only gone up. Our only savings right now is streaming TV. And with that our discretionary spending is way down. KSS is just the start. I fear the recession is upon us."
"If banks were forced to merge or sell to other Banks during 2008 financial crisis, something similar will be executed in the retail space this time."
and the short position continues to grow and significantly. This is going to become quite ugly at some point if KSS doesn't roll over soon for them.
no way am I stupid to touch this !
Why is it going up fast this morning? 5% up already!
by next June this will be 60 if not more .
"When the stimulus money runs out, people are going to have to pull their money out of the market to pay their bills. Watch the collapse in this and the other overpriced stocks."
Tempted to buy here with a nice dividend but I still think that it will drop to $40 by Nov.
Safe play at 16
this is idiotic
"Nearly 3M shares added to the short position in the last weeks of April, so the drop below $60 was short driven. Just like it is likely the drop earlier this week was short driven. That should explain the ability not to rally to test the highs again lately. Earnings should show them that they are wrong to short Kohl's, the question then will be when do they cover. It might take till the fall before they throw in the towel again."
CEO announced their finances are very strong and they are in solid healthy position to grow and prosper the business as well as being prepared for any problems.KSS future is very bright as a covid survivor with far less competitors.
"Please don't squeeze the Charmin!Actually KSS runs up on the short position report date a lot. So it will be interesting to see what the numbers are. Remember, shorts must cover at some point because the dividend will crush them long term. That leaves a lot of upside ammunition in the stock. Granted on a squeeze we will overshoot but reality is the real price of the stock is significantly higher than the current price."
Look at DDS today. Down $10 on a good report. Wow I hope that doesn't happen to KSS when we report. M and now DDS
"negative a penny by the close, come on shorts, you can do it!"
rediculesly cheap!
Target and Costco will be doing the same thing as soon as people get over this toilet paper fetish.
16.70s now. Are you longs still holding ?
Just saw new CEO on TV.She is a looker and smart also.
This company is poised to grow.. 70 dollar weekend
Trump's policies are killing retailers possibly KSS bottomed today....I said possibly!
We need a private investing firm to come in and over pay for this stock.
"2 Simple questions before you by KSS at $17.Who needs a new wardrobe, when everyone is stuck at home ? With more than 20mm people being unemployed, are new cloths a priority?Just an FYI: M is trading at $5"
"Houston ACRX has launched... ACRX hope you watching, and especially hope you own, ACRX 700 percent upside based on the updated 11/18 valuation... my other children are $FB $VKTX $NFLX $TSLA $WMT $TGT $FL $KSS $BBY"
"Impressive, but just the tip of the iceberg"
Come on Kohls help save AMERICA. Just come take a look at what we are doing DECN.
"With AMZN giving back today (Friday), the shorts may try to cover their positions in retailers. Request comments"
"Good Morning...any thoughts about today? Did KSS really go back up in after market trading last night where nothing else did much or was that a Yahoo glitch? Also, does anyone have a good way to check what after hours/premarket prices are? The times KSS is update on Yahoo seem very scattered and random, and sometimes I can't see them at all? Thanks"
Kramer has turned into a snow flake.
I sold haha we'll see if that was smart or not
"Up 10% pre-market - did Amazon acquire KSS LOL, Seriously, any news???"
Kss is a traitor by partnering with Amazon. I will never set foot in another store.
$46.70!! Yikes!! Traders are running for Z-Doors!
Bad news just keeps coming! Christmas Eve will be less than $30
"Department store Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) said in a recent investor presentation that it expects to fully return to pre-pandemic operating margin levels.Kohl's highlighted an operating margin goal of 7% to 8% in a normalized shopping environment. This goal is not only consistent with historical trends, but marks an improvement from 2019's margin of 6.4%.Kohl's focus is on maintaining a strong balance sheet to keep an investment-grade rating. Recent progress from Kohl's toward these goals includes a sooner-than-expected $1-billion revolver payment in October.The company should continue allocating excess cash toward reducing leverage, and its adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR should improve from 6.1 times at the end of the second quarter to 3.5 times in fiscal 2021.This story is definitely starting to sound pretty solid. I also think that people are starting to feel that it is nice to go out and do a little shopping. It feels good to just to go out from your home and pick up some new fresh items.GLTA Longs!"
"Judging by the RSI alone, which is at 46.08 on the daily chart – overall I think we will see upside in the short-term. Perhaps a pullback next day or so could occur I suppose but are yall also seeing a further leg higher? Yo you should really check out awesome-STOCKS, they seem on point with their stocks."
"Thank you KSS!!!! 5,500 In at a $13.28avg, out at 19.48!!!! 15 days later!!!!!! $34.100 in TWO weeks!!!! Thank you KSS!!!! Would let it ride but need some dry powder. I’ve still got other retail exposure, 5,100 FIVE in at $53, up $150k-ish hoping it gets to $120 in 12mo! Thanks again KSS."
It will droop again....
"Drop likely because of lawsuit filed against several stores including Kohl's because of false sale prices. J C Penny and Sears got hit hard as well from same lawsuit in California. Tough news, hope it's settled quickly."
I agree with uclothing is a tough business
$KSS longs feel like this.
21 dollar today
Buy under 45 IMO
"Sell before too late, bad news will be coming anytime"

Shorts are going to see their losses mount in the foreseeable future.
OOPs! Looks like yesterday was a rare buying opportunity and a time for shorts to escape their losing positions. For Mr. Negatives they jumped into the fire from the frying pan!! Market fluctuations are to be expected. This stock is on a strong upward trend!! Will continue all year!!
what is going on here?
kSS got beat down after reporting strong earnings??? I like my $54 average. Should run to $80 by the EOM.

Buy at $9....coming soon
Crickets
Been thinking about buying with current market cap of 4 billion I would think the real estate would be worth that much ? Plus 4 dollars in cash so much of retail has been hammered Macy’s is a 5 dollar stock so hard to kno what to do with interest rates at 0 I would think they would refinance debt and dividend is 16 per cent in a 0 interest market but sounds like it will be cut according to posts I’ve read if a person knew the div wouldn’t be cut it s a screaming buy
Where is the Volume?????Not good at all
Take your money out of this and buy something else stocks are up today across the board cake cheesecake is up like 18%
Methinks it's time to load up some more for the next round up.
KSS reached a 52 Week low at 35.18
"-10% is a bit ridiculous, solid growth, what am I missing here"
"OK, I am throwing the Overdone flag on this decline. Trading like it preannounced a shortfall, which it has not."
I see 14 on this. I like KSS at 14 support.
Green baby! Don’t doubt me lol
"MJ, you get it, unlike 90% of investors. KSS will be fine and the dividend is going to be fine. No reason to panic sell any further. M will be fine too and they did not cut their dividend. Read balance sheets and stop listening to Wall Street!"
Showing some strength today.....
"oh, what to do. what are your thought @gerhard ?"

A lot of kids are starting to physically go back to school now in CA
60 this week
I'm out!!!! Good luck all!
"Many analysts are saying the profit margins are too low. The margin is in line with Best Buy, 1% more than Walmart, and just a tick below Target. Don't believe the bankruptcy that everyone predicts"
Amazon looking into buying JCP? I was hoping KSS would be a much better fit.
"December Retail sales report rescheduled for Thursday of next week. That should be positive new, we likely get the January report on the following week, maybe two weeks."
"so who can explain today's action?Market up 2.2%., there was not much volatility whole day. $JWN from +2% went -1% negative by 1pm and after recovered and closed 1.36% positive. While $M and $KSS was almost flat whole day. Is some one closing position? some one shorting it? or option plays?"
I bet they don't offer guidance on earnings call and stock gets hammered.
kss will ride lower with S AND P until new bottom is formed.
"I just got back from a Kohl's store in a fairly upscale part of town looking for a little something for my wife's birthday. Hadn't been in there for a while and I was amazed how rapidly this store declined. It was a freakin' mess! Clothes thrown haphazardly on the shelves, clothes all over the floor, and really nothing decent for a baby boomer aged woman. She prefers a size large in shirts, but there were hardly any available. A lot of small, medium and petite, though. I noticed most of the women looking around were quite large for the most part, probably 2X types, so what do they do? I bought a small bottle of perfume off the shelf - there was no one working behind the jewelry counter - and went to Kroger for an Amazon gift card. Target is a mess, Macy's is having trouble, JC penny's, Sears, and now I'm totally unimpressed with Kohl's... except the cashier was quite pleasant is the only good thing I can say. My point? Big box retail is dying and they are killing themselves. Management is out of touch with customers, ancillary help is non-existent, and prices are not in line with what you get. So what to do? Short Kohl's? Short Target? Or is it bad enough that I should just find an appropriate retail ETF to short... or maybe all of the above? Damn, I used to like a lot of those stores."
"AMZN raises prime membership by 20%...My take, they are not THAT profitable in their e-commerce operation due to higher costs and are pressuring margins...they need the membership increase to defray some of those costs...looks like the pop at the open in KSS stock is positive for the take over theses...AMZN need bric and mortar to be more profitable in their e-commerce biz."
"Having knocked down Maceys they could spare this one.Wallstreet does not wish too much predictability.The other day a big industrial warned but theypushed it higher.On the other handthey may sell Target,which is much more richly valued."
"Stocks like M and KSS are going th way of the Dodo bird. After Amazon and others like Amazon fro round the world get through with these companies, there won't be anything left but memories. Stay away!!!"
People are spending! Retail sales up! Up a huge 5.3 percent!
KSS stock is worth a minimum of $60-75/share!If this covd nonsense had not occurred you wouldn't have ever had a chance to buyat this cheap prices and I might add very temporary price dip.
Why is this at a 52 week low?
Can we hold the lows?
This stock is really getting to my nerve.
Is it something has to do with JCP and their CEO leaving???
No earthly reason to own this. Writing is on the wall. Save your money
Only stupid people would buy this stock. Its the equivalent of buying Blockbuster stock in todays netflix era. Or buying taxi stock in todays Uber. You all know retailers will die out in the next 3-5 years. p.s I hate Amazon but they are taking over.
KSS is down -4.94% to 52.91
Over 17 again time for Ruiz and Jack to short more.
"@David, you drink too much coffee today? Love your sentiment behind the many posts! Where did you hear Amazon is interested in KSS stock?"
You buy dress cloths from Kohls for what? when you are working from home with your pajamas?Overhead of KSS is way too much. WMT is the best.Gl!
"Kohls, nice dividend, room to grow, one of the only retaliers left. Sears out, Kmart out, Pennys out, Kohls is for those who won't got to Walfart"
Another positive news for KSS....Bon Ton is closing over 40 stores and they are located near Kohl's stores so it is no brainer that Kohl's will pick up customers.
"We will soon know what is causing this drop in the stock price as the initial move happened before 4/15. So tomorrow with the short position on XRT and KSS we can see whether that was real selling or shorting driving the price down. My guess is shorting.Stoxx is trying to scare people into believing this is a weak Q1 but this is also misplaced as Q1/18 will be compared to Q1/17 not Q4/17. Further, the big increase in consumer spending in Q4 is mitigating in Q1 but that doesn't mean it isn't much stronger than it was in Q1/17. So odds are retail was stronger in Q1/18 than Q/17, especially for Kohl's. Then there is the positive that the company already took down Q1 expectations because they saw the weak February. March was much stronger and we will see before earnings how strong April was. In the end this is Q1, it is one of the worst quarters of the year. Even if they miss it can have only a small impact on yearly earnings which is driven by Q4 sales."
hate to see an EPS miss - lot of potential for them in the future with some major players getting knocked out (JCP and maybe Macys??) - if you're a shareholder I'd give this account a follow https://twitter.com/Clifton_Capital/status/1262700780152401922
"If you have not sold get out now, this will be $15 today"
A better investment would be burning your money at least it will keep you warm. KSS your money goodbye!
"I would have kept my money here, but sold a month ago because shareholders dividends was more important than committing to the purchases of goods already made. These people in poor countries made goods that could have been sold in stores , even at a discount . But the poor investors needed their dividends or they’d cry like babies. . Shameful , the world is in this together."
"For maximum pain, looking at options, Kss will close near or at 60 today!"
My speculation is that AMZN might be interested in buying KSS.
"Now thet I'm well stocked I'm going shopping ,and you all know where we go from now on ,KHOLS!"
"Listened to the CC this morning. Very positive one. CEO and COO were both articulate and optimistic about the progress they are making. dividend restoration in 1H 2021 is a big plus. I see $32 - $35 by the year. Go, KSS!"
"While it does seem like an eternity, locally our stores have only been closed for 5 full weeks. Analysts have said Kohls have enough cash to stay closed for 6 months. That was BEFORE the new secured revolver which added another $500M. Meanwhile they're doing online orders which I presume are higher than historical numbers and curb-side pickups which will both cushion the blow to revenue.Unlike restaurants retail will be one of the easiest types of businesses to reopen and maintain social distancing. I don't see anyone too concerned about walmart or Lowes being open."
"So what has fundamentally changed since May of 2019 when all of the Mall retailers and even off Mall retailers crashed?We had a year of lock downs which devastated sales and earnings for four quarters and still impacting sales.We have retailers who have had to greatly reduce inventories to reduce carrying costs on merchandise, so stores are woefully short of stock in most cases and we still have supply chain issues.We have retailers who have had to take on massive amounts of debt to make it through the pandemic.We have unemployment double what it was then.We have stagnant wage growth. Now on to some positives,Traditional brick and mortar retailers did develop on-line marketing and sales presence competing with the likes of Amazon, even though many retailers really didn't compete with the on-line sector as many sold products that people just don't buy on-line.Some competition has disappeared, so more opportunities.Pent up demand as consumers have saved trillions of dollars throughout the pandemic, though so far have been rather resistant to spending it.Also we have more stimulus money, again though many people not spending it.With those negatives and positives I have a very difficult time justifying the current valuations of retail when compared to May of 2019 when the economic landscape was much better. Please tell me why you think this stock or any retailer really should be at the current levels."
Back up the truck!
it is nice to see no profits giving to non-profits.
Dying business model. Soon they will own worthless warehouses and be filing for bankruptcies.
"Well interest rates are cratering again. That should get the deep in the money call writers excited again. Kohl's is a great stock for that. So the gimmick is you buy the stock and sell deep in the money calls, as deep as 66% of the stock price as long as the option premium is larger than the next dividend payment. That effectively gives you a 50% increased dividend payout and significant downside protection. Usually you sell the January leaps two year out, so now the Jan 2021 45 calls. Looking at the bid on that you are pocketing 2 additional dividend payments with that strategy so effectively getting nine 67 cent dividend payments over the next 22 months plus another $1.30 in option premium. That is a very attractive return on a $45 cost basis with substantial downside protection in the stock. Indeed, you wouldn't even lose money till the stock closed below $40."
Picking winning stocks is hard work when you don’t know what to do. I was losing big time until I found these guys (http://Fairstox.com). So glad I joined them.
Kohls will lose market share and get crushed by JC Penney and Macy's after they file chapter 11 bankruptcy and emerge debt free. Unless Kohls files bankruptcy they won't be able to compete. So the analyst who cut his price target to 25.00 is wrong. My price target is 10.00 and below.
Waiting for 59.00 !!!!!!!!!
First close in the 50s today! 60s are next!
KSS reached a 52 Week low at 11.40
5% dividend for those who bought at 20! For me it is 7.5%!
What about purchasing Target instead of Kohls?
THE KOHLS CASH PROGRAM DOESNT WORK TO ITS FULL POTENTIAL. THE CASH SHOULD BE GOOD FOR AT LEAST A MONTH AND NEEDS TO BE TRANSFERABLE VIA YOUR PHONE ON AN APP. WE USE OUR PHONE FOR EVERYTHING SO LETS USE IT AS A GIFT CARD TYPE EXCHANGE.
KSS reached a 52 Week low at 21.40
CFRA is simply wrong on their sell opinion for this stock. KSS is a strong retailer with great management. Pressure from internet-only based competitors is overblown. This is at bargain levels this morning.
"like Anonymous said could have popped it at 76, or at least stopped it at 69 this stinker just ate all my DIS gain"
"With China's Tariffs on everything made in China, smart money says move away from retail!Less income and more expensive everything! Doesn't take a genius to know what everyone cuts back on first!"
many stores opening today.....outlook is fairly decent......most stores have been SHIPPING out 800+ online orders daily via UPS so qtrly report might not be that dismal.....this could really take flight soon
"""The Credit Agreement described above is intended to provide the Company with additional financial flexibility. In addition, on April 15, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors decided to suspend the Company’s regular quarterly cash dividend beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The Company remains committed to paying a dividend over the long-term and will seek to resume paying a dividend following stabilization in the environment."""
I got to buy cheap ! let the shopping begin!
Every business shutdown. If Kohl's can survive 1/2 months then either all businesses are jokes or market maker are playing games.
"The investor group estimates that $3 billion in sale-leaseback proceeds, combined with an effectively executed share repurchase program, could increase [earnings per share] by at least 25 percent,” the activists said."
"Ordered my $KSS Gassless Chaps online, very slow delivery."
Great time for AMZN to come and buy the free-standing Kohls!
If you don't think there is much BK risk...I think you buy long term calls only on this one...safest play.
"So, just one month ago everything was great and The outlook for Kohls was bright. Based on the comments I’m seeing here, it’s as if they’re going to BK before the end of summer. They missed estimates and guided lower for the current fiscal year, sure. However, they’re still profitable and produce decent cash flow, pay a solid dividend that the company can easily afford (with no imminent signs of reduction), have reduced debt over the last year, and have bought back their own stock. Perhaps they’ll have to pull back on some of these activities (don’t mess with the dividend), but this story is far from over."
"Future div will be cut soon, that is for sure.but the real question is can kohls survive? Do you feel safe to shop at walmart, or smaller size store like Kohl's, or mall based store like Macy's? what do everyone think?"
How much dividend they announced per share ? Please Help
Fair value - $12.57 per share.....where did you get that price????

Garbage stock
How many times has this CEO made earnings...
"More money, and more money!"
Kss would be in struggle it’s a short position stock $15 and below
Kohl’s closing its brick and mortar locations starting tonight until the end of March. The market will no doubt drive the share price down to single digits.
Bottom is in
"On dividend yield alone, Kohl's should hold current price. The only thing that can drive it lower is uncontrollable panic. That would be a buying opportunity we won't see again for a very long time."
"50 is the new 80.... Before KSS couldn't hold 80... now it can't seem to hold $50 a share.By the last quarter of 2020, it will likely be fighting to hold $40.Everyone is betting on Amazon returns to boost floor traffic.Think about it. What better proof of where the retail market is heading than relying on ""returns"" of the industry leader.Absent a hugely improved online presence, Kohls is positioned to join a steady decline in in-store retail.Every year more and more shoppers of all income levels are heading online.Counting on picking up a few crumb sales from those returning Amazon purchases is like placing a bet on the return of buffalo herds to the Great Plains."
Amazon is lurking!
What is this pretrade spike about? Any news?
"Amazing how the computers are gaming the markets, they are choosing individual stocks in various sectors to tank at various times, meanwhile running up other stocks in the same sector, then dumping those stocks and running up the ones they were tanking, making huge spreads for huge potential profits. Most stocks have seen ""recoveries"" of nearly 10% in some cases already, then they start to tank them again. So much money being generated for the uber wealthy."
Could pin the close at 18 due to 903 open call contracts.
"So, what about profit taking? At what point is the rug going to be yanked out from underneath us??"
"Down $2 this morning on relatively low volume, looks like we aren't getting short raped today, which is a positive. Let's see how we close and what the volume is like. That will likely tell us whether we have some shorts looking for a covering opportunity or not."
"My wife and teen age daughters are all out at Kohls today shopping for clothes.We stopping buying clothes during the shut down because we never buy clothes ONLINE or at inappropriate places like Walmart of Target because they sell cheap junk no fit for wearing.So we had to wait until our favorite clothes stores like Macys and Kohls were back open.Today we going on a fun shopping spree at Macys and Kohls today.Awesome bargains on incredible stylish clothes to die for styles.There is a reason 75% of all clothes are bought at brick and mortar stores!That will never change.We never buy clothes online! It is insane to buy clothes online. I checked and it would take me 2 and half months for get a pair of pajamas from Amazon.Who wants to want two months to get a pajamas or pants or shirts?Not only that, it may not fit, may not be quality material or for a host of reasons I may need to return it too.I go down to Kohls or Macys today and I find what I want immediately and have it today!Amazon, Target and Walmart are so over loaded you have to wait weeks or months to get anything from them.I am not buying anything from Amazon, or Walmart or Target until they fix that slow delivery system. Their delivery system is broken. Macys or Kohls will deliver an online order in two to 3 days and you can pick it up at the store in one day.You know Amazon is going to lose a lot of business because people aren't going to wait weeks or months for delivery. Kohls and Macys are In for a huge comeback in sales!!!Don't believe me? Try to place an order on Amazon, Walmart or Target. Macys and Kolhs have them beat in price and faster delivery! BY weeks not days."
$20.50 8/21 calls will double by friday
"So we have seen some negative action on retailers based on the monthly retail sales numbers. Last month was a -0.3% print that was revised to just -0.1% and this month came in below forecasts at -0.1% as well. Negative numbers don't look good but they are month to month comparisons, not year to year. So a strong November December is casting a shadow into the early months this year. That actually means retailers are likely doing much better this year than last."
PFE/BNTX got the nod from the FDA ADCOM meeting today. EUA over the weekend. This will help retail stocks

Hefty hefty dividend on the way! Playing catch-up
"Retail business will be affected when you have 40 mil unemployed, ~4mil infected. One of my cousin works at Kohl's as VP and he is looking to switch jobs because of job security. if you wait and see till 08/18 earnings call will beat the price back to teens where it actually belong."

By April end Stores will be opened for online order pickup. This is good time to ramp up e-commerce sales.

"Bhwahaha!!!! I bought 5,000 shares in April at $12-13!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"$30 this week, $40 when they provide updated guidance and $50 when they pay back the revolver and reinstate the dividend!!"
I don't think Kohl's will last... their prices are too high... need to cut prices to bring more customers in...
This stock is riding the back of the XRT. That ETF will be dumping Kohls in droves. Dump the dead weight.
Macy’s was up 2.5% That’s gone too ????
who do you believe? the clown on CNBC or the CEO of kss ?
Yahoo Finance VideoKohl’s Q1 sales soars past estimates53.97 -6.28 (-10.42%)
Cramer negative on KSS.Buy all you can.
It should have closed positive yesterday. Will make up most of yesterday's decline.
I think much of this pull back is just profit taking after the dividend record date ..
KSS best stock of 2020
"Will take some pain this morning but that is more market related I think and maybe a bit of JCP, which also looks like a dead man walking. Analysts already are taking up earnings estimates with us currently at 30% earnings growth over 2017 by next year. So that will support a market multiple on the stock or more. Price targets should also becoming up. So once we get this retest of the latest correction behind us, hopefully today, we should get moving north again. Especially if the shorts are using this opportunity to reduce their positions, something that likely happened yesterday after the big drop."
"I ran a Bernoulli distribution on the KSS chart and it appears a strong force is driving the stock price to the 42.50 level by July 1st.After that date and level is reached, the future is not so clear.Leave me negative at this point."
Little Rob got the pivot point up his arrogant #$%$.
If youre spending your stimulus on KSS you might as well as flush your money down a drain. This company has always been the worst of the worst in retailing. Another Mervyns!
I had a great run with Kohl's the past 3 weeks. I think I will take my wife there today and spend a little of the money we made on this great stock.
"If we are lucky this will be a nice exhaustion gap cleansing any of the last weak hands in the stock that based so nicely at the low $60's earlier this year. We might see a ferocious rally into the close today if shorts are taking their profits. A nice huge long tail on the chart would be very bullish for the stock technically. Remember, Kohl's has a history over the last year or two of getting butchered after positive earnings, so longs need not worry, the report was quite solid for the future."
"Kohl's closes all 1,100 stores due to coronavirus, cuts guidance!... they lasted longer than some"
"So if you look at the yearly chart you will see we tested the lows with the down move today and had a higher low than the prior lows. That's a positive. If Kohl's can end up over its 200 dma it will not be a pretty chart for shorts, indeed with the rally so far they may even go positive by the end of the day if the markets rally."
KSS was unfairly beaten down. it’s time to backup the truck- Strong buy!
"1y Target Est 21.06, overpriced will drop again quickly very soon"
backing up the truck today. can't keep a great company like this down.
"I feel really bad for all those who refused to close out their short positions back when this thing was in the upper 40’s / low 50’s. Oh wait, no I don’t."
Dividend date June 13th. 3.66% pay out
"it's not like people go shopping to Kohl's in hoards of 50 or something. I know the sales are going to soften, bit this kind of carnage is uncalled for."
November 5th this covid 19 is all over .then kss will move higher.
too late to get in ? I think I missed the boat.
"In recent decades, department stores have essentially morphed into apparel stores, as they shuttered or shrunk departments like electronics or home goods (among others) and filled those spaces with apparel. Yet shoppers have pulled back on their discretionary spending on apparel as casual wear has become more acceptable in the workplace, and at events like religious services and life milestones like weddings. Plus, when they do spend on apparel, they tend to favor low prices, and frequent discounters like mass merchants or off-price stores. Deloitte: In 1987, the average consumer allocated 5.9% of their spending to apparel and services, but by 2017, that had plummeted to 3.1%. $M $JWN $JCP $KSS. lol"
Warren Buffet sold all his stake in OXY because people are not driving to Kohl’s to shop!
Sales are down 23% but the stock is down 55% from last year.COVID wont last forever. Most the market is back to pre-covid numbers but for some reason Kohl's is down more then it should be.
KSS is killing it!
Kohl's to the moon and Michael back to his trailer park--hahaha
Yup really a bargain today. I am all in just like Texas hold em. KROGER and KOHLS will rise above the storm. KROGER will in about 4 weeks. Their sales are up over 30%
Bag holders who didn’t sell today when they see the open tomorrow..
"Interesting, looks like a huge bet on the October $60's for Kohl's which are selling for 50 cents. Seems to me someone is bettering Kohl's will test the 200 dma before Q3 earnings, which seems like a reasonable bet. That would be a 3-5 bagger if they held till then, or if Kohl's moves up a quick double, which likely means they sell half and let the rest ride till the 200 dma gets tested."
A good amount of buisness in Las Vegas Kohl's store.
Most of the employees furloughed. Expenses are low. Digital sales are booming. Curb side pickup is doing well. Bottom line is intact. Once stores open nothing will stop. Usually stores are not that full.
This Quarter Kohls will become officially eCommerce company.Why it matter? Some bull will fire power will create new valuation model comparing wayfair and other eCommerce and says Kohls is best stock and 10x undervalue compare to those and look 50%+ revenue is from online only and another 20% from buy online pickup in store.
Out of the many retailers that will go under it's hard to see Kohl being one of them. Literally every woman I know loves shopping there. It may drop below $10 in the short term but long term this can easily be at least a 3-bagger.
"KSS gets the headlines today and all of the loser shorties come out of the woodwork to bash away. Sorry that you’ve been getting your rear end handed to you the last several weeks, but this is not going to crash back down to the teens or twenties or whatever anytime soon."
KSS is up 5.12% to 65.96
"Punishing Kohls for Friends and Family is like punishing Amazon for Prime membership. Sales are Sales, EPS and upward guidance tells the story. Fake Analyst's LOL"
"Sigh, it doesn't look like we will be up $2 this morning. What a turkey this stock has become! If you check the charts you will see a small pull back day is in all of our runs when we head into that overbought land. So I think nothing to worry about. Even a pullback to $70 would be quite healthy I think. That of course assumes there is one. If enough shorts get called by their brokers the morning might turn into a positive party. After all the trade tensions are a positive for US based corporations."
"Look, love or hate trump...just be cautious of your on the sidelines looking to come in here. Wait until there is an official deal because this market is RUN by his tweets. It’s in his best interest to keep it green, but that also means the trade talks could be fabricated in his interest. Again, good or bad, just realize the trends here so you don’t get false hope"
COULDGET DOWNGRADED ANYTIME NOW THEN WATCH FREEFALLOVERTHE CLIFF CANDCRASH CRASH BELOW $12
physical retail is done folks. Home Depot and Walmart only exceptions
To celebrate this run up in the pps I am going to head to my local Kohls and splurge a bit. Also I have to spend that yes2you rewards before it expires. I must say Kohl's has the best darn loyalty program out there. Keeps the customers hooked.
$49 Upgrade today!!!
EX-dividend date is next Tuesday so the price will go up today and Monday big time. No selling for me.
Who is ready for the next big Nasdaq alert? Ultimete Stock Ale@rtsq (google them) has delivered some big winners already this year and their next play could be the biggest yet. Don’t miss.
"michaelRlulz No use muting me, that won't take your desperation away. Like I said, quit stressing over your loss and just cover your KSS position. You will sleep better."
"You might be tempted to buy if it goes up a few dollars. Sure do that is you want, but this stock is positioned for massive gains over the year and as the V shaped recovery moves forward this stock is going to $60 and then will hit $75.If you are a trader, a few dollars per share might seem good, but how about $40 per share profit?If you are a long term investor, that might seem good too, but the icing on the cake will be when they restore the dividend too and the stock buyback programs.A long-term investor can watch this soar, enjoy the massive capital gains and instead of selling hold and collect the dividends too. This stock long-term in a few years will hit $100- $150/share and you get a juicy dividend too.Great retirement income and tax free gains for your IRA."
"I hope everyone is Boycotting anything Amazon. Since Kohls sold out to Amazon, I have to boycott them now."
So where to from here? Any opinions? BTW my local Kohls remains packed with shoppers.
"$18B in sales (TTM), and $3.5B market cap? Gimme a break. Kohl's has 10M+ e-commerce App users on Android aloneLululemon is the flip-side of market skew here. $4B sales (TTM) and $50B market cap. Only 10k+ e-commerce App users on Android."
so when will the shorts enter today?? time for the daily repetitive short sellers to burn!!
No parent in their right mind will send there kids to school until a cure is at hand. Stop with he be pumping a company that will go belly up next year. Kohls was on hard times last two years. You lose it you buy and hold. Idgits. Send your kids to die. Yeah right.
"Well enough warning of this minor miss with the two downgrades and other retailers, so hopefully we can recover some of the losses by the end of the day. The important thing now is not setting new lows and then we see how things look with Q4 earnings. My guess is they will keep the dividend intact but reduce the buyback to $300-400M. With Q4 earnings we can then see if the new CFO has just been cleaning house after what looks like some poor work by the prior hire who may have been inflating earnings numbers. The business is definitely challenged though so I wouldn't be hoping for more than stable earnings projections for next year, assuming they come in at $4.75 I could see them guiding $4.55 to $4.95 if the business is still in reasonable shape. Anything below that would signal that they are in a lot more trouble than it seems."
Do not listen to CNBC Fast Money!!!!!!!!!!!! A bunch of clueless idiots. What a joke.
"Buyback 250,000 shares of stock now. Sale/Leaseback 25 stores where Kohl's owns building,at long term low rental rates. Open a Furniture Department and these changes will enable the stockto triple and make Kohl's the new Macy's!"
So many pumpers on here I love you and love taking your money. Thank you for your weekly contributions!
"such Manipulation by fund, hope tragedy hits their families to stop stealing!!!!!"
Is this Dividend safe assuming the Virus runs the course and is a non issue by year end?
"Nice to see KSS moving up. Was mystified as to their struggles. Of course the virus was the main reason. My wife, her sister, their friends all swear by Kohl's! Even my buds and I shop at Kohl's. They have excellent prices, plenty of inventory and an amazing return policy. Their selections are also fashionable.Not only from an investment perspective but stores like Kohl's need our support. Let's not see any more closing like Sears!!"
As long as liberals are freaking out over the virus this will go nowhere
"Pfizer just announced the final analysis of their final testing of the covid vaccine shows it is 95 percent effective. They said they have developed a dry ice pack that allows shipping and storage for 15 days and that they plan on seeking approval for all the world's drug approval agencies including the FDA in a couple of DAYS.Yes, Days, not weeks!They have been manufacturing the vaccine and have 50 million doses available for distribution this year and will begin immediately to distribute and vaccine people in a few days after the FDA approves it.FDA approval is certain to be extremely fast.This ends the covid crisis! Many of Macys competitors are out of business which means we can see Macys sales and earnings soar in 2021. Macys will be trading like a robust growth company. Indeed it will turn into a growth company."
"So one way to handle the psychological impact of your stocks going down every day pretty much is if you are a dividend investor look at your yield. That means as stocks drop the yield on your portfolio is increasing, which is a positive, especially if you dividend invest. While it doesn't mitigate the paper loss on the principle, it does give you a little positive tone to offset the negative."
"Now that AMZN's dog and pony show is over..time is now available for both AMZN and KSS management to discuss how their partnership in Amazon Returns and Amazon Pop Up stores has performed during the holidays....So during these discussions the question really comes to either or...either AMZN continues and expand with the partnership or AMZN buys KSS. Remember though that KSS is looking to partner with someone to lease part of their floor space and if those floor space is leased to other than AMZN, then AMZN is ""locked"" out of those and future floor space...so on a strategic basis, does would AMZN want to lose those potentially valuable spaces now and in the future? I don't think so!"
This is stupidity. At this point I think the market has bottomed and so has retail.
Under 40 will stick a fork in it.
Div. yield is under 4 and the 10 year is over 3! What did you expect would happen? It's not Rocket Science people!! Plus it's a frickin retail box stiore with over priced merch!
Here we go again.PPS being jerked around by the market for no reason in hopes of shaking out weak hands.
"I think people miss just how profitable Kohl's is. If you take out the $989M they spent buying back debt last year, net cash would have increased from $1,308M to $1,823M and over $500M increase. So after paying out a $400M dividend and buying back $399M worth of stock the company generated an extra $515M in cash. That is just amazing."
kohls can turn things around I'm sure that they are listening and taking notesa to zwink wink
"I knew this was coming. Macy’s reports garbage, and KSS pays the price........"
Even with a down market KSS will rise
"why is Kohls still dropping, while WMT, OLLI, & TGT seem to be slowly gaining?"
Why is this stock taking such a hit? I'm thinking of buying some more shares. Any info?
"I love it when ""obviously dumb"" happens on wall street and I'm able to take advantage of it."
down down down to the rocky icy cold abbis !
Activist investors are there for a reason- Kohl’s earnings are not good.
"Visit yesterday (Sunday, June 14) to Green Bay, WI store. Moderately busy. Lots of markdown racks with some items up to 85% off. Winter coats galore as they were closed when they should have been closing them out in March - April.Was looking for a good Spring / Fall type jacket with a full zipper (not a pull over). Found a nice Under Armour one but it was $55, a little out of my range. Looked at some mark down stuff. Good variety, but nothing that fit my current needs..............Kel..........a holder"
KSS is a white hot stock of the future.
Amazon made a mistake partnering with Kohl's
"People just don't get it! Amazon is just using Kohl's for returns, Bezos has no interest in buying a dying big box retail chain!If you're not taking profits from this dead cat bounce, you're a dolt!"
so tired that it doesn't matter what it company earns the shorts rule the market
Totally agree with the activist demands...Kohls is so gross and ghetto haha. Every time I go in there it looks like a train wreck and all the inventory is pretty much low class junk...worse than a thrift store in my mind. Just hearing that the executive leadership has access to two private jets and full time crew absolutely BLOWS ME AWAY!
"Kohls management, if I can put a bug in your ear. I have a neat little marketing ploy for you.Locally the only casual (non-N95) masks available seem to come from grandma's sewing machine.Why don't we design and source these using our utmost procurement expedition powers. In warehouses within one week. Offer them free, with any curbside Pickup of online orders!"
why did KSS stop climbing alongside the Market climb as it was earlier? Dow went up almost 100 and KSS dropped from 63.50 down to 63.30 during that time
I think target is giving a strong signal that its time to get into retail for the yearly run into the fall. Kohl's solid Q2 results should get some money flowing in. Get the shorts to cover more (they have covered over 10M shares so far this year) and the company to continue to buy back 2.5M shares a quarter and we should all have a Merry Christmas.
"As nimble individual investors there is no reason we should leave obvious gains on the table. When Macy's stumbles it hits KSS for 11% because of ETFs. Well, I'm not running an ETF so I can, and did, buy KSS yesterday. I fully expect to get that whole 11% back fairly quickly. If not? Oh well, I'll have to live with the 5% yield."
Don’t be caught by the rumor that Amazon is going to buy calls out
"I don’t understand why KSS isn’t aloud to remain open and limit customers in the store? Walmart, Target, Costco, and many many other stores have more people coming in to the store in a couple hours then Kohl’s would all day? I think keeping everything shut down is going to do way more harm then starting to open stores up and limiting people inside?"
"I don't normally purchase retail stocks. Here we are, and I'm all in for the long term. My wife loves Kohl's and taught me to shop there. Must have a Kohl's credit card (don't always have to use) to get the incredible deals. TJ Maxx for men is hit and miss; their pants are sometimes crooked... really! I don't shop Target or Walmart, so who's left in my small town... Kohls. If I'm wrong, I'm not out a lot of cash, but I don't think I am. The parking lots are decent, the amazon returns is heaven, I have no other place to go, and it's back to school for a double $.My 21 year old thinks they have nothing for here... idk.BTW: I hope Amazon doesn't buy Kohl's, but I think you're foolish not to."
"They give you fake 25% discount coupons and when u buy something, it doesn’t work."
They added 2m customers! Maybe they are planning to get into streaming business with monthly subscription!
Does anyone think it will ever see 50 again ?
Kohl's parking lots are Knee deep over the Weekend !! stop manipulating you thieves!!
Dividend being paid today...cut or same or nil...anyone??
What a buy! Why the hell did it go down on these amazing earnings?
"manipulating funds are controlling kohls,BUY IT AFTER ELECTION, stay away from it !!!!!!"
Macys does badly and it is down 3% and Kohl's does great and it is down 8%. go figure.
"Yet again, a overreaction to a otherwise decent report. I wouldn't be surprised to see KSS up at the close."
Check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They just mentioned KSS in the daily newsletter.
"Since Kohls is in bed with Scamazon, I won't be setting foot in their stores anymore. Scamazon is cancer."
I'm guessing (hoping) that the 50DMA of 62.85 provides support. Thinking seriously about picking up some call options.
"Let’s all go to Nieman’s or Sak’s then, or order from Amazon so we can return it two or three times to get it right. Good Idea! Kohl’s is a g r e a t Place for everyday, normal job working Families!"
Only Kohl’s investors get giddy about being up a dollar plus change when the Dow is up over 50 points.
$60 looks like support on the way back downnice dividend though
Sell before too late
could it be Amazon buying Kohl's? just thinking its possible and with stock down now might be best time for them to offer.
"Just woke up, KSS is down big AGAIN?$45.'s as soon as today? Who Knew?"
looks to me a strong bottom has formed. yeah.
Imagine the shorts getting caught with their pants down. In a single day KSS could shoot up to $80/shareand the shorts will have to buy back the stock at $80. Stop orders wont work because the first sale will begin at the asking price of Amazon to buy KSS.The whole reason why shorting is very dangerous indeed.

KSS reached a 52 Week low at 52.42
David probably has 100 shares and now he dedicates his time to this chat board. Looser.
"This is a real joke. Wayfair, which never has had positive earnings and never has paid a dividend, is considered better than Kohl's by analysts, simply because Wayfair is 100% Internet-sales. Yet when you get to the meat of the matter, Kohl's has more than enough liquidity using its own current earnings to pay out a 5.6% dividend, is increasing sales and is being extremely successful with the AMAZON returns program. When you get to the meat of the matter, Kohl's is a buy."
cnbc your the worst
"Excellent comment from CEO in regard to news with working with AMAZON, "" . . . and more to come."""
"JC Penny's is not in the same class of Kohl's, Who is manipulating this stock should be taken out to the back shed."
Another nice pop this morning as analysts are upgrading. More to come I think after Q4 earnings as the tax benefit is going to be Uuge!

"I find it rather ironic that some companies are getting killed based on tariffs yet their earnings have done quite well and this despite the fact that tariffs have been in place for over a year. So will the increase from 10% to 25% really make any major impact on earnings? My guess is that with the significant currency devaluation the answer is no and as some have pointed out one can simply ship goods from China to another country to relabel them and then ship them to the US. So I wonder how the shorting is going to turn out. The price has declined a lot, they really should have been covering during this recent sell-off but from the price action it is clear they haven't. Earnings are not going to miss on the bottom line and I think with how Kohl's has addressed the shift to on-line we could actually see some top line growth above estimates. Remember, all of last year Kohl's was always significantly better than the other retailers and none of them that have reported so far put up bad reports."
My question is how does a store handle returns. I'm guessing nobody wants anything used ? or at least at a huge discount . KSS has lots of returns
"Ouch #1, ouch #2 after close, and ouch does not go away. Sorry, Covid."
Sell Short Now
Let me see $35 and I am in for another round
Has anyone been in a KOHLS I have. I have to admit it is very well ran and the store I went into was immaculate. After every sale the cleks spray and wipe down the area. Very clean.
Sold today.. but will look to get back into KSS just not sure at what price?
"stock price is over valued like target , people shopped on Amazon , I see both target and kohl empty"
"I am currently holding 3000 shares. and it's not moving too much on a good day.. they have debt, but less competition like the mudslide of Macy's and JC penny. Someone give me any advice? keep half? wait? I dont think I wanna keep it for years."
heading to Kohl's for summer clothes shopping here in texas.
Selling is way overdone.
Mrkts will close Green so will this.... they took out stoplosses this morning. Total Skam to pick up chpr shares... stay strong longs
Nice run for KohlsThink I will sweep my profits now.Retail is on a tear. So....Buy on weakness - Sell on strength
"Dare we see the formation of a head a shoulders reversal pattern? Will be interesting going into October to see if we can break above the neckline and then the 200 dma. Unfortunately without earnings growth it seems unlikely we garner more than a 12 P/E but lower earnings in 2019 will make the growth in 2020 stronger than it is, so that might bode well long term.My guess is Q3 is going to be solid and the 1% comp store increases they saw since mid June may even increase. That will make for an interesting end of the year result for the company as it likely then continues to aggressively buy back stock before Q4 earnings in early March."
Retail stocks are priced for perfect performance going forward. What happens when the stimulus ends? Look at retail sales in December if you want to see how weak they are without the aid of government money.
Boycotting amazon yet?
Activist groups buying up KSS stock in attempt to replace board of directors and speed changes at KSS. Demand for shares rising. Hold on and ride this up!
This is a buy and hold at least 3 to 4 year stock and then take some profits but keep some long term for capital appreciation and dividend income.
"the Manipulating fund is doing our buying for us ,, hehe"
All these analysts are making up numbers and price targets out of thin air. Not one of them knows what the future looks like. They were bad even when we did not have this mess with the virus.
52 week high Of $70+ on Monday !!!Yes/No ?? Any thoughts???
My wife just called me from NYC Kohls the store is a mess and they have no clothes for young boys or even jeans for me. So much for the 30% coupon they sent
Dividend date?
KSS worth only $5
Kohl's is up 12.05% to 36.08
Lol poor thing. Just yesterday CNBC had an article saying Goldman considered stocks like Kohl’s undervalued. Hope nobody jumped in based on that.
"Let's see if we get the standard pop and drop today that we usually see when the shorts want to keep it down. Right at the open they were able to hold it back from a big pop, so it looks like it may be same old same old. The short position for 5/31 is going to be very interesting I think. Can't wait for that data."
Nike and Sears fell back to new low.
Today's price action is very disappointing to say the least.
Kohl's CEO Says Shoppers Are Coming Back ... 7 spotted at Dayton store
Bought more...good opportunity
KSS just rose above $44 and rising!! See you in the 50s soon.
"AS covid ends, the stocks hit the hardest are going to rise the fastest as this storm passes."
"Retail sales may be up, but that may not be sustainable if no deal is met. A lot of this money is from the stimulus package. ￼"
Yet another knee jerk reaction. To compare KSS with JCP is a joke.
"I don’t think this is heading any lower. The market reacts to the performance of the company, not the other way around. Meaning, it’s not like consumers will see this crash in price, get worried, and stop shopping at Kohl’s and send the whole thing into an unstoppable death spiral. The company will still generate positive cash flow and if they are able to hold the dividend steady going forward, that will justify the current (or even higher) PPS. Need to avoid any further thoughts of an acquisition though until they get this thing figured out and stabilized."
"Gotta love the earnings beat, dividend raised, etc. followed by a drop following market momentum... ugh!"
lockdowns coming now that Biden is president. short short short
"Well shorts covered quite a bit over the holidays. I am somewhat surprised because you certainly didn't see that magnitude of covering in the volume, though the day after Christmas we did have a big price move. They covered about 11% of the position which is now down to 27.55M shares. Needless to say this might well be signaling that shorts are ready to toss in the towel, though I tend to believe that they did some shorting early this year. I doubt after the updates there will be much more stomach for it though. So I think we will continue to finally see the position drop and at some point a squeeze will happen as the shares available to buy for the shorts vanish."
Book Value Per Share is.... 30!
Where dem shorts at?
Green EOD
I spent about $300 in the past 2 weeks ay Kolhs... Just trying to give back and help to cause...Thanks for the 16K in gains!
KSS reached a new All Time High at 81.25
I'm sorry but why did KSS tank on spectacular earnings??
"KSS , should worth $10.00 fair price"
March 16 options are going through the roof!

"In3months all shopping would have returned to normal , and the share price with it ! Do what you must."
I liquidated more than 50% of my position as I am bearish in the short term to buy it later when true bottom forms.
"The stock market is not a weighing machine, but more accurately it is similar to a voting machine. There are no artificial price lids or boundaries on stocks because the price is always determined by greed and fear of the investors daily."
tell me one good reason Kohl's can't sell as many yoga pants as Lululemon does and at a similar price. and have a market cap at least half of lululemon's
Insanely pumped and over bought
someone has let the algorithms run wild this past week
"$47.08 just last week,should easily test that and set new 52 week low in a day or two! Retail box stores are dead money, even ""Billions"" knows it, dead money!"
Will KSS go below $45 today?
"Bon Ton stores liquidation will have a huge positive effect on holiday sales. Bon Ton was a direct competitor for the same customers. Buy on line deliver to stores roll out second half doubling available inventory for in store pickup. Pop Sugar Kohl’s exclusives. Share and now debt buyback. Long term 500 stores ready for subleasing. Comping the comp, management confident for another good comp over the 6% last year."
Kohl's-just another example of a store that tries to sell too many things.
back to 18. here we go again
"This resistance level 80 has been tested for many years 2000, 2002, 2007, 2015 but all failed to break it. But now KSS passed. From now on KSS will be sky high."
Amazon inching its way to owning Kohls. Is Amazon just a modern day conglomerate disguised as an internet tech company? I think so.
"If I was shorting this stock, I think right about now I would be getting a little nervous."
Hey everyone Gerhard thinks Kohls will hit 95 next year.....let him know what you think about that !!! Sound the alarm we have a loose lunatic...lol.
is there really anyone who actually paid 55 for this stock and held all the way down..I hope not
KSS’s earnings report should lift all ships today. Kohl’s is the best retailer and it’s at a bargain price. Should go higher as we get closer to Christmas season.
Told you so! I knew even down 3$ today we would close green or pretty close to it
Ok we weathered the storm. Should get a $57 close.
"Wow, another 850k shares shorted on this stock from 9/1-9/15. This spring is getting wound up tighter and tighter. I am really shocked at this since the stock price has gone up significantly in this timeframe and we had the Amazon news. So in a timeframe where the stock price increase $6 they still shorted like crazy, all of this while the company is buying back shares as well."
What do you think about the 5 proposed directors ?
"Stores will re-open when sanity prevails and we look at the intentional spread of ambiguous information from the WHO and the CDC who have their own financial agendas. We hear of mortality rates world wide of 3.4%, yet we have huge disparities between countries that are geographically next to each other and have similarly aged populations. We have Italy with a mortality rate over 9% and we have Germany with a rate of 0.4%, Austria has a similar experience. Israel and Czechia have rates quickly approaching that of the common flu. Also these countries aren't seeing the huge spikes in serious or critical cases either. In the case of Germany the infection rate is lower yet the mortality rate is dramatically lower. Only now is the WHO beginning large scale testing of various drugs, though the one drug combination that has proven to a high degree of certainty in France is only being tested as a stand alone trail, they are testing Chloroquine and HydroxoChloroquine but not in conjunction with the Z pack, the limited study has already proven that the two in combination drop the viral loading to zero in six days, that HydroxoChloroquine will only take it down to 50%, why waste so much time. Fortunately the French are rolling out that treatment plan full scale throughout the country, we should have definitive results by the weekend."
Don't own any shares but I like seeing this up. Retail>bank stocks in 2019...
KSS ill go bankrupt soon
Glad I covered my 2021 35 puts- this is gonna take off!
ooo Nice little after-hours bump of 0.06
Going Bankrupt Soon!!!
"JCP SHLD going BK will benefit KSS...M will continue to shed stores...TGT though is a keeper because they are upping their game both omnichannel and home delivery. I'm a little disappointed that AMZN did not commit as did ALDI, but looks like they are still evaluating...AMZN bought RING to monitor home delivery, so they are currently concentrating on e-commerce still in improving home delivery. Yet, as TGT says, you need bric and mortar to succeed in retail in a meaningful way...AMZN really don't make that much in e-commerce. AMZN will buy KSS and the ALDI partnership will nudge them sooner."
"kss solid. kss debt manageable. kss just increased dividend and recommitted to stock buyback. kss solid. they will suspend stock buyback for a while. online purchases way up people sit around and buy buy Buy. now they will have lands end and Amazon return desk. they are a good value for money shop with nationwide presence. oh and soon Amazon will buy, use as distribution points, truck storage and faster package pickup at store verses home delivery.buy for awesome dividend and wait for price to rise. 3 years from now you will be bragging about 25% annual returns while still receiving 16% div"
"60+ this week, 20% float is short. Huge lines at stores"
"So Kohl's is fine with spreading the virus, as long as you make a purchase!Macy's, Nordstrom, Lands' End close stores due to COVID-19"
Kohl's reached a 52 Week high at 50.04
"All retails PEAKED, down from here w INFLATION!!"
Sell now will be dropping very quickly soon.
Ruiz your middle name is misinformation guy I'm 100% sure of that.
Nothing unique here. No pricing power. Sell
just sell
"Knew this would happen but still didn’t act. Should have sold everything after the AMZN announcement at $75+, and waited until now to get back in. Such a waste."
This will fall below $72 in the next day or two and below $70 next week.
Why should I shop at Kohls when I can get everything cheaper delivered to my door. There sales tactics are not working..........regular price 49.99....kohls price 34.99.....Amazons price 29.99 with free delivery...HELLO.
$KSS is breaking out today with a lot of volume. Looking great.
Kohls out today with their new children's plush toy and book KOHLS Cares Campaign!
"I'm planning to nibble more at this stock at the current valuation. I dont think they will succumb to the next recession, they are very much able to pay the dividend (which they just hiked) with free cash flow currently and they are making all the moves a brick and mortar retailer is able to and must do to stay relevant in this modern day market. Their online sales are growing in low double digits with a 6th order fulfillment center recently becoming operational, they're restructuring their business model to streamline and cut costs, aggressively reinventing their product portfolio to target weakness, and setting up systems to better analyze customer response to their brands in order to seek out hidden opportunities.The amazon partnership is bringing in new and helping to retain business, even if it's not showing massive results immediately I still think it's a positive move on their end. Personally, I think that online sales will never completely destroy brick and mortar, I get most of my shoes, watches, and clothing from Kohls as well as clothing for my baby, and with the prospect of Amazon buyout I am willing to buy this stock at what I perceive to be a discounted value.their p/b value is below 1, their p/e ratio is also tiny between 7 and 8 and their dividend payout is huge without the payout ratio being unsustainable.each to their own and good luck to all!"
23 by end of next week. 40 by thanksgiving. Schools starting to phase in kids in-person learning. That means lots of back to school shopping.
KSS hit $51 today. Expect to close above $50 soon. Then the run at $60 will start.
"$18-$24 range broken, indicates $30 target."
"Make no mistake, I am definitely long KSS. However, as a longtime shareholder, I know how these earnings announcements go. No matter what happens tomorrow, positive or negative, the price will get hammered. Happens every time."
"is it just me or does anyone else get super annoyed that at the last closing minutes, this stock always goes more down than up! lol...I mean its still green, up is up, but ALWAYS in the last minutes, comes down some."
I just went to Kohls on my lunch break. I cant believe how many people were there returning Amazon items. This is going to drive so much foot traffic over the holidays. I'm excited to see how much it will affect sales.
$KSS stores are not a bad place to find some action.
Dividend MUST be eliminated immediately to show investors they are serious about retaining precious capital. Stock will begin to rebound once they announce. Should be coming any day.
I bought more today. Next stop $24
Comps when even year over year will never be positive. The activists describing this as the best of the worst are spot on. Way overpriced.
Kohl's is up 12.44% to 24.22
Ex date approaching
"This is a longterm investment with a good dividend. Jim Cramer has be apologizing to his club members for buying stocks he recommended. He had a cone on his head couple of weeks ago for them buying Comcast. Don’t forget about about Bp, lulu and Ge. Always saying he feels sorry about members buying wrong stocks. He likes this company now hate it just like Coke. I canceled his membership and I’m doing more better with out him. His shows good to see what’s happening day to day but don’t trade with him. Do your own DD and it will payoff. This is a great company and I’m glad he sold."
"Hey RUIZ get ready for 22.00 this week you will be stunned and talking to yourself in disbelief so predictable, its funny."
Why is kohls discounting it's name brands today 70%? Heard it from a good source.
"MichealLulz, so KSS is above $29, are you going to short it?"
"Russia has officially certified the first coronavirus vaccine in the world ready for use by the general public.Putin, also announced his daughter was given two doses of the vaccine and she is now immune to the virusand has now antibodies protecting her.Finally, the world has a proven and highly effective virus that will prevent everyone from contracting the coronavirus!Soon the FDA will approve a USA vaccine too, per the company it will receive approval in September to early October. Already it has been mass produced prior to approval so as soon as the FDA approves it there willbe millions of doses available to give to the USA public.As Trump said, this coronavirus crisis is almost over. Life will soon return to normal far faster than the medical experts think.Maybe Trump can persuade Putin to make available the Russian vaccine in the USA."
Still holding half and I will add again when we find true bottom. From 29 to 19 is quite a drop to me.
if all their stores got looted it would be ok because insurance would cover it all
Up premarket over a dollar! Back to the 50s and then a run for the 60s next! Fasten all seat belts!
"As of the end of May they covered about 3.4M shares so we are down to 28M. I thought they might has shorted more but the fact that they are covering is good news. It likely means the $45 is going to hold. On the negative side, we saw a lot of selling, which means a lot of investors dropped out of this stock and likely have lost confidence in the management team. They really needed to manage this better and getting distracted with AtHome was silly. Hopefully they have learned their lesson as it seems they are shuttering some new concept stores for under performance.If Goss is smart, she will simply manage this company into a wonderful suicide squeeze that should see her make lots of money on her options and guide the company through this readjustment of retail. Let's see what Q2 looks like, later this week we can at least see if the April decline in retail sales was likely due to the media scaring away consumers with tariff and tax refund hysteria. That would be my guess, employment is still robust and we had the biggest hiring month in history last month."
AWFUL first quarter and 2nd quarter will obviously be much much worse.How is this in any way a buy until next year maybe !Up today is beyond comprehension. Then again bad news means greatnews for the stock market. Buy Buy Buy
"For the Cramer sheep who listen to him a couple days ago, you got sheared again."
"Given the price action on DDS and Macy's today I think that the sector wide shorts are covering. However Kohl's doesn't look quite like it yet, though maybe some at the end of the day, likely due to the sector. We will get the update on around June 10th and then we will know how much of the damage has been shorting and how much has been investors losing faith in the Kohl's story."
This Pig is going back to $43.... you don't lose a 1/4 of your Revenue and expect to be a $70. stock!
"I’m waiting for our Prez to announce that tariffs will not take effect so Chinese can have a wonderful Christmas, because he cares"
"Just imagine if the market was flat or down today, it be lucky to hold 35."

I have a few relatives and friends that work at Kohl's all over the country and all of them say they have never seen Kohl's as busy as it has been the past few weeks. There is lots of pent up demand for deals out there and that Kohl's cash is burning a hole in their pockets. This stock will be easily be over $30 a month from now.
"KSS misses earnings, downgraded, price target lowered to $40 and yet it surges, go figure"
we will be king of the hill with a accelerated economy! we will triple our last highs! triple!
no disrepect to cats. ..but will there be a dead cat bounce ?
Wow... Not sure how a mall based company missing earnings by a few pennies has anything to do with Kohls that increased it's foot traffic by 25% with its amazon partnership and is not mall based?
Wait to buy at $29 and you will be glad you did...market needs 3 day puke decline to stop here...KSS will puke also
It will crash Big tomorrow

"Easily a $40 to $50/share stock once this covid nonsense is done and gone.Several companies have vaccines in phase 3 which are expected to receive emergency approvalby the FDA by as early as September.The vaccines have already been tested on thousands and proven highly effective at creating antibodies and Tcell in the study. Millions of Americans can receive this vaccine in September to October totally ending this covid nonsense.By the way, I Covid is a harmless mild flu that is so mild, most Americans have no symptoms at all.Most who die and have greatest harm are those of extreme feebleness such as at old folks homes where they are so feeble they need assistance to live and even do daily things all of us do for ourselves.They would have died anyways from one thing or another.Case in point... Jack Nickolaus and his wife both in their 80s had Covid and his wife had no symptoms at all and he only had a mild cold and sore throat for a few days. Wow!! Scary! If an 80 year old couple like them could weather it so easily what about the younger much healthier Americans? The answer is this covid is no threat to most Americans and it being highly contagious is of no concern either.When the vaccine comes out, I will refuse to get it and won't allow any of my family to take it either!Why? Because Covid is no threat to healthy American families like us.Only those with AIDS or serious health problems need be isolated and protected.While the rest of us should stop this fear mongering and go about life!KSS and Macys and other brick and mortar stores annually have a 75% market share of clothing sales and that will continue forever and forever.Online sales in clothing CAN NEVER RISE ABOVE 25%People refuse to buy online. Just like some people refuse to travel on airplanes and some hate computers.You cannot change them.When ever a new technology comes in they always say it is going to make something obsolete but what typically happens is a place exists for both the old and new."
"So here's a question for people whose view of the world goes beyond ""next quarter"":Where /are/ people buying clothes today? Certainly, some people go on-line, but I still think that a lot of people like to try on clothes before buying (yes, I realize that Amazon has an ""answer"" for that, but I don't think it's very popular and I continue to believe it's non-optimal). I think that Kohls is better in a better position to continue to capture the market for people who actually like to buy their clothes at a store."
Congress is planning to extend unemployment benefits and eliminate withholding taxes.Well that means a huge amount of money will be spent and go into the economy by the consumer coming the later part of this year.I see a vaccine in Sept to October bringing life back to normal in the USA just in time for an awesome Holiday retail season.I see a record sales season at KSS this year. Remember last year was the shortest holiday season after Thanksgiving possible yet KSS beat on sales and earnings last year.I see them beating records this year.
KSS on its way to $24/share. Bye bye shorts!

"I was at a kohls yesterday. During the panemic they constantly cleaned the carts. They actually looked nice. The cart I got last night had something brown spilled all over it. Ive seen homeless peoples carts look nicer. And people are paying $60/share to own stock in this company, that cant afford to clean their carts? insane"
"J.C. Penney said Thursday that it will start closing 154 of its stores next week in what it is calling the first phase of its efforts to shrink its footprint. The Plano, Texas-based retailer said it could take about 10 to 16 weeks to complete the closures. A list of the stores closing was published on Penney’s website.Consolidation of sales, not many nice clothing stores left. Not everyone likes to root around at TJ Maxx. We have a TJM, never been there."
Just look at Amazons stock for an answer!
"kss donated $1million , that means kss money more than enough,so buy kss make money no any problems,kss July quarter earnings report very good,kss made$0.3 per share,that's incredible,"
Thank you Kohls. I have been shopping at Kohls for last 15 years and today is the first time I made money.
Kohl's reached a 52 Week low at 29.71
KSS is a 3 bagger and longer term a 5 bagger
Someone must really believe people are flocking back to this retail stores to buy the clothes hanging on the rack since March.
"I think this morning will be the last of the sympathy selloffs. The info from Macy's JCP and Nordstroms clearly shows that earnings and revenue should be beats for Kohl's as I think Kohl's always does better than them. JCP poor performance is especially good news as I think that customer base is one Kohl's really can co-opt. We will have fun into earnings, if we beat and guide up, likely here, the stock will rally. Then we have the Black Friday weekend news which should also be a positive for retail. The only question then is what took us down, new shorting or long term holders losing face. I think it was all shorting driven, which means at some point we will recover that as the negative pricing pressure stops when they stop shorting and of course positive pricing pressure happens when/if they ever cover. Interestingly the stock has more than doubled from its lows last year yet we still have a short position around 30M shares, you gotta wonder how these guys justify taking lumps like that."
KSS reached a 52 Week low at 55.27
KSS is up 7.93% to 58.67
Sell before too late...we are heading to $5
Dead Money! Retail Box Stores Dead Money! Another JCP and Sears coming to a town near you!
"As tempting & cheap as $kss stock looks I'm not optimistic that shareholders will be saved from this one. I don't think Kohl's will be able to reopen without help. Potentially there could be some kind of bailout of the company offered for example Amazon assuming the debt at some discount and a promise of keeping the employees.There is resistance to any shareholder bailouts right now from no matter who. I used to be bullish on this stock but the business was turning down even before the virus. I'm not shorting it, I don't short but I just felt knowing what I know following this company for many years through the ups and downs I should warn people on this board that I have chatted with before that this time is not the same."
Sell Before it crashes to $30
Buh Bye Kohl's!
Amazon does not have any retail centers. I predict that if Amazon wants to enter the retail space they’re going to do it with Kohls. A great partnership that could potentially be great for KSS shareholder.
"let me tell u . This KSS stock is manipulated by big institutions. Yesterday was the last date to get KSS diviend yield. Share were down. But today, shares are up. You cannot predict this KSS stock. So much manipulation by big hands. When KSS posted huge earnings, share were down 4%. Next day it went up 4%. Crazy stock. This stock will lose all your money. Macy is better buy with diviend 5%. Today is last chance to get macy diviend yield"
MichaelRlutz posts are fake news. Constantly posting negative comments that have no basis in reality.
"Just throwing it out there- Kohl’s does one of the BEST Black Friday sales. Now that I’m back in the green, excited to ride this thing through the holiday season"
45 close ?
in 1 year this company with out the dividend will skyrocket with growth! I'm thinking $80 ++ then the dividend will knock it back to$60++ ! so like when would be a good time to beat the other investors this time  next quarter  end of year  I'll take mine now 
"I'm not gonna buy the hype anymore in the short term. I think its wrong to not allow true price discovery by having all these fake positive reviewers post everyday as the stock slides lower and lower and to be honest, If it wasn't for being HTB, we'd have found fair price when we had a slide the other day.... Insead Now we slower march lower."
"why still dropping today? Any guesses from anyone on how low this may get before it turns around? I bought a little more yesterday at $70.70, thinking i did ok at the time :) I know it's not too bad, but just wish I could get a little better at guessing low points"
Posts getting deleted to much positive .

where's this thing going this morning?
"$3 stock soon, sell short"
I would hate to be short tomorrow. Could open over $20

"KSS is a solid investment. Macy's is $5 dollars because its a higher risk, that company was been in trouble since before the virus hit. KSS has been doing very good in a tough sector."
Kohls starting curbside pickup for online order in WI stores.
"The Kohls near our house has been busier than before the pandemic ever since they re-opened last month. The parking lot is busy during the week, and packed on the weekend. Stores busier than before, increased online sales, improved inventory. Once KSS makes it through Q2 reporting and finishes inventory write-offs, they will be on the way to a huge holiday season this year for Q4. Safer non-mall locations, BoA got it right; the technicals will take care of themselves as a government mandated shutdown is not typical. Small position here, but very long (fall 2021 minimum or longer to hold)."
Will Kohl's see 50 this week?
You shorts are in big trouble.
"I buy alot everything on Amazon. But needed some well fitting, soft fabric, no wrinkle black and grey mens shirts. Bought one of each at Kohls. Tried them out. Then went back bought 3 more of each, on sale online. Gathered them up by going to more than one store. They made it easy to use some Kohls cash online. I really like the Marc Anthony clothes. I fell like a get great prices on excellent quality."
Kohls is undervalued compared to the rest of the retail sector.
Kss to declare first restored dividend in days!
Just a horrible stock to hold on to.
Up again after a big move. Says it all. 50s here we come!
I took my first position in KSS today at $43.70. I like the improvements they are making and best of all there not in the mall lol
time to enter boys
Expect the CEO to guide upwardly sales and earnings!
oh man...was hoping we were on our way to 52 today!
"Another nice article today showing the S&P companies with the strongest projected earnings growth compared to estimates of 12/31/17. Kohl's is pretty much the top of that list if you exclude the oil industry (in a major recovery) and CF industries (agriculture so also in a major commodity recovery). Macy's is right behind. Kohl's is projected to have 4% revenue growth which should translate to 6+% earnings growth, throw in the 4% from the stock buyback and you get a 10+% earnings growth rate that likely is sustainable, so a P/E of x1.5+ is warranted. Add in the huge short position and we likely get there before the end of this year and that with a better idea of actual 2018 earnings, so I see a 15+ P/E times 2018 earnings here as a realistic price target."
Every Kohl’s I go to is always crowded. Their discounting ploy works.
Back to the Future!! Next stop the 50s then 60s and beyond!!
I visited a Kohl’s store yesterday. It looked like they were going out of business. Stock was depleted. Where is the online sales? With the Amazon return center looking like a stolen lemonade stand makes me wonder if there was an adult in charge! I hope someone can turn this around soon.
tgt is up and kohls is down. it looks like kss is being hated
no disrespect to my cat...but...this could be a bounce
Insane value
Lol I bought this in May at $12....flippin $12!!!!!
This thing was $75 3 weeks ago!
Good up day with solid volume! GLTA Longs!
New Lows almost daily is all you need to know! ... and wait until they miss earnings AGAIN! Yikes!
"Hurray for the USA! Down with tyrants, injustice and restoration of freedom for all! Down with King Trump who says he is above the law. The US Supreme courts ruled he is NOT.Polls indicate America is wide awake and will send this tyrant message and to his corrupt US Senate supports a message they wont forget.Watch for a massive defeat of trump and his corrupt senate supporters in NOv.Retailers and the world economy will cheer this defeat."
"As usual, Macy's news takes kohl's down. Time to buy more."
"We will drop 50% more this week, rest next"
When is Kohl's going to start paying a dividend?
kss running up to hard into earnings report. don't be a bagholder.

Who is selling today?? IT #$%$ stupid. either you sold yesterday or you hold today.. I can not imaging people were watching this yesterday and decided to sell today!!
I HEARD A RUMOR THAT KOHL'S WILL BEAT THE ESTIMATES BY FAR! GET READY TO RUMBLE!
"Well the headline numbers were a stinker and when you see that they massively delayed payments to vendors the cash burn was very ugly as well. They have $2B in the bank and can borrow another $500M so I think they will be in the game this year for sure. The real question will be what does the business look like down the road. On-line is growing and is now a quarter of their sales. If they can restart their stores that will lower their costs some with regards to shipping, so there is hope there as well. Where there is a fly in the ointment is that the reopening is going very slowly and it doesn't look like they will do more than 25% of normal store revenue this month. If they can get that up to 50% by July they will be lucky because a lot of stores will have to stay closed through June I think. So Q2 numbers are going to come down quite a bit after the Q1 major miss. The question then becomes how much cash do they start burning. Q4 is not going to save them this year because people are not going to pile into stores for black Friday sales.So I think they make it into next year and with a vaccine next year could get them back to maybe within 10% in terms of revenue with likely a third of their business coming from on-line. Then the question is how much cash can they generate and return to shareholders in 2022."
RL and LVMH are real retailers. They have pricing power. Kohl’s has nothing
This just ppl coming in for the divy? will it hold tomorrow if the markets are stable?
just cancelled my card- so unAmerican to attempt to destroy another business because of your difference of opinion. Shame on you!
Is it with more than pre-COVID price - I doubt it.
"This stock is SO under the radar of wall street and I love it. CNBC constantly talks about every retailer EXCEPT Kohl's. They would rather talk about TJ Maxx, a root-and-grab yardsale of new items. Meanwhile Kohl's drifts higher in leaps and bounds!"
Are they still paying dividend?
People still shop here?
KSS is the leading and biggest retailer in the USA by store count. Well managed and at an incredible bargain price right now. Shop there often - unbeatable prices and quality and style!
"oil prices fell 6%. So, retail will go up. People will drive cars to retail centers to buy items."
Retail is all up today and down tomorrowStock market really shows the value of things by...Well by nothing ?When they report 2nd quarter will be very bad.So think if you have shares. Great time to sell on newupside day.
This will be Target in 2 years. Gonna buy any dips and hold on. The Kohl's store near me is busy all the time. I think nothing but very bright future.
"So, already dropped from 76 to 62 within the last few weeks to probably price in some disappointment. Now massive drop below 60 this morning. Have to think that a combination of shorts covering and buyers coming in over the next couple weeks to capture the (unreduced) dividend in June (now yielding 4.7% after PPS drop), will create some upward movement on the stock."
Trump ordered addtional 200 billions tariff to chinese goods. China said they will retaliate.... Full version of trade war
"Has anyone heard any plans on when kohls will open their stores in SC, Georgia, Tennessee and Florida?"
can a chart reading expert help me decipher the W pattern formed in last few days....???? thank you
My Hero
"Kohl’s investment update1. The store in blank is open and there are cars there.Seems like PE, ROE, cash flow, debt, earnings and other normal metrics aren’t important to Kohl’s investors. They will base their investments on Buick’s in the parking lot and Amazon rumors. Seems legit, let’s see how it works out."
Please check this out. http://www.theoryofstocks.com/US/Home/search-stock?q=KSS&Search=.
"Down market this morning, so hopefully we get our opening pop and then the market at some point recovers and rallies and we get a strong couple of days under out belt. Overall a pretty massive beat except for same store sales guidance. The dividend is upped to 61 cents and they will be buying back $300-$400M of stock, which will help the price move up this year I think as shorts cover."
"Another Day, Another New Low! $46.18!JC Penney, Sears, Kmart, Shopko, etc,etc.!GETTING UGLY FAST!"
What happened to the poor character that always bashed this company ?
Kohl’s- Best value stock!! Time to back up the truck.
If activists want to take over the board of directors they will have to buy up huge quantities of KSS stock as of now they don't have enough shares - only 19 percent!
Anyone on the call please provide update all I see is red
EVERY POP gets sold. Don't be f00led by their fake rallies. Today is a selling opportunity. No One should buy.
kOHLS IS A TRAITOR. tHEY SOLD OUT TO THE ENEMY
"Supports to watch on the 10 day 30 min 22.67,22.45,21.83,20.47(bottom band)"
"Way Way Overbought for some time now! Has no business being over $42. 10 Year is dragging down all dividend stocks but this, something had to give, It's a buy again around $36."
$36 buy point? - do you think this might be worth getting back in at $36 - or should we wait for $32?
Sold this turkey at 40.5 this morning at market opening. Bye Bye
"Walmart tries to stop the bleeding in Amazon battle!Multiple sources claim Walmart’s efforts to challenge Amazon are falling short, leading to internal strains and a push to curb losses! If Walmart is struggling, you are dillussional if you think Kohl's will survive!"
"Kohls, Bed Bath Beyond, Wayfair should go ask P0S rioters, looters, & Pr1ck l0sers that want to burn down buildings to shop at their stores!!!! #$%$ING Dumb #$%$"
Late Easter coupled with inclement weather last quarter made it tough. Retail customers' have fickle aspirations. Never easy to guess what items are going to be hot sellers. Based on balance sheet $55.00 per/share is very fair with included dividend. Tariffs are not going to make it easy for apparel retailers.
"Just read through the earnings call transcript. It looks like they are reducing the pace of the buyback as they only bought back 1M shares last quarter. One reason for this may be that they have increased marketing, especially in areas where competitors are closing stores in order to acquire their customer base. This seems to be paying off. So we will have to keep an eye on that level of buyback. Their average share went from 166M to 168M at the end of the Q, so I assume they gave out a bunch of stock options to executives, especially with the new CEO announcement."
"Wow! $45.93!!Even long bag holders are jumping the retail big box store ship!Can't say you weren't warned ahead of time! JC Penney, Sears, KMart, Shopko, etc,etc!"
Many good retailers (whom have been crushed) are beginning to move up because of stock rotation and there is great value in these stocks. Another good day . . . .
#KSS has been showing support at 68.94 and resistance at 76.81. Buy rating: 6 at 9trading.
"The investor group said ""poor retail execution"" by Kohl's has led to stagnant sales and declining margins, while the ""long-tenured board with insufficient retail experience"" lack any material ownership in the company and is an ""impediment"" to serving shareholders. The group said that it's board nominations could help generate more than $10 in earnings per share per year."
LOW OF DAY COMING INTO THE CLOSE! MAX PAIN!
If you are long and have cash to buy you should be happy. KSS dividend and peripherals alone make it an extreme value here. Bad industry to be in right now.
"New Price Target $7.65 after Target considers buying Kohl's locations... if not, same as Macy's around $5. Share"
Can’t believe this outdated business moving forward is trading more than 20
48-52 I buy
"Ticker is CORRUPT, only a Fool buys here,wait till 33,must go back,Sell like Crazy here!!!!!!!"
KSS will STILL go back over 20+ again SOON with or with RUIZ (the short) comments.
"If you purchased kss for dividend income, just ride this out"
The run for 60s and beyond has begun!
"Best explanation for today that I heard was that maybe investors were disappointed that management didn't have much new to say about the Amazon partnership.Still seems like a pretty weak justification for today's ""spanking"". $60 would be below fair market value even if there were no Amazon partnership at all."
Nice setup for a buy opportunity after the holidays. Retailers should have a very nice Q4 this year
KSS is down 12.06% to 55.32
more than Double the Volume in less than 1/2 hour. WOW. what a beat down. This SUX
Back to school in full swing.My Kohls was also packed.
Amazon allowing returns at kohl is huge. They give you a coupon for shopping when amazon returns made
Kohls suspends dividend Just when i was thinking of getting in ! sad face
AMZN hitting 52 week high. Plenty of cash too. Perfect time to use the cash or their high-priced stock as currency to acquire KSS.
"Talk of a retail apocalipse has died down, people will always go out to socialize and shop for cloths. Should new ceo manage to prove herself as a smart merchandiser, next year jcp will look much better. Remember that in the mobile age, trends spread fast and shorts will have to cover."
"Jerry this is going right back down to $21, too many downgrades @ $19"
"This is a bargain, great divi, ignore Wall Street."
Kohl's reached a 52 Week low at 24.75
Kohl’s was one of my favorite stores. WAS. Since many clothes made of cotton were replaced with those made of polyester my foot appears there only twice a year. Previously about twice a week.
New innovation and partnerships should propel this company to over $90/share.
"Let's guess when Kohls will declare bankruptcy. I think they're probably ok for a few months, but with their competitors using bankruptcy to shed debt it would only make sense for Kohls to do the same. I predict bankruptcy by end of year."
"Covered with 1000 shares, waiting for stimulus coming down from White House. No doubt KSS/KR/ACI/M/Target .... will be benefit from it. No brainer."
"While Kohl's being down after earnings is nothing new, the high volume today I think signals a bit of shorting has been going on today. Not sure how long they will short because Kohl's had a very good report and earnings are set to improve, not get worse. Listening to their CC you see that margins were heavily impacted by their growing on-line business, you know the ""future"". So clearly Kohl's is hear to stay and it is a matter of time before they return to earnings growth. I think once that new fullfillment center is up they will post better numbers, especially if they then start to streamline their online ordering. Roughly 40% of online orders get picked up at a store by the way, so clearly Kohl's is onto something."
Filling the upside gap.
Black Friday at 25% capacity!!! How many people are going to wait in line OUTSIDE the store IN THE COLD!You can scratch this quarter off. BOOK IT.
"So clearly the action on Tuesday was shorting, the question now is did they take it down and expand their position, or due to the massive volume, did they take it down and cover big time. We will find out on 6/11."
A coup of the board of directors sounds like turmoil and something to be sold into not bought. What a stupid reason to be up 9%.
I'm not trying to be a hater because I used to like shopping at Kohls back in the day. You walk in and EVERYTHING is on sale. Kind of made you feel like you are shopping at a discount. The rest is history doesn't take a rocket scientist to see a hard shift happening in retail. We all saw this coming a long time ago well before Amazon hit $500 per share.
What happened after hours it tanked
Think we may be in the low 30s before the middle of August !
I will no longer shop at Kohls since they have become political by canceling My Pillow sales.
Looks like retail is breaking out form a reverse head a shoulders. Dillard's is really moving up lately as well meaning the shorts are likely starting to run for the hills. Short covering is likely also what underlies the current rally in Kohl's.
Take this for what it’s worth. I have heard amazon is in discussions with a major US retailer.
SHORT THIS KSS DOWN TO WHERE IT BELONGS!!
Houston! Do we have lift off or not?
This is a stupid sell-off and will recover big time !!
"GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY,, DON'T MISS IT."
Sure glad I bought my July 17th calls back yesterday .
Best decision I ever made selling this pig at $51.26 for a small profit! I would've been down $4. by Monday! Holy #$%$! Phew!!
Anyone know what drove this down?
Nice Short Squeeze Today Sell on strength buy on weakness
They reported 2.3 billion in profit last quarter. There book value is 35 per share. This has got a long way to go before bk. They only have a debt ratio of 1.34 come on have some sense
"As you will remember KSS went up in early June to about $30 from $10 in March. The rally was stalled due to the huge increases in covid in large states like CA, TX and FL because the fear was that the governments would close down the economy again and force retailers to close.Fact is the government has decided, even in CA, that to close the economy would do more harm than good, and they are right too. Facing huge budget short falls, high unemployment and voter dissatisfaction and revolt the government cannot and will not close down the economy or nonessential retailers ever again.So, the fear was undue.That storm has passed, and covid has run through its natural course infecting a peak, giving the population immunity and now we see everywhere covid is declining in new daily active cases and deaths are declining.I would say, the USA is following the pattern of Sweden in that we saw in their county cases rose slightly, then declined then spiked hugely to record then leveled off and rapidly declined to now it is almost completely gone in Sweden with deaths about zero and new cases essentially zero daily. The Swedish even are not required to social distance anymore.They never closed their economy and now they have widespread immunity so covid is over in Sweden.Likewise, the natural course will eventually be the end of covid as more people get immunity. That is why cases are declining. So many have immunity and it is very widespread in the USA. Most don't even know they had it and have immunity now.In any case the worse is over, the economy will now recover, and covid is distant memory.We dont evn need a vaccine.However, vaccines are now going to be available and widely distributed very soon in a month or two.Russia is already planning to innoculate its whole population in October with a vaccine they have now.Expect life back to normal soon and KSS will be back to high profits, paying down the debt annually, restoring the dividend and will rise back up to $60/share soon. And of course, KSS will soon resume their share buyback program making share holders richer with dividends and reduced dilution of shares.As Buffet says, one just has to be patient to succeed."
Tariffs are not going away anytime soon. Invest cautiously
KSS is no were near bankruptcy. The more bankruptcies that file the STRONGER KSS as they will pick up market share. This is obvious to SOME people.
Ignore the fluctuations the trend is way higher!
"Judging by the early price action today I think we are seeing some sector wide shorting here. It will be interesting to see what the short position for 2/28 was compared to 3/15, which should show any increased short activity."
The chart is showing a head and shoulders formation. Sell off coming. Now is a good time to sell before everyone else does
"Originally bought this at 43 thinking it was a great price,Then I bought again at 38 and was excited for more at cheaper priceThen I bought a 3rd time at 31 and felt like I was lucky to have the opportunity Now at 24 I really just don’t care, my only concern is dividend staying , it’s approaching Macy’s level of unsustainable"
will the BonTon bankruptcy help KSS stock at all today? or still be remembered when the market stops dropping?
Olson twins-are designers? and i am a stock guru....lol
KSS is down 5.05% to $69.52
I can't wait to go shopping
"This run up has been total manipulation,watch out when the bottom really falls out,low $20.'s before the likes of Sears and JC Penney's!"
Earnings beat coupled with a $2 dividend = $50+ price target IMO.
"Winner winner Chicken Dinner! I said $20 by next Holiday season, this excessive move is premature but overall expected. But hey you can all buy it now at $17 bucks too sell it next year at $10, so in essence you are all saving money by limiting next years losses...nice!"
Keep adding to positions at this level- We are close to bottoming out. Fair value including “China effect” is $75.
I initiated my first long position in kss in March when I saw the completely insane drop of this stock.The stock is mine now and i am a long term holder. Precovid this stock was cheap when it sold for $60/share. The current prices are insane still and i expect it to rise easily back to $60/share and beyond.I will still a stock holder in a few years when the dividend is restored and plan to keep it as a long term position in my highly diversified porfolio.Day traders a few pennies here or there but will miss out on the huge moves.Easily I will get six times my principle back. 700 percent return expected over next couple years
Kohls sells Chinese junk. Stock is doomed!
Past performance is no guarantee of future performance.This stock is not trapped in a time loop. Reasons for its low prices and sales and earnings short term are disappearing.
Back to $30
"Never learn my lesson. Actually thought the market might act rationally this time around. I guess I'll be selling before earnings every time on this one, an buy back later once the PPS has been beaten down."
Its the whole market people.. calm down.. great buying opportunity.
"LOL, you're nuts. It's a failing company in a failing business model. Retail stores are dead. The future is online and Kohl's doesn't have a clue. Bankrupt in 3 months."
"KSS right now would be selling for at a minimum of $80/share if no trade tariff war and no covid pandemic had occurred.The new Pfizer covid vaccine which completed final testing has been shown to be an amazing MORE Than90 percent effective. That compares to flu vaccines that are only 40-60 percent effective.This new vaccine can completely eradicate covid from the world in a very short time - 6 months.Pfizer plans to have a billion doses available by next year. Thats enough for all the United States and many other countries to completely immunize the whole population.The United States will be back to normal in months. Markets have a tendency of reacting to extremes. KSS has been beaten up to the extreme. It is now ridiculously under priced. The business is sound. Likewise, the tech stocks and stocks like Walmart, Target etc post covid are way overpriced. Amazon earnings and sales are going to plunge downward post covid.This is why Bezos just sold $3 billion of his stock in Amazon."
People finally coming to their senses on this one.
"So I read an article last March that according to the New York Times, ""the e-tailer is looking to dramatically expand its current flirtations with physical stores. The newspaper's sources say that Amazon is considering setting up stores where consumers could use augmented or virtual reality to see how furniture and home appliance might look in their homes. Well, 3 months later news broke out in June that Amazon is buying Whole Foods and at the deal closed at the end of August. Well, things are really looking good for KSS as THE retail store that can accommodate all of Amazon's needs as respect high technology shopping as in augmented or virtual reality for the Home like furnitures, home appliances, And for the person, augmented or virtually reality to see how a dress, cosmetics, shoes, etc. etc. look on a person. Alibaba is already doing this. So it is no brainer that KSS with over 1100 off mall location provide these need perfectly. Throw in other amazon needs as EZ return or in-store pick up, the stores proving as a closer fulfillment center for lower delivery cost, housing their own version of geek squad as well as repair capabilities. Then for future use of drone operations...well it is just a matter of time...I say by summer at the latest...$90 bucks is my guess."
"Kohl's 30 % off Nov. 7th thru 11th for veterans, Awesome. I'm not a big shopper but I need some stuff."
"KSS....+.....AABB ...= YOUR GAIN$ TRIPLING in 2021........................................ "" newschain asia broadband ""@^@)"
"Keep selling please, would love to load the  on this already oversold retailer!"
kohl's bottom is not far from here. UBS a little late . AMZN and kohl's was mentioned with the same breath.kohl's is cheaper to buy and maintain as opposed to macys.
"JC Penney, Sears, Kmart, Shopko!The writings been on the wall for some time now folks!"
SELL SELL SELL THIS LOSER!!!!!
By the time pfizer and moderna has their vaccine approved most of the world wont need it because they willl already have immunity to covid via Russia's vaccine.
"Today's coronavirus daily cases have dropped to 55,000 total in usa! Very bullish! Excellent highly effective vaccines! Soon covid will be extinct! And a distant memory!Great year for the winners of this !"
online orders increasing! without the overhead! kss is still making $$!money!
This is a buying opportunity. They are the best positioned retailer for the changing landscape. They still have a huge buyback approved and at these levels they should be buying. KSS is worth $48-52
"After hours news leaked of a new cure for Coronavirus given only to the sickest causing them to recover very quickly and has proven highly effective.They are releasing free of charge 1.5 million doses or enough to treat 140,000 of the sickest Coronavirus patients.Death rates will drop to nearly zero as a result.Gilead is planning to ramp up production and have enough to treat 500,000 Americans by October and 1 million by end of the year. Other companies should have a vaccine ready by next spring.In the meantime this highly effective drug from Gilead that has proven to dramatically drop the fatalities is enough to allow governors to reopen all businesses almost immediately.This is why KSS is up by $2 after hours.KSS and the other retailers like Macys will all rise by several hundred percent as a result. of the news."
Target is killing KSS.
last March 2018 I bought this stock for $64.50 and held it one month and broke even. Today I bought the stock for almost $10 less a share. I hope I made the right choice to add again to my portfolio
KSS reached a new 52 Week High at 59.74
"4mvp tomorrow after the close we get the short position update from the end of September, given the price action so far this month their likely was some more shorting, so we can get a reasonable idea how big of a nut they still have to try to pass through their kidney's. Reality is late last year there were over 200M shares of Kohl's stock, this year it is already well below 190M. That means the noose for the shorts is getting tighter and if the price stays low, all that means is Kohl's itself buys back more shares with their buyback."
Long term play now
The stock is now oversold. Buy now and add if it falls under 46
Did Kohl’s state they were reintroducing a dividend?
you all think the hulk is strong! wait until kohl's comes back up to play king of the hill!
Alex we all know where this is going ........up..........more up.....and yes even more up....just needs time
"Stay short-shorties if you got guts,it'll be at 18 tomorrow, no worries! SELL MORE ,,SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL !!"
6 billion in debt....not good...the next 6 months will be very hard for KSS
"During the pandemic a lot of people sheltered in Kohls stores because they were so empty they could easily socially distance. Now that the pandemic is over and you can actually interact with humans again I see the stores emptying out. Kohls stores = good places to shelter, not a good place to hang out."
"It looks like the analysts have now all updated their 2018 earnings and we are at a healthy $5.26 putting us at a 12 P/E which is a healthy discount to the market. 2019 earnings have not all been updated and so far do not show very strong earnings growth, this despite the likely stock buybacks. Indeed, all they likely show is the effect of the stock buy back. Clearly the price action post earnings has been disappointing, it likely is sector related more than Kohl's but there were some negatives in the CC. For one the Q1 guidance, but another factor was the fact that they have not increased their distribution of capital to shareholders at all, despite the tax cut. The increase in the dividend is made up by the share buybacks and the size of the share buybacks are the same as 2017 when they really slowed down in the second half of the year. All that likely is helping depress the stock, which with yesterdays move is starting to look like it might even roll over."
70 plus already. Shorts are screaming..71 is close. Likely 72.00 today.
Bought some today
Going to $30?
I just bought in at the close today. I have a sneaking suspicion that the relationship with Amazon is going to go far beyond in store returns of online orders. I would not be at all surprised if Amazon puts in a bid to buys Kohl’s in the near future.
"Wouldn't touch retail with a ten foot pole!Holiday estimates are already predicted to be terrible! China's Tarfiffs haven't even kicked in yet fully, just wait and see!"
"Wow, I waited two years to get in at $36. I warned at $70 that it would drop but even worse than my worst expectations. Not bragging as I have large losses in my other stocks as well."
Retail stocks are due for a breather after the most current run up.
KSS will bounce back to $22 range or better this fall. No.doubt as it is now the only game in town for the middle class.
"I'll be the first to ask: Is Kohls the next JC Penney? A lot of debt, no one shops there, constantly rebrands itself. Is constantly in a ""turnaround""."
When do they report earnings?
"Isnt goin up because has run alot recently, next week will go up"
"Macy's #$%$ on the parade, even Target is down huge and Kohl's went from down 5% to down 10%. So I think this is the shorts reshorting on the retailers demise theory that was disproven I think. We will be down, the question then is do the shorts cover and bring it back up and how many sellers are there left in this stock? Kohl's will be buying through the end of the month, though they didn't mention anything about an increased buyback, just buying back more debt so they have an easier time making their earnings numbers next year."
"I see plenty of people at Target, Home Depot, etc. People are getting braver and are done with being shut in and out of life. People will be waiting in line to get into Kohl's. Kids need new clothes and shoes even if it's to wear to the local park or around the house. Things will pick up quickly."
Breaking out
"They were undervalued before the Sephora deal, this could easily triple in the next year! I did ALL my Christmas shopping at Kohl’s this year. Best deals around and stores were packed!!"
"Down big on very low volume, let's see whether the shorts will use this opportunity to cover more of their failing positions. This is sector rotation out of the winners of the year, tech and consumer discretionary, nothing else. At least that is what the volume is saying. Shorts will use this as an opportunity to drive down the price but then again at some point they must cover. So look at the volume and stock price movement on the close. A few days ago they took it down big only to then buy up what was offered in the book at the close. Next short reporting will be end of next week and for last Friday, so we will get a good picture of how much covering they are doing."
What's funny is Kohl's jumped to a 52wk high on Macy's earnings beat. Now Macy's is up premarket and Kohl's down 2% on Kohl's beat. Shorts trying to gain some momentum and cut losses.
"The last 3 years charts tells that this will go back to 43-45 in Q3 end and 50-55 in Q4 end Q1 and back to 45's in end of Q2. Also by balancesheet this is way better, and safer than M or other similar retailer.. it is near to ~7-8yr lo and with great PE. This should be an easy buy with minimal downside and 15-30% upside in an year"
Yesterday I passed by our local Kohls store and was surprised to see that the parking lot was alomst full. I think Kss will reach $35-40 in next 3-5 months.
Kohls should rename the company Mervyns. They will have the same fate!
All stores are open. Shopping season has started. Wake up shorts. Better cover before this stock zooms past $30.
"Another 1.2M shares covered by the end of October, so that explains the move up. Down to 17.9M shares short. They have been covering nicely lately. Dillard's is still the big short story though with 300k covered down to 6.8M that is a huge portion of what is left of the float and they have a big buyback in place as well. That stock shows you how much a stock can be dominated by short covering when the shorts have no shares to buy. I think on Dillards the shorts could really get squeezed hard, they are still way to exposed."
70 by this long weekend
Recovery package is approved...up we go for Christmas.https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/trump-has-approved-revised-coronavirus-relief-package-wants-to-do-a-deal-kudlow
"lol is this loser still open? how? I'm old dnoigh to remember whdn they sold stuff and moved inventory. not anymore. worst business model ever. They rause prices 95 percent, then lower thdm 35-40 percent and expect people to rush in and buy it. lol lol They'll be out of business by Christmas."
Back to 19 bucks!
Oh my. I am neither long or short but wow. I do not short stocks but this looks bad. I was buying at $36 and selling at $42 when nobody wanted it. Normally I hold stocks especially ones like this with a good dividend. I kick myself for not holding on longer. But this is crazy. Look at the history of this stock when it reaches these levels. It is not a good thingl
"Macy's beat on slightly lower revenue. It was a big beat, so that should be good news for Kohl's next week as they usually outperform Macy's."
Looks like she’s going to 15 bucks again! Glad I dumped my shares weeks ago
"Buy all you can,, ceo and manipulating fund in bed with each other, $60 EASY,non stop,easy money!!"
"MichaelRlulz predicted this stock going down to $24 by the end of Friday. ""Everyone better watch out today."" He delete all of his posts, so I can't double check his predictions."
"Gilead just came out with a cure for Coronavirus that has proven highly effective. They are releasing for free 1.5 million doses or enough to fully treat 140,000 people.This treatment is given to the 5% of Americans most affected by Coronavirus and those treated recovered very quickly and has shown to be highly effective.Remember, the shut downs are to protect the 5% of Americans who are sickly, old and have underlying issues that make them most likely to die. Most Americans or 80 to 95 percent have no or mild symptoms to getting Coronavirus and in fact it is no threat at all to most of us.This means the country can return to normal very fast and restrictions can be lifted almost immediately.This is why the retail stocks are rising after hours.Shorts are going to get clobbered tomorrow."
Kohls is dead for last 5 years. Invest in online stores instead.
"I sold covered calls for 70$ and expiration date 18th Jan. Since the close price was 6.95 I did not expect to see any changes in my account, but when I looked this morning I was surprised that my option got exercised! I called my broker and they told me that option buyer actually exercised the option even though price was lower?!?! It was weird but I know it might happen. On the other hand I have not looked at premarket, but I think KSS price was up a little, so I'm thinking my broker might have acquired all my shares by exercising it at the open and sell it and locked the profit. Anyone thoughts?"
Heading to my 42 buy price.
"This is a $40 stock. Like M I don't know what it stands for selling all types of junk. It might not be until 2022, but it'll be back at pre-pandemic trends showing negative comps."
Great time to pile in if there ever was one. I refuse to believe that there was anything so bad in KSS's results or forecast.
the share price rise today is insane
Sold at 45. Will wait till it drops to 25 before I buy back.
Who's ready to be splurging all these gains on good assets/maybe a couple babes and cars in the future? These cheap prices will pay off HUGE! #DDTG $PLAY $KSS $SPR $CCL $CAKE $ERI
"Look, activism is fine but they need to STEP UP THEIR GAME as far as substantial ideas and substantial experience and success of board members presented."
"take the almost 6 percent dividend and relax, Kohl's has a bright future. The real estate alone is worth the market cap. this will continue to trade between 36 - 40,"
I knew there is a issue with merchandise content when my wife goes with a 30% coupon and comes home empty handed. “Nothing looked exciting”
"Looks like KSS wants to go green today, wondering if it will happen."
"Get ready for the big market dump, coming up next!"
"It was nice knowing you Kohl's. It won't last an economic slowdown, that is for sure."
The cheaper they can buy back treasury stock the better. Bring it on bears!
"Shorts trying hard. Kohl’s opening, country opening. We’re moving up"
Why down 4.4% today? What am I missing?
"Bad move if they replace directors. All they do is upgrade or down grade stocks, etc- bad move"
Scared sheep
"on line sales have peaked, it will be return to 38 % of market share, so investors should buy kss LB FL and some low price retailers"
KSS could easily earn $3 to 4/share this year!At a PE of 20 that would indicate a stock price of $60-80/shareThis will be a great year for KSS stock holders.AND the dividend too!
Rode it from around 45 to 68 + today. I am out. Good luck. May get back in under 60.
gov. of california just announced stores are allowed to open for in store shopping. good news for kohls.
Think there is a sell off after dividend payout? I don't think so as only 1%.
I’m in today time to make money
Kohl's cut to sell by UBS.Will buy more today with this sell.
not really keeping up with the other retailers today...but also not doing too bad with the market being down
why isn't KSS up 1.2% along with the market? Right now it's down 0.15%? Any ideas why it stop tracking with the dow? Thanks.
"So the question we now face is are we in a value trap stock (Ford is the poster child for that over the last 4 years)?We definitely don't have a near term catalyst as the shorts seem to be shorting more rather than covering, indeed they are making money even lately. The company is buying back stock, but not nearly as rapidly as it was. Earnings projections have all be taken up massively yet he stock doesn't respond, part of that might well be that analysts just believe we have reached a new earnings base and see little earnings growth. So far they are simply assuming the buyback will be what boost earnings, not actual growth.My take is there are positive catalysts:1) retailers that survive will do well, however, some, like Macy's, will turn more into landlords than retailers and that will fuel their growth. Kohl's may also do this by leasing out spare store space, this is an earnings growth catalyst.2) the short position can't stay at this level forever, they will go bankrupt as they have to pay the dividend, so there is still that short upside.3) Buybacks slowly but surely squeeze the shorts and move the price up, so as long as Kohl's continues to buy back stock, the stock price should move up due to simple supply and demand4) Amazon buyout and other joint ventures.5) A winning strategy of downsizing stores rather than closing and winning over customers from the failed retailers. This should keep the brick portion of retail growing for Kohl's as retailers like Sears, K-Mart and JCP are all likely to go under over the next year or so.6) Kohl's has an internet business to, so why can't they succeed in online retail?"
get ready for the opening of KSS. in at 19.07a few store closing would help this ticker too.
"can someone explain what happens when company buys back stocks? It looks like they are planning on doing this year, correct? If so, does that just mean the price will go up? or do they somehow specfically try to buy your stocks or do they just have to wait for that many to be available?"
"KSS beats earning... Kohl's (KSS) reported 4th Quarter January 2018 earnings of $1.99 per share. The consensus earnings estimate was $1.77 per share on revenue of $6.7 billion. The Earnings Whisper number was $1.80 per share.The company said it expects fiscal year earnings of $4.95 to $5.45 per share. The current consensus earnings estimate is $4.67 per share for the year ending January 31, 2019."
BBBY did not meet earning expectations. initially dropped and has since took off up over 10.00 per share since reporting earnings. Crazy
"Kohl's parking lots are packed, what manipulator is trying to kid everyone,No Way !!!!"
do you think it's a good idea to buy a little more around the 65 range?
"Screw by TJMaxx this morning I think. No worries, we have closed the gap up from earlier so technically we are just testing the recent lows. Should see some short covering coming in today to support the stock price and starting next week Kohl's can buy back shares. Given that they will buy back about 2.5M shares a quarter till the end of the year now, it will start getting tighter and tighter for the shorts."
Love Khols....always shop there....never shop at TGT...but TGT is a stronger company and digital sales are up 100%....gotta buy TGT instead of Khols here...
KSS & ACRX impressive % moves today
People mortgaged their house to buy Kohls at $56. Now they are broke.
Tell me when we get to $35 - I might consider buying then....
Boycott Kohls. They sold out to Amazon.
Tide is changing. San Francisco Bayarea has a good handle on the Coronovirus with shelter in place. Watch out with this stock- Back to $30
"The pain for KSS starts again, smh."
Market Cap about to dip under 7 Billion! Yikes! Dividend cuts imminent per the Street!
down 8% from today's high.... sellers abound
"So since 10/31 and 12/15 2M shares have covered and the stock went up $10, that has to be fun. With now 30.86M shares short we are back to 19% of the outstanding shares which means plenty up upside if/when they cover. Clearly JB is telling us the shorts think this is going to die in the new year, so we will have to wait post the Q4 earnings for the stocks reaction. It will be fun to see as news like Kohls expanding the Amazon deal and dividend increases affect the stock.For now, if Shorts want to short, they can drive down the price. Likely we had significant shorting yesterday as other retailers like Macy's gave back all of their gains from Tuesday. To me this means shorts are worried about a breakout and the current $57 level seems to be potential resistance that when overcome will really pop the stock, likely to the mid $60s."
Here come the shorts
KSS reached a 52 Week low at 24.75
If the trading range is with 5% before market means results are balanced. With Stock down so much already - I expect it to go higher in coming days.
"this is ridiculous- how low can this stock go? i am just guessing that the dividend may be trimmed a bit in future quarters, but this is about as solid as retail gets- isn't it?"
dont miss this http://tradeanalysis.zohosites.com/ .
Nothing personel. When your on the wrong side of the trade it's like someone took your arm off.
Heard the Russians and the Chinese are buying up Kohls stock !!!!!
Why does this keep falling after I bought some shares? Sucks
Interesting the market is up and this is down 1.10 on no news called manipulation. Thanks guys for the cheap 01/15/2021 CALLS those radar alerts are awesome. Near term low 15 long term high back to 60s .
back to 25 in a week
We are heading under $5 in few days
"KSS is like ""What trade war?"" See ya at the top."
This co is toast
"I buy everything online, except I buy clothes in Kohl's store because I have to feel the fabric and try on for sizing. Like returning Amazon packages at Kohl's. I no longer buy stocks for dividend. If they cut their dividend 1% the stock drops 10%."
Next stop in the high 50s then 60s then 70s!!
"I would like to thank Trump for a very very prosperous 2017 and KSS in part as well. You guys already know my bullish position on KSS and the growing economy which Trump/GOP tax bill will do next year. You all know what more money in consumer pockets will mean for spending. Here is what's next for Trump in 2018 and of course more economic stimulus for the economy...Infrastructure Spending. Trump first words as soon as he get back to Washington from his Florida vacation will be Infrastructure. Since KSS has been good to my pocket book, I wish to spread the wealth here via infrastructure stock which I bought last November at $35 in anticipation of the next Trump/GOP economic/legislative project...Here is my infrastructure stock...HDS...go ahead John Blanton short it as well."
"I have a Boycott Amazon sign and now I need to figure out how to put ""Boycott Amazon in kohls "" going to have to think that one through."
"So the latest buzz seems to be in store pickup. Wal-Mart has done this on a sizable scale and it is likely to acquire those customers who like the prices but not the in store experience. We will need to keep a close eye on this Amazon return ability at Kohl's. If that can work, it clearly will be a signal to Amazon that buying Kohl's might be the right move.As for Kohl's, their advertising has paid off as far as I can tell and the chatter on the company will be more positive going forward I think. Hopefully that will move the shorts out of the ballgame so that the stock price can gravitate back to a market multiple, which is really where it should be trading."
"i picked a helluva day to buy retail, bought on the dip but dipped more, ugh!"
"I would like to start a position in Kohl’s , maybe I can get a good down day and get under 66 , who knows"
"@baby blue ,, you must get scared seeing someone in a Mask,, LOL ,, baby thoughts!!!!!!"
That $58 level is going to be critical to get back above as it was our prior 52 week low. Shorts would like to see that be resistance now as it would basically invalidate all of last years performance.
Hello to all longs. Please make the case for me to purchase this stock at this time. I am looking for a few dividend producing stocks that have some upside potential. I live and work near Kohl's Corporate Headquarters and have no concerns about Amazon putting them out of business. I do have concerns about the lack of growth and declining profitability.Thanks in advance.
q4 expectations are too high but day of reckoning is mos away
bankrupt in 2021
Something up at Kohls !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
target will prob buy kohls for about 40 per share
Now would be a good time for KSS to get to work on share buybacks at this price level.
23.56 MUST HOLD if that breaks look out below. When will you baggies learn this stock is ran by swing traders?
Timber! Wow! $45.72!
Short 5500 shares we go lower
"Lot of debt, not many shoppers. Bad combination."
60 dollar stock trading at 40 has to be a good buy.
Russia expected to have an approved vaccine for Covid 19 by August 10th beating all other vaccine final stage 3 studies by months. Pfizer is expected to have FDA approval for a vaccine by Sept to October time frame with several million doses available.Looks life will soon return to normal. Kohls CEO says she plans to restore the very generous dividend as soon as sales and profits return to normal. This is easily one of the most profitable plays in retail going forward. A very well run and managed business that is highly profitable prior to covid.And will be again soon. With far less competitors going forward.Definitely a solid case for investing mid to long term in KSS>
I'm looking for cheap shares this morning!
"Need to announce a buyback, this alone will push it back to low %50s. If China deal is done, $60s... Or, just sit back and collect almost $3 dividend a year!"
"Just my gut feeling we are going to hear that discretionary spending on clothing and home goods and toys is way up. Nobody is going on cruises this year. Nobody is going to professional sports games. very few are going to college sports games. nobody is taking overseas vacations. nobody is going to the movie theater. everyone I know is eating out very little. so what's left to spend it on your house, vehicles, and shopping. I suppose some people already had a house and vehicles before this pandemic hit "
in the next few hours back to the 21's again
Fk! Kohls!! Sold all that rat #$%$ stock!! Hate that place. Haven't been there in 2yrs now much better deals on better designs at tjmaxx
who wants to make Amazon even bigger. People need to get off their #$%$ and shop the brick and mortar. Also notice these comment sections on yahoo (Owned by Verizon)are the only ones that are available. I'll be cancelling my Verizon phone plan soon.
"People keep pouring money into pie in the sky winners like Tesla and ignoring beaten up stocks in sectors like retail. Kohls is a very good retailer, on par with TGT and WMT and AMZN, but at fire sale prices thanks to the pandemic. When investors wae up to this opportunity, it will be $40 in no time and paying $1+ dividend. In two years, it will be back to $50-$60 and maybe paying $2+ dividend. Do you think Tesla will be trading at the combined value of VW (#1 car maker) and Toyota (#2 car maker) in two years? What dividend will Tesla pay? Short term gamblers always lose."
Looks like Dump is gonna have to cave or lose even more of the Farmers vote! What a #$%$!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-has-no-choice-but-to-land-a-trade-deal-with-china-134004136.html
"Kohl's re-opened stores in four states on May 4, will add 10 states by May 118:26 am ET May 7, 2020 (MarketWatch)Share Print"
Why the spike the last 30 minutes?
Going off the rails now!
"people going to keep selling into earnings, or you think it will come back up today?"
Amazon would have to bid about $80/share to buy Kohls.This means owners of KSS could see a massive gain from current prices.KSS CEO also says after this covid nonsense is over they plan to restore the dividend which they are committed to paying and restore the stock buy back program too.Covid vaccines are nearly ready and should be given to the public this October restoring the USA back to normal. Russia already has a vaccine that they plan to approve in a week and then mass produce and vaccine all of Russia in October this year.Covid soon will a thing of the past. Great time for Amazon to strike while the iron is hot and buy out KSS>
anyone hate shorters? hands up
If you cannot sleep tonight.......sell this and buy ESSI...........
"10,000 shares at 18.78 ave. Me So Happy"
"From what I get from a buyer at another clothing store, covid hit at about the same time christmas buying was happening so stores cut way back and are currently way understocked. At the same time 90% of the country is still working but not traveling, going to concerts, going to sporting events, so has money to spend., and they are spending on clothes. The reports I get is spending is ahead of last year which is hard to believe but is happening. Bottom line we are looking at a discount free christmas with heavy margins. I would look for a solid 3 q and a solid guidance for the christmas season"
"I went to Kohl's yesterday. I expected Saturday to be busy. The store was completely dead, and the dressing rooms were completely closed. If that is the new norm, Kohl's won't be in business long."
Lol. What a joke
Thank you for cheap shares.... September long weekend coming up 
Strong sell before they file chapter 11.. don't be left holding an empty bag!
Why are you morons paying the gap up? Nobody is going to shop at Kohls even when they open their doors and the S&P futures being up have nothing to do with this stock. It's going to get plowed again in it's moving average downtrend.
"Up, up and away"
"Like I said, dont be surprised if it closes up today. But hey it's a stock. Stocks go up and down.The more important thing is the great dividends returning and the post covid means better and better brighter future ahead."
getting NEAR MY ENTRY-45-46
"put your money in gold its safe now , JNUG, USLV, UGD, AG"
"oversold, TGT holds up like invincible"
When Kohl’s was down to $11 - what happened to these investors? When Kohl’s stock price has recovered- now these unique investors want to raise their voice. This is nothing but pump and dump scheme begore earnings. Not a good time to buy or short.
"MORGAN STANLEY GAVE KOHLS KSS A SELL RATING WITH A $15 DOLLAR PRICETARGET. Those (^&*()), the stock is now at $18 dollars. They're either incompetent or they'rescamming folks in my view. Never listen to Morgan Stanley."
Very good day !!!!!!
"The BoA report is what I've been tracking for many months. I was in retail management many years ago, and recognize Kohls has done an excellent job navigating these government mandated shutdowns. Stock analysts bash Kohls because it was not on essential open lists, but I know better. I've played the ups and downs for gains, but stayed long (very long) on a few hundred shares. I'll hold these at least another year and possibly longer, I need to slowly add quality dividend power in my holdings. The parking lot for the Kohls by my house is always packed, this another good sign. The demise of JCP and Sears only adds more business."
very stable! Great performance. Building a base getting ready for jumping into the 60s very soon!!Don't let them fool you!!
"In Kohl's 2019 Annual report, it looks like they own about 90% of their stores (p. 43) with a book value of $7.4 billion. Also, their $1.9 billion in long-term debt is unsecured, which indicates it was not used as collateral when the bonds were issued. Given their financial strength, is there any reason why Kohl's cannot either issue more debt or sell some of their stores to generate cash? Because Kohl's stock price is less than 50% of their tangible book value, their financial strength should be enough to weather the storm."
I initiated my first long position of KSS and M in March at insane low prices. No one is getting me to sell at this insanely low prices. If some nut is willing to sell you will have to buy the shares from them. These are long term positions in these great companies and I expect to get more than 700 percent capital gains and when the dividends are restored a massive dividend income too.These are my shares now and I a millionaire and plan to keep these long positions as a long term part of my highly diversified porfolio.Would not even consider selling KSS for any price less than $60/share and M for less than $39/share.
"I have over 25 years of retail experience, and can tell you that $KSS has done an outstanding job through this Covid 19 crisis. Mandatory govt shutdowns, and pulled inventory back inline, maintained liquidity, and now adjusted profit of $0.01 per share. Every time I drive by our local Kohl's, the parking lot is packed; no surprise, safe non-mall location, great quality and variety. This will be a $40 min stock by August, holding my shares bought at $17 very long for the dividends returning this next year."
very busy Southern california. took a poll of my staff they did alot of christmas shopping there. the gift section was well shopped by christmas. I like they way I bought some clearance shirts buying online and picking up in local stores. They show you stocking at local stores for free pickup. So Kohls keeping their shipping costs to a minimum. The shirts are now all sold out.
"Really, retail down because AMZN increased min wage? Looks like it is time to buy."
Great hatchet article by InvestorPlace that came out a couple days ago. What a joke!
Nice to see who is short...the back drop going forward is positive.....good luck
"Ex-Dividend date is Monday. It is crazy for this to lose 1/3 in just weeks for a bit lower earning. People seem to forget that Holidays season earnings dominates for retails, which means the lower May quarter actually means almost nothing."
"Thank you Kohl's I have been getting killed in retail and fashion of late, was very hopeful that you would come through for me, Macy's and Tapestry surely did not nor for that matter Capri. I am hoping that American Eagle can follow suit."
Kohls dropping My Pillow is an attack on US. NEVER buy from Kohls again.
$JWN is about a month or two behind $M $KSS and $GPS don’t worry. Nordstrom will catch up to them
Dividend not in jeopardy.
"If it breaches what someone called yesterday as the resistance at 18.63, I might close my position all together for now. It'd still be selling at relatively high and buying lower."
will negative news from the fed hurt this?
Sell Sell Sell. It is going to be another Macy's stock. Downgrade is coming. Mark my words.
"Analysts have taken down their numbers and in the process we now have earnings growth projections for 2021 and 2022. So that should stabilize the stock price give its low P/E and dividend. Also, with a continued strong stock buyback that boosts the fair value significantly as earnings are projected to stabilize at these lower levels and rise over the next two years. That gives this stock a 15-20 P/E opportunity if the buybacks continue to be aggressive and boost earnings."
"I think this is the real recovery coming up, they did the quick three head fakes, anymore and the ref will call them for walking."
Going to 45 by April! Hang on
"Reason #26 to own KSS: The advertise on Jimmy Kimmel Live! With the exception of football, TV doesn't get any better than JKL"
Short squeeze
Kohl's reinstating their dividend @ ~10% yield. This is insane with a 10 year @ 0.9%. This stock should be double if not triple its current market cap!!!
This should survive but after this blood bath who can afford a tesla. Tesla should be $25 not Kohls.
"Just wondering how and why does a stock get taken down $1.50 in 200,000 shares trading?"
KSS reached a 52 Week low at 45.30
"BOYCOTTING AMAZON YET? If not, you deserve losing money on Kohls. I like going into Kohls, but if Amazon keeps taking away clothing business, you might not have many Kohls left after a year or two. It is your choice--- buy local or buy on Amazon and drive local businesses out of business. Amazon is a cancer. Did you see where they are discounting the products that others sell on its site and then they reimburse them with amazon money. They use predatory pricing trying to drive others out of business."
"volume is starting to taper and the price is drifting up, so hopefully we are starting to see the sellers wane and the shorts covering continue."
"Recently started a position at $38.20. Company is cheap, dividend is safe. They will find a way to deal with the online market place. It's selling for a little over book value isn't it? Company buy backs should help too."
Kohl’s won’t make it. It might go under before Macy’s.
"Thanks for the heads-up Kite.Bank of America on CNBC today discussing Kohl's and their upgrade to Buy.Today 7/8/20 on CNBC's 1:00 E.T. ""The Exchange"". If watching on DVR, it begins at the 20:00 mark"
In less than a year it will start the same irreversible trend to nothing as Sears did and JCP is headed. Lucky if you get 20 bucks a share next holiday season.
Seems like it shouldn’t drop
Is this 'gem' going to lose more money and how much is it gonna lose? At this point nothing else really matters as I feel like l have already lost enough money on this...
"Boycotting Amazon yet? If not, you deserve to lose money as it destroys other stores."
KSS reached a 52 Week low at 13.84
"selling off with increased volume, negative market sediment in this sector. If it breaks thru support at this level could go lower in next several days. Just because it is cheap not as important as slow growth rate."
"The old model is dying but Kohl’s is a hybrid and will be a powerhouse based on locations, buildings, market niche and what they can do with those! I’ve been in retail corporate for 30 years and know the business and consumers better than YOU ever will!"
CEO on CNBC; AHHHH eye candy. Finally a nice looking CEO
"I'm not a finance guy, nor I know anything about these stuff. But, just reading KSS news today, 20%+ drop compare to weaker 2017 guidance seems over done. Especially, considering if (and it could be big IF) corporate tax reduction is coming (assuming in 2017), will that combination makes it more attractive at this price?"
"Once AMZN sees how many returns were made to KSS this return season and how they translate into KSS sales AMZN is either going to make a bid to KSS to immediately gain a huge physical footprint or they will build out their own physical locations, maybe incorporating Whole Foods locations. Either a huge positive for KSS or could turn south for them very quickly, depends on which strategy amzn decides to go with. They killing the physical stores to now take them over"
Retail can open at 25% capacity starting Monday in Florida.
BOYCOTT AMAZON.
Shareholders better get in touch with management before they twitter this company. Now I'm going to order another MyPillow. I could have drove up the street to Kohls to buy one but I dont like their weak knee political approach. When will these companys learn to just stay neutral.
"in reality, a lot of people off school or doing work from home will have more time to shop at the store through the day and avoid shipping issues. I'm pretty confident shopping at stores like Kohl's where they have a greeter offering sanitizer and checking masks. check out lanes with spacing. delays on restocking returns etc. A basic 'we got this"" attitude"
"Kohls will be fine.....coming into seasonally strong retail season, dividend, Not to mention a lot of money managers who have lagged the market watching this for some quick gains.....only downside I see is tax loss selling....good luck longs.."
it's being valued like it's going bankrupt this is a buy all day long I'm buying some
Crash and Burn Baby!
"Congratulations to all of the morons and ""chartists"" (which is just a special kind of moron) who were stupid enough to sell yesterday."
Back to the Future! Next stop the 50s then the 60s and beyond!!
Talk about fear! Imagine waking up and learning that KSS received an offer from Amazon of $80/share and in premarket it is selling or $78/share. How would you feel if you are short millions of shares of KSS that day?Now that is fear.
I totally agree that KSS as a store is on the rebound and that MANY people are visiting but that doesn’t necessarily translate to the stock going up.
"Why this slam down, anybody knows?"
what will be the price around May...during summer..
Too much chatter on boards about shorting this down. I am out. GLTA!
Holding up well. Should see $24 soon.
The consumer had lots of cash and is buying. They have cabin fever and yearn to go to the malls and brick and mortar. Because it is fun.
Kohl's reached a 52 Week low at 33.54
If Amazon would buy either one purchasing Kohls would get Michelle Gass on your team who has one of the sharpest minds in marketing.She is taking over the helm in May
KSS is down 13.01% to 24.75
They are selling the real estate and renting from the buyer. Desperate?
"Another Big Box Store primed to go under! Who Knew? Stocks to consider JC Penney, Sears, KMart, Shopko, etc, etc, etc!"
5 cents off low nice rally
Should I cover?
Would not touch this until next quarters earnings can show a turn around!Heading into earnings will most undoubtedly lead to lower share price!Sorry! Not trusting retail with #$%$ Trump fighting with China!
"I am long this stock, but what do you think of upcoming ER? I always like to get some protection. Selling some covered calls? Thoughts?"
Another 25% up will be a nice end to the week.
Is there any announcement on the divi? I looking for a $.06 pop. That might give us some follow through.
"As I’ve said before, there will be a group of investors that will be moving in on this one over the next couple weeks to make the June 10th Ex div date, with this 5%+ yield. Forward PE now we’ll under 10."
Two stores within 5 miles of my home and their parking lots are filled with new cars driven by white women in their thirties and forties. They will be fine. THESE STORES ARE NOT LOCATED IN MALLS. Everyone coming out of store carrying bags.
I have a feeling KSS will see a pullback now. What yall think? Do you guys find it difficult to know when to buy or sell something? I prefer to get my stocks from aw-esomeSTOCKS.
So far I am happy I added to my portfolio today @ $54.75 GLTA
This stock would reach 71.00 and beyond today. There will be big short squeeze..
This is 1 of the retail survivors. Well run . I think one day it may even be a take-out candidate. I am a shareholder good luck longs. A real company not a fake one like so many bubble stocks.
This trading pattern is getting predictable and boring.
"I was thinking about how president Obama stimulus injection to the economy, it took our mkts to new highs yes!? well president trumps stimulus will be much bigger! so like how much higher will our markets go this time? and will kohl's follow that top line? I think  so !"
"On the positive side, these are the kinds of days shorts should be covering, so there should be some support. Look for a huge volume day today. As to how many will have covered we won't know for quite some time as we still wait on the 11/15 position levels to be reported next week and then must wait like 3 weeks for the 11/30 data."
Lol
"i heard when you return a ups package to ups store or ups access point, that store get a commission for each package they received.do Kohl get a commission from amazon if i return a amazon package to kohl ?"
Nice! Looks like back to $18! I missed selling yesterday but will do so at the open.
"Mid 30s, here we come."
"wow, this hurts to watch"
AMAZON doesn't partner to loose. Keep KSS
"There is a financial GENIUS working at Zacks Equity Research. Just read this amazing insight into Kohl's future stock price after the earning report next week:""The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 17. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kohls-kss-expected-beat-earnings-173005744.htmlWow! Did anyone here know that by beating expectations the stock might move up? Or even that missing could move the stock lower? Amazing information Zacks."
"Bought 2,000 shares at $48. such a buy right now!Kohl's is my favorite store. Just went there Sunday - bought so many Christmas presents.It was packed - had to stand in line for over 10 minutes, the line was so long."
Likely earning beat tomorrow.https://www.nasdaq.com/article/kohls-kss-q4-earnings-sales-likely-to-rise-heres-why-cm926485
"$35. tomorrow,,NO SWEAT, SOME ONE IS PUSHING KSS ,,FINALLY !!!!!!"
46-45-44-43-42-40=I buy under 40
Retail is the canary in the coal mine. Better learn to grow crops and make your own clothing and furniture. Get some animals to raise.
Hooray. Price just hit 29.50 and bounced right back above $30.Who bought at 29.50 as I recommended last week ???
"Looks like my estimate of $55 before earnings is on track (heck could even be $55 by Xmas), though I'm now crossing my fingers to $60 before earnings because even Moody is now chiming in on the positive side of retail AND since I am very confident that the Amazon Return program will give them a boost they report that the program is indeed very very successful helping Amazon reduce transportation costs.By April, it would have been a year when KSS management approached AMZN for the amazon gadget partnership and the Amazon Return initiative...so what I am saying is Amazon will be convinced by then that they can work with current management and buy them out for 25-30% premium $85-$90 buck baby."
Anyone else waiting for 20's?
Why do think they are down aftermarket
All my shorts have the same pattern a 15-20 minute surge and then drop. Just look at stocks following the DOW up and then fall. KSS is financially strapped.
Comments to support your position is not stock advice. That's all I see here.
"It always amazes me how people can refer to loving their dividend on a stock like this. You just LOST 2.5 YEARS worth of dividends, how is that a positive?? However, would you buy it NOW?? Maybe.......if they don't cut the dividend. GL"
"well, any insights for today?"
Where is Michael Ruiz??????
What price do you think might be the bottom? I
Play with fire you get Burned!! Fry those shorts!!
"Too funny, really? People saying this will hit 40 again, give me a break this will hit 80 again. This is the latest attempt at tanking the markets to tank the economy, you fall for this, you will fall for anything. Do not own, but own a lot of fashion and retail. The big money hates Trump and wants him out so they can continue to push for their globalist agenda which he and Boris Johnson put to an abrupt end. I know people say they hate people commenting on politics on these blogs, but that is the reality of our markets, they are being controlled by politics. Half of our population hate Trump and will do anything to see him out of office, this is merely their last ditch effort."
RIP shorts !
"Good results are baked in, just a matter of how far it dives....to 60 or 55."
"I am glad to see revenues were up. As long as Amazon's revenues are up, the stock goes up, but it doesn't work for all the other retailers. Amazon gets a pass."
KSS is screaming buy. They will probably miss stupid street expectations however profit is profit and keeps the dividend safe. Best managed retail company. Try reading a balance sheet before making investment decision.
"My guess is we had a bottom a day or so ago but the assessment of a coming world wide recession gave the shorts the excuse to short more of retail and that is what took us to new lows. Today's price action is of course again encouraging but with bottoms, this one likely has to get retested unless we get a huge rally here, which is unlikely."
This stock has dropped 36% in the last 4 days. Ridiculous. Every Kohl's shopper loves Kohl's cash and the brand. They aren't going away and most likely Amazon will buy them soon. Everyone will be back shopping in most stores by May. Way overblown. Heck of a deal. It should at least bounce back 10-20% when they announce no more stock dividends.
"What's the upside of Sephora for Kohl's? Here's what JCP said about losing Sephora in court filings earlier this year pre-dissolution of their contract:""JCPenney, which is looking to reopen nine stores this week, stated in the filing that it “would suffer irreparable harm, including the disruption of its business, the loss of clientele, and the loss of goodwill” if the Sephora contract were to be terminated."
Great hatchet article by Bloomberg today........
"Don't own the stock, but no up tick rule and the algos programmed to pounce, KSS will fall early. Setting up to be a strong buy imo."
I believe one day Amazon may just buy out Kohl’s
Dont forget too besides a stupid Trump trade war and covid last year was the shortest shopping periodbetween Thanksgiving and Christmas possible.That all is changing.Not mention now many of KSS competitors are bankrupt and out of business. HUGE growth potential to take market share.
A positive earnings report in 12 days and announcement of dividend reinstatement should give KSS a nice boost.
"Relax, this is a HEAD-FAKE."
I own Amazon not kohls but I see Amazon saving Kohls if needs. They like there footprint....Still not buying Kohls but I like shopping there more than any other retailers. Good luck longs
"Don’t you just live how analysts control stock prices? Not great management, or earnings beats, or raised future guidance can overcome the power of analysts with their never good enough expectations!"
KSS reached a 52 Week low at 19.32
already used so many $30 off $60 purchase coupons at Kohls that they will never make a profit on me
"I think it's gonna be a good day, not for Stoxx though."
"The KSS stock price action is ridiculous. Here's a profitable company with $20B/yr revenue and a big dividend supported by their balance sheet and cash flow. Sure, retail is hated sector and Coronavirus will impact earnings. But it makes no sense for the stock price to be dropping as if Kohl's stores are located on cruise ships. KSS went from $75 last year to half that amount a couple weeks ago. In the last week, KSS has gone from $35 to $24. I believe Kohl's is in a position to not only survive but thrive when weaker retailers (like JCP) go broke. Kohl's footprint of stores and locations makes it a perfect acquisition for Amazon to buy (similar to when they bought Whole Foods). Hindsight, wish I would have waited until today to buy. Painful now, but still a long-term winner. Of course, there a many other stocks at crazy low prices right now, but KSS has strong fundamentals despite being a retailer. Good luck to all."
"Looking good to finally close above the 200dma of $71.41. If so, first time since Nov. 19th."
"Meanwhile, TJ Maxx misses on the bottom line and gives weak guidance and they are about to turn green after being down hard this morning."
"wow, down big today when the market is very very green, what's the bad news"
This just tells you even low p/e high dividend stocks could go south.
"A couple of things to factor in:1) Shorts are covering but we still have a sizable short position, which means the real stock price for KSS is much higher than it currently is.2) The tax cut for businesses is going to pass, retailers pay among the highest tax rates and thus this tax cut should boost future earnings by 20% or more.3) With the tax cut passed, KSS has much more money available to give back to shareholders, so look for them to be buying back stock again and maybe aggressively now till the quiet period. Further pain for the shorts.4) I think Q4 will be a blowout for retailers, so estimates will go up and of course a beat on earnings is pretty much in the bag. Throw in the tax cut and guidance for next year will be significantly higher than this years performance.5) The short squeeze has not happened yet, though today's price action may be the starting signal."
GonnaDouble
Lets see KSS has 20 billion in revenue and Dicks Sporting goods 9 billion revenue with about the same amount of stock float yet DKS closed at 26.88 and KSS closed at 15.39. Some will look back at this post months from now when KSS is back to 30.00 and wonder why they sold the stock down here Im 100% sure of that.Long term calls are my ticket. Those that are buying puts so far thats worked as today will be day number 4 of a fall from over 20.00 .I will add long terms with thanks !
Is this a common theme? Falls apart at the end of the day?
this stock will move back to $40s. So much beating for nothing
kohls to add groceries and lumber... allegedly...
"So the analysts play was that for every 1% gain in share for online 9,000 stores will close and he thinks online can grow to 25% by 2025. The mistake he has made is that he has not looked at the trend over the last 5 years which clearly is showing that on-line retail is reaching a plateau much sooner than anyone expected. With clothing being returned twice as often as other things, clothing is likely one of the few moat sectors out there, if properly paid.Kohl's has done well in this environment because they have focused on costs and keeping stores open. Thus they have benefited from the demise of other retailers and due to their excellent use of cash, been able to buy back a significant amount of their outstanding shares to help stabilize the stock price."
"Stores are open, long weekend, people ready to go out and shop again and KSS is down about 4%. Doesn’t bode well with the narrative all the longs have been saying. Why isn’t all that big money swooping in to buy this great value?Women and children first, she’s going down."
$12.66 on Thur or Fri this week?
"If you look at history of KSS after earning reports, it usually go down. But after one to two days , then it up to the sky.. Look at Q3 earning . Hold is better than sell. If u sell, u will regret"
A son of man stopped shopping at Kohl's when they removed fishing rods and lures from the shelves. A Senator who let our water quality go to pot!
"Some good news on the shorting front from 5/1-5/15. For Kohl's itself there were about 1.8M shares covered, so this is good as shorts seem to want to throw in the towel on Kohl's. However, there was heavy shorting of the XRT. So my guess is that Tuesday we saw heavy sector shorting early in the day and then a lot of covering on Kohl's itself as they took advantage of the gift. We should see this reflected in a quick recovery of the stock price and a test of the $70 level as this will mean that there are likely fewer shares of Kohl's in the float now than before Tuesday. We will know more on 6/11 but the fact that so many shares covered on Kohl's itself is a positive sign that the shorts might be getting tired of losing."
"what's up with retail today? and why is KSS down more percentage than all of the other retailers, even though it's risen to the top over and over again amongst the retailers?"
Trump withdraw iran deal. Oil will be up up . Retail sector will be down..SELL
Grabbed 4000 shares at $20 for dividend.X tomorrow for .70
With so many expert at zack's they couldn't see this 20 % hair cut coming for KSS ?
kohl s Department stores are doing just great. Check the stores parking lots.
"Bought 300 calls for LULU on Thursday of last week when price was 288. Loaded on 21 calls for KSS yesterday which I'll be cashing in soon. RSI have been over 75 all day way overbought. The FEDS have the printing presses on,but when they cut them off look out below. Enjoy it while it lasts and always lock in profits!"
KSS is down 5.20% to 51.06
Should see low $30.'s once Market crashes!

"Watch your step boys...the game is on the retail sector and the market overall. What game? The short the market game because of the lock up period and it is a game easily won in the short term because of the nervousness of investors. This stock is not safe now...in addition to the lock up period coming up in a week, the WEATHER has been very bad during the quarter and this will have an effect on retail sales. Retail companies reporting will cite the weather for the shortfall. Looking for KSS to fall to $55"
honestly Kohl's stores too me look just like JCPenney's
"Never fails, as soon as i buy the stock, it starts to drop"
"Here is my take on why Kohl's will give above average returns compared to the rest of the stock market over the next 4-5 years and very likely trade over $120. Note this post likely will be deleted as shorts flag it for removal and yahoo deletes offensive posts, even if they aren't. This is what censorship on financial boards looks like.Given the current $80 stock price Kohl's has room to increase in value by 50% to $120+ in the next 4 years and significantly out perform the market. It is a strong buy for the following reasons:1) Roughly $400M excess depreciation over CapEx hides almost $2 a share in earnings. As time flies depreciation will come back down to in line CapEx and thus boost earnings. Currently we benefit from this $400M deduction in stronger cash flow and paying less taxes, supporting stock and debt buybacks. The extra nearly $2 in earnings are worth about $25 a share.2) The short position exceeds 15% of the stock, this should produce at least a 15+% increase in the stock value as it covers and I value that at +$12 alone.3) Kohl's will continue to buy back shares, buyback roughly 4+M a year and thus boosting earnings by 10% over 4 years. That is worth another +$12 a share.4) Kohl's small store footprint creates new revenue through leases that flow straight to the bottom line as the stores are already paid for and only modifications need to be performed, so a minor Cap Ex increase. My guess is that over the next 4 years half of Kohl's stores will have retail space leased out and produce another $0.50-$1.00 in earnings or +$6-12 a share.5) Failing retailers will effectively negate the Amazon sales loss as Bon-Ton, JCP and Sears customers who like to shop in stores will opt for other stores, not shopping on line.6) As revenue grows and the company leverages technology to become more efficient, there is likely room for 6+% earnings growth from 4+% increases in revenue. With the share buybacks that gives you a 10+% yearly earnings growth rate that warrants the 15 P/E the stock trades at. Note that the actions outlines above will also reinforce the idea that Kohl's can generate 10+% year over year earnings growth over the next 4-5 years. It may even be higher.So sum it up and you have $25+$12+$12+$6-12 = $55-61 in additional share price power in the stock, easily getting it north of $120 over the next 4-5 years."
"You'd have to go back to 1998 to find Kohl's stock at this price. With the major downturn in the market, it is a great time for corporations to repurchase their stock."
Amazon buys and turns all kohl’s into distribution center’s coming soon
"FLX, Sephora, and record e-commerce will take Kohl's to new record high revenues and earnings. imo that's what's driving the share price up consistently, it's the real deal"
"60 here we come. @John Blanton, still not late to cover your short and limit your losses. We are heading to 70 soon."
Phew! What a Disaster! Selling at $50.80 is looking pretty good right now!
Truly garbage stock to have.
"The chart was setting up so nicely, now I think we need to wait a few more days for the 50 dma to turn positive as well. Kohl's has said they get 20% of their imports from China and with the currency devaluation 10% tariffs on those goods are actually a wash. So there really shouldn't be that big of an impact in terms of increased cost to Kohl's, especially if they can shift production to Mexico or other Asian countries, something that likely will now happen as China seems to want to wait out the next election. So they will lose the jobs permanently."
Some misinformed investors here or could we say Robinhooders. Kohls is best of breed and will be fine. After pandemic people will want to shop brick and mortar. Kohls is king of supply chain and has built up its online presence. You will want to be an owner for years to come. Dividend will be back in 2 quarters. Back to $35 than $50 later in 2021. You heard it here...short all you want Robinhooders
I expected a pop this week but lets wait till mid Jan when the decline will begin.....
Thanks for the info. They must be pretty confident that cash flow looks good going forward if they are going to offer a 4% yield. It also helps longs stick around. Thanks again.
Oops. I sold yesterday. Not sure if this is the sector I want to be in anymore. Department stores have been getting smacked

"Some support around $44.23, then stronger support @ $42.07! If $42. doesn't hold, it's back to $37! Doomed Pig!"
Wth is his I heard they beat earnings buy the stock falls?
"The stock has been mercilessly shorted over the last year which has negated a massive stock buyback. It seems to me with the Amazon news that this should finally end as the company has delivered solid results. It was at $44 pre-market after Q2 earnings before the Macy news took it down in sympathy. Now we have regained that level and it is time to take a close look at the 20% short position. I think they shorts are caught out and will take some serious pain here. Later today we will get the update on the position at the end of August and this is likely to show that they didn't start covering yet. Clearly the recent moves, which seem to align with the Amazon news, are showing that there is some covering.At some point the shorts will see a technical breakdown on their positions, I think that likely comes as we move into the massive gap up area we had last fall. The stock doesn't need to break out to new 52 highs, it just needs to break out into that gap for the professional shorts to start to throw in the towel on their positions. Once that happens and the 20% position gets reduced, you will see a massive move up in the stock price because I think there are just not enough shares out there for them to buy with the 55 cent dividend Kohls is paying."
cnbc wrong wrong always wrong
As Peter Lynch said to make money in stocks you have to have the willpower to hold long term and as in dieting success is more dependent on the strength of your gut versus your mind.
"Looks like Kohls is the latest hack victim. Somebody just released 1,000 Kohl's Cash codes on mailinatordotcom in the kohls inbox. Wow, is anyone safe from these hackers?"
"Kohl's ceo is a chemical student, she knows nothing about Retail,like barra&GM, a joke."
I am buying more
Is it a good time to buy some shares!?
I'm up 140% on KSS now the divy and buy backs are in play!
20 day Bollinger is way down at $15.69. with the MA at $18.30 big spread for this to fall. Went up way too fast and for no good reason other than a pump n dump run...now the MM will make twice as much shorting it and loading cheap PUTS while leaving you retail investors holding the bag AGAIN. Enjoy kids!
"Well they missed, same store sales didn't grow as they expected and I bet there was some cleaning up to do from the last CFO, that he left in basically under a year was red flag for me.On the positive side, cash looks solid and they continued to buy back shares aggressively. Indeed more aggressively than I thought they would. Looks like they might actually hit the top end of their $400M-$500M range. Given that they have already bought back 8M shares that could well turn into 10m by Q4. Of course that is 5% of the outstanding shares and makes earnings look all the worse, but in the end this is going to be a rebound story off of 2019, so the worse 2019 numbers are the better the growth story in 2020 will be. We will get whacked, not sure how the shorts will react, we will know more by the middle of December. My guess is that with this aggressive of a buyback and the cash to execute it they have to worry about running out of rope."
"""Kohl's shares could pop 50% as Amazon partnership ramps"" says Jefferies analyst Randal Konic who raised his price target for KSS to $100 from $66. The partnership is a ""win for both companies"". He was on CNBC."

Showing pretty good support at $40. May buy more
Shorted 1000 shares.....P/E ratio 44.75. Absurd for a value stock.
Doomed for mid $40.'s after ex-div date!No reason to go long at these prices!
where is KSS headed in next month?
Kohl's is down 8.95% to 23.81
if your still shorting this you made a big mistake prime day is a test for. Amazon and Kohl's to become one. Day goes well look for Amazon to think about buying Kohl's this makes things easier for Amazon and Kohl's.
KSS taking a new run for the 50s!
NOBODY IS BUYING at this price-- Would You ?? Nooooo ! SELL !!!!!!
Bank of america raised KSS price target to $ 70 and BUY ratinghttps://ledgergazette.com/2018/02/25/kohls-kss-pt-raised-to-70-00-at-bank-of-america.html
"This will also show nice earnings growth year to year, it will have to trade at a market multiple soon based on those earnings, so we are going to see $70-80 here this year I think."
Before market close stimulus need maybe to give it a pop
Thought of buying under 42 will pass. I would advise to GET OUT!
downgrade loss already recouped
Picked up a few shares using my Kohl's cash.
"Cramer just added more KSS shares. Like Cramer? see my FB group, Action Traders. - Shortly after you receive this Alert, we will be purchasing 150 shares of Kohl's (KSS) at roughly $46.44. Following the trade, KSS (1450 shares) will represent 2.49% of the portfolio-"
I think shares will recover to its currently $58.66 range
"The short status for 3/15 is up. XRT added another 7+M short shares so the pro's are likely shorting the whole sector in anticipation of a recession and the inversion of the yield curve. Kohl's had a much smaller increase, but an increase. So I think this is quite positive in that the selling has happened and likely was the reason the stock price declined so steadily post earnings. The Kohl's short position is now up to 26.74M shares so there is lots of ammo if they ever decide to give up."
I would like to pat myself on the back as average consensus is now at the $5.50 in earnings for 2018 I have been talking about for most of the year. Let's see if how conservative I was when they report Q3 and then Q4! In any case the stock warrants a higher stock price and people will notice that sooner or later.
"All kohl’s stock needs now is a strong Christmas (likely with the way things have been going)and its at $75 with no PE expansion which it should deserves by now. That doesn’t take into consideration the potential expansion of the Amazon deal, Aldi deal and stock buybacks."
"I think we will not be as bad as Macy's since Kohl's has already lowered guidance for the year. So odds are good they beat on estimates and then won't need to guide down for the year. I don't think they will guide up no matter how good they report because of the tariff fears, but if they have a decent Q2, by the time Q3 rolls around, they likely will be forced to guide up for the year. Especially if they continue the buyback at these sub $50 depressed prices. Kohl's could buy back as many as 10M shares this year if this stock price carnage continues while the company still executes well."
Taking a massive short position at 24.26 GLTA
"Hummmm high volume in a bit rice increase. Guess many big guys unloading before next leg down .. good dividend..UTG. This gives monthly dividend.which results very profitable.

"Nothing but emotional morons trading this stock. They will get plowed again for chasing it up. What was resistance 2 days ago is now temporary support, that's how stupid they are."
Is it good to buy KSS now? any suggestions
How much more of a beat down can this stock take???
"Another nice negative article just before earnings likely a favor to a shorty friend to help them drive down the price so they can cover. Let us not forget the CEO was rather optimistic in an interview a week or so ago and that the PopSugar selections have been on sale since September. Given how the internet works, I think Kohl's will surprise to the upside and possibly significantly. It will be an interesting week or so coming up."
Until there is some degree of volatility. The machines and algos do this every time. It’s like it’s free money. Closed lows of day.
I just need a little more!
Charts falling apart. 5 day and 10 day just crossed down. 18.80 or lower coming soon
school clothes plus xmas shopping this stock at this price is a great buy.BUY AND HOLD
"Amazon should buy Kohl's at this cheap price,, almost would be a Steal !!"
huh! time to pile on in my opinion.
BOYCOTT KOHLS/AMAZON. kOHLS IS A TRAITOR AND SOLD OUT TO THE ENEMY.
Rinse and Repeat. I was afraid of this reaction and sold some of my trading stock yesterday. I will be buying back now.
What happens to these shares if the dividend isn't re-instated and what happens if it is and the company now longer has that extra liquidity?
"I'm also shorting this. After earnings the stock will get cut in half. This is the next JC Penney with their debt mounting. Bankruptcy by next year. People are not buying clothes except online at Walmart, Target or Amazon."
Several retail stocks announcing earnings before bell and several after bell tomm. My feeling is they pumped this up to buy cheap puts and to short it down on bad earnings.
KSS reached a 52 Week low at 44.31
"KSS is a $44. Stock until they can improve Earnings/Revenue!... only reason it's bouncing around, is Trump's Lying Again about talking to China!Time to Dump that Orange #$%$!"

Interesting read just now - Nordstrom's accepting Kohl's and Macy's returns.
"Board is ALL spam, what a shame"
I hope they do well but the stores near me are very quiet. Not many people and the jewelry counter has almost nothing for Valentine's Day.
Sell - we will buy.
Bye Bye $47.'s!
Its like a fire sale at this level- I wish I could buy more
Potential Swing Failure - Video at STOCKTRADEVIDEO (Google them) - KSS
They took out the weak-hand SHORTs from this morning. Went short at $17.88
Back to testing new 52 week lows again!
Everyone laughed at my $12.65 Price Target!
"and look at today, already down huge in premarket"
7% down. What’s going on after blowout earnings
KSS is down 4.94% to $76.19
Good time for KSS to deploy those buyback dollars and pick up some shares now at this level.
$KSS 30 by Oct first week
"The short position declined again significantly as of 6/1 down to 25.4M shares from 28.1M in the prior period. So shorts are covering at these lower prices, which is a good thing as it is signaling a likely bottoming of the stock.It will be very interesting to see how much stock the company bought back by Q2 earnings, they would stop being able to buy back sometime around the end of middle of July. Add in how many shares the shorts likely will have taken off the table, it should put a pretty big shrinking of the float on the table. That means good news should really help the stock out perform and good news will be anything but another downward revision to earnings."
"expect another sharp decline if JCP misses as well. If not, then there is some hope here...."
Opened up a short position here today. This should be $5 now. Single Digits coming. Hop on board folks.
My wife and I just went shopping at KSS last night. Very busy. Prices better than Walmart and Target and Amazon with a far better selection. Bought lots of clothes and wife a new purse and stylish jackets and super sexy pants and tops.Analysts are wrong about KSS.I read Jim Kramers books and he states the retail analysts are mostly in Manhattan and only shop at luxury stores like Sakks they probably never step foot in a KSS and wouldn't caught dead in one. They a snobs who never even been in one.
Kohls is the new Model
They are late declaring the dividend for June. Looking back at last 2 years it was declared earlier in May. Take a chance on it at almost 5% yield right now ?
Lucky for us we have such a large short position that at some point actually does cover. I wonder how much lower some of them think this can go when it doesn't.

This is what an earnings beat looks like?!?
"Man Rae - I suggest accumulate now. Yes, if the market takes another dump and we get a double dip, you can lament that you didn't catch the bottom as it returns to $13 or $15. I doubt it gets anywhere near that low again. Reason? We are definitely NOT closing the economy again. If Biden wins, the Democrats will shift from we gotta close down to bend the curve to, we gotta stay open to keep people collecting paychecks. I expect the US and global governments to print as much money as it takes to reflate economies. Do not under any circumstances buy bonds as you are locking in at the peak in price and the low in rates. When the Feds have to start fighting inflation in 5 years, bonds will be crushed. Stock in strong, well managed, and profitable companies is KING. Buying at these prices is a gift."
Still a good time to buy KSS?
"""Kohl’s Trounces Expectations for the Top and Bottom Lines"" -- gotta love the headline followed by the dip..."
Ok I’m just going to be honest here. I’m not a bear I’m actually bullish. I own Nordstroms currently. It honestly makes no sense for Sephora to open in kohl’s a lower end retailer versus opening in Nordstroms or say a Bloomingdales. Just doesn’t make sense. Regardless this is great news but seriously
"KSS's drop in stock price today is a prime example of the baby being thrown out with the bath water. KSS had good numbers, yet it's being treated like Macys. The retail analysts will be a day late at defending KSS, but they will differentiate KSS's numbers from the others in the group, and I wouldn't be surprised if KSS gets upgraded by many of the firms by early next week."
"Dividend paid,cut or suspended...pay date today anyone please???"
KSS partnership with amazon have a positive effect during all this?
@Lauren As I have said before you and awesome stocks are both full of $!!!. Yahoo stop this free advertising.
Didn't they beat earning top and bottom?
"Why would Amazon want anything to do with this? They can buy Sears right now for pennies on the dollar. Kohls is headed the way of JC Penny and so many other Brick and Mortar stores. They just can't afford their rent and related expenses. They might have had a good Holiday season, compared to terrible numbers the year before, but this boat still has a major hole in the hull."
Buying. 200 @ 51.75. Betting that this will melt up throughout the day. And yes I like the divvy.
Whisper numbers said strong Holiday sales and earning beats.. I am glad I added 300 shares today......
"If you think Kohls will ever hit $60 again, you should take a few hours and read the old boards from Sears, and JCPenny...They were always bargains...all the way down to $2.00Even a ""successful"" place like Nordstroms is on the long slow decline.Delusional to think Kohls has some magic formula to buck the trend.Just how far and for how long do you think Kohl's Dollars are going to carry this thing?They don't have all those ""daily"" needs like Target... and they for sure aren't getting into groceries.Unless they pull something new out of the hat, they are in decline, and so is the price."
Shorts gonna get smashed. Wait for it!!!
"retailers down big on tarrifs today, but when deal reached, they will have a bounce back that we will never see again in our lifetimes."
stock market are so high it's on drug and smoking some strong weeds
Think we could see 54 before Nov 19 earnings !!
Easily $30 by sept
"Wow, I'm all alone and rich!!!!"
"Sorry longs,but even I will admit you are getting hosed heavy at this point."
"you short suckaaas are gonna get waxed then burned, so Don't Cry when it happens!!!!!!"
This could be the next GME short squeeze.
Do any of you ACTUALLY shop at Kohls?

FANG stocks are very overbought while stocks like KSS and Macys are heavily oversold. Macys and KSS stocks hit the hardest because of covid will rise the fastest.Like today we see them rising as FANG plunges. It is inevitable! Normal cyclingVaccines are real and they work and will indeed end the covid crisis soon returning life to normal for KSSand Macys. Back to consistent profits with far fewer competitors.Macys says $10 billion of sales bankrupt competitors can be theirs to pocket. Lord and Taylor gone, Penny gone and many, many others leaving the strongest one left like KSS the biggest department store with 1158 stores in every state but Hawaii to prosper and grow taking up the sales of the dead retailersPeople I have news for you, there are several vaccines in final stage 3 and will receive FDA approval via emergency status in just a few weeks. The government has paid to have them mass produced prior to their approval so when they are approved in a few weeks they can immediately be given to millions of Americans.Trump has even boasted this just recently in news conference. IT is real people. This mild flu is really not harmful to most healthy Americans and most don't even know they had it and now have immunity.Naturally it would end anyways as most get immunity. Already I estimate 100 million Americans already have had they virus and have immunity to it. This why we are seeing Covid peaking and declining in all states.Deaths are falling fast too even without a vaccine.Russia and China both have vaccines. Russia is planning to approve their vaccine in less than a week and mass produce it with their plan to give it to all Russians in October thus ending covid totally in Russia.China likewise has a vaccine,The Swedish let covid run its course naturally without shutting down schools, churches or malls and restaurants and they saw a huge peak that quickly dropped to nothing. Now Swedish have completely defeated covid by allowing the natural immunity of covid rise in its citizens until it cannot spread anymore.Daily deaths and new cases are nearly zero in Sweden. They are no longer required to social distance by recommendation. LIfe is normal in Sweden. They had the least economic impact. Nearly all the harm to their economy was caused because of the shut downs worldwide causing a decline in their products worldwide.Expect soon a heavy loss to those holding onto FANG stocks and and see soon a move into stocks like KSS and Macys. The biggest winner of the next 12 months."
"I need a new spring top ... I know, get on your Hazmat gear and let's go to Kohl's!"
Burn shorts burn!! See you in the 60s and 70s soon
"I have a suspicion that AMZN did not do very well this Xmas as respect their retail operation compared on a percentage trajectory basis due to a lot of chatter on the web of not finding many good deals on the site. There are also a lot of chatter about the convenience of in store pick up. If that is the case, AMZN will certainly be looking at bric and mortar acquisition. AMZN, do you want to expand to fashion and big appliances where touch see and feel is so important?, KSS has has this stores you can remodel to sell you gadgets, fashion, big ticket items. AMZN, do you want ease of access to your store?, KSS has over 1100 off mall location. AMZN, do you want want drone delivery?, KSS has over 1100 off mall locations perfect for rooftop drop operations. Also amazon, the GOP tax bill just gave you a reason to do more capital expenditures to your advantage."
"ah, poop Missed the buy at $37 after two years of waiting. Oh well, back in the trading range 36 to 43."
"These numbers really aren't bad like the headlines are trying to indicate. Last year, Christmas included 4 full weeks of sales and this year it only had 3 full weeks. This might be a 1-2 day drop, but this company is still strong and the stock will be alright in the long run."
Shorts are gonna get hammered hard !!
Why would activist investors even invest in kohls? Its like investing in JCpenny. Companies operated by apologetic soft serve babyboomers who have totally lost touch with traditional American values and will drive the companies off the same cliff Sears and Kmart went over.
Looks like we can get to$55 before earnings report as I postulated here
Satnam you tell more lies and come up with more nonsense that I can stand. Your muted.
"KSS not pretty, either is $TGT... or $WMT. ACRX is up 12%, and climbing, ACRX 200 percent upside based on the average analyst's Price Target"
@ $20 it will come back
Was $60/share at beginning of this year before covid hit. Excellent holidays sales 2019Will be again in at end year.
The world doesn’t need kohl’s. Short
I just love this game...big players slowly raised the price last week knowing fully that they can do it as the volume is low so they can get more bang out of their short position...then 3 weeks before earning where the company cannot stop the decline due to lock-up period they DROP the hammer! I just love the game...increasing rate and fuel prices will pressure the consumer period!
Look at Cash Flow. Bargain at this price.
thinking of buying this stock. Retail pain has probably been baked into price like el dente pasta.
"Wow, this is a nasty drop. Is it justified is the question."
CEO was interviewed on CNBC closing bell today 11/17 check it out! First guest on today.
Methinks retail is going to rally tomorrow. It's about time.
"So same pattern as we have seen several times over the year on a big market up day when the ETF's and index funds should be moving the price up it gets taken down to show a loss and then likely volume, most likely short covering, continues through the rest of the day."
"Stoxx brought this up but there has been heavy shorting of XRT whose short position increased from 18.2M to 26.7M. Interestingly Sears also saw an increase but Macy's and JCP both saw covering. So there is a lot of ammo for short covering as these huge index throw in the towel. Likely that will take more than Q4 earnings but a rosier 2018 outlook which we likely should see given the strong economic growth. Nominal US GDP increased at over 5% in Q4 in the US, only a spike in inflation dragged the number down to the 2.6% print. That spike was likely caused by the increase in energy prices, should those level off, we should see stronger growth numbers coming in 2018, especially with the tax cut impact adding to growth."
"I feel as though even if earnings, comp store sales, etc turn out favorable for KSS next week, shareholders will get hosed anyway. Always happens with this stock. Good company, but nothing is ever good enough for the market."
"For bottom fishers, the stock market seems ripe with overly beaten down stocks, especially cruise lines, airlines, and discretionary retailers. Crazy that KSS has sold off as much as cruise lines. KSS seems like the best bet for a ""V"" recovery. I also like RCL. Airline stocks scare me. Yes, airlines are more vital than dept stores and cruise ships, but airlines struggle to be profitable in good times. The best retailers (and big employers) like Kohl's will scale, adapt, survive, then thrive."
Dumb shorts keep it going all the way to 30
What is KSS hiding? In their year-end financials they no longer disclose what the net credit card income is. For years they did. Now they will not disclose it. Why? How much of their profits are from customer finance charges? What are they hiding and why?
"And oil at 12-15$ shows people aren’t driving, oil down, markets up makes no sense..."
down she goes!
Shep...Just sell your Kohls stock and buy Amazon. Kohls will be dead and gone in 3-5 years.
Wall Street is busy investing in Kohl's and not $amzn.....go figure!
$51 and climbing!! Burn those short shorts!!!More money and more money to come!!
Kohls stock is overbought and overvalued. Even at 20.00 it had a huge p/e. I just shorted. Will cover at 25.00.
time to buy more!!
Fed and government are helping companies who had been giving negative result for couple quarters on the cost of good ones....................KSS hasn't been profitable..........
is Kss giving refund for return amazon items??
"Joe/Greg/Rob, you guys are trying hard, voicing your negative opinions, but it’s useless. There may be down days ahead, but the tread is overwhelming up. Go long while you can. You can still save face and your ~100 bucks."

Maybe we can negotiate with Russia to have it used here too?Now is better than waiting for the FDA to approve a USA vaccine in October."

Kohl's reached a 52 Week low at 35.18

Love Macys store! A winter wonderland filled with unique high quality dreams ready for immediate gratification.
When do the all the department stores release their Christmas numbers?
KSS reached a 52 Week low at 30.77
"why is KSS dropping while the market is doing so well? I see some other retail is gaining OLLI, TGT, FL...any thoughts?"
I bought at 38 a few years ago and just sold a couple months ago at 70. I’d definitely get back in if it’s gets to 38/40 again.
"Well with Target warning it looks like the sales slump in Nov/Dec was retail wide. That is a positive for Kohl's. A retest of the recent lows should be in the cards today, let us hope they hold and then Kohl's can rebound and hopefully lots of Amazon returns in January turn into a stronger January than people are expecting."
KSS KSS KSS KSS 
is it possible for KSS to go back up to $65 anytime soon? Some investors are saying based on past patterns this will drop back down into the $40's until summer time and unfortunately I bought in too high for that. Any thoughts on this?
I wouldn't be surprised if they soon issue new bonds at current competitive market rates and retire the $600M 9.5% bonds issued last spring. big interest expense reduction
"the party is over for the time being, are you ready for the huge drop?"
Is this a good stock to buy now for the short or long?
XMAS should be good for retailers short term.
Didn't mean to upset you longs. Sorry.
so would most people recommend a HOLD here? Thumbs up or down?
Is JCP news really a surprise? Ridiculous that KSS should go down on that news. I see big upside in pps coming here..

What happens when the balloons pop?Well, then KSS looks incredibly cheap - Right?Watch it is going to happen too."

I sure hope it is amazon buying Kohls shares before a buyout. Wishful thinking anyway.

Throw all common sense into the wind! The master manipulators are best at brain washing!Safer to bury your money!
The market is destroying all of retail today for some reason. Maybe this is the final shakeout?
"Kohls is doing Everything right, should be at 27 SOON, Bye Bye short suckaaas!!"
"I hope you all sold today. This is dropping below $20 tomorrow morning. Kohl’s is dying. TJX fills the need. Amazon is killing their sales and using their real estate and a free warehouse, having the much better end of the deal."
I was hoping they would go pick on healthcare or consumer staples for a bit but it looks like they are back to hammering retail.

Neither long or short. I have posted here from time to time over the past couple of years. I used to trade KSS between $35 and $45. I will wait until that happens again if it does. I can get better dividends in the oil sector. Funny nobody wanted KSS when it was $35 and now up an ok amount. Now nobody wants oil. Hmmmmeee. I will buy what nobody wants. Wish you all luck.
"I need Jeans, 33 x32 . only store to carry odd waist size.So I bought 2000 shares ."
Sorry all I had to pull the trigger on this one today. I got out where I was averaged in at. Good luck to all the longs here I think patience will pay off. It just looks like it will be a slow ride. I went with what i thought was a stronger stock in terms of quicker growth. Thanks for having me and letting me participate.
Up she goes again and again....! Boo-yah!!
Too far too fast
I can't wait to go shopping again!
"With the strong cash flow, dividend and stock buyback, the question becomes can Kohl's stabilize earnings. Is this roughly 20% drop in earnings a trend or a one time realignment of the environment. If Kohl's can stabilize earnings next year and continue its $400-$500M buyback the stock is worth a lot more than todays prices. Q4 earnings will be key as we can see how bad earnings are deteriorating once we have a full years comparison. The buyback is generating a lot of future upside, so that is a good thing. Currently the buyback and dividend yield are well north of 10% and that means a market multiple of 15+ is warranted on trough earnings. The question now is what are trough earnings?"
Should have warned like M did in Feb . . Would have blunted today’s reaction and of course management had to see the miss coming .
KR should buy Kohl's .

"It is expected a third vaccine from will soon be announced highly effective too which will be the easiest to store , manufacture and distribute.Then the USA will have 3 highly effective vaccines against covid.At 95 percent reflectivity rated this means anyone who gets the vaccine is essentially immune.That will end this problem very quickly."

"It is the end of the month.Institutions tend to dump losing positions.Explains moves in HD and TGT as compared to KSS today,which is better in terms of valuation."
Very strange! KSS probably worth no more $20/share and at $56 now. Run as fast as you can
"stores sales /on line sales will be 62% / 38%,so kss have huge room to up to $162,, AMZN have huge room to down to $1200, because kss have been became #1 department store,Macy's fell to #2."
Do you think they will announce that they decided to sell to Amazon tomorrow?
It?s funny how when the stock goes down everyone hates the company but stock goes up it?s a ?well run company? lol. It?s still the same #$%$ company it was a year ago. Nothing has changed. Every #$%$ companies stock has gone up.
Walmart and Amazon to ban all the pillow guys products too! He is unamerican! A NATZI!
The only value that Kohls has is their real estate holdings. They are following in the footsteps of Sears.

Yes. I just bought lots of merchandise from KSS yesterday. The store was packed in the middle of a week day.That is great. In fact it is always busy. I love their store. My wife just bought some nonstick pans there and she is always excited pointing out how nothing sticks and without any grease or butter. All the family goes there often.
"Solid and slightly better than expected earnings results:Dividend was increased to 67 cents beating my 65 estimate.Bottom range of guidance was above my estimate.Bought back nearly $400M of stock and upped buyback to $400-$500M.Reduced debt by over $900M.Cash down from last year but they bought back shares and debt, so very solid positive cash flow.Depreciation down $30M but CapEx down even more, so net untaxed cashflow from Depreciation nearly $400M (those are hidden earnings that will turn into earnings over time as Depreciation drifts down to CapEx levels).So better than expected. Let's see how badly the stock gets raped. Analysts have some earnings to upgrade, that is for sure."

"This is the first time I did not make money on my KSS options trade. At 2 pm yesterday I knew, I would not get to close my target of 55, but was able to close at 54.6. I had a chance at the beginning of the session to close it at 55 but passed on it. I did my combo 2 weeks ago, when KSS was 59,buying 10 of 61 P, shorting 15 of 58.5P and 10 of 56P. I received a credit of $1,000. That means if the stock closes at 61 and above, all will be worthless and I kept the $1,000. At 58.5, I will make an extra $2,500. It was pretty good on Wednesday closing at 60.3. Then KSS was hit by a bomb, dropping as low as 53. At 54.5, my 61P was worth $6,500, but my short, 15 0f 58.5 was worth minus $6,000 and my short 56P was worth minus $1,500 resulting in loss of $1,000 which was offset by the $1,000 credit I received at the beginning. Because there was a little time value left, I had to do it at 54.6 to completely break-even."
"Just bought a few cheap shares. Over reaction, imo."
"shep, you are going to get burned on your short big time. I would cover. The only thing that can save you is some big October market surprise and I think Trump making nice with the dems took that off the table."
"I have brought this stock at 15.40 and shorted this stock at 21, I say trade this stock a lot, the floor is 15$ if it breaks that it will retest it’s March lows. Just wait for now, their will be a better buying opportunity right now I’m bearish, but when the stock has dropped enough I will go back in and buy shares."
KSS has a different customer base than Macys. The decline is an example of either stupidy or obvious manipulation.
Value investing model may not work when demand is artificial low and near panic conditions abound- some would argue kohl’s is a value trap like the oil service companies and reits?
Is big gain pre-market because of the new in store beauty offering coming this year?

Kohl's was a favorite mentioned on cnbc power lunch today. apparel retail is expected to be to be very robust in coming months. people are finding that their pre-covid clothes simply don't fit. they are needing a whole new wardrobe as well as workout apparel
"The buzz of Kohl's going private is starting again. I don't think it's necessary because as other retailers close (JCP, Kmart, Macy's, etc...) the traffic will be picked up by Kohl's thus improving margins. There is also buzz that Lululemon Athletica Inc. may be getting Square footage in Kohls which would be a game changer."

"Why was my post deleted? I said I was neutral on this stock, and said I can’t see people running into any retailer and trying on new clothes, when they don’t know how long this virus lives on clothes, I’ve traded this stock brought it and made money and shorted it and made money, I think it will go back to 13-15$ price range in the next 2-3 weeks. It went up too fast too quick, a pull back is imminent. Can’t see people going shopping and trying on new clothes when they don’t know who wore the clothes before them, they still don’t know how long this virus stays on surfaces."
"More scare tactics by the corrupt shorts and media. 325 million people in USA, 140,000 dead from virus. For those of you that got 4th grade level math after 12 years in public schools, that is 0.04% death rate from virus. Now consider half the deaths were from nursing homes. That take the percentage down to 0.02%. Now consider that 98% of those deaths were from people 78 years or older. Is an economic shutdown by the Democrats worth it, or is the reason more devious this close to an election? The remaining 324. 93 million people still alive are still going to shop at Kohls......buy, buy, buy."
"Analysts have taken up earnings estimates significantly, it will be interesting to see how Kohl's performs in comparison and how much the tax cuts will impact future earnings. They mentioned $250M in cost reductions so that leaves them ample room to boost wages, they also talked about how technology is making their labor force more efficient. So I think we might see quite a bit of that tax cut fall to the bottom line. As to further buybacks, they are also reducing inventories by 10% in their downsized store strategy, that will free up more cash for that, so they can continue to buy back significant amounts of stock this year."
"Market will be down today, it MUST BE, per the MANIPULATORS and thief Funds."

"Why the shorts remain short may rest on the fact that net earnings fell 22.3 % for 2015 compared to 2014 and another 17.4% for 2016 compared to 2015. I am long KSS and I rejoice every three months too but the shorts must be beaten with better earnings and not just better EPS orchestrated with strategic buy-backs. KSS is a good company with an excellent workforce. They are reducing costs but retail is brutal. I don't like Amazon. They are users. The TGT, KSS Best Buy companies provide the customer with the opportunity to physically inspect and test a potential purchase and then the customer runs out to Amazon and makes the purchase. I suggested to a KSS manager that we experiment with a store that only has three garments for each size and multiple dressing rooms for trying on the garment. See follow up..."
Good earnings
Morons are jacking the price up again. Time to short again.
kohl's will be running the monopoly board when this is all over! I'm banking on it!
Kohl’s to close non performing stores in 2020.
Possible $30 stock
"This is painful to watch, but way overdone. The shorts desperately want to break the $50 barrier in order to cause another panic sell. If it can hold $50, this will start to creep upward as investors accumulate to get on board for the June dividend."

Time to short these morons again. Headed back to 15.
SELL SELL THIS LOSER!!! KOHLS CEO IS A LOSER!!!
"Can anyone confirm whether there will be a monthly retail sales report tomorrow? I remember seeing this somewhere last week, but can't find it now. I want to buy KSS, but I know the report will be horrendous and expect retail stocks to drop when it comes out."
please dont spread negative news ...please please
KSS exploded and I missed out because I wasn’t listening to the great folks over at (http://Fairstox.com). The next big winner won’t miss me. Don’t let it miss you either. Join them now.
Went to Kohls this weekend and there was literally no parking available. Had to park at TJ Maxx and walk over.
Haha - I’m going to be laughing at shorts soon. Do the research it’s going to beat lol
"False narratives being spun by Wall Street to dump the markets, if recession was a concern why would companies like Clorox, P&G, Dominion Energy, GSK and other consumer staples companies be tanking as well?"
KSS is ready for a breakout upward.Technical analysis combined with fundamental analysis confirms this security analysis.
Tryed to vote to support management on PROXYVOTE but won't let me vote saying control nr. no good. anyone else having trouble?
"Well last time stock was way up in pre-market and then got crushed during the day, maybe we get the opposite this time. In any case the report was quite good. Revenue up 4% and margins improved, that is all solidly good news. If they can repurchase 4% of their outstanding shares this year a market multiple is warranted for sure."

i think its time to buy
"Pretty clear Gerhard is long and Blanton is short and opinions are like !!!holes. Everybody has one.KSS will survive as most of the other retailers are going broke.Most folks like to feel and try onclothes, not look online."
I wouldn't be surprised to see kss end up by the end of today.
"DO NOT BUY KOHLS TODAY ,, manipulator is running it down!! THEY COUNT SHARES !!!!!!!!!!!!!"
we going to have trouble getting over $40?
"Yes, since last Friday it was up by 25% +, today it is 9% down, no big deal as eventually it will go up and up towards 35+. Buy more if it falls tomorrow again."
Looks like KSS wants to head to the 49 area.
"Well two days of trading so far where there is some hope we have found a bottom. Now it will be up to the buyback and the short covering to move the stock back up and of course the dip buyers. Unfortunately the market is turning negative as well so it may be a while before we rally off of these lows. Watching the short position early next month will be key as we can see if they are covering yet or not.There was also a good video on the myth of the retail apocalypse today, it is worth watching.https://www.marketwatch.com/video/why-there-no-retail-apocalypse/7738C50B-9C19-4248-AEAB-85243EF343C2.html"

While the USA is still in stage 1, 2 & 3 testing on 30,000 people while Russia will have vaccinated its whole population of hundreds of millions and have created a safe and effective vaccination that they are mass producing enough to supply the whole world.

Clothing storm’s demise? Lol I will bet against that.
"I’m still amazed at the number of shares short relative to total outstanding. I’m not sure what exactly the shorts are expecting long term, but all I know is this: They continue to keep paying the dividend while it continues to increase annually, EPS continues to grow due to performance and significant buybacks, balance sheet is getting strong every quarter as LT debt is reduced, which is also reducing interest expense, the Kohl’s brand and market share grows as competitors either fold or reduce their physical presence, the partnership with AMZN will ultimately benefit the company by increasing store traffic and sales, right-sizing stores and renting excess space to complimentary/convenient retailers (Aldi, Planet Fitness), etc, etc, etc. Please tell me what’s not to like about this company. Yes, there is certain risk inherent in the retail sector, but it’s not going away anytime soon, and KSS is as strong as any retailer out there, as they appeal to the largest class of consumers with popular and moderately-priced merchandise. Am I missing something here, shorts? Or do you just like to keep on paying that dividend as this company grows stronger and stronger?"
"Shorts were roasted today, but wait until KSS posts great sales and earnings in few daysand then there is the FDA approval announcement of the covid vaccine in just a few weeks from now.The shorts financial statements are going to be crispy critters."
A few weeks ago I said this would hit $20 then go down to $13. Looks like I was right. I also said I wouldn't consider buying this until $5. I think I will also be right. When JC Penney files for bankruptcy it's going to scare a lot of people and across the board retailers will sell off.
"So by all accounts I have heard so far the holiday shopping is going very very well. As to Kohl's and the analysts, well that isn't going so well as we can see by the stock price. A bullish analysts mentioned margins and the reason for the poorer margins seems to be the increased cost of on-line sales. So ironically as we go more and more digital they are not seeing that as a bonus for survival but rather as a hit to margins. All is not lost as earnings are quite good. So far this year we have produced $3.38 in earnings (taking out the debt charge) add in analysts consensus of $2.15 which Kohl's must beat and we are looking at $5.53+ in earnings for the year, even better than I thought. The big problem is 2019 where analysts see only $5.77 in earnings and they are actually taking that number down lately. So ironically if we have a good 2018 and beat significantly all we will inherit is more earnings growth compression. As is analysts are currently looking for earnings growth of 26 cents on a $5.51 basis, so roughly 4%, all of that would come from the buyback no less, though I don't think analysts are supposed to factor that into their estimates. In any case, with a buyback we are talking 8% which warrants a 12 P/E and with the bump to earnings from a buyback would get you nearly $6 in earnings and a $72 price target. So the key issue for next year is can Kohl's outperform on earnings or, after Q4 earnings, significantly raise the baseline on earnings as we may well see 2018 earnings north of $5.70 after adjustments for the debt buyback. So that is basically what analysts are seeing and why they are lowering their price targets, this despite an earnings beat.So it will come down in 2019 to earnings growth and what this management team can produce. If all they can do is 4% the upside is limited. If they can get to 6% and continue to buy back stock aggressively with all of that cash flow, well then a 15 P/E is again warranted. Also, there is the possibility that depreciation expenses start dropping and start to boost the bottom line. As I mentioned they have almost $400M of hidden earnings power, if they continue to buy back shares and depreciation drops down to CapEx levels over the next 4 years that is another $2 in earnings power which alone is ~8 earnings growth a year. So if they can produce 4% from the business, 4% from the buyback and this 8% from reduced depreciation we would actually warrant a 24 P/E on $5.53+ in earnings or nearly a $140 stock price."
If they plan to make any money on e-commerce they're going to need to get their act together a little. Our recent order of 5 items came if 4 different boxes on 4 different days. How efficient and profitable can THAT be?
Up over $ 4K on Kohl's in the past 13 days including the dividend. ( $ 935 ) Looks like I'm keeping this one for the long haul.I needed more dividend paying stocks and this one will fit right in with my portfolio. Go Kohl's.
it was up a. nickel Friday has to consolidate now at lower levels before it rallies another nickel
Any reason for this being down 3.5% today. It only gained 1.5% yesterday in the rally but this easily erased any gains. Any downgrade I'm missing?
"im taking my profits, Kohl's ran as far as it can for now, buy back at $27"
"At least $5,000 of hacked Kohls Cash at in the Kohl's inbox at Mailinator.. Why release it for all to see instead of using it? Maybe because they are outside the US?"

"Interesting bit on Amazon laying off employees, especially in consumer retail. This might be a signal that they are looking to make an acquisition.https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-laying-off-hundreds-of-employees-primarily-in-consumer-retail-report-2018-02-12?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo"
"I don't own KSS, but have GPS and HD as my retail stocks. For what it's worth I thought KSS's numbers were GREAT. Now I'm nervous GPS could beat top, bottom and same store sells, raise guidance and get crushed. This is crazy. Was not planning to buy KSS (Nothing against it, just have 2 other retails), but dang earnings was excellent it feels like mid 60s is a bargain.If you can stomach it, I can't see selling KSS now..... P/E is 12....."
Another overreaction.
Money flows will enter during the last hour of trading...KSS will be north of $40 by the close.
"Up on low volume and a market up day. So I think unless the shorts want to short more, they will have a tough time keeping the stock price in check. It will be interesting to see how aggressively the company buys back shares this year. Will it be $100M a Q through Q3 and then $200M at the end, or will they take this gift of a stock price and front load it, thus making it easier to make their earnings estimates."
Can you stomach the truth? Few can boast the awesome track record of LIONSTCOKALERTS (look them up in gooOgle) .
I guess KSS did test that big sell-off low of 46.02. Will it hold?
Overkill. Buy the dip.
"Had the same deal with JCP, did wonders for them!"
Kohls is a fantastic store !! Everyone I know loves to shop there. Sorry that some folks want to play games & post Fake News on a big up day for the stock. Obviously this stock is breaking out & going much higher ! ! !
"Wow, Kohl’s stock has tripled in price in the last 6 months!"
Holding steady on a down market day is great news for longs.
like yesterday up then hammer time
OMG! Take advantage of these free trade ideas. Just go to (http://buystox.net)
"Kohl's needs a new CEO, this #$%$ is a chemistry student, not a Retail manager. unbelievable!!"
"Does anyone know what percentage of stores KSS owns? The 2019 Annual Report on p. 38 has $7.3 billion in Property and Equipment. Value Line estimates the annual leases are about $275 million, which seems like a modest amount, give that Kohl's has about $19 billion in annual revenue."
"down market and it might have been priced in but i didnt think so...great results, hopefully good growth model and we will rebound on a market's good day...stupid stocks"
You are full of s!!! John. Wait until after Xmas @$60
Looking like even more volume today than yesterday with double average
KSS up $2 in premarket trading
"Really regretting not selling those Jan 2021 $85 calls when the stock was at all-time highs. Would have been a nice profit to ride out this downdraft in retail. The reason I didn't was that I couldn't get $15 for the call and I think in 2020 Kohl's will have the earnings to warrant a $100 stock price based on a 15 P/E. Will see whether I am right or not. So far their pre tax earnings growth rate is quite good and if they can maintain that over the next few years and buy back 3-5% of the stock a year, I think that $100+ will be there before Jan 2021, especially if the shorts every stop shorting this stock."
Hi again. Neither long or short but just visiting. I traded this a couple of years back. Bought at 36 and sold at 44 back and forth. Nothing has changed since then. KSS often hits a low in October. If KSS does not get that low then congratulations longs. But if it does I will be in at sub 40.
Shorts are gonna get waxed and caught in a quick rush. Stock is down too far relative to Dow.
You guys have to learn to buy low and sell high. sheeeeesh
RSI now at 85 on the 20 day 5 min...nothing normal about that. Clearly they are running this up so they can short it back down. This has become a pattern since the FED started buying stocks. You can MAKE A LOT of money spotting these bogus trends.
Short short short
"Sell off overdone, imo. I believe kohl's will be a survivor and actually thrive from the closures of other stores. I just started a position."
"Shorts can't wait to sell every day, bunch of cohort manipulators,,"
"BK for J Crew, Neiman Marcus, and now JCP. Will all be food for KSS long term, but the news of these other BK’s punishes the stock price in the short term. Hold on everyone...."
"Last low of $48.72 will most likely be tested now or after ex-div., after that support really drops to mid $40.'s Not feeling safe owning big box retail anymore, thought KSS was different, having my doubts!"
"Good fundamentals, which KSS has, will work out well for longs. Just have to ride the roller coaster."
ENTER................................shorts.......every day.......soon to get burned......................
When JCP and Sears go down it should cause Kohl’s price to jump. People are still buying clothes and housewares - they just aren’t doing it at the dinosaur mall anchors.
Just lowered my entry from 46 to 42- should be there Aug.
we need crystal ball to predict when stores might reopen. otherwise this is untouchable.
"A Manipulating fund is controlling kohls for now, who would sell here with small reward?????"
"Nice pop this morning, looks like the shorts are getting squeezed as the ex Dividend date approaches and they want to bail beforehand."
"So far as to what I can tell through some of the other retailers is that the budget shopper is very strong. Luxury shoppers are flat. Men’s apparel has been the strongest category. Shoppers have taken to the buy online and pickup in store which is about 40% of the online purchases for the brick and mortar store. That figure will rise because shipping costs are skyrocketing. The shipping costs have balanced out the expected margin gains the stores have been getting out of improved inventory management. Customers credit has increased. Stores have experienced gains from the closing of competitors. Guidance has been taken up slightly. Analysts are commenting that retailers may be experiencing peak earnings next quarter and that next year will be down. There is also uncertainty over the tariffs.Macy’s, Nordstrom, Target & Kohl’s are all shifting to the smaller multi functional neighborhood stores. Walmart is struggling with their margins from groceries. Grocery is a good traffic draw but it will never be profitable. Kohl’s is in a show me state. I doubt many of the analysts that follow Kohl’s believe anything other than Amazon is taking over the world. Even if Kohl’s does blow out the numbers next week it is no guarantee that the stock will go up. They don’t see the potential that I see. I believe Kohl’s will benefit from technology in the future. Cashiers are going away sooner than you think. Autonomous delivery will be done before autonomous driving. These technologies will disrupt the retail business model. I think a physical retailer will couple with Amazon, another with Google and another with Microsoft. As for Kohl’s stock I do believe it’s the best of the retailers for what that is worth right now. It’s still up 70% this year, still a lot of profit to be taken by some so we might see some more weakness. I will sit back, collect my dividend and wait for this to play out and add some more on weakness. This is what I did with Amazon stock once upon a time, when people had it, I love it!"
had to cover my short near the open right while it started to take off. ill have to wait a little while before going after again.
"17,500 shares traded premarket so that price is just some idiots panic selling."
"You know, many stock analyst don't make much more money than a guy working at Costco without even a college degree.If you believe everything they say, why not go to Costco and ask the box boy for stock tip?Warren Buffet has often mocked the calls of stock analysts. He says they often call a sell at the exact wrong time and a buy at the time you should sell too.He has lots of experience with them. If he doesn't listen to them, neither should you.DO THE OPPOSITE if you want to be successful. Don't be like them, working for others the rest of your life.I don't have to work for others anymore."
"Here you go shorts...debunk these: The case for bears are the Amazon Effect and Retail is Dying. Here's my take, I know the Amazon effect has been overblown as this company and other has upped their omnichannel game, proof Walmart. Retail is NOT dying, it slowed down after the great recession, but it has been picking up due to the economic upturn. KSS bric and mortar off mall location is their jewel..Amazon can use those locations for displaying their ever growing fashion products, ever growing gadgets, ever growing inventory/fullfilment center and the additional space that KSS provide will help in reducing transportation cost, their quest for technology to show off their wares....proof...Amazon bought Wholefoods and they are opening more and more retail book stores. Amazons plans for drone operation and Kohl's stand alone off mall locations are perfect for roof top drone operations..plus the growing cash flow, etc. etc."
"So a couple of points you might not have gotten from the earnings news:The trend of lower depreciation continues, that means this year earnings are boosted by $25M so far.CapEx is up significantly this year due to the construction of the new distribution center. So far this has cost an extra $127M, so roughly $100M in lower profits assuming they can deduct all of this from their existing expenses.Net income is down $55M, which isn't nearly as much considering the first two quarters of the year are weak. Strong Q3 and Q4 sales could easily make up for that. Further, we know that the increased CapEx most than accounts for that. So if Kohl's had not built that new distribution center, they actually would have had net earnings up $50M, not down.At the end of this year I assume this new distribution center will be generating revenue due to increased on-line sales. Hopefully they will also be able to shutter the smaller centers if the on-line demand isn't as strong as they think. That means to me that 2020 will see CapEx decline significantly, depreciation should also continue to decline, further boosting 2020 profits AND with a sizable share buyback that should get us back to some serious EPS growth."
"I think we will get a small bump down tomorrow, its ok with a bad report, but the sh price has already been held back for it, small bump down thean the climb, every quarter will improve 3rd quarter onward, to king of the hill kohl's will dominate all the other stores doubling its last highs ! thean the dividend! 1yr and 2yr will be huge! buy the dip tomorrow!"
Come this hot long summer sellers will take loss and drive into 40sThen look.
"Excellent buy, how swiftly this company turned digital and online. Remarkable. Do you know how much cash Kohl is sitting on ? 2 billion dollars, excellent working capital management. Today results are all praise. It fell probably due to an conservative forward looking statement due to COVID and weakness in Walmart stock. This quarter nowhere mentioned of any bankruptcy situation"
What an ugly close. Maybe CNBC Cramer is right. KSS buyers are degenerate gamblers?
A lot of bag holders at 18+
positive by EOD - 55 by EOW
I see that mike guy left and took all his stupid comments with him. $40 bucks on its way unless the market corrects which I think it will but I see nothing under $33 from here on out.
The consumer is spending like mad. All evidence indicates a strong consumer demand for the foreseeable future.

wow everything I read is how kss is failing
Yah I thought it was a decent report. Inline. Of course everyone must sell all retail regardless so it’s down 7%.
Interesting how my posts that have some indepth analysis keep getting deleted. Yahoo must be short Kohl's.
"in Brooklyn New York, kss and m and GPS very busy, but their earnings reports not good, sales decline,why?? I think other places sales very bad, and maybe they reduce price too much,because on line too cheap,plus clothes sales not good, clothes sales will continue decline, because world's population decline in covid19 disaster, most of women maybe don't have baby next year,so these stocks m kss jwn maybe down75%,"
Dropped my entry point from 44 to 42

"When cramer said ""don't buy"" two months ago I dove in. My only retail holding."
"Huge increase in the short position in the last 2 weeks of may by nearly 3.2M shares. Given the stock price so far this month, likely more shorting as well. That sort of volume will definitely impact the price but on the positive side will move it up as well.In the end all the shorts are accomplishing in the long term is allowing Kohl's to buy back their stock at a cheaper price. As long as the business delivers, that will eventually result in the shorts demise."
Boycotting Amazon yet? You deserve losing money on Kss then.
shorts keep selling Im a buyer got to be a winner and a loser Im voting up to $47 day end
"Anyone been in a Kohl's store lately ? I have and they were very busy, I am not a shareholder but I have to admit I am intrigued in the price There are not a whole lot of cheap good companies in this market."
"Wow, still did 2.4 billon in a Quarter covering feb-April. Looking positive from here as this qtr will have only had a few days in may with stores closed. Most of the pain already pushed through. Love it."
$KSS Rising with good volume. Bullish indication in Stochastic oscillator and RSI. http://www.stoxline.com/stock_chart/KSS.gif
What really hurt was providing no guidance. punished by the street.
Wonder if the Amazon buying JCP rumor is a decoy for the acquisition of KSS? KSS isn't getting any rumor love though
"If they go under, so will everything else. We’ll be be in a depression."
How can there be no bounce. This is an illiquid stock. Should see relief move up after panic selling subsides. That’s how the market traded for decades.
Any thoughts? Shorts here bringing it down again? Good buying price?
Going into next earnings miss this Pig should test $43.'s easy!

Time to sell
Trump won't let a big Wisconsin employer like Kohl's go out of business in this election year. There will definitely be stimulus money for them to get through this. Trump needs Wisconsin badly and has the ability to loan billions

KSS reached a 52 Week low at 29.71
You got to be happy to hear the 24% growth in online sales. That is huge. JCP Sears Toys R Us failed in this aspect and we see what happened. Kohls site is very well developed much better than walmart and can rival amazon as far as the clean look and flawless filters.

NO!
KSS is down 9.79% to 17.78
Kohls stores are a dump. Went in there for an amazon return and they rried to sell me their trash with a coupon.
this %÷@& stock is killing me. but way too late to sell now. but shoot me if I add to my position.
my new favorite store is now king of the hill! king kohl's!

I shorted this and surprised at how low it’s going. Most likely 5-6% jump tomorrow. Will prob buy in the lab resell tomorrow
Like I said this stock moves back to the 20s as stores reopen. OVERSOLD.
Kohls should start selling some food. maybe help Amazon be pick up for essentials

Here comes the plunge from the plunge. Hold on tight.
$60 a share if Amazon wants to buy Kohl's.
short short short
"Unfortunately for Kohl's even a market bounce isn't going to help, they held out as long as they could, guessing Lowes or Home Depot will buy their stores!"
"Drip drip drip, well at least the shorts aren't going to town based on the last filing. Hoping that retail sales in January did well so that we can get a rally into earnings. I think they actually didn't warn to badly and we might well end up in the middle of the original earnings range, so basically the warned no upside surprise, but no downside either. Q4 will let us get a good look at why 2019 was to bad compared to 2018 and I think that will be telling. Hopefully it was just a ramp in CapEx and an increase in depreciation that did the damage, we will see."
KSS is a great company with huge potential now that things are back up and running. This has to break 40 very soon!
Does anyone know what high yield etf and mutual funds do when a core holding suspends their dividend- like kohl’s? Is the manager required to sell the shares?

9+% haircut certainly seems extreme. I'll hold and keep collecting the divvy.
$KSS Reiterates Bank of America Buy USD 30 » USD 36 Target Raised by Credit Suisse In-Line » Neutral USD 23 » USD 30 Upgrades Gordon Haskett Hold USD 28Maintains Deutsche Bank Hold USD 19 » USD 28
"Support around $59.63 before they start closing stores, then JCP all over again! Good Luck with that!"
Cancelling my Kohl's Credit Card.....shopping and politics don't mix... I did shop there alot but not again.
"It is interesting that you would see a downgrade with the very strong retail sales report today. Clearly Q2 is in the bag and the only question is how strong will H2 be. I think H2 is going to be even stronger than H1 actually, so being bullish on this stock is still spot on. Earnings this year will come in north of $5.50 and with a market multiple this stock is clearly still undervalued.Personally I think it will take Q3 earnings to make this clear for analysts and a sign that the company is more than willing to buy back shares if the stock sells off. The last few days have not been good but given the rapid runup not unexpected. I think we likely test the pop over $70 as this would be some logical support as it used to be the 52 week high."
Book value $35EPS $4.50
All retailers HERTZ GET OUT

That div is looking mighty nice after this haircut. Good entry point.
wonder why this is down when market is up...
Just got a hot tip from (http://stocktip.xyz)
Overreaction
Hello 42. About time even if it is for the wrong reasons.
they raised 2019 outlook too
"For the life of me, I don't know what's keeping KSS up. It kind of reminds me of LK without the fraud of that Chinese co. You go into the store and all you see are senior citizens cashiers so, what's going to happen to them when they open?"
I was at $KSS today and I was overcome with Gass.
I hate it when people post misleading information that cannot be supported by facts! Tell us more why you think what you think instead of throwing some claims and get other newbies stuck holding as we all are.
Is KSS eliminating their dividend? Yahoo Finance summary shows 0 dividend!
Kohl's is up 6.38% to 62.40
Sales up 0.1% from Nov/Dec down 0.2% shows that online and Amazon returns worked.
"Glad dumb folks like you longs exist. Makes smart folks like me a lot of money daily. I do kind of feel bad however, they are really giving you guys a beaten! Considering how every other stock that was beaten down by COVID had a nice 3,4,even 5 bagger rebound since then poor KSS never quite popped. With Covid rearing it's head, July 31st the $600 unemployment stimulus ends....people won't have money to pay bills let along to shop for at KSS!"
$$ EXPR @ 1.30
"Well it looks like they shorted another million shares prior to earnings. Given the stock performance since, I think it is likely they shorted more after. The last two days we also had the ToysRUs liquidation news which likely also lead to more sector shorting. So odds are fairly strong we will see an increase in the short position when the 3/15 numbers are reported later this month. With 26.36M shares short now and a 168M float we have about 194M actively traded shares. As that expands with more shorting the stock price tends to drop. If they cover and as the company buys back shares you get the opposite effect. We likely will be prisoner to the sector shorting till it stops unless we get positive news. So I think it will be a bumpy ride through Q1 earnings at least and likely through Q2, at which point the yearly numbers should be realizable and Kohl's low valuation becomes clear."
What is going on in the last hour or so? Why the sell off?
80 stock maybe 90 good buy now.
Amazon asked board of KSS to by millions of KSS stock. Why does Amazon want to buy millions of KSS stock?
"@ Jack Bauer, try harder. You can do it! 7 spotted? yeah right! thousands shopping online myself included. Target cut to $26 from $45. If ever it is true, of course! Corona did not spare anyone and how is Kohls any different? There should be a decrease in target after corona right. KSS was $44 before Corona??? Common sense! With J crew going bankrupt and JCP next in line and with Macys right around the corner Kss would come out stronger eliminating all competition. Most people like to try on clothes before buying and Amazon is getting smarter. I have seen merchants on Amazon charging $1 for merchandise and $10 for shipping so when people return they lose $10 and the merchant will cover the original shipping fee."
Robust green by day end!
Bought another $100 on-line to help the cause...
"Here come the bag holders, this stock is getting cut in half to 10.00 bag holders."
KSS will survive and maybe thrive in the future. But there's no point in buying its shares.
KSS up $8+ in the last 5 days. When will the profit taking start? Today or Wednesday?
$30 soon. No way the results were bad. It easy to beat next quarter being pessimistic. Super bullish.
Imagine that . on a day the market is down 3%...
"Way over valued, bought"
A few hit peices in the news that is keeping a lid on the stock price. I suppose there were folks who were whipsawed by the sharp rally.
"Given the dividend of $2.80 and the $4.40 mid-range of their guidance 12-14 multiple is likely in order, so mid $50s is fair value at a minimum."
"Credit Swiss downgraded Kohl?s to natural from outperform this morning for tougher 2018 as they say !!!Don?t sell into this garbage, Morgan Stanley did the same #$%$ to Macy?s yesterday and it didn?t stick the stock rebounded right back upKohl?s gonna crush 1st quarter numbers on the 22nd"
this rally wont hold...3000 phychological
Would like to see this close at a new HOD 20.73 area
Onslaught of selling coming to an end.
$KSS Kohls is a victim of suddenly renewed Trade War Market Volatibility & Uncertainty on top of earnings miss. I have never imagined to see Kohls selling at this price level
Lol!!!! I bought 5000 in April in the $13s!!!!!!
Glad I sold off the rest of my position at the top. Grabbed 22 strike puts.
"Another fodder to the takeover or partnership...Kroger is teaming up with Alibaba for their technology and capital. Also in November, the 2800-store Kroger announced it would roll out an apparel line. So Apparel? Food? You can't sell apparel at a grocery store, but you sure can sell grocery at an apparel store. Kohl's open space is available...get Kroger to lease 30,000 sq ft. at Kohl's and stock it up with groceries and include their apparel line, let the customers pay thru the Alipay platform and it is a win win for KSS, KR, BABA. By the way, it would be the quickest way Alibaba gets to the US market. Of course, this scenario forces AMZN to block and must buy or partner with KSS. Can you hear a pop coming?"
"Don't buy kss ,, virus scare will drop it !!"
"Remember when there were those big buildings with parking lots full of cars, that you could go in and buy stuff? And it wasn't groceries. Hmmmm, doesn't seem that long ago."
this store is always empty and u can just go to tj max and buy better name brand apparel at 25% discount
KSS is down 16.52% to 48.75
Neither long or short. Just been dropping in from time to time over the past two years saying that this will drop back below $40 as it was a few years ago. The trading range that I used was $36 and $44. See you there.
Store closings soon!
Money flow turning down......retrace to 28 to 29.....that the entry point for the next leg up
i just did serious research on this co. and every thing will be just fine
"the space is down big today so if we get a market down day tomorrow im thinking this will tank even more tomorrow. there's no dividend, there's nothing to protect it. chart is a big downtrend. see if we can take it down another buck or 2 this week."
"KSS looks very interesting at this level. Strong sustainable dividend and with JCP closing of stores, you can’t go wrong"
Six months ago Kohls was a 38. +stock I think that is more like reality !
"Kols has revamped there online marketplace and is offering Kols cash to pick up your online order in stores , KSS nice buy for quick holiday payout"
what the??? according to Barrons they totally blew away guidance... and it tanks? why? feel i should gobble up some more shares at open....
Very impressed with Kohls preparation to allow e commerce to exponentially grow their business....last year they made advances with just in time inventory delivered by UPS....This year they have built more of the business around that concept to protect sales with further expansion into more brands and unique items in kitchen/housewares
Kohl's is down 7.87% to 55.51
Going back to $11
I heard about KSS the other day on http://tradenow.xyz. It’s looking like an interesting play.
"When i.went into my Kohls, huge lines that.almost wrapped around the store but linebmoved quick. Some discounting but not much. Actually less than usual. June sales will b a blowout!!!"
We are trading ex-dividend today.
Will the coming ex dividend date support the stock price?
Soon no one will want to sell KSS! Bad news for shorty! You shorts will have to pay premium prices soon!
"Dang, look at this rally. I was looking to see if it would go down to $16 or below, so I could load up on more."
Amazon knows to compete in this modern world in retail you MUST have a huge presence in brick and mortar!That is where most of the retail sales are at NOW and in the Future. That is why Amazon approached the board of KSS and requested permission to buy millions of kss STOCK.
its gonna fellbe carefully
"Lol!!!! I paid $62,000 for 5,000 shares in April. They’re worts $288,000 today!!!"
Kohl's is up 6.40% to 60.41
"DON'T BUY Kohl's over the Holiday, a manipulating fund drops it to make you feel bad for Holidays, why ? because they are PUTRID and it will run up after Holiday sales are released."
Muahahaha how does it feel shorts!
If they deny they are buying this garbage company.the stock will jump 2 points
"I don't get it. This panic buying and selling for no reason or even worse the wrong reason. I bought more this morning and will on any pull back. If it drops to the low 36 level, it is load up the truck time. Sheeeeesh."
"Il be jumping in next paycheck, kohls is huge in Wisconsin."
"Parking lot 1/2 full, people returning Amazon items. Recovery - NOT"
jcp kss no difference
We have 80!!
"New investor , but long time customer. I buy all my clothes at kohl’s . Only store that carries odd and even waste and length sizes .Stores are clean .Everyone I know loves Kohls .Shares trading @ 75% discount is unbelievable ."
How do you feel now mr shorty?
Up up and away! 60s next stop then 70s!
this is better than a vaccine stock
Some dude said he saw a junkie shooting heroin in front of doors to closed KOHLs store. Sad!
"Considering Macys and JC Penney in really bad shape, eliminating competition, Kohl’s will come back with a bang once the stores are allowed to open. I can’t think of any other stores to shop other than these three mostly. Most People like to try on clothes in person. Besides kohls has a huge online base sales too."
get into tech stocks forget retailers. AMD about to explode upwards.
"If Walmart is warning of a sales slowdown ahead and higher labour costs, then I think it will be tough for retailers like Kohl's."
"Amazon should buy Kohl's. To get a foothold in the local distribution of groceries, Amazon bought Whole Foods for $13.7B. Kohl's is the right-size and right-location retailer of just about everything (except groceries). Buying Kohl's would almost immediately give Amazon an improved distribution network, still predominantly online but with just enough physical locations to capture even more market share. Amazon is already using Kohls for returns. $14B for KSS would be about $90/share -- double today's price (but only $7 more than KSS was in Nov 2018). It's a win-win!"
bad rsults be carefully
5 hours agoThey are late declaring the dividend for June. Looking back at last 2 years it was declared earlier in May.Take a chance on it at almost 5% yield right now ?I posted this waiting to make sure they didn't plan to skip or cut the dividend !!
It is all about the trade war. Seems like China has an upper hand and US is capitulating.
Wow up $1.09 per share this a.m. Glad I bought last week. GL ALL LONGS !!!!!!!
Why is KSS getting spanked today?
Why haven't they cut dividend at least 67%? No sure why they haven't done it already.
Trump Lies! Trump Lies! Trump Lies!
Hello Panic buying.
"Kohls is fun to go shopping at with very stylish and modern décor with the latest styles at exceptional prices.Relax and enjoy watching your money double, triple and quadruple in the next year.Nice return on your investment!Fact is 75% of all clothing sales are at brick and mortar stores. Just like some will never fly so the same is true that most people will never buy clothes online."
Going back to $50! Last one in loses
Sitting short on 10000 shares up 12.4k and not sweating a drop in the AH. You longs get hosed weekly.
Time to sell Amazon and buy KSS and M.Online sales down. Brick and Mortar retail clothing sales up 105%Facts are facts people.
"Why doesn’t anyone listen to me, buy in at cheaper prices if you wanna go long, 16-17$ will be a good price range to buy this and go long, the markets as a whole are now having their next leg down, it’s not a correction or retracements it’s going to be a w shaped recovery not a v"
"Fair value $12.67... see JC Penney, Sears, Kmart, Shopko"
Beat on all aspects and goes down. This market is a joke
CEO of KSS said she is committed to paying a dividend and will restore it after this covid nonsense is overwith. Expect stock repurchase program restored too meaning an handsome income annually and stock appreciation as each share becomes more valuable as total shares outstanding declines.
$20 end of week next week
News leaking about store closings could not be helping today! Yikes!
Kohls is coming back and so will the good dividend in the next quarter.
Looked at the Mutual Fund and Institutional holders and found that Vanguard didn't have the sense that Fidelity has in not buying this worthless junk.
Dividend to be announced in days!
Gap at $21.60 needs to fill. Expect a retrace to that level min. Smart investors cashed out yesterday.
go shop at cabelas for your revolution ware!
"I think Amazon will make an offer before the end of Summer . They will add food products , much like Target does. That will stop shutdowns due to pandemics ! This is a WIN -WIN for shareholders !!!!!"
"no stopped Kohl's, funds are buying big and they can push Kohl's as high as they want,ceo too!"
Retail overall is at buypoint especially M and KSS. Institutions will be seeking the good dividends as well.
They're just keeping the rating because they own a bunch and know this company is headed toward bankruptcy. nobody shopped here BEFORE covid 19. This is a DUMP STOCK.
$50 soon?
Im invested in nordstrom but when i saw the news im happy for khols shareholders! Good job
I am neither long or short but this is stupid. I was buying this at $36 a year ago and left at $44 with 5% dividend. People back then were dumping and now they are paying up with what for upside potential and much smaller dividend? When will you learn to buy on bad news ergo buy low and sell high.
Any thoughts on what might happen to the Amazon-Kohl's partnership if Amazon purchases JCP? I'm assuming returns would be handled in JCP stores instead of Kohl's which would reduce foot traffic for Kohl's.
KSS Kohls goodbye lmao
"Oh my. The last time that I bought KSS it was $36. I traded some between 36 and 42. Sadly I did not hold past $45. I warned you all when this stock was at $70 that it was too high but all of you said ""This time is different"". Well I will be keeping an eye on KSS again and when it goes below $40 I will be in again. This time I will hold longer and collect the nice dividend."
"So it seems somewhat clear that Q1 for retailers was a bust. The question is why in a strongly growing economy? I think the enemy of the people, mainstream American news organizations, did a wonderful job scaring people to death about their tax refunds. I think hearing all of the stories they put up about people having to pay more taxes, in reality only getting smaller refunds, likely scared a few people into waiting till they finished with their taxes before spending again. The reality is some people were impacted negatively by the Trump tax cuts but that mostly fell on the well off in high tax states. Something voters have been clamoring for by the way for quite some time. Raise the taxes on the rich, not the rest of us, which is what Trump's tax cut actually accomplished. It is rather ironic that the rich under Democrats get tax breaks, like those in high tax states who are able to deduct their state income taxes. So unless those states have a very progressive tax rate, rich people actually get a refund on their state taxes while the rest of America has to pay the full amount due to the lack of their deductions."
#$%$ about Macy's they said its going bankrupt people need to realize that the management doesn't just sit there and say we are going bankrupt they will do everything in their power to stay alive. and plus kohls is at not at risk of going bankrupt and I made a 100% return on macys before and ill do it again with kohls
Taking 100% profit here. Will be back if it pulls back. Good luck to everyone.
"Sad to see sheep led to slaughter yet once again! Take huge profits, China's Tariffs are about to hit the proverbial fan!"
What time is report?
Historically peaks big on mediocre news then sinks fast. Take profits now and reposition at 24-25Kss has peaked until next earnings. Just my 2 cents...im out.
"Again, needs a transformation"
Yvanka should open her own boutiques and forget about other stores to liquidate her products.I bet she'd be successful.
"Won’t be surprised if this company post some earnings this quarter. I been in multiple stores over the last 3 months, alway the parking lot it full and you have to wait in the long casher line. So excited to see the earning tomorrow"
"3 out of every 4 Kohl’s (1,100 + locations) will have a Sephora shop at the entrance of the store by 2023. Big opportunity for additional revenue. Analyst Price targets will be raised very soon"
Way overdone here....guidance remains within range....same store sales down the same as Macy’s.....irrational reaction by market
"Amazon has #$%$ poor customer service and gets Kohl's to run interference and how does that pay off? Going out of business sale. Let us all bow to the monopoly, one department store at a time please."
"Definitely a buying opportunity, can make a quick couple hundreds tommorow"
MORGAN STANLEY GAVE THIS A SELL RATING WITH A $15 PRICE TARGET YESTERDAY----what's that all about???
Pullback tomm from profit takers then keep it rolling
A well orchestrated short attack on retail stocks. Time to accumulate.
not sure why its up so much today but I will take it 
"KSS is a buy and hold long term stock!Great company, and the dividends and stock buyback programs will be restored after this nonsense is all over.This stock price is gift! Watch your money double, triple and then enjoy the restored dividends and hold long termgetting richer and richer each year.A must holding for any portfolio!"
Wow that was bad. HD and now KSS
Kohls is like the tsla of retail.
COVID is going to be worst in the fall folks and the big guys are taking their profits and will wait until then. They are losing money and have a lot of debt
Overeating. Will be close green. Time to buy
"While it is clear from my posts that I am fairly bullish on Kohl's over the next 4-5 years there is likely a reasonable risk of a recession on the horizon that could and would throw a wrench in that. The unemployment rate has now ticked up two months in a row and few people may realize this but the unemployment rate almost always bottoms ""before"" a recession hits. So it is a leading indicator unlike what some say.So there is potential for a recession, however I still think Kohl's is well positioned for that. It's competitors, like JCP and Macy's, likely not. Kohl's has moved the next sizable debt payment to 2023, so they have ample room to breath if sales should collapse. I really don't believe they will in a recession because I don't think the next recession will be a big impact on employment. Much like 1991 and 2001 I think the next recession might contract GDP some, but it won't do much to employment."
Shortys need to go long! Wow are you missing out on the next rocket to financial freedom!
Kohls been open for 3 weeks now....and it's a G H O S T T O W N....
Here we go again with the trade fiasco with China.
"Days of browsing at your local kohl's trying to spend $50. to get Kohl's cash back are over, free cash flow is gone, last I checked nothing in Kohl's is considered essential items! Buh Bye!"
These crooks oversold ps5’s to thousands of people just to cancel 24 hours later
Problem is about the change that these active investors are proposing. good that they are active. but the proposals like1. Reduce inventory- will cause less availability. People will buy from Amazon 2. Reduce choice- one of the worst ideas.3. Real estate- now a days it’s junk value with online sales4. Change promotion- JCP tried so many times and got crushed.
Roaring back already.....up $1.00 from morning low...........Big money making more money.......out of fear.
looking st stock. Does it only go down?
"Some support at $44.28, then next support at $42.03!Should be slow drip lower all the way until next earnings release, and if they miss again $37!"
Kohls is the rare brick and mortar retailer that has a great business model. Stock is going higher
Over a billion dollars in cash with a quarterly 50m loss due to covid. You know it's a buy.
I trade KSS weekly...ups and downs and I'll tell you fools now...if you didn't cover today you got greedy and can expect max pain tomm
Oops 5500 I meant
Potential news release on Monday about vaccines. Accumulate now. Should pop towards end of day. Do your own DD!
the next quarterly will be much much worse!
"Kohl’s, Macy’s,Nordstrom, Dillard’s,JCP combined market cap of $19 billion with $79 billion in sales. TJX alone market cap of $62.5 billion with $39.5 billion in sales."
"Avg P/T is 28 and change, KSS lost money last quarter and will not do much better next quarter. The company held out a carrot and said that it will re-institute dividend during the first half of 21 but hare investors stupid enough to believe the dividend will be what it was at around 2.00? Maybe .20 will be more like it next year. Watch this stock drop like a lead balloon once Black Friday numbers are issued. Not a good time to be buying retail. Stock will be back below 30 next week."
Thanks for the cheap shares. I’ll be in buying mode real soon.
Jeff Bezos understands this too and SOLD $7 billion Amazon stock!You better do the same. He bought KSS with some of the money.
Be aware of Head-Fake. Will head under 15 by Friday. Don't get sucked in. SELL...SELL...SELL
"11M shares that would be about 800,000 short shares covered, plenty more where that came from."
can't ever hold any gain. It's over unless Target or JCP buys them out
"Kohl's got wayyy ahead of itself,, should move back to 24-25 ,"
Finally green atleast for a bit. Needed this.
"I can't stand retail stocks that aren't Amazon, Walmart and Target but the chart just looked too good here."
Hang on because this will run after stimulus approval announcement
get out from this stock ASAP...
"Nothing KSS does is ever good enough for the market. Dividend hike, buybacks, earnings and sales beat......"
"penny traders go home, let KOHL'S Run, this should be at 26, if not for you!!"
10 coming
KSS is down 10.29% to 15.25
Kohl's up $4.00 on Monday morning due to fantastic rising Holiday Sales !!! Go KOHL'S!!!!!
Wild ride into earnings
Good ol bear raid OVERSOLD
scant hold any upward movement whatsoever
KSS is very capable of earning $6/share profits next year with record sales far exceeding morbidly ridiculous expectations!That would be a forward PE of 16 and support a share price of $100/share!
Book value 35.02 that says it all.
"I think the biggest negative here is that management will have lost credibility. They guided up after Q4, so why now a guide down below last year even and this with an aggressive buyback. Did things really change that much or are they again sandbagging for themselves. Goss made a hefty paycheck last year, not sure she earned it."
"Ouch: Total spending amounted to $403.9 billion, with the biggest factor in the downturn being a collapse in clothing and accessories that amounted to an 89.3% fall from the same period a year ago."
$KSS needs to add some pizazz to get people in the stores. I’d suggest Arby’s or Chick-fil-A pop up stores or carts rolling around during meal hours. Need to do something. Also maybe a poker room in the back near the ladies lingerie section.
as Sears closes more stores I wonder where a Sears shopper will go . . . give me a K
Must have been bad ! OUCH
I am missing my old post. I am into KSS and JCP
What if they cut the div.........or just cancel it all together ? Then you can panic..........
"This stock has been hot, looking like it could regain pre-covid numbers fairly quickly. Is there a good dividend ?"
"Kss is only way is up, party is over shorty's"
KSS reached a 52 Week low at 22.76
$KSS Website balky on my iPad. Only had 3 tabs of porn open.
I picked up 2000 at 13.25. If it gets back below 14 I’m going to buy another 3000. They will be well positioned to take market share when Jcpenny and ascena group go under.
i bought it at 16 I thought I got a good deal now I don't know will see in a few months
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kohl-apos-kss-0-6-133001823.html
This is a dead bird whose wings are still twitching. Don't think this is a winner because it went up today.
Santa Claus Rally!
"Sales per store open day were above 2019. (25% days closed, only 23% lower revenue.)"
Down in pre-market due to Macy's poor earnings report not because KSS has bad news.
$100 stock by mid December
IT will be too late to buy KSS when Amazon announces its plan to buy KSS>
Shopping season is here.
"Before you go off shorting stocks or buying them you ought to do a little consumer research for yourself.If you did, you would realize that the reason clothes sales plunged dramatically recently isn't because people have no money and cannot afford clothes and am concentrating on essential rather it is because historically most and the bulk of clothes sales have always been at in person brick and mortar stores that have been closed. People instead of buying online clothes simply stopped buying clothes waiting for them to reopen so they could buy clothes again. Most cloth sales or 75% have always been at brick and mortar stores and the bulk of all future clothes sales will always be at brick and mortar stores. Amazon thus is at a disadvantage in this respect and will NEVER be able to compete in this market without brick and mortar stores."
Christmas is coming! Buy! Buy! Buy!
My local $KSS looked like Beirut in mid December. Stock out of basics and messy. Not impressed. Short.
Retail downnnnnnnn
"The PPS is all over the place. If this is not manipulation, I don't know what is."
This could be a 50 dollar stock in a year. I will hold this a long time.
KSS is down 6.89% to 45.98
"Woot 3rd worst S&P stock of the quarter, we rock!"
Went thru the parking lot at the local Kohls here in E. Green Bay about 10 AM this morning. About 25-30 cars and about 100 seagulls.......Kel
what was that spike? saw it across a few tickers without a matching dow spike
Ex-Dividend Date 2017-12-01
Did you shorts really think that you would drive this company into single digits? C'mon man... Retail had been beaten down so much already. You're going to get burned...
KSS is up 4.90% to 75.07
KSS reached a 52 Week low at 32.41
Kohls giving all margins to Amazon but counting it as their own. Kohls will need to shutdown stores as fast as possible. This is going to $28
Way overdone
"Keep selling please, would  to add at way oversold prices."
"Short position was down 300k, so more covering which is nice. The smaller the float the more likely it is to go up. I think they will give cautious guidance for H2 even after beating again in Q2, so the big rally likely has to wait for late fall. The holidays are going to be huge this year as the tax cuts and maybe people realizing that they will get even more money back with the child tax credit boost should have money flowing for the holidays."
"this kitten is purring, but it will roar. strategic retail locations. their partnership with amazon should give them good insight on what to do. I say set up some starbucks or dunkin donus at their stores to improve cost structure and appeal."
Probably getting my hopes up for this rally over the last several days. Just waiting for the shorts to drag this one back down.......
Ex-dividend drop - too harsh in my opinion. Time to add more.
will buy at 35
s and p acting frothy. I like kss but I see overbought conditions rn
What’s bringing Kohl’s so much down? Any thoughts?
https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/retail-sales-november.html
"remember this, they will beat on Tuesday, good luck everyone"
Does any one think Amazon ultimately has plans to buy Kohl's. I originally bought Kohl's when Amazon started the pilot with Kohl's with the thought that perhaps Amazon would buy Kohl's to get into brick and mortar retail. I've been selling covered calls on Kohl's but don't want to get the shares called away if Amazon puts in a bid?!
KSS will be up 10%+ tomm..
in 1 yr this company will be the greatest buy anyone could have! don't miss it!
all retail has opened in Ohio on the 21st of may
"Don't listen to anything that ""4mvp"" says. Earlier today he/she asserted that the Kohls store closure was extended to July. This is obviously a lie."
More stores opening May11 news on the wires
Don't you guys see it breached the cup and handle $17 range?
This is going back to $40
"Cramer and Co ran this up now they're ready to short it back down. Wash,rinse,repeat!"
will it hold 40 this week. We will see doubt it
"I don't own KSS, but there is a huge line outside Kohls for pickup...I thought I was the only one going to pickup. Holy moly, I guess people need some new sweat outfits."
"I don't get it, please explain. Anything I buy at Target or Lowe's I can get from Amazon. Apparel, however, I need to try on to see how it fits, and I need to see the color to be sure it go with my other clothes. So why are Target and Lowe's comps up and Kohl's comps down? Could it be the quality of the MGMT?"
"I give up! Everyday, another analyst downgrades. Wish they had issued all the downgrades at once. This slow trickle of bad news is not helpful at all. Only thing saving us now is because KSS has become HTB."
So much for buyers coming in for ex-div. Monday! What a Pig!
just added 6k to my short! cant wait for the stupid robinhooders to pull out the Christmas money and send this thing back to $25!volume way down the last few days!
Buy KSS for Amazon Prime Day sale. Will be lot of traffic to Kohl for return.
Bought a starting position in Kohl's today at the close. Will add tomorrow if we go below $36.75. I think we might be close to the bottom for now.
green is possible
"Kohls is dead money for now,, buy at 24-25 ,, sell like crazy at 30 @!"
Oh boy dividend yield increase 7 per cent is that right? I'm thinking to take this stock.
Buy 100% KSS at this price. JP Morgan Chase & Company 4.7 % invested. jP Morgan don't play with money!
stores are always crowded here in NJ
Burst comes next. It’s been a bubble
Who is selling here? What is not priced in at these levels? People deserve to lose their money if they sell
"So freaking p'd off that I'd cancelled my $14 and then $12 order to get it at $10 and then it went to $10.89. Now up 30%. GD it! Zero chance I'm buying it now. Missed this frki'n rocket. Good job longs, and good luck. I'm outta here."
Yeah Im sure that activist investors are business savvy especially since they aren't smart enough to not invest in kohls.
"Why would you buy a retail seller brick-mortar_KSS- (mainly) in this market, when there are plenty of good capitalize companies out there? Like ABBV, MRK PF, etc. We need pharma and Bio's to get out of this pandemic and not retail company that are very risky..."
KSS is up 6.82% to 24.58
A lot of dumb people on this board. Will go up
Kss stock wont be this cheap much longer! Get it while you can!
"So some positive news on the short front. Roughly 300k shares were covered by the end of November which means that any shorting post earnings has been absorbed and covered. That means we should have support at our recent lows and likely will rebound over time as the buyback eats up more shares and hopefully a stronger holiday season than expected lets Kohl's deliver on 2019 earnings and guide up for 2020. So ~19.7M shares are left to cover, which is a significant reduction from last year, especially if you add in the roughly 10M shares they also bought back. That should have more than absorbed people wanting to bail on the company."
"Just listened to an interview on Yahoo Finance with Brian Sozzi ( former The Street editor /reporter ) . He had 3 predictions for 2019 , Sears totally done , JCP closes another 100 stores 1st quarter and Amazon buys Kohl’s . It’s certainly a ready made fit for Amazon to expand their brick and mortar ambitions . The cash flow from Kohl’s would literally be able to paid for any acquisition loans ."
"I shopped kohls...got all my Christmas 2019 stuff bought and paid for already..saved thousands!! if all the lots in the adjacent mall kohls lot has more cars by far. always a deal there, my fav store"
"Good earning, yet the SP is down 7% in pre market?"
RTQ $13.05. Anybody going to play for a bounce here?
$20.22 is the top of the 20 day 1 hr. gets there and 23+ may be possible this week. Looks like the FEDS going to help you guys out this week!
Don't you all just love to play this game?
"I have thought to buy more this morning but given it gone negative didn't think about.Sell 80%, keeping 20% ( 400 stock) which is profit only. I think this going to 30 but I just have bad taste for stock market lately and so playing conservative.I still have 40 short $16 put which I think going to expire ( I rolled last week as stock remain below 16) But likely going to expire. This time I won't roll and let it excercise if go below that."
The pre market really got this one wrong.
"i'm surprised especially with DOW, SP, and Nasdaq all up that this is still down...and still lower than it was pre-earnings. What's the deal?"
"amazing the amount of thumbs down my previous comment got, just for asking a question. lmao."
Kohl's reached a 52 Week low at 21.40
Been looking for an apt opportunity to hop in on the Kohls train (ever since that Sephora deal) and it seems to have presented itself to my disbelieving eyes. Cant wait for the future #gains.
everytime this hits $25 I short. Everytime I make $$$
Added to short
"It looks to me like the initial short covering rally was driven by the sector, so basically XRT short covering. Yesterday it looked like a pullback would happen but then Kohl's rallied strong, not other retailers. To me that says the short covering on Kohl's is now starting. With price targets getting raised to the mid to high $80's by two analysts it is likely people won't be to interested in selling before $80. If Kohl's is buying back on the dividend ex date, we could get more follow through. Like I said, this is supply and demand and there is no supply if the shorts are covering and Kohl's is buying back shares, period."
I saw CEO got some award from Fortune. $KSS longs are screwed
lookout below!
Very strong stock. Even with ex dividend day the price does not go down. Amazing
"Last quarter Kohl's had +$606M cash flow. Repaid over $1B debt and still ended the quarter with $1.9B cash. Nice dividends are on the way, sit tight with KSS. A 50 cent dividend would be peanuts to KSS, a $75M expense."
OVERSOLD for anyone looking to buy. Nice shake out before going back up
Buy now.This is like MO.Check my previous posts on Altria.
I wont feel sorry for people when this goes back to $15 and people wish they had sold at $28.
Like whole foods
Looks like Kohl's will be going private later this year.
"CEO announced the dividend and stock buy back programs will be restored after this Covid crisis endsand normal sales and earnings returns.AS I said, the problems that dragged KSS stock down are temporary in nature and one of kind unique which will end as a covid vaccine is distributed. This year we have a longer shopping period from Thanksgiving to Christmas than last year. It also helps that many competitors of KSS have gone bankrupt and permanently shut their doors leaving the potential for KSS to return to growth gaining market share.KSS online business has been put on steroids too. Trumps trade war ends with his presidency.These are all positives for KSS stock."
"Retail sales report was good, in line but sizable upgrade to prior month and strength in clothing."
"Like the stuff John has to say, we all know retail stores like Kohls can't survive for many more years."
"What do you think? Will KSS go way up before the closing bell today before earnings, or will it drop down? It's dropping so far this morning, but are people just trying to get a lower point to buy in? Still expecting good earnings tomorrow?"
More money and more money!!
"So, with potential buyers now lined up for JCP (that aren’t named Amazon), I guess that leaves the door open for AMZN to take out KSS??"
#$%$? Down 6%!
It appears Ms. Jennifer is the latest short troll on this board. I don’t believe a thing she posts.
This is priced for bankruptcy. Not happening. Buy of a lifetime.
Holymcom is here!!!
people dumping for weekend?
"So with these warrants they gave Amazon to basically buy at $70, it will be interesting to see if the company buys back those shares on top of their buyback. Since they would get $70 from Amazon if they converted, they can be much more aggressive buying back shares now. It will be interesting to see when they report earnings just how aggressive they are with the $400-$500M buyback this year."
"I did buy back in for a quick trade when it dropped below 44 but sold once it hit 47, was looking to buy back in around 45. With the false narratives bouncing around it should happen. Now with so much buying going on through omni-channel, it will be very difficult to make decisions about the success or failure of retailers through foot traffic. Look at WSM, 57% of their revenues were through on-line buys. I also believe that shoppers who do go to brick and mortar locations will be more likely to buy than in past years where before they just were window shopping. It should prove interesting to see how companies such as Cleveland Research stay relevant."
"Adding here to diversify my portfolio. Love stocks that drop after stellar earnings. Sorry to the longs, but I am now joining"
Up almost 20k on my short position... thank you!
overbought.
will be down 2% atleast
Wow wish I would have waited for 14% dividend rather than 8% lol
Seems to me the long term outlook for Kohl's is overall positive.
No new 52 week low today! Wow!
Is KSS going to bounce back today after earnings
Down $6. Really?
double ugly report !
"I think the investors are beginning to see the overreaction of Nov 19, starting to come back to their senses !"
Did KSS suspend its dividend?
@John Blanton. You are awful quiet today Mr Blanton. Licking your wounds?
"this is funny, ask any women who shops at kohl if they would pay $30 for a lipstick. i asked my wife and daughter and they said this is a joke. KSS must be paying sephora big bucks to do this because it hurts their brand. my guess is KSS will lose money on this but in hopes of pulling in a different clientele. humm didn’t JCP try this and even eliminate their crazy coupons for a different experience and it horribly backfired. KSS must be desperate. i sold approx 40K and walked away with massive gains. i watch the women in my life and they only shop at high end stores now - this is shopping for fun since they don’t have any real need to shop due to work from home and so many cities shut down. i see a pump and dumb coming. talk to your girlfriends they will tell u what’s up"
"Why buy survival retail. Kohls, TJ Max, Burlington, Bed Bath Beyond and Macys are going to survive (Kohls, BBB and Macys have great online present and have enough online operation that they can thrive this downtrend with relatively limited impact..)1.> Survival going to gain customer from not so lucky.2.> People are so much tired being home and tracking and taking home delivery, issue with shipment/quality/return policy, they finally realized how important physical retail is. 3.> Everyone now know grocery delivery isn't great thing. It cost more money and less control on quality side. Lot of other issues. All those thing eventually help change mentality.4.> Online shopping isn't cool thing to do since everyone doing now. Not big deal there.5.> Hopefully finally they realized that buying from just Amazon online is problem as it killing physical and also at time of high demand, you end up without wanted item as it get depriorized. For example I was going to buy iRobot from Amazon and it would take month to come as they busy delivering needed stuff, I ordered from Kohls (With Discount code and kohls cash I end up 15% cheaper actually) and it arrived in 2 day.So if people buy online from more well known brands, they won't suffer same fate. Right now Kohls doing great on shipping but they don't have selection that Amazon and Walmart have."
Up to $28 in June and now $19. SMFH
You can not keep a good company down forever !!!!!!!!!
people need to quit buying from Amazon before they run all the brick and mortar stores out of business. I for one would never buy from Amazon
"I stopped shopping at Kohl's after they kept changing their return policy. Their ""no hassle"" return policy was the only differentiator Kohl's had to justify their higher prices vs competitors. Now I buy everything from Amazon. No need to even go to Kohl's for Amazon returns as the UPS guy picks up from the front door. Last time I was in Kohl's it looked like a flea market. They had more racks full of returned items than for new items. I knew then that they were on life support....."
"bought mothers day gifts for my wife yesterday at the kohls website, the very next day the delivery is being prepared and shipped! I've got to add a little more Kohls stock tomorrow out of principle."
Triple bottom. The support is nice :)! Anyone else see that huge uptick from 19.50 to 19.84
"So, HD misses and guides lower, but PPS takes off? KSS never gets that treatment. For KSS: Favorable reporting=PPS drop, Negative report=PPS drop, Either raise or lower guidance= PPS drop, Different retailer reports positive or negative= KSS PPS drop, KSS CEO gets the sniffles= PPS drop"
"@John Blanton You are trying very hard aren't you? Good Luck with your short. If you really believe that the longs are in Kohl's because of a possibility of Amazon buyout then you are sorely mistaken, Simply put Kohl's pps has some way to go before it reaches a fair value in my opinion. Rest is all noise that I am willing to ignore till it reaches that price target (~70 or so.)"
BK by next qtr for sure ...no wonder the big drop
"I can't stand this anemic stock, it's so irritating"
Give me my dividend and I will take my profits and move on
"The Kohls I go to is always full of shoppers, store is very clean and employees are great."
Kohls will not survive....its about over.
Sold about 2500 of options from 53-54.5 to 55 55.5 and 56Sold June 18 55 call and June 4 54.5. Option premiums are collapsing. Unless you go out in time. Good luck everyone
i am going in today. seems like we are almost at the bottom. i want to collect that divy. 24k a year and they will at least be around 45$ a share next year.
I love the smell of shorts burning in the morning.
sold at 21 bought at 16 this time I'm waiting for 14to get back in
"I'm just happy I covered my short position around $37.80,this should not be up in pre-market,but it is and so goesthe market,I'm tempted to short it again if it opens at $42but this is now too dangerous to short!Not sure it is a long,guess the best thing is to watch itfor the next few sessions and see which way to go?"
I took some of my 2400 gain yesterday and bought 150 on-line to help my cause. Early X-Mas for me...
WOW! KSS just tipped it's hand BIG TIME!I've just witnessed that KSS is so ready to climb the first chance it gets..
"Dividend increase is nice, guidance for earnings down up to 10% not so hot but given the virus actually quite good. Only number still missing is the stock buyback number, didn't see it anywhere."
"Yup! Expected this with the Idiot in Chief charging Mexico tariffs!When is enough Bankruptcies enough, to know he's a Loser!"
Sold it at $22.69 few days ago. Good luck to those still owning. Make your investment decisions on your own and if you feel good about this stock than ignore all #$%$ that people put in here. All the best guys.
Yahoo cut Kohl's target to $56!Was $60! Retail is dying!
Does kohl’s sell ventilators?
How can this keep going down ten percent every day? Who is selling for losses?
KSS is down 6.52% to 30.38
"Shorts covered 1M shares and the position is down to 18.5M by the end of January. So that is with all of the negative news priced in. The fact that they are covering is a good sign that the negative pressure on this stock will ease, especially if they can deliver a solid result for Q4. My hope is that revenue is flat as same store sales were only down 0.2% in the first two months and that doesn't factor in the growth they should be showing from their on-line. In 3 weeks we will know the score and then the most important thing will be how much stock they continue to buy back and is 2019 a trough year or not."
this market action today is ugly. staying away from kss till we get some good news on CoViD front.
Do you guys ever read (http://Multistockalerts.com)? They just wrote about KSS
If you like shorting at $26 you are going to love shorting at $30. Where do you cry uncle...$35? $40? After the company initiates paying dividends and you have to pay 10% on your $26 short per year?
why is it down?
The force is strong in this one.
"The current market cap of Kohl’s is under $10B, so the announced $2B stock buyback is 20% of their shares. Add this on top of their $1B bond buyback that should add approximately $.30/share in earnings, and we can see that Kohl’s really is focused on shareholder value moving forward."
"Now Dow, S and P, Nasdaq are green and up. Seems like positive reaction for Fed Powell. Time to BUY now. I just added 500 shares. Easy money"
57.5 Here we come.
KSS reached a 52 Week low at 41.93
Bye bye $30... hello $20 :)
"Corrupt hedge fund tells UBS to give ""sell"" rating, then corrupt hedge fund shorts, stock drops, then gives percentage of theft to UBS. Both parties in crime happy. This is how criminal Wall Street works"
"Sell your shares brother your gonna lose money, market makers ran this up it was a pump and dump."
"The open is going to be bloody as the computers will be trying to tank the markets like they did last year after the 4th Fed rate hike, this year they are just using a different excuse, trade war concerns, even though this has been going on now for nearly two years, not sure what anyone expects to come out of this. I know the liberal billionaire's club is hoping a repeat of last year, where they were able to tank the markets going into the holiday season and were able to derail the Christmas shopping season on Main Street. This was done to create the false narrative of a weak consumer and flagging consumer sentiment leading to a potential recession, yet the economy keeps on pumping along."
I am going to buy kohls with both hands. To be honest I am surprise how quickly I able to get stuff from them for 6 different order.I also done pickup order and it's totally safe & quick as well. I am in super hot spot area and this matter. Overall They soon known as eCommerce company. I won't surprise if Amazon trying to buy it.
this is one of the worst stocks. it will fall as the current pandemic continues. UBS downgrade from Neutral to Sell and price cut from 17.5 to 14 is another indication the company is under huge pressure.
Let’s predict when kohl’s goes bankrupt. I’m thinking right after Xmas when they have inventory no one wants. Anyone else want to guess?
"Down in PM? What, because SHLD put out some #$%$ news we get to see KSS price take another hit?"
Whispers that this will crash BIG TIME after earnings - like 15-20 percent. All institutions unloading last few trading days. I still have a bunch long will hold through but not very confident.
Remember: this was $46 the first week of OCTOBER This is no big deal.
"Can someone also explain how to interpret volume? Climbing today quite a bit but on lower volume. Any deductions or conclusions one can usually make based on volume whether moves up or down, esp on a highly shorted stock like KSS? Thanks"
We need to break 22
"One of the reasons I think the recent retail sales report is a positive for Kohl's is because of the strongly negative reaction the market and analysts had to their low revenue growth projections for Q4. Now with this bad December retail sales number that number is starting to look a lot better, no?"
"Kohl's being dragged down by short sellers this morning. Nothing wrong with the earnings this morning, across the board good. Margins still rising. Comps did well compared to strong quarter last year. Cash on hand up $400 million. Bought back 1 million shares during quarter. Waiting for conference call to hear about online, November trend, Aldi and Amazon."
Kohl's Is Maintained at Underweight by Morgan StanleyToday 8:11 AM ET (Dow Jones)
Where is the retracement to? $51.35
Back in the 40s on the way to the 50s! All those capital gains and a juicy dividend too. What not like?
why is this trading at a trailing 12PE? Should be 15?
Guys Kohl’s is not going bankrupt. Hobby Lobby should be the one going bankrupt 
however kss have been bottomed
NEVER again over $17 after today before $15's are tested first.
"Visited my local Kohl's in Green Bay, WI on Tuesday. Numerous racks with ""up to 80% off"" items, mostly oddball sizes of spring - summer men's wear. Even the regular shelf items had big markdowns. Ended up buying a pair of Lee brand casual pants for $9.80. Ticket said the ""regular"" price was $48, but I doubt they ever sold for that price. Probably more in the $30 area. More big inventory charges this 1/4...??Kel"
Congrats guys.....916K jobs created and CDC started loosening restrictions on travel.Rally next week.
looks like premarket is down a bit. I think that they are wrong again. I think that KSS will now slowly climb this large wall of worry. Deeply discounted. Live Long and Prosper
Request comments. With all of these other stores closing would there not be an increase in traffic at KSS for those that want the shopping experience?
How many would be happy if on Monday AMZN announced they were buying KSS for $30 a share? Lots of people paid higher prices then this so I’m sure plenty would want more?
"Short sellers of KSS have every right to be concerned. Using forums like this to scare people is an act of desperation. KSS is an extremely well managed company and has created a niche completely unique. Hard to compare hardware with KSS. Hard to compare TGT to KSS. There definitely is no comparison of M with KSS. Yes, I'm long KSS and one of the reasons is the long list of store closures by competitors like Sears, JCP, Kmart, Bon Ton Stores, Dress Barn, and many others. Payless Shoes has disappeared. As all these stores close it leaves a better situation for KSS. Please don't make up facts to scare people."
Guggenheim security manager said today that this is the opportunity to get into KSS stock.
"Like I said earlier, most of what’s being discussed is factored in the 70% fall, the spurt in online revenue , increased market share due to jcp and other malls, reduction in shipping expenses to now open stores ,new foot traffic of online pickup and amazon returns , $2bn cash, need for store shipping for clothing. All these factors makes KSS excellent in medium to long run as long as they keep debt under control and avoid bankruptcy."
Look at the shares traded and options expiry. KSS will go much higher this week.
What do you guys think about KSS tomorrow? Will trump announcing reopening guidelines have a major impact on KSS tomorrow in the short term outlook?
such an easy buy at these levels
Rise & Shine KSS holders. A nice upward move is on the horizon! I'll take it from there...Averaged down a lot!
Why the collapse?
Put a fork in this one
Look out below.
kohls 13.5b jcp is hardly a billion and sears is no where close. should jcp and sears management take some lessons from bod of kohls
"its always been who you know. kohl's knows AmazonAmazon knows kohl's. just like Amazon needed whole foods Amazon need a store like option for clothing .the common denominator between food and clothing is the fresh,cleanliness and people. no more jcpenney or pier 1 imports or Neiman's j crew and many more leaving a battered but still standing kohl's Amazon will likely pick kohl's for a partner"
I was going to go long M but KSS along with TJX and ROST is best in this sector! Buying 200 shares of KSS for a 2 year hold for a 200% profit
"This will come back today, if not, it should trade up in the coming days. Company is still doing well and improving."
KSS reached a new 52 Week High at 66.50
FDA approval expected tomorrow and vaccinations begin in USA immediately after approval. Canada and UK already approved vaccine and started vaccinations of the public.A large portion of the USA population has already had covid though they are unaware and now have immunity.This whole pandemic has been dramatized far in excess of it's TRUE risk to most Americans.Fact is 95 percent of Americans will have no symptoms or minor if they get this mild flu named covid!
Thanks for crashing the party Cramer.
"they sure go about it in a political way, too. Now they are selling Black Lifes Matter shirts. I know integrity isnt part of the game in the market, but when I bought High a year ago, it dropped and now they are grappling at straws to keep themselves at $19 a share which is sideways for the past 6-8. Thats not a profit. And the dividends are gone. They are pathetic. They even linked up with Amazon and even that didnt get them back to their original price. Pathetic. Not just slow, they are losers, not winners."
"So us longs are sitting on some nice profits off the recent lows and some are likely thinking it is time to possibly take some profits. I don't think that time is here yet because of the simple facts that we still have some serious sugar in the short position coming our way. Q4 looks like a slam dunk for Kohls and the price action is going to be showing that till then. With the massive reduction in the tax rate you can clearly see that future profits are going to be going up, way up. That means a market multiple is in order again for Kohls and gives realistic price targets in the$70-$80 range for 2018, those are strong buy levels baby. Throw in at some point the shorts will significantly reduce their short position down to less than 5% of outstanding shares and you got another massive pop coming. Shorts also need to know that the bots are sniffing out this momentum play and will be adding to the squeeze when it happens. So there is going to be a pop over our current levels, using the % of shares short as a very rough indicator of the minimum we still have to see to the upside on a squeeze. When that happens it is probably time to lock in some profits, not by selling the stock, but by selling 2019 or 2018 calls, all of which will have additional premiums. So your return will be the dividend plus the premium and if you sell deep in the money calls, you have downside protection as well. Even if we hit $75, selling the $50 for virtually no premium gets you that $2.20 dividend (likely to grow soon), which is a 4.4% rate of return. Given that you are waiting from this $57 level, that is really a much bigger return than that on the principle you are risking today, which is actually only $32 and a 6.6% return on that."
I was getting sick and tired of getting creamed in the markets and then I joined this one website I found online and the picks have been awesome. If you want solid stock tips delivered to your inbox all you need to do is go to the-stockdork .
"We got the short position data for 6/30 and it doesn't look good given the recent price movement. XRT was heavily shorted and you can see that in its price action at the back end of the month. Kohl's however saw significant covering yet no big price move up. So either XRT is ruling the day or we have a lot of people shifting out of Kohl's and locking in their profits. We will have to wait for earnings and see whether numbers will be going up again and of course see how aggressively they are buying back stock, so far they are not.It is going to be a long hot summer for retail it seems. We have tested the recent levels of support but it looks like this stock may even decide to retest the 200 dma here if we get any sort of market selloff over the next few months. Bumpy ride to $100 coming up."
Normally I would look to buy a few shares but today may not be the day:Target looks like they're still taking market share....Goldman downgrade..futures down..may hold off for a few days....Still look for a bounce later next week into thanksgiving...
KSS just shot up 10 percent in a single day. Try getting that return from your bank savings account.
KSS is up 4.91% to 64.12
"kss worst time has been over, so buy kss can make huge money, buy under $42 can make double money, kss can going up to $120 per share in 12months. because wages raise too strong,"
Dumb rookie bag holders. See you below 10 after earnings or lack of.
Macy's wrecked the whole sector and the ETF brings them all down thanks to the algos and the machines.
"With the markets likely to correct even more it is likely we break below the $60 level. This will produce some selling pressure on the stock prior to earnings. However, we do have a backstop in that the shorts at some point do have to cover if a stock isn't going bankrupt (if a company is going bankrupt they never cover and never pay any taxes). So while people selling Kohl's isn't helpful, it will get rid of those that are known as weak hands. When/if the rally then comes it will be on a likely smaller float and buyers will have to pay up. As you know the short position has expanded the float so there are more people holding, as they cover the float shrinks, which means there are not those sold shares people can repurchase. All of that should benefit Kohl's in the long run as earnings will cause a reassessment of the company's future. Analysts have taken earnings up significantly and they most certainly warrant the current stock price, so it isn't like we have a stretched valuation here by any means and indeed after earnings people will likely see that this is a highly undervalued stock, i.e. more than 20% upside over the next year."
Good buy at this level
#$%$ This should be several dollars higher. Sheeeesh
any particular reason retail surging today?
What happened to the peanut gallery?
3.7M shares covered by the shorts from 9/1-9/15 which is what caused the pop above $50. We are drifting back down again the last week because they have likely stopped covering for now. So it will take some good news to move us higher and that likely won't come till retail sales data for September is out in mid October. Sub 10 P/E seems a bit low for this company but I think the drop in earnings projected so far likely says you shouldn't expect much more than a run to the 200 dma till earnings start to improve again.
Increasing fast up $2 from 9:45 ..... wonder whats up -
"Rather interesting how analysts seemingly come out with their target and recommendations on the exact same day, though some haven't altered their recommendations for years. Look at LBrands, six analysts came out with upgrades on the same day and LBrands is by far one of the biggest dogs of the retail/fashion sector. So at the end of the day, really, what does an upgrade or downgrade or Price target really mean? Analysts working in unison to drive prices higher or lower to either allow their high wealth clients better entry points or better exit points."
Who says KSS isn't poised for potentially massive upward movement? Not sure how AWE.some.STOCKS finds all these incredible trade ideas but im happy.
KSS is down -4.90% to 58.38
CEO needs to go.
Down near 20% this could be a bit overdone I think we see a bounce tomorrow for now they will just drop the bids to get this lower.
Strong online retailers do not have to worry about looters.
"Should be less than $5 a share soon, within 1 - 2 months.Depression starting very soon with 30 - 40 million Americans unemployed. Thank you CHINA!!"
You longs ready for a reaming again?
Hope everyone has a Happy Thanksgiving with the family and enjoys the Black Friday weekend shopping. Get out there and see what it is like! No way I am standing in line for over a hour though at Kohl's!
"Waiting on a bottom and on a status on how active the shorts have been. The real question we need to know is how many investors did this bout of management incompetence chase away. Next week they can at least buy back shares again, which is likely what we need to focus on in Q's ahead. If they continue buying back shares it is likely they have everything under control, if they start to turn cautious because of the cash burn, well then the problems are way deeper than taking down expectations for 2019 so they won't miss again."
OK guys I am in Bought KSS @24.xx 22 year low
Why suddenly all the retailers Debt have increased so much in this quarter per yahoo finance? Anyone noticed and have idea?
DOW down 200 points. KSS UP. Indication that KSS is too cheap now.Easily a $50 - 60 stock after covid.
"I'm close to throwing in the towel shorting this dog. You cant argue with insane people. You can tell someone kohls stores are empty but theyll say ""but..but...online sales!"". Yeah, ok good luck with that. I will be back!!!"
how does this stock keep going down???
"The Amazon Go news sits right in with the Kohl’s leasing plans. Amazon has been under assault by labor and the Sanders wing about employee pay and benefits. The theory is since Amazon the company is so profitable and there owner in particular they should pay more. Amazon hasn’t gotten so profitable by paying more and they will not start now. But they still need that physical presence to compete with Walmart in the future. I don’t think this is about inner cities or sandwiches. This is about transforming brick and mortar stores to transactional, logistical platforms of third party sellers collecting data and leveraging brands. Those stores that will fit into the Kohl’s leased out areas may be used for autonomous delivery and pickups and returns. Back to the labor issue. With these Amazon stores inside a Kohl’s most of the labor used could be Kohl’s."
Buy.Retail in U.S.is becoming a safe haven
"I am a little concerned about the activist buying up this stock and ruining the price long term. If it spikes, I will likely sell, but I really don't want to pay the short term tax rates (I bought at end of September). I was hoping to keep it long term with a good dividend payout rate base on my purchase price of $18.Before COVID, it was in the 40's. It dropped to the 40's based on disappointing holiday sales. IMO it would have been $50 by the 2nd quarter of 2020 if COVID didn't exist. Today I can justify 40-45 prices base on the expectation of dividend, today price is looking a year ahead, maybe 60-65 if you believe in the growth of different brands Kohls has added."
Finally got a good re-entry point to jump back on the Kohls train
"Tell me, who would sell at this 18 level and expect to make a decent profit?? Nobody !!!!!!!!!!!"
"Computers were set up for a hard morning dump in the retail sector today, not enough momentum with them to continue though."
Bought myself some more shares at this price.
"Lol all this over the idiot ceo of My pillow? ""In April 2016, a class action lawsuit was proposed for the pillows being falsely advertised, among the complaints being that Lindell is marketed as a ""Sleep Expert,"" despite having no board certification or special training in sleep medicine."""
"A couple of the top agents in this company were students of mine (A- and A+). If they're representative of the quality of employee, I'm staying with this company in my portfolio of mostly ""FANG"" stocks (which have paid off big(ly) this year)."
"A lot of negative sentiment from bulls in terms of these activist investors, but let's not forget the gap up from $51 to $58 based on the simple news of their involvement."
Consumers are likely to curtail shopping in stores until they feel more safe. Also holding off unnecessary purchases for a couple more months until they replenish their financial reserves. This will hurt all retailers especially hurting specialty retailer like Kohls.
Yes! $20 by thursday
WOW Keep Selling Shorts I'll keep buying this is absolutely ridiculous. the whole market is OVERSOLD
"I used to love investing in retail. Not now, they’ve got a long road ahead of them...."
"Great recovery today, Kohls!"
What is up today.
"Dont kid yourselves, everyone loves Kohl's during the holidays. Black Friday, Christmas, and Amazon returns. Game on!"
"Window dressing by big institutional investors / mutual funds. The big players have to sell, but us retail investors should be buying- better times ahead"
"Macy's beat and guided up, should be in the cards for Kohl's as well. The key issue now is when do the shorts finally give up shorting this stock? Or do we continue to have this roller coaster ride with the stock price. I think the holiday season will be huge, does that mean peak retail is here or not? I think not since next year taxpayers get the child tax credit and that is much bigger than the tax cut because it affects people who don't pay taxes as well. Refund checks should be huge next year."
"KSS. And catch a break. Great earnings, down ~7%..JWN almost same story, up ~11%. I can’t understand. I know it was up today but the logic doesn’t make sense. Maybe the CEO shouldn’t have mentioned tariffs. Seems that when that word is mentioned, down the stock goes."
probably Jefferis buying!
Kohls is partnering more and more with Amazon. keep in mind. Walmart was a brick and mortar seeking more ecommerce. Amazon was an ecommerce looking to go brick and mortar. Amazon's strategy includes leveraging existing businesses so they both benefit. expect to hear this in the ER.
"do you think KSS stock will now react alongside AMZN earnings, or not really?"
"why is it down? They reaffirmed guidance, and are doing fine."
I know for a fact Kohl's gets a lot of Home Decor items from Mexico!A lot are made in China but seeing a lot made in Mexico! Not Good!
"The short report for 12/31 has about 2.4M shares covered, which is a sizable reduction. XRT also covered about 1.2M. So this explains the rapid move up at the end of the month as there was little trade supply to sell and take profits on the pop. When shorts buy back they are removing shares from the market, just like when they short they add to the float, so create more potential sellers on a big down draft, or if the stock moves against them and up. Price action early this year also looks to me like more covering, just like we likely had a big chunk cover yesterday. So the real question now is do they continue to cover, which will squeeze the stock up as there will be little supply for buyers, or do they use the Macy's news as ammo to give it another try.Kohl's will be guiding up for 2019 if analysts don't change their estimates. They will do this just because of the $400M debt buyback they are now doing. So a beat, likely $5.55 and a guide up for 2019 is ahead, plus we will find out how aggressively they have been buying back shares and what their cash position looks like after all of that."
Boycott traitor Kohls that sells out to the enemy Amazon. I won't be spending anything there ever again. What a terrible idea. The ceo should be fired instantly. if not sooner.
This has the potential to go down to $37.50
"""Alexa, place an order at Amazon for a Keurig Coffee Maker and a Women's Black Converse shoe size 6, I will pick up in-store at the Torrance California location in a couple of hours"". ""Also, I will need while socks, same size as well""."
****RECESSION JUST STARTED** KOHLS GOING BELOW 40
"Thanks Crammer, he sent out a alert yesterday saying Kohl’s had run up very quickly and it was time to lock in profits ! Thank goodness I did ! Good luck everyone"
KSS is going to rip tomorrow. Feel bad for anyone who didn't cover today.
"kinda fun when the bottom falls out, isn't it?"
"KSS , Strong buy! Don’t listen to the analysts. KSS will be back to 70’s before year end"
Earnings Whisper $1.04. Strong Beat. Retail always Strong Holiday Season.
"Lots of chatter about Amazon wanting to buy either Macys or Kohls. Heavy rumor is Macys, but with their relationship with Kohls, wouldnt be shocked if Kohls is the winner. Will be interesting"
KSS is down -4.93% to 62.83
"In six months, no one will remember the name Corona virus yet they will remember when they bought stocks at generationally low prices and the markets doubled from the bottom. The uber wealthy doing what they do, creating chaos to make money off of false narratives and fear mongering by a news media with a political agenda."
what is it with this stock?
"KSS paying the price for JWN’s lackluster performance. Don’t worry, this one’s coming back...."
Shorts getting hammered! Love it!
Oh my. I am neither long or short. I do drop in from time to time as I am interested in trading this one again between $36 and $45 just like a few years ago. KSS is likely to drop below $40 in a month. Interestingly that is when people should be buying and not at above $70 when I warned on this board. But that is human nature.
starting to cover?
Looks like a buy down here. Xmas and best quarter ahead with less downside at 47. Well worth to hold or buy
Kss has a long history of paying a dividend and yearly increasing it as well as stock buy back programs.Last dividend payment was over 70 cents per quarter.I will be happy with 35 cents to begin with and expect yearly increases.We will find out the amount soon. No later than around late Feb or early March.
delete the twitter account of trump....whenever he tweets market goes down......
The stock is almost half of where it was in Feb 2020 with massive debt they didn't have before and when their doors open they are lucky to get half of the business they had before. Sell into this suckers rally. Trust me this stock will be 10.00 by July.
"Bah got the short interest data wrong, they fooled me again. For 3/31 both XRT and Kohl's had a reduction in the short position, XRT significantly, which makes sense as the recession case shifted in that time period. We still have a lot of shares short, but it has been reduced down 1.3M to 25.8M, still 15.77% of the outstanding shares. So that explains the move up by the end of the month and likely we had some more covering early on this month as well to drive it up above $72. The drop today might well reflect a lack of covering and the stock starting to drift back down to its new equilibrium, we will have to see.In any case, significant short covering has occurred on XRT and that is a positive, especially if they finally decide to throw in the towel on this shorting the retail sector. Something I think we might see once Amazon Q1 earnings and Q1 earnings for the retailers get digested."
resistance level 80 has passed. Now KSS is 52 week high 80.01.... Going to sky high
"With jcp and Sears slowly fading away, this is the best replacement. Strong buy"
I'll hang with kss too. literally hang. but seriously they should enough cash flow to survive until fall.
Tomorrow we have one more thing to look for during the Kohl’s earnings and that is the status of the $home takeover talks. Kohl’s hasn’t really tumbled on the leaked news which is a signal from the market for Kohl’s to go ahead on the deal. There’s usually pressure on the acquirers stock on such a deal. Kohl’s could do a stock deal for At Home issuing 32 million Kohl’s shares in a 1 Kohl’s share exchange for 2 At Home shares. I’m hoping that Kohl’s can make this deal accretive within a reasonable amount of time and create shareholder value.Then tariffs talk.Next of course is the Amazon partnership.Then Aldi’s and Planet Fitness.After all that they can get down to the regular stuff.Al I can say is that this isn’t your Grandma’s Kohl’s anymore.
Kohl's reached a 52 Week high at 46.94
"Some interesting things for me from the Kohl’s 10k. -Michelle Gass Kohl’s CEO is one of the youngest of the management team at 50 years old. She was President of one of Starbucks International divisions before Kohl’s.-Kohl’s has been buying back stock more often when the stock is down and they still are not half way through the planned buybacks. At today’s price they still have over 17 million more shares to buyback. -There are growing revenues from third party advertising on their website. It’s small now but could be a major profitable business.-Long term debt is under $1.86 billion with no payments due for next 2 years. -Kohl’s owns 412 of there stores, leases 510 stores, land leases 237 stores. & owns all its offices, 9 distribution & 5 massive fulfillment centers. -2019 Total property and equipment is $15.39 billion minus depreciation and amortization of $7.96 billion leaves property and equipment of $7.42 billion compared to $7.7 billion last year."
Dillard’s just beat!
Macys reopens next monday. Time to reopen retailers and restart the economy... retailers could be in for a hefty short-squeeze.
Is Kohls going to survive? My local Kohls sits there closed day after day. Same with all the other stores. It's sickening. Every day is just another day closer to ruination.
"RSI is way up, not a good sign."
"I bought Kohl's when it was hyped up early in the year on the amazon return thing. Though it dropped a lot since then, I have bought more at this current rock bottom price. Their forward thinking approach plus the sound midwest principled roots, other retail competition closing doors, look like great things are ahead. They are now paired with amazon, and facebook in different ways. I personally have seen how much foot traffic has increased in one visit to a Kohl's in Milwaukee when my wife had an Amazon return. They also gave a 25% Kohl's discount at that time. If they would just add something at their checkout counters like a soda/snack just to get a couple of buys on a quick visit they would even be more golden! Go Kohl's!"
"Just profit taking, it often happens even after stellar earnings. I did hear something on Benzinga News about someone trying to put together a leveraged buyout package for KSS. So I'm wondering why it didn't sustain the pop to 54+ when that new came out."
No Volume againYet stock is up over a dollarI would state the same thing if the stock was downThis is across the entire market which allows manipulation
Wow is all I can really say. I just joined this awesome stock picking service for free a few weeks ago and so far their stock tips have been amazing. Just go to the-stockdork if you want to join also… .
"Christmas 4th quarter earnings and sales are going to be very positive.Watch for further huge moves upward in the stock.All next year, quarter to quarter comparisons between 2020/2021 willbe upwardly positive.You have to ask yourself are things getting better or worse for KSS!If better, then buy."
scroll down and look at posts from OPTIONSTRADER
"Wow Don, a retailer for the main stream middle class is considered a safe haven stock now. Ummm, nope. Will it do better than most, yes."
"This stock, just based on the numbers, should be at about $12. I would think any correction would get you killed here."
Shorting again
Bought some more here.too good to pass. Once the upgrades come in we will be flying.
KSS share holders the wind is at our backs. Dec sales up 2.9 percent year over year - impressive! Stimulus passed and again more coming! Min wage to be increased from $7.25 to $15 very soon! Covid vaccine will end covid restrictions in 3 months and put the economy in a robust upward move! LOW INTEREST RATES here to stay!
"I noticed someone saying more people at Amazon return line. Not in my local Kohl's of which we visit several. Registers and parking lot almost always have near full capacity. Amazon line, minimal lines. Depends on where one might be located. We are in NY. DO not understand the negativity in just a few posts. The merch is good. Since Modell's closed, it is go to store for sneakers, footwear and other men's clothing. As more people get the vaccine and people go out, this store as other big box stores will continue t see a recovery."
How come this is performing worse then restaurants during the recovery period? Kohls has online sales. Restaurant have takeout. Kohl's will open up before restaurants. Kohl's sales have dropped less then restaurants.
I cant think of any other retailers whose business model is to accept returns for a competitor. It doesn't make any sense. Usually retailers dont want returns. You dont want customers who are serial returners.
Got my proxy today what are you guys voting on number 4 ?
"If you look at news for KSS, everyone is saying strong earnings, strong outlook but unfortunately it coincide with Fed speak. That's why it is down. After 11 am , when he finish talking, this stock will be up 10 %. KSS also raised diviend to 60 cents. This is a great stock"
"Michael you are the one who predicted KSS stock would plunge to $18 after earnings. How has that prediction gone for you? Now, you think KSS is at a top and time to short again! Ooooh, I don't think soooo.This stock is in a long term upward trend. Sure, it will fluctuate as all stocks do!This stock is going back to pre-covid prices or $50-$80/share. Shorts are in for a lot of pain!Enjoy the ride longs and the huge capital gains and soon restored dividend - 1stquarter 2021."
"Hey Vio, where are you???"
Kohl’s to the moon!! All aboard longs
"Resistance at 19.36, it breaks this we heading to 17s"
any thoughts/insights about the day so far?
This market makes me sick. We should have been up at least $2-$3 today with such a good news about retailers.
"Some on here said people love the kohls coupon, how did that work for bed bath and beyond....lol."
Down she goes! Boo-ya!
No 30.00 soon Ruiz.
KSS has plenty of gas today
"They just raised numbers on Amazon...Now, what's that tell you about...Brick and Mortar market share? The behemoth continues to devower."
"KSS, strong like bull!"
"All, can kohl’s afford this dividend increase?"
"Kohl's is going to rock this holiday season, many retail stores are closed. Amazon, Walmart already know they are going to come up short on deliveries and will be raising shipping costs. So an actual brick and mortar store with no competition KSS is the winner."
Always ahead of the timing!️️️
Sold 2:30 yesterday. Awaiting new bottom
Will be interesting to see update on shares short info.
I don't own any but gotta ask......is this dividend SAFE??? That's gonna be quite a yield at a price below $45.
"why are you twitty #$%$ erasing many comments ,, may the VIRUS BE WITH YOU , KARMA GOT YOU!!"
"Just looking at the report, the biggest problem I see is they burned a bit of cash this quarter, likely for the new plant they are building. That means they likely have to put a damper on the stock buyback for now, though they did buy back about a quarter of their $400-500M range. Cash burn was heavy and they are getting into a range where that can be highlighted, i.e. they might have to raise some cash with debt. Other than that the miss wasn't that bad but the guidance being taken down by 70 cents will kill the year. The question now is whether this is the beginning of the end of not for the company. Clearly added tariffs aren't going to help. However, they did increase SG&A significantly, so there is some room to get costs under control."
KSS Chart Breakout - video at STOCKTRADEVIDEO (Google them)
Apple opening its stores!!!! Soon it will be Kohls!
Look for buyout.Stock is dirt cheap
"People called me a hater when I said this would hit $15, but look whos right again? If the market tanks expect this to tank even more. Most kohls stores are still closed, and the store I went to that opened was not busy. Even with only 1 entrance I only saw a few people. Parking lot was empty."
shutting down stores get your shorts ready bois
Very very good earnings with Covid 19 situation
Looks like the value based retailers like Kohl's are ultimately going to be the winners once everything is back open
Soon you little pop-sellers are gonna get FRIED !!
"If this stock gets to $35, that would make the dividend 8%. OMG, what a steal. I could not pass that up."
"Funny how just a few weeks ago, one could not give this stock away for $37. Equally funny is how we have made $8 (20%) while FANG stocks were scrambling to hold tight. The great thing is that this will likely continue with the holiday season coming on concurrent with the smart money coming in."
"Really? 3.7% down, what gives?"
WOW! Some CHUMP is CORRUPTING the ticker-should be a Dollar higher- Pure Manipulation of the TICKER!!!!
This was all priced in. Will turn green
"18%, seriously?"
So .. $47.08 is KSS new threshold until Monday!Quick Math $47.08 - .67 = $46.41! Yikes!
"I think it is time to ride this puppy back to 80+ JCP, Dillards results and even Macy's to some extent is no surprise to anyone.This kind of drop is just not warranted for the sector and especially for Kohl's.."
"$2,000 Stimmy checks on the way. Just in time for new not-staying-home-this-summer wardrobe shopping!"
"I just sold some pot to buy KSS, once in a lifetime opportunity here folks!"
"I think yesterday we saw some of the unwinding of the long Amazon short the retail sector trade. If you look at Sears, JCP and Macy's they all moved up strong. Kohl's not so much but some of that has been flushed out due to the big rise from November."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dItvqNduxo0
getting closer to pulling trigger on a long position. just waiting for a large down S&P day.
Retailers are white hot.
Will look foolish that they sold and may have to cover.1+ gain for the day.
"The last time that I was in KSS I bought for $36 and you could almost not give it away. I traded between $36 and $44. Sadly I did not keep any for the large run up. I did try to warn all of you when trading around $70 but all I got was thumbs down and ""This time it is different"". Oh well, if and when this gets below $40 I will be back in. That is when people should be buying and not at $70 but alas they will be happy to dump below $40 yet again. Human nature I am afraid."
"Angel, Kohl's is a better buy than Macy's for the simple reason that Kohl's has been shorted much more heavily. Also the fact that they have a partnership with Amazon that has been buying companies is a plus."
I like at 30
KSS IS TEARING THE RECTUMS OF THE SHORTS!! DIABOLICAL ANACONDA SHORT SQUEEZE!!!
"how can this keep going up 2-3% every day, makes no sense"
They should offer a share of stock for any purchase over $25.
"looking at their balance sheet- the book value has gone from 6 billion in '14 to 5.5 billion in '15 and 5 billion in '16- they have bought back 10 billion in stock while they have 5 billion in debt- they owe 3 billion for their inventory- IF THEY DID NOT BUY THEIR OWN STOCK THEY OUD HAVE NO DEBT, 2 BILLION IN CASH, AND OWN ALL THEIR INVENTORY!! STOP THE BUY BACKS!!"
Bummer drop. You can alleviate some of your pain by investing in two excellent fast-growth companies that are both undervalued - NBEV and APHA. FDA hearing on CBD oil is on 5/31. NBEV benefits most if CBD is approved. APHA has facilities pending approval any day now through Health Canada. That will double their capacity. APHA is really oversold and stands to recover quickly with new leadership currently in place. GLTA
"Some fund is trying to keep this lower, a manipulating move, it won't happen, Go KOHLS !!!!!"
the Ticker is definitely CORRUPT !! NO stock trades like this!fake ticks!!
lets see if the shorts stay short?? FOOLS!!!!!@!
Should be $100 soon. Shorts will be
Over 20 soon!
Anyone else ever check out (http://Trade-view.com)? They just sent a tip about KSS
get out of this now.
major debt on the balance sheet
There u go.. Resistance level 80 has passed.... KSS will become second amazon
"I support Michelle Gass and appreciate the initiatives and financial success the company has had in the past 8 months post-pandemic. I just hope ALL investors continue to support her leadership and her vision which has created stores, incentives, and product lines that customers love. Lets not throw it all away or water it down into something boring for customers. If she needs a business jet to manage the business that's nothing unusual, big deal, I'm all for it. I remember after 9/11 or even during the covid pandemic business jets filled an important need. I get it."
Retail Stocks that took a beating this Week $KSS $HD $M $TJXhttps://www.transparenttradersblackbox.com/post/retail-stocks-that-took-a-beating-this-week-kss-hd
My only fear in buying more KSS is PERMANENT loss of capital.
Dillards stock over 28.00 and KSS right at 18.00 as KSS oversold for sure.
"You know this is going back up right? Kohls is not going bankrupt. The suits on wall street are purposely popping stop losses and bullying weak hands into panic selling. If you are not buying this dip, you are doing it all wrong"
If the market holds 73 in September next q will be better than today. Sell derp in the money calls for next week or two down to 50 strike
Someone wanted the out of money calls cheap cheap and they got them today. They'll run this up tomorrow into expiration to run all the people holding puts into the ground.
Will close above 50 today
"@Gerhard did you say KSS will be releasing a preliminary sales report today? If positive, will the help us have a higher opening Monday potentially, or will most people still wait until the official March 1 report? Thanks."
what is with today?
"After my experience I think I will short it. :-( Sad gimmick tricks on pricing. Everyday is a ""SALE"" day. Just mark the items at the right price and save all the hassle."
There are a lot of women at $KSS stores.
Cowen upgraded Kohls today to Outperform from Neutral with a $74 price target.
And lets forget about AMAZONfor the time being. Using KSS fora point of returns. If they did buysomething it wouldn't be JCP or Sears as they don't buy failures.They have plenty of money.
Could see $15 by end of day !
Strong Buy! This company is the best retailer for the average consumer!!!! Buy for the long haul. It’s an $80 stock. Take the dividend while you wait
why down in pre market?
Does anyone think Amazon might want to buy Kohl's right now given how much the valuation has decreased. Similar to how they bought whole foods? Kohl's right now acts as a depot for people to return and pick up items bought from Amazon.
Soon the move to 60s!
I think $75 is top .. time for a retraces to $72 test ... I think
Congratulations KSS shareholders. I bought JCP end of last year which has proved to be a mistake and now with the border adjustment tax on the horizon JCP will be under significant preasure as will Macy's and Sears. Too much debt. Retail jobs apparently are not appreciated by the House Republicans. Don't know if you think Kohls will survive but you are looking better than your competitors
this stock seems awfully cheap
"Kohl's sells overpriced merch with 20% 30% coupons to keep its customer base,you can buy anything they sell cheaper on Amazon or just about anywhere else,It must be the rich white moms that refuse to go to walmart for clothes that keep this store open,expect more store closures in coming months,things are not so great inside Kohl's numbers!"
what day is div paid?
Ms Gass will be 70 years old before she is credible in the investment community
KSS is down 5.25% to $62.46
This so oversold.
The talk is people are never shopping Kohl’s because they support BLM and many friends are never shopping there. BLM said they are Marxist??? Why did the CEO just destroy my stock with politics??????
"Michelle, we need some kind of positive PR to take this past 22"
BOYCOTTING AMazon is the way to help Kss. We have got to cut amazon's cash flow. Donlt think ordering one little old item won't help because every little bit matters. amazon wants it all.
Allow me to suggest a cool name change; Cretin's !
SELL THIS LOSER!!!
"Lidl is a German grocery company growing its store in the US and incorporating apparel in its storesTarget to roll out same-day delivery to half its store in 2018KR rolling out apparel in its storesThe common denominator is that dept. stores can't be exclusively dept. store and grocery stores can't be exclusively grocery stores. WMT and TGT are both dept. store with grocery in-store operation. KSS, M, JCP and other apparel heavy stores apparently is not the future...KSS see the future and trying to lease a portion of their stores for grocery/convennience store. AMZN is exclusively e-commerce except for Whole Foods and Book Stores. AMZN is growing their 365 Whole Food stores...KSS is luring in AMZN with AMZN returns and AMZN pop up stores. Bottom line, there is a lot of chatter in the retail/grocery store space, KSS is positioning itself to be on the center stage and baiting AMZN. It is already a foregone conclusion that e-commerce alone is not the answer to success in retail no matter how big your the revenue because margins are really the key as AMZN will tell you in their earnings report. AMZN will partner more with KSS or buying them all together PERIOD...no other possibility I can't think of because of KSS's off mall locations. Off mall locations is the key for KSS. Bought more today, I just can't help it."
anyone think with the recent tariff increase that it will send kohls ddown after earnings?
"Where else you gonna go? Target/Walmart clothes are #$%$ Sears out of business, JC Penny out of business, can't try stuff on with Amazon..."
So #$%$ back the truck up? Mf
"The CC was interesting to read, clearly the problem was February and they didn't rebound as strongly as they would have liked, this primarily due to weather. Tariffs played a very small part since a very small part of their goods are covered by the current tariffs. They have factored the current 25% tariffs into their guidance and that is one of the reasons they took it down so much. So hopefully they took the overall hit and can beat for the rest of the year.Further increased tariffs are not factored in though they did mention only 20% of their purchases are from China. So that is something to watch for if there is not a deal done in the next few months. The new tariffs likely won't be implemented before the end of the year, so will likely play a bigger roll in 2020.So the impact for now is flat earnings despite the debt and stock buybacks, which isn't good. They also had a 5 cent lease adjustment that basically offsets the Q1 miss compared to last year. Shorts will have to see how they want to react to that and we won't know till just before the ex dividend date how much they felt like covering."
Interesting timing on the downgrade. It's almost like a move to blunt momentum....
KSS is up 18.73% to 16.80
This will be bought out by AMZN one day. One of the best retailers left.
"Stores opening up equals the stock going up. Maybe back to $72 by Xmas, what a steal"
"We got another bbby here. Abandon all hope. Steep discount or luxury, that’s all that will survive."
"I was praying KSS would be picked this month by the My Animo Portfolio, but it wasn't. Crossing my fingers this drop helps get it onto the buy next month."
Can someone help me understand something? Yahoo finance shows that 108% of KSS is owned by institutions. How is that possible? I obviously don’t know enough about stocks. Can someone fill me in on what I’m missing please?
Going down more Wait and see it hit $12 soon.
"anyone else go long and YOLO for a good report Monday? I did, I'm in very deep..."
this is a no brainier buy
I’m in with 400 shares at $47.84 Gotta love that 5.5% dividend. GLTA
I finally jumped in up 300 so far
"We are down to 23.2M shares short, another 1M got covered by 9/15. So clearly the shorts are starting to get tired of losing money. The price decline from 9/15 when it closed near $81 is likely due to the fact that they have stopped covering for now.This is all positive for a future price more up and there is still plenty of stock out there to cause a sizable short squeeze. I just think that won't happen till at least the scope of the holiday sales become more clear. I don't think the shorts want to take another ride like they did last fall. So we have basically covered about a third of the short position since then, but plenty left to pop this sucker on good news."
thair will be delution! no doubt!
why the great uptick in KSS all of a sudden?
"There are people here that doesn't seem to understand that higher gas prices take away consumer spending power. This is totally different from energy corporations making a money because their product is in demand for consumption here or abroad. Think about it, if you spend more money at the gas station, there is less money for everything else. In the meantime, if you had invested in the energy sector you would have more investment income. But, there are more people that are hurt by rising fuel prices than people benefiting from increased energy prices or production of it...I pity those that have bought SUVs the last few years thinking gas will be cheap forever due to US producing more from fracking."
"Amazon run its business for decades without making a single thin dime in profit! It is only recently that it finally had grown enough to make profits consistently. However, when due to some 100 year freak event happens in the USA and causes a consistently profitable company like KSS or Macys to post a rare loss people dump the stock and doom and gloom are predicted.Nonsense, the government forced them to close their stores otherwise they would have posted solid sales and profits these 1st and 2nd quarters.The preponderance of the evidence clearly point to a return to normal sales and profits as all stores reopen and life returns to normal. Doom and gloom predictors were more valid to point to Amazon as the one to go bankrupt with all those decades of losses. Not to these well managed corporations."
Well that’s disappointing. Time to load up on more!
why do does everybody think retailers are going out of business i think if anything we are realizing we still need stores to shop clothing. When is the last time you bought $200 of clothing online? you might buy a pair of jeans but you are not getting your whole wardrobe on amazon
"I’m nearly there, somebody convince me to buy more. Love me some div payments."
This stock is weaker than circus lemonade! Why?
"KSS will beat on top line and provide even better guidance this week. With the market futures up and expected beat, I am gambling on this stock and buying some calls. It's early Christmas and the bull market is taking these higher and higher."
KSS will need to cut div in 2020 with Recession moving fast and consumer no spend expected. $12.66?
"KSS will go back over 20.00 with or without these ""fake"" shorts"
23 bucks today
"New record highs for sales, earnings, and share price are in the wings for Kohl's. Just a question of how soon."
Now this seems unnecessary. Too bad the market is down today. At least my Home Depot isn't letting the market affect its gains!
This is ridiculous. The selling is way overdone. The last time we were at this price point was at the height of the Lehman collapse in 2008. I do not think the situation is that dire.
Even their own online service is under pressure. FEDEX just announce that it's limiting the amount of retailers can ship due to the strain on the co. shipping. That's another shoe that dropped. KSS is in trouble on multipe fronts...not good!..It will keep dropping hard.
Everything they sell in still 10-15% cheaper on Amazon. They price everything at 200% and then have a sale at 50% off and an additional 15 percent off on certain days.......WHAT ?
"Kohl's is the 3rd largest holding in XRT, the retail ETF. So a lot of that short increase on XRT translates into increased shorting on Kohl's, which means the stock specific number doesn't quite tell you how much of the stock has been shorted."
NO SUPPORT until 16.20 . SELL NOW.
There we go again.Sell the news scenario in Retail.
So much for GOOD NEWS !
"Not sure it really helps, but it's interesting that Jefferies analyst Randal Konik keeps his Buy rating on Kohl's and has a price target of $110. That would be nice!http://www.analystratings.com/articles/jefferies-keeps-a-buy-rating-on-kohls-corp-kss/?ref=tipranks"
If Uber can pump 20% after posting a record loss this stock can reach at least 50% after earnings
"Bad timing, Target reported much better numbers the same morning making Kohl’s numbers very disappointing. The bright side that it sets up a good next year if they can execute on digital after the investments being made. Kohl’s is little behind in digital and has catching up to do. Kohl’s saying it had double digits digital growth is evasive. Also we haven’t heard anything about margins, if Kohl’s maintained there good margins growth."
Diviend date is over. Why people buying now?
"This afternoons volume increase with rising prices and the price action the last few days would indicate to me some big boy shorts are starting to throw in the towel even before seeing the latest short position data which likely will show a drop in short shares in the first half of September, which is what one should expect with the Amazon news. This shouldn't be a top retail short anymore."
Buy at this levels!!
"So there is now no denying the earnings growth in the stock as analysts have finally started to upgrade their 2020 earnings. $6.27 likely will get revised even higher as more do so. This now gives a legitimate story for the stock being undervalued. 1st you have the growth multiple, now 9 (1.5 times 6% average earnings growth over the next 2 years), 2nd you have a 4% dividend which should further boost that multiple (probably a 1.5 times the square root of the dividend is more realistic than just adding the dividend as a multiple but honestly if your stock had a 25% dividend and it paid out over 4 years you would double your money, so as long as there is earnings growth it likely should be a straight add). Then 3rd you have the sizable short position, they all have already sold and thus the stock price has already taken the hit from the shorting, so all that is left is for the stock to go up if they would cover. For me I use the % of the short position as a guide for how much the stock can go up. That means for Kohl's at least another 15% in valuation.So you take all of that together you will end up with a $82.50 stock price as being fair value given the current data. Shorts will have to start to react to such fundamental analysis as their case for Kohl's going bankrupt or being overvalued is getting weaker by the analysts earnings upgrade."
can this rally continue
Day traders lost out on this move today!
Goldman hit job. What else is new.
I am going to miss MichaelLulz. He has been entertaining with made up numbers and his stock predictions have been a good luck charm for those of us with long positions the last few months.
"Lots of people bashing, ready to short on this board. Better cover now, because we have the testing in place and plans to reopen, and Kohls is in a good place for this; stores are not in crowded malls, prepped for Covid (sample tables down, floors marked,registers protected, etc..), will open just in time for all to safely buy summer clothes. Earnings above $5 again 2021, this can only go up over time."
The media used the GDP report to proclaim how great the consumer is & 2 days later the consumer discretionary stocks crash $KSS $JWN
Shorts think future share price movement is predictable but these are not normal times...anything but.
“Down goes Frazier!”
Shorting this trash at $48 Dividend will be gutted and cut
Very good volume....I like it a lot!
I am a buyer at $39...it will get there.
"My post, 9 months ago, as follows--- KSS was then a bit over $40 and guys were saying its worth 50+ due to the healthy dividend.--------------------------------------------------------------------""$KSS conversationSeems all retailers in the Kohl's type of offerings are headed lower as the ""in store"" retail tide goes out... never to return.Thus even fairly good ships will also go down. Kohl's doesn't stand a chance to have a long term improvement.On the contrary, when the next recession hits in a year or two, KSS will easily sink to the 30's, and very likely enter the 20's at some point.""-----------------------------------------------------Make that the ""teens"" in price. A big $17 and counting."
A little perspective on their progress with e-commerce: look at Google Play store app downloads.Kohl's 10M+Target 10M+JCP 5M+Macy's 5M+Old Navy 1M+Nordstrom 1M+TJ Maxx 500k+ (1/2 M)Lululemon 100K+ downloadsWatching cnbc you would think Lululemon is the only clothing retailer out there. Not even on my radar.
Kohls has gone downhill the last year. Bare shelves. Clothes look like thrift store clothing.
Back to pre-covid KSS prices we go ( $50-$80/share)
BOYCOTT KOHLS AS LONG AS THEY AQRE IN BED WITH aMAZON.
"I asked my wife to name her favorite stores, and Kohl's was at the top of the list. KSS seems like a buy near $41 with a P:S <2, PE~12, and yield ~5%."
Chart says 38 now
"Articulate the reason for your price targets. Every knows you’re an idiot when you spout a price up or down thinking you can sway anyone on the forum; instead you’re just permanently muted, ignored, & less than significant."
Well that’s an easy new mute decision. Jack “The Desperate Short” Bauer.
"Run it up so I can run it back down. Wash,rinse,repeat!"
Just bought 500 looking for a close around 49
$TSLA can you recycle these POS ?
one of the few retail stocks on the upswing today. the mass retailers like Target and Walmart have seen their best days last year. Walmart knows it and is trying to get into banking now instead. on the other hand Kohl's best days lie ahead
can't wait to go shopping!
"Reality check here for all the debt alarmists.If I have a HELOC and draw it down, moving that cash into my savings account. Does that now mean my financial position is perilous? What about next week when I move that cash back from my savings account to paying back the heloc loan. My financial position is suddenly not perilous? This is basically what Kohl's has done and will do. Notwithstanding some lower scale short-term accounts payable/receivable and inventory net adjustments."
"Last chance for Shorts to cover at 70. once buy back orders start executing, price would jump to 75 plus."
"Well in the run to $80 it looks like they covered about 2.8M shares and got the short position down to 26.9M, XRT also covered 1M. I guess that likely means they took the Macy's news as an opportunity to cover. Whether that continued after earnings is another question. In any case, it means we will have flushed weak hands which should let the stock recover quickly as there will be a lack of supply of available stock thanks to the short covering. My guess is there was some covering as we ran up to the $83 level then they really covered as the stock cratered. It well could be that once earnings came out they reupped their positions, but we won't know till the 11th.In any case short covering of any kind, even with a lower stock price is a positive because it removes available stock from the trading supply."
Jajajajajajaja shorting
Stock market fluctuations beginning a move out of high tech to beaten down sectors.
Why so low today? Anyone knows???
What the heck? Went from 69.20 to 63.63 in the manner of seconds. Very weird.
"Shop locally and don't ever shop on Amazon. If Amazon drives retailers out of business, there will be lots of local people out of jobs, and buildings sitting vacant which will drive up property taxes for others in the area. BOYCOTT AMAZON. iT IS A CANCER."
Who can guess where CEO Gass was located during her video interview with YF? Looks very green & expansive outside her corner office.
Dillards just blew revenue and earnings expectations out of the water. KSS is next
"Looks like we are in for a boring few weeks of trading here as we see if we can't reestablish the stock over the 200 dma. Today it looks like we test it and then seems like in the morning shorts are driving it down again in what I hope is an attempt to continue to cover more of their short position. The next update on the 1/15 short position won't be till the end of next week, that is really the next time we can see what the shorts are thinking (short more or it is time to get out of here). Given the low volume up moves we have lately it would indicate to me that the supply of stock available to buy is low, which means any buying interest, be that covering or actual new positions by investors should be drifting the stock up. This should continue till technicals turn positive on the 20 50 and 200 dma (two are already) which might get us more buying interest from a chart perspective. Otherwise we have to wait for the next big piece of information which should be earnings. If analysts don't raise their 2019 numbers it is highly likely Kohl's will guide up simply because of the debt buybacks. So I think we are likely in for a positive earnings report as year over year comparisons will show strong margin and earnings growth and guidance should be positive. Also we will see how aggressively they continue to buy back shares now that the pressure to buy back debt is off till 2023. So how much cash will Kohl's want to keep on the balance sheet to weather any potential recession."
Just a minor 200k increase in the short position on Kohl's as of 10/15 but they are feverishly covering Dillards which had another 800k reduction. Still not enough there as there are likely not enough shares for the shorts to cover their entire position. As Dillards stock squeezes higher post Q3 earnings (think any sell-off there on actual earnings will be a buying opportunity) we likely will see some sympathy covering on retailers. With Tesla and some others the shorts have to start to be taking it on the chin. They also massive increased their short position of CLF and they posted a solid earnings beat.
What are the cirties doing with COVID19 homeless and drug users camping out in KOHL parking lots spreading the disease? Heard some horror stories
Does anyone have any idea what the market was actually expecting? I find this reaction rather odd.
"Looks like the shorts are starting to run for the hills, almost 2.9M shares covered between 11/1-15. The short position is now just over 30M shares which is still a sizable % of the outstanding shares. Most of that likely came in the big exhaustion gap we had on the day of earnings."
Any company who's ceo panders to the woke crowd and the hate and anti capitalism groups like BLM not only shows horribly poor judgment but wont survive long.
KSS should buy JCP
boring stock if you want dividend and no growthin stock price this is it
I bought on bad news down around $37. it now seems that the ducks are quacking big time. I am already out and will buy back in when it goes below $40 again. Nobody seams to learn from history.
"Why this stock is so much lower that Target, I always thought they should be in line"
I pray those PRIVATE AUTO dealers IN OHIO and warn the AUTO Manufacturers to keep at least 40% on the MAnufactring line...OR OCT..may be HELLISH .!...
a little birdie told me black friday sales were up yoy
KSS is down -4.90% to 70.25
"Kohl’s pretending they’re have a partnership with Amazon is about the same as they kid getting his lunch money stolen thinking he is buddies with the bully.The one problem people have with Amazon is returns are a hassle. Kohl’s, a competitor, has taken that obstacle away paving the way for Amazon to continue to destroy them. You can’t make this stuff up."
Is Kohl’s going to have someone wiping done their shopping carts like at the grocery store?Grocery carts always scream high-end quality. People don’t like buying clothes at grocery stores.
Sell short
Kohl’s is the biggest beneficiary of the demise of Sears and JCP. They have an older demographic that will transition over nicely. Younger people are looking for a deal and smooth online shopping experience - both of which Kohl’s has became a master at offering. Stick with this one as it goes down due to failures of poorly managed competitors.
"$16.80s now, Are you fools still holding ????"
"Well doesn't look like a good day for Kohls todayas it sold off in sympathy with other retailers. However, it is not a bad day if we rally into the close and put a nice tail on that candle. JB and the shorts are betting a repeat of last year and if you look at that pattern the stock rallied into the year end and then sold off big thrice. We have sold off big twice now but the stock reacted much differently after the 1st drop, and I think will react differently after the 2nd as well, as well will rally back to recent highs fairly soon (maybe as soon as Tuesday). So I think the bull case is still very very strong and if shorts are adding to their position in the hopes of a repeat of early 2016, they will be in for a rude surprise and of course ensure an even stronger up move in 2018 when they cover. Holding a long term short on a stock that likely will have a significant dividend increase this year is not advisable and I think even JB will tell you if we aren't in his target range by mid February he is going to cover and find another short."
I mean Wow! Dodged a bullet!
Stores opening .https://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/news/2020/05/05/kohls-begins-reopening-stores-in-some-states.amp.html
Was this really at $74 2 weeks ago. Seems like a bad dream.
"this is an absolute steal. you could be robbing kohls of their dividend when it returns or you could listen to these stupid shorts. Kohls is going no where but up. Just relax and watch the rise, a year from now you will be so happy you did!"
Such SANDBAGGING!! Retail is GREAT !! WHO'S holding the TICKER back from going higher!! Jackhole!!
Why the flip this morning from up over $3 to down over $1
"Once the big boys start selling their shares all the other big boys will start to bail ane that thought what a great dividend will end up holding the bag in the low teens but will still get that 5% dividend payment,maybe"
"Suckers rally at open. Garbage report, kohls has nothing going for it. Watch this drop 50% by Jan 31. Mark this post!"
"Gap at 58 filled, now for the pullback . Worth 20 MAX. Store filled with trash like KMART."
I guess some sites like kohl’s likes China products over American
I may be tempted to sell some KSS when it rises to $80/share.Not at these insane prices. I am a very happy long term stock holder with my first position in KSS taken at the low March of this year.These are the prices I was waiting for. Now that I own the shares you cannot get them from me.These are my shares now in a long term diversified portfolio.Thus is how I became a millionaire. I do the opposite of what stock analyst recommend.Like Warren Buffet and Peter Lynch they too have little regard for their price targets and recommendations.
The only open question is exactly when life in the USA returns to normal not if.Fausi just announced that this pandemic is coming to an end very soon. He should know.
Get start for new run kohls above $20.
daily short sellers - go away- just go away !!
We should be UP today after reporting some pretty good news. Because mall-based Macy's is hurting we got painted with the same brush.
onBusiness channel kss is one of the poorest run retailers
All of the Kohls customers are at the Goodwill Store.
I don't think you can call a bottom at this moment. ..... We have to see days of price stabilization. The trend is still clearly lower. Everyday this week it's closed RED at least 2%. Why lie?
Let’s get to $40 and be done with it
Kohl’s is the only store around in many areas. It will bounce back big time.
Went to my local kohl's yesterday and saw a long line of people with a lot of merchandise. Back to school shopping in full swing. Very encouraging.
"Not sure Kohls will ever get past $20Has pushed through 18 many times , but to fallbelow again and again.Missing this rally over past weeks does not bode wellOnly time will tell if they get past this and rally bigor end up bankruptcy protection so they can start fresh and new"
Surprised this held at lows as jwn went up. Little strange.
"Not sure if that was the low though, think this is a head fake to draw in more small investors who think they can actually game the stock like the big money boys."
Only reason this is down is because DOW down and thats the only reason .
"JCP may file bankruptcy. It is a very good thing for KSS. 600 competing stores may go away. Virus ends soon, KSS will be good, if goes longer then win on JCP not making it."
hate good news on KSS it tanks on good news - market manipulation reigning again
Buy now Thanksgiving and Christmas around 3-4 months away.
I wouldn't be holding this overnight...
They cannot afford to pay out the dividend. Once the dividend gets cut the stock will get cut in half. Anyone feel like going into Kohls to try on clothing that other people tried on?
I unloaded a bunch of shares today. Not falling for this trap. Proceed with caution kids. Better off buying options 1-2 years out.
Shocking! Hey Michael are you crying now? Dont commit suicide.It's just money you short sellers. KSS is Up! Investors like the performance of KSS and HI 5 to the CEO!
Dividend cut coming soon
I'm buying for next years return and beyond !
New vaccine by October it seems !
Shorts are losing tens of billions in this market!
no hope
Amazon deal might backfire on Kohls..
"Kohl's has been mentioned on Fox Business all day, nothing but good!!!"
"Pretty much the consensus for Kohl’s success is Xmas. That is pretty worn out. JCP, J Crew and Neiman Marcus all thought Xmas was their secret weapon too."
"Quote from Facebook friends ""I went there tonight and left. The line went to the back of the store worse than Christmas!"" I like Kohl's myself and just bought some to include in my COVID stock list."
you yuppies! Up huge on my puts.
Sit back and watch it grow!! My dividend will be in the bank soon!Capital gains keep rising!!
It beats both EPS and revenue estimates....Shorties brought down the stock...It will go up eventually
Buy time on this drop
dont want to sound over optimistic but I believe at this PPS KSS is a no brainer.
Lousy Analyst snake oil salesmen didn't have a buy at 10 or 20 but at 50.00 they have a buy. I have learned from the past you buy when the dorks say sell and sell when they say buy. KSS is overbought and overvalued.
"Kohl's might as well be in the mall, the way it will get treated...."
"400k of short covering, so they continue to cover. However, there is no real sign in XRT that there was anything going on. Where you do see a big increase is in Macy's which added 10M shares. So we might have had big shorting on the earnings day and then covering to get back to near neutral, that is a possibility. However, it looks like the shorts are still way to short and of course the volume in June so far has not been showing any size, so little if any more shares may have been covered in this runup. We wait for the 6/15 to see if it was a spike up and then a spike down and they continued in June. Otherwise we just got a huge price move thanks to earnings and new buyers and buybacks and still a massive short position which certainly must be starting to get painful."
KSS announced they have $2.4B in cashQ2 loss was $39million in the midst of the pandemic.No Bankruptcy ANYTIME soon
So I like Kohl’s - shop there - go to the stores quite a bit. Thinking about buying into the stock. Wondering a) with such a volatile market and retail being such a fickle segment of the economy - what will the effect be on Kohl’s ?B)is this a good price to get in ?Many thanks for the insight. Happy and very healthy new year to all !
"Thanks to the Manipulating fund ,,ceo , in bed with them."
dog #$%$ of a stock
Good bye $40 and welcome $30 in next quarter.
My prediction for Tuesday: dilution
I think it will fie for chapter 11 in a few months.
"We haven’t yet seen the benefits of the Amazon partnership. Many people don’t even know about it yet, once they do, more walk-in activity."
Looks like Amazon is ditching its small footprint store idea for Whole Foods:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazonowned-whole-foods-scraps-smaller-365-store-expansion-203543290.htmlThere is talk that they might be interested in the Sears stores locations and turn some of those into full scale Whole Foods stores. Will be interesting to watch but I think for now this is a signal that Amazon isn't thinking about buying Kohl's at this stage because if they were using the small store footprint to take advantage of the freed up Kohl's space would have made sense.
They just featured KSS on this sites morning watchlist. (https:// www.tradenow.xyz)
i can't believe I don't hear talking up a boycott for amazon.
another day another 52 week low. ho hum.
DON'T WAIT. IT'LL ONLY GO LOWER.
Neither long or short. I traded KSS between 36 and 43 years ago. I visited KSS when at 70 and warned that it would not likely hold. All that I got was negative comments. Now that it has fallen even further below 20 I sadly see this following sears and other brick and mortars. I wish you all luck. I lost a poop load on the stocks that I currently hold as well. Almost nobody has escaped.
Back to 30s and beyond soon!
anyone else fear this year holiday comps are going to be insanely poor?
It will probably take a long time to recover. https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/19/kohls-stock-risky-bargain-after-q2-earnings-beat/
when does revolver get paid back & dividends reinstated any predictions??
"Can’t believe I could have gotten out at $76 per share less than a month ago after Amazon announcement. Time to load up for next dividend and to account for overreaction? I can tell you this, Kohl’s better just do what they do well rather than lose focus and mess around with some costly acquisition. Stick with buybacks, debt reduction, and dividends please."
"This was on my radar as its oversold, adding calls."
"Day low $47.72, guessing it closes even lower ... subtract .67 Monday ... Bingo $46's"
"Never fails, was gonna sell over $48. for quick profit yesterday, but thought let it go to $50, it tanks!Then when I sell another stock for quick profit, it goes thru the roof! Figures!"
"How far can this go? I sold half at 78$, and looking for a target to exit even though I'm long term holder, this went up a lot last year. Thoughts?"
i thought conf call sounded pretty positive regarding the new initiatives and focuses in place
"Consumer confidence yesterday was at a 18 year high. Competition reduced from Bon Ton, Sears and JC Penny closing stores plus Internet sales tax now being in forced. I guarantee this will be the strongest holiday season ever for Kohl’s. I’m talking both higher sales and margins. Last year they had a 6% comp year over year, Michele said on the conference call that they would comp that comp. Kohl’s raised guidance into what was thought to be a slow quarter. With astron"
Analysts taking up earnings significantly and show strong earnings growth for Kohl's not only in 2016 but also 2017. That will gets this stock to a market multiple type valuation and of course means even $67.50 is undervalued.
"You guys are missing the point of buy the rumor sell the news. Staggering losses, time to exit this trash stock. It's headed the route of JCP. Who goes to a Kohls, I can get this #$%$ online for half this price. They are doomed."
Kohl's reached a 52 Week low at 22.76
Close $46.80
"This stock has done nothing for 3 months, despite all the pumpers. Imagine if you never bought this pig and instead put your money into TSLA? Why do people hold onto this garbage? Do you like pain?"
Look for $54.00

"Have you've been to a Koh's lately, Frickin' GhostTown! Dead Cat Bounce before next major drop!"
what kind of a stock goes up anywhere from 2 to 5% on a daily basis that is not some sort of a bubble?
KSS is down 11.86% to $62.58
"So the guidance for Q4 is a little soft compared to what analysts had ratcheted the numbers up to. The revenue is really quite solid and earnings are up 9% in dollar terms before taxes. With the stock buyback, so far rather anemic this year as they have only reduced the share count minimally, that gets you to a 10% earnings growth rate year over year. Of course earnings are much stronger because of the lower tax rates but we need to see what they can grow earnings by organically, which seems to be quite strong given their low single digit revenue growth.As to where we end up, it will be ugly this morning. Whomever wrote that article yesterday with their buying and selling range might get some buying. Fortunately with a large short position there might be some covering to help stabilize the price and who knows, maybe at the end of the day we can be up. However with Amazon down 2% and Target getting killed it will be an ugly day I think."
"Feeling real good this morning about selling my shares at $51.26 yesterday! And come Monday there's a guaranteed .67 drop! Yikes! Sidelines Baby, Sidelines!"
me afraid to be long before earnings call. could be scary.
This is the MOST confusing stock
Still waiting for sub $40 to get in. Neither long or short just a previous owner from two years ago.
"Just canceled my account, along with a slew of other patriots who reject the selling of BLM gear and not pro police gear. You picked your side, I see at least a 20% drop."
Shorts taking it down today because they can. Will be interesting to see how many shares are short before we finally head into the holidays.
"14% dividend, 61% payout ratio at current prices, is the world ending?"
I'll buy if it hits 15. I think thats a good entry point given the risks here with the virus concerns.
Why is this down so much
Just their stores are big . That doesnot mean they are making sales
I muted michaelRlulz but now I'm very concerned with his well being. Can someone that hasn't muted him tell me if he's doing okay?
"this is madness, Target is UP and Kohl's is down …."
I am so glad kSS going down the tube. I never shop at Kohl’s because Kohl’s cheated me for 89 Dollars .Never settled that. So I don’t shop there. I will be happy if they go out of business. But I am so sorry for current stock holders. I will suggest please sell out. Next step they will cut the dividend.
Why do someone buy a Stock that has 90% chance of going down.
I have been waiting two years for this to get back to the trading range of 36 to 42.
"These are the same analysts who had a price target of 48 for Dillard's for a long time, only after about the fifth or sixth back to back blow out earnings did they finally raise the price target to 57.50, meanwhile the price was around 75. Analysts are in the business of making money for their clients not for actually predicting what a stock or sector will do. Why would someone that has the sole interest of their client say something is a raging buy unless their clients are already in the stock and why would you say something is a turd unless they want to get their clients into the stock at a discount. Until their is a complete and efficient way of creating analysts' opinions that aren't a conflict of interest, their ratings are worthless to the small investor."
"fwiw, I have two Kohl's, each a few miles from my house. I rarely shop there and was in each one during the past few weeks to use their Amazon return service desk. Both stores were a wasteland nearly devoid of customers. Can't blame it on covid either since there was an adjacent Target as well as a WMT to each Kohl's and those places were bustling and busy with shoppers."
"Dividend and Giving away merchandise. Bought a few hundred shares at 34.50 but have no idea how they will continue the dividend and giving merchandise away. Just bought 2 Fila Golf shirts, Haggar pants, and 3 jar candles for $52.00 and free shipping to boot. No way Amazon could match that and truly wonder how Kohls can keep sending me a dividend and all these coupons."
I hope the talk about KSS buying At Home is just a rumor. At Home stores are ex Kmart stores with merchandise that mainly comes from China. If you ever been to one of their stores you can see they do not fit with the cleancut image of Kohl's. Can someone tell me way this would be good for Kohl's? I hope I am wrong
Even just as a trade. This was oversold yesterday. I like investing long term but came upon KSS yesterday and seen it down over Six dollars and had to buy.
supported Kohls during the last year. Believe in brick and mortar but they pull Mike's products because of politics and I refuse to shop at Kohls. Is Kohls management stupid or spineless?
"Where are all the recent messages? We only have ones from 20 days ago and older, Anyway this format sucks."
Boycott all thing Amazon and that includes Kohls.
"would a boost to retail tomorrow be overshadowed by inflation news/CPI, etc?"
"XRT covered a sizable chunk, 4.5M shares to 21.3M, going into 12/15 but interestingly Kohl's didn't. We added about 1.4M short shares to 25.7M. Kohl's went from $66.5 to $61.25 in that time. Given that we have not gone much lower than that since it is likely the shorting has stopped or balanced out with XRT. Clearly yesterday we would have had short covering, likely mostly driven by XRT. This sets us up for a strong move up if the shorts continue to cover."
i am sure it will go up in festival season
Strong buy
its funny how jcp was down 10% and macys was down and both a semi good rebound...but good results for us and NOTHING
Is the dividend safe?
"Once Dow hits 25K this will start tanking, see you at 35 in Feb."
"Finally had to mute Satnam. At first the comments were amusing (based on how wildly incorrect they were or will be), but now the consistent level of ignorance and ridicule is just plain boring."
KSS did the right today. $1.5 million to Red Cross and its Texas employee/4 Houston stores.
oh JCP is up and Kohls is down … this is actually entertaining
"It was when I was returning an amazon package at my local kohl's, standing there in a line behind 20 people. That's when it clicked, more amazon=more customer traffic. Can't be too sure about the future of any retail but KSS should have legs for a while."
"Most Kohl's stores are marking down ALL store clearance an additional 30%. They also have a 30% off coupon. So you can get stuff up to 96% off (90% + 30% + 30%). I have never seen Kohls discount so much stuff this much. Expect their margins to be awful for this quarter. Kohls is known for aggressive discounting, but this is a new level. The margins are going to be bad, they will probably lose a lot of money. They still have a lot of xmas stuff - I saw xmas wrapping paper in a store yesterday."
"Kohl's has drawn down its entire $1 billion revolving credit facility, is slashing its capital expenditures by $500 million, is suspending share buybacks and taking a look at the dividend program, and is cutting expenses across marketing, technology and other areas of the business. Kohl's stock sank 6.4% on Monday and has fallen 76% over the last year. The S&P 500 index"
Big money going to drop the markets as hard as possible going into a weekend that will prove to be pivotal for the worldwide April Fool's joke played on us by the elitists.
"Many of the retail stocks took a large dive. This was not simply Kohl's issue. Maybe a result of the JCP resignation? Look at DDS (Dillard's) - strong stock with great earnings that had a nearly identical day to kohl's today. The chart looks exactly the same as Kohl's. Urban outfitters had a very strong earnings report just released and it fell likewise. Retail department stores had a had a real bad day today (lots of shorting?), it wasn't an issue specific to Kohl's. Look at Macy's too, it has been rising, rising and fell today."
"Went in Kohls Friday could hardly get through the isles . Do not know what is going on in other stores ,but this store was very busy !"
Nice how the execs are churning their stock options over making big bucks as share holders lose.http://archive.fast-edgar.com//20200304/AGZ2W22CS222W9UZ2R2E2ZZ29TRP2228Z222/
Went to $KSS and they don’t sell My Pillow. And those Michelle Gassless Chaps are out of stock too.
down 2% today
"Here come the high buyers, profit givers. Time to short again. Going to 10.00. P/E of 45 and company giving away goods to get people to come in, no thanks."
"Looks like markets are responding to the Gilead news about Covid vaccines. No reason this should not go over 24 this week, unless of course you longs don't put your money where your mouth is."
maybe jcp could buy Kohls and longs make out.
Short this Garbage stock.
KSS is up 10.60% to 12.73
Good start to the week. Let's gooo!
Here we go again with tariff talk which is weighing on the market the last two days.
I see my favorite stock is back on sale
People will never stop shopping in person
I just bought 500 shares. Peanuts to some of you but a great deal of money to me.https://www.google.com/amp/s/investorplace.com/2020/05/3-reasons-to-buy-the-post-earnings-dip-in-kss-stock/amp/My own speculations and this article convinced me that the worst is over. Do your own DD. Goodluck to all!
Just wondering who are the fools selling.
"Interesting, Kohl's is one of the worst performing stocks since the bottom last Christmas. XRT is even up strongly since then as well as a similar company like Dillards. Macy's and Nordstroms are about flat. So I think there is still a lot of catching up to do for Kohl in the New Year."
Why would KSS shares drop $5 in early trading after a strong earnings announcement? Isn't the OPPOSITE supposed to happen?
Note to self never touch retail stock ever again
I think this stock will trade under $20.00 by April 8 latest...let’s watch and be ready to buy...need puke out day
Is this the new push to 50+.
"The think is, Kohls has been knocking it out of the park this whole pandemic. They've taken hard decisions, and pivoted IMMEDIATELY, improving their position across the board (online, curbside, so many new lines).Even dealing with the activist investors. Yes, it went up waaaay too quickly but with moves like this, Hot One (that would be M Gass of course) has instilled major confidence in KSS.... Just loaded up. Mb we'll be baggies for a bit depending on general market conditions but kss will be solid for years to come thanks to their quick moving and shaking during this pandemic..."
Sell this junk
kohls merchandise needs an upgrade
"Hahahaha!!!! I bought 5,000 shares in April at 12.50ish!!!! Paid $62,500 for FIVE THOUSAND!!! Hahaha I’m rich!"
Just wished that I sold after earnings and not waited for the short squeeze at ex-dividend time.
"Quite a ride so far today. Looks like the early morning reversal was a head fake and later in the day they broke through stops to unleash programmed selling. We will have rallied a lot off of the daily lows but tomorrow we will see more selling in what has to be a retest. Looking at the indexes it seems like the Russell 2000 is setting up for a retest of its 200 dma, which should hold, so that is likely what will signal when we have hit the bottoms of this massive sell off in stock continues tomorrow (likely).On the positive side, Kohl's hasn't been taken out and shot and if the volume remains subdued today it should signal that this is a stock that will do well in any rally off of the eventual lows.Now let me go make another cup of tea so I can get some new leaves to read."
Kss should increase the Kohl’s cash validity to 1 month instead of couple of days. Then customers are going to come back.
Back to $17.50 . Look at the charts.
"Sales are so good at major retailers that Macy's just announced it is closing 100 stores.That's reality folks. KSS, GPS, JWN, M--they are all losing to online shopping."
In 284 shares :)
"Kss had a Fabulous 3 day Sale-Big Numbers, Huge Profits,Retail #s were great- stay long my friends!!!!•"
If you bought in 60s and 70s it's all over-newbies wait for 40s
"So one of the reasons I think Kohl's will survive is that they are ahead of the game when it comes to the shrinking retail store footprint. Further, unlike some items that are great to order on-line I know from my own personal experience that shopping for cloths isn't. There is a fit issue and a how it looks on me issue. Further, Kohl's is really where mommies go to shop for their kids and I believe that is still something mommies like to do with their kids (no matter how much they complain). Shopping for your kids isn't easy because we don't know what they like, so this gives going to someplace you can get good cheap cloths a real leg up."
Bush must be sitting around waiting to cut price target. With all that's going on seems like the analyst has an idiot approach towards Kohl's
"Kohl's puts out a nice press release saying that they are requiring face masks of customers and will have signs and greeters at the entrances starting July 20th. Wonder how the CEO would feel if she knew some store Managers are refusing to follow the new policy and telling employees they are not allowed to tell customers they have to wear masks as they don't want to turn away sales. A family member of mine works at a Kohl's in an area with a County mask requirement and the Manager refuses to follow it and has already said he won't follow the corporate guidelines and employees who express concerns about customers without masks are put down and told ""we'd hate to lose you""."

"The peanut gallery got awfully awfully quite, where did you losers scurry off to?"
STRONG BUY !!
This will be back to 50$ in no time.
Think we will see $60. before next earnings !
wow just wow!
"Wow I finally had to mute Shep...ok we get it, you don’t like shopping on amazon."
Pump and dump nobody going on cruises
$14 is next stop.....
Too bad. Gave back all of today's gains. Bannon effect I suppose on the market as a whole.
"the biggest issue with KSS is the cash flow - QoQ, it has a negative cash flow (operating - investing), i.e. burning cash each quarter. what investors are looking to see a positive cash flow..."
I hope the new Adidas lines includes a range of yoga pants! Judging by Lululemon yoga pants are golden like an electric car!!
"kss will reach history high,because it's stores too busy, covid-19 very bad and outside very hot, but people still go buy it's things,so this December quarter will very strong."
local Kohl's unbelievably busy. I DO see Amazon returns being carried in and Kohl's merchandise out by same folks. in this regard I'm glad the activist investors are now letting management run the operation as they know best. let the good times roll...
"Currently throughout the world there are now 100K cases of the Corona virus confirmed. In the first term of the Obama administration, this time of the year in 2010, there were 56,000,000 cases of the Swine flu confirmed in the USA alone. Over a half a million Americans were hospitalized, over 12,000 died eventually. The stock markets dropped approximately 3 percent over that time, and ended the year up over 12%. Can we just agree that this is being politicized and overly exaggerated by a news media which hates our President and an uber wealthy 0.1 percent that control and manipulate the markets to ensure their already 80% of the total wealth of the world continue to increase. They use that wealth to ensure that the middle class never aspire to higher or greater levels. It is time that conservatives and liberals to include progressive liberals join together to ensure that wealth taxes are implemented on those who have more 250 million dollars in assets and that these taxes be used only to pay down the national debt. Only by working together to ensure a fair and even playing field will our society truly be a free and open society, where people are self determining of their future and the future of their country."
Well Nordstrom closed their stores a few days back. that news in itself did not impact their share price. Looks like the store closures were priced in.
The investors have spoken!
I love shorting retail.
"Really good results, considering that the corrupt, thieving Democrats still are trying to keep the economy closed to make Trump look bad. So much for caring about the ""children"" Right Joe, Nancy and Chuck? They can't even run a convention, with so many errors. How are they going to run a country?"
"Next stop is 46, wow, that's a heck of a drop. Kohl's cash will greatly be needed after this one :)"
"Irrespective of the market today, it will go up IMO"
$KSS https://twitter.com/Clifton_Capital/status/1262010625670238211big upside for Kohls here - new market share - riding with this account - suggest you all do the same $$$
"Big big factors that will drive this north is if a second round of stimulus is PASSED or not. Those still out of work need it badly, especially small business owners in the restaurant and event industries. Can't spend what you don't have."
Seems like selling puts and calls is a good strategy for KSS. Anyone’s thoughts? New to options. May be misguided but why would anyone straight up buy stocks when sell options are out there?
flat revs and eps for 4yrs and people rush back into this to drive it to old highs????
Wait until the DOWNGRADE hits the wires.
Kohl's will get killed once it gets cold and customers will chose to stay inside and order online from Amazon with free delivery without wasting gas or getting bundled up to get a new pair of jeans!
"Normal stock fluctuations. This stock is in a very long term upward trend!The really big money is going to be had by the patient long term investor.Collect the dividends and enjoy the capital gains.Back to 40s, then 50s, 60s and beyond!"
CEO on CNBC tomorrow at 2pm EST
"LOL this stock is trading at prices last seen back in 1997... Is it going bankrupt? The market is judging it as such with a 0.5 price to book value. If Kohl's survives Covid19, I have a feeling it will bounce back from this bone shattering low."
Given the price action this morning the weak June retail sales were likely already factored in and explain the drop down to the $70 range. Will be an interesting ride into the fall. Hopefully the company has taken advantage of the lower price to buy buy buy stock.
"I suggest do not buy at $34 as stock must get Dow to 21,000...then buy. Changed but to $29 and I expect to be filled before April 30.."
this is a five dollar stock at best
"with AMZN flush they may go shopping, they got food, they may want some new clothes"
"Amzn this amzn that on retail....I say it is all hype. Although they clearly lead the click game that is not where they are making their money. It’s in their AWS business. As for their click business, all the stars aligned for amzn the last few years because of the Great Recession, followed by a stagnant economy then followed by the oil crash in late 2014 which subsequently lowered fuel costs for the delivery business. Well now It is evident that Retail in general is coming alive due to stronger economy and rising wages. Amazon’s advantage due to rising fuel costs is somewhat diminished or put another their margin in retail is not something to celebrate because delivery plus Returns is eating into their margins. Yes, consumers for the most part still prefer the shopping experience of “see touch and feel “. The bottom line is a stronger economy and rising wages lift all boats in the retail space and yes bric and mortar with the advantage of see,touch,feel and click and pick up at the store plus ez return is something AMZN is envious about for a change and will expand more into bric and mortar. I am crossing my fingers that KSS do good this Xmas and the amzn return program prove to be a hit after December propelling the shares to $55 before the earnings report then bamm to $63 then $ 66 or higher then amzn buy out $85-$90 by summer."
"had to happen sooner or later, a stock just can't keep going up 2-3% every day"
Today is a rare buying opportunity for KSS stock. This is going to the 60s then 70s near term!
KSS is down 6.01% to 37.62
why is JWN up?
"You are going to SELL just before a vaccine is approved by the FDA in Sept and just before a huge withholding tax relief bill and extension of unemployment benefits, just in time for the holiday season which will be much longer than last year?People do dumb things! Like listen to stock analysts who are motivated by selfish interests and are often highly subjective. That analyst has a huge holding in Amazon stock and is short KSS and M.He said that to make money off of you.Fact is most sell ratings come out at the darkest lowest point in a stock price history.After the stock rises during the holiday season and shots up 200 percent plus he will change it to a Buy rating.At that point, it will be time to sell not buy. You know how its time to sell, when all the stock analyst have changed their sell ratings to a buy."
"I bought at 12 and sold at 18, if it gets back to 13 im buying 5000 again, and another 2,000 if it goes to 12. This might be the retest."
Who's trading for pennies ? Let it RUNNN- penny traders GET OUT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
back to 58 by noon
who's daring enough to short kohl's at this pointit was Warren Buffett who said to buy when everyone else is selling. this .may be it
"Hmm, apparently earnings tomorrow not on Wednesday. So I guess they have one more day of nonsense before we can all look at reality and judge the company based on the cold hard facts."
BOYCOTTING AMAZON yet? or just watching Amazon eats Kohls lunch? The choice is yours. Support the enemy or don't shop there.
"Floor price is 15.05-15.70 heading down there looks like, could be wrong."
"Doesn't look like nine is coming anytime soon, this will be a big week coming up for good news on the Corona virus, mortality rate will be dramatically revised as asymptomatic cases start to be accounted for, as well as the wild guesses by physicians on the real contagiousness of the virus. Add to that the reality that even the liberal Gov. Cuomo of NY has that the confinement orders were a major mistake and probably led to more people actually getting the virus who were least capable of dealing with it, the old and the sick. Also there will be very positive news on the treatment front as more and more success stories such as the initial tests of Hydroxychloroquine and Z pack as well as more news comes out about how countries with vastly lower mortality rates such as Germany, Austria, Israel and Czechia have been confronting the virus. More news about countries such as Bahrain who have been treating the virus with Chloroquine since February 26 and have a much lower mortality rate than most countries."
"Just went shopping at Macys and Kohls. Most people will never, ever buy clothes online. Just like some will never fly on an airplane. The latest government sales statistics clearly showed that when all brick and mortar retailers were closed thatinstead of buying online people just held up clothing sales until they could buy at Kohls or Macys again in person.Why? About 75% of all clothing sales are at brick and mortar stores. And those people refuse to buy clothes online.That perfectly explains the huge drop in clothing sales recently put out by the government.That means actually Kohls and Macys have customers and most of their customers WONT buy online ever!Amazon cannot therefore take market share away.As the stores open again, that is very bullish news for Macys and Kohls.It also means Amazon MUST buy brick and mortar retailers to compete as it did with Whole Foods.Very bullish.macys and kohls are going to get all the customers of THE BANKRUPCIES GOING ON NOW.When JCPENNY closes you go to Kohls or Macys!These stocks are going to soar!!"
"Dow goes down- kohls goes down,,dow goes up Kohl's don't go up- Manipulated 100%."
My wife just came back from Kohls and left everything in the buggy the dressing room was closed she won't be back for a long time
"Company will not survive another lockdown, Fauci said today on CNN that half of the states will go to lockdown in the next two weeks"
I just muted half of the community in amzn
Probably a good price
"Sure I could have recently sold my long position of KSS when it rose from $11 to $30 in June and made a massive triple digit return, but I didn't though I knew it would drop back some.Why? Because I am in for the BIG money!Only by holding long term until this covid nonsense over will you get the massive returns that mademe a millionaire.I am very happy to wait as I did my homework and know this is a great long term investment.When the dividends are reinstated I will still be long this stock.You day traders can fight over pennies, while I will get the huge gains."
"I'm enjoying this ride after earnings! I guess it's just a matter of time before the shorts start their negativity. Oh well, made some serious $$$ so I'll take a little off the table. But still VERY bullish on Kohl's."
what's the reasoning for the 6% dip? confused...
Where is the bottom? I bought at 45 thinking and now it looks like I made a mistake.
Wow this company is filling lots of gaps! Wish I had more than 125 at $25.
"Why is this still dropping? 2% a day is not good. I saved atleast 2% today on half my liquidated position. That's 10% by next week. They should have let it drop all the way when the bad news hit, not make it HTB for a couple days and now it's no longer Hard To Borrow. The pain would be over by now!"
Welcome to the 70s folks. Long time coming.
"Shorts are trying their best to keep a lid on the stock - posting under different ids, giving thumbs down to anyone posting any positive observations, badmouthing the company and its stock and so on. Pathetic attempt."
SHORTS ARE FEASTING-WILL CONSIDER UNDER 42
"that was my last load up, thanks for my dirt cheap shares! good luck to us all."
"Below book value now...rarely see that nowadays. (Value after all assets sold, and all debtors paid) XOM also was getting close to that, but then bounced off near that value. Some irrational selling going on, but now a good time to make an initial position I think."
The funny thing about the sell off today is that the 10 year note is DOWN quite a bit. This means that it was just sheep selling off for no reason at all since everyone is scared about the 10 year note right now. Hilarious.
This is like hurting your own family member in your home. Very sad this is happening. We have a new President and let's move on. Don't hurt American products and people.
"and down it goes, you knew this was coming"
$50 price target @ Kelsey Advisory due to improved sales and solid management.
I am neither long or short in KSS and congratulate the longs. I bought at $37 and sold at $45. It is highly likely to drop back below $40 come summer. That is when I will buy.
"Earnings guidance increased $1/share for the year. I like the report, it was a great quarter and they have a great future. Not much share repurchase done, that's a good thing they can wait for any potential pullback in share price (this morning for example)"
This stock will get cut in half after they report earnings that expect to be at -1.25 a share loss. Most of these retail companies are going nowhere and following the path of JC Penney. Massive debt and no profits.
"This is a YO YO stock, not worth the time anymore."
Today will be seen low of $38 and this stock will behave as Titanic movie as low $30 in next few weeks.
Oh my goodness. I did not think that we would get back down to $36 again.
JC Kohl’s
KSS ia going to tank because of NKE
send me an angel right now
KSS is down 10.95% to 22.08
"I went there this weekend and nothing but last years stuff that they hadn't sold last year. Nothing new and shelves mostly empty. When are they getting stuff? Are the trade tariffs causing this. I like the store, but could find anything to buy."
"What to do? Is the price going to hold this year, or will the market take this down below $40 like it did last year?"
this is unbelievable how they could wait till now
Load up here @ $9....it may take into June to get there ...be patient and place your GTC orders soon
How many 52 week lows can a company make in one day?

5 day 5 min 23.15. Almost time to sell and switch to puts and shorts. Not risking it especially with a group known for shorting heavy having their sights on this .
KOHLS just opened the hen house to the fox.
"As I said, back 50s folks. Market fluctuations happen. Value of KSS is much, much higher!!"
David Lohr has suggested that VNO might buy KSS.AMRN is the top pick of David Lohr.
Michael- never try and catch a bottle rocket.
Finally moving up!I am going to clothes shopping for cool weather.
below 50 ............its Kold..long @48
Easiest day trade ever
"thank you, bought abother batch at 63... good luck to all"
May be I am wrong. KSS is very strong. Now going up. Sell off is over. Can close green today.
Looks like they think 46 held.
"This isn't the same as Kohl's pre pandemic. It has Sephora and more retail opportunities due to BKs. Also, companies usually become leaner and more efficient when they go through recessions and those that survive, come out much stronger. This is a 60$ stock at least by the end of 2021."
what a #$%$ stock another jcp
never trust analysts no accountability
Is there any light at the end of the tunnel
had a bit of this....let it go yesterday finally....loss....get back in when s+p 500 down to 2700 or less
"$45.51! Another Day, Another New Low!Big Box Retail is Dead!Stocks to consider JC Penney, Sears, Kmart, Shopko, Etc. Etc."
No 52 week low so far today! Yeh!
Just bought 400 @19.85.
I imagine the silly money was buying Retail ETFs for GameStop exposure this week. Of which Kohls is a big component. Now selling them. This too shall pass.
Kohls going to generate additional profit from EV charging stations!!!
I was surprised to see Kohl’s as busy as it was in Olathe Kansas parking lot wasn’t full but was half to two thirds full people may get their fill of online shopping I have yet toOrder anything from Amazon since shut down started the one time I decided to it was 3 weeks to delivery so cancelled the order I’ would like to see Kohl’s stay around but who knows people may get tired of online b s and go back to Kohl’s but odds are against them

kss is about to reinstate dividend payments. back to thr mid 30s after what will be a blowout earnings
BUY MORE
Will investors accumulate KSS in the next few days to pick up the nice dividend next week?
Boycott Amazon.
KSS the largest department store by number of stores in the USA.They aren't closing stores. They are taking business from defunct competitors.KSS is a winner of Covid.Post Covid one of the best stocks to own.
We picked the wrong horse boys and girls!! We'd be a lot less poor if we picked TGT (or put our money under the mattress).
Sears rocks............Who would have thought.......the ugly duckling is all green today.
Nice repeating $18.5 / $23.0 support/resistance channel. I bought Calls @ $18.8 just 3 days ago and like clock work it is popping back up already :). Will sell to close when the SP hits $22.5.
Subtract .67 on Monday and new 52 week low going into next earnings report in August!! Yikes!
Beats the street and the morons #$%$ sell off
Short it gang easy money we are going down
Missed revue but beat expectations? These articles are so confusing
Of course some hatchet article by Motley Fool comes out to throw some more fuel on the short fire and keep KSS down......
Even if they make their #..and miss expectation down 2 or 3 bucks..thats trhe way of the world now a days
It looks like the street already realized they F up yesterday !!!Let’s take this monster back to $65
first support @ $52 and second @ $49.30if break both then strong support $44.08
Shorts must cover...60+ beckons tomorrow
Kohl's is not going anywhere. load up
Will $KSS come out with a line of Gass leather jackets and bustiers? Might sell. I’d use my Kohl’s cash for that.
Kohl's is a goner....right behind JCP :(
Dividend yield only 16 percent. We need an increase.
this stock is sick
"Should be going Red 3,2,1!"
Interesting article from the guardian . I’m a long time supporter of Kohls . I am very disappointed that the company distributed 100 million in dividends instead of purchasing clothes already made in poor countries￼￼￼. I’d gladly give up my dividends if this information is true.￼
KSS is walking in SEARS footsteps uh oh.
Expect a10% correction. stock at 70.50 right now. In 1 week.

Lol people! I bought 5000 shares at $12.50avg last April!!!
"I have a sizeable position in Kohl's. Out of all the retailers I believe Kohl's will be the last one standing strong through all this mess. Michelle is a good CEO and with soo many brick and mortars going under this is going to translate to more market share for Kohl's in the upcoming years, so just be patient and trust the process. Bit of speculation: but let's not forget that Amazon is nice and cozy with Kohl's that relationship could always lead to something more "
"$19.30 is the MA on the 10 day needs to hold,but downward pressure from the 5sma coming down heavy on it. Know when to hold em' and know when to fold em'"

What steal price!!!!
Their earnings were so bad
haha what a brutal week in general for longs! Us shorts have made a fortunate off your backs! Thanks and have a great weekend! Better luck next week chumps!
"Cramer's take- Sounds like the Club will hold their KSS shares, but will lower the Price Target. They justify their decision by pointing out KSS has a great CEO and pays a nice Divi in the meantime. They downplay the ""value trap "" Macy's-like risk. >See my FB group, Action Traders if you like Cramer."
Kohl's says it sees same-store headwinds in Q3 and Q4. Read the news! Its all about the future. And with the big run-up the last few months the stock was due for a correction.
"New 52 week high, this should get to be very painful for the shorts as we head into earnings. Next week there are two catalysts for the stock one being Macy's and the second the retail sales report. Then the following week earnings, which of course normally produces a short sell-off followed by the holiday weekend sales, which will be Uuge!So I am guessing big time short squeeze is coming very soon as new all-time highs dictate it is time to cover for the pro's. The amateurs always wait to long and never know when to take their lumps and losses."
"Money moving out of this stock and retail and being put into other sectors that are bouncing back now, don’t get emotional with a stock, buy the stocks that are about to have their runs now as this one has had its moment time to sell."
This is down almost 30% in a few weeks. Wait till they announce June sales!! My guess is record sales n blow away projections.
"Kohls doesnt sell anything people need - food, medicine, cleaning supplies. Instead they sell stuff you dont need in a depression - clothes, perfume, socks. You can go a year not buying new clothes. And how is the website going to save them? There are plenty of websites that sell clothes that are better quality and lower price!"
This stock would have to go back up about 25% from where it is now to be back where it was about a week ago. Way oversold again.
have you ever return something bought from amazon and return it to Kohl ? that's = more traffics to Kohl
I am getting sick and tired of Kohl’s (a quality company) taking a beating every time some other loser retailer comes out with a negative earnings report.
So much for an “efficient” market. This stock is clearly not acting as it should under the circumstances. I hope that the lower guidance from Kohl’s was sandbagging it and they end up beating going forward. Guess I’ll just have to keep collecting the fat dividend.
"This is the Buying opportunity, see the Historical data of last 5 years,"
"Wow, KSS is kicking #$%$ and no one is here! Gonna be rich by myself...?"
"My thoughts are with the employees who lost their jobs today and for those still employed. Having experienced a number of these I know how difficult it is for everyone. There is life after and as bad as it feels now, life goes on and it is often better. Keep your head up!"
going down to 11
$120.++ coming! why? well because no dividend plus very very little competition! we will double the last highs!
"RACE to THE BOTTOM: The problem with retail is there is no pricing power due to all the stores closings. In fact it may well be that all of the store closing/liquidation like Bonton Stores and stressed stores like JCP are just trying to produce cash flow to pay their debt. or stay afloat that they are actually selling their products at very deep discount to be competitive and other stores has to follow, which means for sure there is no pricing power and may indeed create a race to the bottom on pricing."
what's up today?
"If all you pumpers just want a great dividend, why not buy Macy's at $7.45... they have a 20% yield! Kohl's Price Target cut to $12.65!"
"Not liking the price action, I know its likely just the shorts, but I am out till I see some more data. The markets are up on hopium as well, so I think we might be in for another big leg down here soon."
"UBS is nothing, their opinion was bought, Morgan Stanley gave the upgrade,now they count !!watch the bounce!!"
"Based on this story just published by MarketWatch on April 14th, Kohl's just took out another loan of $1B, more than enough to ride out this downturn.https://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-stocks-that-have-surged-lately-but-will-surely-disappoint-2020-04-14?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo"
"After seeing that piece on Amazon on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver... Kohl's will be filing chapter 11 within a year! JC Penney, Sears, Kmart, Shopko, Etc, Etc!"
Just think about the $250-300 per kid that parents are going to start getting from the government in July. Just in time for back to school shopping.
January retail sales this morning showed that December of last year was worse month for retail since 2009. January showed an incredible stabilization. Clothing was okay. I think this okay environment will be enough for Kohl’s to make their numbers and not okay for some of the weaker competitors.
Start shorting it fails at 54.60 like clockwork
"Why does TJX get an 8% boost in PPS after terrible sales and earnings, and KSS always gets screwed, even when meeting or beating expectations???"
Reduce inventory and reduce selection? That’s what these investors want. Amazon had more choice and better prices. These investors are destroying Kohl’s.
"So the CEO feels good about 2018 and they are continuing to grow their customer base as they acquire new customers, likely from other retailers that are closing their stores. He says it is all about driving traffic and that grocery stores are nice and a Whole Foods would also work quite well. So another hint to Amazon that buying Kohl's might not be a bad idea if they want to expand their Whole Foods footprint as well."
I Drive by various Kohl's Department stores on a daily basis. Kohl's is alive and well.
"When this is all over, said and done this stock will at LEAST DOUBLE if not more.They will get stimulus help and remember JCP, SEARS and KMART are all has beens. Where the hell else are people going to shop. Plus the online sales and AMAZON relationship all plays into the quick recovery after this is over. For me it's the best retail buy out there right now."
The next JC Penny's. A follower instead of a leader!
Amazon is probably buying up their portions of shares.
I went from being up 170% to only being up 158% that sucks.
To the moon! Run for cover shorties!! Will probably be some profit taking tomorrow that’ll bring this down a bit. Wondering if I should sell some shares to take advantage before the dip.
Have you been to Kohl’s lately? The lines are out the door. Also they take all Amazon returns! Buy!!
"Easy short, fair value is 23.77"
"""kohl's partnership has yet to give it a lift.""wink wink"
"If you took twenty Chinese accountants who knew nothing about America and showed them the earnings report and the conference call transcripts of both Kohl's and Home Depot and told them one was up 9 bucks while the other one was down two bucks and you asked them to guess which was up and which was down, everyone of them would have said that HD was down and KSS was up. That in mind is the definition of controlled/manipulated markets."
The short news for 8/15 is in and it says that 1M shares were covered on Kohl's while another 5M were covered on XRT. So I think a big part of the move up in the stock prior to earnings was short covering driven. Then basically the earnings were strong enough to not let the stock drop back after the covering pseudo rally.The position as of 8/31 which we will know mid September will give us more insight into whether the shorts are throwing in the towel on retail. The 5M shares covered on XRT is certainly a good sign.
KSS- My best guess is that is going down to 9 shares in this market.
"Earnings report tomorrow going to crush this stock. Stock was just at 15 3 trading days ago, why are you stupid morons paying this price? It's going back to 15 then back to 10.00 or lower. The Next JC Penney. Bankruptcy coming. Short short short!! Losers!!"
WS has this entire sector wrong! One of the biggest mispricings I have ever seen in my lifetime. Analysts tripping over themselves to pronounce the death of the department store thinking they are prophetic...
Wasn't looking for this but it's too good to pass up. In for 250 shares.
"see jwn and burl earnings report,kss earning are lot more better than them,kss still #1 ,kss worth$48. per share,"
Jumped in at 61.05! That was a nice gift this week.
I now own 500 shares that I am in at $20.00. Wish I bought more.......
Wow November retail numbers are up .08% when they were expecting .02% and Kohls is down almost 2%......dont wait to get out. I would sell and put money to work in other areas or a better retail stock like LULU. I think this tanks to mid 30s by mid Feb.
KSS is up 4.97% to 51.65
"Kohls cuts forecast by 1% over the next 3 months so Wallstreet sells it off by 20% ... Unfair, but that's the game driven by options behind the scenes. Good news is 47/share is a great entry for anyone who can actually afford to buy the shares."
Yeah so this is a new all-time high since you have to adjust the prior $79.60 high by the dividends paid out since then.
"Went to Kohl’s today and saw only one person and then i saw somebody in the parking lot and i ask the girl if she was ok, she had been fired from Kohl’s after working there for 20 years, she said the store fired half the employees, i felt real bad."
"The short interest for 3/15 came out last night. It shows heavy shorting in retail in general. XRT, the ETF, was up 1M shares, Macy's was actually up almost 10M shares. Kohl's was up 1.1M shares to 27.65M shares short. So that explains some of the negative stock price reaction after earnings. Clearly the shorts took retail earnings as an opportunity to go short again. Given the relatively anemic volume since 3/15 I doubt we have had much covering since then if any, maybe even some more shorting.If Kohl's continues to deliver and buy back shares this will just be another positive as the large short position gives the stock a huge number of shares that need to be repurchased at some time. Staying short on stocks with huge dividends like Kohl's and Macy's can get you hurt in the long run if their businesses don't collapse."
KSS is up 5.01% to 69.80
Covered all and went Long
"Pretty much a guarantee KSS will cross 45 before hitting 55.And along the same lines, 40 is a much more likely target than is 60.60 is years away if it is even ever seen again.The retail tide is going out ... and out...and out."
"So Kohl's has several significant earnings positives other than increasing sales and margins, they are:1) Reduced depreciation expenses in the future as depreciation should come back in line with CapEx.2) their share buyback which looks like it is taking their float down by about 4-6M shares a year or 3-4%.3) Debt reduction, which is leading to reduced interest payments on the debt.All of these things will increase earnings and significantly over the next few years. However, with the latest price declines and the drop below the 200 dma we likely have to be patient here for a while before we can see new highs. That is unless the holiday sales are such a blowout for Kohl's that they have massive amounts of cash on hand to unload in January, either through debt buybacks or more share buybacks. I think they are about at the limit of their debt buybacks as they did a big buyback this year and were already buying back debt in the open market when it was opportune."
"Funny, last night Cowen’s top retail analyst Oliver Chen gave a glowing recommendation on buying Kohl’s here on the NBR show. He talked about Kohl’s having the best loyalty program of all the retailers, the strength in leisure apparel for Kohl’s ,mentioned the sizing and Amazon initiatives."
Hold tight 50 around the corner
The competition is falling like Domino's. Christopher & Banks filed BK this week and said they will close most stores. The few remaining clothing stores will only get larger with more market share and more profits
@Shep What are you hoping to achieve bombarding the board with this traitor nonsense?
rent is duedoes kohl's have problems with rent money
Longs go ahead buy buy buy run this up so I can short it back into the ground! That $600 a week unemployment runs out end of July which means the shopping sprees end! Better pray they extend it.
"those of you that have been with KSS for long term, do you typically see stock price increase right before the dividend date or not necessarily?"
Cant believe the increase in kss stocks this week. What's everyone's opinion on where this share price will go to over the next couple weeks?
Governments are using a sledgehammer to kill pesky flies.There was far better ways to manage this mild flu pandemic.Only the 5 percent who are at risk need be isolated and protected.Destroying the economy was always a foolish approach!Most Americans have healthy immune systems that are more than a match for this mild flu named covid!
NO WHERE TO HIDE!
"Just released:Macy’s, Kohl’s have about 5 months of cash available putting them at risk from extended closures, analysts say!!!!!!"
any thoughts on today's great start? Is it because of positive Macy's report that people are feeling more positive about KSS upcoming report? Just trying to learn more and more here. Thanks!
Chart shows big plunge coming. Can't break $20. Lookout below!
Interesting enough they ran it up to the top band at $23.40 after hours. Should fall fast back down to 20 in the coming day. I sold at 23.37 AH. GLTA. I'll be looking for a short entry/puts soon.
KSS $15.66 Pre-market!Price Target $12.66! ... but that great safe dividend!
Earnings are gonna destroy this
"Looks like the brick and mortar retail gets a break today, with AMZN disappointing and all that."
"To all you longs, its finally started and only Jan 4th..........see you at 35."
"A slight reduction in the short position to 27.4M shares. That is good news that the shorting that has been going on the last few months might well be signaling that it is coming to an end. Early in April it looked liked some more shorting was likely, but at least they are not piling on 1+M shares every 2 weeks anymore. That is a good sign as getting rid of the short position will be a big driver for the stock price when it happens. Interestingly XRT had a sizable reduction in the size of the short position. So maybe the retail short trade is starting to get undone."
"TONS of shorts on these travel stock boards, let them do there thing and if the price falls then let it. The more the price falls the more shares I will LOAD! $DAL $CCL $PLAY $KSS"
The stock has turned.
Balance sheet is relatively strongIs this a good entry point?
"Brick-and-Click = the strategy to win and grow in retail. Alibaba has done a lot of buying brick and mortar as they are nearing saturation point for internet sales. Amazon is closely watching Alibaba and is following in its footsteps by buying Wholefood. The next step for Amazon is logically buy a company that sells both hard goods and soft goods with many location in the US. Kohls fit that mold with over 1100 locations nationwide. And with Amazons market cap of $542 Billon, a takeout of Kohl's at $80 or around $14 billion is a mere 2.5% of Amazon's market cap. It is a done deal and just a matter of time. Also, the CEO is 64 years old and stand to walk away with $45 million a retire in Paradise."
why did they bother giving any forecast? Shot themselves in the foot.
"Ignoring the recent Amazon interest in buying millions of KSS stock, one must understand this Covid drop in KSS is very temporary. KSS is a great company that was highly profitable before covid with a generous profits and generous dividend with annual stock buyback programs making its stock holders richer yearly.Fact is many profitable companies like KSS put in a loss for the first time due to covid. Disney just declared its first quarterly loss in 19 years due to Covid. Yet covid is very temporary and vaccines are at the door that will make it a thing of the past. And even without the Covid vaccine naturally people will eventually all become immune to it as we see now covid cases are declining nationwide.Sweden which has no vaccine and no shutdowns naturally declined to nearly no cases just buy letting it run its course. This is a passing storm. The sun will shine brightly soon."
"Up , up and away!"
"Honestly I'll miss Kohl's, could always find a nice pair of Lee carpenter jeans, thing is, I can find them online too!... and cheaper, even without stupid Kohl's cash!"
"From an past loyal customer: Unless you have a 30% off coupon, some of their prices are crazy. Also, buy one item at full price, get 2nd half price? Not any kind of bargain. Kohls seems to be going the way JCP did, most consumers are not that gullible. Hope they are talking to customers who no longer shop there."
"Seeking Alpha posted Kohl’s is in trouble. I don’t believe it. They have Amazon returns, cut some lines of clothing and cancelled some orders. It seems to be focused on what the customer wants."
earnings will be good 85 dollars stock. buy and hold
Love that I get a 6% dividend on this
Get out on the bounce this is going to 21.60 or lower...watch n learn kids
#YO let's go !
and now the air is being let out of the bubble
$KSS Kohls looking like a good short at this level 8-)
Everyone laughed when I said the price target was $12.65
what happened to cbc saying these wouldn't go up for years months ago because of Amazon they hurt us again wrong volatity wrong on oil wrong on retail wrong a lot tell why do we have them around
"i believe it is clear at this point that while retail brick and mortar stores are not the dominant part of sales they once were, people will still go out to shop and they will be shopping at the stores that execute the best. Kohls will be one of those stores. Kohls online shopping and their association with Amazon are both a plus that will serve them well going forward."
OMG. Congratulations longs but this is crazy. I was buying at 36 when sentiment was bad and you could not give the shares away. Now we have the opposite scenario where sentiment is good and people are buying. I do not short stocks but I am tempted. certainly would not buy here.
https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-returns-help-boost-kohls-stores-shopper-traffic-2019-8
"I know premarket can be crazy, BUT can someone describe how after KSS report the price could actually drop below yesterday's closing? Don't worry, I'm not panicking here, just trying to learn...thanks!"
buy the #$%$ stock u jerk offs I did my part
Ok longs 2018 is here so let the drop begin........see you at 35-40 in mid Feb.
Kohl's is up 9.83% to 28.72
KSS reached a new 52 Week High at 68.86
Kohl opening today in NW Wisconsin
Worst share of the year goes to Macys and second worst share goes to kohl’s 
Did a store walk thru on 3 stores in Mi. All three were redesigned during the pandemic. Very nice not what I expected. The stores had much more traffic than expected. I don’t getting out much. Talked with two store managers and they expect a lot of foot traffic since mask mandates are coming off and back to school. They laughed and said a lot of families have had to buy larger sizes. Yes I too am going on a diet. Spent about 270 with Kohl’s cash and what not walked out happy and less than 200. I think I will try kss for awhile and skip Macy’s. There stores looked old and they shuddered 2 by me. 
"The short position numbers came out yesterday and XRT got another 1M shares shorted. So definitely some big boys were playing retail to decline, especially with the government shutdown and potential recession fears. The short position on Kohl's also increased but not by much. To me that basically reflects how the stock performed in the 2nd half of January. Given that the stock has declined significantly so far this month, one can only assume there is more shorting going on. We will get December retail sales this week but January is still likely a week or two off. Till that report comes in and shows strong retail sales there is little catalyst to move retailers up. My guess is the Macy's and JCP reports, which come out before Kohl's will be the next big thing to move retail stocks. If the results are good and the outlook decent we might get a rally off of these lower levels we are now trading at. Yesterdays action was somewhat encouraging as we rallied into the end of the day and reduced losses.For those taking it on the chin for having bought at much higher prices, one option now is to sell, take the loss, and with the money buy deep in the money calls. Generally they have low premiums and you can increase your leverage usually by a factor of 3. This would allow you to recover your losses faster and as the stock recovers to your old break even price generate higher returns. Often, because on high dividend stocks the premiums on the long duration leaps tend to be cheap for deep in the money stocks, I simply buy leaps and then I have much more time for the stock to recover. Once you get back to break even you can then sell a portion and let the rest ride, or sell and buy back the actual shares you had before and pocket the gain."
BOYCOTT KOHLS AFTER THE AMAZON DEAL
"Where the heck is everyone? No post in 4 days???Anyways, I just received an e-mail ad from kohl's... they are currently carrying/selling the Kendall & Kylie Collection! Should get a boost in sales! "
"Kohl's at the present is good for trading, it is way oversold imho."
This might be floating on Gass. Hope the balloon doesn't burst.
Oh yea it's going down to 10. Idiot shorts it's 20 premarket now.
If you want to sell to me show the Amazon price and the Kohls price.......now were talking.
"WHAT'S HAPPENING IN KOHL'S TO HAPPEN IN AMC NEXT, AMC EARNINGS THIS WEEK, MILLIONS STUCK"
"I'm not invested but Kohl's will be fine. It's one of the middle classes favorite places to shop for clothes. They'll just have to trim the fat and make some changes, easily done."
Kohl's will start buying back shares under $30. per sources!
Kohls back to 30's when dividend is back.
"the Manipulator dont know what to do, threw it a gorpy trade and she bit on it !!!!"
Sell.Going to 30
"It's a very bad management group if they can't learn from this.LESSON: Don't get closed down again in the fall.They have to be smart enough to get an ""essential business"" status.."
MMs about to show you who is boss lol
Only 2 years 'til the Democrats kick DohTard out of the White House and raise the corporate tax rate once again to make the rich pay their fair share! This will be back to the $40.'s again!
THIS WILL.BE OVER $21 BY THE WEEKEND BUDDY.
Buy Truck Load now
Oh man checked out ULTIMATE STCK ALRT (check them out) and they are killing it .
KSS is soon in the 60s then 70s! Great capital gains and there is the dividend announcement soon!
PUt options are betting below $12 for sure.
"Macy's pays awesome dividend, kss not"
Is the Amazon deal generating any sale in then end?!?
"Well, you guys might order from Amazon, but it will be a cold day in you know where, before I order anything from Amazon. I like going to a store to see and touch what I am buying. I want to try clothes on. Not all sizes are true and the fit is everything in a dress."
Ouch. Your bottoms must be sore
can we break and hold 52?
"dow goes down kss goes down, dow goes up kss DON'T go up,manipulation tactic,ceo-no help!!"
It’s not a good sign that kss is not rallying today
Michael get the vaseline out you need it
We're open!! Come get your Covid 19!! This stock was headed to this price before Covid 19. Their business was already in decline.
should open at 41.60 or close at that level.
"About half a million short shares covered but XRT saw another sizable increase. The stock has been looking good as people don't seem to be to willing to sell and we don't see that pressure on the price from the shorts, except that one day last week.A run at $80 before earnings could be in the cards. Then we will see how cautious they are about the second half of the year. One would think that the stronger dollar helps them as imports become cheaper, we will have to see."
Anyone try to order clothes or anything from Amazon recently or Walmart or Target>Their delivery system is broken down now that it takes weeks to months to get an order filled!Who is going to wait that long?I cancelled all my orders when I learned how long it would take. Instead I bought at Macys and Kohls and got my order in 3 days and I could have gotten it faster by curbside pick up or gone directly into the store and bought today.We stopped buying clothes totally in the last two months because we prefer to buy at a brick and mortar store.Most clothes sales or about 75% has always been at brick an dmortar stores. That will never change.People want to touch and try on clothes before buying. Online clothes sales will never overtake in person brick and mortar sales.This is why in the last two months clothes sales have dropped so radically. People prefer to wait until Macys and Kohls reopened before buying clothes again.We are all having a fun shopping spree this week at Macys and Kohls now that they reopenedTarget and Walmart have never been good places to buy decent clothes. They are just grocery stores mostly with garbage clothes unfit for most reasons.Amazon is broken and its sales will plunge due to its delivery sytem being broken taking two months for an order.Crazy. Who is going to wait two months?Now that Kohls and Macys are reopened good bye to sales at Amazon!
"I love the give and take from you two guys. Very informative. Keep up the good work, and thanks!"
"With Kohl's at a 52 week high, had a great quarter and restored the dividend, and a big boost from Sephora on the way, why would anyone vote for the disruption of all new board members and a change of control????? Not I."
We are off to the races.
My local Kohls have been packed. A lot of Malls not open n most Kohls are stand alone. They will reap the benefits n dont forget Amazon. I could def see a possible acq by them due to the drastic market cap reduction. Either way this is a long term winner!!!
seriously the only retail stock down today???
What is happening ??????
Kohls was pumped and dumped by wall st pros and shills !they caused the naive retailer to bid it up then they unloaded their shares to cause a huge loss by people listening to the crooks !
well that escalated quick....
"Would someone explain this heap of trash , I get it the stock was oversold but I can’t see this going higher in the next few months. People aren’t gonna be running back to these stores"
Cu at 20
I guess I will cancel my kohl’s account as they don’t like republicans only liberals
5500 short
I’m long kss 1000 shares but it’s going downThought there was big news
"this will come back up, right?"
I love short shorts!! Enjoy the spectacle!
"Kramer's scared to death bashing down all stocks and all optimistic value, I think he's lost all credibility with me!"
It is time to lock in profits and prepare for a market correction imo. I just sold all my mutual funds and am still long some biotech names and short on Big Tech.
Up up today!!
Severely undervalued. Free cash flow in 1 year is around $1billion and market cap only $3b?? Debt burden doesn’t look that bad either ...
Kohl's is down 11.93% to 20.65
I will bounce back a couple of bucks by this afternoon...........Quick money to be made on mad panic............
"Getting real tired of other retailers' #$%$ news dragging down this stock. Today it was ANF, but SHLD and JCP have also been a burden on KSS shares."
"Sell your cretin Kohls shares while you still have bids. Redeploy into AMZN. Don't be stupid, don't be prideful, accept reality."
Sell this junk now
"I have been shocked at how expensive it is to shop at Kohls. A shopper really needs to go at the right time, not to get a great price, but to just not get ripped off. I decided to stop wasting my time."
"Love when this drops right when I buy, I think Kohls will be 40+ by the spring tho"
Doomsters are doomed! Good solid corporation with a bright future. Dividend to be declared in days.
"On the bright side, on 4/13 we were at $61.32, 2 down grades and over 3M shares short later we are only at $60.23 and that 3M may even by 5M by the time we get the update for 5/15!"
"Price targets for KSS raised this morningJPMorgan raised to $56 (from $49)Deutsche Bank raised to $62 (from $55)Credit Suisse raised to $58 (from $30) after ""Solid' Q4"
"No rev for a long time? They were open to foot traffic half of last quarter and now opening up again. The stores that have stayed open in my city have been slammed menards, Lowe’s, Meijer. No reason Kohl’s won’t be packed soon as they open the doors and it’s been cited that they are busy in the cities that have reopened."
Fools and their money are soon parted !
Disappointed
Should I take profit now or hold it through earnings?
"A part of the reason for many retail stocks like KSS taking a hit is because of potential tariffs on China. I just looked at the tags on four clothing items I bought at Kohl's in the last year. To my surprise they were made in four different countries and none of which were from China. Does anyone have an idea of what percentage of sales from KSS come from China? Based on my very small and unscientific sample, the tariff threat seems overblown."
A nice try to mask tax-loss selling that will ravage the price in the next week. I love crushing the stupid robinhooders with good shorts!
Covered
Can't wait to browse a store checking out the FLX line. nice work Michelle Gass and team!! The activists have to be recognizing diminishing returns on further efforts at this point. Kohl's is already on a trajectory every investor should like. Let it be.
Gregory you are such a KSS fan boy why not buy more if this is so cheap?
Foolish shorts never listen !
This puppy could jump up $5.00 without warning..........Watch out for Jan 20th...........no.....not Trump's coronation.........but rather Options expiration date...........
Over valued stock that got corrected after earnings
must have missed the bad news
Kohl’s cash is just embrassing.
"Huge over-correction on $KSS. Significant revenue beat. Annual guidance was lowered by 8-9%. On the previous $57, that is a $5-$6 drop that should be accounted for at best. I would expect target 12-month pricing to drop to $51-52. A 8-10% upside from the current $48 price."
Kohl's stock price target cut to $26 from $45 at Deutsche Bank
It looks to me that Kohl’s stock has broken out of this wedge pattern and may test $70 and then I have to go back 3 years to the old head and shoulders pattern and the ultimate test around $80. In conclusion it’s early. The street is finally warming up to Kohl’s. I think that if everything goes perfect $80 level may be tested around the holidays. It will be very choppy.
This board is just as euphoric / over optimistic as the Apple board was a few weeks ago. History repeats itself. I am neither long or short but this is not good.
"KSS is very profitable. Last quarter in spite of extreme head winds of covid they posted a PROFIT!Profitable companies dont go bankrupt. Instead they restore the dividend, pay off debt and their stock appreciates."
"If this ain't the time to buy, I don't know what is."
"e-commerce rise 60% and only 25% less sales than last year:), now Q3 with improved e-commerce and the rise of retail sales as reported in the news many times they will beat last year revenue and Q4 Hollidays shopping with much less competition from many companies that close this stock will go back to $60 before end of the year, we don’t even need vaccine for that"
Back to 40s. No way this stock will hold with market manipulation by some weird news. give it 2 weeks. Bearish trend will emerge.
interesting up and down this morning...any thoughts?
8% drop from high in 1 hour ouch
What is going on with this stock?
Kohl's is down 6.58% to 32.37
Holding this one into earnings reporting is always tough. Never learn my lesson. Should have sold it all yesterday and picked up much cheaper shares today.
"5 days since we heard from 4mvp, maybe that is a good sign. Of course there was weekend in there but at least with a reduced shorted share count and an increasing stock price signaling a bottom, we might be getting rid of the pros willing to pay someone to spam bulletin boards. 4mvp does a good job those, nice pictures."
"TJX and JCP also reported not so good quarters, so maybe it is industry wide and that will mitigate a bit the hit. Target tomorrow will be important. Also whether their guidance takes into accounts tariffs."
home office is booming people are spending more money by updating the homes and home goods. in addition to the dissapearance or pier 1 imports and jcp and Newman Marcus KSS has green light for making money. moreover AMZN.WINK WINK
KSS is looking oversold. IMO
Sadly I will have to pass on buying KSS this morning. Nice dividend and now good potential upside but I see even better buys.
Just hit a 52-week high. Let's hope for a strong day!
"Macy's is breaking out and the charts of all of the big name retailers like Kohl's, Sears and JCP are all looking pretty decent as far as putting in a bottom. So Macy's may well be the tell here as it breaks out to new highs. Someone here made a case to dump Kohl's and buy Macy's and certainly that is looking like it wasn't a bad idea at all. I think at some point Kohl's will break out to but that can't happen till after Q1 earnings and may even take Q2. The big deal will be the growth rate in earnings from 2018 to 2019. If analysts start taking up 2019 earnings the bull case becomes much much stronger."
"Looks like the friends and family is spooking some because the idiot CFO basically framed it as F&F being responsible for all of the revenue gain. Reality is that bad weather accounted for 1% of revenue as well, so the overall revenue gain for Kohl's adjusting for weather and F&F would be 1-2%. That is solid.The good news is really that taxes are really boosting earnings. Earnings are up 26.7% because of the impact of taxes, that means the benefit is all flowing to the bottom line. On the stock buyback they bought back 1.1M shares and they said any extra cash flow will be flowing into the buyback. So very positive news. The stock may drop for a day or two but then the buyback will start ticking in and at some point shorts will cover. They can't just keep shorting to drive the stock down to make themselves look good."
Pretty clear the rich are pulling their money out of leisure/travel and putting it in tech to manipulate the market. and now shorts are doing their thing. be sure to buy when you get a price you like. $PLAY $KSS $CAKE $ERI $CCL $SPR
Here comes the drop
All companies now need to post rent as debt - new law/rule.
I'll let it ride as I've done for the last year but this will probably go back to low 40's before climbing to the mid 60s. It's just the up and down gyrations this stock goes through.
Kohls has benefited from partnership with Amazon. Could even be a take over target for them. Buy and hold for long term.
MyPillows are 10 times the price of a regular pillow and they SUX

"Goodbye Kohl's, it was nice knowing you....."
"Stage Stores, which operates department store brands including Gordmans, Bealls and Goody’s, is preparing for a bankruptcy filing that could come as soon as next week. Kohl's happening next???"
Man... this becoming a toss up between retailers!!! Did Macy’s set the bar too high for the rest ??I didn’t think Nordstrom’s report was bad at all to drop 7%Hopefully Kohl’s won’t disappoint !!!
Did KSS suspend its dividend also?
Where are those losers that said they were going to buy at nine last Friday when this was at 11? They missed some big gains.
"Read KSS balance sheet, ignore Walls Street. So many fools and fraudsters taking this down. The projected earnings miss was baked in at $52!"
Sure looks like its bail on Kohls day today!Smart money selling off in droves! Yikes!
WOW!! They kicked butt!! Man! It is nice to own a stock that has fantastic news. EXCELLENT!!
"I am completely Baffled by Kohls.Does any one really think they are going to shred Christmas this year.We are in retail / internet and are having huge problems acquiring all our inventory on time. This is a huge problemOh well, I have NO position in KohlsNor do I plan to acquire at this time or any time soon I would think"
"Kohl’s has the ok Boomer, Sears Kmart vibe all over it. How is this over 5 bucks a share? Wonder what their monthly burn rate is..."
"You dump KSS, I will buy it at 18.50 for couple thousands shares. Enjoy the sell off."
Short 5000 shares here cha cha ching
"Buy on thr dips here. Sephora coming, dividend will retun 2nd half of 21 and its back to $60 with a 3pct yield just like thatoryou could blow your money on SnowflakeTrust Adviceinvest"

"Any sellers at this point are misinformed. 19 billion revenue and 800 million earnings in 2019 with a 5%+ divi and PE of 10???? I am holding for the long term divi. PT $53. They dont even need to grow at this point, just maintain margins. Start reading balance sheets and ignoring Wall Street, Kohls is a well managed company that always redefines itself."
its like a bouncing ball up and down .... it became trading stock
The Dow is up almost 450+ and the stock goes south. I think it's a lot of short selling IMO.
Beat and raise.
will close at 58 today atleast.
"May 6th KSS was $69.06, June 4th $50.06! 1 Month people!How many years of dividends will that take to get back? Ouch!"
I see some computer traders wanna sell off retail this morning before G20 and book gains from last weeks rally... let em sell retail has been so oversold it's just stupid. I hope it stays down here so when the buybacks come it comes hard.

"Another 2.6M shares covered and we are down to 22.7M. That is a good sign as the stock has likely now shown the shorts that this is a bottom. Dillards also got an upgrade from sell to neutral, another sign that the pros may be thinking retail has been savaged enough. With the S&P breaking out to new highs we might also see a short covering rally as the shorts cover their failed positions and wait for their next opportunity down the road. That might also help Kohl's, though next weeks retail sales and Q2 earnings are likely much more critical. I don't see retail sales being weak and that should be enough to get a bid on the retailers. Q2 earnings with the debt buyback and the stock buyback also should be a positive if the weakness was indeed sector wide and not Kohl's specific (which I think is the case). If there was just a lull in retail in March/April, well then we might see a nice rally later this year in the stock, especially if shorts continue to cover and remove the selling pressure from the stock. Already we shouldn't have many sellers left, so once they stop manipulating the stock and we get some buying interest, we should see nice gains before the end of the year."
"manipulating funds are artificially pushing it down,kohl's stores are packed every day."

"if potus is serious about Easter reopen, then KSS will resurrect. do you believe in miracles?"
whoever holding why you become that much GReddy. Think about trading stock not long-term holding like tech.
"Listened to the investor presentation. Not much there really that they haven't said. Looks like a dividend increase and more stock buybacks and they said they were going to roll out more use of store space when they downsize the stores. Apparently they can reduce inventory by 10% with the smaller footprint but keep virtually the same revenue generation. I took it to mean they likely will expand the Amazon partnership but it could just mean that they are looking for other businesses to use that spare space.Nothing surprising other than the senile CEO couldn't remember that their investor conference call will be on March 1st, he kept talking about the update in February."
The Healthcare bill debacle increases the odds that the Border adjustment tax may not make it through the congress either. I would start loading up on retailers.
"So why is this stock not moving up given its stellar earnings performance and guidance over the last 3 months. We are barely up this year and significantly under performing the S&P. One reason people may not be yet willing to give this stock its proper multiple is that analysts earnings projections are very low. Last year we could compare 2017 earnings to 2019 projections and that earnings growth looks stellar thanks to the tax cuts. This year we compare the 2018 earnings to the 2020 projections and analysts are just expecting a 10% increase in earnings. That doesn't warrant a very high multiple. Now granted, the stock does have a huge dividend, so if you add that in to the normal x1.5 multiple you give to earnings as this factor will tell you how much more in earnings you will have in 4 years, we would get a 7.5 multiple plus a nearly 4% dividend, giving you an x11.5 potential return multiple for the stock. Using the $5.60 in earnings that gets you right about where we are, i.e. fair value and no buying interest. So if analysts are right, the stock is fairly priced. There is one thing not factored into this calculation and that is the stock buybacks. If Kohl's buys back $500M in stock a year and the stock price stays near current levels that will be about 4% of outstanding shares a year, that boosts the earnings growth from 5% to 9%, throw in the 1.5 multiple and the dividend and now suddenly you have x17.5 multiple for the stock. So if Kohl's can buy back 4% of outstanding shares a year and grow their earnings by 5% to boot we would certainly have a highly undervalued stock. So that is the question, does their guidance of 0-2% revenue growth and improved margins give you the confidence they can produce actual earnings growth of 5%. That is doable if they hit 2%, if they hit the midpoint, we likely only would see 3%, so that the stock buyback is required to boost reported earnings. Indeed, the companies guidance takes this into account, only it uses 0% revenue growth and no earnings growth to achieve its guidance, it simply factors in the interest rates savings and buying back less than 4% of its stock to achieve its target range.Kohl's is grossly undervalued if the economy continues to grow, it can continue to grow revenue at 2% a year and it continues to buy back shares. You get nearly a 4% dividend while you wait for that to play out. Oh, and there is always that short position that in itself would raise the stock price by over 20% if it were reduced to about 5M shares, which I consider a more neutral short position level."
"You shouldn't worry so much about Kohl's selling off on non Kohl's news as this will simply mean that they buy back more shares with their share buyback. So far this year you have not seen the effect of the buyback because more shares have been shorted than have been bought back. Shorts haven't covered those positions in any meaningful manner yet, which means there is a lot of upside in this stock if the company can deliver. Also there is quite a bit of downside protection to protect that dividend, which by the way the shorts have to pay."

"2.55M shares covered between 10/15 and 10/31. Clearly these are pros as the stock price dropped in that time frame. In any case this is two reporting period in a row with reduced short shares and a sizable increase from the first to the second. I assume we will have had a bit of covering yesterday and maybe even when they took it down earlier in the week. With the exhaustion gap we had yesterday the number of sellers should have shrunk dramatically, that is going to make it very tough to cover a large portion of the 32.9M shares still short on the stock. I think a short squeeze before the end of the year is very likely."

"Boy I'm glad I sold my KSS.....back in Feb......Yet after listening to this I'm not buying back. 1#...the Pandemic is a cluster (f) at this point. 2#....It was a bit scary listening to the CEO. It did not give me confidence in her ability , when it was abundantly clear by late March early April the (s) was gonna hit the fan, to for see near future economic condition and plan appropriately."

"8/31 short position down 1.4M shares, so the move up after earnings likely was significantly driven by that. We did have some more shorting of XRT though and Macy's also saw an increase. So some are getting nervous on Kohl's but it still seems like the big boys like to short this sector. My guess is no short covering rally yet, though I think we might see it before Q4 earnings in late February or early March."
this is all shorts people don't sell like this going into a Christmas season that's going to be one of the biggest ever
Incredible cheap buying opportunity for KSS stock today. How long can this stock be this cheap. Not much longer!!
"So the retail sell-off will be bad as usual today as Macy's also missed. I think this is actually what we want because we need retailers to go under to release their customer bases for Kohl's to conquer. As long as the company can maintain a healthy buyback in this multi year weeding out of the retail sector and remain solidly profitable there should be huge dividends for investors down the road and you get a nice dividend while you wait.This is clearly another chance to buy more shares, though I know we all likely should have sold at $45 so we could buy back this much lower. Also Remember the dividend on the 6th will knock the share price down $0.55 but that will be while they buy back stock as the lockup period ends at the end of this week."
KSS reached a 52 Week low at 49.50

Fantastic outlook.
"To our new shorts, likely all bought by the pros to convince us to give them our shares as cheap as possible.Here is the damning case against shorting Kohl's:1) nearly 20% of the stock is already short which depresses the stock price by at least 20%2) the corporate tax cut will increase earnings by over 20% next year and forward3) Kohl's aggressively buys back stock, almost 50% over the last 5 years no less4) 2017 to 2016 comps show a company that is growing, not dieing5) Amazon is gonna kill retail, just like Tesla is going to kill the big autos, is all hype, the reality is very very different. Most of the losses to traditional retailers are NOT coming from Amazon, they are coming from dollar stores, which is still retail6) We are getting a new CEO and she is a woman, women tend to increase shareholder value more than men7) and just in case you missed it, Amazon is already realizing they need a footprint. Whole Foods is a start, Kohl's likely will do that for clothing and retail. That means a buyout at $95 (which is fair value by the way), is a possibility you must factor in. So if you can afford to be short when this stock pops to $95, that is probably your top loss level."
"Well, now this is some overreaction"
I hate to see the stock drop after a blockbuster earnings
"So this looks like a big covering rally on retail in general. Any ideas on how long and how far this can run? I think a test of $80 has to be in here, especially if there hasn't been that much covering as of 5/31. As to taking profits, selling the slightly out of the money leaps for 2020 isn't a bad bet, the $80's were at $9+ so that gives you $14 of upside plus 7 dividend payments on a ~$75 base. That's not bad money for 19 months."
will this dip into the 18 ish price by weeks end?
Why would anyone sell? https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kohls-results/kohls-tops-same-store-sales-estimates-raises-forecast-idUSKCN1NP1BM
"Sure is tough to get KSS down, shorting it is almost the only way they can accomplish that. So unless we get some terrible retail news I see little that can drag this stock price down over the next month or so till Q1 earnings. Since Kohl's already lowered guidance they should easily be able to meet or beat even if things did slow down."

So many of these foolish retail CEOS show up at the White House and sing about what a great meeting they had with Trump only to have the border tax brought back into the spotlight right after they left. The retailers share prices today say it all. Maybe a few GOP members went short yesterday after the meeting.
"I think this will run up to 21$ again and down back to 17.50 the s&p gonna retest it’s highs if it breaks through then this may do well, but I believe s&p will top out again at 3000 then sell off again this time to 2.500 when that happens this stock will be 14, so sell at 21, buy back in at 14$"

closing price predictions for today anyone? I’m going to say it dips as low as $53 and closed at $55. I hope I’m being too pessimistic.

If MIK continues at its current pace and KSS keeps declining it won’t be long before MIK has a bigger market cap. Good luck to everyone
"People need to understand that depreciation in excess of CapEx is just tax free extra earnings no one notices. Kohl's last year made almost $400M more in cash than they reported in earnings. That is why they were able to buy back nearly $400M, issue nearly $400M in dividends and buy back nearly $1T in debt."
Looks like we are bottoming.
Good time to buy. Stock has bottomed short term. Back to $60. Swing trade baby!
KSS is down 10.91% to 14.12
Not been here since I sold at $45 but I was buying at $37. You are all scrambling for small margins at this level. Where were you all when the price was $37 and you should have been buying. You should all now be looking at other stocks trading at multi year lows as was KSS last year.
Amazon is building their own stores. kss will be outdated and back to 20s. Sell the hype.

"KSS has been suffering from two major problems that have now disappeared.First, Trump slapped a massive tariff on everything KSS sells of 25% due to this insane very harmfultrade war with China, the Europeans and everyone you can think of.Secondly, we have the covid problem.Both of these problems are going to disappear and KSS will return to its pre trade war and pre covid prices of about $80/share.First thing Biden plans to do is reverse ALL of Trumps actions. Biden is going to eliminate all tariffs and by that time we will be distributing millions of doses of a proven highly effective covid vaccine from Pfizer.Today they announced the vaccine is more than 90 percent effective at preventing infection to those who never had it.That means once enough of us have been given the vaccine our population will have herd immunity.Life will go back to normal very fast, which is huge positive for retailers like Macys and KSS as well as other stocks like GE. On the reverse side it is a strong negative to stocks who benefited from the trade war and covid.You shorts of these stocks are going to lose everything. Macys, KSS are perfect short squeezes.Look how much these stocks are shorted."
What's driving the rise today? Any ideas? wish I wouldve picked some up below 67 this morning

"Never expected the analysts to continue their attacks on the retail sector meanwhile continuing to pump the tech sector. Highly irresponsible of them, we already have AMD at a P/E of over 260 and OLED approaching 100. Simply amazing how they are setting this market up for a major collapse based on only the tech and the industrial sectors, meanwhile most other sectors are still at multiples much lower than the average P/E of the indices."

"More short covering as we are now down to 18.35M shares, that is about 1.3M covered in the first half of December. So the number of shares in the float that can be traded is shrinking nicely if you add in the buyback. If Kohl's can put up a solid Q4 I think the stock will move up nicely. The question now is how good were holiday sales for them."
Rising with good volume. A break of 74.24 could move it up to 86.71. http://www.foxchart.com/share/759928445.png
You have got to be kidding me. How can you idiots pay up double what this stock was selling for a month ago? Kohls was dead in the water before the pandemic and their balance sheet was better back than yet the stock price is higher now than before the pandemic. Bunch of fools are going to get crushed paying these prices.
"The news today will give AMZN investors something to worry about. Clearly the drop in on-line retail sales puts into question the entire thesis that on-line retail will soon dominate retail. Further, Amazon's weak guidance post Q4 earnings now doesn't just seem like it was the conservative thing to do. Taken in the context of the announcement of the HQ2 in New York one can only surmise that Amazon's sees some growth problems. Most likely they are reviewing their business and see that there are a lot of businesses that they are in that are not really businesses but simply welfare projects. One can shutter those and move that personal to somewhere more productive and that makes opening more HQ2's unnecessary.For Kohl's, especially if retailers show solid earnings over the coming weeks and the January retail sales report (likely in a week or two) dispels the idea of a consumer recession, this should turn out to be a blessing in disguise."
"There is a myth about e-commerce that it is eating brick and mortars lunch. This is simply not true as you can see form the data posted at, as in-store sales grew strongly in 2017 compared to 2016, this despite the gains of e-commerce. Indeed in real dollar terms brick and mortar grew at three times the rate of e-commerce, that makes it very difficult to ever catch up!https://www.census.gov/retail/mrts/www/data/pdf/ec_current.pdfIndeed, looking at the % of total retail sales from e-commerce we may even have seen the plateau which may be below 10% of total sales. 2018 will be interesting to follow because it may wall start to show this."

"Interesting news on the short interest as of 4/30. There was a lot of covering on XRT, like 6.3M shares but interestingly there was a massive increase in short shares on Kohl's to over 29M this in a time when the stock price actually increased from $70 to over $71! So this would mean the 16M volume spike day was a day they shorted massively, not covered. Next weeks retail sales and Kohl's earnings are going to be very interesting now. If the shorts are now on the hook for buying a lot more shares and over the last few days it doesn't look like there was much covering, though maybe some. At 29M shares the % of shares short has now increased to nearly 18%, that is a lot of fuel for an upside move."
This is a great company ! I have my credit card bills to PROVE IT !
Could this really go from 30’s to teens in a couple days?! Idk. World is crazy all of a sudden. It would like 1998 prices. Or earlier.
Found some interesting information regarding shorts for $KSS https://marketwirenews.com/short-information/NYSE/KSS
"Kohls has locked into a strategy that has them neatly tucked between the Targets, Amazons and Walmarts of the world. Great leadership team and sound business plan. I have a strong feeling we will see another big beat and stock spike strongly up."
Have patience guys......70 by May long weekend :)
"Trump declaring a Nation Emergency over a self proclaimed hoax, should surely get people to Kohl's for that new spring top!"
3 days until the ex-date if you want in on next dividend
People are so tired of being told not to do this or that and not to go out and have fun! They are going to mob the retailers and have a nationwide party.
"On the 10 day Intra-day chart, The reverse CUP & HANDLE pattern has formed.Expect the next leg down to the low 16's and then well into the 15's by Friday. DO NOT HOLD.Sell today at any price and buy back in at a lower price."
"Wow, I was buying at $37 when you could not give the stock away. For those buying at the high today, where were you then? Sold at $44. just wondering."
People you know the CEO is waiting to announce great results and the dividend for March 1st!! Right? That will electrify the stock upward!
"Kohl's, Best all around store in America, linked with Amazon, can't get any better than that!!"
"Glad Kohl's dropped MyPillow. As far as I'm concerned, it's a toxic brand."
"Put trading option detected in Kohl’s. A big flow into put trading option was noticed in Kohl’s. Several traders bought over 6,400 puts for several strike prices: $51.50 (December 29th) …http://thestockmarketinfo.com/put-trading-option-detected-in-kohls/"
"If you can go for groceries then you can go for clothes shopping as well. The main question is going to be whether people will have the money to spend on discretionary items once all this is over. Lots of folks have been badly hit financially by this crisis. Given this scenario, is the current valuation justified is the question. I think even with these headwinds KSS is quite undervalued at this price point."
Holy #$%$. Aldi's is being added to some Kohl's stores. I love Aldi's!! That's pretty awesome.
Cramer just bought KSS.
For those who shorted the stock!
"Big increases in the short positions of XRT and KSS (both almost 3M each) in the first half of February. That should explain the price drop from $68.69 to $65.93. Since then the stock has drifted up a bit, which is likely an indication that the shorting stopped around 2/22 when we closed at the low in the period. So unless they short more, the price naturally drifts back up to its new equilibrium. The shorts do at some point need to cover again and that will push the stock price up. So the selling has been absorbed and the stock price has already recovered, that means the shorts failed to gain ground.Likely they were shorting heavily going into retailer earnings hoping the weak Dec retail sales numbers would show up in the final results. Clearly that hasn't happened so far. JCP is up tomorrow, that could give retail another big boost if they don't disappoint. As to Kohl's, they normally do better than Macy's and Kohl's did guide up for the quarter at the start of the year, so I think they will deliver solid results, i.e. meet or beat estimates, and should guide 2019 earnings up, especially if they factor in the buyback, which is what they did last year as well. So they guide up and then give themselves an out by mentioning that this includes the likely buying back of shares."
CNBC retail expert picked Kohl's as the one speculative retail stock to buy. Today's program.
Good news is coming shortlywait and watch
"ATTENTION KOHL'S INSIDERS,, BUY your stock like crazy,, BURY these puny day shorts !!!!!!!!"
Covered my shorts for a 22k gain E Z MONEY
Dropping below the 50 dma is not a good sign for KSS
Lands End and Kohls need each other.
talked to mgmt associates in OH stores and was surprised to hear sales were much higher than anticipated since reopening....told customers are aggressively buying up products.....customer numbers are not extremely high but avg ticket bill per customer has been higher than usual since reopening ...
do you think the amzn news will help or hurt KSS stock...or neither?
"Sorry guys; you got it ALL wrong. You see, I saw the ""retail pops by 105%"" or whatever that crazy data point was a few days ago, felt that kss, which I've waiting an eternity to buy at $14, would sky and I'd never get it, and bought it. At like $22. So THAT'S why it's tanked ever since, guys; every time I buy. So I apologize for buying and causing this drop but thought I should let you know. This also means it'll go to $14 now, so hold tight boyz!!"
If KOHL’s starts selling BLM T-shirts. They are DONE!!!
hitting $46 today
just busted the 20 nut....everythings ok
$65. share for under 4% yield? Oh Right! The blind leading the blind! Kinda like Trumptards!
They know what is wrong. With the announcement of a knew merchandising mgr.for women's the stock will soar.They said it is well under way.
Trying to bleed.winners
SIG 2
Shorted another 2000 shares. When they report earnings your butts will be so sore you won't be able to walk. Man are you chasers stupid.
Will be down 25% by next earning
Hello Precious! It's about time.
Amazon uses 10 KSS stores to market Alexa and other devices. This is the retail presence Amazon has been speaking of. They will buy KSS if the trial works for north of $60.00/share
Every Kohl’s I ever walked into is dead. Literally massive stores and 10 customers. If pps goes up I’d be shocked
Market always does opposite of what i do..so just bought some puts let's see if it continues down
"KSS is a bubble, specially when going bankrupt"
This will be riding back up. Watch and see.
Why the two day whacking? Any theories?
Owning this stock is cruel and unusual punishment....
"Up and down, up and down"
"Short position down nearly 3M shares to 19.8M, so this stock can run because the sellers have been absorbed and the available float is shrinking."
Just beginning see 70 at least.Kohls is packed in my neighborhood. It's not only ex military
CEO thought it was good idea selling BLM t-shirts last summer. Now discontinuing My Pillow? What the hell is wrong with her???? Obviously a socialist style of management.
so no real buyback in process here huh
"When will the shorts enter today? they ruin the price, can't wait till it opens up $$5.00 or more!!"
"AS one person once said, all you need to fear is fear itself.Let Fear be the other guys problem. Sometimes, all one has to do is be patient to succeed as Buffet said. KSS is a case in point."
KSS reached a 52 Week low at 33.54
"So what exactly is this investor group saying, the current board is lining their own pockets instead of investors' pockets? Personally I like what the CEO has done the past 12 months. With the except the $600M loan at pretty steep interest rates but that could be replaced with a new bond."
sell now while it is high
"From the update on the short position as of 4/15 it looks like XRT added another 1.8M shares and Kohl's about 200k. So they were still shorting earlier in the month. It will be interesting to see how much they have covered since (hope they are covering) when we get the 4/30 report in early May. Today's action, the bounce of the 200 dma would indicate to me that some shorts are using that as a bottom to cover and as the price action over the next few weeks shows that the 200 dma will hold, well that might get us back to the $80's before earnings."
New high of the day at the close and close enough to my 20.73 range call. Hope you fools covered it's going up up and away from here
Lol sell and buy jcp or m
Kohls Department credit card will ruin your credit score!
"Only half a million shares covered in the run from 1/1-1/15, likely meaning they reshorted earlier in the period then covered as the price rose. So we have 27M shares still short at this high stock price. Plenty more ammo and of course still no short squeeze baby!"
It was cut from $50 price target to $25 today...hence the rally because people saw there was still value from the current low...however....it's $19 right now....take profits because with them selling bonds to stay afloat and stores that were already hurting before this virus...it just does not make sense imo. I am happy with a 20% ROI especially on something that's in a hurting industry.
" ( (( ((( Looks like Khol's is setting up to be the ""TESLA"" of Department stores. It's starting to move up off it's base price of $43.30 of recent. Should see a nice spike up after latest earning's numbers."
"More sales catalysts coming soon to Kohls.Kohl's is set to benefit from 250+ Bon-Ton's store closures, particularly the liquidation of regional department store operator Bon-Ton Stores. The last Bon-Ton stores will close in July or August, putting $2.5 billion of annual sales up for grabsThirty-five percent of Bon-Ton's stores are within a mile of a Kohl's location, and 80% have a Kohl's store within 10 miles. This puts Kohl's in position to be one of the biggest winners from Bon-Ton's bankruptcy, particularly because most Kohl's stores aren't in malls that could suffer traffic declines as anchor tenants like Bon-Ton close"
"KSS has performed well since management kicked the poor-performing pillow guy to the curb. In fact, I will start buying stuff at KSS because of management's brave decision. Really, though, the decision was just good business. It's not good to stock slow-moving merchandise!"
kiss is about to blow upthe most juiciest of news would be the likelihood of partnership with Amazon
"Likewise, surest way to lose money is to buy the hottest stocks with the best appreciation in the last quarter.Past performance is no indication of future performance."
A dollar a day works for me. At this rate we will reach 85 by end of the month.
Any chance Amzn empties its pocket change and buys KSS? Rumors?
Kohl's is down 13.01% to 24.75
Boycott this #$%$ company!!!
"So what's up, revolver expected to be paid back and Divi NOT in jeopardy???"
Going Forward in Reverse!
I remember KSS doing the same thing either last earnings release or the one before. Dipped on great numbers. It was a great buying opportunity then. I'm buying now!
KSS reached a new 52 Week High at 58.67
"KSS dipped into the high $15s today. Seems like all the pumpers have convinced each other this thing is hitting the mid $20s simply by the stores reopening.I guess I’m confused, did the lock down close Kohl’s online sales opportunities? Many other companies have figured out how to be successful selling the same type of products as Kohl’s with zero brick and mortar locations. Yeah, Amazon wants to get into a debt laden disaster with 1100 locations who have more or less proven themselves incapable of adapting to an online strategy."
"Lol I bought 5,000 for $61,240 back in May!!!! It’s $230,000 today!!!! Hahahaha!!!!!!"
"its done for now , hit its higher- target, buy back at 25"
j cp and kss virtually same store
Getting close to good entry point to short. Even when kohls reopens their stores there will be little traffic. They dont sell anything essential. Short term expect stock to hit resistance at $20 then go back to $13. Also expect a secondary offering as Kohls will be forced to issue new stock and new debt to pay for their mountain of debt due.
"Surprised we didn't get a bigger move up on Friday after all retail sales for ONLINE went down last month, not up. Further, on-line retail sales are still not 15% of total retail sales, so I think it is pretty safe to say they will likely take forever to get to even 20%. So the demise of retail due to on-line retailers is way overhyped and especially for Kohl's that also has on-line sales."
I am buying here
Is that $KSS CEO as hot in real life as she looks on TV?
"I really hate saying goodbye to jcp Sears and a few others, kohl's will be left with out any competition!"
"Last year there was a rumor that AMZN might buy KSS; anytruth to this rumor? In any event bought 500 shares of KSS.Added to my GPK, position."
I thought this company just announced blowout earnings. Their stock is tanking. What gives?
picked up 23.50 puts at .60 per sold for 1.10 per. EASY MONEY KIDDIES! Will flip it again once this bounce maxes out before falling under 22. Gap at 21.60 needs to fill before this can go up in a healthy fashion.
Consumer Credit's increase fell from$17.9 billion to $12.3 billion. This was short of expectations for a $15.5 billion increase $KSS $V
"Don't think so Go Pack. Never should have shorted it. Futuresare up and when the Tax Bill passes, it's headed to $60."
Hope you guys locked those profits in! This is going to bleed dry! The pump is over!
Even shoplifters know Kohls has nothing worth stealing
"Honestly, I am just glad JB covered and didn't wait till mid February. Well let us hope he did, 4k shares with a $53 break even price has to hurt."
Which one is the better buy? Macy's=thumbs up Kohl's=thumbs down $M $KSS Feel free to discuss with comments.
Hello Green. You were sorely missed.
sell it PUNK
Boycott kss since they have sold out to Amazon. I was in Kohls last week to spend a gift card I had and that will be my last trip to Kohls ever since they have sold out to the enemy.
KSS stock is on a mission!
Since Kohls has a Amazon presence why dont they just let Apple move in and maybe a Samsung booth and maybe Microsoft too........it means they are scrambling folks and nothing else.
This Michael idiot is getting his a handed to him. Someone buy him a large jar of Vaseline from Costco
Isn't the Holiday Season coming? I guess not. No one is buying anything this year based on the performance of the retail sector. At least I know that Wall Steet made their money this year.
"Well not to bad of a setup going into earnings. Hopefully Monday we rally to the 200 dma and then earnings will dictate whether we break above and stay above I hope (always hate those beats and down 10-20% earnings days though). There will be a few things to watch for in the actual report:1) do they guide up for 2019, which they should given the debt buyback2) do they increase the dividend by 4cents or more?3) The 2018 gap between depreciation and CapEx and whether depreciation is starting to decline or not (hidden earnings potential here)4) The size of the buyback, do they increase it from $300-$400M in 2018 now that they should have stronger cash flow5) cash flow! and how they will use that extra cash"
If Kohls dropping in November then March will see $28
how long will it be before the brothers loot one of there stores
finally.a rally in kr sell and lock in profits
Never would I sell my KSS shares at these low prices to the activists!! KSS is dirt cheap at these prices!!
This docthis stock only disappoints every quarter
The chart is going to end up as a big U today to welcome the rally next week!
Tuesdays a pumping day before tomorrow’s job report dumping day. Rinse and repeat week after. Wall Street gimmick to take your money and run.
The real question is. How many longs were smart enough to buy under 20? My guess very few.
My concern is holding into earnings but I am so underwater I will have to ride this out. Zacks did not have anything positive to say going into earnings. I am long.
"Sometimes a down day can be a very good day, like today. We dropped significantly less than the market and with very low volume. That means a lack of sellers of Kohl's stock and of course a lack of shorting. This bodes well for the months ahead as we may even get some short covering if this is another big correction in the market."
"For all of you buyers out there at this price, where were you last year when it was $36? Will you never learn to sell on good news and buy on bad?"
Congrats to all those who bought yesterday. Sure glad I did. See you all at $70
Kss is junk. No pricing power. Sell
fire sale!
"Sephora deal is a game changer. They are splitting profits 50/50 as part of deal. Even Jim Cramer this morning on CNBC said the deal will mean an additional $1 Billion in revenue annually to KSS bottom line!!! We all know Jim Cramer is not a KSS fan so for him to call it a game changer is huge ... As for the low volume and price still raising reflects the raise is not from Robinhood fools day trading. The raise is from funds buying and hold for long term. 18%Short interest still, just wait until KSS brings back the dividend and shorts will have to pay it if they are still short. The future is bright and KSS is going to be a long term winner even from these levels"
"Analysts agree that Amazon cannot compete head to head with Costco, Walmart and Target without a huge brick and mortar presence. Fact is ONLINE sales are limited and will be forever. The bulk of retail sales will remain at the brick and mortar stores. Online competition is fierce because it is easy to compete ONLINE as it takes little funds to open an online business to compete with Amazon and ONLINE sales are only 25% of the total retail annual sales with brick and mortar still commanding the biggest chuck of annual retail sales at 75%.Amazon has no choice if it wants to compete but to buy into a huge brick and mortar retail business like KSS which has the largest department store business in the USA."
buy at these levels
A few months ago when I was buying at $36 you could almost not give the shares away. Now people are happy to invest at $56. The world is full of no minds. I sold at $45 but not worried. These very lemmings will sell their shares sub $40 in May. Sheeeeesh.
Does anyone remember when $BONTQ was at the top of the retail industry?
"Waiting for $10, increase from my earlier $9 buy price. Expect it by Memorial Day latest"
Kohls gonna test that 46.02 low that she hit on the big down day?
Can't get any cheaper than this!
why isnt KSS following the Dow back up this afternoon?
"Sears has filed, will be done by the end of the year, so a positive for 2019. Weak retail sales likely will mean Q3 won't be a huge upside surprise but I think management has taken down expectations enough already so they will beat on all fronts. This is all going to come down to the holidays and how strong they are, which means the run in the stock likely won't happen till post black Friday sales."
"I got my 2000 sh nothing else matters, long to stay get use to it!"
"Big annoucement, KSS is partnering with giant grocery store Aldi...http://www.businessinsider.com/kohls-adding-aldi-to-its-stores-2018-3"
Think we will be seeing 50 before long !
KSS is down -4.94% to 75.03
Down due to prime day announcement.
The board of directors are going to be replaced by an activist consortium. this stock is going to rise quicker than gme
"Kudos to the CEO for giving up salary. Before even touching the dividend. But it'll go to, whatever it takes to get through this. Good idea for the 2-hour pickup in stores."
"I see! KSS partnered with Eddie Bauer in fall, more expensive and better clothings.great outlook for the company.Looking forward to see Spring!"
"Last night the short interest for 8/31 was reported and again Kohl's was heavily shorted in that time period. So what we have here is the making of a major short squeeze similar to Dillards recent run. The announced partnership with Amazon on the 6th is what got this party started and it is just getting started. We are now into the big gap up area from last fall, closing that gap will happen at a minimum. The question then becomes how spooked do the shorts start to get as so far they have kept shorting (well not since the 6th).One thing people need to understand, Kohl's has been buying back stock aggressively the last few quarters but that buying has been offset by a sizable increase in the short position. At some point the shorts will toss in the towel if the stock stays at these levels since in a few months the 200 dma will turn north again as well. Then they will be faced with a big supply problem as a stock trending up with a nice dividend isn't likely to be sold cheaply."
"I read a report today that Amazon's e-tailing business may disappoint this holiday season, ""In its third quarter 2017 results, Amazon issued guidance which showed that its e-commerce operations could indeed lose money in Q4. Management said revenue for the fourth quarter would be between $56 billion and $60.5 billion. Operating income was forecast to be between $300 million and $1.65 billion. At the lower end of the operating income forecast, Amazon's e-commerce business will almost certainly lose money, and AWS's operating income will be necessary to drive a positive bottom line for the company as a whole"". It will become clearer and clearer that Amazon's e-commerce business will not be as profitable as people believe. It is just common sense...more and more retailers have omnichannel strategies...it is more and more clearer that amazon's exclusively e-commerce business is becoming a disadvantage due to higher shipping cost including higher return cost due to their lack of brick and mortar stores. 15% of products are returned and for apparel it is 30%. Here's a personal example, we ordered thru amazon a pair or lacoste shoes for an exchange gift item The pair of shoes we received was size 7 though we thought it was size 9. In any case the shoe size was wrong and we had to return the product to amazon. I then went to a nearby outlet center Lacoste store and found a size 9, problem solved. But, amazon lost money in the transaction as the product was returned and they had 0 revenue while they had shipping out expense and return expense. Amazon will be pressured to buy a bric and mortar company this year in early 2018 because the competition will surely keep on improving their omnichannel strategies. KSS has no hassle order on line pick up in-store in a couple of hours service, which Amazon lacks; KSS has in-store return which FedEX says preferred by customers and which Amazon lacks; KSS has in-store return and the opportunity to exchange for another plus the opportunity to buy other product while in the store, which amazon lacks. So, Amazon is lacking and/or missing opportunities by not having a brick and mortar store. While there report says, AWS's operating income will be necessary to drive a positive bottom line for Amazon as a whole, if you follow what is being said of Microsoft web services, I would be very nervous if I owned any AMZN shares because this quarter mays show the vulnerabilities of amazon in their e-commerce and web services....AND shares will fall."
Kohl's stores are PACKED !!
"Kohls had a crazy hoard of people outside today due to veterans day sales. It was like black friday. Just waiting to see the reaction from Kohls after black friday, might hook up 500 shares before black friday. Seems like a good dividend stock that can grow higher."

"Enquiring Minds Want To Know...Would Kevin Mansell, Chairman, CEO and President of Kohl's would accept an invitation to Deliver Keynote Presentation at 2018 ICR Conference on January 9 2018 if his Kohl's share price tanks on Monday January 8, 2018 so he can whine at his address presentation that Amazon is eating his lunch? Or will he proudly declare that retailing is a chess game with the ficle customers and requires a successful omnichannel strategy and better cost and inventory control including ""smaller but better footprint"" as well as improving rewards/loyalty programs which are essential to keeping their 30 million plus loyal customers. Place your bets....my bet is on Mansell celebrating and not whining."
"Bankrupt shorts are you feeling sorry now? Of course like Nomansky, you too can turn lemons into lemonaid and go on Naked and Afraid. Of course you wont make any money on that show either but at least you cant have unlimited losses from infinity and beyond as you can with Macys.When going on Naked and Afraid please do a public service by saying your name is Nomansky and you lost everything including the shirt on your back shorting Macys.Shorting stocks is plain and simple wild west gambling!Gambling is a Sin before God."
overdone on the CEO comment. shorts trying to makup for beating they took on Macy's last week. sad little guys can't seem to win
KSS is up 12.67% to 19.74
Will be below $40 today . Looking at Target.
Kss will drop under $1 soon
"Glad to see Kohls up, they can't keep the retail sector down."
where and at what time can I find the important reports that will be released tomorrow? thanks!
Margins improved due to order online and pick up in store increases with digital up 19 percent. Amazon take notice.
Good buying opportunity. People shop online and with great deals Kohl’s will be more than fine. Short squeeze pretty soon.
WOW 46.02 did not hold so we must test the yearly lows. Glad I did not buy I will wait .
Dead money gonna sit here for years like t or vz
"Stop giving false hope to robinhood buyers. Kohls is a dying company, look at their yearly chart. falling knive."

"From 35-56 in 2017, I think we see a low of 20 and a high in the low 50s in 2018. Retailers are cutting their margins smaller and smaller to compete with the likes of Amazon and in the end they will be forced to downsize stores and workers. The new Kohls will have smaller stores in less locations."

Great Dividend Stock......one more time
I really think the question is : Amazon going to buy Macy's or KSS?
the biggest stock manipulator ever is jim cramer....
"Amazing how little people understand this company...and read the P&L before trying to sway amateur investors. Kohls is nor going anywhere, they started the storewithin a store concept to maximize sales by sq foot. They actually earn a profit and pay a 4% dividend. They will reinvent themselves with Amazon, Aldi, AtHome...This is a buy and hold for dividend income. AdviceInvest dot com"
Wow- at this price- back up the truck. kss will overcome this earnings miss
when are the Suckaaa shorts going to enter today and get hammered ?? HAHA !!
Is it possible for KSS to follow Walmart by not having to purchase their inventory? Utilize name brand investment in their business?
Woot the January 2021 options are here!
I called this massive joke of a report yesterday yet still did not sell. I guess the jokes on me.
48-52 fair entry point.
"Forecast is for great earnings. Other than AMZN, any reason for the decline?"
why the hell KSS trading like its filing for bankruptcy in a week?! traders giving this thing to chance to survive?
Shorts are going to lose every bit of their gains.
Pullback coming Tuesday?
what can we attribute this morning's increase to? And can we count on it staying up?
$KSS CEO kind of hot. Is that worth anything?
"Sold my shares Swing Trade this morning @$51.26, nice small profit! Sitting tight after this article! Yikes!https://finance.yahoo.com/m/3b0c92c3-8ecb-3f16-99d1-5dc4f5015b69/mall-anchor-stocks-headed-for.html"
nobody will hold this quarter against anyone investors will focus on past and especially last quarter! I expect last quarter will be record breaking!
It is a nice store. I thought the deal with amazon would attract more customers. I went to kohls for the first time because of an amazon return and have been going back since.
"these activists have turned around big lots, bed bath and beyond , cititrends and now Kohls....."
"If I was management at KSS I would reopen unless the government would give them a guaranteed $1-$2 billion in money that wouldn’t need repaid. Why should KSS struggle and lose business when lots of other stores are still opened and dealing with people? I went to town today and town was busy like nothing was going on, Walmart, Home Depot, Joan Fabric, McDonald’s, Wendy’s, Giant Eagle, other smaller grocery stores all busy with lots of people shopping???? What’s the difference if these types of business are open or Kohl’s is open? I know they sell grocery’s but if you want people staying home you shut everything down and have some type of delivery service, it’s not fair how so many places are thriving from this while so many are struggling because they are shut down."
"The only value that Kohls seems to have, is the real estate associated with their stores, hence the high book value. Chances are they will go the route of Sears, hang on a few years by selling real estate and eventually go the BK route!!!"
The Kohls where I reside is a ghost town. I happen to visit to return an Amazon Package. To me it is a completely bizarre business model. The new generation has zero interest in shopping at this establishment.
Who is buying this rubbish?? These retailers are never going to survive beyond the next few years.
"So one way to spin the CC and their guidance is that Kohl's actually warned on H2 and big time. They beat consensus by 14 cents, which was actually higher than their guidance. Then they had a sizable impact from saved interest payments due to the $500M debt buy back. In that environment they only raised estimates by 10 cents, they would have raised them by 30 cents just to get back on track with the rest of the years guidance. Throw is his stupid excuses for why they beat on revenue in Q1, i.e. they actually had a ""sale"", what a huge surprise for a retailer, and then the extra damage he did when he realized what he was saying might sound like a warning. He should be fired for incompetence, period."
"Lets say Kohl's neither grows nor declines and maintains neutral sales, revenue and earnings...0.6 Price to book value7.8 price to earningsDividend reinstated at half of the pre-covid rate = 5.5% yield.I may be an amateur retail investor but I see value here.Now add to this bankrupted competition, online sales growing by double digits, 5% Kohls cashback rewards, Amazon returns sustaining foot traffic and perhaps marginally growing it, streamlining and redesigning brands to promote sales growth and attract younger demographics, leasing out real estate space within their stores.,,"
Jim Cramer sold some. Has me worried.

"I go past the Kohl's nearly every day. The lot has been seen with 70 to over 100 cars at any one time. I did see a video of Kohl's stores that showed a lot of weird inventory and super marked down prices, so I don't know whether it is ""pent up demand"" or just bargain hunting. I am going to go into the store tonight and see what is on the shelves and is being bought or not bought and why-low prices or just cabin fever. If this is a true resurgence, than Kohl's is cheap and will rise through the summer towards earnings on 8/18."
I guess you all got caught up in the in the excitement and forgot why this stock sold off to begin with. Opening stores will cost more then keeping them closed and the extra cost of operating stores with this Covid 19 will keep tearing into any gains. Kohls was on it's way out like JC Penney before the pandemic. It will never get back to it's old highs. This is about as high as it will ever get. Going the way of JC Penney Crew and Macy.
why’s it going up today?
Sell? Then you cry later for the capital gains you missed! KSS is going a lot higher!60s then 70s! And the dividend!
IS $KSS is the safe shore on bearish week like this? Get into this article and think that bears may be long enough this year....do you agree? https://www.stockmetrix.net/blog/post/100818/bears-better-beware-snapback-bed-bath-beyond?t=yftima
The analysts have not changed their profit estimates for 90 days. It’s all about management sandbagging in case the tariff situation is not resolved. Strong Buy!
"While I've been very surprised to see the Kohl's parking lot fuller than before Covid every time I drive by, I also realize they did not open here until early June. More than 2 months with closed stores here Q2, and just a few weeks this quarter that appear busier than ever. Analysts who say retail is dead should drive by the Kohl's here and see parking lot is packed, but I'm afraid this Q2 was a disaster with a government mandated shutdown of the stores most of the time. IMO, Kohl's will have a great Q4 this year."
KSS reached a new 52 Week High at 57.90
Michael admit you are an idiot crying in your beer
early stocking surprise KSS!
"Clothing store devastation has just begun article all, retail is dead. If everyone believes this and the price goes down another day, I will reload KSS and hold for very long time (I took profits earlier this week, lol)."
Wall St shifting $$$ to KSS
Can't believe this stock is kicking A.. and no one is here...I'm gonna be rich by myself! 
"Insiders buying shares, Corp trimming redundant jobs, all good news."
KSS just announced they fully drawn now from $1B credit line to get thru CV time...this sounds bad???
as of 2:31 $bbby lower 4.02% $kss lower 4.49% $bby lower 2.50 $jwn lower 5.69%while $m are only lower by 1.77%
"2017 and 2018, twice as many stores will close as will open.Opening stores will be smaller.Trend not real good for brick and mortar."
"and of course the downward trend will continue, just a few overly optimistic investors buying in this morning, guess we should call them suckers instead of investors"
Free cash flow positive. $511 million positive free cash flow Great news!
$38 when dust settles
"Kohl's is a ghost town, parking lots are empty, even Walmart shoppers hurry in and out of the store... no one's wandering around leisurely shopping for a new top!"
Shorts being creatures of habit have learned this nasty habit of shorting KSS after run ups may be very expensive to their financial health.KSS is not trapped in a time loop.Covid is ending and so is the lid on KSS stock
Store Closings!
KSS is down 4.94% to $64.66
Kohls junk retail chapter 11 with min wage increase
Another 500k shares covered by the shorts by the end of September. That likely is why we are drifting up. Also Dillards is going to squeeze big time because I think there are not enough shares for the shorts to buy back anymore. They covered a huge chunk by the end of September but there are still way way to many shares short on the stock and the float is getting squeezed by the companies buyback. I think if Dillards reports poorly for Q3 and sells of but the cash burn doesn't look bad it might well be a nice option play for a major squeeze coming as their business stabilizes and it becomes ever more clear that there aren't enough shares in the float left for the shorts to cover.
Way over valued
"Loaded up over the last week. Who knows what will happen tomorrow but I think the risk/reward here is worth it. A positive surprise and this will surge (+10-15%), because the narrative will become that the AMZN policy is working. Of course there is downside risk, but the reward is worth the play here IMO. Good luck."
Wow look at that. The call starts and we gain back all those loses for the most part. Don’t panic people these numbers are great and with back to school and Christmas coming the numbers will only get better. This is true especially with toys r us being out of the picture now. KSS would be smart to expand their toys section
Now why are we falling here on an up day in the market?
"Just bought in at $46.58, a very good price!"
What day do I need to own by to get the dividend?
Nothing yet-still have fork in hand
Bears  are all over the place
My post was deleted. Someone didn’t like my criticism about rewarding shareholders dividends versus following through on purchase orders.Shame on those trying to hide truth￼
"The all time high is just under $80, I think a run to the mid $70's is here before earnings and we might test new all time highs after earnings. Of course this requires some serious short covering by then. My guess is the short position post earnings will have to get under 10% because of the massive cash flow that is likely to bolster continued buybacks at Kohl's."
Advice Buy July Calls
bye bye kohl's....selling my shares and wont shop there....really slow learners!!!! always looking out for the shareholders right!!! some thing about fiduciary obligation.....buh bye
Do you people (you know who I’m talking about) rally think you can drive down a stock price by posting your (worthless) comments on this board??
"A clothing store with closed fitting rooms is not a positive business model. We shopped for jean at Nordstrom's. Not only were the fitting rooms ""OPEN"", they were also providing alterations.Then we went over to Kohl's. We were incredibly surprised to find the fitting rooms closed. It was no wonder all the jeans were not in their correct shelves, based on size. As soon as people discover they cannot try on the jeans, they just toss them anywhere. We also could not find a store clerk. It is no wonder Kohl's cut staff. When the fitting rooms are closed, customers go elsewhere.It bears repeating, a clothing store with closed fitting rooms is not a positive business model."
"No position, but I expected the amazon returns to play a much bigger role then what they have so far."
I see a lot of rookies trying to talk down the stock.Sounds good for KSS in my books.
Missing a buying opportunity of lifetime.
Kohls second earnings is going to surprise people. COVID restrictions didn't impact their May - July quarter any where near as much as prior quarter.
Check Google trends for Kohl's. The interest increases exponential lly from October. Keep calm and ride the wave 
"When I go into Kohls I feel like I am going into a Kmart of the 1990's without the bad smell. There is no pizazz, the employees are fliim flam, the merchanidise at the higher end reminds me of Mervyns (not a good thing). There is NO reason to go there for me....also, occasionally I used to go for housewares. NOw, the inventory is so thing or non existent, it has made any trips completely worthles."
Buying the dip.
kohls always Mark's stuff down this time of year to get ready for fall stuff
KSS made the story so much better then it was. Everyone thought they were in good shape. Not the case. Wow they really missed the mark!
"and the CANADIAN GOOSE is up with crazy P/E, who is selling Kohl's at $64 …. algorithm doesn't let this stock go up or?"
"A 5% drop on NO NEWS, way overdone !!! should be at 26 if not for habitual dayshorts!!"
"$42. may be support depending on earnings, then again with Trump and his stupid tariffs it could pop back to $52! - #$%$ shoot at this point!"
A fight is not good. It makes the CEO weak and every decision by CEO will be measured. Two power structures in a company leads to disaster. Mark my words.
let's just all come back here the middle of February and see what the price is
I really need to go shopping!
Near a 4% dividend and plenty of upside. Makes sense to double down
"Same store sales were weaker than expected but they seem to have made that up with on-line sales, likely prime day worked out just fine for them. Their stock buyback has been aggressive and they have now bought back $250M of the $400-$500M they said they would. It seems they will hit the high end of that market as business picked up in the last half of the quarter as well and same store sales increased 1% during that time. So maybe the Amazon returns is helping a lot.The mid range of their guidance, which they didn't need to change, is higher than analysts estimates, so this is a beat on earnings and revenue and a guide up. I think the 2nd half will be just fine for Kohl's and maybe their on-line business will get some attention now as Kohl's has separated itself from its peers with this report I think."
How long before is jcp
Is it a good time to get on board or I should wait !?
Pelosi says no deals until after election!
Last man standing
Beating expectations
What will be the new divy ????
Keep buying!!!!
"Went into Kohls last Saturday with the wife. place was empty. I saw two sales associates playing on their phones. This place us in the way to be the next Kmart, JC Penny, and Sears. Who would buy this junk?"
Just spent some money at Kohl’s. You’re welcome.
Amazon asked KSS board of directors for permission to buy millions of shares of KSS stock.Why do you think they did that? Wow are the shorts in for a bad day soon.
unless you need cash now dont do anything. Might have to sit on this for a while but it will be over 40 again eventually.
Downside a bit overdone.They just need to straighten out women's
are they cutting the dividend?
Amazon and Kohls have a partnership and it is getting much closer with Amazon buying millions of KSS stock.If Amazon wants to buy millions of KSS stock what does that prove? This reminds me a the days and weeks before Amazon bought the brick and mortar stores of Whole Foods. Same situation exactly! Longs are in for a huge capital gains.
"Currently oversold and at the bottom band of the 15 min 5 day, top band is at 21.23 LOCK N LOAD"
WHO DON'T LIKE A BIG CHUNK OF DIVIDEND
"KSS was upgraded to 70 from 80, time to buy"
Will this hit to $15 or less?
Kohls giving $30 coupon on $60 orders. A sure sign that there is trouble ahead. Bought in the money puts 3 months out. did this with JCPenney and sears
"AMZN is crushing it right now while KSS is way down. They have the cash to spend. If ever there was a chance to make a play for KSS to increase their footprint, this is it."
"Only reason to go into a Kohls is to return a Amazon purchase.ZERO reason to EVER purchase anything at Kohls paying ""regular"" price. Regular price at Kohls is a joke.Tired of dealing with the constant 10%....15%... off... Meaningless discounts since they are always in place.Current way of retailing will leave Kohls on the same path as Sears... JC Penny, and the rest.Go into my local Kohls and there are ZERO staff on the floor.Only employee around are the checkout clerks.... and the hidden security staff who are ALL sitting in a back room staring at a video screen. Seriously, more staff looking for shoplifters, than out on the floor helping customers find what they need.A horrible store from the customer experience point of view."
Expect some action on this one as shareholder meeting on 05/13/20https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200421005775/en/Kohl%E2%80%99s-Hold-Virtual-2020-Annual-Meeting-Shareholders
Buy jwn or Nordstrom if u want retail they have enough cash on hand to last 12 months of closed stores.
is kss dividend gone for now ?
Nice attack by the shorts at the open. Will be interesting to see where the stock price ends up today. I think we will rally into the close.
Dividends will be paid starting Jan 2021 or first quarter. Exdividend and payment dates remain same as before.

"anyone on here have any thoughts about OLLI, compared to KSS?"
"UP, up and away we go resumes today."
KSS is up 7.89% to 16.82
Give me some deep value discounted Kohl's stock!(Bullish looking ahead the next fives years purely from a fundamental valuation perspective)
I think this thing is looking for the Yearly high.
starting to look ugly again
"well , what do we have here"

Michael-how is your a doing--loser
you guys make me laugh!! one small drop and your all panicking!! do you realize how much it went up recently?! did you really think it will go up forever?! totally normal pullback. one good day on the mrket and this will boom...
Took another short position on that pop this morning e z in and out play
Big beat for macy’s . Comparable sales up 0.7 percent . Got to be good news for kss and norstrom’s
Can't be optimistic ... numbers from holidays were disappointing and this stock worth $33-35. We will have a pull back. Earning will be bad and revenue will disappoint.
Lolololol. What a pile of junk
"if they're opening on monday with 25% capacity, why is it going down :/"
Will be strongest retailer during Christmas.
Kohl’s does not sell food is difference....KSS selling panic in April...unsure if $9 will hold into June 1. SAD
What happened to $40
"KSS, because you need a nice new outfit when you go shopping at GME."
It had run up too fast in the last few months. It is time to consolidate. Some money now rotate back to the beaten down growth stocks.
"1M shares in the first hour and the stock is up significantly, doesn't look like the shorts are throwing in the towel. It will be very interesting few weeks going into earnings. I think there is going to be a big upside surprise because the company has been very cautious and the economy is doing much better than anyone expected.CNBC was busy throwing cold water on the retailers claiming a stock like Kohls was up 55% in a short time period. That sounds like it is over bought but the reality is the stock isn't up that much given the size of the short position it carriers. Just based on the short position it should be in the mid $70s and the earnings are signaling that as well. Now if there is more upside to earnings, well more upside to the stock."
We are heading for $3
"Another 1.8M shares shorted by 10/15 so we are up to 28.2M again. Plenty of ammo for a run up later this year, whenever they cover."
"If you like Kohl's then you should check out ocean front property in North Korea,I hear it's going cheap!"
"M, Nordstrom, KSS, it's all down today. They are hammering retail. Just hang in there, it will probably be buying season as they drive the prices down. KSS is one of the middle classes favorite places to shop, it has staying power."
"Way overbought today,but the technicals ran this you 5 sma and 10sma took this to the top band on the 20 day which is the prices it's at in the AH wouldn't be shocked if they short this heavy tomorrow and load on cheap puts."
Added more at 69.65. Feeling much better about that already
After Xmas sales will pump thisanother few dollars back to $60+
Kohl's reached a 52 Week low at 32.41
Omg I knew it and I still get killed
Great buying opportunity before the holiday run-up in my opinion.The results were decent in-spite of the disruption caused by the hurricanes.very encouraging.
"Fact is the online retailers are fighting for 25% of the clothing market and 25% is the ceiling or maximum penetration online clothing sales can achieve. That leaves 75% of clothing sales for brick and mortar retailers. Due to huge number of bankruptcies and liquidations of brick and mortar retailers there is far less competition for that 75% of clothing sales.CEO of Macys sees $10 billion is sales up for grabs due to all the closings of the weaker retailers going out of business from high end to low end products.The stronger big chains like Kohls and Macys are the winners in situation. Always the complaint of analysts is there are too many retailers competing for that 75% market share. Now there are many, many fewer.Covid sped up the process of the weak being taken over by the strong.Macys and kohls have been consistently profitable quarter after quarter before COVID and will be even more profitable now that there are fewer competitors.Fact is 75% of clothing sales will always be at brick and mortar stores. This is why latest government statistics showed such a huge drop in clothing sales during the shut down.People simply said, well Kohls and Macys are closed so I will delay my clothing purchases until they reopen their stores.Thus Amazon didn't get any benefit nor did they gain any market share during this time.The numbers clearly indicate the consumer faced with the choice of being only able to buy online or not at all chose they would rather wait until brick and mortar stores reopened than buy online.That is powerful bullish fact that PROVES ABSOLUTELY that there are limits the maximum market share online retailers can achieve. Right now the limit is about 25% of the clothing market and no more.At best 25% fact is the tide can turn against online retailers and don't be surprised if brick and mortar stores achieve higher than 75% market share as the consumer is excited and there is great pent up demand being unleased at Kohls and Macys.Time to sell online retailers and buy brick and mortar!"
"In remarks from central bankers themselves! “Changes in trade policy could cause us to have to question the outlook.” He added, “For the first time, we are hearing about decision to postpone investment, postpone hiring, postpone making decisions … If you ask, is it in the forecast yet, is it in the outlook, the answer is no. And you don’t see it in the performance of the economy.”"
Finally the dividend has been reinstated!
Last chance to get in. Monday will be 3% up
KKS should buy LULU
As most realize what they need in life and or one turns to his and asks: the ne xt time you buy clothes where will it be...Kohl’s. Feel the desire to require.
wow big rally of a penny
KSS is making good money in a difficult industry (just look at JCP!). They will outlast the competition. TA doesn't look good but I've learned that TA isn't everything. This is going back to $39 soon.
"TGT amost $72 and KSS is at $66.5, does this make sense to anyone?"
When does Amazon buy this out?
Cramer loved it in the 70s now he said he is pain in his trust yea his trust OH MYSaid you have to move on-don't ya love him....OH MY
"If you want to help Kohls, don't buy anything on amazon."
"Just started looking at KSS as investment, financials easily defend share price. Anybody think AMZN might be interested in acquisition"
Its down because SS#'s were lowered. With gas prices going up we have seen the highs for a while!
Looks like this puppy wants to go over 80 in a hurry.
Wall Street recommending Zynga with a 100 P/E and dumping KSS at a 10.7 P/E and 5%+ divi. Absurd!
"its how manipulating funds do it, they pay CHUMPS to write False downgrades,Kohl's next Quarters are GREAT!!!!!"
Buying the dead cat bounce is going to be a yuuge mistake!
"Pretty heavy volume today which to me likely means shorts were driving it down. In the end the quarter was very decent and the company sandbagged the rest of the year enough that they don't need to try any more of these games down the road. The $500M buyback of debt alone should have resulted in more than a 10 cent boost in earnings, especially since they beat by more than that even in Q1. So I think the CFO and CEO just made a huge mistake in trying to sandbag 2018 out the ying yang.The selling will resolve itself here short as I think on Thursday the company can buy back shares again. Hopefully they will pick up the pace, $70M and 1.1M shares in Q1 was on the light side. If they are going to make the high end of their buyback guidance they will have to increase the buyback to well over $100M a quarter.As to the stock price performance, I think the bottom was going to be set around this time like last year. Given that Q1 results were so good, I think the bottom has already been set for the stock. So we may go down and try to test it again this quarter, but I think we are set for the year as far as the lows go."
"Don’t worry, earnings announcement in a few days will drag the share price back down, even if it’s a positive report, exceeding expectations. KSS can never seem to win with the market. I’m not saying that as a hater. I’ve been long KSS for a long time, and I’m just used to the pattern. I hope I’m wrong."
"Can you imagine if Kohl's missed today? Down 10%,20%? It's coming and Under Armour isn't going to increase profits!"
Up big after hrs due to encouraging vaccine results. Tomorrow could be huge.
40 by Thanksgiving
Someone is dumping big time !
Kohl's up 8% Friday and 9% pre-market today. Just wait until people realize that this news from Kohl's has no relevance to Macy's.
"The price of KSS is down over 74% from the yearly high. Not too much more bad news to price in. Most stores are not in crowded malls, relatively safer shopping. The notion all retail is dead, only shop Amazon is over-done. If bought in right, 2021 EPS will be back over $5, PE of 3.PE of TGT is 20, PE of AMZN is 115."
"The retail sales numbers combined with information coming out of the company on how there online was so strong on Black Friday leads me to suspect a good last quarter of the year for Kohl’s. Last quarter was stronger than appeared given the calendar shift and this quarter will also get some negative effects though not as much as last. We need to get some movement on the initiatives like Amazon & Aldi. I know of another Aldi/Kohl’s store started construction a couple of weeks ago. Ex CEO of Macy’s Lundgren was talking about online grocery is only 2% of the grocery business so it is a high traffic low margin business. If Kohl’s can gain traffic without all the grocery headaches and get paid in a lease to do it , it could be a real home run. The Amazon deal brings in millennials and 25% of them buy something else in store and then we get them hooked on the Kohl’s cash. Then they’re the positive finance issues going forward next year like decreased debt, stock buybacks, added depreciation, improved margins, and lots of cash . Kohl’s is not peak! As much as I respect certain analysts she’s wrong here. Maybe the year after but not 2019 and by 2020 who knows what can happen. The XRT is the most shorted index on the street. A short squeeze might be coming and it may be back quickly so it’s a mistake to sell now ."
"Up , up and away! Dividends restored soon per CEO announcement!"
Wake me at $60 #mindTheGap
time to ring the register. Mike says we will see $18 again.
Stop chasing this dividend and traditional retail in general. Kohl’s as we know it is done. The only reason to buy now is as a lottery ticket for Amazon buyout. Not impossible but not likely in the near term.
"Bottom has to be close, getting ready to cannonball into this one,"
I am neither long or short KSS. I bought when you could not give the stock away at $37. I sold at $44. I should have held longer but it is very cyclical. Look at the long term charts. It rallies due to anticipated or reported Christmas sales. Then it heads down in the summer. I will be looking to buy back in at sub $40. I don't mean to be a bummer but just passing some information.
Need some transformational change
Kohls has a neat store and I love the home department. Please don't order anything on Amazon. You are only helping the enemy when you do.
"20B in revenue, 2.1B in earnings and only 4.5B market cap?! Plus a 9.9% Div and a PE of 6?! Those are cuckoo type of numbers for not wanting to get in. Amazon could use some of their loose change to buy them out although it still wouldn't help a lot of shareholders get back above water."
Wow somsone blocked my comments on the retail sales report quick. It is a good report for Kohl's as they reported up earnings and this report shows that the on-line retail dominance story is flawed. This should produce buying interest in Kohl's and get people to sell Amazon. Hopefully it convinces the shorts it is time to take of their short retail collar.
"YOU Dayshorts need to get burned by a big ANNOUNCEMENT coming soon,,longs will laugh last and hard !!"
"Investment firms driving down the price so they can pick it up closer to the price you got it for in March and April, as a rapid recovery becomes more evident. Also, Trump 2020!"
and the next quarter will be super bad! fire sales coming!
CEO of KSS said we don't plan to close any KSS stores as we feel comfortable with our current stores.Then she continued by saying they see incredible future growth opportunities made possible by the massiveloss of competitors in the market place made possible by covid.This is an extremely bullish case for future growth at KSS as well as Macys.
"Let's see, the shorts, to include Goldman Sachs are ""worried"" that the big box stores are losing market share to the discounters such as Target which has just reported great numbers as did Wal-mart and TJ Maxx. Currently not owning Kohl's but Macy's let's look at what the earnings report tells us. Revenues, which are top line numbers and implies sales, they actually came in right on target, so your first premise is incorrect, sales are still growing, same store sales were up .4% which while not growing as fast as analysts would like, is still growth, so your simply incorrect, the store is not losing market share. Profits do indicate that they may have had to do more promotional activity to maintain that market share though most of the lower profit could be attributed to higher costs for goods sold (possibly related to tariffs) and labor which in a tight labor market such as we have with multi-decade low unemployment is to be expected. So at the end of the day, really this report shows nothing dire about Kohl's or the overall brick and mortar stores. So can we just end the false narratives? They need to focus on execution just like Macy's does, customer service, customer retention, quality of merchandise and exclusive sales arrangements such as Kohl's has with Vera Wang."
"So Macy’s maintained there guidance despite the beat on earnings. When asked about tariffs the CFO was unable to quantify the effects that they would have & this is the problem. They have had enough time to figure this out so not to say anything the street will imagine the worst. They have had enough time to set up there shops in Vietnam that put a made in Vietnam tag on the garment. How efficient that will be and what will be the cost? The bottom line is what will be the effect on sales, margins & profits? Kohl’s along with the other retailers are at historically low PE. My opinion is that the tariffs are manageable for apparel. Other industries will be screwed and that may take the whole market down and push the economy into a recession. The situation in my opinion is that Democrats are edging Trump on thinking it will tank the economy and help them during the election. If Trump backs down the Democrats will call him weak. They did the same thing with the Government shut down. I’m keeping my powder dry. For Kohl’s $60 is a big buying spot and continue to average down as opportunity avails itself. I also like Nordstrom’s here. Both these stores have good long term potential."
at least 23% undervaluedhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-kohls-corporation-nyse-085543865.html
Waiting for earnings release is nerve racking.
If you are interested in seeing some really solid transformation to your trading bottom line then you need to check out (http://Rightpicker.com).
"JWN is predicted to reach $18 by the end of the next week.Therefore, KSS is looking to follow their same trend line.Buy option calls if you can on Monday."
"Amazon needs brick and mortar to put Costco, Walmart and Target in the grave.Kohls is the largest department store in the USA with over 1158 stores in every state but Hawaii."
Going to be an impressive holiday season for Kohl’s. Hoping they can hold some margin with the increased sales figures. With the buyback and solid dividend coverage there is no reason the stock couldn’t see a 15-20% move in 2018.
Will be selling in 30s soon. Longs enjoy the capital gains and dividends
Green on a red day! Says it all!Value is value any way you slice it!
KSS MM/SPECIALIST HAVING PERPETUAL CONJUGAL RELATIONS WITH THE LOW OF THE DAY; SHORT KSS; KSS SPECIALISTS IS NET SHORT
Anyone who was listening to my posts earlier this week made money.
Why doesn't management at least say they are cancelling future dividends??
div cut/no profit coming in/no school clothes/no vaccine for months.15/share
kss firing on all cylinders
"Stores are empty on week days,only weekends when white moms go shopping do they get busy,nothing but overpriced merch that Amazon will ship for free at half the cost,another retailer biting Amazon's dust!"
"Today's early price action at least is reinforcing the idea that there just isn't much supply available to buy. So to drive it down shorts need to short more or Kohl's needs to screw up earnings, something that can't really happen till post Q4 earnings. Interestingly the analysts have raised their estimates for the quarter to the high end of Kohl's guidance range."
I added at $61.31 today. I see $74-75 by year end.
"Shorts actively trying to paint the tape on this one so the big boys are still playing. Target also got a huge price target upgrade today, which Kohl's hasn't yet received, though analysts have been upgrading their price targets the hold guys seem to be moving to the mid $60's while the sell guys seem to be moving up to the $50 level. In any case we will see how active the shorts were in the 2nd half of December later today and of course later in the month see how much shorting was done early this year to drive the stock price down in a hope of a January swoon repeat for the retailers (a reasonable bet given the last 5 year history).In the end the question will be when do the shorts cover because that will market the next significant move up in the stock price. I am not sure they can wait till earnings in March, although so far I have been very surprised by how stubborn they are. Given the January track record for retailers they likely were hoping to get a much better cover price here over the next few weeks. It will be interesting to see how they react when that doesn't happen. Also of interest to the shorts is the very high likelihood that Kohl's post 10+% earnings growth compared to 2016, that will further make the case for a market multiple, especially if earnings haven't included the tax benefits, which will be significant for Kohl's."
Thanks Kohls for bringing back the dividend. Now I've got beer money as I watch the stock march higher.
$20k in a day on puts and shorts. Loved hosing you clowns
"The largest impact has been the big retail short, the theory that most brick and mortar department stores will continue to lose market share and there margins will decrease. The shorts have had some wins and some losses. Most of there losses they have exited but not Kohl’s. For some reason they have chosen $kss stock to take a stand in. It has been reported that shorts have lost $1 billion in $kss stock on paper. The losses don’t become realized until they finally cover and then they all lose their job so they just don’t cover and hope that the stock goes down and they save their jobs. If Kohl’s stock goes up from here they lose their job anyway and some massive funds of regular people’s money take the big loss. Such is the way of Wall Street. Doesn’t make sense but this is really happening. On the other side of the short trade are people that will continue to hold & Kohl’s doing stock & debt buybacks. What really screwed the shorts has been the corporate tax cut & the low unemployment employment that has bought time for Kohl’s to modernize and stabilize the business on a regular sustainable growth path. If Kohl’s gets to that over 3% growth path there will be a huge, not a regular short squeeze. My advice is to hold on for the short squeeze."
Stop listening to fear and do your diligence. This company has enough cash flow and cash to weather this. This is a higty
FWIW bought more here at 23.50. I am willing to wait this craziness out.
This will declare for bankruptcy soon
"Not a bad year for Kohl's investors, despite the unwarranted sell-off since earnings. Will be an interesting 2019 I think with a good chance for a solid pop early in the year as the chart should start looking positive quite soon despite the recent death cross (something that nowadays seems to signal the end of the downturn is close rather than starting). I think Kohl's has bottomed and we are headed for a nice run into earnings. What sort of resistance the 200 dma becomes will have to be seen, I guess it likely mostly depends on shorts and whether they short more as the stock goes up. Heaven forbid they actually cover."
"ok, the news is out now whatttt"
"A lot of people will not buy clothing and housewares on the internet, like Boomers. There will still be a place for brink & mortar retail, and the stores that offer good products and loyalty rewards will win. I like shopping at Kohl's and they have a good loyalty rewards program. Come November the checkout lines are always wrapped around the isles to the back of the building. I see Kohls weathering the storm and moving forward. I'm long and not worried about any short term pullbacks."
KSS is selling for less than book value. KSS is worth far more than it's current price.Easily a 3 bagger as Peter Lynch would say and a 5 bagger for the patient investor.
KSS raised forecast for 2019. That's all I care.
"2. Kohl's | Percentage Increase 7.6%Kohl's (KSS) jumped after analysts at Cowen upgraded the department-store chain to outperform from market perform and raised its stock-price target by a third, citing its moves to attract younger shoppers. The firm raised its target on the Menomonee Falls, Wis., retailer to $52 a share from $39."
Pocket change will allow to get all those brands into.those doors why have just returns when u leaving efficiency with other items doesnt makee senze unless they get bought bc kohls will.be the nezt sears in a good way owning the future thought it would have been macys it going be macys n kohls long term duo
M and KSS will slide again once their earnings call after Aug 10thReady for some shorts. M is going to sink more than 7% and KSS in 5% down next week.
As the CEO of KSS said at last quarter results. From here on things are going to get much better - this is the low of the year.
18 coming
Back to $60 by end of the year
I’d love to see what the shorts are saying now! I’ve been here since $21
I thought this was going to $30 by Friday? What happened ??!!?
today might be a big nut buster
Shorts are going to get burned here. Kohl’s is the best soft goods retailer. Will profit from the failure of traditional big box retailer. Online strategy is improving.
short covering???
"Wow a lot of people on here peesed this has gone up 90%, I get that you’d want to short this at $30 a month ago, but keeping the short on at $11? That was just a little greedy."
"Trending well now, and the board is quiet. Getting shares for under $50 is a quickly-closing window. Kohl's is not a brick-and-mortar with numbered days. It is actually the new day-shopping destination, replacing ""going to the mall"".There is nothing significantly different today from where we were three months ago when the stock was over $70. look at where Target was 2 years ago, when the hype was exactly the same, and look at Target today. The market is fickle. Kohl's is here to stay, and it happens to be very cheap right now."
My thoughts is a couple of down days before we continue this nice rally We went up $7 in 4 trading sessions I feel a little pull back coming.... hope I am wrong !!
fast money on Cnbc is total fake news. Najarian and Karen finerman have to be the worst investors ever born
BonTons has nice clothes. Kohl's is junk.
way oversold. back to school will be big for them
glad to hear that Amazon is a friend. better than enemy.
"From Macellum fund's filing today:Since 2010, directors have purchased a mere $1.2 million in Company stock while collecting over $23 million in director compensation. Most recently, we find the Company’s decision in April 2020 to raise $600 million of debt due in 2025 with a 9.5% interest rate very troubling. While we acknowledge that there was a high degree of uncertainty at the time of this capital raise, we believe this issuance was ill-conceived and would have been challenged by any well-functioning board of directors. First, Kohl’s did not need the capital as it had significant additional sources of liquidity at the time. In fact, Kohl’s has generated positive cash flow throughout 2020 and is currently sitting on $1.9 billion in cash, after paying down all their bank debt. Second, the deal appears poorly negotiated, with a 9.5% interest rate and a prohibitively expensive make-whole call premium that would cost the Company $224 million if the notes were repaid today.Kohl’s generated $18.9 billion in net sales in 2019, approximately the same as the $18.8 billion reported for 2011, eight years earlier. Over this same period the industry grew 17%. This is particularly troubling given the large number of competitive store closures and bankruptcies that the industry experienced during this time period. The Investor Group estimates that from 2015 to 2019, key competitors of the Company (including Kmart/Sears, Bon Ton, Macy’s, JCPenney and Dillard’s) lost more than $12 billion in sales that could have accrued to Kohl’s. Yet, over that same period Kohl’s lost nearly $300 million in sales. The Company’s inability to gain market share despite spending approximately $1 billion a year on marketing and hundreds of millions of dollars on e-commerce fulfilment capabilities is troubling.In addition, the leadership of this Board is stale and has an average tenure of over 16 years. The Chairman of the Board has served for 33 years, the Chair of the Audit Committee has served for 14 years, the Chair of the Governance & Nominating Committee has served for 13 years and the Chair of the Compensation Committee has served for 5 years. While the Company recently added, rather than replace, a director to the Board, likely as a result of engagement, we find that level of Board change woefully inadequate.*******************************************************************************************************************Thoughts? I certainly agree the $600M bond issue was a bad bad deal for shareholders (more like something a nearly bankrupt company would be forced into), and the directors' stock ownership is pathetic. But who's to say different directors would buy shares and align their interests with shareholders."
There are so many stocks out there at multi year lows with high dividends as KSS was a year ago. Now you ignore those stocks but pay up for KSS?
OVERREACTION this morning ! $54 before close Friday !
"We should get another good run next week as a potential short squeeze finally vaults this stock to a more realistic value. Personally I think a market P/E is warranted as this stock looks like a retail winner and you can see that from the same store sales growth compared to the alsorans like JCP and Macy's. JCP did fairly well, they might turn it around as well by the way. So I think a fair valuation is an 18 P/E times current earnings which puts us square in the mid $70's by Q4 earnings. Looking forward, and with the tax cut impact, I think earnings of $5 in 2018 and $5.50 in 2019, especially with continued stock repurchases in the $400M/year range are reasonable and likely may become analysts consensus post Q4 earnings. That gives us a $100 price target by the time 2020 January options expire and still a good rate of return if the stock runs up to the mid $70s here shortly.Looking at the options, and assuming those buyers expect to double their money they realistically see the stock exceeding $86.50 by January 2020, something that 18 multiple analysis would confirm. So options are telling longs that you can earn 21% a year for the next 2 years from current prices, clearly making this a strong buy from these levels.So I am trying to decide what price level on a short squeeze spike do you take money off the table or lock in gains by selling deep in the money calls. I can get a risk free rate of return of 6% easily in the current market with 30+% downside protection, so that has to be added into any selling decision. I think if I can sell the $75 call for $11.50 I would start getting interested in locking in gains, but not before. They are not at $7.30 so likely we need another $8 in price appreciation on the stock before I start thinking of locking in gains, that's around $72. So if we get a run to $75 before earnings, I likely would think of locking in gains. Post earnings I might want more than that.Any other thoughts?"
Never run in front of locomotive gaining speed and momentum!
Doubled down. Price is silly.
"Investing based on china trade headlines is like playing russian roulette with your portfolio. These facts don't change. In the latest reported quarter, inventories are down, cash flow is up and at today's prices Kohl's pay nearly a 6% dividend. With a long-term view there is a high probability you will be rewarded. Of course, if you are smart enough to be able to predict the bottom you will do even better, but for mere mortals, this looks like a reasonable opportunity."
Anecdotally I drove by many Kohl’s in California last week & all the parking lots were fairly full despite the high gasoline prices. On another note the downgrade of Dillard’s of all things today seems to be weighing down retail. Unusually high put options activity in Kohl’s today. This is the first down Monday for $kss in 7 weeks also the stock broke lower from an ascending wedge pattern. Early in the morning trading $kss was down over $2 on low volume.
what news is it going up on today?
never will trust cnbc again
Going close $30
Best advice here is to mute all of the day traders (I.e. Mike Williams) that track every little movement of this stock every single day. Real “Investors” will be OK long term.
The shorts will regret their decisions! Congrats to all the longs.
"can't complain about the stock reaction to this huge down move today. It looks like we are holding the breakout range which should be a positive going into earnings. Hopefully this will lead shorts to cover as they see the bottom price range is set. That likely is what has happened to day as the big sell-off early didn't produce a selling panic. Also with treasuries getting creamed today fixed income investors may look to move money out of bonds and into solid dividend stocks till the rates have made their move back up. That likely is something we will see throughout this year, so I think checking out undervalued dividend payers and playing them for a year or two may work out quite nicely. If you are worried about losses, sell deep in the money calls to mitigate the downside, but it does also limit the upside."
I would suggest you buy more
Eagle alpha hiring trends say kohls looking ok !
x dividend
$40 is a great price to short. Once xmas is over there's going to be a depression.
"Well I guess that explains JB showing up and talking down the stock, the short position increased significantly from 12/1-12/15 despite the stock price rise. We are now sitting at $55.29 and they have taken significant losses plus we have more shares short. While a pullback can't be ruled out, this will get painful for the shorts as over 114% of the stock is held by institutions."
"Down on big volume, Uncle Shorty is at work again."
"Well it looks like some shorts got a little scared yesterday but there was clearly not the panic that usually comes with a short squeeze. So I think we are getting close. The reversal on the chart looks like it could be another short term top, something that seems to happen a lot when the 50 dma crosses the 200 dma on single stocks. What will be interesting to watch the next few days is to see if this was a reversal. If it isn't you will see covering I think and maybe the short squeeze start to hit before the end of the month. My guess is the bots and pro's will want to see how many people have covered in the first 2 weeks of September. If we see like a 1M share reduction then they might start tossing in the towel as the herd will have started to #$%$.Again, I warn all shorts here, there is no abundance of stock to buy back because Kohl's has been buying what the shorts have been selling to drive down the price. When/if the short squeeze happens it will be very violent and likely take us to new 52 weeks highs.Someone said earlier in the year that Kohls would be an interesting buyout and that the price for that would like be around $95 due to their extensive real-estate holdings. I think that is likely a good ceiling for the stock price. So maybe the shorts are happy to play with those kind of losses."
"With Amazon returns, men are finding Kohl's. It is evident in the movement upward in men's apparel. Where to shop habits are being built. This is a very good thing."
"Going up with no reason, many downgrades to $19"
"Looking at Francesca's (FRAN) and Dillard's (DDS) it is clear that the retail short is getting squeezed on some stocks already. I think that is going to help out Macy's and Kohl's as well as these are losses that will likely lead to a rethink of these significant short positions. Indeed, I think Dillard's is already a massive short loss scenario as there are strong holders that will punish the shorts as they try to cover their 40+% short position. The company also has a buyback going that could in theory buy back 30-40% of the outstanding shares. With a holding family that I am sure will leave some shorts seriously short of being able to buy shares. Remember, you can borrow shares to short from an S&P 500 stock by getting those shares from an Index fund or ETF but you can't buy them back! So I think we have a scenario in retail where some hedge funds are opening themselves up to huge losses and that will force an overall surrender call on the entire sector. Dillard's can easily break $100 if the holiday shopping season turns out solid."
"At the end of the day, the real question is, how much wealth does the 0.1% who control 80% of our world's wealth and thereby controls all of the financial markets want to steal from the college endowment funds, retirement funds, small middle class investors, that will determine where the markets end up, nothing else, the markets are acting completely irrational in relation to the facts. As a conservative it greatly pains me to say this but we must join the progressive liberals in introducing wealth taxes that will take some of that wealth and control away from the elitist who currently control our economy, the taxes gathered should only be used to pay down the national debt."
"People are incredibly tired of this stay at home, wear stupid masks and covid fear. Who wants to be a germaphobe ? Cabin fever is rampant everywhere! No one wants to stay home and shop online.They want to go to the malls, and have fun shopping in the open air and breath and be free again!Online sales are going to plunge as people return to the malls and mob the retail stores like KSS and Macys."
Puts!!!
"I still think amazon is looking to buy kohls, just a weird feeling"
"Maybe Kohls should lower guidance ? That way your stock will go up !Enjoy your sugar high, because we all know what is coming later."
"Awesome plans in the pipeline with FLX, there's no reason Lululemon alone should enjoy large Market Cap ($43B to be exact) for women's leisure wear."
"I just don't understand how KSS longs can convince themselves that KSS deserves to trade higher than 12.4 times PE while Macy's is trading around 6 times PE.I have heard and seen so many longs tried to pump KSS back to 80 per share and making KSS into $13.36 billion in market valuation. 80-83 per share would be back to all time high again.Seriously longs. The broader market is declining. Retail sector is declining. KSS is no exception. Nothing that KSS has done or currently is doing would make KSS immune from another 15.5% decline from the current closing price of 71 per share.While Macy's is making $24.8 billion in revenue and $1.55 billion income to common while KSS is only making $19 billion in revenue and $0.859 billion income to common.Macy's current market valuation is $10.16 billion while KSS sports a $11.84 billion in market valuation.Like Macy's, JWN, DDS and others, KSS has 29.71 million shares and more than $2 billion shorted against KSS since 9-15-2018.It is only healthy for KSS to correct and profit take back down to 60 per share."
Back to 50 now that ecommerceBubble busts and abbot test
Congratulations. This baby should have a nice run and maybe in a year bring back the divy.
Very creative CEO(ie.AMZN returns)

KSS steady Eddie today!
anyone know if amazon is in talking w/ dillards for exposures in mall's ?
Are people reaching today for that .55 dividend? Sold today and will wait for pullback to re-enter.
"@Gerhard...so are you saying FOSL is up so high because when the good report came out, all the shorts started to cover quickly? Also, what's your take on the market today? Will there be a big slide of multiple hundred points like last week due to the reports?"
"So the GDP was just like I told you Stoxx, the US economy is accelerating, not decelerating. Indeed, we may already be growing at 3% as the 2.9% year over year growth can easily be revised up in one of the two coming revisions. Consumers have more money to spend, significantly more and they are also saving more. So despite some sluggish consumer spending in Q1, the consumer is healthy and cash flush with significantly more money to spend. Rising gasoline prices won't be an issue and indeed those even count as increased spending as far as GDP is concerned.This will be a very good year for retailers, the question is whether 2019 will be better or not. I think that depends on the rate at which we grow oil production and how well we sell that oil into other markets, like Europe which is desperate for our high quality light sweet crude."
KSS 60s just around the corner!!!
KSS reached a 52 Week low at 36.73
there's goes a week of gain. Thanks Trump.
Can someone give me facts and convince me to buy at this price point?
"Reality sets in, EOW."
The world has changed a lot in the last two months let alone from a year ago....to compare now to a year ago with regards to how consumers are spending their money is DANGEROUS.
Kohls will buyback millions of shares at these bargain prices
"Earnings so good, then why is the stock so down? Anyone could explain please..."
Holding long let's get that dividend starting soon.
"It's ALL OVER for Kohls, they opened a store in Plattsburgh , NY Mall , they just opened this dumpy little store. They likely got the rent free from Pyramid to be an anchor but the store is dumpy and small.This is the last place for any growth. So therefore there isn't anymore.Plattsburgh attracts the cheapest frugal Quebecois."
I added a bunch of shares. This stock is only going way up. Powell did a lot better today!
Maybe a stupid question but why are there no KSS divs shown on this Yahoo chart?
Sell? You will miss out on far higher capital gains. This will be a great year for beaten down retailers.
I remember when Sears stock was $50. What a great short! I rode that down till the end. Looks like this roller coaster is getting ready to drop
This is a value stock that pays no dividend and has a p/e of 47. I value it at 8.00.
This was from January 2016. It looks like it's becoming a topic again with the latest pullback.
Gonna drop bigWatch closely
"Well ToyRUs, Bonton and Bed Bath and Beyond certainly haven't given anyone anything to cheer about for retailers. Throw in an anemic February for retail sales and one can understand the negative sentiment. Fortunately it looks like the retail sales numbers for Monday might turn out better than expected as the BoA credit card summary showed a strong rebound in retail in March. So hopefully we have just this last day before we start to get more positive stock action. Interestingly, even in this downturn lately, it has taken shorting to move the stock down, i.e. down volume has been minimal. So I think we can set up for a reasonable run into earnings, especially if we can get back above the 20 and 50 dma's which now have put the January peaks behind them. That means a move up on the stock price will show improved technicals with positive 20, 50 and 200 dma's and that hopefully will get the algos and shorts to stop punishing this stock."
It is actually quite interesting that since the fed said uncle dividend paying stocks have done so poorly. Everyone seems to be wanting to put money to work in tech again but I think that is going to prove to not be the best investment.
KSS management is MIA I agree with USA why aren't they buying shares back? Investors are tired and will bail out soon. Sad week for KSS down over 20%
KSS
Is Emma a Dork for promoting bullsh!! websites on this message board?
so will they pile drive this below 60 at the close?
"If you are not boycotting Scamazon, you are too stupid to help. You evidently can't see what is happening."
earnings will be really good just watch.
Any pull back is a buying opportunity. We will see $50s before too long.
All retails will crash in May. Pumped to max
KSS is up 6.75% to 72.00
Get ready for a red day longs!
16.80's now. You had so many chances to get out. You have only yourselves to blame if you end up losing more.
Perfect retailer to take private and get the damn market off of its case. Other lousy retailers that are performing poorly are having a negative effect on this stock that's not justified based on its cash flow and continued appeal to consumers.

Let me just say that as a Kohl's and Amazon customer and as a Kohl's investor I appreciate and use the Amazon returns. I will not be voting for ANY of this investor group's board nominees. their suggestions are short-sighted. when I invested in Kohl's I invested in Michelle Gass. for an individual investor. I'm not institutional but I do have a pretty good size stake.granted they could afford to pay the prior dividend. but maybe they have plans needing Capital to invest. my votes will be very easy:give Michelle Gass a chance. let's see what things look like at the end of this year.
"Next push to $29-30 plus , get long now before its tooo late !!"
Bought 15.07 dumped 16.60. Glad there are idiots who chase a stock up that's in a down trend and headed to 1.00. This is the next JC Penney.
P/b: 0.67Forward P/e: 7.5Div. yield if cut in half compared to pre-covid: 6.46%Deep value play. I'm in.
Amazon raising prime by 20% has to be good news for us and of course evidence that shipping costs are starting to hit them and maybe even hard. I think the big earnings surprise is going to be Amazon as analysts are going to have to real in their estimates and their P/E's on the stock. Their numbers will look good but the details will flash a warning sign.
I hate this stock
Run
PUT Order in place.
Down every single day. I don't have to predict the direction anymore.
Blood in the Street!
This is a good point to buy. The only reason I am not buying more here is I think JMIA is slightly better value and I don’t have enough cash to buy more of both.
BREAKING: Tyvor Capital LLC Takes $28.25 Million Position in Kohl’s Co. (KSS). That's why shares are up now
"thare is a lot of losers! I know who they are, and I don't like capitalizing on them! but we will!"
Sad day
"Got to read the CC. Dividend gets boosted to 70.4 cents which basically leaves the amount paid out very similar to last year. As to the stock buyback, this is where they cut it back to $300-$400M from last years $400-$500M. So as I expected. CapEx is also going to decline by about $100M from 2019 so they are effectively going to spend $200M less this year than last, which is about how much they reduced their cash position last year. The buyback will buy back a lost of shares at these levels, so I think it is likely we will repurchase another 8-10M shares or around 5% of the outstanding shares. More pressure on the shorts who likely also won't like the dividend increase."
Macy’s had same announcement yesterday and their shares soared upwards...
"I need to have the guts to play both sides of the game. If I had only spent a few more coins in puts to hedge my position, I'd be all sorted out. Cheapskate"
Macy's earnings coming out tomorrow. Anyone think the presumed terrible statement from them will drop KSS for a window to buy?
Newbie bag holders buying above 20.00. Stop deleting my posts. I think the moderator is doing it to pump his stock and silence people who know what they are talking about. Maybe this John dude whose posts are pasted at the top. Reporting the abuse of power to yahoo and taking screen shots.
"Good article on debt reduction, apparently Kohl's will retire another huge chunk (over $400M) of its debt due 2021. That will put its next debt expiration all the way to 2023. Further, retiring that much debt will also boost 2019 earnings by about 7-8 cents a share. The real question will be what they do with all of that extra cash flow. Back in March they said any additional cash flow this year would be returned to shareholders, so I think we will see a dividend increase to $0.65 and likely $400-500M of debt being bought back this FY instead of the $300-400M they originally guided. As of Q3 they had bought back $275M worth of shares."
"""This is a long term hold position in ones portfolio. Expect the dividend and stock repurchase programs restored after covid nonsense is over with."
my shopping cart is filling up with kohl's $Cash !
"at this price, its almost FREE,Load up and hold for 6 months,be an easy MILLIONAIRE !"
"Been going up in big chunks lately. I think that likely signals that the shorting we saw since 9/15 has ended and maybe they are even covering a bit again. About 5M shares were shorted between 9/15 and 10/15 driving the stock down from $80 to the $70 level. So that wasn't just the market swoon, it really was shorting. That should set us up for a strong rally into the end of the year as Kohl's making their Q3 numbers and potentially guiding up to guidance or higher should make it clear that this is a loser for the shorts."

"No REAL reason for the latest price drop. I think earnings were not really a surprise . I will wait until next earnings call , after the holidays to make a decision ! I think we will get a more accurate picture by then !"
"Target hit a bullseye with their earnings release this morning. Not a real surprise have been kicking tail for 18 months. Macys, GME, BBY, and JCP are losing market share and their balance sheets show dismal stories. See more downside risk than upside potential for KSS."
"This week the labor report on Friday will be important because it should get rid of the ""manipulation"" that we saw from the labor department last month. As you know many in the government are totally and utterly in the tank for Obama and the Democrats and they don't shy away from manipulating the data. Seasoning of government data, where they make every month 72 degrees is just one of the ways they do this. Last months labor report took the unseasoned employment number of 154,877k and seasoned it to 155,178k, so roughly a 300k boost. However in the prior year they boosted the unseasoned number from 152,628k to 153,064k which was a 436k boost. That was an underreporting of 137k jobs on the headline number! Now they will lie to you telling you how the weather made them due it, but it does show that year over year employment growth (unadjusted) was strong at 2,149k and that sort of growth should be seen in April, this time without the seasoning temperature impact as April didn't show the snow. So look for a strong number on Friday to correct the fudged number from last month. Just like they increased black unemployment in the January report by one percentage point (all through seasoning) so that Trump had to stop making his claim of lowest black unemployment since slavery. Naturally the seasoning trick didn't work in March so we are back to record low unemployment level for blacks and hispanics."
I think single digit is wrong unless they file for BK
"it's time to buy kss, because covid 19 new cases continue natural decline, it will be end soon,stores won't close again, kss worth$42."
Manipulation nation........
Trrrible earnings
oversold in premarket. best guess. should settle between 53.50-55 today.
Bought in at a little over $27. This is not fun to watch. Let's see how far it continues to drop.
"JCP closing 200+ stores as part of bankruptcy, should mean 1 to 2 percent more sales for Kohls. That is getting only 20% to 40% more buisness in 200 Kohls stores that have a Pennies next door."
$100/share KSS target set!
Why would anyone short a stock trading at roughly half its book value?
@smb_gt nobody is going to shop Kohls electronically. BK is immenent.
Will Kohl's not be a large beneficiary of the upcoming stimulus deal (due to large number of employees)? Why so little interest for this stock? Where's the crowd?
earnings are not the problem it's the sharks flush with cash looking for new things to Feast on. they need to get burned to stop the frenzy
I missed the boat on this one. oh well. too rich for my blood.
Late to the game blow off top losers who will hold the downside risk.
Anyone know when is the dividend date and how much for KSS? Thanks.
They were covering some XRT and Macy’s but actually shorted more Kohl’s. As of 10/31 there are nearly 30M shares short now. They are going to get burned if retailers rally into the holidays.
Why is Yahoo showing earnings of $1.99 while the financials on Yahoo show a loss?
"Investors have realized what an amazing company Kohl's Corporation is moving forward.,"
BOYCOTTING AMAZON yet? If not you are helping the enemy take away KSS business.
I will buy at $15
Stimulus announcement tomorrow....will be 50!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
19 on the way then 22+ LOLOLOLOL
We will close $14 today or tomorrow
Most kids will not be going back to school so no need for school shopping. Bars and nightclubs are not open so people will not be buying clothes as much....things going back to $10
@gerhard would you expect shorts to cover before the dividend so they don't have to pay it?
"Big move in value plays today, looks like we are seeing where the money is rotating into now. This will be an interesting run into the New Year for Kohl's."
"I posted here about a year ago that Kohl’s would earn $6 a share this year. How I knew this was because of the interest payment reductions, inventory reductions leading to increased margins, lower stock denominator from share buybacks, competition closings, historically low unemployment, the rollout of BOPIS, and finally the right moves into the leisure apparel with Nike. I’m expecting a dissent 2nd quarter with the early back to school and the Amazon Prime day that has spread out across all retail. 4th quarter will have easy comps. Going forward 2020 savings in store leasing from the store resizing can start to be realized. Significant investments in technology should start paying off as the line between retail and tech companies blurred. Improved spending in marketing not just the same old Kohl’s cash TV ads but more digital targeted and social media influences. Kohl’s needs to win back those shoppers that went to the deep discounters like TJ Max, Ross & Burlington by leveraging the omnichannel.The valuation of Kohl’s stock and of retail in general will take some time to work out. My personal experience of Kohl’s stock is that over the long term given the perpetual dividend increases, strong balance sheet, & stock buybacks its a safe bet. Will Kohl’s stock ever go back down below $40 a share? I have seen crazier things happen. If it does go down that means more stock being bought back. Could it go over $100? Probably eventually. I mused a take out target for Kohl’s of $120 but now I am foreseeing more of a partnership happening. Like I have said before here, there are several different types of Kohl’s stock owners and traders that effect the short term. The algorithms that take the stock up and down, retail xrt investors, income investors, dividend reinvest, stock buyback, value investors, the short sellers and on any given day they all behave differently."
Going down and down?
"BOYCOTTING AMAZON, yet?"
Just wait till digital Margin-Call-Matilda hits email accounts 1pm tomorrow. Whoooppeeee!!!
Bought more today on the value investment premise. Spanking of the past week is completely disconnected from reality. Kohl's inn JC Penney or Sears (or even Home Depot).
At $36 premarket this is a steal!Will more than double very soon!
Buy now! Early Thanksgiving sale but for Kohl's stock!
Irrational drop from recent 30. Now back to 30. What a roller coaster.
I think we see 14's today ... market in general coming back to reality.
The upward move in kss stock is only beginning. Stocks fluctuate. Shorts are die hards and traders are happy with jumping in and out for tiny profits. The real giant moves upward are just beginning folks. Wait until shorts capitulate at around $50 to $60/share to see the big moves yet to come.Dumb shorts think covid will save them but fact is markets trade in advance of good news. Fact is several vaccine are in FDA approval any day will receive approval ending covid.Next year will be a monstrously positive year/year for sales and earnings. 4th quarter will end with excellent sales and a huge profit for KSS. Then reinstatement of the dividend. This is winner stock pick for the long term investor!Dont be fooled by daily fluctuations. Yesterday was an opportunity to buy more.
"25% of Kohls Q4 2019 sales were through ecommerce, that number will accelerate now. Q4 202 sales will be respectable, then around mid 2021 they should be in shape to reinstate the dividend. By that point the stock will be north of $35. I feel it's a good buy at $18, great at $15. It helps to know a lot of people that shop and work here, Kohls will make it, no doubt in my mind.Macy's and Kohls do not directly compete as Macy's is upper mid class. Kohls avg customer has a household income of $60k. JC Penny should go the way of Sears / Kmart, eventually, gone. Plus JC Penny doesn't have near the Omnipresence of Kohls, Kohls always gets their customers back in, usually with Kohls cash, JC has no loyalty except Spaphoria, which I believe is owned by Louis Vuitton."
Strong buy!

"Every morning the manipulators like to get the NEW LONGS, LET IT RUN YOU LAPPERS!!"
"Sell it dump it short it drop it, just let it go, low 40's might be fun."
Online Sales were excellent...yeah stores closed screwed the quarter and will probably dampen next quarter.But where do you think all your wives will be going once the lock down is easing and Kohls stores reopen? You know they will all be looking to get away from us husbands and catch up on their KOHLS SHOPPING....$25-30 a share by end of year...IMHO
"Surprised to hear the negative statement. Kohl’s is a great working-class store with all merchandise being used in every home. Designer and high-end staff - not there, go to Norman’s. But for normal working class folk, this store is highly regarded"
10% haircut while mask restrictions are disappearing and people are getting back to work? C'mon. Overdone. Back to $60 we go!
$14 buy hit may happen today or Thursday...ready
Hello 40s.. So happy to see you. Onwards to 50 and above.

"Shareholder meeting 8am Wednesday, then earnings Tuesday 05/19/20."
"Dropping in for first time in a while to potentially get in on a little squeeze action here in retail land. Retail sales up over 17% in May and this should increase the buying speculation down the food chain to places like $GME, $MIK, $KSS, and $M."
Basically giving up the gains from yesterday. Will be interesting to see how this stock rebounds. It most certainly should at least trade at a 10 P/E which is normal for companies whose earnings are somewhat stable or slowly declining. I think a run to the 200 dma is likely also in the cards but the data doesn't yet say we should be breaking above. If they continue with the strong buyback and can but back another 5M shares before the end of the fiscal year we should be looking pretty solid for 2020.
$30 by end of June. Stores now open in California too.
Sephora deal!!!HUGE
"Not a bad day, if you look at the unadjusted faked by some Democrat operative in DC number, you see retail sales from Feb-Apr increased about 4.5% compared to last year. Should make for some nice earnings reports. How can spending in real dollar terms go up so much? Close to 3% is wage gains, the rest comes from the 2.1+M jobs that were created in that time and a little bit from the tax cut. Most of the tax cut really won't hit till next year when people get that child tax credit to juice their tax returns."
"and now that the hype is over and the suckers have bought in expect this to be on a downward path for at least two more weeks. The shorts have already begun to load up, but you know how Wall Street works."
"What happened to the $6 gap down to $19 that fear monger predicted yesterday? What happened to all the poor 'idiots' that bought at $22, $23 and $24 while smart guy shorted the stock?It is pretty likely this stock will continue to move around $6 between the highs and lows in the coming months, I just don't know what the new resistance and support levels will. Michael will get one of his prediction right one of these days, though likely the $14-15 ship has sailed. A broken clock is right sometimes."
in 2 or 3 weeks all your going to see on the news is massive lines of people trying to shop!
god that was the most double ugly report I ever saw!

"Just bought some more for my IRA. Fundamentals are good, dividend is pretty nice, and it seems like there's more upside than downside potential.I'm hesitant to add more to my non-IRA, because that sort of makes me ""committed"" for a year (for tax reasons), and I just have a hunch that there will be a major overall market correction sometime during that time. I'm certainly not _selling_ any shares that I already own, though... IMHO, you'd have to be an absolute moron (or a ""chartist"", which is just a special kind of moron) to do that."
"There is huge pent up demand for clothes by everyone that has been in quarentine. As the country opens, Kohl's will be the best option/value. People don't like buying clothes online. They want to try it on first. Also, Kohl's customers love Kohl's cash and deals, especially now."
"Retail stores are getting a raw deal, people are going to Walmart, Target, Cosco, mom and pop grocery stores, Walgreens, Rite Aid, Joan fabrics, many more. Government should give all these retail stores like Kohl’s, American Eagle, Under Armour, Macy’s, guaranteed money for shutting down, do they think the virus won’t be at Walmart or Target? Kohl’s should reopen and let people decide if they want to go there or not."
People just learning that they can return Amazon stuff at Kohl's. Prime Day returns will get everyone excited about this
"@Jack Bauer fitting rooms will not be closed forever and people can always go to the store and return after trying at home. Better than having to ship back with shipping fee or restocking fee with online retailers. Believe me I know how shopping works! TJ max, Ross kind of shoppers are not the same as kohl’s shoppers. Ross, TJ max have different kind of set up and get left over items, one or two pieces here and there. They don’t have all sizes. Kohl’s competition is Macys, JC Penny. You go and do some research before throwing out random opinion. I never step my foot at TJ Max/Marshall’s they are essentially the same and Ross. It is frustrating to shop there. All clothes piled up. I am sure bargain shoppers like these shops but there will always be shoppers like me who like middle range stores like kohl’s. Or Nordstrom, Bloomingdales or Ross!"
"The Effect of Rising Gas Prices on Retail: First, consumers cut back on their trips to the grocery store, or any other store that carries even the most essential items, let alone department storeSecond, they spend less when they get there. When the price of gas rises just 5 cents a gallon, that's maybe an extra $10 per week. When it rises 15 cents or more, that can translate to $20 each week out of the pockets of many who can't afford to add an extra $80 to their monthly budget.Gas Prices since the beginning of the year: Los Angeles - $3.64 from $3.07 approaching the magic $4; Chicago - $3.07 from $2.78; Philadelphia $3.0 from $2.64....Therefore for Los Angeles that is $128 more per week; Chicago $58 more per week; Philadelphia $72 more per week. We will see soon what these high gas prices will do to consumer spending."
"this stock doesn't move in line with TGT, this is so boring"
"Great long term investment. Remember investing is about patience, doing your homework and diversification with a long term horizon of at least 5 years.Crazy temporary bear markets, nutty things like covid nonsense come up during your investment's life but be disciplined and stay the course. The rewards are well worth it."
Moving toward my buy point 48-49
pure manipulation but can't do anything about it
When Bank of America rates your stock at 17$ that stocks is going to go to 17$
How can KSS and M be positive when so much of the rest of the market is down? Any insight into how to make sense of this? Thanks
Definitely long is the best place to be here. Sit back and enjoy the long profitable ride.
is Amazon using kohls as part of their warehouse distribution
"why do the shorties sound so desperate, I thought they were driving this ship"
$KSS leading indicators sensed the turn of this trend in mid - April. A combination of product competition and earnings led to today's fall. https://www.blusignalsystems.com/leading-indicators-sense-kss-stock-under-pressure/
KSS reached a new 52 Week High at 79.66
Somebody knows something about earnings?
Want alerts on momentum stocks before the run happens? I have the solution…Google “LionStackAlerts” and thank me later.
"people fear covid-19 shopping online,however online sales sure be peaked now,because covid-19 have peaked,all states Will not close again,so kss have been bottomed,it's time to buy it, shoes and clothes sales strong rebound in July,it will continue grow 4years,FL sales very strong in July quarter,"
Price dropped to over 5% yield so I got a batch @ 53.30. Will hold for dividend until turnaround which might be sooner than later ! Saw they had declared the divvy on May 15 (for June 11) so at least I know I'll get that one and hopefully they'll keep coming without a cut.
DEFINITELY IT WILL GO UP
"I just sent my last dime at a Kohls store after they opened up to amazon. Nothing like letting the fox in the hen house. They held the door open. It isn't enough that amazon sneaked on line sales from them, they opened the door and invited them in. I still have a gift card that I need to go spend and that will be it. NEVER again will I set foot in one of their stores. I hope the stock goes to zero."
"Appreciate the info on this page. Bought 50 shs around $41 in Jan 2017 and 18+ months later and it's over $70, so lucky pickup on my part. It was a rough ride for much of 2017, though. Based on the comments I've read, I will look to stay in KSS for the near-term, to be sure. That is a difficult decision when I've gained better than 80% on it..."
"There are several different type investors involved with Kohl’s. These investors haven’t changed much over the last 10 years. There are the index’s like the xrt retail index, dvy income index, spyb buyback index, rpv value index.Then there are the big institutional holders Blackrock which has been selling a little ,Vanguard which has been buying a little & JP Morgan has been the biggest seller. Then there are the algorithm traders that leverage the small relative available float which accounts for most of the day to day movement. This stock moves up and down like a yo-yo. Fundamentals continue to be very strong. Management will have to come through to take it out of it’s rut. That means executing on the initiatives The battle is being waged on several fronts, The online assault by Amazon and now some of its peers with the omnichannel. The bargain basement stores which grew out of the recession with excess inventories and a weak consumer. Making stores more of a destination. Finally the changing consumer tastes of dressing less formal."

bad reaction to earnings I assume
How low we going here?
"I still believe Amazon is going to buy Kohl's any day now. The rumors about Amazon doing this were strong in January and Amazon already partners with Kohl's so Amazon customers can pick up purchases there or return Amazon purchases at Kohl's. Amazon has also said they would like retail locations to compete with Walmart (just like when they bought Whole foods). Kohl's has 1100+ locations all over the country in ""Prime"" locations. The Kohl's stock price is too low for Amazon not to make an offer right now, and Amazon stock has held up pretty well though all of this. $10B is nothing for a company worth over $1T."
Right now is a Kohls gift ... to get out before the next move down. Will you take this gift?
Pos stock
I fully agree with Jeff Scott post....it will never be the same and consumers are scared and not spending until 2021. Avoid owning retail stocks in 2020...period
"Having a nice day. RSI is at 74, but I'm staying long."

"I am in at 56. Despite the lower than expected numbers, it is not like KSS is not still producing a solid EPS."
"Lets put this into perspective! The bailout from the government is three trillion dollars. That's 3,000 billion! Kohls should be able to get hopefully 1 billion of those monies on the high side? I believe that this is a bottom at this price?? Hopefully this could be 25 dollars a share by earnings."

"Kohl’s has Fila Outlet stores. Wow, they can sure spot fashion trends. Maybe next year the can open up some Sam Goody outlets and sell some cassette tapes. Kohl’s longs for the days of smoking in airplanes, rusty American made cars and the Cold War. Too bad those days are over and it is a bloated, debt laden dinosaur of a company.Strip mall retail is dead except for Five Below, that concept has about 5 years left."
Do they rpt on open or close?
KSS stores + LE internet sales network = marriage of survival!
"Losers missed the move from 10.00 to 53.00 thinking they are going to make money buying here....lol. You have huge downside risk buying here. Sorry baggies this is not how to make money in stocks, you buy low sell high. You are someone's profit and will make nothing. This is another JC Penney."
"Kohl's also raised its quarterly dividend 11% to $0.61, good for a dividend yield of 4%. Nice dividend payback"
"Ugly open, if it doesn't rebound well later this day post the CC gotta reassess whether you want to hold it through the pain of a coming recession or not."
imagine if you shorted big just a few days ago. now that is severe pain! what you gonna do?
$50 plus and counting! Next the 60s! My expectation is kss hits 75 by year end! Expectation is $5/share profits in 2021.Mid 20s PE ratio is reasonable
Still can't believe this stock is just flying and no one is here...I'll be rich be myself then...
Above 45 today and rising!! We have a long way to go up! Enjoy the prosperous ride!
Positive again tomorrow.

@cavelizard. Too bad you shorted this stock but your bashing it will not help a bit.After earnings get ready to cover the dividend or cover now while it's still under $60.
People have lost their mind. They will loose there family and everything in this manipulative market. This is going down .
"Too funny, all of the shorts are attacking the retail and fashion sector claiming bankruptcy is around the corner. Let's be clear here, this is merely a gross overreaction to a strain of the flu, nothing more, mortality rate is actually lower than the current strain of the Spanish flu. Not saying it is time to buy yet, but if you have cash and do not invest it into any of the sector after we see three straight green days you are a frigging idiot. This game or scam as the case may be will go down as the greatest buying opportunity of our life, even exceeding that of the 2008-09 financial meltdown, because the recovery will be ten times as fast, I predict we see a Dow over 30K by end of year."
Very good posts by rational investors; very refreshing. I responded to some.
Kohl’s sent $10Free Khols cash. Desperate
Getting closer to my 42 entry
Can we see a green day?
Get out
KSS paid dividend today. at the current price it is 20%
"4 months below the 200DMA now....if KSS can break above, it will be clear sailing to $80"
Is this what the future holds for the S@P?
DOW futures up 748 points.
Excellent earnings surprise.They are executing quite well in an extremely adverse covid environment.Imagine post covid their performance.Great results by management.
"Yes, of course Kohls lost 40 percent of their sales last quarter. Why? Because half of the quarter all their brick and mortar stores were closed. Historically in the USA 75 % of all clothes sales are at brick and mortar stores.Thus half of 75% is 38% so rounded that means one would expect Kohls to have lost 40% of their sales and that's what happened.Naturally, now their stores are open and soon will all be open they will regain all those lost sales and this means future sales figures will continue to improve progressively.The CEO a very, very beautiful and highly gifted business woman said exactly that! She said this was the worst quarter and things will improve from here on. She has great creditability and I will say Kohls had an excellent 4th quarter and the stock would now be selling for $75/share if it weren't for forced closure of allKohls stores.The absolutely gorgeous CEO of Kohls also said they plan to restore the dividend and stock buy back program when we are done with this Covid 19 nonsense.This means stock holders are going to have a very profitable run over the next few years.Enjoy watching the shorts get burned as we profit. The beautiful and gifted CEO is just a plus."
Most retail stocks have risen in the past month in anticipation of earnings. The big boys got in early and will take profits. Saw this one coming.
Such a good stock! Still has a lot to go up!
good sign long term if it holds 40 this week
KSS is the new Sears/KMart. G/L
Is Amazon insanely priced? Yes. By all metrics.When the balloon pops where going to go?Thats right to stocks like KSS for a huge 200 percent plus holiday season cheerful lift>
Hi guys. I am neither long or short. I just drop in from time to time. A few years ago I used to buy at $36 and sell at $43. I said that I will buy back in under $40. Still watching
it's funny I read about all these Kohl's Long's waiting for the Amazon buy out just like Macy's people are waiting Dillard's people are waiting Bed Bath & Beyond the dollar store everybody thinks Amazon is going to save them not going to happen
"Shorts turned into the ""bloody chicken effect"" now I know its time to load up calls down here so predictable."
yikes. what's up with retail?
I’m just hoping with this one tomorrow. Coulda sold at 5 percent loss today but stuck it out. This has room to fall hard on low guidance. Still trading much higher than peers. Not feeling good about my position right now but it is what it js.
I bought stocks last year in September. Can somebody tell me how much dividend would I be getting per stock and what is the latest date I have to keep the stocks to get the dividend? is it March 17th or March 31st?
So glad I didn't buy this thing for $50 back in December. A 75% haircut in 3 months. Yikes.
Does kss stock go green tomorrow or stay red? What's everyone's thoughts ?

I gave up on this company when they announced they were selling the Marxist BLM apparel.
"I've been watching the Amazon partnership with interest, keep wondering if at some point Amazon doesn't decide to do the same thing with KSS as they did with WholeFoods and buy them out for the physical locations. Unlike most of the other retailers that have their presence in malls, Kohls own's virtually all of their own real estate. If the new partnership model with Aldi's plans out for Kohls, I can see Amazon deciding to take over Kohls and do the same with their WholeFood's stores, displacing Aldi's.Thoughts?"
seems to be facing strong resistance at around $21. need some good news to bust above.
How are the longs feeling??? I’m in since $20. Still feel good about long term outlook
KSS is doing way better than M. Sales will soar in summer. This is the Best Buy point
"just saw on TV where Amazon is buying Kohls, oh wait that was the cartoon channel.......hahahaha....LOSERS !!"
back to $21 soon
Kohls come back will be with half of sears customers and half of JC penny's customers! s&p will double the last highs! i think Kohls is going to be a wheel barrel full of fun!
"Press ReleaseKohl’s announced today that it has T-Fal frying pans and Chefmate toasters on sale.Huge news fellas get ready for this dinosaur to soar. Not a single thing innovative with this tired, old, dusty company.Looks like this board has a lot of captains who want to go down with the ship."
Received my dividend this morning. Thanks Kohl's !
"what's up with near 2x volume in friday, 2x and climbed, any news? short cover for richer soil?"
quick sand trap! you buy you stuck!
Kohl's and Sephora = more foot traffic = more sales = more profit.
I'll short this back down to 21. You small timers don't have the $ needed to fight such a force
"Only foolish people will sell now. Shorts are manipulating this stock. Now they want the price that they wanted and buying back. Main indexes are also green, Dow, Nasdaq, S& P. Hold this tight."
Nice little shake n bake into the close. Loose hands getting shaken out. Love it
Retest March low no later than August 15...panic sell waves in August
"I think we need to keep an eye on Dillards and Macy's as to how to value Kohl's in the future. Both are more heavily shorted than Kohl's but both are stocks that likely will show similar earnings stagnation/declines that Kohl's may be seeing over the next few years, at least in the eyes of the analysts. Clearly Dillard's is showing that a much higher P/E is possible, it really all comes down to how much supply of stock there is to buy. Kohl's has done a good job over the last year reducing the available supply of shares to trade, if they continue and shorts don't increase their position (unlikely with a sustainable dividend as high as Kohl's has) we could be seeing a slow bleed up over the course of the year as Kohl's shows it is stabilizing its business.Now don't get me wrong, this was the 3rd warning on 2019 earnings, so clearly one needs to be cautious, but the fact that same store sales were down only 0.2% shows that Kohl's business is a lot healthier than it was in the first half of the year. So that period was likely an anomaly caused by weather and the media selling an imminent recession story line and of course the massive tax increase consumers were supposed to be expecting from the Trump tax cuts. I can't recall how many stories about peoples taxes suddenly jumping for a sizable return to a sizable bill I heard early this year but it was quite a few."
Now this looks like a bit of a short squeeze starting to happen. Today's move is an indication that there isn't much cheap Kohl's stock left to buy at these prices. It will be interesting to see how high it runs into earnings. $90 might be in the cards.

seriously? this stock has run from 53 to 67 now since the first of January.....the runup into earnings is overdone....the upgrades on 1/12 were LATE....as usual. 14 bucks up in 19 days.....and 8 bucks past already raised price targetsThis retail --people....and shopping has tailed off bigtime.....its what you're gonna do...not what you did in Nov-Dec
Buy Kohl’s you fools! They announced four days ago they haven’t seen their store traffic down and they announced a dividend increase two days ago so their cash flow is still strong.
"No need to rush to sell or lock in short term profits. I think if you look at the pricing action over the last few days you see that we are just back to the level before earnings came out. Remember that earnings were significantly better than expected as was guidance. That means the stock should appreciate more just from that. Further, the dramatic change in 2018 and 2019 earnings projections from levels late last year clearly show that the Kohl's and retailers are fading storyline no longer applies to Kohl's. Indeed Kohl's has very strong earnings growth, the projections will increase as more analysts print their revised numbers, and that warrants a market multiple or even just a x1.5 times earnings growth or x17-x18 forward earnings. Given that Kohl's has 2018 earnings at $5.20 and 2019 earnings are likely to be significantly higher, likely nearly $6, Kohl's should be well on its way to a $100 stock price over the next year or two. That makes it a very attractive long term investment."
"Low volume but up over a buck, guess the shorts are on vacation today. Pretty clear that this stock only goes down when they short more, so it will be interesting to see what the short position looked like for 3/15 in a week or so. It is going to be painful to pay this dividend but I guess they got deep pockets and no one watching them waste the funds money."
Try to get some in the mid 30's............next week.
"Billion dollar buy back program seems extremely likely on the earnings release. They recently announced paying back a billion in debt, but with interest rates being so low and the stock price down 50% a buyback makes perfect sense. They will refinance the debt at 2% or lower and then start the buyback program to repurchase 20% or more of the float."
"KSS is just another example of why I always pull the trigger and sell for a profit, I can't imagine owning this at $79. just to see it drop to $50, usually once I've got 2~3 years of dividend payments in profit, I sell and don't look back!Sometimes I sell too early and the stock goes higher, but either way I walk away taking a profit to live to trade another day, that's just my rule!"
Russia is going to make a lot of money with their world wide covid vaccine which they plan on distributing to all the countries of the world starting in November this year.
"Wayyy too high ,, virus sends it back to 22.00"
Goodbye Norma Jean
Stock volume seems to be fairly anemic the last few days but the stock doesn't drop. To me that is signaling that the professional shorts are covering as much as they can without spooking the price. This morning we clearly saw a price imbalance at the open signaling that this strategy might not work much longer if the markets don't start to drop.

under valued 80 dollar stock buy and hold
"Looks like it was disclosed on the earnings calls that by pushing a friends and fanily event into Q1 from Q2, the numbers were benefitted"
"LET IT RUN YOU JACKHOLES,, forget pennies,take Dollars!It would be at 26 if not for you holes!!!!!"
wow...premarket I saws this hit 53..what happend at the open?
"All you shorties stop whining. Kohls ROCKED it during the pandemic. They should have folded. Instead, they took immediate, and very substanial, action, trimmed a lot of fat and going to be in very good shape for many years to come. And the amazon returns are very convenient, indeed, I've used it several times. I love kohls -- and Mrs Gass is hot! What else can one want!"
"Darn, missed the buy right on the open. Still doubled down though at these lower prices"
Juicy dividends and healthy capital gains coming our way for a nice long time to come.Great addition to any portfolio! This baby has a long way to go up!
KSS is a grossly overpriced stock in an overpriced market. Target should be in $20 area!!!
11 was bottom. shall not see that again.
"why Khols is falling, when all other stocks are up? specially when Covid vaccine announcement are there today"
"first 25% in at $72 (too early)next 25% at $65 (better)next 25% in at $48 (getting there)and then a double share at $33all along telling myself- when everyone else (sears, pennys, BB&B, macys, et al) go out of business, someone with the right business model is going to make lots of money. Kohl's is the store. I may trim holding a bit here but this company is a long term hold."
