Recent headlines and conversations for W
"Let's try this again. ""Left pointed out that the average order size on Wayfair is $235, whereas the most popular Restoration Hardware item is a $10,000 cloud couch.""Left is right. That's why I bought a big chunk of 100 shares of RH and shorted W. :)"
"Social spacing in a furniture store ( RH, etc) will not be a problem when we open up. Usually only a few customers in each store at a time. W had a 2 quarter on line advantage when nothing was open that will dissipate"
"Now that Bozos is gone, do we even want to Amazon?"
"There is only 3 DOW30 companies green, and the green is weak. Folks rightfully are concerned about a 3 day weekend. Sooooooo much can happen, not sure if twitter is friend or fo.$spy$tsla"
"Well well well, another lockdown in Canada. US probably soon to follow? Back to online shopping it is."
"another day of making money....yawn.... wonder how much ill make tomorrow? same thing, every day..... make money. remember that day last month when it didnt go up? a Thursday, I think.... the was something..... anomaly."
definitely a stock market bubble company...waiting to short...lol
"Sam, TTD is tanking big times . Hope you did not buy too many shares . Great company But with this market you never know. Good Luck if you still have it."
"No shot they are profitable this q, look at nike. Online sales destroyed their margins"
Short squeeze.....42% shares held short. Not a fan of the stock but that is the reason for the action today....increase in sales trumped lower margins and increase in losses
at least $150-$165 by year's end
Where can I get some those 12k pillows
Sincerely yours...W mgmt dumping stocks for you with steady drumbeat. https://investor.wayfair.com/m/#/SEC_Filings
"this quarter will be the biggest loss ever.. no revenue, no buyers, no expense reduction, cost of goods increased... you got it"
WATCH FOR THE EPIC FALLING KNIFE
Back to double digit....no EPS for years...
I’m going to miss Sam
This pos has a 7% operating loss while only grossing 20% off product. It will never and I repeat never make any money and if it does it will be minimal. This is a $20 stock at best. Amazon was always trading at high multiples because they had many things working in the pipeline. This pos just sells furniture. lol
"The selling is over done, in over all markets. I feels big bump up before tomorrow options"
Nice double top soon. will reshort 350
Should rebound around 2:30 or so.....yawn.........think I'll have a snack..
Well the other thing we have going for us now as well is seasonality. Next two quarters are the best time of year for home retailers.
Its a cost cutting initiative for reaching the profits sooner. This should be a welcome move with stocks going green.
I’m hoping for 60 in August. Going to lose another 285 million this q. Going to be a blood bath
"Today's $20 billion enterprise valuation is 1.2-times the sales and 170-times the operating cash flow predicted for 2021 by the analysts that FactSet surveys. Wayfair's ( W ) sales multiple is smaller than rivals like Amazon ( AMZN ), but most big e- commerce firms have real cash flow. A return to Wayfair's ( W ) average price of 0.9-times forward sales would drop the stock 25%.The company has had a harder time proving that it can make money on those sales. While Wayfair ( W ) revenues grew by a third in 2019, its net loss doubled to $985 million, or $10.68 a share. Like most public companies these days, Wayfair ( W ) likes to direct investors to measures of cash flow that omit expenses otherwise counted under generally-accepted accounting principles. Any way you look at it, however, the business burned cash. Its ""adjusted"" earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were negative $500 million in 2019 -- more than double the negative number of the prior year. Include capital spending and software development, and Wayfair's ( W) negative free cash flow surged fourfold last year, to minus $600 million."
From 280 to 259 is something market doesn't like. I be careful for now. I have been selling all the high flyers lately.
pad your margin and ride the waves up and down. 
closing at $165 today and $153 first stop by end of week...Enjoy the downward ride....tick tock...
If anyone doesn't think the stock market is in the biggest bubble of all time....just look at Wayfair's financial statements and earnings over the past 36 months. Case closed. I am not short....just good at looking at financial statements. A pig is a pig....no matter how much lipstick you put on it.
"Suppressed news last week-12 million shares diluted at approx $230 each!!! Adds 25% to float-yup, that’s $3 billion for insiders"
"Goldman's Algo seems to be about 40% of the traded volume. The equity is dislocated from the market. It does not appear to be widely held or followed. Debt - all convertible to equity at the choice of Wayfair. The conversion rates made sense if the stock went to $280. At current levels, the debt is worth nothing.A source of ""financing"" that few people spot is the gap between A/R and A/P. this number is HUGE for W. that works fine as long as sales are ALWAYS increasing. I yields a boomerang effect if / when sales slow. I am guessing that sales are very slow. Wayfair does not have enough cash to pay the A/P balance. Usually financing agreements have cross-default clauses. If W fails to pay their vendors, then supply will terminate immediately. This singular element can unwind Wayfair in 7 weeks."
What is happening? Why down? Shorts manipulating?
Reviews regarding Wayfair product quality and customer service are alarming. It doesn't matter which review site you look at.....all bad.https://www.bbb.org/us/ma/boston/profile/furniture-stores/wayfair-llc-0021-90233/complaints
Still too high. It will hit 164. But it really should be at 80
So is this a good stock to short for earnings?
"Well, this only has about another $100 to fall before reaching a fair valuation."
"What happened? Ladies & Gents, that's called a REVERSAL. Going down big time, this is the last hurrah for longs. SELL"
"W is offering underwriters $112.5 million in juice. That is a 15% cost to W do do this ""cash up"". Very, very expensive. No word on the interest rate yet but I suspect it will be fairly low.Wayfair is burning cash faster than everyone thought. Paying for that growth curve ain't cheap!""Free"" delivery of your heavy Chinese furniture. Hah. Nothing is free."
why wouldn't they just take on unsecured notes? why do they have to do something dilutive to equity holders?
bottom falling out.
This can drop to 72 in the next few days.... or today... it gets punished each time it bounces
dont buy wayfair... look into TSLA
"With all their other problems lets not forget the huge money they put out for options on their last round of funding. They did this to not dilute. They have that listed as an asset that is going to have to be written off. So, their is another 150 million that is a fake asset. They have been cooking the books to write their losses off over time and it is going to bite them even more. Plus they depreciate very little that will need to be taken at some point"
This is the most frustrating stock to watch!Shorted it at $125 less than a month ago and everyday rips higher.
"THIS WILL CRUSH HARD, WAIT BURSTING HARD, BECAUSE BUBBLE BURST,!! SUB 100S AT LEAST TODAY"
"Love this stock. Covered a portion of my short around 9am andnow an hour later I'm getting ready to short more.Makes no sense, but if its going to stay this irrational I'm going to profit.Company has always been a money loser, and that doesnt change in adownturn."
Let’s see if it acts like it has been for the last week to ten days and closes below 45. 230-4 will be interesting
"A very simple consistent trend is the more Wayfair sells the more Wayfair loses, along with the more debt they take on. The trend is not always your friend."
Lunch time rally time to drink some tequila!!
This is hitting $290 tomorrow....called it first
"up 7% is a normal day for this stock. its goes up everyday atleast 7. nothing extraordinary here. i will say wow if it was up 15%. which it can be, just have patience."
"Topping seems to be over, we are now going downhill (which is always easier)."
"To validate my thesis, and in my opinion only, I think W will start to sell complete houses online. You purchase their amazing furniture, supported industry leading customer service (just look at the online customer forums!), and it is delivered in a house. You pay for the furniture and get the house for free. Likely not 1 day delivery at least initially."
"Sam , short TSLA ?"
Mike the rookie. I know you find it hard to believe but not all up days are bad for short sellers. You see I bought more puts when it was up 11ish and 12ish. You just have to have dry powder. Do not get me wrong. i want it down now. LOL
Needed a breather....tomorrow up $50!
"W has the safety of a bond, or money market fund, and yet massive growth in price...... the only way you can lose is shorting it.... I dont see any other possibility to lose money...... its a high growth stock and a bond at the same time!! its a hybrid !!"
China products manipulation Remember Luckin Coffee
Today is the closing date for the additional 198M of convertible notes available to private parties... Monday they will most likely dump many of these shares on the market. I am not implying a move up or down btw! Just stating some facts for thought
Bought the dip this morning. Solid support at 233 no matter how much all these shorties try to scare you. Hold till 285
loosing out due to a trade war is irrelevant since Wyfair already looses what amount to a negative 10% of revenue .They cannot make a profit without the tariffs so these business factors are just more noise to the business of stock options and management enrichment. Investors will loose out in the end as Wayfair looses more and more $
"13-Fs won't be out for about 60 days for Sprucey House...A thanks in advance to MS, Jeffries, et al for allowing the Roth...I mean Sprucey House to unload to your trading desks!!!!!"
I know nothing about this stock. But I do know something about the junk they sell. They shipped me furniture where the parts did not fit. When I try to get to customer service it takes me 5 days. They sell junk that is very cheap. I am shocked that people buy this stock without verifying that what they sell is quality. Wayfair is not quality. It is the cheapest junk you can find and this will eventually catch up with them and people will not buy cheaply and poorly made items and furniture. Total junk.
"This has about the same ""market capitzliation"" as Ikea which seems on the conservative side. No one can currently really go to Ikea and Wayfair can sell online so they don't have to worry about the ""covid virus."" If Ikea can't make sales on home accents and things right now that means it is going directly to Wayfair so this has a ton of room to grow."
Short interest is down 50% from highs of mid February and 30% or so in last month .... still over 5 days to cover... may need to come down a bit more.
"“Potential threatsWayfair reported revenue growth headwinds in Canada in the second quarter. This was due to macroeconomic challenges that could persist over the medium term. The outlook for the retailer's wider international business could deteriorate as, according to the GfK consumer sentiment index, confidence among U.K. shoppers is at its lowest level since 2013. Similarly, U.S. consumer confidence reached its lowest level in almost three years in August, which may slow down the company's near-term sales performance.In response to weak trading conditions in Canada, the company is seeking to reduce its costs through increasing investments in its supply chain. This caused an improvement in its sales performance in the second quarter versus the first quarter. This trend is expected to continue for the remainder of the year.Although consumer confidence in the U.K. is low at the moment, wage growth is at its highest level since 2008. This should help to support demand for the company's products, with the retailer's second-quarter results highlighting that its U.K. operations are performing in line with its own previous guidance. In addition, the region contributed to a 47% increase in international revenue in the second quarter.”"
"Still too expensive, 2 is coming, going bankrupt soon"
W is down 5.58% to $117.72
Cheat code: sell everything for 90% off then claim a 20% sales increase?

Wayfair reached an all time high at 319.85
"We've seen this movie before! Opportunistic traders and longs, or those looking to get long, should know the drill by now.It was just 100 days ago Wayfair got similarly whacked on the open after last Q announcement. We were aggressively buying that morning between $57 - $60. We sold those trading shares earlier this month in the $90's. We will be buying those shares back once the dust settles here. Shampoo, rinse, repeat.Core holding remains untouched."
Anybody long as this as a hedge against a short on TSLA? As I see it they are one in the same both no profit that keep rising. If I make a bundle on this I'm out.
Fed putting 1 trillion in market. What I was afraid of selling now
Bought 450 shares of W at $98 last week and sold on Friday at $123. I was bullish because covid helped W but at 123 this company is way above its pre-covid level. Will wait for earnings now.
Wayfair will tank as we edge toward a Recession Housing slows down as does bigger purchases like furniture. Companies like wayfair that are nowhere near profitability will be killed
Looks like Truist will be involved in the upcoming convert. With MS lead manager.
It's irresponsible for big media to not cover this. CNBC has NOTHING about this.
Bear trap. Sit in cash bears so you can average.
Does anyone know what are the perks of being a Fed regional director? does that include a Plunge Protection Team hotline to prop up your company stock?
sam was right this is a safety stock. Market it down it safely goes down. market up it safely goes down. It is safe to say it will go down regardless. Oh yea he said he sold his lol bwaaaaa. And he still does not want to take my bet to compare portfolios. lol
Corrupted WS raised the stock knowing recession is coming.

Going to $120 very soon!
Target is 200. Let it open. People find this bargain and load.This is low float and very rare to get growth stock like this. Next TSLA.
Wayfair reached an all time high at 195.07
"There are so many more factors to make this drop than those in its favour. Example: CV ends, China trade war, other large cap stocks with earnings/dividends and growth potential, future of biopharma/tech, creditors calling in loans, unionisation, bankruptcy, etc. Don't con yourself into thinking W is can keep going up. Sell and make more elsewhere."
I guess longs missed the cnbc youtube video about how wayfair loses more money as they sell more products.
Just a quiet week. Will drop significantly next week.
"Just got back on board . Hopefully, I can get my money back from NVDA."
no volume to speak of...... just the insiders selling..... they know a storm is on the horizon!
Short position at 321
might be time to go long again!! I can feel it.......
SELL!!!
Still going strong to 416 with resistance at 366.
Job cuts of that size (another 40 +/- in Boston) are too small to have required filings with Mass Dept of Labor so stay under the “radar screen” I believe... everyone has their resume’s out... and ticked since the options given from ‘18 and ‘19 to incent the hiring are now deep under water
Even AMZN can't push this down as a way to celebrate prime day!!! I'll laugh about it when we buy them!!!
"""Despite its climb to new highs, Wayfair is trading at 1.4X forward 12-months sales estimates. This marks a discount compared to its industry’s 1.9X average and its own five-year highs of 2.1X, as well as eBay’s EBAY 2.8X, and Amazon’s 3.2X""I just read this in some article.The only difference I can point out in why W might not be valued the same forward-sales wise as AMZN and EBAY is possibly because they loose 1 Billion dollars a year when AMZN and EBAY earn Billions a year.I know it's a ticky-tack point but you know...I for one cannot wait to buy Puts on this hopefully it rallies a bit higher next week.Absolutely insanity.If this doesn't prove we're are in a bubble, I don't know what will.Good luck!!!"
No talk of the $3 billion dilution adding 12 million shares at only $230???
when is earning?
Short squeeze is coming. No more shares left to short. $10 day jump is coming.
"Oof, Wayfair can’t even turn a profit with the help of covid!"
See you at $153 on friday 3/8....
Time for a pullback and not just W. This market needs to pull back in order to go higher. It's getting tired after 9 straight weeks of gains. Going all cash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
already making money on my buy this morning..... Thats the way I like it!!!!
How much did the MarketWatch article cost? They are throwing dollars at it trying to deflect attention.

"Beat every metric revenue, eps and margin to 30% vs 28% expected. They projected strong growth in Europe."
Two days after earnings some Institutional owners will sell! Earnings will be good but 100% of the earnings goes toward expenses cannot be sustained
Great i just bought earlier and its right about to trigger stop loss  disappointed wayfair
I guess no one will buy this stock at this price. Only short will cover. So the firm will keep raising the price to make $ from shorts?
"yawn....... TOM, I covered half my short yesterday..... had to the some profits......missed shorting the pop this morning, too... was involved in other stocks.... busy morning."

"Remember, this can rise 30 points for no reason. Only well capitalized shorts need apply."
Do a google image search for anything on wayfair and you will find it for 20% to 50% cheaper on another site online. Wayfair charges way more money and still can't make a profit. What does that tell you ?

I’m a bull on Wayfair but this is just ridiculous imo. I’m selling here this just doesn’t feel right
The price action today shows off the utter absurdity of this POS stock.
I hve been seeing the kelly clarkson commercials all over the tv. I guess they hired her to reduce that advertising expense they were talking about lol. Sanju always speed what he thinks the analysts want to hear. They have no plans to tune it down. Not can they afford to at this point
"This is a beautiful thing when your strategy comes to fruition! Everybody take a look at WIX also, same exact reason it went way way too high is the reason it will fall greatly. As everybody gets back into the stores these companies will not do too well."
They are reaching for the puts now at the ask. Total manipulation.
"Is W eligible for S&P 500 index inclusion now? I'm not predicting this will happen now, just wondering if they qualify. Following is text from S&P on their requirements:To be eligible for S&P 500 index inclusion, a company should be a U.S. company, have a market capitalization of at least USD 9.8 billion, be highly liquid, have a public float of at least 10% of its shares outstanding, and its most recent quarter’s earnings and the sum of its trailing four consecutive quarters’ earnings must be positive."
the volume is getting SO small... a blind man can tell there is no power left in this one to keep moving up! WHO WITH RESPECT TO THEIR MONEY would buy into a 30$ stock at 190$
Looks like the squeeze! I should buy and get out after a $1 up quick $500
"Wayfair has negative shareholder equity (liabilities exceed assets), this is a more serious situation compared with a high debt level."

Wayfair is up 8.63% to 292.58
Just got an alert before the bell on W from (http://sharelabs.xyz). You think it will move the stock?
wow. up 2% when market down 400 pts. looks like nothing can keep it down. biggest ponzi scheme!
if you want Wayfair to go down fast someone has to DDOS the Zack pumper.
"Yeeeeeesss!!! Go Go Wayfair! Earnings on Aug 5 will show 70% Increase maybe! ""Wayfair, Inc. W is scheduled to report second-quarter 2020 results on Aug 5.

gdp going to be down 14% in second q. Not only will w not have bigger q on q sales growth but they will decline. Throw in they will have a difficult time finding new funding and this equates to bk. There will be no bailout for w. They were not forced to close.
"their wardrobes comes with abused kids? cost 15k per kid or wardrobe. this company need to be shut down immediately and all management should be jailed. cant make profit by selling furniture alone, so selling children. just thinking about it makes me sick to my stomach!"
"There is ZERO chance this company has a chance to thrive. Google Wayfair Trustpilot. Trustpilot is one of the very few trusted review platforms out there. You WILL NOT believe the reviews that Wayfair get. What a joke. They will not be receiving any return business. Why not just buy from Amazon? Better pricing, better product, more selection and zero hassle returns."

The stock price is manipulated artificially to create fake technical indicators and signals
"one day soon the vaccine will come. on that day this stock will plummet back to $150, then oversell to $100. back to a cash burning loser in a saturated market"
Big upgrade. Charts are still pointing to 416 with resistance at 367.

Selling everything not for me will enter back at 110.00
"Market tanking and only down 1% !! What's that tell you?? ...lol...it's a defensive stock, too!! Hilarious."
Buy this and hold..... u wont regret
You guys think we have to wait till next earnings before the crash?
What does a run up like this lead to? Stock dilution.
Hopefully it will hit $190 tomorrow so I can buy Put option strike $170 for a cheaper price! .
Iam long for this one
W support itself by diluting shares and negative income since 2013
went SHORT early this morning-this is such a JOKE to watch the FALSE trades-NOT even a FOOL buys here-HA-Ha. the manipulators must keep buying so they don't look SO GUILTY-The SEC definitely should investigate these THIEVES who loaned money to wayfair!
"NASDAQ futures down big. This thing is going to get CRUSHED today, and likely also through the weekend."
"I don't believe any regular share holder is buying this stock at this ridiculous price, this has been investment firms pet stock all the time, just wait when one of these firm start dumping the stock, then it will crash in the speed like you never ever seen before. This is the MOST OVERVALUED stock in the market now."
W should soar again today..... RH and LULU raised guidance ...says tarrifs had little effect on online sales.....should cross $160 on the way to $200.
this will pop tomorrow morning from brokers calling short margins like always
Told ya so
I don't get it whas at 22 a few weeks ago now it's almost 80 I had 300 shares purchased months ago at 90 got rid of them I can't see this holding out￼ !!!!
alright so i did my research and it seems the more wayfair sells the more it loses sooo wouldn't it be more valuable if it just stopped selling anything?
"Read and learn:“What's the opportunity in Wayfair?The stock is currently trading at US$118 on the share market, which means it is overvalued by 45.7% compared to my intrinsic value of $81.06. Not the best news for investors looking to buy! But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Wayfair’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.“"
She will drop to 290 level by market close...
"This going to 45, the institutions are gonna dump this now. Watch for the big red candles. I’ll be then I’ll short it too."

I just bought 1800 worth of furniture bedding....going to just av. Furniture store in St Louis would cost 2900 min...then no sales tax and no delivery charge...local would charge 120.00 min....how can they make a profit??
How this can be so expensive and never make the earnings. Lol be careful people sell before earnings look at what is happening to other company’s dropping like a rock.
they are changing the ticker to PEDO I read
"As the economy opens up, for an online furniture company with massive debt and negative earnings, your shares will become more and more worthless. Sell everything and don’t look back."
zm w tsla am i forgetting any other overvalued stocks to buy puts on?
I am curious if any fund managers will take profits before the bell. If not then Monday could open down 20
"Example of a Stock Bubble: eToysThe internet bubble around the turn of the 21st century was an especially dramatic one. Numerous internet-related companies made their public debut in spectacular fashion in the late1990s before disappearing into oblivion by 2002. The story of eToys illustrates how the stages of a stock bubble typically play out.A Rosy StartIn May 1999, with the internet revolution in full swing, eToys had a very successful initial public offering, where shares at $20 each escalated to $78 on their first trading day. The company was less than three years old at that point and had grown sales to $30 million for the year ended March 31, 1999, from $0.7 million in the preceding year. Investors were very enthusiastic about the stock's prospects, with the general thinking being that most toy buyers would buy toys online rather than at retail stores such as Toys ""R"" Us. This was the displacement phase of the bubble.As the 8.3 million shares soared in its first day of trading on the Nasdaq, giving it a market value of $6.5 billion, investors were eager to buy the stock. While eToys had posted a net loss of $28.6 million on revenues of $30 million in its most recent fiscal year, investors were expecting the financial situation of the firm to take a turn for the best. By the time markets closed on May 20, eToys sported a price/sales valuation that was largely exceeding that of rival Toys ""R"" Us, which had a stronger balance sheet. This marked the boom and euphoria stages of the bubble.Shortly afterward, eToys fell 9% on concern that potential sales by company insiders could drag down the stock price, following the expiry of lockup agreements that placed restrictions on insider sales. Trading volume was exceptionally heavy that day, at nine times the three-month daily average. The day's drop marked a 40% decline in the stock, from its record high of $86, identifying this as the profit-taking phase of the bubble.Decline and FallBy March 2000, the panic stage had arrrived: eToys had tumbled 81% from its October peak to about $16 on concerns about its spending. The company was spending an extraordinary $2.27 on advertising costs for every dollar of revenue generated. Although the investors were saying that this was the new economy, such a business model simply is not sustainable.In July 2000, eToys reported its fiscal first-quarter loss widened to $59.5 million from $20.8 million a year earlier, even as sales tripled over this period to $24.9 million. It added 219,000 new customers during the quarter, but the company was not able to show bottom-line profits. By this time, with the ongoing correction in technology shares, the stock was trading around $5.Towards the end of the year, with losses continuing to mount, eToys would not meet its fiscal third-quarter sales forecast and had just four months of cash left. The stock, which had already been caught up in the panic selling of internet-related stocks since March and was trading around at slightly over $1, fell 73% to 28 cents by February 2001. Since the company failed to retain a stable stock price of at least $1, it was delisted from the Nasdaq.A month after it had reduced its workforce by 70%, eToys fired its remaining 300 workers and was forced to declare bankruptcy. By this time, eToys had lost $493 million over the previous three years and had $274 million in outstanding debt.TL:DR THIS IS A BUBBLE. DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU."
Ride the gain is how you make $ from this stock. Buying point $170
Cranking AH...Too cheap to ignore...+$300 / share by Aug. 31....On our way to $10Trillion..
"Low volume, short squeeze, consumer sentiment up a bit...but won’t last. Should go down soon and I believe will end the week lower than last Friday."
Drops past 280 and 230 will come quickly
Maybe not today or tomorrow at some point this will tank back to $130-150 range
Can I buy this with bitcoin?
good buying point

"this isnt 40$ yet? oh well, lets check next month"
"Wait all returns that have been put off to next quarter to pump this garbage to make quarter look good finally get accounted for and shows the manipulation - have a friend that had a damaged chair from a cheap junk table set, he complained they said they would send him a new single chair and they sent him a complete full second set. At least he can get 12 months instead of 6 mons from the cheap disposable garbage junk table set. I saw the quality and it’s not good. Bad business on both transactions from W- made no money = a loss !"
"Hello Wayfair Come on over to Overstock It’s our time now We welcome  you with open arms.Ps. Don’t be late, the reddit investors arrived early (after hours)See you all in the morning "
Between $55 to $67 there is big gap. It will fill it one day
"if the overall market pulls back you see this pull back huge. Then you hear... ""well it just had a great run for the 80's normal pull back"" and bagholders who bought 157 and higher will RUN"
"what you buy quality, it pays off!! stay away from overvalued hyped stocks!! buy proven business models and you wont be sorry...W business model was proven by amazon !! hence the incredible growth.."
You guys can all thank me for the this. evertime I buy a stock it will go down. I could show you. close to 40 % on Wayfair. oh and when I sold FB and Apple they doubled. anyone need help on making a fortune. I'll buy opposite of you. you win
"Before the pandemic, Wayfair had never turned a profit for 17 years of operation, since the founding of the company in 2002. In 2019, Wayfair had about $9 billion of revenue, but lost about ($1 billion), or lost ($8)/ share. With the pandemic, the very optimistic projection is for Wayfair to make $2.4/ share next year, instead of losing ($8)/ share in 2019 pre pandemic. Assuming Wayfair can achieve the extremely optimistic projection going forward and maintain $2.4/ share earning year after year, it would take about 100 years to return current share price of $236. Why would people choose to pay $24 billion, and projected forward P/E of 100 for a hugely money losing company with 17-year track record of massive loss, with the hope of turning profitable going forward ???"
if these were the numbers in Q2 2019 it would have been amazing. But they are not. they are during a global pandemic not seen since 1918. combined with work from home (which cycles often)
It was quick 16 points. Not going to touch now.
hope you hold on till 36 at least
I should charge for my advice!
"SORRY TOM, more pain today....... I sure wish you'd cover and join me in making money every day! its really a lot of fun!! you should try it........ I think you'd like it."
"Amazon moving into this space. How does W counter that? Answer, it doesn't. The valuation here is pure hopium."
SHORTED 208 TODAY THX SEE YA AT 60
Why did the bulk of the 10 insiders sell in July for $190’s up to $225 then just 5 days ago (Thursday July 30) 2 of them reported selling Almost $3 million worth for $248-$250 ? if the numbers are going to be so great....then why?
Let’s see how many PEDOs are converted to bag holders today.
Longterm puts in this as China tariffs will put a massive damper on this company’s ability to even pay its bills which are past due.
"I cant stop laughing !!....Tom, did you learn anything ?? did it happen just like I said it would?? lol...YES, of course, it did...you made money, just like everyone else that listened.....like ive been telling the rubes forever.....same pattern every day....buy the dip at the open and make money..."
Wow. This looks like fossil stock before crash and burn
"Everyone skeptical on W but bullish on e-commerce, look at OSTK. Not trying to plug. Just take a look at their balance sheet and P/L. Way better footing and room for growth. It has grown significantly since lows but compare apples to apples with Wayfair, and you will see much more potential. Good luck to all investors :)"
Negative earnings no problems
In at $86.35 good luck
"One look at Cloudera and Wayfair, both growing top line revenue with widening loss. Both are in hot sectors, Cloudera in cloud services for corporates, Wayfair in online shopping. Yet, their stock prices go different directions since their IPOs. Cloudera stock prices have been falling ever since, while Wayfair stock prices have been going up (amid occasional sharp drops). Compared to the duo, if both are having similar financial returns (negative) with similar business outlook (somewhat positive), why their stock prices go different ways? Is it time to be fearful on Wayfair? You will be the judge."
what a joke loser company. great at getting investors and great at selling at a loss. the business model has zero to do with making any profit for shareholders it is all about management cashing in on options. Selling goods at a loss is not sustainable but management awards work great for the select few
"Wait till the investigation into the money laundry scheme for $10,000 pillows and $14,000 storage cabinets begins that has been claimed was set up for child traffickers to get paid and clean their money. Oh oh"
"I sell a lot on Wayfair, volumes have definitely dropped since the peak a couple months ago. Also, not sure if anyone else had the same situation but payments have not been regular, in fact we had a payment declined on their credit card. it did eventually go through but it was declined. could be from excessive use which would be a good thing or it could be a bad thing. (yes Wayfair pays suppliers by credit card.)"
"Up on massive volume, while rest of the market struggling.."
Long my suggestion is to hold. Please do not sell. I do not want the shares I borrowed from you to be called just yet
"same level of sales as pre pandemic, maybe less, but such a great venue for cleaning up money."
"People - I work for a major retailer on the senior team..... Shipping goods does not make money, you cant compete with bricks and mortar on price! Wayfair / chewy will go bankrupt within 24 months!"
"This company is extremely overvalued. It is simply a drop-ship company that gets internet shoppers traffic from google top ad placements. This is a money losing business model. They will not be able to make any money for the short-term, intermediate term, or long term with this kind of business model. Is it worth 120? or 10 billion? Look at Pier 1 Imports which does $1.8 billion in sales and is valued between $200 million and $300 million. Now just because W does $5 billion or 3 times more than PIR, is it really worth $10 billion or 40 times more than PIR? There is not question, it is not worth it in my mind."
This is going to get shorted. All you longs be careful BEARISH
"Wayfair is terrible, ikea holds the crown"
"I need a little cash so I sold 30 at $164.6. I don't know how earnings will go but I think there is enough volatility after earnings and not right leading up that that it should dip toward $150 at some point in next couple of months. What could Wayfair announce in terms of surprise and good news? We know they are continuing to expand and hire and not improve profitability right now, so I expect yet another quarter of losses and guidance on continued losses that will scare some investors away. Are there any more bulls to attract?"
"Wow. Non-GAAP net loss doubles from a year ago and this POS is up?Growth at all costs. The second growth slows, W drops by half."
"and GREEN IT IS!!! Tom , sorry about your short at $141.12..... hang in there. might still be a good trade yet....... but looking worse each minute...."
Wayfair cannot even afford to air a commercial for more than 1 day
Fellow longs / True Wall Street Hedge Funders...I'll be doing a post-party on the 'Tucket next week following the conference in one of my Wayfair-furnished homes on the island..You are all invited!!!!
Is the online sales tax ruling by the supreme court going to hurt Wayfair?
"Can someone explain why all the e-commerce players fell today?Wayfair, Overstock, Chewy...the cases are rising... wouldn't that favor e-commerce?"
Tomorrow morning will proably be a good short. These bubble Sas internet stocks can't go up like this another day. This is ridiculous and absurd.
Robert! After this morning usuals! Market makers trying to pump this AM! It’s trading normal! I think so many of the guys who used to post here lost so much getting margin calls they no longer post! I am sure the way they were talking they contacted the SEC ! Will do them no good. It’s always been fixed and always will be.
W lost $1.28 a shares...consensus was loss of $1.10. Direction will be determined by number of repeat customers and growth....
nice rebound today!
"Retail stocks and essential stocks have finished their run. Now its time for food business, entertainment, travel and leisure stocks .Have enough money to handle W spike or buy calls, come back when it drops below 100."
why wayfair is still above 200?
"Again , strong but failed attempt to break through $323 ."
"What’s up with all the insiders selling? Close to 1,150,000 shares sold by insiders from March to April..., make any sense? And the insiders sold back in March 22nd, with 30 million people unemployed and more to come this Friday, this stock is overpriced, I’ve seen their site and a lot of their items are highly overpriced."
I guess these shorts are getting owned right about now 
"FWIW, many analysts are raising Wayfair price targets following earnings this week. I'm so glad their feeling better, and more confident now < >.Has anyone heard from Wedbush's Seth Basham following his downgrade last week prior to earnings? That was an unfortunate call. Wonder if he's been reassigned, or worse. Meanwhile, we're raising our 12 month price target to $118 from $108. Sorry haters!"
wowstill 32 over priced
one of biggest up days every and w only down 1.4%. I guess I will take it and be happy. Tomorrow another day.

"All you need to do is look at the ""Components of Our Results of Operations"" on the 10-K. Regardless of revenues growing, COGS, Cust Service/Merchant Fees, and Ops, G&A, etc are all going to stay at the same relative level as a % of sales. The only potential area for savings would be a lower % of advertising costs relative to sales. Advertising costs for 2018 were $774M, compared to a pre-tax loss of $502M. Maybe the dynamics or one of the underlying assumptions change at some point, but I don't even see where the company is planning (even on a LT basis) for becoming profitable."
170 in play.
"if there are no buyers and shorts don't cover, this thing will keep going down"
I knew when they spent millions in call options for loan covenants that they were in trouble. They were in dire need of money and borrowed at loan shark prices.
Unsustainable price. No profits- not very exciting line of furniture!
"Whispers are floating around that Wayfair will post some very robust numbers tomorrow morning. Also, expect solid guidance for the current quarter. Funding the European delivery network will put a drag on the bottom line, but looking for triple digit growth there, along with new records for active customers, repeat buyers, and avg. order value here in the US. In other words, the beat goes on..."

"Amazon is experiencing same problem spending a lot to get sales, what saves AMZN is highly profitable AWS and advertising, wayfair does have either but has all the increased competition from AMZN, SHOP, GOOGL and many many more"

"W has all the analysts greased with the $3 billion they ripped off with the $230 per share dilution. Notice they never have talked about that dilution and all the returns, all the damaged cheap furniture. and The 1 star reviews."
"So are any of the pump fluff analysts brave enough to put out a proper report on W for a change? They all lie and lie about future profits and volume efficiencies. All bull. Wayfair has a horrible business model. The more they sell, the more the losses mount. Wayfair pays $1.30 to sell each $1 worth of goods. Debt is growing rapidly. Top line growth is leveling off, even after the big push into Europe.Wayfair will need to raise cash again very soon, and the lending terms are getting more unfavorable each passing week."
"Shopify down premarket as country opens people will be back in the store’s same way before closures, no one but a college student buys without sitting on it as we have all tried buying without checking it out first and got what we payed for."

"This stock is the greatest mouse trap I have ever seen and it took me for over 50k and it will take all of you long or short! Cover your shorts and sell your longs! There is very little float in this stock meaning shares available for daily trading it is largely held by institutions plus it has a large short % of around 25-30%. Additionally, the institutions are pumping this thing using zacks seeking Alpha and motley fool. Oppenheimer gave a a price target of 200 and that got hit the same day. Someone already mentioned the market cap on this company is close to Best Buy!!! Finally, they are going to have one anomalous profitable quarter in Q2 of this year and then they will never be profitable again. Please keep in mind they have been in business since 2002 they are not a new company. In fact they could go bankrupt in the next few years. Please watch carefully the CNBC video about this company from today it was in fact very good and balanced. This coupled with the fact that it is traded out of NYSE using a specialist that can sop up any liquidity to play games with all week as they see the full order book. They will run this higher on no volume like they are doing and then all it will take is just one or two of the large institutional holders combined with the NYSE Market maker to sell this and it will be at 120-140 in two days! You have been warned I am never touching this thing again it beat me good!"

"Morning Sam, Thanks for posting BYND . Made some money shorting it early and covered at 99.54. Crazy stock for Shot and Long ."

"Anything under 165 is a steal. the bigger the loss the bigger the gains. because this is a growth company, so more loss is a good thing by wall street math, as its due to capex."
the higher the market goes up today the lower w goes down. I love it. Back to 90 friday
I just shorted this
"So let me get this straight, eBay which does double the revenue and profits $2b a year has a market cap of 35b, and wayfair whom has losses of $1b a year is somehow at a market cap of 17b.....this junk is so beyond overvalued! So many suckers out there I guess"

"Volume has been dropping off, look for stop hunting at the open, like a jam higher on no news."
Just amazing. The fall will epic !!!
Pump up and then Another $120 dollar nose dive again -like a toilet - load up then flush
Markets will rally today. GL
"LOL...this stock reminds me of CMG....trades the same way...low float and then totally manipulated higher (or lower). Right now, MM's are having fun with it and driving it higher.

Jp Morgan lowered target to $66. Said 2020 will be worst year yet for losses. Said profitability is elusive. Not sure why not lower.
i can not make sense od this - other than that the Private equity guys are in ans they told all their rich friemds to buy this stock.
When will this monster go to $20
Short covering prevented W from dropping today. There are few buyers at this price. Look for drop to begin next week.
They paid loan shark price of their money with the calls. What a joke
"Look at some stock volume today. The shorts ran to door to close positions.Some Chinese stocks had biggest volume covered by shorts. AMD, JD, Baba, etc had tremendous short covering. This shows the media will spin the negotiations news too positive.If you have shorted W Monday is going to rip off. GL"
"My fellow shorts stay the course they are trying to lift this dead cat , but I tell you it will tank in a week when this over bought market corrects. Sold my DOW and HOG today with great gains !! From now on will be only looking to short shorts that are overvalued. They will go down fast !! It is a shorts market dream. Do not cover in your W short position till $85 to $95."
"Lmao,....MKM PARTNERS target $165 !!! Now it's just MK PARTNERS. M was fired this morning....."

Congrats to those that loaded up back when it was under 50. I personally don’t see long term stability for this company but I am bummed I missed out on the major short term gain that was there. I personally think you’ll see a large drop off in the not so distant future though. I’d take the gains and run

waiting for the drop after a good pump!!!

LMAO.... sold my BYND at $125 this morning.....bought at $98 a couple days ago..... love these companies that don't make money!! JUST LOVE THEM!! profits are soooo overrated!! wonder how much ill make in W today!!??
"It's decided! The only thing better than publicity is free publicity!!!The Supreme Court's recent vote on state taxation has been dubbed ""The Wayfair Decision"". It's like getting tens of millions of dollars in free mentions all over the internet and TV. Quite the little marketing coup and the price is right!"
"Shorted $300 Call. Can't resist so just one. Hopefully it will satisfy me and allow me to wait and not create mess in trade. Given bad reviews but lot of them clearly says we will have record sale and may be good commentary. Real question is, given how bad reputation going in real world, will investor ignore and buy or it's sell the news.I am betting it's sell the news. Even if they do best possible customer service, they can't really gain futher in market share. Overall US Furniture market in 2019 was about $115B. They going to do at $16B+ /year run rate and yet they aren't even no.1 in Online Furniture. Amazon hold that and probably probably 25%+ bigger than Wayfair."
W has just been declared the fad stock of 2020. Better know when to sell!
200 + in a month
Is it really doing great? I don’t think so. My assumption is that this Wednesday company will announce shot of revenues. The share will go down nearly 30%
They are scamming this trade. From $180 to $186 in a couple minutes as the market tanks.
"One thing is certain... If they don't turn a profit in Q2, they NEVER will.Growing sales + widening losses = Bankruptcy.All that free money pumped into the system. PPP. Stimulus checks.It's all gonna dry up and when it does, NO ONE is gonna be couch shopping.Just sayin'Black October."
"wayfair looks to Buy BOEING, sells airline seats-new line with Masks ! HAHA what a JOKE this stock is!!!!!!"
What will Waycoin do today? Any ideas?
Tough afternoon for stocks..People running to massive cash flow generation in our W
"its over for the bulls and disappointing for the bear , opening flat after big premarket move. DUD"
"Lmao.....like minting money!! Same pattern every single day, like I've been telling you!! Bought the dip again!! Sold it for a quick $900.... still holding my core position, of course!!"
"Market makers in W use some of these tricks to manipulate the price! Fake out, Stop hunt, Big candles and Long wicks! 94% of retail traders lose 90% of there money in 90 day’s!"
"andrew left is still holding 350m of buy order, that's my answer to you clintonT"
"as long shorts are going to cry here - stock will keep shooting up. once they all lose their money, we can expect the stock to correct and give up some gains."
insane
Looks like all of the options are at 340... it will end here today
"Folks, this is EXACTLY what a bubble looks like. Have not seen this for a while, but make no mistake, this is beyond irrational. Longs, enjoy it. Shorts, start up the engine."
"it sure makes you wonder how Shah sold 4k shares at the all time high 8/24/2020, along with Conine Steven for $1.4m each"
Sell the news trading today.
"WOW...... LOOK AT THIS ROCKET SHIP GO !!! .. I knew it was going to continue the uptrend... just had to let it settle and jump back in! ....you gotta know when to hold em, know when to fold em, know when to walk away, know when to run !! Love that song.."
"Up $16 since last Friday... I don’t buy it, this is not a technology company. It was to retrace."
can you count how many day it is up in last 20 trading session? 19! i wonder why it was down one day. the crooks must have taken vacation.
Oh no Cramer and 50k per year analyst! The stock is flying again! Shorts shorts bail out now! Or keep trying to analyze the stock!:):):)
I think this stock is a few years from bk. That being said I just bought some calls for a short term flip. I think it has some steam now and this thing goes up quickly and down quickly and does not care what the market is doing. I may sell today if I can get a 40% return which is easy here in a day
"Looks like another short squeeze, I am down a $1000 on this today. I mean who in their right mind would purchase this stock. It broke support and then came right back up through two resistances in 2 days. Could be weeks before this falls. Should have sold my put for a $400 profit instead looking like a loss, I might sell it. The only way this falls is if China announces something drastic over the new US legislation, Ca"
Early winter will disrupt delivery for w ?
Earnings are out. Stock isn't moving much. This may be the start of a renewed downtrend if it doesn't bounce strongly here.
FBI is now investigating the human trafficking issue connected to Wayfair....the allegation will soon become a fact I would bet money....
tick tok to $153....
Painful morning so far.
@sam covered at 148ish . Will short it if bounce back higher today . Are you buying the Dip?
I think W is going to drop back down to $100 even though articles keep comping out trying to pump the stock
this company is gold. thrilled to own a piece of it. (sh) don't tell anyone...this company is worth more than twice their present value. go and buy more...back up the tractor trailer and load it to the roof. it's too 3asy to make money on crypto furniture assets and furniture as a service (faas) is the next platform to rival Apple and Google. to the moon!
...more up in store follow the trend.
W is on target to become the king of online furniture and household appurtenances.
"should see some shorts crawl out of the basement today!! W should drop a bit, at least at the open...... will be nice to see them!! lmao.... they only come out once a month."
Even better! A good market day and W is down! Called 150 by Friday let’s see if we get there.
"$200/share within sights. Not a matter of if, just a matter of when."
"Great earnings, this is going to to 350"
130 next stop. 
Competition on the horizon from a company that excels at logistics. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-art-com-m-a-walmart/walmart-acquires-art-com-to-boost-online-home-decor-business-idUSKBN1O52JX
W should be 50ish by now . Who is holding this p ig at this level ?
"Just got notice of the latest Form4 filed for W's CEO Shah just selling another 17,000 shares on 2/19/19. No need to wait around for ""earnings"". I'm sure he appreciates all the other shareholders keeping the faith."
MARKET MAKERS PLAYING WITH W THEY PUMPING IT UP -- BUT ONE DAY SOON MAYBE TODAY WHEN THE PUMPING STOPS IT WILL DROP TO $120 IN 2 DAYS.........................GUYS IF YOU ARE LONG YOU BETTER KEEP YOUR FINGER ON THE SALE BURRON
"Poor Andy Left looked ridiculous on CNBC just now attempting to defend his amazing losses shorting Wayfair for over two years and counting!The nervous tics, the blathering, the hollow reasoning, oh my! That's what happens when your lemons get caught in a juicy squeeze"
red again hehe
Want to see a huge break out on web traffic? Lovesac web traffic is at all time high on google trends and alexa site rankings. Partnership with bestbuy will catapult it further. Believe it is a true web-based furniture company
Tom did you cover or waiting for lower point?
"Sam, nice you see you back . Making little but not enough to cover some other lost . M not sure about you But m holding through earning . Good Luck to us all !"
This company is losing money & their employees are protesting a sale. Obnoxious.
"29,568 for a children's walking bike? I wouldn't pay a dollar over 28,000 for a bike without pedals.https://www.amazon.com/Small-Foot-10301-Snowflake-Walk/dp/B01LZVFOWC/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=Bike&qid=1594899141&sr=8-2"
Michaels store too...Where are people buying and there's pickup and delivery too during the virus. Kids have been home and schools are starting to reopen. MIK $9.99
Tuesday will be a huge up day.....once long weekend is over.....watch..
Lmao...I believe MKM was the last to upgrade and give target of $165 ! Wall Street is such a joke.... $40 soon as I said for months. Earnings won't be pretty ....guidance will be even worse. Housing market coming apart ...slowing growth in Internet ecommerce....amzn coming in their space ....
I would roughly calc W already blew through about $420m of their $700m buyback pot. Once that runs out look out for big drop
I like etsy much better. They are actually profitable. Buying that and shorting this.
Where is our Benjo :D
The longs kept buying on the way up because they do not understand a bear market. They got caught in the bear trap
they spend $1.10 to make $1.00. Nice business!!
You have all been played - 1 quarter (still lost money )vs 10 + yrs of misery - no wonder this company diluted 12 million shares for $230 only 2 months ago and kept it quiet
36 will be here soon... getting to get mine filled... lots of them
"could close green!!! lmao....was down over $8...... now down $1 and change. awesome trading stock , if you know what youre doing..."
Anyone have any technical analysis on this. How high can this go before it drops like a rock?
Then buy 300 shares - all the overpriced run up happened before earnings - that’s why the board issued 12 million diluted Shares for $230 (why not even $300 then if worth so much ???) right after earnings - they took the $3 billion right after only one profitable quarter after over 10 years and ran- this will show on the earnings trot for this quarter- have you seen the reviews of the Corp? just horrible.
"Update on valuation...As I've shown, W is likely to enter residential market (just my opinion)...They will use Musk-designed solar powered drones to deliver small homes fully furnished with their products. Homes also will include full suite of IoT (internet of tihngs)….Given global residential real estate value at about $180 trillion, a mere 5% market share for W could garner an approximate valuation of around $10 trillion..Likely some hurdles along the way but doable within a couple of years"
"hey Dougie, thought you muted me???....lmao.....guess you didn't? hows your short working out for ya?"
Share offering???
Lol just up 7% on absolutely nothing...
"Yeap... Option day tomorrow, this will end $65. They are gunning for that PT."
M so glad that I did not cover earlier !
"Housing sales is down, unemployment is up, and analysts told me W is good to buy. I will short it until it goes to BK court. W will never make money, and leave the Longs hold the bag. Second Q will be even worse than the first Q, because the retails tell me that the consumers will forever change the consumption for at least 2-3 quarters and maybe forever because the virus already kills the consumer's confidence completely. I predict that W will have to increase bad debt that w never face before. It is the fact."
ride the gain. buy buy buy
Offering coming
There seems to be an artificial floor right above $300
I calculated the odds of wayfair ever going down again....it's less than 1%.
Earning today AT HOME (HOME)...Worth buying!!
"Looks like a load of shorts were squeezed on open today, this would indicate that MMs are ready to let it dive now... I think we have just seen the top of Wayfair ladies and gentlemen!"
by end of the week this wil be back to below 100 !!
Only thing green on a red day..AGAIN...Must be getting old for shortie...Disrupting the following industries 1) residential real estate $170 Trillion (with drone delivered furnished homes; 2) global food sales $15 trillion per year (with edible furniture partnership with Beyond Meat)….My $10 Trillion value within 2 years might be conservative!
Well the big boys shorted at the top now they are telling the folks to take profits /dump .lol
"Gotta keep it pumped so the Roth.. I mean Sprucey House can sell, sell, sell!!!!"
"Sam , this PI G dropped big after hour . Hopefully, drops 5 or 6% tomorrow."
"The one-time help from Coronavirus in Q2 is over, so Wayfair will see MASSIVE deceleration in Q3 and Q4.Wayfair will report LOSSES in Q3 and Q4 due to these reasons:- Due to the recent child trafficking issue, the magnitude of the negative impact on the company remains to be seen.- The brick-and-mortar stores have re-opened since late May with discounts up to 70%.- Amazon (AMZN) has returned to normalcy since June.- Many brick-and-mortar stores have strengthened significantly their online presence due to Coronavirus.- Wayfair's total operating expenses that hit a RECORD at $1 billion (!!!!!) in Q2 will remain at about $1 billion in Q3 and Q4 primarily due to the fierce competition from the brick-and-mortar stores and AMZN that have returned to normalcy since June.- The $600 weekly unemployment benefit is OVER."
New highs again for wayfair!! Guess making money is overrated.
"Make no mistake, when this starts tanking and the converted start dumping, the fall will be epic!"
Day trader short squeeze! They will nab several! Margin calls will take them out.
Below $100 by Friday May 1 Sell now...
"I do not see a reason for a short covering since everyone knows Wayfair needs to go to market to raise money which will probably cause dilution, leading to a lower share price."
"I tend to believe that the whole thing is a hoax but man shooters will enjoy tomorrow, lots of evidence from some of the girls themselves. But man I am ready to short some stocks"
"TOM, how do you like the SAMMY curse?? LMAO..... I told Them all!!"
short this back to 100
This company lost almost $1 billion in one of the best economic environments. It will not fare well in an economic downturn.
"“Wayfair Inc fell by -0.84% in the last day ( Friday, 13th Sep 2019 ) from $133.83 to $132.71 During the day the stock fluctuated 3.14% from a day low at $131.26 to a day high of $135.38. The price has been going up and down for this period, and there has been a 16.49% gain for the last 2 weeks. Volume has increased in the last day by 0.38 million shares but on falling prices. This may be an early warning and the risk will be increased slightly for the next couple of days. In total, 2.03 million shares bought and sold for approximately $269.65 million.”Going down next week to $117 - $119."
We could see this down 10-20% tomorrow.
Put options are going up as price goes up. Set up in hand. Buy buy buy put options
I am raising target to normality-400
Sam bought 300 at 155.27. Are you still holding W?
"Is it the right to sell, huge sell off today?"
"Congratulations to Wayfair for another outstanding quarter! They continue to execute at or ahead of plan on every key metric both domestically and internationally. Guidance very solid as well. Lots of sour grapes on this board today. Just wondering how many of our resident bears and underwater shorts actually listen to the conference calls each quarter? It feels like zero. If you did, you'd know they are executing on or ahead of plan, hence the 300+% stock gains over the past three years.If you're exclusively focused on the bottom line at this stage of their build out, then you're missing the real story, not to mention excellent investment gains. And at the end of the day, that's why we're invested in Wayfair. Onward and upward!"
Don't short unless adequately capitalized. Weak shorts getting squeezed last few days.
"When you see this kind of erratic trading, sometimes it's the mm stop hunting to move shares. Not a bullish sign."
NO jpm. Why did you have to downgrade before it hit 100. I had my heart set on shorting at 100
Wow! They are really pumping it for the convert pricing. I think they price it this week at this rate....
W already coming back!! BUY THE DIP!!!! this is going green!
I don’t know anyone who orders stuff for there homes online. Everyone goes to Ikea and bed bath and beyond. Amazon is a better place for online.
"Submission Statements: Wayfair has a P/E of 0.00Also: https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/W/wayfair/pe-ratioWayfair has lost money every year since IPO and before , yet the stock price goes up after receiving monies from Hedge Funds every quarter.Wayfair the same company that sold furniture to the INS Detention centers where the ICE officials lost 1500 children during the Cage incidents, in 2019!The Truth is out There!"
Just bought two raised bed gardens from this website and our first fake Christmas tree that’s 9 feet tall and looks great 2 years ago. Also bought and sold the stock 4 times in the last 3 weeks. I made good money. I’m very happy.

Let’s not forget about all the suppressed dilution
Positive PE ratio incoming! A big day in W financial history this is.
Any predictions on the close today? Probably 184.99 my guess??
3%+ daily outperformance of QQQ to continue for foreseeable future
Having keen insight to the furniture industry I will BE shorting this stock- reasons below.1- poor quality furniture ( big items / not referring to rugs lamps etc) 2- 15% + return rate and damaged deliveries resulting in discount to keep as-is . Not sustainable in this industry for profit.3- on bigger furniture items they sell cheaper/ low priced items making freight costs a higher % of cost of goods. ( costs to ship a $1000 bedroom is the same for a $3000 one )4- there plan is & as always been to buy market share with crazy advertising expenditures & believe that once lock in - They can go on autopilot with new continual purchases.5- plan is not achieve able because...A- customers are only loyal to good service & price . B- they will continue to chase the top line vs bottom line # creating further stress on cash.C - since February of 2020 the home related purchases have been “unprecedentedly at record highs” Any furniture operation with half a brain is going great with the exception of slow delivery of orders from factories.Once the orders start to soften & it’s just starting. That’s when opportunity on W short will be timely.
No brainer short. Wayyyyy overbought. and unjustified.
Ostk on the roll. Digital dividend plus online sales year over year up 130% per Benzinga news feed.
Who's manipulting this stock? red across the board and this one is green? puleez.
bring back benjo ans his crystall ball. now! his charts only go up in a straight line.
when will they ever make a profit
MUST WATCH!!!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK_k3LAzFVw
consolidating before race off to 275! go W undervalued insanely. if i had 21bln id just buy all of your shares. soo so cheap!
Rounded Bottom just occurred. Could go sharply up?
W is up 6.89% to 101.78
"OSTK is the next W, don’t be left out OSTK is still only 45.18 per shr & moving GLTA"
Time to SHORT now? Any thoughts
"Furniture importer, $30B market cap.? And MGMT is selling."
"This is almost a 10x from the bottom....I might sell here...it's just like the January 2000 market bubble..then by March 2000, pop goes the weasel"
"honestly, not sure how shorts can fight free money from fed and mm manipulation. there is no short drives lately, just short squeezes."
This will move up to 4xRev or about $200. It will be the TESLA of furniture.Keep the faith. Insiders are working hard to increase Rev and Profit will follow.
Will cover my 3 thousand shares at $115 before the posible China  Trade deal. Come to Papá Wayfair.
now its getting a bit out of control. a bit.
"Hmmm? Insiders seem to be accelerating their sales of W stock.CEO, 10% Owner Niraj Shah sold 31,000 shares of W stock on 03/04/2019 at the average price of $165.74. Co-Founder, 10% Owner Steven Conine sold 31,000 shares of W stock on 03/04/2019 at the average price of $165.76."
bought a few weekly calls. Trust me I think this pig is losing steam but will rebound today. I hope lol
Holiday seasons are here. Everyone wants something. Buy buy buy.W will fly fly. More Moe Mo sales. Money Money Money.
"How the company that never makes profit at all, shot up over 30% yesterday. I suspect the number of sales in the first quarter shoot up double. Do the consumers bought more furniture to stay away from the virus? I have so many questions about this company. The furniture is not the important thing for surviving in this situation. Do you agree with me? I think some one cover the short position yesterday, because of panic of some traders. This company should go straight to BK court soon."
"It really hurts to see, The more you short, The higher it goes & The longer you hold onto thoes shares, The more you'll lose. Well, cover and end the pain. Go long to make up the loss. The down trend caused by the COVID-19 has ended and we are back into the bull mkt."
I can't imagine this garbage can trade at this level. Who is buying??????
"Ahhh, nice. Pile on shorts. Institutional buyers coming in shortly. Who do you think is talking to the C-level suite?hedge funds, pension plans endownents control the market, esp with a $200 stock. Weak holders are just about out - I would think. Good luck to all!"
In all seriousness though is any human stupid enough to buy at these prices or is it all algo driven?
Raj on the burner phone “hurry hurry get that bag of money over to Zacks”
Reversal to catch shorts coming quickly.Cases will start rocketing up again as over half are not wearing masks and socially distancing.
"Hello R,How are you and have any position in R yet ? Just shorted this over value stock . Good luck to all"
Going lower than 149 today ? Thumb up Y and down N. Thx.
Lol
$158 is the first resistance and it was sold at end of day. Next resistance is $138 and it is not much. Then it heads back down to 100-120 where it may find some support for now. My guess is we see $138 this week. Very easily could happen overnight if/when Trump announces China retaliation/tariff plans. He said today that we would hear something this week. Positive catalysts for W at this point are about 0! Negative are many.
"Today's WSJ article talks about SQ and analysts covering it. You could easily replace it with W - same story applies where analysts and management is comparing itself to AMZN. Here's the snippet:Square is a solid success story, but should it be valued on par with, or even at a premium to, some of the most successful companies of our time? The market and at least one analyst appear to think so.Shares of the payments company founded and run by Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey are up 173% this year. Earlier this week Nomura Instinet analyst Dan Dolev poured gasoline on the fire with a note saying Square should join the ranks of the famous FANG stocks— Facebook , FB 1.24% Amazon, Netflix and Google—which have dominated market gains in recent years.The note’s flashy headline was picked up widely by media outlets including CNBC, sending Square shares up 11% in one day.The entire episode is reminiscent of the late 1990s, when analysts would slap arbitrarily high price targets on rising stocks, hatching up novel valuation arguments and relying on relative comparisons to other overvalued companies."
"W resells cheap Chinese garbage to people who want ""the look"" but can't afford to pay for quality. New Trump tariffs will pay even more havoc with W losses."
"Is Wayfair the market's brand spankin' new bubble stock? Uh, quite possibly."
They delight me!!!! Delightful!!!!
12M shares offered at $238. Niraj Shah and other guys are limited partners in Greenhill llp who gave loan and got covertibles at $78 in april - sweet deal with insider information
"The link below is for Scotch tape on Amazon, priced over $18,000. Does this mean anything other than a pricing mistake? Of course not.

Check out customer reviews. Can't make this up. This is scary. You won't see such negative reviews on Amazon. https://www.trustpilot.com/review/wayfair.com
Last of my money out of savings and in here at size...True hedge funders know..Banks give 2% / year as opposed to W at 4% per day!!!
Doe anyone know the pe for w? I can’t find it. LOL bwaaaaaa
Poor shorts have now been officially destroyed. Refused to take advise to change direction and have spent all their gains on covering or seeing their Puts expiring worthless.
Take those profits. Huge rotation out today? Unorderly exit.
"Amazon down big today, TGT up huge and W up again. Ya that makes sense. Internet retail down, brick and mortar flying."
My 245 stop loss triggered today. Made a good 1600. Will be back in under 230 if possible.

"Would be nice for it to close below yesterday's low, 207.50"
keep it up then let it free fall
"Tomorrow Wayfair will hit the $115 and I will cover my 3,000 shares at $131. A $48,000 profit in two weeks. And all the smart ones here said I didn’t know how to read a chart and that W was undervalued and the trend was up. Bla Bla Bla... give stock trader some credit. Hope to do well with my FDX and a little nervous about my 4,750 shares of Roku. But I have a hunch that Roku will jump tomorrow, its holding well today at $108. Let’s see what happens. W going lower than $100."
Sold 160 straddles. I can buy a rolls Royce today.
"Love this company but it's going to retrace back to the $280 level. Just a great buying opportunity, but I just don't think u should buy now when u can get it 10% cheaper in the very near term. Great company and will thrive for many years! GL all"
True Wall Street hitters moving to safety of W stock...Up day in a sea of red...Massive cash flows supporting very undervalued share price..
"In two years, this stock will be trading at $20 per share, swimming in debt. This is only the start of the fall. You have two strategies for playing W-go short for the long haul-day/swing trading after high vol rises and dipsHolding W long at pre-recession times is a fools playInsider selling was probably a big clue to this. Watch for it again next quarter."

Well happy I didnt short at 210 lol
Notice how light the volume today..No one willing to sell below $1 Trillion market cap...Only volume is algos who don't know what they are doing
reported quarterly earnings of $3.13 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $0.95 by 229.47 percent. This is a 331.85 percent increase over losses of $(1.35) per share from the same period last year. The company reported quarterly sales of $4.30 billion which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $4.04 billion by 6.44 percent. This is a 83.53 percent increase over sales of $2.34 billion the same period last year.
whats the close today???......I say $168......regardless what the overall market does..
"Walmart and Microsoft are sucking all the air out of the online sites. How? Walmart and Microsoft both want the social media presence to help them. When the new Walmart online Walmart Plus goes live, they will now have a distribution center within 10 min. of every American give or take. It’s called a Walmart store. :-)You can pick it up or have it delivered. They can solve the problem of the “last mile” delivered to your home. Amazon can’t do that yet. They are trying to move into vacant shopping malls and turn them into distribution hubs for delivery."
"no stimulus, it's official. Meanwhile stores are open for business. Big hit to wayfair"
"“Due to W’s recent rally, the average analyst price target now indicates 9% downside potential from current levels.”"
"Buy, but, and buy some more..."
LOL. Corona government money instead of saving people jobs and lives ends up in this W casino.
"no volume, price slowing drifting to 200 MAVG @ 204"
260$ at the close
"Waiter holdings next door dash going bonkers, the smashed the quArter by a mile. 6 to 8 by end of day, teens next week. Spce inmd surging."
It’s tracking Nasdaq again today. The combination of low volume and short covering today is making this shoot higher temporarily. This is the 5 straight low volume day. It won’t hold under normal 4 million+ volume. We need to be patient.
"So earlier today, on no news, this was $12 higher? You're comfortable with that?"
And GREEN IT IS!!! Watch and learn.....same pattern every day....yawn....
Sammy what are you going to do when you find out your favorite stock is a rube
This thing going back to 80
If a vaccine works would Wayfair fall back to 60 or lower?
What is holding up this high valuations ?
Perhaps the hope that a company with cash will acquire Wayfair is what is driving the price. Doesn't make sense to me unless the buying company thinks they can make is profitable in short order
"morning sheeples!! ready for more pain today!?... mitesh sure is a gluten for punishment isn't he??...I laugh at hi every day...... the owners literally have $billions in stock and one sells $5 million and he thinks thats a big deal!! just tells you what league he's in....the PeeWee league!....yes, they will continue to sell....they have for years.....they own 36% of the company........ $153 my come, but only with a stock split! lmao...... kids really shouldn't shut when they dot understand the stock, the market, or the business."
"Clearly nothing can take this stock down!! Not losses, Not a recession, not trade wars, not market crashes.....NOTHING!!! It's probably the best stock in the history of the stock market."
I like SHOP better
"Should have covered yesterday at $126 and made 3,000 X $5 = $15,000. Will see what it does today. W has been stronger than what I thought. Maybe cover and let the Bozos take higher and short at a much higher price. I have no doubt that in the end W will be under $100 before the of the year or lower. This coming quarter will show a deceleration in growth and not impress. W is a sell candidate !!"

"It's kind of funny, been watching this close since earnings and it's been running wild, yet there are like three people posting here about it lol. Starting to feel like another Tilray"
"The really amazing story about Wayfair is the negative $-12.51 tangible book value. But hey, someday sometime maybe with a little luck, this will make a profit, then and only then will this plummet.Its how we roll now!"
Well this business model just imploded. Vac means no lock downs.
Well it's back to it #$%$ moving up for no reason I see. Can't wait until next earnings. This stock will absolutely disappoint and be back down to under $100.INSANELY OVERVALUED.
Today 52 week high 101
"kind of funny, actually.....low float allows this to happen....wild swings and irrational movements in the stock price....its a stacked deck with the float so low."
Shady Old Lady Clinton and her crew are loading up the truck.
What years will W have EPS
losses billion dollars and it's a great company????
MGM up 33% today as well as cruise lines. Crazy lol. They are completely shut down and going up like w is. Will not last. bear market trap.
Odds of Wayfair price going higher than 124: 2.54% Odds lower: 97.44%if i was a gamblin man..........https://www.macroaxis.com/invest/market/W--Wayfair
I watched all the festivities from the Mall yesterday on one of my 15 Wayfair couches...It was AWESOME!!!!!
"Dougie, hows your short working out for ya?? just curious...."
buy the dip!!! same pattern every day!
"I am holding 20,000 shares today bought more at $164. Wayfair is beating Amazon $AMZN"
Cyber Monday news out tomorrow. Expect Walmart and Mastercard and VISA to announce great numbers. Thinking 30% jump on last years figures
Still over 230$ overvalue
"$90/share for a company that was losing $10/share in a year when the stock market was flying and US employment was FULL. W is now higher than it was in February before things fell apart.The large short position aside, fundamentally W has only one way to go and that is down."
Anyone know when the bought deal is going down?
W will end today in the red. Always some short covering in early trading.
"closed green, as usual ......need more volatility for me to make money!!"
"MOTHER OF ALL BUBBLE IN WAYFAIR WILL BURST BIG TIME , BYOND MEAT AT 200 REMEMBER? SAMETHING. DOWN TO 100 SOON BOYS"
It will go higher one time and then start its journey back.Does it have power to hold itself long at such a high price with low volume
I don't know. From the trading pattern it simply looks like an MM driving the price up.
"Shorts you better cover soon, looks like the strength is returning to this stock."
the fund managers must know there is a working vaccine
"word must have got out that they'll miss this Q. Same thing you could see in Netflix the heavy selling pressure, not the typical build up to earnings"
Market red.....wayfair green..... same thing every day...
"SELL Wayfair stock now if you own it, SHORT it anyway you can if you don't.SELL."
I had to offload my remaining shares when they were dropping like a rock to the low $20's last month... How could their price rebound to 3 digits (above where they were just before virus blew up)? I've never seen such a rebound in so short of time...
"Wayfair is no tesla, but is overvalued like tesla."
"Wow, they said their sales growth rate will decline and their debt is increasing, how on earth can they justify a $30b valuation!"
What? Still have shorts at this board? How do you feel
How is no one downgrading this?
"Like I've been talking noobs , trades the same way everI day!!! Dips in the morning run g and hits new highs later in the day...watch and learn rookies"
Wayfair Google search trend is way back down to March level before work from home for most people. July was triple. it's over
Where is the profits? Over bought again
W is down 8.83% to 73.06
"Lol. You can't make double by short, but you can lose double."
"just shorted at 177.10 ,, manipulators still pushing, but can't continue, THIEVES"
"Hedge Funds Decreased Holdings last quarter, and three closed out completely:Tiger Global ManagementClough Capital Partners L PEllington Management"
Anybody buy W in the 20s?
This stock is still way overvalued.I say short every upswing.
"lmao.......hey Joel, you still think it will close red?? you guarantee it ??? too funny.......this is going back to $170"
"My prediction for today- MMs Squeeze it upwards in the first hour to stop out some shorts and move price higher for the whales. Then whales start offloading again to the market and we see continued selling throughout the day until close, slowly pushing the price lower, to end the day negative."
Epstein bought all his furniture from Wayfair!!
I find it funny that that all the longs are making fun of analysts who suggest this will go down (and it will) and are now posting that analysts are raising their target prices... The main take away is analysts are useless noise in the marketplace...
when the squeeze ends and the weak shorts are pushed out their wont be a soul willing for buy this and it will drop 15-20 in a few days.
Heavy HEAVY VOLUME!! Massive!! Up $5.75 on massive volume! My account is exploding again today!! How you shorts doing?
Wayfair SELL report $50 target - https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/50093457-best-on-the-street/5334626-wayfair-inc-lying-omission

"Opportunities, opportunities."
this stock is still danging... what is the future?
"Deutsche Bank Analyst - Kunal MadhukarHe has opined EIGHT times on Wayfair.He has a PERFECT track record - ZERO for Eight!His return? NEGATIVE 39.2%To be fair, he has rendered 3WHY does he have a license to render an opinion?To be fair, he has rendered 31 ratings, 10 of which have been successful enough to yield a NEGATIVE 1% return.Kunal - wanna try putting some math into even one analysis?Nah - that takes effort and thought.How do I feel about Wayfair??? CONFUSED"
"Insiders have sold , bad news"
SAMMY downgrades Wayfair from sell to run for cover! that's why its down today.
Back to 100 by Friday
"Wow great earnings! We may see 350 this week.... I’m hoping they don’t do a secondary offering soon, that won’t be good"
"Man, look at it run!! Just an amazing company... someone call in another BRINKS truck !! This one is full again!"
hmmm. trading moving at a glacial pace.
WS is pushing for $130 option expiration
The gravy trained has been milked for $3billion of dilution thanks kids
"Yeah, 26 million customers buying couch everyday! Honey, let’s buy another couch today or may be a table too? Crooked management and greedy Wall Street crooks playing big game with low float! Some of the aspects of this manipulation fall under some SEC violations, an investigation and some Wall Street fraudsters could lose their license"
After hours still going up!!!! We can't get enough!!! I'm hoping BYND / W edible furniture JV announcement soon..Can't wait!
Hope there will b more downgrade is coming soon . $120 ?
Missed revenues (dropping) speaks of the future going forward = more stores opening cause of he vaccines kicking in will be more competition. That’s why revenues dropped
Buy before the pop on earnings!
Sales are soaring.
congrat's to andy left!!
Morgan Stanley target is $75. Just in time for this week option expiration. Manipulation. Yo-yo. This is how they make their money...
"people hated it at $25, but love it at $205. sustainable...."
They will price convert by Wednesday
"So much money to be made at these levels. Black Friday coming, W will jump later this week, just hold your nerve longs."
OK I SOLD..... IN AT $250... THIS WAS A GIFT..

why Its going up in dip market from last 2 days.
Don’t know exactly when it will happen but soon some smart institutional investors-will lock up the profit they have knowingly they can buy back cheaper!
Fund managers want to get out badly .They are pumping it up so they can get out at higher price.
W is bankrupt in 2 yearsif you shorted at 300+ do not cover at these bubble pricesgla
Look at the one year then the 5 year chart.Think there might be a pullback soon???This thing is a lot more dangerous than I think people realize.This could be back sub $100 in 2 days.Good luck.
I'm starting to not like this stock!
"a SHORT SELLERS dream ,, Free Money Every Day ,, buying LAMBORGHINI as ......"
still wondering why this is so high?
Does W have the cash and infrastructure to compete with AMZN?
"Best of luck. There are very few items to be delivered, no supplies ACROSS CENTRAL TEXAS! April is a dead month too!!Don’t be fooled by pumps and dumps- I sell furniture for 4 years now, similar to RH"
MACD line is green showing institutions are buying here.Stock will rebound quickly squeezing the shorts
This will fill that gap within a week
"UP UP AND AWAY in my beautiful balloon!.........hey DOUGIE, those gifs help you trade better? hehehehe.....hows your short working out?"
"Great Hills really manipulating higher- good to be long,but it is unfair trading,SEC INVESTIGATION NEEDED."
"Looking great today! Just broke below 250 :)My target is still around 220 level, i'll start covering there, but will definitely leave a bit to run into earnings, as this thing has been so over cooked that it could easily head down to 100s."
Just weak shorts covering
"On January 6, 2020 ValuEngine upgraded WAYFAIR INC ( W ) from BUY to STRONG BUY."
"I have purchased lots from Wayfair. The customer service is fantastic, they stand behind their stuff. There are different tiers of quality but so far I am happy with all of my purchases from them."
Wayfair stock TO XIC :
"Sam... I understand, Tilray had a very small float to and it went to $300 to $26 bucks in a few months !!! Wayfair will not survive in this space, especially with the 800lbs Gorilla like Amazon. The company is super overpriced. Bought FDX today so what do you thing about that ??"
Lining up like Stamps.com.............looking for a 60 point drop in the next two weeks
I feel the W prices the same furniture much higher than other suppliers. It frequently changes the brand names of the furniture to prevent the price comparison.
crooks... even ER timing is fraudulent. reported before the time indicated
Waycoin lol
"This will easily hit 500$ because everyone is buying everything online and most importantly with all of the stimulus money everyone wants to ""get fresh"" on their zoom calls and home office things and also with social influencers. People see things on their ""feeds"" and want to also have them and Wayfair is the main supply line here. They are going to be making a lot of more money than even before and the share price is showing that. This is a super strong buy in the ""covid economy."""
shorts seemed to betting killed on this one!
Adam: Its a pure 'stay at home momentum' play. I just added some more but will get out right after earnings report.
"Houston, we've got a problem...."
Yup Revenues missed and dropped .....and will be dropping more in the future. I knew this was a pandemic one hit wonder
Is this really just blowing up because of the SHOP and WMT deal?
"Elon Musk has twice as many twitter followers as Wayfair has ""users"". Not buyers, but users, whatever that is.I suppose it is like Tesla's ""deliveries"" instead of actual sales.Company CEOs just make stuff up these days. What is wrong with giving us ""normal"" metrics?"
"So what was the share price on the stock dilution? They'll stair stepper it down. Market cap. is deceiving because it's based on last transaction x shares. As you see when people want out and few buyers, company valuation takes a hit. It's a website."
"Your stated on your web site: ""It has never been more important that we come together, respect and listen to one another and find ways to understand our differences in a constructive and civil manner.""Please explain how cancelling ""My Pillow"" products because of his political views a ""coming together, respecting and listening to one another and finding ways to understand your difference with ""My Pillow"" a constructive and civil method???????"" I will spread the news to all- you are using financial methods to destroy someone who has a different opinion- that is unAmerican. We consumers can surely follow your example and do the same. NO MORE WAFAIR!"
The confidence of this stock is gone. Only dead cat bounces on temporary stimulus - people need the money for actual bills now and stores are aggressively open with masks/ hand wash. EOY easily cut in half
This stock is amazingly resilient. Someone is doing their darnedest to make sure of that.
Smart money has spotted the accounting tricks for “profitable” Wayfair. An unsustainable company. Short.
premarket down is a shake out to give shorties a false hope. no way anyone can hold this stock down from tearing a new high of 150. earnings revenues are beating all records.
Wow this was $30? No brainer and one of my favorite companies. I never saw this drop so congrats to those that understood covid as an opportunity for ppl staying home and furnishing their places. The amazon of home furnishing as I always say! It’s my favorite place to buy goods but I didn’t see this drop! That hurts
W's market cap is $3 billion more than F's. That's messed up.
"CHECK OUT ""HOME"" (AT HOME). earnings tomorrow after the close and so much cheaper! $7.50"
Next stop $294.44
Outperforming all competitors today...Likely a long-term low reached today IMHO..
"Yesterday some people rotated out, daily volume up 50%."

COMPLETE FRAUD!!!! This price action is absolute insanity!! Market is getting crushed and of course W is up again. Makes zero sense. up $30 the last 2 days on no news!
This is a pretty interesting short squeeze happening. The time to short it is probably now...not when it was 40/50. This will.sell off on positive news...not a 12B business...let's be real. Pretty remarkable run though congrats to those who were in it.This will drop swiftly though. It's a stock and nothing goes up forever don't forget folks.good luck
Why is Zacks pumping this thing everyday? Literally everyday they are putting out a pump article lol... hmm because they are driving this pump and dump up. They have W as a #1 buy. Basis is they only lost $4/share past quarter. Comical
Sold another 5% of my pre-IPO BYND shares (500x bagger)...Allocated more here..People fleeing 30 year UST and stocks and gold and money market funds...For the safety here....
Guess how much the CEO sell? A billion?
The insanity continues...
I had no idea cheap gas equates to online furniture sales?? How?? We all know that it wont help earnings since Wayfair is 100% against earnings. Wayfair prefers to be a non profit company.
Wayfair is a bit overvalued and doubt the upside is not going to be as good as Overstock. Good company but OSTK offers much much more upside.
Where's this massive sell-off that everyone was predicting to come after 12:00 p.m. Are the bears still hibernating?
Start my short position with 700 shares @ 159 .
"Texas, is going to close down again. Major boost for companies that profited a lot from the online buy surge due to Corona like Wayfair."
I wonder how much margin/ debt financing is holding this poster child of overvalued hype companies up?
"After we buy AMZN, Tilray, and BYND in simultaneous all cash, non-dilutive transaction, would Gates, Buffett, and U.S. Treasury buy us for between $20 - $25 Trillion? Could happen...Might take a while..Like a year or so..."
"with the assumption of a stimulus to come, ""The Wayfair Analyst: Tom Forte upgraded Wayfair from Neutral to Buy and reiterated the price target at $280."". what happens if it doesn't in a divided government Tom?!"
"worst retailer on line. very poor customer service, cancel button is there for bate. tried to cancel an order talked to them 3 times and their still forcing it down my throat."
"ty short @ 216 ,211, 210 , 209 and out @ 199...Great ride good luck!!!"
made good money again today....... wonder how much ill make tomorrow.....same thing every day! I feel for shorts... I really do!
"nyrangersfan301Bearish07:54 PM$W Stock could barely stay up on a couple of good days to end the week last week. Tomorrow its not looking good with the way futures look going to be a lot of profit taking from scared ""longs"" or should I say the people who have held the stock for two weeks when it was $25. It is the shorts time to control this stock for the week."
"Yes old news here, but this month the CTO and COO are gone. not good.https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2019/07/17/coo-cto-at-wayfair-announce-retirements.html"
market red.....wayfair green...... same thing every day.... the climb to $200 continues.
bed bath and beyond valuation is $3B and has greater sales and profit. Here it is $24B. BBBY under valued maybe a little? Wayfair overvalued a ton?
"Honestly, this company can turn a profit at ANY time. They are just spending a lot of cash to expand their business and increase market share. Looking at the Jet.com deal, Walmart paid a nearly a 100% premium on the value of that company. E-commerce is where the world is headed, just look around at all the furniture stores going out of business. Wayfair is at the forefront of this new business, only the stubborn shorts still have their heads in the sand stuck in the past. I bought 800 shares at 38.80 and added another 1000 shares at 36.30."
This rocket ship is amazing but it'll come back down to earth at some point and I'll be there to catch it. Amazing run.
Agree it is a disaster waiting to happen just give it time!!!!
"70,000 in volume on a high volume selling day. This stock is so manipulated it’s unreal."
"I really don’t care either way on this stock but I am bothered by one thing. The bulls keep comparing this company to Amazon and I find this completely idiotic. Ask yourselves these questions: 1. Why did Bezos start with books instead of furniture? 2. What if Amazon didn’t have the support of AWS, it’s incredibly profitable cloud business? 3. How much furniture is sold my Amazon today? 4. Who is more efficient at selling furniture today? AMZN? Or W? And why?W has not profit since its founding in 2002. Amazon is a major competitor, not a comp. W’s issues are structural, not scale. The more it sells the more it loses. Any idiot can sell furniture at a loss. Think about that when you base your investment decisions on sales volume increases and some fantasy comparison to AMZN."
"I don't trust this the same as the dozens of other tech where sales are up, stocks up 10x, yet still can't make a profit."
Opportunity of a lifetime to buy puts
Time to short this for me (Everyone else should double their buy) My bad luck will go with you long way.
The upwards momentum can continue unless they screw it with more shares offering. Let’s hope they don’t do it. Even though there is a good chance of it happening at this price.
W is down -5.66% to 113.87
who's over leveraged here?
What will happen at next earnings? Will instutionals bail before that? Maybe a good time for a straddle.
"Everyone says that the share price is too high but Wayfair is a good company like Tesla and a lot of others that makes a lot of debt which people can buy for ""yield."" On top of that the ""federal reserve bank"" buys a lot of that which makes it pretty valuable. Everyone ""fighting the fed"" doesn't make sense."
Great!... We had another analyst in our corner. Send him a few bottles of wine.Let celebrate. $200 here we come.
Holy #$%$ how did Wayfair get this high??? That EPS is enough to send me away screaming
"WOW! We have another company playing the OSTK game, before OSTK got in the digital currency game - they did this as they realized they will never make money as an online retailer as they are overpriced for the cheap #$%$ #$%$ they sell. Neither company and many others will never be able to become profitable as their business models will never let them grow to any relevant economy of scale. This turd really should and will trade at 6 bucks in a year..then bankruptcy will come..."
"lmao...Andrew Left should have called me before he shorted this......I could have saved him $100 million or so....now he wants to open a hedge fund!!! WHY, you say?? so he can play with other peoples money, THATS WHY!! HE LOST ALL HIS!! anyone giving him a dime deserves what they get."
W reached a new All Time High at 94.60
"It really is a losing battle trying to short this stock. I don't understand it at all, but it is."
Try posting about the corrupt obvious “on the take” analysts and see what happens to your post
you can sell this stock anywhere and make money- short obsessed- but spring buying for goods is close.
Nothing to do today but to buy more puts...
Trump just slammed Wayfair by raising the cost of importing cheap Chinese furniture and other household trinkets. Wayfair input costs just went up 10% today and maybe 25% by year end.
"Tom, did you short again? at what price? Should have waited for $200"
up she goes!! kind of figured it would.....three firms raised targets after earnings.. back on the run.....hope you all covered
Where is my furniture you @&$ Confirmed delivery on October 29th. They can’t find it
"So absurd it's justified? Who will take the losses? Interim financials can be just about anything you want, so look for unusual performance."
Buying more puts on Monday.
265k volume on that last candle
my friend shorted this. RIP.
Will shorts cover??
And there is the magical 5 minute increase end of day for all markets.
"One has to wonder if W stock was not ""financially engineered down so hard to $21, just so two private equity firms (friends of the CEO?) could take up an entire private placement between them at extremely favorable terms. The speed with which it has risen since the pp is astounding."
Vaccines showing positive Results in phase 2 are now being fast tracked for use ! Congrats e-comm by trying to hi-jack business you have now instead awaken the sleeping giants
how the market up 2000 is unbelievable
"Outperforming everything (again)...True Walls Street Hedge Funders positioning for investment conference on the ""Tucket next week..."
"it’s goin down, i’m yellin timberrrrr"
Too many 340 calls. Their trying to drive this up to snag the calls.
"Dean, 2008/2009 were my margin call education years, painful!! As far as manipulated markets? At least we know!!"
LookS like I might take a position today looking for low 50’s high 40’s
"Wayfair's cash burn rate still concerns me. If they are simply consistent, Wayfair will need to raise more money by year end. Does anyone see it differently ?"
$300 on the way
"Online retailers up 8% in last 4 weeks. that means Wayfair had a great first month in this quarter, will finish green"
somebody covering a big short position is my bet
Why SHOP dropped and W went up? The article said SHOP is risky. How about W?
"Wayfair will be back at $300 around Black Friday- Christmas. I do business with them and trust me, we do 20x the normal volume around this time."
"BUBBLE ALREADY BURSTS, ESPECIALLY AT THIS PRICE RIGHT NOW WHERE WAIFAIR STANDS , IT'S BEYOND ANY STOCK PE RATIO"
I am thankful for not losing money each day at the world casino. my heart goes out to those who lose

Wayfair about to go back to 165
W selling gold plated furniture & diamond work on rugs that’s why share price everyday going up slowely slowely this one going to $ 1000 plus in 2 month may be next year if this speed continues may be this one cross Amzon may be price $ 3000 because this company not selling furniture only selling drugs or gold & diamonds
turned out my gift appears to be a lump of coal.........but I think this will bounce some yet....
How's this company been in business for nearly 20 years and still taking massive losses each year? LOL Please...someone explain this.
"Very consistent, more sales = more losses, raise more debt, rinse and repeat."
Maybe today I can get out of this at a smaller loss. Pump it up Zacks.
Wayfair benefitted from the outbreak by selling home office furniture. Doesnt everyonenow see thats over? Wayfair goes forward losing money as usual.
Gonna drop 20%
With over 8000 option contract for the $190 call expiring this Friday. It will hit the $190 mark
overstock crushed it. Does that mean money spent at overstock instead of Wayfair? Or does this mean the whole industry boosted by the last stimulus
Wayfair is up 10.54% to 326.82
Explain why this stock is so hot lately?
"Time to short this to 0. We do not support companies selling HUMAN WOMEN!!! Sick individuals, as if furniture wasn’t enough greedy devils"
market cap is almost as big as LYFT...
A re-post from earlier that is really worth reading and its all based on fact. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4346747-wayfair-negative-equity-losses-cash-burn-high-leverage-headwinds-and-bankruptcy-possible-in
Deep State in control of this one...It's uninvestible
"Around this time last year the stock was trading near $170,just saying that it’s not that far off it’s high. With added online sales and more to come the price action isn’t really that out of line. Will it hold here? No telling but I wouldn’t expect it to fall back below $160-$170 for quite some time"
"long term I do not see any upside in this one, short term bounce maybe in between long term downtrend."
"Stifel Downgrades Wayfair After Q1 Print, Says Coronavirus Sales Surge Will Dissipate"
we were still a few months out from the end of Corona crisis... everything is going good hard
if this South Dakota sales tax court case goes against them in late June they'll be back at 70 before you can blink. The ability to avoid sales tax is what props this company up.
Longs got too greedy lol
New article today’s says Walmart will expand e commerce business by buying specialized competitors like Wayfair. Going to fly tomorrow.
the move to safety stocks is under way!! money coming to W in massive amounts!! no stopping it now.....its impossible to lose money owning this stock.......
no prediction but like to it down mid 50 today... they have been manipulating to keep it up all morning. this stock should have been bottomed with all the trouble with the virus and supplies
"W- keep pumping and dreaming, they are short on supplies from buyers"
50% to next resistant $136. 50% to support $80. Good luck guys
Will it get to minus 4% today.
Covered all at 45 . Will short back on any pop .Congrats to all Shorts today!
@R: you were asking for 12 points. Most probably today. Gets back to 150 level sooner than later
Barclay's cuts Wayfair TP to $47 from $76.
"So our neighbor ordered an $800 gas patio fireplace from W two months ago. The first one had cracked tiles upon delivery. Wayfair sent them a new one but didn't want the first one back. The replacement also had cracked tiles. Wayfair shipped them a third fireplace and didn't want the second one back. The neighbor gave both cracked tile units to other friends of ours, who a re very happy with their free fireplaces.How does W make any money at all with idiotic policies like this?This is a true story. I'm not making this up."
One of the best shorting opportunities right now. Start small and leave it alone. The overbought indicators are through the roof.
I told you all to cover. Wayfair is taking over home products! All my girlfriends and including myself look there first to buy all thing for the home- especially good deal on rugs and furniture!!
consolidation before the next gap up
1999-2000 remember
Who does not think this stock is manipulated?? Please contact me. I have great beach land in Siberia to sell you!
Shorts are in big trouble. The management keep buying cheap shares and this squeezes to 100 fast
"Volume is so low, hence very easy to be manipulated"
BULLS ON SUICIDE WATCH
"Institutional funds are defending that $145 support. Why W rose yesterday, when it should have fallen considerably. If that $145 is borkoen, it's a big gap down"
"http://djcs.factsetdigitalsolutions.com/cxb/analystpdf/MarketGrader/w.pdfFull document explaining why this is a sell. You can bag hold if you want, but when the rug gets pulled you only have yourself to blame."
900% return in 1 month. This is one of my biggest regrets.
Strange! Usually 10K to 28K pre market trades! 991 25 minutes to opening! Weird!
Markets are going to tank when they realise that MRNA is bs.This will not hold up well on a bad day. Today was a last ditch efforts by longs to keep this weight class. Friday 150 or lower.
"Bricks and mortar are substantially cheaper than bytes and computer hardware. The internet is super expensive to operate, but all you have to do is hire a crew, buy bricks and mortar, a roof, put in a door and some windows, and a loading dock out back, and some electricity for the lights...and now you have a place that is really economical to run on a day to day basis. This is a genius move by W, and their stores will fill the footprint of fallen retail giants, or they will hire a crew and build new. W makes money the old fashioned way, they spend it (on bricks and mortar)"
Is there a magnate holding the price?
$15 billion market cap and never made a dime....lmao.....no stopping it now! look for $200 in march...
Citigroup Investment Research upgrades WAYFAIR INC from NEUTRAL to BUY.
"A large percentage of Wayfair's sales and profits are of course from furniture and appliances, which are tightly tied to household moves. House sales have plummeted during the pandemic, and will only worsen during the next six months, as there is a long lag between getting one's house ready to sell and actual closing on a sale."
"$w is no doubt good company but not at this price. sold yesterday will reenter around $130. forget the bears, 90% of all bulls max price is $160. buying 20% below that has always worked"
"I must be missing something.. along with all the analysts: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/wayfair-downgrade-stock-surges?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO&yptr=yahooMorningstar: 70$ price target“We think competitors will continue to attempt faster delivery, spurring increasing competition,” Katz wrote. “Wayfair is competing with mass-market retailers, specialty retail, and low-cost providers, making it harder to stay front of mind perpetually.”She puts Wayfair’s fair value at $70."
"Not going to be a good week for W... many will sell. To much risk to the downside.

weird pattern day before earning. It was ramping up since last 5 days...Hopefully I will recover my money by tomorrow.

"Making money, Tom? Picked the perfect time to short.....again! Lmao..... wonder how much I'll make today?.....yawn...."
"Green again! Same pattern every day.......very little volume, opens red, then gains in the afternoon and trading is most from 3:00 to 4:00 as it closes at its high. Manipulation is so easy because of the low float...17.8 million shares to play with....most are not in the market ....insane setup......"
"yawn..... wonder how much ill make today??!! w green again! every day, same thing.... boring really."
I feel terrible for people who are buying at these levels
"until the retail stop shorting this stock, W is not going down. get this straight. ok? thank you now."
"Morning gentleman,Should I cover or wait til $150 ?"
Management is so confident. Selling on the way DOWN :https://tinyurl.com/ya39tfpx
"CFO just sold over 900,000 shares. OUCH!! Company is very cash flow negative, has never made a profit and gives out huge stock options to the cushy execs. You can't compare it to Amazon, as Amazon's web services is the major money maker there."
Anyone else see this company going bankrupt? They had the market to themselves for so long and could not figure out how to turn a profit. Walmart with all its stores getting into furniture sales online? You can actually pick and return to your nearest location. Amazon also offering furniture. W was a fun ride but the party is almost over.

"there is no reason for this stock to be up 30.95% on the poor performance year after year. they report great sales but never report the millions of dollars on return goods. The only explanation are the MM's and computers controlling every tick up and tick down of this stock since is so heavily shorted. There will be a day of when Wayfair has a sign ""going out of business"". They can't keep losing money. But that said, apparently someone likes it."
Zacks still pumpin this. Ran out of gullible buyers though.
"Is there no one to correct them, OMG - - have mercy on this stock. It will be gone forever"
"lmao..... been gone for 7 days golfing,.... I can see you kids are lost without me... hope you bought the dip this morning.... up $7 today!!!! I was traveling......so I missed it... I see investors are moving to safety. market overheated.....good for W! warren buffet will be next.... he's a value investor."
So overvalued its sick
Will test 52 week low of $35 very soon. Dumping has just started.
"Everyone is home now buying new furniture and home accents and that tends to get old after a few weeks so with more stimulus federal reserve money people will keep buying. This is really good for Wayfair because you can't buy anything anywhere else and ""more money chasing fewer goods"" means that home accents which people want to renew every couple of weeks are a good buy."
https://www.barrons.com/articles/wayfair-soaring-stock-could-plunge-when-economy-reopens-51589498251Good read considering the Sales/profits this company is booking/booked will be abruptly evaporating now economy is opening. No wonder I receive 5 -6 emails a day about sales/deals. You know management has to do something dramatic to keep this fad going. Fossil stock 100% when they were booming. We know how that turned out Just saying
"I am short but want to remind that given huge short interest and 101% institutional investor holding (besides that this is a heavily manipulated stock), momos can wreak havoc for a short period of time - like the ramp up to 350 recently. So, depending on your risk tolerance capacity, look to hedge short positions with calls"
Most of the stuff sold on Wayfair is made in China. Can’t imagine the trade war tariffs being good for the stock.
Is it a good buy at this price?
Does anyone post here other then Sam?

"Don't know if people have seen this... I think it has been posted before.https://www.resellerratings.com/store/WayfairThere are over 70,000 reviews and 90% of them are horrible. Page through the reviews.They aren't fake. I went 20 pages deep and they're all written by real people that have hadmiserable experiences with this company. ""Bait and switch"" ""Never again"" ""Still waiting 2 months later for my couch"" ""Horrible customer service""....They go on and on.My question is...with a company that spends SOOOOOOO much on their revenue (advertising to acquire customers) and, for that reason, is absolutely counting on customers returning (So they don't have to pay all that money again to acquire new customers in the future), how on earth will they be able to continue when they are providing such a horrible experience???In my opinion, that's why they spend so much on advertising. Because their customers ARE NOT COMING BACK.So they continue to burn people over and over and over again.This is the big story that doesn't get talked about... but probably will eventually.The interesting thing is... if you go to Wayfair's site, all the reviews are good.Danger. This thing could POP in legendary fashion one day.Good luck."

This was $21 just a couple months ago....may take a little time and people can laugh, but this may hit sub $21 in next year or two. Company got no competitive advantage, negative net worth...when covid gone...timber! Puts are too expensive, I’m waiting for it to hit $400 or election time craziness before I commit."

"$13.5 bil marketcap and still losing money. Whoa, crazy market,"
Is anyone buying this dip S ?
tariff news has still not affected W. It might start today.
"On an up day W sure is sliding. I have to believe W went up in the last 90 minutes of Fridays trading with 200,000 shares bought causing a $1.20 cent gain from shorts not wanting to hold into the weekend. A series of short squeezes have brought W over $120. Insiders are probably selling today to upgrade their automobiles to BMW or Mercedes. Boston is an awful place to have a company headquarters as the taxes are too high. W should relocate to Florida or Texas."
"It's easily manipulated with such a small volume every day. Not enough float. Shorts keep shorting and covering higher... It will break at some point....god knows when, though."
"This thing is a dumpster fire waiting to happen...negative equity and likely decreasing sales growth when quarterly report comes out....I do not short stocks but if I did, this would be a good candidate..."
"Hmmm... overstock.com just plummeted 15% due to lack of sales and lack of guidance and yet Davidson downgraded Wayfair? Yea right, Wayfair will head back to mid 90s in the next couple months if not weeks"
Wow up 4.45 ! Is dead cat bounce ?
"Sammy. If your going to lie, go big. Why only $60,000? Why not $60,000,000? No one believes that someone with the money you claim to have would be posting 50 times a day in Yahoo message boards. Go big or stay home!"
"Gotta take profits when you can. Best days are early in the week and early mid day where it drops to a big low before it slowly moves back up at the end of the day. Unless there’s a fund selling down their position that day, light volume is easily manipulated. Bought puts couple weeks ago when it hit $185 and sure it was painful to see it go to $196. But it paid off. Sold some of my $185 puts yesterday when it hit the 140s. Bought $165 puts when it hit $167 today. I won’t ride up like Dean does..that’s for Robinhood day traders. While we shorts know W will go down, it’s not going to be as fast as we like. This is an overrated, money losing online furniture retailer that got lucky during the stay-at-home order and is no more than $40-70 stock even with its growth. Just have to be patient and stay the course."
lmao.....was down $3.50. what a gift!! I loaded up........ how can you lose?
This is at dumping level starting taking profit
"Sam, how are you ? Hope you are doing well .Just added 150 short shares at 153.81."

This company is bleeding money through every orifice .. just.. why .. Mr Powell.. why this company? At least prop up a company that provides essential goods and services...
when you don't know why it moves up or down for wrong reasons==sell==W is for free fall to $150!
If you think this is being manipulated then please go to the SEC website and submit a tip. If enough people think something wrong is going on then the SEC might investigate.

Algos propped it up today...I count 7 sessions since the morning short covering. Should have ended much lower based on the broad market sell off today. Somethings gotta give....
What was the low for this stock price this year?
3000 shares sold in pre-market because of senior note announcement. Never fails to amaze me how dumb some investors are. It’s not a Share dilution it’s Sensible debt offering. Means company is committed to growing revenues and customers.
"Congratulations to Wayfair for another hugely successful quarter! Expect more upgrades and inflows as Wayfair continues to execute on or ahead of plan, opens it's first few US outlet stores, welcomes a tsunami of Millennials into the brand, builds out western Europe, tightens the supply chain especially in China, streamlines deliveries across all geographies, expands product class offerings, builds world class teams in service and technology, etc., etc.There is no stopping the Wayfair JUGGERNAUT. We continue to hold our shares, add on weakness, and expect the next four years will bank returns even greater than the last 3.5 years since initiating our position at $22."
Seems Jason was wrong again on his predictions ...... Hope he sold while he could.

nobody does any analysis before posting here? Has anybody seen what's the app install rate on Wayfair? Q4 to Q1? 37% growth is massive. Analyze over the weekend then enjoy the week.
volume tells all
$300 / share easy by July 1...Get on board!!!
w is a weird stock. Goes up when market down and little changed or down when market goes up. I know retailing has been taking a hit lately but goodness. I love it. Be glad when this thing goes down to 30 where it would still be a gamble stock but would be priced better.
They beat lol. They will be out of money in six months.

Wayfair is the number one choice for furniture shopping now because of the pandemic for anyone that wants tons of options at affordable prices that are in stock. Way way easier than all the local horrible furniture stores. People don't want to waste time shopping for #$%$ over priced furniture that isn't in stock at their local store. This trend is here for good. Wayfair is a solid long term bet
Wayfair is up 8.16% to 276.50
"My question is the huge elephant in the room.... disagreements with the Auditors and risk of a restatement. The issue appears to be failure to take reserves (writedowns in inventory value) from the huge returns..... they are not even close to the standard metrics for writedowns on historical cost for damages and obsolescence compared to others in the industry who deal with consumer-facing deliveries. The W return rate appears to be about 2.5X industry average for heavy furniture. At just 3% damage and obsolescence, the margin effectively deteriorates to the point where now material in the eyes of auditors. The margin deterioration by an effective 2% means an additional 10% revenue growth just to break even. Already reflected in the stock price or am I over thinking this?"
"Morgan Stanley issues SELL rating today, 270 target"

Also the Chief Operating Officer that had purchased in the $90’s just sold 15,000 shares yesterday in the $131’s. That’s a substantial sell, why if the stock is going to $200 ?? Run  for the hills boys and Girls all you smart ones... W is coming to Papa and down fast. First downgrade and many more to come !!! Stock trader not covering till it hits $95 or less. I guess Stock Trader never makes any money ?? And he doesn’t know how to read a chart or see low float or feel momentum, he don’t know much at all. Lol "
Just found out new hedge funds shorting W too... no wonder why the short position continues to grow. It’s at 26% now and growing !!

if you have eyeballs and can see the operating income line on financials why would u be holding this company? the more they sell the more they lose. They are not gaining SGA or Advertising leverage. They are not amazon. Amazon actually will crush them. This wont end well.

"You wishful shorts, how sad is it that you have been signing the same tune for past 2 months! This is a great stock, made a fortune! Nothing more to say !Keep analyzing and listening to analysts that make 50 K per year; have you ever wondered why they need to tell you what a stock is worth? Yes, that is why they are analysts and not millionaires!"
"Wayfair go will go down to $100 or less soon... it gone up about 30% in 10 days. The chart tell us that 30% gains on no news ?? It will trace back to where it was. That pop was old shorts covering and locking up gains. Down it will come again, I don’t see who would invest in W for long term. There is so much completion out there and Amazon will eat them alive."
It will Rise up
How about 65? And that would be a generous valuation.
Losses close to 300 Millions per Q . They will need to funds to keep the lights on with 891 Millions cash .
buy that dip!! Easy money.......
Showing it’s weakness. Then their getting into brick and motar lmao investors don’t like it
"The claim that Wayfair is trafficking children is based almost entirely on one person’s confusion over an expensive cabinet. This conspiracy theory, like so many conspiracy theories, started with a wild and unfounded assumption that would be sickening if it were actually true. As of this writing, absolutely no credible evidence has been offered to back up this accusation."
"Once they get it rolling it becomes a type of perpetual motion machine, force higher, some shorts cover, more shorts jump on, force higher. Notice there's never a 7-8% decline?"
Everything is up 4-5% except w if it doesn’t go up today with the market then maybe it is reversing course.
"This market will go down very steep! W stock price may fall below $120 per share and Dow may fall below 20,000 again after the disappointing weekly unemployment claim number."
This is going back up because black Friday in store sales were down 50%. Same with Thanksgiving. Online is still big. doesn't justify this at $25B though and the story is down going forward after Christmas
Baseless claims and prove it
This stock overvalue .keep going up and then i short again
The only reason Wayfair this week was because of RH going up 20%. Wayfair should drop back down below $130 in the next few days. Overvalued internet stocks are bursting. Lots of the Cramer Covid stay at home internet growth stocks are going to see declines not seen since the internet bubble burst exactly 20 years ago. Companies like Wayfair will go bankrupt. SHOP will see it drop 90% as well as Zoom will drop 90% or more as Zoom is actually the one that has 4 companies with a combined market cap of over $5 trillion to compete against. I see zoom bankrupt in 2-3 years as it struggles to compete against MSFT. When stuff is free people use it. All businesses that use Microsoft Office get to use the video calling for free so its a good fit. Video calling is always free. No money to be made from it.
"INSANE valuation. its atleast double where it should be. Losses keep rising. This isnt a software name ,but a retailer."
I bought the dip! Just couldn't help myself....
Short position up. Anyone worried?
This pig will be 15 within two weeks. Everybody knows they need money. They will need by July now if not sooner. They will get no government money. No banks will loan them. Bond markets are dried up. Their only option is to dilute. Dilution will double the share count. I bet they wish they had that 150 million in worthless options that are sitting on their balance sheet back
Fall below $200 today?
Whats happening today is a complete flight to safety. Retail investors are joining institutions and piling money into money losing heavy debt companies that have absolute terrible fundamentals.Makes sense.
This will be down 10-20 points tomorrow
W is down -6.69% to 68.34
"W might get a relief bounce tomorrow, but ultimately that gap 130-150 will fill IMO.I don't see how a company losing money every year could be this high of a value. Maybe the longs think it's business model is like Amazon? Don't think so."
I believe W will have great online sales. The problem is the stock price already reflects the good sales numbers. That's why Wayfair received the downgrade yesterday to $115.
Wayfair is up 9.66% to 316.89
"Very simple , for those who thought w will be 200$ and bought w @130 above eagerly waiting for that jump . Do u people think w will go that far? Coz most analyst already lower their target bellow $125 and most of will get out as soon as it hits at $110."
puts volume @50 is 2/1 ratio with calls volume @65 for this Friday. just saying
Is it true? Massive accounting fraud reported today! Double billing to show increased sales? I have wondered for years! No wonder a billion loss a year!
no stopping it now!!...$200 by end of the month for sure..daily upgrades and daily increased price targets!! WS just loves this company!!..Andrew left is going broke!!

"Bought a bench from Wayfair and when I unpacked it I found part of it was broken. In the box, with no damage to the packaging. That means it was packed that way. Waited hour and half on hold for a rep. (wasn't about to give in), and they were very good but I will not buy anything from Wayfair again."

Massive outperformance once again..On its way to $10 Trillion..Supported by partnership with Tilray and Beyond Meat for edible vegan CBD chairs! Powered by Musk-designed solar drones!!
Banks and hedge funds are probably prowling around looking for short squeeze opportunities that carry any thin narrative of a spark .... just got to keep some ammo in account and ride it out.

"https://citronresearch.com/wayfair-is-growing-enemies-faster-than-customers/Andrew left nd citron research on wayfair. He is wrong on everything, unfortunately. It was written in April , and overstock has already surrendered and stopped competing on price. Taxes Jd trump are no big deal. They already paid taxes...the research is laughable , really."
Covid is not going anywhere until 2021 so this stock will rise. Management sold it because they know this stock will not go beyond $350. I would cash it as well if I own the stock for $20
"Oh, by the way, if you want to make money; you need to short your analysts recommendations. That is how I have built my fortune."
"Have been doing some research around Wayfair and I was surprised their rating on trustpilot is so low. Has anyone ordered from them? If yes, how was the experience? I wonder how many returning users they will have with such ratings... otherwise their cost of acquisition will remain super high..https://www.trustpilot.com/review/wayfair.com"
"ripping on no volume, sustainable"
Morning Sam just cover 300 shares shorted earlier at 126.36. Will cover the rest if it get to 120 today.
"Keep shorting, and make me more money!"
"1 starOriginal review: July 21, 2020I must preface this review by saying that I have never before posted a review of a company, positive or negative. However, I feel that the complete lack of professionalism and customer service I have encountered in dealing with Wayfair has warranted a public review. I hope my experience serves as a warning to others as they contemplate giving their business to Wayfair. This was my first experience with Wayfair and will definitely be my last.1 starI’ve ordered from Wayfair on several different occasions. From beds, to dresser sets and even pillows for my couch. On two occasions I was sent entirely different items from what I purchased and another time wrong sizes. The problem is in all actuality, the incompetence of the warehouse workers who seemingly pack whatever they want to apparently, but the bigger problem is the customer service and the so called supervisors who handle your issues as if you're the one who caused them.1 starOriginal review: July 20, 2020I had ordered from Wayfair in the past but they have gone way downhill. I ordered furniture as a gift. Not only did they not deliver as promised, but there was no communication. After multiple phone calls with hold times approaching two hours, I was promised 25 percent off and delivery the next day. Neither of these promises were fulfilled, and phone call was never recorded. I have now been told that I don't get the discout, I had another promise of next day delivery that wasn't met. I am not six weeks past the date of the original scheduled delivery with no ship date in sight. I will be avoiding this company in the future, as should you.maybe you should ask the analysts to buy something from W and then make a rating on them. They pollute with all the foam they use in packaging. Wake up!"
"Sam's not here right now, he can't stop crying. He only shows up if Wayfair is up 10 basis points or more.He bought the ""dip"" yesterday and bragged about it, but he didn't sell, so he is once again down. Easy call, eh Sam?"
"W is soon going to be a $20 Bill values with upgrades.. it is Next $SHOP $AMZN. Good day, today. GLTA"
"Well, maybe it's luck, but my post earlier was pretty spot on- we ended the day with a doji like I was hoping for, which often signals a reversal in trend. Kudos to the bears who held on till close and good luck all for next week. Don't wanna jinx it, but I am pretty sure we have seen the top now!"
I hope they lose more this Q! That should take it to $250. What a company! Load up the trucks again today!
Sam added my short at 134.82 . Will cover today.
Zacks must have just got some promo pay. Pump it up Zacks.
lots of insider selling above $80 noticed both founders have sold the majority of their total shares I think we've peaked
Nothing make sense so don’t try to understand it. Loss and shares go up. Profit and shares go down. It’s comical actually.
"Tom, you been watching BYND? its amazing what this one is doing!! much like TTD and W..... just goes up every day...low float, etc."
"Well, it did not end the day I would have liked, but still the only stock red on my screen. Good day for 4.9% up day on the markets. I will take it and love it."
Gonna be a landslide

"Wayfair has 7 times the market capitalization of Bed Bath & Beyond !! That is incredible and losing money  for years. How does this happen ? It should be trading below $35 in my opinion, but we will soon see $75. Mark this post."
"Wayfair has a beautiful forward P/E of Negative (-23.19) and Whooping book value of Negative (-6.57), Earnings per share of Negative (-7.47); a 25% Short Interest... what is there not to like in this stock. The company is burning cash and reducing prices to simply show some growth. This strategy will not work and the competition, Amazon will destroy it."
"Dirty manipulation again that’s all’s this is-dirty “on the take” analysts, dirty insiders -remember the super quiet suppressed $2.8 billion (for insiders) aprox drain of 12 mill share for $230 in Aug - no News On that except for what is said here - but analysts give the rah rah rah on the slightest “mean nothings” to pump this garbage - no credibility just fooling ,cheating people"
This stock trades 15 up or down post and pre market!
Looks like we have to do Sam method But reverse . Short on the pop !
https://twitter.com/heygalloway/status/1281262305527898118?s=20Wayfair is a child trafficking company...this is going to 0
So did we suddenly forget about the 12 mil shares dilution?
Losing ~$1Billion/year for next 4-5 years. CEO and execs are selling stocks like flees.Good luck to longs. You guys really need it.
So the business model is to spend on digital ad placements to drive sales. For every $2 they spend on advertising they get $1 in revenue. There's no profit in the business model. And if they ever stopped spending on ads the revenue would collapse. And the share price keeps going up up up. This is one of the few that I think is blatantly manipulated.
People know safety when they see it in this down market.. Strong distributable cash flow here...And amazing growth...
i need this to drop like 5 bucks tomorrow or i will be homeless
All the shorts out of there better cover before Wed. morning. Look what Overstock did after earnings
lmao.....wayfair going green!! Told you to buy the dip!! Whata a stock!
"SOLD! ...... like minting money.... buy the dip, sell the pop... only $400 today."
since that guy said sell I buy 100 shares at 125
"Wayfair Q1 Adj. EPS $(2.300) Beats $(2.600) Estimate, Sales $2.300B Inline7:07 am ET May 5, 2020 (Benzinga) PrintWayfair (NYSE:W) reported quarterly losses of $(2.300) per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $(2.600) by 11.54 percent. This is a 41.98 percent decrease over losses of $(1.620) per share from the same period last year. The company reported quarterly sales of $2.300 billion which met the analyst consensus estimate. This is a 18.25 percent increase over sales of $1.945 billion the same period last year."
Wayfair has almost all its losses back from depths of the $7 slide yesterday. Amazing stock..... impossible to lose money on it...
"I've been in long since $20 share, was about to hit the sell button at $100/share and got bullish and let it ride. :("
I am so glad such a horrible company is going down. All the complaints from good customers is now being justified. When you do bad business you will go down.
Wayfair to issue $1.2 Billion in convertible notes. shares dropping in after market. Very smartmanagement since its a great way to take advantage of extremely overpriced shares.
I thought we were celebrating the end of lock-down today.
"lmao....wayfair closed near its top.... down only 51 cents.... if you bought the dip this morning, you made money!! I tried to tell you..."
if you own wayfair say thanks to Trumptard for allowing the virus out of control. over 130k cases today and nearly 2k deaths made the covid play back on!
Up and to the right....Every second of every minute! It's a like a pepetual motion device!
"This company is a shell company. The company hasn't ""officially"" made a profit, analysts are changing the rating to ""Outperform"" from ""Neutral"", using missing kids names as sets, and the excessive prices for those sets. The rating should be ""Abandon Ship"" since there aren't any earnings. Why hasn't the IRS investigated this company. The IRS states that a company has to produce a profit at least three out of five years, otherwise it is a hobby. Since when are hobby's listed on stock exchanges? It should be obvious that there is something more to this company than meets the eye."
"W up to $149 now........ Tom , I'm sorry about that short at $141.12! life on the dark side is getting a little painful, isn't it? we have room for you on the Brinks Truck train, if you'd like to ride up money mountain with us!"
Drop to $130 tomorrow.
"Big guys are dumping, see the 127K spike."
"Wayfair has adopted a new accounting standard, effective Jan. 1, 2021. Under the old system, the company says it would have reported a loss of 31 cents per share."
It looks like they are spending on advertising a whole lot. I wondered how much of the quarterly losses are responsible for their massive losses? I truly believes that Wall Street is promoting this stock to be a pump and dump. I will not invest into this for free. It just have too much debts and nothing are being projected for positive earnings. How much longer can they write off losses?
If this doesn’t have blow out. I mean super blow out numbers This quarter. Down 40-50 bucks guaranteed!!!Conference call will be a joke talking about higher customer demand and orders. Well dahhh. People were forced to stay home and shop online. Not so much any more!!Ya da ya da ya da. Making false promises of Future growth and false predictions of a profitable company Ya da ya da ya da. This company was in trouble before the pandemic and will be after. Clearly retail buyers get wiped out because they don’t have millions to manipulate the stock price. Just saying
Sell Wayfair
7% drop tomorrow in store... if the market maker controlling this stock is on this board can you please make sure it drops at least 7% tomorrow? Thank you very much in advance
"lmao...W dipping first thing, as usual!....then it will go green, as always!! watch and learn ....same pattern every single day.."
180.66? this makes no sense
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5yR-LFt3bcIs Wayfair innocent? Watch the video and read between the lines of the the Wayfarir statement and judge by yourself. Wayfair's statement continued: “The products in question are industrial grade cabinets that are accurately priced. Recognizing that the photos and descriptions provided by the supplier did not adequately explain the high price point, we have temporarily removed the products from site to rename them and to provide a more in-depth description and photos that accurately depict the product to clarify the price point.”"
Pandemic has showed me the limitations of buying stuff online. Retailers have found a way to optimize reviews and pictures to make things look different than what they really are. There are so many things I'll rather see and touch before I buy now. Just waiting to get my second shot and off i will go to the BRICK and MORTAR stores. We forget how going to stores was a chance to people watch and maybe meet new people
I dont see whats the point of bringing more customers if the loss is going to increase...Your customers are not paid subscribers that they will generate revenue stream... Increase revenue and and double the losses..hahhaha whats the point??
Will this trash ever come down?I bought some decor pillows one time but tossed them away because they came with cheap materials.I haven't bought anything ever since. Who are buying their craps?
"yawn.....new highs probable for today... Copperstein is not going to be happy.,,,,sigh.. you see Copperstein, theres 36% insider ownership, the vast majority of the rest is owned by institutions. ITS A VERY LOW FLOAT STOCK!....its also heavily shorted by retail sheep. and , of course, they keep covering....you will, too!...Its also loved by Wall Street because of the growth metrics. lmao.......you better hope for a recession. thats the only thing thats going to take this down without a major negative catalyst. WS just raises targets .......anyone shorting into that environment would have better odds taking one pull on a slot machine......just ask ANDREW LEFT. there have been sheep here, like DOUGIE, and Chuckie, etc. ....they all got touched BAD! old shorts get slaughtered and new shorts come in, like you.......rinse repeat!"
Going to 40
$170+ at close as investors look for companies with safe cash flows in this market...
Lmao.... the battle at $143 rages on with high volume and fierce protection of the vaunted support! All WANG stocks getting killed... I predict $143 WILL HOLD!!!
Should close right at 150. Lots of 150 outs for this stock that usually doesn’t have much option trading g
Why the stock price still stay up high
Buy the dip! Should go green today!
the rocket ship takes off again !!! AMAZING!! what a company..... what a stock.... massive volume again..... $200 soon
They're stair stepping it down. Gradually lowering so skittish retail isn't startled.
Down 10% already since recent high mark
Still can’t believe I bought this at 24 and sold at 51
"higher it goes, cuz they are growth company, they dont need to make profits. banks are flushed with liquidity- they will happily loan to w. w will sell lots of furniture because ppl at home want lots od diy projects to not feel bored."
Decent volume today. W shareholders are slowly waking up from their Fed fueled stupor.Wayfair will suffer greatly from the US-China trade war. It will the products they resell and will hurt their supply chain. Double whammy that all flows to doubly hurting the W bottom line.
$4.50B+++ Revenue and $1.50++ EPS.....forecast $18-20B revenue for 2021....$14-16B 2020....1.6X sales only still at that is cheap in the online retailer growing at 45% year clip! We should be at 5-10X sales!!
"LMAO......BYND calls I sold are making me a ton ! Couldn't short it , so I sold calls...not going buy them back yet either...."
Notice how volumes low for weeks now they are up at this hi price - shorts jumping in for the big pump and dump
"Buy the Dip, because one people have used the website they'll continue using it in the future. That's how Amazon got popular"
Short squeezes do not last more than a week. Shorts that are within their margin limits will just hold and wait. This stock is way over its skis and will go down.
The fall to bankruptcy will be more drastic than Sears. Wayfair will be bankrupt by February at the latest.
Whts going on. Even when the market is down Wayfair is going Up. Big manipulation!
"TOM, this will continue to drop, in my opinion......however, take some profits......"
Good time to short at $135
"I see the shareholders here, not all, but many are mostly concerned about their portfolio. They are in denial about the possibilities that have been exposed to them. The day will come with the FBI raids Wayfare. You’ve been warned. ￼"
"Look at shop and Roku both down premarket, this is low market volume bullskit it real"
"Hey guys just doing my TA to see when to profit take on my short - am I reading my graph right the next downward resistance in 126.70, anyone else able to confirm or deny (actual analysis only please)"
Still very cheap when comparing to Shopify when comparing price/sales
Raj on the burner phone “hurry hurry get that bag of money over to all analysts to print anything to stop the slide “
hope you bought the dip this morning....already went form red to green!... should be good to go now....off to the races! running up Into earnings!
Only thing green!! True Wall Street Hitters know value
"My brief summary: Earnings were priced in, stock looks exhausted, I think it will sell off from here.I don't think there is anyway they can keep numbers so high moving forward and Trustpilot shows just how few customers are satisfied with their service. I am now short with a target price of 185 (medium term).It is natural for the institutions who bought lower down to need to sell - W would have been 1% of their portfolio before, but now it did a 20x, it will be 20% hence they HAVE to sell in order to re-balance.Good luck all!"
Hi All I make my own decisions but you have more experience with W . I am short W and want to stay short. It appears the market is going up a little here. What is your opinion to stay short or sell my options and get short again when it goes down for sure. Thank you Dave
Kind of appears the algos decided 150 was enough and are now selling.
"Anyone who's chasing this thing thinking it's going to be just like a 1999 internet stock piggy bank better be careful. Momentum plays in this environment is a no no. Newbies, careful."

people ride the wave. then move on.
"I have been selling a little from 60 up, still have a few shares left and every point I sell 2 shares, wont be much longer till I am out of shares."
"There are very few companies right now that the government is looking at that are ""essential"" and that will be continuing the economy after the ""covid scare"" and Wayfair is one of them. When businesses can't do ""brick and mortar"" the government will buy companies like Wayfair to sell to consumers and keep the economy going. People still want to buy furniture and home accents and basically anything you could get at Ikea. Wayfair is the new Ikea because Ikea can't conduct business with the lockdowns and they still have to pay a lot of money for their stores and employees. Wayfair ""circumvents"" this cost and passes it on to shareholders which is great for both the business and the economy and consumers. This is a great wave of new buying and will make a lot of money for everyone and save a lot of money for consumers."
A 43% revenue increase cannot offset the 60% increase in negative earnings
"Hey shorties, some of you claim that W loses money with each sale. If you believe that, you should buy some goods on W to increase their loses.As a shareholder, I thank you in advance for the extra EBITDA made on incremental sales."
Wayfair should start coming back now.... I made a few phone calls...$6.30 down right now...... it will bounce...
Just remind yourself this is a $23.5 stock in middle of March. Absolutely bloated pig.
"Day after tomorrow, this thing is going to crash HARD."
i sold this at 57. 
How long are you guys going to convince yourselves that this is going to tank? How do you actually make any money. Accept the fact that analysts couldn’t make a dime in the market if their life depended on it.
I wouldn’t short this into earnings. This is still a housing play and that trend is not ending
You have to be a passive index investor managing others money to own this value investment overnight. This can open 20 points up or 40 down easy.
Sam the sham: back up the REPO truck to repossess all of your stuff!.... I can't stop laughing!
This and Shopify trade hand and hand. Both extremely overpriced.
"Wayfair just reported an outstanding quarter. Quarterly free cash flows have always been negative.However,for the latest quarter free cash flow exceeded $700MM.The question is will positive online furniture trends be sustainable ,or is this just an aberration as a result of the pandemic. We shall see. The balance sheet shows that half of its long term debt consists of low interest rate convertible bonds.Based on the call provisions of these bonds, the debt may be converted to come stock which will help the capital structure of the company.It will be interesting to see how these trends unfold and how vulnerable the the company is based on S&P Global Intelligence."
some fund trying to buy the company! but interesting that they havent reported despite having ownership of more than 5%. using multiple vehicles to collude!
W is down 6.39% to $108.27
Last chance to buy below $150..On its way to $500 in a month..THen up from there...Edible furniture concept partnering with Beyond Meat should be a no brainer...Just my opinion..
Last ditch effort to keep it over 150 - Wayfail.
Gotta give credit to those who held on this far. I prob would have sold at 100 maybe less lol
"paying Google $100m per quarter to lose $140m every quarter is not a sustainable business model. Growth model will not work when recession hits. I expect some institutional selling after this pop is done. They know we are closing in to the end of the bull run, and that W is a worthless stock and company."
Lots lots are of vaccines announced today - Down the toilet W goes - their dirty” got ya “ business is over
"After Amazon furniture, this company is out of business."
"Well I guess the newbies are eating their humble pie today, though I think this is still an OK level to get out before a larger drop comes. The charts are starting to look very tasty to the downside - I am looking for 165 next stop, if we break that, then look out below!!"
I'm glad I bought a few months ago
Complain to SEC about this fake stock price manipulation. Both artificial high demand and fake dump to make investors lose money.
He ordered $2000 gazebo they returned his money said they were out of stock then delivered the item sent worker to install all for free. That's how they lose money
Curious to hear some thoughts here. Thinking of open puts $150 strike for Friday. Is that crazy? Any big down day on the major indices and I think this falls back all the way $140-150.. No idea how this got such a heavy bump on zero earnings..
Finally where it needs to belong
"If you understood W huge expenses as a company, I don't think you would ever own this stock. W isn't the next AMZN, its the next etoys."
Where are my guys Eric and Hornets? Did you see the dilution registration 45 minutes after market close?
You guys all have it wrong. It popped on the Motley Full buy call. I got it at the absolute peak. Uggh. But I know MF knows what they're doing.
80 is more likely

Almost 18% short interest. Sure helps explain all the negative comments on this board. On line shopping is not going to decline any time soon. But there are a whole lot of traders that soon need to cover their short positions.

Try it again:Besides the SEC, one can also report fraudulent account issues or misconducts to the Muddy Waters Research (https://www.muddywatersresearch.com/contact-us/).

Yes, the small float and high institutional%, hence manipulation- but I knew it had to fall. My highest (and biggest) short was at $142. Then I believe it was nov, they announced earnings premarket. I covered at $92 and made a killing. I watched the action after i was out. Same action-- steady rise for no reason--pure manipulation. So now I have been shorting this new rise (many short trades below $130 and a big one in $160s) I am stuck. But I have the money to hold the short and add more to it. Wayfair will fall again. And when it does, it will fall quickly -- again. Any game has its end. And the only winner in the Wayfair trading is a short.--W has no chance in a recession when consumers cut their spending--recessions kill growth model stocks--high institutional held stocks are fun to watch in early recession trading--the funds try to kill eachother trying to get out before all of the othersI am primarily a currency trader, so I have to review global eceonomic activity. Global economic activity is slowing quickly. The US is in the best shape, but we ARE heading towards a recession. When the US/China trade deal breaks, I believe the markets will ""sell the news"" as equities have already risen 20% in the last 2 months. I will cover my current W position below $50 this time. My guess is the time frame for that will be early 2020."
"Wayfair is cooking the books. Booking sales by shipping product off site, not booking returned goods in same calendar quarter.....this is going to end badly..."
"waiting to short,the end is inevitable,its on S&Ps most dangered stock,too expensive-SHORT of the century soon,there sales splurge IS OVER!! Short near 340,, going back to 70, KATZ'S NUMBER!!"
Look buyers showed up. And they are willing to pay a higher price. What a staged farce.
please sell so I can cover my short at only an 800% loss :(
If overstock is down 30% that means W at 30% down will be $230!!!!!
Remember 12 million share dilution in August for $230/ share
FLUUUUUSSHHHH!!!!!! Down she goes!!! BWAhahahahahahaha...timberrrrrrrrrr!!!!!
crooks are at work... keeping the price in place for option expiration
Firm can only make $ from short seller on this stock.No individual will buy at this price. The price will keep pumping up.
When S&P reaches Jan 2020 level then Fed will stop pumping stocks and will focus on bonds and USD.Start shorting W then. This will be back less than 100 soon.
this could be the year for W
Is rnklf undervalued gold mine
anyone else buying puts for earnings?
Tomorrow’s open could be 142
"Becuase we didnt see heavy selling on the pop today, we should get at least one more pop on this stock before earnings. I would image we will see 114 115ish before we see some stronger resistance. Looks like the base formed at a little over 100. Get in long for some nice short term gains"
"Awesome up 10% no news, opening up some synthetic shorts"
This will slowly settle back to the 120’s Hover there until August earning and make another push toward 180 on pending Q2 results then settle back again. Similar to what just happened. Uncles they bolt on other products they will repeat this cycle for ever. Too one dimensional to chase a Shopify
I cant figure out whats holding this stock down!??? its only going up $5 to $7 a day...... must be manipulation!!
The only reason for this walking dead stock to rise are short squeezes and MoMo-Traders.Look out below.
"Their IoT, cloud based AI robots can manufacture!!! Tariffs don't matter"
"This is a trading stock only. Which way do you think market will go today. When everybody thinks the virus is over and things are back to normal it tanks. When people are worried it shoots up. Zoom, wayfair and peloton trade same way. Just to name three. Many are trading like this. In the end. This pos will be bankrupt. They will never make money delivering big bulk items. Low margins items. Amazon never wanted to touch what wayfair sells. They are now just because they do not want way getting too big in my opinion."
Running out of buyers....soon that 150 will break.
This Looks like it will drop to 160s tomorrow
The big boys always pump the equity so they can dump on the retailers . lol
Going to $540 zone in the next few months is my guess...
How can you justify the stock price of 154 when they lose over $6 a share?
"Up up it goes! Where it stops nobody knows!All you negative, cramer lovers who actually try and analyze stocks, ha! Macd,P/E, bollinger bands, etc etc. Analysts, Analysts keep trying, that is why there are thousands that make 50k as analysts; because they can’t make money in stocks!Like Cramer, like motley fools, etc. They need to sell you on their reports that are absolutely useless; if they had the answers they wouldn’t be telling you.Peter Lynch did the study years ago and monkeys who threw darts at a chart made more money than the analysts.Take a chance, and make money, I will now retire and I have to thank all the negative analyst and short sellers comments for bringing this down to $28 for me to pour money into it. Thank you!!!! I’ll be in the Bahamas; keep analyzing:)"
Volume has died on this stock. Maybe signaling a top?
I'm seeing unsubstantiated rumors about W closing on other boards. Anyone here have insight into this?
"Anybody who is curious, go to YouTube and search for Amazing Polly. Watch her latest posted video on Wayfair. If after that you still aren’t convinced there is something very strange here, then I can’t help you."
otsk only up a louisy 14% todayW on its way down
Did anyone short TSLA this morning ?
This is manipulation at its best. Nobody believes in the end story here. you just get on the train and hold on. I have played this pig on five up and downs now. Goes way up. Then kicks profitability down the road and it goes down. Then sales increase and it goes back up. If they do not make a profit this q it will prove they never will. It will tank back to 50$ in two weeks. Can not wait to load up on puts right before earnings. It usually tanks right after.
Last callPump for pedos
"In response to the new tariff plan, Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Fassler said, “The biggest negative surprise for our covered consumer sector vs. our economists’ prior expectations relates to furniture.”According to Fassler, 65% of furniture imported into the US is from China. Home furnishing giants such as Restoration Holdings RH, Williams-Sonoma WSM, At Home Group HOME and Wayfair W are all at risk here."
"Over 500,000 shares traded as a result of short covering! W could be in trouble in the next two months or longer! Short term who knows because the fix is always in play"
Senior note issuance guarantees funding in place to continue to grow the business. CNBC just said drop in oil prices huge benefit to retail as consumers have more disposable income.
dot com stock............too funny
W should just buy AMZN and AAPL.....just get it over with..... its going to happen sooner or later... amzn is no competition for them anymore.... they've won that contest..... Tim Cook could run the logistics for them.
"TOM, been trading ISRG last few weeks.... its been in a range... done real well... just 200 to 300 shares at a time... have a buy in at $541 right now.... made some nice money on NFLX also..... shorted at $290, $293, $295 and $296........ covered everything but the $290 short, my first one!! was able to cover yesterday at $289....and $290.. what fun!"
You're missing out if you don't buy this dip! Works 90% of the time!! $140 s. Can't go wrong.....safety stock!!
"Ouch, someone has been reading the financial statements of this company."
just bought more puts. I am way too heavy on this pig crashing more
whats the news here?
"If Sam doesn't sell his shares soon we will have to start a ""go fund me page"" for him"
"Wayfair would never ever go private.......they prefer to share their losses, so jump in!! Its perfectly normal for a money losing company to go up 400% in 3 weeks, happens all the time."
I don’t understand how insiders have been selling so much. Don’t they have a blackout period
It is fun buying on wayfair website 
How are shorts getting crushed? This things been basically flat for 2 weeks. Rome wasn’t built in a day. Give time you’ll see 150. No volume
"Just checked out Amazon Scout... Wayfair could spin up the exact same concept by this Monday if it wants to. I've seen the same thing done in ""hackathon"" weekends in the past. It's gimmicky."
And there it is —on the take analysts —- yahoo finance to the rescue
haven't covered yet. was hoping it drop more at the end...
BUY....here at 150.86.This stock is killing all the shorts.
"All you slow minded wannabes, Joel, wade..... have to do is look at the time of my posts and then see where the stock was when I posted it!!! Haven't made one call after the fact....ever!!!"
I think the stock is in danger. Many social media influencers are boycotting Wayfair. This will definitely affect their sales.
"is nasdaq was rome, W would be the best gladiator. Investing in W is what wet dreams are made of."
Wayfair is up 9.18% to 281.82
Nice swing! Sure hope you bought the dip like I told you this morning.....
Perfect point in time to double down a buy more puts! That’s what I just did.
This is not a financially healthy company. Theyre not profitable. Operating income was significantly lower in 2017. Their debt levels arent great. They have some cash but its not exactly a warchest. It certainly doesn't justify a higher price tag.
W has a GAAP profit. nice cooking abmd manipulation of books. super. let's manipulate the stock now to be 450.
The pedo machine is back at it again!
Bought more 7k $177 to squeeze shorts holding 43k average $89 $LULU $TSLA $AMZN $QQQ $NIO
Markets are in freefall as Trump is expected to sign a bill condemning China and will likely go forward with tariffs as China has lied about making promises to buy goods which never happened.
March 2020 it was $27? But Corona is all but over. The big financial benefit has already happened.
here are some facts: Doubtful accounts first 6 months increased to $60m. that's a direct loss to profits.Cash increased by $1B (same level as 3q2019 so who cares. it's after a massive debt undertaking). Accounts payable up $400m this quarter for all those new sales.Notes payable/ST debt payable increased by $300m in the quarter.Long term debt up $400m in quarterLiabilities exceed assets by $788m in Q2.Buy back $700m stock with cash from issued debt. that's totally normal for a healthy company right? ( Sarcasm)Negative Shareholder Equity of $800m. equal to 4q2019. Positive cash was $879m after issuing $528m in NEW debt. Made $200m cash from investments which is a one time event. lost $450m from investments 4q2019 (volatile).25% of shares are short waiting for this facade to crumble
YAWN...... morning ladies!! wonder how much ill make today?? I sure hope TOM is ok..... he got smoked shorting this... $141.12 was the last one I remember......that has to hurt.... I tried to tell him...
Any body have any idea when wayfarer will be profitable in near future. After how may years this comp may will have competitive p/e ratio or fundamentals. At present investors are buying stocks not because of fundamentals but for more on speculation. I ma not investing on such high momentum stocks.
Sam my 143 short is not looking so bad now . Hope you sold at 142 earlier !
Basically no volume today...I added a lot more...Waiting the BYND / W edible furniture JV announcement...Should be coming soon...
Just a little bit higher so I can get out of this stock!
Someone's propping this up...
you have to by this dip!!! what a gift!!!!
"when you have 12 million shares to offload to bag holders, at 100k per day, it takes time... keeping this turd up. Plus the $700m buy back to pump price to $300 so the funds can take $50-$70 gain per share to the $230 conversion price."
https://www.marketwatch.com/story/wayfair-stock-drops-after-losses-deepen-year-over-year-2020-05-05?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoololol. guy writing the news is so clueless.
How much going down if market down .$130 soon
Man I’m jealous for whoever bought the gem.
Careful here averaging shorts. This looks like a stall out to get us in. Watch for a lunchtime run up
Whole market red!!! Green here!!!
"So when are the downgrades the ""buy"" to ""hold""? Analysts recommending jump on at $314, after a $100 month, run up?"
"Classic 'window dressing' here - push it up for the end of the month- great for funds (worth looking up if you don't know about it). Also options expiring today, so great for MMs to manipulate higher for the day. I expect double digit drops into next week, then earnings to push us further down. I am calling a top here!"
this is a lemming stock
$W has been a good one. Bought 1000 shares at $34.00 still holding strong. COVID will keep it running through elections and then ?
Another 9 bagger today?? Or a dramatic reversal?? W is like the stock version of a soap opera
"After 4th quarter results are posted, please announce new CEO, CFO, Controller, and Board Member in charge of Audit Committee. This company desperately needs discipline, internal controls, KPI's, and contract terms that hold suppliers and 3rd party warehouse and transportation carriers accountable for poor packaging ad handling. With the right management team in place, revenue may be flat to down 25% first full year, but should be able to have positive cash flow within 24 months."
total debt went up $500m right before this crisis. if Amazon has struggles sure as hell these guys do. I have to think only reason price going up is a short squeeze. once that's over it will loss as usual
"If I had wayfair shares, I would switch to gold. Nice run up using wayfair now jump onto next fast rising asset GOLD."
Who in the hell is buying this? Someone who is wiser than me please explain what is happening..
"Is Wayfair going up due to an epic short squeeze? Shows 35% of shares are short. I'm a bit perplexed how a company that has never had a profit, and still loses a lot of money even after increase in users by 28% can be valued so much.Are they reinvesting back into the company like Amazon? What am I missing here?Would appreciate some intelligent responses."
Check out the MICHAELS STORES MIK...curbside pickup and what's everyone doing if ETSY stock is booming...ARTS & CRAFTS
I wish the earnings call was sooner but I'm confident we'll see some upside to this stock. Takeover rumors just help fuel the price.
Double top about to form
Higher highs means further falls!! Go shorty....!! One day true price discovery will matter.
Monday will be interesting to say the least
This manipulated stock price is fake as a 9 dollar bill. They are just waiting for suc kers to buy at this level.LOL.
Am I the only one surprised it’s down today?
STOCK TRADER : are you still in the game? Short more going for broke?
Had since $24 in March of 2020 lmao.They hold as bipolar a projection as any I've ever seen in 2021 and beyond
"Insiders won sell their shares then W will go to the market to look for Moe money. Their cash will only last for 2-3 quarter. They will need to find the money 1-2 quarter before ...Probably, going to < $60."
Congrats to all long that sold high today ! It will b our turn to make money after earning .
You should be overjoyed to be selling at these levels. It will be heading even lower next week.
"Morning Sam, are you still holding any W short share ?"
wayfair is down 50 cents in premarket!!!! How can that be?? It's manipulation !!!! I'm calling the sec.... this has to stop !
"Start a short position but expect it to stay strong today. It's 1999 all over again. Shorts getting squeezed today. Start shorting this, but small."
I wish I can run my business and not turn a profit and still be in business
"if you still think W is going up, let me show you their position:- W is way overvalued-Their sales where good bcs all of the stores where closed, not anymore. Thier competition is back and running-The Nasdaq etc are way overpriced and a pullback will come soon draging everything down with it-There is a Finance war with china and W is importing everything from China! Once they throw some crazy 20-30% tax, W will be making 2/3 of what they are making now even if they keep doing the same sales-W is a fomo stock which will be forgotten and will keep falling simply bcs there will be no intrest-No body will invest long term in a company that went from $20 to $190 i 2 months at this price-W entered a bearish state which will need a strong catalist to enter out of (The next probable would be in a month, their earnings)If you made some crazy money on this run up i feel like you should take your money somewhere else before you lose it. Everything is against this stock and will be for a few months."
W- foolish to buy now
Already disproven by snopes
"Katz says back to $70, Economy is stronger,No Need for wayfair, crash will be fast & soon."
Clowns who paid over $345.00 a share for (W) with a minimum purchase of 2000 shares can furnished their 1500 square feet penthouse no charge from (W) BBBBOOOOYYYYAAAA
"Cramer just said ""you can't own the competitor that Amazon is coming after,"" when asked about Wayfair today. Also looks like it wants to break down to $80, or below, after dropping below last month's lows. And...fundamentals."
Overstock is a much better option at this point. Wayfair is way overpriced.
"Just as I predicted. And imagine how this will look once news start spreading on the bigger networks. Even without news, these fundamentals are worth shorting."
"Thank you Mr. Market. Bought Etsy yesterday, and W today. Always look to the trash to find some stock return treasure."
W reached a new All Time High at 145.82
No volume at all today as you'll notice...Purely algo driven and maybe AMZN insiders trying to punish...
look at this trash run....looks like $150 is coming now
revenue barely beat. way overdone stock. the earnings is not recurring.
"hmmm. AM ""equity infusions"" followed by flipping a few cents back and forth at new set level on very low volume."
From the filing...Approximate date of commencement of proposed sale to the public:As soon as practicable after the effective date of this Registration Statement.
Andy I disagree! Will not go down till Aug 4th after the next earnings report! I have been correct on this stock.
for God's sake just let it correct already  get it over with.
Short RIP to 200. Shorts Never touch this stock again. Watch how many margin calls
This company has yet to make a penny and their losses just keep getting bigger and bigger....yet somehow people still think this is a great stock 
W is down -15.05% to 81.29
$70 by the end of March. You shorts just keep cheering each other on. Squeeze is coming so over sold and revenues heading to $10b
W is down -7.42% to 107.54
100% down trend hard to get bears cover into weakness even harder to get clueless retail to buy into a down trend
WILL DROP EVEN MORE AFTER HOUR
Keeping the market up for all those overpriced IPOS. ..then BOOM!!!
24000 shares fake bids to scare the shorts . Today is the day to crash . IMO
We've been doing some share price modeling for Wayfair over the next 6 - 9 months and it looks like the haters will finally get the $80 or $85 price target they want. Just one problem. It comes with a 2:1 stock split.
"Just a heads up for those that listen to overzealous ppl like Sam: no insider PURCHASES were made. Only many sells. Learn to read a form buddy. Lol. Not saying this is going down either but that just proves you will say anything, including spreading false info."
W will close north of $150 today.
Im curious how wayfair have repeat customers given on yelp they have lots of negative reviews
"Just more prop up #$%$ ?repurchase, from time to time, ? why not all now ? No they will wait til it tanks ? on big stuff ?from time to time ? use some small blocks to manipulate & float the stick price from crashing"
"It's pretty gross that financial engineering like W gets rewarded-- selling while losing money destroying a market segment, not only big companies but a ton of mom and pop smaller furnishing companies too-- the American way."
W wow. Amazon Prime had great add on furniture NCIS New Orleans. Can W compete with Amazon on h9me furnishings
FALL ALREADY
$350 next week
Buy more before it hits 367..
Hopefully it spikes back up for one last short before earnings.
"This is too easy.... going to soar after earnings......all about growth, market share, and margins.... growth will be huge, we know that. They have been advertising everywhere!! We know they are taking hug every market share.....that's been documented.... the only question is margins, and they were higher then expected last quarter, so id expect a nice run after earnings, even better then the runnup into earnings..... mortgage the trailer, kiddies ...... go long and buy yourself a new bowling ball...."
TWSH (True Wall Street Hitters) know how to find green in a sea of red. Like W today
KP.....you sure picked a good day to short at $170.....here's a little tip!!....never short when the price target has just been raised..
If you want to short now? Too late. It will drag you up and short squeeze. Run and long something else
Hello guys. Did anyone cover yet ? Tempted to cover some at 89ish.
"In 2016 I shorted and was hooked 88,000 ! I was stubborn and luckily had several month out options. Went through Two short squeezes before coming all the way back ! Made my 88K back plus 3,000 I learned then the stock is definitely manipulated! I don’t care though I just trade the trend!"
"Coupon code may be the key, indicates vetting."

@Benjo and Sam you guys must have ton of dry powders to add on any dip. Nice !
keep the momentum ... break into the 70's
Berenberg initiated Wayfair as sell............yup a sell ...it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see the problems with Wayfair
"back on the way down. Every metric dropped significantly from Q2. Sales drop $500m, earnings drop 30 cents, gross profit drop .2B, net income are all down Q over Q and then no guidance provided"
"Don't worry folks, Wayfair only looses a little over $6 per share. They import the vast majority of their products from China and risk money is coming out of the market. Hang in there"
GAME OVER.....YOU'VE BEEN AMAZONED....RIP....
"The new PT's as of today are 155 (Loop Capital Markets), 145 (Zachary Fadem Wells Fargo), and 108 (Colin Sebastian, Robert W. Baird).It is allowed to go over its price targets....lost of stock are doing it....let see if we get any more on Monday, but in general this is up too much too fast."
Can some tell me the after hours volume
Is fed pumping this stock?
Does this company ever make money?
Things get worse. More delays for their new distribution center. Laying off more workers. They can’t ever afford to relocate them for a short period of time
"There is no top to this disrupter ..... it is, by far, the greatest company in the world! The stock goes up every single day.....they own the market, and everyone knows it."
"Outlook - Wayfair ST: the RSI is overboughtRiseLimited RiseConLimited DeclineDeclineRecent Technical ChangeUnchangedMedium Term View: RangeBullishRangeBearishRecent Technical ChangeUnchangedOur pivot point is at 133.9.Our preference: the upside prevails as long as 133.9 is support.Alternative scenario: the downside breakout of 133.9 would call for 124.5 and 118.9.Comment: the RSI is above 70. It could mean either that the stock is in a lasting uptrend or just overbought and therefore bound to correct (look for bearish divergence in this case). The MACD is positive and above its signal line. The configuration is positive. Moreover, the stock is above its 20 and 50 day MA (respectively at 116.68 and 103.41). Finally, Wayfair has crossed above its upper daily Bollinger band (136.97). Wayfair is currently trading near its 52 week high reached at 156.78 on 22/02/19."

W is down -4.93% to 136.20
How could anyone with a conscience own this stock.
Why the price high because they are selling wrong products. If you by order furniture but you getting gold this company is very rich they are playing with own stocks this company ceo Indian you know how they play stocks one day he pay the price
i am sure they will beat. that is why the board dumps their shares as soon as they are awarded.
An incredible evaporation of capital. Like the clearance bin at a store. Longs you've been written down 33% and further write downs may be in store.

"SEC must investigate false stock purchase, too EXPENSIVE,nobody buying at this price, nose bleed price!!"
It's now well below its November the 9th top. 8 Months to lose 9$. Could have done something else with that money.
"Sam , How are you ? Glad to see you stop by. M still here . Looks like your curse worked very well. M thinking of buying TTD and short HD . What do you think?"
bear trap. It will be gain 20% after market open tomorrow.
they will be doing a secondary round of financing soon. Probably will be announced on next earning call. I am thinking they will be diluting. Not sure how well they could do in the bond market. It would be junk rating at this point. You can not borrow money cheaply with a negative worth and heavy losses every q
This stock has enough evidences of manipulation . It will end up with SEC.
The home retail and essentials run is over. Next is travel food& beverages and real estate stocks.

"Nice Green Day, as expected! My calls inching up....."
Is any short giving up yet ?
Oooooooooo look at the NASDAQ
Off 60.00 last 2 mo...need earnings
"This company needs to raise additional money to keep going, like yesterday. I would expect a share offering at any moment. The question is, at what price can they float enough new share to put significant cash into the business? This company appears to have a failed business model but the stock is almost too dangerous to touch. Just yesterday it was around $25 and now we are above $200. Eventually it will probably crash and burn but in the mean time you can get burned shorting it."
Another $17 pop in seconds this morning for this stock. Such a joke!!! Defies ALL logic.
How can institutional ownership be 125% of the company? No wonder the stock trades so bad. It’s not liquid if institutions own more than the outstanding shares. How is this even legal?

Its actually hilarious watching how small the orders are at the bid and ask - single shares trading ie the Robinhood crowd lol If they can't trade in proper lots they should not be gambling...
"Call me crazy, but I am pretty sure the MMs have been keeping this at high levels for the end of the month (look up window dressing). May well see some big drops after options have expired going into this wkend.I am expecting <160 next week."
Citron will reappear with newinfo soon. Monday ?
Yet another day of steady slope rise followed by a flat-line the rest of the day. Everything appears to be programmed and premeditated with W. Tell the bots to take it to a certain level and then hold. Day after day.

"After Q3 results, we're moving Target (TGT) up a few notches on our list of potential Wayfair acquirers. They're getting absolutely killed by Amazon and Walmart. It's going to be a great Holiday season for the ""haves"", meanwhile TGT already warned the street about coal filled stockings. Oh my!"
Great day and Congrats to all of us shorts!!!
STRONG SELL!!! $60 Friday!!! Wayfair customers are all dying of coronavirus￼
Hello .... Where are all the smart ones that said I couldn’t read a chart ?? Lol . Folks this might go up again and when it does I will short it again. This model will not work... Amazon will eat them alive. Many years in the business and they are losing money like crazy.
well guys. Unfortunately we will not be able to see many more down days in w like what we have been seeing. Will still be volatile and good stock to play on any up days. If we see them.
"OK, I just cut the rest of my long here. It's been a helluva ride, but risk is just way too much at these levels - I am most worried that with news after hours/over the weekend, we might see an overdue re-rating (as happened with slack), which could see it drop double digit percentages and just can't risk that. Have to admit, I wasn't seeing this break 170, let alone 200!"
W reached a new All Time High at 102.87
"So W announced a few weeks ago that sales shot up due to people staying at home and idling away the hours shopping on their website. Surely when the US opens up again, it follows that sales should plummet as people can once again spend their hard earned graft on $5 coffees and browse through actual physical stores while they socialize with other humans."
Shorts are out next move is up sharply on short squeeze.
TIMBER!!!!!
This has to be the biggest joke in the market. They won't make a profit they cannot figure it out. PT $95
"Sure hope you shorted that pop, like I told you this morning....another easy call..."
"We are probably in the old pay any price for a company that is not going bankrupt. That was the 1999, internet bubble playbook that is once again playing out. Wayfair is leading the bubble parade."
It's sell Double digits are coming.
tax break= more money for rug and sofa
"Got to write some more puts. If it keeps climbing, I can sell some calls."
Dumbest market ever near profitless companies trading 10 and 20 billion market caps left and right. Insane bubble. Must be nice to be an officer of one these companies getting free shares printing millions from options while us shorts drown in our own tears and drool. When W hit 45 on way down I thought finally the market has gotten real. But now the absurdity bubble stocks are back even dumber than before.
"Here is consumer affairs reviews, oops, not so good.https://www.consumeraffairs.com/online/wayfair.html"
"Insane valuation with no relationship to the reality of their business, which generates revenue but no profit. They have no cash, need additional funding from my perspective yet the stock has been climbing higher even on a big down day in the market like today. Remember this was a $27 dollar stock a few months ago. I expect it to revisit that price, the question is when?"
"FYI, Today WellsFargo has a $85 PT, previously it was $123Jeffries : $142 , $192 prevStifel N : $120, $150 prevJust to show you how WS crooks work the system. Inflating the price of the stock so muchwhile probably shorting it like crazy.Only Berenberg has a PT of $100 and SELL. I still feel this can go to $50 w/in 6 months and even BK in 2-3 years."
"More good news: Today, MKM Partners raises Wayfair target to $130"
"Come on, these conspiracy theories are ridiculous. Surely if someone wanted to traffic humans, there would be a much more obscured method than posting on huge retail sites."
Covered at 160.60 . Will short it again if it bounce like pumper Sam said .
"How was people's exprience with buying online from wayfair. Amazing I was expecting above average but most are 1 star and they within last month.I think they having trouble expanding at rapid rate. If you buying at such inflated prices, buy at your own risk. This is very expensive stock given entire furniture market was $114B in 2018 and this company mostly in that business already doing $16B (15%) and what even more important, It's not no.1 it's Amazon for online only and Walmart if you want to combine both world.https://www.consumeraffairs.com/online/wayfair.html?page=3#sort=recent&filter=none"
75 from top good lord screaming buy
"I believe yesterday's temporary spike up is totally related to the setting of the conversion priceof the convert. the conversion was based on the weighted average share price of yesterday's trading.The company bought put insurance as part of the offering. As soon as stock started dropping at theopen, the insurance kicked in to uphold the stock."
"Check out AT HOME (HOME)...This stock should be making above. They sell online small home furnishings and anything that sells online is now the future for sure. These virus is not going away anytime soon, but has also made people look at buying online for the future."
Same thing happened in early June. Up for no reason. Glad all my puts I sold will expire worthless.
Funny how STZ and CGC price per share go in opposite directions. The street thinks STZ over paid for a possible (with warrants exercised) CGC majority stake. CGC goes up to what STZ paid and will probably go over STZ price. STZ is sure to catch up with a 15 P/E and one percent plus dividend.
"Over bought, stimulus will be spent on inflated gas and food, not furniture"
A legitimate value for W is 1/10th of its current price...lol.
"Can't wait until earnings! ..got a felling this is going to tumble. will hold short going in! Dangerous, but I like that!"
such a low float.....thats why this moves the way it does.......
I'm looking at a pre-market price of $101.45 on volume of 338 shares LOLI hope that's a test sale for much lower prices!!!
"Shorts are going to lose their shorts, briefs, boxers, trunks and long underwear on this one."
"Here is a great tip, you should have bought calls when wayfair was at $30! Like I did, and ignored all the loser analysts that make 50k per year to tell you what to do when they are 90% wrong!Why do you bother listening to Cramer and analysts that need to get paid to tell you what to do! Keep analyzing details and let all this wealth pass you by! Should have, could have, sure.I can tell you what to buy"
amazing slowly climbing on a down day on no news.... SEC will be getting involved soon im sure. buying back shares after diluting them at all time highs then making price drop on downgrades to buy back at lower prices. I see some bankers and wayfair executives facing an investigation soon!!!
This is only being propped up by shorts at this point.
Sam is waiting to see what it does. Around hour before close he will tell us if he bought or sold short. Bwwwwaaaaaa
"today's decline is a shift for sure from the last month of pattern. however, with that said. probably $449.98 end of day on 60k volume"
"it's over,, its OVER ,,""""ITS OVER"""" !!Sings the BIG ""O"" !"
W- Cup and handle on the 1D chart? Anyone? ... it looks to me that it will snap upwards tomorrow.
Overstock will go to the moon now
Anyone guessing W earning?
"best stock ever! always up more than market on green days. and usually up on market red days. out of 125 trading days 105 days have been like this. technical strength is 100%, rsi index is 99%. STRONG BUY!!"
How many Amazon knock offs will survive? W is just another knock off.
Any news on Castle Gate? ( wayfairs 20 million sq. Ft warehouse distribution company)
Incredible short here... patience is needed.
hILLARY PHARTS
"Another one that is going to benefit from the lockdown, higher beta than AMZN ..."
Breaking news-wayfair buys BOEING and in deal with APPLE- New name is WAPPLE !! LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL.
Joel... you got your 45... now we are on our way to sub 40
Short-selling should be illegal. It destroys wealth and jobs.
Now back to 230
Any clue as to why this stock is in a freefall ?
To the tune of David: “only thing down on a green day!!!”
Wayfair PR has done a poor job at answering to these allegations. They are dooming share holders with their lack of addressing the issues before them. future is not looking so bright
Wayfair downgraded after the bell by Stifel. This will fall a lot Monday after that insane increase
i'm going to short W into the ground!! spoiled brats........ Their honeymoon is just about over.....
see you at 30s in 12-24 monthsdoom and gloom =)
how much profit has this company generated ? Lmfao
It will be $100 per share or higher by the reporting date of February 22d.
Rally to 280-285
Morning . Congrats to all the short sellers ! Cover today anyone ?

"wow what a pile of vomit that income statement is. the more they sell, the more they lose. you'd have to be a real world class dummy to invest in this piece of junk. #$%$ margins heavy SGA."
what happens to options if markets close. Rumors are Trump going to shut everything down for two weeks
Be careful long or short here. Deep state in control

still plenty of opportunity to short and make back money on this stock ... down is the trend
Time to mute the posters with a clear agenda. Starting with Eric. See ya.
"Pump at the open, this is toxic."
All the robin hood day traders buying up the over priced market. Shorting wayfair will be the biggest play for 2020
Hide in plain sight
Can it move back to 400?
Wayfair is going to need to sell some stocks to keep the company a float because cash is depleting. Cash flow is good but borrowing from the future is a disaster for shareholders.
"Something is wrong over here. 500,000 shares traded and up 6%?This stock is scary."
"Just bought 1,200 shares at $83. I am long for 100k and feel good about it. Ready to be attacked by all the haters of this company but I think they will eat up market share and be a beast in the future."
"OTSK$$$$$$$$$$$$ take ur money out of W while you can nothing absolutely nothing makes sense about W, you loose money, accumulate debt, negative press. straight up fraud"
bet we close between $155 to $158.50 but we could drop $10 in minutes
"GIFT OF GOD! markets up, W down. its not happening, by end of day W be up 7% to 195!"
Monday
How’s Waycoin doing today
Those 229s are looking real good right now. Thanks shorty.
Halted! News pending
Edwin it may or may not! You need to go with the trend! Why not follow it up and if you believe what you say and I might add I agree. Buy it on the way up and when it pulls back reverse your trade!
so why is this dog up so much today?
Am I reading this right? In Q4 W doubled the losses to get 39% revenue growth? And people think that’s good for a 28% pop in stock price? Can’t sustain those ratios forever.
"Possibly one of the worst earnings reports of any company this reporting season. Staggering operating losses, $166 million of negative free cash flow, rampant insider selling....what more could you ask for in an e-commerce stock? Does this company have a plan for generating positive free cash flow?"
This will drop soooo hard....question is which day in the next 10 days.
Wow ! Almost a million shares in less that an hour of trading.
200 tomorrow. then 250 by next week. then 315 the week after! sounds good. at this price retail is not buying only big funds.
"Wayfair insider selling continues with both Shah Niraj and Conine Steven selling 2,000 shares each on both Monday and today (6/4 and 6/6) for a total of 8,000 shares. Sold at 94.80 on Monday and 102.5 today. This follows the previous sale of 2,000 shares each on May 30th. No insider buying. Clearly they see this stock as overvalued."
Sister long story short! The shorts are forced to buy back causing the stock to go up!
$150 by year's end
W is down 12.54% to $96.46
"only things guaranteed in life is death, taxes, and wayfair going up!!! load up the trucks again!!"
I’M OUT!
can always tell the short squeeze back on when it climbs 4% a random morning (yesterday) when the market is down. that's how they keep getting everyone...toooo easy
"IN Q1 2020 THEY LOST MORE THAN HALF OF 2019 ENTIRE YEAR, THINK ABOUT THAT! BIGGEST DROP IS COMING"
Ecommerce tech bubble just popped see u sub 100
What do you think of our guyz doing edible furniture in partnership with BeyondMeat? Totally disrupt grocery industry as well and speed up their inevitable displacement / acquisition of AMZN?
going green
Saying they authorize a 700 million buyback of shares is complete deceit and manipulation. They announced this to drive the stock up again. THEY HAVE ZERO INTENTION TO BUY BACK SHARES.
"Now green, bottom in. W heading higher today before earnings. Better cover"
stay at home states now up to 15. Everywhere w has a major warehouse presence is shut down. If people thought it was hard to get furniture from w before. Wait and see what happens after being shut down for two weeks. I can not believe this pos was up today and looks like it will be up tomorrow as well. Oh well. I have time lol
"Yawn..... wonder how much I'll make today? Every day, same thing..."
"I assume there's nothing to these allegations, but some people will always believe them no matter how absurd. (If true, the company is done). W may gain some new sales from the ""publicity"" of this news, but it has definitely lost some other customers forever. It's been a good run, but I think Overstock will be a better investment over the next few quarters."
Another example of amateurs panicing. This is a massive mover like AMZN. It's model is the same and it is eating AMZNs lunch in the furniture category. Buffett always asks whether certain news headlines are really affeting the company. Selling furthiture to U.S border? Really? This is a fundamentally sound company that I purchase products from. Revenue growth is exceeding target. Stay strong.
"Wow, I’m so glad I closed my short yesterday. JFC...."
Looks like Wayfair is using Augmented Reality in a similar way to ImagineAR. ImagineAR are focused in the mobile AR niche and seem to have a growth story developing in this gigantic developing market
Almost ready to short again. Made huge money last time.
Any holding through earning ?
Did this company ever make a profit
https://giphy.com/gifs/nostalgia-basketball-Xb9q0u6s1fogE
$220 by Friday
LOL people really think W gonna go to zero cause of this news....uhhh news flash pre-market it's only down 1.9%
"If they were going to generate $1b/quarter in the future, why issue any debt? Not only are they issuing debt, they issued a convert, which is dilutive to shareholders."
"Insanely over bought, where are the profits? Gas will cost!"
"See how they jam it at the open to hunt trailing stops? Plenty of sellers, no so much on buyers."
I almost feel guilty making money of this every day.... ALMOST!... I feel for shorts.... I really do!
"Ok makes sense now! Bill Ruane has been buying all the way up! Selling 5,200,000 share for a profit of 900million ! Who will come in now and buy 5 million shares? Would not surprise me if he is in the process of shorting! If so could drop back to $65 a share."

We afford you the opportunity to seek a better Furniture Outlet to continue your line of work.Time to kick this company into the gutter(Wall street gutter); Time to Short this fox(sly dog in the forest), limit its movement, before finally preparing the taxidermist."
If Wayfair closes on the high....the shorts are toast. This has nothing to do with performance has to do with the boys with money and computers. Pot stocks are next and Bitcoin. Higher highs and higher lows!!!
Tequila gives you the courage to approach women at the bars. Tequila also gives you courage to average down and reach profits faster.
Very confused how put options are basically trading at same price as they were when this was 185 earlier today... major manipulation going on as usual
"The shavy, gravy baby is buying. Mafia style. $180 by Friday. Mark this post."
Stick a fork in this one...see you at $80
no volume today still down. that means tomorrow we can be up 10% on volume!
"No one with a brain would hold this through earnings, I think we go to $125 before earnings"
"SOLD!! $143.75...... picked up anther $1500 on the day trade .....every day between $2500 and $1500 on one stock.........what fun!! and so reliable and easy!! tom, you learning anything? you should be."
should drop to $266.50 by end of the week or beginning of next week.
"Dow breaks 30,000 first time ever and W drops $15 - what does that tell you -it’s over"
Up about 15% since yesterday on volcanic volume...Likely Sovereign Wealth Fund comin in size
"Sell, or ride to 300?"
This was an easy short at 180
"Hello Sam, Hope you and your family had a great Fourth and nice weekend. Yes. M holding on my short . Let me know when you decided to cover. Thanks."
"Jeff Bezos busy dealing with divorce and politics while WAYFAIR is eating his lunch!! W taking market share by the Billions each Quarter from amzn, and all the top retailers!!....amzn is too big now........no real growth in retail......WAYFAIR growing like a weed.....and so is the stock!! going to go up again today!"
W is fighting the market but can't stop its downward trend
"Bears will be tested this am. Those who feel the heat will capitulate. After enough capitulation, the market maker will let the air out of the squeeze."
Nice to see some sanity return to this dog.
Love it how simple it moves $20 per day. Tesla moves $80 per day. Everyone getting rich $AMZN $TSLA $CMG $LULU $W $OKTA $SHOP
BIG money taking HUGE positions in W ! volume is incredible ...... buffet must be buying!
Another day outperforming almost everything on volcanic volume...True hedge funders buying in size
"Still too expensive,waiting for single digit"
Any one noticed that J.P. Morgan sold 2.3 m shares
"Due to an analyst upgrade, robinhood folks buying $5 above the closing print. "
"From Sitejabber1.95 starsWayfair has a consumer rating of 1.95 stars indicating that most consumers are generally dissatisfied with their purchases. Wayfair also ranks 132nd among Furniture sites. The most common issues with Wayfair are around customer service, which is not as good as expected by some customers"
BYND had $87 million in sales last year..... lost $30 million. Its valued at $5 BILLION and trades at $104.... it IPO'd first of may for around $26... Wayfair is terribly undervalued when compared to BYND! Wayfair only valued at $13 BILLION??? clearly Wall Street manipulation.......... ill call the SEC first thing Monday morning.
I see a lot of advertisements on TV and internet I am sure it costs them a lot of$$. If W business is good business then Amazon would have manipulate it. I see this company going out of business at some point in the future. Just an opinion
"How is this going to react with cases spiking in so many states?My guess is the market is going to have a bit of a freak out next week due to the above fact.Will this get dragged down with a huge sell off or will talking heads say ""More stay at home is good for W""?...even though if the economy is in a ditch, a ""L"" recovery...no one is buying a couch.There could be a substantial pullback coming.Good Luck."
It was always Kabuki. Now crowds heading towards exit? A little late.
Man what kind of id... bought my shorts at 180? Easy money
"Important point to anyone who wants to go long..... ask anyone in the manufacturing or i porting business what happened the last 10 days in terms of the cost of their credit insurance for Wayfair receivables..... most longs here are momentum players, nostalgic investors (“it will do back up since it went down so much”) or some type of chartists.... their core business has been exposed for what it is.... this destruction of value is a record-breaker in this industry"
looks like analysts are razing target price and then selling
I have never seen a stock with a negative book value have a triple digit valuation. I ran a business. Only Amazon and Tesla are or were allowed to operate at such a loss. Amazon was first mover so they got a pass. Tesla same thing. Don't understand this price. Apparently the insiders don't either. Look out below.
@David what is a price covert?
Smart money sells now.
UP IN ALL THE CALLS I BOUGHT THIS MORNING!! BWHAHAHA. .......bought 45 contracts.....was saving some powder....
Due to the shameful sex trafficking scandal I have formally downgraded this to SELL with a new price target of $3
W could tumble ... per Barron
guys long buying have come toa alt ---look for a retracement to $120
Spread is only a penny between bids / asks No more buying / shorted covering.This baby will crash today .imo
Wayfair needs a 61% annual growth rate to reach breakeven in 2022! Good luck with that
The big question: Will they be able to keep it up? Doubtful.
"Oh my God! This bubble hasn't popped yet? Wow. Went to sleep, woke up, and it was 1999."
@Sam are you holding TSLA ?
"Low of the day is in......just make money now....meanwhile shorts are covering, and insiders are laughing."
"oh look at the money I have soooo much I'm letting it rain. boo yaaaa ... I shorted at just the right time in yhe 150s and bought half back now waiting for a further drop. this stock is a joke, but don't get scammed by fund managers they may find a way to drive price back up again."
Hey guys - Lumberg here -- Wasss Happening? Do you want to be the person wearing the bare minimum amount of flair? I'd rather be WAYFLAIR. That'd be GREAT.
The outperformance today? Stunning. The volume? AMAZING!!!
They are growing so fast they can't make money
"3 things continue happening. 1) Volume dries up, stock drops and people chase it short. Short Squeeze activate. 2) Manipulation here to cash out convertible bonds and insiders above $230 option. 3) Euphoria/frenzy of retail investors chasing the same names over again for ""easy money"" in this bubble. they didn't learn anything from last Thursday-Tuesday. They keep buy the dip mentality"
$118 or lower today ? Thumb up if yes .
"Charts pointing to 416, no resistance until 367."
"WANG.......Wayfair, Appl, Nflx, Goog. Enough said....."
"First 30 minutes 900k shares traded next 30 minutes only 300k shares traded, selling was done now it will be small bids and asks and slowly creeping back up."
My posts keep getting deleted LOL how convenient... the employee couldn’t explain why they were so heavy and always in rush orders... they even financed kids
Back in 227. GLTA
BYND going to pass W up in market cap by end of week.
downgrade to strong sell https://imgur.com/wz2Ko0X
The narrative is deeper losses and decelerating revenue growth. We should add to this exploding unemployment.
Any more news about upcoming Wayfair purchase of Pier 1?
Ring the cash register this am
"Don’t fight the trends. Huge strength in e-commerce and home improvement/decor this quarter. Doesn’t matter if they’ve never been profitable in the past. If they are in the black this Q, this should run."
Upside surprise in Q1 and forecast will be for positive EBITA in Q3! They are seeing 40% increase in sales!! That's massive. Add that this virus will putting most retail furniture out of business.
Longs will be sucked In Again - forgetting that pretty much all furniture retailers have opened up aggressively - Longs think you can only buy furniture ( disposable furniture ) on line from W and no one else exists
This reminds me of the hype with TSLA to almost $1000 a share. I stayed strong and got my puts in order then and will do so again here
fair value is in the $140-160 range
insiders dumping shares the last few days.. how is this even legal???? isnt there a Trading Window which only opens after earnings are reported? crazy that many people are gonna get burnt for buying in 130's while the CFO and other insiders continues to dump shares.

"Can Not, Will Not go down!"
Quick make excuses why it's down analysts. More competition ..lol look at EV competition heating up and stocks only go up. Short to 220 long term its going to 60.
"This will be 250 next week, get ready to see waifair in action!"
One thing I have learned about this thing is when it goes down it goes down
"nothing justifies this valuation, checked all share rose over 20% in last month $w is only with negative marrit. btw, Lorraine is not new to their campaign. it will start coming down in this week, check its volume weighted price history"
"Thanks guys sold $80 call , nice day today"
Pedo central
Shady Old Lady Clinton is long.
"""way fair gimme just wat i need, i see this sock plunging to a seed"""
Can anyone name a more stupidly overvalued stock than Wayfair?
Wayfair reached an all time high at 184.43
"Up 8% on low vol, just wow"
"So if W beats by $.10 on earnings estimate of -1.60, is that considered a success??"
"TOM, did you short HD ?"
"TTD on fire again today!!! its even better than W..... TTD makes money, not that making money is important.....lol"
buy the dip!! you know wayfair!! going green again..
So what are our 50K analysts saying today? sell ? They might be right; since they have been saying Sell since the stock was at $25. Thanks Cramer and Motley and 50K analysts for making this the best stock rebound ever
"Sent this email to every happy analysts who are in love with Wayfair. Did some homework for them:I am scratching my head by some of your optimism on Wayfair (W). Given whole industry sectors, not just companies, are being obliterated by just the announcement or speculation of Amazon entering their space - perhaps you could explain your optimism for Wayfair through your reports, despite clear writing on the wall that Amazon is very much working on it!

This is really great. Most people want to change up their home accents every few weeks and especially during the pandemic everyone will want to do it more because they will get bored. This is probably worth a lot more because people will be buying with their stimul money when they want to change up how the house looks during a lockdown.
Someone bought 350 shares at 189 this AM Benjo was that you?
Bought at 66 in Feb. Sold a few weeks after sales tax issue at 120.00. Don't think W will be Amazon of home furnishings
at least $150 by year's end
I don’t understand why stupid bears are relentlessly abusing this stock and also let the qanon dogs after it. It is a strong company with great fundamentals. Many great companies did not make a profit in their early years to focus on growth. And Wayfair has grown revenue like crazy. With the COVID landfall if you still this this is not a great stock then please see gfys.
Will be interesting today. Any suggestions?
The worse the economy and tensions with China the more this bankrupt stock goes up. LOL
timber!
"Great ER report, and the stock is getting hammered again."
seen this on blue apron. when the shorts are wiped out this falls really hard. then it floats around aimlessly for weeks until this virus ends
Can they retract opening that new store idea?? Call it Fake news??
"This price action is SO dodgy - the SEC should be all over them! They pump the price up, squeeze out shorts, then begin slow selling - you can see they turned on the sell algo at the top, forming that almost perfect slow downtrend."
No reason Thursday became No Reason Friday became No Reason Tuesday. I'm getting whiplash here.
Then raking in $$$ early last week Math Professor told me to buy UVXY. Did 2000 shares. Up 60K in 8 days cheers.
"New 52 week high! Crazy market...Reminds me of the old joke...Hey, Bud, you sell each widget at a loss...how do you expect to stay in business? I'll make it up in VOLUME. that's Wayfair!"
Lol I told you never fight the trend!
$200 / share before blow-out earnings. Mark this post.
Lol motely fool saying the 12% jump is because of the 4th. Idiots. It’s bc of market manipulation of a low float stock
"On 10/22/20, the CFO sold another 1500 shares from $266-$270..."
Anyone shorts W at this level ? Still holding my short position.
"For a customer review below, it sounded that Wayfiar was playing a game to keep billing one item for numerous times to claim their revenue. Although W would eventually refund customer (I hope), is this one of their tricks to get high revenue? I suspect W would never return money to a careless customers who never pay attention to their credit card bills or not act proactively. https://www.consumeraffairs.com/online/wayfair.html?#sort=recent&filter=none:Rated with 1 starRachael of West Lafayette, IN Verified ReviewerOriginal review: May 15, 2020I placed an order for a customized computer chair on April 16th, 2020. They kept tagging my account for almost 300 every week saying, ""Don't worry. It will drop off in two to three business days,"" and that they will keep tagging the account every week til it's shipped, but my bank keeps them pending for ten days, so I asked them to just take it and stop tagging my account, the chair was due to be shipped yesterday, and the website kept saying it was in the process of being shipped. I looked at the website again today and it said it was on back order! With an estimated delivery date of July 9th, 2020. So now I'm on hold waiting to speak to someone, getting the same recording as everyone else, 25 or more mins. It's been 40 mins already. First time ordering from this place and the last time as well. I won't see that refund for 2 weeks almost. Highly disappointed because this was for my husband's birthday which was yesterday. Do not order from here!"
Do not cover till $65 SELLLLLLLLLL
"If you want to decide if $4.4B/q sale ( Let's say $18B/year) sale is peak or not.You have to look at TAM. Total furniture sale in USA was $114B in 2019. With so many physical business having issues, don't expect motel/restaurant upgrade their furniture for next 2 year atleast.Now Wayfair wasn't no.1 according to Overstock. Amazon was. Walmart and Target combine make up half as much as wayfair.So if Amazon selling $20B, Wayfair $18B, Walmart/Target $12B+ total between three is $50B or almost 50% of TAM."
The Trend is your friend! 100% of the time! Greed will come back to bite you!

"I don't know, it's run by a federal reserve guy, if one of these funds sell he probably has the ability to burn them to the ground, plus no better place to wash some big money around between friends."
My broker cannot find me anymore shares of W to short. Will be a lot of in the money call writers forced to buy.
i smell bk
This will be Valeant Pharmaceutical 2.0 once news coverage begins.
"Even if the human trafficking isn’t entirely true, once this information spreads, this stock will TANK. Gotta take profits while ya can right?"
Poor shorts just didn’t listen to me. $100 by month end now looks likely.
Way on down. Hehe. Love it
"Got in at $75. Company still has great fundamentals and chart supports resistance at 75. After all, they DID beat analyst estimates for revenue. This should rebound to 80s between by end of next week."
Who is manipulating this useless and never been profitable stock? I guess this is the one to short because it makes ZERO sense.
"There is a Motley Fool's article today that recommends a sell at this point.I will add m two bits as well: According to the charts, the slight increase in price is driven by a decreasing volume. In other words, there is a tepid demand for the stock at this price.Here's a paragraph from MarketWatchThe issue for Wayfair has long been, and continues to be, how to make money. The company has been criticized, among other things, for spending too much on advertising to acquire new customers on the internet. Wayfair has yet to report a profit, and its quarterly losses continue to widen. The Motley Fool article headlined: If You Own Wayfair Stock, It's Time To Sellhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/W?p=W&.tsrc=fin-srchI have a short for good reason. I expect W to hit at least $135 to close the gap. The extreme runup is not justified - perhaps sometime in thee future it may rise again."
funny because even Amazon is down today. So Wayfair benefits in lockdown but not Amazon I see
i do not have a good feeling about this stock. bought 100 yesterday morning. any thoughts?
COO dumping shares hand over fist. Prob bullish right? I’m sure he doesn’t have the inside info the dopey bubble longs have?
Here comes another dip forbyou to buy Sam
"Will buy AMZN within 18 months...Likely all cash, maybe a little stock...Mark this post..."
You shorts might need a demand- supply lesson ASAP.
surprised this isn't down Waymore today
"No reason for any increase in stock price, unless the company is making revenue gains in the last 1.5 months. Since tariffs were reducing company sales and inventory moment there should not be an increase in share prices as earnings have dropped like pebbles. Wall street is self inflating the prices to maintain a stable P/E before announcements, then cash in as revisions come weigh down in the next 3 weeks.Another ponzi scheme of sorts in the mix here, nothing to see but mirrors and smoke!"
"150 by the end of the month, 500 by the end of the year, long term target, 1500, then a slight pullback before it heads to 2000."
Smart money Sell’s the up - as good as It gets - future next quarter gets lower due to more stores open
Stocks have a tendency to go back to their highs of the previous years. So say the hedge funds. W is on a directional path higher with higher lows and higher highs. This is a perfect volatility storm.W to $160? Huh?
only $200 more to go to reach fair value
"Look at Canadian weed stock charts and you'll probably see this thing's future. Pure hype. -$11 EPS, they're never going to make a profit."
Hey guys love watching W run everyday also love Etsy and amazon. This is awesome . Please get on Overstock also before too late it’s having same movement as Etsy and W before blastoff. Just friendly advice to fellow longs looking to make an honest . AllThe best.
Short right now @ 68
"From next Monday every container they will release at any USA port from China will pay 10% extra , means price will increase accordingly ."
Sam. Just broke through your $145 support .
people are not going back to stores even after pandemic. Wayfair is so convinient . it dips to 240 and back to 290s . 4 times I rode this 
"If selling is good for Niraj it's good enough for me. Thanks Niraj for the ride! I'm out!CEO of Wayfair Inc (NYSE:W) Niraj Shah sold 31,000 shares of W on 03/04/2019 at an average price of $165.74 a share. The total sale was $5.1 million."
"Wayfair wasn't doing well before the virus, so what's the reason it will do better once this virus splurge ends? Economy will be half as good as before if we are lucky."
"For those who care, the stock is 33.7% short. So a short squeeze is underway!"
"at home just announced fantastic q3 numbers today, which are $ not spent online. Same with bed bath. While home furnishings demand still high will be nothing like q2's online demand"
Come on over to Overstock. We welcome you with open arms!
Just wait for paypal earnings
"wow, hit the new all time high after the wall street journal article and 3 follow up's. let's recap, the only up side story is $107 PT and not possible walmart and target acquistions. i don't get how cash buffer in the company can be bad news for shorts. after all, everytime a company having a convertible bond offer, stock price always goes down due to dilution. let me call cramer and ask for his advise. good luck all."
Massively overvalued vs ostk
"#$%$uming they are not guilty however, damage already done as home shoppers don?t want to be linked with such a company and its negative publicity. Big down day looming"
Would not be surprised if W is at 149 or 169 at the end of the day!
"buckle up shorts!! going to be another rough day....W should get to $170 today......$250 end of March!......$350 by end of year, as long as they keep losing money on every sale.....WS just loves that!"
earnings before or after the bell
Amazing a stock that can lose so much money like this and go up 30%. I don't understand how but congrats longs...
Some good slippage today even when the market was up. Another red day in the overall market and this slides much lower. Think back to last week Friday. And please dont listen to the paper tradn clown Sam. Hes been buying every dip since 172 and says hes still up. Lol. He was also short at 110 when it gapped up. Good thing he still lives at home and trades from his moms acct.
Action To Take : Be alert to manipulation when making investing decisions. The best way to protect yourself from the manipulators is to invest for the long term.
no position but does this company sell furniture? Just checking.....
What’s revisiting at sp 7.15 today? Strange if you look at the chart as if it’s hand made!
"WHO'S FASTER DUMPING OR SHORTING DOWN TO UNDER 100 BY FRIDAY, NOTHING GOES UP LIKE WAYFAIR NOT EVEN BITCOIN, MOTHER OF BUBBLE"
...and a very predictable buy the dip opportunity right now.
Looks like the party for W long is over today . No profit !
"Hey all you naysayers, analyst lovers, Cramer followers, metrics calculating traders! Why are you knowledgeable traders so angry? Keep listing to your 50k per year professional analysts! They don’t make money! That’s why they are analysts!So many angry shorts here, you have to trade with your feelings! Been saying it since $28! And you keep shorting! You know who you are:)Buying my Ferrari tomorrow and getting “Wayfair” as my plate:):):) love Wayfair!Keep saying it boys, it’s a scam, the metrics don’t make sense, Cramer and analyst say sell!, its overpriced, insiders are selling, overvalued , big correction coming, manipulated etc.etc.I think I’m buying the red one !:) thanks Wayfair, $100 options at .60! Today $90, it’s a great month!"
it's Warren Buffett genius dean
a quick look on twitter shows they are not even able to deliver on existing orders pre-corona
"i thought 100 is tops but it probably goes to 110. if you are short this, you will go broke first before wayfair will go broke. this much i can tell by trading. only the strong will benefit from shorting this here."
anyone with a job at wayfair should start looking. it will eventually go bankrupt
Up $30 tomorrow cause if trump winning
what a comeback!! every day!! sure hope you bought the $3.50 dip!! what a gift!! ...made money already!
Wayfair is down 6.91% to 274.19
If W goes to 180 tomorrow I will sell 2022 in the money calls
"this is crazy, even shopify is in red today, W and OSTK are the most manipulated stocks in the market. It won't last and will only go down from here."
thx for short at 324
"SHOP is a completely different business to Wayfair. Shopify is more like SAP - an inventory, ordering, product placement entity that handles online stuff for other companies. I don't think they actually resell any product."
Shorted this morning .Thanks for the upgraded.
This stocked moved from all time low of $23 to $180 in 2 months insane
"Looks like Bullish trend..No position, but deciding."
"Going much higher. Home furniture, furnishings demand rising. Check HOME from 1 to 19 in 3 months."
50s... CEO thanks you all for the free money.
Sell Wayfair and buy weight watchers WTW
"Market tanking, W green..... smart money running to the safety of wayfair.... trade wars means NOTHING to wayfair! Recession means NOTHING! More investors will run to wayfair.... it's unstoppable."
"BYND up another $16 today !!! another W in the making! you cant go wrong buying these stocks!! impossible to lose money on either one of them!! they're both safety stocks and recession proof..... both undervalued, too!!! nows the time to load up... the runs are just getting started!"
This company has accounts payable which will completely wipe out their entire cash position. Who is going to bail them out? They don’t have 30 days of disaster funds set aside.
hello?? where'd all the shorts run off to?? lmao...
I bought and sold this s3veral time...my other crazy gain. PLNT bought at 19 when jo8ned the club...medicare supplemental pays 10.00 mo fee. Now 75.00 PPS @ least has PE of 101. :) my Q wh6 just like W
"BBC quickly defends Wayfair by saying, ""Some said that after they put stock-keeping unit (SKU) numbers of specific Wayfair products into Yandex - a major Russian search engine - images of young women would appear in the search results.That claim was true, but was down to a glitch in the search engine."" So it's a glitch with a search engine and it's a glitch that there are products being sold for 20k dollars. Remarkable that this is considered one ginormous coincidence"
Forward PE is still over 120 based on a yearly average of last quarter's blowout numbers. Wake up people....this stock is worth $100 tops....and that is with everything going well for next 24 months.
To the moon!!!! In a Tesla with Wayfair furniture in tow!!!!
Another stock I Bought. PLNT of 10.00 membership and PE of 101...think Ill sell both...makes no sense.
"took some profits !! had too!! made too much too fast!! TOM, did you?"
Why buy this for $12 billion market cap when i can own Macys for $11 billion?
It has to bounce up sometime. V's are more likely than all day down moves.
Sell now before it goes lowwr... the market will turn RED by 3:00pm.
12 pct? U gotta be kidding me. Spce went up 7 Oct and gave it back today. Dont sweat it guys.
This is nothing more than ETF and pension fund buying. Nobody in their right mind would put their life savings into this. This company bleeds money advertising.
Why down in an up market
load up the trucks!! millennials showed their colors...... they will protest themselves out of a job....which is probably what they want anyway....they hate work!
"This people don't having anything to sell. If you look at almost any category, half of the SKUs have been out of stock for more than couple of months now."
$135 is a buy zone... not here... give it a few weeks or months...
did they announce a share bug buyback and a one time special dividend of$5 per share. plus plans to go private? wow. cant find a better business than online furniture store in this environment.
"I think there may be some confusion. Wayfair lost $85 million more than a year ago. Again, the more Wayfair sells the more they lose, month in and month out."
"Shorts are going to lose their shorts, boxers, briefs, trunks and long underwear on this one."
"Low quality Chinese junk that can be found at budget retailers under less ""creative"" names. Only a matter of time until the fork will be plunged into this one"
BIGC is the software provider to support W operation!
After ER is this stock expected to go to 160 ??
Below 100 is a strong buy
"Short 5,300 shares and feeling good about it! Bought some calls to hedge and now I'll wait for my payday!"
Gone short again today. Looking for some fast money on Monday.
saw ANDREW LEFT working the drive thru at chicken lickin today.......lmao...he should have called me before he shorted..
Andrew left was recently interviewed about his short on wayfair. He just laughed and said he's not worried a bit and keeps shorting more. He said he has Jeff Bezos working on his side and entering the market.
Higher market cap. than Ford.
Eventually their sales will go back to usual when life gets back to normal from covid19. Might be a while tho.
This thing is going to pull an Amazon ... up like 8% before earnings ... scaring shorts and inducing fomo ... then down like more than 10% after earnings.
We love Wayfair but we love profits even more so trimmed our position today after this spectacular move. Sold 30% of core holding @ $70. Cost basis $20.25 purchased in Q4 '15
i don't see the problems go away anytime soon... will be sub 40 with more chaotic trading days
Nice going back up to those premium shorting prices im excited!
be careful shorting. look at Shopify. loss before pandemic was EST 320million for 2020. market cap now 80 BILLION on 2B sales. a lot of bailout FED money going long to crush shorts no matter how illogical the stock price. it is criminal manipulation in this fixed market
"short interest is down, if someone had hopes for another squeeze ... down 60 from it's high that seems like a long-shot https://fintel.io/ss/us/w"
"Anyone shop Wayfair against Amazon?I checked a few items and found Amazon wasgenerally 10-12% less.So, if Wayfair charges more, why have they been losing money?"
Green in a sea of red...Yet again!!! TWSH (True Wall Street Hitters) know massive cash flow when they see it
"TOM, your TTD taking a massive hit today!!! I just bought back a couple hundred shares at $195....."
surprised it is holding up. Going to be harder to borrow later in the year with the economy on a down turn. I do not care how much money the banks have.
https://www.trustpilot.com/review/wayfair.comCustomer service ultimately prevails. Not to mention this company loses more money the more it sells. House of cards.
"lmao....told you to buy the dip again, didn't I?....easy call....same pattern every day.....yawn....picked up a few more bucks.."
"As Warren Buffet would say:""Opportunities come infrequently. When it rains gold, put out the bucket, not the thimble.""""Widespread fear is your friend as an investor because it serves up bargain purchases.""""Whether we're talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down.""""We simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.""""The best thing that happens to us is when a great company gets into temporary trouble...We want to buy them when they're on the operating table."""
Low volume... and shorts continue to pile up !! Tomorrow the decline starts and next week it crashes again. It’s gone up on no news.
Make $$ OMG W May 7th 410 call sell it now 110 free $$$$$
shorts covering propping it back up.
"$20B market cap, can't make money and has no cash. WINNER!!!"
remember the day a few months ago when Wayfair actually went down??? that was something! been rocketing uo ever since!! love it!
"did the liberals go back to work today? So funny that they claim to want to help illegals, yet want them to sleep on cement. Do liberals have any brain cells at all? They should be proud to help those people with a new, clean, comfortable mattress."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/citrons-andrew-left-closes-wayfair-214354853.html
You know the stock was around 90 $100 for a long time before Covid where do you think it's going to end up￼ ??? See ya at 90 .. I will be there waiting fir you all
I think STOCK TRADER will get margin call soon. Brutal market.
Shorted 150 covered 140 in matter of minutes. Now 180 short is the new target
The area rug I viewed yesterday (didn't purchase) for $99 just showed up in my email for $29. The list price is $399. WOW is right!
The consensus of the 27 analysts covering W for 3rd quarter 2019 is a per share value of USD -2.09. lol
I checked out wayfair website. I would never buy anything on there. Way unfair and overpriced imo. Why buy stuff from a middleman ?
"FREE CASH FLOW Operating Cash Flow -196,818 84,861 33,634 62,814 135,121Capital Expenditure -271,742 -159,205 -100,451 -96,707 -44,648Free Cash Flow -468,560 -74,344 -66,817 -33,893 90,473Like all casino they have changed the dealer when players get HOT!Currently at -76% on shorts, trying to avoid the daily margin calls.Will definitely look at $125 for a pull out and re-entry at $125 shorts!"
"Looks like the mm is sitting on unreported transactions, trying to paint a picture."
"Sam, shorted more at 262.65"
"That price range looks crazy - 33.99 to 36,666.99 for shorts and a tshirt. Prices vary based on options. You know what the 36,666.99 option is!And we all know why the price contains 666!https://www.amazon.com/France-T-Shirt-Tracksuit-Quick-Drying-3XL-180-185cm/dp/B08C7NY5BW/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=Shirt&qid=1594899487&sr=8-2"
"Shorting is one heck of a hard way to make money LOLThis stock is in trouble, just SELL and be done with it. It's going DOWN!"
Had anyone covered yet ?
"Thanks for all your good info from R , Northern Trader , Playmakers , Henry Gondorff ."
What keeps their 380 million fund from running the price up today to $175 all to sell after market! SICK
Consumer buying power is falling. Showing lower lows and lower highs. Time to retrace.
insiders sell $3m in shares the day before earnings. LoL. BNP Paribas sells 63k shares yesterday. ubs sells 20k shares 7/31. no buyers to note above 5k shares
Haha... Would be nice to close just a wee bit below $125.
there is very nice article in financial times on $w wayfarers valuation
"Keep borrowing more and more to drop in the black hole in order to gain the market share. A lot of furniture companies already tried to do the same thing, they all ended up in BK court. I give W another 3 quarters it will come down like Grubhub."
Massive volume on the run to $200!!
Huge layoffs starting...their gonna buy furniture online??...they need to pay rent and buy food
"People going back to work and stores reopen with special low pricing, this has had it."
its up because of options expiring
Don’t short if u don’t have the firepower to handle the squeeze.
Wayfair and Grubhub should merge to become WayGrub and be the poster child for the instant gratification buyers remorse club. Others can join the club be prerequisite has to be the more revs you produce the more money you lose.
"In for 1000 share at, $39, in Jan '16. Out today, at $153 and change. It's been a good ride, but I'm taking the money and running. All in my ROTH, so it's tax-free, too! GLTA who continue to hold."
"wow, I thought this couldn't go down."
this is going to be dumped hard by the end of this month
i am still used to physical look and feel on furniture. i just can not see W's evaluation unless Target is buying it. good luck all!!
W reached a new All Time High at 101.19
"Follow the short float...this is tilray last year. It's obviously nothing more than a squeeze. So tempting to short this but it may have juice to $200 still. once the tide turns on this...it's a 60-70 dollar stock. As usual, the fall will end up being just as dramatic as the rise."
Now up 11.48 glad I waited to buy puts
Andrew Left should have called me before he blundered into this short....he could have saved himself a few hundred Million!!.....he's getting just KILLED!!...... I could have educated him on this company and how the stock trades ..
Joel lost some much money in 4 weeks saying it would go to zero.
"Today's chart looks like it's on its way to a shooting star candlestick, and the hourly trend looks very similar to 11/27. If the stock follows the same pattern, the next few days may be very bearish. The fundamentals of this company are not very good, IMO. also, on the last few major downturns, the stock bounced off the 50 dma (7/17, 9/17, and 10/25) We didn't quite get there this time (yet), but we got close. I feel another strong downturn is imminent. Maybe not tomorrow, but soon."
"12 million share diluted @$230, 3 weeks ago for $3billion and stuffed It In their pockets,all suppressed when stock was $320-$340. Thats what they and the on the take analysts did"
A bunch of paper hands
W Equals CHINA
"Lmao..... Now loop capital raises target to $160. The pumping just doesn't end, like its orchestrated. One follows the other every 3 days or so. Bunch of no names just keep raising targets. That's all it needs with such a low float.....meanwhile , insiders keep selling."
this thing gonna be in the 70s at week end!!
R are you holding or short any W?
Market is down and this is up today ?
Online Sales on Black Friday up 23%!!!!!! Most sales on big ticket items like furniture. Monday will see a huge jump in Wayfair.
Prediction end of day price lol
"Empty bags for sale! Buy now, this offer won't last."
Two things working for W: crooks and corona. great combination - nothing can bring the stock down.
wayfair you got just what I need.... a overpriced stock in debt to make a fortune shorting lol
"It is behaving like LK, exactly like LK. Going up like crazy, getting Zacks ranking like LK got as well and then dump..after which all these rankings are useless"
"Hello Sam, Thanks for thinking of me. M on vacation. Yes . Lost some on W but made lots more on BYND . Your pattern is working so might follow it ."
Why this stock keep goin down?
I sure you guys bought that dip!! I did! dont see how you can lose????
"Oppenheimer rates W a buy with a $160 TP today. On March 01 2019, they raised W to $190 from $140. How did that work out for them over the year? W laid people off and dropped under $80 before Covid. On their Dec 5th note ahead of Q4 earnings, Oppenheimer also touted W growth and said they will be getting costs under control. How did that work out for them? W later reported a $330 million loss for the Q, more than triple the previous loss. The Oppenheimer track record is mud where W is concerned."
"Sold at 355, will buy back closer to 200"
"To those that were in pre 200s and rode this up good job, but you can't expect endless gains forever, now is probably a good time to profit take and waiting until this falls back down to earth...To those of you that bought at 220 today SMH"
SPOT and W just the two biggest bubbles in the market right now...
“Kodak effect” coming soon for a stock you owning!
You just have to wonder who is buying this here? You can see 3 and 4 shares traded at a time. It's insane .
Next one 270 and next Friday 210 and keep sell off until hit under 45$
will be bought out at 300 today or by monday. neeraj has the funding secured. hes not tweeting cuz illegal.
http://insiderbuyingselling.com/?t=W&submit=
Stock needed some support so Wedbush and Barrons stepped in. That saved my puts that I wrote from being in the money. :) A little higher and good for another short term short.
People talking about Wayfair buyout. Buy shares! $AMZN
Expecting another great week ?
Spending more money on advertisement... another bad sign. What happened to all the repeat customers? Guessing this will send the stock down further. It’s a cry for help.
"Don't worry, it'll pop back up before the EOD. Stocks don't go down... The FED will buy them up, we'll get more stimulus. Everything will be great again."
"look at that, just like cream rising to the top,"
Covered at 314. thanks
I just bought some puts.. Joel.. June 19 $170s
"Those who bought at $350 shouldn't complain; they ""suspended disbelief"". Talked themselves into it, analysts helped nudge along. No different than the furniture, looked good on line, when you receive it you realize it's prop furniture, not made to be used."
"Short squeeze, plain and simple. The public float is tiny and the stock is easily manipulated. This is why W is up 50% in under a month, after a terrible earnings report, and all on low volume.Wayfair has negative $123 million company wide asset value - and it is getting worse. W is truly a zombie company.Look at the insider trading reports. CEO, CFO and directors sell every share they get, week after week, for years now. They never, ever buy a single share, just sell the free ones they gifted themselves."
Cheapest ever!! They will be delivering furniture with drones to WeWork office space soon..I've heard
short squeeze is over... $150?
What falls should go back up. This time whoever done it will pay a double
stock repurchase...keep it going
W. Unsustainable biz model..6 mo 12 mo out will plunge again below 100.00. Just matter of time.
"Sleep tight shorts, tomorrow will be painful."
"im going to start buying the dips again, I guess.... this is gong up from here! Tom, I wish you had covered."
Let me understand; they lose more money than last year so the stock goes up?
shorts covering today? Or is it possible the buy back has a few million left to pump it up for share conversions
"Usually the day before earning report, both call and put options would up , today’s action very rare."
Short interest is just over 5 DTC ... lowest level in last 10 months
No question it will close green today....same pattern every day....sells off a little first thing then goes green and closes up. Only day it didn't was Supreme Court day...
"Wow, Was it something somebody said? 25 points in a day. Impressive, and looking a lot like last earnings chart."
Weird option volumes last Friday and Today
This will probably be in the 70s or 80s by close today. Way overvalued.
"You guys know how this game is played. Wayfair day on 9/23 - Raj will throw some interesting stats - xx number of repeat customers, yy number of new customers, record traffic etc.. and will move some of the sales into 4thQ by delaying the shipments so that delivery is on Oct 1. That way he will have excuse why rev expectations were not met in Q3. He already mentioned this in Q2 earning. Algos will push this to 350 and then it will be downhill from there. So, wait to short after Raj Shah schpeel later this month.."
I shorted from 194 all the way down to 150 and covered. But THEN I shorted again at 163. Any advice from more experienced shorts?
"So many decisions!!Buy a company like a Wayfair, loaded with debt and never ever thinks about making a profit and pay a fortune for it, or buy some solid profitable dividend paying company?? Tough choice that sooner or later dividends will be a the ""NEW"" thing!! Have a good safe weekend!"
Shorts are trying so hard and going to squeeze to 63
"When I left this morning my 305 puts I sold were underwater. When I came back the close was 308. Now I can sell some more covered puts. Or some naked calls if it goes up. Earnings should be volatile, like last time."
"Every attempt to go through $323 has failed so far. If in the unlikely chance it actually goes negative, alot of momentum money will pause."
k I'm short at 220.50
This is going to drop fast.
Were the sales due to people setting up offices to work fromhome?I know you cant hardly find a webcam right now
$130 by Friday
it is a wonderful day. been waiting for this day. See ya at 50 by years end
Massive support at $145 !! Impenetrable!!! ... can't be done....
"Hi Bagholders, are you really going to wait until your losses accumulate to the max. There is still time to sell and at least recover some money."
"i wonder what even matters fundamentally at these levels? let's say sales are up 120% and they earn $2+ in EPS in Q2, how do you justify the current valuation at $230?"
bounced off $152 twice now..... looks like thats going to hold... huge buyers came in at $152...
"This stock has been hit hard, and companies that are a internet based without anyone having to visit any store will succeed in any environment; not to mention this one!( Amazon, Wayfair, etsy, stitch fix,etc etc.) it should be back to 50% of what it was in a week or two, so at $75 min, and then upwards from there as the crisis subsides. By end of year, $125-135 easily.I’ve made a good living just on W options in past 4 years!"
BUY THE DIP!! just trying to help!
"Sam , Hope you had a nice weekend .Did you add more short share and price ? Thanks."
Did they announce the secondary offering yet. Dilution is the solution. The CEO’s need to get paid somehow. They haven’t turned a profit in 11 years
"4:1 stock split coming soon. Unlike AAPL, however, you won't get more W shares -- only shares worth 25% of the current price."
Don't short unless you have plenty of capital. Weak shorts squeezed today.
"Ouch, time to short and buy puts and sell calls"
"so now they are building a physical store to sell returned items.........................to reduce losses, not to make money"
This nightmare stock always bounces back. Complete joke.
"look at pinterest down 16% after hours, samething wider than expected loss!!! EXPECT SAME WITH WAYFAIR TOMORROW"
31 BILLION MARKET CAP FOR AN ONLINE FURNITURE COMPANY WITH 1000'S OF 1 STAR REVIEWS!
"JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers lowered the firm's price target on Wayfair to $200 from $237 and keeps an Underweight rating on the shares ahead of the company's Q3 results. The analyst expects COVID-19 ""to last longer resulting in a hangover into 2022."" He sees see ""moderating trends ahead"" for Wayfair. Horvers thinks Q2 represented ""peak profitability"" for the company, with near term risk on freight/shipping costs and declining profitability in 2021."
"The pickings for overvalued, highly leveraged, and never profitable is overwhelming. What to do, what to do.$uber $cvna $zm $w $bynd or maybe a bankrupt company like $chk or $htz"
WANG stocks all down this morning...
Selling some of my pre-IPO shares in BYND at these levels to add to this soon-to-be $10 Trillion company!!!!
Always remember all gaps get filled. In a downtrend this will test $130.
What did I say? Huge swing patterns. Count on it.
"its gonna squeeze up further, way too many people who don't sell puts or have the book to be short this"
Unless every shareholder buys from their website and revenues keep multiplying exponentially this stock is going to crash big time when it fails on revenue or hits plateau. It does however have a lot of room to go even higher.
"Pretty sad this stock only survived by hype, sucking in naive investors with dirty on the take analysts hype, bad fortune lockdowns of stores owners and employees , exploitation of off shore people, milking investors by diluting 12 million shares for only $230 to insiders only , US government sponsored cash relief ( that is now stopped ).Good luck with this piece of junk just like their returned and broken furniture. This should be nominated as biggest scam of 2020"
"how is it possible that a company that loses $ every year, albeit + rev, can fetch this type of mkt cap?? all they do is sell other people's stuff...no original products, no 3rd party mktplace, etc..."
"Volume across the board is very low. Wayfair may not hit 2 million shares vs. 5 million daily average. Just an observation, nothing to be concerned with."
"I thought it was a great short when it got to 105-107.. almost pulled the trigger when it got to 115. So, now we are somehow at 122+.. unbelievable. What to expect after ER --- 160 or 75...? Huge questionps: got puts when it was at 120.. a bit underwater now."
buying wayfair dips is like a license to steal!! money just flows in daily..... love this stock!
Crazy how the shorts are going nuts.
Wasn’t little Sammy pumping this stock like it was the greatest thing since sliced bread a few months ago? That’s when it was around $150-$170. Now it’s a great short opportunity at $113?
Look for a nice blow off tomorrow. Run it up early morn past 190 and then wham...the selling begins....waterfall as it ends the day around 170 to 172 range
"Goodness, what's going on here?"
my portfolio is 45% TESLA 45% WAYFAIR and 10% MUNI BONDS. i think this is a good balanced low risk portfolio with high growth potential what do you think
I held from 2016 to sept 2020 and then felt valuation got too high. PEG ratio has drifted down to near 2 and I do feel these guys execute well but can they make money? Should I buy back in or keep on sidelines? Thumbs up or thumbs down?
The rally is tired. Overvaluation is at an extreme. Look for a pullback to at least $170. We're entering the denial stage of investor emotions.
"Lots of vaccine talk-AstraZeneca talking like they have the cure- wonder what will this mean for Wayfair’s future sales once stores that are currently semi open, fully open up ???Everywhere"
"WOWWWWWWWW havnt looked at this stock in a while, what happened? They dont make money!!!!!!!!!!"
And people buying Kodak were called naive
Short covering has heped this stock so those who hold are getting greedy
Where is the Zacks article on this dilution statement???
The intelligence of longs on this board suggests a strong sell here.
Traders keep bidding it up.....this could go on for a long time....6 months ago the same thing happened.... meanwhile the managment keeps selling their shares Andy laughing all the way to the bank.....hence the class action lawsuits.
We dont care if the company making $ or not. Just ride the gain of the stock price.
I can’t believe people defend this. Makes me sick
Bankruptcy declared this Monday??
"“Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom downgraded Wayfair on Thursday, (Oct 22/20)concerned about supplier constraints and rising online shopping-cart abandonment rates. “"
175 is guaranteed.
"lol told you, they try to scare the shorts into closing, not happening"
low volume for earnings day
We are not far away from big drop! Hoping to see it soon
buying more puts. It came back a little which it does and will crater soon
"Don't get trapped. Market is selling big high flyer last 2-3 day. Analayst here trying to protect price by giving bullish commentry.There are few bearish analyst who said they will have record quarter 2 but they keeping rating lower due to sustainability concern, after earning suddenly have change of heart.It's like they didn't know this going to happen. Can they move this higher and higher :- Sure they can.But remember consumer behaviour get fully monitored by credit card data now and Big boys have to careful as soon proof come in those data that sell is not sustainable.We don't know if this is peak or we may have even higher price but I think everyone here know that they can't have more than 10% growth from this level in furniture because there are lot of people who buying mainly due to covid19 and review says very high % of user don't like their return policy and hardness they get for return."
They delight me!!!!
"Happy New Year to all! Following a spectacular 2017 in which Wayfair cemented its global leadership position as the go-to online destination for all things home, we believe the brand is evolving into a true juggernaut and plan to maintain our full position in 2018.After returning 130% gains to investors in 2017, we see continued momentum for Wayfair and its shares in the year ahead driven by ongoing market share gain both domestically and in Europe, continued investment in infrastructure and technologies that will drive awareness, adoption, and retention of new and existing consumers to the Wayfair brand. Domestically, both Castlegate and WDN achieved critical mass in 2017 and while continued investment in these back end components should continue this year, we predict it will decline significantly as a percentage of revenue/gross profit thus moving the company from cash flow positive to essentially break even domestically; a huge positive driver for continued share price acceleration.We also expect heavy investment this year in building out the European market which is tracking where Wayfair was domestically about two years ago. While this will impact the short-term profit outlook, the investment will further cement Wayfair as a true global brand with an ever-widening moat as it disrupts an entire industry.We maintain a STRONG BUY conviction on shares of Wayfair in 2018 and set a 12 month price target at $121, excluding the potential of being acquired.GL and GO WAYFAIR!!!"
W is down -6.27% to 78.69
"I hate it when the dow is down...W only goes up a little! of course, after yesterday, it needs to take a breather before the next leg up....all technicals are VERY BULLISH!!"
No buyers or sellers today... hmm.
another day like today and there will be plenty of margin calls.
tick tock to $153 in five days...truth hurts...enjoy baby
Hello Joel . M shorting W again . Summer is the slowest season and no one will buy furniture if the coronavirus still hang around .
"Zacks is still pumping this, but nobody is falling for it."
150 coming. Great stock
My friend who works for Wayfair says they can’t sell home office furniture quick enough. Sales are jumping massively. Watch out shorts!
Did I mention I got two coffee tables for free sonic they both arrived damaged
June 12th 160 PUT is going to be up big very soon!! I see it low 150s tomorrow followed by 140s early next week until it stabilizes. The volume and pattern is telling! Plus all the outside noise as well....I also loaded up on SRNE calls since news will be given any day now on its antibody cocktail. Who is with me??
Tell you once. ASAN. earnings are today. Good luck
Those who hold long/short position need to get out once before quarter results this month. Radical change either direction can be resulted For Sure.
$200 soon. Everyone wants to buy today. Will fly tomorrow for sure.Shorts better run for cover.
Wait for the first vaccine delivery. W is going to implode. Tell your mama and your friends.
"OTM puts with relatively short life, very expensive. They know it's a scam but won't let you profit."
Look at the 5 day chart. See a trend?
buy the dip!! just trying to help!
"Tom, Thanks on that TTD tip! ive been cleaning up trading it!! just dumped 500 shares for a nice profit ...up over $10 today! W looking good also....."
"In last 30 days, stock has gone from 85 to 115. What exactly changed, other than the pace at which they have been haemorrhaging the cash? To artificially boost sales they had way day and multiple clearance sales this quarter to sell stuff at a loss sacrificing bottom line because analysts don't give a hoot to the bottom line."
What a relief. The market never makes it easy. SELL.
Bolted at 140.00. Bought at 70.00. Nothing wrong with cash!
Wayfair could not make money last year..The Best Economic ever...loss B$We are heading to recession or depressionHow Wayfair going to survive?$0
I hate this stock so much.
"Shorts are back in the game, Etrade ''Could not Locate any Shares'' , riding this 6x4 lumber down the rabbit hole; Good Bye Wayfair."
Fake selling started to trap the shorts. Beware.
Short this.
Yes it makes a lot of sense that a retail stock who gets all its items from China would go up today... lol.
So one good quarter from one time event means a company is worth double? This is same company that was headed for the teens in March . Next year if no lockdown and less virus it could be 20’s again
driving PPS.....the Amazon affect. 2. Emotions and dreams....bought 17 weeks ago at 61.00 after furnishing a rental from W. No earnings since 2003.
Bleeding money fast. Competition from Amazon and others. I see stock less than 100 in a month
"Looking at the 5y chart, you can see exactly when President Trump took office"
@sam already up 2 bucks . Are you adding or wait today ?
Who thought it would be green today? More rotation out. Here hold these shares.
59.13+5.92 (+11.13%) Overstock following a long.At close: 4:00PM EDT60.44 +1.31 (2.22%)After hours: 6:30PM EDT
Green it is...!! Called it again....same pattern every day! Easy call.
Congrats to all of you who stayed short even during the run up to 190+ any experienced trader could see that this thing was going to start to fall and fall fast!
why this is going down? makes no sense.
It’s closing at around $127 to $129 today and next week back to $120.
Market tanking and w only down a few pennies!! Lmao.....going green soon!!
"""Game Changer"""
I cannot believe this stock was less than 22 bucks a few months ago... urgh!
What is the target price to cover?
"Considering to go long. Not because I believe it's long term but because too many short on stock. Short term they will continue do well and so until may be Q3, there isn't signifcant down side (Unless overall market tank in which case all will go down including my Shopify short so it should balance out nicely)"
Who else is shorting this week? Lmao
"this stock is an absurd share price and will be walked right back to $70s, freaking ridiculous"
Bought 100 strike puts one year out. Anyone else
Benjo you might think about selling your one share you own!
"If they miss big this thing can go down to $150/share or less after earnings. Releasing earnings on Election night is a big red flag imo. Stay at home stocks coming back to reality. Honestly they had a good couple good quarters on good demand but I dont think it will last to hold this valuation. BBBY has a $3B market cap on bigger revenue than W, that's a 10th of the price."
Wayfair: it isn’t true! Carry-on ￼
"Wayfair only books revenue once a product is delivered, so any COVID-19-related growth boost will begin in the fiscal second quarter, which started on April 1. The trends for that month have been head-turning, with sales jumping 90% in recent weeks, equating to $800 million of incremental revenue.My target is $340 in 2020. Frankly W will become a $1000 plus safe harbor stock like AMZN"
"Over 10 yrs of big losses - 1 quarter Cinderella - vaccines coming, tons of stores websites &reopening, returns will get calculated in this quarter- goes below $180"
There is zero interest in this company. No buyers or sellers. Just FOMO day traders.
Can't say I didn't warn ya......Stocks have a tendency to go back to their highs of the previous years. So say the hedge funds. W is on a directional path higher with higher lows and higher highs. This is a perfect volatility storm.
how long does this company in business? how long does it report negative earning? WS Ponzi is running the show.
Gotta play it safe i think its running out of steam. Cashed out. See ya guys!! Thanks wayfair great furniture selections!!
All Wall Street roars in at $145 !! Buyers fighting for shares..
Restructuring is the initiative to reduce cost and realign business needs for faster growth. The company reducing redundant cost headcount and in turn increasing more headcounts in areas that will produce higher revenues. This way over blown and will get a uptick and return quickly.
Wayfair Inc. has made it to S&P Global Market Intelligence’s list of “Most Vulnerable Public American Retailers”
"TOM, i'm thinking it should be a good day for us! ........ ALSO,I expect the markets to drop BIG after earnings season!..... i'm positioning for it !!"
Bunch of insider sales at prices below current levels. This is for the newbies out there. Just be careful and bet small.
Thank you thank you !!!! What a vacation Tom !!!
AMZN gets slaughtered barely missing on earnings and is investing in the future.W isn't anywhere near profitable and goes up. How is this?
Stock will stay strong today. Rest of week and next will tell the story. It's a bubble.
Wow is this thing manipulated...Amazing
Nice sold 155. Will I buy again for 5hird time at 90..
"Yessir we keep making money, keep analyzing and make comparisons. While people make money. Most companies on the market don’t make sense, that’s why analysts have a job."
Morning Sam . Are you shorting BYND ? No more short shares at TD Ameritrade . Hope W is bouncing back . Bought small amount on the dip.
"I was going to start counterfeiting money, but then I found wayfair!! it's much easier, and has no risk involved...."
funds are 85% long.......investors under 50 don't sell short or own gold ..................i guess they feel they need to lode the most ......because they have years ahead to earn money to then invest again .....................thats why 705 over 65 are still working .......it takes decades and you never get even ........there isnt any growth in america ....recession directly ahead
Wrong! Going up big the first hour!
Looks like the stock wants to pay todays put buyers.
W is the 8th wonder of the world!
extremely low volume. the big boy does not want to sell off yet.
This will POP big time as Short Float is 35.92% very high. Time to short this one
"no one is selling w at this price- the TICKER is being MANIPULATED , its false. will fix it tomw."
1/23/18:Stifel downgrade.
Let’s put it where it belongs guys
you know wayfair is short on cash when they start screwing their vendors nickel and dimeing them for every little expense we pulled our stuff off their site. too many other places to sell to.
The dummies buying are being used only help feed the 12 million shares dilution for $230 a month ago
W will be volatile today because of option coverings! Monday will open up at $152.50
Citron Andrew left already?
15 thumbs down yesterday when I posted insider sale news. Now what lol
"What say you today, Benjo? Going back to double digits like you said 2 weeks ago and then deleted?You might want to delete your post from yesterday saying that it will go to 500."
No signs of panic.YET!
Wow I was wrong. Thought volumes would increase by 30%. Wayfair just announced a massive 58% increase in revenue !!!!!!!!
"Here is a great tip. Go to wayfair. Save the image of the furniture you want.. Go to Google reverse image search.. Boooom.. Now you can buy the same thing on another site for 50 % off what Wayfair is charging. They sell overpriced , less than great quality furniture. You can find anything on their site for way less elsewhere."
Pre market pump and dump Bag holders that bought this week. 200+. Last chance to get your money back or cap out with small profit. Just saying
"Im very curious as to why it’s not following the market today, quite surprised."
"SELL !!!You could make an Xmas shopping argument, but Xmas doesn't last forever. SELL SELL SELL ......"
"We supply W and we have notice a considerable uptick in orders. W also recently allowed suppliers to pay to promote items, which we feel compelled to at the very least try. On the tariff front it is important to remember that the Wayfair market is extremely competitive for suppliers and it is driven by reviews and no supplier wants to raise prices and have other competitors catch up to their products. It would take a long time before suppliers decided to pass this on.On another not I realize shipping bulky items is not ideal, but a lot of products are actually soft goods that do not damage easily and judging from the prices our products are sold at there is in fact a good amount of margin for W.Lastly we have tried multiple online platforms, etsy, amazon, wayfair etc.. and nothing even comes close to the traction W gets. I understand the shorts positions but there is also a real possibility an Amazon or Walmart takes this out to stop the competition."
Wow There is a ton of Furniture store sales this weekend and great deals! The sleeping Giants have awaken. Bye bye W
"I bought a nice kitchen table from Wayfair coming from a third party warehouse in Alabama. First I was told it would take 2-3 weeks. Then I was advised that the table was out of stock and it would take 2-3 months. Then the table finally arrived at their Chicago warehouse, at which point I was notified that the table was damaged and that it would take another 2-3 weeks for a table from Alabama to arrive. This table was delivered by a 3rd party freight company to my house a few days ago and it is damaged in 2 places. So now Wayfair has to pick up this table and replace again at a 20% discount, plus they already gave me a free smaller table to get me through Thanksgiving. I just don't see how furniture sales are going to succeed over the internet unless through the likes of Amazon that has their own shipping and can somewhat control how harshly the package is handled. I am guessing based on my experience that Wayfair's losses will continue."
I'll buy at least another 300 shares Monday while it's still cheap...can't lose at these Fire sale sale prices. 5 falling days last week held it down...only gained a few bucks.
W is holding up well today . Should drop at least 5 or 6 dollars !
"Morgan Stanley the Big Boys set wayfair price at $60 , stay short, keep selling!!"
W is coming back strong. Shorts better run fast. $200 by end of year.
Today is Friday -- Expecting it to shoot up $20 out of nowhere again.
It will recover from the premarket. Sorry to say......growth was good. Low float...hedge funds will pick it up.
W- nuts. RH reports soon
"this manipulated scrap ran 10 dollars in 1 hour from low to high!SEC should investigate, thieves die sooner or later."
"Storage cabinets $14,000 , pillows$10,000, dilute 12 million more shares for $230 each , have Zacks promo to over $300, slop up $ 3 billion in cash , have Zacks shut up on the rip off but pump up still"
someone got bought in on a margin call this morning.
"Super high value stock. Loses $1 b a year in a highly capital intensive business, which is difficult to scale in a niche product with a signifcant amount of competition. Def poised for success as the economy tumbles."
W will close at 185 today
How all you shorts feel this week?
Overpriced
"This is a re-post from a couple days ago. I can't believe no one was discussing this.63,000 1-star reviews from out of 70,000 total (almost 90%) of customers complaining how horrible this company is?!!!!Thoughts?I think I found my next far out-of-the-money Put gamble."
"Up 3% on 20,000 in volume. Spread is over 1% always. This is one of the most manipulated stocks in the market."
There's the daily run up on nothing
"what a swing!!....lol....told you to buy the dip, didnt I??"
If the company is so good why they dilute 3 weeks ago at $50? This is absurd.
Undervalue... This will go to $200 soon. Buy
Wayfair is awesome! You can always find exactly what your looking for and it’s all online (no contact). Those are the two main reasons this is going to 220
"""You play to win the game!"" - Herm Edwards""You are in business to earn a profit"" Except for Wayfair."
Going back DOWN !
Ceo says are sales are way up but our loss will still be 7.3-7.8%. We are still working on path to profitability. We are borrowing money even though we do not see needing it. None of that makes any sense. They will have no excuse for not showing profitability improvement. I am going to let this run right up until earnings. Then I will short big time. Street is not going to keep giving them passes for losing at the same rate no matter how much their sales improve. Their model is their expense % will decrease as sales rise. Well guess what? It has only gotten worse. I hope it is $100+ by May 1.
BOOK VALUE LAUGHABLE $0.93 // BURNING $50+ MILLION PER QUARTER = ONE OF THE BIGGEST PONZI SCHEME BUBBLE FRAUD OUT THERE ... This Bankrupt fraud running out of Cash soon maybe thats why the brutal stock promotion to scare the shorts out of this radioactive scam so the criminal banksters and management can dump their worthless trash to them . BE CAREFUL GUYS BECAUSE MONSTER DILUTION OR BANKRUPT FILING IS AROUND THE CORNER .Good luck anyway .
W looks tired. May pull back to $170 in one sell off
Why isn't Zacks pumping this up? I need to write some more calls and need it to be more unreasonably priced.
"Once it hits 220, I’ll jump back in. Too easy"
down premarket with 1500 shares traded
"Yesterday trading gave us a high volume down day and a shooting star candlestick sitting on top of a near parabolic tight channel. Normally, this would indicate to me that we are at a near term peak and should play this to the downside with a tight stop. But this stock has been anything but normal. After the sharp rise yesterday on the buy in, the stock traded between 103.75 and 104.75. A seller appeared to be holding the 104.75 price level and won out near the close when the buyer left and the stock dropped to below 104. The recent buyer has been controlling this stock and may well continue to win out in the short run as there maybe more margin calls ahead. There are some deep pocked players trading this stock with more ammo than I have. Fun to watch, tough to trade."
"Stock manipulation at the highest level, when this house of cards collapses, it will be single digits in less than 30 days....been there...lost a fortune....learned my lessons....Just a warning......"
the speed up from 230 to 300 was so insanely quick and low volume that there is no support. The sad part is that several state pension funds invested in this at the highs. dopes
Shorting!!!!
Hope you guys buy 1 million puts
It could beat TSLA performance??This could be a big Momo player.
Where did banjo man go? He probably couldn’t handle the loss on his BA calls he shorted yesterday at $165.
wow from $25..unblievable
"Wayfair is garage , furnitures are cheaply made, customers won't return again after purchase short this pig"
Yawn. Easiest stock to predict
"market could be down 1,000 points and wayfair would still be up, cmon give me $170 and I'm rich!"
Hold folks don't sell we want to see 309$ today. This is 499$ stock.
$145 today
If you see a run up of 8% sell long term calls! Have enough to with stand short squeezes! As a matter of fact add to your position every 5% run up! No short term puts! The sharks need that to make money! To run it up long term they would have multi millions at risk. If you have 100K you can straddle to make tons!
Overpriced Stock! Goes to $120 by Friday.
Wow! W is killing us short today. May b we lost the battle today But will win the war later.
"All in... With the government support for the market, this will go to $400 and beyond. Watch out Amazon."
"I bought furniture from Wayfair. It's a hit or a miss. You can feel springs on a brand new couch with rather good reviews. You get what you pay for but usually if you pay less, you get much less. Cheap comes out expensive in the end."
282 today  340 tomorrow after short squeeze 
I wont be shorting again...yet
holding up so well!
Get your facts straight. They did not “drop”. They “missed” a consensus prediction on revenue only. They also are significantly up in every other measurement. This dip will be short lived.
Mikes mom got so happy this morning when Margin called. She thought he finally had a woman calling him
pixie dust makes the losses become less visible and the stock price go up. Nice illusion.
did the earnings come out? can't see anything on the news
"Started at High and finished at Low for 2 continue days, looks like someone manipulating the price and selling the stock. At the price level, it is good chance for this company to issue more stocks and get more cash in hand? They need more cash because they keep losing money every month."
"wayfair has been sending me emails trying to sell me their products, almost daily. They just just made mt answer for me. Spam mail for ""fake emails"", will never buy from them. I like Laura Ingraham and her show."
"I'm confused, some analysts reasoned W's price by predicted 90% QoQ growth in Q2, but online retailers had only +8% M/M in April... The numbers don't add up"
When is this thing gonna dump?
WHEW!! what a day.....been buying like crazy!! way oversold!! bought a ton of calls....some more stock ......my fingers are sore from buying!!!
Put 500% tariffs on China to make them pay! W goes to $1 yup one dollar
"Have no clue why it tanked today, but it's about time! Should be trading at $40."
Some of the shorts in this number could be looking a 400% plus losses. Lack of safe harbor stocks has made W a savings bank for Covid longs
"Just a reminder, W makes no profit and doesn't have a PE."
Lmao....I bought more on the dip and up on them already!! This is almost too easy! Bought some march 22 calls also!
This could be the best short of a lifetime.... the risk reward is worth it
buying options? Make sure you buy call not put. It is too high but will go higher.
Anybody here in since the beginning with cost basis of say 30? You are still doing great!
I probably won’t ever buy anything from them again and I also wonder how many employees will quit
Anyone Lucky enough cover at low 100 this morning?
"Piper's upgrade was stupid. OK, sales are boosted in April and May. What about the rest of the year? Does Piper downgrade the stock when other shopping venues open up? What happened is that Piper told its clients to buy W two days before the upgrade. Then when the upgrade hit, stock pops. Sell for an easy profit. Why this works is W is heavily shorted with low float.I see rinse and repeat in the future."
"I think W is worth shorting here. Trading looks bad, no support at all. Target is at least 65."
:) :) AT Home Groups drops 46% because of Chinese tariffs on home goods. W will be next though they have no earnings to drop. W will be back under 100.00 in short order.
ouch
"This Friday's options IV says ~12-14% price move.. So, it is 95 to 123 price range..I vote for $80."
No one is sitting at home facing an economic crisis and deciding to shop for non-essential home decor items. There is no read across from Amazon. Wayfair is not going to take share from brick and mortar only stores. The whole pie is just going to shrink.
"Wayfair is leading all the WANG stocks again today, nothing new there..."
20% revenue growth and never expected such a beat.
"26,000 shares traded already!! its a buying frenzy like ive never seen before!!"
Just a matter of time until a Citron or similar hits this company with a bear attack. Way over bought. Just check the 1 year chart. Crazy to buy here.
"These price swings are too wide. It’s nice to make profit on the volatility, but holy poopoo something is very wrong."
So funny it got pumped that far. next target- 46$.
"Here is an investment idea. A company that can provide furniture cheaper than any competitor can. The idea is that they, on average, sell stuff 10% cheaper than it cost to produce. How to do that? They just use investors money to pay for it. Obviously they lose money:https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/W/wayfair/net-incomeNormally they would run out of money BUT they just issue new stocks to pay for that.https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/W/wayfair/shares-outstandingSounds like a great company to invest in, then invest in Wayfair."
Now having a hard time going over $320. we will see if it very slowwly makes lower highs and lower lows

"People don't realize that Amazon is just more than selling stuffs. Clouds, Videos, etc...Wayfair will be just a furniture company. Can't see this kind of valuation. You can see how corrupt the whole system is. Big Ponzi on Wall Street."
"Market futures are dropping and Hopefully, W will see under 30 again."
Very pricy!!
THREE WORDS. NEGATIVE BOOK VALUE
Are you all overlooking the huge drop in gas price? Cheaper for wayfair to deliver right now and one of the only games in town if you want to buy furniture. Consumers are addicted and wayfaur has contactless shipping + testing their staff for covid.
They lost (-$1.35) in the 2Qtr and are expected to lose (-$2.07) in the 3rd Qtr... Wow that is exciting !!
Oh MONDAY! How much % down do you think it will open at? Double digits?
price action has been terrible this last 2 hours.
"I don’t understand. This pos should be at $1,000+ already. Cheap furniture you discard the following year is all the rage! Remodelling home offices for almost bankrupt small businesses should be the number one priority!"
lmao....nothing can keep W down!!.....trades the same way every day! shorts just losing more. Andrew Left is losing millions!
it previously went up $100 in 2 weeks. let's not get cocky here folks. Would love to see a vaccine to actually finish it off
temporary setback
Sold my W. Good profit $78 to $122.50. May buy more if it sells to $100
"Look at the W earnings trend for 2020. It is dropping rapidly every quarter as North America slowly goes back to ""normal"" shopping habits. The massive jump Wayfair enjoyed in Q2 2020 earnings is over. It only declines from here. The 13x increase in share price now looks overdone.Even with W generating an annual profit, which will be short lived given their business model, weird return policy and very high shipping costs.W won't go BK, but it should start to approach a more reasonable PE, since it is a ONLY furniture and housewares reseller."
Can we please get to 55 today? The bottom is about ready to fall out on this pig
EPS -3.05 per share.beats on revenue and growth 19.8%.
Wayfair still will not have a great comeback. Too many other great stocks to make a lot higher percentage.Deaths dropped in USA and Italy for first time. This virus will start to decrease and the stock market will roar back especially with the stimulus money. Warming tempatures will burn out the virus. 3 more weeks to lift lockdown.
99% of product is from china
they will have to borrow more money to keep this afloat... more crashing coming!!!
Wayfair is down 8.48% to 274.74
"Hi, Did anyone ride the curve from $20 to $180? Just curious to know who that lucky guy is?? "
Look at this trash run
Soooo dangerous to be long wayfair here. Soooo dangerous. Ad if wayfair was going to come out with a self driving sofa lol
and GREEN IT IS!!! lmao.... just like clockwork....every day!! make money!! buy the dip in the morning and make money!
"Just was called in on the lightning round on Mad Money, Jim said he's thought it was too high 20 points ago lol"
almost all broker house have given it an outperform rating! they are not wrong. they will huge commission when the stock goes to 165 and their clients reward them for being right.

This price makes it hard to buy for a one quarter chinese virus wonder with money laundering allegations and with all the competition in the pipe. Shorts will have their way very soon
"With all the returns, Wayfairs outlet stores may have to be open 7 days a week to maximize their losses."
Even the mail order companies will face hardships eventually if unemployment stays high.
"Come on $115, if I see it drop more than $115 I might hand on a few more dollars down. Later will roll all of it into FDX. Is shaping out to be a very good very with all this volatility."

"Mean Green whiskey for breakfast, tequila for lunch, dinner what Scotch?"
ok I am back in Puts galore. All spreads though. The premium too high
I covered at 87.
I need this around 50-60 by August. I believe it will be there. Then I’m betting on 30 by this time next year. They are going to have a disaster next three quarters and have to borrow more by then. This time it’s going to be uglier because they will have to beg for money at any interest.
"serious question, how is this stock above $100?"
Must be those greedy crooks manipulating markets. Never investing.
gravity do your work
short squeeze.im seller pretty soon.
"I'm out, at $205. I'm greedy, but that is enough for me."
A nail in the coffin if downgrades are coming in tomorrow or next week.
Day trader’s dreamland
"Beware all fellow wayfairers -beginning to realize the major thing Wayfair has going is the very low stock float of 48 mil - (should be 250 mil, once the company dilution steps in )the shorts will hang tuff and this share price will drop dramatically - too risky, I’m out taking my profits was a very good ride, made some nice money :)"

You had a nice run on W Tom. You ran with it up and shorted from the top down to the low. At least the low so far lol. What other stocks are you trading?
This is a house of cards
This board is so quite without Sam ! How are you and TTD is doing well last two days.
$120s before earnings
WALMART AND AMAZON BOTH WILL BE IN A BIDDING WAR !!!!!!! = $80

Next stop 314.44
Super strong volume today with strong tape and VWAP
"What’s the close today I am going to say 307, please reply with a number, let’s see where it goes"
My new target is $555 by august! .. $6 a day times 65 days.... should be no problem.
Up 2.3% pre-market. Makes no sense .
"W is really tanking today . Luckily, I sold early."
"240’s day of right after earnings and reality of future, all others competitors coming back, virus vaccine by oct will be 170’s by Aug 15 - just like other bubbles"
"Major bail, look at the volume, what is that 75% of an average day in the first 10 minutes? People jumping off this train fast."
"Down 40% on Wayfair Short, Citron Plays The Madoff Card?!Wow, talk about desperate! Poor Andy got it wrong two years ago and, apparently, he hasn't gotten any smarter since. Just poorer. But, hey, desperate times call for comparing wayfair to incarcerated ponzi putz Bernie Madoff, right? Shoulda seen that one coming. LOLWhat's next? A link to Putin? The bottom line is longs are making money here, traders are making money here, and shorts are licking their wounds.Keep pounding the table Andy, every time you do another bull makes money. Ka-ching!"
This is the first stock I saw in my last three years of investing career that has negative equity....I have no idea why people are so crazy for buying it....
150 handle by week's end
I see the hedge funds are paying the news sites to write opinion articles to pump this so a secondary offering will come out. Watch out for them to announce soon. Its amazing as this should be illegal. Will sell above $200 and buy puts longterm going out til next year. I think this company goes bankrupt within 12 months.
goin down the mountain
Every quarter 1 million shares are sold to the float to fund operations. What a scam.
"No one is moving rental places, buying new houses. Thus, no one buying furniture. I see this stock will goes down"
Interesting. No big boy pumping it today?
Squeeze to 200. Boy what a beat
"CFRA: 12-month target price is $55, with aprice-to-sales ratio of 0.4x our 2020 estimate,below its peers, noting about $1.5 billion incarry forward net operating losses (NOLs)."

Overpriced hype just like Tesla that let everyone down on the big battery day that was all hype and now stock tanks
Every time they run it up on low volume sell long term calls! You keep the premiums!
puts
Shorted 44 shares
I love the company’s products and I and my friends have purchased lots of furniture and carpets at great prices. Just wanted you to hear from a real customer.
Oh my I’m going to buy WTW it’s a great price
Going back to $48 tomorrow !!
a hundred bucks in 16 days
People moving to cash. These types of inflated names are sold. Close out the year and it in cash through the holidays.
Is it possible we are buying WeWork? They control about 90% of the world's commercial real estate...We would gain huge share in office furniture to complement already leading share in everything else..Just a thought..Haven't heard anything yet...
"The reason why they had such increase for March and April is because of home-office related buys such as ergonomic office chairs, desks etc. But this is a one time thing and can't be repeated ongoing basis. Also they don't have these items anymore so there is supply issue and hence missed sale for June. Not a good situation. Co-CEO will be dumping at this high prices."
yawn....up huge on all the calls I bought Friday!! stock too! bought the dip this morning too....easy money!
"They are going to announce the sale of shares after Q-1 2019 to raise money with the projected loss they have projected it will create a current account deficit on between current assets and current liabilities. This should be a good entry point for a quick short. I think the company can make it they have a great website excellent software/tech, and solid products. It all depends on how long the US economy can hold up if it can last through 2020 this could be a decent buy at 80-100$ a share but if it doesn't than I would be very cautious as this is an extremely generous valuation given their profit margin."
Any downgrade yet ?
"I cant stop laughing! I told you again what would happen ! once again, easy call........Wade, Joel, any questions??? no charge for the education."
I can't believe that the size of the bid and the ask is less than 10 shares...
"the truth of the matter is that without the commercial, many wouldn't know the existence of Wayfair."
"DARK DAY in wayfair stock performance. market is up, w is down. wayfair will punish the market now by going up 20% when market is down 1%"
How many of you bought last yr when it went down to $22? You will retire in a few years now if you did.
"Ripped 9% on nothing yesterday and ripping back on no stimulus, Prez has covid, jobs number missed. amazing stock...."
what a rocket ship!
get your puts in
Before market opens....low $228 high $285? What’s going on?

At what level does everyone think this will top out at?
Dilute $3billion(12million shares @&230) just 2 weeks ago(all quietly suppressed) now buy back $700 mil at $340...ya right
Limit order placed and I am taking my giant profits while I can still call them that as soon at I can trade tomorrow morning. I will consider coming back if this all blows over. Gunna sprinkle a few on Shopify and the majority on OSTK who has been getting a lot of promising press and with earning season upon us this will likely make a run like W did the day they reported last quarter. Jumped 40 pts. Can’t see why OSTK can’t make that same jump on August 9th.
Brutal markets. Way fair is not that bad Look at this company which is far worse than Way fairAXSM from single digits to 120Now falling back to 60sI feel 10 in three monthsThis is just preclinical stage companyOnce insiders sell this will fall like a rockToo much hypeLot of competitorsWay fair is a good company and they have so much good products and you never see any where elseAXSM is your short
READY FOR THE BIG DUMP UNDER 100 SOON BOYS
"""While analysts project that Wayfair's top line will grow by 12% in 2021, its earnings are projected to be cut in half."" And yet Motley Drool still promotes as a buy. Yes, buy at these levels and watch earnings shrink by half. Never listen to a fool, as they have no real analysts."
"Wait until the covid vaccine is delivered mid December, W will collapse."
yawn...... morning shorties! hope you all slept well !!........ time for Sammy to make some more money today! WHY??.... because thats what I do!
Sea of red and W up!!!
Did you see all the sales of shares from management?? Not sure the numbers are going to look so good when Wednesday rolls around. This company pollutes and you are keeping them in business. Good for you!
I wouldn’t wanna ride this down. Wait till the dust settles before you get back in. This isn’t going away.
"ut oh, insiders got the report early!"
Zacks investment keeps pumping this garbage as a #1 buy. They must have really screwed some investors over on this. Still sticking to my prior post on Tuesday that we will see 138 this week. Might bounce some off of it but that’s next resistance level. Could easily break much lower too.
"Shares Short 12.45M, 41.82%, Shares Short (prior month) 9.97M"
"New Citron report only shows the facts and says W will quickly trade down to $70 and lower.Cites continued massive losses, over $950 million in insider sales from the two co-CEOs. Also shows the years of failed sell side analyst reports pumping and flogging W to the peasants.Also cites the huge reliance on Chinese made goods.W is going down!"
Look at these customer reviews on non-Wayfair sponsored websites: https://www.resellerratings.com/store/Wayfairhttps://www.consumeraffairs.com/online/wayfair.html?#sort=recent&filter=noneThe majority most recent customer feedbacks were very negative. Wondering if W's business model is sustainable
WOW... what an opportunity... down $3.50 and you have to know it will come back! I count resist!!
I would imagine that we should see good earnings?
"Well I guess the shorts covered today,"
"Tom, you still holding your short?"
"This senior note offering is highly dilutive and just set the ceiling for W at $148 for the foreseeable future. The underwriters get their 15% gravy options. The company is spending a fortune on capped calls to limit the dilutive damage, in the unlikely case that this worthless business model and no recession propels the pps higher.Expect a ton of analyst upgrades as the underwriters try to pawn off these shares on their unsuspecting clients."
Wonder how wave’s portfolio is looking today. Not too good.
Around this level there was a $20 jump the beginning of the year. Looking at the steepness of the chart it looks we are in for a $20 drop.
I'm out! run is over!....gl!!....
"What is happening to W? The price range is over 3 points, and then come back down only 1 point. I still thought that W is dead long time ago. W will never makes money, period."
hey are stirring up water thinking to convert it to olive oil but they just have to stir faster...hahhaha what a chmcompany..especially since they are like Amazon e commerce .. are you telling me that when I shop at there website no cashier cost no sales man commission..no expensive show room rent..no host no cost whats so ever..how do they lose money...only explanation is that they actually buy those furniture and sell them at loss...simply..change the name from way fair to WAYFAKEReply1
The cfo stated that none of their estimates are based on supply chain problems with China. More that half of their goods are made in China. How do you not think that a slow down in economy or supply chain will happen with what is going on. They are going to be cutting estimates soon.
I can see a possibility of $298.50 today
Wonder where Sam went!
short this for life
"History Lesson for Bears: Walmart payed 3X trailing 12 month revenues for Jet.com. And their model was much worse than Wayfair's; far slimmer margins, commodity niche, lousy return buyer rates, rejected membership model.Wayfair will book $7 Billion in sales this year, add millions of new customers, improve their unit economics, and fully fund their non-US expansion without a capital raise. Oh, and one other important nugget to consider, the more mature US biz is already at break-even. And this is why Andy Left and his mini me minnions are getting squeezed month after month. And don't think we aren't enjoying it!!!"
I heard about W the other day on http://tradenow.xyz. It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Sam, did you see TTD today ?"
"Joel, Tom... want some excitement? let's short big TVIX"
Seems like a good time to buy some open puts here
Likely to see a miss on sales as wayfair cut advertising in second quarter. Their whole business plan is flawed as proven by the huge losses they generate! Slower sales because of less advertising will show in second quarter
@sam W is falling . Are you still in it ? Hope you are not buying today . Good luck to all!
Tremendous buying opportunity
"Interesting he keeps talking about ""LONG TERM"" approach --- there isn't going to be a long term as far as Wayfair is concerned."
Ride the gain. Thanks shorts
"After losing on my last 4 puts, I may try another if this thing gets past 135 today."
more proof of manipulation-Chipotle. company is a buffet fast food restaurant during a viral pandemic. Stock has gone up $400 in past month.be careful shorting W. price can go anyway the manipulators desire. they own all the shares and trade it up between themselves. it is collusion to manipulate prices. If the market was a true market there would be no shorting and no options. huge con game against retail investors
"Wayfairs cash burn rate is the number 1 question for this stock. I believe it will be very difficult to raise money, through additional debt or a stock offering in the current environment. Does Wayfair have enough cash on hand to last until the economy stabilizes ? Will the cash burn rate slow down?What does everyone think ?Thanks"
A lot of short covering today and day traders getting in on the action. Looks like a peak happening and should reverse course and trend back down once it settles and day traders move on. There’s no other real reason for such a jump today.
W is down 5.51% to $113.28
"Whether online or in store, most people will continue to shop at Wayfair for quality, price, and convenience. In for good. Good Luck."
"BYND should tank today.... sold $95 and $100 August calls yesterday.... tom , you short W and BYND?"
I used to short this stock but found PTON and WORK the gifts that keep on giving for shorting
Instead of shorting and worrying about covering at a high price to get out - why not buy put options? Can someone please tell me why you would short when options are available? This stock is going back to 30 fast!
Can someone explain to me way a furniture company is trading at 300 a share ? What am I missing and the price target just got raised Charles Schwab gave this thing A B rating and a buy ... educate me please
"With billions of converitble note, and stock options, Wayfair real market cap is almost $38B already.Don't get mislead by current EPS. First earning is sure not sustainable.Second PE is still very high even if they keep making same profit. PE would work out almost 35-40 still.Third bad reviews clearly show they working hard to avoid returns and that is way they boosting profit.Forth Overall market for entire furniture is only $114B and Online market already reach 40%+ rate."
Idk what’s more overvalued this or shop.
Amazing RUN!!
Valuable stock bearish. This hype stock bullish? Welcome to the new era
New wave of buyers for wayfair as colleges shut down to online only classes. Students will rush to wayfair for home office furniture
Last week this was trading at $227... way overbought. Going to fall like bricks.
yawn.....hope you bought that dip.....I tried to tell you!
"The CEO and Co-Founder sold half of their shares last week, somehow managed to catch the exact top, selling at $350. How convenient that they happened to time it so well, what are the chances they would both catch the exact top?! Ah that's right, it's a rigged game and this was all planned. It will be down-only from here.Earnings in February will be the catalyst to topple this absurdly priced stock and I expect to see it in double figures before the end of the year. If you are invested here, I would sell asap and if you need some motivation, just take a look at some trustpilot reviews ;)"
FREE MONEY AGAIN !! Even OVERSCHTINK was up today ! Should tank a little more.

"It is a horrible company and will be out of business one day, but I wouldn't bet against the next earnings report. They probably had higher sales during the virus shutdown. That is already priced in and why the stock took off, but when the real news comes out the stock could soar even higher. I'm waiting until have next earnings to really see the downturn."
looks like some one dumped $34 Million worth of shares mid day.
"The stock is shouting “short me”. Given that stores will begin opening up, this stock should start to decline."
"They will force as many short term shorts out before the price goes down. It has been this way since 2016! If you can’t afford to lose $5,000 in one day you should not short the stock!"

But but but Kevin O'leary just added it to his O shares along with every other inflated stock. Therefore it must go up!!
"Macy’s see strong Holiday shopping this season, shares rise."
Just to be clear they are registering stock that they already received the cash for months ago. This is the worse kind of addition to the float. Just these shares represent a larger $ value of float than the entire float before the pump and dump started. Big question is - when is the dump?
Spruce house partnership (10% owner) unloaded $261 million on 10/12/20; free fall ahead.

"I hope this runs quickly to $100. Which it probably will. Sales are up 40% the last week of March LOL. I do not believe anything they say. They had to borrow money sooner that I thought. They are still going to lose their normal 7.5% of sales. So, their loss will be the largest ever this q. I wonder what their excuse will be this time? They still say we plan to start making money soon. We are working on it. LOL. They should not even be allowed to be open right now. Sheets and pillows are not essential. I guess we know why they donated thousands of supplies to NY city. I will be short again soon. This is the stock that keeps on giving."

How will 25% increase in furniture Tariff affect Wayfair?
"I think it’s about time analysts were taken to court for making unreasonable predictions, if a company can be sued for doing so, so should analysts. They have the power to manipulate the market any way they choose, with no accountability or ramifications for their published statements!"
"When valuations settle back to rationale levels (Ebitda multiples rather than sales multiples), a lot of nasdaq stocks will drop another 30% to 50%. I think Wayfair produced pretty solid numbers but being objective I do think it is probably 40% to 50% overvalued. Over time it could justify its current value, but with supply chain issues, rising commodity and transportation prices, likely peak home improvement, increasing competition and a possible recession coming, etc all point to a correction in the stock price."
Guys OSTK is the growth story and W is over valued now
"(cry) I had a buy limit order in a 156.00 and the morning low was as 156.14, going up. That would have been a nice quick few bucks!"
"So people are not paying credit cards, car payments, rent or mortgages.... But, they are going wild on e commerce.. This country is so dysfunctional it is sad..."
nice $6 swing in a few hours... $1800 in the pocket....
"excuse me DOUGIE, but hows that short doing? lmao..... you and TIMMY still living in that card board box? at least summers here.... going to be a cold winter though!! ill send you a blanket."
Wayfair should close shop in Boston and relocate to a city where people go to work and leave their BS political opinions at home. Really smart people in Boston would rather let children sleep on the floor?
It's almost time. The last golden egg.
"Dave bought more with his credit card!...smart move! it was a no brainer. nice work, Dave !"
"Im back for more action! i was shorting this twice, from 190 to 170 and 170 to 150, i quit for a week bcs of the bump up but now im here for the 167-147 drop comming up this week!"
You know you need to buy this before the big jump after earnings. Can't go down until 2023.
Good opportunity to buy before earnings.
"Analyst Actions: Wayfair's Price Target Raised to $120 From $100 at Wedbush, Neutral Rating Reiterated"
"I like that nostalgy feeling. And when I hear ""Wayfair"", it reminds me strongly of the dot-bomb era. Ahh, the late ninties!"
"GUYS, I was in the retail furniture business for 30 years; I had 40 employees at one point. I'm telling you, W is worth VERY little; they will NEVER make money. WAY too many people damage the furniture, trying to assemble it, and then returning the furniture. Eventually the stock will be $50. or less."
Over bought. Shorting here.IKEA and Amazon are the kings.
"Even if there is stimulus money, all stores are open(not like before) with aggressive pricing,people would have to decide to buy overpriced disposable junk furniture (usually broken on delivery) from the country that created the China virus - I don’t think so. This stock pricing is way way way too high"
50% move from last Thursday!!! Amazing!
"Lmao.."".joel, you should spend more time studying business, markets, and stocks!! It might help you cut your massive loses.? ... I spent the winter on siesta Key......back to my Michigan residence now..... flew in 3 buddies to Sarasota for golf last week......life is good!"
Dead cat bounce.
up 10+ tomorrow
"Asks have been about double bid sizes for over an hour now so I do think it will continue to trend down till close. I think we’ll end at 1.6-1.7 million shares today, the lowest Monday I’ve seen. 10 day average volume at 2.6 million and continues to decline. There’s simply no interest for W."
Buy WTW is going up
short?
"My short basis is $141 for this evolving position (made a killing shorting this last year in November on earnings)This rise is typical of W manipulation due the small float. Seen it before. While though, I agree it is real, because the money is real. I've been catching up on Wayfair news coming into earnings. Saw a couple of interesting points I'll put out.-Some big insider sales recently (April)-1Q revenue for Wayfair is typically flat to down, rarely up.I'm not closing my short no matter what happens- as this is a $20/share company in a recession, and I have the time to wait. If it pops above $180, I will wait for a leveling off and then short much more.Not many retail traders here, as W is basically an institutional fund game. Currently, the funds are playing the ""growth game"". When the economy gets jittery, they will play the ""liquidation game""--like they did in Oct, Nov, and Dec.Good luck if you are long, I don't need luck being short, just patience."
Heavy volume.... shorts don't want to hold into earnings and are covering. Higher we go!
"Down 30 points today , remember Bitcoin at 20k? next day 10k"
"I am short for the long term (coming recession), so I am not that concerned either way. And I have no way to predict tomorrow's earnings. They could beat and pop $35 again, or they could miss both top and bottom and drop $20 then bleed down for another month. But there is something to the saying ""Sell in May and Go Away"" And it might be even more pertinent for a bloated, growth stock at the peak of an economic cycle"
"what a great company .........sorry you shorted more , Tom... im making money again!"
"I dont think you can extrapolate performance to ad spend, because as the internet matures ad spend gets more expensive for all companies. Acquiring customers is more competitive and expensive every year. What is more important is that wayfair debt cost 1% interest, that is amazing and Wayfair must above all else, reach critical mass, which is on track. It must reach critical mass very very quickly. That is how to succeed. Become the dominant player in an internet niche first, be very sticky. It cost more to acquire a customer than to keep one. Have you bought furniture from wayfaur its half the price and twice the quality of its competitors. If I were a brick and mortar furniture retailer, I would just close up shop."
hope you bought the dip! same pattern every day!
Maybe someone already saw this week's earnings release figures and just told a few friends?
"32% gainq1 cash burn $354mq1 cash bal $891mltd $1.5bmcap $10.5b861% gain off low, 45 daysshort interest 36%time will tell"
"One of the first steps in manipulation is analyst's price targets. When do the downgrades get announced? Dilution, debt fueled buyback, mgmt stock sales. How many red flags are needed. Still don't recommend shorting, you're the rube at a carnival game."
Nobody wants Wayfair-look at China's recovery-they ARE NOT BUYING ANYTHING-same in US.
"I still think 250 before downfall, just mho"
Any short seller is holding till Friday ? M holding my shares and keep my fingers cross.
"This news will delight the Bulls and drive the Wayfair bears crazy(er)! From a recent Boston Globe article:---snip---In preparation for hiring as many as 10,000 workers in the coming years, Internet retailer Wayfair Inc. is on a massive hunt for office space, an expansion that could make it one of Boston’s largest business tenants.The Boston-based company — which sells furniture and household goods — said Friday that it is looking for up to 1 million square feet of space, which is about three-quarters the size of the Prudential Center and nearly three times the room it has at its headquarters in Copley Place, where about 3,500 people work today.“At the rate we’re growing, we’ll need a lot more space,” said Wayfair spokeswoman Jane Carpenter.The company, which has hired real estate brokers and is negotiating with landlords, could cobble together that space through leases in several locations in Greater Boston and perhaps outside of Massachusetts, she said in an e-mail responding to questions from the Globe.---snip---"
I find it intriguing how a stock can go up over 10 fold but no one takes any profit. Does anyone think this is actual trading or is it just computer bots playing with others money? Are these bubbles just controlled by the government as well? The fed is backing the market? Like how does that make sense... Tax payer dollars backing a market that most Americans don’t even participate in.
"Everyone should sell Wayfair(W) and buy Kirkland(KIRK). Last year Wayfair proved their furniture model doesn't work. Amazon and Walmart were watching them super close to see if Furniture and Home Decor can be an online only business and it can't. People still enjoy seeing and feeling those types of products before buying. Pier 1 imports failed due to garbage leadership and too many stores. Pier 1 filed bankrupcty to mirror Kirklands model and because of this Pier 1 will be emerging from bankrupcty with a similar store count as Kirklands but with a new owner. Several buyers have already shown an interest in Pier 1 which has $350+ million in debt and zero assets. Kirkland is already at the store footprint as Pier 1, has no debt, reduced expenses from operations, reported an increase in cash flow from 3rd qtr to 4th qtr, and reported their sales 2 weeks prior to the earnings call. They are nearly done in their turnaround and will be the right size to balance out e-commerce and stores to be profitable. Another thing to note is that if Pier 1 does sell to a buyer then Kirklands stock price will jump especially since they are much better positioned. Why buy Pier 1 when you can buy Kirklands? so in essence once Pier 1 announces the sale amount everyone owning KIRK will make a lot of money riding the stock price up to the same market cap valuation. I believe Pier 1 will sale withing the range of $600-900 million. You can do the math. Good luck to all who want to make money."
Where’s little Joel? So quiet these days.
"Dont listen to David little sheeps... his definition of “massive volume” is 440k in first 4hrs on a stock that has a daily avg volume of 2mil+. Yesterday’s first 4hrs was 500k, so do the math yourself folks- and ask yourself “should I blindly listen to a blatant pumper? Or buy the stock on my own merit?”"
Hopefully they are inflating the price so hedge funds can get out at maximum profit
Layoff 500 or about $50 millions per year but loss is $300 millions a quarter.Doesn't help.
5Million in volume on the first time they ever made a cent.... MM’s are walking this up so they can issue more debt. It’s a joke
To plug the huge negative cash flow the either add more debt which is already big or the dump a bunch of stock on the market soon
This pos might bk me before they go lol. Jobless claims up more than expected and no telling how many claims there would really be if they were able to process them all. They are way behind. This is unsustainable. No way economy rebounds like they think. I hope so but doubt it. I’m sitting on 80% cash and not making another trade until the madness ends
who in the right mind as a savvy business management will issue a bond and then use the money to buy back their own stock. If they have extra money under the bed then they could have use that money to buy their own stock or invest it in the business or pay off their old loan. This is the company based out of MA and in my business world I found most of MA people are a fraud.
"Wayfair is a better version of Ikea without all the ""brick and mortar"" holding it down which means the stock price is probably quite a bit under valued. A lot of analysts say that if they can do the same business without that ""overhead"" then this is worth a lot more and that makes a lot of sense. Especially with the ""covid lockdowns"" no one can go walk into Ikeas and other stores to look at furniture or things like a lamp and so they are doing their research online on websites like Wayfair. This isn't going to end anytime soon because even with the ""lockdowns"" ending everyone wants to stay home and buy things online instead. Everyone says that they lose money but that's not really true because if they do things like sell stock or bonds the ""fed"" buys them and that goes right back into the economy and the average investor and eventually to jobs. Wayfair is going to take over a big part of ""brick and mortar"" stores and so will grow a lot which means a big jump in the stock price is probably going to happen."
"This is a $25 dollar stock at best. Right now the market just doesn""t realize it."
"Inmd blasts off in the morning, has options now.Inmode is next, they finally have options also, sq, net, pzza spce"

I knew it .
W reached a new All Time High at 112.24
Overstock down $36 almost 30% from High this week! W to follow !
Lol this company won’t hit earnings and still goes up. Over price the bears will are coming
Below $70 by COB tomorrow
Beware of Rothchild connection.
The amount of institutional investing here is outrageous.
Volume looking good today... on the sell side
Better buys else where! Over valued
So this has gone up > 1000% since march lows reaching ATH. How much higher can it go? Asking for a friend.
Dow up 1200. Wayfair down again

There has never been much option trading on w. Still not a ton but a lot more than normal being played in next few weeks.
W is up 6.76% to $123.84
"Ok, I have way too many call options now. This is a pure gamble....not investing"
Shares are going to $130.00Amazon does not show profit either and Disney is borrowing $5Bil today W's earnings beat will trigger massive robo-trading no matter what short sellers conjure up
"With so many people staying home, the trend is DIY and Wayfair has no exposure there."
"No volume at all... 126,000 shares traded.... investors should start coming in....looking for safety."
"More ""no volume"" manipulation of this tiny float stock. Zero revenue growth for the past 4 quarters. Steady at $2.3B. Deeper losses every single quarter. Founder CEOs formed a company and gave it a name that sounds like a bank, then bought their own company issue in a private placement, convertible at $75 into shares.Doesn't get shadier than this!"
Looks like the converted started to dump!
"Wayfair needs new CFO, Controller, and VP of Supply. It's been selling items well below cost to drive top line revenue, which a kindergartner could do. The suppliers and cartage carriers are not being held accountable for poor packaging, damages and shortages. The policies and procedures for damage mitigation are out of control, and they give their Customer Service way too much leeway, and rarely pick up damaged items which leads to abuse by customers. They have multiple branded websites with significant amounts of cross over in inventory, and you can find different prices for same items on different websites. What a cluster. To get proper control over this company and establish a path to profitability, it will have to raise prices which will result in significant revenue losses in the near term."
Big pop to $140 today.
OSTK bestbstock of the year. Great pick shortall
David all true but just try and trade on its RSI by moves
There are no coincidences. How exactly do you sell a $2k cabinet for $30k? Who the heck sells a pillow for thousands? Who names a cabinet? Names them after missing children? Oh and Top executives hang out w Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton? When does conspiracy cross the line into fact?
W- crazy to buy!!! Down graded today
im guessing that there will be one last short squeeze after earnings to 270$ and than a HUGE run down
"I am down on my short, however, i believe this thing will crash and burn. The current valuation assumes a 1.25 price to sales ratio... that's insane for an unprofitable company! look at overstock... their p/s ratio is 0.28... dont freak out.. this is just big money manipulating."
"It RH, way less number of shares, huge short number to squeeze and blowout numbers coming for quarter and year!Numbers have been raised from 1.50 to 3.50 for quarter and 7.50 to 11.50 for the year and those could be conservative. Buffett bought in as did long time short Andrew Left loves it! Says 400-800 coming"
"Never short a LOW FLOAT stock! BYND and W are both extremely low float stocks, and nothing takes them down, as long as the press keeps pumping them. It's supply and demand, simple as that! Nobody is selling W... bynd is hilarious.....demand is soooo high and only 11 million shares in float ...half are short. Supply and demand..."
Are you guys still in W? They just got featured on the watchlist at (https:// www.tradenow.xyz)
"Did someone say short squeeze. I hate this companies fundamentals, but the short term thesis is bullish. Look at the consolidation of its price in the last 5 days. The amount of shorts that added to their position must have been insane over that period. By the end of this week, this could hit $90."
yawn..... wonder how much ill make today??
short squeeze is 47%
where is mike today hehe
Back to 90 for 3d time.
Takes about 30 days from the top for this stock to fill the gap.
"Now that I am not short, it decides to go down. Are you kidding me????"
out.... and will be back shorting this again
when is earning report before market open or after ??
"W.... Stock on steroids! The daily low volume is bothersome. Low volume stocks can be easily manipulated. I believe that's what's going on here. At some point the rug will be pulled out. When one of the institutions says thas enough, let's take out money and run, the drop will be as epic. Stairs up.... Elevator down. Be careful out there."
Panic about to set in.
It is a safe bet that one day in the imminent future W will close below $81.
"The volume is so low, it's a game between hedge fund institutes, regular people please stay the hell away from this stock"
How will it overcome the Amazon affect. Amazon now advertising on TV home goods furniture free delivery...
@sam Sold for quick buck .Thanks for reminding us to buy the dip.
W reached a new All Time High at 141.90
This could have a dozen straight trading days of this kind of decline and still be overpriced. Think about that for a minute.
It now seems pretty clear that the stock’s investors don’t care bout the sex trafficking concerns.
"W is an example of why I don't short stocks...lol. There's no reason for this stock to be as high as it is, but that doesn't mean people agree with me...lol."
they are creating long halt to prevent but l further big drop
yahoo deleting posts left and right hahaha
"stock buyback begins, in order to allow the convertible bonds investors to cash out at $300+ AGAIN"
"For those misguided souls who think W has never been profitable, keep in mind that Wayfair was a private company from 2002 until it went public. It took on very little outside investment money in during its early years because it was profitable. This is why the founders have retained unusually large stakes in the company, And this is why I trust the owners will continue to run the company for the benefit of long term share holders. And this is partially why I've held this stock since its IPO."
Wayfair 5 day chart =clown show
"From $25 to $135 in a month? Uh, okay. It's a buy here. Go for it."
Short o’clock 
"Today, W has finally filled that massive gap down from last earnings. It took a few months to do it. Now primed for the next leg down on upcoming earnings. How much more money has W lost in Q4? I expect another financing round very soon at these recent highs. The cash burn is massive."
Attn Wayfair bulls: please fasten your seat belts and return your tray tables to their upright and locked position. The Captain has informed us we are entering Blue Sky altitude and 12.5 million shorts will be delivering additional rocket fuel during the next phase of our ascent.Enjoy the ride!
Just the start. Might know a little about a trend of 1 stock. But hyping any stock in bubble market is a fools game Sammy. Please Sammy stick around for decline and tell us how smart you are
Last November Wayfair started it rise to March by 50%. Momentum in November alone was 20%. See you at $120 by end of month.
"when you are done buy to cover, thats when this shall drop. as long as retail think they can short it, this stock will go up."
"Oh my God, SELL THIS THING. Lockdowns coming to a quick end. Wayfair? No thanks."
Garbage stock should be zero in a month
Bid 215 - Ask 218... come on...
1.5 times sales os hardly overvalued.
"How is a pillow $10k and the same unique name as a girl recently missing? At first I thought it was total nonsense, now you have to at least wonder"
how is it possible the stock is down on such amazing quarter? yoy growth of 110%.
Come to Papa... I need you Wayfair to come down below $100. Need free money  for my two week European vacation next month.
"Also Zero rating updates since issuance of 1.3B debt. Current average rating price is $300. 11 buy, 9 holds, 5 sells. Again just facts"
"The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose material adverse information, including that Wayfair was experiencing significant drop in demand for its online product offerings and was increasing its advertising to boost sales. As a result of defendants' false statements and/or omissions, Wayfair stock was artificially trading at more than $149 per share during the Class Period. While the stock was trading at this high price, some of its senior executives and directors cashed in and sold over $87.75 million of their personally held shares."
"As i wrote here months ago... I was in the retail furniture business for over 20 yrs, I had 40 employees. It is a VERY difficult business. Wayfair will NEVER make money shipping out KD furniture via UPS... way too many complaints,, that costs lots of $$. This will be a $50. stock at some point in the not-so-distant future."
"CHECK OUT ""home""..at home! bargain"
5 dollar stock by 2021
everything must go online. thats where W shine. has to pay no rent. AMZN is too big can not move large enough furniture fast enough.
UP UP AND AWAY!!! same pattern every single day!! watch and learn!
Im considering shorting...but I can wait patiently...let insanity run its course
I told you!! Wayfair roared back and I'm making money!! I knew it would come back.....should have listened.....again!!
From Motley Fool:“Analysts see Wayfair net revenue slowing to 58% in the third quarter”
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4294626-stanphyl-capital-letter-september-2019REPORT includes a link to short thesis on Wayfair
Target is still 416 on this with resistance at 367.
Ackerman made 600K on W on the way down! When he shorts again it will be after market trade again!
Authorities by law are obligated to investigate the money laundering by child traffickers on overpriced $10k pillows and $14k storage cabinets. That will be interesting to see what and who it turns up
"It will fill that gap watch and see. Just as the s&p500 today filled that gap down, so will this."
Again..Only stock green on NYSE...People see the safety in this massive cash flow generating disruptor...On it's way to 1 million per share..
Let’s see if W bounces today on an update day. Yesterday’s action showed good strength. Dow down 600 points and W gained during the final 300 point drop.
The fact that this is at $220 is mentally challenged
Mike now is the time to sell calls! You keep the premium. BEST advice here! Sell long term calls at this price! 120 aug calls! You will make enough for several homes
Monday will be interesting
Morning . Any chance W will drop to 90 today ?
Sell and move into more recent IPO's with growth like Docusign and Dropbox
Liberal media won’t post a single news story about Wayfair Child Trafficking! What a sick group of people!
Buying W at $145 today was the steal of the decade !! You can't lose money it.... impossible!!
"when a stock is up 500% in one month, no reason for it not to go up another 100% over next month."
Sales doubling? Wow - this should be a $50 stock.
massive volume again today!!! they're fighting over it!! .. . another stunning performance !
I am bleeding to death because of my shorts. 
buy bearish put deep in the money leaps - to benefit from this garbge stock. buy the ones with least implied vol around strike of 160/140.
Be very wary of long or short on this one...Company has strong ties to Rothschilds and CCP
Blood bath tomorrow >=]
"For what it's worth---I ordered an $1100 chair from Wayfair. The promised date came--and NO chair. After another 10 days, I got a Cancellation Notice from Wayfair. They PROMISED to place refund on my next month's CC Statement. No reason given for cancellation. Cmmmmmmmmmm"
The volume is very low... not that many buyers... price has climbed up to much in the last 10 days on no news.
SSR triggered prob wont head up till earnings though thanks to all these money managers making corrections and taking money off the table right at earnings
releasing earnings on election day because they hope no one pays attention to the horrible numbers!! LOL!! EVERY TRICK IN THE BOOK!!

"So when exactly does Wayfair plan to start raising cash, December is now approximately 6 months away and that is when the cash burn rate projects to be zero cash on hand. You never want to get close to December without a cash plan."
Zacks to the rescue ....so obvious
Being censored -/removed for the truth
"Shorts who shorted W are short-sighted and will wind up losing there shorts, boxers, briefs, trunks and long underwear. W is on track to become the king of online retailers of furniture and household goods."

"E-Commerce valuations seem foreign to a lot of people. Take Amazon, the company wasn't profitable for YEARS, but its equity valuation has soared over the past decade. The name of the game is how strong your brand is and your customer following. Wayfair will be profitable, they're just getting the hardest job out of the way, building their customer base. Their revenue growth is a testament to the power of their brand in the home furnishing arena."
"The chart looks amazingly like last earnings. Big move down, 3 days later, big move up."
Looks like we are just waiting on the last of the insiders to dispose the free stock and then she falls
"Congratulations to Wayfair! After roughly 20 years you finally achieved a PE ratio. That means there is finally a postive number in the P/E denominator, something foreign to Wayfair called ""earnings"". At only a 155 PE ratio, this is a screaming bargain steal for anyone who is interested in potentially taking 155 years to earn the current valuation of the company. Of course, they could grow, and perhaps only take 30 years or 15 years to get there. Good luck with that! Yep, a textbook case of what Buffett would want to buy - such an undervalued stock of such a massively overperforming company. Buffett is all but certain to #$%$ up this at the bargain basement price of $30 billion. Duh, it is soooo obvious."
This has to be the pump before a massive sell off right? I’m not crazy ....it just doesn’t add up. I’m not sure if I should be worried about my August Put options
"most of the ""bulls"" fail to understand a one-off event, vs normal operating conditions and a return to normal. funds will not hang around from here with money tied up when future prospects are back down for several years. they will unload half over next 3 months"
"Long term I am bearish on this, near term don’t know how high it could be pumped, day traders should be content of a few dollars moves."
Bid $293 Ask $296...
The Wayfair insanity continues...
lmao....shorts all GONE!! I tried to tell them.....it was an easy call...
The furniture this company sells makes IKEA's furniture look like like hand crafted masterpieces.
Imagine holding onto an ultra speculative stock during a time like this after it went up 8x in 6 weeks
like people have money to buy junk furniture at high prices....LMAO
Don't get trapped. This is going to see 100 on sell off.
"It’s so funny .. a few days back everyone was saying good things about this company, now all of sedan the company is in disaster.."
W total cash per share = $10.49 ($949 million).W earnings per share (ttm) = -$10.68This was before the Coronavirus supply chain disruption.Bottom line is that Wayfair has less than 1 year of cash on hand and $2.4 billion in debt to service. Another cash raise is vital to their survival in 2020.
"...and manipulate it back up to green to end the day. Simply beautiful Mr. Powell, well done sir!"
"I’m gonna start adding Puts, this Isn’t a $100 stock. More like $50 at best"
"It appears one person bought for 180 in extended hours and then the next bid is130 with ask of 132. Someone wants to shake out the shorts, really my guess is someone selling calls"
"Woot woot the 30 shares I sold at 164.5 I bought back at 145.5 and I'm up at least $1.50 per share at the moment, tempted to turn it back into cash again!"
"I laugh when the rubes talk about profits.... they don't mean anything , as you're learning..."
Remember when Sammy said wayfair was a safety stock HAHAHA what a rube. What a rook. Guy thought he knew stocks because he was playing a short squeeze. Sammy the rube
omg the costs to manage a credit card and the defaults will expedite the bankruptcy. LoL
Just shorted 300 shares at 160.29 . Recession is coming and this baby is going down .
There she blows! looks like the news is getting out. Just covered my short....
Wow I guess it’s okay if you are a human trafficker  even though is a humor...... it should have scarred investors but no F were given! We are in a real world folks!
How much would You pay to lose $8.73 per year ? And the last quarter was the worst at $2.23 per share. Think waking up soon and seeing a $40 price is in the cards ! Look out below !
"What is this? Form S-3ASR Wayfair Inc. . Is this them issuing more shares?? 11,964,524 of them??"
SURE glad I bought that dip!! always pays off.....yawn....watch and learn kiddies!!
"How many folk will want to sit on furniture in a busy store when stores reopen? Attitudes towards online shopping will be affected long term. Wayfair's long substantial investments in presenting detailed product information,setting competitive prices, and providing excellent customer service and home delivery will pay off in the long term."
why is this stock red?makes absolutely no sense
"Who is going to investigate this stock going from 25 to 180. This is not normal, and that too with no healthy financial foundation Google is full of awful comments for this cheap company and the CEO giving a false earning report"
Charlie says Epic fallArlo says downgrade Benjo says only computer generated.Gregory says impossible Seckin says overpricedRiaz says less than 100!Keep listing to Cramer and your analysts!Wow I say FERRARI!!!
A full 25% of the US (18-65) workforce is now either on unemployment (30 million) or cannot file for it (13 million).Do we really think they are all buying home furnishings?Any guesses as to how big the Q loss will be next week? We all know the headline growth number will be positive by 8-10%. I am guessing at least a $300 million loss.
Every online company that is profitable is down today! W who loses a billion a year and will be bankrupt in 2022 is up lol. In a cash position so don’t care but wow
What a joke. No upgrades and a max target of $150. Nice action for a 28% upside in one day. Three day rule and down tomorrow.
"Fake Wayfair sale report. Just like Luckin coffee/LK. No money for furniture, people buy food these days."
"About time this trash came down! Tarrifs will really put the hurt on them, but it will just get passed on to the consumer.... And it will be the same for all furniture sellers ....."
"innocent until proven guilty. buy the rumor, sell the news. so many quotes that work!"
"Up 9 of the last 10 days, and has added 10 billion in market cap. This is complete insanity. This is an online furniture company. NOT A TECH COMPANY!"
made money shorting W yesterday...just dont feel the luv today
And the Ponsi Scheme continues
"TOM, TTD is on fire !! lmao.... we should have held, but nothing wrong with taking profits!"
"question for the pro... let's say Tom and I shorted the stock. the company goes belly up, and we can't buy back the shares to cover. what happens then?"
load up the trucks again!
"Uxin, your last chance for the china vroom ahead of tuesdays earnings.I put 200 racks on it at its 52 week low caused by manipulation and nobody knew of it or about the china vroomBecause of vrm and earnings they will soon though.Buddah"
Why are we down with good earnings
"Tariffs positive for our guys as Wafair robots powered by cloud-based, VR AI can manufacture all products at zero cost!!!"
Oh dear - vaccine news....Not good for Wayfair. Looks like it'll be heading into a bear market from here.
What a fake stock price. Its stuck at same price even though the market went down for 5 minutes.
Straddle sell calls/puts early in the AM! You will be able to keep the premium on one side of the trade. At the end of the day the premium will be zero
It will be just like yesterday down then slowly back up and maybe down 1/5% for the day. Easy readings
"How did this company and stock price develop an immunity to reality? How are retail investors buying at these hyper-inflated levels? Or is it exclusively insider trading at this point? Why are you not buying something with strong earnings, a healthy dividend, or future sales guidance.. my goodness! I gave up shorting this when it was in the high 100s. I feel like there is something sinister going on here but I know the SEC won't do anything about it."
"Great time to buy HOME, earnings were down but no surprise...great buy. $7.05"
"I agree with the many negative statements on Wayfair on this board. They don't make a profit, poor business model, etc. That said, there is no doubt that anyone I ask about Wayfair have a positive feedback and absolutely love this company's products. I'm a contractor and my customers buy from Wayfair all the time."
"Overstock has overpriced things too. I must get to my fainting couch, I have the vapors!https://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/Antique-Ravar-Karmen-Oversize-Wool-Rug-121x208/27202465/product.html?refccid=SYWFJ4VHO3F35A2OCEAQQAIHWM&searchidx=0&kwds=&rfmt="
Retail going down the drain as the dollar gets pummeled. I guess that’s what happens when you print $4T.
"watch for the big correction coming , will be epic fall"
Wayfair charging back!! It's a safety stock! No risk here!
"Amazon's Renewed Interest in Home Goods is a Flattering Nod to Wayfair.As Jane Goodall likes to say, ""when the 800 lb gorilla wants to start acting more like the nimble and focused 100 lb chimp, bet on the chimp!""Clearly, the rise of Wayfair hasn't gone unnoticed across multiple landscapes; from traditional brick and mortar retail, to Wall Street, and now to eCommerce ""competition"", with Amazon (disclosure: I'm long AMZN too) looking to reboot their interest in the space. Curiously, they seem to be attempting to borrow from Wayfair's model (more flattery!) of massive warehouses, plus sophisticated logistics and last mile delivery control. Rather than run and hide, Wayfair bulls are basking in the attention and recognition that Wayfair has, indeed, built the better mouse trap that eluded very other furniture etailer that came, and failed, before them. So, will Amazon succeed or fail? Time will tell, but they'll need at least two years at full throttle to get where Wayfair is today. And by then, Wayfair will have had another two years to perfect the model Amazon wants to mimic. First mover advantage goes to Wayfair.Of course, WMT is watching this unfold and must be asking themselves, ""Where's ours?"" ""Should we also invest a few years and a few billion dollars in a larger parcel delivery network with last mile control and efficiency?"" ""Or should we just pony up and buy the market leader, with those pieces already in place, and get a two year headstart on Amazon while adding more outstanding ""E"" talent to our Web team...""Things are getting juicy here....."
this gonna be bad for longs Monday oh boy
short interest growing
did anyone notice that accounts payable is roughly the same as cash & cash equivalents? $700 Mhow long before W runs out of cash and has to borrow more. Debt is the growing
WOW...SHORTS WERE RIGHT!!! It's correcting!! Down 17 cents!! I can't stop laughing! .....Dow down 296.... watch and learn...
Don't be surprised if you see class action information or SEC investigation soon about this stock.
W and RH- way hyped
"Sam, was your computer repossessed?"
Will explode when the earnings come out.
Notice dirty “on the take” analyst never wrote about Spruce House dumping $261 million 1 week ago just like they never talked about the $3 billion @$230/ share Dilution in August- you only find that out here guys digging for it
W reached a 52 Week low at 69.02
Shocked they haven't raised money at these levels.
can you imagine what would happen here if moderna announced 90% vaccine effectiveness this week to keep up with pfe?! LOL
Pedofair is going to to 125 first and then to 25you been warned
at what point will the hedge fund blow up? Money is leaving equities worldwide.
I have purchased some items from Wayfair recently. The quality on 3 pieces was good on the 4th rather sketchy. Also thought maybe a good stock to own. I do not get it. Today's closing price $127.71. Looked at the financials and they have lost money in at least 4 of the last 4 years. Looked at the management team and all of the upper folks have degrees from the ivy league and several have worked at high levels for silk stocking consulting firms like Bain. Why can they not make money??? Very strange. Seems that this turkey should be trading at $10.00 or less. What am I missing??
"Here comes the shorts AGAIN ! Scan, pump, overpriced, bad stock, not its real value, fraud, analysts say it will go down, etc etc. Long live the 50K per ur analysts while I cash in! Love this stock! Keep analyzing and coming up with excuses shorts!"
We need a reality tv show for traders; can you imagine what it would be like to put the person that sold at $22 and the person that bought at $22 in the same room?
W reached a new All Time High at 92.50
"W is just a pyramid scheme - once the new feed/seed money stops it will all collapse- even with all the hype anything above $120 is obviously absurd - all the dirty analyst & company pump brainwashed pyramid pumpers to push this overpriced garbage & suck new dreamers in (remember the 12 million shares /scam/ dilution dump @$230 they never talk about) it’s straight math on lousy fundamentals, lost money for 10+ yrs,overpriced cheap damaged product, terrible returns and a ton of competition"
"Adding more,great buying opportunity before earnings,,up$50 tomorrow easy,400 by November"
"I bought a chair on Wayfair for $5, but Amazon's price is $250."
"yawn.....made a little over $600 today.....not as good as yesterday.. just under $2,000 yesterday....not a lot of money but I enjoy showing you rubes how to swing trade...not that any of you are capable of learning anything..."
Wont even see 2 million shares trade today.
"The company is looking to change their name to fix the bad publicity. They are looking at going with ""The Epstein Emporium"". It might be a little more direct for their ""super saver shoppers""."
W==aggressive sell at this price level!Target $150!
Article says Wayfair vulnerable to go under. That seems hard to believe. Anyone else saw that article??
Wonder how much it would have gone up if it wasn't downgraded today?
This company is worth zero. It is essentially bankrupt. It will have another cash raise.
Nice EPS...lolEPS (TTM) -10.68We all know Wayfair losses money every quarter but we keep buying. Earning surprise is going to be they lost more money on every sale. But I like that. $24 to $131 in less than 1 month. Now that's what I call a great company! AMAZ move out of our way.
"I guess your $20 dollars in your bank account or wallet, you can still buy furnitures for living room since most of everyone is not working and pump this W up."
"One year from now, W will be trading sub $50"
"Benjo is back with his new price idea. , what happen to 189$ price target"
The longs are probably the same retail investors that were buying SPCE in February. They wonder why they never make any money.
Up $7 on 140k shares traded? What a farce.
Here is the thing. Everyone is out of furniture but on way fair you can still buy and get in a reasonable amount of time. I think they kill their earnings
Looks like about 7 million shares crossed the tape today in 8 large blocks. Look at the chart. These must be prearranged as they aren't showing up on the running daily volume.Big boys are out at $195. Watch it plummet from here.
pumpers come back to pump this stock again.
SHORTING is a TREATABLE Mental Illness.Profiting on Pessimism leads to heart decay.
It's not too late to cover.
Wayfair is down 7.82% to 300.45
Stock mrkt is a scam . Lost a lot of money shorting this . Crazy evaluations ..
Underwriters working hard to keep this elevated until they can price the convert! Also let Spruce House and Tiger sell!
Saw wayfair press release that they charge tax for 80% of transactions but I bet those 20% of transactions that aren't taxed currently would be making definitely much higher than 20% of total revenue. I say this because people who are making bug purchases see noticeable tax dollar amount that would tilt their decision towards savings if purchase is made through wayfair whilst other 80% of taxed transactions are small enough to purchase it from somewhere else. Given sleazy wayfair management they will never disclose how on much of total revenue
W is up 5.74% to $116.38
"off to the races again!! load up the trucks!! what a company!! every day, just goes up!! I feel for shorts.... I really do!"
"I hope the bullish guys at 350 that were claiming stupid prices are proud of themselves - funny how they have now disappeared. I just hope no newbies got sucked in by their crazy claims. As many have said, when you go up as fast as W has, it is likely you will go back down just as fast."
Get ready for the squeeze into earnings. Should be good earnings.
"wayday resulted in only a 5 point Google trend blip. Tiny, insignificant"
cover asap i see it go up as i told before
"W has the potential to be the fad stock of 2020. Shaky biz, gross overvaluation, climax top after gap up. Short when ready - the gun is loaded!"
Debt is not your friend........Wayfair certainly has plenty of debt......
How is this not down
back to 70 in six months
"'QAnon is described by extremism researchers at the Anti-Defamation League as “first and foremost an online trolling and disinformation movement” that began in 2017 on the 4chan message board. The mysterious posts from the unidentified “Q,” who claims to be one or more people with insider government access, push the conspiracy theory that there is a “deep state” plotting against President Trump, that high-ranking Democrats and Hollywood stars are involved in a pedophile ring, and other “scattershot and sprawling” theories that include JFK Jr. not being dead as well as “antisemitic and anti-government elements,” according to ADL, which roughly estimates the number of QAnon adherents in the tens of thousands and adds that while they do not “believe that all QAnon adherents are inherently extremists, this is a dangerous theory that has inspired violent acts.”'https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/counterterrorism/conspiracy-theory-extremism-when-viral-claims-turn-dangerous/"
It’s way overbought/ covered . I’m dipping my toes back in at 193.7.
"Investors are taking positions in OSTK for it's Blockchain, wholly owned subsidiary medici ventures"
Gotta short this
This could easily double.
I know it’s difficult shorting a stock when there’s this much momentum 80% of the stuff they ship is already been returned or broken or doesn’t last more than year. IKEA has better stuff
online retail has taken a giant leap forward and in today's paradigm you have to consider that online shopping will be the trend for the next 2 year's if not longer.
I changed my dogs name to wayfair! bought him a new couch from W to lay around on.......
China thanks all longs for their continued support. You guys are awesome.
"TOM, I will cover the rest of my shares at $130 today....... if it hits......"
"You start to wonder if the parabolic downside in earnings, over the years, finally starts to settle in (probably not)."
I was just going over W latest balance sheet and couldn't stop laughing.They have a negative $944 million net worth and they want to buy $700 million of their stock.HA HA HA
"Still waiting for $5, with cash draining day by day and debt piling up, they are in serious danger of filing for bankruptcy"
its always down the first hr of trading shall go up rest of the day. get in now. FIRESALE PRICES!
Put time
dang ... this thing fell hard
This won’t affect Wayfair in short run but would probably have negative impact before end of year if people don’t need to furnish dorm rooms and apts in the fall...
PLEASE KEEP IT GOING....BUY BUY BUY...?
"Once again, those who listened and bought the dip this morning were VERY WELL REWARDED as usual....its such an easy call....if you know what you're doing.....and then you have shorts who chose to fight the tape and all of Wall Street .....that folks , is a losers game!!....... just ask ANDREW LEFT! Anyone who cant see this isn't going down anytime soon probably shouldn't be in the market....like the RUBE, Malee."
69% of yesterdays trades went short. Probably 50% were day traders and have already covered (I one of them). I bet we close above $115 today as over 30% of the float is short and shorts usually cover on Fridays.
"I am a bit surprised Wayfair has not had an announcement on how they intend to raise cash. If sometime in December is the projected out of cash period, to wait much longer is risky."
"Wayfair green again.......this is getting boring......every day, it jus goes up!!! Wish it would turn red for day, just for some fun..... what a company!!"
Dow should be -20% correction; Nasdaq -25%; Appl -30% ; Tsla -40%; Zm -50%; W -60%.......
short again tomorrow will be 245 or lower
Mm afraid to report real time activity? It actually looks like they've tried to put the brakes on.
Is it true they have never made a profit?
Thanks for the info guys. I just shorted 200 shares to counter balance the 100 long. At least I'll be able to make money on the long way down. Seen this before many times. It will be a bloodbath for two/three more days before she settles. I think someone here mentioned 230. I'm guessing 260
"when they talk about how the market hasn't fully corrected itself yet, this is one of those stocks that will be dropped heavily when it happens."
Stock should be trading around 10-11. Sell now.
"Jeffries, one of the best firms out there, starts coverage of W with a buy rating and price target of $192 !! you can't find a better stock , as shorts are slowly learning. as the market tanks, W just goes up!! when the market id green, W just goes up more. I think $192 is very conservative. they have taken amazon to the woodshed and will continue to take share away from them, as they add products daily! Amzn has already lost the in the furniture space, and is now too far behind to ever catch up. its checkmate! now they are expanding into other areas and amzn can do nothing!!"
"I REMEMBER WHEN BITCOIN WAS DISCUSSED ON EVERY KITCHEN TABLE, NEXT THING YOU KNOW WENT DOWN 70% . SAMETHING WITH WAYFAIR, WILL TAKE WAYFAIR 10 YEARS TO MEET THE CURRENT MARKET CAP"

"lmao, shorts. wayfair bout to release its best quarter in history as an e-commerce marketplace with its own distribution network... and you think this is going down????"
TLRY dump after hour. What is hedge fund next move?
"I have been watching this stock closely and also checking the conversation here daily for the past few months. I notice a pattern where by the same posters seem to return in droves and only post uber-bullish comments, with very little reasoning. It is happening again now and I also notice these posters don't really post on other stocks, it's only Wayfair - just something I noticed that seems very odd...Is it just newbie robinhood investors? Or is it a group from a forum trying to pump the stock? Or is it just coincidence? Who knows, but I wish there was more reasoned conversation rather than just crazy 'THIS STOCK WILL GO TO 367' claims!"

short the pop!
@sam you missed the dip .
Loving it
"This is another opportunity to short. The runup in the past 7 to 10 days was purely short squeeze to shake out the shorts, then some sympathy with the good tech earnings from FB, GOOGL and AMD. Short right now, just short it."
Let see if market is still irrational. Can't believe they bid this up in early premarket.
anyone defending wayfair in anyway should be looked at like a pedo
"Any longs sitting on juicy profits should cash them in now. It takes effort for market makers to engineer a short squeeze. When the shorts do not respond to the fear, the market makers must undo their work. Meaning, dump shares and the price goes down."
should I sell now i bought in at 30 I feel as if should sell now and take my profits. this stock is very volatile and with its recent history I feel like it could easily go back down to the 30-45 price ranges
Are you guys part of (https:// www.tradenow.xyz)? They just talked about W
let's see how this behaves today..... not quite sure where this is going.
Another negative article that mentions Wayfair. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/retail-stock-darlings-borrowed-time-130010181.html

W is up 6.09% to $112.93
"This is going to be one of those times where they try and #$%$ on our backs and tell us it's raining. They have listed the same products with two very different prices and with different names. Multiple girl names listed have not seen any with boys names yet. The company then issues a statement that everything they are selling is accurately priced!? One person brought up a valid argument that Amazon up charges just so that they can show that they have the product. Does Amazon change the name to make it harder for people to find, do they charge one-thousand times more than the product at cost with low demand?! Absolutely not. These counter arguments have been utterly bogus, and have to backbone. Show me an article that states the answer to my questions and if they can't, this thing will have FBI closure written all over it"
79.79 79.76 79.9 80.56 and then this q of 81.12 cost of revenue just keeps going up every q. Mike do you see a trend? oh yea but sales keep increasing. Up sales up 228 million in q4 from q3 and expenses were up 274. Unreal this is not already at 30. No telling how low it would have been if the big short seller had not covered Friday and trading was not halted for a short period. I am looking for it to be down big next week regardless of what the market does. I hope it goes up early Monday so I can short some more hehe
Gotta luv it! This is the 2020 version of the internet bubble folks. Enjoy the ride while it lasts.
Don't short and get burned. Charts for 416 with resistance at 367.
"$2.7B in long term debt on the books. As soon as the stimulus frenzy dies down and return to work ramps up, W sales continue to decrease. The debt will still be there... you do the math. They barely eeked out an accounting gain last Q as it is"

This has to be one of the biggest stock implosions I’ve seen in some time that wasn’t triggered by fraud. Beautiful.
"CEO dumped big time last week , SELLLLL"
"Nothing will take this down, as you're learning!! I tried to tell you.......watch and learn...."

Every stock that's ever went straight up never came crashing down.
Do we print $200 / share by Friday or Monday? I say Monday..Sorry to the bulls
"Would love to short here (and of course it's being manipulated by insider trading and institutions -- dilution should never raise the share price) but those put premiums are ridiculous.. and let's be honest, this and Tesla are basically unshortable. One day this will fall hard. Tesla, I'm not so sure."
Will end in the red today.
The scary part is this company has very low margins. It’s impossible to be a successful company when you are selling stuff for a 25% markup when your SGA costs are hi due to marketing.
Buddy Mike. How is your long going? Do not mean to be mean. I really hate anybody to lose money. That is why I share my thoughts
RH earnings after the bell. I think it will disappoint and W will sell of. I will buy some puts expiring this week.
This will fall. Eventually

No longer a democrat
"Wouldn't it be amazing to actually know what the heck props this up? It kind of has always fascinated me that in the era of information, these stock price mysteries are never really looked into."
"“The most significant change in the Wayfair story is the rapid margin inflection (~1 year ahead of schedule), driven by scale/cost discipline along with healthy double-digit sales growth,” wrote Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, noting the coronavirus-related sales growth.“While it’s too early to tell how sticky these share gains will be, the combination of EBITDA profitability and sales acceleration makes us incrementally positive.”"
nothing is safer. good move. the best stock to own are the ones that haven't made money in the past 5 yrs.

Yawn....just a little profit taking....very healthy!! And its coming back off its lows as expected ....... could even close green!! Lol....I bought some more on the dip!
Opened new trade at $62 earlier today. And we would consider adding to our long term holdings below $60.
where is Mike since it has free fallen since that bid upgrade he was talking about lol
Swacked on Monday this story is just getting started. Something does not add up
shorted this a month or so ago at 337. rode it all the way down into the 260s. Didn't cover. set a stop loss at 330 so as not to go into the red. Man I wish I set it at 335. Maddening to watch this thing
"fibonacci number system suggests that the next lower leg will be around 149-151. As intermediate drop or correction normally ends in three successions of lower lows, the next lower leg is suggested to be around 131-135. We will see since no ones has a crystal ball."
Motley Drool pumping this again.
I generally do not believe in conspiracy theories but there are many red flags here
This and overstock had their run time to move on next things CTRN blew away earnings under radar see for yourself
what an amazing company!! just think what this stock would do if they actually made money!!??? luckily they dont have to...
wow... TTD up $26 today!! thanks TOM!!
Jim Cramers crew doing the pump and dump while this company has invetment banks getting a secondary offering in place.
Tom I believe you will get filled today. I think we might see $45 today
Just some weak short squeeze money - then down she goes
it was the best quarter they could have ever with the world shut down and stimulus money in pocket. they more or less met expectations or exceeded some.... but it's down from here. we will never shut down again like that. therefore it's a sell going forward. revenue will drop and profits next quarter and quarter after that.
little growth potential but price keep increase. the new trend
10% seems irrational??? Maybe a breather to finish at +7?
"News today. Amzn to Baba have hybrid model online and brick and mortar stores. They think the hybrid model works best for them. May be that is the reason for W to open a store. It also good people to go and check it out, before buying.Today markets are looking so strong. Expect a good close today"
"hope you bought that nice dip!! $145.50 was hard to pass up!!!... only $145 75 now, so you can still buy and make money!!"

Please I challenge you to find one of my posts where I have been wrong."
"This is a great day for investors and the stock markets. Wayfair is getting clipped (needs to drop at least another 50% imo) and good companies with real future earnings are up, like NIKE, UAL, STNE, heck even GE is joining the party.

30 pct up and still losing money?
When do you guys think this trash is going to bust. Shorted at 138

i'm thinking of shorting... any thoughts? The problem is that i actually have 1000 dollars and the minimum charge is 500$ should i take the risk of shorting 50% of my money??
Interesting to watch aftermarket trades. At some point money managers can’t afford not to lock up profits!
I don’t get it was down and up higher than ever? Impossible predicting these stocks just way to dangerous if you don’t buy a great dip buy.
"Downgrade? Wow, thanks for that, Wedbush. Let's see, the top was at 100, you downgrade at 66. Yeah, tell me something I don't know."

Anyone know when Wayfair insider trading window is open/closed? I find it strange that insiders are dumping shares 2 weeks before earnings? Isn't the window 6-8 weeks before earnings?
i can't believe how overvalued this piece of junk is. it isn't amazon. they need to keep advertise to retain customers because they're infrequent purchases. gross margins dog #$%$. it aint amazon. 1 of the best shorts in the market at this valuation.
It's stunning how stupid people can be! Who would ever buy this at $148? Lots of sheep out there.
Even if it weren't true. Who sells cabinets with missing girls names to sell them. This makes me sick.
Why did I listen to Kramer?
I think next day or two are great time to short. Opinions? Just not too big a position to handle another squeeze.
"The burst in furniture spending reminds me of the Bush tax handout of 500 dollars a while back that everyone spent on flat screen tv's because they all went on sale...because there were actually cargo ships full of them that were old models that they needed to move. This is a short term survival nesting move and to think that it will be 'sticky' is delusional. See 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep'...amazing psychology taking place, fighting a viral pandemic with a couch purchase."

"From an employee of WEverything. The pay is SO BELOW market value, its a joke. HR tries to rope new employees in with ""equity"" and lies about the bonus. First off, HR lies about the bonus because they 1- always tell new hires they can ""get up to 10%"", when in reality the high bonus is considered 5-6% AND the bonuses are PRORATED FROM YOUR START DATE. Noone ever tells new hires this, because they are afraid they'll turn down the position once they realize theyll make no money. Also 40% of your bonus gets taken away from taxes, so your left with barely anything. Theres also ZERO ROOM FOR GROWTH OR PROMOTIONs. Management legit says ""someone has to leave for you to get promoted""Advice to ManagementPay your employees better, give them actual perks & incentives."
Just like shop. This is growth stock and we may see profit taking here and there but will move to 400. AMZN will buy these guys eventually that is my prediction

Appears hedge funds no longer have W in portfolio. Even they know this is heading down imho. Timber!
"market goes down this out of season scrap goes up, manipulation is answer."
Oh yea! It keeps falling!!!! :):):)
Did anyone else had a problem shorting this thing? Put a short sell at 82.45 but got rejected.
I still don't think it will finish below 200 today
"Take a look at this 3rd party non-W sponsored reviews before buying W stock or furniture:https://www.resellerratings.com/store/WayfairAlso, spread the word by posting it on social media or any other routes of communication if think the stock price is manipulated and the public has right to know the truth.

"let's be honest, we need a couple quarters without covid fears to see if ""shopping trends changed forever"" as all the talking heads are claiming. so by June 2021 we'll know if this is a real business model or not. Based on the last 10 years they've operated I'm to believe it will go back how it was."
Look at the spread in after hours. Today was supposed to be the cherry on their short squeeze sunday and the market had other plans!. They are going to force margin calls tomorrow AM to run this higher but after that if the market sell off continues it could be time to short this in their faces! I would not cover and would def add to shorts tomorrow after the morning 3-5 dollar run-up. Lets hope the mkt sell-off continues!
Many Chinese companies manipulated their IPO and stock price. Mayfair needs investigation. 146-177 in 3 days without any positive/negative news? Who is buying and who sold before that? On what news the insiders are buying/selling?

"like I said, same pattern every day!! watch and learn!.....dips first thing, then turns green for the day..."
I will answer the last few posts! 70% of the stock is institutional owned therefore you?re going to have by ratings when the actual stock is worth 165 a share! To NPD?s point #$%$ 1.5 ? 100% of revenue goes to 100% of expenses. No stock can sustain this period. You will know the direction down when the stock is 2% down for the day and the volume is higher than the previous day! This stock could be $35.00. 2 years from now easy
"By Friday next week, this would drop below $150. No reason for it to be jumping around this price anymore."
Why it’s UP today
"Just shorted 2,000 share of this pig  at $129.60. Easy money "
MarketWatch article indicates $0.16 / profit would have been a $0.30 loss but for new accounting system adopted 1/1/2021.
$10 up on very low volume. Disaster coming soon. Hold rating at $120 max.
Not even 1/2 normal volume. Overvalued.

"It is sad that we have to rely on fake news to move the stock down while the real, abysmal, earnings should speak for itself."
Time to load up.
"What @Larry is pointing out is that Wayfar is expected to lose $800+ million in 2020 and slightly less than $700 million in 2021. That combined $1.5bln is above the cash on hand that Wayfair currently has. That means more borrowing...and at less favorable rates than the FOUR previous capital injections they've previously received. More debt payments equals more expenses equals lower profit.Just look at the insider trading...they have execs selling shares at every opportunity. They are given a large chunk of shares one one day, and then a few days later when their blackout period is lifted they jettison them....CFO, CTO, Officers...every single quarter this happens regardless of the share price. If they believed in the company why would they be cashing out tens of thousands of shares at low prices and leaving potential millions on the table?!?!The Rock says ""IT DOESN'T MATTER if they're revenue is increased for the past few months due to COVID-19. As of the previous quarter, their SG&A is 12% above their gross profit %."" The Rock says ""You jabronis better cash out your long positions now while you've made a profit cause the ghost of Dusty Rhodes says ""hard times"" are coming!"""

"If the market ever decides to have a red day again, this will fall very fast. It is just being held up by the market and algorithms because of low volume. Most of the stock is shorted so not many sellers at this point. Also NO buyers at all. It will fall very fast."
"People want to buy new furnishings for their ""savvy social feeds"" and Wayfair is booming because of this. Everyone is tuning into the ""new trends"" on social media and they see things on their ""influencer"" feeds and so they want to buy them and also make videos with those same things. Things like new home accents and so you can be in the new trends. This is great for Wayfair as people cannot go to stores normally so will be looking to the social influencers to set the stage for the new products."

But I do not like the fact that the underlying stock that I wrote the calls against (I bought for $45.00) is also declining in value. Any advice? Get out altogether and just short W? I have been selling covered calls each week without an exercize for a long time now. Looks like its changed!"

Explain how W has doubled this year. No profit. Losses doubled from last year.
over last few weeks this board is drowning with newbies. All of them act like they have been in this since 28$ lol. All they say is shorty gone byebye shorty. All these trend players. I have a funny feeling if it went to 160$ half of them would be under water. LOL

Walking up on no volume again.... what a suprise
This is probably the most over valued stock in the market. Their insiders sell millions worth of shares on a weekly basis? Do you?
Look at all the stocks on the SP's most vunerable list. All priced like bankruptcy is likely....but not W....hmmmm

So dangerous to be holding wayfair here. So dangerous if u are long. This is the redzone
"All it takes is 2-3 large funds dropping this, and it’s game over for the $200s."
So the 170 price point has been reached...like I said previously I see this hitting 150s as a bottom which is still super expensive...
it was a $24 stock back in mid-march completely over valued and not worth anywhere near $150. If you are holding at this level you are nuts. Be below $100 sometime soon. I'm short from $185
That’s how you make $$$ tiny float stock! Trade the trend. You will always make money on the short squeeze!
"This is a train wreck waiting for oil on board to explode, SHORT to the max.No response to Debt refinancing and how much did it draw down from credit facilities last week.Waiting for the 8-k"

Way fair sales does not equal profit after so many years it is not in positive how the share climb more then $323 it does not make sense
Honestly seeing W correcting gives me a sick sense of enjoyment. I was eyeing their financials for months and being valued so highly with so many financial pitfalls just left me confused.
"Tom, I tried to tell you........ you just keep going further in the red! give it up!! take your losses and make them up going long... its the only logical thing to do...."
"Boy this board is biased toward shorting. Remember the trend is your friend. What you guys don't get is that money is cheap now, govt. giving it away and interest rates are at historic lows so investors have no problem buying stocks that may offer potential ( tesla, shopify, even Amazn 150 pe). I am not comparing W to these stocks but only stating that valuations are out of whack right now and why not ride the train."
very overdue correction. The $230 conversion is over. In a year this will be back to garbage status. Wayfair has more debt than ever and now a credit card line to manage!
At what price point does the cost of artificially propping up this stock outweigh the benefits?
"People are confusing high beta with losses. This stock surprised to the upside last week. It is a high growth, eCommerce stock. It has wide swings by nature. If you can't stomach that, you should not be in it. That waht ""investing is"". This stock will reward over the mid term. This is 100% diff't than losing money. As quickly as this stock adjusted WITH the ENTIRE market today, it will adjust upward.Keep in mind. No more oracle want to be Fauci in the future and no more Powell for a month. So what do institutional investors do? They buy. Wayfair to $200+ in 1 week. Good luck to all."

I'm not sure how this is still around 155 but it takes time to sell off pumped money carefully. Investors are going to reposition themselves for low PE large cap stocks and well run smaller companies with wide margins and future growth. Wayfair has not shown a single profitable quarter since the IPO.
how could this go up??they had lost -0.91EPS vs Consensus -0.89 EPS VS last year -0.48.Anyone?
"yawn....... going to be on the road today, then a funeral..........I know you'll miss me. you'll just have to struggle thru it..... didnt want you rubes to think I was hiding just in case W goes down today......."

"Stock just went up 9 billion from one time lockdowns but there still no profits. This is absurd . If the company had a one time windfall of a billion or 3 billion, well that might warrant a share price bump in the amount of the windfall. This is dumb"
It's sell as Covid vaccine is approved. Furniture stores r opening. Returns be most expensive.
"Ever wonder why Zack’s is always pumping W??? I just lifted and pasted this exactly right from a Zack’s article today “Wayfair, which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry”"
"So, once people start heading out of their caves, Wayfair sales go where? They had a freak thing happen, but it's going to last. People don't want to stay home and play with Amazon, Netflix, etc... They want to live again. Wayfair up here is out and out dangerous."
i told you cover your short
stock does not fall = manipulation. low volume daily and price appreciates = accumulation.accumulation + manipulation = short destruction. see you at 250 after earnings on aug 5!
higher highs......strong close......easy call where this is going.....lmao... fight it if you want...... not me!
"the convertible note was known in April. http://www.globallegalchronicle.com/wayfair-inc-s-535-million-convertible-note/#:~:text=Wayfair%2C%20one%20of%20the%20world's,principal%20amount%20of%20%24535%20million.&text=One%20of%20Wayfair's%20largest%20public,Spruce%20House%20Partnership%2C%20also%20participated."
Wayfair will never see $195 again. Should see $100 in a couple months or less.
When they say they have 26 millions active customers do you think it is food business or groceries that they order again and again. This is furniture on line how may buy furniture everyday. People may browse but does not buy their ad on tv and other media eat cashflow. big boys and mutual fund is dragging up and sucking small new investor and bring down like March $21 price
"TOM, TTD up 31% in last 11 trading sessions !! low float stock.... dangerous!! so I shorted more today at $253... :)...getting a little hairy ...."

"This company has so much potential. The wife and I are very happy with the two lazy boy recliners we just purchased. One of them I’m sitting in right now had an issue with the track to have the back portion slide onto when putting together and we were able to figure out a way to get it together but emailed them prior to figuring out the defect. Wayfair offered to replace the entire recliner but after we told them not to worry about it because it ended up being ok they credited us back $100 for the trouble we had. This is the way to run a business people. They found a customer for life with us and I will remain loyal so long as they keep up the good work. One of friends spent a ton on curtains for his newly built house and kept telling everyone at work how amazing they are. Building relationships is what it’s all about. This will go to $300 or more in the next few years, I’m sure of it."
"Of the 20 things I've bought from Wayfair since Saturday, one is a work bench with a vise mount...Using it to squeeezzeee shorty!!! LOL"
"Sam, covered . Hope it bounces it back so can short it."
"Wayfair had hardly scratched the surface in Europe. They expect revenue to go up 8x by 2030. They are cranking out operating cashflow of 1 billion a quarter now. If you 8x revenue and throw a 10% net profit margin on that. That would be 10 billion profit per year. Throw a 15 p/e and we get to a 150 billion market cap from the current 28 billion ish. So a 5 bagger from here. 1,500 per share "
Massive market selloff and wayfair just goes higher!!! Soon it will own the world......
"AH action is not indicative of tomorrow move. most likely will see up day tomorrow with the news. it is true that the more sales, they are likely to lose more on revenue. but daily stock action is news driven"
"Morning, today price any guess?"
Insiders purchased millions of shares. This will fly to $200. Strong action for today in a bad market.$200 here we come.
for that super low pre hours
W behaves like the next AMZN or trades like AMZN will buy them ...it's just another furniture company. Sooner or later this will loose 70% value as people realize. They are valued based on number of people register on their site ? Really.
Andrew Left Criton Research Just now said the Company is almost bankrupt Going to 40 USD
Going to 5.00 on MONDAY
got our 40.. now 35 baby
Bad stock
"Yet another day when it climbs rapidly in the first couple of hours and then sits flat the rest of the day....Tiny float companies are so easy to manipulate when a group communicates illegally together to buy/sell the name ""en masse"". But these private equity companies and large fund holders of W would never do something like that, would they?"
$130 the end of week
Stocks related to housing are getting crushed. W is hanging tough. Wouldn’t think a internet ordering furniture company would be rallying right now.
"Wow, the first open in a long time (literally months) where we have seen heavy selling from the open with half decent volume..."
W is a safety stock for sure......only goes up.... people will start selling Coke and Pepsi and flock to W for the safety...not to mention the triple digit growth every year!!
Doubled up at $145! W won't let me down...
Looks like its bottoming out and finding support back at the levels end of last year/start of this year. Looks to be a nice pop
Sell off continues right before earnings
It's all about pump and dump. No fundamental here
Can the nyse activity in a stock be managed so shares can be dumped at a higher price in the dark pools? Is that what happened on 11/19?
If we can break 280 this could easily finish <260 today
Support at 214 wait for it to break then bye bye
"As economy reopens...not all over. And more folks are buying online anyway. I've ordered from Wayfair, it's not that bad"
lmao...bought 300 more shares on the dip this morning.....already up $600 on them in 2 minutes!! lmao....told you....same pattern every day....ill sell them before the end of the day.....watch and learn sheeples!!! same pattern every day like ive been telling you.....some people you just cant help!!
"This stock is a SELL based on both fundamentals and technical measures. The only possible positive is CONTRARIAN, that it's so bad that it's good. If that makes any sense. SELL."

sell off start at 12PST?
I called this all day long! They are issuing almost 3B dollars at $230 price tag. $70 below current price because they know it will tank that fast. Haha haha

What just happened ?
"CEO Niraj Shah and co-founder Steve Conine are selling more shares again, just one short week after their last batch of sales. They each sold roughly $990,000 at $106.80 on December 10. The quarter must going well for them to demonstrate such high conviction."
I took a chance not selling 170 puts expiring tomorrow !! but I made a huge mistake by selling the 180 puts yesterday. Holding my June monthly puts
"AMZN down 8% after reporting strong Covid online growth. Do you really think W will perform better than the king in the biz?In my opinion, the only thing propping W up is the tiny float and an illegal consortium phoning each other to prop it up. No proof of course, just calling it as I see it."
Massive problems with W's website yesterday and today...causing lots of lost sales and ticked off customers seeking to return defective goods and cartons missing pieces......this is going to cost them $$$$$
Bought 9000 shares at $27 in March
BS report. Listening to this I am sure this stock will see double digits. Those institutions that bought at 100 and up will get hammered
"Below the $150 area!!! What?!!! This is a $10 Trillion (with a ""T"") company! Worth easily $80,000 / share..."
"Q1 loss report (aka earnings) out on May 5. Consensus is a loss of $2.60 per share. Zacks is predicting a loss beat ( aka earnings). So really, whats the difference between $2.60 loss and say $2.00 loss? Wayfair loses money, the more they sell the more they lose. sales=loss=debt."
who is buying right now?
Micron has fabulous results with great forecast and it's price is dropping daily. Wayfair losses increase more than expected and it's up nearly 7% pre market.! I need to get out of the stock market as I obviously am missing something.
Can't believe the price on that stock...it can't last long..
Just sold waiting below 100.00
"Looks like the 200 level triggered Zacks to try to rally some more buyers. Amazing how there are buyers for a company that has never made a profit in the more than 10 years of its existence, has a negative book value and a high debt ratio. I just noticed the < 1 current ratio from last quarter. Good thing they got that April cash infusion to keep them afloat. At their cash burn rate, this can't end well. No wonder there are lots of insider sales."
Tremendous volume over the last hour..True hitters getting involved. In size...
Great quater and even surprising good profit. Question is sustainability and I think they score 0 there. Let's see how market react. Will they make this 400 stock or 200. My opinion worth < 100 if growth does not sustain.
"wayfair in Hostile takeover of Buffets Berkshire Hathaway, ready to sell soon, what a Laugh!!"

The short are quite. 15+ expected?? Looks like it
the curse is still in effect! I took this down.....
Most bearish candle I have seen for a long time. Just levered up on my short.
Zacks should be investigated by the SEC they literally have written 3 puff pieces for this stock every day for the last three weeks! How is that legal!
"Finally my 2020 out of the money puts are very near the money, also easy money "
Anyone shorting or buying TSLA at this over price ? Pls share .
"you have to remember three a lot of weak shorts in this that cant take the run up. some are on margin, some just cant take the pain. they drive this up when they panic or have to cover.......if the float wasn't so low, this wouldn't happen .....but it is!! LOW FLOAT is a killer for shorts."

"Are investors here also satisfied Wayfair customers? My first order with them quickly went wrong. When I search for reviews of their service, the number of horror stories online shocked me. Good stock, bad company?"
I sold 4 free $$$ expires I make $600
I think it hits bottom!!
Shorted 323's I can't believe this stock is above 200 let alone 300
Called it close over 200
"Sorry to see TOM go broke. nice guy, just didn't understand, I guess. shorted at $141.12.... the rest is history! I tried to help him, but what can I do??? it has to hurt........"
W is fight to stay above 118.
It’s going to drop to 170-175 tomorrow Then one more drop and settle around 140s which is still expensive but that will be a near term bottom.
has anyone actually looked at the website for Wayfair. The first thing you see is 70% off. That doesn't sound like a company that is healthy. I think their sales are nothing but fake news because I think they're not reporting all the returns. Margins are terrible with furniture stores that's why so many of them have going out of business sales.
This stock is done
Come on baby dont stop
What will be the price for it after ER? What's your guess?
Having a difficult time understand ing how this stock went up so much today? Short covering or what?
What a farce market. 6.6 million jobs lost and up 2%.
Wayfair (W) initiated at Buy y Deutsche Bank. (1/29/19(
Cant get shares to short this morning!
"this will go bankcrupt, they are losing money at the fastest rate! shares become worthless"
"If you bought furniture during the first lockdown, why buy again? Someone explain how this demand won't fall off."
"Questions: 1, The CEO on the ER conference call said W had received good reviews and feedback from loyal repeated clients and new customers, which appears to be contradict to what can be found on Google. The high ratings on Google only comes from the W-sponsored sites, but majority unbiased customer reviews have been very negative, especially most recent ones. The CEO also said their customer service was excellent, but most customers said otherwise. How come? 2, They had 80% off sales running through the end of last month, which could boost their revenue, but will hurt their profit margin. Also, W has been encountering high rate of product return due to poor quality, discrepancy between what is shown online and what is received etc. How can they become profitable? Look forward to some thoughtful thinking, not emotional postings. Thanks."
"Call it what you will, this stock is in a bubble. But it's a short dominated bubble wherein every uptick in price shakes a short off the tree to buy which further drives the price upwards. Algos are good at this. It will end one day when everyone notices the king has no clothes."
Volume is drying up each day since earnings. Up on low volume is not a strong indication for a stock. Along with a CRAZY RSI of almost 86. This will definitely correct.Analysts reports on valuation are ridiculous. They will manipulate and contrive any metric to work into their targets. Never understood the value of an analyst. It's not like they are even 50% right. How many analysts tell you to sell before a stock collapses - none?
Sell now and reserve your ego. You can tell your kids you sold W above 300.
M U R DER ED
Gonna close green and above $125 today
That Dump was gorgeous stop losses are getting triggered back to under $100
Target raised to $400 by Wall Street;
"It is rare you get a short opportunity as good as this! Looking at the chart, the 50MA has been supported the whole way up on this run, but has broken since yesterday, hence I am pretty sure we have started on our downtrend. I imagine the majority of shorts were squeezed out with the recent highs - does anyone have data on open shorts?PS. If there are any holders left, I advise to sell ASAP!"
Record loss announcement tomorrow.
Buy the dip again!! $143 has been support all along......
The puts just went off at the ask. Someone is buying big time puts at end of day.
My ? How does Wayfair stay in biz and how will it make profit. 8 weeks ago bought full size mattress arrived in box. After it unfolded and slept on week we kept rolling to center-called W and they said keep. Will send you pillow top and it was 42.00 cheaper...they gave us credit sent new mattress. The pillow top edges didn't hold up. Called customer service talked about other mattress. Decided to wait and W gave us full refund. We got two mattresses at cost of 700.00 plus. We got them w/o cost. Our grandkids picked up..they are grad students and problems with bed didn't matter. They will sleep on fir couple years.
Is this the money pit where the dumpster fire will be held in 2021?
"Here we go again, all you shorts are desperate! Oh yes, listen to Cramer and the analysts, like they have ever been right about anything:)Sounds like many of you have shorted this at 40-70 range! Hope you are making lots of money :):)Stock will go up, sexy stock; who cares about professional analysts that make 50 k a year!"
bubble
just bought more puts. LOL this is crazy. I guess they pumping market up for the downturn Thurdsay and Friday when job reports start coming out. Most of Texas locked down. W can not even ship lol
i love how all the analyst continue with buy ratings but keep lowering their target as the stock falls lol. Their clients are unloading while sheep like Mike keep looking at them having a buy rating with a 30% upward target price. It is never a good sign when they lower their target price. They will be in dire need of another round of funding in six months if not longer. Depends on how fast their overseas operations is bleeding money. If it is anything like here it will be sooner. The problem is this time they will no be able to go the bond route. Nobody will write them when they have never shown a profit. This is not a tech play. Been a good ride from 175. It may bounce up a little here and there but will be 30 this time next year if not sooner
"Holycow, I didn't expect this. It's amazing they pulled this up close to $120 last Friday (option!!!) andthen drop it today like this.So much manipulation going on... WS crooks."
This defies gravity. W to 400 then?
Low volume on the way going up... tomorrow the shorts reap the Rewards !!
"Put options bought for 140 expiring in 3 weeks, let's see what happens!"

"It's no longer FANG stocks..... now it's WANG stocks.... Wayfair, Apple,Netflix, and Google. ......Facebook is tossed to the sidelines..."
I take it shorts moved to Twitter for now?
I take it the Shorts are covering their positions and prepping for their next short at $300? looks like it's worked twice this year for them.
Benjo is selling weekly calls on everything. He is a hedge fund.
"Classic W, pops to >$300, completely falls apart. Its a trading stock, never hold too long either short or long."
another squeeze to new highs?
Dotcom bubble for an online furniture company.
"Loooooongs!!! This pos is toast, RUN !!!!"
This can easily close at 178 by end of day. Coty just give up all its gains today.
Fundamentals are not great for this. But technicals are too good.. don't short it now.. you might be lucky if market goes down otherwise this is moving up higher.. nice volume on todays move.. look for a reversal for atleast 3 days in a row to short further.. i would say buy some puts for next quarter results.. nothing before that..
Dumped everything I had. Better go out on a high note
This is the best stock ever!!! Better then ENRON!!
Be careful Wayfair’s Shorts are smart - jack up price with low volume to set up the pump and dump just before Earnings
breakout again @70 this week...imho
"Stay long Wayfair. Yeah, right. A bloated joke."
Way fair owns Castlegate and 17 million sq feet of warehouse.. Amazon is now using Waifair
how much can it go down with one downgrade? more downgrades?
"This is a massive short squeeze. Big hands are forcing the weak hands to cover their short positions. There are so many shorts in at such lower prices, that there are now panicking that they will lose everything. Actually, a good job done by the big hedge funds to destroy the small retail short investor.Criminal hedge funds, but smart."
Insane how small the volume is on the green candles
This is an amazing stock for traders! Too bad I don't own a share
"If you feeling fear of height, take some profit. Remember their main business is selling furniture and home finishing items.Their earning are very good but if you search recent reviews, you will realized that Profit is engineering though bad customer service. They making every bit effort to make return harder. Return are hardest part and eat up profit. If anyone ask me about earning vs customer experience what matter more. I can blindly say customer experience and It is very very bad for sure.If you don't trust do google search and find out your self. I think this will translate to lower or even negative growth from here."
W currently has 2.51B in debt. Does anyone know their earliest debt maturation date?

"I was down -$10k now down only -$1k, I think it’s time for us Put placers/ shorts to make big bucks out of this tilray looking garbage. I now have a $100k Put position which expires on Nov"
"This is down over 10% on a fantastic day for the indices. What happens on a mediocre day.. or a bad day.Still time to get out if you bought over $100. Even at $100 this is grossly overvalued. Don't be upset you could have sold over $180.. just accept reality. Once Wayfair figures out how to turn a profit, we will be making our own 3D-printed furniture and pigs will be flying - just not this one."
"GUYS, ALMOST 50% FLOAT SHARES ARE SHORTED, THIS BUBBLE IS EVEN BIGGER THAN BEYOND MEAT TO THE HIGHEST , BITCOIN TO THE HIGHEST! BURSTING HARDCORE WILL SOON TO COME!"

"Wayfair ( W ) extended its recent gains, rising almost 7% in late Monday trading, after Wedbush earlier raised its price target for the online retailer by 20% to $120 a share. The brokerage also kept its neutral rating for Wayfair ( W ) stock, explaining the company Friday warned its Q1 net loss will nearly double Q4 levels despite an expected 34% to 37% year-over-year increase in revenue during the current quarter."

Google WAYFAIR FURNITURE NAMES RELATED TO ABDUCTED KIDS... this is all 2020 news... they’re done
This company better have positive earnings and revenue this quarter to keep this valuation. Don’t give us 2021 positive bs. Stock over 200 better be making a boat load of money and analysts better raise that damn bar to reflect that

insiders selling like no tomorrow
"At Home Group upgraded to Buy at Monness Crespi & Hardt; tgt $20 (15.00 ) : Monness Crespi & Hardt upgrades HOME to Buy from Neutral and sets target price at $20. Analyst Jim Chartier said, ""After a 36% post-earnings sell-off, we believe At Home is attractively valued at 5x EBITDA. We expect strong trends in the home category will continue through next year and HOME's big box, off-mall, value store model is perfectly positioned for the current environment. In addition, market share gains from competitor store closings, continued expansion of its omni-channel offerings and improved execution provide additional comp sales tailwinds. The company's balance sheet is significantly improved (1.4x leverage a record low), the concept remains underpenetrated and At Home will return to 10% store growth in FY22. While the stock has performed well this year, the company's valuation remains well below its historical level of 10+x EBITDA."""
Trend is bullish on this. I see hitting new highs.

A $240 sale doesn't look good coming down from $245 but looks different from $235. Gaslighting, tape painting, you get it all."
"If you search Wayfair review, you will found out that the reviews are terrible from any third party. I think they made up reviews on their own website. And their customer service is really bad."
"Morning Sam, did you add more short this morning ?"
"sure hope you bought the dip again!! if you did, you made money again! simple as that!! love this stock!!"
"$w caught up in a child trafficking scandal, time to short this, enjoy"
I would expect a lot of short covering tomorrow....
Pn can we see $36 today or am I just too greedy and need to sell lol. I have some puts expiring this week. I want to ride it till tomorrow but greed has bit me so many times. I guess I am going to sell and be glad if it goes down more lol
"This company has about three more quarters of cash to burn through at their current rate. Negative EBITDA for all of 2017, negative through 09/30/18."
Long way to go to 80
"No earnings per share and $100.00 over valued, just be careful the shorts will be slamming this one very soon."
"Wayfair is recession proof, tariff proof, and competition proof..... ..oh, and profit proof!!! lmao..... what a stock! best ive ever seen in 40 years!"
temporary stimulus boost for a couple quarters but now a lot of people are hurting. why would sales be good in q4?
This is going to get shellacked on Monday. Sell before this goes back under $100. Story is only getting worse.
Who is their accounting firm?
All W products are from China! Wait till the rebellion comes!
Told you $190 would it today. $185 tomorrow as we slowly side back to $150.
"Just hear about W on CNBC, but to me is way to pricey and the earnings are starting to miss. Lock in profits and be happy! Good luck!"
"W, balloon pops in days"
Got out at $308 on monday. Phew what a relief!!
IKEA opens stores world wide:https://www.ingka.com/news/coronavirus-temporary-ikea-store-closures-re-opening-details/Including several in the US:https://www.jaxdailyrecord.com/article/ikea-reopens-for-in-store-shopping-in-jacksonvillehttps://www.ktnv.com/news/coronavirus/ikea-las-vegas-has-reopened
Why is W up so much today? Thanks
"This is a unbelievable valuation. Pay $100 million per quarter to Google to get sales, only to lose tons of money. No plans to change the model? When this market ever tanks, this is six dollar stock. Shorted 100 shares-- won;t look at it all. When the bubble bursts, it's a free $10K profit. Cannot believe some of these high flying loser stocks in this 2001-like bubble"
Who’s buying online when you can go shopping at local retailer now New York opening this week
I like how this stock shot up on news of more stimulus . So the money being sent to the people is suppose to be for them to pay bills and buy food but yet we think they will buy home furnishing instead and mainly from Wayfair . The amount of sales Wayfair seen last year was not mainly from the original stimulus money but from wealthier families stuck at home . This stock is one of the biggest bubbles out there and very dangerous to trade long or short but is you have deep pockets and can stand some possible short term pain shorting this dog will pay off in the end .
Hold on a sec...Never profitable and increasing annual net loss for years approaching -$1B? No dividend.What is going on here? Where is the value? Do they have a cloud? Please anyone give me the rationale.
Maria Ripps (Canaccord Genuity) Buy 11/02/18 $150.00Revenue exploding.Money will flow in... Insiders are too busy counting $.
"According to the market today this should be about 800 a share... No profit, and overvalued.. Don't people know that furniture businesses go out of business all the time because in an depressed economy people are not buying... even online.."
Looks like wayfair is going to make another run!! Time to take profit on my protective puts...
Classic Wayfair ultra low trading volume and always going up on nothing
such low volume makes it easy to manipulate.
"Following stock may never go down.W, NVDA, BAND, TWLO, VEEV, AMZN, ZM, NFLX, FSLY, ETSY, Z, CVNA, FVRR, DDOG, DOCU, GOOGL, MSFT, AAPL, COUP, MDB, OKTA, CHGG, AMD.earnings dont matter,nasdaq shall go up indefinitely. get long and buy calls."
craziest bubble
"if I'm using a global consumer interface platform like Amazon or Wayfair that sells millions of products between third parties, it is highly feasible to move cash in packaged products i.e cabinets at a high fixed cost. The third party could also hold accounts for customers moving money as well. All accounts could be identified and accessed by users for the specific product name and the sku etc. any investigations would look at these companies to see if they have had any purchases/transactions on these ""accurately priced items"". The concerning part to me is the defending statement that 20k plus pillow covers are reasonable and acceptable by Wayfair. From the Amazon standpoint, I don't understand with AI and preventative measures in place for price gauging on items, how it's acceptable to have comparable items be 10000% higher than the average price. It's a big lack of oversight and allows for these platforms to aid in laundering or trafficking."
remember sheeples.....buy the dip!
Jonas / MS trading desk will keep this elevated so they can do a convert / sell common in next couple of weeks...
W going green baby!! too funny!
I expected this big boy will down 20%+
absurd stuff here
Read S.A for their analysis and well researched. W is on its way to Bk in 2021.
"""K"" 's post is a very good read. Its all based on fact's and verifiable. I am short W"
"The stock price needs correcting. Technically. The fundamentals are not good. Buying cheap stuff from China will be on a down trend. Short squeeze and e commerce helped it,but now downtrend is in the cards."
"most of the stuff are wayfair are overprized and cheaply made anyway, they will lose more and more money"
"a mRNA announcement will bring this to $190, but not sure what happens from there. probably bought up heading until holiday online shopping season"
"I was thinking, W may have a problem long term selling genuine high-end products above a certain a price point (say $7000++) because of people’s uncertainty about its real worth/value. Idk if these high end items play a significant part of their revenue or not; I imagine most people buy cheap stuff from there. But I think in the long run people may just want to avoid their real quality items because they want to avoid any potential craziness behind the scenes"
"like I said, W is a defensive stock for market downturns!! lmao....market down, W goes up!! market up, W goes up! its a beautiful thing!! cover your shorts and go long....enjoy the ride..."
i just bought puts so 200 EOD...smh
W UP 70% IN 20 DAYS
"Return to about $80, the pre covid level?"
Just buy puts as soon as market opens
"Covered my short postion after credit Suisse gave them a buy and over preform rating, makes me wonder if they were the fund that bought 42,000 shares at 188$ no longer trust the analysts price targets, their in Switzerland have they ever shopped or brought anything from wayfair overpriced junk? That breaks apart?!??? Makes no sense to me, all I know is that this will be a bubble now after they gave it a price target of 230$ which is insane, they have to be holding or brought shares..."
"such a symbol of grotesque, indiscriminate spending on non durable ""durable"" goods from countries we've never seen while our domestic quality furniture stores can't even open their doors."
Remember when all insiders sold for low 200’s in July ...why? surprise!!! Just issued $230 shares for 3 billion bucks.Nice dilution bag holders ! Next will be investigation for the money laundering for child traffickers allegations
"Can't say this wasn't expected, the amount of bounce back is a little much though..."
We sold our swing trade position at $102.50 this am. 65% profit in a little over five weeks.Thanks Wayfair...you got just what I need!!!
Just bought some puts. Thanks for the bump up last two trading days. Back down we go hehe
"Should hit $170 Monday as investors head for safety.....yawn....hope you sheep learned something last few weeks.....never go against me!! You'll lose...I understand stocks and how they trade....I study them, and I never lose, as you're learning !!"
New Morningstar analyst report released. $95 PPS is their fair value estimate.
Soon the rug will be pulled and everyone will be clamoring for the exits. 30+ million unemployed cannot afford rent no less useless furniture
going up through the roof... bye bye short
TOM! You still short? Are you long TTD?
"Time to go, see you under 130"
"Is this thing shorted much, any chance of a squeeze with the pump?"
"wayfair to the moon, profits raining from here forward"
Going up
Another short squeeze like TTD. No wonder so many hedge funds that are value oriented are going out of business these days. Never short stocks that are in uptrend and have tailwinds behind them...
"market cap of the likes of F, NOK, ERIC."
People have moved on from this momentum trade. Selling to late arriving retail.
$250 by close Friday
Another day of no volume.........hmmmm
Bought it at $47 and will be selling later this month just in time to go Christmas shopping
"10% drop easy in one day =$297 , another 10% would the be now $258- easy as pie , lots off exposure in this company ,dilution , insider manipulation, bad ratings, etc..."
"As expected my comment got deleted.My search for Wayfair review (I just started yesterday) way worst than I ever thought possible for such large online retailer.If you invested here, atleast do some search and make decision. Don't trust analyst or stock price as reason to invest. They sure pumping and Result might sure great but if they have volume of problem I am seeing in reviews, it's going to create huge problem within 6 month."
just wondering why wayfair pulled the items so quickly if there was no truth to it.... makes them look guilty even if it's a wild conspiracy theory
when 230 breaks there is weak support at 210/200. then 190. the next strong support isn't until 135-155 from the May earnings
the biggest C0#k tease of a premarket ive ever seen. up 18% after earnings release and now up 3% after conf call.
"$18,000 bet let’s see by August"
@Sam at what price will you unload your shares and are you a day trader? Thx.
"Took the profit from Wayfair and move the money to ""ANGI"".Wayfair ran from $26 per share to $176.72! ANGI will run from $9 to $90 per share soon!"
Headed for 200. Do not under estimate short squeezes.The big boys kill retail shorts.Next TSLA
right at 134 is very heavy resistant. Let see if it can break through.
"I warned everyone not to invest in W, now you guys lost a fk ton of money."
Rich Democrats
"Kevin many many stocks are fixed. It’s a given, but you must join them! Don’t fight them! This stock is the most manipulated of all I watch. Think long term and the manipulation will not go against you!"
Andrew Left just knocked on my door.... he was asking if I had any odd jobs he could do...... guess he's homeless now after shorting W.... I told him no..... and Andrew Left.
Sell off happening with Nasdaq and Dow in the last 20 minutes...pulling W back down
Turn W upside down and buy M
Longs will suffer greatly. It's not like wayfair is going to make self driving furniture
Should we hold thru earnings? Honest opinions
It’s only gonna get worse
$66 and change. Game changer. New ticker POS
W now green.....dip buyers have been rewarded as predicted. Another easy call.... take your profits today.
"In my opinion, soon W will announce they issued shares to raise capital behind the scenes. Most likely at a price well below $200 which will dilute the current value. This company has a huge amount of debt and had NEVER made a profit in over a decade. It’s current run is nothing more than free Fed money (not really free btw, we will all pay severely for this with huge inflation in coming years) and hype."
"This has no reason being in the 160s, 150s, not even the triple digits. Wayfail."
"Very good earnings, but--down? That's not good."
"Dave, serious question for you, as I respect your vision and valuation skills.Do you think wayfair will go after TSLA, once they take down amazon? Tsla is tanking hard. They could get them cheap and they both have similar philosophies about making money and running a company.....just seems like a great do fit... your thoughts?"
Forward earnings yield: .23% (that's POINT 23 percent...lol).
"I see people here talking about the stock Worthing this or that, but they truly don't know what they talk about , because if they knew, the stock would be completely down. The estimates is for ""major earnings achievement this quarter"" so why would go that low? hm."
there's really no reason to own any other stocks !! just borrow everything you can and buy W....
"back to 100 in a week, what goes up quick it goes down quicker"
W- any one care to tell how much returns will cost??
Shorted at $323.... Finally it's down now hopefully it stays there :D
"wayfair going to come back yet today..... lows should be in for the day at $144.52..... I had a buy in at $144.50 and if course, it didnt hit! off the table now."
"China markets down 4+% so this will not be good for Wayfair. Maybe an 8-10% drop and it could get worse with the uncertainty of retaliation from China. If things turn sour for you, I suggest investing in Gilead. A company that has multi billion annual earnings, pays a dividend, and makes drugs that some very old, sick, and unlucky people need to survive or have a better life. Don't hold on to a furniture company with thin margins and increasingly negative earnings every year. Are there even real people who invest anymore.. or is it dominated by institutions and algos"
i smell something bigger than a bitcoin bubble here
"Picked another 1,000 at $132.85... short position of course. Now have 3,000 shares short. If not this Friday next week after the Fed hype things will turn red again. Just watch boys and learn."
Could easily close below 168 today. They snagged all the shorts that could not withstand the short squeeze.
"I bought a small Put position yesterday but just bought heavy today when it hit $105. Nothing is guaranteed in the market, but I really like my chances here"
"W is behaving like last time, rose before earnings and fell after. Pattern looks the same. But you have to be a strong short to earn money from this kind of volatility"
what does Wayfair do with all the returned items?
I have to give credit to Shah and participating fund managers. Epic execution of insider selling and share buybacks to suck the company dry
Sure mgmt would like to thank all longs that bought last Friday in the $330s. Quite a 1 week drop to the $260s. Dilution.
"If Tesla can have a market cap of $160 billion with all factories closed and no product pipeline whatsoever, then Wayfair should be at least $50 billion. Analysts are such pu $$ iez with their $220 target prices. W should be at least $400 today with that $1 billion annual loss they manage to sustain quite nicely."
"They should change the name of this stock to ""SAM"""
"311,000 shares traded during the morning charade as it clings to 225. My favorite wayfair trading move is when it jumps a dollar higher than the shown bid and ask."
Even best of breed cannot up 6 pct but this trash is ? Totally manipulated. Wiping out all put options that expire today
Let's do it again tomorrow! !
"this is not safe haven for stock market anymore, there's so much traditional retail stock start to rebound, means all the e-commerce stock that take advantage on lock down will sink in record speed, sell as fast as you can or risk getting trapped permanently with this overvalue stock"
moved my profits to WISH
Is there any news if FBI are going to step in?
publicly announced since April. https://www.greathillpartners.com/pe-hub-behind-the-scenes-of-wayfairs-535m-loan-from-great-hill-charlesbank/
This thing is being manipulated too much and will crash very soonSell and buy OSTK you will see 10x better returns.
"yes, W is a great defensive stock in a falling market, as you are seeing! more will migrate to the safety of WAYFAIR!...its common sense."
"All these negative posts( short sellers??) really!Stock dropped to $29 and now back to $115!. Made a fortune with options on this. A real no brainer, Web- based company dropping 80%, people are still buying, and company still operating and doing very well. What are you guys looking at? You sound like analyst, that’s why they don’t make any money in stocks:)It’s all demand supply my friends, stop looking at useless numbers!"
"Looks like analysts , busboy, and writers are all under the pay roll of wall street boys, how does a company like W that trade it over $130.00 a share just less than 3 weeks ago is now trades under $83.00 , somebody just walked away with over $100 Million , honestly it is beyond me, how the wall street boys can do this over ,over ,and over"
It’s finally doing what’s it’s been supposed to do....puts worked out nicely for June 5
Just trying to sell you their shares high before they drop this like all of the others...
Load up the truck.
The fomos will learn tomorrow. 25 to 140??? Wheres the sense?
RH going up should mean W goes down. Just pure logic. It means they are taking market share from other online furniture companies. Not sure why people don't realize that!
"Most fun I ever had in business was firing Millennials like little Wade... had one tell me I couldn't do that!! lmao.....I escorted him out the door and said watch this, sonny boy!! didn't even let him clean out his desk..... had HR deliver his belongings to his apartment later in the day."
What do you all think tomorrow? + \ - $20 or more?
"W smells like OSTK. Hope the CEO doesn't run off to Indonesia, sell all his shares to hide from the Deep State."
"Wayfair is doomed! Guess what, TAM is irrelevant if it is the more Wayfair sell the more Wayfair lose. Look at Wayfair's actual financial track records for the last 18 years since the founding of the company? The long term economics of selling and free delivering heavy and bulky home furnishing cheaper than the competition has not changed in a meaningful way, and the long term financial future of Wayfair has not suddenly and dramatically improved overnight."
Remember the 12 million diluted shares at $230- time to pay the price
lmao.....nice bounce!! guess I was right all along...... made some money
"Been telling you rubes for months.....low float, 36% insider owned, weak shorts, massive tute ownership, and all Wall Street loves this stock.....it's not going down, as you're learning, as you lose your money......it's pretty simple, really."
Tom... back in TVIX. it will be ugly next week with not states lockdown
"Wayfair's new elevator pitch is a gem! About Wayfair: Wayfair believes everyone should live in a home they love. Through technology and innovation, Wayfair makes it possible for shoppers to quickly and easily find exactly what they want from a selection of more than 8 million items across home furnishings, décor, home improvement, housewares and more. Committed to delighting its customers every step of the way, Wayfair is reinventing the way people shop for their homes – from product discovery to final delivery.Boom. Drop the mike...."
Who in their right mind would purchase this stock at $180? The company has never had a profitable quarter and we are in a recession. This stock market is nothing but a video game now.
Going under 145 in two weeks ? Thumb up = Y Thumb down = No .
lmao...wayfair ROARING BACK!! I love this volatility !! you cant help but make money!!

Wayfair’s Stock Soared During the Lockdown. It Could Tumble as the Economy Reopens. https://www.barrons.com/articles/wayfair-soaring-stock-could-plunge-when-economy-reopens-51589498251?emailToken=b0d49b61d6b0a5980bbe9b011e64de36MA29fWWHYR9f7igoIQlkVvdUL16mxEHZlzD0WCRCUXGN3%2BkMKopjB9IDlqu5207y6v%2BUtorrH5oBvvRMTRHbGQ7bMF1vGsqE05ZQBZcf%2BAU7E4q0l3Ys9UXsX6XNNsBM
The CFO sold $1.8 million on 10/18/20
No volume today. I'm really surprised they weren't able to run it up another $10
Will W follows SHOP in a downward trend? Disappointed performance like NFLX will trigger selloff
Wonder which “on the take” analyst will Raj pluck out today? My thoughts are Zacks
"So with today's CTO announcement, Wayfair is trying to spin themselves as a ""technology company"". This money losing furniture reseller is acting exactly as small gold mining companies did when cannabis hit Wall Street. They all tried spinning themselves as pot companies too. It worked....for a little while.What technology does Wayfair sell?"
"Feel like every Robinhood user owns some Wayfair now. You know what happens once retail is fully in? That's right- this thing is gonna bomb, just as quickly as it has risen, it will drop back down."
320 by the end of the week or 225 dump
Short more here....SHORT IT
"Investors never learned.... price down, short cover, price goes up. best swing stock."
Flash sale on Wayfairs Wuhan bed sheets! Only slightly infected. Get them while they last!
With all the 350$+ upgrades obviously the institutions are just climbing over each other at this discount rate with a whopping 1.2 mil shares traded today.
How are the shorts doing here?
"WAYFAIR COMING BACK ""BIGLEY"" ! I knew it would....."
This stock just won't go down. It's insanity.
RSI at 82.48... shrinking volume... unfilled gap at $119... Overall markets looking ready to roll over. Beware the Ides of March!
Day after 103
Apparently there are a lot of weak shorts loosing their shirts.
$350 top before sold off to $260
Not a buyer in sight lol
It has to close above $190 for call options purposes
W definitely has analyst on the take 100%
Last one!! The hits just keep on coming! 66% give it a 1 out of 5 (1 is the lowest it measures) 1200+ reviewshttps://www.trustpilot.com/review/wayfair.com
Proud of Raj Shah of perfect timing - he was able to hit price of 52w high while dumping 23K shares. It requires quite a skill or shall I say collusion to have perfect timing. See 4K form from 8/13.
"For anyone who thinks Wayfair is replacing brick and mortar furnture stores here is some more data proving otherwise, they still lag Ikea (during a pandemic)https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=%2Fm%2F02x44_z,%2Fm%2F03tb1,%2Fm%2F02kpnw"
Check finviz to see insider selling. CFO sold over 5 mill worth of shares this month and they’re using algos to sell it in blocks to try and not cause a panic sell off. They’ll just take shareholders money slowly.
"NASDAQ up, W down that's what I like to see"
Sam. covered 56ish.
Sell!
This will fall on its face. Unhealthy move up. No balance. Can end in only 2 ways. Big sell off or buyout. Haven’t heard any rumors of a buyout. It’ll run out of gas(shorts covering any day now)
andrew left looks depressed while talking about W at CNBC
At 9:45 this went up 3% on a buy of 5000 shares... lol. Manipulated at its best. The sell off will be very large and fast.
Who wants to bet on mellinnals when they walk off the job and protest everything from helping children to cloudy days. Probably sabotaging orders as we speak!
"I don't know what it is.... but I sure love making money!! i've killed this stock going up and going down. easy really, if you know what you're doing...."
A long position at this point short term could cost buyers several million on paper anyway. Vanguard needs to rethink this stock!
Every company that beat earnings is plunging on earnings date this topsy turvy season
"Guys...Quick, but accurate valuation here. 130 million households in U.S. alone. Conservatively they will spend $1,000 per year on Wayfair's amazing products (and customer experience)….That's $130 billion in sales in U.S. alone!...x 3 and this is easily $400 billion company and $4,000 / share! Might take some time, but easily doable in like 18 months.."
Another up day on truly massive volume..True Wall Street Hitters / Hedge Funders (TWSHHF) getting in deeper on this name..
"People who bought W just cos of BBY earnings, you guys deserve to lose money. This is karma"
Wayfair is holding strong... but it will continue to fall. Stay the course shorts this is a great company to short.
Waiting for this to go to $115 or lower to buy back the 115 strike call I sold.
Bought at the market 167.45. Hope it bounces it back.
"Sell my Sprucey House, Sell!!!! Barron's PR piece gives you cover!!!"
Notice no analyst has ever talked about the 12 million share dilution @$230 a share milking over $3 billion just 3 weeks ago ? Why did the mm only pay $230 when the stock was $330?? Because W @$330 was a scam
"The stock market doesn't care if something will never earn income, they can sight revenue growth. If the fed didn't back stop every asset, this would have gone under."
Niraj Shah is smart he sold before you can .
Normally the last 15 minutes is upward anothe 2 point
market going to go red today.... wonder how much Wayfair will go up today as investors flock to safety....
"Millennials are always ""up on the trends"" and paying attention to influencers and what they have in their homes and what home accents and decorations are the best things to have for friends to see. These people are spending discretionary cash on home decor now because everyone is in lockdown and so when you take videos everyone wants to see what is new. This is great for Wayfair because everyone likes to ""catch on the train"" and buy similar things with especially simul money. Wayfair is a great buy at this price."
Sam! LMAO. bwhahaha. Drip....Drip....Drip! Wayfair roaring back! Wayfair you got just what I need! Losses. Andrew Left called this company right last year. If they can’t make money in this economy when will they?
"Simple math eps now -4.50$ for 2018 and -4.30$ for 2019 , w can generate revenue all day long by sell goods at a lose to increase customer . Each new customer w need to add cost them $200 . At the same time cost of labor is increasing , Amzn same time adding big home goods to their site , it will be difficult for w to sustain in the long run , I congratulate those who place their bet @$60 in May I believe they made big fortune . Also who shorted @ 150. Now the game is over , u will not see any thing like price increasing $2 every like it did during last quarter . I feel sorry for those who bought @125 above might get some pain in the near future . Good luck to all"
"SHAH the CEO unloaded huge , insiders sold at high , RED FLAG . SELLLLLL"
Anyone know why volatility just shot up 10% on this?
"Sold my shares, good luck guys"
EPS still -10.68 even with the huge drop in PPS. How this ever got over 100 a share is like beyond meat.
Would be nice acquisition for Walmart that just announced it wants to get into this type of business.
"So W Q1 2020 revenue is down significantly from Q4 2019 and down from the last 3 quarters. That is not growth. It is a shrinking of revenue, despite 28% growth in ""users"".This is NOT sustainable. The growth trend is horrible. Is any analyst looking at that? Growth is the only story Wayfair management have."
about to short this baby once market opens
"Why not just buy on Amazon? Better quality, less expensive, zero hassle returns. 5 star reviews NOT 1 star reviews for sellers."
Bots are just trying to follow the trend and they exaggerate every move...They still want to push this up.
Amazing company and products!!!! Larry and I are delighted by its customer service and SO MUCH MORE!!!! We are using Wayfair to outfit one of our 24 houses! (We even store one of our 359 Teslas next to some of its delightful products!!)))
decent $60 put open. Probably try to peg it at 60 today
"This company has negative sharelholders equity. Negative. There is no respectable fund manager that would own this stock. Total manipulation, but once reality finally hits home, this stock will drop lock a rock."
I was hoping Wayfair climbed to $135 again so I can short it heavy again. This market is beautiful for shorting.
Hoot sold 6 months ago. However bought bed power base coffee table rugs desk. Couldn't believe price. No tax No shipping cost. Mattress cost 400. Not really as firm as I liked. They said keep sent another.Thought how could they make a profit. Daughter like less firm she sleeps on it.Bought at 75 sold at 160. 1000 shares.Couldn't figure out biz model. Just grow revenues. O well liked the PPS gain and liked the merchandisePeace
How come this is UP. Any news
Let’s close at $85 for Monday opening $90
"Has anyone seen such terrible reviews for $16B+ revenue company.Looking at trustpilot, I see 9 review since yesterday (Yes 1 day ago)7 has 1 star rating1 has 3 star1 has 4 starAmazing how investor can invest any dollar in such company until they resolved such huge issue. Covid 19 may be curse and not gift because everyone forced to go online and have so much bad exprience.What even more amazing, there are 10 of different alternative and big furniture brands now also selling online and will soon add more competitor + peace of mind return at store."
"Wow, really is amazing the number of random bullish bots that have appeared here - zero thoughtful posts, just people blatantly trying to pump this stock on open so they can sell their bags to the naive retail investor. Anyone at all have any reasoned discussion in them?!"
It’s been a while since W didn’t finish strong. Have we hit a ceiling. ?
By far probably the most easiest stock to make some huge profits. Up 4-5% every day for the past week. Jump on board and ride this Mega wave at your own risk
On Oct 12/20 Spruce house unloaded $261 million worth of shares - they are a 10% partner - this is known as rats jumping ship
I will short the stock today and buy a call that expires in January.I expect the stock to go down hard 40 to 50%.any suggestions?
I covered too early. I will short again tomorrow if it pull back
"OK, I have just entered first short at 322, will enter second around 327. Notice the Short Volume Ratio has been increasing over the past week, which is also another bearish indicator. Paired with the overbought RSI, I think a pullback is well overdue here!"
Feels so good when a bloated pig begins to drop to reality
Not good timing for W. Going to get CRUSHED if/when the inevitable market pullback occurs.
Volatility of W is unreal. You can turn your money as fast as or even faster than ETF’s. Pad those margins and buckle up. This ride won’t last forever. GLTA.
what happened that is causing people to chase this thing $30+ higher today?
"TOM, you're welcome!"
"Careful with this one, relatively small float and a high short ratio."
This is one of many reasons American companies don't want to hire Americans anymore. Too much drama and people don't really want to work. Sad to say.
The board is so quite today !
my BYND is up $11 today.... up $6 yesterday!! why a stock....wayfair came back nice too!! all is good!
"My daughter bought some furniture from Wayfair. Total junk and they sent it to the wrong address. I don't own this stock, but I'm very confident it's not even worth $5."
W Earnings this quarter are irrelevant. Forward looking statements will be the key.
"Classic, classic, ultra classic, good old fashion, Americana short squeeze. Start a small short position and leave it alone. Love it."
States are all closing down. All will follow soon. Markets going to be down big tomorrow. W will be 15 in two weeks. They will not be able to shut down and maintain there staff for more than two weeks without new money. The government is not going to bail them out. I knew their time was coming but hate the reason it is happening premature.
this Garbage is up more than GOOGLE and AMAZON combined today-what a CRIMINAL MANIPULATION by CEO and funds !!
This is pricing in best quarter ever. A slight miss or discouraging outlook for extended quarters. This falls like brick. Don’t get caught with pants down when this tanks. Brass balls to keep holding this at these levels. https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/24/if-you-own-wayfair-stock-its-time-to-sell.aspx
10:23 serious problems in trading liquidity. $1 swings in seconds. Not good.
All gaps must be closed. If you want to rise
It will close around 150 after the squeeze is over by eod.Tomorrow is another day. ...unemployment went thru the roof starting 2 Q .
"W: close 79$ would be AMAZING...Saw the brief DIP to 83$ this morning, something is there........"
Morgan Stanley with the upgrade...Looks like they will be leading the next convert in next two weeks
On September the 8th Wayfair was at $108 and yesterday it went as high as $132.55... on no news. It will come bad to $100 or less.
I think there are fund managers on here posing as short sellers saying negative things about wayfair then the stock goes up. I have a short position but its a scam all the negative news downgrades and people encouraging shorting on here then the price is up . beware of FALSE COMMENTS ON BOARDS. its funny everyone on here is short trying to convince people to sell and short the stock then it pops and goes up for no reason. the stock market is a scam!!
I don’t short stocks BUT if I did 1000 shares of W shorted here at $285. Papertrade
"1000 in volume and it goes up $5... 20,000 in volume in sell and it doesn’t move... manipulated"
"This is going to be an awesome short. Owners are selling their newly issued shares as fast as they can! This will be like musical chairs when the music stops, you don't want to be the one standing!"
Why dont they start selling other products which are in demand versus just selling furniture?
Shorted @ $320
Back to $200 soon. Go W. W Execs team going all out to work for you.
"Lmao.....this is fools gold! Those in it weren't around for the last Internet bubble, I guess. ...rinse repeat! We all know how this is going to end.....just dont know when."
Profit takers will sell...why risk it
Going forward will be a challenge with Millions of folks are out of work .Food vs Furniture... hum
"SummaryWayfair has suddenly shifted their strategy to focus on profitability after many years of growth at all costs.2019 continued to show huge cash burn and slowing growth, the opposite of what bulls want to see.Valuation is much lower now but insiders are selling and the company's fundamentals have deteriorated substantially.Cash will likely run out soon and we recommend investors avoid the stock at all costs.."
"This stock has a forward PE of 130 based on last qtr's earnings. What happens when people are not shut indoors buying online? Furniture is a purchase that people like seeing in person.....not everyone but a certain percentage. The stock market is getting pumped up by robinhood and algorithms. I am done with the market til the next crash happens. It is coming by mid 2021. When 20 million are unemployed on January 1 and the weekly checks stop....then the downturn happens. Fed money machine cannot print us out of a recession sorry. ""There is nowhere else to put my money"". Stupidest thing ever said by bagholders."

"People who buying at this price is insane, this stock should have drop below 120"
"Continued divesture? Late arrivers thinking it can pop to $300? Retail may help a little but upward momentum has been broken. People just locking in gains, moving to the next fad."
"Biggest garbage out there. management are buying their own shares to squeeze the shorts. im staying short and strong. No revenues, and doesnt stand a chance against amzn or wallmart."
"When you look at the furniture products already available on amazon, you’d realize how little advantage Wayfair actually has."
"I have been pessimistic about W for a long time as I never believed their business model was viable.... I am shocked by how quickly this thing has run back up.... I know for that their cash is hemorrhaging quickly - and vendors have list faith in their business model - and that really threatens their viability since they need those inventory lock-box’s as they don’t have the cash to pay for inventory as do their competitors (or the financial strength if other’s that still deserve lock-box’s (like Room’s To Go, Jordan’s, Bob’s or American). We will see if the current buyer’s are as smart as they think or whether this is another WeWork."
Almost same chart as Tesla. Expecting market selloff hard next week. GLTA
"LOL.....Jason, how's your $150 target looking.....oh, that was last week, that's right. Guess loop capital picked a bad time to take their turn at a price target increase. .... Nothing but Pumpers!"
There's a Short Squeeze Going on at WATT!!!!
"haha. Need more money , so soon. I guess the mistresses need their new fur coats. The way W is going, look for convertible price of $50 or less."
80 by close
"Lovesac is a fast growing online furniture. Growth is 30% plus and short interest is 30%, expect it to climb like W in the eary days. Alexa and google both have LOVE at site traffic all time high. Earnings Wednesday"
Massive rise in shipping costsFor online retailersComimg
Why is it falling ?
"the double edged sword. On a huge run. Never makes money and the main one everything else opening up. Oh, maybe a triple edged sword"
"This is going to get ugly, FAST!"
this is sooo overvalued stock ..anytime bust
"Up again on big expected earnings, like beating a dead horse for more and more and more and more..."
this was a 21 dollar stock in march..so you know how manipulated it is
$220 today
Look at those eps revisions! Everything looks bad here. Way over priced. Bought April puts at 130. Get out before it's too late... Insiders are getting out. Not a bad idea to follow suit.
"Floridians? Covered!! Three new spokes off the Atlanta hub cover the Sunshine State in first-class, last-mile delivery.---snip----->from the Tampa Bay Biz JournalWayfair, an online retailer that specializes in home goods from sofas to wall art, is opening a Tampa distribution center as part of a major Florida expansion.The new Tampa location is just over 45,000 square feet, according to Gov. Rick Scott's office, which also announced Wayfair distribution centers in Orlando and Miami on Tuesday.The Tampa warehouse is technically in Riverview, in Oak Creek Commerce Park, at 8147 Eagle Palm Drive. Kris Courier and Rian Smith, a team of brokers from CBRE Group Inc. in Tampa, represented the landlord, EastGroup, in the transaction.Courier said Tuesday that Wayfair started searching for warehouse space in the Tampa area about a year ago and was considering another spot in Oak Creek — but another company snatched that up. When Smith Cargo Transportation Services Inc. moved into another building within the park, Courier said, he and Smith reached out to Wayfair, and they were interested in backfilling that space.Wayfair moved into the space about three months ago, Courier said.Combined, the new distribution centers represent 100 jobs, including management and customer positions. Wayfair has current job listings in Tampa for home delivery concierge positions.""Our new Florida distribution centers are part of our growing logistics network, which allows us to expand our world-class delivery experience with fast shipping of furniture, décor, home improvement items and more to millions of consumers,"" a Wayfair spokeswoman wrote in an email Tuesday.The Florida locations come more than a year after Wayfair opened a Southeastern hub in the metro Atlanta area, creating 150 jobs there.An October story in the New York Times details Wayfair's plans to overhaul its logistics operations, bringing much of it in-house instead of using third-party companies, particularly for last-mile deliveries.""The expansion of our operations in Tampa, Orlando and Miami will ensure that we continue to provide exceptional service every step of the way as we transform the shopping experience for home all the way through to delivery,"" James Savarese, Wayfair's chief operating officer, said in a statement. ""We are pleased to open three new state-of-the-art facilities in Florida and contribute to the creation of new job opportunities across the state."" Based on the size and location of Wayfair's Tampa distribution center — on the small side for a warehouse user and closer to the city's population base than Plant City or Lakeland — it is likely for last-mile deliveries.""That's right in the same size range as we’ve seen other e-commerce groups for last mile delivery,"" Courier said."
If OSTK is any indication of what to expect when earnings hit. you better be ready for a huge dip. OSTK posted great earnings again and dropped 17%.
sure hope you bought the dip!! nice one at the open....buyers coming in as other stocks are too risky....they all come to W for safety.....all it ever does is go up....
Next stop $44 and 44 cents in 4 days at 4 o’clock
Such low trading float.....easy to manipulate... Not enough shares out.
Volume today again is exceptionally weak
"this will be 120 by friday, so weak by now"
Wait till the media to cover it.
how is this holding up whos buying
Who’s buying a put option?
"After hours squeezeee….$200 by tomorrow, Friday at latest..."
was it upgraded?
This is just a gut feeling. but Pacific Crest which came with a bullish report yesterday was one of the IPO underwriters. is there a secondary coming soon?
insanely over value stock
Like Elvis would sing. Way on down
Big time short covering today....1.5 million shares traded in the first hour alone. @Dean-good hunch on the squeeze premarket this morning...didn’t expect that since Friday’s SS was pretty big..but you just can’t easily predict with a tiny float and huge short interest. I think margin calls kicked in once it hit 180 and it just accelerated for shorts to cover. Glad I sold my 177 puts late yesterday to lock in gains (because you never know with W) Got back in at 185 for 185 puts early today and didn’t expect it to hit 190. It’s traded flat since the first 1-2 hours and the slower trades shows there’s no real interest but short covering today along with FOMOs thinking this must be Cramer’s go to stay at home stock. Volume still ends much lower than average today and W is still destined to go down soon. It will be interesting to see what happens tomorrow.
$230s next week?
20% up after 6 folding.
Wayfair should rocket up again today!!.....exceptional balance sheet and earnings are stellar! growth off the charts..... amzn struggling to compete...Amzn having to expend Prime day sale to 2 days now to try and get back in the game...Wayfair owns them!
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kohls-reopen-25-stores-states-125859247.html
Bid/ask spread on average has been .5 to 1%... meaning this is a very illiquid stocks and easily manipulated. The drop is coming soon. And hard
lmao.....credit suisse raised target from $130 to $192!!...... insane!! this is what Wall Street is all about.....crooks...
bought puts every 10 point increase since 140. Gonna exit today with a good chunk of profit :) W has never turned a profit and glad the hype is finally dying.
Wayfair has a negative PEG ratio. A negative book value. 18 pages of insider selling. Roughly 40 major insider sales n month of January alone. If they don't think it will go higher from here why should others?
insanely overvalued
"For anybody watching these boards, take note of Sam. He is the most short sighted, simple minded, and downright idiotic person I've ever encountered here. He was the biggest Wayfair bull less than a week ago, and after a minor protest he thinks it's going bankrupt. Proof that he doesn't understand fundamental OR quantitative financial research. He is a pathetic pumper/dumper trying to rub two nickels together to make a few bucks. He has no credentials--anyone can hide behind a keyboard. Sam--you really think that you took down Enron and Worldcomm? Perfect example of how delusional and small you are. Keep shaking your geriatric fist, old man."
$400 this week?
Covered some this morning and will short it back end of the day.
Lol I love watching this. Best entertainment ever. Buy buy buy
Stock is up 90 percent this year. You need to CRUSH estimates on every metric do maintain these levels and valuation. This ER most definitely did not.
most of the analysts have $190 to $200 targets on W.... way too low... .. they're always conservative.

Because the market for purchasing home goods online is rapidly evolving and has not yet reached widespread adoption, it is difficult for us to predict our future operating results.

"A Bushel of Lemons Awarded to Citron, Wayfair's Most Vocal BearA year ago this month, semi-professional short seller, Andy Left, of Citron Research (who's book is smaller than Trump's hands) penned a hilarious critique of Wayfair and declared it was heading to under $10 within a year. It was the next Overstock, doomed to fail, poorly managed, and quite simply ""the best short he'd ever seen"". Following the release of this analysis and declaring it his largest short position, Wayfair shares sold off several dollars to $32. Doubling down, Left then said Wayfair was really worth $0.Today, Wayfair trades at roughly $39 per share - putting Left badly under water with his short, and even further away from his target price of under $10. So why was Left, and fellow CNBC-fueld ego-maniac, Whitney Tilson (who declared Wayfair was flooding the market with Formaldehyde drenched flooring and furniture) so far off on the predicted outcome for Wayfair? Simple: they're lazy hacks with no meaningful insight into the Wayfair brand, it's operations, it's customers, or its potential. Moreover, by ignoring larger marketplace trends, they'll likely to wake up one morning to a text from Mr. Max Pain, informing them that Wayfair has been acquired by (insert your favorite brick and mortar ecommerce laggard here) for a hefty premium. Ouch! (see Jet.com for reference).So, profitable longs, join me in wishing Citron a Happy Anniversary on it's bombastic call on Wayfair. I encourage you to visit their web page to read the ""analysis"". Very entertaining stuff. Discloser: Long Wayfair from $19.65 + several short term trades over the past 20 months."
donates $30m to charity when they only made $23m last quarter...
W book value is -$12/share. NEGATIVE $12/share. That is all you need to know.Wayfair is functionally bankrupt and Wayfair management is less than honest with you.
Methinks there's some volume from HF's pushing W up from its lows today.
W is now down 25% from high. Officially in a bear market.
I think this will follow a downward pattern similar to W’s 5/11 peak and sell off up to 5/18. The low share volume supports this. Profit taking today after yesterday’s short squeeze run up.
This stock might be disconnected from reality in one's mind....but don't trade the illusion of the mind...trade the reality of the chart.
"Everytime I short this #$%$ it drops down within next 7 days, I'm back in again at $302 - so hopefully I'll bring some luck. RIP W"
"Sam, are you still shorting TSLA . I covered 198.17 . Will short it again if it bounces back . Want to buy some put But have not done option . Pls let me know if you had done it . Thx."
"Should I sell half of my holding? hummmm..... Its been trending up strongly lately. Last time, it shoot pass $140 and I didn't sell. Seeing the shares go all the way down to around $80. It is $166 and change today. More than a double! hummmm..... But, if it will go higher, I will kick my behind .... geeee, tough."
Gangsta Raj will be speaking to GS today...
I would love to short this pig but my money is tied up in companies with healthy balance sheets and long term growth. Can’t believe it’s retail pumping this over $300/share. Has to be insider or institutional manipulation.
Here comes GREEN
"Read my posts, I didn't hold into earnings as some of you wish!! Lol...I sold half at $164.70, and posted it when I did....go back and look..... sold the rest at around 161..."
"I always believe in holding some defensive stocks in case of a market downturn or recession....WAYFAIR is the best defensive stock you could ever hold!! goes up in good times, and goes up in bad times!! sure glad I bought more when it dipped $8 this morning.....what a gift!!!"
the money making machine is turned on High this morning.... not even a dip!! .... just straight up.... amazing .... I feel for shorts..
"Just because it’s down, doesn’t mean it’s a good entry. At best it may rebound after a few days, maybe next week, maybe next month. But then again a major stake holder can bail at anytime. Also Walmart doesn’t need W. At least not at $70 a share with negative revenue. Walmart cannot use any of its retail and warehouse to stock big furnitures."
STOCK TRADER Looks like your money for the European trip is coming . Good Luck to us all !
it seems that the money has slowed down on the buyback. They had to be out by now doing even 45k shr/day. Volume has been well under 2.4 million recently.
daily turnover trade 292.96M. Internal trading.
"Naz up huge today, Wayfair down big. Naz down, what happens to Wayfair?"
"They’ve never once made money, their losses continue to get worse and worse even though their revenue goes up....someone please tell me how this stock is $200 instead of $20!"
"Bigger the pop, bigger the drop. Love it!"
"With a PE of over 169 and over 3 billion in debt only a matter of time until it drops. In five years hoping for this to finally level is insane. With Amazon taking over every market, and furniture is next."
i now know why this stock is up! they have the cure vaccine - but catch is it comes with cheap chinese furniture. their couches are flying through the roof cuz families tuning into netflix together for hrs and dining tables because now families eating at home need a bigger dining table.
"Sam, you making that easy money today?"
Futures are down tomorrow. Hopefully . W will drop to $55 or $57 tomorrow.
"Tom, be ready to take profits today!! day trade it! sell the 300 you bought at $154.. its $157.50 now.....take your $1,000 profit!! nothing wrong with that!! GL"
GOING DOWN !
From Marketplace:W is no.8 in top 25 stocks to short
"Holiday weekends are a bit different these days, USA stock/bond markets closed Monday. Once upon a time there was this thing called fundamentals.........that was a crazy time!"
"Massive selling going on with companies that dont have assets. These highly speculative companies with no assets are going up in smoke. Money is moving into companies like Boeing, Disney, Micron, GM, Ford. Companies that have massive unions and physical assets and a future ahead. Good luck holding the bag with all the overhyped pupmed up Cramer picks."
will not go down! this stock is 99.9 reslient to recession!
180 close
"More I think about it, if W wants to get into retail, why not just merge with RH?"
"Look at the volume that moved it from 50 to 190 and then the volume that moved it from 190 to 322. Little ticks at the perfect times. No one ever sells, it's like they always know they can bring it up after a 1-2% drop. The money is in with the MM. The rsi has been at 100 percent for six days. Also wondering where this billion plus in free cash flow appeared from with shipping disasters and trade war taxes."
"Amazing outperformance on exceptional volume!!! Go Wayfair!!! I predict, just my opinion, partnerships with Uber, Lyft, Beyond Meat, and WeWork..."
$85 more so Mike can break even hehe
needs to close below 260 to reverse the upwards technical levels
Buy before it's too late. target is 416.
Going to short this tomorrow (if it stays at ~119 or higher)
Whoever is buying this at these prices is nuts. Wait for it to get to 100$
Short squeeze over . Get ready for exit now
dont think this company will ever have a down day!
"Niraj Shah is dreaming if he is trying to emulate Bezos. I bought RL fitted bedsheet sets from Wayfair because it was the cheapest of all the places. They also had paypal promo where if through paypal you buy $100 paypal giftcard, wayfair will throw in $10 for free. In addition to that, for 3 items I bought, Wayfair gave me $5 for each review I wrote on their website. Now, I dont remember Amzn offering me $$ to write review. Having your customers write reviews is concept of leveraging OPW (other people's work) which is not the case with Wayfair. This dude is burning money like there is no tomorrow. He has good company in HMNY (check it out, $9.99 / month for unlimited movies at any theatre of choice). There is lot of similarity between them.Also, Bezos build a complementary business to pay for its low margin retail business with Amzn Cloud, what does Wayfair has to command that kind of free pass of burning money?"
"Still can't make a profit, what a joke."
the short covering stops on this pig. Dead cat bounce. Went down to fast and hard to be anything else. Hopefully they will be done soon and we go to red
W- still BUBBLE!! No way at this price
EPS is minus 10. This drop is to be expected. Their prices are way too high. Shop and compare.
could close green today! already recovered half its losses...
Short at 185
Wayfair spends $1 for ads/marketing/etc... in order to generate $1 of revenue. Factor in all the SG&A and they spend $1 to lose money. They will never ever ever be profitable.
Every metric is increased in this qtr.Gl
"Exactly as I called it so far - weekly peak happened at a similar time to yesterday. I'm convinced it's a big institutional seller offloading at these heights, should mean we have seen the top."
"There we go, up 5% on very low volume and no news at all."
"Who knows what's holding this up? Yes, they sell furniture online, and have increased sales, but do you pay anything for that? That was the exact same argument 20 years ago during the internet bubble. Same exact."

47% OF THE SHARES SHORT. OMG. THIS STOCK ISN'T WORTH 75. BUT AFTER SHORTS FINISH COVERING LOOK FOR $75 IN 12 MONTHS
"90K shares traded first 1/2 hour? Looks like mm sitting on transactions, waiting to report later."
already up on my buy this morning!! W gong green again!!! lmao..... easy call....
"Economy is open So are stores, a lot of competition Plus other On line site selling quality stuff at great prices - go Akea"
What did China stop filling W orders?
"If there was ever any doubt about stock manipulation, this morning's W price action in the face of today's jobs report should put that to rest. Talk about a scam!"
What a joke our stock market has become
Do we think it will go down tomorrow?
about time this took a breather! 30 green days for every red one... I like that!
Yesterday when the stock was trading at $159 I said it could go to 149 or 169 Heck today it could go to 150 or 180
Retail is picking up. I won retail. This may hit 450-500.
"The Wayfair business model is truly an amazing story for which 3 things in the last 5 years is consistent.More sales revenue equates to more losses which equates to more debt, or sales= loss=more debt."
"$12 bill market cap, Earning/share $-10.50 -wall street filling this BALLOON with HeliumApril 1 2020 - $47 now April 28 2020 - $125 did they invent magic dust!!"

Looks like hedgies are trimming off going into quarter end.
At this rate the entire public float will trade today.
The money should go to Frsh
"Momentum traders rule. The more overpriced and risky it gets , the better they like it."
More MM games. Propping it up for reasons unknown
Heading below 100 fast. Terrible conference call on earnings projecting bigger loss on the fake ADJUSTED EBITDA basis and now this very expensive rights offering.
How many shorts got killed in TSLA? Every time they got killed. This could be bigger than TSLA.If you believe just hold on. So many bite the dust in this too by shorting. Do not doubt the power of short squeezeGL
This stock is getting hard to short I wonder why
"HA-HA ,, Now wayfair price is Higher than BOEING-LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL"
Lots of conspiracy theorists in the stock market I see.
"Looks like many shorts have been throwing in the towel after suffering huge losses this summer. I'd wager more losses ahead for the stubborn holdouts and newbies. The Bullish trend continues and the upcoming earnings call will add more fuel to the fire, imo. I've repeatedly said that the threat posed by Amazon is waning with each Q, and their move on Whole Foods basically means they're not going to take on Wayfair in a direct and meaningful way. In other words, they're ceded this vertical to Wayfair, the clear market leader, who is evolving into a juggernaut, remaking a dusty business model for the new economy, and really putting a hurt on mom n pop brick and mortar outlets, as well as other major outlets.Wayfair's investments in Castlegate, WDN, premium service, exclusive items, promotions, and social media are setting the stage for a long run as a pioneer. Either as a stand-alone company or takeout target, these guys are kickingass and taking names! Enjoy the ride, shareholders. These stories don't unfold every day!"
"the manipulation is back I see. Rocket up in morning, sell off to flat at lunch. Rocket up into close"
shorted at $144.50.......another one on deck at $145.... what a gift!! love this action!
"W trading above al targets ....we all know , or should know, sell side targets are rarely ever hit. it appears W stock price is outrageously over priced......yes, it has been most of the time, due to the extremely small float. but the won't last....one speed bump and this goes below $100."
Bid Ask spread is so much smaller that yesterday’s short squeeze! If the spread gets bigger and stock keeps falling look out!
very profitable Lol
"I have commented on this before, I don’t own any, never have never will. I don’t do options etc.I just worry about people on this stock. I retired a few years ago after 57 years as a merchant, the last 30 included a very large furniturebusiness. Any fool can sell furniture at a loss, many huge chains have come and gone.There is nothing magic about selling furniture online, in fact it is a handicap. Best formula iscontainers or truckload quantities to local warehouse for local distribution. Furniture inventory is the king of unrecognized losses, what is called an asset, is just hidden loss.A real analyst would talk to some warehouse people and see what reality is before recommending people put their hard earned money in a stock based on the analyst recommendation.Good Luck to AllJohn"
Really just a super squeeze today too many people started shorting sub 200
STILL about $280 overvalued...lol.
"""After not looking at any fundamentals or stuff like that, I have raised my price target for W to $1,893,463 per share. Yeah, I think that's a fair valuation based on nothing."" —typical W bull"
"Morning, Sam are you adding when is up ?"
not time to cover... lots of room to go down. it should be down 2-3 points by this time
"You see, many options expiring today....lots of shorts have to unwind positions, and hedges.....I'd expect a Green Day !!"
"As I told you at $138 , after earnings.... It will climb back up, and it did! .. easy call, really. Nothing can stop!! Not tarrifs , not recession, not competition, not making money....lol,,,,,NOTHING! Ride the wave to victory !"
It's got a good rhythm going - up in the morning stable in the mid-day hours and start giving up gains within 2 hours of close.
Huge loss for pumpers buying their own stock for ridiculous price. No fed money pump today to hitch hike?
We are back in and heavy long
They sell kids tho below 200
Lots of shorts getting flushed today.
"This wants 220 badly, might bounce there though i reckon."
"Usually heavily shorted stocks are up on Fridays as shorts don't want to hold into a weekend. W however, seems like longs are going to take profits after lunch as this price has no rhyme or reason being over $100 per share. I bought a few pieces of furnature from Wal Mart's website and a A/C at Amazon. The ex-wife loves Over stock. All the retailers are online and losing money. I can't see W going up much past this price of all most $120."
"the average price target of $261.59 implies downside potential of 13%. Buy analyst consensus is based on 11 Buys, 9 Holds, and 3 Sells. Following Wayfair's 234% stock rally year-to-date, the average price target of $261.59 implies downside potential of 13%."
Get ready for a power hour to close above 290
"So if Wayfair is burning $300 million a quarter and they have approximately enough cash on hand to last until year end, when do they go to the market to raise more, how much more and how much dilution. December is only 7 months away and you never really want to wait until you are out of cash......"
$85 close
"if this is not manipulated, i don't know what else. the whole market is down, people panic and the worse company is green"
WOW--buy furniture online? That's America. Bubble 2.0
Shorts smoldering watching me call this stock daily! just cleaning up.....long and strong going into earnings... like a rocket taking off...
"lmao....yawn......watch and learn! dipped early, down over a $1.......then green and up $1.80.........even copperstein, I mean Silverstein could trade this!!"
Why is this company worth $17 billion??? It is not making a profit this year and it never has?? Put a recession into the mix and this company is only worth 25% of current valuation. If you are buying shares here please get on medication for irrational exuberance syndrome.
down 26 cents......shorts are congratulating each other......I love it!
"Yeah, I’m sure everyone stuck at home for so long just can’t wait to go online and buy furniture off Wayfair...maybe Wayfair can target their advertising at Robinhood traders up on W to increase sales...there’s a strategy LOL"
This is too easy.... Price will go back to 230 ish....
"Wow ! LLately, lots of upgrades . Should I buy ?"
Bull trap the naive fomo will run for the cover .
It’s a disgrace what they are doing to this market. S soon as they can’t prop it up anymore these stocks will fall 70% and the retail investor will lose as the big boys are short.
"what a company ........ every morning, I wonder how much ill make today! averaging $6,200 a week, just day trading wayfair....too funny ....... you just have to know how stocks trade sheeples.... ive showed you how this trades months ago....."
"time to short W, back down to 150 short term. Nice run though"
Wayfair 21 years late to the game. The online shopping is saturated. eBay and Amazon are the only ones who will continue to do well. Shoppers are not going to go to a place they never heard of. They will go to a place they are comfortable with. Wayfair can close doors at any time leaving the customer with no recourse. Amazon and eBay are gonna be around for decades.
Short any share you can find of this #$%$ going back to 25 in 3 months!
"Read about DOT COM bubble crash. W is the example, they will pump it up and you wake up to see the company went bust. Many financial managers jumped out the windows."
"Next resistance is 296, 367 to 416"
Overstock is down 20% this week - so W will be down at least 20% equals $70 ...Hello $260 followed by another 10% ..Hello $230 the price of the dilute 12 million share right after earnings 2.5 weeks ago
I am glad it is running. I wish I had not sold my trading calls yesterday but mad a good profit. I will be buying puts before earnings or should I say before loss report. This will crash like it always does. Maybe not as much this time because of revenue increase. It will lose 300 million min. I will not buy as many as normal because the street loves the revenue growth but getting tired of them losing. The kicking the can down the road is getting old.
There is about a 40c gap between each 100 shares of bids and asks so a 500 shares can easily raise it a whole point.
"End of day sells were 1.6 million 124k and 180k,can't wait for tomorrow!!!!"
Just allocated the last of my risky money market funds to W. Need the safety...
"more they dilute the more stock goes up. math is losing, w is winning. 10 decade long principle being reversed by W gravity defying principle."
"Lmao.."" nice $4 swing if you bought the dip, like I told you! Load up the trucks again! Another easy call..... what a company!! I feel for shorts. I really do!! They just don't understand what's going on here......too bad"
When is wayfair going to start cutting costs laying off employees? They are almost out of cash.
A buddy of mine ordered a chandelier on Wayfair 3 months ago. He is still waiting for it. No word of a lie. Not sure why he hasn't canceled and gone elsewhere. What he eventually gets likely won't match the description.
what the scoop with W? up $14 in one day!!
"$100 tomorrow, $110 by Friday guaranteed."
"W... going down, it will close around $127 today. My estimate."
Their 1 year target estimate is 87$ and it got downgraded today by stiffel nicalous
I tried VERY hard to warn you guys to sell this stock (for almost a year now). I was in the furniture biz for over 20 years (40 employees)... you can NOT make money (ever!) UPSing out furniture. Period. I've been saying that the stock was gonna go down to $50 or below in the near future. And it will.
"W is the stock of the future....its a safe haven for downturns in the new economy!! it goes up no matter what! you cant kill it....the more they lose, the higher it goes......you cant fight the tape.....just jump on and make money!! its simple! im hoping they lose doubt what they did last Q......then it will really skyrocket !!.....long and strong....keep losing wayfair!!..Wall Street loves you!"
U guys are all bailing at the lows investing backwards $ostk $w
"Seemed like no-one can help this stock now. Even with today's upgrade, it's crashing bad."
W is crushing. home office products are selling like crazy. Down size will increase the demand. Crushing Crushing Crushing the short
"Ok, let's first try more fundamentals but if that doesn't work we go back to fake news.So this company has an ever decreasing (decreasing in math means more negative) negative equity. Equity is the stuff you buy or hold when you buy or hold the stock, so basically any one long the stock is the owner of a lot of debt. Look at the equity development over time. Does this look like a good buy to you?https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/W/wayfair/total-share-holder-equity"
I?m not short on W nor have put options! This world is really #$%$ cked! If this type of news were released back in the days Wayfair would be at $50 minimum! How pathetic people are today..... everyone is FOMO buying ?it?s going to be okay in the near #$%$ture ? BS.
These days analysts are more about creating short squeeze for their large clients rather than objectively providing price targets based on underlying business
the market will march this trash higher until they have fleeced all retail shorts and soaked up all the retail long money while analysts upgrade it with higher price targets until all retails are depleted then it will be absolutely destroyed back to $20 once this bubble is done
"I think W is a buy and long term hold at this price... the fairy tale story is same one told to investors when the price was at 170, and making great progress on living up to that story. Nothing about the company changed since then, except traders changing their mind about belief in the fairy tale. And they could change their minds back at any day, so that makes this price a buy."
"Odd trading day for this thing, kinda just delaying the inevitable blow up though..."
So... Who's shorting?
"Wayfair traders, how long does this thing usually stay up in this range ?history it drops 100 pct of the time after making a move like this."
"Seems chief pumper, Jason has been missing in action since his $150 prediction of last week.... Sheep always get slaughtered"
This is now pyramid scheme - once the new feed money stops it will all collapse
The higher they get the harder they fall.
How can any funds hold this stock after what’s been revealed? The least they could do is sell until a complete investigation is done.
"How can anyone buy this stock on a day like today after seeing it crater almost $100/share in two weeks? Honestly if you did, you deserve to lose money."
"WOW..... sorry Tom. you just cant catch a break! even I thought it would dip today!! but this juggernaut cant be stopped, so it seems!! tariffs , trade wars, global economic pressures, losses, NOTHING can stop this! still room on the train... its not too late!"
"Massive volume today...People probably anticipating the conference on the 'Tucket next week, led by world's best investment firm Jeffries..."
"ZACKs must really want W to go down.. 2nd day in a row I see this after hours.Wayfair Inc (W)(Delayed Data from NYSE)$176.89 USD-3.92 (-2.17%)Updated May 7, 2020 04:00 PM ETAfter-Market: $122.46 -54.43 (-30.77%) 7:57 PM ET"
"Seems like a good idea to check on W at the end of the day... sold a couple shares at market price 162.64, the same shares I bought at 156. Put in a buy order to get them back at 159.6... seems like an expectable swing?"
"remember sheeples....buy the dip today !!!! just trying to help....shorts, you better cover on the dip!! this wont stay down for long....4 down days in a row in the DOW and this has hardly moved....7 out of 8 down days and its gone up... you cant stop it!! nothing can stop it!!.....most bears have long gone.....went home broke!! ANDREW LEFT has made a fool of himself once again! notice he's been absent , like most shorts???...lmao.....he should have called me before he shorted W, I could have educated he and his staff...."
$160 on Wednesday
Very anomalous action here...I'm expecting TWSH (True Wall Street Hedge Funders) to enter here. In SIZE...Perhaps Buffett
This could be a solid long call play once the corona virus infections/death rates taper off. Patience is key
Short interest too high and ripe for a squeeze. Only well capitalized shorts need apply.
so easy
I just love making money !!! and its so easy! short at will!
Great time to buy put options. Say December expirations. Maybe 70 strike
Wayfair Notches 53% Sales Increase Over Last Year's Record Breaking Black Friday to Cyber Monday Blowout.Cyber Monday Evening Sales Highlights:A sofa every 13 seconds?A mattress every 8 seconds??A rug every 2 seconds?Let that sink in a bit....
Anyone know the timeframe when this stock will plunge?
I just want to see an honest downgrade of this #$%$ but the fraudster bankesters will not do that
"wow, non tech with a high evaluation"
Wayfair has been and continues to be a mismanaged company. They have moved to source almost all of their products from China and this has resulted in very low quality and a high return rate. Third party suppliers and imports make up the bulk of Wayfair’s core supply network. The recent decision to “white-label” branded products is further evidence that company wants to move away from quality to promote its own Wayfair imported lines. This will result in further quality erosion and more customer complaints. The product managers and relationship managers are looking to pass the buck when problems arise. Real accountability and attention to detail are desperately needed.
This stock is going to $0

Next stop $44.44
"15,351,415 (22.68%) That's the short interest as of April 15. Not a kind number or percent. W will correct to a more reasonable valuation to reflect the opening of covid-19-shut stores."

Run... $130 coming.
China working hard to keep this up
$3 billion of hog feed for insiders @$230 per share -float goes up 25% -12 million more shares all right after earnings and not a word by analysts - how much did Zacks get for the pumping and the shut up afterwards - this major news and not a word - all at the expense of investors when thing drops once the cat is out the bag Hmmmm.....
-10% today would be lovely

"Wayfair is continuing to ""weather the covid storm"" with lots of great online sales for people looking to change up the house as the ""second wave"" is coming and so reopenings pause. Everyone is looking to ""change the scenery"" and Wayfair benefits a ton from this because people can't go to ""brick and mortar"" stores to buy home accents and other furniture. This has a ton of room to grow especially with the Federal Reserver backing the economy to help average households ""keep things fresh"" and also boost businesses."
Ok guys make $$$$ today sell W may 7th 400 and 410 puts
"hmmm, seems pretty bearish in here. hmmm"
No news up again for no reason! The roads are full of people again. This company does not have brick and mortar stores. They will get crushed and taken back to reality in Q4.
"Hello Sam, check out NIO ."

"This has gone up in a straight line for the past few weeks without any 5+% pullback and now this new of dilution, do you guys think that it will completely ignore the whole dilution news and keep marching higher or will come back to earth? One of these days, we might see a double-digit decline. Is it prudent to build a short position?"
"M&A Chatter On WayfairWhispers are growing that Wayfair will strike a deal with an acquirer sometime this year. I still think Walmart, with Marc Lore (founder of Diapers.com and Jet.com) heading up their renewed push into ecommerce with Store Number 8, will make them an offer they can't refuse, but time will tell.Keep in mind, Wayfair has a dual class equity structure (Like google, facebook, and others), with 51% of the voting shares controlled by it's two founders, Shah and Conine, so if anything were to happen it goes through them first and last. They may decide the added muscle and resources of a Walmart could provide them with the added fuel to accelerate their build out and lock up the online home furnishings once and for all. So long as they can maintain some autonomy and control and stay nimble and focused...the devil is always in the details.It's really up to those two when, and if, and how, a deal ever gets done."
"lmao..... up $7 and no end in sight!! Buffet, Ackman, all buying W..... no competition, and now the global dominator .."
how much do you all think they're going to push this up this time? dang!
BUY the dip.....this isn't going anywhere!!! I can tell already!! BUY THE DIP
"Morning Sam, have you look in TTD again and what other are you trading?"
"Need to be patient with this stock if you are shorting. Q1 will be not bad because of q over q comparison w/ 2020. Starting with q2, this is going downhill. Also, do not short yet until it jumps more than you expected originally.. learned this hard way "
The market will take a big correction after it goes up next week with the Fed bringing rates down. And it will start moving up again depending how 3rd quarter earnings for the S&P goes. But W is going down.
Falling knife vs greedy hands. Knife usually wins.

probably go green This thing has never made sense to me in its trading crazy
This is arguably the worst stock on the entire Nasdaq. The company loses money hand over fist and loses even more when its sales are juiced by a temporary black swan event. Loads of debt and a current ratio under 1. No one is trading this except for 8 people buying it like it was a winning lottery ticket.Madness.
probably be green today. Unreal
"This company is biggest drop shipper and so if anyone think their market share gain going to retain, Think again.They sure have things in their favor for now. Covid 19 causing many seller to discount price which increase margin and lower price. Problem is it's not sustainable as Most of those provider selling below cost and only reason they doing so avoid liquidity crunch. And as stores open around their need to discount go away and this is sector going to hardest hit which will even cause In store liquidation. If you have furniture already and thinking to replace, during recession (If your job feel not sure thing) will you spend money to replace. I seriously doubt it. I think it more likely that you just continue using until stable economy.It was insane that they trade at $28 but it's even more insane that it trading $192 just month out."
"Delivery fees, A ton of returns, Shipping fees for returns,IKEA, Amazon, shopify, other e commerce sites, big store sites and a ton of furniture stores and sites will pull the carpet out of W"

Only short covering can push this up higher...or big money can do it just for fun.

Way overpriced:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wayfair-stock-high-risks-despite-191129161.html
"Wayfair is a great stock right now because with the virus ""lockdowns"" and ""second waves"" coming most people are buying furniture from home and on this website. Think about it, everyone wants to change up home accents when stuck at home and realizes ""hey, the couch is a bit 'weathered'"" so they are shopping for furniture with stimulus checks because everyone realizes that is also good for the economy overall. This gets the Federal Reserves monies back into the businesses that can expand and grow like even before the ""covid-19."" Wayfair is leading the way here selling the furniture and home accents that everyone is interested in right now especially for things like their ""influencer feeds."" No brainer this will only go up."
W reached a new All Time High at 89.54
Yup missed revenues
Wayfair - the furniture online trading company built from the ground up on the ENRON principles.(Audit the books)
Where is the most up-to-date data on number of shares being shorted?
Yes!! This is what I've been patiently waiting for!!!! YAHOOO! Load up the truck !! Dropping like a rock!
Making great money on this writing calls when it goes up. Cause I know it will come down again.
Who are the maniacs needing to chase W after a 25% move in two days?
Morning tidbit: MKM Partners upgrades Wayfair price target to $107 from $83.
Shop is down 10% or $75.00.......rotation rotation rotation. Fed is now throwing pixy dust to the banks!
"People, the company doesnt make money. If your bullish thats great, but they're not profitable. They might be growing their revenue but again eventually you have to become profitable. They dont have a competitive edge, intellectual capital or cutting edge technology to fall back on."
Joel.. congrats.. we keeps getting 52 week low everyday!!?
Thanks God... The board is now quiet. All the shorts left -- now W can move up.
Second sell off will come about 1:30 I guess.
"Sam, hope you had a nice weekend and bought some this morning ."
I still can not believe the money they spent on calls to cover possible dilution four years down the line. The only reason I can think of them doing this is that they expect possible dilution later. In a time they are bleeding money they spend 120+ million unreal.
"No stimulus agreement, kiss this goodbye. we're going lower from here."
what will it take for this stock to go down?
"If nobody stays home anymore, due to a vaccine, W is 100% out of business. It's pretty simple."
You can see the stock starting to accumulate at this bottom. Looking for a pop going into earnings.
"Easily a 100B company, 500 by March"
I am thinking there is going to be some massive profit taking today and tomorrow. Nobody knows what the end game is. Everybody knows that we still have a month before things start to open back up. They just want to try and get money out so their will not be a revolt. States are going to be the next ones needing a bailout. Going to get a lot worse before it gets any better I am afraid.
"Morning guys, place my order to cover at 46 and Hopefully it get there today."
LMAO... sure hope you listened this morning and bought that nice dip!! $5 swing so far!! load up the trucks again!! what a company!
Look at this outperformance!!!! Musk-designed and manufactured solar-powered drones for delivery of houses fully furnished with Wayfair furniture must be getting close...
I've been short at $240 for a while now.. Nice to see it coming back down. Price target $195
huh......where does it rest??? right above the $143 support level........ looks like it held again!!!
"you don't need to be a genius... look at the Yahoo quarterly analysis and notice revenue drop the last 2 Q's and profit decrease with it. IF there was not a stimulus this month, we'd see that trend continue back to 2019 values. it'll get there will just take time."

W reached a new All Time High at 135.62
Sam is trying to ward off the margin calls right now so that he can get back to the message board and lie about how he was just kidding and was actually short the whole time.
"off to the races again....... one red day, 45 green days......"
you miss the fact-Not showing comparison-shows total Manipulation by funds-Boeing is the best stock here.
Where is Sam the man that’s mom won’t make the meatloaf at on his trade. Buy the dips.
"Wayfair is stuck in a $290-300 rut... At best case, this should be trading at around 200...... Nothing realy holding it up this high.... Shorted at 330 and not sure when to cash in... sighs"
already up in the calls I bought!!....LOVE GREEN!! what a gift today!
I am in my 30s and loading up on Wayfair. They will be selling more furniture than Ikea in due time. This stock will look extremely cheap in 10 years.
Bouncing off of 200 day moving avg..not sure if it’s temporary or sell off is done there
"Yawn.....morning sheeples!! Wonder how much I'll make today!!?? Another beautiful day....sun shining, birds singing, shorts trapped......wayfair should change their corp. colors to green!! Lmao.... always green!!"
"CEO sold 5.2 million shares n March 11, avg. price of 168...LOL...good for him....I covered my shorts from 170.50 and 171.50 today at 167.75 for a nice trade, and will get back in day long at anything above 170. When CEO is selling that many shares, he's wised up and taking his money when he can at the top."
I will restart shorting at (52w high + $10 - 15)
Wayfair stock sits above even the most outlandish bullish price predictions. I am building one of my largest short positions with Wayfair.

They did pretty well. I'm buying more
Check out MLLLF. Not a paid bot. Penny stock that is getting some steam.

Shady Old lady Clinton and her crew are buying.
"20% dilution. and stock goes up. incredibke!! if i started analyzing buyer and seller ac data of this stock, half of all trades would represent a handful of entities direct or indirect. thats manipulation and a crime."
Going to break 145 today and 130 is coming
W is down -6.92% to 62.00
Anyone in here that knows technical analysis and would want to take a look at a chart for this stock? I bought in very recently and I think there’s some big upside potential here and wanted to get a second option. Doesn’t look like people post in here too frequently though....
"02:14 PM EST, 02/17/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Wayfair (W) likely will report about 60% growth in its Q4 revenue when it releases its financials before the bell on Feb. 25, Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients Wednesday.Consensus compiled by Capital IQ calls for revenue of $3.74 billion. Morgan Stanley said its model is above consensus expectations for 40% to 50% revenue growth.For 2021, the firm said it is between the bulls and the bears, above consensus in terms of revenue growth but under consensus on profitability.""We think Q2 will be an especially important quarter for the stock, and how [Wayfair] laps its toughest compare (~85% revenue growth in Q2'20) should play a key role in determining the stock's near-term path,"" the analysts said. ""We model low double digit revenue growth on average to 2030.""Morgan Stanley gave Wayfair an underweight rating with a price target of $270."
Tom I wish I had of bought some apt. Up another ten pre market. Do you still have some?
40 shares short at 285.50. Lets make profit matter again!
One of these days W will take a dump. Then margin calls will drive it down further
"so far dont like the price action , its hovering around the lows of the day ..."
"at this rate, this might end in RED! bubble of all time"
FBI needs to crackdown on this company ASAP
Wow ! W is down more than TSLA today .
"Regret I sold my puts too soon (when it was around $317, bought at $321)...I would have doubled my $ now...sigh."
It is a good day to buy today
ROBINHOODERS GOT IN ON UPGRADE AT THE TOP GREAT STRATEGY
"Looks like shares of Wayfair caught an Elliot Wave, hung 10 with a Fibonacci curl, and will be riding the Relative Strength board all the way home. Just another great Bull story for the Wayfair longs!Happy Memorial Day (and don't forget to visit Wayfair for all those last minute indoor and outdoor Holiday needs!)"
Rising interest and corporate taxes will crush the high PE stocks.IMO
"So far I've been right. 1) padded / fake Q1 results; 2) fake guidance and TBD capital raise. Usual suspects upgrading the stock to get fees from the convert (CS, et al). After the raise and pump, this becomes one of the best shorts of the last 20 years."
"I have made numerous purchases from Wayfair. At first I liked them, now I will not buy from them. The products they sell are cheaply made and fall apart."
why is this stock going up ha ha they are bot making any money..... I don't know anyone who buys from wayfair it's overpriced. They just spend billions on marketing and commercials. I guess I'll have to start shorting at 175 to 200 geez. talk about market makers inflating a price.
"Too bad, I wanted it to go higher so I could short it some more."
"Let me guess, Cramer and your $50K per year analyst Keep saying sell? They have been saying sell since since it was at $30!Love it, I have been making their salary every 3-4 days for past 4 weeks! That is why they are analysts, the don’t make money:):):)"
I believer that Two more just pulled the lock-box since W wouldn’t provide Letter of Credit.... this is the “canary in the coal mine”...
30% up. can it go up 50% today?
MASSIVE losses like this are unsustainable. Prepare for dilution.
Its easy to spend someone else money to buy market share but to have no vision as to what will make you profitable? I do think they are helping to stimulate economy at the expense of stock holders. Everyone else they do business makes money but Wayfair.
Shorting but i’m nervous lol
The Death Of Fundamentals!!
"this will burst big time , back down to 100"
"How many of you good people think, that your wife/girlfriend buys a pillow or something elsewithout touching it first. I dont see it, women in shopping, need to touch everything first.I could never buy a furniture on line. Or freezer. I cant understand the price of this stock. Insiders are selling, would you, if the future looks so great. Smells fishy. I going short very soon."
This will be big. Great deals and so much selection how can you go wrong owning this long term
Oh goodness! What a sale for such an already bargain company that has a proven record of consistent earnings and dividends that increase consistently every year!!!
"Loveeee the low volume, soros can’t keep this up for long !!!!"
Go long folks. Buy more shares before earning.

"TOM, going to cover 400 shares of what I have left at $132 if it goes there....... that will leave me with only 400 shares short going into earnings ......just have to take profits.... YOU?"
I guess we will test 52 week lows in near future. SELLLLLL is what analysts are saying. First they lower the PT then they say hold then neutral ........what follows next is bankruptcy
Great company and concept. Way oversold. Got in at $74.25 this morning. I’m in and holding Long!
Bottom in $ostk $w
As long as we have renters moving around we will have furniture sales. The renters these days seem to trash their furniture and buy new when moving in to a new place.
w=greatest short opportunity
$180 by Friday...
In early 18 bought W mid 80s sold later 155 bought again later 18 mid 90 sold again few months ago 160...thinking a rhird time? OR are investors going to wait for earnings.
made more sense at lows a few months ago
Will renewed trade talks have any effect on operations?
Those names on those cabinets were not Susie and Karen. They are all unique. There needs to be an immediate investigation. Wayfair’s response was insufficient. ￼￼￼
This will be a wonderful short when the market turns south. Know when to bail.
SHORT THIS TILL UNDER 100 MINIMUM
$150 for tomorrow option day
"This thing is only about, oh, 150 points overvalued. Not much. Buy it right here. Then again, nah."
A lot of debt and negative book value. Most here don't understand finance so they're not worried over such things.
"yall are #$%$. company announces growth of 20% for Q1, 100% for Q2 and announces its plan to profitability by year end is ahead of track and is getting tailwinds from the virus and yall still haters?coronavirus helped Wayfair."

Full disclosure! I just bought 3 August 220 puts
Wayfair's return policy is awful and if you want to dispute a charge then expect to wait several months to hear from someone. I wonder how they are reporting those numbers??
"Wait for the upgrades to the rescue. ""Oversold"". Hilarious. Dropped how much market cap.?"
Question for the board? Would you rather buy Wayfair or LYFT INC? Just courious. Both lose a lot of money.
bynd up another $7 premarket!! what a party!! glad I jumped on that train !! I just love companies that don't make money!!...... seems .... seems ironic that I make so much money off companies that dont make money....lmao
So fixed! This W could open up 20 up or 20 down All pre and post market
bwhahahaha....down only $2 now and climbing!! JUST LIKE I TOLD YOU IT WOULD!! lmao......I cat stop laughing .....just counting my money !!......sure glad I bought the dip....only a fool would think this would stay down $8...
Crazy over-reaction...At least my HELOC rate set lower so I can buy more...
When this pig falls its gonna fall hard. No way does it deserve a valuation this high. More like 120-125

Good day for the ones that bought last week. That is for sure. If they know when not to get greedy. Me, I took advantage of it at $41."
"Rachel Chandler the Child Handler was a recruiting manager at wayfair, close with many celebs like Eminem. Likely used the celebrities to lure kids.

On a list of retailers at risk of default today..stock up 7% ha. Enjoy the scam while it lasts longs.
"For me, Wayfair is right on par with the cruise stocks. It really has no reason to exist and should only cater to a very small % of people in normal times. The trash and waste it generates and sells at negative margins - mostly cheap throwaway furniture and accessories - shipped from around the world, is sold as part of the myth of consumerism. At least see and feel furniture in person before you decide to settle down with it for a few years. This circlejerkpump needs to end now."
I love this stock. Bullish or bearish it's a money maker.
Fake technical reversal to upside started at 11.26 am. Trying to scare the shorts to cover. Short sellers buy calls and avoid the margin calls.
Next stop 274.44
"Sam the Sham, No post this morning but will say that he either ""bought the dip"" or shorted depending on how it closed."
Someone be buying mid day...
"I was here awhile ago with a $170 average and quite a bit of shares.I listed to all of the naysayers on here saying what a POS company this was, the negativity being spewed at that time was relentless. So I listened to them and I sold at a loss.Point is, I had made a decision to invest into this company because I I believed that they would very very successful. I had a $400 price target in mind for next year.Trust your instinct and dont listen to the noise on here."
And on its way to $116. Same pattern every day
I've been holding with that hope
"I got in $80 call option for nov 15, good luck guys, I think $4.30 per contract is cheep, anyway good luck to everyone"
$ostk is the future
"If they don’t post a profit this quarter, they may never be profitable. This quarter would’ve been the best opportunity for profit. This will be the defining moment. There will be no further chances"
A little profit taking is expected probably continues tomorrow I can see it settling around $150-$170 range till earnings next quarter
@bessie - no such thing as put insurance. People but put options and call them insurance.
W is headed higher.
We are close to this stock going back to reality. But it will take an earnings report to do so. Insiders are dumping yet someone keeps buying this.
Don’t touch this stock so whoever holding this cannot exchange cash. Lol
"All stupid messages, we are fine before earnings $108 minimum"
Weekend 121
Did anyone has a change to short this Pi g at 97ish today ?
"people need Food,Not furniture, DROPS BACK TO $29 where it belongs. they sell junk."
this stock is finished. Glad I sold everything on thursday a total flook. Will be down 50% tomorrow
"All these great analysts here! HeHe! Stock keeps flying:)Yea, sure, downgrade this!Loving this, do you really follow analysts?"
Great entry point! Wayfair projected to start profiting in 2020. Probably by then the stock will be $100+. Stay patient Longs! Remember stocks is a transfer of money from the impatient to the patients says Warren Buffett.
"Growth at any cost, and race to Zero profit margin, is not a long term sustainable business model. $W has 90% more to drop."
took a nice profit buying back half my short at 236. short at 323
Lets not forget about returns and their outlet center that's open 2 days a week. They may have to be open more days.
"anyone, reason for today rally? market down 2%, but W can be 15% and then end up 3% still? wow. clearly no manipulation."
"It looks to me like Monday was the top for now. W and it’s stock holders... may even have shorted a good amount to start turning this the other way. It is currently $32 over the average analyst estimate which we all know they are way, way overestimated!"
Option traders are driving the price up before expiration on Friday. Same happened last month - price went up prior to expiration and then went back down. It will happen again
"Too much expectations have been built-into the stock price. If its performance does not meet those expectations, it can drop big. Shorts - hold onto it till earning report comes out on August 5"
No one buying at this level. Everyone is selling. A lot of shorts so insititude has to drag up the price to make shorts to cover to make $
"same pattern every day.......drops some after the open, then goes green......happens every day"
how many here still holding shorts at this point?
... (NEWS)Wayfair is looking strong.... Reality :NOT. Going down hard. $100 next week.

$W Cowen boosts target on earnings expectationswww.stocktargetadvisor.com/blog/cowen-raises-wayfairwnye-target-to-375-on-earnings-expectations/
I think its oversold. You can get it at 2017 levels when it is twice the company it was then; as far as revenues go.
"One more day before Thursday to get sub-100. On Thursday, see you at 80.50-60 or lower by the year end."
"Where was that article on Amazon buying Wayfair for 5 billion, was it Saturday or Sunday"
Why are people buying at the high?
Pumping time is on !
"as the market goes down, W climbs up even more. confused yet? dont be. this is the best performing stock in 5 weeks 800% up. probably goes up another 500% over next month. everyone needs furtniture in recession and they have to order via Wayfair."
this company should be in the 50 by now. 
"Lot of PUT action today. Any hint? $107 PUT, exp 10/18"
"Wayfair's share price has crashed over 27% since peaking at $369. Wayfair had benefited tremendously last year from the pandemic lock downs and the shift to working from home. However, it is going to be a disaster going forward for the next few quarters when revenues are compared to last year's fantastic numbers. Plus, home furnishing is not consumable, people don't need to replace their home furnishing every year. In addition, the business economics of online home furnishing is lousy, as has been demonstrated for the last 18 years, nothing significant have changed going forward that would change the bad business economics. There is extremely high probability Wayfair's share price is heading for even more disastrous crash within the next 12 months!"
Up day today for Wayfair. Debt offering closed much higher than expected. If they decide to convert the debt to shares in 7 years time than price set 30% higher than last night close. Shooting up
What shocks me the most is the amount of people on this thread running cover for these skinhounds!
Wayfair will have trouble until Tariffs removed.
"Tom, you cover the short yet ? plan on holding it a long time, if necessary?"
How is this stock activity so manipulated. There are not many stocks that perform like this one. It's disgusting.
Earnings this week. Great results. Fake guidance. Capital raise. Then this becomes the short of a lifetime.
29.34 % short of float - nice.
The trend short on any bounce is working !
Very small down move today on basically no volume...
Manipulation at its best
waiting for my 78 again
"Check out HOME..$4.94...how Wayfair is up so much and they don't even make money yet, is beyond me!"
This is a long play stock. You shorts are here trying to scare ppl into selling. We're headed for 110+ and you know it. Watch out for the Bear Trap
Amzn & Shop drop 5-10% in the last few days and W pops up $40 In 1 hr ??? Yeah right= pure manipulation
So they make 8 billion a year lose 1 billion a year and how much profit is there
You'd be wise to get out now. I have a feeling this lofty price cannot hold up to tomorrow's earnings announcement.
Cover shorts! Cover now! Lol
"Another gift ! $143.35!! How could anyone in their right mind, not buy???"
new ATH today coming.
"In the past 30 days, 12 estimates have gone higher for Wayfair while none have gone lower in the same time period. The trend has been pretty favorable too, with estimates moving from a loss of $1.80 a share 30 days ago, to earnings of 82 cents today, a significant move."
No resistance to $144 - target is $44
#$%$ Company
W is down 5.14% to $121.15
I am not a professional by any means however it appears that someone has been slowly either accumulating shares or liquidating a short position. :))
"Sell Sprucey House, Sell!!!!!"
Buy the dip!! Going green again today!!
"Buffet hopefully you didn't buy this lie, going down"
"this is incredible. W issued a convert, which will dilute shareholders and the stock is ripping. Also, nasdaq is down as reopening trade is apparent with airlines, cruise etc. up, which shows people are rotating out of winners during the shutdown, which should put pressure on W. bizarre."
"MACD, RSI, Candlestick Charts, Trends, Volume all are your friend"

"TOM, there you go!! load that truck up!! you gotta know when to hold em, know when to fold em, know when to walk away, know when to run!! shorting this when the millennials showed their colors was PERFECT!! lmao..."
Look at the 1 and 5 year charts. You will see stock performance in response to covid is characterized by huge swings. Sentiment is always overly granular. BTW Benjo was on here at the highs pumping 340 to 400 level prices last summer.
"onward and upward!! love this stock !! green every day this week.... you cant hold it down, tom!"
W coming back strong!! It always does!!
sure hope you bought that nice dip this morning! what a gift! $3 swing so far.
"Looks like oversold, we should see at least $2 up from here before close"
"Sell more, lost more. Not profitable. Don't need to be..."
Lock and reload.
"For those interested in why Wayfair popped this week - there are 2 macro events that likely played a role.1. Biden began his push for the $2,000 stimulus checks this week.2. Motley analysts made bullish call that Wayfair has overtook Amazon as the biggest furniture e-commerce site."
Much better value stock is OSTK. An investor/trader gets OSTK + Medici Ventures which is OSTK's wholly owned subsidiary which includes the first SEC approved tZero for blockchain and digital currencies.
"Double top at $323, couldn't break through, couldn't hold $320, broke through supports, momentum going away."
"Don’t think 20,000 or more furniture sellers are going to just lie down to cheap Chinese junk tooth pick disposable furniture. They are gearing up"
"Literally any day, any minute this will make network news and plummet. I’ve made good profit, but time to sell my share and take profits to avoid losing it all, and then some."
"wayfair wont be profitable, but it will shock the market in how much closer it is."
OK. we r up. CNBC talking about WayFair [W] 20 to 227 & they say buy after being up 800%.... so what's the big deal.if FSLY is up 150% .. shorters should try W.
"This is amazing... ""How much money do you lose on every sale?? Ok .. here is more money to go sell more at a loss."""
"Green shortly...In my opinion, partnerships with Beyond Meat / Tilray for Musk-designed solar-powered drone delivery of edible vegan pot couches should propel near my $10 Trillion conservative market cap"
$15.25 BILLION market cap now!! lmao.....and it just keep going higher as Wall Street keeps raising targets...
OSTK and W moved in tandem today. Great day trading opportunities. Get in low and get out quickly. Would hate to be the buyer at 290 today.
definitely another day where they unloaded tons of that extra stock offering onto the market. This happened about three weeks ago. On a Monday. Stock went down about $20. It rebounded the very next day.
"If you see this up like a timber, and they sell a timber. you know what will happen to the timber. After that they become a tinder after off the chain IV."
other incredibly run for wayfair..... I feel for shorts.... I really do!!!
"So it went up $9 off yesterday's close then dropped $20, all on no news? And you don't think it's a racket?"
"Financial strength AnalysisW is one of the most highly leveraged companies in the Internet & Direct Marketing Retail industry and has a Debt to Total Capital ratio of 284.42%. Additionally, the percentage of debt used in its capital structure grew this year. The company could face trouble servicing its debt as both its Interest Coverage and Quick ratios show that neither operating profits nor current assets alone are great enough to satisfy interest obligations."
super manipulated stock
This years low 45$
"When the economics of a business, such as Wayfair, does not make sense, it would get worse as time drag on. Wayfair is doomed, heading toward $20 and beyond."
heading higher
A furniture company posed as an internet company. Low margin and huge loss. what can go wrong?
I'm pretty confident that no bull would want to hold this thing past earnings. That would be super scary... unless they know something the 20+ analysts dont know lol... avg. consensus: 80$!!! pigs can't fly ladies and gents
"TOM, TTD keeps acting up on us.... I shorted again at 231...."
Sell before you are left holding bag!! This is the last pump before a massive drop.
"So Wayfair says on Twitter that after a couple hours they completed their investigation upon themselves, deleted the ads, or changed the pricing on hundreds of items. They have found themselves not guilty and everyone should move along. A full investigation by the federal government is likely. How long will it be before they show up to take their computers. Researchers also finding ads on Amazon And beginning to search eBay. I Imagine they’ll be starting to look on overstock as well as others. ￼It’s not looking good for e-commerce. ￼ this could get really ugly. ￼Darn shame that shareholders got caught up in this. Track your losses for the class action that will likely follow. ￼￼￼"
Every company reporting is burning cash big time. Volatile market up today down tomorrow.
I really don't get the on-line ordering and W business model. There must be a ton of returns. I want to sit in the chair or couch I'm buying. Virtual comfort just doesn't work for me.
Will be lots of days like this coming for W
load up the trucks!! lmao..... watch and learn.
Like Tilray opens @$22 zooms to $300 down to $6
Definitely a lot of leaks before earning. Falling 20% before earning and then 20% today.Just amazing. For Credit Suisse to set a PT of $180 just before earning just tells how corrupt the system is right now.
good buying opportunity.
"Anything selling on line for the next 18 months are the winners in this market. If you're not selling on line and have a brick and mortar store as well...you are living in outer space. AT HOME (HOME 2.60, Michaels Stores MIK, $2.72 and everyone is using Etsy or doing crafts) UPS, AMZN are winners!"
"why are all these firms trying to pump this thing further? valuations are already WAY over the top, what's the motive, they can't be this blind."
"today is one long, deranged kick in the nuts...not sure why its down...I saw no bad news"
"Wow-Not a word by crooked Zacks or any of the other manipulators about the dilution and the $230 stock , $3 billion hog feed"
"crazy forward PE, who is buying this garbage???"
Wayfair couldn't even make money on 3.5 pct unemployment. we will be experiencing 6 to 8 pct on a normalized environment.
10x increase in 3 months. What justifies this?  And it was trending down for months even before the virus!
W from as low of $115.50 just last Friday to a high yesterday of $134.50 in just 4 days !! An $18.50 jump on no news... its coming down to a least $120. This pig  should be trading at $65 to $75 at the most.
People have lost their minds when it comes to this company. It's CLEARLY being propped up. This valuation is in no way realistic.
UNBELIEVABLE.....from Mar low of $21+ to today. Congrats to those who got on the train.
"At some point. Though I don't know when the market will ""act"" rational on this. Classic example of non rational pricing longer than many can hold onto their shorts."
IKEA ( a company that knows about selling furniture) is now opening stores in US malls cause they know you need to see the product - smart move - see ya W
"Wayfair only up $3 so far today??? whats the deal?? whats keeping it down?? must be manipulation...yeah, thats it."
See the tweet by BeachMilk of July 11th. This is not a conspiracy theory. I'm selling all my positions. The FBI is investigating Wayfair.
I see we're back to some big firm trying to support the stock price after taking a large position...
"When market up, Wayfair down, as it should be. When market down, Wayfair down, as it will be."
Doesn't seem sustainable to me...https://www.bbb.org/us/ma/boston/profile/furniture-stores/wayfair-llc-0021-90233/complaints
Reminds me Roku crash
Who thinks this will go below 180 by end of week ?
"Wayfair has benefited tremendously from the pandemic and the sudden spike of demand. I still think going forward is challenging for Wayfair, mainly due the bad business economics. Wayfair is not Amazon, online retail by itself is barely profitable, unlike Amazon, Wayfair does not have much more profitable divisions, such as AWS, logistics services, advertising platform, and Prime membership to boost profit. Even if Wayfair could achieve $2.45/ share of earning this year as projected, it is trading at 110x forward P/E ratio. Why would anyone pay 110x P/E for a company that sell heavy and bulky items online with very bad business economics and thin profit margin even during best of times? I still think Wayfair has 80% to drop further, to $50/ share. Anyone has a much different or much more optimistic opinion?"
shooting star candlestick
"Insiders selling, look at 13F !!"
ALL CLEAR !! Load up the boat!! $143 tested again and held like a champ!! Buy the bounce up!! ...... sorry Tom!!
Market is up 450 and this is still down today. That is not a good sign. I've got bets it is below 80 after earnings.
I am starting to lose faith in this stock what do you think time to sell?
Another OPPORTUNITY!!!!To get the heck out!!!!
Going to tank hard after the next losses date.... losses just keep mounting with no profits expected in the foreseeable future! ...$10 billion market cap.....I don't think so.
W market cap is bigger than Ford Motor Company’s - No way ! That tells you this is an over inflated scam
There's never been another stock like this in the history of the stock market!! There is no top.......
Reshort this big again . Wish me luck !
I did a little straddle oct puts 135-130. Triple play did it few months ago. Looked ok two weeks ago. We will see
"Finally, people appreciates Wayfair"
The more the revenue the more they lose. I don't think this company will be around in 12 months. Failed business model. Just my opinion.
"Wayfair and Peleton both crack me up, as their companies tout a temporary sales blipbecause of the crisis. They will both still lose money.The losses will even be worse than before."
when is the earnings release?
Whoa....what just happened? Stock gets halted and then goes from $25 to $30 in like 20 minutes...?

OK I am tired of this. Here it goes. Down rest of day and tomorrow will be a blood bath. I am locked and loaded
get into HOME (At Home) 16.50 smaller version of Wayfair 200 stores and growing 60%
Bankruptcy next
W reached a 52 Week low at 73.06
"Good luck longs!!!On Aug 24, 2020, 10% Owner, Director and CEO, Niraj Shah, executed a sale of 4,098 shares in Wayfair (NYSE:W) for $1,427,169. Shah,"
the most resilient stock in the world!! is Wayfair!
Still has a lot more to fall folks.
CEOs and directors sell for reasons. Now we know. The 25% short positions are for a reason too. Get out now!!!!
"up on Friday, I see!! thats a good thing for Tuesday! still down $5400 on my calls..... shouldn't be a problem..."
"Tech BUBBLE, all over, insane"
"Stimmy checks going straight to Wayfair! Dont worry, it'll be down to $280 in two days."
Who is holding up this stock?
last few days at 2 et. It goes to extremes. If up or down it runs that way. Let's see if it is same today
short W long OSTK should be best risk adjusted reward in this market as of today.
"173 to 60? If people are losing money in the market they are not going to be shopping,"
a Ton of Shorts in today. Do they have the guts to stay short in a bull run ? Naaaa!!
"Yup, it's always very easy to upgrade an overhype bubble stock to attract small shareholders jump on ship in order for those institute to dump all the stocks on them."
Boys ! I told you go with the trend
Is Wayfair selling virgins?
"true or not , let's face it , this is a good short opportunity"
W surges ahead on massive volume!! Amazing company .....
"Dilution dilution dilution and more dilution. Plus it’s all being suppressed and more sneaks in - I thought the suppression Of the dilution was To protect the price — but it’s not, it’s for more dilution to sneak in -260’s tommorrow - 240 by wed, getting closer to the 230 of the 12 million shares that was suppressed last week"
When should I sell my Sept put contracts? up nicely now. will it drop below 100?
Book Value Per Share (mrq) -10.09
@sam How are you ? Hope you got out of TTD. Got a big hair cut today .
$W is a 10-bagger in under 5 months. That is historic. Not sure there are many other examples of this type of price action in a relatively short time.
if anybody knows sam personally they might want to do a welfare check
"W- no way, folks"
Tanking nicely as predicted ...... Been waiting for weeks shorting every day! Making some money last three days! Makes you wonder what people were thinking running it up to $126 ... Like a gift!
"The only way AMZN can survive now is to come under wayfairs wing, either selling themselves to wayfair, or a partnership. Otherwise it's adios, amzn! I would bezos is on the phone as we speak, begging for a deal.....Wayfair holds all the cards now..."
Going up on no volume. Hedge fund clowns blowing up the bubble for bigger pop
The market in 2020 is buy the DOGS of the DOW. When the numbers tell you to short then you buy. When you should buy then you sell. W will be the winner of 2020. Going to $160 again. They will beat revenues and earnings. Watch and learn Home Gamers!
"Buy, buy, buy"
This stock is an outstanding longterm play. Short term expect more volatility.
"Well this has been my biggest loss to date- called it short way too early and have been burnt to a cinder.All I can say is that if you are short, make sure you have more ammo to stay the course. I do believe this company is junk and current valuation is absurd to me, but this is a strong lesson in the fact that you cannot expect the market to always be logical and act according to fundamentals.Congratulations to the longs and I hope the shorts get their success at some point, but both parties should be very careful out there!"
Great co
The forecast for Q1 2021 earnings is back below $0. Still following that down trend. This Covid blip was a one-timer for W operating at a profit. Look out for more debt issued dilution.
Does higher fuel prices hurt W? has to result in higher shipping prices I would guess
Volume just stopped... interesting how they can do that.
MASSIVE volume on this run up!! $300 coming soon.
"Heard cost of deliveries has gone crazy up because of the covid and delivery services jammed , extras covid pay for workers - wonder what that will do to the Bottom line"
"I am confused. The market is flying today on vaccine hopes. This is horrible news for W. A company that is 100% dependent on, online sales. HMMMMMMMMM. Once again. An illogical move for an illogical stock."
Since 2016 always twice a year short squeezes occur! Trade that way! When the trend is up on a short squeeze buy! Cover with selling put options on the way up! Only if you think it will go down! You must only trade in long term options. After they snag $$$ from the poor! It usually will trade back to normal levels.
Just heard that W got alerted at https://shr.link/Beststockalerts. I hope it pushes us higher!
Get ready to buy
"Short squeeze that’s all- stores are open(million of stores across the world and they have also adopted to on-line selling unlike at the start of China virus, when stores were caught with their pants down) plus people are dealing with life woth the China virus, plus and vaccines. The hypers will get burned"
Ok guys! Been watching this stock since 2015! Yes the stock is fixed. On bad news but and on good news sell! If you don’t believe me spend a day and research! Don’t fight it! The fix is in! When you research this look at every time there was an alert saying the sock is being investigated! It has always went up 100% of the time
"Wow, for next quarter they said their ADJUSTED EBITDA - how removed from real earnings can you get - margin will go from minus 3% of revenues to minus 6%. Antonio is right - the more they sell the more money they lose, EXCEPT for the executives with masses of stock options they pay themselves. At some point, and it could be soon, analysts will start downgrading the stock."
Its actually so brutal watching these shares slowly trade as retail traders keep buying institutions positions at high prices...
300 coming
Was down below 110... ran up to 130... now down almost to 110... not asking anyone to predict the future but does anyone understand the market enough to explain why this went up and down without major or minor company news?
"Wayfair, 33% down from $349, much more to drop. Sudden increase in demand from the pandemic is not repeatable, and the economics of selling heavy and bulky home furnishing has not changed in meaningful way. There is zero to very little profit margin."
go back where it belongs to. $20
"insanely low volume today. Wondering if the buyback money is nearing its end. 50 days, 50,000 shares a day, $290 avg... would put them at the $700m authorized."
"Sam, Good day for us short . Still holding you short position ?"
"Stairs up.....elevator down! Watch and learn! Don't know when it will happen, but it will! Way ahead of itself here."
"We have had greater volume than today’s EVERY day since 10/18/18 (the last time that we’ve seen volume this dismal). But guys, it’s MASSIVE!!!!!!"
"from here down to 230 there is no support. it's funny how looking back the price gravitated to $230 so many times and we publicly find out weeks later why. Total fraudulent manipulation and insider info of the convertible bonds. I hope for the company to go bankrupt and large losses to all the Funds that paid for ""analysts"" to write marketing stories how the party would never stop."
Hype train running out of steam. Low $200s post earnings.
surprised this isn't green today.
I said yesterday it'll rebound! Trust & patience!

JUST SELL-SHORT. This is going to see double digits. COVID plays are over.
Covered my short...this will go to $35 blink of a second..people are buying online
W went up just so we could all enter new short positions. Then it went down. You got to love this stock. Its so accommodating.
For those of you who are short and getting worried about your marginShort puts below your sell price and it will essential act as a reversed covered call on your stockI shorted yesterday at 170 and sold the 160 put for $10.00 so my margin has been unaffected
New sales tax could be another headwind for Wayfair:https://www.cpapracticeadvisor.com/sales-tax-compliance/news/21137890/what-to-know-about-ecommerce-sales-tax
Hola
w has been a market makers play ground..but one day it will not pop back up - then its going down to $120 and fill that gap at 120.....w is up 70% in lasr 18 days ----pe is way to high --…..long volume has slow way down. this could be the best short play …..its time to retrace to $120
"this makes no sense, i mean i get that its a short squeeze but this cant go on forever. It can just go do 190 pull back, short squeeze to 220 and so on to 2000 i mean, when does this stop"
Got right back where we started.. what crazy manipulation
"with recession around corner the furniture sales growth has to slow. the stock is max can climb to 350, but can suffer huge downfall when market corrects. buy at your own risk."
What year will W be profitable?
"TOM, you still short ? Im taking it below $100 after earnings..... just so you know!"
"Yes, it was bound to happen..... losses are now extreme...."
Time to SELL.The REVENUE and earnings will never justify current valuations. This is an online version of BBBY.SELL NOW.
True Wall Street Hedge Funders fleeing risking assets and allocating to W for its massive growth and industry-leading massive cash flow margins
@Sam good call as always !
More pain is ahead tomorrow.
this is pump and dump! the ceo and its pe friends are the reason for all purchases inflating the price. this will crash - but only they can decide when.
Why is it going up
would someone tell me why someone pays $300 fr a share to get about a $ in profit a year. Even with the all the help this pandemic has giving to this company. That is the best they can do. Some on loan me $300 I will give them $5 a year
Why is it up today?
"So funny listening to desperate Shorts trying to force W down. Monday will be a huge up day, watch and learn. Two days of selling is over, you had better cover pre market. The comments being made were the same last q but the stock continued to recover."
Here comes a daily new low in the last 10 min.
"Reviews 1,863Filter by:Excellent 14%Great 3%Average 2%Poor 7%Bad 73%DOES THIS NOT CONCERN ANYBODY? THIS IS ON TRUST PILOT. ONE OF THE MOST REPUTABLE REVIEW PLATFORMS OUT THERE."
little step back.....had to happen sooner or later........no worries.....shorts will bring it back.
"So I would expect this to run up until earnings.. unless people start looking at the numbers. No doubt Wayfair had a great Q2, but look at the estimates. They are expecting them to be positive and profitable. We all know that they could sell billions of items and they would still be losing money. Can anyone show me where this profitable revenue is going to come from.????With 28 analysts covering W, the consensus EPS estimate is $0.79, and the high and low estimates are $2.63 and -$0.32, respectively.2.63 positive.. not unless they cook the book.. lowest expectation is -$0.32. That will be a big stretch as well. I think the estimates are going to drive the stock down.. They will have their best quarter ever, but because the street is expecting more the stock will not react well."
Be bullish when it is bullish: W target raised $120!
Overstock down over 40% from recent all time Aug High - that would make W worth $195! Very over valued right now
"TOM, I got my TTD short at $226... lots of trapped shorts covering today, so I think... im under a little water right now, but I think a will make a few bucks..."
what an awesome company!!! just awesome!! its on its way to $200..... load up the trucks again!!!
It's a Cinderella Story !!
"I'm long W no need to hide that It simple amazes me that any trader or hedge firm would want to short this stock with the USA locked down and every family getting stimulus checks. Granted many will pay bills, however the Wayfair customer profile is mostly upper middle class homeowners who are working from home with ample income and reserves. IMO W trades over $100 by May"
Don’t feel bad for me! I have been in and out four times just today! All small profits! Trade/gamble
"Two friends at W tell me sales are way off this quarter. Since the stimulus ended they said, sales have fell off significantly."
This is an upgrade for me too. A buy!
"Not sure how anyone else feels, but there is a whole lot of potential bad news this weekend vs. any good. Banks getting crushed, energy also getting hurt, just not feeling it. JMHOGood luck!!"
"Where does the top line need to get, for the bottom line to be positive? Will that happen this holiday season?"
CEO just stepped down
"poor TOM shorted this at $141.12....... I tried to tell him... $162 now! wasn't that long ago..... another one that didn't listen. ashes to ashes, dust to dust......."
Come to Papá Wayfair.... Lol  all I need is $115.00 to cover.
Best performer on the NYSE today...True Wall Streeters and hedge funders know this cash flow generating disruptor is where to be for safety and explosive growth
Next stop $82.70
"Chart Looks Very Bullish ,Daily Chart Looking Positive http://tos.mx/Ctv3MlClick on Chart image. Do not need tos to view"
BYND is green again!!! unreal!!
Someone just bet $2.5 million that W is headed south of $130 by jan '23. Interesting....
"wayfair off to the races again!! what a company!! ... Tom, not looking good today!"
"W moving up as more shorts cover....afternoon should move it up even more as many will wait until the last minute....unwinding options and hedged positions should do that....if you bought the dip, wait to sell for the quick day trade.."
"Wayfair Inc. – Lying by OmissionW reported solid 2Q19 results that beat on revenues, adjusted EPS and customers but that’s only the glass-half-full version. Total net revenue increased 42% YoY to $2.343BN, with domestic business running at EBITDA breakeven while international burned $70MM. Free cash flow was negative $91MM.Management saved guidance “for the call” with analysts and excluded it from the press release, a clear case of lying by omission that duped the media into pushing the stock on W’s 2Q beat and a possible Reg FD violation. Forecasts call for flat top line in 3Q19 with total net revenue of $2.23-2.28BN. Guidance is for negative EBITDA of 2%-3% in the U.S. and negative 6.0%-6.5% overall ($120-130MM total operational burn). Adding in capex of $50-70MM will balloon free cash burn to an estimated $200MM further eroding liquidity. With gross margins of under 25%, these metrics do not support an entity trading at $12BN in market cap. or over 1.3x annualized sales.A review of W’s financials and SEC filings casts doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in our opinion:Annual losses of hundreds of millions of dollars,A dwindling current ratio of 0.7 with cash funding for one year,A semi-toxic series of convertible loans that makes it difficult to compute the derivative impact on the stock price or returns to shareholders,A P&L and cashflow statement predicated on massive capex and overhead to deliver heavy furniture products across the U.S. and Europe with no hope of generating excess returns let alone cash flow.The abrupt same day resignations of W’s CTO and COO last month and insider stock sales by W’s CFO may foreshadow something ominous in the cards for this overpriced particle board shipper. We believe the Company will have to execute a substantial financing to shore up its balance sheet, and in this market dominated by Trump trade tariff headlines we think any deal would get done far lower than current levels, if at all.Management said one thing right on their “analyst call” – nothing is a straight line to EBITDA+. In this case, we see a straight line to distress. Just because you spend billions of dollars creating something to migrate traditional business processes online does not mean it is worth anything in the future as a standalone Company. We are initiating W with a SELL recommendation and near-term price target of $50, which is approximately 0.5x annualized revenues or $4.5BN and based on 92.5MM shares O/S.Disclosure: I am/we are short W.Additional disclosure: We intend to provide additional comments in the future in our ongoing coverage of W."
why going down all sudden
Deep state in control of this one...Strong Federal Reserve and Rothschild affiliations here...Check senior management affiliations (Fed) and investor base from Mar / Apr 2020 capital raise (Roth)
"Based on revenue growth those ads work but thank God for commercial skipping technology. The ads are a cross between boring and annoying and it looks like they used employees who weren't busy to ""star"" in the ads. This has me concerned about their judgement. They need a professional advertising firm with a proven track record as others move into the large, bulky, low-margin, low-to-no-profit product space. Great job on supply chain management, excellent use of technology, worried about low barrier to entry. What happens when Amazon or Walmart add a Big Stuff tab to their websites?"
wayfair in deal to purchase AMAZON from Bezos ; CNBC reports ; don't die LAUGHING HAHA !
"Enter the late to the party money, just in time to pick up the tab."
Wayfair has more debt than assets... the more they increase sales the higher their losses !! This is the perfect stock to short.
Joel... you are doing good with BYND puts!
show me $150 today
Had a order to short just below $80 and missed it byten cents this morning.Someone please pump this up again!
Buy the bubble!!
Over sold
Here comes Sam next post. Bought on dip and got out after it went back down. Yawn.
WOW
"if you still think W is going up, let me show you their position:- W is way overvalued -Their sales where good bcs all of the stores where closed, not anymore. Thier competition is back and running-The Nasdaq etc are way overpriced and a pullback will come soon draging everything down with it-There is a Finance war with china and W is importing everything from China! Once they throw some crazy 20-30% tax, W will be making 2/3 of what they are making now even if they keep doing the same sales-W is a fomo stock which will be forgotten and will keep falling simply bcs there will be no intrest-No body will invest long term in a company that went from $20 to $190 i 2 months at this price-W entered a bearish state which will need a strong catalist to enter out of (The next probable would be in a month, their earnings)If you made some crazy money on this run up i feel like you should take your money somewhere else before you lose it. Everything is against this stock and will be for a few months."
Loop capital..Amazon should buy W...great one overvalued company buying another overvalued company
"If you’re looking for a watchlist covering the great stock setups every day before the open, I recommend https://daytrading.group/DailyStockWatchlist They send daily set ups and its free. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."

all a reaction to stimulus headlines
"People are dying in the streets in New York and wayfair is up,yeah that seems right!!!!!!!!!!"
What’s the fundamental value here? Maybe 40-50 bucks? Or more? But it’s headed to 1000 right? Yep all makes sense. Keep on buying.
just bought the dip. $153.60. couldn't resist...
I think andrew left short wayfair stock at $42 so he is in the black if anything. And if you are buying W to bet on them being acquired then good luck. Why would anyone buy them when you can easily wait them out until they get desperate...I mean at the end of the day you have to make money and they have not made any indication of being profitable anytime soon. They have all this top line growth but zero profit to show for.
How did stock go from 21-340 in 52 weeks?
If a hedge fund came in to short you would see $40 a day drop
from $21 to $230...yeah this evaluation is spot on and there is absolutely no manipulation.

This stock will be wiped out by inflation
"Bad idea to buy a few shares tomorrow, the day before earnings ?Many thanks. ! Stay safe !!!!"
Who likes to beat the bears Rnx
"It’s been a great run back up to $100 plus. But just like criticism of Shorts not changing direction when it was down to its lows, the same applies to Longs. Don’t get too greedy. I expect W to drop this week and will start shorting it tomorrow morning. Trade on instinct not emotion."
The Cramer Covid picks they are trying to get them to all time highs. They are pumping with every fly by night journalists paying them make articles. They have big money to make. They also have sheep running around posting in all chat rooms.
Wayfair is up 9.27% to 281.98
And there goes wayfair! Taking off at 3:00 per usual..... Same thing every day....low volume run up ....
"Dear Educated post, you are a fake one. Every body knows that W will be a victim of the cruel down turn cycle. No matter how much the Fed will print the money into the market, all go to the secured and rich dividends stocks, not the permanent loser like W. In the good old day, W still does not have a chance in any shape or form against the good and established company like COST, AMZN. It is a big mistake to think W will have a chance to survive or get scooped up by some other company. The margin is laser thin, other wise, Lazy boys is not in the BK court."
"while I WISH Wayfair went bankrupt, the article is moronic. no company will go bankrupt at a time interest rates are .5% for 10 year bonds. the FED created hundreds more zombie companies. in fact, Wayfair just retired the 2022 notes and issued the new ones saving them $100m. more realistic is that Amazon, over stock, HomeGoods, and this newer At-home cause a stalemate in a competitive market. it's more realistic that Trump bans Chinese furniture than this company going bankrupt in 2 years"
Morning guys. Hope you added some short shares this morning pump .
"Lmao......$4 pop and only 88,000 shares traded! There's just not enough shares put there.....it's being run up artificially."
"Weak hands cleared out now, lets pump it"
hey is it time to short this again ... ?
True Wall Street Hitters running to safety of this massive cash flow generating disruptor....Green in a sea of red...
any news? upgrade?
"hey TOM, hows the short working out for ya? im afraid you better cover and take your losses."
And GREEN it is as the pattern stays consistent ....... many shorts have to cover. Volume picking up as expected....those that bought the usual dip at the open will be rewarded
"No more up since Stock price was already too high even for the positive report(only due to the Chinese virus) -stores will take it from here. A one hit wonder, down we go"
"TOM, you are long this?? and added more shares around $150??? I hope not......"

This stock has to be played carefully! You must buy and sell on it’s trends ! Looked like it was going down today but when it came back to 154 it was a buy because of many trend factors! Locked up $880 . This stock is fixed so trade the trends not the news! Example good news it trends down. Bad mews it trends up. Crazy as it seems that’s the way it is. Don’t fight it.
"I do not understand why anyone would invest their hard earned money on a company that is $130 to $170 a share, even with all those sales the company is losing over $7 per share. But the analysts will say its a buy. I don’t get it."
omg the insider selling has been voracious
"Wow, still analyzing? I guess you don’t get it.I’ve never seen so many negative comments on a stock that is going through the roof! Some of us have made big money, I guess we don’t understand the real price it should actually be:)"
"coincidence? I think not. a) someone named the furtniture exactly same name as missings children. you can't find me products such as Susan chair, Adam patio, henry couch, beth tv stand. b) price. $15k for furtniture? even gold furniture can be cheaper. this cant be a coincidence."
I have been buying calls since $88 but sold them! When people realize they can google all products W sells and get them cheaper oooopps
Wayfair worth than $17b ???? I will short more money
"Still haven't seen an official statement from the FBI stating ""Wayfair is not a sex trafficking and/or money laundering website"". Please provide one if able. If not, then it still smells like  around here."
I WOULDN'T SPENT THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR ON FURNITURE THAT I HAVEN'T TOUCHED OR FEELED. WAYFAIR Q1 IS TEMPORARY WILL FADE AWAY FAST WHILE EVERYTHING ELSE IS OPENING UP AND PLUS IT'S PRICING LIKE IT'S ALREADY PROFIT BILLIONS WHEN IT'S LOSING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS
Barons just downgraded Wayfair saying stock price will recede 25% as the economy starts to open. For me I think the whole market will drop a bit do Wayfair could see profit taking.
what a irrational world that we are living in. a company that lose money like crazy and its stock is somehow all time high.
"Based on fundamental business economics and financial future valuation, $W has much much more to drop!"
"Well I sold around 80 for a 100% profit, this price makes no sense now... what if they are still losing money ah!! Wish I closed my eyes and held now... haha gl all"
They are not going to let over 8000 option call contracts for the $190 go worthless
60 $ by January
anyone know why is it down? load up the gravy train.
Come on shorts. You were brave to short this down to 225 three weeks. Let’s see you do it again so I can buy
There does not appear to be a single purchase by insider in all of 2020. Remember this stock was at $20 - if they had confidence in longterm business prospect would they have purchased on open market???
I don't own Wayfair but if not for this stock I would of never kept Overstock as long as I did with a cost avg of 7.80 wayfair was the only one I could look at in similar field that made me decide to hold on to Overstock. Both have had incredible runs .
The next CAVANA. W has no stopping until 50-60. All furniture return costs be loss. Buy puts. I m bearish.
early retirement in my future...
Why the drop?
Outperforming everything...We''l be green shortly People need safety of this huge cash flow generating disruptor
They tried to squeeze the last few weak shorts now it’s time to crash down to earth.
W closing price today. Any guesses? My guess is W will close at $292.50 per share.
"230 ish zone, would be a buy price... shorts will cover there.... see you at the finish line."
"I am no chart expert but the chart for sales is up nicely, its the profit chart that goes the exact opposite, down severely.Bottom line is the more Wayfair sells the more money they lose. This is not a bash, its just fact."
W will not be profitable for many and many quarters ! Hope you long sold this morning .
wayfair already said their loss rate is still going to be 7.5-7.8% or the normal rate. Not sure why anybody thinks they will beat earnings. They will beat top line but they normally do. Which is not good when your loss rate remains the same. One day they may learn. Being the cheapest is not always the best.
Who bought @ 300 premarket? It will be among the most actives one today.
"The higher Wayfair revenue goes, the higher their losses and cash burn. Their customer service will automatically issue credit up to 26% of invoice value if you call and complain about damage, wrong size, wrong color, etc. If you say you want replacement, they often times say just keep the item they originally sent, and then send replacement. Poor packaging by manufacturers, poor handling by warehouse personnel and cartage drivers, and poorly trained warehouse personnel at suppliers and Wayfair picking wrong items to fulfill orders is costing Wayfair hundreds of millions of dollars a year. It's easy for a company to grow revenue by more than 30% per year when the price your charging customers is significantly lower than cost, which is what Wayfair does every day of the year. I feel sorry for all the brick and mortar furniture companies that are trying to compete against companies like Wayfair that are selling their goods at well below cost. Wayfair needs a complete turnover of their senior management team, and need to replace with experienced retailers who can add discipline and internal controls."
Today Trump will double down on tariffs to China. W going to 150 today.
"Lots of shorts here, too bad been making a fortune while you over analyzing pros are watching by the sideline wishing you had bought it!"
"Absolute panic in HQ right now. At least one major resignation, and they have apparently refused to reprice employee stock options, so everyone is #$%$. More layoffs on Fri I think (but who knows). Was told that this quarters cash burn is 35% higher. than last quarter since deliv delays, cancellations. Return rate up over last qtr. not great when both customers and employees are upset"
So was W pushed just a hair over $90 on April options expiry day because of a large $90 options position?Or is this just coincidence?Such a manipulated stock. Pushed up on one week's worth of anecdotal sales.
"I’m literally down -$35k on my Puts wow, good thing they expire November so I have Until summer"
Obviously Wedbush was called by managing team and will get a sweet bonus.
"Fundamentals, earnings (losses), balance sheet, will eventually be prove out here and stock will trade in $20-$30 range. Noticed lots of insiders selling this one! but shorts (covering) running the show for now."
If you short this stock better be prepared with some capital - but - it drops to 275 maybe 260ish then rips back up.
$W Target Raised by Wedbush Outperform USD 330 » USD 345
Averaged down on same day. Doubled up on shares!! Tequila told me to man up!!
"Sales up 36% for a 5 day period. That means losses will be up 72% for that same 5 day period. It costs Wayfair A LOT to ship large and heavy items for free. All those BF week incentives also cost Wayfair a LOT of money.That said, I do expect the stock to trade modestly up on this ""news"". Analysts will pump the shyte out of it since it has been trading flat for too long. Expecting the inevitable upgrades any moment now."
"No one in their right mind will buy this stock at this price, other the hedge fund manager to push the price all the way up to just to dump it"
Institutional buyers can no longer justify this stock as a growth company with the sales up double digits as long as they lose 1 billion a year! Think about that! A vanguard trying to explain to its fund members !
"Furniture is one time buying goods last for years. Pandemic is over, no one will buy furniture as before."
I would short if I had the capital.
"Short squeeze to 416, no resistance until 367"
Does Wayfair sell bubble bath soap? Know what I mean.
do you think it’s worth buying the stock now?
Today there’s no proof. Tomorrow they raid. Don’t think for a second that this will be swept under the rug without an investigation. ￼
Peter Keith- no respect. You all need to buy before it hits 500.
Any value-is it worth taking a shot>
Alert to fellow longs / TWSH (True Wall Street Hedge Funders): I think I know what's happening...People selling very few shares (really light volume today) to buy Chewy.com (the legacy business of DotCom slayer PetSmart.com)….You should know this: Wayfair has an entire line of edible pet toys and furniture that is MUCH larger than Chewy's products...
Just look how many shorts are posting franticly. That tells you the stock is heading higher and they are totally scared. $30 to $80 in a matter of days. Can you imagine how much money they have lost. They really think they can scare folks to sell their shares based on their pathetic posts. For some reason they think if they post 100 posts per day everyone will sell. $90 next week will finish them off. Longs enjoy the long weekend.
This will touch 120 again in a few days
Waiting for $200. C'mon. This is as cheap as it will get. W will surpass Amazon.
"This one is primed for a momentous comeback down to earth,it went up for no reason, now it will come down, in at $192 short and ready to celebrate big"

"Market should be forward looking and Wayfair historic earning no way repeatable in near future even if we get another shutdown.Infact first shutdown make it big profitable and another shutdown may do reverse because people will not spend again on computer desk they already brought.People WFH and staying more home found need for furniture and they have no option but buy from online.This is one time event for two reason + 1 more reason Wayfair giving company specific.1.> They needed furniture to do their work and now they have furniture and they not going to replace that quickly.2.> Most furniture store don't invested online but now they working to build present. This going to drive sell to local furniture store even during next shutdown if ever happen.And biggest reason to sell /short this , you can find though google search.Look at all recent review. They are terrible. This can not only create huge slow down but can make it bankrupt. People talk they have millions of customer but looking at reviews with no good reviews ( Look at Amazon and other reputable companies review for compare, why matter because if people only put bad reviews, Same site other will have similar experience but no it's not.)This reason alone is enough to make it bankrupt. Furniture is hard business when it come to customer service and This company creating new very low standard there make local furniture stores way better."

"the CULT BUYERS are obviously BACK , TIME TO GO LONG BABY !!"
"wayfair, game changer, yeah right!"
15 out of last 16 trading downs have been down. I guess we are due for an up day but this stock never trades the way it should. No volume pre market. We will see
If you haven’t used Wayfair to buy anything then you know nothing. Shorting will only make you broke.
The momentum is out of this one. While YoY sales were up big expenses were up more which means there are diminishing returns. Balance sheet expansion and the net loss were financed by a big $150 million increase in accounts payable.
"This pig is still overpriced at $50/share. The two co-founders milk it every month for all they can. Look at insider trades for the past 3 years. All they do is sell, sell, sell for tens of millions in free money."
lmao....dipped at the open as always!! they powers up.....same pattern every single day!! so easy to trade this....shorts don't have a clue what they're doing....
"Some one did dirty job to keep W up all day ignoring all the falling index yesterday, which is obviously that upgrade news leaking out from BAC analyst earlier. It is really nasty for the brokerage house. Now we will see W will stay above 60 or not in the next few weeks, which I doubt it will."

"Like every other industry, the internet is going to change how we purchase things, furniture included. Long term hold on Wayfair. Less overhead, 1 day delivery, good quality, great webpage!!!"
Selling started early today at 06.20am. I’m expecting the markets to slowly drop today even though the Dow is up 220 pre market. W will drop to $110 today as bulls take profit. Today’s action will actually be driven by Bulls not bears.

I heard about W the other day on http://stocktip.xyz. It’s looking like an interesting play.
Sketcher shoes plunging after earnings. Furniture and home furnishings are next. W earnings can’t come soon enough!
Everything down. Wayfair up. On its way eventually to a $2 trillion company. Long-term strategy of not only shipping furniture manufactured in China to the U.S. But they will disrupt homebuilding industry by having Wayfair-furnished homes manufactured in China and shipped to U.S. Brilliant.

Great stock could be the new Tesla. I've read their latest 10K.
Ever increasing losses. Wayfair is now worth negative $120 million on balance...and getting worse.Nobody on Wall St cares though. Growth at all costs.Bring on interest rates so zombie companies like Wayfair go belly up.Wayfair is just a cash machine for its two founders. Look at the stock based compensation. It is ridiculously high.
"When the hedge funds bail out fast, afraid of a possible bankruptcy filing, this stock will drop like a bomb. I see it going back to the March 19th low of $23.51 per share. Then the Robinhood kids will bid it up to $60."
"the world lock down is about to happen... businesses are hemorrhaging. people are in fear. companies like W is ready to exit. if it were normal bullish time, I would be worry. time like this, any bounce is a dead fish bounce . not sure how dead fish can bounce, but you get the point."
If this reaches $95 then short away. I think that is their target for next week
"One day Alice, pow right in the kisser, this thing is going to correct, but it may take an overall market sell off to get momentum going a different direction. This is not an investment in the future it is a gamble on the short squeeze momentum. Wayfair will ultimately fail to ever make a profit. The cost structure allows no competitive advantage"

Was wondering if any of you have reported W to SEC for potential stock manipulation? Thx be now been following this stock on a minute by minute basis for the last month+ and there’s clear and blatant manipulation occurring. Have you ever seen a stock bump up faster in a complete free fall than W did last week?

Anyone buying at this level when the directors are selling. Just courous.
"There is no bubble here. Amzn has a pe of 151, Shop is over $1,000 a share and does not make a profit. You may look back at the March lows but that has little to do with today's prices, all stocks were at the low point back then. If they turn a profit Aug. 5 watch this stock go over $300. The new trend is buying your home furnishings online and along with free delivery and a large inventory to choose makes this a stock to hold long term."
Wall Street controls their media outlets. first article today said stock down due to deepening losses. now article states earnings better than expected. Shorting and options were put into the stock market for ONE REASON. to take people's money via MANIPULATION.At least you have a chance in Vegas.

Does this #$%$ remember what the color green is?
"it just ran $10 in less than an hour-getting ready to short again,there is No more News possible."
Say what you will BUT...bottom line is Wayfair will run out of money unless they sell more stock. They can't continue to float the losses with cash flow. That's why they laid off people. Does this sound like a profitable growing company laying off people? Not to me. Besides they already had their run up on NO news all street market hype and short squeeze.

"Without any profit, W still wants to put more cash on the endless way of losing business in order to grab the market shares. I just wonder when it will stop borrowing more money. Overstock already gives up to compete with AMZN and COST. I think W will dilute the value of the stock till ZERO."
Nothing can stop what is coming.
"Wayfair— continued huge OPP. Imagine Home Depot, Bed, Bath, and Beyond, Crate n Barrel, WalMart and other home destination type businesses all wrapped up into 1.. yes, Wayfair!"
What to buy after today market kaput? Any suggestion?
Since early 18 bought at 85 sold at 155 bought again at 90 sold at 160 4 no ago. Not bit 500 shares. It was fun. IMO W will never have EPS.
Look at the huge volume spike 20 minutes before the close yesterday and 20 minutes before the sales figures were announced. Somebody leaked the info. Where is the SEC?
these earnings are warning. 1. q2/q3b are one of s kind quarters. they are not sticky or persistent or recurring. 2. look at their gaap manipulation to come to profit. had to be reversed going forward3. sales growth is lower than projected in the best lockdown period for them. means sales growth id going to be a real challenge going forward. 4. consider the bubblicious nature of market and when recession hits whats going to happen to wayfair. ask your self if you going to be buying new tv set or couch when you dont have a job. 5. we are pretty much at the top price. may be another 10% upside cuz Jerome offs pumping non stop and markets can keep going higher. but music will stop. and wayfair stock will be the one without a chair.

"ah, yes, coming back nicely as planned!! in the money again! lmao...what fun!....now when to take my profits....hmmmmmm.."
Look at the price action. Slow steady same-slope increase all day. This is absolutely manipulation by programmed buying. Doesn't change the fact that it is up and I am down though. W was $27 just 30 days ago. Now $104. Hello?
Definitely surprised by price action on W given how all the other retail stocks are outperforming the market

"if you listen to W mid-qtr analyst call in Jun on their website, CEO said their revenue is trending up 90% over last year (going from 10b yearly revenue to 20 b annual). Still analysts have set the expectations intentionally low at 70% to make it easy for W to beat the lowball expectations and they can further run this pony post earnings. So, do not expect immediate return to normality /fall after the earnings."
we've been here before. It won't be a knock out until stimulus is over and a working vaccine is distributed
The ignorant investors out there must not truly know that all W does is sell furniture. They really believe this is a tech company. 27 billion market cap and they lose money every quarter.
Oops! It keeps going up!Keep analyzing:)
24 analysts average price target $87.67. I am not making this up. Check yahoo finance on the rhs of your screen.
Well little Mike I just unleashed the beast on some puts. Let us hope they get filled.

"Profit is forecast for 2030 .....until then Wayfair will continue to sell products for less than the break even cost. Great business model if compensation is share based, not profit based."
How far these growth companies like W shop etc can go?
"TOM, I just killed TTD !! I knew it would crack.... was 1200 shares short.... covered all but 300 shares so far....made over 22 grand so far..."
"Last year, W raised over $1B with a $145 conversion price. This new $535M at a $72.5 conversion price is a very low bar just one year later. W is still forecasting losses at 7.5 - 8.5% of total revenue. Make no mistake, they NEED this cash."
this is expensive at 150...lol
"If Wayfair cannot make the quarter profitable on increasing active customer, then it will never become profitable. In this internet age, customer loyalty is almost non existent, especially for big purchases. They cannot claim they are building a loyal customer base like snap lol. If something is available at Amazon or target, people will simply buy from them for better shipping and return. Business model will not work, and it hasn’t worked for years."
stop comparing it to amazon. the gross margins are terrible because shipping and then accepting returns on sofas/mattresses/coffee tables etc. is far more expensive and logistically challenging than freaking books and diapers. that fact will not change no matter how much revenue growth there is. the gross margins will continue to be terrible and this is a very challenged business. they now have to start opening stores to sell all the returned #$%$...
dale its time to cash out and take profits ---you can buy back at $110 to $125
Thank God I finally SOLD!!!! I bought 420 shares at 102 weeks ago and then watched it go to 23 dollars !!! Finally sold at 105 today !! UGHHH

Now another $1.2 billion (likely $1.4 billion with over-subscribing), just 4 months later.Of course, the actual tradable float is so miniscule that it is easily controlled by all of Shah's HF buddies in the Boston & Connecticut areas. Don't short this. You cannot compete against the Wayfair mafia.The Wayfair scam really needs to be looked at in depth by the SEC.Meanwhile, upper mgmt continues to sell their gifted shares every 2 weeks, like clockwork. Wayfair is simply a cash machine for the W C-suite."

True Story. My daughter bought a dining set from Wayfair. Upon delivery the table was damaged along with 2 chairs. One chair was missing from the order. She returned the table and they sent another table but it was damaged also. The one missing chair did arrived undamaged and they told her to keep the original 2 damaged chairs. She shipped the table back and a new one arrived with a scratch on it. Wayfair said they would send their repair company to fix the table. So long story short... she eventually accepted the last table delivered with the repaired scratch at 1/2 price. Wayfair said it was the way the MFG was packaging the merchandise. Does Wayfair report return merchandise and shipping cost? Maybe this is why they don't make money.
Dead cat bounce ?
Hopefully it will be close at 350 today.
"Why? Wayfair is a $200+ stock. Same reason AMZN trades at $2,00) and at $1,000 pre-earnings. They are playing the long term. They are the premier furniture eCommerce Company and better than AMZN in this space. Last week's earnings call and numbers supports this. They are executing on their plan. If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen as they say. This will rise dramatically as things settle in. Institutional holders aren't selling. $9,13,000,000 revenue in 2019, $6.78 in 2018 and $4.72 in 2017. 100% growth in 2 years! I'm buying at these levels. Good luck to all"
Remember the $3billon of scimming worth of dilution @$230/shares that was suppressed right after earnings report in August ???
lmao.....buyers now coming in......moving up as predicted.....
BBBY is reporting wednesday.This will fly if bbby reports good results. Watch out
Check the BBB . 1.5 stars. Read the reviews and it is pretty funny.
Bought based on Motley Fool recommendation--down 30 points should I sell
Well what is the next big short? I think w and my save do not have a lot more upside.
"Wolfe Research initiated coverage of the online home furnishings company with an outperform rating and a $145 price target.If you read article, there is nothing in it about being profitable. When does this company actually have to start making money?"
Of course don’t fight it join it!
There is strong support around $295. Market is dragging it down but its gonna shoot up when market is green again. Its a good buy right now.
WS crooks are holding W well today . Should drop at least $6.
@ $25 weeks ago and now $136. Highly overleveraged and not making money. This is bloodbath!
seems to have cast iron support at 234 but still don't trust it will hold.
"$95.00 Phase 1 Target ""60% of US women will be home with stimulus money to spend. The Wayfair shopper does not live hand to mouth. They will spruce up the the nest they are tired of.being jailed in, (Joe Knaz quoted during conference call). Lots of Legs here"
implied vol on puts are 300%. more likely to crash that tsla.pe equity firm taking it private is the only explanation for this absure parabolic rise.
a break and close below $250 would be a huge technical negative indicator. So far it bounces each time on 252. maybe when the options expire end of today
"shorts back in the basement. I told you, they come out once a month when W drops, then its back to the dark, cold basement. sunny day here. wayfair continues its ascent to all time highs.."

"Stock manipulation and cornering by management and some fund managers, SEC investigation is imminent. CEO also has a fraudulent past."
"nice run today...went up into close.... PERFECT! Tom, sorry about that short at $141.12. not killed by any means, but headed the wrong way.......the trend is in, low float and massive support..... time to make some more money."
"Here is my take. Q2 is going to be a monster. Sales up over 100%+ YoY and EPS will not only be positive, but a monster of a beat. Q3 sales guidance shouldn't show too much of a slowdown versus Q2 and Q3 EPS will be positive but not as much as Q2. Going to be very solid print. Question is, how much does the stock go up on this? I can't say this isn't expected at this point, especially with the $65 move higher over the last week or so after monster prints from AMZN, HOME and OSTK. Feels like the move already happened, but tape is crazy so maybe it keeps going."
Lmao.....W was down $8.... now only down $4.... watch and learn!! Glad I bought a ton more on the dip!! Calls and stock.....easy call.....like minting money..
LOL people expected a BIG drop and it's not even down 2% hahahaha
Don't panic!!!...don't panic...let the big boys sell first high...then panic!
I'm calling a top at $104.59! Why? Because I'm getting killed on my short and just shorted more. Lol......I will wait ......but it's not fun....damn cult stocks. Wish there was more volume in this pig.
"Great earnings. For everyone who likes the online furniture market: In Germany are 2 big companies (Home24, Westwing) which are in the same business (same growth rate and profitablity as well) and trade at a sales multiple of under 1. Wayfair should be a great stock in the future but just imagine if investors will rate Home24 and Westwing at the same multiple as Wayfair."
"This is insane. For the record, I have zero connection with this stock. I'm not shorting it. I'm following it because of this story."
Soon
IT attracted money inflow too fast and correction is coming
"I should have covered in the high $80’s, well will short it again when it gets higher, it it ever does. I my opinion they are going under."
"45,000 shares traded.....lol....... probably all insiders!"
buy BABA and short W... this should be a good trade
trading halted.... this thing should be free fall
Relative outperformance today shows true investors prefer massive growth and cash flow margins in W compared to has beens like GOOG...
700% in 2 months with no EPS not bad at all.
"Expect a bunch of upgrades to W so that the big guys can get out. The tariffs are gonna hurt W earnings, like they even have any lol"
"Each wayfair app download and install via Google search ad will cost wayfair $5-$10. So, go to Google, search our dear short stock, click on the ad and install the app. Uninstall.Rinse and repeat.Call to action for all who are short this fraud stock..."
Going down from here!
they finally opened up shares to short. They weren't lending any out until today. Very nice+
They say everything will be alright as they sell
Under yahoo statistics it show 110.91 % of the float is held by institutions! Huh?? How can that be?
Just wait until China says no product. Wayfair will have to get the Amish to start building product for them. The costs will be massive.
"There is an entity or entities that prop this up and created the run from 222 to 300 so the average cost of the offering would be so high -238-, if it was way lower the average price would be below 200. Who in retail is buying right now? No one."
3 months of upside to 200
"Those spreading the vicious, malicious rumor, are as bad."
What to do? short more or cover or buy?
Tom where did Sam go?
short covering will end soon and will be lucky to close green lol
Omg I might be able to get out short of my position at 121
"TOM, covered my entire short today! just had take some more profits.... I've hit this stock huge up and down! will have stay on the sidelines until I get the feeling......hope you made a bundle.."
We are new to this! We have wayfair! Not sure if I should sell now or wait for it to come back up?
Yesterday was Tesla and Zm. Today is W and Carvana.
TOM! Just shorted TTD at $283....
"Forget the tariff news; that’s just the trigger that might send the market down, but not what will ultimately make it spiral. There’s a corporate debt crisis — $9t today, compared to just $4t in 08— that is looming in plain sight, only few people choose to see it. You have companies with hugely inflated valuations, and whose valuations are what they are because of all-time highs in stock buybacks (thus racking up more debt, just at a lower interest rate). The yield curve is inverted, one of the best signs of a recession — the bond market signals a recession before the stock market does — yet people keep buying.I parked my money in cash back in October of last year. Yes, I’ve missed the nice run at the start of the year, and will probably miss another towards the end of the year or early next year. But there are signs EVERYWHERE that this bull market, while probably not at its end, is going to see one soon, and it’s likely to be a big dive when it does.I’m short W and many others right now. These companies, specially in recessions and corrections, will do what the old saying says: “Take the stairs up, and the elevator down.” It will be a hard, fast fall. Good luck to the longs. I play that game as well, and know the patience needed for it, and wish no one any ill-will who is long in this stock. As a pointer, beware a fall and hold below $140. There’s not a ton of support below that, recession or not."
"Amazon puked 8% after hours, with poor guidance for holidays.. See W under 100 before ER."
Why is this going up lmao
Sold a bunch of 190 Calls for 1.60 already worth 0.30 solid
WAYFAIR LONGS WIX AND PGNY PTON WTRH GERN ALL GOING NUTS! BUY THEM
Bankruptcy and furniture goes hand and hand. Furniture shops have historically been known to go bk.
Does anyone believe that 28% jump in price is justified? Really? This company has a bunch of fake news and manipulated financials. Wait for the Feds to jump in. It will drop $100 in one day.
Up 1500% since March and not once has it pulled back for profit taking... hmmm seems a little fishy to me.
Hope long sold at the top this morning .
long volume drying up --very few long buyers
someone have a pin because this is way to inflated
Well that didn't work ......under water today.
Na Na Na say goodbye
"If you look at ""furniture"" on Google Trends, it's basically a horizontal line from 2004-present -- zero growth. This stock has more than tripled in less than 1mon. It is simply WAYYY short-term overbought. The fake virus sales boost is only temporary -- Wayfair's negative credit outlook isn't."

"The post below that noted Soros got me thinking what do savvy investors do?The case against Wayfair:Thesis: When a company goes bankrupt and there is still value in the company stakeholders get paid from that money in about the following order:Tax collectorVendorsBond holdersEquity (i.e. shareholders since they are last)When a company is bankrupt it is probably obvious the shareholders are wiped out (otherwise it wouldn't file for bankruptcy). (Wayfair has currently more debt than assets so negative equity).Howard Marks is an investor famous for his distressed debt investing (i.e. companies on the edge of bankruptcy in which case he want to hold the bonds to become the owner)(in the 13F docs PRN means bonds, notes etc while SH means shares)Soros: Soros had shares in the past but got out in 2017 he currently holds bonds Proof 13F filing:(primary doc contains his fund name, info table the records of his holdings) https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1029160/000156761920010474 Howard Marks (Oaktree Capital): Has bonds Proof 13F filing:(primary doc contains his fund name, info table the records of his holdings) https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/949509/000094950920000003 As you can see savvy investors have moved up in the capital structure (where they get less return but will own the company if it goes bankrupt)."
"Amazing how this stock now acts like a defensive staples company. They sell highly discretionary goods. Don't be fooled, they saw a benefit during the quarantine, when people were still feeling good about their economic situation and finally had time to take care of those household projects that have been on their to do list. That surge will die down as the employment picture stays bad for a long period of time, in line with what the Fed just said. W will be back below $100 by year end."
Get ready for NO earning... This might spike up before the announcement.WS's favorite ... Will try to push to $140. It will be an interesting week

Let's hope we see volume finally pick up, I am expecting one last pump and looking for short opportunities, as believe the convertables will be coming to market and some selling to begin...Maybe a doji candle, to end the day negative, even better a 5% down day would give a nice reversal pattern on the weekly chart."
Art Van liquidated all stores. Leons liquidating 67 stores and laying off 3500. Furniture really not selling right now. People are more interested in hoarding toilet paper and frozen pizzas.
If you want a growth stock just hold. AMZN could buy them.The reason is AMZN is having cash and they do not have this segment.Do not listen to anyone just go to their web site and researchYou cannot miss a growth stock like this

"That down turn was just for me... thank you again. So where are all the freakin experts that said I couldn’t read a chart ?? I still say if the market continues lower it will drop to $95 - $100. But is see other good opportunities. Good by to all, will be back if it goes higher to short it again."

Buckingham research put a buy rating on this stock... This is coming from a small 20 employee company who's losing money every quarter .. Probably should stick will real guidance from an actual corporation such as Morgan Stanley . This stock will be around 60 by next week
"This is the best stock ever. Doesn't go down, even when the market is puking. Rips, when the market is barely up. Riskless...."
Todaymy coach came in from Wayview and it was perfect. The contractors who dropped off the coach told me they only deliver for wayfair and they have been so busy working till 9:00 pm at work the whole week. I sold a lot of the stock a few days ago but will let the rest ride. This could go back to 100
Oversold shorties. 2000 stimulus is a lot of money people can spend on home furnishings. Find something better to short
"question is when is it ripe for a mf short? RSI is huge, but it' still climbing.. hmmm."
"It's going higher, as COVID is back. Look at ZM, this is going to run."
This stock refuse to go down till last week and so exit my short calls (In money) and not roll. Now it gone $21 down. Unfortunately my broker don't allow to short so I have to rely on short call and so I didn't see risk/benefit favorable on friday but to be honest I would make $4000 (cover my $2K loss + $2K profit) instead $15K if I was actually short (Which was not possible)
When you have $Twtr ban $W wayfairgate and now Qanon... you know it is real. if not why wouldnt they just continue their normal backend suppression.

Nasdaq almost down 2% this still positive lol
There will be lots of money to be made on the way down. A lot.
With stores opening up no one wants to buy expensive furniture online. They will go back to traditional way. This stock will drift back below 100 over next few months
Will this ever go back to 120?
How can you not buy the dip this morning? WHAT A GIFT!! its on sale again!
It’s obviously disgusting isn’t it! the stock dumps today and 4 analyst in one morning/ afternoon jump on right away trying to pump up the stock back up - now you can actually see the manipulation and how bad it is - crooks all of them
Better than TSLA as I said. Be in my side. You make profits. Squeeze just started
Earnings next week. Deep state / globalists in control here. Beware long or short. We don't know their plan

I wish I bought 1000 shares in $20s. This is a huge V shape recovery.
Why going down when similar retailers are going up?
"where did all the CULT BUYERS GO, where are you Ladies ,, lol."
Did I say SELL? I think I did!
Same mm playing SHOP and W. You can overlay their 10 day charts and get a pretty good match. Lows nearly the same day and time.

Everything was priced in to this. Even with the great earnings it is way overbought and this will be a sell the news event. Going down quick shortly
sam I am right there with you. How much does it cost to deliver a couch then go back and get it when customer does not like it. Their model is built on spending 500 million a year in advertisement. It is not an amzn that will ever be able to stop advertising. they will never make any money in my opinion. Just do not know when it will finally fall lol
"Erratic pricing, not a good sign."
Better call in another BRINKS TRUCK!!....this one is getting full again!!...bears just feeding my account as fast as they can!....THANKS!...

As of May 15th per market watch 15.35 million shares are short or around 25% of the float which are shows available to the public!What fidelity is doing is they are calling in margin and changing the equity reserve ratios for W whenever they want to sell the stock after they do their short sale washout run-up it happened to me twice. I was up over 40,000 on the trade and the next day I got a margin call went it moved against me by only 20,000 on 2500 shares short apparently it was sooo risky they changes the margin reserves. Not only are they doing this they of course keep records of all of their users trading data. The reason commissions are free as that data is being used by algos and internal traders to make moves. Perhaps all of the brokers are selling the trading data for the algos databases. The low float combined with these shenanigans allows them to do the following:Dow futures are up. The shorts cover at the open usually having been beaten by a several day run-up in the stock. Then they Fidelity et all sell a truck load of stock from 9:00am CST – around noonish. Which I believe is them trying to reduce their exposure here in the longer-term, Then they stop and let the rookies come and bid it up and then they come back late in the day and either sell a little more or bid the stock up so it closes between -5 - + 2. They then sell into the poor suckers like me that they force to cover shares from the margin call to help ease the pain from the prior run-up. Rinse wash and repeat. This can go on indefinitely. God knows they have the pockets for it. For me I covered my shares at the close. They are never going to just let this drop to like 130 or 150 like it should. They want the shorts in here so they can keep this racket going. Yes, it is definitely shadey as hell! Just short this pig every time they push past 180. It will drop eventually much further!"
"OSTK sales were up 100% in April. But the stock was up 20% and lost all the gains. That should de-risk Wayfair. Except the market is very dumb and stocks can just go anywhere. If 100% sales increase couldn't maintain OSTKs pop, then why would Wayfairs sales report pop it?"
It will go to low double digits by next Friday on sooner. The squeeze is over and the big boys are dumping.
So people will keep buying furniture and decor with 15 pct unemployment?
Volume totally dried up in this name. Once UI benefits get cut this thing will tumble.
"anyone seen my pool boys, Wade and Joel?? they are late for work....I have weeds that need pulling ......"
Wall Street will walk this down as W will be looking for more money to fund their execs lifestyle.
Too many better companies to buy at bargain prices. Who wants to take a chance on a company that can not show a profit? This will get worse. I bought more puts earlier. Still have not made much even though it is down $4 more than when I bought because of the volatility. It will come.
Appears to be following Zoom positive news. Expect this volatility until reality finally kicks in and the Fed steroids run out of juice.
now the big boys start to dump their shares! this thing is so manipulated
Tomorrow is gonna be a rough day for the market. Trade away.
"Wayfair downgraded and the stock is up 10%. Talk about the short squeeze of a lifetime. This is a flash in the pan for this company. I haven't heard much good from people who have used Wayfair. Their experience was less than good, yet because they are in e-commerce, the stock runs like crazy. This is EXACTLY what occurred during the internet bubble, and subsequent crash 20 years ago. It's happening again right in front of your eyes today."
"I wonder if W has any of their merchandise made in China? Could be a rough day, week, month and rest of 2018. I can wait."
"great time to sell if u know what’s good 4 u... bounced off support today, consolidation pennant is coming to an end, analysts making desperate and false upgrades by $100s of dollars, history of short squeezes for this stock in almost identical set ups. GET OUT"
is this bubblishous stock ready for a pull back? What trigger will it take ? I don't understand how they stay in business. selling products at a loss just doesn't seem a good model
The short squeeze is nearing an end and this thing is in for an absurd crash ... I'm going to be shocked if this is above 80 within a few months.
I have such a deep regret selling my 450 shares at 133 pre earnings. Such a great stock to own.
How in the world does this stock go up today? Just crazy. Literally every stock is down.
Looking at another possible short squeeze attempt! If not that the stock might pull back!
Lol Shorted at $368! This will crash hard !
Someone once wrote on this W board “this may be the greatest short of all time”
"GUESS WHAT, WHEN I COME BACK NEXT WEEK, THIS WILL BE AROUND 100"
Today’s Page Wall Street Journal article says it well.... the model just doesn’t work. Everyone has lost credibility in Shah’s model. Even before supply chain (coronavirus) or required charging of sales-tax (“Wayfair” Court decision). Math shows that they must increase margin by 17% to he profitable.... and the most they could cut ADV would be by about 7% of sales.... will be fin to watch.
this will finish around 130 at most!
Bagholders lining up for this dookie.
My charts say zero in two years! Resistance at $5.00
The no-volume low-float stock scam continues. Wayfair is worth less than zero on paper.What is the brand name worth to a prospective buyer?Is Wayfair synonymous with cheap Chinese junk that nobody needs?Is Wayfair synonymous with poor delivery and massive returns?Is Wayfair synonymous with lousy customer service and very poor reviews?
Can't find a reason for this to be over $40???
"We'll get a lot of covering in the last little bit and many people will have to take care of those short margin calls soon. This has nowhere higher it can go, unless it gets a big upgrade soon, or a jump in the market drags it higher."
going to 250 easy. cant short it no shares avail
"I order few things from Wayfair past few weeks. One delivery was late so I called them....they representative was apologizing to me saying that they have seen over 40% increase in volume of deliveries from end of February and its continuing with every week getting worse. He was saying they are hiring more fulfillment people and warehouse staff....overwhelmed. Imagine how that will translate in revenue in Q2 and beyond. 40%!!! I was like thank you!! don't worry about the delay! lolAnother way you can see that they are prospering from this virus is many of their items on the website has been marked ""outofStock"". Wayfair might be hitting EBITA positive next 2 Qs at this rate! Because of this Virus you will see most retail outlets for furniture close in next 6 months because this will change the shopping habit of all people by the time a vaccine is out and distributed which is about a year!"
This stock is a day traders dream. Literally have longed and shorted this stock several times over the last few days...
Now the insider board will stuff themselves like hogs to the trough with 3 billion dollars before things get busted open
It looks like hospitals are buying Wayfair furniture smh
"Fantastic news - no share dilution. Will end up by close. $96, wait and see."
Change my mind not buying puts till the insanity buying stops.
Great opportunity!!! Best 90 dollar stock ever!!!!
"Another fund sold W, but nobody cares. Complete joke.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gmo-llc-trims-cognizant-wayfair-152820009.html"
Friday $153...enjoy the ride and next week back to $120....thanks Niraj
"Hello R, What is your guess on W's share price in the next three months ? Thanks and Happy Thanksgiving ."
"W is RED, what is going on?"
I hope the CEO has the names of those walked out...... first downturn.....and they would be gone!..... if not before...don't need people like that in any company!
Have a feeling these earnings on Wednesday will fall short
People seeking safety of W' massive FCF in this market...
Westin Yes the sales increase quarter after Quarter! The problem with the valuation is the company loses 1 billion a year! Many reasons! The stock is worthless but you must trade on the trends despite any negatives! This stock is designed to get small shorts hooked!
"Wayfair stock was $25 in March. Jim Cramer: no mention of Wayfair then all he was talking about was the virus. Today Wayfiar is $187, Jim Cramer is screaming you should buy it. Sell low, buy high?"
Starting to cover now....
How is this legal?
wayfair has to report a profit on this earnings report to prove they’re worthy
Good analysis here https://youth-investment-group.com/2020/05/05/wayfair-is-surging-like-a-rocket-positive-earnings-could-launch-w-into-the-stratosphere/
$81.49 is the lowest close since Dec 24 last year.. Chart says it is going lower...
W shoots up out of orbit even though the loss is more than last year. I still hold the shorts position because I believe that W will go to BK court eventually.
WOW... I am surprise that it dropped this much. Anyway... I am glad.They might fight for $125 by end of day.
nice time to take profits and run
Below $110 is possible after earning
W is down 4.97% to $126.30

"Low margin Wayfair (W) is the next retailer that will file for bankruptcy because of its continued losses, continued cash burn and its debt overhang that hit $700 million in Q1 2020.Actually, Wayfair's leverage is NOT even positive.Wayfair's leverage is NEGATIVE because its Net Debt-to-2020 adj. EBITDA ratio is negative. (edited)"
During times of recession what do people do first? correct. they remodel their homes with Chinese furniture. here you have a recession resilient stock. buy now our forever be forgotten.
W is down -4.94% to 142.52
$90 down from the ATH and $230 to go before fair market value for W stock.
"as long as $143 doesn't break, all is well for longs......... and it wont! $143 has been the battle ground, and support there has held 3 or 4 times. warren buffet moves in at $143."
Is Amazon competing as normal now? What revenue increase will they maintain come month of June? That is the key to whether it falls back to 100 or holds 190
$80 soon. Money losing enterprise.
"It looks like it is setting up for another big player to drop it back below 81.81, but a neutral 82.50 close... nothing to see here all day, moving on."
would be sweet if this hit $130 by end of week
just added 200 more @241.41.........hope you are rite..................
"buy overstock, new target raised to 140, lot more upside than W"
Not far from its iPo six years ago if that tells Kong’s anything. Will probably rocket tomorrow by the way futures are acting
heavy volume run up into earnings.....told you it would do that 2 weeks ago....its been green every day since....another easy and profitable call...
you might have a problem if you post as an operating loss that is 10% of revenue.
finally some sanity selling
re shorted at $287.45 will cover at 248. growth slowing margins shrinking. europe loosing money
Over valued!!
Wow ... this thing is breaking down FAST. Look like $100 in two weeks.
Any thoughts why insiders sold shares at 132 and 124? They know the situation better than everyone.Tomorrow they come with the results. This will fall as a knife. The expectations are too high at this price.
W reached a new All Time High at 130.38
"As Jim Cramer always says; ""Nobody lost money by taking some money off the table"" . Just sell 30% and enjoy your profit before someone else does and you are the one holding the empty bag."
Up almost $4 on 63K shares traded? Farce wrapped in fish paper.
W is a worthless joke...it will crash...all the pumped junk eventually does...lol
"from $20-$178 in 2 months, congratulations longs"
I sold at 168. This is crazy. I think this is a total short squeeze. Float was too small.
More of that programmed buying. Just look at the slope on the one day chart. A steady slope all morning long so far. Definitely not natural trading.
how high today
People dumping shares and money market funds to the safety we Wayfaireans know so well...
"funny, in the premarket it was up more than $9....trying to make the shorts panic......i was going to add more shorts if it goes up. this ain't no biotech or tech company. if you're short here, eventually you'll be on the right side."
Spruce house partnership is represented on board for way. They purchased 1.25 million shares between 2/21-3/9. They sold 1 million shares on 3/19 at wait for it....................$23.32 What do they know? Surely they did not just need cash and if they did why sell way. They are big holders of many companies. This pig is toast but bullfight said insiders are buying lol. Not they are dumping. Three other board members sold shares as soon as they were awarded to them
"I love this group MYMP...Great lyrics that apply to us Wayfaireans…""And we can build this dream together, standing strong forever, nothing's gonna stop us now""!!! Everything red.. .We're green!!!"
Stick a fork in it.
"YES, TOM...... the SAMMY curse lives and NO company can defeat it !...... The SEC has even asked me not to use it..... I could take down AMZN if I wanted..... W was at $160 or there about when I put it on them.... Millennials staking did it!..."
Benzinga and GMO LLC offered some sane valuations for W today.I wish MW would look at this.
this pattern always happens. So strange the rocket up at 2pm
"Amazing ! $132 and no plans to make money! Low volume stocks are easily manipulated by a few hedge funds.....when they decide to take profits, this will tank hard. Valuation is ridiculous at this level."
W is looking weak. The big rise yesterday may have been an exhaustion spike. In today's strong market it shouldn't be down 4%
"With all their growth and the previous impressive ER report, I'm wondering why this has been drifting down the past couple of weeks."
"W sold of on heavy volume ,so this could be the beginning of the end for W , rest of week will tell ."
"Very overvalued, poor quality products ,Lots of returns"
"yawn...... what a great day!! like I said, I wake up every morning and wonder how much ill make today!! W up another $9...TTD just rocking!! life is good!! you'd be shocked if I told how much I made today........ more than most of you make in a year..."
Nothing goes straight up from $120 to $171 and stays...learn something if you are in stock market...See you at $153 and if that does not hold then $120 back....tick tock...
"I don't care what W bulls say, this valuation is completely insane. There is simply no justification for it. None."
CFO sold 3k shares yesterday
Thanks for your insight on this safety stock Sam. Looks like my put spread will be a four bagger bwwwaaaaa. Safety stock. Buffet type company
They are running  out of money  trying to keep this Wayfair stock up. Lol Soon it will come crashing down especially in this Market. W is an excellent short position!!
Glad I have shorts and not puts
"Take a closer look they own many many websites. Online 2019 sales over 9 billion with a 16 billion market cap, it should be a 90 billion market cap. Very under valued stock."
sam must be out buying the dips again today. Analysts liked their story of keeping overhead down by all online. Now they want brick and mortars before ever showing a profit. This this will tank to 90 in three months.
One born every minute
Amazing amount of W dribble coming out of the media today.
"Always climbs on low volume...same pattern ever day. I still say it's shorts choking. Most shorts can't hang on when a stock runs like this. Most are short term gamblers. No way this a $10 billion company. ...the markets can stay irrational longer than you have money, I guess. --- warren buffet ...."
@ Playmakers are you still holding your short position ?
Those buying above 310 are going to lose so muchu money tomorrow.
"Wow, and I thought $SHOP was out of hand. This move is hard to fathom. $22 just over a month ago and $180 today. In all my years of trading, I have never seen a move like this. Unbelievable. Who the heck was selling in the $20s and who the heck is buying up here."
https://www.investors.com/news/technology/wayfair-earnings-wayfair-stock-q2-outlook/
"Buy, buy & buy"
"Joel, you guaranteed it would close red!??? you were wrong big time!! IM SHOCKED!! lmao... don't quit your day job."
"So Wayfair is planning to import cheap furniture from Asia and then sell it right back to them...at a profit?Some business model. Meanwhile, the top brass at Wayfair continue to sell every share gifted to them every single month.Wayfair is going bankrupt. They are just another over-leveraged ""hyper-growth at all costs"" shell company. Wayfair is the Krazy Eddie of home furnishings."
Interest rates rising are not good for the stock market or heavily in debt companies like W. If shorting was not allowed W would be $40 per share but the shorts can't get out of their own way.
Insiders dumping shares the entire time... hmmm I wonder why. Way overpriced and they know it’s not sustainable. Secondary offering coming this afternoon?
"HOME At Home Group Earnings Preview (22.99 +3.88)Home decor store At Home Group (HOME) after the market closes with a call scheduled at 4:30 ET.Current Cap IQ Consensus estimates Q2 adj.

"Sam, hope you are making lot of money today. I am following you to short W at 62.24."
"What a great defensive stock!! We're obviously in the early stages of this run!! You can't stop it.....bears?...andrew left, Jimmy joe right...all getting schooled...join the best money making stock in the decade!!!"
$145 support is broken and sliding down !
so the people who bought friday are getting killed today--makes no sense
Does anyone know what Wayfair's plan is to raise cash?
"At current free cash flow negative burn rate, W will have to do a secondary offering before year end. Don't see how they become profitable when you can already locate the furniture W sells at other retailers for less $$$."
Fellow longs / True Wall Street Hedge Funders: I'm taking my teal-colored Wayfair hydrofoil couch to The 'Tucket next week for the conference...Leaving from Greenwich...Let me know if you'd like a life...
Dead cat bounces ?
stay away from W==a highly overvalued trash stock!Target $150
"W is toast. Slowing growth, crushing, crushing debt, negative equity, dwindling cash. Doesn't bode well. Wayfair is just another in a long line of debt fueled resellers."
$250 by Wed
"every time this drops the doomsdayers come out. Every pop, benjo and hornet appear. Look, this company will still do well Q4 with 100k new cases a day and people did adopt more online shopping. But, the Wayfair revenue, earnings, $ per customer are going back to earth as seen last quarter report, and long term trend is not promising for company. It has no way to pay for shipping when the volume normalizes. Huge debt. It has no alternate business like AWS to even offset the shipping losses. It can only push Chinese suppliers to lower prices. Bottom line this will return to stagnant company with low growth and flat to negative earnings."
"yall, know this company is growing at 100% YoY...with 10 billion in revenue.... while also cancelling their largest sales promo of the year...that kind of growth at this size is unheard of.on top of that, they cleaned house at the leadership level to focus on profit. last quarter they stated at this point going forward all sales are margin accretive...this means the Net Operating Loss will shrink.i.e. Growth is through the roof and we are seeing positive direction for cash flow and operating income."
So this was roughly $85/share before corona virus and 40 million people were outta work....and now it?s more than double that price on #$%$ earnings that doesn?t even show just how hard of a hit they?re rally going to take??? Gtfo
Should be under $100 soon. Benjo is selling calls as he pumps.
Short on at $174.55......This will be in the 130s in a few weeks
"this is absolutely the SHORT OF THE CENTURY,, WILL MAKE MILLIONAIRES EASY!! don't miss the Boat!!!!!!"
"I love a stock that doesn't go down !! At least not for long.... tariffs mean nothing to wayfair! Recession mean nothing!! ..... I'm thinking dougie is infatuated with me.......keeps following me around... strange lil guy, for sure...."
Corrupt business models supported by analyst/creditors on a pay-to-play mechanismdeserve to be exposed and slaughtered in the marketplace!
Does Wayfair use operating leases or finance leases?
"so here's how I think this is working Wayfair issue a new share buyback program 2 weeks ago.... they don't want to buy shares at the highest prices. so company officer sell at the all time highs, then they get bank of America to downgrade the stock so they can buy shares at much lower prices!!! i do think wayfair can drop alot more but thats why there's up and down"
quad witching day short now
tick tock to $153 in five days...enjoy the ride....
"I don’t invest, and I know that company values don’t really do much for stock price and shareholders, but this company’s customer service and deceptive tactics are going to cause its customer base to drop through the floor. If they supposedly need to rely on repeat business, they’re going to be losing a lot fast. The word is out on this scam company."
"FANGs stocks support market, W will rally soon! Buy any dip!"
"Shameless pumping zacks:Wayfair W has skyrocketed during the coronavirus economy, with W shares up a mind blowing 650% since March 20 to crush fellow stay-at-home star Zoom’s ZM 85%. And investors might want to consider buying the e-commerce giant as a longer-term play because its growth, outlook, and other fundamentals remain strong."
Anyone still shorting at this price?
Short at the close thx
"I see Wayfair invented the cure for Coronavirus. That's great. Last time I ordered something from them, I literally got a broken shelving unit with half the parts in the box. I think pharmaceuticals was a good pivot.Right? That's what happened, right? Otherwise, they're still losing a dollar on every sale and making it up on volume."
More revenue means bigger loses! Lol
"looks like Great hill stopped manipulating it higher-they forced it to 105,now they SELL."
wayfair comes ROARING BACK....just like I said it would........ahhhhhhhhh....making money again!
"Stock trader is a rube..... he doesn't have a clue what he's doing. He doesn't understand the concept of LOW FLOAT stocks and how they trade...... he thinks all stocks should trade on valuation metrics, and most don't. This stock, BYND, TTD and a few others all trade at extreme valuations because they are extremely low float stocks, and demand is high due to their growth..... W is overvalued for sure, but that doesn't mean it will correct any time soon....."
"Super low margin business, loses $1 b a year, major competition with reopenings, highly dependent on good economy for customer demand...def recession proof..."
80 tomorrow!!
How is every short doing. Target is 416 on this with no resistance until 367.
Yea no matter how much the government does it does not fix the problem. People are not broke right now. They have them scared and not wanting to get out and spend money.
"Hmm. is this the market maker starting to slowly walk back the stock to $235? If so, the stock will see 3 or 4 more consecutive down days"
"LOLOLOL!! All these burned shorts talking garbage here is so amusing. Dear idiots.....Wayfair Q1 numbers where mainly positive beat was because of the fundamental changes they made to the company...there was not mus of the Virus flight to online retail calculated in there because we are talking about two weeks of the pandemic in the Q, BUT NOW...boy o boy o boy....a whole Q of people sitting there shopping on Wayfair spending uncle sam's dollars and working from home doing some sprucing up while there! More and more those who can work from home are making their home into a second office as this will be the trend for most corporates and their employees going forward. Next few Qs you will see more big corporation cutting down on office leases and making a big portion of their workforce stay at home. This will only increase need for wayfair products and THATS WHY the price is driven this high and will go into $400-600 by next year! Wayfair adding millions of new customers every Q and that trend will increase and it trending up its existing reorder of its customer.....This is leading to shortening the path to bottom line profitability to most likely this from 2022. Its taking the Amazon path...and we remember how you shorties were all saying the same s hit about that company. Care holing your shorts in July boys and girls.....you will see $250 after next Q"
Sinking like hindenberg
Lots of selling in this one to raise cash and take profits
when was the last time you saw a downgrade of W?? hard to remember isn't it??..nobody would dare downgrade it now....they'd be the laughing stock of Wall Street..... going to go to $250 for sure..
"Stimulus soon? sounds like short covering..... my friend work for a company who supplys W. they are still busy but not as much. however, they have sudden increase in home office division. they still lost 80% year over year and short covering coming soon.... Stimulus? buy buy buy baby"
They just hit the ask on the puts guys.
Did a note holder just convert 3.5 million shares
"New pt's today, 168 (highest so far), and 150. This can still pop higher, especially since many think it is too high already, and more greed will likely set in. Although, I'd like it to settle down around 135."
it's funny to see the dip buyers are the low volume robinhooders pushing it back up. deal of a lifetime right?
So many shorties crying today. Learn how to read a chart. It’s in the gap back to 300
i believe this pig will go down every day until earnings. lol Who really wants to own this going into earnings. They can not be good and will probably be worse than expected.
"W-Way over bought, just like RH"
I wonder how many stop losses are sitting at 149.5. Trap door to next level
Whopping 26% short interest as of 7/15... Hope shorts are right at least once in 6 months...
"If you’re basing your trading decisions off Reddit rumours, I don’t know what to tell you honestly"
Way fair should buy @home.
How can this only be down 1.3% in pre-market trading?
woo-hoo!
Another disastrous quarter for Wayfair. This company does not have a viable business and will soon be at the mercy of creditors. Piling up losses and relying on trade credit and bond buyers with no path to profits... https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wayfair-announces-fourth-quarter-full-120000995.html
this is like tilray and beyond meat bubbles. theres nothing to sustain these valuations.
I've been long for quite some time but this short term move will surely settle back a bit. Probably in the $140's
is this about to go down because the sex trafficking thing i think so
what is happening market is down and this is up 5%... I shorted 282 now little worry... any news going on?
why would any company purchase W? It's losing $500 mil per year and has a market cap near $9 bil
"3 million shares traded today, 500k from short covering = “real” volume at 2.5 million, consistent for the last 5 days of low sales volume. Show me these kind of gains with 4 million+ shares and then I’ll change my mind. Otherwise, W is still on course to continue to trend down"
"That's an impressive drop! A chance to buy back my 305 calls, I wrote. Or not."
W is among the worst stocks with the poor fundamentals.sell!
manipulation
Might see a major gap down in the am if they dont let it drop now. The markets are picking up steam and the volume is finally hitting. Markets have not priced in any fear of what China might do.
"This stock moves like a rollercoaster. No way it is +9%, barely untouched in past week turmoil"
I would consider covering around the 200dma. Around $100.
check out nmhly as well. should be on the rise!
Think we're looking at a short squeeze here - taking this accounts advice - lot of good info https://twitter.com/Clifton_Capital/status/1257304551901847552
This is a short squeeze- period. Doubt anyone is chasing it like this.
If business was that good why stock there was sell off to below $30 and what changed that went up 4 times???? Please help me
"I love Wayfair and mostly believe the outlook of the leadership, but was easy to know that $160 was an overvalued price by anyone's estimate. Thankfully I actually did get a chance to sell many shares above $160. Now, at half of that, $80, if you still believe the bull case, is this a bargain price? I mean... if they make a small correction in a couple of quarters from now or even next quarter, and the numbers don't look as bad, suddenly this could become a darling of wall street again. Wayfair tends to do well in holiday revenue. Also, could just be a little smarter about arguable frivolous expenses, perhaps some hiring reductions, and come up with some savings. That was indicated in the conference call though... I fear that Wayfair will continue to spend wildly."
When do you think Raj will wind up the “on the take analysts to the rescue” next?
I own 12 stocks and every singl one is up over 14% or better. Either I am the greatest investor of all time or the market is just cruising on government stimulus free money. but I will take this huge upside and make the cash

If you have $8Bill of Rev and can't make money --- Are people smoking Hopium or what?
Hope you bought the little dip this morning!! Trades the same way every day!! Watch and learn....it's an easy call if you know what you're doing....
$130 tomorrow?
Possible we buy WeWork...They control 95% of the world's commercial property...Wayfair would furnish it all...
Benjo should double his shares to two at this price
If this stock doesn’t go down down down I will be lost for words....
"I believe tomorrow will be another down day for W...probably bigger drop than today. Low share volume continues to persist due to lack of interest. From a market perspective hitting new highs, the record amount of debt raised, record number of new shares offered, S&P trading high PEs....It’s also highly likely we’ll get a market sell off correction in the upcoming days....which would could trigger a massive sell-off for W IMO. It’s just a matter of time that the institutions need to sell off shares. Shorts be patient..."
Much cheaper than Wayfair and amazing growth...AT HOME (HOME) $19.00https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/home-group-home-earnings-expected-163004593.html
I don't see how this stock survives..EOD cover only got to 63...Probably huge discount Monday.
Hope this goes to 500 so I can short hand over fist
Interesting Cramer had a sell on this two days ago. He was a little stymied by Wayfair's irrational move up. Let's see what happens.
"a fund manipulator is controlling the stock and trying to shake out weak longs on margin, an old dirty trick.hold on."
W would be at around 200 before earning is released
Sub-$100 by August.
W and shop both going back to precovid price and thos had been overpriced!
"Amazon just announced they are going to prioritze in home products, not sure if thats staples and not furniture which is great or Wayfair and AT HOME"
"March 19th, $23. May 13th, $178. No bubble here folks. Nah, no bubble at all."
can we see it below $270 by tomorrow?
Wonder who would buy their debt. Do we have too much money in the system? A lot of scheme and corruption on Wall Street... Some day this all will come crashing down hard.
BBBY good news equals BAD news for W. It means they are taking business from them. Why is that concept so hard to comprehend for people????
"Makes no sense, going back up to record highs ?? Talk about a manipulated stock"
Total late day manipulation by shorty helped by low float...Should be up big
massive volume!!! clearly manipulation ...... Sec hasn't returned my call yet. should be anytime now...
Don’t be “that guy” that tries to dollar cost average this on its way down to $100.
BBBY has a 10th market cap and bigger better Revenue than W ????? Really !!!!????That sums it up = what pumped up scam !!!
@sam Hope you bought lot today . Could bounce back at the end of the day .
Someone is dumping big-time today. I feel bad for those who covered earlier today.
Hi I just want to know they are selling furniture or 24 Carret gold share price look like
"This is a lockdown stock. As things open up, wayfair will sell off. They were doing bad before the lockdown, and ok ya people bought some furniture because of the lockdown, but smart money knows it is a temporary thing. There will be lots of money to be made when this goes back down to 130."
Time to short this stock ? Any thoughts
Here we go...
No one wants to hold into the weekend for sure
Someone bought my shorts at 150 bhahahah
The amount of insider dumps in the last two months should bring you pause...
Will run to $100. Black Friday and Cyber Monday will see huge % increase on last year after the tax cuts.

Amazing how the powers that be are keeping W afloat. This defying logic. For now! A wake up call is coming sooner than later.

Yesterday in pre-market we were down .72 cents with a 100 share trade. Now we're up a buck today with a 100 share trade. Market makers sure having their way with W. They hope no insiders sell today and they can push it higher.
Lol. Winning!
"Attn: Recent College Graduates, Wayfair Investors, and Amazon HQ2 selection committee!!!Wayfair is going to need some more furniture.The Back Bay-based online retailer told the Boston Globe it has inked a deal for an addition 395,000 square feet of office space near Copley Plaza. The expansion, touted as one of the largest such deals in recent Boston history, will make room for an additional 4,000 employees and an untold number of geometric rugs and wicker baskets.Wayfair, which already employs more than 8,700 people globally, will move into the new offices at the intersection of Boylston and Berkley streets next year, according to the Globe. The company, founded in 2002, is growing at a rapid clip, and it notched $1.4 billion in direct retail net revenue in the first quarter of this year.And though nearly 400,000 square feet may seem like a palatial office addition, it’s just small potatoes in comparison to what the company may ultimately be aiming for. According the Globe, Wayfair plans to add up to 1 million square feet of office space in Boston over the next couple of years and hire are many as 10,000 more people."

Go to https://www.consumeraffairs.com/online/wayfair.html?#sort=top_reviews&filter=1and scroll down... you'll see that this company does not care 1 ioda about its customers. The analysts just want to make a quick buck off this stock. The analysts don't care about out all the packaging and waste this company creates. Wake up!
"Not sure why would you invest in this puppy if you can’t handle volatility. Its GROWTH driven business model, plain and simple. They are targeting 600 Billion Market and can’t happen without spending dough."
Keep going up back to $180 and then short again
there's a lot of weak money supporting this right now riding it up that will sell on a sneeze. easy come easy go
The rise before the fall.
I heard Bill Ackerman looking at W
Many better places to invest. Momentum play played out.
Every Friday we see an options-related run-up. Pretty predictable.

The markets are going to rip higher due to trade war negotiations will be set on Jan 7th.The large cap stocks are all up.Job report also should be good too.Gl guys.
"How much is Wayfair going to miss earnings estimates? + 50 to 80 cents per share is what the estimates are. Did W do that ?? I think they are going to have to fudge some numbers to get even close. This is priced to perfection, one hiccup and this goes under 200 for sure... maybe 150."

Wayfair got positive comments from a stock analysis company early Friday, but then that same company changed its rating a second time later in the day.Early on, Wayfair got positive comments from analysts at Stifel, including lifting the price target on the stock by $40 to $115 per share. Wayfair repeated its buy rating, noting that the impact of the coronavirus pandemic would force furniture shoppers online and potentially boost the e-commerce specialist's business.Yet after the stock's jump, Stifel came back and cut its rating on the stock from buy to hold. That might seem like a quick response, but given that the stock's $18 upward move took the price above $122 per share -- well above the $115 per share price target -- the downgrade based on valuation seemed justified.It's not every day that you see one analyst give two different views on a stock. Yet the calls were consistent with the way the stock behaved, and it shows that at least in some people's eyes, valuations still matter."
"I reviewed Wayfair's first quarter earnings. Although their sales increased, so did their losses. The more they sell, the more they lose. Look for yourself."
Closing green
What a stock!! Up $3.45 and still climbing.... another Green Day..lost count of how many in a row......heavy volume .... buyers everywhere ...shorts covering....nothing can stop it.
"I bought 175 puts this morning when it hit 175. Massive short covering the morning driving up volume, that and day traders getting in on the action. Once it peaked and trended down, we were back to anemic volume which is easier for algos to manipulate the sales in small sale blocks. It should have traded flat today if it weren’t for the short covering. We should have ended at $160 or below if it weren’t for the early short covering this morning. It will be down on Monday"
Little Dougie stinging from the humiliation I brought on him on the HCR board... I trade little dougie!! made it going up and then shorted!! its all posted here!! Little dougie owns 4500 shares of HCR at $8.... it's at $1.62 now ! I told him!!
"The bottom line is the company don't make any money, and their employees are on the side of the cartels and not law enforcement. I will never buy their stock or products."
"Put aside the conspiracy theory for a minute.They haven't turned a profit for 19 years. Yet the analysts consensus is that they'll have a huge q2 profit, in the middle of an unprecedented economic crisis?Someone please explain to me how!"
"Really good article on Seeking Alpha today that details some of the issues that Wayfair has right now.Go to their website and search for ""Wayfair: Market Is Not Buying Same Old Story"""
Nice bounce off the lows .... a good sign...
"massive volume on this selloff!! almost 40,000 shares already!!! everyone is running for the exits!"
As soon as news hits about tariffs this will drop 20-30%. China is going to retaliate.
240K in volume so far this morning. They haven’t started dumping yet.
This is hilarious.
"the rocket ship has taken off!! what a stock!! TOM, sorry about your short.... I tried to tell you........sigh... nothing can stop this!! amzn isn't even in the game anymore..... W owns the market!"
Just sold all my shares and bought master card. This stock is going below 100
Going into a down trend. Safety stock Sammy the rube of all rubes
This company will be bankrupt by the end of summer.
will beat earnings. as for dropping after earnings beat i dont think most posters are paying attention to how that works. overstock was up on 30 day chart prior to earnings. so was home. they dropped as correction. wayfair is heading up after earnings beat.
"Justin Post is another BS analyst who upgraded W to BUY. I think he has no spiral to upgrade W. This company never makes profit at all. It only shows the EBITDA but the negative GAAP earnings. One more thing, W keeps selling the stock to raise the capital which is the bad sign for the business. If the situation of the virus keeps going another quarter, I think W will have to raise more money again. Look at the percentage of the SHORTS, make me believe that W will go under within 2-3 years."
Look at a 1 month chart. Exactly 4 weeks ago to the day big gap up. What a scam. They are going to do a secondary offering.
I would not suggest buying at this point. This is a very shorted stock and the momentum is down. I say this is going to the 70's by tomorrow.
"Perhaps I can remind people that Wayfair's great earnings announcement, which sent the stock to new highs last week, was for the quarter ended 3/31/2020. Most of the kick higher in sales happened during quarantine in April 2020 (and continues now). We'll see increased sales and market share as a result of this, captured n 2nd quarter sales later. Glad the stock is hitting some speed bumps before heading much higher."

Now BYE BYE... had to put bullish in my other posts so they wouldn’t get deleted... if they’re innocent why’d they change the prices !!! LOLLLl
Going be up early until smart money starts trading. Then down again
Refer recent sale https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/W/insider-trades/
the only stock that does this. bigger bubble than bitcoin.
"$105-110 on earnings, if not lower."
Run.... $100 soon.
This where is levels off and then drops Like A rock
"In my city, there are 2 companies that have regular going out of business sale. It has been going on for over 2 years. Furniture businesses are terrible investments. Does anyone really believe W will hit $1000 per share like Amazon, Apple, Bookings, etc.? I would rather own Visa than W for sure."
Glad I sold at 165.00. W is not AMZN
"Wayfair adopted a new accounting standards update for debt effective January 1, 2021. If Wayfair had not adopted the standard January 1, 2021, Wayfair's diluted earnings (loss) per share would have been $(0.31) for the first quarter of 2021.Added 8M and 12M , basic and diluted shares to accounting quarter to quarterthen spent 90M more during quarter on Adsthen spent 60M more on customers/merchant Feesthen had 400M increase in long term debt resulting in 8% increase in Total Liabilities quarter to quarterThis lizard/elite enterprise is coming to an END, at last...................................<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>"
Look at OSTK - W will follow
Heard/read shipping delivery costs are really gonna move up a lot
Child trafficking is profitable it seems
Upgrades to sell before tank. Gotta love analysts and institutions that lining there pocket with your money. Good luck longs
$3.12 higher on 41K shares traded. Hilarious.
By the way its charts looking today is a good day to buy more dip for me.
who in their right mind would buy this stock at this price. Can't go up every day with out reset back down.
Rookie Mike. Do you want to hear some funny stuff. I just sold some puts for a buck a contract more than I paid for the. I bought them yesterday and W was up $6 today when I did it. I am sure you want to know how don't you lol
who keeps propping this up and 183? Life boat.
Massive short interest has got to start thinking about covering here this thing could go parabolic
Are the bots out at the beach?? Volume across the markets are way off.......
"Tom & Joel... hope you two have a ""productive""day"
lmao.....and GREEN IT IS!!! same pattern every day...dips at the open then moves up UP AND AWAY!!.... just like I told you it would!....yawn.....easy call.
"Question: I saw Wayfair issued 1 billion worth of convertible bonds at 148.50 in August 2019 when the stock was at 112 ... This seems to be the first day trading above that range since issuance, which would help shorts greatly... does anyone know how long it takes to convert or for other stocks what percentage of those bonds have been converted?"
"This Is fake all low float,short squeeze value - earnings will make the correction.Reminds me of Tiltay TRLY opens at $14, low float of 89mil- short squeeze to $300 earnings come now at $7- and W float is only 48mil- great numbers keep shorting make a fortune"
it is nice to get a billion a year to waste. how can this is even bigger than Macy's. Just doesn't make sense.
"The way it is going up, it is going to fall like a knife..be careful"
thoughts on earnings ?

W is day traders favorite
I mentioned to people here to sell your W trash and buy GILD - look what happened at the bell. If you can trade a/h you have a few hours left. Running out of time before this gets crushed when we go back to reality.
Do you think it'll hit 300 today?
@Sam wonder if you add any more shares today
Almost $40 in 1 hr???? Yeah right=pure manipulation prop up
Don’t open a position in W until you hear what (http://Rightpicker.com) has to say about it. These guys give amazing insights like no other service.
AMZN will eventually swallow whole W's business. It's only a matter of time. W is a mere bug relative to Amazon's power/size.
"The convertable won't actually convert and become shares for a while, if/when. So speculators are just ignoring the future share dilution. To them its all just a low interest bond offering. It might be 2025 before shares are issued. Till then its a bond. This stock is so overpriced. I sold my position at 299. today. And bought to cover this weeks 317.50 call options I sold. Bought the options back at 2.38, not they are trading at 12. Its crazy"
Crystal ball Sammy when are going into the next recession? Learn me something. Say we go into a recession... what do you think wayfair would do if we had a recession? Saying its going to have 1-3 dollars swing is a easy call boss. Stocks don’t move in straight lines. Clearly shorts are keeping this going. Looking at the volume let’s not pretend like buyers are tripping over eachother
If the Dow tests the lows! This stock might me in Benjo Territory 300’s
"As I wrote months ago (when W was at $145./share)... I was in the furniture business for over 20 years; with their biz model, Wayfair will never be profitable... the stock is going to $50.00."
Can’t imagine the returns for these cheap items. People had to buy online due to fact stores were closed. Stores are open!!!Many people including myself prefer to pick out furniture at store. Only way to judge quality
Has any one in this board ever bought anything from wayfair that the real question?
"So R, your saying management can dilute 12 million sharesfor $100 below value, pocket $3 billion and manipulated up the confidence and price with on the take analysts - sounds fair"
Great company they except it to lose (-$2.07 ) next quarter. Lol 
"Deep state in control here. Rothschild, Fed bank in Boston, etc...Be wary"
"on its way down, buy otsk and if you don't just mark the share price today and look back at it 6 months from now also buy puts on W this is where you can make your money now"
They are using a huge network of warehouses that normally supply brick and mortar stores to ship a ton of product while the brick and mortar store are closed. W is going to have a record quarter. They are acquiring a ton of new customers as well. The stock is definitely heading much higher. If I was short I would get out now before it becomes a short sellers blood bath.
"lmao..... up up and away!!! same thing every day! tom, I hope you're well..... its never too late to accept your losses and start again..."
"Even if Wayfair miraculously earns $2 (the highest any pumper even hints at) in Q2, and manages somehow to duplicate that for the rest of the year, at $8 that is still a PE of more than 30 at these levels. Simply astounding. Sure feels like a massive pump and dump for a company that never made money before."
I do think there will be another attempt at a short squeeze
It's 10:07 am and wayfair is down $2.56. Watch it close green today. Low volume ....low float gives us manipulation.
Watch out longs latest selling
"No volume, no short squeeze, hardly any buyers over 160. Might take longer than I thought to drop down. 150 Friday looking unlikely now but I'm giving this 3-4 weeks to head back to 100-120"
"Wayfair is one of the few undervalued stocks in the market! I'm a value investor , that's why I bought wayfair. It's terribly undervalued by all metrics. I'm surprised they don't take it private."
"Serious responses only: If Buffett offered $80,000 / share would you guys tender? Below my fair value $10 Trillion but could be compelling....Maybe a stock deal where we'd own 99.9% of combined entity (BRK-B)?"
"Wayfair is having another sale, but this time its the insiders lining up to dump their shares. CEO Niraj Shah and co-founder Steve Conine each sell $1.5 million of stock on Dec 3rd."
only lost 100 million ???? wow
"Only down 4.5%? Started out as skimming, then full dilution. Are put options still expensive? They've managed the price and closed off the means to reduce risk. Just hope a bigger fol shows up."
W is down 4.92% to $136.58
Why don’t you guys report them to the SEC instead of complaining on a yahoo finance sub?
There was no way in hell this company is still worth $280 a share... maybe $100 a share
"David has to leave the board.... Wade was jealous, I guess. spending too much time here."
Charts are still for 416 with resistance at 367.
buy at the close or ah for tomorrow's run up.
W is down -5.45% to 119.11
"News from potus, ""dont worry about a covid-19 vaccine, it will go away at some point"" Really??Where is Dr. Fauci and his team?? $tsla$spy"
Heavy insider selling. Not good. They always know when to get out.
short squeeze. nothing more...it won't last....low float allows this.
W reports first week of May. Anyone seriously think they are going to show a profit?
This cant be short squeeze ...
"Wayfair was not doing well even in a stable economy, so now people are supposed to be buying furniture hand over first?"
Sooner or later.. it just takes one major player to report on it
Never ever see $1 differences in bid and ask! Buy buy buy
is it good to be all time with no news?
"The more revenue they make, the larger the losses. This is an 18 year old company that has never made a penny and has lost more money each and every year. Get out before it hits 0. -1,1B in equity, no liquidation value."
Verrrry Bearish if this trades red on a day like today.
8% rule gotta sell see ya!!
I remember the internet boom and bust back in '99/2000. It was very similar to what's going on now with these Wayfair type stocks. Losing money like crazy yet they went up. That is until they didn't go up and CRASH. Will that happen now? Yes. It's that simple. Don't be the last one to the party.
"Yawn..... futures down huge!! Wonder how high w will go today? Bynd is up, also."
"Down over 5% premarket, stock is a short above $75"
a billion loss in 2019!!! maybe be 2 in 2020
"Wayfair is way over value , bulls be careful it’s time to take profit"
This will crash to $127 today has the market weakens !!

"New York Members of the Tribe want this at a certain price. Beautiful tape-painting, BTW."
"Unreal. I knew this whole time Wayfair was owned by sex traffickers, but never thought we would get actual proof. How else could they keep getting funding with infinite losses, while all the powers that be were conspiring against Overstock?"
"Both stocks $W & $ostk are booming with #covid19 & online purchases going through the roof. However, $ostk has an advantage with both profitability & $$ burn rate."
"Hello Ray, Why do Yahoo keeps delete your messages ?"

Wow someone buying lot of shares at market order
Excellent pump while it lasted.
Will never buy anything from Wayfair ever again. Hope the stock continues to sink.
trade war gonna bring stocks down big time tomorrow
I just went thru the press release for the convertible notes. I think I have a huge migraine. Is there anyone here that can break it down for me in layman's terms? It's really confusing.
Wonder what happened to W to 300 the next amazon xD
the stock price is totally insane
"Tom, I shorted 300 more shares yesterday. patience my friend ... you will be rewarded."
Homes sales expected to drop at least 30% for a while. That is not good for w.
Sellers today will be sorry tomorrow. Sales are off the hook at W. Best qtr ever coming up.
Bought at $28. Maybe time to sell???
"12,800,000 shorts boys they are coming for you"
"W shares jumped $100 in the 1 month prior earnings(not mentioned $185 jump months before) it already took all the juice & then some too- then comes $3 billion dilution right after earnings-sneaky & keep it quiet(everyone & analysts are getting greased,that’s a lot of money to grease with, and pump the junk) That will show in this current quarter’s earnings report though"
Go backrupt plz
"Tom, made a little money trading TTD.... bought at $193 yesterday.... then $183 after hours.... just sold at $202"

Store opening is not good for this. W will tread lower to 100 on sell off.
Wayfair is up 8.44% to 292.95
I guess this is the news that prop the stock price today?https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fence-posts-transit-apps-alt-111500665.html
somebody call sams mother and tell her to go to the basement and check on him.
When is earning
With vaccine. More in store shopping.
I don't know what's more impressive...Up dramatically in a sea of red or the astounding volume!!! Likely Buffett trying to pre-empt Wayfair acquiring Berkshire / Nebraska Furniture
"This is the Most Manipulated stock in the History of the stock market, are they sane !!"
I guess it wasn't done climbing...don't short anything in this market
WS is pulling out of this baby. $100 to make sure a lot options are worthless.
125-130 looks very plausible prior to earnings on Halloween
W reached a new All Time High at 113.71
Beat on earnings and revenues
Wayfair will eventually go bankrupt they can never pull a profit! they don't have the technology to supplement on the other end like Amazon to show a profit
Hold over the weekend?
"lmao... hey Joel ......it closed 10 cents off the high of the day!! got out after it went back down??? you make no sense, but then gain you never had!.....yes, I bought the dip like I always do and sold for a $3 gain..AGAIN!! you cant even follow along can you , son? sad.."
"If this is not a bubble, what is?"
$168 close today...
"Once again: buy, buy, buy!!!"
"Going back to Q1 2016, this company has had negative earnings. Opening a “brick and mortar” means they have to pay taxes. Taxes they cannot afford! Should be down in the 30-40$ range if not worse. Sell sell sell!!"
Ganlin you are thinking rational! You can’t think that way on this stock! You must go with the manipulation! They have crushed many! Years ago I was one of them. 238 trades in the last 44 days only 24 losing trades
"wayfair will buy amzn in two years!! amzn will have to sell, or go out of business!!"
"Massive insider selling, party is over ...first stop $153 and then $120...tick tock...CEO, 10% Owner Niraj Shah sold 31,000 shares of W stock on 03/04/2019 at the average price of $165.74."
CLOSING AT 150? OR 100 BY FRIDAY SELL ON NEWS FOR THIS CRAZIEST BUBBLE EVER
lol just tulip mania over here
Big Earnings beat!!! Revenue beat!!
"People who make comparisons to amzn shoud know that 70% of amzn’s profits come from cloud computing. Thats when they have $200 b+ of retail sales, the best supply chain logistics, an incredibly smart team, and easy to ship / wide variety products"
27% short interest??? Sounds like Tesla a year ago. No wonder this thing is getting squeezed.
Nice couple of days. Expect more buying tomorrow
"It has alot of support. Not sure why, but if your short patience is the key with momentum stocks like this. 115 is a strong area. Needs to break this."
"That’s chinese virus quarter - awareness, hygiene prevention techniques, vaccines are here - a quarter does not make a company that sells tooth pick furniture and lost money for years. Too many brick and motar stores and other websites ( RH, Amazon,ikea,etc....) will take it from here"

"Most people are using their proceeds from their trading accounts to ""upgrade the house"" a bit. Everyone has been stuck at home and gets tired of the same things so will ""change it up"" and since investors are doing well they will have the spare money to do this. Most people will be ""taking some profit"" out of their Robinhood accounts and buying some furniture and home accents from Wayfair or reinvesting in the wayfair stock. This should go up a lot."
Take profit and waiting $150 buy back
"Enjoyed the run to $200. Next, OSTK"
wow......sure hope you sheep bought the dip!! made some big money ?? has W been doing this since I left??? what a stock!!
Shorts forced to cover today. Unfortunately shorting high short float stocks is suicide right now.
Kiss of death = recommended by Cramer.
"remember when wayfair was at 22 ,, now 240 ,, what is the explainable Value ? None, its IMPOSSIBLE !!!!!!!!!"
"All stores are fully open( Aggressive sales& service to win more market /can actually touch/see the product your buying ) , people social distance , wash hands , wear masks, great viral meds available , Virus is more understood, even quarantines are reduced safely to 7 vaccines here. This all means the W scam is over =$44.44 very soon"
Going red its a muppet bubble
This stock should be down $50 today. Down $20 is a gift for the longs.
Amazon Prime had add on TV for best furniture deals in St Louis....any other MSA have adds...first in Stl.
I see a wayfair commercial ion every commercial break. They must have really amped up the spending again. Must be a disaster q. They know the only thing propping up share price is revenue growth. Wall Street about to give up that it will ever be profitable
"Huge upside to this with the ""virus lockdown"" and everyone buying furniture from home. This could easily go to 400$ or more as a share price when you look at the fundamentals especially with the ""fed"" purchasing a lot of stuff and getting money into businesses and consumers."
Can't fight the tape...I covered some PREMARKET at $97. Glad I did. I thought day was the day.... Economy too strong to scare anyone in this. Revenues keep rising. The Amzn business at work again...... But they aren't Amzn ....... One word of Amzn entering the market and this is below $80. They just dabble in that market now.
i feel sorry for anyone buying right now
"lower rev vs last q.... loss again, if not the accounting gimic... no fwd guidance...and, sp goes up... lol"
"I don’t know which report this clown CEO referenced on, but my vendor profolio is showing 40% less sales order compare to the same period last year. so are the others doing business with Wayfair that I spoke with. “The Wayfair Analyst” is clearly playing hype and dump game with y’all."
"The Feds looking to buy some overly priced, debt ridden, un-profitable companies to buy, know any?? wash, rinse, repeat. Dont worry, its just our money they are playing with.$spy $vxx"
"Just another reason to bet on Wayfair...here comes that massive Millennial WAVE.""There are 70 million millennials aged 21 to 34 in the U.S., and many are entering the stage in life where they’re getting married, buying a house, and starting a family, which is the beginning of the core 20 years of furnishing a home. That process will be done increasingly via online shopping, according to Shah.""“A lot of what’s happening in terms of the trends in technology I think will actually make online shopping incredibly popular with millennials as they get older and older,” says Shah. “Because the idea of going to a store, driving there, having to spend two hours in one store, two hours in another store, sales folks, not really have good access to selection, not know as much product information as you want, it just doesn’t seem very appealing.”Talk about a tail wind...."
@STOCK TRADER Thanks the Great info !

Glad I sold W @ $99.10/sh on tuesday.....I thought it was overbought....looking to git back in around $50/sh
Can the bull help me understand? We are nearing the end of the pandemic with meds and vaccines coming out. Isn't that big time bearish for online sales in comparison to current online sales?
PPS totally unsustainable when things back to normal. In past 30 months made 75k in both runs between 75 to 140 back to 75 up to 145 then Covid back to 45 just sold last 1000 shares at 320. Will go back to 60 80 but when..to short. Biz model not sustainable. Mostly cheap stuff. Will teplace u Don t like. Did it twice with mattresses. Ended up with 5 cost of 2.

W reached a 52 Week low at 71.30
If their sales were booming as the stock is they would have hired people like Amazon and Walmart - can't recall seeing Wayfair hiring.
"I just don't see how this company can still be in business, they lose $0.25 on every $1 of sales, on million dollars of sales they lose 250,000, I would have opened a business if I knew this was possible. I can be a CEO."
Cover 250 shares 43.89 . Will short it back if bounces back like yesterday .
Mike? You there
Ouch....this is looking a bit heavy. Could see 157 by the end of this week and 150 by the end of next. Then it really gets interesting. 150 to 124 is a mighty big gap to fill. May wanna take some profits up here before we see a reversal.
The price action is always the same. Shorts push hard first thing but can’t hold it down. Good news out tonight so shorts pushing AH. So they will try again first thing tomorrow but green by lunchtime. Mark this post
All the paid pumpers are working hard this morning.
"Wayfair (NYSE:W) pops after saying it expects to meet or exceed its Q1 2020 guidance for revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA Margin.Great, that just means losses might be less that forecast?"
W is up 10.33% to 71.90
"The news about the child trafficking came out of ""left field"" and really is silly. Even if it was happening Wayfair is still a great company creating value for shareholders. The stock price shows how much people are turning to certain companies like Wayfair during the ""covid lockdowns"" because they still need to refresh things like home accents and maybe a piece of furniture. People also get bored with existing things in the home and so may decide to remodel while ""working from home."" Wayfair continues to deliver this with boosts in share price for customers to get great values either via buying furniture or also shares for investment."
"so TOM, what did I tell you!!??....you listened and made money......any questions??"
Like selling online is some new thing? ...like people don't know about the website already? ... If any physical store posted results like this for even two years they'd be bankrupt. How do people think things are going to go when they have to raise prices 15% to start making a minor profit? House of cards.
just bought the calls back I sold this morning!! sold them for $18.... bought them back for $9 !! life is good.
"A couple of “deniers” sound like paid Soros attack dogs. Not sure exactly what is going on w Wayfair, but it ain’t no pricing glitch. No MSM outlet has covered this huge story, wonder why? As for Pizzagate, Epstein and Maxwell ensnaring politicians, business execs, Hollywood brats, and royalty with blackmail by using children and to say it went no where? That was happening for a long time. It is one big criminal mafia, the most powerful on the planet. And the glue that holds it together are the most heinous crimes you could commit. We are watching it get exposed."
"who in there right mind, to god, is buying up here? I can tell you the analysts are not and are pumping so they can dump..."
Who is buying furniture during this pandemic? No wonder the rise was just a make believe one
"This stock is such a joke. Completely manipulated. They are absolutely dead when people start leaving their house. They have no brick and mortar stores. People are going to get sick of ordering defective furniture from China real fast. Just look at the 1,000's of 1 star reviews on Wayfair."
W just lost more money....
"I am quite new to options - can anyone offer any advice as to the best puts to buy here? If I want to bet on the price dropping a lot into jan 2021, should I buy 180 calls? Or would it be better to get 320 puts?"
"EBITDA is still Negative.... More sales, more loss. Quite a scam."
Buy the dip!! Make money!!!
"Anyone else considering holding a short position long term? Use leverage to open the position, and gain additional leverage on the ride down. Definitely worth considering if SP exceeds $300. My prediction is that unless we’re hit with another pandemic or black swan event, we’ll see long term downward trend in SP paired with reduction in volatility over time. 10% daily gains will soon be behind us. What a long strange trip it’s been."
It’s nuts. They issued the convertible bond with a 72.50 conversion when the stock was $50. Now with today’s share price it implies the same deal could of been done with a $160ish conversion price! The value of that $535 million convertible bond issued is probably approaching a billion dollars now!!! Money does grow on trees. But even trees don’t grow money this fast. More like a jack and beanstalk grower.
W turns Bullish!
Market realizing how undervalued this company is..... market cap should be the same or higher than Amazons.......
"$148 max, on a trip back to low/mid $120's after any pop."
"Hi, I'm new here. I've just started digging in to this stock. Will someone please explain to me why far out-of-the-money PUTs aren't gonna pay like a lottery ticket when market sentiment turns?Is wall street really trying to sell this stock like it's the next amazon?!!!This valuation seems outrageous to me.What am I not seeing???"
My son has ordered various items and when he tries to return they just give it to him for free.
why is this going down ?
"The retail and essential stocks run is over. Now its time for travel , food business, leisure and entertainment stocks. Corona spread is falling even after the lock downs were removed. The lab created virus is not as strong as it was released even before it was developed fully. W will be back to less than 100 in a month."
Coo sold 99570 $150 what els do u need
All due to OSTK. W is best of breed. Buy before it hits new highs.
History millineals. Bought W at 85 3/19. Sold at 140...then dropped again to 90 9/18 when I bought sold recently at 150.Only thing consistent...no earnings and no one knows when/if. Don't know now if I'd buy at 90 this time...luck I guess
Google Trends --- not trending strongly anymore. One traffic spike 6 months ago already priced in. Now its back to lack-luster money-losing performance.https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=wayfair&geo=US
"Bye bye China & W-Trump initially told interviewer Steve Hilton ""we don't have to"" do business with China, and then later said about decoupling: ""Well it's something that if they don't treat us right I would certainly, I would certainly do that."""
Amazing strength. I thought this would be down $10 at least. I can't believe people are buying at this price.
"The fact that this is up, is disgusting"
Shorting with all my life savings on this one.
Overstock can't compete with Wayfair; looks to me like they're getting ready to reinvent themselves a la ICO...a logical extension of what they've been building for 20 years. LOL Byrne spent 85% of the last conf call talking about non-core biz initiatives. Wayfair vanquishing another foe!
"TOM, anything else I can do for you? just let me know..... You're welcome!"
"lmao...green on a down day, once again!!"
"This nonsense is causing harm to children. Q would have thought that?Baseless conspiracy has caused flood of calls to a national human trafficking hotline, stretching its resources. https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-whats-behind-the-crackpot-and-baseless-wayfair-child-trafficking-conspiracy-theory-2020-07-16?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo"
furnished condo with W bought stock at 82.00 early 18. Sold at 157.00. Amazon even WMT deeper pockets.
lmfao all that hype for a 2.85% drop hahaha
"W is currently priced at *triple* it's fair value based on my calculations. It should be much closer to $32.50. Just one of those shorts that are frustrating to hold, but it will eventually pay off."
Zacks pumping this up as much as possible again... not working this time lol. Flop
Buy puts !!!!
yea. I sold it at 38.00 then it went to 144.00. any words of wisdom on that. I didn't think so
"This is a great recovery story because everyone will want to have a get together soon with the lockdowns ending and so will want to show off new home furnishings. Most people want to have a dinner party after the lockdown and since unemployment is over everyone will be more willing to ""put down some cash"" on splurges like make a great dinner party. Wayfair can only go up at this point because everyone is buying both furniture and the stock."
"Stock has run up 40% in one week with support and pumping from BoA, my guess would be a secondary offering at about $70 to $75 a share will be announced soon."
"The screenshot, which was shared through social media, shows four storage cabinets with products named Neriah, Yaritza, Samiyah and Alyvia ranging in price between $12,699.99 and $14,499.99.“Recognizing that the photos and descriptions provided by the supplier did not adequately explain the high price point, we have temporarily removed the products from site to rename them and to provide a more in-depth description and photos that accurately depict the product to clarify the price point,"" Frechette said."
"Looks like the Wayfair bears are all hibernating again as shares of W bullishly reclaim their ascent following the recent selloff.Our trading shares are up nearly 20% in six trading sessions and we plan to hold them a while longer with the bulls back in control.Yup, we've seen this movie before: and Wayfair wins another investment Oscar: Best Original eCommerce Pure Play."
no way this doesnt close under 107 today
"Up $9 on 151K shares traded. That should tell you what you need to know. There isn't a reality check, just endless no cost cash flooding the market. This is a bullrush pump, short it at your peril."
It's all down hill from here
lmao..... bought the dip and made money again!! just sold! what a stock!!! came back strong!!! like predicted
Sell off coming
"Oh yeah, up big with no news, good luck holding the most manipulated stock in market."
"TOM, COO and CTO leaving Wayfair......it was announced after market closed, hence the drop in AH......not good for longs!!"
it just dropped 4 points. what happened?
I was down 4% earlier in a matter of an hour or two after i bought shares. Thanks to averaging down at the bounce im down less than 1% currently and tomorrow i will be in green. Thank you tequila. Thank you wayfair you guys sell great furniture.
"I know this will make all the idiot W bulls angry, but this company is WAY overvalued. $310 for a company with $1.86 EPS? Really?"
Insiders almost out of shares now - Officer (OBLAK) and the CFO (FLEISHER) for example have sold millions in the past month and are down to just 100k each. Earnings should be interesting - prepare for volatility!
W is down -5.60% to 109.04
Opening up retail stores just show that they are learning their business model is unsustainable. They are now fighting to find a way to become profitable
I would love to short this all the way down to $30s where it belongs...
Bye bye shorts....
Green again....yawn.....
They are using buckets to drain the Titanic. Get to the door before it sinks.
"It’s either a rogue seller, or Wayfair is clearly in this. Crazy how they took the responsibility of “renaming” and “explaining the pricing”. Shouldn’t they be pointing the finger at the individual seller? I smell something and it’s very pungent"
"Despite the tiny float, I do think the real sellers who hold sizable positions with W (even money managers) were too distracted with other positions with today’s carnage. Hope they’re out tomorrow. It will be interesting to see what happens with options expiring tomorrow and market volatility."
"W is still on track to end this week lower than last week. It’s been trending down since the high of $196 a couple weeks ago. Even if light volume persists tomorrow, puts expiring and algo sales manipulation continues, I think it will close tomorrow between $150-160. And hey, there’s a good chance Trump’s China announcement tomorrow will increase trade tensions and trigger a sell off...if that happens there’s a good chance to see $130s-140s tomorrow."
"Zacks is pumping this pretty hard here, probably a good short!"
"Look at the futures!! Wish I could buy more W now...WIll have to settle for their amazing products...Should see a $170 print Friday, Monday at latest"
That’s some awkwardly low volume.
"It's interesting these days that we have companies that exist for 16+ years and do not make profit, which have stock prices considerably higher than many companies that do make considerable profit, have solid track history, and even low PE ratios. I am failing to see what distinguishes W from its competitors, and what they plan to change to make money one day. Maybe not a good place to park one's money."
I think down side move is limited just for today! Could be wrong! We will see
CEO already said this uptick is likely temporary
What in God's green earth is going on here.
"Home Goods in Seaside Ca re opened a week ago and its a frenzy. Somehow my wife seems to find more ""made in Chiina"" stuff we have got to have.Wayfair and Home Goods.......Making China great again."
It will be back to $220 soon
This is brewing for a big down turn. They don’t have any fire power left to manipulate it. Big drop coming soon .
"One has to ask, if the CEO Shah says they do not need this money, why are they raising $535 million with the share price at 3-5 year lows?"
I just short this stock today.
"today could be a great day for w!!!!Break 200 on its way to 160 then, well THEN!!!!!"
"Did you see less wayfair ads in the past 3-4 weeks on TV? Even on way day, didnt see even a single ad on TV unlike 2nd quarter. It seems W mgmt is trying to reduce opex in 3rd qtr to either show higher margins or bigger profit.."
analyst raise target again to $225.... looks like w will be profitable starting this Q going forward... they will achieve $13.6-14B this year.. 2 years ahead of plan!!! I heard $1.50-2 dollars per share this Q!!
with the high frquency trading back and forth to each other they can make it seem like buyers as they short
"That’s what happens with meme stocks, take dem profits when you can. Actually this is a good stock to just mess around trading both long or short, the volatility is insane. I don’t think this will ever get back to $350/share like this summer though."
can someone share wallstreet journal article? thanks.
Hands up! Riding down steep tomorrow! This company is toasted!
"Sam, are you still shorting TTD . It is dropping ."
"time to go long and load up on calls...earnings and profit is a thing of the past!! this is the new economy where profits are irrelevant....its old school!! its all about sales, even if you lose money on every sale!! amzn did it, Tesla did it, and wayfair is doing it!. PEs are a thing of the past!"
ABSOLUTELY INSANE. $37 to the upside from the low in the first hour of trading. #$%$ #$%$ #$%$. Issue more debt and the stock does the complete opposite of what it is supposed to do. Are people dillusional here?
stock should go to 150. their loss is tiny only at 3buck per share. growth company selling so much furniture cant keep up with the demand.
Too many people being mean to me on this board. Makes me feel unsafe. Plus Sam has threatened my family...I won't be coming back
120 is COMING
How is this POS still this high? Good god....
"Wayfair is building out now for both the present and future. They continue to create in-house propriety technology and to partner with other cutting edge software companies to bring a “real life” experience to home furnishing decisions. By expanding their global footprint in nations that have both a strong economy and robust e-commerce demand, they are diversifying their customer base and extending their brand to millions of more people. Wayfair could easily show a profit if they cut back on Ad spend, R&D, logistics build-out, and hiring of top talent; but why would they? This company has the potential to amass a market Cap of $150+ billion over the next decade. Longs should be patient as it will payoff in the intermediate and long term."
This will go back to 25 for Q2
sam says investors buy w for safety? lol what safety? they lose money. How many dips have you bought today? lol. I bought 170 puts for 1.65 average. got out with a nice 3.5 times money.
Waif=homeless or abandoned childFare=how much you pay15k for a “pillow” or “desk”.....Stock goes up 10x same time as kids missing and being abducted from Hawaii and nothing on the news at all about it
RETRACEMENT COMING ! 2 GAPS BELOW----BIG GAP AT $120--------- ALL COMPANIES FILL THERE GAPS
Sold at $275. Netting me $300. I just don’t believe in this company too much. I could have made $900 but when it dipped I just took whatever profit I had a ran. Good luck to all but try not to stay too long in this.
Well all the panic buyers and sellers will be out of this stock after the last 3 days.... Fun to watch (including watching the huge swings on my puts...LOL)
congrats Tom
Word is Warren Buffet jumped in yesterday! He sold some aapl and bought wayfair as a hedge against a recession. He knows safety Is in wayfair! Smart man!
Sam is buying the dip! He's a billionaire!
Sam TD Ameritrade has ton of shares.
Silly comments from shorts as always. Cutting costs makes sense and Analysts will upgrade stock in next couple of days. Expect to see shorts cover in the last hour of trading
Average target price is over $100 a share. It is over 40% discount.
The insiders keep selling to the sheep. This won't last forever. The fall will be epic!
"It is time to go back up, this is a good company."
Something really wrong here Just saw a you tube report with W’s head guy in pic with Epstein and the thought is child trafficking guys are using grossly over priced items like cabinets for money laundering
Yawn..... buy the dip! Should go green again today!!
I feel this is a growth stock you need to own. Anyone sold should buy back.This is better than TSLA. I bought at all price points.I do not think shorts get the point
"At 40% annualized growth over 10 years, Wayfair could have annual sales of $196 Billion. Assuming 6% bottom line profit, profits could be $11.8 Billion per year."
"With the huge sales increase, will they post a profit? They have not made money in the last 19 quarters."
it will fall.. the question is when. I don't think the next couple days it will. especially with more upgrades coming
looks like 2000 all over again
"I'm trying to see the forward guidance here---lets see, municipalities going broke, school districts going broke, white collar job loses, commercial real estate collapse, health care system in shambles...and everyone is going to fill up their home with new furniture?"
Every second of every day a new all time high
W suppose to show a profit tomorrow?? Did they outsource their operations this year or something?
Good call Justin
"This company has no chance of ever being profitable, one day the axe will fall."
Long or short at this point?
Whoos investing in welfare? Wth!
Is this W dropping 134 today ? Yes for thumb up and No for thumb down .
Benjo hyping this stock while basing Salesforce is priceless.
Always good for a laugh. Up 2% when market deep red?
Amzn & Shop drop 5-10% in the last few days. W dilutes the #$%$ out of their shareholders & pops up $40 In 1 hr ??? Yeah right= pure manipulation
"I would not invest in this company my order took two weeks to arrive when I got it it was damaged.Trying to return is a hassle, been on the phone for an hourI will never but anything from this crowd again"
The resistance was $143 and that hasn't been broken...tested 3 times.... it's off to the races again...
"YES !!!! Tank you $:&:$/)/. Don't know why now, but I'll take it!"
Relative strength indicator (RSI) over 70 usually indicated a stock is overbought. W is showing 85!!!! This short is one very obvious trade. Stocks do NOT hover this high at an 85 RSI
"It’s not if W drops huge, it’s just when. Market makers can’t hold this up forever. Shorts keep selling short. They are just loading back up for a big drop. There is absolutely nothing good going for this stock. It has never made a profit since it started..."
Shopify and even Overstock is down. Why is this POS still up???
