Recent headlines and conversations for CRM
"its a normal trend base on history to dip temporarily when a company buy over another. after the dip, usually it goes higher than ever. go do ur research."
It has grown 150% in the last 5 years and people are saying sell sell sell. This stock will rise by the end of the year.
Thank you
That was the best forecast by any company ever I think. Crm rocks.
"Selloff intensifying sorry longs CRM just cannot stay green, we won’t let it"

$234 will be seem in Sep.Under the high VIX period.This is free to you.
"I am in IT and Tableau is an extremely hot data visualization tool used in big corps. This is a great acquisition that opens them wide into cloud based big data, an extremely hot topic in corp america. The great thing is it breaks them out of their normal Marketing channel, and inserts CRM into core operations. Look beyond the incremental add to the core CRM space. Bought in on this dip."
CNBC has it up pre market why is yahoo down
With the leak on a segment of earnings this crm might hit 120 tomorrow. Nice!!
Run CRM run
Wow!! Look at that strength!!
Nice spike!!! $300+ here we come!!
its just a matter of time that CRM will shoot up...
The last time i saw people pay any price month after month in stocks was 2000
Benioff knocking it out of the park as per usual. The growth potential he hinted at is tremendous. Stock you want to buy and hold. Tune out all the noise of the bellyaching shorts and traders. Long and strong ......and rich. :))
CRM drops when market shoots higher...CRM drops when market heads lower! Got to love these easy short positions. Shorted at $241 AND IT'S THE EASIEST money I have made so far. We should still have another $40 OR SO TO GO BEFORE CASHING OUT...But so far WAY in the money with no risk of losing it...ZERO chance this ends green today...ZERO chance
Unreal buying opportunity
"Not perfect, good close at relative high of day"
bagholders are quite silent today uhh?
I have seen stocks soar 70 -80 %In the time crm is stuck in the mud .Insiders selling huge amounts of stocks In the past 6 months. They know the company has had its run
Fed can’t support stocks anymore. What that mean? They buying houses now?
its only up 26% maybe it could go up to 50 by close! lolo
"Great company for those wanting to play it safe long term. Can’t go wrong investing in Salesforce. It may not go up like NIO or Zoom, but at least you can feel confident you own a well established company with lots of room for future growth."
"oh well, just take my $113 bid out ,cancel it, which jim isJim"
"6/11 Suntrust RH raised CRM target from $182 to $189. Sorry no link, but posted to my Fidelity account news."
"Chart pattern analysis is showing an easy read (up in morning, down in afternoon), can’t hold any gains. It’s likely going down and market is turning over (big) and getting tired. Too much risk now. Short the stock, short the market in near term."

CRM isn’t a day trade it’s a long term investment into cloud and Data solutions. That’s where the money is at
"I'm new here with her 512 shares @ 221.29 who else is a player here so I know who to chat with?!? And, no, I don't exaggerate. My holding is posted on Webull and will post again now to verify."
"im sorry, but if you havent bought today, do it tomorrow or else u will regretttt it madly"
"I have CRM AMZN NVDA AAPL NOW , SHOP - they are down now but all of them are gems and will do well in 2021"
Should have gone up $275 after earning
Holding for earnings.
Dirt Cheap Price get in now. Will be back to 230 by friday
If for some reason this is down tomorrow I would back up the truck.
DROPBOX earnings tomorrow. Enjoy
People....even AFTER raised yearly revenue guidance the stock is still going down. This stock isn't down on slightly lowered EPS for next year....it's down because the CEO paid 30 BILLION for a company they didn't need.
Keeps going down WHY!!??
slowly dancing up.
disappointing to say the least....
Looks like the defeated shorts have finally quit and ate their losses.
Gold price is decreasing almost 1%
Take advantage and buy on the dip children. We're not going to hold it down here forever for you.
CEO looks like a more successful version of Big Ed from 90 day fiancé.
CEO of CRM always supports his Company by going on MM. every earnings. he has faith in his company and supports his Investors.
"Oversold, technicals show a rebound, great solid company but at the end of the day the market hates it. The most Green Day we might see all year and this turd was red! Sell now because this is going much much lower"
One hour away to market close........AH momentum should be at least back to $160 or so. Going into EOD if we get back to the opening range around $150 will be a good sign.
Now down over $6.00 per share. No rhyme or reason to this except profit taking after a moderate rise in stock price. So the way forward is to keep it on a short leash. This stock isn't going to hit anywhere close to projections for at least a year or more. better to put money to work elsewhere.
just waiting for that big pump. Then we will all be celebrating. Don't worry about the upsets
This is so under valued it makes my head spin.....same with Alibaba. You just keep buying and allow Mr Market to take care of you as it will.....this is a huge value and will fly over 300 in a flash. Boolean
"My fellow CRM investors,1. Looking at the charts, it seems that CRM started the year (Jan-2020) around $180 per share2. Around Aug-2020, the price was around $200 per share3. As we speak, the price is about $2204. So, let's take the average price: (180 + 200 + 220)/3 = $2005. Is it mathematically ""fair"" to assume that $200 per share is about a good entry point?Peace!"
"We won't see a real rebound until we get some really good news. For now, keep your powder dry; cash is king. Some great buys are ahead. Don't pounce too soon. Take nibbles. DIS, CRM, NFLX, V, AAPL and even index funds: DIA and SPY.I am not an expert and not a professional advisor."
What is wrong with this stock it keeps falling??
Given the 3 day break i guess this was the buy off the 200
I see China trying to take the lead on all matters technological and trying to dominate the world. I see China trying to make a CRM knock off. As with Huawei and NIO ect will they be able to replicate and replace CRM?
NO Support here till190.00
Strong third quarter earnings
CRM reached an all time high at 182.50
I’m holding during the correction. I bought at $220 and $227.
"only have a half position on, would love a chance to add the rest."
When the exec board is selling shares........I’m out.
ALL THESE SHARES TRADE EACH DAY AND IS A NICKEL AND DIME STOCK.
"/// UP 1,100 % in 3 months....#3 Most Research requested OTC stock by Institutional Traders...AABB. New Gold-backed Ethereum Blockchain tech Cryptocurrency Token / wallet. ..""- newschain asia broadband ""."
Time to buy. This is a winner over the next few months.It will flatline in early December. But this will recover. The rewards are great!!!
CRM being added to the DOW Index
"A $1 up day is the definition of a dead cat bounce, looking for a 5-8% selloff tomorrow"
The march has commenced...the green Mile is upon us!
CRM is down 5.40% to $114.47
The market will probably be down tomorrow because of trump. Let the dust settle and possibly wait till Monday. The results were not bad. I think this will be more of a buying opportunity If it does go down significantly
"Some support at 230, if pay $50 for WORK then be 180"
The march back up shall commence very soon...here comes the great green mile! $170 tomorrow.
I'm holding this since the beginning of December lol nothing changed in 3 months 
I have a decent amount of 152.5 calls that expire 9/7. Hope this spikes next week.
Salesforce.com is up 16.59% to 251.90
CRM reached a new All Time High at 154.40
"Fading again, like clockwork."
"Trading nation says buy Oracle and sell CRM, so short CRM here and go long Oracle, keep in mind Amazon uses Oracle in AWS offering"
"SHEP. HERE...................................... If you live in Georgia, vote Republican in the Senate race on Jan. 5 because if the D's own the Senate, too, they will vote to take away the STEPPED UP BASIS FOR INHERITED ASSETS. So that means when you pass away, your kids will owe tax on your appreciated CRM stock. Now if you pass away, your kids can sell you stock the day after you die and will owe no tax. That is a huge deal if you own an appreciated house, or other real estate and your stocks. Gridlock in Congress is good."
tbt to when Benjo thought CRM was a sham at $185. He has coincidentally disappeared.
"At P/E = 200, this must be the nicest stock to buy. Appears very cheap at that P/E."
BOUGHT 2000 SHARES OF VERB - I SAW THE NEWS ON MY TD AMERITRADE CRM NEWSFEEDAT $1.200 YIPEE
laughin all the way to bank
"Hey, when is the ""Mule"" money going to show up? Thanks."
CRM tried to buy Boomi(Boomi and Mulesoft are in the same space) back in 2010 and lost out to Dell. Dell paid a total of $60 million in that deal. Even thought that deal was 7.5 years ago CRM paying 6.5 billion for Mulesoft now seems like a very steep premium.
Will get in at 200$
"Fed, trade war and fake recession have nothing in the US’s economy. We will thrive and survive. Here comes ER!!!"
"CRM is at least making positive GAAP net income. WDAY is losing more money each year. They lost $400 million in GAAP net income last year, and WDAY is on-track to lose $500 million this year. WDAY balance sheet is looking worse each year because of it."
Lightning is a disaster. It should have been called Molasses. CRM has real transition problema. Like Microsoft with a new version of Windows
"Gonna be big move, cause CEO show up tomorrow morning."
That’s more like it
CRM is ready to surge from here!
"do you realize the situation here, the company paid $27 billion dollars, look at how welllllllllllllll its holding up, look at zoom for example, the company went down 15% after what, after postion a slightly worse q3 than the q2, it went DOWN 15%, and now look at crm it paid 27 fricking billion and its only down 3-4% this is mind blowing"
I would have love buy some calls unfortunately I don't understand options trading that much in terms of 30 or 31 days expiration and the number of contracts per trade.
impossible to take any ceo serious when they're connected to jim cramer
I am starting to wonder if we are going to have a market correction. New virus strain and new border closings etc. Should we move to cash?
"This is my worst performing stock of 2021. Not selling, but kinda annoyed."
"I went all in yesterday on the dip. These 2 companies are both leaders in their field. This acqusition fits CRM like a perfectly fit glove. I work with Tableau and the way that they take data and simplify it so the average non analyst can understand it is nothing short of amazing. In a world of big data Tableau will just become more and more important. The combination of these 2 companies will catapult CRM forward for years. While there may be some price pressure over the next few days, CRM is headed much much higher in the mid-long term."
will be a trillion dollar company in 5 years! just buy the dips
Next stop $260
don't worry. Salesforce always goes up.
"$CRM will be paying a huge premium to snag this. As a CRM shareholder, I hope they back off."
the Salesforce stock ponzi scheme is finally ending. justice has arrived.
Upgraded to Hold by loop capital. $225 PT.
BUY BUY BUYING MORE WHEN MY MONEY COMES AGAIN
"Salesforce’s blockbuster deal for the Slack messaging platform will give the software giant the visibility it needs to increase its valuation by threefold, CNBC’s Jim Cramer said Thursday."
"Short CRM and make mucho dinero, growth is slowing and CRM needs to cut 30% of its workforce not make a big dilutive acquisition"
"Would anyone ever classify this company as a roll up?If so thumbs up. If not, thumbs down and why don’t you think it is?What about their accounting? Is it aggressive or is it on par with all the other crm type SAAS companies.Thanks in advance.Good luck.Peace."
The tape is showing CRM will open $147.25 Monday- sorry longs
"AAPL partnership is very nice news. It will bring more believers into CRM. $200 EOY, easy."
Sell CRM and Buy TWLO instead?
"Profits taking with big time is unavoidable by tomorrow, since it's way all time high today and market 's at its record high already.....meaning a pullback is certain / correction for healthy going forward in long term...ofcourse for every stocks, specially when it was at its top point....."
https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/cramer-weighs-salesforce-general-motors-163114986.html
This is a gold mine at these prices...Load the boat!
"Just started my position at $220.50 with 3 shares today (small street I know). Could not be happier to own this amazing company. Have been looking at these guys since $180, I’m absolutely in love with everything they do as a company and with benioff leading the way you can’t go wrong. GLTA"
"added more under $151, will add again if another drop. Great buying opportunity to add here. Benioff on Cramer tonite, I think, which Benioff will talk up benefits of acquisition. This will rebound this week if not tomorrow,"
"$140, please!"
Why does everyone here have pure short-term thinking? Nobody thinking about the long term
"This is the industry trend setter in CRM, and it will show how strong performance looks on paper later today. Just biding my time, loaded up with shares that I bought for well under $100. Veeva will move in sympathy along with a host of other smaller players."
"I don’t understand some people here how impatient they are. If you are investing here for a quick buck, it will not happen. Sell now and invest in airlines, cruises etc. By CRM buying SLACK, it slowed its growth, temporarily, but it’ll be a rewarding investment about 2 years from now. I got in originally at $128 and loaded up more after the Slack deal and average now is $190 per share. I have now 25% of my portfolio invested on this and now it’s time to sit back and be patient. Let’s see if I’m right in 2 years "
i bought my first call option ever for $185 and im really scared
12/18 $280c Let’s rock
Trump 2020
CRM is one of the only stocks that's up today despite the fact that alot of stocks today are RED. BUY BUY AND BUY THE #$%$ DIP BOYS.
Just initiated a new position in CRM! Great stock for the long term!
crm appears to be in a tight trading range
Salesforce paid to much for Slack and has now to much debt. This with rising interest rates is a bad cocktail.
if i see it goes down today i will sell half of my shares stock will need to get out doesnt look good
Buy the dip folks you will regret it if you don’t
Buy in the 140s?
CRM up $1.70 pre market so far. It could get all its loss back this AM. Amazing!!!
"ER coming up on Tuesday, Monday this will run up a bit going into Earnings. I believe CRM will beat and expect CRM to get over $160 again. No reason to think earnings will be hurt from this quarter. The big question will be guidance, if solid may see hitting the previous high."
Sell. Price target 185.
"Do you guys think that there is a public share offering about to happen in order to pay for slack? I think it is rather unrealistic, but still..."
"Buy when there is fear. Sell when their is giddy, silly exuberance.$PYPL $AMZN $SQ $TSLA $CRMDon’t fall for the old dinosaur’s technology. Some old greedy Wall Street Fund Managers have egg on their face. This temporary phase will pass. And the young employees at these out of touch old greedy fund managers, will be putting their funds dollars where the future lies, not what grandpa greed can not understand.Grandpa greed will pat their young “protégés” on the head for thanking them for getting them in on this dip."
CRM should Buy ZI before it gets bought by another company.
Co-CEO? I think they made too much $ to pay 2 CEOs. Why not use the $ for dividend.
"Interesting, nothing but kudos from everyone on buying Slack, yet the stock price does not seem to like it."
NASD is up 2.57% and CRM is DOWN?! Are you kidding me right now? If the Nasdaq had no change today would CRM have been down another 5-6%!?
Talk about frustration stock gains $4 yday almost gone in 30 mins (from down $2) can we just have the momentum stay for a while pls
have not seen such an unloved stock before - where Facebook just keeps roaring even with all of its issues...the good thing is Mr. Market always corrects for these things. Boolean
"PE ratio of 134.19, needs to smash expectations and raise guidance. This is going to visit 140s in the near future"
Just in - CRM sold me the company for $159 billion in cash. I used the pocket change I have left over from my amazon acquisition
I will nuy CRM when it is below 200/share.
Going to 100 after earnings
165 is the number
Will be green against the market today...
oversold and at lower end of Bollinger. will come up soon.
My short position are working well yesterday . it seems it will go well today as well
"If you missed it yesterday, Give a listen now. Rory Cutaia CEO of NFusz on iHeartRadio's CEO Money. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcV2mD7Jt4M #CRM $FUSZ"
I guess what analysts predicted “ the software outage & resulting rebate could hit the outlook” turned out to be wrong. If proved again and again don’t trust them because they are often clueless.
"Tomorrow CRM could hit new highs, if so CRM could start a run up to $180 target. I say this because of the strong full year guidance provided in report and if validated on CC.....look out above.I think even the stupid Fed wont derails CRM momentum."
ITS GOING TO 180 WATCH THOSE WHO SOLD WILL REGRET
Pre market looks good. Breakout to $227-$230 today?
what happened?
Buy it tomorrow. Anything under $155 is a gift.
170 here we come. Wall street analysts will be jumping on once again.
This stock is going to choke big time today. Instead of salesforce name it sellsforce. It sounds better.
There should be 3% selloff following earnings announcement regardless of beating estimates.
Joseph Hogue recommends $CRM! Check him out on YouTube.
Up or down after earning this afternoon?
Closing green that’s my bold call
mkt did not like that acquisition.
scare tactics....sit tight
The slow ascension has begun
"Your welcome to all the longs that took my advice, sold their long position at $3 higher than current price and shorted netting a huge profit with more to come tomorrow- folks only listen to me if you want to make money"
Crm should change the name to service force. They are dominant in their area and will easily be 250 billion market cap within a year. Big big money going to be made here. Lock and load.
"Any time you get a rise in the pre-market and then big drop off in open market, it’s a falling knife and no touch for at least 3 days. Intentionally rigged to reel in the Retail investor and then the smart money people will Buy after big shake out happens. Remember the deck is always stacked against the retail investor. Long term this stock will be fine."
If you use salesforce your clients will stop answering their telephones and your sales people will get burned out. I see this as a fad.
never going back up..... neither is thay amzn i bought @ 3400
"top of the market in tech, mark it, all stock deal"
CRM 230+ today......I love this company. Bought shares yesterday to start. Let's see where it goes from here.
Nice close
All those shorts can eat it. Just made 1800% on my calls.
Best risk / reward in the long term among large cap growth stocks!
OMG Am I glad I got out yesterday @ 106.70 and still made a small profit. What is wrong with this stock? Somebody knows something because this is more than profit taking.
"It's gonna drop by Friday.Too high too fast , lol..."
"Cloud...ok, but what does this company really do?"
in today. gonna ride through earnings
"People selling this do not understand the value of CRM! WORK buy is going to add more value in the long run! Good luck Longs, lets weak hands sell so that we can buy cheaper! I see this going above $250 this week!"
"Zoom I would be cautious, price to sales 60+ and it is a large cap, 140b market cap. Unless you expect Covid growth rates to continue. Salesforce is more than 6 times cheaper at price to sales of 9. I would buy Amazon instead. 30% revenue growth pre Covid, post 40%. Amazon is incredible. They are now making all their own chips like Apple (ARM)."
Just wait for the amazing earnings.
220 this week
I will keep accumulating CRM and will keep it for over a year.
What’s the feeling for the ER
"If you read IBD and using W O'Neil's system, boy a lot stocks a breaking out in the buying range"
will it bounce off of the 50 day MA and the 200 day MA?
Credit Suisse raises target to 150. Names it one of their top picks.
Salesforce going to $300
Hi all. When is the acquisition of Slack expected to close?
BETTER COVER
No volume at all. Still looks like a stable entry point to me.
This will go back to $224 before moving next high. Be caution do not enter next week
"If you think Microsoft vs Salesforce, Salesforce acquired Quip that teams can collaborate and work in the cloud. It has superb functionality and looks modern, Salesforce really does well executing and developing their software!"
What is the long term profitability outlook on $CRM? Why do profits seem lower than other SAAS players like $ADBE
We are seeing a higher buy volume. Let’s go
Looks like there was some legal note released today related to the acquisition. Would this be what is causing CRM to pop over 240? Why the jump today?
200 by end of year.
CRM will blow past expectations in every single aspect. Not even Adobe and Microsoft can stop it. They know CRM is a threat.
What's going on with this?
I like what I see baby
"Today, AT&T (NYSE: T) and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) announced a multi-year strategic agreement to deliver entirely new connected experiences for AT&T's millions of customers. AT&T will deploy Salesforce Customer 360 to create a single view of every customer across every touchpoint—whether it happens in person at a storefront, over the phone, in a business setting or on any AT&T digital property. The announcement is part of AT&T's broader transformation to accelerate momentum in wireless, 5G, fiber-fed broadband and software-delivered entertainment."
This will be a great buying opportunity soon!
"Whenever Wallstreet says to Buy and it’s Bullish, it’s time to Short (for the short term). Have to go against the grain in short term to avoid losing money."
Salesforce.com reached an all time high at 251.90
220 gonna go by today or tomorrow DEFINITELY first week of new yest
I shorted it before closing based on 1 hr chart
CRM not participating in the last couple market up days ....anyone have any value input as to what is going on specifically with CRM as other FANG and tech stocks have been up. I would have expected CRM would have been over $142 by now.
"Shorts back up the truck and double up, another $10 plus selloff coming tomorrow. Just as I lead you to profit today, you will make even more tomorrow"
"CRM, I’m hanging on just for U. "
"Yeah, Benioff is practicing ""stakeholder"" capitalism -- he's driving a stake held by socialists into the heart of free market capitalism."
double the avg volume. hopefully whoever was pushing this down is out. so we can let it ride!
"lots of presentations/tech conferences next week, great time to buy won't last long"
550k buy today. Wooordd
Way....a long way.
CEM will not see today’s low again. Mark this.
"The CRM shorts like Mario are not only stupid to be shorting CRM, but they post their negative nonsense constantly thinking that they will somehow affect the share price of a 205 Billion dollar company. Comical. There are maybe 10 to 20 of us on this message board (if that many), and no one who is buying or selling millions of dollars worth of CRM is listening to anything Mario is saying. Guaranteed! Mario, you’re just making a fool of yourself. You’re not even a good short if you haven’t even exited your short position yet and gone long now because this will continue to head up to the upper $200’s."
Solid time to get in
Will close around $265s
When they rotate back CRM is going to look massively undervalued
"CRM Salesforce upgraded to Conviction Buy (from Buy) with a $315 price target at Goldman SachsGoldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan added Salesforce to the firm's Conviction List and reiterates a Buy rating on the shares with a $315 price target, representing 49% upside."
"When this turned green today, I unloaded it. I can't take it not going anywhere when the rest of my stocks are doing well. I am looking to find a dividend payer. Good luck to those of you who hold it."
What's up everyone! Was in Moderna for many months and sold today. Started getting in here yesterday during afters and bought more today. Total of 512 now @ 221.29 first time investing in Salesforce. Looking forward to it.
Soon this stock will break out from the 150s all the way to 151
BLASTOFF!
the usual weak guidance after great numbers. stock gets punished. happening all year
"I don't get it! If Tesla posted results like that, the stock would be up 25%!"
investors just don't even know this stock exists but they will....
Overreaction. Keep accumulating before the spike
You can tell these SF and Mario guys don't get a win much lmao when cheering this much for a .5% drop
"I’m always a CRM cheerleader even tho they were running out of growth. 10 yrs ago $800m, now in the $20 b range. Great CEO & now w Slack. Look out. Bidding some more shares at $225"

Normally the shorts will be all over the board before ER but not so much today. I think they smelled blood and ran away. #rocketup
$CRM buying $work isn’t a surprise. Nor will it be a surprise when they buy $docu at $330 as I’ve said
SPLK reports tonight could give us a Bump in the Polls 
shaking the tree to get the weak hands out
I love all the shorts now JEALOUS and Pea green with envy...Just wait till market open another 10-15 on top....IM LOVING IT
"Hey guys, how did you feel about their recent partnerships with Vechain?"
"Pop, fade, repeat"
About to explode! Rock on
This market right now is being a joke!
9 shares at 252 = holding last week+3 shares at 227 = holding todaylets see what happens in 3 mths
"CRM has become a favorite punching bag during the trade wars , although it has nothing to do with china trade. Just an excuse for shorts and Jonny come late to pick up cheap shares."
What is happening? Something is brewing.
"When did Mulesoft become Cloud startup? Neither Mulesoft says it, nor the Gartner. I think in an attempt to justify the purchase, people are attaching all sorts of cloud terms to MuleSoft. MuleSoft is not the first company nor will be the last company to provide API integration platform. Its a platform that you can do things that mulesoft does without mulesoft.6.5 Billion is way expensive. With this, what i am actually concluding is, Salesforce is not run by visionaries. I doubt its ability to stay on top for the next 10 years."
"Holding on so far, market isn’t looking great today"
I do believe it is warranted but why is crm taking off without news? Should we expect some?
here is $200.06 of salesforce https://aicody.com/articles/stocks/salesforce-com-inc-software-and-it-services-stock-analysis-rating-2018-forecast-6fbe8f43f0d693a5/

"To be sure, the entire market should probably be a lot lower. But we all know that ""they"" won't let that happen. So, don't worry, be happy! This stock should goo to $200."
The shorts interest are shorting this thing big time but for how long?
"It’s funny how CRM is hailed as a hero this year. Meanwhile, anyone who bought the past 4 months is curled in fetal position in the corner."
I sold my shares near todays high. It almost never pays to hold in to earnings. Saved myself $1000 bucks. Will rebuy soon. Look at ZM. The last stock I saw jump on earnings was PANW. Will this WS #$%$ ever end.
"The best short term play would have been to swap CRM for SNOW when there prices were very close during the recent sell off. Long term CRM will be fine, but I think CRM is becoming a ""stale"" name to investors who favor a more exciting name in SNOW. Actually, in time, SNOW might be the better company. Benioff is good but Slutman is just as good."
A great company. Huge buying opportunity!!!
"Benioff made a huge mistake with this recent acquisition of SLACK at $28 billion. Over paying for little benefit did nothing but dilute existing shares. Investors overlooked Benioff past deals and lack of due diligence, but this time it looks investors are exhausted of ignoring Benioff's ""greater than thou"" attitude. In short, investors no longer see CRM as a darling stock with unlimited potential, instead they are placing a valuation on the company and finding it to be overpriced."
"MC is the Key thru 2022It will be hard to sell Tableau features as separate features. The $15 Billion for Tableau is a bet that all the Clouds will sell better. imo the key to growth for next few years is Marketing Cloud. Everybody who wants Sales Cloud has it, and Service Cloud is getting there too. The other niche products have to grow to drive years further out, but right now, those are too small. Every company is doing digital transformation of marketing ASAP. This and security are the hot spots for IT now. Salesforce has the leading digital marketing products (because they bought them!) and now faces the challenge of keeping them fresh, integrating them properly, and making them more usable. They've done it before but its no slam dunk."
Brian Schwartz Oppenheimer raised PT to $265 today with buy rating
Where is Mario?
Ironically in a building right next door to Salesforce Park you'll find Slack headquarters. How convenient! Sounds like this was planned out a long time ago
Why down when all other cloud stocks are up? Is it because this company actually makes a profit?
Tonight earning is very important. it will go to 170 or to 140. which i prefer to see 170.
I think Crm is good stock for long term nice financials and 2021 will pass at home office so CRM will be better
The average price prediction for CRM is $267 by the 3 top research firms/analysts. I would trust that more than what anyone on this message board says....especially the shorts who just want the price to go down because that's when they make their money. Good luck all!
buyer200.00-210.00
"Largest IT Provider. Earnings are huge and mostly subscriptions. Watch the customer attrition numbers and see the unmatchable revenue stream - it's a raging river. Note the acquisitions and integrations to meet the largest companies' needs. I have posted here for a decade that Salesforce would be as large an IT provider as anyone. Meanwhile the competition continued to chase far behind, in the land of Low Margins and motley Legacy Silos. I am upping my prediction: Salesforce will be THE LARGEST provider of IT products and services. The software architecture, and the culture, are that good."
Why doesn't Mr. softie buy them?
CRM great company oversold RSI close 20
"Which company is more likely to buy Twitter, Google or Salesforce? $CRM $TWTR $GOOG"
Don't trust Amazon's cloud. The hack today was huge.
Great quarter- label me long
WHAT NEXT? $300 tomorrowguys? Let’s talk about it 
Buy in now while you can.
Huge buying opportunity!!!
Think in years guys. CRM will have a new ATH for sure. Just wait. Amazing growth company
Just went all in on this dip. May still go slightly lower but this is a great acqusition that will propel CRM forward for years.
You know its at a decent level when you hear analyst after analyst pound the table that they overpaid. It appears most were #$%$ that the deal wasn't leaked before retail found out....no time to make a position.
added. Will add more if it keeps falling.
"Last time I bought before earning date@239, three months after today @235, should I sell or wait another 3months"
Ouch!
Sort of CRuMmy last month or so...Cramer not pumping enough?
Very rarely I get in right. Bought at 217... let’s see and hello all
Golden Cross and OverSold. Heading HIGHER.
Just doubled my position. You people just might be shocked
Get ready....CRM is about to take off!
"Very disappointed in recent action, since CEO told us that he is a socialist."
226 limit order triggered. Scooped up 200 shares and liking this entry point
Everyone needs to mute “D” he makes no since
"Is it my imagination or is Benioff causing lots'a market angst about CRM? Acquisitions seem to be overdone regardless of teh price point. I am delighted I wrote some covered calls on CRM with a nice premium if $12+ and expiring in Jan 2020 with a $170 strike. Got m,y cost basis down to a reasonable level of ~$150 as long as it does not get rocky in the next month or so.."
CRM will open lower tomorrow they missed guidance and the quality of the earnings and revenue beats were poor. After hours trading is thin and not a good indicator of how it will trade tomorrow. Shorts should feel very good about how this will trade tomorrow
"This is one of the most corrupt earnings report have ever seen. The whole mulesoft thing was an IPO scam and the SAAS has had more data breaches tha the rifles in the Civil war. The company is just silly and if you have ever had to use the customer service software (sure most have) If you have ever had Philippine, Dominican Republic or India customer service on computer, cell phones and the like..

"This is the time driven by soft power and industry 4.0. It reminds me of 10-15 years ago, when ERP and CRM were first introduced into our focus for business renovation. Now $CRM is standing with over 20 times market cap since then.Industry 4.0 is in front of our industry movement, and AI is in the core of that. Many European companies like Airbus, Lanxess, Faurecia, FCA, Ferrari, etc, already started to adopt AI to innovate their business, and Palantir Foundry is the AI package partnering with most of them. Why ARK is investing in Palantir and 3D printing? It is not just because disruptive technology, but also because they are the core of industry 4.0. Just imagine what happened after Industry 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0. New change by industry 4.0 has been started, and AIs are in the core of Industry 4.0.I saw one analyst from Seeking Alpha criticizing Palantir's poor customer base from zero to 78 clients since 2003 downplaying Palantir's future growth potential. I understand his point, but it is the same criticism saying that Tesla has been producing EV for 10 years, but now they ONLY produce annual 600,000 vehicles per year which is less than 2% of entire world car production, so no value for investment. I agree to Alex Karp's and Cathie's opinion on $PLTR. It is not a best stock for short term investors, but if we are looking for 5-10 years investment in this Industry 4.0 era, $PLTR should be a stock to invest."
we will see 230 by next week!
the best yet come. See 210 within next few weeks.
When will CRM be trading at 175? Why is it taking so long to reach that point?
this stock needs some love...it has a hard time running as it should...I will start playing some Barry White at the open. Boolean
Lock and load.
+$2 pop on the open tomorrow. Then back up thru $160
Mute D. Former burger flipper turned pawn for the shorts and/or the big boys wanting cheap shares. Up this morning on very nice volume. Believe your eyes not the knuckleheads.
"Listen.......every single time CRM blows away their eps estimate and the street knows it. The street knows CRM will still meet or beat the eps next quarter the street is expecting even though their ""guidance"" was light. CRM nearly always drops on earnings announcement. Nothing here to see."
I bought CRM I’m 2014 and sold it today. Thank you for the 250% gain .
These guys are so far ahead on CRM future is 1:1 personalization - combined with Microsoft Azure and Adobe.....3 long term holds.....ignore the turbulence....
"MB crying for revenue, and buying with your money. It's heading way lower. Check VMW"
"For retail investors, they can only buy little over 12% of the company, which very small % for a large cap, because institutions have 84% and insiders close to 4%. This is the next Microsoft."
Long for at least 2 years
J Cramer compares ZI to CRM. Buying while market cap is low.
No bubble here
"The stock is holding up pretty well, as long as the stock stays at -4 or -3 % during late hours then we see a great week ahead, look at slack right now, why isnt such a company going up by 2-3 % ATLEASTTT, why, people saying that crm will reach 160 are really really dumb, its gonna be a bullish week ahead, its a reasonable that the stock would reach 260 by end of week."
The negative folks on this board are playing games and dont know what they are talking about. Buy this great company on sale here. Hold long and watch your investment grow. Day trader games are getting old here.
"It was a scary day though, with CRM being seriously down all morning, only to come alive in the afternoon. I've bought CRM on the dip several times now and sold it within 2 days after a pretty good run every time. This morning was a great opportunity again!"
I’m on the verge of selling and investing in MSFT
When it goes to 340? I got ton of 300 calls.
why is this dropping now?? went below 184 already
Those who bought in at these prices will be glad 6 mths from now. Its resting for now.
This is a New Years gift
"Another 99,908 shares for Ark. They never just buy once from what I've ever seen."
another 1.5 million dollars worth of shares offloaded by the ceo.

crm is poised to have yr end run due to favorable both future rev growth and earnings. long players should have a happy and prosperous holidays.
Don’t buy now. 20 & 50 days moving average are crossing down.
Sell while you can... This stock is going to tank once the institutions are done with the pump.
"So far the $220/share support level has held for CRM. And the 9-day RSI is down to 34%. The big question is whether or not this support wll hold next week. If the $220 support level breaks, we're next going to be testing the $210/share level. My pain threshold is $218/share. If this hits $218, I'm out. What's your pain threshold?"
Huge beat by MSFT. Look for a breakout tomorrow morning from CRM...
$CRM Downgraded by Pritchard Capital Buy » Neutral USD 250 Target Lowered by Piper Sandler Overweight USD 285 » USD 278 Target Set by Jefferies Buy USD 320 Reiterated by Oppenheimer Holdings Buy USD 265 Target Raised by JMP Securities Positive » Outperform USD 272 » USD 282
way oversold.making a comeback.
Where is the number?
CRM beat on their 3rd quarter earnings ($ 1.74 per share vs. $0.75 estimated). Watch CRM will up-gap tomorrow morning!!! GO CRM GO!!!
HUGE BEAT!!! and RAISED GUIDANCE!!!
"The stock will be one of the first to nicely recover when the trade goes back to growth, but as long as the trade is value then CRM will continue to be one of the hardest hit."
Shopify Web Services is pricing in the very strong possibility that they will take over more than half of AWS customer base by 2020. $AMZN $MSFT $GOOGL $CRM $ORCL
Why is it dipping? I thought the opposite prior to earnings bc everything seemed 5x5. Anyone know why?
back to 180 in no time.
"This is pure head fake by shorts. This is better than a spike to $170. Watch next few days. Fantastic stock, cloud cloud cloud!!!"
Goes up from here imo
earing beat
"I am in at the same price, I’m staying at for two years and up to five years .They are number one in the cloud and continue to perform at the highest level."
Employees reward for doing a great job @CRM ... we want to make even more money ... you are FIRED!
Work was my biggest #$%$ Sold high and moved earnings + some. here. Been yo-yo ever sense ?. Have the stamina was buying slack when manny called it a slacking stock.Good luck to us longs ?
The market is down nothing to worry about with this stock. Market will go up in April when Q1 are published and so will Salesforce
This stock just loves making new 52 week highs and making its shareholders money. Relative to its past performance and growth strength in Cloud it does fly under the radar.
Up tomorrow
Imagine CRM has what Slack needs for growth and the opposite is also true for CRM. Keep buying.
No mention of the 12 million new $crm shares https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1108524/000119312519210979/d767953ds8pos.htm to pay for the revenue and still struggling to post earnings per share
CRM holders have been expressing their feelings by slowly selling since the potential deal was announced. Those investors leave and new ones that see the benefit will enter
*SALESFORCE SAYS NEW STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS TO RAISE COSTS IN 2H
"We have a very unwise president. To grow US economy, TRUMP should try to expand to the world with our technology instead of trade war. Closing the door to the world is very bad. We have very low oil price and low tax such that our economy should be very strong. Unfortunately, it is not. I don't think he can win the election this time"
Well at least I got Chewy at a decent price
"Slack always said that q1,q2 2021 would be when they really start to break out, those earnings reports are going to be insane with salesforce synergy."
During the upcoming conference call I expect MB to announce Salesforce has purchased Seattle's Space Needle for 50 billion
balloon deflating. BURL like stocks maintain the rise and go high
Congratulations
Really nasty 6 mo performance. Hoping this is the beginning of a strong bull run
time to buy some calls!!!great stock
"Desperate longs, shorts load up the boat"
This is a $300 stock before the buyout and should double in 2 years long term in my opinion. It may drift down some but it is buying opportunity!
Expecting a huge run up this week leading into a blockbuster ER. This is a stock you want to be in.
the Salesforce ponzi stock scheme is still strong. still trading at crazy multiples.
"Jim Cramer: "" the deal is ""brilliant"" and will double Salesforce's stock.""Let's do this"
46 cents vs 55 expectedbig miss
Still like the fact that $CRM owns $8 Billion worth of $SNOW. May become an incredible passive investment.
"Drip, drip, drip. Salesforce is going to be limping into dreamfarce, then more drip, drip, drip into there next less than stellar earnings. The competition is starting to take a real bite as they begrudgingly shift to the cloud. It's real and it's happening right now."
"D really needs to find a company whose trend is down, not up, if he wants to short something. He loses every day in a big way!"
double the avg volume with 90 minutes remaining.
I remember the investors who were so stoked to pick up shares at $220.
Here we go it about time
Cramer will probably appear again and pump this doggyCRM.
How much will $CRM pay for WORK? also ACRX buyout buzz... ACRX 2x coming...
Low= buy at 155.30. Yes

"Lol, the fact that Jim Cramer is on CNBC STILL trying to talk up CRM just reinforces how he is a HUGE outlier on the Slack acquisition. Been trying for days now to turn this lump of coal into a diamond. It ain't happening."
Why does wall st hate CRM only after I buy it
CRM can trade all the way back towards its 200 sma around $200
I BET DIVIDEND WILL BE OFFERED SOON TOO
"On CNBC's ""Fast Money Halftime Report,"" Josh Brown discussed his thoughts on a potential Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) and Slack Technologies (NYSE: WORK) deal.Salesforce could boost Slack's user numbers up, helping it catch up to Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) Teams numbers, said Brown. Salesforce could also use Slack as a premium way to bring users into its ecosystem and upsell them.See Also: Slack's Stock Spikes On Salesforce M&A ReportBrown likes the deal, saying Slack would do better with Salesforce than it would by itself. He compared it with how Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) helped further Instagram.Although bullish, Brown sold his shares on Slack due the pressure on the company and Microsoft's ""unhealthy"" intent on killing Slack.Slacks's stock was up 22% at publication time."
I had to read the posts pre market today just so I could laugh after my gains. Beautiful bullish rectangle. $300 is on the horizon.
Green Day is a Green Day! Perhaps we see it continue next week but at least we closed even for the wrrk
I think it’s time for MB to move on to something else.
shorted more at 118
Director Wojcicki Susan purchased 6000 shares today. https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1108524/000112760218019258/xslF345X03/form4.xml
Amazing numbers!!!
I regret buying this stock..Seems like it will never go up again.
great buying opportunity off a really good quarter
Pumpers really did it good.
"Fed said the obvious, strong economy and prolong trade war. So we are good with that. China can’t win the war and they know it. Their tariffs have nothing on us. Our tariffs to them have crippled their economy as more and more companies are now trying moving their factories. The market is turning around and CRM #rocketup!!!"
"Thankfully we got out of this DOG today, we’ve been at a huge loss since last earnings report.....the Slack acquisition killed this stock b/c everyone knows they overpaid it"
Would love to see a Finnish strong over $270. Wonderful day.Glta.
The distribution in process and no buyers. This is heading lower to 180.
Short the stock at 275 300. This is where you buy.
Huge blowout! New highs tomorrow!!
Triple bottom - watch the technical here -
Time to start lowering my average price per share. Thank you
Any buyers of CVS? Great long term investment at year lows. GLTA.
some predictions  for tomorrow maybe green day
Down 4 days in a row .. $125 to $119!
Shorted $275.14. This is top for today
RSI went briefly over 30 earlier this week but is now back below. Just hang tight...
"This is the perfect time to load. Oversold, now overlooked, and some investors getting impatient and pulling out."
Dirt bag Robin Hood traders and their puts
Why is this stock going nowhere after great earnings and forecast???
"Waiting for a big bounce to help out my 12/31 $250 calls. Tomorrow will probably be another bad day, but next week the selling should have subsided and we should start bouncing back to $240 and beyond. I don’t have the funds to buy a sizable amount of shares, but if I did I would definitely be buying now while it’s cheap."
Breakout! New atm #crm
many thanks to the bozos for this sale
Get ready. Whisper number?
Buy today or Tuesday..........?
Cramer did his best tonight on Mad Money to recommend a strong buy.
"Painting a picture of higher highs and higher lows since the last big drop... headed back up next week, imo."
Thanks MM's for the quick Hit and Run on the short side for almost 5 pts. That is rare for this stock.
Get ready to buy this weakness.
easy $160 tomorrow ...cover now before cramer interview with Marc
"Just wait until all the price target raises, one of the best reports of the earnings season."
Buy buy buy!!! Great discount
actually performing better than many techs....oversold is being solidified. Boolean
Think long term folks.
FOMO at its best
bulls tend to ignore the 10% crash but celebrate for a 1% pump . That is why you always hold the bag
3 minutes to huge buyback announcement imo
Lots of form 4s filed on May 22 right before earnings week. A bit disconcerting.
There is no reason for Salesforce to go down.Its buy the dip opportunity
It’s coming back!
Time to book profit now
cloud stocks are the king of the market!
time to get onboard
"With its undervalued / screaming Cheap, everyone will load up buying more and more of CRM today ...cause it has very good guidance for full next year..."
"Cloud is the future. I own Amazon, Microsoft and salesforce. All 3 have been money makers."
Are they posting earning report before the market open tomorrow?
$240 coming very soon.
this is such BS I can only laugh at these markets lol
God Cramer said to buy at 150 ish so its about rite Booyah
"A great company, a combination of two great companies! Huge buying opportunity!!!"
That is incredible! Buy buy buy.
"Fundamentals, ERs what moves the stock long term. In 5 years, I am expecting $1 trillion valuation. CRM makes $, good 20%, YoY growth, p/s only 10. This is far far cheaper than Snowflake and like with P/S of 50-250. Microsoft doesn't have as much growth ahead of it as Salesforce. Microsoft is a very mature company, P/S 11."
"WOWRecord 2nd quarter,,raised guidance !!"
"Thank you Jeffries & Co with the strong upgrade at Noon, adding a target price of $189 -- while stating that estimates should be easy to beat. Today's shorts are going to be toasted pop tarts once the earnings are released, huge gamble to bet against CRM."
"Question. If an insider thought stock in the company received through options was going to go up, would he/she sell every share received the same day they are received? I.E Kieth Block. Just a thought."
Pure market manipulation to the finest. U only lose if u sell .
long and strong 250 will be next
Just wait for earnings. Just wait.
Finally green!
what is so special about this cloud company to have this high evaluation?
Way way overdone imo work will make crm even more sticky
Don’t forget CRM owns 2 million shares of SNOW.
Fantastic buying opportunity I’ll be loading up on all the dips. Salesforce ￼will be unstoppable now￼￼￼
USE 2ND STIMULUS MONEY GO BUY SALESF ORCES SHARES BUY MORE MORE MORE
"Did the market cap of CRM drop by 36 billion after the market learned that they'll be buying Slack? A deal that turned out to be priced at $27.7 billion. If so, shorts sure know how to work longs because Slack shouldn't be valued at ($8.3bil). How about the quarter, were numbers so bad that CRM needed a 15% haircut?"
"After thoroughly researching this stock, I'll pass."
Added to my position AH at $232.20
earnings in 2 weeks......this puppys oversold and gonna bounce...dont sell.
"After earnings stock will be at $175 then, Microsoft and IBM will start bidding to acquire salesforce, bidding the stock to double close to $400 but, Apple comes in with a huge offer and we are at $500"

"Classic after-hours action , down huge from the close in the evening, but instead, it is up from the close pre-market. Wild times. This is one of the best earnings/forecasts quarters of anyone anywhere , again. We are so used to it, we may forget to notice. And a missed estimate? Missed guidance matters to me. Missed estimate just means that some people estimated wrong."
What a day :)
Crm has great news every single today. This is a power horse stock!! Nothing stopping this train to 200.00. Sales are booming!!!
Generally after crm reports it drops and then rallies... At least that was the case for the last few and I would bet on it again. Enter tomorrow at the low and that's how I'm going to gain.
it is going to be a green day. 160 on open
Way oversold
CRM is by far a solid company in an unstable economy.Mark is one of the few CEO visionaries that will make a difference in business restructuring and help us get out of this pandemic with flying colors. I refuse to believe any stock analysts' flawed opinion to rate this fantastic company as a sell on mere speculation without any solid facts...
Depending on stimulus and vaccine approval I’m sensing $235 or more by end of week. Still oversold.
Bought 50 shares on the dip. Benioff is pretty good and I think he can make this buyout work and compete with MSFT.
"Disclosure, I do not own any CRM stock, SAS holdings are ADBE, INTU, WDAY, MSFT, DATA, ZUO, TWLO, but HOLY #$%$, Salesforce just delivered a MONSTER quarter! CRM is a beast, do not buy into the lower guidence, sandbagged 100 million on cap ex. DOES ANYONE BELIEVE CRM is not going to BLOW away numbers going into the Holiday season! CRM is going to $400 a share in 12 months! Will be add CRM to portfolio Tomorrow! Salesforce is my #2 idea in SAS after TWLO!"
Just bought in - guaranteed 25% upside. Thank you
Sold my shares at a loss two days ago-what a shame
"nice buying opportunity, Salesforce always bounces back and makes new highs."
this baby should be jumping up. I am gonna hold my calls till 155...
The downward pressure on CRM cannot only be due to Benioff selling shares...partuclarly if they were planned option sales. I cannot tell or point ot one thing is particular but something tells me the fundamentals of this strong company have broken down...maybe I have that all wrong but sure looks like it to me...fat daily volume and lower lows and lower highs... the 30 day chart looks weak to me...anyone else?
Bear market in crm!! Down 30% frim high much more coming
"The press release says: RAISES FY22 REVENUE GUIDANCE TO $25.65 BILLION TO $25.75 BILLION.Q4Should that first ""TO"" be a ""FROM""?"
50 day going to be touching 200 day fairly soon is that a turning point ?
This is exciting. I'm excited. Keep going.
Love it when you get a quality leader at a discount. Its like buying AMZN 3 years ago lol
Who else backed up the short truck today right before close?? This is great!!
No worries at all with CRM. Good week incoming!
Bam ! Nice day
Every single digit seems to be a resistance right now. Need to be patient and hold long. Hopefully 240-245 by EOY. Go longs and happy holiday!
"Longs, let’s be humble and treat your family out tonight. Tomorrow is a grand new day. We’ve fought a battle pre ER! #rocketup"
This should be around 300!!
"I sold short $5,000,000.00 at the closing bell today."
Like if 160 by friday
JD is next big winner
Will there be more positive price action on Monday after this is added to Dow?
Sold as posted last night and bought AAPL. CRM was not making me money. AAPL up nice today and cheaper to buy.
Bought more when it went below 2%

Auto desk sympathy most software down. Back to $55 tomorrow on investor day if markets positive
"exceptional company , falls in good earnings. ppl are loosing their logic here"
CRM has nothing to do with the Chinese tariffs..This should have been over $160 today...The ongoing tafiff bull szitt needs to stop !!!!!!
"Just purchased a bunch of shares of CRM, i think crm is one of the best to buy currently, look at all the news you can find - https://prwirepro.com/salesforce-inc-crm-nyse/"
$230 by Friday. RSI under 20 means Way way oversold and short squeeze going to take it past $230.
"so who is likely to buy CRM? Cisco, MSFT"
This IBD article accurately expresses my concerns below in the previous post...I like the stock but think I will take the 50% gain on my Jan 2020 $170 calls and roll them further out to June 2020 with the same $170 strike price and improve my cost basis by $6 more which would bring it down to $145. That should provide enough downside protection. I am not as cofident about CRM as I once was for the same reasons in this article.https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crm-stock-buy-now/?src=A00220&yptr=yahoo
This is why dow index chooses CRM not other bigger name.
time to water Salesforce with the grow juice before earnings.....big beat on deck
Fantastic Quarter for both SalesForce and Slack. Will be adding.
Yes. They beat but trading at 16x sales compared to $CRM which trades at 10x Ttm sales... and are profitable. Still a show me story and likely to go down in the next few months. This is a sell the news story.
CRM to soar. Watch the action into market close.
Let’s break $230 today!
Wait till Salesforce proves purchasing Slack wasn't a mistake. $300 by June.
All time high.
Why does the media completely ignore that CRM killed 6 months of investors
Buy at much cheaper now! Thanks Cramer!
Why pay that much for Slack....
MHO This is looking very weak on high volume. When volume returns to normal this may sink below 200.
Big beat...just a little light on guidance. I'm keeping every share!!
CRM reached a new All Time High at 141.60
"absolutely shocked CRM is breaking $200.........I got out way to early in the mid $180's. I hope ER supports this level otherwise CRM will drop quickly, and give me a decent re-entry pointI give those brave souls who held on a huge THUMBS UP and continued profit."
"LOOK this company BEAT the street on all metrics, YOU all, after hours SELLERS are a bunch of mother $$^&$^$%^"
"Last week CRM, would have traded over $300 on these numbers today, down $5. 12 billion in cash! 24 X cash flow!"
In at 216. Let’s go CRM
This is going to launch Monday. #$235.00
How is Health Cloud performing?
Lets hope we can finish green today
Lol man seriously retail investors you just think everything goes up. Crm is not positioned well at all for covid. Keep buying though. Thx for the short gains.
260 by 25th this month.
I’m new here and need a little helpful information please. Is this a better investment than PLTR on both of their pullbacks? Thanks in advance for any helpful feedback.
"I have marked you for 160. This way or that, I will get it."
Beat big
"If anyone reads the $CRM earnings call, they use Sonos as an example of a company who transformed their platform in Q2 to help them transform to a 300% increase in Direct to consumer. Not only does it speak wonders of CRM, it is a sign that Sonos has a lot going for it at this price."
"First time buying in to this, not exactly sure what the business does but keep dropping and I'll load up my truck."
"NASDAQ is down big time dragging everything with it, nothing wrong with this company"
Good read on CRM https://youth-investment-group.com/2020/08/26/salesforce-surges-14-as-investors-rally-behind-better-than-expected-earnings-results/
Good chance going 160 plus tomorrow
Gosh who is this Mario . He must have invested his life savings into shorting crm . The panic in all his comments wow. Get help man it’s only money you can Claim bankruptcy and start over. Stay away from meds cliffs and ropes .
"It ran up so quickly primarily due to prop trading....This is not TESLA or AAPL, volume going down and retail investors are not interested ... should go down soon!!"
"After the Fed meeting this afternoon, we'll be movin on up, to the East Side. 151 will become the new support level. This co is too powerful and has too many revenue streams, all profitable, to be held hostage by some short thugs. Out of 45 analysts, the consensus is a buy rating at 1.7."
Don’t forget crm blowout earnings!!! Way way oversold.
Sorry for whoever panic sold. You didn't do your homework on Salesforce. They are the shiznit of the software world.
DO YOU SEE ANOTHER GREEN WEEK in the TOP Stocks in 2021 ...CRM...and AABB from BUYING the DIPS..??
why red after close?
long should thank for short to provide supports all day.
"The conference call is a must listen....barely beat revenue estimates and guiding lower.....all other companies in the cloud are beating materially and Salesforce has these type of results!!! Plus, they had an acquisition that helped the top-line...analyst will be keying on results excluding acquisition and IMHO, will send this downward to the 140s!!!"
Wow what a disappointment again. They really lost investors confidence...this is heading much much lower...we might see $150
"Ok, guesses on After-Earnings movement? Up 10% or down 10%??J"
Benioff proud of CRM being net-zero...He should become net-zero too...Lose some weight dude
"Any correction is temporary, long term wise it’s nothing. Load and hold good business!"
Down to 233 after hours. Buying Slack which the analysts think they are paying to much for. Do not bet against marc. Tomorrow let this shake out a little and then will buy more. i really do not have that much currently.
"No brainer to buy and hold for long run. Amazing results, great guidance and making acquisitions - what’s not to like?Let get it"
Crm had the best guidance for any of the tech stocks. Cheers.
"Wow, every article on yahoo is positive for CRM telling me to, buy the dip, don't sell, price targets were increased, outlook is grand, Cramer is positive, but why then is it stagnant? Is it just following the market? There is a little too much positive news about CRM.....so it'll go down...ha..or not...watch and see."
"If the Market is Red tomorrow, another 3% shave to the downside for CRM"
haha poor shorts.... bragged on shorting 240 last night... lol
Sold 224.80 :-) I should have sold at 226.00 oh well
Hello didnt Cramer say to buy this
Tax selling?? Was looking promising there at $229 lol
Dreamforce next week followed by earnings the week after. The Salesforce 2019 pump period approaches with haste.
Steady and slowly. Perfect!
Listening to Benioff talk makes me very happy I sold my stock. He talks like he is the only guy giving to charities.Break-up Salesforce.
when the slack deal is comming in? i remember it being in march
Why are there so many insiders selling their shares at these prices if this is such a good company to be invested in?
Sell or still buy? Any suggestions?
Was there a downgrade this morning? Why are we down almost $3 pre-market?
Looking for blowout 200 in july
A decent volume!
Over $200 today. Earnings on 25th I think it is
Why isn’t it flying!!!! They beat big
Nothing says top then to be added to dow
Platforms are moving to PLAN
"For the last 2 years, Salesforce has greatly under performed its peers. It has taken time to prove its acquisitions would bare fruit in term of sales, earnings, and margin. This quarter was a game changer and has lots of room to run as it plays catch up. Just getting startedAnalysts across the board agree:Salesforce price target raised to $300 from $250 at Wedbush, OutperformSalesforce price target raised to $300 from $196 at Citi, BUYSalesforce price target raised to $295 from $220 at Stifel, BUYSalesforce price target raised to $287 from $210 at TruistSalesforce price target raised to $285 from $210 at Piper SandlerSalesforce price target raised to $285 from $235 at Jefferies"
Looks like we need to wait for Fed meeting and Powells speech to get CRM to get over $160 today. This should have opened above AH trades of $159 if not for Fed meeting.Hopefully Powells message does not change and does not disappoint market expectations (like no rate change)....if we get by this we should see $160-$162.
"Such extreme wrongness as the recent posts is rare. SFDC pay to employees is among the highest of any company. I do not like that, but it is a fact. SFDC makes huge profits but GAAP creates huge paper ""expenses"" from the acquisitions and the use of stock to pay employees. If you make two billion in cash, and use that two billion to buy a valuable company, does that mean you made no profit? It does in GAAP. (simplifying of course.) If your stock goes up in price, does that mean you made less profit? It does in GAAP, if you paid with stock. Ask your CPA if you don't believe it. The IT infrastructure is already built and they paid for it, no problem. They are paying for expansion, no problem, to accommodate the billions of dollars of new business that they get. Note that these expenses - bandwidth, compute cycles, energy for cooling - all have declining prices, while the cost of designing and implementing their scalable infrastructure is done. It is the competition who now face all those expenses, without the premium pricing that SFDC receives as the best product. It is the competiiton who are forced to buy SFDC, which has no need to sell out.To change platforms now would be ruinous. MSFT never was a ""friend"", anyone who thought so does not understand modern business. Alliances are made when mutually advantageous and broken when it is to either one's advantage. Siebel was a legacy on-premise loser, an example of what not to do and what not to buy. SFDC has the leading products in SaaS, and is the only big company that is still increasing revenue rapidly. It is a bargain and I will buy more today, under 71."
Does anyone know that CRM is hedge fund's one of top 10 stocks?
I repeat 160 on this. I be buyer around 120.
CRM is getting more and more boring! What a choppy chart!
"fat-headed benioff could buy his former boss Larry Ellison's Oracle and instantly become a force rivaling Google, Fartbook, Amazon. and Apple."
Wake me up in 10 years for now keep play your little game
CRM is down 4.91% to 163.69
"So, to make the deal ""worthless"", CRM's market cap needed to fall, by $27 Billion. Back to $210 to $215 will get us there"
Are you holding through earnings?
"How we feelin about earnings? They’re expecting a 6% move, thinkin we pull higher or lower?"

This is both a growth stock AND a value stock...
"As someone not invested in CRM, I see this dropping to a more realistic price point through the week. As you’ve seen many say, it went up too far too fast. Just like Apple this previous Friday did, only to see a pullback the following trading day. That would be good for longs as the investments would be sustainable ones if that happens."

"Hi, honest question trading Gurus please explain how to work this out. Lets assume a stock would go up/down 5% after ER. In case of CRM the current price is $161. So 5% up or down is either $169 or $153.A $162.5 call is now priced at 300$, which means the stock has to hit 165.5 to make my 300$ break-even, In case of positive ER the stock would go to $169. The price of contract would be 6.5 with effective profit of 350.Effectively, Am I betting 300$ to win 650$? Please teach me how this works."
First time buyer of cRm and I’m in.
Crm is way way underpriced. Fear is now gone! Always buy a stock with a high pe cause earnings have a great chance of getting better. Buy low pe means the stock is at its maximum peak.
In since June 29 $180.00And very happy.Should see $235.00 soon.
Next stop is 180 for crm
"16% haircut into the leak (I hate a leak) into a blow out earnings followed by a deal that many believe was overpaid. Well, what’s the worst that can happen now? All the news it out. In my opinion we have found a basement. 2 weeks we should be at least back to 245."
this will be at 300 by june

if CRM gets back to pre-earnings levels....back up the truck and buy as much as you can afford. Todays price action looks as if CRM did not report yesterday.These Macro issues and sentiment is ruling the markets vs the individual companies results. SAD!
ER = Sell Sell Sell these days unless you are lucky. Guidance is most important to watch it seems.

I believe in this stock. IT looks very easy to hit $250 in summer.
CRM or CRWD?
Consolidation has finished. Tomorrow will be opening higher and close higher. Uptrend is on the way.
have a $50 buy order in.. MAY need to bump it to $55.
The only thing that worries me is that all the news reported states that everyone is OUT but CRM. Does this mean that Mark B could announce they are making an offer? Scares me enough to get out before they halt the stock pending news.
why is it going down??
waiting for at least 217 to get out should do this weeks ago pfff
Reason why we are not at 180 plus is the perception of decreased growth due to addition of recent acquisitions. Will there by synergy or dilution. Looks as though the diversification is not hurting as much as some forecasted and this should ease the negative influence on share price and get this back on track to steady growth. See you at 180!

This stock wants higher . Given no massive macro event we will see 240 by year end .
Retail will get crushed chasing this. Hedgies all dumped their overvalued shares already.
msft up over 4% after hours. crm should be up 10% tomorrow
All aboard
MARIO: Thinking that posting on YMB will move a very large cap stock like CRM is foolish. Trading range is $215-230. CRM already dropped 23% from its high. How much lower do you think it could go when all this company does is grow??? You are insane for shorting at this level.
A lot of shorts posting on here

Inflection point!!! we continue to pop through 152.70 and i think it show accumulation underway and the pop over $156 tomorrow.
Is there any explanation for why Dreamforce starts the day after earnings this year? It's all virtual this year and maybe that's why the conference is a week or two later than usual.. This might be overly optimistic of me but I'm guessing it's been a really strong quarter so they had to push it back so their employees can talk openly.
I predict that they slightly beat on both revenue and profit but that isn't good enough in this market anymore. Stock probably slips a few bucks.
Why no response from Marc or Salesforce?
"if 8 did not BUY so much of AI I would buy more of CRM, this is looking like an opportunity, especially if it dips under 200s"
what a letdown something is wrong
Crm is way cheap here!! Pe is 150 but growth is way way to strong. When it’s 300 pe will be 12. Buy at this level. Growth ahead will be spectacular!!!
Why....?

"This was my maiden voyage into CRM after watching it for some time. Beyond the Benioff sales, the educational / charity spin off or tax dodge wichever you prefer - it appears to me CRM is entering or has entered into a very different phase since the Tableau acquisition...I covered some of my calls and sold off the position in those calls leaving a smaller covered call position. Until I see some recovery of significance, I remain on the sidelines with a small CRM postiion. I did migrate some assets to PAYC which seems to be getting a lot of positive inflows and visibility - price is a bit high but a solid stock."

This is actually fantastic for CRM. Only down 4% for a $28 billion acquisition. Short-term pain for long-term gain ￼￼
Not going to tank by a longshot and if you short you will be disappointed. That being said you can park your money in a better investment until management redirection.

How in the world can they raise expected share price after those quarterly numbers and conference call....I don't understand what they're looking at...that's why I do things on my own..these analysts aren't doing the right thing for their investors....look at this PE, look at the gross margins...in addition, yes, the revenue is growing but the bottom-line isn't....how can they have a market cap this size?

never never hold a stock like CRM. Sell and move on.

Pe 150. Sweet!! Big number!!

Not even worried. I don’t care how much they drop it. I’ll just buy more

Tomorrow will be another buying opportunity. IMHO.
Can this stock be $280 already?
Made a nice 3% selling calls and PUTs on this the last month. Flat is fine  y’all just don’t know how to work the market.
many have sold off on good earnings to pop back hard the next day.. this will do that on a short squeeze

I don’t know why people are selling and shorting after the acquisition. To continue to grow u have to reinvest lol
Bought more today at $226. CRM is my largest stock holding. I have the upmost confidence in this CEO!
Long and strong.
New 52 week high tomorrow for CRM
buying more on Monday morning during premarket. this will pop soon.
good time to buy. momentum has shifted green. buying in at $220.80 this should be a 1-4 week hold.

Sell CRM and buy GE. Be happy.
Strong support @220
Have a feeling the combination of ER and Slack uncertainty ￼is going to bring Salesforce down about 10% this week. Wait a week or two if you want to buy this cheaper ￼

Aquiring Slack will have an immediate impact to CRM's bottom line. Together they will create a power house. Look for multiple upgrades coming tomorrow!!
"bought a little bit today, but im hoping for a bad quarter or aquisition blunder to send it lower. Would love to get more lower"
Will finish well in green today
"CRM cannot get past $155, always pulls back. I would have expected after last ER CRM would have been well into the $160's! I do not get it, what is holding this down so much, and PLEASE do not say insider trading by Benioff and execs. He has been trading on a schedule for years."
"Not saying I would ever sell my beloved CRM stock, but $2 more to go and were probably headed to sub $200 share price. I hope I’m wrong. If not, I will continue to add to my position. Love the future outlook of this company"
Amazing results from an excellent company!!!
this stock goes to 230 this year. add to your portfolio today laddies. the fundamentals are outrageous
I just sold 1/3 Of holdings to buy CRM today at 116. 200 BEOY
Back to220.00
huge bubble!!!
"Very positive on salesforce stock performance in 2021, and happy with the position built up buying at 245, 230, 216 and 220. Averaged at 223.86. Price target of 275 is okay to me. Go Salesforce, you look good !"
Close below $214 would be great for tomorrow’s fall towards $210 and then next week we drop below $200 when markets correct themselves
Im using the product and a shareholder. Great product
All time high! Just getting started with blowout ER in its way!
"I own some shares. Seems to me, there are two forces at work here. If large enterprises are reducing workforce, or even some companies going bankrupt, then that will affect Salesforce. On the flipside, Salesforce is exactly the kind of service/product that benefits from a remote work, tech driven economy where things need to be in the cloud. I think it's strong overall, I don't think they have any cash problems, but they're obviously not 100% immune to economic ebbs and flows. Still pretty good though."
Thisnstock has been trading within a narrow range BUT THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE...bought on Friday. This has been under the radar really even with its price point....BUT BOOM...it is going to run higher soon like in pre-earnings. Boolean
The Salesforce/Amazon alliance will power this stock into the earth’s atmosphere. No telling how high we can go. The assault in $200 officially underway!
Never seen CRM up 10% for a very long time. Shorting near $240.
"This is a buying opportunity. I wish i had more funds available. The only reason for the haircut today is the back and forth bickering about the stimulus. Why even worry, Load up on these great on sale stocks. Load up on gold and gold stocks. You know the stimulus is going to happen within the next 6 weeks, when it does gold is going to rocket way up. Tech will roar way higher, airlines and travel stocks will fly. Im up 40% this year alone in my 401k. Look for it to go higher!!!!! Good Luck to all."
top pick $215 target
Sold it all done with Salesforce
What happened? Buying TikTok?
Glad I didn't bite on this one today. It is still a great long term buy and worth holding.
new all time high going to 200
Just jumped in. Actually I had 100 from $252 just added 200 at $238.70
CRM shareholders are good people. We donate to all kinds of charities and universities!
Buy the dip! This is an awesome buying opportunity at this discount. Buy it now while it’s on sale! It will rebound soon I believe!
Love this stock. As much as I don't like Benioff's politics he sure does run this company like a beast
this company isn't going away ... everyone needs to simmer down a little 
Great buying opportunity
"I see similarities between the Salesforce acquisition of Slack and when Teladoc purchased Livongo. Both acquisitions seem so strategic it was hard to understand why the acquiring companies were punished for their purchases. Teladoc has recovered since the acquisition and I believe Salesforce will do the same, only better. I sold my 1200 shares of Slack (cost basis $22) and added more CRM to my position. Hanging on for the long term with this one. Good luck all."
Way oversold. Going higher.
break that 230 mark

hope to see 160+ eow
we had good rally price around the 270 its just to high to fast i expect it to drop slightly maybe even to the 250 in the next two to three weeks before it will reach 300 by the year end
"If the analysts give us some good write-ups we get back the AH loss....These cloud companies are in the early innings of their growth so, that's not a problem...The stock prices got extended, perhaps....Do yourselves a favor...Never listen to the slime ball bashers..."
"Benjo, are you ever right? Geez, look at all your old posts. Wow"
"The look out for quarter three should be much, much higher."
It’s business time.
this could see 200 today
momentum is coming back. i see 220 by next week. Good luck to all
"1 dollar every hour, under 150 at close"
Kramer the clown just said longs should sell half their shares and sell half later he thinks it will still drop
$250 stock easily in 3 months
Am I the only one here who is totally unhappy with this CEO's extremist political/economic views?
Good luck longs. I'm out today. Taking the tax loss and moving on.
So under appreciated a company that actually as a PE VALUE....investors want SPACS with no business and just dreams.
Hello Mario!
CRM reached a new All Time High at 121.24
"Time for the wood shed; this stock was priced for ""Perfection"". The earnings report was not perfection!!MSFT is giving them a lot of competition!! Forward numbers below estimates, not good.It is going to get ugly at the open tomorrow."
very weak upside
Nice blog from Alpha: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4202148-salesforce-com-looking-support-bull-thesis?ifp=0
Down 20% in one week is a little overkill don't yah think!
"Excellent, terrific report."
Almost through that ceiling
Take advantage of these golden dips!
Looking at the chart this might be a good thing. CRM just filled in the entire gap between August’s earning report and now. All according to plan..
"CRM is very good. But this is the time to sell for short term.If you have not buy, don't worry this is not a good price to buy.I think around $250 is the best time to purchase. This is good for long term. But technically, the stocks will drop for 10% from the peak.This is my free research report.Thank you for your attention."
"Level II indicates a current after hours bid of $156.35, ask $156.70, although the last trade was at 156. There is no other ""tape"". There has been no other trading, just speculation."
"Who understands This company here, can you explain what they do and how they make money, with details? Are they good? What kind of IT do they sell? Thank you."
Longs get out of CRM now WDAY is selling off hard so CRM is next - get short CRM and profit big time
"Salesforce certification is literally a requirement for every market job in the market right now, this is the new oracle."

This thing is sold pretty hard without any reason
I like Benoff's statement on Facebook
very happy to increase my position today.
ZM + SNOW has a greater market cap than CRM + WORK...try to figure out how that works.
Amzn and CRM.....BUY...BUY....BUY!!!!
It's too expensive now. No growth left. I will buy at 160.
Guess they are gonna miss
I think it drops for Next couple weeks. I would let it settle before getting back in.
Nice chance to double down today. No doubt CRM going well over $185 by earnings.
Down $40 from recent high and Europe to place restrictions means even more $$ form CRM and people sell??
"We use Salesforce at my company so I've been watching the stock, but I do not understand how it's being bought with a sky high PE ratio? Can someone explain that?"
"MAGATrafalgar Polls: Trump Slightly Leads Biden in FL, NC, AZ, OH, MI, WI, PATrafalgar's chief pollster Robert Cahaly, who accurately predicted Donald Trump's 2016 win and his electoral vote total (306), believes that Trump will win the 2020 race with an electoral total in the ""high 270s."""
The bag holders are panicking seriously tonight. It will definitely follow the footsteps of the cloud companies.
"So why do you longs say this CRM is undervalued, cheap, etc? Its PE ratio is nearly 100, Price-to-sales almost 10. While its Qtrly revenue is growing at a healthy 24%, that seems factored into the current price. And the chart does not look good... gapping down on high volume recently. Thoughts?"
"Added to my position this morning at 146.85, seemed like a decent pullback to capitalize on. Looks like they may have released it from the algos and the shorts for a while now."
Any idea what becomes of short sale of Tableau still not covered?
Long on this baby!
CRM to 98 i guesss
bigger bubble than tesla!!!!
Ahh feels so good to be back in
"Bounced off our strong support level of 150, headed right back up after hitting it. The stock has very strong support at that base line, where it has held for quite some time. Crazy ridiculous selling could drive it below that level although I don't think there is much profit to take at this level."
see you at 112
We are at decent entry level with 40 million shares traded...... capitulation!
For those that have been following CRM for a few years. How much does Dreamforce generally affect the stock percentage wise?
this is a gross exaggeration of lower than expected guidance in Q1 2019.
"CRM is a good value at this price, regardless of what Yahoo Finance says. I bought at 83 and bought more when it topped 100. Looking for a grand slam with this one over time."
Up to $263 by the end of today....as NASDAQ already corrected 10% as of now....
"Next week major pullback starts, 15-20% correction period starts next week.. so in a month or so this will be 234!, book the profit!!"
I'm surprised the Salesforce news isn't getting more attention. $CRM is huge.
The next trillion dollar company in the making just hold for rewards
"With IBM buying Red Hat, don’t you guys think Sales Force will go up tomorrow too? Thoughts?"
This has been red almost everyday. What happened to touching 200 after the earnings?
Think we eventually hit 200 . Im in for long haul
How is a short looking pretty when the stocks gone from $180—>$240 over the past 3 months. I smell something fishy
SALESFORCE WILL BE UP TO OVER $250 PER SHARE IN A FEW DAYS SO DONT REGRET IF U DO NOT BUY NOW lol LOL
Amazing performance by CRM ... although I’m not surprised. I bought that dip months ago in anticipation of this. Again today before it shoots up even higher for ER. Money maker. Go CRM!
"Buy Buy Buy Salesforce CRM, SNOW about to open at $220/share which is like 300 % plus raise to CRM investment.CRM will go at least $20 today..In an amended S-1 filing, Snowflake says that Salesforce and Berkshire Hathaway are each expected to purchase 3.1 million shares, which at $80 per share — the midpoint of its range — adds up to the $250 million figure."
Marc is going on CNBC @ 6PM. He wouldn't be doing that if he was throwing a pig for earnings. He's going on to BRAG.
It has healthy volume .. and it's going down  no way I am booking losses on this one I will give this in my inheritance if I have to .. but will hold untill  news ...
In at 124 200 shares at 4:12PM
CRM what’s the play buy or sell?
Salesforce.com reached an all time high at 281.07
CRM will climb and climb to cover the cost of purchasing WORK. So buy now and buy a lot. This will hit $250 by year end.
Its crazy how they can keep it under $224 like that.
Impressive quarter. This should get lots of upgrades come tomorrow!
"Just sold my call for a triple. Wanted to be in this during earnings however, I had to take the money. Good luck to all longs and may the afternoon bring you good fortune."
"CNBC Fast Money show is KILLING Salesforce on this purchase. Calling out CEO for reversing course after saying months ago, this was a bad M&A market. Called out CRM because Slack hasn't made a profit and not growing enough to justify the price CRM paid. Said look for a price around $205."
They beat
"good to finally see this thing come off the canvas. this is easily the most powerful company in the cloud. Acquiring WORK makes sense to better build collaboration into the CRM platform, but my lord, why they had to pay 26 billion in cash, boggles my mind. you would think, given WORK's weak position, CRM would have been able to bend these guys over the table in the negotiation and got them for half what they paid."
I would be curious to understand why its pulling back here. Can't seem to find any news outside of Slack buying a calendar app. Anyone?
CRM one of the best out there. Maybe the best.
"S&P green, Nasdaq about to. Always remember, these are buying opportunities. Never be scared to buy great companies at discounts. It is akin to retail shopping. Higher the VIX, better the deals."
Salesforce customer base increased a lot in this pandemic situation. So In tech side good demand created for Salesforce developers. Now this slack is a additional boost for them.
Just hold on or buy more. This is still shaking off the growing pains of the Slack move.
Finally getting the attention it deserves
Opened a position for a swing trade this week. Looks to me like CRM wants to go higher.
"Internet of Things will be huge. Requires big data. Tableau + Salesforce = leveraging big data. I expect monster gains long term, and am pleasantly surprised by today’s earnings"
Look Mario its down 0.01% in AH as of 4:45pm. Is that the sell off in “full effect” you’re talking about?
Shorts will start covering more on a Friday afternoon. And a lot of buyers were waiting 3 days after earnings for things that settle to buy in.
This will climb fast after lunch. May even close above 230.00
"Sorry. As an accountant, I would say CRM's Q4 performance is not that good. It had a GAAP loss in Q4.In the ""old days"", GAAP profit is one of the most important performance measure, not all these ""adjusted NON-GAAP profits""...I am old enough to learn that things are going in cycles. Just like the ""New Way"" of financial performance measurements have replaced the ""Old Way"". The ""Old Way"" will come back with a vengeance and be the ""New New Way"" again."
WOW what a company... should have bought....
"back to normal!shorted at 226 , great profits comming"
"Is it me....why is the same article being posted on this site every few days about the Board Member and Benioff selling $1.6 Billion in stock. It appeared today, 7 days ago, 12 days ago, 15 days ago. Can you spell MANIPULATION."
$CRM short information https://marketwirenews.com/short-information/NYSE/CRM
All time high coming again. CRM is the Rolls Royce of all the pure play cloud stocks. Long term this will be the stock left standing. Always go for quality and don’t be afraid to DREAM. May the FORCE be with you. :)) $$$
$130 after ER???
When any company has ESPP tons of stocks every paycheck will go to employees account with 6 months of locking period .. employees doesn’t sell any mostly I see 4-5 years .. see where $crm is
I won’t be selling profits. There’s plenty of reasons to hold for 5-10 years
It has gone down 6 times over slack every time they announce it the stock drops obvi they are buying it #$%$ is the issue here. They don?t want to have to really on amazon like apple blackberry and zoom. It?s an amazing acquisition terds
CRM should pop up to the $225 - $230 range by Friday. Today would of been a great day to buy in at the 218 level. There are a lot of bag holders here that bought in the 240s range. Just a week ago this was trading 20+ higher. I would not be surprised to see up tomorrow Green Green Green
Slip sliding away
"100 shares long, 1 put short."
did they say how much will they buy Slack for?
"No analyst upgrades tells you this is a STRONG sell, short the gaps up"
why it is jumping after market? I think earning report is supposed to be tomorrow.
"It’s hilarious...Salesforce smash this quarters ER but give FY2021 guidance of 20.9 billion vs expected 20.95 billion, which is incredibly small potatoes. Why? Look at the history, the company loves to under-promise and over-deliver. It’s an obvious play of setting up another financial year of successive beat and raise reports keeping investors happy. No need to freak out. GL to all."
233 I see you
"CRM has become one of wall street darlings for sure. Just keep marching higher month after month, year after year..."
145 may be a support line...
for what it is worth from analysts perspective...they seem to agree on intermediate softness going forward...https://www.marketwatch.com/story/salesforce-earnings-what-is-the-acquisition-spree-going-to-add-2019-08-19?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo.
"I only have 3 stocks now CRWD,SQ,CRD I will outperform 99% of the world"
after a stellar ER we are now below pre-earnings report levels. Give me a break! Why is this not at least $145?
"Wow-what a great ongoing conference call, if this dips tomorrow I'm buying more. If it doesn't, I'm buying more."
I hear some chatter on here about Benioff and his comments on other companies and the tech sector. one may choose to wonder why someone would make such comments had their business NOT be crushing the estimates. just a thought
"$CRM Anyone has a reason why Salesforce operating income for 2018 is different between the annual reports for 2018 and 2019? Operating income in 2018 was quoted to be $235M in the annual report of 2018, but became $454M in the annual report of 2020Thanks!"
taking profits need to find value stocks CAH and ABBV come to mind growth and very high dividend yield any other ideas?
"I must say, it’s impressive to see this stock recover so nicely. I don’t own any shares but I do have some calls, so GLTA!"
"This is a must own, long term play. Will see double returns of S&P."
Drugmaker Moderna Delivers First Experimental Coronavirus Vaccine for Human Testing https://www.wsj.com/articles/drugmaker-moderna-delivers-first-coronavirus-vaccine-for-human-testing-11582579099
What’s with the high gain today ? Any reason in particular
any predictions for todays movement with ER
"Worry not everyone, just last week Zallyboy, claims this will reach $190-$200 by “end of year”.....smh"
"I hate CRM, what the heck am I doing holding this #$%$....no matter what, after ER, I am selling. Yes, I know all technology is down today and CRM just following suit with the drop in the NASDAQ, but I still hate CRM."
Still undervalued
"This is the premier cloud company stock to own. No one does it better. If you look at the Chart on Max, it looks like the stairway to heaven. As others have stated Marc Benioff is stellar as CEO."
When a company like this is down 8 percent this is a no brained to buy. Salesforce will crush shorts in the long run and throughout its history it has done nothing but that. The Slack acquisition is huge. Shorts had better lock their gains in today before the next leg up. As long as Benioff is at the controls shorts are in for tremendous pain.
"$MSFT is worth 1.6 Trillion, They can easily shell out 30 billion to take over $WORK and remove $CRM from picture"
Ok boys the momentum shift has just started. We have crossed over the red line on the Williams R. Should rip higher for the coming weeks .
Must be the shorts with the down thumbs. Don't bet against CRM and you won't lose so much money. Common sense.
CRM will probably soon become one of the most shorted stocks on the market.
.Thank goodness it closed green.
Great buying price in this range. I’ll hold for a year and double my money
I had a stop loss set at $140 today
160+ by end of next week
beat and fall again
"So it looks like a 20 cent decrease in earnings. PE keeps on getting worse!! So they will make about 2.50 and the stock is selling for 160. A 64 PE!! Give the company a high level PE, say 40, that still only has a value of 100, and that's being generous on giving CRM a 40 PE. In most cases a company deserves a PE of this magnitude if their top line is really growing n their bottom line will eventually follow. In the case of CRM, this is not the case."
"With the entire sector dropping in the noon today, this held pretty well. Good sign!"
cant keep growing your company with acquistions.
Can anyone explain to me why this company is so valuable despite barely making any money?
A close below $226.57 and it’s golden for next weeks PUTS!!! Major resistance isn’t about to be broken and will break the stock next week!!! Show me the money...cmon baby show me your weakness!!!
Very Nice! I had my girlfriend add some of this to her portfolio literally yesterday. Kicking myself now because I didn't buy any.
"Thanks a bunch. I needed to sell Skack to load up on cannabis stock Tilray. Not to mention averaging up on Norwegian Cruise. Between cannabis, EV products, and Cruising, I’ve got my next 4 months of investments chosen."
Nice Gift for the holidays
I wanted to buy this before last earnings and didn't. (Been kicking myself ever since) I'm still looking for an entry point somewhere below 240. With the last few days price action maybe I'll get it soon.
I feel like the pump is coming very soon. Plus low volumes + great financials + acquisition. Patience!
CRM can deliver the baby jesus tonight and i am not sure WS will want to bid up the stock. trump killing investor confidence one tweet at a time!
lets get it lets get it
"ServiceNow or Salesforce? Salesforce will be a no brainer. i repeat myself, get in as soon as you can and keep it for a year. I'm 100% (like I'm very serious) this stock is going to rocket. Definitely should be priced the same as ServiceNow or even higher. Servicenow is heavily overpriced for it's unstable earnings and meh Software. More acquisitions means more risks taken for Salesforce to GROW. Watch the dip on ServiceNow it might drop like many hyped up SaaS stocks like Splunk after earnings if they don't keep up with it's valuation."
"In my opinion this sell off in FAANG and other big tech has overshoot to the downside. The 10-Yr Bond is still very low despite the fact it came up a lot % wise. It's up from 0.5, which is very very low.$AAPL, $MSFT, $GOOG, $NFLX, $AMZN."
OPEN $240 to $242 tomorrow and go down to $225 to $230

"This is the next Amazon, with its aggressive acquisitive nature"
Around 160 USD it will be a consideration of mine.
This stock performs. What else do you need to know!
SOLD today .... so sad ... but need some of gains back ..... hope to see this dipping to get back on train ...
This is going to 300+ soon
"Investors setting stop-losses on CRM make no sense, this stock will double be $400 by December 2021"
Will probably get a boost from $wday & $okta reports later.
"Nice run-up this morning. Value is starting to be realized. Hang tight longs! Mute the big ""d""."
Price target raised at Wells Fargo as well. Probably still going to dive since being honest by providing guidance instead of closing your eyes and pretending reality doesn't exist by pulling it entirely is frowned upon.
Seems like it is doing the exact same thing ZM did yesterday. I still think it is foolish for anyone to panic sell when it has finally found stability. You will miss the ride up and sit on the side lines with your pennies.
AFTER HOUR SHOULD BE beyond $225.00 ...as bargain kick in....
I SHORTED CRM ITS NOT GOING UP
Thanks for selling before earnjngs guys - you’ve made my day
"Now who said no analysts were positive on the Tableau? This from Goldman Sachs on Sunday: ""Salesforce is one of the most promising stocks highlighted by Goldman Sachs. In May the company announced that it will snap up Tableau Software (DATA) in a massive $15.7 billion deal. ""We are bringing together the world's #1 CRM with the #1 analytics platform,"" explained Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. ""Tableau helps people see and understand data, and Salesforce helps people engage and understand customers.""The deal certainly has the Street’s seal of approval. Five-star KeyBanc analyst Brent Bracelin notes that data has increasing value as enterprises adopt cloud and digital best practices, yet >90% of the $41B data management and analytics software market is still made up of traditional data software tools designed 30+ years ago."
It looks like the ridiculous breakout area on a decent earnings report( it was not great) was just above here. You would think $200-$205 area would be bought should it get that low.Good luck.Peace.
The shorts are posting more and more because this is climbing back up now. They better exit their short position and go long now or they will continue to lose. Heading up from here.
CRM is extremely undervalued. It's due for a breakout and any decent ER will make that happen. fingers crossed today.
"cramer said to sell before earnings, this means to buy buy buy!"
but what about Cramer's advice for CRM and NVDA???
"$Zoom, $CRM, Amazon just shows that this Q should blow out numbers! since the covid effect is all in, unlike the previous Q"
300 tomorrow
"rm i love this i wa t in around ,130"
Fair value is $9.00 per share! Keep Gambling! P/E=350!!!
Any idea if Pelosi s husband is still holding this stock
"Sorry, hit the send accidentally...the entry point was $163 and my decision is looking better now...with ~ 40% yield in the call lower value...not sure which way this is going to go but I am glad I sold teh covered calls...for now."
goldman sachs is bullish on CRM?? thats a bad signal!!! selling part of my shares ....
I've been adding in the last 3 days. Just saying :)
Today’s chart shows another down trend for CRM!
NEWS COMING BY END OF DAY ON CRM
"Dip below 220, or hold above?"
Load CRM VMWARE DELL APPLE MSFT TESLA INTEL
To the moon
This one is going to sink real hard soon - the markets are turning one 100Billion tech company at a time. Bought my 100 puts. It's is going to be a glorious fall. Parabolic rise and just as bad a drop coming.
wow!
"It’s recovering, $250 very soon."
"Guys when all the news is talking about crm and buy it for earnings, you should know that he will go down even if he beat everything.. Always happens"
A close below $226.57 is good for your puts and short sellers. Major level to watch for!!!
"HIGH ALERT ! Sell....Sell....Historic chart showing for sure,,,,CRM 'll be dropping at least more than -$35 points in just few days following the record high ( like today 's date )....Careful .....Sell 's best ...don't even hold, if someone don't want to take very little profits....."
Are you guys still in CRM? They just got featured on the watchlist at (http://stocktip.xyz)
Wow! President Trump just gave everyone a SECOND CHANCE to buy CRM! Buy Buy Buy!
"[Level: 155 USD - entry]Note for myself. Goodluck, stonks."
"If you are long, still loads of profit to make SELL it all quick and go short, you will make all your money back plus a hefty profit as this ship sinks fast"
254+ tomorrow
"Hidden Snowflake boost from successful IPO, will be found in Salesforce’s upcoming report ... :) I can see Benioff expressing caution due to COVID resurgence, but I feel the numbers will impress."
Below 220 today
Glad I got in at 213 .
I buy covid stocks like this 2 days prior to earnings.. of course the earnings are great.. I've made a fortune buying this way this year.. got in here at 204 a share a few days ago.. Just buy anything that helps workers work from home and off it goes.. Next play is ?? I ran out of ideas since I own 10 stocks all bought this way.. What's coming up?
I JUST SHORTED 3000 SHARES
I’d consider a position around 200. No more.
CRM inching higher :)
$300 in three weeks.
"OMG, big moves between -3.5% and +0.40%, it looks like the street did not like the acquisition price...."
im a buyer at $100
"Definately buy. Every year a rapid increase in total assets, with very low debts. Extremely healthy stock."
So they might miss on earnings next qtr. by a few cents it doesn't matter still raising and beating guidance for full year that's what matters!!! This is why I agree companies should report twice a year
Upgrades coming tomorrow!
i dont know abt future price but under 210 is a gift.
This will be at at least 190 either tomorrow or friday
"Especially with acquisition of Tableau, CRM is going to be an IoT beast in the future. Long term prospect looks very good in my eyes."
"Congratuations to all longs. We held the liine at $220/share for CRM. Jan 4 will be a key day. Is it the day that new money starts flowing into CRM, or the day a lot of people with big CRM gains decide to take profit (given that taxes will then be due in 2022)? Happy New Year to all and good luck with CRM."
Institutions keep buying on the dips. This is a very good sign for any LONGS! That is the reason it keeps popping on the dips.
Salesforce.com reached an all time high at 213.25
Funny how some people say they would wait till 70 before buying. RIGHT! If this stock drops 10% those people will be buying...
 this stock is drunk. Always buy the drunk stock
The road to $300 isn’t a straight line
"Ignore the shorts who bash CRM and only want the price to go down because that's when they make their money. This is a great company set up for continued growth, with one of the best CEO's out there. This will be back in the upper 200's pretty soon I believe. Should trade in the $230 to $240 range this week or next week. Just be patient. Good luck all!"
All heavy hitters are reporting great numbers and dropping afterwards. I hope CRM is the exception. It’s been dropping well before ER...
CRM is a stock to hold.
CRM will take over the world
"Two things, nothing usual about this esrning season. Companies that beat and have positive guidance are rocking. Particularly in the Cloud Space. except for Splunk on Friday. but I will bet you anything Splunk moves on Monday."
2020 EPS $2.75. Buy buy buy
Msft is a nothing more than a pimple compare to CRM established technology. why we are down I don't get it . see you at 165.00.
"When u invest in stock you think of risk reward ratio. Ask yourself a question the probability of this stock price increasing by 20 i.e 160 vs probability of it coming down below 120, you would get the answer. PE ratio of 140 is no way justifiable, even if there are goings to be earning in future and revenue of 16 billion , ask yourself for 16billion revenue can this get a market cap of 110 billion"
suprised there were no posts while this stock was up $4
"Look at FL, it had great earnings but because of weak outlook it drop big time. This will probably do the same for a few weeks"
why lower in after hours?
A company stock like CRM when falls is a life to opportunity to accumulate them.
Finish it green 
This will explode in after hours and next week
WARNING !It 's way over-valued in AH due to overreaction ......Sell 's best as ones can't by tomorrow ...
wow!!! what an ER how is this company trading lower lol...... this is unbelievable what is going on???
"Palantir owns the future of data analytics and beyond. We only get to see what they show us. What other disruptive and ground-breaking initiatives are in the works? Palantir is like $CRWD $AMZN $GOOGL $AAPL $FB $CRM $FSLR ...buy it, put it in a drawer, then open it in 5 years. You're welcome."
I have 40K to play with CRM IF it drops which I doubt. Coming back as I post. The entire market is getting hit which has nothing with CRM earnings.
Anyone else see the price gap up over and over again to 241 or is that a glitch in yahoo data
Manipulation by the F'ers who can trade before and after the bell.CRM will be down 20 points in after hours trading. There is a reason it's down 8 in regular trading.
Great buy today?????????????????????
Microsoft strength in cloud and azure not fully appreciated.....teams more integrated and safe than zoom.....azure critical for big data analysis and good compliment to $CRM
"scrol down to around 3 hours ago, I said,""Cramer says CRM will crash after earnings, so to me, that means to buy as much as you can! LOL"
Crm is huge!! Growth galore I loaded more this week at 125!! Buy buy buy.
Getting ready to ￼fly tomorrow 
Salesforce is planning to hold a virtual investor day on 12/8.
+5$ again tomorrow
Everybody relax!!!! Bottom has been reached and it will go up from now...
ok now im def #$%$ i sold way to early lol i figures on 5 % got scared sold above 3% but looking at it now wish i had just a little more patience
Up nicely and the upgrades did not even post yet. $160+ easily
Week of 11 / 25 earnings
With AMAZON AWS announcement of competing with MongoDB it looks like Amazon is going to disrupt the whole cloud industry and likely next will completely go after Salesforce customers. They are already approaching vendors at CES. Salesforce growth might be done...
"check out all the brand new one year price targets that were released today and a few days ago. notice that it is already above most of them and barely below a few of them, and plain no room up therefore a big drop"
CRM earing most of the time go up only $5 to $7 not tomorrow $15
I talk to my senior Gaurav Kumar Singh CEO of Anavclouds Software (A leading Salesforce Partner). Due to COVID-19 it is good time to invest in Salesforce.
Looks like opening at $214 then drop 2% to $210. Next week should be amazing for short sellers with the market having a correction. $180 coming very soon...make those poor longs cry
CIDM is getting a major streaming company easy buy price right now!!!
$250 coming over the next few months. $300 before year end 2021.
"The market dropped for 4 days because of WStreet. After today, it will continue to drop based on future coronavirus news. Good Luck bro as I have left and waiting for the lower price and good environment."
Be carefull here. M.B. may come out and say that he is interested in TWTR down in this area. If he does it will drop 7% in a minute !
Price movement and volume is not looking positive. I predict movement to about 125 in the weeks ahead
"Time to load up on puts, acquisition is dilutive and CRM was already losing momentum on their weak earnings and disappointing guidance"
The only way a CEO can get their stock price to go higher these days is to praise president Trump unconditionally.
Good close at day high !
hope it will destroy Shorts
nice move!

Slack is on the front page of downdetector. so is Amazon Web Services. so maybe an AWS issue
What is happening today? 7% drop!
All CRM past acquisitions are outperforming expectations. SLACK will continue this. CRM to $300.
Buy buy buy
Alot of $240 Friday calls for this Friday I see on Benzinga scanner
nah this should be up higher
And it was a golden opportunity to have my covered calls yield .70% return since May 1st and my note 5 days ago to short the stock proved to be accurate - so far. I am going to cover when if it hits 85% gain and do it all over again when CRM recovers... Market downdrafts like this are excellent oppty's to make money both ways...and offer investor protection at the same time.
Hold fast and receive cash 
Mark Benioff lives in a beautiful home in SF...Mark make your share holders happy too!! CRM has been a laggard for a long time. I thought AMZN was a laggard but when you compare CRM to AMZN...CRM is the worst!! Any insight?
Stellar
Just picked some up at $221.50. Thank you sellers!
This will end green today after call @ 2:00 PST. Its a solid report in COVID-19 times. Lets shorties enjoy this small pullback
About to head up big time people. Enjoy the ride! Get your shares now while they’re on sale!
Fourth quarter generally accepted accounting principals earnings is $0.46 and non-gaap is $0.70. Can anyone explain what caused the big difference?
Shares dilution announcement is taking forever.
"Over 160, today"
Thumbs up if you see 300$ going into next earnings.
Insanity at its best. I'm so curious to know who's buying? or Desperate shorts covering before they go home for the night?It'll be ~$235 tomorrow.
"Seems to be a curse for any company to have the balls to give full year guidance, which were excellent numbers and shows the pandemic will barely affect them. Options will likely push this back to closing price tomorrow."
CRM reached an all time high at 188.33
If you're buying at this level you will definitely regret it.
"Of all the stock that at took a big hit yesterday, salesforce is the best value by far!"
Nasdaq down big: CRM down bigNasdaq up big: CRM up a little bitHow many times have we seen this?
"Crm is a powerhouse. Same shorts were saying don’t buy Amzn at 130, now it’s 1500."
CEO going on CNBC soon.. will get a lot of positive hype going. Starting to move back up to $155
"Does Salesforce make any Visualization/ Sketch tools ?Looking for visualization tool to create sketchwith cut-away view of Victorian house*being used as a dental & medical officewith 8 to 12 human charactersand multiple captions for each characterJust never understood what Salesforce did,thought you might have visualization tools.Do you have anything like that ?E.g. MS Excel can be used to draw stuff too, if you know Excel really well."
Short short see you at 300$ hahahahhaha
This stock is probably overvalued judging from the daily trade patterns.
"I moved to cash today. I think Salesforce will be a money making machine in a few years. However, this will fall with all other stocks as we approach a new viral threat and massive closings. I will do some swing trades but at this point it is too dangerous to hold anything over night. Thoughts and opinions. Not mindless cluster B noise."
Who remembers the good ole pre-Slack announcement days? I sure do miss them.
"8 X SALES, 24% revenue growth, CRM is doing pretty, pretty good!"
I bought 75 shares at 217.95$
"I can't believe this is real. At least i think it is. Followed the options buying yesterday and bought 220's, 230's,240's, 250's and 260's. This can't be real. Most money I've ever made in my lifetime. In shock to say the least."
we will rally tomorrow along with the market recovery with at least a 300 point gain on the DOW. This drop was just adjustments for the 10yr rate and tomorrow is normal business for this booming economy.
"If you want to make $1,000,000+ buy 10 shares of CRM and just wait out the week"
Close may be $159.2
oh benjo....my 77 shares at 137 are laughing at you
Why not just say this open $300+?
Buyer at 207.5. Holding for the long term
"Calendar 2021 CRM Outlook: Low 202, High 254, Close 248"
"It's simple....the street does not trust MB anymore. As good of a guy as MB is I think the street thinks he is too nice, such that he does things he thinks are right, thinking that just because he thinks they are right they will work out somehow. Personally I think he's gotten a little too cocky on himself and deems any aquisition as the ""right one."" Serioulsy.....nearly 30 BILLION for WORK????? CRM could have built their own communications product for that amount, and it likely would have come across much better to investors. The street does not like careless spenders, and that is exactly what MB has become. CRM is a mature company and the name has gotten stagnant as compared to a company like Snowflake. Snowflake and Slutman are more exciting than Salesforce and Benioff (sp?) I'm long CRM and have resisted the urge to swap CRM for Snowflake the last two times when the prices are comparable, with both times being huge mistakes. If they get close a third time Im dumping CRM for SNOW."
"Just a little big lower, and I start adding to my CRM position. Salesforce has always been right on the companies they have purchased, and no reason to think differently now. I will be adding very very soon..."
"I appreciate everyone's opinion. I also appreciate the market is always right. in this case, the market is telling us CRM is getting things done well and the price needs to move higher. Fed and Trump hold all the cards in future market direction at this point"
Good morning Mario. How’s that short position of yours working out for you? You should have listened and gone long now for the ride up! CRM is up pretty good so far today. $230 and beyond soon I believe. Good luck all! Except you Mario. You’re depressing.
"Since then they bought slack, it got stuck"
"sold at 247 in ah, I’m glad I held it today. Earning is good but a big portion of earning is from their investment in other tech companies"
CRM BEARS MADDDD
This will go over $250 leading into earning later this month.
Feel like this could explode higher if earnings are good
i might consider buying this around 150
i saw green for a split second
"No one seems to care about the stellar earnings report. Just hate for the deal. Hopefully, the stock will stabilize abround $230/share - and we dont see a slump to $220 or worse."
CRM lost $10B+ market cap while Slack gained $5B market cap. It's a bad proposal.
Benioff has been selling stock over past 6 months...small but steady sales....about $1.75M PER TRADE...DOES ANYBODY WONDER....?
Marc Benioff has a lot to say about Facebook I don’t see Facebook laying off employees and on top of it Salesforce value increased 25% yesterday
Bullish
Still patiently waiting for this dog's time in the sun :)
Back UP to $245 anytime tomorrow...
"Beautiful action this morning, although most Nasd stocks are higher today."
Love seeing a board full of inexperienced traders saying to sell. I'll add this one to my portfolio today! Thank you all!
"Ive worked for some big organizations and I've used SAP, Oracle, Microsoft, IBM products, etc. I've never heard of anyone saying we need to utilize Salesforce software...obviously people are utilizing, but doesn't seem like a necessity like the others I listed....that coupled with all these crazy metrics, especially PE and market capitalization and something really doesn't add up..."
"""Our relentless focus on delivering innovation and customer success has fueled our growth and solidified our leadership in the enterprise,"" said Keith Block, co-CEO, Salesforce. ""This is just the beginning, which is why we're now targeting $26 to $28 billion in revenue by FY23 - organically doubling our revenue again in the next four years."""
Finally some green
"Been investing for about a year. When I invested in this stock, I had no idea that an unpopular acquisition could do this much damage to a great company. I mean, did they have to erase their cash position and pay 26 billion for Slack? I wouldn't pay 25 cents for Slack."
The beginning of a huge upside. Thank you for the discounts the past 2 months CRM! It let me make my 2021 IRA contributions and average down my position.
When will Salesforce announce they are buying the rest of DropBox? It seems like an easy buy for them now.
Always a step forward and two steps backwards 
Can someone explain in detail what the salesforce commencement of consent solicitation means?
This is going below $125.00. No significant growth this year.
"Such a great earning and good company, why do you scared? Why panic sell? Very stupid action. I bought in."
Giving back ALL yesterday’s gains this is great
CRM has great fundamentals. Holding forever!
Just a thought here... if Slack continues their impressive numbers as it pertains to users I would expect them to schedule their Q1 earnings before Salesforce. That would lead to a big rally into earnings for Salesforce.
Key question is if $220 support will hold for CRM
2 months of no movement at all. Hope to see a change soon
I heard the same fomo chant when tesla was at $900
Snake oilman--enjoying on your money. Insiders sold more than revenue for 15 years now. He is desperate. This is next VMW.
Here we go! Headed NORTH...........
Check out Zooms’s big down day yesterday and how it bounced back nicely today. I expect CRM to do the same kind of bounce tomorrow.
Big jump after hours! Big earnings beat and increased guidance
Great base building today. This stock will be $260 by earnings and then $300 shortly after. Wayyyy oversold still.
"Stop trying to send CRM lower with the same person authoring all the same false panic plays on the conversation blog. US stocks are not falling and when they announce a vaccine which is progressing toward success you will be sorry, because when they announce that the market is going to have the biggest jump and one day gain in history. If you shorted this stock you are crazy because they have a very strong outlook and profits will soon be growing when the sales contracts mature in a year or two which is when profits will be sailing in and setting new highs for the stock. Hedge funds and institutions have been buying CRM on all the dips and there is huge future upside if you read that CRM is one of the most popular among institutions and this can be researched, not some speculation of stocks going lower. Read the articles."
"My fellow CRM investors,1. We have breached the $220 price level2. The next level is $2103. When you add the fact that this is mid-December and people are selling for ""Tax Loss Season"", expect more sellers and this means more pressure on the CRM price to go down4. I am on the sidelines.... watching... Peace!"
You can call me MONEY!! But that’s Mr. Money to all you longs
Stock has down graded by seeking alpha
CRM is leveraging more cash than equity. This is good for current shareholders since the interest rate for the bonds is low.
"It looks like CRM is forming good solid support here around $223 -$224. I think most of all the sellers who wanted to sell have done so, and we should now continue the climb back up from here. Good luck all!"
Anybody seen Mario?
Muted Satnam. Sent him into nothingness.
"We probably won't know anything about the AT&T deal dollar value any time soon, if ever? Does they type of info end up in SEC filing docs?"
$CRM uses Slack$VZ uses Slack$IBM uses slack
Nvidia amazing earning and down 8 percent... CRM worst earning ever and still above 200??? What???
SHORTS MADDDD (still ahhahahaha)
Buying CRM on every dip. Love it
"At least Salesforce.com is able to bring in a respectable profit. CRM earned $362 million in net income. On the other hand, WDAY is losing $400 in net income in the most recent year, and WDAY is going to lose $500 million in net income in the next 12 months. WDAY’s revenue growth is slowing as they are now showing sequential quarterly revenue growth now below 6%, they are getting farther from earning a profit, and WDAY’s balance sheet is looking worse each year. If CRM is dropping by $10 per share on their new quarterly profit, then WDAY should be dropping $80 per share on their new quarterly flop."
Tomorrow and friday will be a big reversal and you'll regret the sells or not adding.
CRM: MMs want to push CRM to low 260
just got some
Holding strong. This is a growth stock. Have some patience
"It is all about August 17th, look on the graph. Hedge Funds bought a lot of cheap shares and now time to cash it out. Well known manipulation."

Result was very good .. market overreacting or big players playing game
Like CRM but love PLAN.
Too many shorts on board = going higher. Works every time
Big acquisition just announced!
This is about to break out.
"1st citizens trust buys 9,400 shares today"
"Load some VERB, Er in 2 days, it’s a saas tech company"
Insiders are dumping the stock like hot potatoes.
How my shorties doin today
"Blackrock, Vanguard, T Rowe all upped their CRM weight by 40-50% in some of their ETFs since end Nov"
down from $270's to under $240!! Fantastic! It was $210 just prior to earnings which beat by 100%
"Take a look at Innovative Foods, IVFH, they grew earnings by 53% and it still trades for a P/E of 6, almost debt free. And just made an acquisition that should help them grow even faster..."

Do yourself a favor and just load up for Xmas. Happy Holidays to all longs!
The pps will now have to dance to the tune of the DJI....... They all dance to the same beat.......and that is not always good for all.
I'm getting the 17 of may and the 29 for a Er... Which is it? I'd like to be in before the week as this will most definitely run up to 135 ish before
how do we know this is going to hold. 2 weeks ago it pushed back to 229 and then dropped to 220. Do we hold or is this going back down end of day or tomorrow.

"Sorry longs, 18 month low, listen and learn to those who have been warning you for years. More than a decade in business and core unprofitable (very low margins, weak balance sheet). This serial acquirer hides poor results through acquisitions. Greed gone wild, CEO sells shares rapid fire and pockets billions but wastes time on political liberal agendas, pretending to care about social causes as his pockets bulge with billions of dollars of suckers cash. Trump bashing, caring about who goes to the bathroom in North Carolina. a company run by excessive greed, hubris, dreamfarces, endless press releases, history says such companies never end well. But hey Cramer says back up the truck so buy buy buy! Truly sorry for all you suckers in this stock, who knows where the bottom is, how do you value a company with no core profitability and no control on spending like drunken sailors, a sad state. - Ski"
All time high. Yea thir!
"i sold all the shares of work when the acquisition revealed, and then bought crm shares. i like the business model of crm."
What is going on with this stock??? Market is going crazy and this looks like it’s going to fall from a cliff again...after a 25% correction last month. This is such a solid company...do the investors really hate that Slack deal that much?
"Not sure the validity of this after hours posts, but a move that big would warrant at least a news article (which I haven't seen), so i'll assume they are false. Seriously though...any stock that barely moves after such a large acquisition has to be a huge red flag. I was seriously watching for CRM to fall to the low-$140's or even $130's, and somehow investors took it back to nearly pre-acquisition prices. The balance sheet is going to look pretty bad for awhile before the extra Tableau revenue kicks in. Usually this alone is enough to destroy the stock price. Long term, I love this new powerhouse but it needs to go through the post-acquisition ""kick in the teeth"" phase first."
"its recovering, WOW! buy it while you can"
That was very Important to close above $220
People are bailing on CRM fast given today’s news on the Adobe Microsoft new offering better get out NOW longs
All in
These guys are so far ahead in CRM.....businesses will continue to invest in personalization and omnichannel marketing......L
Overpriced!!!! Get out now...this is heading much much lower. Look at the technical chart...support was broken last week. This will be in free fall for weeks to come
This is a sleepy joe stock. Very stubborn to go up but can easily go down
"The purchase of WORK for nearly 30 billion will hang over the head of this stock for awhile. CRM was holding the market at bay over the price until they slightly lessened the expected profit for next year. That is all it took for the bog boys to dump this stock and move into something that will provide returns more quickly. CRM is dead money until the next earnings. Benioff is a good guy but paid way too much for WORK and now the shareholders are paying for it. Long term CRM should be fine, but until the next earnings release CRM is dead money."
A Death Cross has occurred to CRM (50-day moving average crossing below 200-day)
a good buy in 2016. Too expensive now.
Man I love it. Keep reducing the buy in price point. Please please please.
Good interview tonight by Cramer with Marc Benioff. Great COVID company in addition to normal operations. Hope you all saw it.
250 is coming
Too late to buy ?

The only drawback to this stock is the fact that they are headquartered in San Francisco...the arm pit of California that only knows how to continually tax impose their way through a failing liberal agenda...
STRIKE PRICE 220 HEAVY VOLUME FOR TOMORROW EXP DAY
$230 by end of the week
raising guidance
Dow jones could DROP big time as POWELL fed 's speech reconfirm about heavy weight on economy recovery due to coronavirus impact.....Sell and sell before CRM heads down below $230 by tomorrow....This 's the right time for sell-off with huge money before....too late....
"analysts said that this could potentially slower, not DECREASE, or make the company go bankrupt, but it will only slower the revenue rate, please guys, understand the language of those analysts, they don't give you an affirmative answer, plus the stock is going up for many reasons, one is that it will crush Microsoft, crush email, made not one of the biggest software deals, but the BIGGEST SOFTWARE DEAL EVER, also it's at a discounted price and moreover, now the path of this stock is clearer, people now can see the potential of this stock crystal clear."
Looking at earnings and revenue growth. This looks to expensive. Just seems like stock gas risen too high. Could drop to $220
Short wait until the big boys sell
most companies stock price goes down 10 percent when they aquire another company. Its a lot of debt to take on at first and some people freak out.
"It wasn't on my list, but it's so oversold that I couldn't let the opportunity pass."
I believe that around the $220-$221 range currently has strong support. This is the bottom. It should go up from here. Especially next week. I think it’s due for a really nice run up. Good luck all!
"option vol is setting crm for a big pop, $160 calls trading for some size"
I Have 2 contracts expiring tomorrow will be better to sell open market or wait a couple of hours?
"Cramer admitted on his show this evening that these stocks are coming down more, wait a couple days and then start Buying on the way down! Sounds like a good Short in the near term and then cover before the rebound."
Monkeys gonna say timber when the market is literally blood red.
check out $ASAN.
Pfff incredible
Keep quiet and buy more.
Will CRM hold the green? I say no.
You would think Yahoo could show an accurate price...
CRM should start the rally going into the Dreamforce conference. Better buy here under $150 while you can. It’s will see $155-160 pretty quick imo.
"Folks who owned DATA will get 1.103shares of Salesforce when the buyout concludes. My question is: when will the conversation take place? I owned Data shares prior to official completion of the merger and waiting for the conversion to CRM, but my DATA shares are currently ""locked"" in my trading account and have NOT yet converted to CRM. My broker says I cannot access the funds until the ""corporate action"" is completed not until around Oct. 31st due to ""tender offer."" Seems strange to me there is a waiting period of this duration and funds are ""locked"" up until then. Anyone else experiencing similar scenario?"
congrats to all of you. This is going up!!
The bleeding is over!
Loop capital will make a fool of itself. $150 price target? On what basis lol.
"Salesforce.com Tops Q4 Expectations, Guides Q1 Below Street04:09 PM EST, 03/04/2019 (MT Newswires) -- Salesforce.com Inc (CRM) reported Q4 non-GAAP earnings of $0.70 per share, up from $0.47 per share a year ago and well ahead of the analyst consensus of $0.55 per share on Capital IQ.

The CRM chart looks like it’s beginning to change course and head back up. I hope you bought the dip!

"Trump saved shorts today, they will loose big Tomorrow when it opens at $175"
"I will become a salesforce holder this year. Never been very interested in the company although I know how great it is. I have been long on slack for about 15 months. I bought every dip and bought heavily in the teens, I was so bullish on slack because I use the product for work daily and it is truly an AMAZING product. I'm excited to make my gains and become a salesforce holder. I believe Benioff is an amazing leader, I just have never owned CRM. I do not see how Slack can do anything but good for this monster"
Green day
Buy truck load now
Looks like CRM is a bubble just like FSLY. It's not a matter of if but when.
Why is CRM still falling in the RED after a good report and everything else is in the green going up?
Looks like CRM is setting up for a good earnings report announcement. Will it break 80 barrier?
"Institutions have driven out the weak hands. Soon they will drive out the shorts. Sorry, Haiku!!"
"Salesforce continues to maintain 30% growth at staggering scale, while generating >$300M quarterly FCF- $5.15B rev (+29% YoY) vs $4.9B consensus (5% beat)- $5.25B guidance for next Q vs $5B consensus (5% raise)- $4.84B subscription rev (+29%)- 75% GM- 6% FCF Margin"
"Bookings grew slower than revenue, citi called them on it big catch this call is a disaster"
"If crm breaks resistance above the $216.50 price, it’s going to shoot up."
"Yo... to add on to the casual comments here, Slack is known in almost EVERY company just like Teams. Yeah they can't compete with Microsoft's Ecosystem, but it's beneficial for Salesforce's core business which is CRM, and organisational workflows. Now everyone will know Slack aka Salesforce. Superb branding and it's a really smart move for the slack brand. Now Salesforce will be much more valuable with Slack Connect already implemented. Now they just to make Salesforce Connect"
"FIVN and CRM already collaborate. I'm NOT selling my CRM shares, I'm just buying FIVN in addition to CRM"
All companies making everything interconnected and easier to manage will grow for years to come. Especially in next 2 years

"Well Splunk, Workday, and ServiceNow are all up nicely in this market. Wonder why CRM is taking a whipping? I suspect within the next few days we will see where the CEO sold millions of dollars of CRM shares"
 nice job Marc B!!! What a great CEO! He will be on Mad Money tonight. FYI. I wonder how Cramer is going to handle telling his club members to sell. Ouch.
"WDAY bear top and bottom......we'll see CRM pop tomorrow over $158, and then $160 going into Earnings week."
"$CRM buys $DATA for $15B, when do they buy $BOX?"
What kind of Gambler would buy this P/E=350 BUBBLE???
Anybody else see Salesforce buying a company like Shopify in 2018? Makes a lot of sense.
"compared to other software stocks, this has been dogging it for a long time now..."
Hoping this opens around $250 tomorrow

Time to sell now as it cannot go more up now
Looks like a NICE cup and handle breakout today - top around 160 bottom around 120 --> potential run to 200.
crm is in very bad position . if they make bid in here holders will crush it . low $60's maybe lower. if they walk away msft will crush them.
$234. $234. $234.This is a new target to buy.
"everyone, go see the slack chat, investors are disappointed, very, bearish for slack, and let's say for instance slack is up tomorrow, then it will be only tomorrow, and that's even if there is even a slight chance of it going green tomorrow, bullish for crm"
Don’t forget it was 170s and 180s last summer. Much more room to fall. Poor forward guidance and expensive acquisitions crushing shares.
"For all you wondering why the stock is down so much on earnings (and really underperforming before), I think the main issue really is the WORK acquisition is not fully approved yet. Until the full approval, and perhaps even the official closing of the deal, the arbitrage players will be out there scraping pennies off the dollar. Just look the difference in performance between the two stocks. When the deal is sealed in will move in lock step - but we are far from that."
"CC is at 5pm, EST. This will go up 10% once call is over going into tomorrow. Pre-Lim release numbers is a Beat on all accounts and affirmed guidance. Once call starts and questions answered should move up 10% in AH and into tomorrow."
I am in!
crm p/e 126. nvda p/e 19. what happened to nvda today? it got slammed. CRM has long way down to get to similar p/e to nvda. sad truth about this market.
Open above $250
"Insiders all selling since beginning of August. Not a single buy. I own CRM, but this worries me. We will know soon enough."
8 days ago I wrote on here that this stock is breaking out and it is. Stocks like this when they make their move you want to be onboard......-All Aboard!! ! :))
Take profits on CRM here and roll them into BABA. BABA is going to double. This is an easy trade.
Goo gooo 129
why is crm down after hours on positive Earning report? i didnt get it. are we being manipulated?
"Not a bad stock, but if your buying right now you'll be in the red for a bit..."
No movement for 5 months??
"I just all in. I have no patient to wait for the ER report after market close today. Cloud business is the most important revenue as we can see in Amazon, Intel, nvidia, Microsoft-All has a good outcome."
Prob the worst stock I’ve ever invested on

"$CRM Valuation: $CRM will pay 27.7 Billion for $WORK (Slack), which is $45 per share of Slack. Slack shareholders will receive $26.79 in cash & 0.0776 shares of Salesforce stock for each slack share(dilution to current shareholders). Thus, $26.79 is cash + $18.21 is $CRM shares (0.0776) = $45 Slack . $CRM valuation is $234.66 ($18.21/0.0776)! I believe the fair value for Slack is: 44.50=$26.79+$17.71. $CRM valuation is $228.22 ($17.71/0.0776)!"

"Yo... the acquisition was a big #$%$ move. Salesforce is literally showcasing its power by spending just a bit more on slack than Microsoft did on LinkedIn. I?ve been in 4 different biotech companies - all used salesforce. I?ve worked with salesforce developers and data integration experts. Just like how Apple created a niche market for app developers, salesforce created its own ecosystem for web developers. I imagine slack to integrate itself into the salesforce platform to allow a streamlined approach to internal and external facing aspects of business productivity."
Let’s end the day above $229!

Solid 'Corona-Proof' performer with exceptional YOY earnings (around 30%+). If you are holding long you have a STRONG tailwind. GL all.
Anyone know what company Keith Block is going to? Perhaps becoming a new CEO? MB slipped up on cramer and dropped a possible hint.
My heart is beating fast. I am don’t want to go to ER. I want to go home with lot of cash lol
Earnings gonna be wild.
$260 before earning
Now in the 140s.....
"Excellent ER and guidance is in line with forecast,"
Blockbuster numbers!!!! Get it low while you can!!!
watch it
Bought puts on many tech as they are overvalued and yields soaring. Tech will continue to drop as value stocks go higher.
"We use salesforce at our company. I hate the software. It is really bad and buggy, slow and confusing. Not user friendly at all. I wish my company chose something else."
"BIDDING WAR DEVELOPPING FOR CRM $ 140 -$ 150; who will make the first move, is it Google, Microsoft or Oracle!!!!"
Watch for a HUUUGGEE Buyback announcement during the CC....Watch
PE will normalize next year. Right now it's nothing more than pure bubble! $10-12.00 would be generous fair value for this BUBBLE!
Shorts are scared with such a great company!!!
Are you Kidding me? What growth you are talking about that is 7% in 24 hours? Yeah.....growth hahaha
Like if you think it will jump. Dislike if drops

"There is something wrong with this stock. On a day like today, it should be up."
They really needed the Tableau acquisition to close as quickly as it did to keep the revenue pump going. If you look at the revenue breakout in their release the Americas YOY growth rate decelerated from 25% last Q to 20% this Q. Came at a cost of $16B
Great earnings but does it matter now... Look at nvidia... The rise in bond rates is ridiculous... Who even buys bonds guaranteed loss on money over 10 years given inflation and opportunity cost
"Are the estimates for the earnings good or bad, does anybody know the predictions please?"
CRM is a sure fire winner--saw CEO on Cramer talks really well
Perfect Time to Buy
"BOUGHT CRM AT 132,137, AND $140 AM PRETTY SURE GOING TO MAKE MONEY BY NEXT WEEK GAP DOWN NEED TO BE COVERED UP TO $141 PER SHARE - and also this MORNING I BOUGHT VERB AT $1.20 I SAW THE NEWS from CRM NEWS FEED"
There's a good chance this goes green today.
The weakness continues without a pause!! The trend is diwn!! Any small rallies shoukd be sold hard
It looks great to see this up today.
it's going to be fine! It will go up soon
JPM removed CRM from their top stock list...but CNBC CRM give it good mention. This seems more like a valuation downgrade from JPM.
"I am having a hard time believing this is all about insider selling. IBD recently had an article on CRM and how the stock will be under pressure for a while...meantime, I am reducing my holdings and writing covered calls...short term, the stock does not look very good although its long term prospects appear solid. Perhaps coincidental to the Tableau M/A activity ...can't be sure... .I will probably use some of those proceeds to add to my current PAYC position and also write some calls against them.I have been thinking about SPOT as mentioned by one of the other contributors..."
Great.... Cramer just gave this the kiss of death
I did not realize that CRM was a large holder of SNOW...
"Looks like a very, very good Earnings report! They easily beat the consensus on both EPS and Revenue. But, just like with COUP yesterday, it comes down to what were traders/investors HOPING for? If the majority were expecting even better results, the initial reaction will be a price downturn. BUT, give it time. Look at how COUP rallied up in a huge way today over the course of the regular market session. Same think can easily happen tomorrow, as investors and traders realize just how GOOD this Earnings report is, and start looking forward to the next few months of price action..."

Today’s manipulation by market makers is for ️％ up tmr!
"Understandably, digestion of the $17 billion acquisition will take some time, but this is taking much longer than I had anticipated for what I thought was a very hot sector and a hot stock. My maiden voyage for CRM in late Feb @ $263...got concerned about the price point pressure and wrote some covered calls - Jan 2020 $170's with a $12+ premium. Was tentative about the decision at first b ut not so far. The cost basis call protection took me to ~$"
The recovery is great
Current Price at or near same level as 8/25/2020 right before it jumped. Expect CRM to fly high. It is being oversold. Credit Suisse price target at $260 1/15/2021.
"I would buy more here but CRM is my largest and core position. Soooooo, I bought HDP and PSTG. or at least trying. limit orders of 17.50 and 21.50 respectively."
"Heard someone brags on shorting at 240 when it was 235 ah. cover before it moves higher. Yeah , it will have the pullback, but chance is 260, 270, then maybe 250. Try to Win big rather penny"
Sales force need to stop playing and put up them Tesla numbers. not robbing me for my shares...
Lots of support......at $210/share. Use a Dec 31 call option bull spread ($210 - $215) to play this one. Money in the bank. Thank me later :)
Still I am a bag holder since Aug 2020. Bought @$271. Hope I would be able to break even by Aug 2021.
CRM is a good company. It will always come back strong. Take this opportunity to add in!!!
Roll ups aren’t just a fruit snack.Ones filled with sugar and the other with tons of goodwill and intangible assets.Both have commercials and one has a carnival barker.I admit I know nothing but it seems like it works until it doesn’t.Good luck.Peace.
Even Cramer doesn’t like it at these levels. HAHAHAHAHAHA he said hold off $180 coming soon and then we might start buying again! OUCH
"Wow - am I the only one who thought earnings were really positive?we hit 26% Y/Y sales growth, 30% adjusted Y/Y EBITDA growth and EPS that is well on the way to hitting FY-2018 targets and still people want more?I would be long CRM and NOW all day long."
If Benjo bashes I’m buying. If he pumps I’m selling. It works 100% of the time.
"Shirts are every where , not just CRM, they see the opportunity at year end to take advantage of the drumbeat from all corners (specially the investors who missed out this year) about over valued stocks (not sure about that but have made great gains this year) . Hoping to reset all that next year!"
"Shorted $491. Check out $CRM when they got inducted to Dow, big spike and then went down. Same will happen here. Ark will sell its investments in Tesla since they cannot hold more than X% in one stock."

The firm notes solid data points on forward-looking outlooks and field checks showing an ""uptick"" in partners meeting or beating targets compared to H1."
Smaller traders selling to lock in profit today. Seems like there are no volume sellers out there at these prices. New base will be formed and going up from here. $160.00 by year end?
The company dares to give forecasts with observations that so many companies even don’t have the guts. How the stock is going down? Let’s move it up.
Just keep buying every pull back!
"Pump it to 180 today...that's how these markets work...especially if you are short. It should be at 120, but everything likes to be green these days."
I managed to buy @ 154.6. The SP should be up around 160 considering the recent results and purchase.
Why is CRM down today?
The stock is heading back to the 160s where it belongs following their blockbuster earnings report.

"Yes, shorts got killed. We will see $200.0 soon with such a great company!!!"
Is the earnings report 3/4/2019 official? Before open or after close?
CRM is up 6.32% to 149.47
I can see this at $75 soon...
"On Mad Money 12/01/20 love how they volunteer in helping America, and hiring Veterans ,and many diverse people."
Bought more!! Awesome stock!! Buy buy!
Folks are posting the major collapse. The major collapse has already happened and priced in based off that.
Crm is real. Not like all ther others.
Looks like it’s forming a butterfly move.
Help it make sense. SNOW is breaking away and flourishing and CRM decides to break even. Gotta love Slack. Lol it is the only reason this stock is down. People will just accept this soon and order will be restored. I assume next week after investing day. Good luck all.
"CRM will hit $165 on Monday if Mexico tariff is delayed. Even though immigration issue has nada to do with CRM, it will all be about investor exuberance."
"BUY 10, 20,30,50,100 500,1000 SHARES EACH TIME DROPS"
Can't imagine where this stock would be if it had a bad earnings report !
The best deal out there just buy and forget
Expectations are super low. Easy beat
good time to accumulate a few more share for the long haul.
What goes down should go back up
Is this going to break out today?

Until accepting a full-time position with VERB, Mr. Golan was also an active member of VERB’s Advisory Board, where he, alongside such other notable current Advisory Board members as Jim DuBois, former CIO of Microsoft, and Erik Nielson, Senior Director, overseeing Marketing Strategy at Southwest Airlines, among others, provided on-going advice and counsel to the VERB senior leadership team."
"These cheap prices will not last long, start buying small qtys ,"
exactly what day is it reporting earnings
A crm run is long overdue a good stock can only stay cheap for so long before it takes off.
"Slack could be a truely hige deal for this conpany. I never put a dime in Slack after their CEO basically whined about microsoft. not a good look, shows weakness and signaled an inevitable loss to the tech giant. but their product is top notch. salesforce can give slack the resources it needs to compete with microsoft. i just went from ""buy crm for a couple months"" to ""buy and hold""."
"CRM is a great stock with strong growth, and is undervalued now. I can't think of anything better to buy and hold forever."
"They more than doubled earnings per share estimates. I think they know what they're doing. Im quite sure they know more than the CNBC clowns. If those Fast Money people were so smart they would not be wasting time on TV, they'd be living it up on an island somewhere. Salesforce has done pretty well with their decisions the last 10 years. Why doubt them now? Do you really think you're smarter than CRM management?"

Bought 180 shares at $224 and I’m very happy. This will easily move to $250 this month netting me a nice 10% return. Thank you for the sell off
Expect this stock to tank with other companies that push diversity over merit and other PC causes. Examples are from Texaco to Target who got crushed once they chose to get in the argument or chose equality over production. A $119 stock that makes 17 cents a year. Stay away from this one with a 10 foot pole.
"Brent Bracelin placed an overweight rating on CRM yesterday, and a price target of 180, based on the acquisition of Tableau. The shorts have it backward and think the analysts are negative on the outlook with the acquisition."
"this one has bottomed. Cloud is where it's at and CRM, NOW, WDAY are all buys imo"
if it runs up today... earnings will be great..from past experiences playing crm earnings. .if it doesn't ...look out below..
Get it while it’s on sale. You know it’s going up before earnings.
bought more CRM shares see u at $220 next week
"Chart looks great. Breakaway gap. Going to run like Twilio, Zscaler. Stay long."
is it a buy in this price? for long term
its over valued and not good after Mulesoft merge
well now guess this wont be on sale for much longer
"Why would anyone be buying CRM right now, in the middle of summer, with market at all-time highs? CRM just overpaid (again) for a major acquisition, debt is skyrocketing, intangible assets are over half of the balance sheet value? Seem to me when the music stops, when CRM is held to reasonable valuation metrics, this stock will drop fast. MB agrees with you as he continue to sell rapid-fire. May be a great company but right now I don't see new money in this stock."
CRM holding at $220.00 today is last day to sell to offset tax's watch next week back in the $230.00 range.
4 upgrades so far with minimum $10 price increase. It’s going green.
"Up 30% y/y, guidance for Q2 provided. $0.11 EPS."
Just look at the last 2 Q earnings. Beat by over 100%. They’re gonna continue to smash earnings going forward. Such a good buy for the long term. Planning on adding more if it drops to 200$. Let’s go!

Who knew a board for a very successful company lined up for growth in the long term could be filled with such dummies thinking shorting is the way to go. I’ll laugh my way to the bank
"Told you guys!!! You can stay positive all you want the fact is this is overpriced and has to go lower. One day up does not signify an uptrend when the trend for the past 2 months has been down! Red day just as predicted and this will go back to the lows in the next few days and then back to $180 in the next few weeks. You had a chance to sell yesterday.

61 times earnings sounds wonderful!
"It is only a matter of time before Salesforce runs out of fools buying their software. Ben Franklin said, ""well done is better than well said."" He certainly would agree Salesforce is way overpriced, talk is cheap and they have nothing to offer companies to provide a system to increase sales on a permanent basis. This is a slick, gimmicky company. Eventually they will run out of fools buying their products and their stock. Should be priced at $38."

Just saw that Dynamics 365 sales rose 45%. Any estimates on how this will impact CRM?
Let’s see it bust through 224 on the open
Does this stock ever go up?
$284 to $215 is amazing. All in 6 weeks when markets have rallied...hahahahaha
Don’t understand why this is so low
"Not exactly a veteran when it comes to stock chart patterns... but this descending channel that has been going on for the past 3 months seems like it just recently broke trend. Someone please correct me if I am wrong but it seems like we are going to have a big move soon. Right now the stock seems to be resting at a support line. With the news of buying slack, this stock can sky rocket back to $285 soon. We have seen this stock has potential for a big quick move. With the latest earnings report and the recent news of buying slack, this seems destined to jump back to $285 quickly. Someone correct me if I am wrong but it seems like it can happen and if it does happen it can happen fast. Wouldn't want to miss it"
WOWZA !!! do I hear $160 ??
"today's close should put 150 in play IF and it's a big freaking IF, this weekend goes well."
Salesforce.com reached an all time high at 281.87
Nice!
"tomorrow if nasq up 50bps then crm =164, if nasdaq down 50bps crm=155, if nasdaq flat crm =160.and if no recession nonsense chatter for 1 month then crm 180."
It’s gonna touch $270 very spon.
"I added more to my position on Friday and now 1/3 of my portfolio is invested in this company. Yes, you should diversify, but when an opportunity like this comes, you must jump on it! Now all i got a do is lay back and watch shorts burn "
There is a good chance I don't know where this stock is going today
Buying opportunity!!!!
hey i am Mario's mom. Please stop bullying him
Earnings good. Will be green at some point today.
There is no question you will see sub 200 near term.
First time i owned this stock it tanked. Luckily i got out with a very small loss. Already made my money back and then some with NIO and AAPL.
Action today on CRM is great after all the attention... plus good action on the call buying. I\
"Actually, although I did add some more at 123 recently, I would rather the market take CRM lower and lower. I have cash, and I would love to add more CRM at 123 or below now that its earnings have been released, and those earnings were great! Nothing better than having a Company with great earnings being taken down by a bad market...."
THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT DONALDUS MAXIMUS TRUMP!!!!All things good in our market and SUPER V shaped recovery!!!!
Slack is great and crm and slack together will be great
CRM buying Slack????
Makes me sick to my stomach. Enters the Dow Jones. Immediately gets pummeled.
I LOVE INVESTING IN THE FUTURE!!!!#BA #AAPL #Wimi #BFT #PLTR #NVDA #CRM #TTWO #REGI
In a word. Perfect
Whats the general opinion on the ER tonight? any ideas?
$7 away from testing its 75 day SMA. Low risk entry time when that happens.
Am I dreaming? Is this stock really going up?
I knew it would close above 220 lol

Sell before ceo comes on
Jump in now!!! This is a good chance to get a low price!
"The way the drumbeat is going around markets, sounds like to reset all the indexes to March, 2020 low and start all over again! Amazing!"
one word - BREAKOUT - next resistance at 81so far an outside up day turnaround - very powerful statement!long time until earnings on 11/16 - certainly could break above recent high of 80.70expect a pause just below 83 waiting for actual earnings print
"Doing first real research on salesforce for a job interview, seems like this company and its software are the future"
"This stock has been embarrassing. Todays politically motivated society might like MB's goals and antics, but it's clear the market does NOT."
If this come out of 232 then it will go high . Donno y it’s struck between 220 to 230 . Use less stocks are moving up but this good value stock not moving
Beat earnings by over 100 percent #$%$ were u expecting
I see Marc pumping hard here. Hopefully no layoffs tomorrow as he promised to 6/1. Never easy to integrate a big merger like Tableau and hold the anticipated numbers. Could go either way tomorrow depending on how fund managers see it. Not the everyday trader.
Salesforce will have an “incredible new reveal” at the Dreamforce conference next week.
That big of a beat from $.47-$.71 we’re going up
"SAP crashed on earnings today. CRM is next, software is cooked."
Smart money just moved in CRM today! It looks like we don’t have chance to wait for 199.
"CRM rally is fading fast, Add to short position here. You should be long NOW, WDAY and ADBE and short CRM"
Tomorrow will be a Bulls day!!! It would be nice if we can get an upgrade at the open as well!!! #rocketup
BABA only stock sold more by hedge funds than CRM last quarter. They left heavy bags.
CRM ceo just called me and said he needs me to help him run crm ... I rejected because I only like to lead winning companies
$200 afternoon hours
"Great interview with Cramer, CRM up tomorrow. Good luck all longs."
Incredible returns in HUBS compared to $CRM. Should have invested in them rather than CRM..
she will deff pop tomorrow especially if market holds up
"I believe that CRM will continue to head up today once the market opens, and should trade in the $230 to $240 range this week. Good luck all!"
this stock needs patience
Tear down that wall!! That $160 wall will fall!! Timber!! It’s gonna happen amigos. :))
"other than end of 2018 drop, this has maintained a channel between 140 and 165. added earlier at 141. bullish CRM"
Fiduciary responsibility!!!! Please
Everyone knows CRM is a long term winner. Short term drops like this mean next to nothing
"$ 28 BN for a small company like Slack who never delivered a cent of profit ??? It is crazy !28 billions, guys, are you realizing??"
doesn't know which way to goit'll close green and back above 160 tomorrow
Good results overshadowed by him stepping down involuntarily. They couldn't have waited a week to announce this?
I’m very happy with the acquisition of Slack. This will make salesforce even more of a powerhouse than it already is. Once the dust settles this will move much much higher￼. Congrats longs
What you think to buy crm or slack
Efff yeahs
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-com-sees-surge-bullish-164916477.html
"Just as I said, trading red, short all longs sell now and short"
holding in the green today so thats good! Come on tomorrow! Lets break 230
My pick of the day..
"Benioff at it again......give him an audience at a forum or on TV (Cramer) and he attacks FB then goes onto his WOKE agenda. I worry about CRM long term profitability as CEO prioritizes social issues over profits and investor value. I have no issue on how he wants to spend his money and time, but its a problem when he forces those views into the company agenda over fiduciary responsibility. Read his book, he defines how a CEO and Company must evolve to benefitting the social fabric over company/investor profits to be successful in a new era. SCARY STUFF for holding CRM long term!"
"Sold my entire position today after holding over a year. Made money, but wish I woulda made this choice a while back. Moved into Apple... think they're due for a run."
"Lets not forget the stellar ER! This will trade at $142--$145 by EOY, DO NOT let MM steal your stocks, they are setting up this drop so they can push out retail investors and buy cheap going into 2019."
Coming in from slack should I hold or sell?
Back to at least $155 within a week!
I bought CRM three years ago.
where are the earnings?
Go up great = more moneyGo down great= buy some leaps
Why is crm down with the great earnings?
"Now it pulls back, from 246 to 245.5. Did short make 0.5?"
I think here the results are not as important as the expectations and future of company
Let’s close over the 21Ema 2 pop
"It's oversold, I am in"
"Headed to 142-145 next week, buying puts here is the way to go for traders."
"if u think about it Trump's good for us traders. he tweets, a stock drops so you buy more then 2 weeks later it's back to where it was and in meantime you got some free shares"
Big day tomorrow and Friday... Do we consolidate these gains or give them back. Hold onto your seats.
stay away from software stocks: any of them---they are laggard of markets due to less benefit of tax cut!
Lousy close and some big sells in after market. Could be big down day tomorrow.
Pls don’t let me sell when this breaks out to 250
"The CRM shorts are all excited and think they are winning big, but just wait. The short squeeze is coming. They will be amazed at how fast this can climb once it gets going. Shorts, you better take your pennies you made, exit your short positions, and go long now to make the dollars!"
"MB and his talk is what is killing this stock. He talkes positive about everything and being a great employeer and doing what's best for shareholders and community. That's all good to a degree, but he is just too optimistic almost to a point where he is a bullshitter. Talking about buying a large piece of land to turn it into a rance for his employees....????? Yeah Mark, great way to spend shareholder money. In the meantime all CRM is doing is dropping, dropping, dropping. Snowflake will reach $300 before CRM will, so that swap would not be a bad idea, and I'm strongly considering it. Slutman runs a company, MB runs a socail welfare comapny"
"If Benioff and other officers have been big sellers of CRM over past 2 months, why should I be a buyer when stock is sinking? Plenty of time to see if they become Buyers! Dont listen to their stooge Cramer!!!!"
Wow really selling off - nice
DO NOT BUY ANYTHING IN THIS BUBBLE! US Equity prices HAVE PEAKED! US indexes will FALL by 80%! $AMD $NVDA $SQ $SHOP $AMZN $AAPL $MU $FB $BABA $TWTR $TSLA $NFLX $ROKU $NKE $PFE $PYPL $CAT $IBM $MMM $INTC $TXN $PYPL $CSCO $TWLO $CRM $ADBE $SNAP $MSFT $GOOG $MCD $MA $T $V $BAC $DB $JPM $GS $GM $F
#$%$ is up with this stock? It has a fantastic quarter and yet it goes from 250 down to almost 200 and struggles to rebound throughout March?! Like this stock is easily worth 225+ this company is testing my patience with its performance the past 6months! CRM get your act together and improve your share price!!
"my AH prices isn't updating. Comforting to see positive comments like ""Bam!"" and ""Boom!"" tho."
Trees where shaking Fruits be fallin Ripe for the pickin’ Yet here we remainedStill up in treeBright as the sunRed as the dawn. Never had a treeLooked so goodWe clung to the .... branchesTaking that sunsFull warmth. We weren’t readyTo fall just yet.
Back on track guys...see you in 300
"Strong resistance at $229 - $230 range, once it breaks we will take off to test the new resistance at $240, and once that is broken we could easily reach $300 as more buying pressure will kick in....! Lets do it longs!"
"I know they've exited some of these investments, but Salesforce Ventures has, or has had, investments in BOX, DOCU, DBX, HUBS, NCNO, SNOW, and TWLO. Their stake in SNOW alone is now worth $522MM. They have invested in over 400 cloud based startups, an in each instance building synergy between CRM and the startup company. Very impressive, and sure to continue to pay dividends."
CEO working on IT solution to help deploy COVID vaccines to citizens.
Sorry why is this company trading at PE 153??
Read the chart ready for free fall
Why is Salesforce going down? This a great deal for both companies. CRM has gone done on past acquisitions only to break new highs. HOLD!!!
2 weeks ago $217 was support...now it’s major resistance. This will drop hard tomorrow...Barely held onto any gains today...Great position to short more right before the close...I was already heavy but this is too good to pass up on
Looks like CRM's $100 million dollar stake in Zoom (ZM) just went up 75%+
Analysts raise price targets and buy
"Sorry longs the tape IS SHOWING A $151 MONDAY OPENING, so that’s a big selloff. Once again shorts prosper on CRM"
Pretty amazing for one of the worse pieces of software I have ever used...
This guy is writing books instead of focusing on his company....now it's making sense why they needed a co CEO....geez....shareholders are paying for this playwright!!!
"Keep your eyes on the prize ..a trillion dollar company!! patience is a virtue just don’t sell and don’t even look at the daily price if you are a trader trying to guess the movement(no way you can) good luck to you Hold for years, let the good business do it’s thing"
Up on heavy volume. Continue to $255 tomorrow likely.
under 200 tomorrow and then 100 by end of month. awful earnings compared to any of the stocks i DOW or FAANG... worse than tesla...
$500 in 2 years!!!
If it breaks $226.57 I’m going long...total reversal from what I was doing but I see potential if and when it breaks and holds onto $226.57
Sell volume accelerating will drop below $150 today and looks likely will go under $115 by the end off the week
Does anyone think this is too expensive with a PE of over 100
High caution !It could be extremely down by tomorrow if Dow continue turning RED all the way through ....careful..Huge profits taking for sure.....
Short's CRM green that didn't take long.
buy SNOW on this deal....not CRM
"At the current price of crm of 231 after hours, deal is equal to $45.51 per share. At the close price of 241.35, deal is about $46.25. If crm stock goes higher, it's an extra 7.7 cents for every $1 of CRM share price added or lost, if CRM gets back to 267 where it was a week ago, price would be $48."
finally!!
Glad I sold after earnings. This stock always pops after earnings then melts away.
Maybe Benioff should worry about his stock vs commenting on FB.
Does anyone care to address all of that insider trading activity?
Will be 250 in 3 weeks
It will be 220 soon
"Cramer has been beating the drum about Salesforce the last 2 days. Whenever he does this about companies they wake up, just not right away. If he talks bad about a company they go up right away."
Cramer...........$CRM will push up a huge number of stocks if this call goes right
"Biden says: ""the era of investors capitalism should end"".......kidding right? Sounds like Bernie and sounds like Benioff. The transition for companies to work for the social good, period is new direction. No stocks, no cops, no wealth..........whats left? Free Bread and Cheese lines."
HERE WE GO $300 SOON YEAHH BABY AND GE GOING TO $30
Buy CRM. Most undervalued software stock.
Big money on crm!!! Lock and load. 180 target!! Way way undersold based on growth!!
52 Week Range 115.29 - 284.50
too early to get in tomorrow? I like this company
"This was just an easy money maker. Just buy on the dips for good quality stocks LOL. If you've worked with Salesforce Chatter before, it wasn't a success, so that's why they decided to buy Slack instead. They immediately have a product that works and experts that come with it. All they need to do now is integrate it to the Salesforce family, and sell it to their existing customer base. Their customers will try anything Salesforce offers."
Great day to announce the entry to Dow. That makes it a double pop right before and after earnings beat estimates buy a lot! i have been patiently waiting for my #3 Position to follow Apple and Nvidia up up up to the clouds!
"Less than 6 hrs left to board the rocket that blasts off after every ER for the last 3 years. If not the numbers, it's the story going forward. Firing on all cylinders, that's been confirmed."
MB has some loose screws. Beginning to worry me.
"I averaged up yesterday, which turned out to be a good move in the short term."
Nice action investors.
CRM will be fine long-term. Might go down further in the short term though
sold 400 shares and took a $3200 loss. Good luck to you all!! I hope you make money on CRM.
Are there any specific reasons for the earnings being much lower QoQ for the last two ER?
$210 targetup from $252 in Septembercompetition hugecontent cost way upstock up from $1 a share 10 years agotime for a correction to normalize the PE's with the competitionPE Disney around 22PE Apple around 22PE Netfix around 99$210 is actually very generous
"This is a solid company, but it's just way over valued.....the margins are terrible and now the billings are a disappointment when the cloud is booming...something just doesn't seem right and could be in for a decent size correction before moving up...."
Quarter one is going to bring this baby to $250
"Wonder where are Loop Capital folks now? Washing the egg off their face, perhaps?"
NO PUTS
Buying opportunity for this great company!!!
"OBLG or CPAH? OBLG Two things moving this today. $WORK being bought by $CRM announced by CNBC and formally PRd tomorrow (according to their source). The other is $ZM earnings... beat estimates but stock was up in anticipation. Also as I mentioned last week $CPAH is a sympathy play for $WORK buyout. See here how it competes with Slack Zoom Google hangouts etc... CPAH is a low floater: 6,411,407, insiders 55,5% (3,887,935)."
"HAH! i just put down 7k(100 shares) short position at $75.00easy money man, just got to pick the most overvalued stocks!"
Buy the dip
CRM reached an all time high at 189.27
Great earnings !!! But still dropping !!!!
Why invest in a company that doesn't earn money.
Showing lots of strength today...I’m impressed
I like it better than the IBM redhat acquisition. Much better.
"Beat and Beat.....slightly lower FY guidance. How this gets digested by the market/analysts we will see tomorrow. Hopefully on call CRM confirms Benioff's claim that it will double in 3 years.Of course initial response in AH we are down but see this reverses once call is done ""IF"" they talk down FY 2019 guidance and talk up 2020-2021."
"Good sign, It doesn’t want to close below 210."
Shorts getting hammered
"So uh....If you bought DATA shares which later become CRM shares when that happens who is better off....The person who bought DATA last Friday or, the person who bought CRM last Friday...?"
"Wow HUGE selloff Friday and then CRM got obliterated after hours, the tape is showing that Monday it may open around $49- WOW !!! Long are learning a lesson about the impact overpriced acquisitions have on a stock"
UP 20% YTD. More to come.
When do I buy in?
good grief what happened heredid they lower guidance
"CRM = $145 EOW, and possibly tomorrow. CRM did exactly what I said in below post, usual trend for CRM. GOOD LUCK ALL."
"Salesforce.Com BeatsSalesforce.Com (CRM) reported 3rd Quarter October 2017 earnings of $0.39 per share. The consensus earnings estimate was $0.37 per share on revenue of $2.7 billion.

slight delays can only mean one thing....
"Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) reported Q4 EPS of $0.70, $0.15 better than the analyst estimate of $0.55. Revenue for the quarter came in at $3.6 billion versus the consensus estimate of $3.56 billion.GUIDANCE:Salesforce sees Q1 2020 EPS of $0.60-$0.61, versus the consensus of $0.63. Salesforce sees Q1 2020 revenue of $3.67-3.68 billion, versus the consensus of $3.7 billion.Salesforce sees FY2020 EPS of $2.74-$2.76, versus the consensus of $2.75. Salesforce sees FY2020 revenue of $15.95-16.05 billion, versus the consensus of $15.99 billion."
"Once a company integrates Salesforce crm solution into their business they won't get rid of it, it is crucial for sales. However, if companies go out of business, they lose them. Most revenue comes from large corporations and they are on SaaS so revenues are repeating plus growing from new business. Great long term stock."
too high
Who’s is here for $500 by End of 2021... !!!
I guess it will close around 160What do you think gentlemen ?
Any moment now…
"Looks like someone tipped off the big money guys, traded over 17 million shares over triple normal volume.SEC should check this out! My guess is the CEO trying to help out the followers (MM) escape big loses, like hey guys our forward numbers are going to be below what we thought!!"
Buy it for under $200 after the earnings call.
hoping it will hold green today.
"Why are the key statistics except for gross profit, all listed N/A?"
"And the market always finishes positive in December. Vaccines are coming, this is an opportunity to add to any company you see at a discount."
Why does CRM issue so many shares every year for the last 10? That will be the scandal that brings this puppy down.
This is a great company with bright future. We should see $200.0 by end of the year!!!
Just market mindset for today. This will be buying op.
Cramer and Mark B are best buds... Cramer will be pounding the table for EVERYONE to BUY BUY BUY on tonights show!!!
Buckle up shorts. You are about to get toasted toda
Tomorrow will be huge
Free money now
Light guidance??
SO MANY 300 CALLS WOW
About time this dog hunted!
I am selling on the pop this morning. I will buy back on the dip later.
"I guess today is ""Sell your huge cloud winners"" Day !Yikes! haha, oh well. I am keeping mine, and may add more if they keep getting hit"
Benioff's socialist preaching is really offputting and directly contrary to the sorts of public statements a CEO should make.
CRM will go over $500 a share by the end of 2021.
"This better not break $220, if it does... YIKES"
"Congrats to CRM holders. Nice earnings report.Do your own DD, but BOX could follow suit with ER tomorrow after the bell."
"Benioff looks to be setting up for a political run in the future. Bashes FB, Google, Microsoft, doesnt he realize tech industry is where he plays. His stock is down big today for no apparent reason while he writes books, goes on TV and bashes other companies.....talk about off base focus."
https://www.gurufocus.com/news/996867/salesforcecom-inc-crm-chairman-of-the-board--coceo-marc-benioff-sold-16-million-of-shares
This is to remove weak hands. Huge buying opportunity!!!
Where was the optimism in the earnings? Numbers appeared pedestrian to me?
it's time to get in crm... they are hitting the same trend line for the 3rd time will buy calls on monday
Looks like enterprises are spending like crazy to upgrade their software.
$140 by Friday next week
I think we just broke through
"Sales force is replacing Exxon which has been in Dow Jones since 1928, that says oil companies aren’t future anymore"
Any idea why the out of money options market is down today? Typically it follows the market but weird behavior is the last 1 hour
"Just like today, this week its gonna be green, ending week on 190!"
"I ll add at 145 or less , but not before"
Buying opportunity!!! This is a great company!!!
"CRM now that they have fully integrated Tableau a data mining company should look at acquiring c3.ai, the recognized leader in ML and AI in America. With the data capacity that CRM has, if you combined that with the processing abilities of ML through an AI acquisition, it would easily place salesforce heads and shoulders over its competition."
By earnings crm will be back its highs. Love this stock.

Boom!
"For the last year this stock has consistently bounced off the 75 day moving average. Definitely gonna initiate a position next time that happens. As it stands, it’s $9 above it now."
Nice ending
"If CRM actually buys (I guess it would be a little more like a merger since they'd have to use a ton of stock), this will go to 60 in a day. Downside is 10, upside if the deal doesn't go through is about 3-4"
bought at 205 sold 207 .... really scared of this lol
$160 coming soon.
"Loading guy, never to late, it on its way back to $160 and than $200 by the end of the year..."
"This is a wonderful buying opportunity. CRM will stay flat through mid-December; then, we will see a rebound into early February. Look for CRM to potentially rebound to $260 level by February 1. Patience wins here......"
Does anyone know if the after hours data is right on CRM of being down 6%?
The action on this stockIs very similar to ELY stock and what happens in mid nov when they bought top golf.... drop 20% in the first few days then after the market took the time to understood the acquisition and growth potential it surged for 21 straight days.
Anyone know the date and time this will be back at 160?
It will open green
"Guidance down, growth via acquisition. Glad I got out before er."
This is will cause DOW to drop or stagnate. Big mistake to add money loser to DOW.
Love this deal!!!

see my Oct 250 call 4 fold tomorrow !
pre market not bolding well for tomorrow morning.. market cycling out of tech
Our CEO is deeply concerned about income inequality and the homelessness in San Fran.. He needs to donate more of his salary to solving the problem. He needs to recognize that San. Fran. homelessness problem is because of San Fran. destructive liberal policies concerning drugs. Influential guys like him will usher in socialism that the ignorant and poisoned minds of the younger generation want sooner than later..scary thought..
"Fantastic ER....great AH price!!! So where does CRM open tomorrow morning...I think we hit $143-$145 in morning trading, then it will slump a bit into the afternoon. By EOY we will see over $150. Thoughts?"
$CRM is eyeing WORK! Who is eyeing ACRX.... ?
Below 237-250$ . 2-3 days.. big sell-off coming.....
Nice note on CRM by Jim Cramer and the AAP Team today.
Will be solid green tomorrow. IMO.
Zack upgraded it to BUY.
Those who not selling in AH today could regrets by tomorrow market opening...better sell in premarket tomorrow before too late...
I bought Nov 30 call at $ 131. Will this triple tomorrow morning ?
"Bought a handful, will average cost buy. Cramer says to hold back a day or so, but FOMO on this pullback. If you like Cramer see my Facebook group, "" ACTION TRADERS""."
Seems like a good report wth
"Biggest mistake by Snake Oilman. Come baby, I need 100 points."
Another great quarter coming with all the online shopping in 4th quarter. Last quarter was unbelievable but investors did not like Slack acq.
Crm is the best of the best. Huge growth going forward and best growth of any other tech companies out there!! Big money 310 targets.
Stock seems stuck around the $226 area since the SLACK announcement. Any insight on investor day?
New highs in the near future 
PE way higher then msft ! Would I be better off buying Mr. Softy or CRM?
"Relax, for the week the shorts still won again...it’s like 6 weeks in a row. Give the longs a bit hope that makes the drop that much more satisfying. $180 still coming soon"
Great earnings but the move above 260.00 is all about the short squeeze. Beware of the falling knife...
Great performance today
"Be patient it will trade down today into 1 PM,"
Down 6+ after hours!!! Why?
Added on the dip.
Very strong
"Yes, this is definitely a buy the dip opportunity."
Buying more
"Salesforce sets a new long-term sales target at its annual investor day. It now aims to reach more than $50B in revenue in FY26 -- up from a pre-M&A target of up to $35B for FY24. The latest figure includes sales linked to Slack, which Salesforce has agreed to buy."

"CRM Salesforce upgraded to Conviction Buy (from Buy) with a $315 price target at Goldman SachsGoldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan added Salesforce to the firm's Conviction List and reiterates a Buy rating on the shares with a $315 price target, representing 49% upside. Microsoft and Salesforce as well positioned to capitalize on digital transformation spending, which will outpace overall IT budgets for the ""foreseeable future,"" Rangan tells investors in a research note. The analyst views both companies as well positioned to capitalize on digital transformation spending, which has been accelerated in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic."
Salesforce and Slack are one of the life sources why companies can stay operational during the pandemic. I think this stock is under valued. Enough said!
Moving up on low volume
"Those 190 Feb calls paying well now... now action in March 200 calls, so I am hoping for a little more move to that level."
Poised to take off. A stock you want to own
Be taking out the old high by Valentines Day
105 by Friday! $AMD $MU $AAPL $CRM $QCOM. 119 PT just today.
Long and strong
"Fading quickly time to take a short position guys! Can't break and stay above major resistance of $226.57, Excellent opportunity to make money when it drops back to $210"
There's a lot of risks associated with CRM. You're absolutely better off putting your hard earned money on bonds rather than buying this stock.
Anyone in ZI yet?
Sold my CRM shares. Acquisition Slack not good for shareholders.
Oversold buy now . Huge run waiting
next week on Wednesday 5/26 we get another earnings and more importantly a guidance which should emphasize acquisitions benefits.....looking for at least $240.
Under $225.00 by tomorrow...for sure....! don't be fooled in AH by manipulators....
"throw away 27,7 billion they need this like i need cancer again fuzxzk the stock holders rite..."
“A SpaceX rival backed by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and Salesforce's Marc Benioff plans to go public via SPAC”https://www.google.com/amp/s/markets.businessinsider.com/amp/news/astra-plans-to-go-public-via-merger-with-holicity-spac-2021-2-1030034071
"This will be green tomorrow. Especially after today's pull back. They always beat on EPS. So their guidance is $0.02 below consensus while they just beat $0.15 above consensus. Another words, they will far surpass consensus! This will be 2%-5% up tomorrow."
Buying more!!!
earnings are going to be a disaster
This has been a trend lately. Doesn’t matter how stellar ER is. SP takes a hit after report. It’s the hedgies driving the price down so they can load up before the run. This will rise slow but is a great long term hold.
"Speak to us, Benioff!!!"
Buy the dip. Going up huge!
Nope no recession here!
CRM is one of top pick of big institutional investors. It's going to go up in a hurry. Watch it. Blue skies coming.
"Up nearly 1% on a down day, I'll happily take it every day!"
i got confused with two different narrations....morningstar analysis report is saying 253 is fair value and gave 4 stars..yahoo fair value is showing it is already overvalued...
"Sunday night 10 pm MSNBC show about how Salesforce is changing the world, better buy while it’s still low."
Short the stock. Looks like it will fill the Gap at $142-$144 range. Then Cover and Buy for good Long position to new highs afterwards.
Why is the aftermarket price so volatile? It jumps between -3% and -0.2% in a matter of seconds. Or is it a bug?
Wow rejected for the 5th time in 2 weeks at $229. Amazing
Glad i bought more in the dip. CRM will show the market who is king. Just wait for the results this quarter and the quarter after that and so on.
"Lol lot of shorts crying here with negative comments , salesforce, amazon and adobe are the best stocks to own"
"Wow, I started investing in $HUBS a year ago. It was between this or $CRM. Glad I made the right choice..."
Wouldn't surprise me if CRM finished in the green today.
"It’s a good day, even if it closes at 232-33 today."
Crazy growth
The trolls are back on board again ignoring the fact that today's drop is not only applicable to CRM.
Bought more. Way oversold
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNCLE!!!!!! How's that $180 PT working out for you? It can't even break below $220!!!!
It is soaring!
https://seekingalpha.com/news/3608880-salesforce-price-targets-raised-after-monster-beat-and-raise
"Keep the world selling & buying......#ZM, #DOCU & #CRMThe disruptions of 2020 are changing the way buyers buys and how sellers sell. Video calls, AI-chat, remote agreements, electronic notary and enhanced CRM tools give unprecedented access to meetings with decision makers and the ability to get business done from anywhere, but they also make the sales process even more competitive."
congratz guys! what would be a good pricing to enter?
I see 223 settle.
"So sad that there was nothing of substance during the interview, just an explanation of news revealed pre market about covid vaccine distribution assistance. Still bullish but with no catalyst it’s gonna be a longer time frame when moving up"
"""There is nothing stopping CRM from becoming as large as any IT company"" - I said it in 2000 and it's still true. Strictly as a trading call, it's up 50% in a year to new alltime highs. If we get another 5%, I will sell some and re-buy lower, or, write calls. It's priced for huge continued growth. There is a lot of room to reduce costs and increase margins, but that's not how it got to this point, and I doubt we will see MB go in that direction. The world is catching up though. And, there are only a few more niches the existing strategy can conquer. As competitors catch up on features and reliability, price competition will come at last. And, the ""next big thing"" isn't known, by definition, but it's likely to be different than what Salesforce sells now. I am changing my tune after thirty+ years of Buy: At these levels, for long-term investors, Salesforce is a hold."
Aquired for $225/share
All tech up big today and CRM is only up 1.36%.It has a long way to go before we see 52 week highs again. Anyone adding?
"Just went Long 100 shares of CRM at $160.70. Stock looks solid, been trending up all day despite the very bad overall market atmosphere. This is an Earnings play, I expect beats on EPS and Revenue, along with positive guidance, to drive this baby up to around the $170 level. Was planning to buy much more than 100 shares, but due to evolving market circumstances, my available capital is limited. Right now I am in another Earnings play, 2000 shares of GIII at $29.45, and that is tying up my capital. Makes no sense for me to see shares of GIII at a loss, in order to get into CRM, because I think GIII has an even stronger likelihood of popping up big-time after it's earnings report."
CRM has been sleeping the last 6 months but is going to awake soon. bullish.
"Don't panic guys, we're only down about a dollar. Investor Day begins at 1:30 ET, so hopefully we see upward movement in the afternoon and for the rest of the week."
I think we are losing Mario...
Forgot sleepy CRM Buy Slack
Do not panic. Hold on to your shares. This will pass and CRM will flourish again.
"Dont get trapped, CRM is not going to continue to go high - Volume is going to go low and low ....its coming down tomorrow .... below 270 and further down as market corrects!!"
"Just listened to the MB CNBC interview. I didn’t find the sentiment of the conversation anti-shareholder at all (like the view that’s been shared by some on here). In fact, I found it positive. Don’t know what all the fuss is about TBH."
165 today.
$170+ after ER
"loaded up on january 15 $270 calls, this is a fire sale"
Current quarters billings way off!!!
Salesforce investor day starts tomorrow at 1:30 ET. I’d expect a slight downturn in the morning but a strong finish in the afternoon. Hopefully we’re green all day and break $230!

Gr8 price
CRM leading the way with the covid 19 passport.
"If anyone is wondering, the acquisition is supposed to close in the 2nd Quarter of 2021."
The best deal out there.
The rise has started
long. THis would be the right day to buy
Not gonna lie. This is beginning to look very attractive now...
Tipranks CRM low=234; average 282; high 320. That's one function I like about Tipranks; it tells me where to buy.
Bet it’s up another 4 tomorrow!
STRONG BUY
We close 116 margin selling done?
Been holding this for over 2 months now seeing it go from 150 to 165 to the 50s again and again. No matter what long term this is a buy and I do think earnings will boost it beyond its cap but man is it taking its time. I can’t see why it hasn’t been advancing
How long until this company reports GAAP profit? Huge misapplication of $100B.
in my experience companies that are down b4 earnings report if the have a good quarter they go up a lot if they have a strong quarter this stock could hit 160

Oversold. Im loading up. $300 end of the year. Im sure about it
Keep climbing!
Who's looking forward to the multiple daily Uncle short attack posts? As if posting on YMB is going to make a difference in share price on a large cap stock like this...lmao.
going to 250 in short time!
I’m sweating
sorry- it's down bc i bought in last week- shorts! get going- i generally bring a 20-40% drop!
Wish I bought this in 2017. C'est la vie.
Rigged game
Taking some position in CRM after 2% discount this week.
"It looks like a great buying opportunity here, as both MSFT and AMZN earnings reports indicated cloud adoption has been exceptionally strong."
bullish 300
Salesforce is building many towers now San Francisco. The company is growing very fast
Strong Buy https://cweb.com/2018/03/05/salesforce-the-cloud-monster-that-continues-growing-cweb-com/
"buy now, right at 50 DMV"
20 percent gain minimum from here . In next 6 months will reach new 52 week high ....
Wait for the boom
"GAAP earnings for the first half of 85 cents, including 43 cents of investment earnings (mark to market on venture capital/equity investments) and 18 cents for tax valuation adjustments related to Mulesoft acquisition. Thus, operating earnings of 24 cents for the first half. Projecting reported 99 cents for the year, including 1-2 cents in 3Q and 12-13 cents in 4Q. Without the investments and tax one-time items, GAAP EPS projection FY 19 of $0.39. Just providing some facts if you're wondering why it may go down tomorrow."
CRM + ZI a match made in heaven.
Purchased the stock at 222 in addition to the January 230 calls. A little disappointed this week I think I would knock it out of the box with the 230's
It will back up to $160 today.... hold your chair guy...
"wow misread that one bought before earnings at 126 sold at 131.50, sold too soon it was teetering, got stage frifgr locked in my easy 3% n change. figured id take the gains, then boom up she goes oh well easy 20 minute money, free shares ill take it"
"For what it’s worth, Call volume nearly double the Puts."
"Shorts are punching at air. It beat.. Would not be surprised if by early next week this is at 115+.. Same song most quarters, everyone looking to nitpick and it still moves up.."
Marc Benioff. Professional winner.
"all good, diamond hands. great report."
Tech wreck day! All recent winners - and CRM - are way down. The technicals are dismal for CRM. Bought more at 68.28. Is this all about the FMR filing that they sold 0.69% of their holdings? Perhaps they sold more since then. Short-interest numbers will be interesting.
"52 week low is $113 and this BAD DEAL will push price below that, sorry longs - next time don’t invest in bad management"
Price makers are letting it dip before buying in. Exciting stuff 
Where can I find earning report immediately after release?
100 forward PE equals stock price of $67.
MB is on the call they got the whole team 
Please understand that when you short you are just looking for a short term profit. CRM will be back in play on the long side soon as profits will continue.
"I am a buyer at 100. Any seller? : ) Patience is key in this game. I waited a long, long time to find an entry point, and it's finally coming."
"all buy ratings this morning, looks like its time to buy"
It quickly flirted with the 52 week high today. I fell confident it'll breakthrough early next week. Good luck to all!
"Goldman Sach's analyst Kash Rangan, raised Salesforce's (CRM) target price to $315. See Yahoo article below."
MB must have taken the day off
This is a new era for this stock. It’s not gonna drop
Hope my 12/18 225$ calls are safe
CRM earning surprise of 132% - earning growth 190%
They're giving it away! Bought some at 73.13
"SHOULD I BE CONCERNED? Over the past 4 weeks, Benioff, in 10 different transactions, has sold over 12million shares. Makes me nervous. Seems like there is a lot of hype about CRM lately... Comments please - calm me down..."
Crm amazon zoom baba are lockdown stocks they go up when the market goes down just like crm not rising with the market.
Long and strong. Think in years.
"Been watching CRM for quite a while now, yesterday the door opened just a crack and I kicked it open, start a position in CRM yesterday and couldn't be happier."
"Wow all the after hours sales are massively negative to the closing price, better get out now longs tomorrow is going to be ugly for longs"
"Well I added 87 more shares at the close , probably go down tomorrow, that’s the norm for me always goes lower after I buy"
the new price targets tell you that you will literally be sitting here for a year with no growth and possibly negative growth
".18 tax benefit from acquisition....take that out and again very close to, or less than estimates..."
231 could the forever ath for crm
"A true great company, number one in CRM software + a good company Tableau. It will be a great future. $200 could come by end of this year."
"Buy, Buy, buy on any dips."
Next stop for CRM: $215
Any thoughts on 3:42pm?
Do we get to $180 over the next several days? I would love to add more there.
$CRM is potentially reacting to $NOW earnings results
"I hold a position in CRM, and I want to buy more. For you, is it a good entry point ?"
A close above 250 pls.
Wife is asking for divorce because she told me to buy 1000 sh of CRM when it was about $170...
Incredible buying opportunity on some of these stocks. Covid coming back big time and massive Q3 numbers incoming. Get back into tech and buy the dip!! Expect a big rebound next week!!
300 in weeks or sooner
I guess analysts price targets will be coming down sharply.
Confident with CRM.
"Hello, sold my slack to join the CRM family. How are you!!! "
Owning CRM is like having an ATM in my kitchen
CRM is over paying for slack because their growth is slowing
If someone buys now at 230 then they will do big mistake
the third quarter EPS cut was interesting check it out
Mark cuban said ethereum can replace saas $now $crm
"Annnnd I’m back in! Sold out for a profit near $230, been waiting to see this $216 shelf to get back in. Good luck, everyone!"
"Clearly Marc wants something like Zoom on CRM platform and Slack is that adding. He's been saying ""the past is gone"". Not sure if that's true when the vaccine is finally lay its results on the ground. But to me, Slack is very good company and growing, just think that it's overvalued for the stock. Hope CRM makes the right move."
"CRM brilliant $work buy, CRAMER said CRM will double... Read the ACRX press release out this moring, game changer yet ACRX under the radar... long $snow $zm $docu too all game changers"
Sold WORK and bought CRM. No brainer at this price
Ignore the shorts who try and bash CRM. They just want to scare people into selling or not buying because they make their money if the price goes down. They are about to lose badly because this has much more upward potential from this point forward. Good luck all!
Anyone knows When is the next earnings?
I WOULD BUY CRM THIS IS DISCOUNT BUY IT BUY GUYS AFTER HOURS DONT LET THEM FOOL U
What is the date CRM will be added to the DOW?
Straight steady March to $200
"CRM Hugely Crushed Earnings and now ... it's down after hours. I am calling a top. Its up hugely in past three months, time for a breather."
Let’s book profit
$CRM  Estimated Share Price Target For Q4 2019 After-Earnings: $174.44 Low: $130.07 Mean: $165.06 High: $200.06https://aicody.com/articles/stocks/salesforce-com-inc-software-and-it-services-stock-analysis-rating-2018-forecast-6fbe8f43f0d693a5/
I really don’t like the way so many CEO’s now give low guidance. We all know why.
Market strength continue tomorrow will bring CRM back to above $245 ...
We should at least see $200 this week...4% drop isn’t too much vs all the other weeks when it has crashed during the market run up.
Finally get the love this company deserves!!!
There were countless talking heads on CNBC pounding the table on this stock after earnings. This is a healthy consolidation before a 4th Q move to 165.
check all of the price Target updates and you will be surprised that the price set today and 3 days ago is actually lower than where it is now
we can rest assured that earnings will be great. I think exceptionally great. Where is it gonna go...who knows... it's a long term hold with 300$+ potential is what you really need to know though.
Blue Horseshoe loves Salesforce
"As of today, all four of CRM's top shareholders have now filed their year-end holdings with the SEC. They are the cream of the crop - Blackrock, Vanguard, Fidelity and T. Row Price. Together they own 28% of the shares. That's quite a positive signal for us long-term holders."
"The drop to fair value has a long way to go yet folks, see you at $80 a share. Those of you who forget what a correction looks like, look out. This stock has been over-valued, hyped, for quite some time. Don't catch a falling knife."
BOA says BUY BUY BUY!!!!
"Thought everyone who wanted out of crm had gotten out. Not much volume, I see. Maybe this will be over by the end of the day."
SunTrust Analysts Lifts Salesforce's Price Target to $195
"So the deal was known since last week, so why is this the reaction now?"
This is hugely overvalued. One earnings report doesn't justify that increase.Its another pump and dump to take Robinhood traders money...Lock in your profit while you have it before the institutions take it from you.
"As Slack investor, I think all you folks complaining about how CRM has been performing is pretty funny...Slack was a rollercoaster of mostly red on green days and really red on red days. But the product is set to revolutionize how people work and how businesses get the actual ""business"" done. Its not a Covid play; its not a work from home product. People integrate their business processes INTO Slack and use it as a tool to get their product created, not just ""send memes to their friends."" I just bought into CRM today as I know its a discount right now and I know that Salesforce adding Slack to its offerings is going to be a HUGE game changer for Slacks' exposure in the enterprise platform. Its going to be an exciting next few years and I can't wait to talk about it with all you folks. Cheers to the longs!"
I believe earnings will be fantastic for Salesforce only because they wouldn't be making this deal if they weren't there report Tuesday I'm sure they will beat and would probably rally the 270-275 if they weren't buying slack I'm still looking for something about to 265
$250 by earnings easily
Looks like it is breaking out of its range!!
Well I don’t really care what happens at this point. Sold my PUTS for 30% profit as predicted. Thank you and good luck to the shorts and longs.
https://s1.q4cdn.com/454432842/files/doc_financials/2019/q4/CRM-Q4-FY19-Earnings-Press-Release-w-financials.pdf
Yeah this week will be green
These guys have been and will continue crushing it.
you are getting a better more comprehensive competitive co going forward. wall street will reward it because they like marc.
"Predictions are worthless. That said, if the Market holds up I could see a run too 300 into the next earnings..."
Firday is going to be a good day!!
I bought lots of $300 calls! Here we go...
Beat on top.Beat on bottomRaised 2019 guidance
Up we go!
"Major buy before earnings! Can't believe it's down today, ill take this gift."
CRM is up 4.90% to 121.95
Can't trust a CEO who uses the term 're-architect the company'.
"If I ever get even , I am outta here , after watching the interview, I have come to the conclusion that I just don’t like the guy ! I will find me something better to invest in"
Thank you Mr. Market. I'll take however it comes...Best quarter ever--during covid pandemic 100yr event is amazing! Like magic they generate revenues. BOL :)
Always the morning sell off. I'm hoping we can break 235 today. Can we get on good gap? It seems time for a gap up.
"Never a good idea to allow exuberance and zeal to interfere with straight forward reporting of news guys. Don't be that guy. Ark bought 101,500 shares of CRM today and didn't have a prior open position. I've seen some exaggerating over this. It's cool, and Ark rarely, if ever, makes just one buy. So they'll likely continue but let's keep it 100."
Just OK. Please check out my youtube video for my valuation of CRM here -> https://youtu.be/mSrW6SlFpDo

"All the nonsense today held CRM from making its highs........understand that CRM just reported terrific numbers and gave strong guidance. Recent acquisitions yet to be fully integrated and yet to add great value to clients and internal synergies. The gains from the ER is stymied for a day or maybe even Monday, but this will turn around next week. WE will get back to $158 and then break into $160's. DO NOT SELL your shares and if goes under $150 buy more.....soon to recoup ER gains and more!"
guys crm or twlo?
Wow. And people didn’t see this coming?
Buy VEEV to capitalize on the CRM rush.
Shorts are creating a buying opportunity; squeeze coming in a couple of weeks. CRM is for longs!
I will sell part of my FAZ position and short CRM before close
When does CRM report ER after or before the bell tomorrow
No worries at all with Salesforce
And here come the margin calls!
"Go ahead and short CRM down to 150 or so, I want to buy more shares D. Don't think you stand a chance, too much support now between 150 and 154. Good luck or you are useless with your empty promises."
I will take 120
Absolutely ramping into close. Strength is being displayed right now. Possible push over ATH before the bell. Major reversal today translates to more gains ahead.
Can’t move up...unreal. Weeks and weeks of trading around $220. Can’t break out at all...hard rejection every single time
is the selling over????
"I am going to try to add to my CRM position at the market close, because this thing can go red .....or near it !"
"Question is, when does this turn the corner? What is the catalyst?"
Here for the long term
Just wait folks. This stock will make you a lot of money of you just have patience!
"So the question is when do we jump back in? We all know the markets are in a correction, was hoping that AMZN & GOOG would right the ship. After hours tells a different story, everything’s down. Ideally, everything sells off big time in the morning just to finish positive on what could have been another Black Friday, the correction is over and we capitulate. I’ve been buying this dip. Long, $TTD, $SQ, $ROKU, $CRM and the $275 11/16 NVDA calls."
Buy opportunity...$200 within 2 weeks...
Time to roll one up fam
resistance 200$ looks like we stuck in here for long long term
CRM reached an all time high at 183.70
Save your money and sell ASAP buy it back low to mid 140s next week
This stock is very difficult to short especially trading within same range everyday.
Millions of investors / Hedge Fund will jump in to BUY CRM dip today ...
It's definitely building a strong base at this price point. And it's trying hard to breakthrough. Hope the coming weeks building up to dreamforce pushes it to new highs! Good luck all!
It's all baked in. Expects downturn tomorrow.
For Mario’s sake I hope there’s more stimulus. His put are going to be worthless when this thing rockets higher.
PE of 134 and a market cap over 140 billion. Destined to fail.
The entire market is in a rut right now. Once the short-war ends it may normalize. I'm thinking the rest of the week is going to be a roller coaster ride...
200 easy by the end of the year
may reset at 154-155
Anybody know why this stock tanked today? The last four quarters have been terrific.
"I don’t have any shares in this, but congratulations to all the shareholders!!!$150 is the least you will dee tomorrow."
All it took was someone to downgrade technology and it snowballed. Didn’t expect this after the recent sp dump.
This has strong potential
goes out negative for the day thanks trump
So if it beat both estimates why is the stock going down and not up?
Good numbers. Slow forecast ...Buy Dec 105 puts ahead of the announcement.
Who else loaded up at 202 yesterday? 
great deal! buy now on the dip!
I am fixing to go all in short tomorrow and it looks to me like it’s going to be a slaughterhouse tomorrow in CRM
Why CRM so sluggish?
Argus Research now has a Buy rating and a 180 pt
Just add more shorts @155.40. Still got 5 more points down in the next day or 2.
Going up today. Another hold target moved to outperform.
"In my opion, ""D"" is probably paid to keep knocing CRM down so the company who pays him, can pick up more shares on the cheap. Once they get enough, then CRM will resume its march higher."
wow...did not expect it to drop that much
Great time to buy!?!
I think I will grab some popcorn and a good beer and listen to the callWe won't be moving up or down big for a little bit. Just see what they are forecasting going forward. If the forecast is good we will see a bump and probably pull back half before going anywhere. Longs enjoy the pessimists for they will eventually fall.
HIGH ALERT !POWELL 'S SPEECH TOMORROW COULD DAMPEN THE STOCKS MARKET AS SAME LAST WEEK....PROBABLY DOW JONES COULD DROP -$400.00 BY TOMORROW....
Frim still falling will be red soon as most tech stocks rising
CRM is the king of clouds.
Bull when others are bear. Always holds true for a great company. CRM is estimated to grow by 14% YoY conservative for the next 5 years. They will certainly beat that

Look at the press release they just issued. I dont get it. Conf call in 40 minutes to explain.
CRM bought WORK is a longterm stratagy and should be understood. Salesforce needs a custom basis for future development to complete with MSFT and to reach the 50 B goal in the next few years. Buying WORK is not an option but for its own survive. I bet on CRM and predict that it could go up to $300 in 2022.
I guess I’ll hold . Lol
Going to be an amaaazing day today...
CRM is going to 500 and the company literally prints money.
Watch the fight back from CRM tomorrow. This stock has a lot of moxie.
Don’t invest your hard earned money on this stock instead buy bonds.
CFRA maintains STRONG BUY rating but trims target to $295. Bank of America maintains 12 month objective @$275
$300 within 3 months. Disagree? Tell me why
"The PE is justified based on their incredible growth rate. If the stock price does not go higher, that PE will come down quickly after a couple of 2019 earnings reports."
"So without Tableau's 300 million contribution, revenue would be up 22% next quarter instead of 31%?"
"CRM had amazing numbers on their earnings, the stock will not stay low and i am looking at $250 before investor day on Dec 08 and all time highs going into new year. I am not a gambler and i am going to keep adding on any dips and add to my long term portfolio, shorts or haters can't make me sell my shares. Good luck to all!"
just bought some CRM first time. I like the acquisition and I think Benioff is a great CEO. good luck longs
Looks like it has bottomed at 220
Almost there. $2 more and we will hit 200MA and bounce off. I predict that it will gap down to 200ma and than will bounce upwards
Waiting for 210.00-215.00
We will see $170 before earnings. Then a BIG BEAT and positive message and we are at $190.
up!
why is this dropping? meant to be around 200 surely!
today's dip was a gift
Great entry price .. will be 240 by April
It should go up 15% easily
"This is way oversold, expect a nice bounce in the next week. Daily RSI at 30..."
Buy now
SUCH A BUY!! 230 any day
what going on? ...Selling CRM and buying ZI.
I would assume after this huge drop in the market .. the companies that bear earnings by a significant amount would be the best buyers like this stock.. i hope it goes up from here i just bought with that ideology
There is a very good news from CRM still this stock is not moving . What is going on ?
Bernie the man. I heard rumor he coming on CNBC tomorrow. Anyone hear this too. He’s the man. Speaks great and lots of confidence!!
This stock has a long way down to go - 12B revenue for a market cap of 107B??? This is not sustainable. Run for cover folks.
"CRM is a business.....they are in it to make money......if they have more than enough people to accomplish their business goals, they should be able to get rid of the extra people they don't need. It does not matter how much money they make and how well their stock is doing......the number of employees they have should be up to them and no one else...."
"Thank goodness for the mute button, that D person is gone. He is a real wacko. I believe he is short and panicking."
Great interview with Block on Mad Money.
Whoa what is happening here?
$120 would be a high but acceptable price for this security. Don't expect Alphabet to bid any more than that.

Muted uncle.
There are dozens of credible analysts with buy and strong buy ratings on CRM.
I am thinking about investing in this stock for long term 1-2 years what is your suggestion
Money well spent on. MetallicaCulture is the key to unlocking cash vault!If this pulls back nobody can buy any shares because I will buy them all
I have 270 shares of this and I need help.
"Really thought there'd be signs of some recovery through the weekend after the beating it took. Even with price target upgrades and Cramer pushing it, it's still dumping premarket. Very frustrating."
"Sounds like CEO now wants to provide money to Time so they can do ""investigative reporting"" on Trump and TIME will give him a sound board to express his progressive views."
Market is overheated
"Sold my $135 call yesterday before close as it looked like the stock was going nowhere...let that be a lesson, I usually hold on and watch the Theta kill my options but this time I made a profit and boom"
This is one of the best stocks for this year. We’ve had week upon week of gains and 2 days we have a small drop because of silly shorters. Its all good
Another down day again. Regretted buying this.
Holding strong at 175 hereafter hours - Buyer sitting there?
"Market is shook right now. This can go either way, no matter how the earnings play out."
cc starting
yeah baby buy buy buy going higher
I got 5 contract at 1.80 CALL 227.5 exp 8/28 cost me a little bit over 800 lolz not a bad little investment
all the analyst upgrade CRM by the nice earning result. Changing CEO might impact shortly
"I haven't heard a single analyst who covers this stock, not any talking head on TV question whether Slack was a good idea. The only argument is price. And I'll certainly side with the guys in the know at C level to determine that."
"There is some value still in this stock, I will buy when it reaches $160-160.50 later today- could dip as low as $159 at the close"
$CRM and $WORK.....
"Timing is everything. If you bought it a year ago or at the end of the year, you would still be loving the stock.If you bought at other times in the last 52 weeks, you are probably frustrated with it."
1. Overall bear market across the board especially with tech. 2. Concerns with Chinese spies 3. Can't believe this was at all time high $161 per share a week ago.
This stock is amazing!! Pure power growth.
"What are babies talking about. I have $3M in this stock I was down a lot but now up a little bit. The market is getting use to the acquisition. I am waiting until earnings and sell most of my shares and keep a couple thousand as a core position. We like will have a few more down days before moving upward. Everybody wants a 20% return. Soon people will expect a stock to double in a day. Welcome to monetary easing where bubbles are born. Relax, this is an awesome company."
"pretty solid results, also usually guide conservatively."
I have yet to see a greater stock
CRM heading back to test the 200 day
"I wish CRM could have not bought DATA until I sold CRM for a decent profit.....Now, it's trading water....Maybe, i'll put the CRM money into more MSFT or, CSCO..."
They just announced global layoffs too. Making money on some one else misery...
"People, this is down due to its presence in tech ETFS which contain chip stocks. Also from CHEWY IPO."
$CRM Nord downgrades to Holdwww.stocktargetadvisor.com/blog/salesforcecrmnye-was-downgraded-by-nordlb-to-hold-from-buy/
"Started a small position, I’ve used their products. Definitely the best"
$210 tomorrow :)
here it comes!!! ready to go back up
"the ceo is a typical liberal hypocrite! giving employees a couple of months to try to find another job internally, but if not then there is the door. Why not just float some more shares and let them chill out & act like they are working? why doesn't the ceo just cut a personal check to support these soon to be ex employees?.. this guy chalks it up to ""running a business"", but i say its ""do as i day, not as i do!""""In 2019, Benioff courted attention for asserting that “capitalism is dead” and calling for a new form of capitalism that rejects “Milton Friedman capitalism, that’s just about making money,” in favor of capitalism that focuses on “the social good” and “stakeholders instead of shareholders.” [6] He has called his business philosophy “a millennial view of the world. Millennials want meaning in work. They want to feel like they improve the state of the world."""
"Should be in the 280’s based on other stocks, but I’m happy it made a significant rise today."
I'm curious who want to overload at cheap prices and they drop all the tech stocks so low last months very strange  there is no real reason for tech stocks to sink like that
CRM long term hold $
Jim cramer says Salesforce stock can more than double  Hope he is right
Buy before it goes to 270 next week
Weak hands getting flushed out then the rise starts
Wow!! That support at 140 is super strong. Easy 150s. Money in the bank.
"To all those who called me wrong yesterday, apologize NOW and take your loss - just to show there is no hard feelings, here is some advice for longs- sell it all and short it down to $113 the 52 week low - you are welcome"
"I just read that CRM is a ""perfect 10"" stock suggesting a buy now. P/E TTM of 110 + S/P of 8.92 a ""Perfect 10""???? I don't think so."
Tesla is overvalued to. That doesn’t mean anything. Shorts will get burned yet again in this market!
If I bought at $75 and it's now $147 should I sell half and take my profits? Or hold and see where it goes?
"Patience Patience guys just give it three weeks from the day it went down to 220 and it will recover￼, It’s always does"
Is 258 a good entry?
"As I predicted, 218 gap has been filled, however today’s low will be retested before this goes any higher"
$175 by Wednesday
Crawling back up to 260$
The daily chart for CRM looks amazing. I think this stock that I'm new to for the first time as of 10 minutes ago is about to take off to the upside if charts are any indicator
Back to $165. A great company with bright future!!! Some investors just don't understand what CRM CEO is doing.
Congrats to longs today. Those were shockingly great numbers reported. They have a bright future
Crm 129s after hours!!! Gooo goo! Way oversold.
Earnings will blow ya hat off!
strong earnings beat
Once we broke that $220 support this stock is in trouble short term.
Ugggghhhhhhh. I put way too much money into this #$%$
Will open red! You were warned
"Better load up while you can, zoom reversed with a 20+ move, you dont want to miss it"
what you people seem to not understand is that without CRM milions of other business can not function in todays world :) this is new reality
"Another choppy day, but it won’t matter if we end green. Vaccine approval and a stimulus Bill will send not only $CRM up but the entire market as well. HOLD!"
Big time beat. Q2 EPS $1.44 vs. St. Estimate of $0.67
Short squeeze today. This will head up nicely by close today I believe. Good luck all!
Going up today :)
"Market needs correction for all the stocks. everything is so costly. Even though crm is not one among them, it will go on that flow"
CRM reached a new All Time High at 127.24

Falling bigly everyday
A LOT OF UPGRADES for CRM:https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/CRM/price-target/
looks like it will bounce back down at 235....
CRM will not disappoint. I am looking for $155 after hours. Guidance will be especially good. GLTA!
Ho Ho Ho. Merry Christmas!
Way oversold.
Today’s big vol of accumulating is for the surge tmr!
In sept. 2020 one of Salesforce’s strategic investments completed its IPO resulting in an unrealized gain of $1.1 Billion for the months ended Oct. 2020. CRM made 1billion on an IPO ...
Fidelity's 12% stake means this will hold up.
Where is that db who called 140?
it's run from 111 in mid Feb what more do you want
"$CRM Huge block trade at 12:28 pm for 459,000 shares at 219.71 and all the institutions and private equity like i said are buying it up at the retail investors expense. Buy only and do not sell because the big equity has to show they own this as well going into the new year for stocks. Bought more 218.77 Bullish"
CRM was 260 when the SLACK acquisition was rumored. Stock got slammed to 248. Trailed again on more speculation. Now we hit the high 220's pre market. That's about $27 Billion in market cap or what they paid for Slack. They are pricing an asset as if it is worthless. For traders this will revert back tot he mean and run back to $245. After that it will eventually grind higher over time.
CRM to start small divided in q4 ? 5cents this year ? Dec record date for January payment? 2:1 stock split coming. would broaden stock
i will buy more if it go to test the 200 level https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbApr-KRjdY&t=34s&ab_channel=ARMYOFSTOCKS
"I was waiting for $135 to buy, but, I'll take it at $137"
there is no growth in layoffs
How many longs here have actually used the software?
The good news is the P/E is down to a minuscule 138+. Time for a visit to Mad Money. Fabulous.
so they didn't beat earnings.
This market is fixed I swear to god
Not looking good. We can not find a bottom. :( this may drop to 215 now
WOW how low can we go????
"To all those that shorted CRM earlier this morning........haha, Brilliant !"
128s to 132 in minutes!!! Strong bounce!!!!!! Goo gooo
i will be buying when momentum starts shifting green.
Jim Cramer will save us all
HP earned $1.2B in the quarter and it’s worth $28B and CRM...?
"It is a little concerning that Coin is about flat and other crypto assets(Mara, Riot, etc) are much higher.Maybe the CEO selling stock on first day has put a damper on the stock. Coinbase has huge potential in my opinion But not for the faint of heartBut I guess we will see over the next few years"
When is the Earnings report coming out? What time?
"Thoughts tomorrow on if $CRM will make the offer for WORK?also keep your eyes on ACRX in the days ahead, buyout buzz on AcelRx, with either PFE or MRK eyeing.."
Benioff must like something as he’s appearing on mad money tonight. They blew out top and bottom. And their Q1 guidance was insignificantly lower. As always from the people who don’t make money
Add more today! The best bread!
I had to use salesforce.com at a previous job. it was horrible. I can only imagine the reason this company has been successful is because they give kickbacks to executives who bring it to their company. I can think of no other reason. Everyone hated using it. we spent more time updating it then doing our jobs. People who just input false information to satisfy quotas.
"I used to post on this board a lot, but not hardly at all recently, as I have not been doing much with CRM..Not likely that anyone cares, but, I thought I would post a trade I did today on CRM: I bought 10 of the June 1 expiry 125 calls @5.40 per. Thought about not spreading but did to reduce my cost in case I was wrong on the trade. Sold 10 of the same expiry 135 calls @1.34 per. I did the trade ~1230EDT when the stock was ~127.50. I may buy back half or all of the sold calls tomorrow if we see some continued strength. I have every intention of selling these running into ER when the option IV is higher. Was ~3.5% when I initiated the trade. ER is targeted for 5/29. I will be out in a week or so if it goes my way. Without question a day or two before ER. Then I will look to get back in a few days after ER and trade the trend. GLTA !"
"$CRM is an overhyped stock. It has made two very expensive acquisitions (Tableau and Slack) within a short period of time. What bothered me is that I didn’t see much synergy between Salesforce’s core business and its acquisitions. What is the ROCE on these acquisitions? How much is the core business growing? Stocks like CRM, AMZN and AAPL have been causing a frothy tech market."
Lots of bathers saying they overpaid for Slack. Well I'm gonna trust their decisions.......look at a 5 year chart.
"Softbank buys $4 billion worth of call options in the last 90 days, all tech.Isn't this manipulation?? $tsla $crm $roku $fb $ixic"
Filled the gap of 8/25. Hopefully higher from here
What is happening?!
I tried to warn you guys...stock is getting walked down prior to earnings...the street is starting to realize that this model is not worth the high multiple that's being pegged to this stock...true value of this company is about 60% of the stock price...expect a 5 to 10% additional drop after earnings....my predictions is about $133 when the dust settles after reported earnings....just my humble opinion....
This says it all (good read). Looks like stock is going lower: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/earnings/buy-the-dip-salesforce-stock-earnings
Lol I should have sold a strangle.. congrats to those who did. worked perfectly
https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/05/17/salesforce_database_outage/
will fall to $75 and then I'll buy
155 or 156 in the coming days?Is there a probability for that?
CRM closes at $143.62 today- don’t worry it’s still way overpriced so sell it all longs and short - but only listen to me if you want to make money
"CRM shorts better close their short positions soon, as this is about to head back up from here I believe and you will just begin to lose more and more of any gains you made. Time to reverse course and go long. Buy shares or buy calls are the only smart moves here now!"
Closing right close to its high too. On to $200 amigos!
Just bought 200 shares this morning at $219.90...Let's go Longs..

"Dang. We’re about to touch the 200 dma. If it doesn’t bounce tomorrow, I may need to cash in some chips."
30 Down components. Which one do I own? The only one down of course
"I’m blown away by how good this ER looks! I don’t care if Wall Street has lost its mind, I’m sure they will all find it soon. In a world where a company like this loses 8% in a day with excellent earnings and one like $GME, almost bankrupt, goes up 22% , there is chaos and madness that must be dealt with. In due time, I trust, that things will go back to being logical. Otherwise, it won’t really matter how much money is in your accounts. Money will become worthless if this is not dealt with."
"CRM nudging up today, and if it follows usual trends CRM could grow back to $240 going into ER as it did last ER period when CRM moved from $216 to $250. Depending on what Big Mouth Benioff says post ER possible to test old highs, if he gets focused on social issues and fair share tax #$%$ it could drop,Already hearing Benioff weighing in a politics about taxes....wish he would shut up and stay focused on CRM results.If Benioff, Gates, Zuckerberg think they should pay more than stop paying all those lawyers and accountants to fix their returns to pay minimal OR lets just add a tax line that says ""Fair Share Contribution"" and we'll see how much they volunteer to pay."
Y'all best sell this and get into MSFT! That last acquistion isn't being seen as a good buy
When can this start climbing back up? Does anyone see it going any lower than $217?
"They legit beat by $0.99c lol, guided Q4 Revs above consensus as well ... also guides for FY22 revs lmaoo."

Good result. High expectations. Share price not moving. I wouldn't be surprised to red tomorrow.
"by OppenheimerAfter attending yesterday’s investor day, we have gained increased confidence in Salesforce’s abilities to 1) grow organic revenue 20% over the next 12 to 24 months from further share gains in customer information-technology budgets and the worldwide software market; 2) beat consensus estimates in fiscal 2021 for operating margin expansion and cash flow; and 3) become its customers’ strategic supplier for digital transformation initiatives due to the compelling combination of MuleSoft, Tableau, and Salesforce’s best-of-breed products. We remain Outperform on Salesforce, given management’s commitment at the investor day to sustaining growth with improving profitability, and the company heading to a better position for monetizing on its large installed base in 2020. Raising price target to $190 from $180."
Great week ahead.

Cramer said this will start to sell off tomorrow . I’m holding anyway
I can’t wait to see the look on all those short’s faces when this thing hits 300!
"DOW hasn’t even reached its highs from earlier this year yet all the shorts want to say this is overdone when in reality... cases are dropping, cures are being created, and the next bull run is close. Shorts get killed on this one"
“Cloud” is the future of technology. People can’t understand it and are afraid of what they don’t understand. Big Banks and Funds are collecting all of these easily daily. Cloud is equivalent of World Wide Web 2.0 years ago. Who will own the Cloud????
Ride the wave
$300+ by end of 2020. that's my prediction. Every company needs CRM and every govt needs it too...and they are going that way. AMZN and CRM - pies in the sky. Load it to the cloud-trim down the in-house IT and focus on your core business.
I don’t know how much Cramer pump can push it
"Usually with a huge jump like this, I would say it's a good short, but this is a well justified jump and it should easily get to 300 in no time. This is the Tesla of data analytics for dummies, and many more companies will use them."
New Microsoft move. Will affect?
this is good: https://techstockobserver.com/salesforce-com-inc-nysecrm-delivers-the-goods-and-forces-a-rethink-on-the-cloud-bubble-pop-thesis/
"Imagine being someone who bought that fake +2.5% open. Told you bull trap. Falling knife, sell sell sell sell."
The fact that Salesforce is at 216 after this earnings report is a travesty.
it looks like it wants to make a comeback. let's see what happens after cc.
"Short sellers are bottom feeders and are pathetic losers during these broad stroke market rallies. The market goes higher more oftern than it goes down, that is a fact. These deserve to lose thousands on this one, since they manipulated it and wasted a week of growth time for CRM."
"I'm sure others will disagree, but I used Slack for over a year and a half and found it to be the MOST disruptive tool I ever used. When I say disruptive, I don't mean in a good way--Slack interrupts people when they're trying to work. It's 100 times worse than answering a phone every time it rings when you're in the middle of trying to work."
great earnings report. love the direction of this company.
Internal revenue and everything else positive but the stock price. I’m okay with that.
"Its 20 percent off its high, the big boys are accumulating now and should shoot up soon. One day we gonna see huge jump "

This one loves too run into earnings....
Market Makers Shorted over 1000 Contracts of 105 in the money Call Options this Monday at well over a dollar apiece that are expiring on Friday.. They are pocketing that $$ from the buyers of those contracts..MANIPULATION at best to swindle money from Option buyers.. Happening almost every week.. with this stock.. Some #$%$ must be controlling the HFTs..
Phew...what a day. One thing I was not sure if I was able to process Q2 details right. They guided Q2 higher but projected below .52c estimates. Where does the company leak? Am I missing something. (Long on-off since 2008). BOL.
"While I appreciate the cheer leading for CRM, I am just not seeing what you guys are seeing. A high PE among other things like the MA activity with Tableau says, to me, that CRM has hit a temporary pice point resistance wall and the upcoming earnings will be under pressure. This has been one hack of a market ""dead cat"" bounce in the past week or so after that big downdraft. However, CRM is not participating and remains stalled. So far, my covered call writing has been the correct decision.. Just since I wrote them on 4/22 for the Jan 2020 $170 calls I have a gain of >75%. If it gets to 85% I will cover and then consider if I should sell the position or write some more calls at a lower strike and longer expiration to let the stock recover. I do assess CRM as a long term play however, so I guess I am in the shorter term for my outook but when I purchased it at the end of Feb at $163, I did not think that way at all."
"How can one be confident of a stock when the CEO himself sold millions of dollars worth of stock last week? He knows what many don't. At the same time, It's truly a great business."
Percentage-wise Slack's revenue growth has been slowing. Slack are still losing $200 million per year. This was a terribly expensive acquisition for almost nothing. A lot more dilution is coming to current CRM shareholders and a poorer bottom line. Beware!
I sold about half my position after the 8/26 run up in price. Then I read of the layoff' on the same day as announcement of record revenues and profits. Now I’m selling the other half.
"1% drop already!!! And the market is flat....oh boy you got to love the fact that the charts showed you what was going to happen today!!! Read charts guys and you will make so much money...I can recommend other stocks for the long (I’m long BFT, AMZN and AAPL). So far 4 for 4!!! HAHAHAHAHAHA this market is great"
"20 times revenue for WORK, what is mgmt thinking, $17billion for a money losing company, CRM mgmt need their heads examined."

"Remember retail, long term investing, add on major dips. Most retail investors lose money because they trade too much, shorting, options, try to play the game. Average return 2% a year, 85% lose money."

"Which one is better CRM, SNOW, FROG OR SPLK THEY ALL ARE GOING DOWN.What would be best for long term for first time buyer...?"
when ex-dividends are paid? i want money for eat
"Don't rush buying now, it will trade in the 225 range tomorrow."
"I think there's still more downward momentum. Although it's filled the gap from August, it's still in a downward channel. I am going to wait for a little consolidation before jumping in. Definitely a good long-term stock."
Growing growing growing
"Why they over look AMZN, GOOGL, FB, NFLX, PYPL and TSLA?"
"The stock is simply not at $149, that is something made up by the crazy short poster. The pre-market bid is actually up a quarter to $157.10. The speculation of a ""tape"" over the weekend was absurd and perpetrated by our short wacky poster."
"Upgrades coming , raised guidence"
"This is the market leader. We will be ok. AAPL in the past nine months or so, did this. 163 to 149 to 176 to 162, you know where it is now. Don’t give in."
buying this stock at 226 is the biggest regret of all my actions... luckily I didn't buy much.
#$%$ me off when companies beat earnings but its still not good enough for investors who expect ridiculous results. earning were mint. spot on.
"KeyBanc analyst Brent Bracelin raised his price target for Salesforce to $180 form $147 after another ""solid"" quarter that was punctuated by a $51M revenue beat on increasing momentum within Commerce and Integration Cloud segments from broadening customer adoption of newly acquired MuleSoft and Demandware products. The analyst reiterates an Overweight rating on the shares."
Does anyone think it will be below 220 by Dec 18?
"Some perspective needed here. Dec 1, when the purchase of Slack for about $27B was announced, Salesforce market cap was $227B. Today it’s market cap is $189B. So if you buy Salesforce today you got Slack for free plus another $11B in market cap."
Can we end in the green?
This company has been running for almost a year.i think is going back to $225.00 today.
CRM has lots of call buying according to fly on the wall at the February 1 90 and 195 levels￼￼
This could neither drop or rise based on earnings and Q1 guidance
This is going to fly...they smashed earnings...J
Is salesforce planning to take over dropbox? I see investment from salesforce in drop box!
CRM and PLAN look like the places to be in cloud
"Slack will be a financial anchor for years to come....its dilutive to earnings and growth....MSFT will eat its lunch....I hate MSFT, but I hate this deal more....CRM should have just made a deal with them instead of buying them...I am out and will stay out....the growth trajectory of CRM just got cut back significantly."
Bouncing back due to the TREMENDOUS UPGRADES.
Pffttttt other stocks go up 25% in a straight line...this can barely hold onto 2% what a POS
god dam! i bought crm at 161$ per shares
7 strong buys today.
Strong buy on cloud pull back!
Might see this at 200Investors not happy for the expenses!
this stock is going higher
Shorts covering...soon $230
"Generally, a high P/E ratio means that investors are anticipating higher growth in the future. Which is the case for Salesforce. As long as sales and revenue are going fast, EPS does not matter for a growth company at a like in its growth cycle.If one is so worried about PE of a growth company and being pricey, instead of complaining , should by a utility company stock!"
Have regretted many times not buying but jumped on 450 shares yesterday around $220. Sometimes Mr. Market gives second chances.....
looks like crm has woken up
169 tomorrow
You only worry if it goes below 216. That’s the real bottom as it was there intraday and I bought more shares. This stock is very well positioned for next year but we have to be patient. Once stimulus is approved this will go back up.. and we know it’s coming very soon
Buy yourself a great Christmas gift today. Time to load it up.
Monday shaping up to be in the Green
Approaching a HUGE BUY. Boolean
"ALERT EVERYONE! Salesforce is experiencing a nationwide crash of their platform! My company uses it for all aspects of our service center, enrollment and call center. Everything on the platform has crashed and it's a nationwide issue. How is nobody else talking about this? It's been since 8am this morning and still has not been fixed"
why are you making comments on company that you dont like also if you invested in this company you have to be patient for a long term. Non of these stocks can make you a millionaire in a month. If you want to play gamble go for small cap stocks
It's true that it went down with the adquisitons but this stock lost all of its momentum the second Cramer said it was a great stock.
MSFT’s cloud business up 76%. Good harbinger for CRM. Stock will have a blowout quarter when the ER comes out.
Are you kidding me
I actually think that CRM will hit +400USD by the end of the year. There are just so many companies outside of U.S. that are still not using their services and the current events are making them realize it’s advantages.
I think Slack needed CRM more than CRM need Slack!
"Thoughts on earnings coming up. Buy, sell or hold?"
ez short
142 after the bell heard it here first
This stock need to find some support.
"When a friend told me he was getting at least one solid pick every week from a certain program I was skeptical. Anyway, I checked out (http://Stocks-tracker.com) and haven’t looked back since. Join them."
"Diminishing earnings, can’t even go up when the market is in a bubble mode. What do you think it will happen when we get a correction? Back to $130. I feel bad for people who bought at 250+"
Topped at 156
"If you’re waiting to buy this dip, I wouldn’t get greedy and try to time the bottom too perfectly or you may miss out as this begins to climb back up. I believe that here around $227 - $228 is the low, and it will begin its rebound from here. Good luck all! Great earnings beat, great acquisition!"

"Nice up day but we are just back to lasts week level, basically gone nowhere! Look like $154.50 is a tough resistance as we cannot break it to get to $160-$165. With stellar ER and Guidance CRM should not be struggling like this...........Benioff selling is not the reason because it is scheduled sales. I see it more as getting caught up with the tech concerns and lawsuits. Once investors distinguish CRM is in a separate part of tech (namely cloud) and if tech heavy ETF's stop their selling/rebalancing, we should see CRM get back to $165....where it belongs!"
Matt it doesn’t matter if it’s green today. Look at a chart. This stock is the gold standard of what amazon AWS does. One day people will realize this.... or Amazon will offer $500 a share in buyout and jaws will drop lol. Do some research
It’s sad how short selling kills the upside of a genuine stock with such great earnings. There needs to be a limit on amount of short selling possible right after earnings announcement
"There's gonna be a short covering panic this morning, look at the prices in pre-market. If you are short most any decent stock, today your goose is cooked. Never smart to hold a short position over a weekend."
Just let it grow. Run to 240 please :)
Buy SNOW. CRM will buy them ASAP. That's rocket ship..
Curious how much support the institutional players of crm will provide before the eventual march down to 150
Markets at all time high last week and this was negative on the week. Today markets dip a bit and this follows suit...you can’t win with this one until a catalyst like earnings makes this move one way or the other...in the meantime $215-$220 is our trading range. Sad this gets no love anymore...
Any recommendation on how I should get back into this stock? I pulled out early and will be selling something else to keep the cash position I am comfortable.
Do you guys see it reaching $154 soon?
"If you do not like a growth company growing at 35-28% rate. You should invest in ATT, WM and GE."
"Wow, a rocket today. Options indicate a price of $137 by January, and 127 by this Friday."
those $220 week ending call options look very tempting for a nice pop tomorrow

Huge buying opportunity!!! This a great company!!!
Poor forward guidance. I wouldn’t buy until 200-210. Going down more. Cant even get 1% in a bigly Green Day after falling 6.3% Friday. Not a good sign.
"Anytime trading over $151.50 this morning add shorts, CRM is going to go down BIG TIME today"
250.00 is next
lets see where Crm headed today? north or south the border
Great entry point
How could this stock be down 20% off its highs with the nasq and dow at record highs?
good luck longs ...let's make some money
"this was a excellent, blowout quarter. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-salesforce-forecasts-full-results-202954410.html"
I will keep buying the dips. In 5 years I will laugh about the price today. Almost 25% growth in revenue year ovee year. And that with the rapidly growing demand. Im sold
CRM is a huge winner. You buy here you win. You hold here you win. There isn’t any losing scenarios
hopefully buyers come in tomorrow
ONE OF THE WORST buys by any tech company I have seen in 20 plus years. I remember the last good days of the DOTCOM BUST of 2000-2001. This SLACK acquisition has all the smell of one of those really bad deals from 2000. Buy up a very very overvalued company with with what? A stock which is slightly less overvalued.........The only good news is that no cash is trading hands here. ALL Salesforce gets is a big writeoff down the road. The Tableau buy made great sense. Tableau is and was a market leader in a very rapid growing and profitable business. SLACK is a ME TOO product which has gained traction through STAY AT HOME times...........Those times are ENDING! REPEAT! ENDING!! The Vaccine planes are being loaded with millions of doses each and every day........What the heck was the CEO of Salesforce thinking???

CRM has found its bottom. Expect a run up to $240-$250 before earnings.
Nice love this dip !!!! Will wait until Friday to get back in

"Jefferies analyst John DiFucci raised his price target for Salesforce to $172 from $168 citing the company's ""solid"" Q2 results which he says exceeded expectations across the board. The print, however, was perhaps not as strong as the last two quarters, the analyst adds. While billings guidance implies further moderation of new subscription annual contract value in the second half of fiscal 2019, this likely reflects management's ""typically prudent approach to guidance,"" DiFucci contends. He recommends buying Salesforce on any weakness today and keeps a Buy rating on the shares."
"My opinion and observation. People are freaking out. I am not. I am still holding at 38.00 and 31.00 and I have ZERO worries. A) Being a dropbox user that has used other cloud sharing programs including Google Drive, it is my preferred. B) Dropbox is a beast on it’s own but its attachment and the two new integrations into Salesforce CRM is only going to turn it into a Monster Beast. Salesforce has ownership, acquisitions and investments of many private companies. (Business Insider has another listed I did not see on the website. ($DOMO)If you are NOT familiar with Salesforce ($CRM) then do your DD on this company. Unicorn performance. Marc Beinoff made a 100 million dollar investment into Dropbox prior to going public. Which according to business insider this is one if it’s largest strategic investments ever. Prior to the 100 million, Salesforce invested 5 million. Salesforce owns more shares in Dropbox than any other company. It is also the 2nd largest investment by value. The highest value is in Docusearch but with less shares than Dropbox. Dropbox two newest integrations with Salesforce is only going to continue growth, in my opinion. Salesforce invested publicly traded companies. $DOCU Docusign which IPO last April with a 52 week range of $37.00-66.00 currently at 57.74, $TWLO Twilio with a 52 week range of 52 Week Range 23.25 - 79.47 current 76.04. $DBX Dropbox 52 Week Range 26.61 - 43.50 current 29.04. Look at Salesforce financials, revenue and growth. The 52 Week Range $CRM 90.09 - 149.35“Salesforce expects to post $20 billion to $22 billion in revenue in its 2022 fiscal year. If it hit even the low end of that range, its revenue would be more than double the $8.4 billion it posted in fiscal 2017, which ended in January.To get there, Salesforce expects to offer a wider range of products to a broader set of customers worldwide. The company expects its total addressable market — which is the combined amount of money spent globally with Salesforce and all of its competitors on the products it offers — to grow from $72 billion in 2018 to $120 billion in 2022.” (Source: Business Insider)"
Bought 30 contracts at 232$ for next week play since this has been oversold and hopefully santa rally bring this back up.Good luck yall!!
"Longs thanks for lending me your shares to short all day it’s been very profitable, I just got my red Lambo but I am getting a Tesla S too so as thanks I will let longs choose the color of my Tesla- just reply to this post with your vote - but not green with envy"
should bounce
going to $200. nobody cares about earnings in this market
I would venture to guess cause no one really knows but $135 is more likely in the cards because of the CEO speaking his mind
CRM Revenue Growth is phenomenal.
it would be nice to see them bust the gates on 250 today.
"Why is CRM over $60 per share? They cannot even earn EPS of $4 for a year. It is likely to fall significantly. Inflation has been beyond target since February 2021. We have been seeing sequential increases by 1.2X each month in the CPI. Here is the trend for 2021 inflation:Month ____ Month% ___ Annualized%Nov _______ +0.22% ______ +2.8%Dec _______ +0.28% ______ +3.3%Jan _______ +0.33% ______ +4.0%Feb _______ +0.4% _______ +4.8%Mar _______ +0.48% ______ +5.8%Apr _______ +0.58% ______ +6.9%May _______ +0.69% ______ +8.3%Jun _______ +0.83% ______ +10.0%Even the above has been underestimating the increase of inflation, expecting the CPI inflation to show +0.48% in March 2021. The actual number came in at +0.6% for March. That is already an annualized rate of 7.2%. This is rising a lot faster than expectations and will be VERY DIFFICULT to stop if it goes unchecked. This is like a train that got on the wrong track and is rapidly ascending toward disaster. The engineer is asleep in his chair. Inflation is far BEYOND the Fed's target of 3% per year. It is already more than 2X of that target. There will be no more stimulus. Huge rate increases are coming. And a stock market crash is going to come as the Fed will urgently need to become the market's worst enemy. Nasdaq will head to 5000. It has inflated way too high. Hyped companies like CRM will drop even farther. Nasdaq will go down more than 55% as the Fed rapidly raises rates."
Added
Salesforce is a great long term hold. This report does not change that one bit. Move to $350 will be swifter then some can imagine. Shorts are welcome. Come along for the ride.
CRM is up 6.67% to 143.27
$26 BILLION for an app?. BWAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA AHHHHAHAHAHA WHAT A JOKE IT ALL IS..
"As per my previous post I sold around $185, a bit early, and now watching CRM for a re-entry point but have some concerns to re-purchase. Let me explain and would like your valdi opinions:There is a new push from left, and looks to have put its claws in Biden to also drive this ""put an end to shareholder capitalism""!!!! This sounded very much like the philosophy of Benioff in previous interviews and his book. Benioff professed that companies NEED to be more focused on social issues vs profits and shareholders"". Now this idea (idiotic) looks to have teeth in the democratic platform. So here is the questions. with such a push will Benioff try to lead an effort or prematurely implement programs to compliment a move away from Shareholders and fiduciary ideals.Thoughts?"
Glad i bought some more yesterday.
back in thx
"Overvalued on every metric, this has got to go down more! $180 seems the right price per other posts. No catalyst coming up for several months...avoid at all cost"
Going under 100
Only 2 days left in 2020. CRM is called the gold mine of ️️️️ by Wall Street!
Crm is on run now .. next stop 230
It’s really worrying when the insiders sell left and right and retail investors are left holding the bag waiting for a miracle 
"240 is a great price for anyone looking to buy more!! Price going down is natural during any acquisition. Once the Slack news is official, prices should correct to 250 within a week or two (latest). Thats $10 profit for every share you buy today!!! LETS GOOOOOOO"
Managed health care too scary too own because of Liz Warren . Banks yield curve and more regulation risk due to Warren. Chips have China uncertainty . Eventually money has to come back too SAAS.
"Raymond James raised price target to 280 from 255. Strong buyGoldman Sachs lowered price target to 260 from 275. Maintain buy rating Be interesting to see what stock price will be by end of year My guess, 240"
Looking good for CRM!
"If anyone wants to get out this, you're crazy. The MACD is about to cross bullish. It's basically trading in a sideways range. It's going up for sure."
I just added some more stocks! Easy money. Can’t wait $300 short term and $500 in the long term.
"Not showing any weakness into after hours closing, and actually displaying strength. Close over $245 ... IMO this continues into tomorrow’s trading landing us in the $250 range. Shorts are welcome, come add fuel to the fire."
Should be up big time today.
Once we clear and hold $160 it’s onto $175. This stock is breaking out.
"The runway for sales growth at CRM is still substantial... Here's the best part, when sales growth does slow to a single digit percent, free cash flow will be at levels allowing Salesforce to do substantial buybacks annually (see Apple model). This will result in EPS growth as far as the eye can see right now. Don't sleep on CRM. Good luck CRM longs!"
Amazing company. Good earnings. Im loading up.
Look at crm 2 year chart! Straight up!!
Relax everyone. If they’re gonna pay $23+ per share. The stock I’ll temporarily be down 23-25.00 until the deal is closed and it’ll bounce back. Merging stocks 101
Money is pouring into crm at these levels. It’s a steal and crm is the leader of the pack.
Shorts can’t even get it below 150 and keep boasting.. Give it up you shorts. CRM Breaking out today.
We will get there next week boys.. patience
100 $ is next step
"Why has CRM paid such a high average tax rate, over the last 11 years: 43.9%?Do they have losses or expenses they have not taken that could be taken this year?"

"I sold it all above 107. Nice run up into earnings, nice return, company has already recently announced optimism in forecasts. Sell it here."
Is that a cup with handle that I see? Converging moving averages? If you haven't done so already - buy now.
Just want to say thank you to all the shorties out there 
great to Apple's COOK going after FAKEBOOK....that I love. As for Salesforce -- we are going much higher and I am UBER BULLISH HERE. Boolean
adding at 224 if needed 300 onthe horizon
They already took off 15 billion by selling shares
Great opportunity to buy ignore the noise
"Salesforce price target raised to $235 from $220 at JefferiesJefferies analyst Brent Thill raised the firm's price target on Salesforce to $235 from $220 and maintains a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst's survey of 50 partners indicates 42% saw their Salesforce pipelines improve over the past three months. The setup for the company's fiscal Q2 looks attractive given the improving pipelines combined with a conservative guidance, Thill tells investors in a pre-earnings research note. He believes Salesforce shares are attractively valued."
SALESFORCE GOING TO SURGE IN 2021 YEAH BABY
The premarket volume is very low with all these price target raises...kind of doesn't make sense..I think the smart investors/institutions will see this and wouldn't be shocked to see a massive drop at the open....time is a ticking!!!
I am a fan of the company and their work. I am a huge fan if Marc Benioff and his ethical and stakeholder focused leadership.
still thinking $200 is the entry point here...
Where is the big selloff Dhead?
omg its happening!
Lol people selling day trading .... the only real winners will be institutional investors not you
Underperformance is the firstSign of a major downturnParticularly after a good earning report.This is a SHORT target 90-95
"This company is a ponzi scheme. It is bleeding cash. They claim 4th quarter operating cash flow of $1.3 billion, up significantly from the year ago quarter. But strip out unearned revenue and they bled cash on an operating basis as they do every quarter. In fact, the increase in operating cash flow year over year is simply less than the increase in unearned revenue year over year. Benioff and Cramer are bull**it artists in my opinion. This company is a ponzi scheme that needs unearned revenue up front to keep going. It will crash and burn."
Was expecting a solid bounce today.....now giving up most gains. Is this going to be dead money for a while?
These earnings were crushing. This will be back up esp by next earnings in February.
"Can you say ""decelerating revenue growth"" three times real fast before the close?"
Added more at $232. Thanks to the sellers lol
seems risky....good luck to all...
"Short term looks scary, earnings won’t be great with so many big buys. Long term looking sweeet"
"Take a look at Innovative Foods, IVFH, they grew earnings by 53% and it still trades for a P/E of 6, almost debt free."
"LOL smart money selling??? ARK has a $22 million position in it, initiated about 2 weeks ago at $227."
Why is the co-CEO Mac Benioff continues to sale his holding? It’s been a pattern now. Is that a bearish act? I am confused.
BOOM!
SALESFORCE (CRM) RECEIVES A RATING UPDATE FROM A TOP ANALYST2/18/2021 Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained a Buy rating on Salesforce yesterday and set a price target of $300.00.
That was a beautiful close
"Wedbush told clients Slack deal is game changer for CRM, I’m adding on weakness"
why are insiders selling about 1000 each ?? today .. it due to some problem with earning?
Any chance of turning green today?
No news on earnings right now. I don't understand the drop right now.
it's all about the guide. I simply do NOT see Benioff guiding lower even in this tech wreck we have going on.
"Loaded CRM again today, holding 120 units , not selling single unit until 300"
Monness Crespi & Hardt Analysts Raises Salesforce's Price Target to $210
ZI...earnings Aug 10. seems to be moving higher into earnings.
"Why is it down? Taking over Slack is a good thing, right?"
Earnings call is about to start and it’s not going to be pretty
Will be 4.5-5% buy now.. if you want $$$
Crm running for 300.
"Got in at 120 few weeks ago, finally it's moving."
"If you think this decline is bad, wait until the January sell off. CRM can easily hit $150"
"My short term target ,$240- $250 by Feb,2021. glta"
id rather buy crm on a bigger pullback
The future of this stock will be amazing.
IRA just got a little bit more pretty
Wow rally faded so fast I couldn’t add as many shorts as I wanted this morning
slack is slacking
Looking at the balance sheet it appears additional paid in capital increased by $4.175 billion from 2018 to 2019. I looked at the cash flow statement and didn't see anything that indicated there was a equity infusion during the year. Can someone tell me what I'm missing? The share count increased by around 40 million during the year. Thanks.
When will this stop bleeding and why?
"Its consolidating above the 200 moving average.It lost 40 billion in market cap from a 27 billion dollar purchase (Slack is about to be profitable btw, in its last report it broke even).Good news have exaggerated reactions but so do bad news and news about acquisitions (Slacks acquisition wasnt bad news).This will be 300 before the summer. Just watch."
"Ever since it was added to the DJI, it has caused me pain. What gives?!"
25% discount. Everyone and their mom should be buying thisb
Bumpy Ride today. WE FLY ON MONDAY
is it too soon to say the recovery is in progress?
Good company. Bad stock. Facts. Weak forward guidance will weigh down shares along with bloated valuation. Sell or hold. Not a buy. Don’t get burnt catching falling knife.
"While I know salesforce is a great company and has been growing steadily over the years, I am puzzled why the stock absolutely underperformed even Home Depot over the past 10 years, only catching up due to the recent run up, even so the return is still lower than HD. Also prior to the previous earnings their PE was over 1500, now there is no PE, possibly because they were not profitable in the previous quarter? Confused. Based on the past performance with already such a good business, it is difficult for me to see the stock would be doing better than it did in the past. So I’m out and will find a better stock to replace it. Sold today at 273.75"
Bubble
Topped now at 156
Blow out earnings and this acquisition will be behind them. I bet it will be a stock offer
to the moon baby!
Found safety in RAD
Classic sell on the news. Smart investors are buying. HOLD if your time frame is longer than next week.
Highway robbery that we’re down today!!
UH OH! Looks like a huge miss might be coming
"OBLG or CPAH? ecoethcon wrote on Stocktwits: OBLG Two things moving this today. $WORK being bought by $CRM announced by CNBC and formally PRd tomorrow (according to their source). The other is $ZM earnings... beat estimates but stock was up in anticipation. Also as I mentioned last week $CPAH is a sympathy play for $WORK buyout. See here how it competes with Slack Zoom Google hangouts etc... CPAH is a low floater: 6,411,407, insiders 55,5% (3,887,935)."
"CRM best consensus estimates in EPS and revenue. Additionally, it raised a guidance. Good Good Good"
"Guys this is not buying tomatoes. This company actually has nice competitive advantages and business for many more years. Buy now, sell when you need the money."
What a golden opportunity to add a great opportunity. I think it will join the 1tril club somewhere between 5 and 10 years
OMG did anyone see the huge blowup argument on CNBC lol!!!! Wow that was amazing! Love it lolol
Just a matter few more days and this stock will skyrocket after Earning.
"The market has spoken, spending almost $28 Billion for basically revenues but doesn't make them that much better of an enterprise company. Shareholders getting cornrolled and now company Downgrades are on deck. Buying Slack is like Benioff giving up and throwing money at his lack of vision. Good Luck."
CRM reached a short term bottom. Huge buying opportunity!!!
"Those of you who continue to catch this falling knife be careful. It's been 10 years since the last real correction. Stocks like CRM, full of hubris, spending on huge monoliths in the zany tax and liberal city of San Francisco, making no real economic return and with a PE exceeding 150 are to be avoided. Benioff is stepping aside, his wallet fat, to buy Time magazine as a hobby to promote more liberal drivel. Company built by one of the greatest salesmen of all time, will now be held to real valuation metrics and that should be scary for anyone. Individual investors please remember that today's drop will be minor compared to the real correction coming in all momo stocks. I am not long or short the stock."
CRM wave just started. Will reach $300 before next results.
I GOT A FEELING CRM WILL GO UP GREEN AT THE LAST HOUR TODAY
"Why it's not going up, it's stuck at 153. I have it in my portfolio for long. With so many acquisitions, I was hoping for a wild swing,"

CRM was one of the top 4 stocks bought by activist hedge funds last quarter.
225 target!! Yeah baby!!
"People underestimated the value of WORK. It was average at 30 per share. It proved that customers loved it and could survived and grew revenue consistently under MSFT pressure. It just needs that right click and 45 per share is just the beginning, and I think Marc knows exactly what that is."
Insider sell held this up... My have a day like Overstock very soon...
Shorts will squeeze soon
"Sell CRM and short it, you can go back long at $110"
imagine the next companies to cross the $1T barrier. Have to imagine CRM near the top of that list
A great company!!! Take a advantage of this discount price!!!
"I upped my position a couple weeks back in anticipation of this ER. Hope the pps takes off and does not sell off (people selling into good news). If it sells down, it'll be back up within 2 days maximum so we should all be fine."
"Note that Splunk, Nvidia also pulled back after earnings only to grow stronger the next 2 days! Hold on to this gem"
"CRM stock price dropped about $50 on news of Slack merger. This amounts to over $40 billion decline in total market capitalization of the stock. The deal with Slack was valued at $27 billion. So Slack is being valued at -$13 billion by the stock market! Of course, that is impossible. Slack has positive value. This means CRM is way undervalued right now. Will return to $270 range soon."
Just sold my entire position in $CRM and plunged it all to $U at 82.15. Excited AF.
where is the bottom guys. I keep averaging down but need to see some support. Long term hold for me. I still say 300 by years end. We shall see.
"Bought some yesterday, clearly oversold."
"Soon, the US government is not only going to stop stimulus, but they are going to reverse the stimulus and implement a significant tax increase that will slow the economy, reduce the current benefits currently coming from all overexuberant flow down from companies and from government and from investment to the broad range of Americans. This will hurt the stock markets and prospects of growth. Reality will return with a slap. It will be sobering. In 2017 (before the tax cuts), the S&P500 was 60% of where it is today. We will likely see at least a 40% drop in the S&P500 and the high beta stocks will drop even more. Enjoy!"
Anyone see the new salesforce ad on YouTube that has no audio.... like their Marketing team just forgot to put it in? Doesn’t look great on their part for their business.

I wanna say congrats for Slack deal... Marvelous move! I’m Always amazed by CRM... the future is bright with Salesforce. $500 in couple years!!!!
CRM is one of the largest providers of cloud and a runway leader. if they sold it would be to our advantage as the suitor would be doing extremely well. Cloud is still in its infancy.
Oversold. Bought and wait
I have owned this for the past 11 years. I would rather sell my Kidney.
More and more investors will buy this dip before it rocket up by tomorrow with positive market during this holiday season ...Cyber sale is huge by CRM ...That's another reason they raise their full 2021 forecast...Could see big UPGRADES by tomorrow..
"based on last 2 days of price action $215 is the bottom and the stock will go up from here. If market pulls back the next stop is $210 which is 200ma. But with $1.3T more money coming in , I doubt the market is gonna pull back anytime soon."
bullish 500
Cramer just blessed it this morning uh oh !!!!
Lol.......who really thought this stock would go up after hours given the extreme valuation and the market being in the midst of a corona crisis regardless of their numbers. No one wants to buy stocks now other than the stock of Zoom. Prob get upgrades and target increases tomorrow but the stock will be in the red.
CRM reached a new All Time High at 147.11
I wondered how long it will take this turtle to get to destination unknown.
the earning will be realised in 40min. GL to all long!
"I have CRM at 169, but I would have never bought going into earnings after the run up into earnings. To those that did congratulations"
Bottom in tomorrow! Gap down at open and we will go positive for the day.
"Anti shareholder? No inflammatory yes, the guy has said some extreme wacky things . Not the CEO I want"
"bears have been sitting here for 3 hours saying 'it's dipping, short it'! my god, give it a rest and go find a bad company to short."
This is a $300 stock. Buy while still cheap
Enjoy the ride down boys!!! Peaked again and now we go back to the trend that has been in place since November 2020!!! ENJOY
CRM is not a buy signal. You can safely buy CRM when it hit 235.5/share
Sleeping Giant !!Just one day is good enough to jump 40+
Starting coming up now
CRM expects FY20 non-GAAP EPS to be $2.54 - $2.56 and revenue to be increased by $150M
"Bear Case $186 per Morgan Stanley: Prolonged macro downturn drives low double digit revenue growth. A tepid spending environment amid macro weakness and increasing attrition limits topline growth to 9%-13% over the next 5 years. Recent dilutive M&A limits margin expansion despite increasing opex discipline, limiting pressure to achieving 23% op. margins byFY27 from mid-teens today. CRM trades at25.5x EV/FCF in FY26, yielding a forward twelve month $186 valuation, assuming a8.4% discount rate."
This is a great buy
This stock will be 260 tomorrow
"I’m guessing we tack on another $4 before earnings, $165+ shortly after CRM crushes it."
Dont think MB would let someone else handle the ER if he wasn't absolutely confident it will be a blowout.
Cramer (take with grain of salt) said CRM/Tableau acquisition is a great deal and will enhance clients and growth at CRM. Expects price to rebound as the sell off because of dilution is over-done. He brought up a good point about excellent ER just a few days ago.
This should be 300!
Expect $250.00 within a short time.
It seems manipulators ' trying to PUMP it up in AH so that BIG WHALES could easily DUMP ( sell for huge profits ) heavily by tomorrow for great profits while they can manage enough time when it dropping....
Where did all the short shorts go?
Now that is what I call an overpriced deal! Slack has less than $1 billion in revenues at a time when the valuation has been hyper-hyped by a partly temporary work from home bounce. CRM should have waited for the inevitable correction to a more normal valuation after the Covid fiasco is behind us. And that will happen within the next year.
why is this still above 200????
"Finish the cup at or about 161, then sideways on the handle for a little way, then to the moon."
"Let me educate. Apple is increasingly $ from services, thus PE ratios have aligned with MS and Google. Amazon has massive growth 30%+ annually (near 40% this year). Salesforce is the next Microsoft. Dan Ives Wedbush Iikes it, early Tesla bull."
"This is such a great price right now. I loaded another 100. Look at the 200, it’s 202 and we’re what 70’s from the high? No worries."
Next stop 260
Why is it down after market?
Have loaded yesterday during the drop.. Ready for take off!

Hey Joe and Rastarich-What the heck happened to @salesforce - I thought CRM is on the way to $100 - ????? Maybe folks are realizing the BS coming out of UBS - read the UBS disclosures - UBS is a CRM salesforce market maker - boom line UBS is paid to convince people to buy - buy - buy $CRM see disclosure here http://research.ibb.ubs.com/openaccess/compliance/354234_1_new.html and the CRM analyst for UBS is https://www.linkedin.com/in/brentthill who love $JIVE Jive Software at $23 and now its $4 see UBS report from 2012 http://thestreetsweeper.org/uploads/JiveUBS16.pdf - please load up of Salesforce - Cue @jimcramer to pump is BFF @benioff printing press

Whats up with this $242.30 resistance??
Have watched this thing shoot up and crash 9 times over the last 8 weeks. started day trading it and finally making some money
Does CRM have video Conferencing? Maybe that is the big news that be announced on Cramer tonight.ZM trading down last few days for some reason.
with slack contributing six hundred million dollars does that really justify spending almost $28 billion to acquire it? how many years will it take before they make their money back?
"Chatter about CRM filing for a shelf. If true, it supports the argument that CRM overpaid for WORK, IMHO."
Crm growth will be beyond spectacular. Buy and hold this and you will double your money.
Sell.. tomorrow 30 points down!!
When to sell? Please advise
This is a $300 stock. Buy the discount while you still can!
"Thought I would share that Najarian just highlighted heavy options trading on CRM. He is not always right but at this price for CRM I see upside. My avg price is around $108, have been buying since June 2017. Should have trimmed when $150 but am confident we get back to the high $140's if ER solid. Just hope as I said before Benioff needs to shut up."
CRM is sitting on a major multiyear pivot point. About as low risk as it get for an entry. See the link below for the chart.
we can see 210 definitely within today
"$TSLA $HBI $LUV $PLTR $IMAX $EB $CRMA Santa Claus rally describes a sustained increase in the stock market that occur in the last week of December through the first two trading days in January. There are numerous explanations for the causes of a Santa Claus rally including tax considerations, a general feeling of optimism and happiness on Wall Street and the investing of holiday bonuses. Another theory is that some very large institutional investors, a number of whom are more sophisticated and pessimistic, tend to go on vacation at this time leaving the market to retail investors, who tend to be more bullish."
180s here we come
up at least 10% tomorrow
why don't they buy a baseball field next for 28 billion.
Wow. even the index publisher are changing index for the money as they are being paid by the hedge fund and index fund that subscribe their index to trade . kind of like rating company rate all the subprime AAA since they are being paid. watch out. financial storm is coming very soon.
Sold half rotate into industrial mmm and others
"look who's back on the new 52-week highs list. it's been so solid, steadily up, that i am breaking discipline, & not trimming at the new highs. Still a week before earnings. If its 120 before then, i will trim or at least write calls."
Is it me or this is an amazing entry point?
Just the beginning
MSFT crushed earnings on every level!!! Wow
"tomorrow probably last down day vs market, then this moves higher, so i'll add"
What moved it up today? Thanks
reiterate buy tgt 300
$300 today
Done--bagholders. Snake Oil Man is selling like no tomorrow.
"CRM still cannot hold $160 running into ER.........low investor conviction that ER would be good, so taking profits and dumping shares. I am holding until earnings, does anyone know if the date has been set vs the range?"

230+ coming soon. Never short a consensus winner
"This was way oversold, and is getting back toward its fair price today. Accumulation is taking place at a discount value. Follow the money."
"Pretty sure now that $CRM will go up very quickly. It’s obvious large hands at play here to bring it down. I wouldn’t be so skeptical if the ER had been bad. But, great ER and price drop like this can only spell “manipulation”. I’m not worried, bu just warning other investors that they are trying to make you sell."
People cant read. CASH from Operations decreased 18%. EPS of.84c multiplied by 25 multiple is $25. And this is NON GAAP. cant calculate it based on GAAP since the lose money. Sell at 73 thats a steal for a $25 stock
"It's big bubble. No money earner, but buying revenue with u r money."
In a different market this would be about 30%-50% of its current price. A forever roll up paying higher and higher prices on acquisitions. Looks like about 35 times or so trailing sales for Slack. Oh yeah this is cheap and so is that in another world.Good luck.Peace.
Buy it upppppp
Back to the bull market
"I said this yesterday on here, and i'll say it again. When DXCM broke through resistance, I sold almost immediately, as I thought the price was crazy. I then watched it double. Don't be that guy....once a stock breaks resistance the best thing to do is let it run until it shows considerable slowing down."
"Coincidentialy, under the heading of ""a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while"", yesterday I covered my Jan 2020 $170 calls @ ~ $3 having sold them @ $12+ on 4/22/19. THe beating on CRM was clearly overdone for a variety of reasons including a selling spree by CRM C suite occupants. My message is not to gloat over a 75% gain in the call as much as it is that ALL stocks reach a point where the investor needs to consider downside protection against loss / risk of loss for hard won appreciation. Covered calls work and offer a low risk opportunity for leaving some money on the table. It is simple, cost effective and gain retention friendly even with dividends captured (which CRM is not) for the holding period of the call expiry. This is a great way to lower your cost basis and protect against inexplicable market downdrafts or company related events or competitive announcements. Just a thought to consider..."
The Blah blah blah from D is exceptional
Blowout earnings were higher than huge.
Buying opportunity after an overreaction to the Slack acquisition.A bit over 2 years ago Broadcom fell sharply after they bought CA technologies. I got in then. This is the same. The stock is reaching oversold territory. Get in now.
what just happened that dropped it ? I went to mail a letter and poof
"Easy 220 to 225, by Friday’s close."
Everything I see is in line. Pretty good report given the external conditions. I hope to add to my position tomorrow with this dip.
Down it goes. Cramer said stock is coming down so if your looking to buy wait for lower price. Probably a good Short in the near term.
I see an pop of 10 boxs tomorrow.
"I never get my hopes up with this one. My heart has been shattered too many times. I hold because the digital transformation of the global economy, which CRM is at the center of, has to pay off at some point."
Bought of 153.27 and now its going down...
crm is a pretty consistant earnings stable company.....good place to add shares on drop
"I’m waiting for $210ish, I’m telling you it’s coming."
Tomorrow may be $158.59 high
CRM announcement of employees working from home indefinitely. Huge savings for the quarter. Wonder if they are now going to sell the Ivory tower in SF?
"Why didn't I see this today, likely missed my chance to buy cheap"
A number of the CRM shorts on this thread are just as hilarious as some of the AMD shorts. It's time for some of you to head to a nearby Buffoon's Anonymous meeting ASAP.
What happened after hours ? A million shares traded!
My Trdaing Group said do not buy anything and do not hold overnight. Danger is very near

They will scare you to sell n then they buy

How can the receivables be almost 35% of annual sales? Something doesn't seem right!!.
"CRM CFO/CEO should be 'canned"" for buying SLACK? They have no technical ability to understand they can re-create slack product for $100-million, and since they already have a large customer base, who needs SLACK customer? What a DUMP idea to buy SLACK!!!"
"I believe that CRM should close out this week around $230 tomorrow, then trade in the $230 - $240 range next week. Good luck all!"
"Chairman of the Board & co-CEO of Salesforce.com Inc (30-Year Financial, Insider Trades) Marc Benioff (insider trades) sold 10,000 shares of CRM on 09/12/2019 at an average price of $154.21 a share. The total sale was $1.5 million."
"Approaching the high of the day so far. Keep up the long awaited rally, after we dwindled while others were rising fast."
The Casino always pumps this stock on earnings day. They are drunk in love with it. A money maker.

"Wow, now salesforce goes crying to the EU to protest Microsoft buying Linked In on anticompetitive basis. Reaching for straws. Why don't the crybabies go ahead and overpay for Twitter?"
Great company and Mark is a very smart humble guy.
"CRM has been down a little since the last ER and the slack deal announcement. It started to go back up pretty good yesterday, and I think any selling today is just by the weak hands who bought at the lows in the last couple of weeks, and are selling because it’s gone up a little bit so they are just taking the small profit they made. The smarter investors will hold for the much larger gains to come. Let the weak hands sell and make their pennies, while we wait to make the dollars! Any dips are just buying opportunities to get some more! Good luck all!"
Why does wall st punish this stock so much for good ER
Crm price is based on futer growth. Due to the restructuring that will happen as we get back to work there will be a delay in signing up new business for at least a quarter maybe 2 to 3. Once businesses get get back on their feet crm will grow again there is though risk this gap period may allow competition to get a foothold on CRM dominence.

Remember CRM target only $220
"Yesterday was a good shake-up, I was able to increase my position buying some around 157. Can't wait for earnings!"
If you’re selling after seeing a report like that good luck in the future
I was skeptical of getting into CRM up until they announced acquisition of Tableau. Now I know they’re onto something very big
Got confidence after $CRM
"cnbc says to buy. it has been in consolidation mode since ER and looks like this will go up. also they stated that in late stage cycles of the economy, most companies will use software to cut cost. buy buy buy."
JMP raises Salesforce's price target from $191 to $254.https://seekingalpha.com/news/3607829-salesforce-gets-street-high-target-jmp-on-strong-q2-checks?utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha&mail_subject=crm-salesforce-gets-street-high-target-at-jmp-on-strong-q2-checks&utm_campaign=rta-stock-news&utm_content=link-3
The short term pricing action is just tied to opex since so many people gamble on earnings swings. You can have any combination of earnings revenue guidance meet or miss and stock can still trade in any direction after - all because people play the market like a casino. Just look at bulk of option positions are crushed today - that is no accident.
should we be scared of the 50 day MA getting ready to cross the 200 day MA
shorts better buy now!
"based on interest rates, valuation doesnt make sense. Mark cant keep growing by buying companies."
My pt is $347
Just added to my position and prepared to buy this all up because this company has 10+ years and a trillion in a far future. I’ll wait
So many analysts are saying CRM will be $260 dollars.
What’s the problem with $229??? Every freaking time hard reject
Came over from pypl conversation to congratulate you all longs. Only own crm in Ftec mutual fund and believe you will go from 10 to 9 on their top 10 percent owned lift knocking pypl to 10.
Especially after a week of profit taking. She is now primed for the march upward!
"Huge insider selling is due to this, now it make sense. Surely gonna go down towards $190. It will take long time to recover this.. payment to Slack is yet to make. CRM need more money."
Sell off continues...now below $227....in one hour or so it will be red...Goodbye longs...PUTS will print money. I Thank you
"Made a deal with SNOW instead of trying to buy the company like they did with SLACK...if they would have made a deal with SLACK instead of overpaying for them, stock price would be north of 250...."
They have a fantastic balance sheet. What’s taking so long to move up?
"this stock is way overvalued....none of the metrics make sense....could easily take a 30% hit and still be overvalued...look at the gross margins...look at how they're increasing revenues, acquisitions...it's just a matter of time before this stock comes crashing down..."
Institutional investors and private equity are accumulating in all the dips just look at the disclosures of the biggest private equity on CNBC analysts today that come on.
great day to pick up some Feb March atm calls. stock is breaking out. target 185
FYI legendary trader isn't legendary
Open around $245 tomorrow. $250 is right around the corner
"Benioff ""I think capitalism as we know it is dead"".............give me a break! I hate CEO who cannot keep out of the political fray, instead of focusing on the business. I fear their personal opinions around wealth and growth seeps into the business as a direct contradiction to shareholders and their fiduciary responsibility to shareholders."
CRM always open high and fall back every earning
"People like amazon but they think it’s about online products, it’s not. AWS is 80% of why they are $2,000 a share. Now here is the kicker. Salesforce is the leader, the big boy, the grand daddy of all cloud players. One day it will prove to be worth 5x today’s price"
Tomorrow 50% drop all option Put and call after earning always
Salesforce paid too high price for Slack that’s the problem.
Quants say AVOID and that CRM is a short canidate. Be careful.
I doubled. Thank you. I will triple if it continues to fall. I love deals.
"something is at play here, pre-market $210....better watch my stop losses...It could be that the SP500 itself is reaching a peak and a short-term shift must be made to allocate capital to companies less affected by it...I will learn from this..."
Calm down. Solid quarter. Marching to 200 in summer et
"If you are long, here is what I want you to do, sell all your shares right now at the market and then take the proceeds and sell CRM short- you can thank me later"
"Do your research folks, A friend of mine knows a guy that is good with computers and this guy told us that he thinks CRM is a sell and he has never heard of this Tableau and says “it ain’t worth no $15 billion”- there you go folks, you need to do your research like I do if you want to make money in stocks - sell CRM"
ark is buying a bunch more of this....just trying to figure out why the big drop. Maybe manipulation...big money still trying to get a bunch of this for low price.
"Don’t listen to all the noise by shorts on here bashing CRM and making low predictions just because they want the price to go down. They are just trying to get you to sell your shares or to not buy. This is just a temporary dip. Good time to buy in, or buy more!"
im still waiting to buy when the mkt stops dropping this will rebound the lower it goes the easier for me to make bucks
big sale good entry price
stock went down fast.. will take months to get back this weeks losses ... now back to Dolly Parton's Juggs
Great numbers. Could care less the price dropping
Salesforce have always been very open about their aggressive long term growth goals (~20%+ annual rev for several years to come). Given their history there is no reason to doubt they won’t deliver. On top of that their recent investor day already suggested good news for the upcoming ER. No brainier for a long term buy and hold. A good entry point presented itself today and I hope people took advantage!
CRM reached a new All Time High at 124.18
It is still a strong stock the problem is people are trying to day trade it or speculate a drop in value with slack acquisition however its priced low from my perspective and in oversold territory
That is about right for my day
100 before 150
216 was likely the bottom. I’ll stand by that. Washout lows off the open.
don't buy when everyone is so optimistic...
EPS: .46Revenue: 3.6 billion
"Is the SAP cloud opportunity/competition to CRM hurting this much, CRM is suppose to be the leader in this area. Benioff needs to get focused and stop expensive acquisitions and political commentary. The fact that CRM is way below previous highs and cannot get traction should signal that CRM management needs to laser focus on the business."
CRM has finally fallen off its perch. Looks like support in the $68-$70 range
The market has been dropped by 4 days. It will be rebound today as Vaccine has been shipped by Modenas and used on patients.
"Lot of good news, Red. One bad news Deep Red. That's CRM for you."
Can’t hold $151 so that’s how you can keep profiting all day short when it jumps 151 and cover below and then reload - today it will not hold $151 at close and earlier today it sold off hard above $152 so go all in short anytime it gets above $152 and when bad news hits and it sell off below $149 you will super cash in - this stock is dead money it NEVER sees $155 again
"Cramers wife seems to think if he can’t make money during this Crazy market than parting ways might be an option or something to that effect . My significant other weirdly repeats that message . Too many loosing minds , and becoming something worse than the virus ."
I'm a slack owner. Came in to buy CRM when the deal done. Bought on the dip. Good price at 219
Crm- profits already priced in 4 weeks ago
Most undervalued stock in the market. Many are finally starting to see the growth and upgrades galore everyday.
I’m going long here in a big way.
Window closing better get on board.
Another all time high
If Amazon wanted to they could own CRM. Rule the WORLD

"Been calling out MARIO to explain how he comes up with his target numbers and ive been ignored for days. SO AGAIN MARIO, can you explain how you come up with your sub $200 numbers? Because it is “overvalued” is not a proper answer."
CRM Breakout........
"just borrowed and sold 500 shares, will do that again tomorrow :)"
CRM always beats the market
"Excellent. Buying opportunity. I will add all day and possibly tomorrow if red. When the sheep flee in terror, the wolves pounce. Higher the VIX, better the deals. I add to everything like this, including Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Netflix etc....and now Salesforce."
Trading $224 - $225 pre open.
On the way to $250 in few days
"this report is worse than NVIDIA, NVIDA dipped 8 percent, CRM will dip 10 percent tomorrow!!!!"
Running to the regulators when they lose out in the marketplace. Who looks desperate now?
"21% growth, and predicting another 21% growth for next year. That’s pretty cool"
"Can't believe I started buying this at 225 and will continue to buy down to 200. Don't need the money for the next 10 years, just hope they don't go Bankrupt."
Mario the stock chart reading guru aka Mr Told you so aka $185 next week guaranteed aka learn to read charts aka puts are printing money sure has been quiet. Hope youre ok buddy
NEXT FOR THIS COMPANY BE SINCE THEY GOING ON DOW JONES INDEX......DIVIDENDWATCH THIS STOCK GOT TO $400 BY END OF THE YEAR
I do not own CRM but it is a buy now!
good job salesforce for acquiring slack. Bad job sales force for those that got in at 242 and above.
"Finally systems are back up running after four hours of outage, shocking"
"Someone just bought 107,000 shares in after market. If thats not bullish on the stock, i dont know what is. I think we are about to see a run in the next week."
Tomorrow breaks 220
"Once again, the 75 day MA has been rock solid support for over a year. I don’t have a position in CRM so I’ll be waiting for that test to jump in for the ride back up"
"$CRSP Massachusetts Institute of Technology purchased 22,162 shares of $CRSP between 80 and 100 (new position. That makes $CRSP the 3rd highest holding of MIT behind Boston Scientific $BOMN and $CRM MIT also added $AAPL in q3Link is gurufocus."
Strong support round these parts. Not to mention getting one of the strongest companies on the planet.
$250 fair value
With such stellar result why the hell u will sell this

"This baby is holding up very nicely in the AH session, I continue to expect a very positive move up tomorrow during the regular session from CRM, especially if the market as a whole turns Green. Also looking forward to the Earnings report tomorrow morning from GIII, I expect it to be very good and for the stock to pop up nicely.If things work out as I plan/hope, I will close both of these positions tomorrow afternoon, with profit, and then go Long RH and TLYS, two more Earnings plays that I am very confident and excited about. They both report after the close tomorrow, and both should have very good earnings results and pop up in price afterwards. Of course, the possibility that I COULD be wrong, cannot be ruled out. So, do your own Due Diligence, and...Good Night. :-)"
Credit Suisse resumed coverage of Salesforce with a rating of Outperform and set a new price target of $260.00
"Now is a perfect time to enter a day trading position. The market is literally flat (0%), CRM trading in a -0.5-1% range. It's at the low end of the day and the odds of it going WELL past $220 is extremely slim.Put $30K down to make $150-200, easy money."

Time to take profits since I recommended at 177 and wait for a pullback.
Next stop $160-170+

"Cramer just defended CRM on the Realmoney for-pay site. Talked about the frothiness of Beyond Meat, but then a few lines about the acquisition.

Look at how choppy this is trading...yet the markets are soaring and making new highs....look at the charts and know this is just getting a boost from the overall markets but will definitely continue it’s downtrend.

Expect a lot of downgrades and/or lowering of price targets tomorrow
if this goes red I'm getting so drunk tonight
Boom! Congrats holders
beats but no movement lol great job
Got to luv all the shorts trying to get everyone to sell LOL LOL
Ok thought $220 was good support. Now what lol
"CRM will cross $200 in few days, buy at this level"
$300 is eminent & will be easy money #GLTA
"CRM buying Discord? Is this legit, if so this will be a massive acquisition with huge potential."
To start I do own 10 shares of CRM and I’m holding in my Roth IRA for the next 30 yrs but I find it hard to believe it is valued at 10x revenue currently.
Terrific day for long

Hey just wondering why your great co ceo mark Benioff just unloaded 50k shares this past week you think he realizes how overpriced this company really is I would run for the hills while you can crm fans
"eps too good to stay down,watch for $6-$8 point move in stock price over the next week"
Bought some more today!
The CEO literally said they are working on doubling the company by 2024. That's huge
Bought 1k of CRM. CRM has already gone down more than $30 billion in market cap. This is as if they are getting WORK for free.
Whisper number?! Better back up the truck now.
And what companies want to lease additional space?? Hmm. Growing companies that need more space for employees??
Live to fight for another day. Tune in for Trump’s comment after the market.
I bought CRM after it was added to the DJI.
This company is statist company looking to disallow use of its products by companies selling items (firearms) their CEO does not like. Just imagine if flour companies did not allow bakers to use their products to make cakes for same sex marriage celebrations.
Going up while the NASDAQ is taking a beating? Nice!
I honestly don't know how this is able to hold current price levels...It's almost as though someone is keeping it propped up. Any ideas??
Excellent report..positive guidance
"After exhibiting incredible patience, I am finally exhausted of this dog of a stock. I finally dumped CRM today. It doesn't go up when the rest of the market does, and it seems to stay constant or go down when the market goes down. Yes, I get it, one day I'll wake up and see 260, but the likely cost of the missed opportunities during that time means it's not worth waiting to me. If tomorrow or next week is that day, I'll eat my words. And by ""missed opportunities,"" I don't mean throwing money into NIO, JMIA, FCEL, etc. and hoping for a 10% return in one day. I mean missed opportunities on other relatively stable but upward-trending stocks.SalesForce has a great product with great prospects, and I'm confident it'll have a nice upward trajectory in the long-term, but for now, it's a dog."

Could be finally being noticed for what this is..... hidden gem.
"I have been using $CRM for over a 10 years at a Global 100 company IT side. There were about 10 people working in the area when I started. Now there are like 50. You see the growth story there. We lvoe @CRM. We also use @work (slack) for several years now but are on our way of migrating to @MSFT Team. I heard a lot of larger enterprises are doing the same. My guess is that if $CRM were to buy @work for $20b, then the market cap of $crm will drop by $20b. Why? Because @work is competing with a freeware owned by the largest software company in the world. Just look at the growth of @msft Team in the last year - 115 m users in a few short months."
"NUAN is a Voice AI company....its transforming itself in a great way (majority of that is already done, now it is about sales) and new growth is coming from high margin SaaS subscription services..in healthcare and enterprise. For comparison, look at Salesforce $CRM business model and stock price growth ($NUAN's subscription revenue is high quality, stable and recession-proof). NUAN is a market leader with a a strong moat..the great thing about this company is that it has 700+ AI developers, 3000+ patents and it is one of the few companies who invests back in the R&D (it is increasing its R&D budget from 10 to 13% while narrowing the focus on profitable use cases). Top-line is increasing by 25-30% YoY growth. Regarding the demand trends, just check how many of the people around you prefer to talk to Alexa or Siri..use voice instead of text..? $NUAN is great investment - it's new journey has just started,.. I expect accelerated momentum starting with it upcoming earnings report in 2020 .BUY !!!"
How are people selling this so cheap lmao
CrmAbout toBlastTo 335
planning to report a great report next week
yikes no one on this board for earnings???
why are so many shares sold? Anyone know what deal is now.

Unbelievable

"After watching other cloud stocks fall after earnings (whether they are good or bad), and the overall poor forward guidence coming out of these companies, it might be wise to trim before earnings are released."

"Great, another Red session on another Green Day."
"Benny why did you go that way? Gun Control 2.0! No way! Support the second amendment, build your business based on the protection it gives to you and everyone in this country! I am now going to have to sell my shares! Good Bye instead of Good Buy :("
Load the boat today folks! Will go up soon.
"If some overreaction does take hold tomorrow, the 75 day moving average has been rock solid support for over a year now. I’m a buyer on weakness to that level."
What excuse will Cramer have ?
"CRM, crushed all estimates! Higher margins, buy the sell off. Raised all estimates to boot."
Nasdaq down almost 4% this week but crm holding up like a champ. Good sign! First couple days of a sell off are often the worst as dip buyers can be hesitant. If we see any other dips I expect buyers are going to start coming in.
Tomorrow is green for sure..114 is a must
120 on the horizon? waiting patiently :)

This is not a PSA but to my guy @Jared you might want to be looking at BFT. I'm not going anywhere here but can't be a 1 trick pony.
Fantastic Quarter beat and raise on all metrics.
Everyone and their brother has been pumping this. Can’t believe it was basically flat today after its great fall yesterday.
Watching the CRM pre-market gains like William Wallace right now... “Hold! Hooooooold!!!”
"they solidly beat Q4 EPS estimates. guess investors don't like Keith Block leaving, or is there drama behind him leaving? I would think stock price would be up now after hours."
CRM will continue to rise with the Dreamforce conference starting up in about 10 days. Looking for a rise to $160 by next week.
$125 after report is my prediction
Should I buy some today?
"WOW, this HUGE for the future of salesforce now i see how they will double sales in the next several years"
We bottomed.
I’ve lowered my cost basis to $223 a share. 85 shares. Start a position or add to your position this week. I’m expecting some volatility before it heads northward. 
"Been out of NVDA for a few months, decided to get back in today at $266.70. This is a keeper along with $CRM and $TTD! All 3 should be at leas 15% to 20% higher by years end."
"What? Same thing happened to AMD a month ago, this thing will keep dropping for a week like AMD?"
Way oversold.... Load up for a quick upswing.
WOW Mark. WE WAY OVERBOUGHT THISI WILL GIVE YA $220 buddy 
Will probably offer $45 per share now for the rest of DBX shares that they don't already own.
What a panic selloff!!! What a opportunity to buy a discount!!!
100 peCome on
"Company has <15% organic growth when you remove revenue from all buyout, Yet it value go up by $50B in single day on result which is 2.5 time it's yearly revenue.Who and how they decide on valuation?We have Intel who make more profit then revenue of this company also growing in teens and trade at <$250B rate. They also have so much cash on hand when you discount it actually < $200B market cap and stock go down on record revenue because some manufacturing issue which really not issue because first delay was just 6 month and second they have plan to use 3rd party process to complement and reduce any impact."
Keep in mind Docusign low on opening day was 37.00 4/27 - On 6/20 it hit a high of 66.80. Has retraced to high 57's. We will follow suit and sooner than later. I am holding on for the long term. Good things and bright future. This is the next big $CRM invested company runner. No brainer.
Could be UP to above $250 in 1/2 hours.. as it is a trap for short sellers
This will be sold off the pop tomorrow guaranteed. The market is terrible.
Dang! Banks buying this. Gotta do my toes too. $200 here we come!
$CRMTarget Set by Sanford Bernstein Neutral USD 234
"Darn. Was keen on Salesforce and its business — as is without slack. I understand value of crm software and why customers would pay for it. I don’t see huge value in business chat software. Is value of deal primarily based on increasing the enterprise value of slack by leveraging access to Salesforce customers, capital, salesmen? I can clearly see how slack business benefits; less clear of material benefit for Salesforce business."
160$ in a month
March crash expected again. Warning from Robinhood investor.
did earnings come out?
"trump is not lying. All the guys who are shorts are trying to spread this rumour. my only advise to them "" grow up and go long """
I feel great! Predicted $214 and I was right...next week $210 for sure
SAP is down by the same percentage/ What is going on?
Showing lots of strength the last few trading sessions. I'm thinking it's gonna break-out soon. Maybe before next week...
Setting up for a boom
I've been following this stock for a few years and it seems once it hits 160 the sellers come in and knock it back down. If you day traded this stock you;d be way ahead. 153-160 is the pattern.
So is this a BUY?
Is this the same company that was just on 60 minutes?
"On the CC, there was a question about operating margin. The question wasnt really answered. however, since the non profit is getting integrated, you would conclude that the operating margin is less and thus overall operating margin negatively impacted. I really dont understand the reason for the combination."
"Buyers outpacing sellers today, looking good. I wanna see this continue into tomorrow and end the week on a positive note. ($220 = Line in the sand)"
"CRM so good, even cramer isnt wrong on this one! lol"
This is just a steady machine gathering momentum. Next year we will see $200
I don't get how this is green while almost everything else is red. I am a long on this but I always wonder if this is insiders given earnings call is a week away or what?!
Close the gap. To $220. Anyone believe in it?
Who sold 138s 139s today. Please tell us.
The selloff is likely related to revised forecasts for the software industry in general:https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/software-stocks-fall-bearish-views-corporate-spending/
1 BILLION WILL BE INJECTED BEFORE END OF DAY
"This is CRM blog, please take your political comments some other place."
All time high. Quietly goes about its business and we profit. :))
should be up 3-6 points early tomorrow - I see the talking pros say the futures are wrong tonight and will sell off after a short rise tomorrow but I don't think so....Feb is known to be bad and with infrastructure coming and more liquidity I say we continue to be risk on market wise. Also bought CSCO Friday. Boolean
FX positive impact of $38M...without that would've just met and not beat....
Way overbought.
This will test 189
This flat day (while the market is roaring) is making your “revised price target” of $230 or higher by end of January tough isn’t is Zallyboy?
Absurdity still rules the market as CRM is the posterchild example. 7% earnings growth expected and a P/E of 60+. That's obscene. 7% growth deserves a market PE at best. 20 would be generous. that's a PEG of 3 which is rich. That puts CRM at around $60. Long way down to go......
This stock seems undervalued? Am I wrong?
CRM is a safe bet. short term as well as long term.
Buy back around 180
Asking all companies I am a shareholder in to step up and join the fight against this virus. I am stunned Marc Benioff has not stepped up
"GAVI, THE VACCINE ALLIANCE, COLLABORATES WITH SALESFORCE TO HELP EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTE TWO BILLION COVID-19 VACCINES BY THE END OF 2021"
"Yes ... let’s go CRM! This is just the beginning, huge upside. "
It’s a beat
short sighted investing produces short sighted returns....this is forming a huge buy with its outlook. Riding the wave down in tech makes this a real deal. Boolean
"Benioff out of country and it seems Steve Block will be holding the CC and will be on Cramer tonight. I think Block may be a better advocate to sell the Tableau acquisition, transition and benefits. The stock move on earnings will be all about Tableau, so we must hope CRM is extremely upbeat and positive about Tableau. If call is usual reporting then CRM may drop a bit.I felt a lot better this morning when CRM was around $152 going into ER, but I am banking the drop is more about the Fed comments on CNBC vs CRM fundamentals ER /expectations."
Yea thireee!
Already up from 205 to 231
Crm will have an announcement tonight on Mad Money per CNBC.
BUY BUY BUY BUY IM TELLING U BUY BUY BUY
This goes anywhere close to 165-160 i am in. Huge buying last year around 160
IBM miss. How will that impact the cloud space???
CRM reached a new All Time High at 134.13
ARKW has been buying the last few days. They’re not in for a day trade . ￼￼
"Jim Cramer on Mad Money last night gave a strong recommendation to buy Salesforce and Costco right now at this level and keep adding if you have it as this is a discount. ""And in both cases, history tells me that you've gotta buy them when they're weak,"" he said. TheStreet also has big upward guidance with new contracts signed with big Firms like AT&T which are long term deals for 20+ years. Cash flow will only increase. I am buyer Monday and hope to hit 200. Price targets are all over 200. Is this a no brainer since they are the leader in this field of cloud?"
How someone can spend so much time posting so much negativity on stocks rather than promoting great results on great stocks.
Raymond James raised pt to 200
Salesforce back on track. Glad i bought the dip
"Solid day so far, hoping to hold/extend gains until EOD."
Last 5 minutes insane price action! Shorts will pay on Monday!
"Don’t worry about the dip here, the NASDAQ is trending down as well."
"Lol! Allow me to paraphrase this message, “I was flat out wrong this year guys, so I’m going to give myself 365 days for things to (fingers crossed) to my way” Just waive the white flag already zally...smh"
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA the drop did shut up the longs real quick...they have nothing to say...crying in a little corner saying it doesn’t;t make sense...it should go up...how can i read charts so badly...and they probably will sell and buy something like a GME at $100...poor longs...you have no clue how to invest
"covered some of my short position at 214, gonna short it again when it hits 218"
PE in the stratosphere
P/E 168 = really. With slowing growth.
"Best company to work for. Great to the local homeless, lots of great deeds come out of successful companies hold for long term you will be rewarded"
"CRM made 4billion this Q, next 6 Billion"
Added 100 shares. Good discount
Keep calm and buy more some hedge fund are unloading doesn’t mean squat
We can possibly see new highs ￼ stay in it to win it.
Buying SNOW on Wednesday will be a circus. Buying some CRM today or tomorrow might be the next best thing.
Fishing......... 214.28. Will I snag it today?
The only thing that wasn't huge and for which projections dropped - GAAP earnings. Projected fiscal 2019 range brought down from last quarter's projection of $0.61 - $0.63.
Darn did it announce or not?
The potential of Slack is still misconceived by so many. That acquisition will be the marquee moment for salesforce when we look back 10 years from now.
Did a $154 flash on this AH?
"No support before 180, and then 160. Sell and short to SNAKE OIL MAN."
"Talk about a used car salesman. Greatest quarter ever, but we're going to lay 1000 people off. Shh, don't tell anybody and yeah I said we need to care about more than profits, but, but, this was the greatest quarter ever. And yeah, just because our yoy quarterly growth rate is going to decelerate to 16% next quarter from 30% this quarter it was still the greatest quarter ever. WOW!. Certainly worth a $30 BILLION BUMP TO MARKET CAP>"
"At these levels, $CRM is trading at more than twice what I’d be willing to pay for it. It’s overpriced acquisition of Tableau and Slack looks unsustainable. For goodness, both of them are / were one trick ponies."
Not even a tiny bit of relief 
"People taking some profits, knowing that regardless of how great the earnings are, CRM will drop tomorrow to $140, and buyers will swoop back in."
$198 here we come.
Earnings will be good!!!
Slack is a very nice addition to Salesforce. Investors better get their right mind together about buying Slack at 27.7 billion. Compare Slack with Okta valuation and you will see why. Slack was well established and continue to be more and more accepted by other software enterprises despite facing competition from MSFT. Slack still have a lot of room to grow and will grow even faster under CRM.
after hour low was $209
Dow jones could DROP deeply -$300.00 tomorrow when POWELL give speech on difficulty of economy recovery.... Sell and sell now ...before too late tomorrow....
"Happy Labor Day weekend, all. If you're in Florida, stay safe. Welcome September! Hear's to $160 and beyond next week!"
"I'm thinking you'll have to patient with this stock, it will probably melt up nicely over time."
$300+ by Friday. CRM was due for a run like this. Similar to all other similar Tech companies. Do not SELL. You will regret.
Anyone concerned about CRM giving disappointing guidance.
Time to buy now
Started dabbling in CRM yesterday. Let's make some money!
"Coming up to earnings, looking strong today along with the other software stocks. CRM has the strongest start today."
I love this stock as it is so under appreciated just like SNAP....and Upland Software...love those plays as they pay...even my little casino play Goldrich Mining/grmc has huge volume today on pending news of their mine evaluation....high risk high reward not for money u can't lose but for 3 cents a share I added again recently especially with the outlook for gold/silver...I may be wrong but...i don't think so. Boolean
"I started to buy back in at $140.50, could go lower, we’ll see. I say new highs by years end, chart says it all. $CRM, $SQ, $ROKU, $TTD, and a bit of weed, $MMNFF. All great stocks that could easily double within a year."
218 is a very good price to buy!! just bought 6k worth of shares.
lol.... sell the news
"great company CRM, always good at integrating acquisitions"
is workday (ticker: wday) in a bull or bubble market?
Earning will be awesome as well as guidance . They are capturing huge market . This is going to above 170 after earning
"No growth, and next VMW in making. VMW earns double than this, but no growth. Look at BIDU. CRM has 3.39 estimate for next 2 years."
"Didnt I warn you this would make twlo like move yesterday, shorts?"
THOUGHTS; My broker convince me to Short this at $276.50And says to cover at $235 in a few days because this momo is a lot of drive by daytraders like Robinhoodies who will take profits faster than “normal” traders. What do you guys think
CRM 2nd most sold stonk by hedge funds. The bleeding will continue.
Another 1% green by close. Long and strong
MSFT dropping...writing on the wall that Salesforce is coming after them.
Bout to turn green!
Listen Up good opportunity to buy in now!!!!
Investors know nothing!!! This is a buying opportunity!!!
"Whoever is foolish to short Salesforce at this low level deserves to lose the money that they will lose. This is the biggest, fastest growing SaaS enterprise in America that employs 27,000 people to run the company. They outperform and beat the estimates and guidance every single quarter by a longshot."
"Yahoo finance has the price target for Salesforce (CRM) at $273. That price is based on the average price target of 34 professional analysts. CRM is a great buy at the prices it's currently trading at. Buy shares and hold. Anywhere under around $230 is a good price to accumulate shares of this to enjoy the gains as it goes up to the upper $200's area. Whether you buy at $220, $225, $230, or even when this get back up to the $235 or $240 doesn't matter too much because all those will seem like they were a good price to have bought this at once it gets back up into the upper $200's. Good luck all!"
my mind is blown away I just read the ER again to make sure I didn't miss anything..... the ER and forward guidance is amazing definitely do not sell one share of this company! This is Gold and wayyyyy undervalued... I expect a nice pop of this stock soon.
>>> UP 11 % Today....AABB GOLD-backed Ethereum blockchain Cryptocurrency and CRM in the Green.
CRM reached an all time high at 192.46
Well I’ve been following along for a week now. Is it still worth jumping in before ER or to late?
How exactly is CRM paying for WORK if it goes through? cash? And how many crm stock do WORK shareholders get actually?
The GAAP numbers are shockingly low - should be closer to $50 / share ???
One trading day is good enough for great recovery from stagnancy !!300+ by summer !!
There it goes!! Will end at 145!!
Don’t sell!!! MM need your shares
"Drip, drip, drip. No real momentum here."
Ready and primed for bounce
Good time to buy crm
Ignore the noise and load up on a dip. $250 by the end of the Feb!
Four last consecutive quarters the CRM has beaten earning estimates. I am buying it before earning.
"190 this or next week. 200 in july, hopefully 210 in sept!"
I AM RICH $OKTA $LULU $SHOP $AMZN $CRM $ZM
Sad day for a once strong stock...now everyone avoids it
What’s going
Please advise what is a guidance? Sorry Im a new investor
in at close for a starter position 241.85 I like the story going forward.
$300 by December 31
Should be back up to 180 by next week. Lol can’t stop the cloud .
Go CRM as those Jan 170 and Mar 185 calls paying well!
the Citi ( I think Citi) $210 target is very reasonable
go baby go!
"What's everyone's PT for this company after earnings? Seems like $CRM wants to run higher, would love to see blowout earnings on Tuesday."
"Why SENS is so Revolutionary technology If you truly believe SENSEONIC is going to revolutionize CGM technology in a few years, then hold for long term. It is high risk, but very high reward stock. It could easily 30X from here, don’t pay attention to constant gyrations in the market. I always get inspiration from this Biomedical scientist who has been long term holder of Senseonic. If anyone would knows about CGM technology, it would be Biomedical scientist. He is also Founder and CEO of FibroGen, inc. A company 3 times larger then Senseonic.“I have to say I have been a long time believer in this Company and have been dumbfounded on why it has taken till now to finally be realized for its value. I am a Biomedical Scientist who helped to found FibroGen, Inc and I feel SENS has more to offer in the long run. Very important technology and an enormous market that needs this type of continuous monitoring. I was a speaker at a Juvenile Diabetes Medical Meeting in Dallas Tx in 1981 and the physicians were praying for something like the SENS technology to help Diabetics become healthier and safer. Now it is here and with future work to couple the sensors with a pump to deliver the correct amount of insulin you will have the dream that has been the Holy Grail for Diabetic Therapy for 45 years. I am happy to have found such a great company and I think they should go to $100 and beyond.“"
Let’s see how the stock does tomorrow. Nice to be positive on my biggest stock position.
"Sure feels like the next ER and conference call will be the watershed moment for CRM. Very manageable debt and great profit margin, but the stock still goes down. Vastly overpaying for Slack for $27.7 billion probably didn't help matters. Can't touch this stock at all until we see what happens after May 27."
2/21/2020 BMO Capital Markets Boost Price Target Outperform $220.002/21/2020 UBS Group Boost Price Target Buy $190.00 ➝ $230.00

run to 160 coming
About to head up soon people. I hope you bought the dip!
Just buy an sale go with th flow nothing is for ever not if you want to watch paint dry
CRM reached a new All Time High at 150.86
"CRM is a world class company at the center of the digital transformation. Analysts just can't get past the fact that they erased their cash position for Slack. Slack is what is holding CRM back, and will do so for the next 3-6 months. Once the acquisition is fully digested, CRM will fly."
Congrats to all holders.
Why in the performance outlook it's all red? I read a bit about CRM and their performance actually look great? Anything else aside from the WORK acquisition maybe being negative?
we are finally being treated the way we deserve!
Good price . Just bought 30 share and Jan contracts.
Is it better to buy slack or Salesforce? $WORK is way up and $CRM is down at the moment.
Where can I watch investor day? Also what time does it start EST?
what a great acquisition. We only dropped what...$11.00 this week.
looks like a short day 
Both CRM and WORK crushed the earning. We will be over $260 soon
Why the CRM stock dropped more than 5% today.. Not only because of the Twitter rumours?!?
"Greg M., who has appeared our of nowhere yesterday, is either a paid basher or has a short position and is trying to justify it to longs. I've ridden this baby up from the 80s and can take a temporary set-back, should there be one."
"U duffer's check my messages before earnings. I don't disclose my shorts, but I did by mistake. I see 160 support to 130."
Sold SLACK and bought CRM lol
crm $250 again by next week buy buy buy $300 by next year JANUARY BOOM RUN
This board was quiet all along and come results day it's lit up! Are we expecting good guidance?
"Look! 269, break even now lol"
i want to buy but i want a good price
Down 5% after beating top and bottom and raising guidance. This is an easy buy
Bullish $1000
The P/E of this is to high.
Just bough some put options.... certain this pop will fade regardless of how good this company is performing. Guarantee i will have an opportunities to buy back in below $130 before weeks end.
The last months stock action has made me feel much better about the future earnings. Finally starting a legit up trend.
Where's Mario? Flog
Options. imho the mkt makers are trying to decay the option premium as much as possible before earnings. maybe have paid up and will get eaten alive by their theta bill. 152.50 friday calls at $3.10 is kinda silly at this point if you ask me.30-40% drop in option premiums before crm has it's pop.
I would definitely hold. It could even turn green tomorrow
WTH is keeping this down?
"CRM is a sleeping giant ready to jump! One day soon I believe we could see a nice fast rise in a day or two to $230 plus easy. Give this a month or two, and it could easily be in the $240 to $250 range, if not even higher. Good luck all!"
Does anyone sees APT ever going back up? I bought 1000 shares at $32 and I feel I will never get my money back!
I think around $255 is the fair price to buy.The best bottom is $250.I have warned people don't buy and sell around $280-270.The research is free to you.Thank you and Good luck.
"I like CRM investors as they are not to crazy. So I will give you the next million dollar stock pick. I can't name the two companies, but they are in the battery recycling business. Very small now but expected to grow 10,000% Do your homework, and find these companies and reply to me . Winner gets 1 Bitcoin if right."
"what a reversal, on ER originally down 3.5% now turned around and up 4.0%. Tomorrow it will be very interesting....."
High/Low tomo?
Big huge money today!!! Upgrade and 190 target today!!! Follow big money and growth!!
"Let it rip tadder chip,On my way! 160"
Ready for a 5% decline. Time to snap up some puts!
"Thar she goes, starting the move up in earnest, along with all of the other cloud firms."
The next zoom
more dilution i feel for CRM. cash component will b very less
I bough CRM with profits from MRNA. Will hold it and not sell.I like the deal.
that 216 gap up from august is going to get filled. maybe this week would not buy until it reached it at least
Lower expectations for next quarter so they can hit it out of the park again. BTFD $$$
I love the pumpers. Thanks for the opt.
Fast Money Joe T. selling ADBE to buy CRM!Good Choice!
Tomorrow will be 250+ trust me guys
"Question for someone- how much does CRM compete with Amazon? If they do compete, to what degree? Thanks"
Great buying opportunity here. Visionary exec. Great suite of products. Bright long-term picture.
Any Idea how much their SNOW steak is worth now?
It seems like the news may have been priced in.
"They're so upbeat on this CC, they're gonna save the whole market. Lol"
"CRM is heading to 77 before earnings report, put your seatbelt on friends."
There will be a downgrade that is why can get traction. We have seen it before
good lord. glad I bought this morning
"CRM Great quarter, Great year, Great future ahead. No slow down in 2019.Best stratigy Buy, Buy, Buy on each pull back. It will make you rich."
End the week strong
"Take a look at Innovative Foods, IVFH, they grew earnings by 53% and still trading for a P/E of 6, almost debt free."
"IRONY is abound when it comes to the social warrior Benioff. Let me say I have absolutely no issue with the so called ""Holy Trinity"" established by CRM as it works and benefits their customers. Let me explain, according to Benioff at Dreamwork Conference he explained the ""Holy Trinity"" as gathering customer information in one place so clients can easily view their customers purchases/trends, desires/interests, stores visited and other data for better targeting. Now doesn't that sound exactly like what Benioff blasted FB for doing, capturing and selling data. Again, it is what a cloud based system should do to help their clients better understand customers, but it is dishonest to disparage FB and others with a holier than thou attitude. Just thought I would share the hypocrisy of this guy that leads CRM. I am a share holder but after ER will seriously consider selling because of the ""social warrior"" nonsense and ""hypocrisy of leadership""."
"Since the markets are already grossly overvalued, I'm certainly glad this earnings report didn't come out after Monday's Dow entry."
Great news and updates out of annual investor day today! Will gap up a few dollars tomorrow morning and then keep running up.
Shorts will get.....
"Not to bust anyone’s bubble you had your chance Friday, now going to be up 3-4$ premarket"
holding there at 269. I expect a run up soon
"CRM has lagged overall tech in general, so today's breakout is bullish and hopefully we see much higher prices from here by end of 2020 and beyond. Long $CRM"
"Looks like I’ll sell in 2030 for a $100 profit. Lol. Seriously, this is the worst stock in my portfolio and I own Carnival where no one is cruising."
Good time to add more. Ridiculous over reaction to a great acquisition that fills a need. Well done. Stock will come roaring back
"major break out by CRM...hold on tight, longs...on the way to $215"
Anyone else slaughtered on a 25o call for Friday ??
"All of my stocks are green Except CRM... SMH, such an eyesore "
Think this is going down to 210-212$
BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY MORE SHARES AS DROPS
Absolute gift under 150. Adding more to the position.
Don't fall in the trap. every quarter same story with big tech companies: hedge funds pushing the prices down as they know that companies will crush expectations and buy some days before earning release.
Buying CRM and IAC today. I love the management of both and I am a believer the stocks will make new highs.
Been long here a long time - could care less about a couple buck weakness. A lot of folks on here still clamoring for companies like CRM that grow like no other to have traditional valuation metrics — continue to clamor for that while the stock continues to the upside. Cheers.
just shorted another 100 shares aroung 225.7 .this is just cash printer
"When my company was forced to use Salesforce (a major company we represented insisted), my branch's sales not only declined, but my sales team was up in arms! They resisted, but our CEO threatened to fire anyone not using this system. I found that ""paperwork"" increased, sales performance declined. Personally, I didn't like having every minute of my day recorded, from the minute I clocked in, to restroom breaks, to lunch, to meetings...to everything. Management likes it because if a salesman quits, you have everything and everyone he worked with and worked on. When I left for my next position, I told the company I refuse to work for any company using any product or company such as Salesforce. I personally hope they crash and burn."
How is everyone doing here. I want to know about 280+ buyers. Everyone is OK?
$165 by the end of next week!
Beat and raise baby!!!!
WATCH HOW FAST IT WILL JUMP HIGH AFTER CALL
Bottom right here... i day we see 300 in the next few months
looks like there is no other stocks that I want to trade so ill just have to hold onto my 9 shares of salesforce (bought at $252). Ill give you 3 months salesforce to hit $285-$300
255 before earnings
"Guys, why it is not holding up today? going down to 269! Any negative news out there? Just couldn't find anything wrong going on"
"future is up huge. Hope this drives CRM to new ""high"". Good luck!"
This company hasn’t been bearish in over a year Lol to all the put contracts sorry guys this is gonna pop. Market taking a beating is the only reason it isn’t.
$315 soon per Goldman
Yes I agree it has been in a funk for a bit...But I think it will bounce back & Of Course...I wish it was a DRIP!!
"Cramer at it again, trying to save his sinking ship. Always promoting his ""book""."
CRM has Good decision buy slack .CRM should big troubles if in the case of MSFT merge slake.
ZI...Buyout target. Great combo with CRM.
Is this actually down 14 AH?
way overvalued here....going to 40
"Crm reminds me of Cisco prior to the crash of 2k .High valuations, everyone comes pump it up ."
Everyone calm down and look at the 1 year chart. Anytime CRM dropped they hit new highs within 30 days!
Thank you Mr.Benioff
"Doubled my position today (up to 8 shares now, lol). Love this stock, love the leadership and I cannot be more excited about the Slack integration. Salesforce is (for a lack of a better word) a force within the highly competitive cloud computing space and show no signs of slowing down."
Insider buying:https://tinyurl.com/y8k5kqy3
What an incredible opportunity!
yes....its official. Here we go CRM. Good long term core add.
Let's rock this thing higher....it has been sleeping for long enough - would be a great short squeeze as well. Boolean
"JPM telling me to sell crm just made me buy more call options. I’m bullish, buyers will start pricing in great earnings and then use the earnings to sel and I will do the same, expect consistent 2% days until dec 1"
Great times ahead. Holding long and strong!
Watch Markie Mark come on MM and crush it. He always does.
"Tomorrow, 230 or lower."
"43K short vs. 684.75Mil os, no body want to short this stock, why? what goes up must comes down..."
"I am the only one on this board consistently right, so here is what everyone needs to do right now, short CRM and buy puts - let’s flush this thing down 4-5 dollars into the close, thanks for lending me your shares longs"
$CRM at any price below $225 is a gift. Benioff and Co. will be a $1t juggernaut within the next 5 years.
thought it would bounce back earlier than that..
CRM rocket is taking off today!
I got a good feeling about SalesForce.
"Another dead money day for CRM. I expect tomorrow to be the same. Markets are closed on Friday. The week starting Jan 4 will be the tell. I worry about a lot of peope who have large gains on CRM in 2020, selling in early 2021 to rotate into other stocks. Lets see if the $220 support can hold next week."

We’re Headed North Again . Have a great Weekend Everyone!
Technically I want to buy 20% lower.Option chains suggest it will not go below 210.
Such a great result
"Keeps taking AH. Got in at 231.5, now I’m wondering if the Fast Money was right that it may retreat to 205-207."
Good buy at $95. I will wait until it reaches it's 52 week lows to pull the trigger on $CRM.
"MSFT CEO said the ""the second wave of digital transformation has begun."" CRM is central to the thesis."

Some insiders sold some pretty big blocks of shares before the earnings report. Oops!
"Salesforce price target raised to $210 from $205 at Mizuho""Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz raised the firm's price target on Salesforce to $210 from $205 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The company's Q1 results, while technically in line with Street estimates, were better than many had expected following generally mixed checks, Moskowitz tells investors in a research note. While guidance was lowered more than had been expected, management's targets are conservative, and will likely be exceeded due in part to an accelerating demand for digital transformation, Moskowitz tells investors in a research note.""https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3101839"
Buy and hold!
Will be red tomorrow around 1030 EST...doesn’t matter if it beats Watch
Tomorrow Future Tanking after hour who bought this stocks will lose $15 from after hour trade. Market going crash
If someone asks you why did you short CRM yesterday you can say:
"CRM breaking out of resistance in to a new, higher trading range today!"
"s h o r t s q u e e z e incoming! CRM shorts better cover soon. This is about to head back up the the $230 plus range very soon I believe. Later this week, or next week is my guess. Good luck all!"
Not even a bump at the end of the day. Not a good sign going into tomorrow
I am so glad I held on to this stock for quite some times. It went to the new high a week after a tariff war announcement. Amazing !
"Amateurs selling, then the smart money pours in and takes the shares off the armatures hands. Happens every ER with the weak hands across the board. That is why they are called weak hands. Hehehe"
CRM got around 10 upgrades this morning. PT ranging from $145 to $155.
In two months 190-195!!
Nice!!
What happens to the shorts when stocks go up? They always seem to disappear. Yesterday we couldn't get rid of em.
Believe the hype 200+
"This is getting beaten down for every acquisition. Just in 2 years Okta came from $30 to $244 and finally overtook CRM .. Okta a was $30 in 2018 Jan and CRM was $120s .. every time I look at CRM , it struggles a lot to make proper bull run. Not sure why investors are not seeing this undervalued stock"
Truist just upgrades CRM to BUY a minute ago !
PT $300 CRM will come back stronger than ever with Slack integrated.
Crm hasn't said enough in their defense. It makes you think they are guilty.
Holding this stock long and strong!
The market does not seen to like this deal. This may continue sinking over the next several trading days or weeks. Now vaccines bring market sector rotation. Could this fall below 185.00 ?
Can anyone recommend a safe profitable play going into earnings?

what law suit thiz is about the lyft ipo
"15 minutes before the close, I sold April covered calls in QS and used to money to buy calls in $AAPL, $MSFT, $CRM, $DIS on the weekly in case we get a reversal tomorrow. Little play for fun with free cash from the covered call."
Looks like it’s holding steady now so I went ahead and picked up 100 shares to take advantage of this uncalled for dip. This is just an earnings deal and an overreaction to the slack deal. It will be good for SalesForce long term. Good luck all!
I hope nobody panicked in the morning.
"Vaccine 's almost available soon this year, and CRM could be down horribly than everyone could imagine !This is the best time to sell for best profits !"
Time to cash in your call options now.
Added 30% today. We are getting closer to a strong rebound I can feel it.
Took one for the team guys. I sold this week and it jumped up the day after. You're welcome. (Bought Adobe and Activision instead so can't complain)
I’m excited to buy more will add at bell unless it starts moving up
"It has been doing yoyo these past weeks, but i am holding my shares as i believe that this company will worth a lot more in the next 5 years. Not adding nor selling, just hold."
First question I would ask Benioff at call today: Mind explaining how the deal with Slack got leaked out last week?
I won’t be overly optimistic.1. Market is shaky right now - investors will opt for reflationary OR value trades 2. This sitting at over 50x P/E with a weakening revenue growth does not help 3. Slack for 27B and a meager revenue means CRM will suffer in the short to medium term. 4. If the slack synergy doesn’t work out then this stock is dead
this name blows out eps and raises guidance and no sell side firm upgrades? insane
Should I get in before EOD?? Any thoughts?? It looks like with all the news and it seems this company is undervalued based on Barrons report... Trading at P/E Ratio of 98 instead of a regular 270
"I wonder if CRM is going above $230 by the end of the day today, or if we have to wait until Monday for that! Either way, no worries here. This is headed to the upper $200’s based on the professional analyst’s price targets."
Everyone is saying 120 but I say 125
"people thinking slack is a better buy, but if that is the case, why is the company at -0.37% at late hours, it should be ATLEAST up 2%, bullish for crm"
"Anyone with no shares, wait for 75 day test. Everyone else, hold tight and add to your position on that pullback"
"When did you go short Greg M.? The stock is holding up fairly well today, considering the other cloud/tech stocks are getting beaten. A good stock to meet your criteria is Astronova (ALOT). PE is only 30 and they are growing at better than 10%.Additionally they pay a dividend of almost 2%."
GOOD THINGS ARE BEING SAID BUY BUY
hope they discuss drop box in cc..... need some love there....
At the very latest when they beat earnings again and have a conference call promoting how well DATA has been received by the customers this will hit 200
"If you’ve been investing for a long time, you should know that this will pop any day now of no drastic drop in the market. It’s consolidating around 220, it wants to move higher, first move to $230 then $240 by year end, $250 in January"
"Does CRM open down $10, $15, or $20 ? Wow after that miss and disappointing earnings yesterday, today will be a horror show for this stock"
ARK just bought 90K more shares of this stock
"funny, the stock price climb history high, but the company cut people, where is the SEC, no one care the fake finance report?This is biggest crime for trump administration and FED to create such fake stock climb to make rich people to be richer, poor people and mid class to be poorer.See printing money will eventually go to debt, that is all tax payer need to pay for that, but why, this is not the fault made by regular people, same as 2007, regular people did not make the collateralized debt obligation (CDO) issue, we don't even know what is that, but we need to pay the price.Can you find anything more absurd than that?https://seekingalpha.com/news/3609085-salesforce-begins-job-cuts-after-record-earnings-wsj"
Bernie needs to announce 400mill buy back!!
Beat earning but acquisition of slack did not sit well with investors. Better long term.
Yes
Just as the deep state planned it. Take Exxon off the Dow and put Salesforce on with a p/e of 123.
Holy smokes I had a sell order and it almost got triggered. Happy it did not as I think we’re heading up up.
Picked up some Friday calls to play earnings. They seem underpriced.
"CRM called the CRM share price ""too rich"". Another mentioned 2019 slowing will cause some businesses to cut back in some systems, but Salesforce will be one of the last systems to be cut. So 6 of this, half dozen of that. Cramer made a good call on CRM sell off. If you like Cramer, see my Facebook group, ""ACTION TRADERS""."
Primed and ready for take off for earnings. Buy it
Institutions are betting big on Salesforce. https://www.marketwatch.com/story/here-are-the-biggest-stock-market-bets-among-institutional-and-retail-investors-ranked-2020-06-09?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo
Just bought datarama for 800 mill and the stock doesn’t budge
And uncke called it again!!!!
"This will start going up to hit new highs! Great earnings, raised guidance, and dream force is around the corner! Good luck longs!"
Buying CRM before earnings is free money
"Benioff needs to get back in the office and run the company and stop trying to impress his bizarre neighbors in CA/SF. He needs to read the books and memoirs of Jack Welch and others who always put the shareholder first. From discussing abandoning the buildings they just built there with shareholder money to continuously missing on guidance, he does not show the proper respect for shareholders for this investor. If he wants to be a philanthropist only then go do that... but apparently that recent CEO transition was also fouled up presumably at his hand. Money will be made here but Im no longer interested."
"I am working for Salesforce, it’s a good company, stable growth yoy and KPI driven management, coming slack acquisition, 300 eoy"
Nice insider selling spree......that pig Benioff lining his pockets all year like he knows his company is a pos and he needs to build his nest egg before the crash. must be nice
"Insane market cap vs. SNE with 8x the revenue, and $10billion in cash!"
"Gap fill from August, now there is an upside gap to fill. $240 will come back faster than you think imo."
Thank goodness this had good earnngs. I hope it can hold it now!!!!
Imbalance to the sell side at the opening....down $3 from yesterday....we could see sub $150 at opening!!!
"I think we should be able to break the $230 resistance level today! Lets go CRM longs!Once we cross $230, next stop will be around $240.... Let's do it!"
"Are longer term shareholders happy with the share price? Just curious because I invested $7,000 and I’m down 20% in 6 months "
I bought too soon 222.50 but thanks anyway :-)
The deals just keep coming I guess.
All major enterprises use SalesForce platform.
"Benioff went to Cramer wedding, im 100% positive Cramer will bless the stock."
"$150. picked up shares this morning pre mkt. I am not sure why they want to sell off shares because next q is lighter than expected, but hearing the guidance on rev for 2022 is what matters to me. i bet you see crm reverse to ++ this morning and trade $157.50-158 today."
I think CRM and TWTR makes a great marriage and will propel the company to compete better within the cloud and social media space. Could this be back on the table???
CRM goes up quickly after a correction. Look at the chart. By December 30 going above $250. Don't be surprised. It's one of the investors top picks.
Just when we gain momentum again the market sentiment reverses.
Max out156
Stocks skid on Friday amid setbacks on U.S. fiscal relief package and Brexit.. The whole market is being affect by this. I'm hoping CRM would go back up next week...
crm is creating a nice buying point
Upgrades rolling in.
"08:27 AM EDT, 03/27/2019 (MT Newswires) -- Salesforce.com Inc (CRM) is being sued by 50 women who allege the company helped Backpage.com despite knowing ""of the scourge of sex trafficking because it sought publicity for trying to stop it,"" according to several media reports. The company was the ""vilest of rogue companies, concerned only with their bottom line"" for allegedly helping Backpage, the lawsuit claims, according to the reports."

Come on investor day! Do something. Just $1 gain to much to ask!
$300 EOY. Who agrees?
"217.00 is my next target buy, GLTA"
"Bears are out today...Careful! After hours tomorrow, up $30, very skillful CEO!!"
"IDK, do we all join hands now and say three Hail Marys?"
"Finally, CRM is ALIVE! "
"Implied move AH is 3.8%, - > 177 - 192"
CRM held strong today. You can see it’s going strongly outperform on the next market rally.
I'm really not impressed with this acquisition. My friends in tech tell me that Slack just ain't that good.
Great opportunity BUY on DIP today..Buy Buy buy...
I’m buying in today was a bit out of my price range but can’t pass up this price and the future growth has huge potential
"I'm new to investing. I bought CRM at a higher price and now it keeps dipping. I still believe in the company although I'm quite disappointed with its perfomance for now. Hopefully, it will pick up soon! I really don't want to sell at a much lower price. Should I hold?"
good grief like watching paint dry
Wow
well sold today happy sold half stock

One does not simply daytrade this stock
Ah so the selloff was due to large insider share selling.
buying at the opening.
what happened to all CLOUD stocks ? $NFLX $ROKU $VMW $CRM
$230 target by Friday. Shorts in panic. Keep accumulating.
"Incredible that crm is almost as big as ORCL. Marc is the man and soon the ceo of a company is bigger than orcl, less than ten percent to go. Go Marc ... will hear what Larry will say."
"I would like to offer predictions today.Big tech’s dominance is finally over. Their decline began in 2020 and in a few short years they’re going to be in a free fall as the public confidence in them rapidly erodes. A major realignment will take place and MICROSOFT is going to emerge as the dominant leader because of a spectacular growth in its revenue and profitability. Coupled with the fact that CEO Nadella is a level headed person focused on Microsoft’s growth and not activism, investors will see the value in its stock. I believe even more investment will flow into the $MSFT stock starting this year.My prediction for other stocks:1 Investors will start realizing that $AMZN’s valuation is significantly higher than its peers. I believe the stock won’t surpass the ATH it saw in 2020. It is quite likely that the stock price may decline during 2021.2 $AAPL stock will likely grow higher during 2021, but its high flying days are over. Apple car is just a concept and it will be several years before a physical product is launched. In the meantime, Tesla Cybertruck and a possible low priced car may already be in the roads, thereby making Tesla the undisputed leader. It will be very difficult to penetrate its market. I see no innovation from Apple and investors will see that too.3 Stocks like $GOOG, $FB, $TWTR will likely stagnate and commence MASSIVE declines. I expect that regulations by governments around the world will act as catalysts to their decline.4 Other tech stocks like $WDAY, $NOW, $CRM will likely have more realistic P/E."
"CRM always sells off on earnings, I think there is 0 risk on shorting here"
String will be release soon so the kite can fly higher ...Wall Street usual games ...if you one valuation it’s a no brainer
"Several price target raises on CRM today:-- Morgan Stanley Raises Price Target from $180 to $197 maintains ""Overweight""-- Credit suisse Raises Price Target from $175 to $185 keeps ""Outperform""-- BMO Capital Raises price target from $188 to $190 keeps ""outperform""https://rivertonroll.com/news/2019/12/04/morgan-stanley-raises-salesforce-com-nysecrm-price-target-to-197-00.html"

"First time posting on Yahoo. I've had this app for years and read all, but I've never posted. Question for those who might be long in this stock = realistically, what is expected vs. previous trends relating to earnings on Tuesday? Truly appreciate honest responses in advance."
"hallo im new on this channel, please someone can explaine in shortly why CRM down ao much from 290? just to understand if i made a good cheking"
When all the other cloud companies are trading 900 × forward PE...CRM trades 58 × forward PE... institutions are ready to gobble this up by the year end.
Bet we end the day in the green.
"Why do Liberals always feel that throwing more money into a problem will solve the issue at hand? As the good Liberals in San Fransicko spend more money on the homeless, the numbers increase and only grow worse. Marc should house some of them at his Presidio Heights compound."
Salesforce is the next Microsoft.
Only one cheap stock in the market..
CRM is over value stock. I should not buy it. everything PE is over 20 that's overvalue. not good for long term. short term traders are okay with it
Still holding long 85 shares.
157 tomorrow
Wow that was a quick sell off from where it was trading premarket
"Hey D Why don't you go to another board ,you making a fool out of yourself"
Double Dip! I still like the flavor
"Nasdaq up 1.3% CRM opened up higher and now dropping g quickly...only unless than 0.90% HAHAHAHAHAHA This is so weak...gave all the longs false hope. Sorry longs but this is heading MUCH MUCH lower...it’s one thing to touch $230...it’s a whole other thing actually holding onto it. This is crashing hard again...you had your little run, but the charts never lie...it’s in a bear trend and that’s it! CYA at $220 soon....CIAO for now...PUTS will print Money this week for sure."
"Of all the stocks I put my money here, not so smart after all "
not that great of close.
"Guidance is strong. Solid, consecutive earnings. Justifies a fair PE with the rest. Up we go!!!!"
momentum still isn't there yet. hopefully in 2 hours it will be.
at this price crm is a bargain
"IMO,Earnings will beat and guidance will be on par with rest of the cloud world..thats good enough for a 10% jump"
I’m a little disappointed by today’s movement. Let’s see how tomorrow goes.
Finally some movement up!!!!
Namasate. Thank me later just look this up and when the stock haulted clears Monday instant 200% gain maybe more
I don't think you should have a third of your holdings in any single stock. I have about 10% here and I sleep well.
Growth is decelerating According to WSJ. Those buying are getting slower growth at a higher price. Sell now muppets
All the folks not in sales love this... track track track. Be a low cost provider and make good product we can sell. A chart does not sell sh......
208.87 -- BOTTOMISH. Boolean Time to buy this price
Chart looks great
insider activity sold 40000+ shares in just 2 days
"Google, Lamborghini etc... all use Salesforce..."
Take out the investment gains and GAAP earnings were ($0.05). Why is this stock over $50? Cramer influence?
"All the cloud stocks are up today, as if Salesforce's success is due to external factors that favor any company with a SaaS product or some cloud stuff . In most cases, Salesforce's growth is lost business for the others."
This is such a dog!!! So many better opportunities out there to make money in the long side.
Goldman PT @ $315. About time!
I remember people saying it would be $225 today. Still laughing at that

this was a losing deal for CRM. They probably did it to avoid competitors from buying it
FROM HERE WE ARE HEADING TO 276-277
Any Predictions for ER tomorrow at market close?
"I sold this stock! it is really a smoke and mirrors; Had to borrow money to buy Slack! I like Companies that have the cash! I think people are better off with Amazon, Apple, Google, or Microsoft! I tried! too much pain!"

"First time in a looong time, CRM seems vulnerable due to market conditions. Taking some profits. When good times roll, even these outages etc will be just noise. Hard to see my portfolio without CRM flashing in the interim. Best of luck :)"
Im long and strong with CRM.
Load while u can.. this will easily cross $280 
ZI...oh yeah...
Shorts getting fried repeatedly. They seem to like losing money.
I think first 210 and start climbing I’m bullish but looks want to close the gab first
Just curious...how do any if you feel good about buying a stock with a PE of 240?? Yikes.
market cap go down that Slack is for free. I sell Netflix and go in CRM! I love Slack ist is a good Deal but the most CRM shareholder have no plan about Slack ! I own many Slack shares and go loooong with CRM !
Stock is approaching a breakout.
What happened to the shorts 
Oversold
300 by lunch time!
It'll go back up soon but not until it goes below 200. Those that sold WORK to buy lots of shares of CRM are now learning their lesson.
This will be north of $500 by December
this is crazy.........
I bought some at 220. What's the next good entry point to add more stocks?

I think this company is only doing the right things .Very impress with Marc. Benioff .
This run is over folksHow do you know ??Underperformance after a good report !!Closing below 200 MA is your first sign.At a pe of 100 this could really drop. Target price 100
$CRM is much of a long. I like it but dropping out to get into shorter gains then will come back
Should be UP to at least $245 anytime soon by tomorrow..with its great EPS beats 132% and beat revenue as well with good guidance for full 2021... it is a creaming BUY today on once for life time opportunity...
"Ok, I loaded my truck today... lets get this train running...!! "
No matter! This will never hold...it’s done this before to $227 and then quickly dropped to $213...this time it didn’t make it that high so I expect it to drop to about $210 or below! Have a good night and be careful!!!
"I got in a few weeks ago willing to average down but jesus, yall need to calm down. It was a good earnings call but a 25% increase? Def not"
"Base Case $270 Per MS: Sustainable robust revenue growth boosted by M&A. Seat counts expand in Sales & Service Clouds, while App Cloud & Analytics offerings become material. Slack contributes mid-single digits to revenue but is margin dilutive in the near to medium term. Revenue grows at a 18.1% CAGR from FY22-27e & FCF beneﬁts as op margins grow to25% by FY27. We expect CRM to trade at discount to large cap peers on consolidator growth story, and value shares at 26.5xEV/FCF in FY27 discounted at a 8.4% rate"
225$ today
the worst stock ever
CRM just needed an excuse to pullback a bit. I’m sure the uptrend will continue tomorrow.
Beautiful recovery from the pre-market jitters!
"With awful earnings, why is this still over 200??? I don't understand... Look at NVIDIA amazing earnings and what happened after earning."
"Sorry shorties, this really should be against the Geneva Convention ! haha......GO CRM !"
"Just take a long, and I mean long look at this company and chart. besides one base @70-80 in 2016 this beast has been a buy on the dips and off to new highs. Now compare it to NVDA. see the difference when and where valuation and growth matter? Sales Force is now where near the slow down or topping out and new base like NVDA. I think we have 2-4 more years of dominating growth before we base out. I realistically revisit my work every quarter to confirm if anything has changed. The new co-CEO is keeping my attention close. GLTA"
"It's time for CRM to begin its rebound, which it did in a nice way today."
We should be at least at $224 today. But here we go again selling off. Geeze!!
"Buying opportunity here folks to get some CRM at a discount! I bought yesterday, but I just added more to double my position and lower my cost basis per share."
This has no support at all until $180...you’ll see.
Appears as if all the D's are short.

CRM to the moon  $165 end of week
I’m finally in 648 times. Better late than never
$300 by the start of 2021. Continues to blow away earnings expectations.
CRM was just discussed on CNBC as Stock Pick of the Week. Najarian said high options were traded when price was $128. Then said there were rumors about CRM going around.....does anyone know what he is talking about.....WHAT RUMORS?
"If you look back at CRM chart, you will see when it hits $220, it bounces quickly to $240 and on to $260 plus. I think we will see $260 before December 31. ""Let the good times   roll."""
"Beautiful deals. I doubled. Looking to triple, will see end of day or tomorrow. FYI, don't do this with a small cap speculative play though...those companies can be shady and go bankrupt."
Some believe SALESFORCE will sink now....NOT SO. I submit it will build as it has been rather stagnant and a bit under appreciated. I will watch the chart closely next week. I am in at 226 Friday as my lower prices did not hit -- but the upside is in the mid 300's so any random walk first is OK with me....I don't fear buying great companies early I fear not buying it at all. Boolean
"Salesforce employees don't want contracts with the immigration department.. I would not test this president, Trump will put Salesforce on his blacklist and bar them from all government contracts. Be careful what you wish for..."
Remember the 3 day rule.
"I see the bot ""Uncle"" has now infested your board. It's been around for a year or so, showing up on various boards until enough people block it. It was on Tsla for a while, calling for it to go to zero, then it went up 600 percent and it disappeared. Block it and complain to Yahoo and eventually it will go away. And good luck with CRM, I've traded it in the past and worked with the them here in the Bay Area. Good company."
CRM talking about deplatforming people probably cost them a little today
Where was sales force per share prior to 4q earnings release and what did it do after release was announced ?
Picked up 20 shares at 248. Not much but just to begin a position.
Crm buys slack =350 easy
Honestly I’m starting to think if we didn’t have so many new iPOS’s we’d be back by the highs already

"Weeeeell... $CRM + $WORK... creates a dynamic to which $MSFT might want or even need to react...

I'm just allowing myself to go off on theories I don't really believe in - just for the fun of it!Happy Thanksgiving! #StaySave & #StayHealthy!"
I highly doubt this company will sustain with their political views and censoring customers. I will be here to see it fall.

In addition to SF's track record of delivering up to earnings' expectations, it is also not hard to predict the billings and pipelines in Q3 as the CRM sales are in direct correlation with the market optimism. When optimism are high in Q3, more demand for CRM from newly IPO companies worldwide, corporate expansions and existing companies upgrade needs with relatively loosen IT budgets during good times."
"CRM beats earning, will touch $275 soon."
Slightly scary when a company like this can't figure out how to increase capacity on the conference call. How can it be full?
"Smart money like I said is buying. There is not one single large cap tech stock that is cheaper, certainly not with Salesforce growth or even remotely close. IBM is dead money."
233 now!
ouch
"So many recent PT increases & Outperform ratings, CRM will hit those $180 targets before EOY. Time to buy more."
OH GOD CRM JUMPING AFTER HOURS
"220-235 PUT volume for tomorrow running at just over 1,000 traded today; 240-255 CALL volume at 3,600 or so traded so far today"
"Folks, $220/share is the last line of defence (""support"") for CRM. If that breaks, we're headed to $210/share. We are now all hanging off the precipice by a strand of straw :("
Looks like back to 218 and the roller coaster ride goes on
Tomorrow looks like it's going to be another stellar day!!!
"entire market just dropped, great buying opp."
Here comes the breakout amigos. On to $200
Way over-valued....get ready for the plunge. 135 Wednesday ...maybe 125...
"Lots of expectations lots of positivity, I took a lotto play put just for fun. Goodluck everyone."
"Historic chart of CRM said ""dropping up to -$40.00 following record high in next few days....""...Wait and see...it's obviously seen on the chart...Sell before too late..."
"Beat earnings, raised guidance!!! Going to go up and up"
"Raised FY 22 Rev, but lowered EPS"
well i sold today happy at this spike
Years of gains in one day a complete bubble and dow listing will cause it to underperform like ibm for years!!!
Heading to $100
So CRM lost over $40b in market value for the acquisition of Slack for $27b !?! The premium it paid is round about $10b. Looks like this oversold/over reacted quite a bit and CRM should adjust upwards. I speculate that CRM should rebound to reflect a market cap of ~$250b. That's a 15% gain from here.
Money printer goes brrrrrrr
Ok so I just ran my pricing model using transaction by transaction buy vs sell volume and the options action today for the next 8 weeks- the verdict....price down $3.7-$5.20 tomorrow
"Time will show that CRM acquiring slack was an awesome deal! Don’t listen to the shorts who only want the price to go down. This is the bottom and will head up from here. And once it starts heading back up, it will happen quickly I believe. Get in on the dip now, or you’ll just pay more to get in later! Good luck all!"
look at that 3 month chart! straight down!
"Short on every pump..It's not going to stay over 200. I repeat 200, and no support before 180."
My long bought moment ago is up now :)
no way
CRM is down 4.92% to $128.85
$280 by September
Next stop $98...
"breaks 175, next stop 180"
Why is this stock under performing so badly?
greatest buy point here! Buy Buy Buy..
"The money switching from big techs to value stocks in the last few weeks is based on an assumption that everything is going back to normal because of the vaccine. Now people face the reality and understand that the pandemic is a longterm problem. The best strategy of investment in the current condition is to buy companies that have been approved to be pandemic resistant, and CRM is one of them."
What a ...
"CRM has had subpar performance loosing its shinning coat, i will dump once earnings are posted, will move on to ""green"" economy related which will boom in the next 4 years of donkey party control"
"I read somewhere Pelosi soon to be ex husband bought a bunch of shares , I hope he doesn’t have to split them with her , even if she did give him insider information!"

Selling good stock and buy cruise and airline which are leaking money
Any one have a link to the earnings?
Is DBX are buyout target?
Time to take profits if you have them. Software has been running high and there will be institutions selling because once the position gets to high in value they have to pare it down not to get too heavy with one stock.
You can make up your losses buying YY. It just beat on earnings and is still quite undervalued.Many US stocks were getting frothy anyway. The other nice thing about YY is that the percent of the float that is short is above30%...it should make for a nice short squeeze in the coming days.
But... but.. the shorts said this was going to open at 145????
$500 soon load
"Of course the IPO parade doesn't help, now it's CHEWY!"
Does anyone remember the last time this thing was green?
Lots of angry shorts losing money tonight seem to be filling this board. I’m laughing
Why no love for us?
"Why did you buy the stock? If you did your homework, why would you sell?"
"I hope next week one of these companies ($DIS, $CRM, or $GOOG) will acquire TWTR."

For long term it seems to be very good investment about AI
$CRM is trading side ways. An other SaaS partners with $CRM. Look up $MDLA. It’s got legs in 2021. Up 20% YtD
wow! can't believe it that crm has market cap bigger than oracle. just wondering how allison and marc feel about this? congrats crm.
Should be $300+
"CRM investors meeting August 29, 10:30 AM Pacific time."
I see an pop 50 box by december 31
can buy at any price. hedge funds are crazy about cloud stocks. they will pump to new highs again.
I don’t know why people are not more excited about CRM. They are doing amazing and always beat the market
"Looking at the report, seems solid though. Guess I was wrong"
Salesforce Outage. Servers down. Not good.
"it's priced for perfection at around ten times revenues. The outlook is good, but not perfection. Why wouldn't the stock return to 100 or 90?"
"Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) reported Q4 EPS of $0.70, $0.15 better than the analyst estimate of $0.55. Revenue for the quarter came in at $3.6 billion versus the consensus estimate of $3.56 billion."
wow great news on the increase in eps for 2020
I have 150 stocks at 225.5$ . Should I hold on it or the stock might go even down. Please suggest. I am newbie almost
Guidance for futureAmazing so were earnings go buy Tesla at 500 years profit lol
Slack is one of the Fastest Growing B2B SaaS Business..... Great management about to pull off another great acquisition!!!
CRM reached an all time high at 169.33
PE may not be a guide but is a measure of expectation and it could be that this has gotten ahead of itself. Earns will need to be Amazon quality to go up.
"Great earnings, except for one tiny little thing that doesn't amount to much....other than a reason to slam the stock"
I’ll wait to buy after the drop tomorrow morning when they report.
"This one is sweet. Must have. Buy and hold long, long, long."
"All stocks are down, until the market finally gets going again. If it were only this one, then you can say it’s you and your choice. Out of 43 different positions, I had 4 in the green. 39 were , but I spent 5k adding on others that are on sale. This will pass and you better be in it to win it. GLTA"
Loading up de boat today. This is a growth stock. Lets all look back in 10 years when its $1000. Long and strong
"So funny to me that if a company crushes it every year but one little quarter, they do OKAY and all these short term investors lose complete confidence in the company and act like it has no future. MOTION TO MOVE EARNINGS TO BE SEMI-ANNUAL!"
Love CRM and PLAN
"This is next zoom, netflix and nvidia type of growth but delayed vs those 3"
Why is it down?
Buying this fear. Easy money imo
Does anyone else notice that stocks tend to perform better when companies under forecast (or conservatively forecast) and then surprise at earnings? Video game companies have been doing this for years and years and it seems other companies are now realizing this is effective.
"if you bought yesterday your lucky, but if you havent today is the last oppurtunity to see such a great stock at discount"
This stock will be a long term winner. Buy the dip
I will buy this every day it dips no problem. Its undervalued at 230 let alone 215. Look forward to ridinf this out for the next few years
Relax and buy more
"CRM is cheap compared to MS, GOOG....CRM is growing like crazy in business software. In the Covid world, all companies need to go e-commerce to stay relevant. CRM makes that easy for them since they already have the customer data. No where to go but up."
Wowza! What’s the news???
CRM reached an all time high at 176.00
"Is CRM fighting a losing battle with MSFT?? There appears to have been a falling out between the two when Benioff backed outof a deal with Nadella and demanded a price higher than the about 50% premium he was offered. At that point the war was onas Benioff left Azure for AWS and Nadella doubled down on Dynamics CRM. Since then Nadella bought Linkedin, beating out Benioffand Benioff has made acquisitions to further compete with Msft. Let's see, MSFT has 9 x's the market cap and over 100 Billionmore in cash than CRM. CRM does not make much money and depends on its stock price to compensate employees and make deals.Linked wanted cash and would not accept CRM stock. If investors begin to sense that CRM is overvalued, it will lose its main bargaining chip. Benioff is going to have to put up one helll of a good fight to compete with MSFT. MSFT has the money, manpower, expertise and experience that might make Benioff wish he had sold to MSFT when he had the chance."
What a joke. Benioff is up all night texting and he's so health conscious because he puts on his fit bit every morning. I'd bet he couldn't even run a 10 minute mile. So funny that someone thinks that wearing a fit bit somehow makes you healthy. Just goes to show.
"I get shorting $NKLA hell even $LMND, but $CRM? You’re gunna go against Benioff and this Ohana? That’s a bold move. Good luck to all the longs who know the true value of this behemoth "
"Buy SNOW, and PLTR. The great companies and TSLA."
"Will drop to 133, then come back after few months"
quick rise ....whats the volume ?
"This is probably the best stock to day/swing trade. I have already made a few thousand dollars in the past few weeks day trading it. Here's why:It trades between $219-$225 outside of a few days where it dropped to $216 and went up to $230. So, it's essentially in this range until next earnings come out. If I buy at $221 for example and it drops to $219, I hold and wait until it goes back up to $222-223. Easy quick $300-400 play. Contrary to what ""UNCLE"" (or any other short seller here) says, CRM is not going to drop to $180 or even $200 unless there is a market meltdown again. I don't think this will happen, even if Democrats take the Senate. Maybe there will be a 5-7% selloff but that's it. There needs to be a REAL catalyst to move the market. And, with the Fed in control, I don't see a meltdown happening. Also, too much money is waiting on the sidelines to buy the dip. People are buying every dip. Is this healthy long term? No, certainly not. But, remember: for every bubble there was, it took a minimum of 3 years for it to pop (2008 and 2001 as most recent examples). We've only been in bubble territory now for, at most, 2 years. I'm going to continue riding this train.But that isn't even the main point. CRM is a large cap tech stock with a real product and real revenue. They are also best in class in their industry. And, they grow consistently YoY. A stock like this doesn't just drop by 10-20% unless there is *REAL* negative news that the market doesn't like. The Slack acquisition already happened. Beinoff said there will be no more acquisitions in the near future. The stock already fell more than 20% from Slack. What's going to be the catalyst for another 10-20% drop? Stocks are assigned value by the market. Unless there is news, stocks don't just drop 10-20% on nothing unless EVERYONE sells. Most people are not selling. In fact, people keep on buying. Look at ARK. As of january 5th, they own $50M worth of CRM stock. On January 4th, they owned $47M worth of stock, so they increased their position in CRM by $3M in one day. That's just one fund.The point is unless there is *REAL* negative news, CRM isn't likely to drop to $180-200. Shorts are playing with fire on a large cap tech stock with YoY growth and on a stock that has already dropped roughly 23%."
"Was thinking selling all my 100 shares premarket, but got a bit greedy. Now regret."
"It feels good to be proven right time after time on CRM, but I am modest so I won’t gloat, longs GET OUT NOW sell quickly before you lose all your money- you are welcome and you can buy it back for $110-113 in a few weeks"
Looking forward to hear the good news from Benioff in a bit!
Crm is simply the best
"I bought this at $160 a share, should I hang onto it?"
"Added to my position. if someone wants to bet against Benioff, good luck. I'm definitely not"
Crm solid as a rock here. Holding strong on down day. Lock and load.
can we reach $179 eod??? YES.
Cya under 20$ a share BAGHOLDERS
Bought in at $145.00. Guess I will see... Maybe I shouldn’t look for the next 3-5 years.
Haha wow after todays price action in the industry you'd think CRM was poised to deliver the proverbial nail in the temporary trading coffin.. wrong. Great numbers; solid guidance. Buy beaten down names in industry

"Karen just bought, oh yea a leak from ex hubby Jim Cramer"
"People may not realize that Salesforce, a startup, consistently took market share from giants like SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft throughout its history, and it still does. Why is that? Because it was and is better. The Salesforce product line has always had a single software architecture (""force.com""), a single database, a single UI, a single set of APIs. A single way of reporting. A single set of logs. etc etc. That reduces costs and training. In addition, that architecture is far better in customization, and in reliability, and in integration with other systems. Oracle does not re-architect the systems that it buys when it does an acquisition, it just adds another little data silo to its product line. Salesforce fully integrates what it acquires. More and more, what it acquires are systems that already run on force.com, and features (Wave, Einstein) that apply to the entire product line. Consider the recent announcement of Einstein for Service Cloud. Didn't take long! That's good architecture. Still, I agree that MSFT, IBM, Oracle, and others are potential threats. But they are quite far away from what Salesforce has already built. Throwing money at a problem may or may not make something better. Going forward, the others may balk at doing all the investment that Salesforce already has done. The others lack the premium pricing and market share (revenues) that Salesforce enjoys, so the spending is more painful. The others also may realize that the Amazon partnership furthers disadvantages them in direct competition. They may choose to allocate their capital in other areas, ones in which they have some sort of advantage. My guess is they will keep talking big, and probably manage to move their legacy customers to their cloud products, but they won't pony up big bucks to battle seriously against Sales Cloud or Service Cloud."
made over 5 grands by shorting this bubble . thank you BAGHOLDERS
Stick is bouncing back nicely... something is cooking guys!!! Buy now at a bargain price.
SNCR easy x3 in a year
Sold my position on DATA and AYX in order to buy CRM.
"Imo, salesforce is leveraging its company’s position for the long term. (5-10yrs.) Recent acquisitions of Mulesoft, Tableau, and potentially Slack, will translate to phenomenal disruptive growth for the next decade and then some. These are moves made to stand strong during the next business cycle."
"we already caught the bottom, charts are bullish, amazing buy."
I once read on this board CRM is a trading stock after earnings. Sell high after earnings before it goes down and buy back later. Any truth. Thinking about simply going to MSFT
Why did it went down?
CRM 's oversold...It's a screaming BUY now...just loaded more shares for great return next weeks...
"Has anyone ever used MS Dynamics. It is the least intuitive CRM I have ever used in my sales career. At my last company, nobody knew how to use it, even after training. It's an ugly, clunky, obtuse piece of software. Salesforce, by comparison, is a dream platform for sales people and management. Everything about it makes sense and is easy to use. Anybody who has used both will tell you the same."
Seems like we’ve been in limbo for ages. Guess I’ll add again if this touches 205ish again.
I heard Mario's ex is the ceo of salesforce
Who's dumping CRM for the last 3 days non stop?
"wow, the censorship is amazing nowadays..."

Next leg lower today... 210.... 200 ...? What are the support levels
"I am losing tons of money on pltr, but my short position of crm looks good"
rsi at a 30
did not raise guidance profit taking for the most part.
"CRM, BABA and FB. Currently, all have some drama about them, but all three will rise heavily in due time."
worth investing in it tomorrow??
You can’t own this stock anymore after hearing Benioff the CEO speak about crazy stuff. He doesn’t seem to care about the company. Board needs to step in as this stock is going down with his words
"Trump's rally is over very soon and just wondering how crm will stand in sell-off environment. Also, other concern for the short and medium terms is insiders are releasing their holdings. Crm does have upside but limited due to recent run but the downside is much bigger at the moment. Just my 2 cents. Good luck to all and happy trading."
"I went all in 30K, this is the bottom ..."
Know this stock is borderline cult. Overvalued. Don't follow it but had a hunch. Bought 50 call contracts at 129 expiration 12/21. Do I sell them all tomorrow? Sell half and keep half ? Or hang in there.
"I just bought today, confident for long term"
i have call shares expired tomorrow at 150 strickhow much will be my precentage gain tomorrow if this open at 160?
Solid AH action. Any drop will be short-lived and then turn into a rally when shorts start covering.
"THIS IS CHEAPER THAN NVDA, TSLA, APPLE, AMAZON WORTH ALOT MORE"
Getting this stock at a good discount now
I see solid upside here so glad to hold/add....did sell Square too early and won't do it with this one..also added with PSTG and OPEN....both look like solid emergent plays. Boolean
@Jared check out my post on Webull for bft lol modified position 
this reporting today?
We will be taking out the old high within a month imho
A lot of hate by the analysts on the deal. I think its a positive....nobody is talking about other slack core customers like AMZN who love the product
"Look at the insider activity....upper management is selling consistently...if they really believed in their company, wouldn't they not want to sell and wait for the execution of the growth plan to play out??? I don't want to hear about diversifiying their portfolio...yes, you don't want all eggs in one basket, but to be consistently be selling doesn't show the confidence in their stock...."
This is one to keep buying and holding for the very long term. Great company. Only going up. I see us around $300 end of year.
HERE COMES THE CONFERENCE CALL U SEE HOW FAST IT GOES UP WHEN IT IS OVER WATCH AND SEE
"Benioff's comment ""tech won't redeem itself in 2019"" is purely irresponsible and inappropriate....does he forget CRM is in the same tech industry. This on top of his outrageous and unsolicited comments on FB last week is turning me off on the stock and his leadership. These CEO's that feel that it is their quest is to comment negatively and weigh in on issues or companies not in their purview is getting ut of hand. How about this FOCUS ON YOUR BUSINESS AND STAY OUT OF THE MEDIA LIMELIGHT. Over 35% down and too busy to comment on his own company. I am starting to think that a measure for my future holdings will also consider that stocks that are lead by Activist CEO's or are MEDIA HOGS will be a SELL."
You are kidding me right? Low of the day right now for CRM?
"Having used a service such as CRM I can say from experience you become dependent on it and very difficult to stop or transfer to another service. That being said the value of the first mover is crucial. Increasing market share at the best price, advertising, acquiring similar companies to broaden base or add services to attract new clients, is of the most importance. Being AMZN in this space is what they are trying to do. And the space is huge! Mom and Pop to Fortune 500!"
Bulls would think that today jobless claims basically told the government to not just talk but they must pass it too.
"Seems like we're stuck in the mud, oh well great year looking BIG picture here"
"Closing out some of my HUGE short profits to buy some fiver, the fiver IPO looks great, anyone long CRM should sell all their stock, short half the money and take the other half and get long fiver"
"i knew it was gonna go +5% shouldda trusted my gut, kicking myself.in the foot right now"
I cant seem to wrap my head around this drop after an amazing beat on earnings and revenue... and usually bad outlook is what drops it if that wasnt good enough yet they raised guidance
A shocking report and bad news for investors.
Rebound $15-$20 by AM. Green comin!
Crm has never been a big mover. organic growth has stopped. Barely turns a profit. Paid dearly for slack and tableau. wish shares would get to mid 230s so I can cut my loss. I have owned this before and it is not respected on the street. They need to focus on profit but I Mark is focused on maintaining his business trying not to lose customers to msft
Someone bought 4 mil. This morning. That gives us plenty support at $250
Could someone please tell me why this stock is down after hours?????
omg finally
"Great acquisition, great earnings, great stock!"
It’s time Apple to buy this company
The $240 strike price calls for CRM expiring next Friday Dec 11 are looking pretty tempting! Maybe the $235 ones if you want to be even safer.
"The more the shorts post on here trying to get people to sell or to not buy CRM, the more I know we're getting closer and closer to this rocketing up! Should be back up to $230 plus within a week. Good luck all!"
Salesforce is ready to FLY. Be there. Stay with SNAP as well but Salesforce is the one ready to explode upward. Boolean
"Im not so sure folks realize the problems from working from home. The employee's expenses such as phone, internet connection, all the needed hardware, office supplies, desk, ergonomic chair etc. Then there is liability, AKA workers comp. So I trip over the cord to my computer while working from home and I break my arm, or my kid cuts his head open while in my office.......the liability is the companies. Then there's that good ole employee fraud, could be workers comp, or moonlighting, or ????? $appl $crm $adbe $csco $intc $tvix"
"they beat earnings easily. whats to watch for is the guidance, especially after the acquisition. feeling good about it"
If people could keep selling and shorts keep attacking that would be awesome because I’m set to buy more at $200Thanks for the buying opportunity
I expect to see share price of $170 soon
A little bit of a rest before the next leg up. Not a bad thing but not any fun
Isn't it about time to leave $160. in the rear view mirror!!?
Overall market conditions are surpressing $CRM from taking off. look at all the upgrades! cloud based stock that allow companies to streamline operations are the future. dont be fooled by the ups and downs. this has and continues on an upward trend.
"This market doesn’t make sense to me.- $AAPL, whose significant source of revenue is hardware, has a higher PE than $MSFT, which is increasingly capturing market share in the Cloud business.- $AMZN has a significantly higher PE than $MSFT despite having a significant retail business.- $CRM has a significantly higher PE than $MSFT despite increasingly diluting equity capital to make new acquisitions.IMO, Apple, Amazon and Salesforce are dangerously overpriced and Microsoft is slightly underpriced. However, their stock prices tell a different story."
"My truck is loaded with CRM and AMZN, hoping for big rally in both by March"
It’s too cheap
CRM is a buy! Next week will be hitting new highs!
No worries. Long and strong.
Extremely oversold
Software not fairing to terrible today. Coup is well off it’s lows from last night. May bode well for us here?
"The whole market up AGAIN...and what happens to CRM? Down AGAIN! Understand that this will not move, it barely moved higher yesterday. The market was up 2% and this gained 3% when other big tech names were up 5+%...you have to read it properly. Tech making new highs and this is lagging or falling. Don't fall for the pumpers...they are salty that this dropped from $284 to $220 with no recovery in sight. This is an over priced stock that should really be trading at $180 or lower. Overpriced on every metric!!! Sell now and buy something that will make you money this year. AAPL and AMZN or even MSFT are big tech names that will do you well. Heck even FB and NFLX will give you good returns. Good luck and don't listen to the pumpers that don't really understand how bad the SLACK purchase is and that this will trade lower, sideways with a small bump here and there but at the end of the day your money will be worth less investing in this junk. Be aware guys...this will be $210-$200 in a week or so"
More than 3000 institutional holders and increasing. Very bullish.
looks like a big top rolling over
Anyone think we can go to 300 like nvda did. That be huge!!! Big big money.
I own shares and puts so idk what I want to happen on earnings . But god knows it’s been hard for my shares
SOLD221.00
ARK increased
We should be at $200
Get your positions in order for the after hours rocket! I'm locked and loaded.
Apple shooting upwards and CRM is following the same :)
Salesforce is gearing up now ... i guess the news is already out ..
"Benioff is an extremely aggressive and ambitious chap. SALESFORCE Building is the tallest in San Francisco and dominates the skyline. he has done over 7 billion $ deals with WORK being the biggest. He is media savvy and telegenic, and gives all sorts of interviews on CNBC, FOX BUSINESS, BLOOMBERG. David Rubinstein interviews him regularly. Do not bet against Benioff and get out of his way."
blow out earnings
52 week high about to be assaulted shortly
So funny that the shorts are declaring victory.
Just got a nice tip from ( https:// www.tradenow.xyz)
"People are loading up down here, once the selling pressure eases it will rise quickly"
The conf call isn’t moving the stock yet.
slow rise this morning but not sure how it will close. been hanging around 220 for a couple weeks now.
Celebrations!!! I finally broke even after months!!!!
Benjo...cover your short NOW!!!!
300 coming next week
"Institutional accumulations alweys creates a good environment..... 300 is not a farfetched price, imho."
Let's clear out the sellers so we can start moving back up in a meaningful way.
Don’t worry about by the minute changes in stock price. Hold is the smart move for me
IF [155 USD] arrives I might take a long position. Strong technical level; it might not come.
This will pop tomorrow. I’m listening to the ceo on a interview and allIs good.
"Couldn’t help it, more ... great price before ER! "
145 BILLION company and zero GAAP earnings. You gotta buy it here!! That's a late 1990s reference for the millennials.
Posted on Jan 15 by Zolly: “CRM will hit a revised price target of $230 or higher by close of the month of Jan 2020 and that is a bullish technical inevitability”Need I say more?!
"“Morgan Stanley Upgrades Slack, Says Salesforce Deal At 'Full Valuation'”https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/morgan-stanley-upgrades-slack-says-151838039.html"
Matter of Time this Market will CRASH again. Only few stocks going up most of the going down like in March. Every one taking about crash just waiting for matter of time
"PE Ratio (TTM) 9,037.50"
adjusted earnings .49-.50 vs street view .53. eps .71 vs street view .47 sales 3.28b vs 2.58 1 year ago. strong rev growth.this move of -2.00 means squat. good call and it is $160.... bleh call and it sits 145-155 for a few weeks.based on sep uption volume i suspect the call will be interesting.
WOWVolume 22M+
"There are no synergies from combining a cloud and an on premises software firm like Tableau - bad deal, bad bad bad and desperate- not one analyst has come out in support"
"When Vaccine is approved, moves to $250!"
Salesforce Made the deal with slack. Why would both stocks be down?￼￼
GAAP estimate for 2020 $0.66 to $0.68. Crazy valuation here ??? The Cramer push?
Green in a sea of red 
"With the type of earnings quality that CRM puts up, shares should be trading in the 80s currently. GAAP earnings were in the 20 cent range and were inflated due to one time tax benefits. Sales and marketing still make up 45% of net revenues. Outstanding share count up by another 40 million over the past year. Tells me this company still has no scale even after being in business for 20 years. Anyone can spend to grow until no more."
Looking to the $180s for an entry point after earnings
U would think the zoom earnings and guidance would push CRM higher with the Slack acquisition Stay at home work is here to stay. Mircosoft Team and Slack will benefit
"Up or down when j powell gives his speech? History says down, what’s the feeling about this time?"
"Although Keith Block has stepped down from CEO but he is an advisor where he will look closely on CRM. For me, no difference at all."
New all time high! Yea thir! So happy I doubled my position on this jewel a while back. This stock is a keeper.
Thinking about starting a position here. Every time this pulls back 10% it follows by shooting up 30-40%.
220 sounds bottom
"I averaged down, lol. Added at $138, my average now is $141.50. I do feel good about this company long term."
WOW AGGRESSIVE CLOSING BELL LAST MINUTE BUYING FOR SALESFORCE SHARES ...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This absolutely won’t last. Correction coming as soon as Friday if not tomorrow. Big players are waiting to dump when price is right
"demand is what moves a stock, now I'm thinking about these big-time investors with loads and loads of money, these people hate risks, they prefer to be safe, and what Im sure of, is that every one that is active in the stock market has already known of this software deal, they see the potential, but the key is for these people with the money to invest with these companies, so what i believe is gonna happen, is that some people are gonna be following strategies, and the most relevant ones, is the THREE-DAY RULE so they make sure to enter when the dust settles, and the second strategie is wait till monday, where prices will be relatively low and people would then invest, moreover the company will receive alot of money after some good news be published."
"This has to be one of the most over hyped that hedge funds want you to buy. Really, how many people do you know who have used this service and gotten jobs. Just a matter of time and they will dump. Investors will be saying, ""It will come back"", guess what.... it won't."
"LOL, I have a buy order set, 22 more shares for $220.15. Not sure I should be grateful or disappointed that I was 2¢ shy Thursday."
"Wow, look at COUP moving up today. I did not play her, but she reported excellent earnings yesterday after the close. The stock still sold off in a serious way, went all the way down to $136 early today, but now has climbed all the way back up to $149 and gone Green for the day! This is a good teaching lesson for those of us who play Earnings: Sometimes, if you KNOW the earnings came out your way but the stock still went in the other direction, all it takes is a little patience and you can avoid losing capital by selling/covering for a loss."
SOLD 229.43
"Can’t believe this was not down more today, nice short payday but I was expecting 2-3X more prodits"
Why just increase 1.3%? I expect 10%
CRM can be the best performing stock in 2021.Happy New year and good luck to all.
"With the fanmg+ near ATH, guarantee there will be rotation into beaten up tech, like CRM. Funds / institutions buying. Scared retail selling."
just asked my client using salesforce. they love the ideal of having slack intergrated with salesforce...
"Only fool will sell the stock,, ~20% of world's CRM is in the bag. If you believe top 1000 company in the world will fail in near future, please sell ur position asap."
"Given volume, RSI inching back up from near 30, smart money is buying."
since 09/20/20 CRM is seeing lower lows (currently on 4th lower low). That trend must end before signaling all clear to buy IMHO.
All short sellers will be regretted by tomorrow...cause great e/r today...
MB is desperate for revenue. This is going to crash for no growth. Just watch this sinks DOW. Never made real penny.
$98 or Lower...
Institutions are buying now that the weak hands have bailed out.
ARK Invest has been buying CRM through their ARKW ETF. ARK Invest has been selling off WORK and it appears they are going to transition their Slack investment into CRM.
Watch for upgrades coming soon. CRM will rise
Slack acquisition allows CRM to take out MSFT.
Only stock I have not participating in this comeback “rally”. $&@!!!
Below $260 by today 's end due to heavily short plus sell off volumes ...
Nice tailwind on CRM. Dynamite earnings report on the way.
Nasdaq up over 2% and this can barely match it. This will be a beautiful drop tomorrow and Friday!!! Make money baby
adom will turning this around good long term loadup hold few yrs. soon will be electric truck bus and so on.
Hold or Sell my Profits?
CRM beat earnings by 6%
"So, let me see they beat by .29, and next year they guide .10 less...well, isn’t that .19 more for five quarters? Isn’t it also possible they meet or exceed next year? Revenue seems good. Looks like a good day to sell a PUT."
SNAKE OIL MAN--desperate for Revenue.
perfect timing on the earnings report. all other tech in a wreck brings the good ones down as well. CRM is obviously oversold as I have been pounding the table for a couple weeks on atm December calls. should push towards 150 (upper resistance) IF we get calming guidance from Fed. Trump is not helping things at the moment however
$CRM Target Lowered by Piper Sandler Neutral USD 242 » USD 240 Target Raised by Macquarie Research Outperform USD 252 » USD 273
The one conclusion you can draw from these chat forums is that nobody knows what they're doing.
"Selling this short tomorrow ahead of earnings release. Stock is tremendously over-valued and close to a 52 week high. The cloud space is full of rising competitors. The only way this stock goes up from current price level, is on a huge eps and revenue beat along with bullish guidance. That is the only way and that ain't gonna be happening. I expect a serious sell-off immediately after earnings release and am 75% confident I will cover this short with a minimum 4% profit. Great odds on this short, made even better by the optimism of the overall market just ahead of the release. The higher the expectations the less likely any upside move will happen upon the actual numbers being released."
300 tomorrow. Watch
Bought 200 more.
"Take a look at the voulme bars. This is being accumulated by compter trading executed by the big guys. You see the same size small bars for most of the day - they want it, but don't want to tip their hand."
Opens 135 closes 128. Grr fall starts to 60
"Hello, WORK holder here. A bit disappointed in CRM's price action given the earnings beat and uplift in guidance.Is the price reaction typical when CRM makes an acquisition? BTW, the analyst community has it wrong when they compare Slack to MSFT teams. Slack channels are unlike anything in Teams and the application integrations it has set it apart. I'd trust Benioff on this as CRM has been using Slack for quite a while. I identified CRM as the likely acquirer of WORK when I bought it six weeks ago. I think you'll see more companies like IBM and Verizon dumping MSFT Office/Outlook and replacing them with Google and Slack. The combo is cheaper and much more efficient."
CRM downgraded this morning at Piper Sandler. Looks like a bad start to the week. If this gets to $200 I’m buying more.
"I want to get in, but up 26% just doesn't look like a good opportunity to me. It's definitely safe if you're long either way, but I want a bargain, which just isn't possible right now. Missed the boat."
Getting killed afterhours not sure why
salesforce should buy twitter and they will become a communication/collaboration giant for companies and individuals
"breaking: Salesforce price target raised to $220 from $205 at JefferiesJefferies analyst Brent Thill raised the firm's price target on Salesforce to $220 from $205 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. Thill, who notes that Salesforce shares trade at a substantial discount relative to large cap peers, said investors have raised two main concerns: aggressive M&A and a lack of leverage on operating margins. He believes Salesforce needs to ""take a breather"" to digest the Tableau deal, thinks margins ""could be a step function higher"" and that Salesforce could do more to deliver profitability given its scale, and believes the company should focus on delivering organic revenue growth."
Hit like if you are expecting $50 bounce in single day in next 2 months. :)
This will be very red today...starting to believe everyone that says it's going to $200. SO a drop of 10% is to be expected...very hated stock and Benoif doesn't care...the guy is worth $10 billion...he never looks at the stock price...went from $280 to $220 last month and not one positive announcement. I'm a bag holder for sure
"Short sellers are finished here. Cathie Wood (ARK Funds) recently took a HUGE position in CRM. And, as much as people think CRM overpaid for Slack, people don't realize this how valuable this acquisition will be for CRM, both in the short and long term. CRM is going to pop **easily** back to $240, minimum over the next 1-2 months. Lastly, Jefferies recently put a $320 PT on it. IMHO, that's conservative. Going off future expected growth, CRM should already have a $500B market cap. It is severely undervalued right now, and even at $300/share."
15+ years in. It's definitely time for a Salesforce dividend!
SHORT SHORT... amazing opportunity... COVID phase over and this is down at least 20%!
Nothing like giving away money when your stock isn't doing well.
They missed Q1 guidance by A LOT and for that they cannot be forgiven
Will be interesting what Benioff has to say tonight
First time add for me at 231$ coming over from Slack.
Wow...what a massive quarter. For all you shorties calling for a drop....you better cover cause this puppy heading back to 165. Boom!
Bullish trend
CRM is a strong company. I know people working for CRM in IT sales etc. Company pays exceptionally well and many new comp science graduates want to work for sales Force.
"CRM 's gain only short lived, will die out next days or so, as it went up too far too fast....it's not real investing momentum...or it's unstable...so it could drop tomorrow to under $230.00....when good time to reconsider buy or not again...."
Two stellar earnings reports and these dirtbags sell off
"Too bad, MSNBC looks like they are replacing tonights 10 pm show about Salesforce changing the world w/ Facebook."
CRM is up 5.92% to 148.84
when does the report come out
I am a buyer at $75
Earnings will Hit it out of the Park!
"so it's heading south ditection, i added another share.."
"Hoping it’s a all stock deal!!! I’d keep my CRM shares , (here from SLACK)"
Let’s make twlo like move!
"What happened to our rollicking rally today? We were up to 148.79 and now we're dropping like a rock currently at 146.25. Straight up, then straight down. The rally was likely caused by a couple of very good upgrades, too. She'll go back up, but today was crazy action as the market is strong."
"many people saying the company is overvalued, and it sure is but that's only because investors are impressed by the company, look at tesla and BYND they are so overvalued, why? because the vision of these companies in 5-10 years is what makes them worth that high"
No Benz for Benzo. For people who wants introduction: He will be active only while stock goes down. He runs when the stock turns around.If it works out he praises to himself. If not h￼ tubs away.He bashed W when at 90. Now it is at 150. MDB at 70 and now 160+.He bashed shop at 120 and now at 300.His bashing usually helps stocks to move up bigSo ignore Benzo because he will be gone as soon as it turns around. Watch tomorrow you will see no Benzo.Gl
HUBS a competitor of CRM reported a spectacular earnings. CRM will do too.
"$CRM Valuation: $CRM will pay 27.7 Billion for $WORK (Slack), which is $45 per share of Slack. Slack shareholders will receive $26.79 in cash & 0.0776 shares of Salesforce stock for each slack share(dilution to current shareholders). Thus, $26.79 is cash + $18.21 is $CRM shares (0.0776) = $45 Slack . $CRM valuation is $234.66 ($18.21/0.0776)! If you buy below $234.66, then you can gain the arbitrage gain! For all of you fools, stop pumping this Salesforce as it should be $270, $275, or $280 or $300 by tomorrow, January or February 2021. Stop abusing new investors! If you do not understand about valuation, then please learn it! $CRM will be $275 in Dec 2021 (1 year from now) if they meet the revenue and EPS expectations"
This could break 230.00 Today and never look back.
Slack is going to beat Microsoft ? keep dreaming. Satya Nadela can beat Benioff with his pinky.
"I'm done, GL to all, I'm sure the later quarters will get back on track but this tech punching bag is too stressful."
added 100 shares for holding long. glta
Positive market today as stimulus is imminent by this weekend....Close UP above $235 today ?
thanks for letting me load up at $157 haha
all analysts raising target today...so must be pretty good
"I just moved here from my long position in Slack. Long live CRM, long live Slack!"
.97 cents for next year....figure out that PE ratio...
"Salesforce reinstated with a Buy and $275 target, TOP PICK at BofABofA analyst Brad Sills reinstated coverage of Salesforce with a Buy rating and $275 price target. The analyst states that the company screens well in his ""4 M's"" framework for software investing - Market, competitive Moat, Management strength and Margin potential. Sills adds that the core business of Salesforce represents a $62B opportunity, while adjacencies that include analytics and collaboration software such as its pending Slack acquisition represent an additional $67B opportunity."
Sold too early yesterday AH at my limit order of $156. I have no regrets as I was up $10. Good ER and guidance. I'll buy again when it dips today.
"Markets green four days in a straight and this #$%$ n k not even able to sustain a small momentum and don?t come and say wait for two years, long term blah blah blah"
The beat was not good enough to justify the growth pe they enjoy. So maybe the company is not as great as they had hoped/thought?
"Results are actually good, price simply dropped on negative market sentiment. Give it end of week and CRM should be over 160."
No ones want to hold bag during this extremely profit taking time ?....Ofcourse not ....
"Good company, good future, just buy it when it is red because the earnings always beat estimate."
they wouldn’t buy it if they didn’t know it would add to their business this is great
"Here we go, making our way back to $250 in December"
240 now! Keep growing!
Salesforce should buy Slack #Work !
I'll be buying in today's dip
Is this the most shorts can do?
This is a gift. Add more today! Good luck
I believe this is the week we climb back up to $230 plus! CRM is on a great path for continued growth! Good luck all!
"The train is leaving, welcome aboard!"
"Nice earnings results yesterday for BLIN, Bridgeline Digital, one of my holdings. Revenues up 14%, Significant improvement in EBITDA for the year. Stronger customer acquisition + expansion within existing customer base. Subscription and perpetual license revenue increased 17.3%, Services revenue increased 15.2%.This small company is worth consideration."
The earnings press release says: RAISES FY22 REVENUE GUIDANCE TO $25.65 BILLION TO $25.75 BILLION.Q4Should this read: RAISES FY22 REVENUE GUIDANCE FROM $25.65 BILLION TO $25.75 BILLION.Q4This is important! Notice the FROM. Does anybody know which mistake was made? Should it says LOWERS not RAISES?
All tech stocks are down today but this is puzzling after yesterday.
Anyone else think CRM goes to $238 then drops to sub $200?
Any news
Top out at 175.00 AH.
I’m sure this will turn. It’s been growing massively for years as a roll-up of SAAS companies with a highly robust and promotional CEO who has a great pal on CNBC. The FED will keep up their money printing and market manipulation tactics as far as the eye can see so this is likely to double or triple from here over the next few years.Good luck.Peace.
Soon the herd will see the connection between amazon salesforce Microsoft
Come on baby. Squeeze these shorts out of here trying to make a few cents. I need my calls to print so I can enjoy Christmas 
Salesforce will buy Box inc. and will be bought by Microsoft.Is this realistic ?
Something is cooking w.r.t MuleSoft.Cracks do seem to appear. If you read between the lines from this article https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/03/salesforce-co-ceo-keith-block-was-skeptical-of-mulesoft-deal.html?__source=yahoo%7Cfinance%7Cheadline%7Cstory%7C&par=yahoo&yptr=yahooSo one bank’s CIO said that getting data out of legacy systems is hard and Block got convinced to buy MuleSoft?Oh. Something is definitely not right.
220 soon
"Rough in the short term, great in the long term."
Little sell off. Don't be rattled. Good report tomorrow!!!
"Hope it drops another $10 so I can buy more. If you understood CRM's history, they have been successful at integrating companies. Great company with outstanding people."
call option sure looking nice after earnings
$CRM - This stock is been pushed by the big investment companies and careful examination of the data does not justify this price (PE over 150)
Listing to CC right now!
Cheap at these levels. Loaded up today. I can’t emphasize enough how strongly I believe in CRM. I see this trading above $300 long term. Company deserves a lot more love than the street has been giving it. As long as Benioff remains at the helm I am buying all the dips.
Maybe too high but I just snagged it at 226.40
"Team,I am needing a small business software that can so the following:1. Manage service tickets, and apply service agreements to them when the are eligible.2. Alert us when service agreements are expiring.3. Keep track of inventory, along with serial numbers.4. Create invoices for the service tickets.5. Keep track of time and attendance for my workers.6. Allow customers to be able to send and email and have it automatically create a ticket.We are currently using ConnectWise, but are having issues with them, so we are looking for a replacement."
"The investors conference just started- big shot MB joins from Geneva Switzerland, what a tossed, the guy spends all his time jet setting while the stock is way down"
Coca-Cola deal doesn’t look bad either!
so many people posteing on here trying to scare people. I hate how stocks are manipulated so much.
Those investors investing in innovative game changing disruption are getting a blood bath right now. Hang in there for future rewards.
I buy buy buy!!!

Salesforce Investor Day on Dec.8th at 10:30 AM so don't expect the stock to stay down here for too long. I'm looking to buy the morning dip.
One bad quarter...this falls hard. People seem to be parking money here...
Noname....nice reply about the $317M...why do they need? Hope someone does ask!!!
OUCH ! GUIDANCE for 2020 CAME IN 50mill low . UGHhHH

CRM headed for $180. Great buy CRM @$ 180.
7 favorable articles on Yahoo Finance yesterday and what do we get?
"I’m not sure but if this falls under $165 than , I might think about dipping in."
What would be opening and closing price for tomo? any guesses?
"It's green! Ooooohh. Put a temporary sell on your shares at around 154 so the shorties can't borrow them. When the pps rises, cancel and raise the order price."
CRM is down 4.91% to $141.21
"Analysts says “price target 195, Salesforce had a sizable revenue, EPS and CRPO beat, Salesforce once again finds itself sitting atop the throne with its head held high and its crown intact”"
What time is earnings report?

To own CRM long term requires the patience of a saint.
"Think long term folks. It should be fine. I am sure it is going to end the year at 175 or higher. couple of years back when I bought NFLX at 99 around NOV 2016 , after the earnings it went to 127 and dropped next to 112. I didn’t sell and would not have regardless. Where is NFLX at now?"
finally back on track need this at 240
"about to crush earnings - from the previous CC intro: ""based on this ... qtr and >>our outlook for q4<< we are raising FY 19 full year guidance ... 26% growth ... $16 billion revenues ... "" plus: faster growth in large deals, in Asia, etc."
shorts cover fast short cover
Muting uncle was the best trade of the day!
Congrats Longs!
Closes above $240

Salesforce is on unloved stock...something will change that but for now....no love
"HEY UNCLE, NEXT TIME CHECK YOUR FACTS. LOOK AT ARK FUNDS AND TELL ME HOW MUCH CATHIE WOOD, A BETTER INVESTOR THAN YOU, INVESTED IN CRM. $22 MILLION AT $227. SHE'S STILL HOLDING."
"As someone who has been in CRM for a few years, let me share an observation for newbies: there are only TWO times during a year that you buy Salesforce. 1) when they buy a big company and the share price gets hammered and 2) when they hit their 200 day moving average. Study its chart. The 200 dma is around $202/shr, which is about $20/share from here. It is over SIXTY DOLLARS off its high. They DESTROYED their last earnings numbers. If you're thinking about whether CRM is worth it, knowing the ONLY reason the price is down is because they're buying a pricey but disruptive company that greatly enhances their product,... maybe it's time you buy some, then keep some powder dry in case it DOES go to the 200 dma. After that earnings report, and knowing that the Slack deal is baking in as we speak, I don't think it's going much lower than this unless there is a macro event out of its control. I have been buying more at $220-$222 even though my average before this was $131/shr."
"I empathize with anyone in higher than I am, but I've just gotta say that my 221.29 entry here feels like an absolute steal!"
Stock is going way up. Growth is back and Microsoft and Netflix proved it.
Possibility of reaching $300?
155 close.. watch
Well now
"The group of cloud stocks should not be grouped in with Stimulus. It's a ridiculous theory. Businesses who utilize Salesforce are using the tool to create relationships with clients. I see 320 by the end of q1, 2021."
Uh-oh. What happened here?
Well hopefully insider selling is done and price suppression is over.
does CRM own a large position in ZM zoom media? maybe thebuy them out?
"Well the CEO was correct, Slack continues to make CRM a much more profitable company. You pumpers are right this will be at $300. Oh I forgot, on a reverse split."
"So I bought 45 shares at 245, then at 230 and 216. Now I have 130 shares with an average price of 230.98. Feeling strong about this stock based on news, with a potential of seeing 260-280 in January."
"Folks, as I said earlier short the hecckk out of this pees of sheet, at least recoup a little, thank god I did."
"disappointing CRM isn't skyrocketing like the rest of the market, but I'm still all in."
Whoever bought today is getting a BIG pay day on Friday. Kinda jealous.
Interview with Cramer. Salesforce will be $50 Billion with Slack
Beat and raise !
Have you covered your shorts yet!!!! Lols
Come on. Should back ip $200 soon
New highs coming!!!! BEAT and BEAT and AFFIRM. Tomorrow will be nice day. Congrats longs.
Going to 100$ in a few days
I think we close above $228. An excellent day coming into a potential positive catalyst tomorrow. GLTA!
"Smart money started or added. I added today to CRM. I added so much to my tech portfolio in March/April. These are opportunities, don't miss them. 2021 the stock market will soar even more."
I won’t be surprised if we get couple upgrades tomorrow then another KABOOM!!!!!
I’d be surprised to ever see it above $230 again...this stock is done for
Did Salesforce buy Dropbox??? We shall see
"Seems like an admission that $MSFT is eating $CRM's lunch as well as $WORK's. Hope thy are real transparent about why they are thinking about doing this deal, and why it doesn't signal a total panic in their business strategy."
Is there a bigger waste of time for a basher to talk about a company like Salesforce who is such a proven monster... would think you'd just pick a different stock lol
Keep buying the dips. This is going to the moon when big tech starts reporting ER...
so they decreased their earnings per share guidance
"Ignoring the acquisition, was it a good quarter and was the forward guidance something to look forward to?"
Is SALESFORCE a worthy longterm investment?Thanks 
I can't think of a worse stock to buy. market way up and CRM doesn't budge.
Weak
"I HATE CRM and HATE THE CEO even more today. Time to sell after the ER regardless where the stock goes, I am done with this mess."
Must say impressed by the strength today. Possible reversal soon.

Remember there is the MuleSoft IPO crony stuff here. Now the Chief Lawyer has SEFraudulently Misstating Financial StatementHow unethical management fraudulently misstates financial statement? The majority of cases of fraudulent financial reporting involve making a company’s financial health appear better than it really is. There are a number of methods by which this can be accomplished: (1) Overstating revenues; (2) Understating expenses; (3) Understating liabilities; (4) Overstating assets; (5) Improper disclosures. Often, a combination of methods is used. For example, a company may “hold the books open” and record revenue this year when the revenue should be recorded in the following year (overstating revenues). At the same time, the company may delay the recognition of some expenses and record them in the following year when the proper recognition of the expenses should have occurred this year (understating expenses). This post describes and illustrates how unethical management fraudulently misstates financial statement. It does not mean to encourage you to do so, but to avoid these practices at all. Advertisement Method#1. Overstating RevenuesBecause net income equals revenue minus expenses, any time revenues are overstated, net income also will be overstated. Revenue can be overstated by doing the following: Recording fictitious revenue Recognizing revenue prematurely Understating sales returns Fictitious revenue can be created by recording sales to customers who do not exist (ghost customers) or by recording inflated sales to actual customers. If the latter method is chosen, management will need to take care not to over-bill the actual customers, and so although fake documentation will be required, careful records must be kept. The lengths to which some managers go to perpetrate this kind of fraud can be amazing."
"PFE will lead to $60!When it aproved by FDA!!GTLA!!!#AMZN, #GOOG, #TSLA, #HUBS, #FB #CRM"
PE is around 80.There was no way this wasn't taking a hit no matter what kind of earnings they put out.
How are people saying earnings are bad? They were great they over performed
"What is this, day 17 of declines?"
"$250 call, exp 12/18 what y’all think"
Crm forward PE 55.. work will allow CRM to be $50 billion revenue over 2-3 yrs. CRM headed to trillion dollar mark
Great week to shirt crm!!!
all the nonsensical commentary on CRM's earnings by the talking head/financial media... do they have no one who actually followed the post-market trading and can comprehend what was happening? i don't know ~ but i am just a schmuck who has been trading/investing on & off for twenty years and i can see it. what is wrong with this picture?
Not what was expected.
"Salesforce Announces Record Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2019 Results• Fourth Quarter Revenue of $3.60 Billion, up 26% Year-Over-Year, 27% in Constant Currency• Full Year Revenue of $13.28 Billion, up 26% Year-Over-Year, 26% in Constant Currency• Unearned Revenue of $8.56 Billion, up 22% Year-Over-Year, 24% in Constant Currency• Remaining Performance Obligation of Approximately $25.7 Billion, up 25% Year-Over-Year• Fourth Quarter Operating Cash Flow of $1.33 Billion, up 27% Year-Over-Year• Full Year Operating Cash Flow of $3.40 Billion, up 24% Year-Over-Year"
"FUSZ Gee.... I'm nervous about this... Richard Bohn has me quaking in my boots.... Quote: Some folks in the industry (mostly the CRM product managers who have to deal with me!) call me a crotchety old fart. However, I have been at this since January-1985 and have earned my solid reputation in the analyst community as a totally independent and brutally honest reviewer of all CRM solutions. Then if this is his brutally honest preliminary assessment of nFusz NotifiCRM.....I'm scared :)....... ""Great update from folks at @nFuszInc This one is HOT! A real game-changer (a phrase I seldom use!) Full #CRM Review real soon now!"""
kind of a nothing release
Wait until interest rates get to 4 to 5 percent people wont like this deal too much LOL
The market is up but CRM is getting dumped BIG time and lots of downside left
"Half my shares were called away due to writing covered calls @81. Rebought today at 78.84. Put half the the profits into long calls @81. Seems like an irrational wave of selling hit today when the CC was moved. Paranoia? But paranoid people are often right. A ""Scheduling Conflict""? Without details? I fear another acquisition. Auction fever in the Valley? So why buy stock? I am willing to hold long-term. Why buy calls? I am willing to speculate with ""house money""."
"Glad I added at 123 recently, but I was hoping to add even more at a lower price ...."
This could be a 200 dollar stock if it brakes out of its high
"The king of customer relationship management (CRM), Salesforce CRM, is preparing to release its Q4 earnings (ending on January 31st) after the bell Tuesday, February 25th. This is one of the most attractive enterprise-cloud stocks on the market, with 26 out of 27 analysts calling CRM a buy."
"Trading at 110 times earnings...and that's with today's move. Is this really a better buy than Apple or Google trading at 30-36 times earnings. Nope, staying away from the falling knife. The short squeeze is on big time. The growth play has played out on this one."
295 target by end of year!! Gooo gooo.
"CRM will close the day at $154.38 according to my model, longs sell your shares and you can buy them back cheaper on Monday, Monday will be a bloodbath of selling guaranteed"
"Wow, up in the AH. "
"This dog won’t hunt, longs sell all of your shares fast and cheap and get short but only listen to me if you want to make money"
CRM stock going higher. Way oversold.
"0.5% up in after hours, thats a big change since its only late hours`"
"Thanks to last week’s oversold, CRM will be surging back above 235 this week!"
Great resultBeating all the expectations Will be touching 280$ tomorrow
Dead cat bounce - shorts load up more
The Shorties are getting nervous by the minutes. It keeps going up just like their blood level. #rocketup
"it looks like Salesforce is done in the short-term in moving higher... after the upgrades and the 100 + new target , I thought the stock would run a lot more but obviously it isn't, any thoughts from you long-term holders ?"
Please guys!!! Sell before you get hurt...buy at a much lower price if you really want to own this
Sales Force expanding to the UK. Big investment made there.
Will go down before heading up. Google and Amazon will bring market down
Another day of attack on the $220/share support level for CRM. Hope this line of defense holds.
Shares dilution announcement coming soon for slacks closing.
This company is a very good company with very good earnings and bright future why its going down any idea?
"It is about time CRM makes a bug move, enough consolidation around $156-$157."
Earnings were great. Why is this stock down?
you just missed the last chance to run
CNBC likes the stock.
"CRM market cap down $38.2 billion since the day the Slack acquisition was announced. A $38.2 bn drop for a $27.7 bn acquisition is a bit of an overreaction, I think. Pricey or not."
free money! even if you dont believe in this company. thus will creep right back up before close in anticipation of ER. the more this drops intraday the more reason to buy. look at the past. you can sell right before close if you don't have faith in this co.
Great time to accumulate cheap shares.
"Bought both WORK and CRM. This is a great deal for the combo powerhouse. Considering CRM's customer base, this will be a big win for CRM."
took on more at 220.20 in IRA Trad and ROTH IRA. Long on strong hold for years to come.
Who’s buying the dip?
$228+ today I hope!
Cramer & company always pumping but the music going to stop some time ..
Sell into earnings as it always falls after reporting no matter how good the report.
"I think the direction of the market tomorrow depends on the unemployment numbers in the morning, if beat ( up we go) if not ( then down we go)"
"[ CRM entry level 153 USD or 170 USD - this is just for me guys, don't mind me ]"
"added Jan 15th calls today for some good short term money moves. we didn't just drop 20 today, we are down from 260 5 days ago. should be a good bounce coming"
This is not the right time to buy CRM. it will bottom in the range of 200-208.
Shorts gotta be hurting today. Y’all thought it would drop back to $235? LOL
crushed it !!! bull call 215 / 220 more than doubled !!!
Loaded up. Next Tuesday will be interesting.
"Salesforce will double their revenues in three years and growth will slow very little for another three. With a single platform to develop on, & to support, & to operate, & to sell, in 3 years they can have twice the revenue with substantially the same expenses that they have now. What will margins be? what will profits be ? 10 billion? A P/E of 10 with on subscription revenues? No, the stock will be double or triple in 3 years. In IT, the one with the most market share is the safest product to buy. CRM sales proposition (ease of use, support, the single platform, safest purchase, point-and-click development, and better architecture) just gets stronger every year, and every new acquisition becomes the market leader."
It is nothing more than BUBBLE! Keep GAMBLING!
"Looking for $175.00 with my AH Limit Sell order. Hey, only got 100 shares so need a real big pop on this one... :-)"
4 days of small volume selloff. This pig could jump big anytime!!!
stop losses plus week hands sold on the bottom. might see green by EOD
CRM's typical price range is $210.22 to $220.12 with an extreme price range of $205.26 to $225.08. Current triple support at $208.07 and triple resistance at $218.64.Warren Buffett's investing strategy is to buy and hold. He has a reputation for holding onto companies for many years. However that is not the only way he has built up his wealth.He trades options from time to time to collect premiums while waiting for stocks he loves to hit certain price points.Just sold an April $225 covered call to make up some of the losses holding onto CRM. Will see how this strategy plays out.Good luck all!!!
I see a lot of complaints in this comment section. Im still very bullish on CRM. They keep improving every damn time. Im long. CRM for the win.
Buying every dip under 240
Don’t become a bag holder
"Vaccines, economy doing better than expected, sharp declines in unemployment. More stimulus next year. Market will roar in 2021. Buy stocks, almost anything cheap now."
I have been wanting to short crm and the opportunity is knocking on my door.
12 upgrades to buy today
Going higher.
Holding it from 248. when will it hit back 250?
"this ain't going anywhere for 2 months, it's just payed over the odds in an acquisition.did you guys learn nothing this year?i'll prob pick this up in february for a similar price as it is now."
Amazing day.
"This markets strength is surprising, I know. But I called not to sell at $270-$275. Don’t whine when you miss out next week. Cases dropping, election doesn’t matter for this one. Successful and strong in the end"
Great stock.
All of a sudden Crm hated? Give me a break.
The good thing is that company has created an illusion and presented terrible ER as a good one! Few accounting trick was enough to pump the stock price!
This stock doesn't act right and it bugs me that the ceo appears so much on Cramer's show. It seems like he does that to generate interest in the stock. I want out but I don't want to lose so much.
Crm to the moon!! 170 by friday!
"I don’t have any shares right now, but why is this dropping if they are in the talks of purchasing slack?"
CRM $250 by earnings. Up or down after earnings I dunno. GLTA
Just bought my Sep calls. Think this took too much of a beating after acquisition. Should be a beat.
$210 is very reasonableand we are 50% over that
and now why the drop after hours that wiped out all of the day's gains?
Today’s CRM and AT&T deal is HUGE. If for whatever reason this doesn’t shoot up tomorrow expect high 180’s next week.
Long term you can trust CRM. I bet you that CRM will go up after the dust settles.
Probably should be at 160 if it weren't for Trump's tweets.
Any year end predictions? Only 5 days left I am thinking 236 - 240
Is it too late to buy now?
May the Salesforce be with you. Go long.
I hope you boys bought the dip like I did. Almost as good as March/April. Next year market headed up and up.
Sure not understanding why funds are selling this down
Iron shield of support at 216
"ALERT !UNDER $230 by tomorrow opening, due to record high and recent pull back from DOW JONES......Best time definitely to SELL is today in AH.....do it before too late since big WHALE could dump tons of shares ( millions) in a matter of minutes....when it could be too late to sell...."
wow - up over 3 bucks early tomorrow on pending Q report
Below $150....there it goes...next stop $140!
"Look at the volume, bring it on my short friends, let’s teach these baggg holders a lesson."
"I want everyone to look at the history of comments made by people who are posting bad things. It is really sad. Every company is a fraud, every stock is going to crash, and all execs are a sham. Yes their guidance and wording of their future was a little worrisome and hence why the stock is down. Their have been some global challenges outside of their control and being a global company it does happen. I believe their acquisitions getting into more doc mgmt and eCommerce will pay off big time. The talent they are acquiring and the tech with those companies will only make them better over time. They have the customer base they want that is not afraid to spend money, why not offer them up some more value in new spaces."
Can’t wait for the bears to leave. Cya!
I wonder how big the news is going to be? Why would you tease it unless it's something big. I'll be watching.
correction to 100 level before goes up again ..take profits
When do you foresee the gap closing? This quarter? Next?
213 is bargain for this tech giant
This is taking off by end of week. Buy the dips while you can.
"Soon back over $160 on way to highs.BTW, where is ""D"" who 4 days ago mocked us longs........seems like went in hiding, needs to stay there vs post multiple times, wasting all our time,"
"Bernstein now sees a pathway to $125 and upgrades to Market Perform from Under Perform.The case against Salesforce's stock was based on the premise the company won't be able to organically generate a revenue growth rate north of 20 percent, Moerdler said in the note. But this is no longer the case, as the company's fourth-quarter earnings report was ""very strong"" from a bookings perspective as deferred revenue grew 25 percent and total backlog rose 40 percent. The company is seeing an increase in sales momentum due to its strong platform offering and a healthy spending environment.Salesforce's acquisition of MuleSoft will also contribute both inorganic and organic sales growth in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020, which would help the company achieve the analyst's 20 percent revenue growth requirement through at least 2020.Moerdler said Salesforce's ability to generate an operating margin north of 30 percent in the long-term or 300 to 400 basis points of margin improvement per year remains a concern. Nevertheless, the company's ability to generate a revenue growth rate of more than 20 percent makes it ""unlikely investors will exit the stock en-mass or increase their focus on margin expansion."""
"NOTIFY is a PART of this anticipated increase 2 billion in revenue. I have said time and time again Oracle goal is to beat Salesforce $CRM -- They have also added other new partners as well. This tech is going to put them a level above Salesforce. Rome wasn't built in a day. For its fiscal-2018 second quarter, ended Nov. 30, Oracle reported SaaS revenue of $1.123 billion, up 47% and yielding an annualized SaaS run rate of $4.5 billion. That $1.123 in Q2 SaaS revenue equates to 12% of the company's total revenue, and combined with PaaS and IaaS revenue totaling $396 million gave Oracle total Q2 cloud revenue of $1.519 billion.Those SaaS revenues make Oracle the world's second-largest provider of SaaS apps behind Salesforce.com, but Oracle believes it has a number of advantages over Salesforce that will ultimately allow Oracle to become the top player. Among those reasons cited by Oracle is this aggressive move into next-gen apps powered by AI and machine learning, but there are others as well:The company expects that for the four quarters spanning from Dec. 1, 2017, through Nov. 30, 2018, it will sell around $2 billion in new enterprise SaaS cloud subscriptions, a total it believes neither Salesforce nor any other competitor can match;Oracle believes that the sheer breadth and depth of its product lineup will give its SaaS business a scale that Salesforce can't achieve; andFounder and CTO Larry Ellison says Oracle is the runaway leader in the SaaS ERP market, which he says is by far the largest SaaS category—and so if Salesforce has no play in ERP, then Oracle will eventually outpace Salesforce in SaaS revenue.https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobevans1/2018/01/30/oracle-places-huge-bets-on-a-i-and-machine-learning-to-overtake-salesforce-com-in-saas/#2ab152681da1"
"I, for one, hate the acquisition of Slack. CRM is attractive because they carved out a dominant position in the sales market, which MSFT and GOOG didn't touch. On top of that, they were starting to build quite a portfolio of analytics and AI with Tableau, Mulesoft, and Salesforce Einstein. Now, instead of investing $27.7 billion into their AI/analytics segments, they bought Slack to take on MSFT. If Benioff had announced they had pledged to invest $27.7 billion into their Salesforce Einstein and analytics departments over time, this stock would have shot to the moon after hours. Why? That was the direction we all wanted this company to go....not teamwork software. Quite disappointed. Benioff is one of the greatest CEO's in the world, and i'll trust his judgement/research hang on to my shares but i'm not near as excited about this company that's for sure."
this ones going north of 161 for certain !
"Better to provide guidance than not. Pipeline intact, no revenue hit, I see this floating back up."
CRM is down 6.62% to 144.34
"Both the Bid and Ask prices are over 157 in pre-market trading. Nice holding pattern before trading begins. I don't have a clue where Dbag came up with a price such as 149, must have been in a dream."
"Looks like CRM getting ready to hear of BID for twitter. Price is indicative of events. It will be a smart move as hand is forced by Microsoft on artifical intelligence starting November 1, 2016. CRM can't afford to wait on the data or it is out of the game for good as Microsoft will crush them."
Wow great article today. I’m a believer!!
will go to 113 support
All time high. I love this stock. The de facto pure play Cloud stock with one of the best 5 bestCEO’s in the business. A long term hold for “moi”.
The price level now for CRM is getting to the point where big buyers will start loading up soon. They know a bargain when they see it. That’s when this will go up...quickly. And I believe it’s coming. Soon. Good luck all!
This stock will become the next google.. it will take time but will get there! FOR SURE :))
bullish 400
not selling. don't see a reason. no news. manipulation
"It all boils down to why do u want to take a position with this stock. If u believe the stock price will go up (not talking to day traders, I like to day trade but not with this one) buy some... if u think it wont go up, dont buy it (or short it if ya want, it's your money.) I think it will keep going up, so I took a position.... pretty simple, huh?"
shorted more at 117.15
There needs to be some type of catalyst. We’re way below the 200 SMA
Yet another all time high. The greatest pure play clown company in the world. Full Stop!
way down pre market. Whats up???
"$CRM is a B2B software / SaaS company worth $240Bn - with Slack at only ~$17B valuation, there is plenty of room for it to grow in the B2B space (note - I am not comparing their products - I am comparing the markets they go after and valuation)"
what are you thinking about this stock ?
Work just dumped a Truckload of shares on the market

Well Cramer did say he was buying this this week for his Actions Alerts
uncle=muted. do yourself a favor and do the same ... wow.
"If you sell CRM and take your pennies, you’ll miss out on the dollars! I wouldn’t sell here now that it’s come back up over $225. I wouldn’t sell this in the $225 to $230 range, or you’ll miss out on the $240 plus that this is headed to pretty soon I believe. Possibly even higher."
"Here is hoping for 160 today, but it might not even hit 158 at this rate."
"Piper Sandler lowered price target to 278 from 285, still overweight Morningstar maintained 253 price targetand said shares are attractive"

Wow how low can this go??????????????
Just increased my position.. who else is buying this stock today?
"Just curious might be a noobish question, but what makes CRM so close in stock price to Microsoft?"
back down to 149 monday...
CRM market capital tumbled more than 27.7 billion dollar after the acquisition. I think the bottom is near or something went wrong.

I love when the numbers go crazy on earnings! lol
CRM reached a new All Time High at 157.36
Slack deal closing on 9th April
Stock is waaay undervalued. Should be a $200 stock. Enjoy the ride up amigos. :))

excellent report expected225 /per share by June
"280 - 300 by year end,"
"When you buy quality stocks when the price is down, there's nothing to worry about. Amazon, Microsoft, SalesForce, Visa, Master Card etc. are all good examples. Buy the dip. Heck, sell puts when it's down to make extra money."
It’s going to test 300 today.
Cramer said it be right back up
"bought 30 cents put spread for 215-2010 for fun, i don't think it will drop that low but you never knew."
This stock gets a ton of praise. All I know is pain though
Moving some profits to EGAN. Profitable in Cloud and great guidance.
Bought the dip!
"Growth company with earnings, growing cash, low debt, operating cash flow. Why the negative vibe, Man?"
2% gain. Some big boy taking positions
expecting a big earnings beat..lets see
"Fairly normal pullback. No biggie, we are still going up."
"Relax guys, whole market is a little pulled back today! If you are long term hold you will understand!"
A great acquisition? The price of my CRM shares doesn’t so that.
I'm still way ahead. I got 20shares @ 141. Thanks CRM
Now that the tape shows $149 for the Monday trading price people on here need to admit I have been right all along and post some apologies
"wasn't that some wanted to buy this company at 80$ (that was before the 1for 4 split, or $20/share). Wow"
Crm should be trying to alter their offerings to ease companies during the restructuring as we get to work. I do not see enough changes in crm offerings that are based on the issues caused by the pandemic. They need to get out in front and take the lead on designing business operations post pandemic.
"To help out longs who have lost everything, I will pay $10 a week to wash my Lambo and $5 for cleaning and shining the tires - apply quickly because slots are going fast"
"Finally broke the downtrend. What a great b/o, didn’t even touch 200ma. We should see short sqeez in coming days now."
"Many people aren’t getting the hang of the synergy at play here. Slack is one lonely company without a parent ecosystem. Hotmail had to be integrated into Microsoft’s ecosystem when Gmail gained traction, Instagram would’ve also faltered if Facebook didn’t acquire it. Salesforce is an ecosystem, and Slacks needs one to continue growing. Customers won’t leave Salesforce because of the addition of Slack. It will be an added feature, and it will only lure more customers. And for software, loyalty and years of employee experience is paramount. The Inertia is very strong when it comes to revamping your entire business IT ecosystem. And that’s the prize Salesforce is aiming for.There is a reason Goldman and Oppenheimer reaffirmed their price targets despite this mega transaction."
Sell off is overdone..even Oracle outperformed this on 1 year basis ..this is back up the truck territory..this company will grow at 20% for many years..rest is just noise
Im adding as institutional accumulation goes on. I bless this for long hold
Started my position today. This is a no-brainer!!!
A great company with a bright future. We should see $200 by end of the year.
CRM may not buy Slack after all. The leaked news is just to pump Slack's stock price.
"Whole market is down, hence CRM is also down.Don't worry just hold and AH it will jump past 150"
There is something really wrong with this stock right now...new source of funds I guess
I feel like this headline is to help offset the bad numbers that’s about to be announced lol
"Who would've thought after the spike on earnings, that we would be able to add shares near where they were before earnings were announced....I am going to add to my CRM very very soon...."
"Ok, what is wrong with this company? The market has been doing well and this stock has no traction. I am sorry I didn't sell when it jumped up a couple of weeks ago. The ceo of this company appears on Cramer's show too much. This indicates to me that he is trying to generate more interest in owning his stock. My cost basis is 156 and when it gets back, I am getting out."
looks like it may go into a narrow trade range and then boost higher later today...not sure yet but chart appears to be indicating that directionality. Boolean

Great company. It is time to fly
Does anybody here own RNG...a competitor to Salesforce...CRM?? I think CRM is better...both have 1.7 analysis ratings...

Wonder if earnings will take this to 150?
"Picking up a few ZI, great company like CRM. Sooner or later it will become a buy out target for the likes of CRM ADBE or AMZN."

"Small pull back was expected. This will be $190 tomorrow, sit back and enjoy."
I can see Microsoft and IBM getting into a bidding war over who gets to take Salesforce home. Then Apple comes in and the stock goes to $500. A war over Salesforce is coming!
jeez just panick selling because of the outage. Fix the damn thing and get back to work. CRM will be back over 220 by days end.
Bad looking trend line on this one lower highs and lower lows. $224 here we come.
Oh my $153 and yes soon to be $165 then $185 then $200 this is the gold standard
"Based on eToro insider transaction, all có found and ceo just sold a portion of their share. Does this men that the er will be bad? Thanks guys... Newbie here."
This had no reason to drop below 150 in the first place. Earnings should give this a bump from the 154-156 range resulting in an easy $160+ stock
I’m long CRM. I’m also in sales & marketing for a company and use Salesforce software every single day. I’ve interacted with Salesforce sales reps and watched their live demos. I know I’m biased because I’m an investor as well but the professionalism and knowledge of their reps is as good as it gets. They know what they’re doing. It makes sense because they use what they sell and have the best tools in the business. These are just a few reasons why I’m confident in the long term future here that you don’t get to see by looking at the numbers. Have a great weekend everyone! (Even you idiot shorts)

"Tomorrow, traders and investors will start looking past the current over-valuation, to the future potential of this company to dominate their market space. I predict we see tomorrow in CRM, what we saw today in COUP, a steady and building positive sentiment that will drive the price up throughout the day. The only difference is, COUP fell down a LOT before this huge rally occurred, while CRM is going to fall down much less. End result: $170+ is a perfectly reasonable possibility for this baby, before market close tomorrow."
"Massive selloff, prolly hit 255's then slow rise. Sold my 200 shares at 269...return of 70% for holding about a year."
"No raise of guidance, it was an okay beat, but the stock can't move higher because of the movement of the stock recentlyThis stock will end up flat when everything is said and done"
Will fall more in September. Wait to buy this!
Sell Sell Sell

All these other trash companies are skyrocketing on mediocre earnings and CRM is just blah 
Expect this stock to Rise like the never going down Roku stock.
"was checking the holder list I saw  some interesting  why all the institutions like bank of America and others buy a lot shares on September 29 at price of $251 ? something big is coming, get ready people , i have my position at $225"
Some little Shorties will need to cover their options tomorrow and then another KABOOM!!! #rocketup
Cone on close green please lol
Citi Bank is predicting $ 300 per share any suggestion for hold or sell
"Much better price action today... looks like it is finally established a good base to spring upward, finally?"
Didn't expect this drop today. Can't wait for this to go back up after the Earnings beat today!
Good time to get in? Or should wait for sub 200?
"After the CC, the analysts and Market Makers may be even more upbeat tomorrow."
Who is long on this one?
There's the pop!
why are we down????
"CRM is my favorite beaten-down stock to buy in this market crash. Take away the COVID-19 event (Which I know is a ridiculous statement to make), and this is over $200 after that last blowout quarter. The fantastic earnings just happened to be released on the same day as the initial crash, and Keith Block was announced to be leaving as well, which doubled the effect. I'll take CRM for continuous growth and blowout quarters as long as Benioff is still there."
"Just Reported Benioff has sold 10,000 shares recently and much more throughout the month. Also other top execs have sold shares in June and July. I am not sure if these are planned or stock options scheduled for sale vs a open market sale.This may dampen the stock price for a day or so but believe we see $165 resistance tested, as those shares though quite a bit is minimal for Benioff overall holdings?"
I hope CRM does not fall below $220/share by Jan 8. Otherwise I'll lose a bucket load of money :( Such is the fate of the option trader
Let’s get 245
Upgraded to strong buy with a $309 price target. CFRA
I covered but this is not very strong tbh. a 2% move on a $315 price target. You would think it moves up 5% after being down 30% over the past month. Resistance at $226.57 if it stays below that price I think short play might be back in play...let's see
If market is down tomorrow we could see one of the biggest long squeezes in the history of the stock market.
"Get onboard early, before we hit 1 trillion market cap"
Big ML bump up on their earnings target.
"Sit tight, and don’t sell your CRM shares. This will be trading in the $230 - $240 range by the end of this week I believe. Low $220’s is an awesome buying opportunity! Good luck all!"
Should I sell now or keep?
$300 coming soon.
I bealive this will hit 300 by the August

Just rolled out of bed. Anyone know why CRM is up like 20% lately?
300 incoming
If CRM does 20% this year people will still be salty. Greed!!!!
Shorts should run for cover!!!!!!!! muahahahahahahahaa
it's not advisable to buy this dog with too many fleas at current price. apply the three days rules before jumping in. further down trends till Friday before any stability.
Anyone trying to tell you to sell is simply a short trying to make money
Don’t forget some targets are over 400.00 a share. Lock and load.
sep 170 calls jeeze. sure would appear that someone had a look at the numbers or is expecting some large announcement. 10% move.... guess it could happen.
Theres going to be a lot of momentum here! Ceo says 10 billion in revenue in 2018. This is going to be a winner!
Is it TIME to buy?
Crm is absolutely the best tech to buy based on growth. Incredible stock to own. Upside 350 downside 140
153.1 - Will Cramer be able to pump this back to 155 later today when Marc appears on CNBC ?
Overbought yesterday...avoid unless you like to lose money
"CRM Earnings PreviewAnalysts are projecting earnings of $0.75 per share on sales of $5.68 billion. I am guessing CRM will beat earnings and provide conservative forward guidance.I am guessing share price will drop. Where will CRM bottom out?Regardless, i will be holding CRM through earnings.What's your thoughts and plan with your shares?"
So when are the earnings to be reported ?
"230 tomorrow, may hit 250 by September"
Wowww
CRM is down 4.91% to $133.75
"So...the US Treasury Dept was just ￼hacked through Microsoft Office 365? Biggest hack in 5 years they are saying. Hmmm. Cyber security is one reason CRM bought Slack. Somuch more secure than Microsoft. Let this be a lesson: Microsoft sucks. People, there could not be a better time to invest in CRM."
At least it didn't close on the low of the day. That is the best thing I can say about this stock.
This is a very nice one and gives in-depth information. I am really happy with the quality and presentation of the article. I’d really like to appreciate the efforts you get with writing this post. Thanks for sharing.https://www.sevenmentor.com/salesforce-training-in-pune.php
Buying opportunity!!!
"Salesforce should buy Slack #Work, before somebody take this Marvelous company "
Market may be crashed next monday due to bad economic outlook and second wave of the pandemic....
Well done CRM. Upwards and Onwards!
"Hope Benioff does not throw a wet towel on his earnings, he usually hurts his stock by negative guidance comments or some political viewpoint. Just report the performance and leave the rest of the nonsense in the closet. Let CRM run as fundamentals dictate."
The CRM CEO understands business very well. This is why CRM bought tableau. Some investors know nothing about it. The CRM will have a great future. This is a huge buying opportunity!!!

"As the day goes, and the price falls, I’m even more confident of green fields ahead, Elysium coming! Fear not."
i am glad its selling off. if it runs to high before earnings it will sell off on good news...
Current -3% is fake. It will big red tomorrow morning (-5% or plus).
Good Luck everyone.
Earnings were beat how come this stock ain’t goin up?
"One of the few SaaS companies that hits annual growth targets every time. After this 3 month lull, this stock will be back at 250-60 after earnings for sure. No way people are cutting customers tools w/remote being so important now. And they came out with Covid Cloud SaaS to help the pandemic. Bull until 300!"
YEAH BABY BUY BUY BUY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE DEEP DISCOUNT AGAIN TODAY
nice drop will pick up more after selling is over

"Where is Salesforce? Is it still worth 10x sales? First, remember that these sales are subscriptions, which have had high renewal rates. OTOH, new containerized-app technologies may reduce stickiness. Second, revenue growth has been explosive, over twenty percent y/y for many years. If that were likely to continue for five years, I would call CRM ""still cheap"". But can it? New products (""Clouds"") continue to proliferate at Salesforce. Historically, these have achieved good market share eventually. OTOH, nowadays each product enters a market already full of cloud SaaS products. Historically, large competitors have been slow and unsuccessful when they challenge Salesforce in the SaaS space. OTOH, they have had many years to form and hone their cloud strategies, and Microsoft (and maybe others) are achieving good SaaS revenue growth. And, small single-product competitors have honed their strategies, and many are gobbling market share too. So: I think 150-ish is fully valued for the moment. The odds of a miss on earnings or projections are higher than ever. And, the odds of large competitors making significant new moves (like price cuts or bundling lots of services) are higher than ever. ( Because the tax law made them onshore huge stacks of cash.) Either event would cause a sharp drop and a buying opportunity in CRM. I am still overweight long CRM but lightening up lately, and looking for a good re-entry."
$325+ in 2021!!!
Is this good time to get in CRM?

Holding and buying. What an amazing stock!
get in before earnings or wait and see?
Held well yesterday! hope it can hit 157+ today
Why would you short a stock that continues to show growth in revenue...
Last minute trade was insane
Glad I bought during the dip!
what drop so much? a good cloud businesses
"Benioff knows how to pump his stock. If we take out SBC, then the true GAAP earnings are actually -ve."
Everybody calms down. Earnings are great and with a positive market sentiment tomorrow we’ll open up green...
"NUMBER 1 on Investor Business Daily Big Cap 20,I’ve been building a nice core"
CRM is up 5.31% to 130.90
This stock is completely out of favor on wall street.
Looks like some Splunk sellers are probably looking for a place to plunk down some money.

Swear on this! I was just at target and overheard two employees (manager types) who were talking about how they have been instructed to use the chat on Slack at least once a day to get used to it.
Buy calls now for fab 16 /2018 PRICE target $135
"Was sorry to have to trim profits one this one 6 months ago. It never disappoints, and has such consistent growth patterns....swings are less volatile than other cloud names in set sector"
327 target on crm. Don’t listen to the shorts.
Sold Short CRM at $181.15. Looking to cover here in the extended session at $175.00. If no fill will hold for tomorrow for same price. So easy to make money selling short these overweight bloated stocks that are way over-valued. Great earnings report and the stock still sells off. On a bad report I make 10-20%. On a good report I still make 4-8%. Win-win situation. So clear and obvious that this is the best trading strategy. Learn if you are smart. Stop following the herd. Stop obeying orders that long-term is the way to go. Or finding undervalued stocks and going long. No! Selling short on earnings is by far the safest and best way to double and triple your money every few months.
That was the best earnings I have ever heard!! Growth is huger than huge!!
Think ill pawn the house to buy stocks lol
Goodbye shorts
Where is the criminal Benjo? He needs to go to jail for spreading fear. Congratulations everyone!
Took it short from here..
Added some more at 76.20 today. That's a steal. Salesforce reported the best quarter of all earnings season last quarter and it's cheaper now then it was pre-earnings
My guess is 10% up after close. GLTA
Hope support at $220/share holds for CRM. I fear we might test $210/share over the next two weeks.
Every time I double money on a play I take half off the table. Making millions.
Looks lije a new monthly low is coming by year end below 200
"I like Salesforce a lot. I own some shares. It is tech, it is growth, it is software, it is cloud, it is remote work from home for many companies, it is well managed. My big concern is that Salesforce, like many companies, relies heavily on having an ever-growing list of businesses that use it, and even among each business they depend on it being used by tons of workers, the more the merrier. One effect of Covid is that businesses are and will be laying off lots of employees, some permanently, and lots of small businesses will be KO too. The landscape will basically become fewer companies with fewer employees for quite a while. So basically there is an effect of declining sales, even as other companies will likely migrate to Salesforce for the first time ever to help with remote work. Headwinds, tailwinds. I don't know where it all falls out in the balance, maybe higher, maybe lower. Benioff said it was a very ""challenging"" quarter, yet the analysts think he is giving conservative guidance which could set up for future beats. What do you guys think."
lol on quick glance and you see Microstation and this are very close for revenue and marketcap/profit ratio not underpriced nor over. this stock pe should be higher with the more room for growth period shorts here mad the short percentage is unreal high there scared

"Loving the new Health Cloud capabilities (new to me anyway) and partner apps. Ecosystem, security, and integration are key in health. Who's the competition in this niche? Seriously, idk. Not loving the competitive picture in Gartner's Digital Marketing Hub product survey. They put Adobe and Oracle capability equal or better to Marketing Cloud; all 3 r in the Leadership Quadrant. Blocking and tackling will be key. IDK how this battle goes now. This is Adobe's main product now. They will go all-out to ensure its success. BTW, market cap of ADBE is $60 billion. Seems a bit overblown for just one product, or is CRM getting a low valuation? Maybe investors like Net Profit margins over 20%, on $5 billion revenues at adbe. At Salesforce, new initiatives and new products proliferate like mushrooms. That's where the money went. They don't all have to be home runs - with a decent batting average, this company should start generating serious cashflow a year from now, unless they add a lot more new Clouds."
Target raised 225
We need a wall. Trump is the greatest leader in the world! maga!
Time to get out after this run and ring the register. I have recommended this at 180 several months ago and people told me the stock was going to 150. I just want everyone to n is that this is about real earnings. Good luck and take a little off the table at this point. Leave the $65 a share in profits and play with the house money now. Leave it and forget it.
any thoughts on the price CRM will be tomorrow?

Looks as if this is headed North
You need diversification. But where else do you see growth?
Let's just hope Powell doesn't cut these gains in half tomorrow!!
With all the new acquisition CRM is not growing much. It barely beats the estimate on revenue. Tomorrow it will get pounded.
lol all the shorties running for cover! and deleting their posts. don't short good companies lesson learned!
Stay in cash. You will not get this price to sell CRM for another 4 year
CRM is likely dead money until the next earnings release. I think we'll just be treading water between $210 and $225 till the next report.
What’s happening to this stock?
I posted this before earnings. This stock has run the same course over and over. It runs up to earnings and retreats shortly there after. I sell after earnings and buy back when it crashes.
"Salesforce price target raised to $290 from $275 at Mizuho2/17/2021 Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz raised the firm's price target on Salesforce to $290 from $275 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst's recent checks indicate healthy overall demand trends for software through January. Companies that enable digitization are still leading the way, although many legacy and/ or on-premises technologies continue to normalize, Moskowitz tells investors in a research note."
Last day of the “3 day rule” today. Hopefully we can move up more than yesterday and wait for what next week will bring.
"Now that we have 3 upgrades with $200-$210. What else is there to think? Shorties, you better cover now and LONG please prepared for #rocketup"
This is a 'very' low risk entry point into a long term uptrend.

"Where is the volume on this selloff? It looks very cursory, like most other stocks selling off with no conviction."
People may not agree with the Slack acquisition but Salesforce still has a huge foothold in the CRM space. They've exceeded their revenue targets each year. This month is the end of their fiscal year. IBM just purchased 7Summits to increase their Salesforce consulting expertise. I think we're getting CRM at a massive discount right now.

you guys are lucky this turd is at these levels - deserves to be at $60 and is going to head there. Companie's will put systems projects on hold in this shaky market - CRM revs will dive and this grossly overvalued equity will take a huge haircut.Buying puts as soon as the market has a relief rally. This is the single best stock to short and buy puts on - there is a reason why options on the downside are expensive - not a coincidence. See you guys at $80 next stop before we dive to $60.
Y’all thought it was dropping huh? Still laughing

"Haha, that’s all that it’s going to drop to? Cute. $185 open tomorrow."
With futures up tonight it should help crm tomorrow.
This also means Salesforce isn't in talks with Google (or Amazon) for an acquisition most likely. I dont think Google would want IBM doing the AI when Google is a leader in AI. For that reason I'm not sure why the stock is up on the news.
This is amazing and true growth company. They can reach the scale of $CRM in 5-10 years. Wow!
This will be 300 before new year
No position but this is going back to $250 before Christmas.

The stock will always catch up. Just be patient. It’s a winner for the next 10 years
CRM is showing some green in pre-market trading today. Hopefully this is just the start of the rebound to $230 - $240 plus that I believe is coming soon! Good luck all!

"Remember, no one likes this desperate acquisition, including employees, insider “planned” sales increased by over 100% just before the Tableau disaster was announced"
"After holding this stock for about a month, I have determined that the way to play this stock is to accumulate shares slowly, and take profits when the stock goes up $2-3 dollars. The stock hit $167 a few weeks ago. I didn't sell, and watched it drop $10. Now it hit $162.80 today. I didn't sell, and it is back down almost $5.00. The options traders have a bit of obvious control over the stock price as well. It may be a long term hold, but any stock price over $160-161 is a profit taking sell situation. Rinse and repeat."
"Whether or not SF is a good solution VS oracle or any other CRM, the fact is all SR. level execs feel comfortable using salesforce. And once you are in for good this will be a gold mine until another company like hub spot can figure out a way to displace them in the enterprise."

"I get the big picture on why slack is important. Can somebody tell me why they paid 26 billion in cash for it? It would appear CRM had all the negotiating leverage here, but got bent over the table by a company in its death throes."
No support before 180. It's done.
Well if you think about it UBER has lost over 20 billion so far and they have a 50+ billion market cap. CRM could go to $1000 with that thinking.
lets see it launch to 300
All cloud software down
It's dead company. 180 is coming to 160. Wasting money on buys. Check SPLK.
"Massive bull market next year. If you are going to be buying tech stocks, great opportunity this week."

Quite the narrow range today. Thought it might break below $210.00 but it held. Today might turn out to be a big yawn.

Don't bet against Benioff! He's got a great track record. This acquisition will ultimately prove in the long run just how great a CEO he is!
Salesforce is an old technology and it will stay within this range for a long time.200 coming soon.
crm grows rev but has only been profitable for a half a yr these revenue growers are being punished
Way oversold. Enough is enough.
"If you sold CRM, I feel very very sorry for you newbie., specially if you took a loss. You’ll never make money panicking. I learned my lesson long time ago. No stock goes up without a bumpy road. Tesla, amazon, facebook and so on and on and on didn’t just announce their IPO and become what they are now, it was a ride and you gotta be willing to go with it. The stock market is not an org that gives you money as soon as you buy. Trust the business, see the potential, hold and wait."
I lost my patience and sold all CRM I had. Never touch it again.
"If Salesforce really going to acquire Slack, where all that cash going to come from? Most likely Salesforce will sell some or most of its position in SNOW. This might bring SNOW SP down. Watch out over next few days !!"
Wouldn't bother me in the slightest if this stock dropped 4% today. Everyone who's down even the slightest of research into CRM knows it's a longer bull play and will reach 250 in no time.
If you had to choose between CRM or NOW which one would you choose in the cloud space? Thanks for any input.

I like the way Cramer says to buy the heck out of a stock like this one and then after it sells off like CRM just did then say the price needed to come down
The dow is not indexed there will be no money flow into them expect them to tank
ALMOST back at $225....This is amazing for the shorts and those who bought PUTS. Don;’t listen to the pumpers...they are losing BIG!!! BOOM...
should buy zm also
CRM is down -4.90% to 104.65
170 next
Looks like crm will have a good earnings report and outlook. This should help to push it testing new high. Happy trading and good luck to all.
"Yep, D's are definitely short."
"Sweeeet! 12,000 on margin. Waiting for a day like this."

Shorty got lucky today. Even though the market was red but we came out positive. Sleep on it for the next 2 days and Monday you will hear a KABOOM!!
bought more today
keeps going up ...
I'm buying saleforce at the bottom. 209
Power up
Another company blowing its brains out buying overpriced entities all the while sticking it to the shareholders with additional debt! Such is the new norm these days where shareholders get fleeced while those in charge live high off the sheepish shareholders.
This will go green today.
CONFERENCE IS GONG GOOD AND THIS STOCK IS WILL SHOULD BE OVER 180
Imagine where this stock would be if they didn’t buy tableau? Probably $170.
"the MACD is turning up - if you've been waiting to buy some CRM, you should consider doing so in the morning. Provided no uggo macro event occurs, the next stop is 236-240 - then we'll see if it holds. The thing people are missing about this dip - if the deal goes through, CRM becomes even bigger with Slack. If for some reason the deal DOESN'T go through mid-next year, at worst the stock goes back UP to where it was when the deal leaked ($260-something was it?). And that's not counting any other impressive CRM announcements between now and then. Those are your two possible outcomes."
"Always add to CRM on big stock dives....by the way, this is not a big stock dive...."
CRM is in such a good place to lead the new way of doing business post pandemic. But are they too large to adapt? They will lose out to the smaller more agile companies and lose market share unless they start to adjust.
About time this moves higher. Hoping it really jumps one day. This is the leader in cloud. One day everyone will know this
Isn’t supposed to be green?
Salesforce just made me a millionaire. Thank God!
Benioff was considered a visionary when he started CRM. He's been behind the curve ever since and overpaid on all acquisitions. CRM might become a 50B company but with all the new stock being issued we shareholders don't benefit much.
Thank you.

Slow and steady! Saleforce will be 300 by year end!

"Folks, yesterday I bailed from CRM once we dropped below 220 and hopped to Amazon. $220/share support is weakening. Yesterday it reasserted itself but opening below 220 is not a good sign. I think Amazon provides better firecover over the next month vs. CRM. Opinions?"
"RSI is 25, way oversold, this is insane, should be around 250 now."
"Lol at Cramer. What was it...three weeks ago when he said CRM under $150 was a buy, now at $140 he says it needs to be left alone with the other cloud kings because it hasn't dropped enough?? And he wonders why his nickname is flipper lol"

Good ole fashioned long squeeze in play here
140 145 yes sir up
CFO Marc Hawkins suddenly retires at age 61 on the same day they announced Slack acquisition. No comment or interview provided by Salesforce. New CFO is promoted from head of legal.Co-CEO also retired in February - no explanation.Hasty acquisition of Slack after Benioff announces no more near term acquisitions just a month ago.Huge amount of sales people incentivised to book sales with little concern about customer support afterward. - see online reviews.Internet report that profits are booked at time of contract signature not services provided.Is nobody else seeing red flags here?
Its another sell off day and it will continue
Really need to stay at 220 as it is pretty much the 200 day moving average and where the breakout to the downside of the ichimoku cloud happens
But could pop into open tomorrow!
This will be very interesting. I swear I always knew this would happen.

The reason for CRMs weak performance? Many big money traders like me were not impressed with the low quality earnings beat and also the guidance was a disappointment
"Almost across the board, analysts and stock pickers....state that this is the #1 stock to own for the next 20 years. Block Chain, Remote work etc..."

"The growth will continue for a long time. When Benioff said doubling the revenue to 20 billion he meant it. Think about all of the growth drivers. Sales Cloud (the CRM portion of their business) use to carry the major share of the revenue. That's not true anymore with the growth of Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Analytics Cloud, Commerce Cloud, and App Cloud. These clouds are growing quickly and soon enough Salesforce will be the leader in those markets as well. Also, 3/4 of Salesforce sales comes from the US. Once they start expanding to Asia Pacific there will be another huge opportunity for growth."
"Shot up like a rocket into the close, opposite of normal closing patterns. Maybe related to options expiry?"

Hey Guys.....Pete Najarian of CNBC just profiled CRM on options which he said lots of buying on the October $170 calls for $.35 cents. He jumped in as well expecting getting back to recent $166 highs. Najarian also said CRM has been flat of recent and expects Benioff is going to get the stock moving again going into earnings season.Take it with a grain of salt....just thought it interesting and worth sharing.
CRM investor relations will not answer their phone. Out and gone.
"No pump, look at nfusz.com Ticker FUSZ Looking to uplist this year. But this company has what the rest of the CRM market doesn't. Sales!! All their notifiCRM products are not like any other. Oracle deal, Marketo."

A great company!!! Huge buying opportunity!!!
"Today I downgraded CRM from sell to strong sell, longs, you need to sell and go short"
what line do we need to hold here?
CRM may have a 50% retracement to the $200 area as that is the next Fib support level. Just broke through the 38.2% Fib level
Should open at 165.00
Only made $0.22 - very pricey stock.

"Looking to purchase some CRM due to the current dip so I have been looking into recent ER:- Working capital is still less than long term debt however has increased by 1.6bn since last 2 quarters and is positive. This will be impacted with the acquisition of Slack which may put CRM in a vulnerable position for the short term.- Strong increase in revenue year by year and strong increase in earnings.- TTM PE approximately 53x based on current SP. A somewhat high valuation but also in an overvalued market.CRM tend to use non-GAAP figures, with the exclusion of stock-based compensation to employees, as a measurement of performance in their report which I have disregarded as this is not a true reflection of the companies performance. A solid company still within the tech valuation bubble but I think still a good buy at this price. Will buy a small position tomorrow. GLTA"

"Think it's a done deal that $CRM (Marc wants it done, buzz) is buying WORK! Yep, ACRX under the radar with BUYOUT chatter on Wednesday, think PFE will take them out with game changing science: """"AcelRx Orange Book patents into 2031, with more patents pending are PRICELESS!

"guys, what do you think about the market tomorrow? will we go up or down?"
I am patiently waiting for 210
$200 in few days guys
"Looking to get a small position here today, 10-15 shares. Never bought into this company before as the price was too rich for me. Are we going to see that 210 bottom some of the negative nancys are posting about below? Acquisition looks good, from what I read this thing should shoot up over the next couple weeks to 230-240. My opinion is this 220-223 range is the bottom before a spike? Good place to start...Thoughts?"
"This absolutely won’t last. Correction is coming soon, could be this week, likely Friday."
Whatever concerns that people may have is already baked into the price - excessively so. The stock will spring to the upside very soon. Risk / reward is to the upside - big time. I would not want to be short here. I have shorted various stocks before and held on too long and lost my profit and took a loss. My advice to shorts is not to be greedy. I have learned this the hard way.
New buyers of CRM who thought the stock was pricey will step up. CRM needed to buy WORK. This will lock in more customers in the future and add at least $30 Billion in market cap. The gap from August will get filled allowing new entrants an attractive price. Sometime next year we should see a new high for the stock.
Why is it selling off in aftermarket? It makes no sense.
CRM lost all the gains plus in after hour trading- haha too bad longs
I'm holding it I got it at 252.. no choice but wait
F the institutional RIGGED investors. There used to be a day and a time that strong results meant strong upward trends. This stock is a DOG now. It's on the list. They kill results and the stock is down $16. LOL. F everyone.
I hope they announce something big in the call
What’s so good about this stock ?
TOO BAD IF U DID NOT BUY ON THE DIP HEHEHEHEHE
HUGE BEAT BY DR DRE!!!!
You're better off buying United States bonds than investing in CRM. More pains ahead.
Um what just happened?

Looks like under $120 soon. All tech more downside to go. Have cash ready to buy!
SOLD IT AT $249.28 MADE MY MONEY THANK YOU CRM -- PROBABLY WILL BUY AGAIN AT $220 AFTER EARNING REPORT
$227 pre-market...that's what you get for buying a company with NO earnings...
Up in premarket that’s the way I like my positions!

Buy or sell before the investor meeting?
Benjo is unleashed. Be aware of his mental disability!
This company always comes roaring back. Always add on big dips. And never bet against Benioff.
"When I heard there was a 2x more call option on this stock heading into earnings yesterday, I decided to buy the puts and boom. Too much optimism here when they are overpaying for WORK. More headwinds coming up."
How about a 3 for 1 split and blow out quarter!
"LOL looks like ""Uncle"" closed his short position under $221. He stopped posting."
126m profit in 2019....Paid 38b for slack
big outage
MSFT should have snuffed WORK when it had the chance to buy it cheap. CRM gonna crush MSFT
wday even UP in after hours..so will CRM or tomorrow big UP day for crm
Can you believe the manipulation from Seeking Alpha. The last paragraph requires him to make a disclosure of any positions. He says he may take a short position in the stock. Notice he says “may” because he wants to see if he can persuade people first. The author Paulo Santo says the stock may go lower and gives some crazy reasons that are all speculation and don’t make any sense. Salesforce is the leader with real earnings and huge growth ahead. Revenue continues to jump 2-3 billion a year. What manipulation from some dirty players. I hope he takes his shirt position and I ask all followers to watch this situation and this author will lose money. Total unethical manipulation. Especially when real analysts like Cramer and others in CNBC are long and are saying to absolutely buy and add right here at these levels.
"BOX is worth 2X today's price but it won't happen organically for years. With half the employees under water on options, acquisition is a must. $IBM $MSFT $GOOG $CRM $NOW $ORCL or a private takeover e.g. Softbank"
Little D is sounding anxious!
"Why is beating revised substantially lowered estimates such a big deal? The action in CRM after hours is as detached fom all reality as the US stock Market has been for now over 6 months. Bubble doesn't even come close to telling the story on this stock and so many others. With 132 trading days since the March declines, the daily average volumes on all three major indices are nearly half of normal volumes and that my friends must tell serious investors something and why there is still so much money on the sidelines. As far as thanking MOTT (Morbidly Obese Tubalard Trump) for any contributions made to the 6 month rally from the lows, don't even go there until he makes good on a China Trade Deal that still has not happened, was never really in any phase of completion and for that matter will never happen despite the incredibly misleading, incessant and ad nauseam daily hype (every single day for the better part of three plus years) that it was imminent."
They should go buy IBM while they are at it
1. Salesforce is growing over 20% a year 2. Salesforce Profit Margin is over 19%3. Salesforce need to pay a bit more for Slack to satisfy the clamor of existing Customers. 4. Salesforce will get its investment back.5. Ignore Negative Analyst who are complaining about the purchase price.6. Salesforce and Slack keep on making money everyday.7. Sales Stock price will just move higher over $300 by 2021and many more
Today’s huge accumulating... is for the surge! 
Hikaru...skid marks on your shorts?
"CRM should regain its respect tomorrow, 10 year bond is sinking down to 1.4 level, future is very strong, I think CRM should back to above $230 and in low $250 by Friday if the yield bond continue on the down side."
To be down 40 cents on a Tech Wreck Day is awesome. We flirted with $160 for two days now. We will be knocking down the door shortly. Good day for CRM. GL
Investors' Business Daily which is driven by both fundamental and technical analysis rates CRM as a 99 out of 100...Got it?
5 euro down after market close. Very strange?
Don’t see how this is going be good for CRM going up in price. SF CHRONICLE: Salesforce restricts Republican National Committee’s usage of its products
See you at $300!
Can’t wait until this loaded spring gets released
This will see 200 before it ever sees 100
"To all you shorts: You guys are insane shorting one of the best tech stocks on the market with 30% yearly growth. And to make matters worse for you, Cathie Wood (look her up) entered a massive position last week. She sold the top on CRM then rebought DOUBLE the amount of shares (worth $22 million) last week.It's like you guys hate money."
SOLD my shares today. Made $10 a share within 2 weeks is not a bad deal....will jump back in when it reaches back to 120
Big time beat. Q2 EPS $1.44 vs. St. Estimate of $0.67Reply399
"Not shocked. They have beat virtually every quarter for like 10 years. They are Dominant in the Cloud, eating the Competition. If you want Co. that Beats Earnings every time, this is it. Solid Co."
poor forward guidance... stock drops... internal SalesForce people buy loooads of shares at a discount... slacks explodes and they made loads od money... typical move from Benioff
According to my charts if it hits 243 and holds that there is no resistance until around 275. I think it will take out the 275 high eventually. ￼￼
buy buy
"It needs to close the gap at $145-$146 range, so likely going to $142-$144 as Good Buy before stock reverses course to upside."
The last 100 years we never had a sell off that didn’t result in new highs! Some of these post are laughable!
End of fearness of coronavirus. It’s the time to buy CRM for a good ER...
"For its last 4 fiscal years, CRM has earned a grand total of $2.01 per share. That's not annual earnings, it's cumulative. We are in crazy time with valuations of tech stocks."
its cheap buy before earnings
Normal reaction to sales forces get ready to buy the market
another brilliant chance to add my short
"Chatter about a takeover, just rumors. Big volume, though."
More CRM please!
Look at options!!
Trading stop in Slack (WORK)
Bad chart?
buying 100k share for long
wow! this company is growing fast! down $11 today. time to buy?
This is a great time to buy shares from those selling their portfolios for tax harvest purposes. The sad thing is this will be too high for them to rebuy into next year lol. I wish I had more $ to overs into this
"I have more confidence in $MSFT than $AAPL and $AMZN and $CRM put together. However, I don’t feel that confident about its stock market returns.I have no explanation for this disparity."
this guy will rise after slack report earnings this month
Does anyone know why CRM is down while snow has an incredible ipo open?
I could be wrong but I think 213 was the bottom.
Still a great buy. It’s a $300 stock
Managed to added some at 220! will take some time but definitely will shoot back up. it is a norm for company buying over another to dip temporarily before rallying base on many past trend.
CRM gains Trumped...
missed chance to buy ar 159
Earnings day! 250 or 230 in the AH? Place your votes/bets.
CRM at cheap price buy buy buy . It has fallen after very good earnings . Slack acquisition dumping this stock . Hope it will go up soon
People buying index funds today will help $CRM.
Cramer says with all the ipo's coming money will come out of things like CRM. I can't imagine buying into some of the ipo's that are coming like Pinterest. I can't imagine Pinterest ever being proftable.
Data is the new Oil
Notice how Dhead disappears when CRM is in rally mode?
"CRM should be moving up from here heading into ER, not sure why not moving as entire market has been rebounding. Should be at least $150 by now. Cloud companies are the future and CRM is one of the leaders, I know its expensive here but its all about the future potential which CRM has a great future. Any opinions?"
I think it will ride between 220-230 for about 3 months. Seems like management likes it and this stock kills options. I won't be investing anymore in single stocks that don't pay a dividend. Ill leave that to ETF's and mutual funds. GL all.
"I'm hoping for $222 and add another 200 shares to make it an even 1000 shares, makes the math easy when it starts climbing again"
Microsoft rise VS CRM. Competition is ongoing.
I like how CRM is moving but RSI really high and you would think there would be some pullback like AMD
"I’ll add at $136, if it gets there."
"CRM is like a coiled snake ready to spring. Adios $160. All the planets aligned for a big move. Would not want to be on the wrong side of this stock at this time and place. Shorties I hope you are wearing your adult pampers, you will need them. Hehehe."
Big money. Upgrades galore!!!!
A decent volume today and eliminate weak hands!!!
Is there a chance someone like $MSFT $CRM $GOOGL buy $AYX?
YOU. LOVE. TO. SEE. IT.
"I think it’s ridiculous people are selling over a premium paid for tableau in one of the highest growth , highest p/e areas in tech . Companies who are not making acquisitions will simply be left in the dust by Microsoft, as well as the Microsoft/adobe partnership which even more directly competes with crm. Crm will also certainly get sales from tableau’s existing customer base ."
"CRM, I bought last week. Can't wait for the earnings to show top and bottom line growth! Guidance will be great, too!"
"omg..I just bought the other day at 207. already up almost 35%. I was reluctant and was ok with 50shares, now I will say I should have bought 200 and sell off some dogs but I am to used to buying stocks and watch them go down asap"
Downgraded to sell 2.5*
"Up AGAIN!!! Load up the short truck, CRM will be red soon"
It’s red!! CRM selloff continues BOOYA - short any rally

You have to be a player in Big Data of else you will get passed by simple as that. CRM wasn’t and now they are. You can argue whether CRM overpaid or not only time will tell but it was a must acquisition. I remember distinctly when CRM bought Mulesoft the cries that they overpaid and today it looks like a steal. If the BiG Data market is as huge as all accounts claim it is and will be ( the fuel that propels AI) then this was a great deal. IMHO

Challenge for Cramer and other foolish $CRM bulls on here — show me how Slack integrates with Salesforce’s core offering of CRM software in a proprietary way. I’ll wait.
"will SAP takeover of Qualtrix mean more competition for,CRM?"
Always the lower level employees suffered. What they got is the pat on the back for the good job done. While executives got a big raise and enjoy huge compensation. Lay-off 1000 with a blow out report? Why don’t these executives cut 10% their salary to save these jobs? No royalty at all nowadays
"Short term will re-challenge the recent $275 level. It could breakout to the $280-$285 area later next week.Why? Analysts are already changing target prices to the $300-$325 level, and institutions will want to take new positions. You saw this at the end of today's trading session......"
210-215 is bottom soon the bulls will show up. Think about it it’s pre slack valuation you basically get the company to a discount price plus slack. 300 by end of year. 230-250 in next 1-2 months
Undervalued to say the least! Such a good long term hold and buying op!!
"Once the tableau deal finalizes, CRM will jump up 170+"
thursday dow will be 800-1000 points down and this run in the market is just so that it can drop down further will get back here tomorrow around close
Wow! Salesforce spittin out 4% today? My oh my it’s waking up.
Still too expensive
200 today
Down 27% from its 52 week high. At what point is it oversold?
Keep buying on the dips. This is cheap
Tomorrow good to short open high and go down faster. Market is all time high and Weak volue time for crash any time
"maybe people are willing to invest in this stock, but they are followinf the three day rule"
lol bought 9 shares at 252. Now its at 220 after the slack purchase now I have to chase back my loses :(
There investment in SNOW probably pays for WORK.
Dumped at 161 never to come back .The 160$ China wall resistance is proving inserpassable.
SO MANY 300 CALL OPTION
Recession?? HA HA HA
Market makers of options had this priced to move about $7. They are about to make a lot of money because this hasn't moved much.
"Salesforce will play a key role in scaling Slack up to more high-paying corporate customers in a major challenge to the momentum at Microsoft Teams and Azure. Indeed it also puts Microsoft’s email dominance at risk moving forward, too.The way Salesforce founder Marc Benioff sees it, Salesforce (helped by new addition Slack) stands to become the “central nervous system” of the corporate office — in effect supplanting Microsoft."
This should be up 15% on these results. Guess it will come tomorrow

Lots of sellers at the peak. Taking those gains
GREEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I posted a month or so ago that CRM was well overpriced after the Tableau acquisition, and they would need to go through the post-acquisition kick in the teeth price drop before i'd buy. Well...this kick in the teeth has indeed happened, and this is the time to buy. Let's be honest though, the analyst expectation of $183 in the next year needs tossed out the window at this point. I can't believe this hasn't been adjusted after the acquisition and the trade war."
I’m a little more patient I guess 20% growth sounds good to me. I’ll buy more.

Build integrations to Twitter - which SFDC already did - but no reason to buy it."
It’s going to be a good day tomorrow. Nice!
Salesforce upgraded by Morgan Stanley to ‘Strong Buy’ with PT of $295
Unusual Options Activity
Shooting for the moon Tuesday
As usual a run up into earnings which will be great and if a positive forward looking message is implied then $190 is where we will start to form a base. Thankfully in since $78
"Bought more under 67.50. Yes, Twitter would be expensive, but also strategic. Yes, LinkedIn gives Microsoft one advantage, but SFDC keeps all the other advantages that it has. Competition has heated up and SFDC remains the leader. Now that MSFT has spent a huge wad on LinkedIn, they are less likely to wage a price war.Today's huge volume is the selling climax after the recent downturn. Before that, shorts had been covering for a long time. Time to cover got down to around 3 days, so shorts had lots of ""dry powder"". Also, plenty of longtime long institutions have huge profits in this, they may be willing to protect gains by selling. 55 was the previous panic low. With the company 20% bigger since then, 65 seems like a likely bottom. Momos and their momo computers think this is the perfect short. I look at the new products, features, ROIs, customer retention, subscription growth, market share, TAMs, uptime, etc., and buy more."
New to this stock but isn't CRM trading at a nose bleed P/E level ? It could lose half its value and still be over priced.
How’s your charts for Wayfair at $365 doing Benjo? LOL. You bash this Salesforce saying insider sales is wrong while Wayfair insiders sell all their shares immediately while that company has more in accounts payable than cash. You hype bankrupt stocks while basing strong ones.
All major companies runs on CRM and it is expensive licensed software..it is killing competetion slow and study..reveneus with beat.. if they give/show better vision for rest of the year/going next year.. IMO stock will easily be in 165-175 range soon
Good action on the 260 calls after earnings. This may run 5% or6% before that.
Going up this week!
CRM's numbers were fine. The company will be upgraded by most of its coverage universe. Bias will be to the upside over the next quarter.
"look @ ACRX starting to climb, guess others are finally reading the ACRX news out this a.m. CRM $400 in 2022, $work brilliant buy... new $tsla on the way :-)"
The moment we’ve all been waiting for 
I think every stock I own tanked after earnings except this one. God doesn't hate me after all.
So glad I bought on the dip down to 150. Now let’s make some money. GLTAYMF
Come on hold on and finish green purse lol
I'm so happy to be a share holder of such a high quality company
Who’s gonna win... Microsoft or CRM? Hmm... maybe Microsoft... yeah Microsoft
would be funny if it closes like 250 still good though
I think the correction will start this week. What will the bottom be for SalesForce? 210.00? 200.00? 190.00? Everyone put up a number. I think this could touch 170.00 in a market correction. Keep your powder dry.
Why though?
Earnings look good to me
      o
Is crm going to get to 280? This week or 300? Or abosoultly flush?
CRM: CRM earning implication to sector: BUY NTNX big potentials or could be BUYOUT targetNTAP : could hit 72-75 next weekMU : 70-75 by earning in a few weeks
it will be $160 by the time Cramer rims Marc

Oversold... I bought in 300 shares today.. I will see you in 2022... I think this will see 300 before it ever see's 100.. willing to risk !
"compared to any FAANG or even zoom and tesla, this stock is way overvalued!!!!"
"Amazon, Apple, IBM, Microsoft, who will buy CRM?A bidding war is coming !"
I don't get it why is this so down before earnings ???;/ don't khnow if its worth to buy this until next year .....
"wonder if they will announce this deal prior to 12/1 earnings. dang, buy now or wait?"
I’ll take a high of $260. Beauty
"So no one is going to call out St. Mark? Greatest quarter ever but lays off 1,000 after telling everyone companies need to worry about more than profits."
What a winner.
what the hell every ark involved stock is down despite a better earning.
"It's trying really hard to breakthrough. Once it does, (hopefully today) we'll be setting new highs building up to dreamforce."
Must buy high pe stocks. All low pe stocks are priced for perfection. High pe stocks can only improve. 
"Honestly surprised its holding up...Earnings were clearly fine, but the guidance is very modest."
Amen nothing wrong with that.
Now down $64 from its recent high. The Slack purchase is costing shareholders a lot.
Could still get to $230 with a 4% Friday move. My $222.50 calls really would appreciate a little bounce!!!!!!!!
It’s bout time this goes up! =D
"Should be above 220 currently, underperformed market yesterday, waiting for catch up."
Well at least one good thing. CRM's competitors are climbing nicely today.
Marc is on Cramer tonight. He might dodge a bullet here with a good interview.
this stock has no growth or even slow growth and plus it doesn't pay dividend there's no reason to waste time and money betting on this rubbish company. when its back a bit higher im out.
"Teams, could give your customer and functional work flow data to the hackers/Russians. SLACK is secure.Why would u use MSFT products?"
How are partial crm shares handled in the deal anybody read up? Is it cash for partial share or a round up to a whole share?
Salesforce is about to catch FIRE and RUN UP...this has been basing for too long...you can see it in the chart. Boolean
I'd like to buy a bunch of CRM shares. But how does one rationalize buying with PE ratio of over 1200? I realize the market isn't always rational. But still... 1200 multiple is hard to digest. Welcome any well intended responses.
$200 in 2 weeks.
This should run tomorrow just like ttwo last week. It lagged Monday too on up day. Tomorrow the shift should be to earnings plays.
"Wow, analysts bumped the 22 numbers by a whopping 16 cents. That's easily worth a 30 billion bump to market cap."
I got $240 option yesterday and its up +4600%!!! biggest single day profit I ever gained.
Well they’re buying back stock cheaper than last week!!!!!
why so much resistance? reported great earnings. Any sector wide concerns?
"This probably isn't the right place to find the answer, but you never know. I have the design for a mobile and Force.com app. I have been researching SF and they have 1.4M registered Force.com developers. I need to find the best of the best. Any help would be very welcome."
Another upgrade today. 179 target!! 5th price upgrade in less than a week. Incredible!! Lock and load to 225. No brainer.
"I like how this company is quiet, i guess not giving much info to make incorrect analysis (some deliberately) that can take the stock price through a roller coaster ride. Check earnings results for first hand info...Like!"
patience
No it’s because the ceo is republican
The Trefis valuation on this stock is over $275. Anyone have access to the Morningstar valuation that they wouldn’t mind sharing?
Crm can borrow cheaply and buy the company now. Here we come $175 !!
"Even though we’re up a bit today, CRM is not going anywhere far from here! It’s boring for a while before WORK deal completely done! They said it’s until July 31st, 2021! Such a long haul!"
Never thought I’d see the day where salesforce is leading the portfolio
"8 price target raises, and we still have over an hour before the market opens. Let’s go for double digits!"
Anyone adding at this $153 level?
CEO wouldn't be coming on Cramer unless he had something good to say
shorted more at 117.70
"The reason why this quarter outlook was a tad bit lower than what the street expected is because dreamforce falls in Q3 this year not Q4. So the costs are going to hit in Q3 as well, whereas before it would have hit Q4. I'm long on this, they had a monster quarter and will continue to have a monster year!"
220s like I said. All you had to do was look at the chart. Stock was higher then it's longer trend. Then you throw in valuation and actual earnings. Stock is still up nicely on the year and higher then it was in the summer. I may add more here. Glta
Probably another day of pain tomorrow But by Friday selling should be overShould stabilize by next week
Will Cramer pump this later today ? lol
"I did not see anything bad about guidance or earning. If you are long do not sell today. If you are short do not buy today. I will not bet against this stock. If anything this stock was beating enough yesterday, it will be a green day today."
CRM long boys win! bye bye shorts!
Another green week? Would be awesome. CRM long
This market is fixed. Can’t beat a unfair market. So obvious
Stifel Nicolaus increased price target from $160 to $175.
This stock was trading at $193.92 on 2/19/2020. It peaked around $282 on 9/1/2020. I have owned this forever. $217 on 1/6/2021 was a gift. I think this drop is another opportunity to buy for a long term investor that doesn't already own too much of it.
Any thoughts on why we’re not seeing upward movement on Alibaba news?

Masonic organizations have created this Corona Hoax to PUMP the US Stock BUBBLE, to poison the population with harmful vaccines!!!Furthermore, the World countries are refusing to use the US Dollar as an international reserve currency due to unlimited, ruthless, and uncontrolled money printing! Despite so much terrible news US Stocks and subsequently, the Market Values of Garbage companies are hitting new records every single day!$AMD $NVDA $AMZN $AAPL $SQ $SHOP $SNAP $TWLO $CRM $ROKU $ADBE $DB $BAC $JPM $MS $GS $TWTR $TSLA $IBM $INTC $MSFT $GOOG $LMT $BA $TXN $NXPI $LRCX $NKE $DIS $EBAY $X $MA $V $S $T $F $GM $NFLX $CSCO $CAT $MMM $SBUX $TGT $WMT $ATVI $EA $TTWO $MCD $AVGO $JNJ $BIDU $BZUN $BABA $MU $AMAT $QCOM $WFC $BBBY $PFE $GE $WDC $BLK $KO $UA $ABBV $GILD $BB $ORCL $RH $KEM $IQ $GRPN $PYPL $MA $MOMO $JD $WBA $CVS $FB $W $BBY $SKX $FL $EFX $ETSY $W $UNH $SAP $GPRO $KHC $DPZ $PEP $LYFT $UBER $BYND $ZM $OLED $XOM $CVX $DAL $UAL $AAL $LUV $SAVE $AXP $SPCE $NCLH $CCL $NKLA $NIO $XPEVhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/18/barclays-says-market-valuations-at-dotcom-bubble-levels-downgrades-large-tech-stocks.html"
when is the breakout??
Where did all the bullish momentum go?...
Gonna be GIGANTIC Numbers today!!! On Cramer CNBC show today!!!! BUY BUY BUY!!!!
"Just hold. After shorties sell all their shares, the price will be up as CRM is a good current and future company. We look forward for the increase of share price due to a great outlook cloud business."
If you're selling CRM right now you're insane. The only reason you should sell right now is to use the proceeds to buy long call.
Last chance for the shorts to cover before it rocket up above $260 by tomorrow...
Sold at the open and as expected going to give up most of the gains after great earnings just like every other company. Crummy market.
"CRM made a very good decision today. Tomorrow whoever saying bad deal will shut their mouths, because they will be buying"
I predict a squeeze
Perfect buying opportunity presenting itself here. Longs can accumulate more shares and average up. Swing traders or investors looking for a place to start a position can also pick up some shares. I myself will be doing both as sales force has proved itself to be a great company to invest in. Good luck to all!
think ponzi
Are you guys excited about this week or less excited?
Microsoft's good earnings is a sign of how well CRM is probably doing.
"Customers love Salesforce. With Slack, they will love CRM even more. It's a win-win for Salesforce and its customers. WORK is growing and having some big name customers."
Classic bull trap. NIKE does the exact same thing!!
"CRM has underperformed the S&P 500 badly for a week or two and is 10% under S&P for a 1-year period. Sentiment for CRM has soured. This is not helping my portfolio.I bought another chunk today at 73.15. Reaching a ""quite overweight"" position in CRM, aka an ""American Position"". :) I've been buying on dips for many years now, don't try to talk me down now!"
I’ve been unwinding since the last earning.....now looks like I’ll start rebuilding the position..lolz
own CRM dont trade it.
"Wow. Back in 2012 - 2014 I worked at Salesforce. I participated in the ESPP. We got a 15% discount off the price on the initiation date of that years plan. The max I could contribute was 25% of my base pay. I was only in the plan for 12 months but was able to get just over 1000 shares ~$32.50. Gonna just hold on. I sold sum covered calls the other day and got my teeth kicked in. Had to buy back at a loss. But, obviously way up overall."
The bottom is clearly in place now.
"It’s just some tax loss harvesting, nothing to worry about"
Profit-taking today after a huge rise.
Nice pullback. Good day to load up the truck. CRM in a sweet spot.
Twlo move is the guide for crm tomorrow. Poor Shortie .
-4000 P/E... NEXT PLEASE
CRM has been on the sideline for couple of days. This week we will rise!
I bought it today only for 153.27. thinking it is a good buy :(And now I am sitting with few thousand's lost
"Sad day, very sad stock."
"Premarket pirates trying to push up the price- ain’t going to happen, you can’t miss earnings this much and not have a MASSIVE sell off"
What a horrific performing stock after such a big market up day. It’s a no touch or possibly a Short until a breakout happens in either direction.
CRM is up 4.96% to $146.14
CRM had a great quarter report.I think if they would have missed it would make sense for the stock to be down. forward guidance is subjective and can turn positive. Buying on the dip.
#CRM has been showing support at 146.78 and resistance at 161.20. Bullish crossover in MACD and Stochastic oscillator. http://www.foxchart.com/share/613449707.png
Can someone explain to me who in their right mind would sell this stock!!?!?
Hey ownership.......HOW ABOUT ANNOUNCING A STOCK BUYBACK
"at some point, like earnings, the stock will finally stop this no where move...it is so under valued and really unloved. Boolean"
