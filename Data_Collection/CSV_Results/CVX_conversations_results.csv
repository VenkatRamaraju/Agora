Recent headlines and conversations for CVX
solar and wind are way too cumbersome for output generated.......in the long run it will be too damaging to the environment to say the least.....it's a shiny object and the left has no clue.....
"It doesn't make sense, Goldman downgrade CVX because they think others oil majors has more potential despite CVX's strong performance and sustainability of 5% dividend?? I think this is just to scare weak hands to sell."
Sorry Buffett but all car manufacturers going all electric in 10 years.
Stock is getting ready to pop!!
What is wrong with the graph?
Oil at $42.91
What a super bargain price accumulate with the full power.
The real crude price is $22 a barrell. The Price today reflect May contract which expires tomorrow.
"thoughts on price targets in 6,12,18 and 24 given everything going on, pandemic, and renewables...thanks"
"XOM got boost from talk of activist investor joining board that is more eco-friendly. I expect that CVX will do the same. Next their will be merger between the two with strong eco-friendly boards.Pre-merger will start to attract ESG investment although transition will be slow. Then will work with government to strategically allocate to clean energy with seat at the table in terms of timing and direction or re-allocation of resources. In addition, potentially get to work with government to keep people employed and re-trained if possible given backlash over Keystone deal.Bottom line - Strategic (timing and allocation) move towards cleaner energy, potential influence on gov't policy and US jobs, and one hugely profitable firm with increased investor pool. Does that make some sense?"
Shorting OXY oil and buying CVX
the move past $110 is due this week. could happen by wednesday..either way it's encouraging to see cvx respond like this
"Post covid-crisis the oil prices will be much higher than today. Air travel, road travel, manufacturing, production etc. all picking up nicely. Buy early and be rewarded next year. CVX & XOM are both in a lot of funds/etf's and are ready to rise. Meanwhile enjoy nice dividends and rising stock prices."
What’s up with XOM? It’s not carrying as well as CVX
So we are at pre pandemic levels and ev market is set to take a chunk out of oil companies profits any reason for this. Is the sector just as overbought as everything else. How can these stocks have no pullbacks for weeks on end. If there is a pullback after the stimulus madness people will be losing their pants
Downgraded by piper
The Coronavirus could well be a savior for oil. China will now add significant stimulus which finally may be the trigger to increasing their economic growth. Boolean
XOM 1% UP...CVX?
Fossil fuels are not dying. It will never be replaced by solar and wind. People are just living in a dream world.
"We should all thank any twosome Newsome for his great vision.....I bet the car dealers are delighted. Now join me in a reality break, first planes trains and automobiles as well as ships and most energy is still in need of fossil fuels for the foreseeable future. Now we all know he is the liberal Jesus but other than left wing gibberish and the proper use of generous amounts of hair gel what does he know?"
Should take a full quarter of losses to really see the impact of low oil prices on this commodity based company. IMO $45 per share is a fair current value. The full impact of losses and borrowing availability and capacity will not be seen until next quarter. Sold this @ $117 and not looking to buy or short.
2016 was last time it sunk this low if it falls below 100 im getting out!
"Chevron's Kazakhstan Expansion Makes More Sense Than Its Dividend PaymentsAug.17.16 | About: Chevron Corporation (CVX) Get AlertsCallum Turcan Callum TurcanFollow(1,105 followers)Oil & gas, long-term horizon, growth, master limited partnershipsSend Message|LinkedIn ProfileSummaryChevron Corporation's cash flow generation is sub-par, its strong balance sheet is shouldering the burden.The oil major provided some additional commentary on its LNG trifecta.The Angola and Gorgon LNG facilities are operational once again, and the Wheatstone LNG start-up date was pushed back to mid-2017.Tengizchevroil's $36.8 billion expansion in Kazakhstan has a development cost of $18/barrel and a production cost of $6.50/barrel which will add a very economical 260,000 bo/d.Chevron Corporation's Kazakhstan expansion makes sense, its dividend payments in light of weak cash flow generation does not unless energy prices rise materially."

Oxy reported earnings about an hour ago. Beat by $.11. Earnings were to be after close tomorrow. Strange on a Sunday evening. She is sending a strong message....I like her style.

CVX needs to buy CXO since it has the best properties in the Permian.

"Will we have such a thing of a ""classic"" electric car? I have several classic cars sitting in my storage garage and besides a 150.00 battery going dead the engine is ready to roll. I don't see any value in a classic electric car? What am I missing here? Mecum auctions in 30 years having a 2020 Tesla roll across the block? Nope... don't see it."
Right now Chevron and others are leasing space in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) basically big salt caverns that can store hundreds of millions of barrels of oil. Govt. wants to buy directly but congress has yet to approve. Trump wants to stop Saudia imports...but that oil is being bought cheap and going into SPR. Wonder how much they pay to lease space in there? I used to work for big oil...but it has been awhile. Anyone out there know?
"Any former Noble stockholder here? How did this compare to what NBL would have been if it didn't sell out at rock bottom 15 year low price? I never owned NBL, just curious."
CVX had a nice recovery today from a deep dip despite of the oil price fall. Tomorrow & Friday will be CVX's days. GLTA longs.
"APC is taking off, we could see a new and higher offer by Monday.........jmho"
"The bar has been set super low tomorrow for earnings. Let’s see the cards and watch the show. Volatile market, will be interesting to see how this stock is treated."
"Time to short it again. If you take the operating cash flow minus depreciation for 2017 you barely get 1 billion $ , market cap around 200, sell"
"After Day after Day after Day of losses... article after article on how oil is dead,,, then I heard something on Fox News that made perfect sense. The fact that the Oil dropped so much especially after the game of ""Chicken"" between Russia and Saudi Arabia (plus COVID), shows how dependent the world is on Oil. This will not change for some time, no matter how loud the few are with the social microphone."
I have a hard time believing that CVX won't go under $70. again. This price rise seems premature. I was in earlier made a quick 12% and got out. So I watch with wonder. If I wanted to wait a year I guess it's a good price.
Back down to $59
Close the San Ramon office ! ......
Were the Saudis's attacked by Yemen??? Fake news???
CVX earn $2 and pay dividends $5 how will it survive ?
Everyone seems to be realizing all is not so roay in the economic outlook. Great earning releases last night and the market opens down. Looks like a correction is underway. Can’t imagine what’s going to happen when chevron reports a 25% revenue drop yoy on Friday.

"Recent Observation : I saw an EV charging station being built across the street from my business. It took 3 months, digging, trenching, running high power, cementing, jack hammering, and hardly anyone uses the EV station now (and it's been open 6 months now)......and all the guys who built it didn't drive EV's..... they drive dually trucks, cement mixers, pickups, cranes, CAT bulldozers etc...... Last i checked all those things DO NOT run on electricity LOL.What I am saying is, the infrastructure needed, is going to use A LOT OF FOSSIL."
"NOW is the time to BUY !!! OPEC will announce on Thursday that they will not increase production; that should raise the stock price considerably, hope that's what occurs."
CVX going back up to $130+. Just look at the chart technicals. JP Morgan and BAC buys and huge call with CVX and JP at 10am PST. Get in now!
CVX acting poorly
wow! up afterhours
"$96 very conservative estimate , with noble and slight increase in demand CVX should go to $121."
Oil up. Dow up. Why is CVX down?
Oil is beginning to behave like the tobacco stocks. Provide what consumers demand until you are taxed out of business or sued out of business. I'm surprised Chevron is still allowed to develop new customers by advertising to children -- everyone sees those talking cartoon cars.
FSLR JKS SPWR - Solar stocks are going wild
I say the fires from Western US does more harm to the climate and environment than any green new deal can help it. If you want to spend trillions of dollars on a green new deal your foolish.

I have no doubt that CVX will rise to 3 digits by the end of the year.

The whole oil industry remains stable in stock prices regardless the negative price of barrel this week. Who thinks these oil stock prices will remain stable the following weeks? convince me if you think they are stable because I think sooner or later the whole industry is going down including Chevrom.
LOOKING AT 83.50
This is getting beyond stupid. I understand the need to balance long term goals with short term price appreciation. OXY wants a pricing war let them have it. We collect $1b and we can use it to buy more CVX shares. We get out of this deal and the stock would be back to $126-$128. Enough of this BS. I would not pay a penny above the agree price of $65. This is really getting to painful and cvx mgmt needs to take a step back. Good idea but it did not work...
Oil is essential for the planet! Hold XOM and CVX!
"Even if the future is electric, the retail assets of Big Oil can be converted to charging stations (Big Energy), so the assets are pretty undervalued imo"
Chevron and Baytex Energy going to do well!
Well im holding this stock a few more years just fo dividend ...So in a way im glad its staying in a range. Because no matter what the FED says OIL transfers directly into inflation. The only people who like inflation are the rich and im not one of them
"Crude oil trading below 10.00. $ 80 not sustainable for CVX, big fall coming shortly"
"SUN a takeover target as Trump releases the grip of regulation? Seems CVX would be a lead candidate to want to buy SUN! But I foresee a bidding war for SUN by the likes of XOM, RDS and others... Seems to me the early takeover offer would have an advantage."
This whole Saudi/Russia oil spat is looking more and more like a team effort. Its supposed to start 4/1?? Im thinking they reach a miraculous agreement between Sunday and Tuesday. Their contribution to the worlds economy is nothing short of economic terrorism. imo$2222.sl$uco$ung$cvx$bp$rds.a

dammit I shout have sold at 127
Sector is hot -- also look at Earthstone Energy/ESTE. Do read about CEO Frank Lodzinski who loves to build up these small oil companies and then sell them off -- perfect for earthstone that he now has so well positioned to first benefit from this bullish energy time and to sell it off later.

Dead money comes here to live for 1 year
"I thought they would buy XEC before NBL. XEC is already involved in very friendly and productive joint ventures with CVX on their 400,000 acres in Permian. I am guessing CVX wanted the Mediterranean assets that NBL holds more than Texas. NBL's Mediterranean assets have long since been given no value by the market. I still think XEC is next in line but I would much rather see someone buy OVV for my own portfolio. Of course, OVV is much bigger than either of the above in total productive acres held and daily Barrels per day revenue production."
"Just sold at $85.8. It's been a nice ride. I know in normal times CVX is worth over $100 but with oil in the mid 20's and EPS estimates for this year at $1.45, it means CVX is now trading at 70 P/E (!!) and not even much dividend yield to buffer this valuation. There are much better plays out there in the energy sector."

"Paid too much a premium , that’s why stock dropped. Long term this will help, w divy drip we get more shares. One year before cash + so not a lot of reasons in short term (outside of oil spiking/ng) to rise much, but long term this will help. Just wish we got a better deal on it"
Buy at 50. Cut your losses @ 35.
"I like when King Midas, Warren Buffet, buys up shares of my stocks. I love the color green. CVX Rocks!"
I wonder what OXY was thinking when they outbid a super major like CVX on the Anadarko Petroleum acquisition? It should have been a hint to them when CVX quit bidding that it was overvalued. I think all of the smaller players (like OXY) might get crushed this time around.
Wow. Those 13 Republicans in Michigan arrested by the FBI were plotting to blow up the capitol and KILL state troopers and police officers. They were strong supporters of Trump.

"Maintaining a 6% dividend while interest rates are at 0 means the divide won’t stay at 6%. Not bc they will cut it. Bc the stock price will go up to bring the dividend as a percent down. This isn’t GameStop or amc but institutional money will flow into these high yielding oil stocks as the covid recovery revs up oil demand in the spring. Expect 110 by June. Then depending on how quickly global oil production ramps up, we may see 130 by year end as oil price hits 65 a barrel. Think about that for a second. Chevron broke even at 33 a barrel even with all of the costs associated with adjusting for lower demand."

"$XOM $XLE $CVX $OXY $TSLA For those who say oil is dead - executives from American oil and gas companies met with the White House today to discuss the new climate & infrastructure package. It’s notable that Elon Musk, Cathie Wood or the new trendy green CEOs were NOT invited. As I’ve said countless times, existing energy companies will be the leaders with their existing engineering capacity, financial resources and global structure. They will likely receive grants from the infrastructure bull to develop carbon scrubbing tech & alternative fuels. In other words- to invest in $XLE and it’s component companies is to invest in tomorrow’s green companies."

The Saudi says ""Because I am forbidden by my religion to drink alcohol, I will have an orange juice."" The Chevron oil executive says in a huge Texas drawl "" I'll have a double shot of whiskey, a beer, and a bottle of your finest Champagne."" The Russian and the Saudi both say, ""Hey Chevron! We are not paying for all those drinks you ordered."", so the Chevron executive says ""Hey, no problem. We'll split it three ways.""And that's how Chevron will win no matter what in these negotiations and run over their American competitors with more debt and fewer assets."
What cracks me up is a close inspection of CVX qtrly report shows they lost money in US oil production. So the Permian isn't driving upside here. Mid and downstream/chemicals are the money makers. Stock now at 40x or so??? Lol

"Oil just won’t recover WONT in 5-7 years barely any cars using gas, landscaping equipment and other small gas using devices all going battery so where is oil’s growth going to come from? Sounds like bashing but I’m not just trying to understand why buy any of these stocks for my IRA."
Brent oil has been above $55 since 1/8/21
"Its funny how the most of the media has not mention the large release of OIL and Gasoline reservesPOTUS released Think i was 1,000,000 barrels of oil from our country's strategic reserves and 500,000 barrels"
"The major oil cos. are underperforming, so what's new."
Should hit $90 this week
We a green day. I will take it lol. I still say this is one the better buys in the market right now!
Oil expected to settle at $30 a barrel
I’ve been having gay thoughts about some of the other people in this conversation board
If the price of oil can stay above $40.00 can CVX maintain its dividend?
Gee who could've ever predicted gas prices would rise in the summertime? I mean it's like yeah this has happened every year since people started tracking this...but COVID is going to make oil obsolete?Which? I mean oil prices as very low and people are THEN going to switch to a much more expensive and less efficient tech like EV?
"Look for companies that have properties in NM or in the western part of the Permian , areas that have not been drilled out . A lot of the area has been over drilled and production has dropped off quick. Most of the drilling is moving that way toward the west that is where they are finding the best wells . Some of the smaller companies have properties in that area and might be bought up or merge with other small companies . Some of the larger companies have more of the older production areas Pioneer has been laying off workers here lately both field workers and mangt. Some companies are heavy in debt ."
Heard this morning that APC has officially accepted the OXY bid whatever that means. So do they automatically pay the 1 bil breakup fee to CVS by accepting the bid?
PLUG FCEL BLDP are the next energy revolution!
All the shorts are crying....

Nope...103.00 on the radar
"owns 1.5 million acres in Texas and new mexico. no expenses to maintain leases on 1.5 million acres of the most easily to drill with the highest production anywhere, i would say as long as oil and gas is a major used fuel that CVX holds the best position of any of the majors. drilling cost and highest production shale in the usa, that saves a ton of money,"

"It may or may not breach 80 today, but predictions with such surety as yours makes it reasonable to assume the market has removed effortlesly monies from you. Oil is in a precarious spot. Better now to use options on both sides of the trade until there's confirmation of direction. Good luck."
Big move tomorrow after Chevron $CVX and Phillips 66 $PSX report earning before the market opens. LOAD THE BOAT!!!
between here and 69.00 is your buying op
sloppy report $ 80 soon
high 80s low 90s by Christmas no problem. countries and states are opening back up and ppl will need gas along with air traffic
60+ oil is coming. Decreased capital exp. in the last few yrs and Saudi reduction of oil are the best recipe for short supply.
curious ... one day of oil drop would put cvx earning in danger?
I said going to 115 now I see 110 buying at that price
I have cancer
"Oops 46 vs 11 for PE, CVX vs XOM"
Anyone saying if it drops to 90 or 95 or whatever number before I buy any isnt someone I consider a holder of long term. This is a long term stock with great stability and dividends key word dividend. Go buy tesla if you want high risk reward
Wow. Nobody called this. Market up over 1000 points. Oil up 10%. CVX up over 6%. Wow.
I like CVX in the long run. I continue my accumulation.

NOT A DIME OUT OF MY POCKET TILL 103.50 !
CVX needs to back out of this acquisition. It is a big mistake to get into a bidding war.
Oil Down $4 overseas.Trump Babbling obviously wrong.
payout ratio = 233% ? where are they getting the money to pay the dividend ???
"after the last presidential debate, is anybody who works in the oil and gas industry going to vote for Biden?"

My only green stock. Let me know if Cathy Wood is thinking of jumping in. Apparently she is buying everything else I own and that ain’t so good.

"Chevron is smart not to jump in the wagon of EV chargers. EV chargers in gas station won't work. Nobody want sit in the car for hours for nothing. In restaurant parking lot is OK. But most people will charge at home and won't go long distance travel with EV. For long distance travel, only gas car is the choice. If hydrogen car is available, then hydrogen charging in gas station is the choice and long distance travel with that kind of car is possible."
"Chevron Announces Quarterly DividendThe Board of Directors of Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) declared a quarterly dividend of one dollar and twenty-nine cents ($1.29) per share, payable June 10, 2020, to all holders of common stock as shown on the transfer records of the Corporation at the close of business May 19, 2020."

All gains yesterday about to be given up today.....then the bears renew their attack on Monday LOL
"CXV showing great discipline in not overbidding for OXY. Yes, APC had a lot of adjacent acreage fo CVX's Permian Basin acreage but their are other possible acquisitions in the Permian Basin to name a few; APA, CXO, EOG, SM Energy, (purchase of acreage from the TPL Trust) But ""no"" to CHK, way too much net debt! Chevron has a plan, and it will be well executed."
"We should be buying oil from the middle east, and tap down on our oil. We need to save our oil for the future. We don't have the oil to waste right now. Saving our oil is in the best interest for the U.S.A. B"
This Junk keeps falling every DAY!
"The Buffet business changes nothing really, their (Occidental) bid is exactly the same as it was regardless of internal financing mechanics. If Chevron had intended to up their bid, I would guess that they still plan to. I expect them to come back with a bid in between what they had originally offered and Occidentals bid, with possibly a raised cash portion ."
do you think chevron will still have a future in a world of electric cars?
OVERSOLD 2.6%?
"hence the word ""cyclical"""
Maybe using their oil and gas reserves to mine Bitcoin might boost their profitably
"I have been in CVX since early 2018 at a $110 or so price. I did buy more on dip in December. I hold for the Dividend, but thinking about selling some if we get near $125. Now that acquisition fight (oxy) is done, do we see CVX up near analysts estimates?"
$50 by the end of the year!!! Oil will never see 50 again unless there is a middle east war with Iran.
Fok Bank of Amer!!
I have written this before 62 is the bottom. Wait and see.
If oil hits 60 in the next 3 months what will the price of the stock be.
Buy PLUG and see it double within a week..
Sandro Clegane May post the same thing everyday but he is exactly right entire energy complex is trading like we have 60-70 dollar oil long time till that happens
Ohhh nooo oil is 65 ...Time to sell when profits are going way up??? I thought profits were a good thing. I forgot its evil oil even though the world would stop dead without it
$5 a gallon gas predicted in the United States I was seeing today
Thanks for the free money people who believed oil was obsolete after a single bad week. lolz. Seriously people...IT'S OIL.
CLOSING ABOVE $107?
I believe CVX will be a core holding of mine when the dust settles. Low debt/equity. Pay me to own it. Survivor in the carnage. And it produces an essential asset for humanity. What other core holdings will you all be buying?
"Pretty tough to buy low, sell high, eh?? Now up $20 bucks in a very short while..a few days. Now a story comes out saying....time to buy oil stocks? Not for those who bought in low $50s. Time to sell after a quick 40% gain. Down next week? I think so."
Why does CVX keep dropping and OXY goes up? Its kind of crazy.
This can't be good news for CVX can it ?Is this why oil is so low or is is because tesla and other car markers are going to make millions of electronic vehicles and gas demand will fall
Gap is getting filled.
Dividend not Sustainable. Crude oil supply huge .... Saudi arabia dumps oil cheaply . Trump is Koo Koo
the pe ratio is very high. price pumped up. bubble
So the junk survived? maybe

"Wow, I'd almost forgotten what capital losses were. But I'm still paying tax on the dividend."
Aug 3rd: Morgan Stanley price target to $104 (down from $107). That's a 24% gain excluding dividends.
How are Chevron operations affected by coronavirus?
Look at the 52 week low.53... glta Can you see trouble with debt or what kids
is cvx going bankrupt? Stock is behaving like it is!! #$%$
CVX should buy PXD 1/2 cash half stock.
Looks like Major manipulation of OIL prices and Oil stocks before earnings. They have been beating down OIL for months . My guess is we will get a huge relief rally after earnings . Obviously everyone expects them to be bad. Look how much Oil stocks trail the entire market especially tech. Loo for a huge rebound . I would be careful dumping shares into the wind

When we have friends like Israel and Saudi Arabia- what's not to like about big oil.
"... Biden was in support of a complete shutdown of the US Economy , and criticized Trump for not Locking the Entire Nation down . Now let's see how that works out for him if he has the Stomach to order a lockdown . Age old saying - "" Don't criticize a Man , unless you have walked a mile in his shoes ""."
"Headlines ""CVX dethrones XOM as largest US oil""......and then instantly underperforms them lol gotta love the market!"
"This is all speculation on ""THE GREEN NEW DEAL"" . The feeling being all Oil and Gas is going away under a Biden OAC Regime. SO if you believe it's Biden in 2020 then I guess its a strong short/sell. If you are a status quo person you know that Jobs are important and Oil/gas cannot go away as even most electric cars are ultimately fired by Gas fired power plants.I will say solar/wind can be great, but we are decades and decades away from such. Lastly ,if production is curtailed as contemplated we will likly get big oil price increases."
"One of the reasons for the downward pressure is BofA's Merill Lynch Analysis. Not sure I trust Merrill's opinion based on their past ethical lapses.

$CVX and $XOM are in the reverse direction with oil price ... Investors thought price lower then demand higher? Unbelievable.

"The week after last ER $CVX was $120's... might take a month but it should get back there eventually, long the dividend and think about the future technology in Hydrogen a ways down the road along with the $25 Billion buyback that retires all those shares and the need to pay those shares dividends as well. $164 price target, $130's coming down the pipeline. Hold strong and long at this level! Average in and good luck!!!"
Where is the bottom here?
oil cheaper than drinking water rediculas. If Trump does not change that he will not be elected again.

"Fact: Tesla has never made a profit from selling cars. Without government subsidies Tesla would be bankrupt.Fact: The NHTSA has just compelled Tesla to recall over 100,000 vehicles. It’s customary for credible automakers to self-report these issues, not to be forced by the government.Fact: Tesla is a very expensive vehicle with very little time on the market. Its long term reliability has not been tested or proven.Fact: The United States has an unemployment problem yet Tesla fans (they’re not investors-it’s too emotional to be an investment) think $40,000 base model cars built by a start up company are just what the masses want.Fact: Elon Musk made his money from creating PayPal. He’s not a manufacturing guy or an automotive engineer.Fact: $F has an army of highly experienced best in the world engineers developing a new electric F-150. Ford has vast experience in automotive engineering design and manufacturing from over a century of lessons learned - that Tesla still has to learn.Fact: The Ford F-150 is the best selling vehicle in the United States for over 25 years running.Fact: Other Real automakers are developing electric vehicles using their vast experience in vehicle design and manufacturing. With pre-established proven technology and supply chains.Fact: Tesla is currently valued at 1700X’s earnings - earnings which without Government Subsidies would not exist.These are indisputable facts.Tesla is the definition of a bubble. It’s not investable. It’s overvalued and will crash.The best corollary is NetScape versus Internet Explorer in the 1990’s...NetScape launched the first real internet browser - ie. Tesla as the first EV - but then Microsoft used its existing knowledge and infrastructure to crush NetScape.Tesla=NetScapeWhat should you do?Invest in real companies with essential products, growing demand and real assets that are trading below traditional valuations.

In the options markets The equivalent of 10 million barrels of Brent June 2022 $125 calls traded on Tuesday....makes you wonder
Would this be a good time to do a ROTH conversion?
Is Trump this stupid? What does he want? OPEC to start pumping out oil so the price crashes to 25 dollars a barrel bankrupting every oil company in America except for the Exxons
"My buddy, Warren and I are raking the cash. CVX is going to $150."
"I bought some cvx last week and will buy lower I believe. Get ready for jobs data, inventory data (tonight and tomorrow) and rig count on Friday. Next two weeks could be ugly. I believe it all takes off once virus cases start to decrease or a cure is found. Don't fall for a sucker's rally."

"Amazing how Investor Business daily comes out with the story I posted a couple of weeks ago and the stock jumps as if it’s a new thing. We have been planning this for awhile....in fact, it’s the second time around. Big oil around the world are getting into hydrogen in a big way...as more and more countries are putting new regulations and incentives in place. Gives big oil and new market for their natural gas...which is CH4....primarily hydrogen. Good stuff. Unless you invested in some of those small hydrogen companies after they shot up even though they never make money and dilute shareholders to raise more and more money. Can’t believe that’s even legal. But....”Buyer Beware” as they say."

What is the benefit of buying CVX verses buying an index fund like XOI? I am a novice investor and the index seems like the better play to double up in the next year or two. Is it just because of the dividend potential with CVX?
Will make a new 52 week high by the end of September. IMO.
FREEFALL! Down 1.5% with oil up and S&P flat.
CVX will be 118 by June - if it breaks 110 level -
curious if they were driving the price down for tomorrow on the 3rd Friday of December remember 2 years ago
"They used to include information like price per boe paid plus physical assets, projects. So how much was paid in terms of boe?"
Will OPEC cut production or are their talks jawboning to get the price of crude to increase? $XOM $CVX
Why is CVX going up-up-up with so much endless bad news?
Get out of OPEC and create N. American cartel....starve the Middle East butchers and send them back to third world living conditions. Oil would be just fine and we can continue going green to save the planet!
Many countries are trying their best to reopen businesses so hope to see CVX do well from here. Congrats to folks who buy on the low days
Stock is going to break $91 this week. Load up while you still can. Solid dividend!
Goldman Suchs has no idea what they’re talking about with downgrade . The dollar is going to drop and oil go to top $100 at some point in the near future.
Gas price went up but stock going down?? what the H***
Everyone should be looking forward to the weekend.....because the PPS can't possibly drop then.
"Energy companies getting into hydrogen production. Who has all that gas, CH4 being flared down in the Texas Permian? Turn waste into a revenue stream? That is what has started. Can be a huge windfall for majors like Chevron. Aramco, the Saudias are getting into it big time to supply China. So much potential in the resources of the majors."
CVX had decent quarter.....but Tech goes up while CVX dives.....Try driving your cars and heating your houses withMicrosoft and Apple...instead of oil...good luck with that.
"Another day with very low volume...CVX is like a plane on a runway ready to take off, or a plane in a holding pattern ready to descend...."
SELL ALL SHARES AND BUY GME and AMC.
it will retest 84 double bottom and then up again
Buy gold not oil. Oh there is none...Darn

"$AMTX $xom $cvx Aemetis did a great presentation today. Just one point very important that is not very clear for new investors.When you buy something, you should ask:1) What does this company do that its competitors don’t to?2) What does this company do that competitors will not be able to do? Biogas is a wonderful business at incredible low carbon intensity and Aemetis will be a leader:1) It is in the right place: California (1st countries for number of cows + 1st country for green energy innovation);2) It is in the right time: Biden presidency;3) It has strong relationship with farmers and “cowboys”1),2),3) come clear to the presentation4) MONETIZATION: Do your researches and will discover that AMTX is the only biogas player having an ethanol plants. This is VERY important since it is very easy to Monetize the biogas business. If you don’t have an ethanol plant, you will face very though issues to monetize credits in cash."
$XOM and $CVX should merge.
you are so right I wouldn’t play poker with someone I know is cheating why would I play the market when I know they are cheating

"geopolitical tensions, this stock is a screaming buy, on the dips like today."
Dividend Cut - Rumor has it that a dividend cut is being considered to weather the storm of sub $50 oil prices over the foreseeable future.
Anyone else notice all the negative news feeds directed to CVX? I think the shorts are behind all of this propaganda as they tend to hover over the market leaders to get to the sector. I've noticed this more with Chevron than others.
"Averaged in @ $ 75.03. Did not expect this to go up this fast. Do I keep forever, or take my profit and move on? It is about 5% of my portfolio. Thanks in advance."
"Average sold barrel price for 4th qrtr was $33 a barrel compared to 4th qrtr 2019 of $47. You do the math. Solid qrtr considering where oil price was. If oil stays above $50, 1st qrtr will be incredible. Also explains why they announced they are maintaining the dividend."
Can't get over that picture of the Robinhood CEOHe looks like a XXG
c'mon what is going on? cvx is backpedaling for all the wrong reasons.
"OIl is now negative $6.50. But that is May cash contract which expires today. Still....pretty wild. For those wanting to know how CVX stays up in price....they hedge out about 5 years, 90% of their production. So go back and look at this months price 5 years ago to see what they were getting. A lot. They will be affected in future if these prices hang on for a few more months."
Buy FANG instead and take the 1 billion.
It only took an hour and twenty minutes for the first class action lawyer to start trolling Anadarko.
"Chevron & Exxon will be late to the ""renewable"" party and growth opportunity....if they stick to oil & gas only...BP “We were zero in offshore wind energy some six months ago,” said Sanyal. “We now have 7.4 gigawatts gross in the world’s fastest growing market -- the U.S. -- and in the world’s largest market -- the U.K. We continue to look at opportunities.”"
The conflicts in the Middle East looks to possible have a big impact on oil prices. Things appear to be intensifying.
Covid has taught these oil companies like CVX to run more lean and more efficient. Once we get to $50-55 per barrel- they will blow away earnings!
The break up fee should go to shareholders in a special div. since we have had to put up with this underperforming stock for too long.
"The best day, 52 week high of stock is $ 127. Current price $91, makes sense ?"
Oh yes. one more thing. Rail will be transporting oil from canada to texas. So rail might be a good play here too. Just MHO.

"MY LARGE SUV IS 100% SOLAR POWEREDIt works like this: The sun (solar power) causes certain plants to grow, these plants decay naturally and turn into an “All Natural” Energy source that can be easily converted into different forms. One form, called “gasoline” is easily transported and stored until the solar energy is needed. I can drive straight through from Maine to California and recharge my solar powered SUV in less than 5 minutes by conveniently located charging stations. The solar power, (in liquid form) is pumped into my vehicle in a couple of minutes, and I'm back on the road again. If you doubt me, ask any geologist. If there was no sun, there would be no fossil fuels.You should try a solar powered vehicle, their great!"

I have to say...my entire IRA is CVX...and I feel great about it. I just add more anytime it's under 90...ever.
Oil and gas and services always rebound. The dumb Saudis and dumber Russions have killed themselves with their folly and American energy independence has dealt them useless hands. Hold in....the rickets are filled with energy and thrust. Boom !
This thing will be over $120 tomorrow
"CVX trading volume increased considerably today along with a nice price increase; hopefully, the stock will continue to increase prior to ex-dividend date (May 18)."
"More than double in a year. Wow. And with a nice dividend, especially if you bought in the $50s. They your divvy yield is double what they are showing. Imagine getting 12%...cash per year? What are banks and the 10 year paying? Wow."
"I know some of you might have seen the SEC Declarations of MW selling about 132,000 shares of his preferred Stock and so did the Legal Head of CVX to the tune of 111,000 shares at about $94.39 selling price. That isn’t the exact amount as I like to pretend I’m a news reporter. Never the less they sold well over 200,000 shares. Might not say much about anything. I’m a long term holder."
"Oils is still under 50 and battery cars are selling like hotcakes !retailers restaurants warning left and right !why is CVX green ?Check out Dennys,Groupon,Potbelly,Bojangles,Hanes Brands,etc"

"the Iranian revolutionary guard controlling Iran believes it cannot lose. If the EU complies with extended US sanctions then it believes that it will be able to use the economic tumult to tighten its grip over Iran sufficient to take it back to the ‘ideal’ of the Islamic Republic in 1979. If the EU does not comply then Iran will see increased revenues from oil exports to Europe, in addition to those from gas and petchems. The IRGC does not believe that, at this time, the U.S. will launch military action against Iran, unless it closes off the strategically vital oil chokepoint, the Strait of Hormuz. This is despite the placement earlier this week of the U.S. aircraft carrier battle group in the Persian Gulf region."
Extremely oversold . The big guns are out trying to get your shares and the dividend as cheap as possible look outthis is going to rebound hard . Look for market rotation out of the overblown FANG stocks and into value stocks
It will turn negative shortly

pe 53.92 a lot of oil co is at there pe or below chv holding up si far better then the rest lets see
With oil prices on the rise - u would think we would be heading to $120
"I bought 20 shares of CVX stock Monday and Tuesday at 95 and 99 bucks, yah me... I want more but not at these prices, if it dips I'll buy 20 more shares maybe even 30 more. When Warren Buffett began buying more Bank of America last summer I bought BAC just because he did, and I'm up about 40% now, BUT there were bad dips in that stock after he bought. I'm hoping for same with CVX. Right now it's hot, so I won't chase it, but if it dips, I'll get more."
A couple years back CVX gave a nice div increase and then a day or 2 later when they reported ir was a dud. Like this raise but doesn't mean 2 days from now will be good.
CVX DUE TO SPLIT...AND nice divy increase also!!!
This is the Berkshires secret stock!! Buy buy buy!!
Ex Divi date 7 days away. Exxon's was today... :-)

Here comes s good buying opportunity for CVX. Hold off as the price of oil takes a hit in the near tert
Again I don’t mean to be beating a dead horse but they should look at Apache.
"Reason Oil Will Continue to Run the World: ""83% of the World Has Just Started to Consume OilThe idea that the world has really just started to consume oil is one that is very difficult for some Westerners to accept. It's easy to see why: we have all the oil that we need and want. Americans consume over 2.6 gallons of oil products every day, and there are 255 million oil-based cars in the country. But, most of the world doesn't have it as easy as we do. A rising 83% of the world is undeveloped, and the transport demands for the poor are just now coming to light. The developed, OECD nations use 50% of the world's oil but are just 17% of the population. The rich consume 1.6 gallons of oil products a day, while the poor consume just 0.32 gallons. Given the importance of oil, this five-fold disadvantage for the poor is indeed a moral issue: oil-dependent Westerners are the ones leading the anti-oil charge. Our hypocrisy just isn't selling in the developing world, Mr. DiCaprio (a must read). Why would it? Poor people wanna be rich too. From 2010-2030, the poor nations are projected to add 800 million new registered vehicles.After vehicles, the second emerging oil market to watch could be jet fuel. Boeing affirms that commercial aircraft in the world will double to over 40,000 by 2032, with Asia-Pacific becoming the focal point of aviation. Jet fuel demand in the region has more than doubled to over 2 million b/d since 2000. A key reason why we have seen horrific crashes in Asia recently is demand surging faster than pilot training. Indeed, twinned with electricity, oil is the cornerstone of modernity where more demand indicates higher standards of living."" article by JUDE CLEMENTE"

"March 31, 2020Dear Stockholder,Normally this proxy statement comes to you in a new year amid market conditions that bear some resemblance to those of the prior year. Clearly that is not the case in 2020. We want to update you on how Chevron is responding to the unprecedented challenges the world is currently confronting.We recognize investors have concerns about the broad decline in equity markets globally, and the uncertainty and turbulence created by the global pandemic. In our industry this exogenous demand shock is exacerbated by an unanticipated supply surge, creating an abrupt imbalance and a sharp downturn in commodity prices. As chairman and lead director, we want to assure you that your Board of Directors is fully engaged, and the company is taking decisive actions in response to these dynamic market conditions.Your company is positioned to be resilient during these difficult times. Chevron entered this period of turbulence with a strong balance sheet, a low dividend break-even and a disciplined approach to managing capital and costs. We purposely built options into our plan to respond to unexpected conditions, and we’re activating these now.We are reducing our 2020 capital and exploratory spending guidance by 20 percent by deferring short cycle investments and pacing projects not yet under construction. To maintain balance sheet strength, we’ve suspended our share repurchase program and expect to complete assets sales signed last year. In addition, the company is taking action to deliver $1 billion in cost improvements by the end of 2020.These moves reflect our long-standing financial priorities and are focused on protecting the dividend, supporting the balance sheet, and prioritizing capital that drives long-term value for stockholders. Even in the face of the current headwinds, we intend to clearly demonstrate Chevron’s resilience to you, the stockholders whose investment supports everything we do.Sincerely, LOGO Michael K. WirthChairman and CEO"
need to raise prices at the pump by at least 1 dollar for things to balance out.

"All,You may have the same reaction as mine. This stock is oversold, too much sold. it bound up from low March. But, It was 88-95 per share for months. Now, the economy is opening. People are using cars and transportation. Price does not go up much. Why you trust BoA? Technically this stock should be around 110 to 120 per share."
Down -12% from the high.

Should open above $90 Monday!
"No worries. Fossil fuels are not going away anytime soon. It only make sense that with more fuel efficient cars and electric cars that oil stocks would go down. If your 64 or less and dependent on your exposure to oil stocks, I would ride this out. This is coming from someone in their 50's. You should always equate a 10 % correction each year."
Buy this below $84

Check news on SRNE and you make like it!
"I believe that Buffett taking a stake in CVX is a positive move for the CVX stockholders. However, before your start buying CVX at these levels, just remember folks, Buffett took a large position in XOM (Exxon) a few years back at a high price ($90ish). If you bought on that, ultimately you were left holding the bag when Buffet exited XOM at a lower price. Just saying."
gas price will erupt soon
"From Reuters: ""Chevron Corp, which operates Gulf Coast oil refineries in Texas and Mississippi, has continued to supply its U.S. East Coast customers.""They didn't say why CVX was able to do this."

Good thing I sold my shares for $105/sh a few months ago... I see further correction in the company and then I can get back in at close to $90/shI get my stock tips from: www.facebook.com/bullsresearch
Californian's upper middle class has to pay additional tens of thousands federal tax because state tax is no longer federal tax deductible. It's a double wham for Californians to pay owed last year's tax and this year's additional tax. I can see Californians driving less and buying less. Recession will start from California. Chevron needs to prepare. Good they saw it and pull out of the APC deal!
API REPORT RED?
I'm happy to be a Berkshire shareholder today 8% preferred is a sweet dividend. OXY will be nice a leveraged. When that property value drops in half then CVX can pick it up cheap.
Buy the dip!
"Yes, bad day for CVX. I am still confident that they will recover and sustain the great dividend. I will hold."
cxv to 180 and split
"I am short this stock - with oil below $20 and going lower - this stock is barely worth $50 on a good day. Anyone long here, has to be out of their minds. Oil is going to below $40 for a long, long, long time and If Biden and other liberals win around the world, oil companies will come under even more pressure...I will cover some in the low 50's and will cover the rest once the stock is in the $25-$30 area..."
1000%...some measures coming to bailout big oil
"Oil will go back up again, it always does. Funny how not so many years ago the liberal funded scientists were saying oil will run out in 50 years. They couldn't have been more wrong."
Should move out of socialist Calif. to save money
$CVX has been going sideways for months now. Might want to check out the excitement on $NIO - for some reason Yahoo blocked the conversation there just before they post July numbers. Fishy if you ask me. Looking forward to next week! Good luck to ALL!
Chevron stock should be 30% lower based on the thesis of this article...this is very real..https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/A-Third-Of-Fossil-Fuel-Assets-May-Soon-Be-Stranded.html
Went short several oils yesterday . Oil is so over
"CVX declared a quarterly dividend of one dollar and thirty-four cents ($1.34) per share, an increase of five cents ($0.05) per share or approximately 4 percent. The dividend is payable June 10, 2021, to all holders of common stock as shown on the transfer records of the Corporation at the close of business May 19, 2021."

"Just now, Chevron Phillips Chemical has begun operating a new ethane cracker at Texas. Besides, Finstead indicated that Chevron’s existing oil and gas development project pipeline is among the best in the industry – targeting volume growth of 4-7% in 2018 – driven by the big Australian LNG projects (Gorgon and Wheatstone), as well as deepwater developments in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and the Permian operations. In particular, with increasing amounts of capital spending devoted to the lucrative unconventional play over the coming years, production from the Permian region is expected to be strong. ( https://www.finstead.com/posts/CVX-buy-or-sell ) I think the $CVX stock price will raise in the coming months or years, do you think so? A BUY."
"despite what wirth says, no increase."

And in around a week they will give me a 5% dividend ...who could ask for more
"Thinkin there will be a correction in the next month1. Nationwide lockdowns are back in a big way and getting worse. This will suffocate demand and pummel balance sheets2. Leisure and Christmas travel are and will continue to be absolutely crushed. TSA checkpoint numbers look the same as July and if that wasn’t bad enough, we are entering the worst season of the year for airlines3. Stimulus deals are already priced into the market4. The oil run up happened before the new lockdowns which haven't been priced into their current levels. But they will beI’m not short on oil, just some observations"

Hey Oracle of Omaha. Tell me again how your CVX is holding up.

Air travel still only half of what it was last year.
I sold my chevron and bought XOM yesterday morning. The downgrade had not come in yet but I was just seeing lack luster performance. Worse than the other majors so I just switched.
I don't like the fact that CVX was a big contributor to DT but it isn't enough to get me to sell.
Damn this is SLOW MONEY
CVX reached a 52 Week low at 107.95
I am guessing this drop is because the CEO sold all of his shares so the market is expecting a bad earnings report at the end of the month....any other guesses?
"Oil stocks are slowing up from here but cruise, resort and air line stocks are still going, check CCL MGM DAL LUV UAL"
cvx at 180 split
"During the second quarter, the company’s average sales price per barrel of oil in the U.S. was $19, down from $52 a year earlier. During this quarter so far oil over $41 per barrel."
Share price is now $6 under valued...looking at crude oil increased production alone:Crude alone((400kbpd x 365 x 60/bbl x 9%) / 1.9 bshs) x 15 (PE) = $6 share price under value Doesn't include Natural Gas or LNG down the road.CVX just reduced logistics cost in the Permian big time since they were all around Anadarco.
"Texas's largest refinery closes due to cold. Drilling stops in several areas. 1 Million barrels a day lost. Cold grips the entire nation.Oil is going to explode higher over the next few months. Shorts ate toast! The covering will drive CVX / XOM / XLE and most others much, much higher."
Why?
"This APA looks ripe for the picking as they just reported a 69% decline in profits citing their results in the Permian were offset by assets both in crude and natural gas in other areas including the gulf, u.k., Egypt, etc. don’t know what percentage is in the Permian base where cvs is focused but this would be a good time to strike while they are down if any interest."
Hmmmm...I am not sure I like this purchase. Refining is the key to growth.
It takes years to recover.
Huge Oil refinery fire in Chevron's court can't be good for business. Hope people is safe. Indonesia might be having some high gas prices very soon.
Looks like Big Media is doing everything they can to take down the USA energy markets ? Remember these r the same ones who said DJT would lose by a landslide. Same ones who were behind pumping the Russian HOAX and fake dossier Be careful what u believe from these JOKERS
Stimulus package passed. Oil prices are up. Chevron will rise Monday and rest of week.
"EU considers continuing restricting American travelers per NY Times, decision will be finalized early next week. Jet fuel is roughly 20% of Chevron's revenues."
"Big dividend coming in a few days , 95+$?"

I think Buffett trimming on Apple and buying dividend stocks $VZ and $CVX might start a new rotation trend. Trim high-flying tech and move them to dividend stocks.
Good luck to us all. We need it.
Any news on the Opec + meeting? What were the agreements???
CVX hit the high $115 range twice and then rose. I wonder if that is the new bottom?
I have to say...as an ex-petroleum engineer....I love seeing the oil stocks fly and the “green” stocks get crushed. Just to shut up all the yuppies and millennials that don’t know squat or how things work. Love it. Absolutely love it.
"What to expect from next week ER, up or down?"
Oil stocks will be like financial stocks. Biden will push for transition from oil.

"Oil news...Until now, the market is behaving like an ostrich. By putting its head under the surface, and convincing itself that there is enough crude supply, or that ‘turning on the taps could rapidly add the missing barrels. The looming war in the Persian Gulf is only assessed on the merits of a US military invasion of Iran, which is unlikely to happen.If the Iranian regime realizes it is heading for the brink, its proxies will do its bidding. On the global oil market, volumes are no longer the only factor of importance. It is quality and crude grades. These two factors are not being recognized, and it seems that traders and analysts believe Trump’s version of reality at present. OPEC’s spare production capacity is not sufficient, as Iran and Venezuelan heavy crudes are in short supply.The U.S. is not able to substitute any of this in the short-to-mid-term. When the market hits the brick wall at the end of this year, this quality problem, in combination with increased instability in the Middle East, will not only create a nightmare scenario for consumers but could also push crude oil above the current $70-85 per barrel range. Proxy wars and sanctions could create the perfect storm for oil. A possible spike to $90 seems within reach."
You are an idiot if you are buying here...end of story.
"The buzz still around for much lower oil. Just be careful with CVX, had a great run. Time for it to go to hibrination."
CVX is down 8.97% to 75.94
FN Comical lol. I guess these wall st crooks are up there old tricks again!!
Most likely we hit $110 ?
Q1 OIL WAS $26....Q2 OIL IS AT $50 RANGE... Q2 EARNINGS????????????
CVX is one of the the few oil companies with a super strong balance sheet!
Buffett needs to buy the rest of cvx he doesn't own
I think within 12 months it will be up to at least $100
What’s the difference in chv and Cvx?
will go back to 124 at least after that free fall
22B lost from APC announcement plus 1 b break up let oxy have it if cvx increase another 22b will be lost so cost of buying 100b
"Im adding oil, silver miners and low PE small caps."
see you at 85.00...have my 1st buy in !
Is someone preventing posts for the stock what’s going on ? ￼
disappoint with CVX. I d rather invest with VLO
Bought in at 102. 50￼. thank you very much !￼
OIL IS NOW UP 3% CVX SHOULD BE FLYING UP.?
People you were given a gift at almost $90 to sell on this bear market rally. CVX will likely go down to 55 again with time. I would say the 50 test will come in late fall of 2020.
"In other news, the reddit crowed taking me for a fossil fueled ride to the moon . . ."
"I think CVX down today because OIL is down today. Summer driving demand will be up the roof, so CVX will benefit greatly from it. CVX will go much higher from this level."
Great brand EGO is
Oil to crash?
you can sell now or sell to me at 40 ... it is your choice.
CVX may be a compelling opportunity. google awesome-STOCKS - they offer pretty good trade alerrts. you dont have to trade their tickers but it definetly helps you recognize possible patterns for stocks you're trading.
"Negative $35/bbl. Each dollar move in oil is $1,000 dollar move if you own the commodity. so on last hour.....about a $45,000 move per contract. Say what?"
"it's a buy, I am raising my target to 170"
"So, Buffet, you Hillary loving gasbag, what was your CVX entry point?"
Big Sell!
"So Trump sends a tweet about saving the oil industry now? I guess he's going to save oil after he saves the coal and steel industry. Get in line oil Trump will save every industry and take no responsibility for anything. LOL, Okay !!!"
Buffet will dump tomorrow
I am just glad it’s basically over with so we can move on. Guess OXY will now be the major competition in the Permian after the deal
Congratulations to those shareholders who HELD CVX during the dark days. You'll now be rewarded.

LET HISTORY BE YOUR GUIDE AND BUY CVX NEVER LIES DOWN
The old saying.......when people run and sell on rash decisions.......I buy....buy....buyI'll wait another day or 2 but Chevron is a money machine. And when this coronavirus comes to an end everyone that held their ground and bought in will reap all the benefits. Good luck peeps.Just remember all those stocks that pay dividends means you are now buying the stock at a discount and it will go back up.
Chevron is up 12.52% to 80.06
Buffet sending $CVX into new yearly highs...all the BIG 10 oils along for the ride. 2 great days in a row..
Up up and away.
"Summer months coming which means oil inventory should drop (especially under the OPEC cuts), which may help balance demand and supply to drive oil prices back over $51-$55 and In effect energy stocks lagging the market. Buying opportunity on next leg down....does anyone think CVX will participate of continue to lie flat or go down....or is there a better play. I am not confident in CVX anymore to continue to hold or average down."
Don't understand why CVX is doing so poorly and don't tell me the price of crude is going down
q3 oil price 100% up. q2 was 21$ a barrel buy the dip
90ies look much nicer:-) Show no mercy with the shorts! CVX & XOM are rocking........... OPEC+ meeting tomorrow will boost oil and oil producers with a vengeance!

"great to see yet another dividend...a big one. Oil prices up huge and rising fast. Not easy to ""buy low, sell high"". When prices are low, there is usually a reason that puts off investors. And it helps to invest in a business you know something about. And of course you have to ignore 99% of the garbage posted on message boards, especially big companies. End of the world, market collapse, bubble, etc... They are all the same noise. Maybe Russians. Maybe a 12 year old in moms basement. Mute away. Yahoo really needs to clean that up though. And for those who say things like....It costs Chevron $40/bbl to produce oil.....No, it is not that simple. There are wells still producing from the 80's that I put in the ground. These have been paid for many years ago. Only cost is the ""lifting cost""...it can range from a few dollars to higher depending on many factors from the reservoir to the oil viscosity to location, cost of capital, etc.... etc... etc.... Only a simpleton would say something like it costs x dollars/bbl....for any oil company. Just follow the dividends. They tell the whole story."
Buy buy buy
Massive asset write down and more to come. Grossly overvalued company in an industry in a death spiral. All funds are dumping oil.
How much is the dividend currently?
whoever buy in today will not get dividend???
Is it too late to buy this?
Target price for CVX anyone? Thanks
When will this reach $100? I'm holding now worthless $100 Jan 15 calls since May.
how low will CVX drop?
"They can't make a profit because Oil price/barrel is too low. So Chevron and Exxon want to more than double their production of Permian Basin Oil to 1 Million barrels a day, for what ? To drive oil lower ?The reason Oil is so low is because they are producing too much, yet they somehow believe that producing more will lead to profit ? These Oil Barons need two lessons. One in supply/demand the other in Basic Math."
113.86 is next level down! keep your powder dry.
on sale now
Looking good now!
CVX will probably go to $123 today.
"Have owned XOM and CVX for long periods of time, both are flush with cash and have excellent balance sheets; CVX wins either way the APC deal goes. I'm keeping my eye on APA (Apache) which has been catching nice support and maybe under the radar as a company that gets a bid or just continues the slow & steady grind higher since the start of the year."
Buffet dumps GE because of Baker HUGHES acquisition and falling oil...hmmmmmmm
Chevron is up 4.92% to 72.92

Is Chevron an Incredible Momentum Stock? 3 Reasons Why CVX Will Be Tough to Beat
CVX is up 4.93% to $116.65
"I just sold off my $XOM and bought into $CVX based on Chevron's balance sheet stability and analyst rankings with 10-20% upside. If dividend's hold, XOM at 8% is nice but CVX is close at 5%."
If this is the best energy stock I'd hate to see the worse. This is down about 50% from the high. GARBAGE.

It looks like the commodity rally has finally hit silver. Up again today.
When oil was $61 ppb before the pandemic Noble energy was over $25 and CVX was over $121. Now oil almost $70 and demands improving it should move CVX significantly higher. Any thoughts on how much noble should potentially contribute to CVX share price?

"JP Morgan Quant Expert predicts Secular Bull Market in oil companies driven by algorithm initiated short squeeze in March 2021JPM quant trading and valuation experts Marko Kolanovic predicts the next 12 years will be the most profitable era for oil investors in the past 100 years due to inflation, the weakening US Dollar (caused by stimulus), a booming stimulus-driven recovery, and under-investment in oil production caused by environmental concerns.The fundamentals will be compounded by automatic trading by algorithm driven super-fast traders called Quants. The market will begin automatically rebalancing out of short positions in mid-March due to the recent rise in energy company stocks, oil prices and excess liquidity.The best picks to cash in on this cycle are $OXY, $XOM, $CVX, $ET, $ERX & $XLE. The following is an excerpt from his article. Quants and Momentum InvestingIn a market where algos and trend-followers have emerged as one of the dominant price-setting forces, it is hardly a surprise that the JPM quant focuses on their influence as the driver behind a commodity supercycle. Indeed, he writes that after ""CTAs played significant role in the 2014 oil price downturn"" more recently, ""CTA funds have been adding Energy exposure. The reason is that 12-month momentum turned positive on Oil, and going forward signals will remain solidly positive."" And since vol-control funds are some of the dumbest money around and their actions can be anticipated well in advance, JPM notes that ""a further decline in volatility will likely result in larger and more stable cross-asset quant allocations. A larger momentum impact may affect Energy equities, which is the only sector that still has a strongly negative momentum signal and is hence heavily shorted in the context of factor investing."" That, JPMorgan believes, will ""change in mid-March, when the momentum signal for energy equities turns positive"" which may be a hint to the redditors out there: if you want to squeeze the systematic shorts, do it where it hurts and buy some energy stocks to crush the CTAs. You have about a month to do so because JPM's model momentum factor ""will need to rebalance in March by closing ~20% of its allocation to Energy equity shorts, and adding ~2% to energy longs, for a ~22% net buying in Energy.""What is the quantitative significance of these flows? Kolanovic calculates that if one roughly assumes that there is about ~$1Tr in equity long-short quant funds and that half of these funds are not sector neutralized, ""the flows could be quite significant, roughly $20-$30bn."" As shown in the chart below, the ratio of energy shares shorted vs all other S&P 500 shares shorted, closely followed the commodity supercycle. Remarkably, most recently the number of shares shorted for energy was 4 times the S&P 500 average (note that given the decline of the sector’s weight, energy share prices declined, and the effective $ amount shorted was only 2 times larger). In other words, one doesn't even need to squeeze the shorts: come March - absent some major new crisis - as a result of broader market technicals the prevailing shorts will close them out on their own and go long.Another ""flow factor"" behind the ""supercycle"" is rotation by discretionary funds and retail: In the period from 2010 to 2015, the Energy sector had a 10.6% allocation in conventional equity portfolios. Since then, this has declined to a 3.1% weight currently (Figure 4). The largest decline was in active allocations, which declined from 7% to 1.5% (while passive allocations decreased from 3.6% to 1.8%), which is understandable - investors dumped ""dead stocks"" to chase growth and momentum, but the tide is now turning, and ""any retracement of this decline, on a US equity fund asset base of ~$14T would result in significant inflows and re-pricing."" According to Kolanovic, as economies reopen, inflation moves higher, and yield curves steepen, active funds are expected to first close cyclical shorts, and then rotate from long secular growth towards value and cyclicals. His next point is critical: given that equity assets significantly increased over the last 10 years, and the energy sector significantly decreased, even a small rotation could produce an outsized move."

Yahooooooo! Thank you CVX!
Hate to say it but CVX will trade back down to the 60's by year end. CVX has had it's divi run. You can only cook the books so long before truth is revealed. Truth is they don't have the $$ to pay the divi. Sell now and you will be happy by year end.

Chevron walk away from APC deal as management smell recession from the decreased gasoline sell and increased gasoline inventory. Recession will start from California as Californians need to save money for the increased Federal tax. The increased federal tax is because the high state tax is no longer tax deductible. I and millions of Californian need to save money for the owed tax due to lack of tax withhold last year and for the increased withhold this year.
Lower gas prices. Just had a Corona to celebrate.

Chevron to resume oil exports in July from inactive joint venture with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
Does this price increase today have anything to do with the well drilled by Chevron in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge?
nearing a buy point around 110-112. charts are showing a consolidation not a breakdown. should pop on earnings

"Is Chevron going to be getting into electrical generation in the future? I get the deals to produce wind and solar power on their own properties to run their own production facilities.

That?s obviously not enough says chevron screw the indigenous living in the rain forest of Ecuador look at our profits soar when we dump all these millions of gallons of waste oil, just tell the savages it?s good for them!

"Per Morningstar today...: The S&P 500 Energy index has already lost over 15% going into 2020, following the outbreak of the coronavirus and the likely knock-on effect on crude demand growth. The market has overreacted in our view, making energy stocks look cheap at current levels.In December, crude demand growth for 2020 was estimated at 1.25 million barrels per day (averaging forecasts from the EIA, IEA, and OPEC). That would have been a modest rebound from the prior year, but lower than the recent trend (demand growth averaged 1.6 mmbpd in 2016-18). Now, the same forecasters are calling for just 960,000 barrels per day growth in 2020, implying a 300 mbpd decrease due to the virus. But the full impact could be more severe. By comparing the recent outbreak with SARS (2003) Capital Economics has estimated a 400 mbpd impact, noting this is probably an underestimate because China’s economy is more globally integrated today. In addition, while the coronavirus appears to have a lower mortality rate than SARS, there have been far more infections and there is still the possibility of a full-blown pandemic. As such, it appears the likely effect on crude demand will be more substantial than what most forecasters are anticipating.However, there may be too much optimism on the supply side as well. Before the outbreak of the virus OPEC and its partners had already pledged to reduce output by 500 mbpd in the first quarter relative to the group’s previous ceiling. And while the latest figures do show a decrease of that magnitude in January, most of this came from Libya (where ongoing civil unrest is affecting production and transport). It is therefore much less likely that volumes will jump back up when the additional cuts are scheduled to expire on March 31. And it isn’t clear the group will let the cuts expire at all--the coronavirus could justify an extension, perhaps through the end of the year."
Well the old man has finally lost it
The truth must hurt

"Sell Exxon Stock Ahead of Earnings, Buy Chevron ConocoPhillips, Says Goldman -- Barrons.com10:18 AM ET 7/1/20 | Dow JonesRelated Quotes 12:44 PM ET 7/2/20Symbol Last % ChgCOP42.09 3.31%CVX89.17 1.76%XOM44.43 1.65%Real time quote. By Teresa RivasGoldman Sachs takes a look at the oil majors ahead of second-quarter earnings, and the firm's advice is simple: Buy Chevron and ConocoPhillips stock, and sell Exxon Mobil. Why? It all comes down to cash.Analyst Neil Mehta updated his estimates for Chevron (ticker: CVX), ConocoPhillips (COP), and Exxon (XOM) on Wednesday, ahead of the energy giants' coming earnings reports, and warns that the results will reflect a challenging quarter. Companies are dealing with weaker pricing margins, and while lower production and cost-cutting efforts can offset that pressure to an extent, there could still be some pain evident in the numbers.Yet perhaps the most important metric to watch is free cash flow -- or the minimization of free cash burn -- as this will be key to the companies' debt profiles. ""We expect ConocoPhillips and Chevron could see net debt broadly unchanged at quarter-end, thanks to capital discipline and boosted by asset sales closed during the second quarter, while Exxon could see large debt builds,"" Mehta writes.That fact informs part of his bullish calls on ConocoPhillips and Chevron. He reiterated Buy ratings on both (ConocoPhillips is also on his Conviction Buy List), with price targets of $56 and $112, respectively, and notes that both look well leveraged to an oil recovery, whenever that may be.As for Exxon, Mehta has a Sell rating on the stock and lowered his price target by $2 to $42. He sees the ""shares as expensive on valuation, relative to U.S. majors, as well as see free-cash-flow generation and dividend coverage as challenged,"" and even with their year-to-date decline, he's too concerned about the near-term risks to its recovery to recommend it to bargain hunters.It isn't hard to see why Mehta and others are focused on cash: Energy companies had been struggling with low commodity prices for years, well before the pandemic, and now the threat of dividend cuts amid capital crunches may be driving some of the longest-suffering investors away from the stocks. (Shareholders certainly aren't there for big gains -- Exxon stock today essentially trades where it did in early 2004.)Oil prices have been making some strides recently, but investing in theenergy sector has remained quite difficult. Yet while Exxon and ConocoPhillips are each off about 35% year to date, Chevron stock has only fallen 26%, helped in part by its strong balance sheet, although some warn that's not enough to compensate for the industry's woes.Write to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.com> Dow Jones Newswires"

........Xom vs CVX.....XOM up 3.30%.....CVX up1.40%......A clear winner.......
bought in CVX when it really dipped at $57. Been long and strong for years in my other account. CVX has been very good to me in my retirement accounts for years. Never thought I would ever see it that low again. This is one company that for sure can whether any storm the Comrads and Camel Jockies throw at us
I hope a barrel of oil shoots above $100 by Christmas. I need CVX to trade over 130 soon.
Chevron likely breathing a sigh of relief and starting to count the money!
This stock is becoming as predictable as junk mail.
Not a good looking chart of late here...
"Gradual and measured oil production increase is a good thing for keeping Brent under $70, which will prevent flooding the market with arbitrary shale production and keep it in a level very profitable to oil majors like CVX. Which will result in increase in dividend and buyback. Expect the Coming earrings should be very good."
Darrell muted!
dip day good for selling options put to get more premium and buy low price
"At the beginning of Nov. CVX was @ $70ish, then ran up into the $90's. It makes sense that there is some profit taking before the end of the year. Nothing wrong. If we get another market drop, I'll be increasing my position. The future looks good."

I am small investor. I have hels cvx for several year bought some when it hit 58.00 early this year. Wondering if any one can give me some insight into the company's investment in alternative energy and if they have put out information about how they are looking to the future. I have small investment in Hannon Armstrong a reit that specializes in solar. It has done very well this yearbut don't think solar is the only solution to a cleaner environment.

"Resources Investment funds and groups entering the U market!First. Remember, the total uranium sector market cap today is only +-17 billion USD. That's a very tiny sector!!To put this into in perspectif.The entire market cap of uranium sector (17 billion$) =- 2% of the market cap of Tesla $TSLA (810 billion$)- 40% of the market cap of Barrick Gold $GOLD (42 billion$)- 34% of the market cap of Newmont $NEM (50 billion$)- 8% of the market cap of Exxon Mobil $XOM (205 billion$)- 9,5% of the market cap of Chevron $CVX (180 billion$)- 14,5% of the market cap of Boeing $BA (117 billion$)In 2007 the total uranium sector market cap was 150 billion USD in USD of 2007.Add to this the inflation between 2007 and today, and you have a easy multi-bagger sector here!Second. It's a mathematic fact that the global uranium supply and demand needs a sustainable 60+$/lb U3O8 to get back in equilibrium in the long term.At 30$/lb U3O8 only 40% of global annual U3O8 demand can be met by uranium miners!!==> This is not an IF question, this is a WHEN question!Third. There are multi signals that the uranium sector fundamentals are getting the attention from professional resources investors now.Some signals:""Soon we'll be sending private letters to many natural resource investment funds and groups, globally. Our letters, to new groups who might not be aware of the uranium supply debacle, will outline the broken status of the uranium business and the key points for them to perform their own work to see if we reach similair or differing conclusions. We'll offer each group networking opportunities and ways that we believe they can most effectively participate in recapitalizing a broken mining sector and supply chain"" Andrew Weekly, CEO SmithWeekly ResearchLarry McDonald on uranium:""I am also looking for financial players to get more serious about throwing weight around in this sector. A group with decent capital at a multi-strat HF or a medium sized fund could allocate a few hunderd mill and create their own reality in this sector, IMO. The order of operations would be to buy up positions in call option like U miners, then buy the U trusts trading at discounts and then hit the spot market hard. I think you would make money on all legs of that if you committed a few hunderd mill to it""==> An other investor spending a lot of time in macro and micro due dilligence work on this sector like me, ""intercepted"" a strategic chats a few weeks ago between professional traders of different financial institutions talking about preparing themself to come in action in the uranium sector. And like Larry McDonald saying to first buy the uranium company stocks and related financial instruments, second buying the U trusts (Uranium Participation, Yellow Cake) and then buying Uranium in the spotmarket (Professional investors with 3000000 million USD (100000lb x 30$/lb) on hand can buy physical uranium --> the minimum buying is 100000lb U3O8!)In the meantime the uranium etf's need to buy more underlying uranium company stocks and issue additional etf shares to keep up with the demand from investors ==> That's a big upward pressure on all those underlying uranium companies in which those etf's invest today and in the coming months (and couple of years).For instance:- ""Investors were piling into 100% Pure-Play ""North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF"" $URNM on NYSE yesterday, adding another 175,000 ETF shares - Now at 1,325,000 & AUM US$60.3M, over 20X higher than its US$3M inception just over a year ago""- ""Global X Uranium/Nuclear ETF $URA on NYSE added another 300,000 shares yesterday to bring their issued to 17.1M with US$276M in Net Assets - A 160% increase from its March low""Conclusion: A lot of money is coming into a very tiny sector to invest into. Multi-bagger moves higer coming.Be prepared and be patient.Don't try to swing trade uranium stocks. If you do, you will miss the biggest part of the bull trend$DNN $NXE $UEC Fission Uranium Corp, Forsys Metals, UEX Corp, ...Energy Fuels, UR-energy, Cameco, Paladin Energy,...Cheers"

When oil oil hits the 30s this will go to 120.
Only the woke crowd likes electric and solar.
When does the stock split? $150ish? Any guesses?
Will oil prices go up anytime soon? Bought CVX based on their books.
so is CVX going to buy OXY or what? Those oxy shareholders need to be put out of their misery.
"STILL CRASHING WITH OIL UP AND MARKET UP, WHAT A PIECE OF...."
"It seems the down turn to $100 level is winning the race over the hopes to up tick to the $110 level. Summer demand, gas prices staying high (though oil barrel prices dropping) and finally earnings (maybe a positive surprise) is the only thing left to change the direction of CVX stock price. FRUSTRATING! CVX having both ends may benefit after some more short term pain while going down to $100, the plays with only production/exploration (like COP) will be hurt, need the distribution. I am very leary about continuing to average down, but under $100 may prove to be too tempting, any helpful comment please to help me decide."
Not going to happen. Feds would never allow it. Remember standard oil breakup.

IMO If CVX was not really interested in making a new offer I think they would have told it already. It looks more likely they will be making such offer soon which in turn should make their stock price drop a little more.
OXY buys APC then CVX buys OXY.
"Interesting news for the energy sector going forward.JP Morgan Quant Expert predicts Secular Bull Market in oil companies driven by algorithm initiated short squeeze in March 2021JPM quant trading and valuation experts Marko Kolanovic predicts the next 12 years will be the most profitable era for oil investors in the past 100 years due to inflation, the weakening US Dollar (caused by stimulus), a booming stimulus-driven recovery, and under-investment in oil production caused by environmental concerns.The fundamentals will be compounded by automatic trading by algorithm driven super-fast traders called Quants.The market will begin automatically rebalancing out of short positions in mid-March due to the recent rise in energy company stocks, oil prices and excess liquidity.The best picks to cash in on this cycle are $OXY, $XOM, $CVX, $ET, $ERX & $XLE.The following is an excerpt from his article.Quants and Momentum InvestingIn a market where algos and trend-followers have emerged as one of the dominant price-setting forces, it is hardly a surprise that the JPM quant focuses on their influence as the driver behind a commodity supercycle. Indeed, he writes that after ""CTAs played significant role in the 2014 oil price downturn"" more recently, ""CTA funds have been adding Energy exposure. The reason is that 12-month momentum turned positive on Oil, and going forward signals will remain solidly positive.""And since vol-control funds are some of the dumbest money around and their actions can be anticipated well in advance, JPM notes that ""a further decline in volatility will likely result in larger and more stable cross-asset quant allocations. A larger momentum impact may affect Energy equities, which is the only sector that still has a strongly negative momentum signal and is hence heavily shorted in the context of factor investing.""That, JPMorgan believes, will ""change in mid-March, when the momentum signal for energy equities turns positive"" which may be a hint to the redditors out there: if you want to squeeze the systematic shorts, do it where it hurts and buy some energy stocks to crush the CTAs. You have about a month to do so because JPM's model momentum factor ""will need to rebalance in March by closing ~20% of its allocation to Energy equity shorts, and adding ~2% to energy longs, for a ~22% net buying in Energy.""What is the quantitative significance of these flows? Kolanovic calculates that if one roughly assumes that there is about ~$1Tr in equity long-short quant funds and that half of these funds are not sector neutralized, ""the flows could be quite significant, roughly $20-$30bn."" As shown in the chart below, the ratio of energy shares shorted vs all other S&P 500 shares shorted, closely followed the commodity supercycle.Remarkably, most recently the number of shares shorted for energy was 4 times the S&P 500 average (note that given the decline of the sector’s weight, energy share prices declined, and the effective $ amount shorted was only 2 times larger). In other words, one doesn't even need to squeeze the shorts: come March - absent some major new crisis - as a result of broader market technicals the prevailing shorts will close them out on their own and go long.Another ""flow factor"" behind the ""supercycle"" is rotation by discretionary funds and retail: In the period from 2010 to 2015, the Energy sector had a 10.6% allocation in conventional equity portfolios. Since then, this has declined to a 3.1% weight currently (Figure 4). The largest decline was in active allocations, which declined from 7% to 1.5% (while passive allocations decreased from 3.6% to 1.8%), which is understandable - investors dumped ""dead stocks"" to chase growth and momentum, but the tide is now turning, and ""any retracement of this decline, on a US equity fund asset base of ~$14T would result in significant inflows and re-pricing.""According to Kolanovic, as economies reopen, inflation moves higher, and yield curves steepen, active funds are expected to first close cyclical shorts, and then rotate from long secular growth towards value and cyclicals. His next point is critical: given that equity assets significantly increased over the last 10 years, and the energy sector significantly decreased, even a small rotation could produce an outsized move."
"bought yesterday after seeing COP's report and sold today. with the OPEC meeting this weekend, not willing to take the chance and lose those profits. Will see direction on Monday and buy if price is right"

All these “woke” pension funds won’t invest in oil and gas. Until they wake up and find out the world turns on oil and gas.
DEAD MONEY
Summer driving season is over. Air travel still dismal. Oil prices going back to super contango. Game over.
As for now enjoy the dividend I will look  at what it is before posting actual %Thank you
"The end is near, after div or before?"
What a joke markets become . This went up $40 in a time when there business is down 90%. . What happened to fundamentals that drove the markets . We all speculating like things will be even better than before . I own a gas station and my business down 80% last week we recovered 5% but stilll down 75 is my business worth twice than it was a month ago because I am only down 75%.
"Last month when CVX was around $72 on a big upday, I said ""The uptrend is now confirmed. CVX is going up to $80, the next strong resistance. Good luck to all!"". Today, CVX reached $80 as I predicted. Congratulation to all who bought in at the low and those who stick with CVX through tough time. Breaking through $80 and remains above it will be a challenge, but beyond that, $100+ is possible given time."

"Conversations = nothing but SPAM.Yahoo, plz do something"
What are thought about if and when Market crashes will it take oil down briefly as well.
"Where did ed go? Ed, you got your wish. Did you buy back in early enough? I thought for sure Cvx would bump it’s bid at least a little."
Exit fossil fuel stocks like CVX and buy PLUG that is on its way to become biggest green energy company in US and globally... invest in clean and safe future for us and our kids and generations to follow... choice is in your hands...
"Personally I prefer ExxonMobil over Chevron as an investor, but I do own some Chevron in my portfolio holdings."
CVX on sale...Bought today at 119.21. Great div. too

Wake up frogs... reason it out.. start cleaning up the atmosphere cause without acting, your business model will surely tumble. These events are just starting and they will get worse. Over 400 ppm of CO2 in our atmosphere, and rapidly climbing... can't be good. Either we will all freeze to boiled to death, there is no in between... take your pick."

This #$%$ is destroying our planet and our very existence why invest in your own demise
Way overvalued right now. Pure speculation on recovery timeline with huge downside risk.
I learned my lesson last year. Avoiding oil stocks. Too volatile and no recovery. It takes years to get to 2019 levels.
I warned u 50 oil is overvalued $xom $xle $cvx so r the atocks

CVX not this low since about August of 2015. Take advantage of this gift. \
Possible downgrade coming.Low volume sell off at high price.Capitulation should happen around 65-70
CVX reached a 52 Week low at 77.23
Rank these in order you like $OXY $MPC $MRO $VLO $PSX $CVX $XOM

"I've been saying 103,50 for a couple of months"
"Excluding currently owning shares of UPRO (S&P 500 index), never directly owned Chevron stock, but am suddenly very tempted to buy a few shares after the 5% pullback. Excluding obvious fluctuations in energy prices, any opinions on other contributing factors that would cause downside stock price risk? Lastly, what do you see as the near-term rock bottom stock price? TIA"
Buy as much CVX as you can before market opens today.......HUGE DAY
Oil is a dying industry..just like coal. Chevron has a good balance sheet but as time goes by oil goes bye.bye.April 1st the Saudis will FLOOD the market with oil. April will be the worst month in the history of oil into the teens. CVX might be a buy in the 30s.
"Why does CVX need to buy anyone? It's stock price is doing extremely well. If a buydoes happen, I hope they pick the bones of a distressed company without anybig premium nonsense."
Should I go back snd look for the posts telling me to sell?????
Buy DK or $OXY or $CVX or $XOM or other oil prices as trend moves from tech to oil. Vaccines will take time but transition is happening with tech starting to crash.
Chevron is down 6.99% to 77.23
"Time to load up, I love it when tariff news scares off weak hands."

Why down today? Makes no sense unless they're already jockeying for option exp.
Shorts you will lose on bad days and good days. No matter what.
Love this dividend
Nice after market bounce. More green next week
GO WITH THE WINNERS CVX A LONG TERM WINNER MUCH LIKE XPM
Greenlang is good for lefties
This stock is horrible it's worth $50 its a bubble stock. Might as well sell at the top now so you don't panic sell at the bottom.
Cvx has become the house of pain. Self inflicted wound. Down $10 straight since they announced the APC deal. I hope Mgmt does not give APC a penny above the agreed amount. We are large enough that this pain was not needed. Questionable move by an otherwise decent mgmt team. Bad move for shareholders.
"Realistically, EV and other alternative energy methods are decades away from making a dent in big oil companies. Once the pandemic is over, big oil is back and all you on tree huggers are going to be sorry you are ""woke."""

Possible merger still might be likely this stock could rocket tomorrow
QEP will be on fire tomorrow
Good time to get out today if you have a profit. I don't think we can hold these levels. Great stock but I just think it will get cheaper.
"CVX climbing up with low volume, but rise is Fragile?"
Shorting oil stocks is like taking candy from a kid. That's why I don't short - because I don't take candy from kids.

Natural Gas....Developing countries can’t afford the electric transition. They will first grow their economies on “old” tech - fossil fuels. Oil isn’t dead. It’s a sleeping giant. Get in now."
Just let it go! Let OXY take a 8% mortgage.
cvx TE should be raised to at least 160?
BLOWOUT 1.45 Vs .88 cents est. If this was AMZN it would be up 100.00 points . THIS IS A BLOWOUT including revenues
C0nsider the following 0il -$100 whch was just forecast on financial tv when reached will the time CVX becomes technically insolvent maybe it will be a buy then but now? who can tell where this all bottoms?

103...104....retest for sure now
is it a good idea to sell before before earngs ? I cant imagine that they will beat.
I like cheap oil and energy prices...But the reopening is still happening oil will hold above 60 which was pre-covid which seems CVX will be in the 120 range. A bad week isnt a trend
CVX still down 12%. I own PSX and looking at XOM. They have recovered a lot. I really wonder these price disparities are one or two big institutions unwinding.
economy sucks if OIL 70- or 80 cayuses issues - manipulated reports - Huge inflation is everywhere - but all coll for fed i guess

BUY CVX
Up up and away!!!
Yahoo will not let me post a link but there is a great story in Bloomberg about how the Saudis just discounted oil at the highest level in over 40 years.......and took any production limits off. There is going to be a huge oil war and many companies will be hurt
Any body know about Saudi's oil fields under attack by drones.
Get ready for a big move next two weeks. Iran sanctions being imposed!!! Oil is over $70 first time since 2014!

This stock goes nowhere.

All of the major oil firms are free cash flow negative after dividends. $XOM $CVX $BP $TOT
Watching for rally here
Nice dividend raise to $1.12. This stock will be $150+ by years end.
Remember in October last year this stock was under $70 and all the posts about the green deal coming with the Dems and oil is dead? Up over 50% since those end of the world for oil predictions.
"I can tell you this. And it’s not just for CVX. Oil companies are due for a major pop real soon. HFC, XOM, COP. Stay tuned. Invest wisely. Good luck"
The
"*ALERT**CHEVRON depends on OIL much more than natural GAS this is why it is going to get hurt much more by electric vehicles movement away from Gasoline !""So, I believe the fundamentals in natural gas are superior to those in crude oil. Which of the Big Two is “gassier?” In the U.S. it's no contest as Chevron’s production mix in the first quarter was 75% liquids to 25% dry gas and Exxon’s gas/oil mix was very close to 50/50. When we include international region, however XOM’s gas/oil mix drops to 44/56 and CVX’s increases to 33/66.So, Exxon has a greater exposure to natural gas, and is thus better positioned in the current environment. Obviously if one wanted pure natural gas exposure, one could buy stocks in companies that have a much higher proportion of gas as a percentage of total production, like Range Resources and Chesapeake. When you invest in Big Oil, though, you are really investing in Big Dividends.""https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2017/04/28/strong-earnings-from-exxon-and-chevron-driven-by-big-gas-not-big-oil/#77c5db811ac1"

cut dividend please
This in one of the finest well managed companies in the W0RLDIts scary to think that there is something that can take it downAll I want is for oil to make a bottomBut the guy on financial tv that said there is no bottom for oil is looking less wrong
look for 86.16...if it breaks 81.00
DID EIA FOUND ALTERNATIVE TO crude oil?...lol
The march to 80 began yesterday. GLTA except shorts and day traders.
This company is not worth over $15 pps
Natural gas down over 6%. Chevron is still leasing space from the SPR for oil. Glutton everywhere.
wow. bounced hard off that 102.32 price. the past few days have shown some good support around 103.to 103.5This is a solid bottom unless some crazy political thing happens or covid shuts the EU down. And yes: the EU is a mess.
heading to 130 after earnings
.......I thought CVX was up more than XOM..today ........But it was only a smug on my screen...no XOM is up a bit more but CVX is holding its own today...
Anybody have a handle on dividends going forward will they stay as they are or change as Shell oil did. ￼
I have worked for Chevron for 38 years and recently retired. CVX has amazing projects in the queue and two large MCP's coming on production in 2018. With oil prices in the high 50's sit back as we will see $137 in 2018. Enjoy the 3.5% dividend while you wait!
Part of today's move down s/b due to ex-dividend.
"pre market up, going back to the 120"
Thank you to all the hacks using either ALL CAPS or some stupid name. Makes muting all of you so much easier. Thanks again and we wish you the best in all your future endeavors.

"Short data: March18 ,2021Today, Short sellers employed all of their tools in order to bring oil stocks and future contracts down.After failing to create a sell off in oil stocks ,they started to shorting April and May contacts for future oil.They brought WTI to 59$ from 64$.Biggest single drop since April2020.As you see in below data, compare to share price drop, the volume was extremely low.This volume does not match with share price drop.That was just a pure and irresponsible manipulation.Most media in the World censored this extraordinary event in capital market.We are talking about tens of Billions of $ contracts and options which they are trying to kill them, plus covering their short position with creating fake sell off(scaring shareholders).So far, we haven’t had sell off.Low volume.They prefer spent and burn few billion dollars and sell stocks at discount, but meanwhile save tens of billions of money in other side.Extreme and irresponsible manipulation which will have consequences in future of oil market ,especially in next OPEC+ meeting and their next policy.Explanation about below data:Vol: The total volume numbers of first hand shares which is coming into market for trading.It is different than total volume that you see in yahoo or elsewhere.Because in total volume one share can change many hands between traders.But original amount of coming shares and shorted shares are constant for day.For Canadian Stocks the volume is just for US market.SU : (Vol 2.326M shares), (Short 0.769M shares ), (33% of coming shares for trade)SU : XOM (Vol 12M ), (Short 5.715M ), (48% )CLR (Vol 1.129M ), (Short 0.703M ), (63% )CVX (Vol 3.363M ), (Short 1.784M ), (53% )OXY (Vol 8.277M ), (Short 5.32M ), (64% )CPG (Vol 0.693M ), (Short 0.314M ), (45% )CNQ (Vol 0.664M ), (Short 0.217M ), (33% )ENB (Vol 0.885M ), (Short 0.57M ), (64% )BP (Vol 3.458M ), (Short 1.265M ), (37% )CVE (Vol 1.543M ), (Short 0.978M ), (64% )CDEV (Vol 7.627M ), (Short 4.025M ), (53% )FANG (Vol 1.087M ), (Short 0.505M ), (47% )CPE (Vol 1.615M ), (Short 0.697M ), (43% )MRO (Vol 10.09M ), (Short 5.662M ), (56% )SLB (Vol 4.484M ), (Short 1.632M ), (36% )HAL (Vol 2.948M ), (Short 0.971M ), (33% )RIG (Vol 12.58M ), (Short 7.285M ), (58% )TOT (Vol 0.553M ), (Short 0.378M ), (68% )PXD (Vol 0.859M ), (Short 0.51M ), (60% )COP (Vol 2.865M ), (Short 0.808M ), (28% )BKR (Vol 1.79M ), (Short 0.659M ), (37% )LPI (Vol 0.417M ), (Short 0.181M ), (44% )PDS (Vol 0.054M ), (Short 0.02M ), (38% )#XOM, #CLR , #CVX , #OXY , #CPG , #CNQ , #ENB , #BP , #CVE , #CDEV , #FANG , #CPE, #MRO , #SLB, #HAL, #RIG , #TOT, #PXD , #COP, #BKR , #LPI , #PDS"

$CVX Downgrades Goldman Sachs Neutral USD 117 » USD 113
Added to my positions with today.CVX is building to be the next XOM.Helluva money making opportunity.
A lot of crude supply out there .... and cheap. And demand is down.
That old Buzzard Buffet is pushing CVX up!
"I am more bullish on CVX than XOM due to the fact that unlike XOM CVX is still free cash flow positive and cash flow per share covers the dividend per share. XOM is having to borrow money, therefore take on debt, to keep paying their dividend. Long term that isn't sustainable. I think CVX will have a good year due to economic reopening and am planning to sell out of my XOM to rotate more into CVX. The dividend is just safer for CVX right now. I have my doubts that the continued surge in oil prices will be enough to restore XOM's cash flows to what they used to be."
"Right now oil drives the world. That may change in the future, but no time soon at these prices. I remember when the world was going to run out of IP addresses back in the late 90's/early 2000's. then NAT became the standard and we haven't moved completely off IPv4 to IPv6..This could be that defining moment that delays renewable energy"

$CVX $XOM $XLE Always interesting to read news on covid covid-19 covid covid covid then find one site reporting reality. https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/having-difficulty-finding-gas-in-las-vegas-youre-not-alone-2333469/
"So let met get this: oil companies are going to cut investments in future projects and borrow billions of dollars and sacrificing the balance sheet and future profitability just to maintain an unsustainable dividend? Call me a layman but this sounds like a terrible idea. Dividends are supposed to reflect the company's income, not its ability to borrow."
"That was weird. I saw down (18.00) premarket, then it went away. Anybody? Maybe it's my breakfast blend kicking in, if you know what I mean."
"Shell Surprises With Strong Profit, Dividend Hike"
I believe firmly this is not worth over $40
Anyone know when the next dividend is coming and how it will be
"As a shareholder I am not sure I am happy about this acquisition. Seems like buying a buggy hip manufacturer in 1950. Also, they clearly paid way too much for it. Still I trust this executive team to create future value so I am willing to see where this goes."
Is CVX starting to roll over here? Both CVX and XOM have similar charts....are we consolidating for the next move higher or is this it for a bit? With oil coming off $60 and the 10 year on fire I would think the downside is the more probable play here...but the algos will take this whereevers they wish.

"This has a long way to go to retest last month's panic low of $57.00. With physical oil trading as low as $15.00, you know they're not making any money today! How soon will the stock price reflect reality?"
"Releasing more crude oil from the SPR makes no sense because it is the refineries that were adversely affected by hurricane/tropical storm Harvey. This release will go to a handful of refineries not located anywhere near Houston. These refineries are already dealing with an abundant supply of crude oil. The majority of refined products, such as gasoline, that go to the east coast come from the refineries near Houston. I live in Houston, and the gas prices are up by a good 25 to 35 cents a gallon in most places, and this is literally right next door to where the gasoline is made. I don't quite know why CVX is up so much recently, unless it is based on expectations of increased downstream (refining) profits. Crude oil prices have been stuck in the $45 to $49 range for a very long time and there is an oversupply of LNG production. Maybe investors are happy that John Watson got fired (retiring early) and new top leadership will correct all of his strategic spending errors and miscalculations."
expect OIL to $100!
At this rate CVX should hit 150 by June.
Cvx should countersue NYC and NY state for malicious harassment and prosecutorial misconduct over the unanimous rejection of their environmental claim against energy producers.

"These activist investors calling for lower emissions are the devil incarnate. Meanwhile, they love private jets, plastic, and hot showers."

"EOG all day long, best buy no need for anything else"
Best thing for Chevron is to buy Phillips 66 and increase cash flow and revenue. Takes Chevron from a $268 to a $328 billion company that is more vertically integrated. They take over the joint venture chemical business. Capitalize on the midstream business and gives them the opportunity to sell any of the refinery segments that don’t align. The share price will move up for all stakeholders. Best time to do this is when interest rates are low and oil prices are on the rise. This will be better than buying shares back or increasing dividend for shareholders. All about generating value for the shareholders.
Nice haircut today lol cheap gas too! I will get a full tank please!!! Cheap oil will murder EV vehicles!

CVX currently at 86.10 premarket this morning. We will end the day at 87.50. By end of week CVX will be trading at 92/share. I know this with 100% certainty
Oil going to15 or lower oil deal a joke doesn’t even come close to the demand destruction. For the record I am a small producer and wish oil was 100 barrel but the reality is we are in for a really long and bad time in the oil patch. Want to own cvx but not at this price.
Why are they not buying up smaller gas companies to limit competition and grow. Going to flatline soon.

You cannot run the US economy on solar and wind. This will be realized by the market when demand suddenly exceeds the supply. Exploration investment is way down and there will be a huge surge in pent up demand once a vaccine is available.
"CVX, TSLA and BA are over sold??"
Looks like Warren is going to buy an oil company!!!!!!
I keep reading articles on how oil demand has peaked in the world and consumption will go way down in the coming decades. I don't believe it for a second. Electric cars are not going to kill the oil business. The people in poorer countries can't afford a electric car at 50K or more. Once the virus is over with oil demand will continue to go up I'm long on oil stocks and getting rich off the dividends. Good luck to all.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Monday renewed a license allowing Chevron, the last U.S. operating energy company in Venezuela, to continue drilling in the country for another three months through Jan. 22.The license has been a subject of intense debate within the Trump administration as it pursues a campaign to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro. Its renewal represented a win by some in the administration, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who see keeping a U.S. company in Venezuela as an asset that could lead to a speedy recovery after any ouster of Maduro.Other Trump administration officials believe allowing Chevron to stay results in oil output that helps keep Maduro in power by allowing him to pay down debts. Several administration officials favor allowing the license to expire even after Trump’s hawkish former national security adviser John Bolton, who had been an opponent of the license, stepped down last month.Chevron executives “remain focused on our base business operations and supporting the more than 8,800 people who work with us and their families,” said spokesman Ray Fohr. The company is reviewing terms of the latest license.The renewal effectively adds no new restrictions, according to a review of past licenses.Chevron (CVX.N) has been in Venezuela for nearly 100 years and has about 300 direct employees there. Its joint ventures with state oil company PDVSA support about 8,800 people. The ventures produce the equivalent of about 200,000 barrels per day of oil, and Chevron’s stake in them recently averaged about 34,000 bpd, the company said.In January, the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA in an effort to oust Maduro. But it issued Chevron a six-month license to operate, which has now been renewed for two three-month periods.Crude oil output in the OPEC nation has dropped from well over 2 million bpd in 2014 to just over 1 million bpd by the end of 2018, the result of lower prices and what critics say is years of underinvestment and mismanagement. Blackouts and U.S. sanctions have accelerated the collapse: The country now produces just 600,000 bpd."

There is no explaining the price action with this one. I know it was oversold but geesh!
Chevron reached a 52 Week low at 77.23
"So Buffet gets 8% for use of his money. If they Occ had taken some time, their bond debt would be below 4%. So they pay 10 dollars more per share, double the cost for use of money and pay 1 billion to Chevron. If they had the means to quadruple production, it would take 5 years to cover the exaggerated expense. Now if electric cars keep doubling, how log will it take to get a quality price on oil? They screwed their shareholders plain and simple."

"All oil producers should yield to the climate change propaganda to gradually wind down the oil production. The natural field decline will drive the oil price upward 100+. IF an oil producer want to increase reserve, he can acquire via merger. Additionally don't ever invest profit in oil field development or green technology. Instead return the profit to share holders as special dividends. Oil will have 12-15 years boom according to Goldman Sachs as oil investment in the pas few years too little. With my suggested no more investment in the future, the boom could be even bigger than Goldman Sachs. After that, the share holders can sit on pile of money and watch green advocates to save the recked economy caused by their own propaganda."

"I sold CVX back when it was at 121. I started buying back at $106. IMO, the nearly 5% dividend will stop it from sinking too much lower. Good luck to all."
could we see $100 this week
Is Exxon better financial condition for the growth
why is it tanking?
Div cuts coming oil has topped alternative fuelsLike from $gevoWill replace Jet fuel and gas $xom $cvx $cvx get out with immense gains while u can
Awesome dividend plus awesome stock!Bought around $90 and added more around $100!Can't complain here!
"we still need drive cars after covid is ended this year, so buy and will happy at the end of this year."
Crude and CVX in freefall. Not even and earnings beat can save it. Still hold out hope that this will all be behind us mid next year.
"these oil plays look attractiveMDR, SLCA, BOOM, PTEN"
wow this is worse than expected a lot of pain losing 40% off your money in a week
"$45 per share, April 1"
will close around $112
CVX reached a 52 Week low at 64.78
.........I congratulate everybody great job but like I said XOM gives you more shares for the money and higher dividends and the SP will increase more because it’s closer to its 52-week. You better balance sheet looks good but not needed here XOM isn’t going anywhere. It’s almost double the percentage higher for an example.CVX is still and always will be a great stock.....BUT In these times......XOM Wins......
"Crude Oil Prices Rebound Due to a Draw in US Gasoline InventoriesBy Gordon Kristopher | Aug 4, 2016 1:26 pm EDTCrude oil prices September WTI (West Texas Intermediate) crude oil futures contracts rose by 3.3% and closed at $40.83 per barrel on August 3, 2016. Brent crude oil futures also rose by 3.1% and closed at $43.1 per barrel.Prices rose due to an unexpected draw in US gasoline inventories. ETFs like the United States Oil ETF (USO) and the ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil ETF (UCO) rose by 3.9% and 7.4%, respectively, on the same day."
"across the board correction, algo driven. hold for divies, will return to highs in 3-6months, while divies buy more shares at reduced price."
ALL the oil companies still paying dividends are borrowing the pay the dividend. Not sustainable.
Chevron is down 8.97% to 75.94
"Oil is a Organic product made by the earth. Natural Gas is a Organic product from the earth. If you like to have your electric working... these are ways we all get to turn on our lights in the night. Mine Bitcoin anddrive electric cars. You can't call this product a Fossil...you can go dig up bones...those are Fossils! They arenot going to break down into oil, gas or coal! A fossil can't do what oil, gas and coal can! Parents teach yourown kids. They are not learning in school."
"oil stock plummeting big time in the next few months.short attack, 50% discount to come..."
Thank you for the discount. I added more at 98 ish
Wow talk about profit taking. You would think with the Dow soaring and oil up this would trump profit taking. WRONG and I'm upset about it.
CVX and ANTM no brainers today
All OXY is doing here is making APC stock rise superficially and damaging the existing CVX bid.
Any of you out there jumping back and forth between BP and CVX? Seems like another good time right now. Just thinking out loud. With now trading commissions anymore...what the hay
"OXY only dropped .58% today. Apparently, the market likes them over CVX. The market is rarely correct. Just look at the 20% drop in the stock market in Dec. because of the crazy fears of a recession."
I am surprised too that Chevron is up today
CVX is up 4.90% to 80.00
"Collapse. Market doesn't like the earnings, doesn't like the deal, doesn't like anything."
"HYSR, check it out"
Oil gonna spike on russia iran tension!!! Bullish $xom $cvx
"My concern is pride in their increasing dividends is getting in the way of building shareholder value. Asset sales at depressed prices to prop up dividend in short term maybe, but with continued low to moderate oil prices, this strategy is not sustainable. We all know this stock has the most upside potential of integrated oils with strong prices (along with Total), but we don't have and don't expect this scenario in near future. Lets swallow our pride, and reduce the dividend until the market stabilizes."
"CVX wanted APC because CVX has contiguous property in Permian with obvious synergy but then there are headache loses in Gulf & skyrocket cost of APC NG facility in Mozambique... (The last 2 headaches were reason APC knew its stock would crater on earnings & why it needed CVX with expertise far afield from Permian shale.) But going over $72 a share for some shale & headache losses?? Other shale firms focused in TX without divergent headaches & losses are available for a fraction IF CVX wished divergence in hot shale US market. On Chesapeake Energy Board (CHK) which is hot, hot in Eagle Ford Basin with more and more proven acreage & better & better income since acquiring WRD in EF. And I see many on CHK Forum would love to see CVX diversify to Eagle Ford & profits into30 forward years. Note: Enterprise Value to buy entire CHK firm is 19 billion (divided by 1.62 billion shares is $11.62 per share) A firm poised for great shale acquisition for run into far future at less tha $12 a share versus falling value & headache for more than $70 a share.... Just Say'n"
xom up a buck COP up a buck CVX up $2
"I like the split idea. Then at $66 I could buy more at an easier rate. I used to have four times as much CVX, but had to pay for a daughter's college and make a commercial real estate investment.CVX has been in the family since at least 1929!With 1.9B shares listed as outstanding a 2:1 split would be Ok. GE has 8.67B shares, BAC has 10.43B even KHC has 1.22B."
sold on news today. Got out before results
Chevron reached a 52 Week low at 72.11
"First of all.....they will walk away from the Darko deal, and pocket the 1B bucks because its the smart play....they look for something else to buy....how about EOG??? Just for starters.Oxy/Vicki are dopes....Warren fleeced Vicki.....stay away and look elsewhere."
CVX will be OK in the short run with oil around $43.00 a barrel. Divy should be maintained.
My dividends on Monday will buy more shares.
Warren Buffet has spoken. He is King. Now green energy fools take a seat and stifle urselves.
big scam
#ShowUsTheReport
$100 is likely where CVX is headed. Just way too much supply and production now.
70.00 next level I have my buy in !
NEXT BUY SET 97.89
LOW 90TIES NOW !
CVX is at 20 year lows.....thank god they didn't get anadarko or it would be in the 20's
this stock will end today in the red- more short term pain- but definitely a buying opportunity for a blue chip.
Lockdown is very bullish for chevron.

Things will smooth out when Trump is gone.
"Chevron $CVX and Exxon $XOM are the hottest investments ever. They are soaring the way that all you NIO fanboys were hoping NIO would. Too bad you did not buy the RED HOT energy stocks, Chevron and EXXon. Chevron is up 30% since announcement of reopening the economy and my target is $150.Chevron will thrive during the shutdown and is a real beneficiary from Corona and low oil prices."
eph you cvx.....absolute garbage....

Its all tech. everything else is virtually dead.
Tesla will kill cvx
"Most analysts belief CVX is going to counter. First of all the have a $2.50 Per share advantage over OXY because of the break up fee. As a result, an offer for $73.50 from CVX is the same as OXY offering $76. I will copy and paste the different view from analysts below."

No wonder Chevron is down today. Anadarko needs to buy debt to keep their company going. Also they've lost money 3 of the last 4 years. The profit they made last year was 1/10 of the loss they had 3 years ago. Chevron shareholders are now becoming owners of the shale pyramid scheme. Good luck with that.https://www.gurufocus.com/term/Long-Term%20Debt/APC/Long-Term%252BDebt/Anadarko+Petroleum+Corp

Chevron is up 4.91% to 99.02
Finally a good day lol
So $CVX is up 67% from the low but oil is at $22 and change. Makes sense to me and should run to all time highs if oil falls under $20. (Long Puts)
Next buy is at 68.75
"Isn't it amazing how many of those posts below, which are written and posted by a computer all over the internet...saying almost the same thing....just keep saying the same thing...always negative.

Like you its just an auto delete."
....I get it... Chevron has a better balance sheet than Exxon.… But Exxon is not going anywhere and still pays almost 11% dividend. Since the share price is closest to its 52-week low of $30 you get more bang for your buck BUYing XOM.Please tell me why I’m wrong?

Solar and windmills driven by liberal brain farts just won't get it done....so keep buying oil stocks because in a few months this will be $90 to $110 it's a cycle. I do fantasize about the first battery jumbo jet test flight full of ""believers"" this I want a front row seat for."
Chevron (cvx) You are killing our environment and neighborhoods by selling this toxic fossil fuel.

"Hello back in June 2020 I had spoken to a person who is a retired Chevron employee, he told me that it would be down no lower than $74 and from around there it will go up gradually and by May 2021 it will reach a peak of no less than $114. I dontvthink it's smart to doubt him twice so I'm in on this."
Noone chats on these boards or shares thoughts on prices ? Right now I see oil getting to high and chevron is low in comparison. Oil at 60 should make most oil companies very good profits
Wow I was looking at this as a bargain at $80. Glad I passed.

"No point trying to mute all the idiots who post all the negative garbage about either the end of the world, end of fossil fuels, or end of the market and capitalism. I guess they are stuck in an underground shelter in New Zealand with nothing to do. Demand from Jets is going to be down indeed for awhile as they won't be flying as much and they are the biggest users of crude oil...refined down to jet fuel. Trucking using diesel is up, and with airlines down, they predict people taking vacation this summer will be driving....which uses a lot more fuel per person per mile than a jet full of 200+ people. I am driving down to visit my niece for her graduation instead of flying so as not having to deal with all the BS. Plus I can carry stuff with me like her present. Anyway, future of crude and natural gas....looking very bright. Future of coal? Not so much. It is used for two things. Thermal coal for producing electricity and Met. coal for input into steel making. Crude oil is not used in this country for producing either one. Electricity is moving to more renewables...which is good...but that will cut into the big 3, Nuclear, Coal, and Nat. Gas. Will not affect crude oil. 73% of crude oil is used in transportation. Jets, ships, trucks, trains, cars."
a good day for me ...

"And when the S&P is down at 1600, will CVX still be so bullish."
What the heck is happening here at the close. Its crazy.
This will end like 2015 im 3 month you read nothing about a dividend cut but about the tiger flexing his muscle.
"JoeBiden will destroy this country. He will end up in prison, there’s no question. Trump will sue everyone involved.( rightfully so ) and the Russian/Ukraine hoax that we went through for 3-1/2 years plus will seem like a child’s play compares to what’s coming. If Trumps character has you with TDS you are making a huge mistake. Say goodbye to your investments. anyway! But it will get very ugly very quick."
"CVX !!!!You see, this powerful buy ""signal"" is so rare that it's happened less than two dozen times.But when it does happen - it's made investors undoubtedly rich.The ""signal"" I'm talking about is when both David and Tom Gardner, celebrated Motley Fool co-founders and stock pickers, recommend the same exact stock, each for their different and respective U.S. newsletters.They recently did just that…And, believe it or not, the average return of those picks has been an astonishing 215%.Even more unbelievable is that those picks, on average, have demolished the market by 152%.Because when David and Tom agree on a stock, this is what it looks like:Tesla: average return of 596%Copart: average return of 121%Google: average return of 176%Under Armour: average return of 365%Facebook: average return of 251%"

"It's time for the company to move corporate out of insane California. As a long time shareholder, I ask the board consider moving corporate headquarters to Midland Texas. I estimate cost savings to be $100M over ten years --all of which should be returned to the shareholders by an annual special dividend. Thank you for your consideration."
the next financial meltdown will be in oil and gas..all companies have lousy debt ridden balance sheets...
In May of 2020 Buffet buys 48.5 million shares of CVX at that time it was trading around 85-90 dollars. Last week he sold half of his stake in CVX while trading somewhere around 110-112 dollars. 24 million x 20 dollar profit per share........That is just locking in profits. I trade like this all the time just not at that scale! I also sold 1600 shares last week at 111.19 of 3200 shares I bought back in Nov last year for 68.98. That doesn't mean I bearish on CVX.
Going down down down! Poor management does it again!
What a fitting testimony to the value destroying idiot management and board to sell at the basement. I smell a whole ship full of parachuting rats
from the call it sounds like they have a clear vision 5 year out with the dividend a top priority. the only wildcard remains the virus itself.
Soon there will be a full investigation of the Covid Lockdown HOAX and crimes against humanity but it will probably be down by the citizens an attorneys . Propaganda used against the citizens
DIVIDEND IS GOING AWAY...
The ship got freed is the word not sure if its true but will probably cause some short term selling pressure
So much for the APC bid. Thanks for the breakup fee. There are other fish out there.
Goldman Sachs is forecasting the largest jump in oil demand on record as the world opens up again amid the Covid-19 vaccination rollout.
"I don’t get it. I just read that “EQT to Buy Chevron Appalachian Shale Assets for $735 Million”. I know Chevron is losing money on this asset but it is selling it at a depressed price. I thought the big oil should be buying instead of selling. When the economy recovers, oil consumption and prices should go back up. Those who got assets cheap should be able to make a killing. Chevron is financially strong enough to ride this COVID-19. Interest rate is low now and if Chevron needs cash, it could borrow cheap. So, why this sale?"
"Impressive that Moody's just reaffirmed Chevron's credit rating at Aa2 yesterday. They downgraded Exxon's to Aa1 which is one notch higher but they did say that Chevron has the strongest credit metrics of its major oil company peer group (which made me wonder why Exxon still has a better rating). Moody's still thinks that while metrics will obviously be weakening short term that they feel Chevron can fully restore its metrics in an eventual recovery. To be honest, I'm surprised they are this bullish."
ALL that money and you cant hire American and pay wages like you use to large corporations are crooks
Good Love! Long CVX!!
Going under 100
OPEC thumbs their noses at Trump and oil charges ahead.
You can thank Trump for saying he thinks Putin and the Saudias will make a deal shortly...whatever that means. Time to exit stage left and wait on sidelines?

for this is the end hold your breath and count to tenon the other hand war could break out somewhere in the worldand the price of oil could soar past 60IF the powers that be want the price of oil to go up IT WILL RISE
overdone. choose your horses well!
where are all the know it alls who said the cvx div has to be cut?
Trades 95-105 imo. For what its wirth.
At this price I might as well dump and buy BPMP for the dividend.

a six pack of carona beer will soon cost more than filling up your tank
lol this stock should right now be a new 52 week low! they indeed cannot make any profit at these prices.
"CVX should definitely let OCC have ANK, and take the 1B breakup fee.....besides in the permian, I heard they just struck ""sprinkles"", not oil......I heard they were drilling for oil and first hit ""soft serve"" and later sprinkles.....I saw it on TV.CVX is an excellent well run company and oil prices are on the rise."
I'm Bullish on the sector. Prefer ExxonMobil over Chevron for a variety of factors. Still Bullish. I also Strongly recommend AT&T.....We are a Diversified Hedge Fund that contracts as consulting services for Goldman Sachs and even smaller companies.
"The oil glut is so bad that one hurricane in the gulf made the POTUS release 1,000,000 barrels of oil from our contry's strategic reserves and 500,000 barrels of gasoline from reserves. The glut is so bad that all measured stockpiles have been dropping for the last year while production has been going up. If you believe the glut BS, you need to read facts, not news. Money will flow back to oilers, it's only a question of when!"
51.50 pt
What is CVX break even price on a barrel of oil? TIA
Oil up -going higher.
When travel restrictions lifted the oil stocks can fly again. 2 more weeks guys so be patient!!!
Pretty quiet in here today
oil going up way to fast ... I was surprised it was up this morning not so surprised it lost it this afternoon
Over sold.
"People base their assessment of oil companies on one thing - fuel production. What they forget about is oil & gas is used to produce agricultural fertilizer and other agrochemicals, synthetic cloth, plastics, lubricants, medicine (benzene used as a precursor), metal alloys (petroleum coke), power production, asphalt roads, and about 25% of the construction materials used in homes and buildings. Even if you eliminate petroleum products as a fuel, most of our economy would collapse and people would starve without everything else created by manipulating carbon and hydrogen atoms in gas and oil."
"Buffet giveth, and Buffet taketh away. When Buffet sells ur stock, U will be very depressed. U will crawl up in to a little ball and die."
Will we still keep our dividend
How much lower oil will go? Time to buy?
It dumbfounds me how manipulative and gullible people are. You guys deserve each other :)

oil giving way to Tesla little more every quarter. they should start making batteries
Third time at this price level in recent months. Will likely go back down to $80 soon.
Only way to save the oil business is for the oil companies to stop flooding the market with unwanted oil. If nobody wants a car you stop building cars simple no brainer
buying more today going long
Oil is up 3% https://www.cnbc.com/pre-markets/
Looks whats coming for ICE cars -This is a huge disrupter and puts a question mark as to the future of the EV market
oil already up bigtime
OXY's Vicki is stupid...over paid for the company and overpaid for financing.....take the 1B and walk away....buy EOG or FANG...both with Permian exposure....or buy both.
would there be a dividend cut on CVX like all others even the bank???
"This is why I keep telling the morons on here that companies don’t trade based on crude price. Oil is up big but CVX is down. The other it was reverse, CVX up while oil down. Always think long term guys, in the long run, you’ll be happy you held on to this gem"
Drop in Oil this morning is laughable with Iran sanctions ramping up next week.
MARPS will move very soon. this oil company is under accumulating by big boys. put in your watchlist
Going up in a hurry!

Who gets tired first ...DOW Short or OIL Short?
Also we have printed 6T so far and the crisis is just getting going. We still have not seen the millions of bankrupts that are surely coming or states needing trillions or pensions needing trillions...and then there is the emerging market Argh.

Hopefully you were smart to sell this dead cat bounce. Opportunity to get out of oil.
Has the IRS pursued Hunter for tax evasion yet? They sure as hell aren’t showing up for work processing any tensing paper returns!
"Chevron rises today. BP, Exxon and She'll didn't. I'm curious why? It looks like this company got a greater balance sheet."
Crude up and oils down? Biden realization is beginning to bite on oils and the market in general. Socialist redistributions to take many forms including climate change #$%$ where so called poor get energy rebates!
Downgrades today from buy to hold from Tudor. Who the heck is that lol. These analyst will do Anything to get in in cheaper.

cvx should buy OXY!
Looks like CVX is about to roll over. Oil related stock headed lower. Guess the estimates were way too high and the money has been made in the secror. If we get to $115 I may add more.
When is the dividend increase announcement?
irrational selling last year followed by irrational buying this year.
**ALERT**Oil turned red again today !SECONDS AGO !
This will rock BIG OIL !!Huge ramfications for the PETRODOLLAR and BIG OIL!
Hmm..This blip must be a Buffett effect since I own like 12 oil stocks and they are still up. Which means this move is not based on facts just emotion.
"OXY lost by winning. Just look at the trajectory of CVX and OXY stock price. I won't be surprised if OXY is being sold at fire sale price in 2020, with CVX the acquirer at $65 per share."
"Oil price at $51.47, up from the recent $47 level. Inventories down, and OPEC confirms to keep production cuts for 9 more months. CVX sit and goes nowhere in a ridiculous range at and around ....106. Time to give up on this dog."
So GM just announced they will go all electric by 2035. Just curious how will XOM and CVX reinvent themselves in 14 years to maintain profit?
"So if Sleepy Joe falls into oblivion as seems to be the case and the Green New Deal suffocates to death as it should, and the economy reopens, seems like Chevron that has remained in the DJ Ind. avg will prosper. Nice div too!"

"After watching the Joe and Jill Bristol, PA rally that drew crickets, flies, and a few car horn honkers, I have to think Big Oil will loosen the purse strings and back the Donald for the next two weeks and see what happens. Big Oil is getting off cheap on this election. Adding to CVX position. $75.27"

I bought lots of CVX calls this morning....about 400c
"Speculation: What was the 2 Million Shares right at end-of-day Friday, with a 1 point increase?And, does it portend anything for Monday Open?"
"3 months ago and when C V X reported Q4 earnings the stock went from 111.89 to115.41 in 4 days and kept going up 9% to 127 until we announced the takeover bid of APC, now we are back to 3 months ago and looking ahead tomorrow’s Q1 earnings, let’s up the stock would bounce back a few points and with the decision of walking out of the bidding war, we can see a few more points gains to the share."

Good time to buy $CVX and XOM - with government help they may post big earnings on friday morning 
ITS A DAYLIGHT ROBBERY AND CHEATING GOING ON AT CVX...
The cards have been dealt. Oil doesn't look good at this point but there might be one more bluff in the old gal. Sold all my CVX today as I don't want to roll the dice any longer. This is the final blow for me.
nice gain
Pretty soon the short covering is going to start. Way oversold
Ok..hear we are...stomach feel queazy ......yep...good test of when to start thinking about buying
"Made $140,000 today. The Saudi meeting this week formed a schedule to raise oil barrels to $80 by April. Now is the time to invest."
Long term CVX calls is the way to go. Just like the rest of these viruses the world will reopen and it's going to be epic! $115 by Memorial Dy 2021.
good day buy below 110 it is a steal
Ceo announced at earnings dividend likely raised if Brent stays around $55. What happens if Brent stays around 65?
APA is the largest land owner in the Permean and according to reports it one of the largest reserves in the world...now that Chevron got beat out on Andarko you would think that they would go after Apache.
Will touch $74 this week
Dems to shake down individual taxpayers by bringing an army of Naz auditors to bear! Socialist thieves won’t enforce vague and poorly written tax laws enacted by members of Congress that vote for but never read or understand them much let alone a but of gov min wage flunkie auditors.

CVX Price to earnings ratio is 67 about 4 times higher than historical averages !This stock could drop in half to 55 and still be overpriced !Oil prices are collapsing and the revenues and earnings of this company must also fall big making the stock even more expensive...This bubble market is going to end in tears soon imo...
The stock market is a SHAM. Its all about tech. It will all tumble down.
I have CVX in my short portfolio and I can't look at it because I know it would crush me.
"Well, oil is destined to fall like rock soon... The post pandemic market is fake. This plague will be felt for decades. to come.Oil Price Target: $-35 again next year, short term, $45 WTI"
CVX reached a 52 Week low at 90.39
"Trade oil stocks, don't invest."
Back to the $90 level
TRUMP BUMP!! KAGA
Going to $135
The next two weeks are going to be a huge step for gas companies and CVX as well! this a great time to jump on in the 70-73 area because we won't stay in that area for long 80$-90$ its not a wild guess for next week
The stock market is a full scam at this point.
Wow this is great news reading Chevron wants to acquire SWN!!! Not surprised!! SWN just coming off great ER!! Huge assets worth $$$ Billions!!!! I would think a share of SWN would shoot up and be worth $12/$15!!!! BUY SWN!!
The world is going to solar and wind. Yeah right.
this current price is just stupid
"Look at it this way. The new infrastructure plan that’s being pushed in Washington D.C worth trillions of dollars, is going to pay hundreds of billions fueling up the machines and vehicles it will need for the next 10 years. And what a great way to protect against inflation."
How long until June futures go negative? some of these companies I would think better lock in while positive if not hedged..

"Sorry to hijack this thread, but YAHOO has shut down all discussions on their news site.

oil is a mess cheaper than water for quite a while.
"cvx down for no reason, psx up over past 2 weeks, ceo refuses to answer question about joint venture, psx has a p e of 8.6 world class assets, always beating estimates...........does c v x make a play?"
Why is oil going down when the goofball experts say it will go up?
What’s Exxon dividend???
"The left is going to kill oil. I have a bad feeling about this. I keep wanting to buy a couple positions, but can't get myself to do it."
"down 5%? To quote our favorite muslim congresswoman, ""Somebody did something!'"""
Dividend tomorrow. Hope the prices stay low tomorrow.
Berberg Raises Price Target $CVX $130 HOLD maintained.... that looks like a buy rating more than a hold rating that is almost 15% higher from where it trades. 2 analysts Raised price targets $2-$4 and it is down today... look forward to seeing a bounce good luck all! Oil prices are high.. wish they were lower gas is getting pricey with all the taxes the DEMS in my state put on it... unreal!
Still time to exit CVX and buy PLUG...Shift is happening in front of us to Green energy and PLUG is the king.
How did you cheat a president out of 4 more years when his vaccine is causing oil to soar? You must hate yourself more than you hate America.

Question: Is it still true that Chevron has no exposure to Middle East supply? That it's entire supply is outside of the middle east?

I say we buy CVX when they cut their dividend
CVX isn't #$%$ well. That was not a good earning report. Will bring down the entire oil industry given that they're suppose to be best in class. I think I'll just sit on my oil ETF and I'm glad I sold all my CVX in the 90s. Maybe pick it back up in the 70s!
FLU cases down 95 percent - YES these IDIOTS really think we're that stupid
$40 oil in August is bad news
The Green NEw Deal SHAM along with the COVID lockd down HOAX sham is about stealing the energy wealth of the USA and transferring to China is that not right JC
recession starts from California April-June quarter!
To those of you who are short CVX: You can stop predicting that the dividend will be cut or eliminated - it’s not going to happen.
Chevrons ridiculous Price to earnings ratio of 69 times earnings makes it especially vulnerable to a big selloff as is occuring in GE and XOM right now...

Bidum and the rising economy will continue drive oil prices higher. Mr. Dummy doesnt realize if you drill less and demand increases prices will rise.
Anyone who thinks anything the USA does will affect the climate one iota is not very smart.

OPEC better cut.
"Due to x-dividend drop, all the limit sells (programmed) got cleaned and collected, should bounce back above $92 this week (hope so)!"
No matter what this going $108.50 -$109 range !MMS REVIEW
I told you chevron is smart by backing off the APC deal. She smells the recession as gasoline consumption decline and inventory build up abruptly. The cause- state tax is no longer federal tax deductible. If you pay attention to the new reports in the early tax season this year- lots of people are shocked by the amounts of owed tax because of lack of withhold last year. News show pictures of women nearly cry because of the owed tax.
Is NPLX the better play for long term distributions?
meanwhile in socialist state of cali CBS still 4 bucks per gallon. what will cvx will do to get the price up again. watch they will burn one of their refinery again.
"If investors thought Trump was going to win Chevron would be flying higher, well maybe not flying but..."
Why is this stock down right now?? Oil is up and they beat earnings...

Now on Goldman’s conviction buy list.. target price 144... great ceo. With a financial disciplined approach.
This company is a total POS
The cost of batteries has to come down a lot - maybe in another 15 years. Till then fossil fuels needed for growth.
Summer months are the best months for oil stocks guys and we are betting on facts!
Oil glut everywhere.
How can this possibly be up today?
I'm so disappointed at not getting in at 113 from a week ago!

This is why we need an up tick rule.......the avg investor can't compete with machines....just finding the bid down

Under $100.00 by months end! Count on it
"Narrow minded people think that oil is used only on cars. Oil is in production for many industries including commercial, industrial,manufacturing, residential, etc. Its called black gold for a reason its value and importance is critical to countries worldwide. CVX is a winner. go long and longer."
Hydrogen will be huge for Chevron
I’m not sure MBS is eager to help this administration with cheaper oil after the Kashoggi accusation. 10s bond spikes are a warning on frothy valuations. Equities trading at 2x Price to Sales. I’m sure Cathy Woods portfolio is +3x. $XOM $CVX $OXY $PBR ~1x. Bringing valuations at more reasonable levels is behind GS and JPM “rotation to commodities” thesis.

How rude the crude dropped like a rock falling to the center of the globe today.
"Bears and bulls make money. Hogs get slaughtered. I locked in the recent dividend and sold at $82.22 with a cost basis of $79.96. Xom could go to 93 in a couple of weeks...or it could go back to 73. Only time will tell if this is the time to buy, sell, or hold."
$65 oil will give chevron $20billion annual profit.
Hello. I bought 460 shares of cvx at 83.20 per share. Do you think I will ever make my money back?
"Thank you all who commented on my son in law. The family is doing well now. Most people are kind and respectful. I truly appreciate that and all of your kindness.I never expected that my post would ignite such purely rude comments from some people. I can only imagine that these people are just people who are unhappy in their own lives. If you are troubled, I pray that you get help. There is someone who needs you and cares about you. Every human life makes a difference and every mistake can be fixed. It’s never worth taking a bunch of pills. Please reach out.For those who said he was irresponsible, I don’t disagree but understand that he knows the oil and gas industry. One day he and every other Bondholder were the same and the next day the institutions were put ahead of him. It’s just not right, fair and should be illegal. These were bonds and they we’re supposed to be safe.For those who say he’s making the same mistake by investing in $XOM $CVX & $OXY, I couldn’t disagree more. In the next 10-15 years, oil and gas will be $80-$150 based on the supply models he makes because of reduced supply. The big guys will make a ton of money and will buy out the green energy companies. This next 10-15 years will be the last hurrah for oil but he’s going to get his money back.Thank you all for your kindness and best of luck I all this craziness."
How do these posts get 40 likes and dislikes within 30 minutes of the post appearing? Spam? Yahoo needs to do a better job of cleaning up these message boards.
They are worth 130 at least. rock sold dividend oil 45 next month.

"Love cvx, enug said"
Really Yahoo? Ex-Divident Date? Have you ever heard of spell check?
Oil going to 100 with Iran sanctions.
how many watched cramer act a fool with Wirth today?
123 after earnings
Do people really believe the Saudis and Russia will make some type of deal with America?
It's oil. I mean I kinda feel strange even addressing the doomsayers. It's a bit like dealing with flat earthers. Anything under $100 is a buy. Get it as cheap as you can...get your DRIP running...and move on with your life.
Oh well. Congrats to those who took profits in the 130s
"One of my best purchases from the big dipper, nice gains, short timeframe and worth much more if you believe we will pull out of this corrupt lockdown."

"CVX is another high yield dividend trading below it's lowest price target. High price target is $164 for the buy ratings and the lowest for HOLD is $120 up to $130, about 10% off plus a 4% dividend makes this an interesting play at current prices. Hold the stock 10 years and get about $50 in dividend plus any upside."

XOM knows how to make money for its shareholders. The California Teachers Pension Fund doesn't seem to care about that. They are siding with that puek green Engine Hedge Fund that is trying to worm there way into XOM in order to change the direction of the company. If that happens there won't be any XOM dividends going into the Pensions funds coffers to pay those teachers when they retire.
"Cramer changed his mind as far as cvx being his best oil play, now its pioneer"
"If after making a bid for APC and shares dropping from 126 to 118, it’s crystal clear this is a bad deal and the market confirmed it. The smart decision will be let OXY takes APC and we collect the $1B and we can scoop both companies 6 months down the road cheaper."
"Trump is a disaster. He threw ya'll under the bus, you're just too dumb to realize it. LOL"
Is Chevron eyeing Noble? way too cheap here
Oil goes up and oil goes down..Oil is not going away. COVID is only a very small % of the pop..like 0.0004
"This conversation below about the future all going the way of electric is almost comical if it wasn't sad. I thought AOC was the only one who thinks electricity comes from behind the wall. The future of electricity is Natural Gas, not windmills and solar. When one of these loons get into office and bans fracking, we will see just how stupid they are! Wait until these Teslas get old enough for the owners to start replacing the batteries. That is like replacing the propellers on a windmill. Electricity does not come from vapor."
Watch the shares shoot up Monday.
"Don't know where the bottom here is...the global economy is slowing, but CVX has the ability to weather this storm, so might be worth the investment for the dividend play at this point. Worst that happens is CVX stops its stock buyback program. It always raises its Dividend. Still, I would wait to see where this bottoms out."
$99.00 coming!!
Crude at $11 and chevron and other gas companies stock not dropping ? soon the curse hot $1 or free worthless where with chevron be? something not right about the system we have. why crude drops and not others like chevron ? hahah
"I'm reposting Jim's post from the SU conversation. It is extremely interesting to understanding the price movement in oil yesterday:$SU conversationShort data: March18 ,2021Today, Short sellers employed all of their tools in order to bring oil stocks and future contracts down.After failing to create a sell off in oil stocks ,they started to shorting April and May contacts for future oil.They brought WTI to 59$ from 64$.Biggest single drop since April2020.As you see in below data, compare to share price drop, the volume was extremely low.This volume does not match with share price drop.That was just a pure and irresponsible manipulation.Most media in the World censored this extraordinary event in capital market.We are talking about tens of Billions of $ contracts and options which they are trying to kill them, plus covering their short position with creating fake sell off(scaring shareholders).So far, we haven’t had sell off.Low volume.They prefer spent and burn few billion dollars and sell stocks at discount, but meanwhile save tens of billions of money in other side.Extreme and irresponsible manipulation which will have consequences in future of oil market ,especially in next OPEC+ meeting and their next policy.Explanation about below data:Vol: The total volume numbers of first hand shares which is coming into market for trading.It is different than total volume that you see in yahoo or elsewhere.Because in total volume one share can change many hands between traders.But original amount of coming shares and shorted shares are constant for day.For Canadian Stocks the volume is just for US market.SU : (Vol 2.326M shares), (Short 0.769M shares ), (33% of coming shares for trade)SU :XOM (Vol 12M ), (Short 5.715M ), (48% )CLR (Vol 1.129M ), (Short 0.703M ), (63% )CVX (Vol 3.363M ), (Short 1.784M ), (53% )OXY (Vol 8.277M ), (Short 5.32M ), (64% )CPG (Vol 0.693M ), (Short 0.314M ), (45% )CNQ (Vol 0.664M ), (Short 0.217M ), (33% )ENB (Vol 0.885M ), (Short 0.57M ), (64% )BP (Vol 3.458M ), (Short 1.265M ), (37% )CVE (Vol 1.543M ), (Short 0.978M ), (64% )CDEV (Vol 7.627M ), (Short 4.025M ), (53% )FANG (Vol 1.087M ), (Short 0.505M ), (47% )CPE (Vol 1.615M ), (Short 0.697M ), (43% )MRO (Vol 10.09M ), (Short 5.662M ), (56% )SLB (Vol 4.484M ), (Short 1.632M ), (36% )HAL (Vol 2.948M ), (Short 0.971M ), (33% )RIG (Vol 12.58M ), (Short 7.285M ), (58% )TOT (Vol 0.553M ), (Short 0.378M ), (68% )PXD (Vol 0.859M ), (Short 0.51M ), (60% )COP (Vol 2.865M ), (Short 0.808M ), (28% )BKR (Vol 1.79M ), (Short 0.659M ), (37% )LPI (Vol 0.417M ), (Short 0.181M ), (44% )PDS (Vol 0.054M ), (Short 0.02M ), (38% )#XOM, #CLR , #CVX , #OXY , #CPG , #CNQ , #ENB , #BP , #CVE , #CDEV , #FANG , #CPE, #MRO , #SLB, #HAL, #RIG , #TOT, #PXD , #COP, #BKR , #LPI , #PDS"
eph you cvk ceo.....ephing garbage idiot.....
if the dems take ga senate seats this will tank!
Waiting for about a 50% dividend to get in more... it is about 5% now... $1.29 per quarter... 10 years is almost half the stock value and that is if the dividend don't go up again. Hydrogen charging stations just around the corner. Down $20 from it's high of $127... dividend boosted and beat on the bottom line showing it has room to be creating some strong earnings. $139 PT on it yesterday... the price is a joke right now buybacks will retire more shares and dividends. Should be trading $120's again plus dividends...
"billions of dollars from sale of tech and media on friday will be going into oil stocks this coming week. Buy cvx, xom and bp."
"Down again, is oil price that low?"
Crack high markets finally turning down
"SnP closed above bear terriotory, the trump speach along with coordinated FED buying led to the late rally, markets have had some very ""suprising late rally's these last couple of weeks. Why buy on a friday, when you have 2 days for the situation to get worse. Now that America will be doing more testing I expect the cases to go higher. In 2 weeks we should know if the severity of the disease is dissipating. The number of critical cases as a percentage of all cases has been going down in europe, I'd say that's a postive sign for now. As cases grow in america it could lead to county shutdowns which i suspect will happen and should produce another selloff on stocks and oil. The bottom is not in yet. Keep calm and wait for the opportunity don't buy the dividend stocks, because dividends will be slashed with lower profits, revenue, sales this year."
Summer traveling season hasn't started yet nor the European air travel or Cruises. Oil Consumption with go much higher soon.
"CVX may up offer , CVX/APC much better than OXY/APC , easier for cost savings and growth but I do believe it will one more and done . Just depends on cost savings per year and only mgt knows break even point. Do not know what else CVX would be looking at , there are other smaller companies but many of their fields have been drilled out and many are not in the HOT areas of the Permian Basin"
Oil up big today CVX Down! Anybody have any thoughts on why?
This should be up there twice the price of NVDA they actually have assets and produce
Sure is a ton of spam on this board today. Spam spam spam
9.4% dividend. Says it all.
CVX reached a 52 Week low at 68.99
Once china signs long term lng contracts this stock will explode. They want to reduce their air pollution and reduce their huge trade deficits with us. I also own chk and swn and they are starting to fly. Cvx is a great stock and a keeper!
"Ya right Motley fools?? We know your game plan??Forget Shell, Chevron Is a Better Dividend StockShell has increased its dividend twice in the past year, but it just doesn't stack up to Chevron as a dividend stock.CVX trading at forward P/E over 16....Shell @ 9 with sales of $180B vs $96B for Chevron ???Oh by the way...Chevron paid dividend with borrowed money & asset sale...and Buffet selling...so??and...in the news !!!Daimler Truck, Shell sign agreement on hydrogen trucking in EuropeShell in talks with Nigeria to divest onshore oil stakesShell exits Philippine gas field in $460 mln deal"
any idea when CVX will start buying up some other companies and/or assets as we start moving back over $100 going into ER on Friday 5/1?
This going to $100 and will range trade between $100-$104 again like it did during the crisis. Need to give up my long term hold and begin to range trade this stock to make up for higher priced buy points.
I have not seen Chevron in New York State. they should open one
My 500 shares at $ 72 are looking pretty good right now.
bought more @ 106.90
76.38 is next level down. Charts don't lie only brokers and traders. A sleepy Joe win will send it even lower! So watch out below.
no matter what the analysts say now is the time to invest in oil the worst news for the oil sector is over now this will be the bottom oil stocks should move up from here we just passed the worst quarter ever in oil all reports ran all dirty laundry is out so look for an upward trend

"Held up nicely, very proud of this buy at $60"
New trading range seems to be $70-$78
$CVX Chevron to the moon! Oil is the hottest investment right now. Oil is the future. Not electric vehicle.
A price of $150 coming for CVX this year!!!
Shorties just can't win!!!!
CVX reached a new 52 Week High at 127.47

"WLL, will save a lot of money with Dakota Pipeline..."

Why is chevron up ah
"Hey Deniel, are you the only person post here, besides the spammers? Most of your posts are not any better than the spammers."
Nothing wrong with taking small profit if you're that kind of investor. But longer term (vaccine by the late spring) and dividend CXV still way under value stock!
Crude Oil at 45.18. Yes sir!!
I just saw chevron buy noble....they have liquidity on books a long time ago...nothing to do with pumping money into this stock...will say no matter if your green our not have to have oil
"Does anyone have insight on how much of Chevron's revenue and profitability is tied to fracking in U.S.? If the extreme left-wingers take over White House and Senate, fracking will likely be regulated out of business raising oil prices and hurting the poor and middle class. Given the TRILLIONS of dollars being printed right now, and the radical socialists taking control of the Democratic party and media, it seems like the oil companies with the least amount of fracking could benefit tremendously if the U.S. dollar collapses and high inflation raises it's ugly head. Anyone on this message board know which major international oil companies have the most exposure to fracking?"
Oil crashed might bring this down to $100 ...?
CVX or XOM?
Where’s all the CVX holders that like to disparage XOM. Hahaha
SHELL ANNOUNCED WORST ANNUAL FINANCIAL RESULTS IN THE PAST 20 YEARS. OXY CANNOT PAY INTEREST ON ITS 39 BILLION DEBT ALREADY. WHEN OXY ANNOUNCES FINANCIAL RESULTS IT WILL CRASH 50% IN ONE DAY. OXY WILL ANNOUNCE ANNUAL RESULTS SHORTLY
"since cvx is among those corporations that do pay a high tax rate they will see a windfall in earnings due to tax cut. Recent gains on tax windfall of other stocks suggest cvx should see further gains soon, right?"
Buffet was wrong about Gold selling barrick Gold. He is also wrong about Chevron and oil.
Barrel of oil is now $13.10??? How will CVX make money?
WHAT CVX WILL DO WITH $1 BILLION THAT FELL FROM THE SKY
What a day...I'm gonna fill up my tank with Chevron premium this afternoon.
"Employment at CVX, BP, XOM will be wiped out due to new admins pursuit of Green Energy dream"

"chevron with Texaco did many atrocities in the world. specially in the ecuadorian amazon forest... cancer, death, fauna and flora destruction,.....don't buy a company just for profits. investors need to hold social responsable companies by not supporting them. #theworstoilrelateddisaster"
CVX needs to give back to shareholders first. If there is any money left they can buy a refinery.
Dow futures down 625. Pickin up more. CVX will be the only one that will be even or up today.
eph you ceo of Chevron......punk
I don’t know WB bought this. Over priced compared to the sector.
Old news but Chevron also has a $25 billion share buyback program they can use at anytime buying a few billion worth of shares here and there cutting down on how much dividend needs to be spread around...
"WENT, SHORT. THEY CAN'T MAKE MONEY. COST THEM $42 A BARREL TO PULL OIL AND IT'S SELLING FOR $22. SO THIS IS AN OIL COMPANY THAT NOT ONLY ISN'T SELLING OIL, WHEN THEY ARE, THEY ARE LOSING MONEY. NEXT STOP $62"
Fear for no reason at all. Zero deads in the US.
Now there is no forward crude contracts that have a value over $35 bbl until 2022. What does that mean for Chevron? Lets just hope they got their price per bbl under $15.
Oil will see below $10 pretty soon.
Chevron was down on the original announcement because they were overpaying. So is it down now because they won't get the deal or because they are going to have to overpay even more to make it happen?
Looks like an up day coming; should reach $122.
"The Saudi price war will be short lived - quite simply because the Middle East economy - so much of which is controlled by the price of oil - cannot continue to grow at $30 a barrel. Their budgets and their growth plans are based on $50. The Saudis are sending a warning to the Russians, but will capitulate soon. Monday will be a terrible day for oil stocks - but for those not faint of heart, a great buying opportunity."
Bizarre activity!
Stock is not going up even though crude prices have been going up.
I guess me and Warren will be buying shares tomorrow.
Impossible this breaks 87 before earnings. Should be trading in the 70s tops
sad story
Why is GE tanking ?Because they are all in to the oil business ?

Wash your hands, stay 6 feet from each other, do not sell. I will need to enforce this mandatory hold beginning tomorrow for those that cannot follow directions."
"Over, Buffett closes the deal."
Watched Chevron CEO on Squack this morning. Seemed a very intelligent man and declared stress test have proven the dividend safe at 30/barrel for an extended period. Reassuring.
Got 100 shares during this dip. Hoping it will rise after the holiday.

Now that the 737 jets are going on line and the Asian economies are opened. there seems to be a new glut on oil which will be the driving forces for $50.00 oil per barrel plus .

Im not a stock chaser I like this stock for the dividend. Even though they say we are going green you cant run the current world without oil

I’m looking at fidelity and it says cvx’s dividend payout ratio is 335.06% is that correct? If soIt’s a real eye opener very weak #
"Guys, I think sticking to the Wall Street shorts is the right thing to do. For too long this has been a manipulated market. I am definitely concerned that some of you will be left with nothing.Do the trade, but don’t get emotionally attached to a trade. Get out and take your profits and invest them into actual companies with assets who pay dividends.Think $GE $XOM $CVX $HD $GEL $ET there’s a ton of very good companies out there. Don’t get too attached to options and being over leveraged. GROWTH IS NOT A VIABLE BUSINESS PLAN WITHOUT PROFITS AND CASH FLOW. Please remember this - get into good companies with profitable well run businesses."

"The fact that oil keeps bouncing, despite Libya output, despite lockdowns in Europe, despite an endless supply of negative financial press, tells me that under the surface, we are starting to see the effects of supply destruction as a result of low investment in exploration.

How the oil stocks close today could be a signal for what happens on Monday in my opinion......

Dear Chevron management: As a long time shareholder I strongly urge you to move out of California. The state is officially run by a Soviet style communist dictator. You have a fiduciary duty to protect shareholder interest and maximize profits. This cannot be achieved in California. Move to Texas in 2021. Thank you.

CVX wil get crushed tomorrow.
Wow oil getting punished
When the loony left realize that there is no green switch that will immediately eliminate the need for fossil fuel CVX and all the oil major stock prices will jump.
A smaller purchase like EPE (EP Energy) would give them some prime Permian assets. Or just buy the acreage only and leave the non-Permian to EPE.
Inflation should help this out. See what tomorrow’s speech brings.
3% up correction due..
Entered this morning at 95.9.. naturally the moment I do the stock pulls back like I entered.
Ain’t no stoping this moflubba she rolling

"It would take an idiot to buy this stock in the 80's at this point. Realistically - under even a best case senario how far can oil bounce ($30-$40) something like that and even at those values what is the stock worth Maybe $30-$50. With oil below $10 - it is no even a question of valuation, if it is here for a prolonged period, it would be a question of survival. I am shocked this is trading at $85 after today's move. A long time ago one of my good friends coined the phase ""Idiot Pressure"" and that is what we have here - no doubt with any fool buying this at the current price..I am adding to my short positions as I type this..."

CVX is up 4.90% to $105.94
Thank God for the new conversation format. It really got rid of spammers and fixed the problems with the boards.
should i sell this dud?
Even though gold and silver prices are down quite a bit the physical is actually selling out a huge premium it will be a big snap back I want it does it’ll be in the physical market.
When was it at this price?
Bottom line strategy: Traders could go long CVX at current levels and risk a close below $98. The $103 area is our first upside price target. $115 is the next target
105 by next week
"Oil demand is shrinking, but the supply is rising exponentially! FED has PUMPED Oil prices by more than 800% since March 2020, FOR NO REASON!The US Stocks are due for a HEAVY CORRECTION! Oil is about to become USELESS and WORTHLESS!!$XOM $CVX $BP"

"merkel seriously came out and said my bad bro no lockdown for germany. wow. this shows us that even in europe there is no tolerance for this lockdown #$%$ anymore. less lockdown means more oil demand, more positive sentiment as well. let's GO!"
"If CVX had not bid for APC at all, the stock might still be around 125. Market never thought CVX needed an acquisition, But if CVX now passes, market may see it as a failure to get the acquisition that was really needed potentially resulting in a selloff. Such is the strange and irrational behavior when it comes to deals. Of course all this is only in the short term."
What is driving this massive sell off? Seems so irrational.
CVX PE Ratio (TTM) = 67.09 ?this is twice the price to earnings ratio of XOM !and XOM is about 2 times overpriced making CVX a 40 dollar stock at historical valuations upside is nil downside is huge imo as the fed begins to raise rates and people cut down on driving and move to electric cars as shale oil continues to be pumped while demand plummets !
How can this give back most of yesterday's gain on a 50 point drop in the dow?
Serious question. I am not short CVX. I wanted to own it lower and missed. Why would anyone buy up here? This isn't a price I would even entertain buying this at.
Oil is near $10/barrel. How come Chevron Stock is still Bullish??
Let's squeeze the shorties decently:-) CVX & XOM are soaring nicely........... Can't wait for tomorrows OPEC+ meeting................... shortie-BBQ just around the corner.....................

"Chevron needs to align itself more with some solar, new battery development or wind power to get millennial investor interest. Not saying to go hog wild but to diversify. Oddly, if they developed a new rocket ship to take passengers into space the stock would probably triple."
come home to mama !
Ok. Is it my imagination or does CVX stock always rise in price for the Dec 10 dividend payment. By that I mean every time the Divy is paid out the stock rises. I reinvest and I know it’s a buck 29. Still that means my FIFO doesn’t buy as much shares.
"Have any of you ever done the math as to where oil comes from and the costs associated ? LOL Probably not like Trump..... A lot of middle east countries get oil out the ground for HALF of what shale costs and other places we try..... and they need to sell that oil....and they have a lot of it. AND, demand is down.Do the math ..... not the Trump. LOL"
no wonder all those cars on the road. traffic started getting me irritated the other day and I hadn't had that feeling for about a year now. cabin fever.
Why not place a buy order at say 75 or80?So no execution if it never gets there.What's the down side?

"Exxon said Friday that it earned nearly $4 billion in the third quarter, and Chevron made $2 billion. Both were about 50 percent higher than the same quarter last year.When the year is done, analysts expect both companies to far surpass their 2016 results and keep on earning big profits next year. The relatively small profits that followed the crash in crude prices — Chevron actually lost $497 million last year — appear to be in their rearview mirror.""We're a pretty resilient bunch in this business,"" Chevron CEO John Watson said on a call with analysts."
"The oils have broken down, a correction has started so either bail or hold on for a 15 percent drop!"

So all the way out until March 2021 oil is under $35. How is $CVX supposed to create profits at that price? How is the current stock price that is 45% off the low justified?
I bought cvx @65. Should I sell now?
"As they cut production due to the lack of demand, supply will go down over the next couple of months and when states reopen, demand will skyrocket but supply won't be there. Meaning prices will triple and oil stocks will profit."

All the strong buys on cvx are going to be downgraded and CVX is going to 100 or below.
nothing can replace fossil fuels
Earning in 2 weeks with oil up almost 30% in that time period...I wonder
The comments by the company were vague. We need a statement like RDS-A delivered. A clear commitment to keeping the dividend. Get a clue management!

ui ui ui going down
Dems want to get rid of oil.
CVX should see the writing on the wall. There are not only geopolitical concerns going forward but alternative energy uses.I would like this company to better position itself for This change by among other actions to invest in the hydrogen fuel market that is being used in hybrid electric vehicles as a way of greatly extending the range. Cummings just made such investment.Suggested companies such as FCEL and PLUG seem to me to have great potential and are currently selling a very low values after the scare from coronovirus. They can be bought for chump change now.

"Oil is up .80 and this piece of shxx is down to 77, what the heck.They should keep XOM on DOW and kick CVX out."

Hence oil cos. don’t make as much money
Why is CVX it down so much today?
I get it about the long term value of CVX but this oil crash has a long way to go as does the S&P 500. Think about it. We are 15% from the top with all this stuff going on in the economy. I say the bear flag that is forming will be realized.
No big surprise the quick money is getting out this is this pre-recovery as openings continue the pressure will push oil stocks to pre-covid levels if not higher

"Buy now to get the $1.29 dividend, which is 8.4% more than the $1.19 dividend last year.SAN RAMON, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 29, 2020-- The Board of Directors of Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) declared a quarterly dividend of one dollar and twenty-nine cents ($1.29) per share, payable September 10, 2020, to all holders of common stock as shown on the transfer records of the Corporation at the close of business August 19, 2020."
Hmm. Feels merger-y or something.
its down told ya 62 will be the bottom of the cycle.
Red again as usual!!! #$%$ always keeping my portfolio down
"CVX needs to explain why they stay in California. They need the several hundred million dollars a year that would be saved by moving to Houston. I am sure Watson has a nice view from his office, but it is time to get out of California."
WTI above 44
Chevron shows the best margin among oil majors. but I am investing in Shell in view of climate change

More bad news. “What am I even doing here” still draws a breath.
Don't expect any significant move up till after Noble vote on 10/2.
"A little more due diligence for ya'll. $CVX heavily shorted last week massive volume lots of shares traded at below $123, meanwhile price targets have gone higher with $125 the lowest price target... good news for bulls IMO as the shorts cover back to $123 there will be less shares to grab since longs stay long!"

CVX should check out the acreage position of LLEX they could probably buy this acreage on the cheap and it’s very good acreage!
Hmmmm...so now Wall Street likes the deal...kooky
warden buffman is making some money
Oil is now forecasted to be around $80 by year end. Oil will be flowing in the pipelines (Look at AMZA as a pipeline trade or MLPX Energy Infrastructure) as more on the road. Given the dividends and the price to go up to pre pandemic levels this is a great stock to own.
When will WTI Oil be $50 or above??
"Interestingly, 2 days ago there was very large call activity for June, with the stock around $109. Then came the dump. Looks now like that was call selling, some unusually deep in the money at large volumes. Coincidence? All I know is that I'm very rarely that lucky."
"The new normal high is $93 bucks, so very little capital gain potential. Better to get 7% from a diversified fund than CVX or XOM who will cut dividends; not a good investment now."
Can’t wait to dump this garbage stock
OPEC US and Mexico do cut 20 million barrels a day which is awesome!
could CVX revisit mid $70s?
Jet Fuel man.
$4 dollar gas prices coming. Fair.
Any chance this continues tomorrow??
The last play I got from Awesome Stocks made me 46% in just a few days. They only alert nas and nyse so no OTC scams to worry about.
Sweeping downgrades by S&P of the majors is a huge blow to these folks. View on long term outlook is bearish.
it might take 3ro 4 years befor it breaks 100
"What a short memory you people have....GS told you to buy this about 10 days ago....they gave it hyped ratings, good management etc.....they sold short...well here we are about a 10% correction ....I'm looking at 115-116 to enter...PRO earnings and dividend info coming soon....CON mid-term election & end of month mutual fund selling."
Also Chevron is also experimenting with algae/ conversion to fuel supplement
"A value trap now, for what it's wirth."
"Great for new alternative energy, I’m sure a billion dollar company has their hands into this!! Algae ? - GREAT. Still need oil for the military muscle!!!! Cold fusion is where we should be looking!!!!!!Anyway- oil will still be a depleting source and such making it very valuable until a full transition.Idiots only think oil will die.."
OWING CVX must own FCEL PLUG BLDP SPWR JKS to balance it out - IMO
Analysts are downgrading CVX as I type due to the crash in oil!!!!!!!!! SELL NOW!!!!!!!!!!
OPEC's dilemma $XOM $EOG $PXD $CVX
Why is this appreciating when oil tanks? Guess this must be a sign of greater fool?
Yesterday it closed at 108.57 currently at 106.83. But it says it's only down .67. Why is that?
So I sold of my few $79.40 shares this morning based on the doom and gloom news out on oil. Thinking I could buy back n cheaper. It didnt drop below $82.09 and Im mad now. I gotta stop listening to CNBC.
eph u cvx.......wretched garbage
https://www.msn.com/en-us/finance/markets/oil-price-war-ends-with-historic-opec-2b-deal-to-cut-production/ar-BB12wkd2
profit taking
CVX is up 6.92% to 86.25
Oil up 17% andthis trash is droppong again
Why is this stock falling with earnings in a few days.
"Big oil needs to start fighting future battles and quit living in the past. Start allocating capital to alternative energy sources- climate change and consumer mind set is not going away, just getting stronger. As for dividend, why do they continue to fight this ""I won't cut it!"" mentatlity, when the market obviously is not rewarding them for it? Under $70 share now, yet maintain 7+% dividend while it eats into their capital and cash flows. The market would REWARD you for cutting to a maintainable level (say =/- $3/sh,, 4% yld at $75/sh). When you fix your mess and can start increasing it again, the market will reward you."
130 after earnings!
CVX reached a 52 Week low at 107.53
Support is broken!
"the Saudi are pumping the market and the tank are full no demand on oil and the oil is $18 and the market up there is something fishy going on here, any one have any explanation here ?"
"Question. I pay about $600.00 in tax at the pumps per yr. About 2 cents per mile. Do the plug in's help to maintain our roads? If so, how? If they still had to contribute, maybe yearly anti up when they get plates they would appreciate the contribution we make at the pumps that we all benefit from."
"The Price of Oil is Skyrocketing FOR NO REASON! Now they PUMPED Oil BUBBLE well above Pre-Pandemic levels, DESPITE Shrinking Demand and Skyrocketing Supply... Now we have a Massive Oil Price BUBBLE!ENJOY! KEEP GAMBLING in this Stock and Oil BUBBLE!$XOM $AAPL $AMZN $JPM $CVX"
"XOM is a heck of a buy right now, not sure why it has not gained as much ground"
So they give a raise to CEO who has lead a sharp decline but decide to lay off 15 % of workforce ?? What a joke.
"My order was in!I had an order in for 500 at $88. Then I read an article that came out yesterday (Monday) and cancelled my order for now. Will probably enter another one around $78-80. The article was by the company that begins with a ""Z"" and ends with an ""s"" and has 5 letters. If I print the name, this sickening site will probably delete my note. Anyhow, we all know that CVX won't put up great numbers in the next report. But earning a MINUS 129% this quarter and an expected MINUS 49.3% for the next, compared to the same quarter last year, is unreal. If the market wasn't being played by fools, this stock would be at $80 now, or even $60. Even though they have said their dividend is safe until the end of the year, lowering the dividend in the Fall combined with a huge second virus wave, and we could be in a world of hurt. I'm just wondering what you guys think. If you're under 45, don't bother replying. Thirty year olds have no clue what a real bear market looks and feels like. What we had in March was a joke, except for a few weeks. Let it last a few years and then you can talk to me about what you think CVX is really worth."
We make Amerika great again
OIl stocks can do whatever they want over the short term I trust them as long as oil stays above 50
"They just increased dividend and the ex date is coming up, no reason to sell, oil is only getting started"
CVX the only way is going is UP. Oil over $50 and vaccination just started.
I find it interesting that on the same day CVX disappointed the market on earnings the board of directors announced an increase in compensation for top management. To me they should go in the same direction - if earnings go up then compensation should go up. But if earnings do not go up should compensation?
Bought at 68.74. Worst case scenario a 7.5% dividend and 30% below fair value purchase pays for itself in 7 years.
fire sale coming in hot! probably should start buying oil tankers ladies and gents
"Thinking of opening a position here. Looking for honest opinions. Should I start today, or is there more downside in the coming days?"
"Consolidation scenarios?People will say it’s impossible, but whatever, they still happen. If (IF) it got to the point where the few remaining super majors consolidated what is more likely;1 - Cvx+Xom / Rds+BP Home bases America and Europe.2- Xom+Rds / Cvx+BP"
CVX is so overpriced for where we are at right now. 51-55 was a great price. This and other oil companies have come way too far.
$107.20 to $105.90 in just 30 minutes? wow
1st buy went through
CVX's decision to wall away from Anadarko is probably ranked one of the best corporate decisions of all time.
BETTER HOPE THAT TRUMP WINS OR KISS YOUR OIL STOCKS GOODBYE!! CHINA WILL TAKE OVER AMERICA IMO.
we lost 12B in stock value plus 1b breakup fee so if we walk we recover and might be able to get APC because OXY does not have any exp in lng and finance might not be doable
Oil is king. What's even better a well managed oil major with great dividend.
Stock is up 20% from its low in Feb its due a pull back ..When summer comes and COVID restrictions lift is when I see oil stocks jumping. It all depends if your a buy and hold or short term trader but I feel this will be a good year for oil and commodies
"Let it fall, don’t halt ANYTHING If people sell and it proves to be a bad cal... Too bad"
huh up and down movement today is odd. No direction.
I prefer CVX over XOM
Oil inventories dropped by 2.5M barrels should be bullish for oil... time to climb the wall of worry!
Anybody that says CVX is in an uptrend is delusional.
Folks.... You know how to invest in the oil companies (not stocks) and which oil companies are the most popular to invest???? Thank you
73 today?
"as long as oil stay above $42.50, CVX should go over $100 soon!"
Demand is a big issue going forward
TIME TO BUY!!!
"Management, best in the industry. If you sell I will be there to buy."
72 cents per share and upped dividend ..nice ...Premarket doesnt like it but im happy im long term mainly collecting dividend until I think it gets over priced
Back to $65 very soon
XOM is better.......more juice to the upside with the divy
XOM > CVX in terms of greater upside potential.
OPEC agreed to continue with the cuts in production.....
CVX will see 90's soon !watch and see as opec and frackers keep pumping and demand keeps falling !
"Chevron is an iconic American brand. Realize the reopening is just getting started, so many people in the blue states have abided by cdc guidelines and are only now just going back into the real world. Atleast 3 more blowout quarters for earnings!!!"

I will have CVX assigned at $100 on March 19 having sold calls at that strike and expiration. I wish you all good luck in the coming month. A manipulated market crowded with so many new players who are simply gamblers and not investors almost guarantees a real sell off in the not-to-distant future. Good luck when the selling begins.

Is there a real reason why we are not back to 90 ???
I put in an order to sell at $96. I believe that chevron will go up $2-3 again tomorrow. Chevron has made me $53k in passive income since it’s crash in March. I would like to thank the fine folks at chevron for making me a wealthier man. This extra income has changed my life.
chevron has almost doubled itself in the last 2 monthsthat means alot right?
"why is it these ""container"" homes have to re-framed on the inside? So much work, and then it is still a container home."

Oil prices falling
"100 is next level down! It will bounce, then plunge back to 90 with the oil collaspe!!"
"From the last earnings call by the CFO...[Turning to the next slide. Our financial priorities remain unchanged. We're on track to grow the dividend for the 33rd straight year.]If that is true, then this is a very well-managed company compared to some of the others..."

Oil is alive and healthy. The economy is starting to rip.
"Oil may be the ""apartheid"" of investments but humans can't live without it -- we'll be using it until our last dirty gasp."

Oil is heading towards $100/barrel guys since the vaccines are now distributed world wide.
Win win. Trump is friendly to oil. Biden will drive oil up to $60 barrell

buy buy baby. tomorrow upside
They tried to stop people from using cigarettes...They just forced the price higher they didnt stop anyone from using them. Oil will not go away either unless you kill off the human race. I think I saw a movie like that :)
I bet we see under 20 dollars CVX...
"Now back to 100, a bounce, then to 96 major support, so hang on to your boots."
Seems like a disconnect from the price of oil at this level. YTD oil is down about 60% and $CVX is down 30%. Something has to give in my opinion. Nothing to do at this point it watch. If it continues to rally to the 50day without oil rising this would be the short of the century.

why is this dropping so much >?
"Nobody believes oil will stay this low for an extended period of time, it's just shorts playing with each other for the last 1+ month, see who can out-short each other. That squeeze is coming and and many will lose their shirts. Energy stocks are ignoring the oil price decline, no different from the overall markets brushing off the 22 million unemployment number. Nobody believes this will last. Short at your own peril."
sure beats dynegy dave o'reillys billion dollar gift when enron was tanking
I know that anything between here and 60 is nothing but pure profit.
If oil was up this would be $120 today
Cvx hits $100 next week
Chevron is now down 35% from its 52-week high. I think this is a great entry point for the long-term investor happy trading everybody
california ran out of wind and had to have brown outs...
Great opportunity to exit now and buy upcoming green energy king Plug power ticker:PLUG
Why does this stock keep dropping? Most of the oil stocks are up big today. XOM in dog house as well.
Oil is up and CVX down. Makes little sense.
I guess oil stocks will never be a good investment again.
No longer hold this. Heading to a 52 week low of $110 then sub $100 and will trade between $95-$105 imo. Negative revs and earnings growth.
oil up 17% in afterhrs!
day trader's dream
Massively oversold -Get while the getting is good
"CVX shouldn't be anywhere near $90 given current oil prices in the $10's and low $20's, mounting losses and oil majors that have to borrow billions to pay an unsustainable dividend. To restore balance, either CVX should go to mid $70's or oil has to move to the mid $30's - $40."
"saudi is lowering prices, get ready for a hit"
"Amazing timing by Chevron to buy Anadarko right before Trump shut off Iranian oil to the world market....and crude heading up higher, much higher. Always good to have people on the inside, especially with this administration. Good job guys."
PURE JUNK
"Oil price up, CVX down???"
"Oil/gas is a global market...hence the merger would make a large player, not a monopoly."
Who needs oil when so many more people everyday are driving EVs?
Crude trading lower again today but $CVX and $XOM up premarket. Any Kong’s should do themselves a favor and buy some puts.
California is a nightmare. Elon Musk is officially gone. C'MON CVX board...it's time to move corporate to Texas and return value to the shareholders.
BUY BUY!! back to 120 by early next week
Trump meeting with oil execs Friday and stock down 5%. Is it about to rebound? What could he possible do for big oil right now? He is a bigger fan of low oil prices to help rest of economy.
Oil cos have to start laying off people again
very disappointing smh
"Bank of America analyst Doug Leggate had a change of heart concerning Chevron CVX, giving the oil company a double upgrade to buy from sell."

Why CVX will go higher from here?? There will be more people to travel soo cars/trucks/airlines/cruise lines need oil/gas due to the following news.1> $900B stimulus package could be released on Friday or next week2> Alex Azar (HHS secretary) just stated that the vaccine roll-out is gong out smoothly and so well.

I bought CVX based on its books. Will oil ever come back.
Not sure why $CVX doesn’t pursue $FANG since they wanted a Permian player and tried to get Anadarko. Even at today’s price $FANG is still trading well under book value and has little debt considering their earnings.
CVX is a bloated pig....... went up to much and too fast........ this pos could end up around $70

We change government policies to discourage oil and gas production. Part of this is to limit supply to drive up the price of gasoline and diesel fuel. This makes green alternative energy more tenable because it is cheap relative to oil and gas.In the US, the easy policies of the old administration actually hurt the oil and gas industry. They drilled and drilled until the US became the world leading exporter of oil and gas. Then COVID happened and world wide demand dropped by 8% - that’s right only 8%.So far in 2021, demand has recovered by 5%. As of right now, we are only using 3% less oil and gas than we were. Does that sound like a dead industry? Absolutely not.The meteoric stock price rise of solar companies and $TSLA is a bubble. The profits are not there.Now with oil at $53 and Nat Gas at $2.85 - oil companies are profitable.With oil and gas supply being limited by policy - we can expect oil to be $75 by 2022 and over $100 by 2023 - 2035. This is the last golden age of black gold. The last bull market of oil before the oil majors buyout the green energy companies with the treasure troves of cash they are going to generate over the next 15 years.So...take your profits and buy $OXY $XLE $XOM $CVX $ET & $GEL. You’ll triple your money in two years."
Why did they realize lower NG price in Q3/16 vs Q3/15? Average NYMEX NG price was a few % higher in Q3/16 than Q3/15.
Easy beat Fri. Get lost Melanie Troll. Hahaha
"If CVX had to follow the new banking regulations, the dividend would've been eliminated the moment oil broke below $51/barrel 4 months ago."

Do oil prices still not matter for $XOM and $CVX long investors? Asking for a friend...
Heard chevron looking to buy oxy since they were bidding for andarko like a two for oneAny thoughts
100 very soon!
So why are the posting dates all scattered? Can't tell if I'm coming or going trying to read these posts? Why is Yahoo doing this? Anybody know? I'm really confused.
...........Now that Buffet dropped CVX like a hot potato  and CVX Latest Earnings were bad......Switch now to the new winner.......XOM is you best choice..........
Chevron up after topping Q1 estimates. Short term target: 147 at stoxline.

"The good news, is CVX maybe buying back 5 Billion shares?"
This company will suck you dry. Sell as soon as you can! Total manipulation! Not a good investment at this time. Will lose 20% by the end of the year!
"There will be cheap flights for a few months, and oil will continue surging very fast... faster than airlines... I'm already buying tickets!!"
Crude is rocketing higher.
"Profit Taking on the back of this bogus jawboning to spread misinformation. Let's be real, the World is being flooded with OIL. The unemployment numbers are the worst in History. The Pandemic is in Full Force in our Country and the Economy is essentially shut down. Rumors like this are wrong and only serves to undermine the credibility of our markets. The Markets will sell off further, based on the facts and not the rumors...."

How do they pay the dividend if they're losing so much per share ? I don't understand
Looking bloated. Sell
CVX is up 8.90% to 75.43
"Buy at the dip :,-)"
Tell me what cutting the dividend will do to CVX. They don't have the cash flow to pay it as the current price of crude!
For those of you who say oil is going to 100 just why do you think that is possible?
Saudi oil just attacked
Hopefully it will support at 81.51.
Let’s do a pollEarnings beat thumbs upEarnings miss thumbs down
I think the oil stocks will pop soon - sleeping giant
Perhaps we’ll have a little pre-earnings bump ahead of tomorrow.
100 soon...but don't look for 120..
Bought another 1000 chips great company oil will be 60 Dollar during Christmas driving season.
now going to 116.96 within the next two or three days!
a divi cut will help pay for this.
Exxon vs chevron..... go!
........XOM beat on top and bottom I told you guys too buy XOM......The true winner....I’m not happy CVX missed but just saying CVX is not the top oil anymore so ......BUY XOM NOW.......
As an XOM shareholder I like the deal CVX made.
Is Chevron looking at buying Encana?
"So Saudi Arabia and Russia have this so called price war right in the middle of a worldwide crisis. Hmmmm.Worldwide demand plummets then on top they both flood the markets with more oil.....stay with me!What did they accomplish?? A lot. Every single part of the oil space tanked. Who's buying oil company's?? Saudi Arabia. Why? because the very company's they decimated are so cheap they will more then make it back when they get oil back to $80.0+/- Now look at the USO options (calls) and go out as far as you want, the volume is hundreds of thousands of contracts. January 2022 calls yesterday were well over 100000 contracts.$cvx$rds/a$bp$amlp$sun$tsla$bsm$nugt"

"In order to do all this electrification.... It's going to require a lot of building of charging stations,,,,,,,metals, plastics, digging, wiring, etc, and it's not going to happen overnight. Which means, you're going to use a lot of oil getting there, because construction workers don't drive Tesla's lol. Bulldozers don't run on electricity."
They plan on buying back stock with the 1 billion dollar break up fee. They should pay out a special dividend of approx 50 cents per share and they should pay down long term debt of 36 billion instead of buying back 5 billion in shares. Contact investor relations and demand the special dividend and that they pay down debt before buying back stock.
The more bad news the higher this goes.Will shoot above 100 on earnings miss !
Dividend announced today?
$55 soon

"Quad-Witch day will be a one of very specific trading day in last decade.It is the reason than we are experiencing an artificial market manipulation by Short Sellers who have targeted massive amounts of options which will be expired on March 19th.These are last huge batch of options which remains in oil sector.THEY WANA TO KILL OPTIONS AND CAUSE WORTHLESS EXPIRY WITHOUT STOCK CLAIM.There will be a epic battle on Friday.If longs win then we will see one of the biggest historical short squeeze in oil sector history.Just look at to number of short selling for today:XOM: First hand shares for trade:( 9.169M) shares ,Short volume:(5.22M)shares (57% of coming shares for trade)CVX: ( Vol 3.404M) ,(Short 1.492M) ,( 44%)OXY:(Vol 6.157M) ,(Short 3.592M) ,(58%)SU: (Vol 1.992M), (Short 0.616M) , (31%)CLR: (Vol 0.748M) ,( Short 0.366M), (49%)CDEV: (Vol 11.07M) (Short 7.587M) ,(69%)ENB: (Vol 0.845M) ,( Short 0.411M) ,( 49%)CNQ:(Vol 0.52M) ,(Short 0.21M ),( 41%)QEP: (Vol 2.105M),(Short 1.472M),(70%)All other oil sector are same .Remember since a week ago oil price is almost same.COMING FRODAY IS A VERY IMPORTANT DAY.BUY AS YOU CAN ON THIS DAY OR BEFORE FRIDAY.I BELIEVE STARTING NEXT WEEK CURRENT STOCK PRICES WILL BE HISTORY.#XOM, #CVX, #OXY,#SU, #CLR, #CDEV, #ENB, #CNQ, #QEP"
"Best long term stock, period. No other stock, in any space, comes close."
79.99...better hold
I president elect that vows oil and gas and its up this much 
I expect oil to be well over a $100 a barrel this summer. I bought cvx at around $102 a share and expect $150 is around the corner.
Be prepared for the dividend to be cut hopefully not eliminate
Not going to meet expenses with oil price. Cant cut expenses or divi. Too used to livin high on the hog at chevron. In for a rude awakening.
and yield doesn't matter

Im sick of losing money on this trash should have listen to my instinct and got out at 103 last month.
YESTERDAY CLOSED AT $102.65 WHY IT SHOWS $101.55?
$135 next week.
"Serious problems for short holders. Spot market prices skyrocketing with the shutting of 5 refineries in Texas. Pipelines shutdown due to freezing in pipes and demand skyrocketing. It isn't expected to end anytime soon with more storms expected this week. Oil headed to $70+ shory term and $80+ by end of Q2. Coronavirus recovery and the economy reopening will push oil much, much higher."
BUY! heading to $135 by year end
Buy Plug!! Get out of Fossil fuels..

Boolean"
Quite a month for me since my largest positions are AMGN and CVX. It was hard to watch CVX yesterday. Many are surprised OXY held quite well. The explanation is simple. The street expects CVX to win APC. Unfortunately the view is that our mgmt team will increase the bid between $5 and $10 to win APC. I do not CVX to raise the bid. I want us to walk away if we “need” to pay over $65 for APC. Can this Mgmt team walk away from APC. It seems the answer is no and that is the reason the stock has suffered.
This stock is a dog!
Is this stock still a buy?
"I think I might just hold my nose and buy me some of this nasty oil stick , I hope this sell off last a few more trading sessions, looking to get in under 80"
$100 by this Friday
Should we be hearing about the dividend soon?
Only a 4.6% divvy. up side is capped from here.
There is a federal 18.4 cent per gallon tax on gasoline and 25 cents on diesel plus state taxes on every gallon sold. Elec vehicles pay nothing. They need to get rid of all the tax incentives for elec cars before the states go broke. But how? Tax the charging stations? Tax the vehicles? We shall see.
Chevron needs to go the way of shell n buy. ev charging station companies. a couple of good ones are EVUS
Just in...CVX going to 120+ on impending acquisition of smaller players...
$6.50 per boe. I read Noble has 2 billion barrels reserves. Not too bad.
"Crude nearing $40, if this trend continues or at least doesn't reverse it can't help but to push share price higher. Demand will only increase going forward and by going forward I mean in the near and mid term future. While there's no doubt battery use in transportation is on the incline most things still move by oil related products and will for many many years to come. Covid will not last forever and I will bet those reading this likely use gasoline in their transportation needs."
Byedung said he will eliminate oil subsidies.
Good smart acquisition!

"CVX is still overvalued.......good short here at $105.....close stop just above, but downside is great! Especially, IF the market implodes from here....and it is hanging by a thread technically."
"Pragmatically W Buffet did great riding the gravy train of anything that works. And burning our way to prosperity has worked very well since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Now we know it is a pipe dream and the bill is coming due. Pragmatism as originally conceived aimed at long term common good. This makes the commercial by Chevron, that they will help us keep doing what we do.....a bet on self destruction, a denial of climate change, denial of science, and a bet against future generations. Of course i could be wrong and they decide to help the putting out of the fire they fuel but Warren may be attacked by his shareholders for being that honest and considerate. He is fully swimming in the deep end of the deep swamp of pollution for a dollar today. Tell me i am wrong."
EVERYONE IN OIL MARKET KNOWS THAT BROKER EMPLOYED INTERNET AUTHORS ARE PROMOTING OIL STOCKS IN INTERNET SINCE COVID STARTED. THEY MARKET SHELL MARATHON BP OXY IN INTERNET FORUMS.

"Winter is coming. Heating and hurricanes is good for business. CXV is at the floor so stock up, wont stay at 70's for long."
I think the price off CVX down has to do the purchase of NOBEL E there is a war with Singer and they don't have enough votes
What a beautiful stock
What’s the dividend??
so I see some Anthony Grisanti of GRZ ENERGY says OIL GOES LOWER....he is not correct. He is not accounting for two things...at the minimum....Donald Trump who is unhinged and with his minions want to attack IRAN just as Bush/Cheney wanted Iraq BEFORE THINGS WENT DOWN.....AND....the risk from Drones is real and the price premium will have to account for that and how easy it was for the attackers to hit their target with power and accuracy. No oil path will be safe.....so I see oil holding firm and building support as the democrats look to take power and go for infrastructure rebuild which will totally invigorate the present sluggish economy brought to bear on the USA by Donald Trump.....if he would have just golfed (oh i won't have time to golf...but already has done more than Obama did in 8 years) things would be fine but the Disaster Donald had to be KING....
It is time CVX executive pay. They can live on $1 million per year instead of $2 million per year. I hope the Board see this and pays no bonuses in 2020.
"what a gift, loading up at this price, will be $125 next week"

Please don't upgrade this to a buy again! If they do it might hit 60!
"We will see $1.50 gas by Christmas, just like the last two years. Maybe $1.25 this year and CVX won't like it a bit."

Should we follow Buffet to energy stocks???He's late to the party!!!
"Sorry but these lower our prices will impact earnings at $CVX, $XOM and $RDSA/B in the next quarter. Feels like worldwide demand slowdown hitting bottom lines.New lows ahead across oil patch."
Disgusting is all I can say for what Chevron contributed to Trumps inauguration!! Totally disgusting!

"I wrote on the Noble message board something about CVX stock holders collecting shares in an effort to vote for the merger. It was more of a joke, then I started thinking... hey if the share price is below the price that Chevron announced they were going to pay per share $10.38 then this may not be a bad idea.I purchased 5 shares prior to the proxy vote share ownership deadline. (purchased more since then.)Due to guilt, I wont vote for the merger... probably."
"I own both ""best of breed"" in CVX AND EOG. I'm thrilled to see EOG management rewarding shareholders with a special dividend!! Now I'm wondering what are the chances that CVX does the same?? Thoughts anyone??"
How many bottles of lube does this company make.
most likely cvx will buy chk
Hope OXY gets it. Too expensive a deal for CVX and will get 3% if APC goes with OXY as I understand it in a break up fee.
7 dollars a share. Soon
"The guy in the comments mentioned that’s it’s undervalued, agree, but not by $6, but by 16. $136 looks like a fair value. Interesting long term play in here!"

Im giddy here tons of upside in this sector as muppets chase bubbles
You can't go wrong with Chevron.
"The reason that CVX fell 3% today is a result that the market is anticipating CVX will up the offer by 5$ to 10$ To takeover APC. So if they walk away from the bidding war, CVX can easily go up 8$ to 10$."
"$OXY $XOM $CVX Biden said “I will join the Paris accord “. Delusional. The Wuhan virus left us with Debt. With the accord, we end up subsidizing with our electric vehicles, Chindia / Africa billion populations pollution."

under 8$ a barrel this should be at 40$
CVX is a garbage company lol
considering what happened to the price of crude this wasn't too bad yesterday.
Is this still above $70?
Buying the dip. There are other Permian opportunities out there if Chevron wants to pursue it. Take the 1 billion and move on imo
mid 90ties next
This company is not what you think it is. Be careful.
Filled 103
A little PR from Wirth goes a long way.
"Congratulations, Mike Wirth! Not taking a deal at your terms is one of the best deals one can make. Thank you for looking after the shareholders and prospecting for deals that make sense. Any way, Chevron currently is the largest Permian producer and will emerge as the largest when full plans are implemented in a few years. APC deal would have cemented that status with very little competition. Therefore, nothing is really disadvantageous in foregoing the purchase of APC. CHEERS"
Looks like they threw everything they possibly could into this earnings loss. Took the maximum loss up front unlike what other companies are doing and taking smaller ones for a bunch of quarters. Chevron taking them all at once...
CALL FOR DELIVERY BEFORE EARNINGS...
"got nice 6% dividend this morning , bought more! Thanks CVX"
Bottom is in IMO
"YEARLY LOW IS YET TO COME=EXPECT AT LEAST 40% =+ADDITIONAL CORRECTION IN THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVE.CVX WILL BE ON THE FRONT OF THE LINE...INSIDERS ARESMART...I SOLD OUT=BOUGHT RDSA=LOTS CHEAPER... andalready corrected in march , and a fair values =better management...."
Probably a wrong discussion I got rid of all my oil stocks and oil equipment supply companies! Oil demand has one path and the world is going to use less!
"So, if Chevron hadn't been buying back its own stock in the $120s, would they have the cash to buy even MORE shares back at $70? They profess to maintain the dividend despite having to amass more debt to do so and are laying off employees as if they were the cause of this dire situation (and have done so since the Gulf Oil merger). They are not preparing for a future where oil is a component of energy consumption and not the main driver. Oil is the modern-day buggy whip and we know what happened to its producers."
5 dollar oil
LOL CRUDE OIL $51 ...CVX RED?
"Well Buffet, looks like you timed this poorly as well."
.......Yet again.....XOM is kicking CVX where the sun don’t shine....XOM up 3.60% CVX only 1.8%.....
What's gonna happen when CVX cuts the divi? All hell will break loose since the only reason people are in this is because of the divi and nothing else.
Option expiration day. Lots of $103 calls in jeopardy.
Im in below 100.00. average down from there.
Oil contracts are in June are $10 higher than now...when businesses reopen in May then oil consumption will be in higher demand
Sell this garbage! It will take you down!
Do you think our dividend is safe? Would CVX suspend or cut?

buy buy on dip
"CVX in a precarious situation. Enormous pressure to raise the dividend which they can't even pay right now without borrowing or selling more assets. I understand that just almost all their assets ""are on the table"". This is a self-destructive position as the more you sell, the less income you have to meet the next dividend. And on and on hoping that crude recovers. With that being said, somehow OXY raised their dividend on Friday while they are losing a ton of money. An interesting article in WSJ today discussing EnerVest oil & gas fund which is going belly up from $2B to zero and taking Wells Fargo and several pension funds for a big hit."
IF IT BREAKS THE 92...93...LEVEL 85.00
"CVX getting killed. Took my losses.....this is going to be a terrible quarter for the energy stocks....fundamentally of course CVX is in good shape, but with the risk of a recession significantly greater, it is going to be a tough ride for a while and I was just unwilling to accept more loss. Good luck everybody and if oil starts turning around, I will be back in a flash."
Green in a sea of red. So glad I didn't abandon ship during this last year. Dividend king. Oil isn't going anywhere.

Dow futures down 470 points after trump talking about increasing Tariffs. More news about APC and OXY reaches a deal to sale African assets to Total for $8.8b. So with futures down 470 points does CVX raises the bid because I hate for this stock to go to $110 but that is were we are headed.

FED is spending billions $$ purchasing ETFs. XLE must be one of them.
Looks like a buy the dividend stocks day. All div stocks I watch are up.
Merger/Buyout possibility with Exxon is just a ploy to sell more call options.
80 billion back to investors...
"Fools are buying this for the divi. CVX will be forced to cut their Divi and then the Stock will really crash, likely back down to the march lows. I know, I know, no one believes this will happen, but watch and learn. You can't continue to borrow money to pay that big fat divi. They can't print money like the FED!"
"If Chevron wants any chance to pump what it projects to pump in the Permian without #$%$ out, it should buy Marathon Oil (MRO) at $26 and produce now instead of playing the waiting game it did. It screwed up the Andarko deal, Marathon would fit WAY better to reach the permian goals"
Who is ready for the sweet taste of a CVX dividend? Let's get to $94 while we are at it!

Buy now! oil wont stay down for long once the county reopens
How long does APC has to make a decision? The action on CVX is brutal since the announcement. Is Mgmt going to increase the bid? I hope not. Let get the $1b and walk away. Please contact IR and let them know you do NOT want them to increase the bid. I want our Mgmt team to come out and say $65 is the bid. Take it or leave and gives us a $1b. This has gone to far and it is destroying shareholders of CVX. When will this end?

Lower highs lower lows !""Royal Dutch Shell's CEO Ben Van Beurden said the company was focusing on the idea of oil prices that were ""lower forever"". The company says it's shifting its focus from oil to natural gas, and is planning on taking a bigger role in renewable energy so as not to miss out on a potential EV boom.

CVX is down 13.66% to 82.30
Who died?
Anyone living in or doing business in CA needs to have their head examined....CVX needs to move headquarters to DE like any smart business owner will do.....will save millions in tax and overhead.....
"Berkshire dumped half their shares, time to collect profits folks."
Still way overpriced ! gasoline demand going down as we approach fall.
Time to move out of oil and gas stocks soon. The world is now on course to renewables. Their reign has passed.
Sell now before it’s too late
Crazy oil is going up despite the reduced demand and bulging inventories. Of course Saudi/Russia/USA will reduce output - there is no place to store it ! Only a matter of time for oil to trace lower and it will not rise until people are back to work driving up demand.
Inventories up. Oil will be down big in the morn .
"This should be cleared by end of next week, so hopefully CVX will level off in the low $120s"
Oil is not going away maybe overpriced electric cars will disappear.
could have had CVM instead.
good buying time going long

"Time to cash out and sell all fossil fuel, bank, healthcare, military, and industrial stocks as they are much too risky to own in the event Biden wins and Democrats take control of the Senate. Biden is already on record for rescinding much of the corporate tax cut which will significantly lower corp earnings and stock prices; increase capital gains tax rate to 39.5%; spend $2 TRILLION on global warming to reduce temperatures by 1 to 2 degrees if he can get China and India to play along; re-regulate fracking which will reduce supply and increase energy costs for the poor and middle class; legalize millions of ILLEGAL poor and uneducated immigrants which will increase spending on welfare, healthcare, and education increasing national debt; and re-engage Iran and China like Bush and Obama did. Obama said don't underestimate Biden's ability to really #$%$ things up during 2020 Democratic primaries, which is why he failed to endorse Biden until well after he got the nomination. Robert Gates, former Secretary of Defense for BOTH Bush AND Obama, said Biden has been wrong on virtually every major foreign policy stance. Biden is a complete senile idiot that makes Dan Quayle look like a genius. Yet if all you watch is CNN and MSNBC, and ready Huffington Post, Yahoo News, and NY Times you'd think he's an intelligent, and competent moderate. Sell your stocks before the correction occurs within next couple of months."
"Dividend is safe and the CEO claims he has gone through similar crisis before... Nonsense, this will go down much further, just wait when storage tanks are full and in April Saudis increase production to 12M bpd."
"Can anyone give me one good reason that Chevron remains in California? Between taxes and the overt hostility of the communities that it has facilities in, the financial drain has to be a material impairment to the performance of this stock. The only thing I can figure out is that the Executive committee like their wine country estates."

I SHORT OXY OIL ( BANKRUPT EVEN DELAYED 2020 FINANCIAL RESULTS) AND LONG CVX
"WTI Crude OilThe WTI Crude Oil market had a very volatile session on Monday, losing almost $1.00 in a single hour. The oil markets have been a bit ahead of themselves, and the massive selling looks likely to continue. If we can break below the $48 level on volume and of course a close below the daily lose, I think that the market could go towards the $47.50 level next, and then below there. I think rallies at this point will be sold, as we are starting to face a significant amount of bearish pressure in a market that is oversupplied. I have no interest in buying, least not until we break above the $49 level, which does not look likely after this type of selloff."
"Crude oil inventories fell 7.99 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a draw of 2.346 million barrels. I think demand will increase more this week and during the summer driving vacations and opening flights with Europe and China."
no no no it's heading south. Another another dip. Stockmarket is getting repetitive. No rebound yet.
It looks like CVX is going up slowly from here also short covering is happening:)

"Chevron may have to sweeten offer for Anadarko after rival Occidental bidPUBLISHED 12:57 PM ET WED, 24 APRIL 2019 UPDATED 8 HOURS AGO Tom DiChristopher@tdichristopherCNBC.COMMost analysts see Chevron winning a bidding war with Occidental for Anadarko Petroleum.Chevron may have to increase its $65 per share offer by roughly $5-$10 per share to claim its prize, several analysts say.Occidental is offering $76 per share, but Anadarko shareholders would prefer to hold Chevron's stock, according to analysts."
Going down a lot more

"BARRONS 4/3/2020: ""For investors who want some exposure to oil and gas, Chevron (CVX) is the most attractive stock on a relative basis. Its balance sheet is strong enough to protect its 7% dividend yield and the company has made commitments to slow drilling and preserve cash. Should oil prices shudder again—a likely outcome—Chevron can continue on its current path. If other producers start looking to sell, the company should have enough capital to take advantage and possibly buy valuable acreage at a discount.“We’re focused on fortress balance sheets at companies that will survive,” says Jeff Wyll, an energy analyst at Neuberger Berman. “Chevron is one name—a survivor with a fortress balance sheet.”"
Why is Chevron doing so well......It's spelled WIRTH best CEO in the country!!
"Seems odd to me that back on September 14, 2019 when Yemen (?) hit Saudi oil terminal they had no defense?? How can it be possible that their source of revenue went unprotected?

Saudi Arabia has just been warned by someone.$2222.SR$xom$oxy$tvix$sdow$nugt$cvx$bp$rds/a"
so oil creeps higher and supply demand improves yet 1 of the best oil Stocks in the W0RLDcontinues to not go uphmmmm when exactly is this turn coming?
Payout ratio of that divvy is only 309%. So whats not to like? And PE ratio still way too high and revenue dropping and earnings dropping and a lot more debt than cash. But its not as bad as Exxon on that last note. They are in a better position on payout ratio but a lot more debt than cash. Chevron should be sucking up the very cheap debt right now. Think I may still wait to buy calls.
The daily manipulations of the market are very interesting ...I wonder when fundamentals will matter

"~40%, or 40M barrels/day, of 100M barrel/day crude oil demand wiped out for 6-8 weeks and oil traders are cheering 10-15M barrel/day cut for 2 months? Even at a 20M barrel/day cut for 2 months, that's a 20M barrel/day surplus for 2 months and all the oil storage capacity in the world will still fill up. Short-term bounce last week, pull back once the Q2 horror show begins with earnings revisions and governments attempting to reopen economies. Too many ""ifs"" and ""whens"" for me. Long-term and medium-term oil bull here, but the short-term still looks bearish along with the rest of the market."

I pulled out a lot before Christmas and lost a lot in gains for doing so . I also gambled with AMC and got burned . Not doing that again . Are these oil stocks too high , I got burned on PSX buying at $80 last year , it went to $120 and I kept it during the pandemic (Very bad move ) Then sold it lower then I paid for it (another dumb move on my part ) I'm still learning , Every time I sell something it goes up .

Oil stocks have been in a bear market for many years.
Here is the futures contracts out 10 years. Note the price of crude for August 2023....its $54/bbl. About 3 years out. It was much higher 6-months ago but hopefully this helps answer all the questions of how CVX can survive on $13/bbl oil. Answer is......they don't sell their oil at cash prices. The oil they are producing today was sold many years ago. Only way we can plan for capital projects. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CL%3DF/futures?p=CL%3DF

oil is always tough but then it goes up in a new bull slow and steady. wait for the inflation when people go back to work. no way it stays cheap only until election is done.
CVX should stick to the original offer and let APC management decide which one to take. Walk away if it has to. OXY will have difficulty lining up financing for the deal and might not even get shareholder approval. Financial discipline is important in the volatile oil market.

Chevron should stay tight. Shouldn't take the bait for a bidding war.
I'm a buyer at $118
72 is the new fair value div cut in April. You have been warned.
"Chevron is part of a cyclical sector that has been following a 5 to 6 year cycle. Last peak was in 2014 and the previous peak in 2008. The troughs happen within a year or two of the peak. The next peak could happen in 2020. We might see a run up to that. Of course everything depends on oil price behavior. We should see oil making a run to 100+ in the next couple of years. It always runs way higher than it should on speculation. This time we could even see a run to 200. Chevron looks lean and mean to take advantage of that run up. In the mean time, a very healthy dividend is always there. So start accumulating and stay long and strong."
Oil will always be used in some form another- chevron will invest into alternative energy also- this company will survive/surprise everyone
Cheap gasoline is going to be a disincentive to move to alternative energy sources.
Well done Chevron management!
"Buying more today, got more GE and loading up on BA as if this morning. Long holds of course. Buffett mentality. Still have many biopharmas in the fold."
85.00 by ...x-mas !
"CVX shareholders keep turning their nose up at XOM, yet XOM had better numbers in 2020. That's got to sting."
Both will make you money in the next 12 months but XOM is the better pick.
I like it at 80
is it good time to buy CVX???
let's ramp this bleach to the moon this summer
is CVX a good buy right now?
135$ conservative price target by the end of this year
Oil up and Chevron down. Getting very irritated and poorer by the day.
XOM market cap almost close to $CVX. Wow!
The worst has yet to come. Do not catch a falling knife.https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/11/chevron-11-billion-writedown-could-hit-the-entire-market.html
"Cramer pumping energy, gte will soar tomorrow!"
Once the Iran sanctions go into effect oil prices will rise so buy buy buy
That old Geiser Warren Buffhead is taking this down by selling 50 % of his shares
"US10Y at 1.5% and CVX yield is at 4%, while oil is this cheap. Bottom is here. There is no way this stock will stay here for long. Just no way."
sold off @ 111. I have a limit buy order for 970 shrs @ 104Maybe I should set that at 103?
127 to 116 ... mark
Can I assume the 1% down this morning is due to potential Venezuela loss?
Chance for an outside day.Bullish reversal
you just wait till this is over people are gonna be buying cars and driving everywhere. conversion Van's trucks cars....fuel travel movement....you watch
dow up 460 and this dog wont move
I dont see those posters that were waiting for CVX to drop 95 anymore...
Trump is Fake Everything. A complete laughing stock.
"Fund managers doing their usual. Churn one week, burn the next, repeat....."
Crude is up 5% today but watch CVX remain stagnant
Trump will now save the Oil industry but after coal and steel first. LOL !!!
Going retest lows. I am buyer at 50.
Target price for Chevron was raised to $144 by Morgan Stanley today
Only direction is down with the world reducing it's carbon footprint.
what you think: sell cvx into this latest move up?
should i buy more shares at this price?
Exxon is a far better buy than Chevron.
June 5th this year oil was in the 39.50 range and CVX was a $100.00 stock.....go figure!
OK...enough Yahoo. Enough of this garbage postings over and over day after day of those idiot end of the world nonsense. You have been hacked. Just like my yahoo email....by russians. Had to open up another one on gmail. Much better. You are toast. Going to lose this forum if you do not clean it up.
There’s no merger guys it’s just anti ev stupidity meme potential.
"We raise our '16 EPS estimate by $0.10 to $1.38, but keep '17's flat at $4.43. Our 12-month target of $107, up $3, reflects a 7X multiple of enterprise value to projected '17 EBITDA, above CVX's historical average, but below that of rival Exxon Mobil (XOM 86 ***). Q3 EPS of $0.49, vs. $1.09, was $0.10 above our estimate. CVX beat XOM on Q3 upstream per-unit profitability, mainly from narrower U.S. losses. We are surprised by the dividend hike to an annualized $4.40/share, since this eats up virtually all of estimated '17 earnings. We see CVX tapping the balance sheet if needed.""dividend hike EATS up all of 2017 estimates'.....just like XOM, do Anything IN THE SHORT RUN TO PROP UP THE PRICE. I saw this BS in 2006 with home builder's as they bought back shares at the top to support share price as INSIDERS SOLD!!! This is a recipe for disaster longer term.....mgmt sucks!!!!!!!"
I bought some of my stock in the high $60’s in October. Oil ain’t dead. Ca Ching!!!!
This will go back to 120s when oil rises
Reports of new worse strain of covid out there be aware $xom $cvx
Warren will likely sell this week. But he won't tell you until next quarter.
"Throughout the driving season, oil inventories fell. Now the driving season is over, inventories continue to fall. ""Smart Money,"" downgraded this stock today. They see what is coming and want the stock down so they can buy it at a discount."
"With oil this strong, CVX lagging. Should see stronger move upward soon."
recent low 76.00......lets see
The new reality is the Federal Government want's to put he oil out of business over the next four years. Not good.
buy back in at 30 sell
CVX back to 90
Is 35 really their PE ratio. None of the other oil majors are above single digits. Wondering if it was a mistake.
The big are still hiding in this one ...just wait its coming
there will be another leg down after election 62 bottom will come
How low will CVX go when they cut the Divi? 50?
Why wouldnt chevron buy apache with their lunch money...they have massive holdings in the permian and the gulf and it its far less of a price than anadarko
Crude oil continues to fall 50 49 48 47 now 46 !cvx is overpriced and needs to correct for reality !
All oil stocks stink.
"Does anyone feel like I do, that Chevron could become a White Knight in a hostile takeover of Oxy????"
Buy the DIPs CVX is a winner
$73 after surprise earnings beat
Drone attacks on Aramco pumping stations after attacks on tankers two days ago...oil spiking up...
What happened to the forum??
ev is a good thing. But oil will recover way before that happens
I THINK THE HEDGE FUNDS DON'T WANT US OIL PRODUCERS TO SURVIVE AND SAUDI'S TO RULE WORLD MARKET?... THE REASON TO SHORT!!
"It’s time to get the deal of a lifetime, it’s down to “pocket change” compared to when it outbid cvx for Anadarko. Now cvx could get both for relatively small money."
The new tobacco is new a downward spiral.
"For all you enviro group supports, if you don't like the use of energy you can.1) Sell your car and ride a bike.2) Disconnect all the power for your house .3) Disconnect the gas for your house so you don't have heat of Air con. Be reasonable already, a transition to green energy will take decades not years. I hope the price of Oil goes to $100and above. .If oil above 100/ Barrel and these large energy companies would then have the cash to invest in green energy. Keep oil high and then watch the money pour into the green sector. It is simple math. Good luck to all."
"The stock mkt and oil stocks are way too high compared to where the economy, transportation and air travel is at. FED pumped the stock mkt with monopoly money and it's gotten ahead of itself. Wait for CVX, RDS-A/B etc to get back down something reasonable before buying. No ""V"" here, but long ""U"" recovery. Just be patient. Not shorting, just keeping some dry powder for a real recovery. GLTA"
I was wondering why this idiotic real estate purchase was put into play. Then I see Pat Yarrington retired at the beginning of the month. It all makes sense now. She should have been CEO. Look like a bunch of yahoos are driving the bus now. My days as a CVX sharholder are numbered.
A little perplexed as to why $CVX is in rally mode when oil still languishes in the low $20's. Did they magically bring their cost per bbl down to $10-15? I don't know this seems like a suckers rally.
I can't believe Chevron purchased NBL. Fortunately they are large enough to cover the mistake.
CVX is going lower for longer!
$130 on Mondayhttps://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/14/saudi-arabia-is-shutting-down-half-of-its-oil-production-after-drone-attack-wsj-says.html
Shouldn't oil be rallying in light of new sanctions imposed on Iran? Also didn't inventories indicate less glut than expected? What am I missing here?
"does anyone really think that the div is safe ??/ about $9 billion / yr paid out ... it's sexy , but i will pass for the time being ..g"
Everyday RED
Why does chevron outperform Exxon every time
"GET YOUR CASH READY,,,,,CLOSE...81.00.........82.00"
Thanks Pfizer! Let's save the world and make some money!
I smell $120
Anyone else notice that every Yahoo upgrade requires more clicks to get what you want than the old way?
bought at 100 so looking good plus decent dividend
Deciding to take profits if I can on some of my shares. where will this go? when will it return?
Oil is down to $11 so people are rushing to buy oil stocks. Wow! Just think how high this will shoot when oil goes negative again.
"Friends, today we sail passed $80/share once again. It will be a pivotal moment for us share holders. It is in times like these that we define ourselves as traders. Buy CVX or you will be slapping yourself in the face 4 weeks from now."

"I've wondered for some time, why Chevron continues to leave their world headquarters in California. Sure, I get that the executives love living in the wine country and can afford it, but for the rest of the working schlubs, California has become increasingly a difficult place to live and raise a family. Now we have news that several municipalities in California are suing Chevron and others for knowingly damaging the environment. They are seeking Billions in damages and hundreds of millions in ongoing penalties and taxes for global warming mitigation. As a shareholder, I have to ask the Executive Committee if they truly have the best interests of the shareholders in mind in deciding to stay in California. This current suit is little more than a mafia style shakedown. Time to leave California - divest or sell the refineries (or move them) and come to a state that appreciates the hundreds of millions in taxes and thousands of high paying jobs that Chevron provides."
up 2% in afterhrs markets up big tomorrow!
"Not too bad especially considering the elitists in control whipped out the Corona Con Card to tank the market all week heading into an election that they still expect to steal. Sorry, not happening."

"Aloha! I never heard of a Greenie environment group ever mention ""ROI""! I am not sure they know what it is! I ask this ... If CVX added 100% more solar and wind power to its exiting renewables what is the ROI? Is it one less cat 4 hurricane in 2021? Is it three less fires in California in 2022? Is it 25% more Arctic ice by 2022? Quantify it! If you cannot quantify it then it's meaningless and when something becomes meaningless then you know it is political because all things Green politics is meaningless. Especially when they speak of a 2030 ROI! After ERCOT budgeted 300% more for solar and wind and cut nat gas and coal by 50% Houston had $1bil in property damage and medical costs and 60 who died from freezing in the most oil rich state in the USA! I quantified it for the Greens! Now that's politics ... 1000%!!!"
I HAVE A BUY IN AT 103.75
"Given the recent price action, I’m going to guess the earnings ain’t going to be good on Friday"
Looks like they increased the dividend! Thank you CVX!
The communists are coming for your wealth....and it's too late to change your vote. You are complicit in the fall of the USA and deserve to suffer.
A trump loss will send this to$20
PLEEEASSSEEE BREAK $94 TODAY!!! CVX MAKE US SOME DAMN MONEY ALREADY!!!!!!!!!!!
why was cvx down today?
How exactly is the drop in oil driving the market DOWN today?
I will buy CVX for 33-35. A turmoil is not over.
Is it too late to start a position in energy (specifically CVX)?
"Hey $TSLA $XOM $CVX $XLE $OXY & $GME investors. Think about this when you’re buying your stocks....Let’s get something straight, a virus has not re-engineered the entire energy base of the world. It just hasn’t. To say otherwise is unfactual.Oil and gas are entering a new secular bull market...maybe their final one due to the green revolution, but it will be at least 10-15 years of very high priced oil and gas before the decline begins. You can expect $75-$150 oil from 2023-2035 due to regulators pushing oil out of the economy. “Old school” dinosaurs like XOM and CVX will reap huge benefits in positive cash flow and will transition to green to lead the market. They have the engineering expertise and the capital to make it happen.It’s insane to think that oil and gas are dead. They are not dead yet. It’s a business cycle. It happens."

"Hi! If CVX falling to 95USD, I'd like to buy it. Any oppinion?"
Oil spill at Chevron Richmond refinery!!
I was of course talking about MARATHON OIL.

SQM is doubling production in '21!
"Bp take over by exxon rumor, get in some while still low.Every rumor has elements of truth."
Soooooo refreshing. MUTFESTED all stock market bubble and doom and gloom naysayers. I feel so good.
"Oil majors (CVX & XOM) are moving north:-) Can't wait for tomorrows OPEC+ meeting and a decent spike in oil prices..................... Reopening the economy after Covid-19 will require massive increase in air travel, road travel, manufacturing, heating and and and..................."

It looks like Cramer called the bottom in the oil stocks by telling his uneducated followers to sell the oils....By 2030 there will be less than 19 MILLION electric cars on the road but right now there are 1.4 BILLION gasoline powered cars and millions of gasoline powered planes trains trucks and boats....Oil will be in demand for another 100 years......jmho
Who needs gas with lockdowns everywhere and no one going to work.
oil going higher.
Oil is black gold for a other - 100-years
Always nice to have one red holding on such a green day. For sake of humility.
