Recent headlines and conversations for UA
Why wasn't this disclosed by management a long time ago? Not exactly a trust builder.
I'll admit...Having Tencent land that deal with the MLB will help UA grow their brand in China. Good win for UA today.

"how can they repay their dept, if they do not sell anything anymore? burnrate is high.."
WoW you see how Sketchers is going higher on great earnings UA is next.$25 on Deck WE KNOW
"This is an extremely expensive company even at 15/share, trading at a very high multiple. If I were you, I would drop this stock immediately, and would invest in Capri instead. Capri in the contrary is as big as UA in terms of sales, it is more diversified, it is extremely profitable and.... it is trading at a very low P/E multiple"
Sometimes we can OVER Value a pair of shoes. Under wAre is a struggling company that overpays kids to put a ball through the hoop. The days of sneaker wars are over and the days of walking into a sporting goods store are over because there aren't any such stores.
Big news coming soon!!!!

GOOD NEWS TODAY 21 -22 SOON
Help me to figure DIS stock out every armor store. I go to always busy. What's up with this company?
Here is the resistance I mentioned before. We need to hold and break through this level for the next jump upwards.
"Chances are good here at this level.. 70 % off high , negativity all price in .. Easy 25 by June.. Booooom!!! Time to push this up !!"
"if you're an under armour fan, you buy their sports garment, you watch the other people at the gym, basketball court, football field or simply look around you, you'll see how much this brand is expanding. this analyst get paid to confuse the least informed, do your own assignment, or simply see how much nike is spending to undervalue UA. keep your money in, don't be a fool, takes time to go back up"
just mute 4mvp
"Shares of Under Armour fell 3.7 percent Tuesday after one Wall Street firm downgraded the athletic clothing maker to negative.Despite a 30 percent rally in the past eight weeks, Under Armour will reverse course and lose all of those gains in the next year, according to Susquehanna Financial Group.""Sell Under Armour. The Under Armour brand remains at risk,"" analyst Sam Poser warned in a note to clients. ""Given poor brand distribution decisions, we believe Under Armour risks are becoming more like Reebok than Nike. … There is no fundamental recovery in sight.""This guy is broke"
Glad I sold UA at over $100/sh........I thought its technology was found wanting
another upgrade from analyst evercore partners on 11th from equal weight to over weight
"Under Armour credit cut to ""JUNK"" Status.Just like the stock price.KEVIN PLANK - PLEASE RESIGN. YOU ARE A FAILURE. YOU HAVE FAILED THIS COMPANY. ALL CAN SEE THAT.CAN YOU?????"
"where do you people get your information from, mergers?, being bought?"
I can remember a very young company by the name of Apple computer that stayed between 14 and 17 bucks a share for quite some time. reminds me of a mountain Powerhouse Sporting Good Company named Under Armour that's going to knock the socks off the other companies. those basketball shoes and that baseball contract are pure gold for the company! you better hang on Christmas is coming ;0)
It's a BEAR TRAP!
Whose dumping AH
"Are you kidding me? I finally decide to buy two weeks ago thinking the worst is over and now I learn they're losing their MLB contract! That's a really big deal, if you ask me. I'm selling.https://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2018/05/24/Marketing-and-Sponsorship/MLB-Nike.aspx"
results are good
"with emerging market currency collapse, how will Under Armour's earning impact for the next quarter? UA showed great growth in global markets."
What does that have to do with UA becoming profitable?
Huge beat!
Kohls announces 7% sales increase during Holiday period. Maybe a positive sign for UA beating Q4 expectations.
Motley fool just lambasted this stock again. their negative feedback just ignites this stocks' fire within. looking for a good push in the green again today. glta longs
"Everything is coming up Green today except for reliable UAA. Well, let it drop back to the 12's, I'll buy some more and let it run back up to the 15's, then sell. I keep a core amount for long term, just trade a small amount to make the money I am down on back gradually, that way my UAA is profit going forward."
UAA is down -4.96% to 18.98
UA reached an all time low at 8.19
This looks so very cheap. But could always go lower. I cant stay away completely.
"Zachs......Is The End Near, for UA ?? Wow"
"Insider selling to be investigated:Plank last sold Under Armour shares amounting to 1.05 million in a series of transactions from Apr. 21 to Apr. 29 last year. The sales were well-timed. Jut six months later,Under Armour's red-hot growth came to a screeching halt in the third quarter amid a freshwave of department store closures and the bankruptcy of The Sports Authority. In effect,those harsh new realities removed vital places for Under Armour to hawk compression shirtsand joggers and led to a groundswell of discounted inventory at off-price channels such asTJX Companies (TJX) . Under Armour's lackluster third quarter along with a major long-termprofit warning sent shares plunging by over 20% on Oct. 25."
See you after lunch.. Be ready to ride up to the sky....BUY now or you will regret
have you seen this http://dailyalerts.zohosites.com/ .
"They've been cooking the books for years. Stashing inventory at distant warehouses using a shell company and counting the unsold inventory as sales. It's about time the SEC woke up and did something. Stick a fork in this, it's going south."
UA getting sued how can this be good news. We just checking this one out. Why are you people wasting your $$ in this stock. It is over stick a fork in it and flick it away...
Thank you for this short Mr. Plank. You’ve made me a happy man
Why is this dropping after a great 1Q and upgrades?
Spitting on Americans and America is not such a good idea as UA and Nike are learning. When Planck trashed Trump he trashed his own company imo. Bad move.
Pay attention to Nike's earnings report today. UA stock goes down every time Nike has weak sales revenues in North America.
"I told you to unload while you still can in the $19.'s,now I'm telling you to unload in the $18.'s before their gone too!"
Capitalism is the worst thing that happened to mankind
going in on underarmor moved my position from Nike. should short Nike.
Hey guys what's up with UA sudden plunge this morning?
UAA is down 4.90% to 23.27
"I havent seen a better buying opportunity like this in over 20 years of investing. Its simple, if NKE is worth $87 Billion (mkt cap) do you really belive UAA is only worth $7 Billion (mkt cap)? Lets just assume UAA is only worth 25% of NKE. That puts a valuation of $22Billion on UAA which places the value around triple the current value. Do NOT over think this! Grand Slam if ive ever seen one!"
UA is strong brand
Joke street
Company needs to figure out a way to drastically grow their sneakers sales in the us...nike has over 50 percent from footwear.
Guys UA Is only $4.42 worth. Don’t buy UA
"Under Armour management, I stop by about every six months with idea for you to fix company but your ceo does not get the message.Your dry shorts, with the deep pockets and most lightest best looking shorts for what about 35. your number one on those, long and baggy to the knees.Your socks and the shirts that go with the shorts, everything is just ok.Ok now what you need, sell shoes and they must specify the weight by website, stick to about 7 8 or 9 ounce shoes, running shoes, walking shoes but go even softer than boost 20's. Nike claims more bost or same as adidas but so far not close. Until you do this you will never catch nike. I worked for pepsi at 20 to 23, from 2000 to 2020 pepsi was less than half the shelf space and less than half the market cap. Now 20 yrs later they are equal to them and they could have done it sooner. They needed to put out a just pepsi energy drink, not thick, just extra caffeine, they needed to invent new flavors or by them, put 2 liter bottles of pink lemonade in every grocery store, strawberry lime, and berry lemonade, a cola flavor like the old jolt flavor but they just wanted to do same old, same old, like you. I'll be back in 6 months when your 5 or 6 a share or less because your shoes have always sucked. buy wtrh you want to make money, not this stock for future bagholders."
Good bounce.
Seriously has this stock been down everyday for 2 weeks?
$5SP OCT PUTS ARE AT $0.07!!
Why did UA just fall by 15%??
"I won’t buy anything but tech, look at pins, 40% pop, would been 10k payday for me"
DKS just threw Under Armour under the bus today. They blamed them for the short fall in earnings today. Not good!!
like I said month ago this company going to bought out ..I think by Amazon ... going up b/c speculation on earning from Christmas or whisper word on floor being hostel take over ..we will see
Nice work Kev. You managed to shave another 5% off the stock with that announcement. As shareholders we have to go to bed every night hoping you don't say something stupid the next morning. For God's sake shut up and get a better PR team.
Let me make this real simple ..... UA Shirt $59 .... Champion Shirt $19 ..... Target Shirt $14 The best part .... The Champion and Target Shirt have better quality and fit than UA. ... That's all !
I think UA would do best to stay out of politics and keep partnering with celebrities
Everyone needs to remember MLB contract More colleges coming on and it's football season . If this is not a buy then we all should not invest in the market. For sure this stock based on numbers is 20 dollar stock. I'm going in big and holding
which is a better buy UAA or UA
"Since UA has a newfound dependence on foreign sales, how are they going to pay for all the new tariffs that Europe announced this afternoon. How are Europeans going to pay for their products. Face it longs, you are screwed."
dead cat bounces?
Don't see this really doing much damage. No one really cares anymore it's the new normal
should get a good spike tomorrow with Zion blowing out his Nike on the court with cameras on him.hhaahahahahahhhh
Sam Poser tracks shoe and sports stores? He should be covering fast food stocks as he looks to fit that role well.
Sell off for tax write off. Pretty sad when a stock goes there!!!
UA is up 18.68% to $19.95
"I spoke to my financial advisor yesterday. He said ... ""While you are waiting for Under Armour to rebound over the next few years, why not buy a high yielding consumer discreationary(COH) that is already in it's upswing.""https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/COH?p=COH"
Professionals buy at $6 and sell at $6.25 amateurs buy at $6 and want to sell at $20 and end up selling at $5 don’t be so greedy hello
I'm glad to see alot of people will no longer support Under Armour. It's overpriced anyway.
"Far as I see it, there's no reason for the sudden downturn other than profit grabbing and a known shorting opportunity following the just as sudden upturn. Fundamentals and market opportunities for this stock are plenty strong, and there is zero denying it's been oversold over the past few months. I could've taken my 15% profit and ran, but I see this stock easily hitting $25 by year's end - ESPECIALLY after next quarter earnings and seeing the uptick in shoe sales after the company's recent arrangements and efforts to globalize take effect. Has everyone NOT been seeing UA all over the world of sports lately???I'm still in the black on this but if this drops past $19 I'm just going to back the truck up, as they say, and do some more loading. GLTA longs."
"It’s going up and nothing can stop it, Nike is finished"
Take your Profits it was a nice day yesterday dont be greedy!!
Timber!!!!
Hahahah - Walmart puts UA 25% on sale so they are slashing the prices. Do you not understand how retail works? Just because Walmart put the clothing 25% off doesn't mean the stock price is going to drop 25% again.
All of Nike's stores are now open again in China and South Korea. 1.35 million shares traded yesterday in the dark pool exchanges.
Nobody sees the amount of debt UAA carries on their balance sheet now? How margins have shrunk? It doesn’t matter if you’re sold out of some of your product if at the end you have little to no profit on them.
https://investorplace.com/2018/03/under-armour-stock-9-foot-pole/#.WqArsTZlCUA
Lol UA is over give it up. This will never beat Nike
"Ppl, all I know, is that I got burnt bad, twice on UA, when they kept posting how good they thought it was going to do, they beat estimates and still went down after. I’ll take my money now, before it happens again, and you should too, can’t lose taking any profit!!"
well no kidding duh... you know anyone wearing this garbagr besides Curry and The Rock? lol
Hedgies knocking it down again?
UA is assumed to go under at this price ... hope not
just got in at 15.88. How low will this go before a surge
That's part of the problem. They keep giving them away.
Goldman Sach upgraded UAA to 28 bucks..
So 5 years ago this had a $90 billion market cap?
Big difference between buying when other are fearful and buying when decline is justified! Justice will be served as UA will continue it's slide after relief rally!
Under Armour will fill the Gap to 28 bucks before the month is over. just my opinion and advice to the nieve shorts. I'm holding 80 call contracts that expire on different months through Jan. 2020.
13.00 in a month I have no holdings and don't plan to buy.
Lyon and Saini also cut their price target to $20 from $44! That's generous as Piper Jaffrey has the Price Target @ $17. So your buying @ $19. for a $1. ROI?
UA is a takeover target kss or target will have a bidding war
shorts be careful.. It could fly to 25 today itself.I doubt though but hopefully see close around 24.529 in 4 weeks is doable. IMO
UA is down -5.03% to 18.32
"I think UAA is due for a pullback. What are your thoughts? check out awe-someSTOCKS, its a pretty reliable service. of course you have to do your own due diligence, but they generally point you in the right direction."
Looking like a dead cat bounce early.
Y down 7% in premarket?
This stock was $41/$42 bucks just in the last couple of years. Plank screwed investors big time. Apologies are in order to anyone still drowning in this big loser.
"Pe 55, no thanks!"
Hope all of you pessimistic wannabe analysts sold yesterday.
"Wherever I go, Gym, schools, shopping I see the Under Armour brand. I think that they'll figure it out...How to market the brand better. JMHO"
this is much like LL back a few years ago. sell it here and wait
Who will buy UA? adidas?
I think UA will get alot of attention soon. They have the 10 year contract to outfit the MLB in 2019. Their cleats were prominent at the Superbowl. Their Phantom running shoes are selling well and Jeffries took notice. Hopefully they had a strong holiday season. KSS had strong holiday sales. I'm sure much of that was due to UA in their stores.
This is as big as when Steve Ballmer resigned as Microsoft's CEO!Hopefully we'll get the same results with UA's stock price!
Nba and nfl need to take civics class. They must be the dumbest sob on the planet
Snap will be going higher now and so is UAA. UAA recent stock movement just confirmed the uptrend with the decline couple days and big bounce the day after.
"Wife and some of her walking friends have went HOVR. These women walk religiously twice a day. They swear they will never walk in anything else. UA has made some mistakes, but I really do think they got it right with these HOVRs."
Under Armour has repositioned itself and will have a awesome quarter as more States open up under $20 is a gift you should take advantage of. This has much more to run the estimates are to low WE KNOW
Upgrade Today up 23
http://www.businessinsider.com/teens-say-under-armour-isnt-cool-2018-4
Who says UAA isn't poised for potentially massive upward movement? have you guys heard of awesom-eSTOCKS. i started receiving their allerts and so far i am happy.
Kevin needs to walk the Plank !!!
This has to be the worst POS stock in the entire universe.How many out there are bagholders on this POS like me? How can we get Kevin Plank fired? That POS is the reason why this POS stock is down so much.Kevin Plank - one message for you if you are reading this message board - you are a POS.
I’m holding this stock since it first IPO in 2015
"Under armor using augmented reality to market their brand would be a gamechanger imo...IPNFF stock is up 75% today while the market bleeds, this company pushing AR and their imaginear website looks like the future is here"
Can UA become profitable within the next 16-24 months? Does an investor here know?
SEC Says that UA Illegally put themselves in a more favorable position
https://finance.yahoo.com/video/retail-analyst-under-armour-expect-172800209.html
"Come on UA, Let's crush the shorts like NFLX did back in 2012 after a gigantic drop in 2011."
102mln followers and not one item sold out? Phenomenal isnt it?
This stock is going to jump a few dollars in the next week. New price rating of 28 and the shoes are hot hot hot. Everyone should be all in.
like I have always said ..it all about emotion...not hard figures ...sounds like vraiphil needs to invest in junk stores
Is it $100 yet?
24.5-25 would be nice... TODAYI'm running out of selling my 22.5 call(s) and have just few left
Are you longs adding more here? Just wondering how much pain you want to inflict on yourself! $15.'s Short Short Short!
uaa is down 3% other retail stock 5 to 15 percent
"I'm glad I sold my UA-C shares instantly and bought regular UA shares. I am not quite sure why there is such a disparity between the two types of shares prices but my reasoning was that these are the shares that Planck would manipulate for various corporate purposes, while he would not mess with the regular shares that give him control of the company. I think this turned out to be the case.T3"
Don't sell ... shorts trapped
One can only hope it stops at $25/share. Anyone see it going lower?
Revenue falls. But buy because of accounting gimmicks. LOL. Bagholders Paradise.
#$%$ after-hours down 4 percent????????
UA proving it is a pos on a day by day basis. CEO needs to step down.
After investors take in everything and reset their outlook Under Armour is going sky high. Seriously under valued here.
Why I invested in UA? Schools will re-open soon all over USA and the World - Exercise is a new life style - Sports will fully start again - Quality and designs are great - Summer will spike sales - Best stock price compared with competitors.....I think this company has potential. Bought and holding!!!
SELL SELL SELL :)
Just as I sold yesterday.
next week over 20
"RUN , don't walk from this flawed, failed, fraud of a company. Just sell and don't look back, chalk it up to another loss.Please, everyone,,, sell now and forget about this troubled clothing company. The Trump import tax initiative will force it into bankruptcy. I am short UA and have lots in puts... so if it continues down, I can pay-off my $41,000.00 swimming pool!"
Is anybody taking part of the class action lawsuit against UAA & UA?
In at $18. Will it ever get back to that or should I just take the loss and move on?Thoughts ? Thanks in advance.
Under Armour is up 5.33% to 19.17
"I only subscribe to a few sites, but ULTIMATSTOKCALERTS is one of them. very good trade suggestions. ."
Glad I sold this at $98.50.....I thought it was in trouble
Every dad I know got UA shirts for Father's Day. What is wrong with this stock?
Who buys this brand in 2020
For all the people hereThis will be the big windfall soon
"Wish UAA would announce a stock but back. But then again, Kevin Plank is now over his head running this company."
Najarian sleazebag brothers touting on CNBC
Why up .45 after hours? Wait until Golden State wins the title this stock will pop
another day on the same pattern. Opening bell buyers on lighter overall daily volume levels bid it up on some beliefs of greatness in earnings ahead that is waiting to be taken back by afternoon. US continues to dredge along the bottom of the ramp price range and even on Christmas ahead and $30 targets and an idiotic CEO call for strong international growth where the globe is tanking. Will today be the same as all other days by closing bell?
John - how much did you lose with this stock? You have spent several months bashing it. What happened?
this board is so comical ! first of all why dog a stock if you bought it in the first place .. Really geeeze ! everyone talks about profit /loss etc ..CMon Mo's Mo's ..the market reacts on news .. upgrade and down grade ..no one gives a dam about profit and loss ..I'm in at 19 bucks and I'm not worrying at all b/c I think Amazon going to buy the company or Addidas maybe LuLumon ... remember when Netflix fell to 88 bucks from a 110 b/c they missed the market expectations..the market simply reacted on a expected number WAKE Up ..we call it news !! now Netflix is over 250 the redeemed themselves and UA will do the same !! be patient everyone..blast off is in the future
Absolutely by far the worse interview a CEO has ever done on Cramer. Scars are cool??? Only reason UA has scars is because Spanky decided to include politics with business...
Overreaction from algo traders.
18.6-19.2 close today possible. IMO
Look at my comments from a couple of days ago. I could sense this was coming. This is only the first of many upgrades to come. The time to buy more is NOW. Going much higher from here.
"Don?t be fooooooooooled by big money and all these fake articles. Just trying to make everyone sell and lose money, don?t be so emotional when trading stocks the bottom line is that UA is a great company and product with criminals always saying #$%$ about it. This will be a good future investment."
Ua we are going to finish the year strong means- q3 is horrible but what else can we say
"Thanks UAA!!! Added also CNAT, 300% upside based on the average analyst's Price Target on Yahoo Finance, CNAT reporting deadly Cirrhosis Phase 2b/3 results """"any day"" NO FDA approved treatment. $DRYS active today too"
Local Marshall's received very large shipment of closeout UA sneakers. Appear to be the dark color palettes that were shipped to all of the Kohls in the fall. In the last 6 months UA and Nike seem to have the most real close out inventory of athletic footwear dumped at discount retailers.
investorplace and Canaccord Genuity (Camilo?) these two sources should be banned by yahoo
"Not 1 insider buy, not even at levels. That tells you something. Are people not wearing UA anymore? Makes no sense on why we are getting punished. Meanwhile all these stocks that got hit even after earnings warning continue to go up. Just frustrating."
2 upgrades this month and it still sluggish...WTH???
Ua is growing fast in europe...time will tell if it can overcome the stagnation in the states
Can somebody tell me if UA and UAA combined market cap is around 7 or 14B? I don't understand the two trading symbols. I know one has voting rights and the other doesn't.
"Curry and Copeland don't need a job in Maryland, but the people who live here do. Mr. Plank, keep up the good work for Maryland and let Curry and his tude take a hike in somebody else's shoes."
"This is a screaming buy and hold IMHO.With high institutional ownership, more are vert likely going to increase their holdings this week.Insiders also hold 15.5% per yahoo.Short shares decreased by 2 mil last month.Company has $200+ mil free cash, I would bet on a buyback of shares soon.Looking ahead, Under Armour said it expects to earn between 19 cents and 22 cents a share for the fourth quarter, up from its previous outlook between 16 cents and 19 cents. Lanceman2468"
That yahoo finance news video on UA earnings hurts my head... John and the women in that clip would get alone well
Should I buy this or..?
I look around and see more people wearing UA gear versus Nike. This leads me to believe this stock has to move up again.
Keeeeeeep holdinggggg. We are Spartaaaaa
UA seems like dead meat. Going nowhere and starting to stink.
Think a lot of people here are going to be surprised after earnings...
Buy low! Do not forget that mantra no matter what analysts say. Free advice is not really free!
"Look...$UA is growing like crazy and analysts can't seem to get it. While the stock goes down slightly, I'm banking with this fitness stock right now: http://finance.yahoo.com/news/exolifestyle-inc-pleased-announce-rogue-113000593.html So far I'm looking at it for a short term flip but could have no problem holding some if they keep putting out news like this"
"This guy is obviously being paid to downgrade this stock and pressure the share price down. I listened to his Nov 7 analysis when bumped the share price up from $11 to $15. He did not give a good reason why the share price should be lifted $4 other than that is looks like a bottom and based on the way the business was going that it justifies the $15 share price. Now, 2 months later, he downgrades the stock to a sell and says that it should be at $11. His reason is that UA is selling to discounter like Kohls and DWS, and its branding is staying with the athletic and not expanding towards leisure. So in essence, he is saying that nothing's changed in the last 2 months since his upgrade. He's all about negative now, even confirming that the PE is too high. In his opinion, UA is doing everything wrong now."
increasing sales and improving margins. Buying opportunity.
They need to focus on clothing and walking shoes ...get out of athletic shoes
i think it has potential to reach $45
What people fail to realize is that you can love a company but hate the stock price. This is still overvalued.
We need Brady back on the team
Looks bottomy to me. I have started to pick in here. It may take some time but I think they will rebound some
"I think its unbelievable the hovr got sold out instantly and the curry 4 in a few colors. The sales are better than kdx shoes. 2/3 of nikes revenue comes from their shoe business, under armour needs to work on this. Their designs are ugly, hovr is ok but in general ugly shoes and still they sell what is unbelievable."
Dead Cat Bounce! That's All!
Look...UAA's PEG is still 8. This thing is WAYYYYY overvalued.
"Be and industry leader, only print shoe sizes in US sizing. 1 world 1 people 1 system, respect."
still a buy at this price...
in 17.88 out 18.44 ... not bad - now average price is lowered
Its time to bring in Curry Shoes Advertisement while Golden states still plays at the Finals...
"More and more investors are now becoming Day traders because companies like Under Armour have no loyalty to investors, and by nature, Day traders have no loyalty to the companies they trade...me included. I invest in real estate, but I trade stocks. Under Armour executives still get paid full salaries while they run the company into the ground...so the incentive to care about shareholders is tempered by this fact. In 2017 and on, buying and holding stock is a sucker's game. Trade Under Armour Short or Long, but don't invest in them unless you want to lose money."
I want this thing to go back up some tomorrow so I can sell and move on. I'm already losing with Macy's big time. Dont need this to fail too.
averaging down on UA worked
OUCH!!
"Earnings coming out will be interesting to watch. The mask is a $20m program at best, but it is additive. Massive reduction in investment (people, marketing, partnerships, infrastructure) will help bottom line, but my guess is top line will be challenged. Very little energy to drive the top of the funnel. Plus, Piper Jaffrey survey wasn't helpful either..Teens apparel spend down 11% and footwear spend 6% in that group."
This year there will be a lot of retailers etc. going bankrutpcy imho
This stock is under a short attack.
Large block trades (buys) coming through this morning.
"They're changing UA-C to UA to try to prop up demand for the C shares. A shares to change to UAA. Kinda like Google, which made their original symbol GOOG class C, and a new symbol GOOGL as class A."
Bought at 15.01 today hope we've seen the bottom and it's on the up
I would like to know what UA did to the Motley Fools to #$%$ them off so bad they go out of their way to bash the UAA stock futures. They do their best to keep the stock prices down. They should be investigated by the SEC.
"As an investor, I am tired of seeing UAA on the wrong side of issues. Advertising on Hannity's show? Tisk, tisk."
Just noticed Under Armour is the #2 thing trending on Ebay right now. Curry?
"Beat or Miss ? Vote up if you think beat, down if you think miss (or Hardly meet)"
"great buy, read carefully the report, revenue decline just because they were forced to closed so many stores , once those stores reopen revenue claim back immediately one of the best risk awa\rd in the market today"
run.. junk
Going to 7
Remember only g-ays and school teachers where Under Armour.....
Kevin Plank should have shut his mouth and stayed out of Politics. He alienated the conservative base and the looney leftists all in 1 week. Meanwhile UAA pays millions to idiot athletes who seem to do nothing but alienate more people.
Wow
This company will be around for a long time. MLB is all in and the fact of the matter is they make a good product. Forget the daily scare tactics...buy and hold.
what has changed???
UA reached a 52 Week low at 12.72
i averaged down today on it ..
"I dun has been tellin everyone from hear to there to buy this dam stock at forty five. I dun tole them northurn aggressionisters to pay forty five and not a penny lesss, them dam fools. Fool me once and fool me twice and then fool me forty five times I dun was a teacher down here and now my students is all hanging around the Walmart parking lot looking for work or so they say. Alls I see is clouds of smoke and bunch of Under Wears hanging out of their pants. Oh lawd, I love money!!! Gimme Money!!! Make every dam thing in Bangle Desh!!!"
Pre market trending up. Why? Because they are eliminating workforce in their growing international market. That makes sense! When I want to grow I eliminate staff too.
Here comes the sell off. Sad.
$8 today!
Good luck to all longs. I've took a profit of 16%. Possibly should have waited a little longer but happy all the same. Bought opd. Good luck all
Watching this closely. I would have assumed that this stock would be stronger as people are buying ‘stay at home’ wear
"Being pumped, will tumble for lower entry."
Why such downfall? Earnings missed a bit with EPS even topping expectations... doesn’t make sense...
hahaha jon
They will have a great quarter
"No one knew how complicated this health care stuff is, I mean it's really, really complicated. Your president is a moron."
"Been a long time since I posted on a board but feel inclined to share a simple thought. Are you asking the right question before inititing a stock position long or short. The First question should always be when to buy or sell not so much what. I had no intention of buying under armour until yesterday.. felt and looked like blood on the street. Never intended to short oil but when it was over 100/ bbrrl and all the macro initiatives solar, wind, higher mandates on MPG on new vehicles, fracking etc... never expcted to buying corning years ago..but when it traded below book value under $10 and gorrilla glass emerging as standard I went long. Wait for extremes don't force anything."
"Funny how the government can go after Under armor for accounting, but can't look into Trump Businesses???????"
I just bought a pair of the new HOVR shoes. By far the best pair of athletic training shoes I haveever wore. The Nike shoes I have previously wore do not even come close in terms of quality and comfort. Hope this is just the beginning of great new products coming down the pipeline. Kudos to UA!
You shorties are cute...
16.5-16.8 today pop.. either ways; 16 is key support.
It will reach a new 52 week low tomorrow. Who knows after that.
UAA is up 5.49% to 25.19
Major drop today.
It all doesn't matter if the POS doesn't actually make money...
Under Armour reached a 52 Week low at 11.34
Shorted
The bus goes up the street...then down the street..up..then down
Got in @12....2018 will be epic for UA
Thought on buying this? Reading into initiating plans to save $600 million and basically rediscover their identity intrigues the hell out of me.. Yet they have fallen off some and basically became content when American football became a big player and that was enough.. I want to become a player in this and maybe double up but I dont know...
UA up for sale soon?
"Spieth, Curry, Brady, all of the MLB, half of the NCAA... UA is quietly all over all the major sports!"
Lower Costs = Increased ReturnLogical
EOS launch of the coin
"I don't get it, I see people wearing this EVERYWHERE."
this will be down tomorrow
i expect it dropping back to $9
Super oversold on 15 . Expecting big bounce or some news soon.Have been watching for this. Entry at $12.37 x 500 for bounce.Mental stop at $11.90-12.20. Same regurgitated garbage . Revenue is almost at Mkt cap. I expect a short squeeze. Nice play.
Don’t be sung the shorts need to cover today
See major upside or downside right after feed meeting around 2PM EST.
Under Armour no longer selling the UA Band? Probably a good move getting away from this business with fitbit already well established. Under Armour site shows none in stock and you can't even find it if you navigate the site. I picked up the UA band at Macy's. I figured it was worth a try for $85.00.
What a comeback today
Green
Jordan Spieth hasn’t been the same golfer since 2015 :(
"New to the site, and one of those who think more upside than downside from here, although needs a turn around. See like most these Yahoo sites, you have your resident troll (the one that always posts doom and gloom, but is never short).."
DKS destroys their firearms. UAA is next.
What’s the difference between UA and UAA tickers. YF says both are under armor?
almost impossible to hold 18 today... Oh well.
I have been waiting and waiting for this come on keep it up Uaa
bankruptcy coming
uaa down like the ravens ahaha
https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/02/05/what-im-watching-for-when-under-armour-reports-ear.aspx
"Nancy, did John force you to start defending him on this channel because he’s a fat loser. I take it your also a muffin top as well?"
My only concern is the rising inventory level
Upgrades coming?
blowout
UA is tanking again today more than it did yesterday. Michael Jordan never let his political views be known. He said both democrats and republicans purchase his shoes. UA CEO should take Michael's advice. If you own UA stock you better take your losses and get out.
Anybody want to short this to 30
Plank the buzz killer..
"Plank is quietly sinking millions of his ill-gotten gains into his real empire, a multi-billion dollar Real Estate venture.http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/blog/real-estate/2016/01/kevin-plank-port-covington-master-plan.html"
"I have recently started a long position here. All my son's pre-teen friends wear under armor and I think this represents a good opportunity when things get back to ""normal."" Nobody has been buying their kids clothes because everyone is home there is no school. I suspect when that changes there will be a significant positive change in sales. Willing to be proven wrong here, and I hear the concerns about management, but at the end of the day this is a very popular brand with younger generations which I think bodes well for the future. Also no sports is a major drag. I'm comfortable building a long term position around current levels. Good luck to all and my apologies to the currently suffering longs."
"Already factored in, down from here"
Ditch Curry who is not that good any more ...
crushed
only stock red in pre market
"They will not make money this quarter but still go up, it’s the best stock ever"
This is #$%$ they must be holding back the $20s till earnings look at HOG today and the only thing they are selling is Harley shirts.
down slow slow to 19.98 but up Quickly to 20.94 Tomorrow
"Yesterday, Under Armour (UAA) reported disappointing earnings and cut its revenue-growth forecast in half. That prompted seven analysts to cut its stock yesterday, including those at Susquehanna, Piper Jaffray, Raymond James, BofA Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo, B. Riley, and Credit Suisse. And the downgrades have continued today, with analysts at Evercore ISI, FBR, and Canaccord Genuity joining the downgrade party."
Why does John post nothing but nonsense then delete it?
Limped in just now
16% return on Friday glad I sold
"UA can’t get it in regular session, and they pump it in after hours...........whatever"
"Sam Poser is an overweight loser trying to give advice on fashion and athleisure. Now I can understand why he hates Under Armour so much, its because none of the Under Armour apparel sizes fit his #$%$"
Kids love UA and kids will push this stock up!
Plank's 'Pump and Dump' plan revealed ..... we were all duped by this crooked charlitan.http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/blog/real-estate/2016/01/kevin-plank-port-covington-master-plan.html
"Thunder I hear ya I lost over $70,000 on this just in the last year killed me so what can I do sold everything but just a little and praying that Adidas buys UA out or someone"
"This UAA has a very nice bottom if you use Technical Analyst. There is a nice island reversal in place (Bullish reversal). The rising 50 Day Moving Averages has just crossed through the falling 200 DMA (Another very Bullish indicator). All this occurring after a 3 year down cycle. Truly setup for May 1st. Any kind of positive news on May 1st, this stock could easily be back in the $20's.."
"The way this is going, any positives in the earnings report would be welcomed with a good increase."
I for one think this is a good entry level to purchase UA. it will climb back one to two dollars between now and the next earnings. ride the wave...
ANOTHER SHORTS PAY DAY
UA hasn’t even started international expansion. It’s still very early in it’s life cycle
UA reached a 52 Week low at 13.67
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!! bravo UA
Many things applicable to LULU in the article are also applicable to UA. Stay Away and Keep a Wary Eye! https://www.stockmetrix.net/blog/post/082718/lululemon-warning-signs-stretched-valuation?t=yfzhanb

Uh-oh. Wait till the truth comes out! LOL
Kevin .!..
U don't need to buy apple which is very hard to go up 4%. Just buy this stock and now is up 13%
"Now 12.75 on 26,600 shares. Panic is setting in."
Plank leaves economic council .... President Trump is not pleased ..... That loud thud sound you hear is the people at Tide Point jumping out of the windows as Kevin Plank seems to have become an overachiever in the arena of stupidity.SELL Now ..... Don't be left holding the bag .... That's all !!!
International growth should hold well for Under Armour which may move the stock higher when they report on the 26th
Someone need to buy out this company that knows how to market the brand internationally. CEOs are banking the money and not expanding.
there is only one thing gonna turn this ship around. this company has to make the tough choice and do the unthinkable. They must have their own distribution meaning control their own store front. You are at the mercy of whatever store they decide to go into. How many times will they make the same mistake
"Retail finally bounces back, will UA finally hit $45 now?"
"GREAT JOB UA,STAY LONG,LOOKING FOR $25.00 BY NEXT EARNING"
4 upgrades this year alone. Watch for a nice bump to the upside prior to ER next week. I'm predicting 28 by next Friday.
UA clothes are sitting in Macys for years ... how could it survive?
I just returned from the Mexican border even the migrants have UA gear on including sneakers. There is no escaping this brand its everywhere even at my local New York Sports Club.
"Do you think this thing is done selling? Showing us a buy signal now on UAA? Yo you should really check out https://awesomepickstoday1.blogspot.com/, they seem on point with their stocks."
"As a guy from Baltimore, you don’t see anyone without Under Armour on. You’ll be disowned for wearing the check symbol..."
I like to try to catch this falling knife. Anyone have a prediction for the bottom?
UA ludicrously oversold at this level. Time to BUY.
Look for $9 pps

#1 Shorted Stock! Now #1 Day Trading Stock! At least their #1 in something! Take any Profits into close!
Under Armour will have to sell their clothes at the Dollar Store soon. No one wants stuff from a company that hates Americans.
John your scare tatctics don't work... people like you make a poster child for prophlatic...
I want ua nba nfl to all go broke
I signed one of my first sales contracts at a club - customer wanted to go there....
oversold
"Watched PGA golf, Notre Dame football and major league baseball today. UA was everywhere."
Raised guidance for the whole year. That’s what I’m talking about. No other company has done that this year.
They are saying $8 is target price through 2018. Harsh.
UA is now ludicrously oversold. See you back @ 17+ soon. GLTA.
$23 wow high expectations there guy maybe $19.50 lol if it even goes up much but yea I believe it's turned it's way I bought at $13.50
"Just finished listening to fast talking saleman Kevin Plank on CNBC spin his way out of so many direct questions with questionable answers. My impression is:- If this guy was trying to sell me a car, I would run away.- If this guy was my doctor, I would get a second opinion- If this guy was my preacher, I would instead worship the devil instead.Kevin Plank, pure and simple, is a CON MAN. Just like our new President - Don the Con."
Anyone else feel ua has a debt level that is not too high
so why did this fall today?
Someone is really adamant to have this close below $18.50 on Friday
stockinvestus. fred. strong buy
under armour to buy Nike!
After 2 years nothing has happened aceept they just stole yoir shares
"One thing perplexing to me I was watching the US Track championships and I did not see one athlete wearing UA. I saw Nike, Adidas but no UA. Why is the focus so narrow, BBal for example for ""performance wear"" seems odd to me."
UA is going bald now..lol
"Relief Rally Over,hope ya took yer profits! So Far Steph Curry,Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson and Misty Copeland all speaking out against Kevin Plank: Under Armour’s Star Endorsers Are Coming Out Against the CEO’s Pro-Trump StatementsMisty Copeland, Stephen Curry and The Rock raise objections"
The Street can KMA
UA prediction by end of year??
They have already been cited for controlling parties and what the females look like and promoting adult entertainment at strip clubs and now a womanizing star football player gets caught on tape this is very bad PR they are going to lose a lot of what they've been trying to correct with the female crowd
"Traders fleeing to dividend safety stocks,all too familiar!"
$ 33 soon
"I think UA has always been a fad stock, and their best course of action is a sale to a competitor and a new CEO in the meantime. I think the firm overreached, and underdelivered. Time to shut the doors."
Z
I thought i would never say this but ua for the first time delivered a shoe that Has the right technologie and is commercial. If this can be the red thread designwise for future shoes this can all come from the ground after all.
"they will close the gap back to 14.00 after earnings or losses ,,,sell now"
Heard through the grapevine.....Adidas to purchase UA to compete for number 1. Nike number 2.
"funny,,,cnbc now brings on every bull on under Armour,,they covered their short and went long so its time to pump it up...LEARN TO TRADE IT ONLY"
Skechers surpasses Under Armour in Market Cap ...

Arrogant management. Lots of highly paid people who were praised for 20 straight quarters of 20% growth. Most are gone now after 3 years of market share losses and bad merchandising decisions.
Why’s down so much
UAA will buy FIT very soon. Watch ...Learn. Synergies are off the charts....
Shorts comments 
"This will go way below 12! Shittiest brand with no footwear, no one likes the brand. There is no identity of the brand, curry 5 does not sell at all. You can all believe what you want but fact is that it will go bankrupt, overseas sales are not like dor like all new doors so also fake"
Just past UA store in Sunrise FL and it was packed and everybody was buying. Very good sign of things to come.Stay the course. Go long and be rewarded.
"Few years ago I invested in Columbia (colm), Nike (nke), Lululemon (lulu) and Under Armour (UA )on the same day. My UA investment has not been positive but happy withe the other three. Will Under Armour ever recover!"
Good time to buy?
Project Rock releases tomorrow and it will be one of the most anticipated releases of the year for Under Armour. Keep a close eye on this new collection is selling on their website.
UA should drop to $13 again soon imho
Yup knew it poor positioning too much competition
"Now Plank has stepped down from Trump board, it's time for him to step down as UA CEO."
"Consumers are broke. They need that money for food, kids, school, mortgage, taxes, Obamacare, etc. I doubt they will be buying overpriced sports clothes."
"Had to much pain in this stock, thought I’d get back in when spiked but I’m no longer a believer here"
Finish Line stock is down 15% on weak results. That can't be good for UA.
"WHy do you guys want this to go up so fast? Bunch of Virgins I take it. I liked when I was buying 200.00 a month when in the teens. All you fools that want instant gratification will be burned one way or another. Then you can be a veteran and enjoy the slow ride of dollar cost average. Man its nice to be wise, just sucks death comes quicker"
UAA board makes the Trump administration look competent. Jesus!
"When UA sold Kohl's over weight middle age and old guys discovered the brand, it is no longer cool!"

"Stop judging this company by PE multiples. Market cap is reasonably close to yearly revenue!!! Read that again...Double chin red glasses dork analyst doesn't know a damn thing about performance. Analyzing bakeries and fast food, I would probably listen."
"UAA is attempting to hold on, but the last grip of earnings failed to support this stock. There doesn't appear to be any further catalyst up as earnings from retailers, closed for the last 2 months, will start to trickle in later this week. I believe that UAA is in the bulls eye for damage. It is a case study in the wrong place at the wrong time. Institutional holders will continue to dump shares going into earnings season. Tombstones are used in the industry. Start writing this one : )"
"A rally, then push to 12.65 or 11.60 before er"
"Smart move by UA to sever ties with MLB, boycotts coming..."
Wonder who paid Barrons to write that articlesays selloff is extreme....Whats extreme is managements unwillingness to comment on the matter and leaving retail in the dark...Whats extreme is Barron’s article and they do t know wth going on

Can anybody help should i sell my stock and accept the 2k loses?
"UA may delay opening new flagship store, now...because of whatever...? Adios."
Uh-Oh. The market is up and UAA is continuing to decline. Word must be leaking out about the quarter ending loss.
"A PE ratio of 91 and eps of $.19, this stock is way overvalued. You're better off with HBI at about the same price with a $.60 yearly dividend and a PE of about 10."
Under Armour is down 7.16% to 9.34
Plank took the money and bounced
Received my proxy yesterday. Voting for all but Kevin Plank......not that my measly few thousand shares will sway a vote.
"Another day.......another down red day for Under Armor. Are there any other kind of days for Under Armor but down days?Seriously, Under Armor stock would rise 20% in ONE DAY if Kevin Plank WERE FIRED. That is a fact. God.....how I wish I never bought this POS stock. It is by far the worst in my entire portfolio. To all those out there thinking about buying this POS......think again. The stock is a broken stock. The company is a broken company. The company is run by the WORST CEO in the fortune 500.UNDER ARMOR AND KEVIN PLANK - YOU SUCK SO DAMN BAD."
"$22.80 seems to be the new support. UAA needs to break above, and hold, above $24 for the next jump upwards. Adding more to my position."
5000 X 11.81 after hours buying. So much for gains on the opening.

UA is down -4.91% to 17.82
This is Under armours chance. Nike isn’t the only apparel company. My kids and I won’t be wearing Nike. I like UA.

"UAA will drop 90% in one day, just don't know day yet"
I mean they did spend time to develop a sweet mask. I’m impressed. I think I’ll pick up a few shares in a bet just because if they sell enough of them it could provide the cash flow and then change the outlook forever.
upgrade to $27 target today.it will be $100 before eoy
"Here is why i like Under Armour and why i put in my money for long.I really like the agility of the company in bringing new products to the market. This is critical in not only increasing the potential for new revenue streams, but also in making timely corrections to a buggy product release.I really like the mission of our CEO.I see Under Armour as next apple or next Amazon, that has taken the market by storm dismantling the existing leaders."
can we close close to 22 if not above today is the only question.It cold be profit taking day but hoping i'm wrong

Get ready for the to get super “cheap” 
Jobs numbers for past two months not good. layoff announcements growing.Slowdown for Oct and Nov in RETAIL sector as well - they should be hiring for Christmas season.Global growth data garage everywhere and you think UA survives where other retail names fail.The carnage in equity markets also worrying people. ]Good luck on your bullish thesis.Im staying short for 3rd trade and this one could fall back to the recent lows when retail data and earnings come in.Didn't #$%$ report sales of UA were weak when they reported last moment? Someone please correct anything here if you see it otherwise
This is a perfect penny stock.

Can we keep the stupid political comments off this board politics is a suckers game anyway for weak people with no life. $20s coming volume is picking up
I think the most positive thing about UA is how catchy and how rapidly they expand once they enter a new country or region. Buy and hold :)
"Seriously, any chance of Amazon buying Under Amour?"
muscle has lost all his money
right now this is a wonderful company at a fair price.
23.10-23.2 by close? possible

dropping to $9 is very possible
"Anyway, there are really only two kinds of stocks out there in this market, stocks that are overpriced but still hot, and stocks with either industry or company specific problems (GE, ANF, RIG, SNAP, JCP, etc.). UAA has problems and some past bad management, but my money is on them being repairable. Not all of these are. I wouldn't touch JCP for example. I like EXPR best in retail, think AEO is OK, but keeping UAA for a bit too."

22.5 July call dirt cheep compare to 20 - wow
I am praying  I bought 5x
Do you find it odd that Plank did not divulge this until after hours of the last trading day of the quarter? But then no one has any voting rights anyway. So what else would you expect?
By the way LULULEMON eat their lunch. Stay away from two U's today. UBER and UA.
Hurry and get to Toys R Us. You can get a good deal on the latest Curry 5 shoes there! HAHAHA
"Looks like the short seller hatchet job is well under way...negative articles, lawsuits, CNBC lambasting the company. Fact of the matter is this company's products make those from Nike and Adidas look like dollar store garbage. It won't last long at this price before somebody scoops it up. I have three teenagers and the only Nike product they will even consider is running shoes...they like some athletic shorts made by Adidas...but as far as things that make up their casual wardrobe like hoodies, polo shirts, t-shirts, quarter-zips, flip flops, jackets, hats, gloves...it's all Under Armour. My son is a big hunter and all of his new gear is Under Armour.They've obviously gotten out over their skis a little by expanding into some questionable product lines, but this product has become too pervasive for it to be ignored for long."
@ Abdul where you get that information? I thought it was on July 30th
yall make me laugh
UA: Can UA be the next target? EXPR is up so much.
UAA is down 8.35% to 10.43

What the difference between UAA and UA? I’m looking to invest. Thank you guys
Buyer at $21. Being patient
This brand needs some energy. Typical VF brand now.
pump and dump. don't forget. UA still have a lot of work to do. have your seen their stores and product line in the last couple of months. they are improving but will take time.
"Take a look a insider trading, Kevin, takes atleast 100 million dollars a year out of our pockets, every year. Buys shares for $0.00 and sells for what the market will bear. That is right off the top,out of shareholders pockets"
"Beat, but guidance soft. Lackluster response. Will close red today, I’m guessing."
who knows when does UA report and what is the expected number
Going to 20 after earnings.
Do you guys think its gonna fly past 20?
OK folks - I own too much of this dog - buy or sell today? O
On the way back to $15.............uugh
pump it to $24 to squeeze the edgy shorts
"Since every fat butt in the USA is wearing UA, shouldn't UA charge more for the xl-xxxxxl sizes, this will help revenue.."
It's a Buy at $14
What are the chances of UA getting sold??
UA reached an all time low at 6.72
The turnaround is real.
"I am long on UAA. I would give another 3-4 months to see the stock at 24-25 level. I like their new shoes, jackets and hoodies. They carry their brand"
"In scanning the carnage, I was surprised to see UA up today. I've said it before on this board...$5...and that is still expensive. What is worse is that the pandemic will actually mask how poorly lead this company is. Frisk and his clique at the top (old VF guys and a few UA holdovers) won't get it done...."
Where's the entry point? UA gonna test its lows? When will shorty start covering?
"I tell you one thing, my family is wearing UA while are home, and recreationally when things open up again.This is not a rare thing, many are doing so. Short time, will bring this up quickly. It's a buy."
I was just in BJ's ... They are selling UA Pants and Shirts at discount prices right next to many off brands .... The demise is complete. ..... Next Stop .... Ollie's ... Good Stuff Cheap !!!
"Would be very interesting to hear the earnings call, 1- to hearing how terrible it was. 2- if anyone asks them about the Wells Notice and what their reply to it would be.Either way they will miss earnings by a mile."
the mlb deal will be huge for ua. i hope it continues to drop so i can keep buying
UA is going away like the Starter Jacket.
upgrade
Citi Raises Target to $16 from $14. Rating stays at Hold into FY18. This gives the analyst multiple bites at the apple. Can drive trading and price higher with today's price target increase. Then drive higher again when the analyst raises the rating. Should be another good die.
Chart says no touch until closes above 17.25 - IMOLet's see if it continues to head lower - It's key level for sure
Finally upgraded to strong buy. Been holding 5k shares forever. Hopefully it finally pays off!
Lost 25% Market Cap in one day! Damn!
"Atleast one Analyst start BS talk about USA business. So let's review. we know it gone down 4% which is very small. Now Why it losing revenue.1.> UAA until recently mostly dependent on retailer to sell. They focus on building it and distributing to retail. Those bankrupcy in 2016-2017 remove lot of Retail channel. I think it benefit other because They can find Nike and Adidas in Stores like Jc Penny, Kohls, TJ Max, Barlington Factory and many other Discount stores so they aren't dependant on premium outlets like sports authority and benefit.Now Why I am confident, Even Overall Sell going down very slowly, Direct to Consumer increasing very very fast. This is better than anything. This mean 1.> They aren't as much dependant on retailer any more, 2.> People still want Under Armour if they find way to buy it. 3> Better margin on direct to consumer approach."
16.39 after hours YES SIR
Price is up down and up and down!
https://www.gq.com/story/how-puma-overtook-under-armour-in-the-sportswear-war
"Do you think, They may sell the company for better managements?"
UAA is up 9.49% to 9.00
"Kevin Plank just called Trump ""Passionate"" , The comments received criticism across social media from those who don't support Trump. Some activists are vowing to boycott Baltimore-based Under Armour ,Hmmmm how many athletes are from other countries that don't agree with Trump's new immigration policy,just sayin'"
What’s going on We should be over 25
UAA is down -6.98% to 16.52
How the Game is Played: So - the Analysts put estimates up high - higher than the company can achieve - they have their hedge fund clients buy in all the way up - then they have them sell long positions and take new short positions just before they pull the plug in a tough quarter - the company hits a bump in the road - analysts go way over the top in pounding it down and piling on - their hedge fund clients buy the stock up cheap - then they reset their models giving the company easy comps in the coming quarters to beat on the way back up in the coming quarters so their hedge fund clients can benefit as the stock moves higher - then they repeat the same cycle - over and over. Can't change the game but at least you don't have to sell at the lows or buy at the highs.
Bk soon by eoy
"The Pink Curry 4's that were released on Sunday, are now sold out!!! With 2 business days the entire stock of the shoe are sold out."
New Jersey Kids love Under Armour brand....it will go up tomorrow....:)
"Hmmm... the real question is why you frequent 3 different gyms? In my opinion, Nike has the leg up on sneakers and socks....hands down. Under Armour tees, sleeveless tees and workout shorts are head and shoulders above Nike. Under Armour stock is OVERSOLD. Get in now, if you are smart. Make some $$$ back from these loser shorts that wear Hanes brand tees with star wars graphics."
I am American and I stand with President TRUMP. All you Anti TRUMP folks have been very mislead. Your Teachers were simply trying to keep there jobs and pensions instead of Educate you. See the Welfare line for more information.
wow I see the p e is only 63 yeah here it says 90 what's the actual price to earnings guess the attorneys will have to figure it out I don't look too good
Sorry longs it’s time to sell. UA is out of business
The leftists must be stopped.
Stock price is where it was in 2011 . Your telling me that it's not more valuable in 2017 lol
I bought some shares this morning. this stock will recover in no time.
Best thing to do is put this one away for 2 years..be a 30 dollar stock
Yessssssa
Careful to all those considering buying under armor I wouldn’t personally touch it yet. Yahoo released an article on October 5 stating Under Armour stock rose 14.5% for no apparent reason in September￼. Wait for a dip and buy blow 10.5 of not lower. ￼￼looking for 9.50 or under personally.
don't buy into this stock until you see 4th quarter earnings.
I tried searching for 'HOVR' and got links to some under the desk leg stimulator device.?.
Might it triple? like GOOS
market goes up 250 points; We go up to 23 easy.Just the pullback needed before heading higher to 29
Time to buy some more
"Not saying this WILL happen, but Under Armour MIGHT get kicked out from the S&P 500 index.https://beatbillions.com/under-armour-beware-of-the-possibility-of-this-catastrophic-event/"
Bear trap. Market will tank tomorrow. Sell now
Does anyone have a sense for earnings next week? NA still a problem? Footwear? Effect of the cost savings measures?
I bet Mike and John are banging and telling each other how much UA is going to fall.
"No position, but at some point someone will buy this for the brand if the drop continues. Maybe PVH?"
Relief Rally to keep bag holders in check! Sneaky o' so Sneaky!
got in 16.57. lets se how it goes. stop lost 8%
"Shorting will continue next week and for weeks to come,far far from over folks!"
It's not too hard to build sales when you are selling product to 3rd party retailers opening new stores. But all that inventory can either be returned or marked down to the point that no once is making any money. Wake up!
Plank must’ve taken the JpMorgans out on the town to get the upgrade!!!!..... lol
"I was at a running event this weekend, and UA clothing was everywhere. Nike had some, but UA dominated. But at what cost. I can tell the number of units sold has increased but is it at a ""dumping"" price, or is it at a price where margins are acceptable."
"Chart points to Double-Step down to $14. ~ $15. range before shorting slows,expect pull back at close into $17.'s for first time,then $18.'s are history,last chance to sell at $18. and reinvest before all your capital is gone! AT&T still looking like a bargain after recent pullback with $45. $46. Price Target!"
Frisk wants to restructure back to being a performance brand and AWAY from Athleisure. What a moron. Uniquely positioned to capitalize on this market and he runs away from it. I'm in shock right now. A lesson in how to not run a company.
I’m seeing a ton of uaa gear at the gym and on the streets both here and in Asia. Far more than I’ve seen before
whats the word on earnings???
Forgot my gym clothes on a trip Was in the store to by som new and Under Armor was more or less sold out.
This is moving higher.
Why are there no Statistics for UA?
Till then this stock will trade sideways

Not a very good day at all for most.
UA reached a 52 Week low at 11.34
"I was a big fan of UA apparel a few years ago but hadn't bought anything lately, just hadn't liked anything I'd seen from them. Have been following the stock the past few months, was browsing their shoes last night and found a few I really wanted, ended up buying a $150 pair, so I finally bought some shares today on this drop."

UA is positioned to come back strong. Be patient.

ADD MORE!!!!! 1 AUGUST BE GREAT!!! REMEMBER THIS POS.... MAKE SOME MONEY IN A WEEK
I raised target to $28 ... period.
The only place I see Under Armour brands are at TJ Maxx and Nordstrom Rack. I don't know of anyone who has ever purchased their products full price. It's always next to Champion and other 2nd tier brands...

"Lots of new workout gear will be sold by UA to go with the footwear. Numbers will be record levels for UA $25 IS COMING WE KNOW02:16 PM EDT, 04/06/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Athletic footwear sales are continuing to grow at the fastest clip in the industry, with March sales up a ""historic"" 40% to 50% year over year, UBS said in a note April 6.The US fiscal stimulus is likely responsible for two-thirds of the growth spurt with reopening of the economy from coronavirus restrictions accounting for another 25%. Sales for 2021 should grow 10% over 2019 with the back-to-school period providing a boost.The brokerage's report is based on a call it hosted with the CEO of a privately held footwear retailer.""The expert's conclusion is fiscal stimulus is boosting all parts of the business and thus reopening probably only explains a portion of the acceleration,"" UBS said. ""As reopening becomes a bigger factor, dress category and store-level sales will rebound more sharply, while [e-commerce] and athletic sales growth rates normalize.""UBS raised full-year 2021/22 EPS estimates for most footwear stocks in its coverage universe: Boot Barn(BOOT) , Columbia Sportswear(COLM) , Crocs(CROX) , Designer Brands(DBI) , Deckers Outdoor(DECK) , Foot Locker(FL) , Steven Madden (SHOO), Skechers (SKX), Under Armour(UAA) , V.F. Corp(VFC) , and Wolverine World Wide(WWW) . Price targets, however, were not lifted as full-year 2023 EPS estimates were not updated."
"When brands introduce a completely new product, they often mitigate risk with reduced levels of production and distribution. This also allows the, to say “it sold out in a hour” rather easily. So, we’ll know much more if we ever find out how many units they launched with at retail. Minimal units means they were hedging bets and the long term effect is still tbd."
NKE and LULU are eating this company's lunch. Sell and own those two.

"So this has been in a decent recovery, right up until the stupid CEO signs a letter about the voting law in GA (that actually makes it easier than in DE or NY...but lets not let the truth get in the way). Now that UA has alienated half the country that wants their vote to count and not be cancelled by dead people and illegal aliens, the only customers left are the woke moonbats that worship the leftist swoosh. Let the shareholder lawsuits fly."

I can’t believe comments about analysts. If you make decisions based on that you are amateurish. I bought at 13.75 when there were signs of a turnaround and lots of negativity. That’s how I have made a lot of money. You have to think independently
The new Under Armour Hovr shoes launching February 1st is really nice + it automatically tracks your run with built in sensors / visit their website to take a look!!
Going to $10
"Dang, shorties run this board and they are relentless."
Brand is still trending down....thoughts on shorting?
"Longs have nothing to worry about. Yes, PE is high and the growth seems to be slowing, but oh no, not 20% growth ONLY 10%?? Longs have nothing to worry about. Sorry the returns will not be 20% per year and only 10%. It's the end of the world!!..not."
"UA is not a leader in anything , they are now a copy cat company that are so far behind the times , they spend their time copying the leaders products - they are now a third tier copycat business"
Better than buying at $49.
Can't wait to hear what Kevin has to say next! Oh Boy!
See you guys @54 by the end of the year
What do you guys think about UA next year

Well looks like quite a few individuals soiled their shorts today.Looks like the worst is over and the glide back to the 40s is beginning.Curry taking the championship would be the icing on the cake!
Lol who sold feeling #$%$ now lol
UA everywhere in winter Olympics. high quality and beautiful products from Under Armor. i loaded 20k at 12 few days back
Shame on Plank. Even the once struggling CMG is getting closer to ATH and Under Armour is still down more than 50% from it's highs. He needs to step down from his role.
where is the 16% gain?
Any thoughts on a Nike / UA deal....could be like Exxon/Mobil....say Nike/UA
Maybe Planck can sell his clothes at the next DNC convention? Because every republicans I know is boycotting UA now. Glad I sold awhile back. The guys an idiot.
Getting back!
Over priced products! too much SGA! Too much talk of innovation and not enough actual progress! IMHO See you at $5
Who is sensoring me?UA just won Super Bowl. Ua 4% market cap of nke. UA just recently started getting into footwear which means you can triple the revenue stream easy not to mention foreign growth which can only go up. Some haven’t even heard of ua in other countries. Just hold.
I Sold all of my under armour with a 3 k loss. 50 procent more wage for the worker means less money for Ua. I think price will steady around 17-18.
Next stop 20.
Today's up move with half the usual volume seems suspicious - perhaps manipulated because of today's options expiry date. Forward PE of 45 for low growth seems way too high (even higher than for many tech stocks that have much higher revenue growth than UA).China trade war and slowing global growth can't be positive for UA.
There are some large blocks of shares being traded the past week. Looks like a mutual fund has taken some interest.
UAA will be good in the long term when you are just about ready to throw in the towel that is usually when the stock is at the bottom.The problem with the market today invetors are like herion addicts they want they quick fix of euphoria it takes time and disapline in this market to make money
Continued decline in NA rev...declining DTC rev...massive miss in Footwear. No growth strategy on the horizon by an executive team that is out of touch. And now an investigation into accounting practices. Tough to get behind right now.

"Some dude at #$%$?s today said UA is going to pop off next year with MLB contract. Yeah, okay..."
"The Under armor shoes are styles the company purchases from Chinese factories, they look clean but nothing special. Nothing special in the Curry shoes. You go to China and order a style from a chinese supplier and sell it to Ross."
Stock price doubled over last two years and now forward PE is 45 which is way too high for a company that's revenue growth has been declining and the company is losing money. I get suspicious when brokers upgrade a stock which is unjustifiably too high - may be they want their best clients to get out at higher price.
Wow nice beat!
As soon as hit $18.80ish will drop much lower to -$17.00ish in a week :)
What time is the ER?
"Deutche Bank. hold rating on FRED. $8 price, Dec 5 Fred returns to profits, no debt. $17 long term"

"UAA grew by being an upstart, disrupting its space. But now its just perceived as a Nike wannabe. There is nothing that differentiates it."
13.95-14 close today
Kohls does not let you apply coupons on UA similar to Nike and Adidas so this analyst does not know what he is talking about. Adding these stores actually helped the brand as more customers now have access to their stuff. I see kids wearing UA sweatshirts everywhere.
The bottom has got to be close....I am glad I sold out months ago.
Under Armour not trustworthy to investors! Can't think of worse news to come out and the timing isn't good!
"Yeah they should stay out and keep their mouth shut when it comes to politics. Businesses (and actors, athletes, etc) should stay neutral in politics in public. There's no point in #$%$ off half the population.

"The excitement in UA is over, this is just another retail stock."
UAA appears to suggest upside opportunity. have you guys heard of awesomeSTO-CKS. i started receiving their allerts and so far i am happy.

Went to my local gym today and it seemed like 80% of the people were wearing UA clothing. I love the stuff / band and will buy nothing but UA. This is a one in a life time opportunity on the stock price. If UA beats and guides up by a small amount we are looking at $16 per share minimum that day…

And exactly how do you trust this earnings released when they are being investigated for cooking the books.
It used to be Sportswear companies dropping players endorsements if they don't like their behavior (ex. Tiger Woods) now it might turn around and be the Pro Athletes who drop the Sportswear company because they don't like their choices!
"Nice bump on the hedge fund news, low volume though, like the news hasnt really gotten out yet."
"time to buy!!!!!!! This stock will blossom soon. Was on the west coast this past week, Under armor was the gear I seen folks had on."
never mind this stock will recover in no time. come back kid!
UAA reached a 52 Week high at 22.88
3 words: Shorts got screwed
This is what happens when you support Trump!
Nike's revenue declined by 50%. Imagine what Under Armour's number will show.
"Gentlemen... I'm liking the pop today, but trying to understand what I'm not seeing. reason for pop other than we've been down with market lately?"
"Rolled the dice at $19 not long ago. Woo-hoo, up $1 already. Hoping this stock rebounds to $30."
yea John ...I've made money on UA not lost it... buying at 12 was a no brainier

Down sharply today. Did Kevin Plank say something I don't know about yet?
This guy Mike was on here last month talking about how the stock was headed towards $0 and dead serious about it. He also said the stock would be at 9 dollars today as well.
"One of the comeback stories of 2017. Nike as well will be dragged along but maybe not as much as UAA. I won't attempt to guess what the stock price will be, but it will be a heck of lot better than it is now. Merry Christmas"

Now all of you own a poltical based stock. People in the midwest put UA on the exchange and they will now stop buying. GOOD LUCK hope you have deep pockets.
OK longs time to load up. The pit of misery beckons.

Is 8b cheap or expensive here? Any opinions from investors?
"Trying to scare the weak hands. UA will beat. Stock will rise. When you can read more than the negative headline, you will see this is an attempt to temper the Rise we will see i. The AM. Same things were said about TSLA. Looked how that worked out after ER. Just sayin. It’s obviously a solid business, selling real products, general strongbRevs and profits. New things happening, big changes for the better of the LONG!"
Nike and Adidas has much uglier design on their apparels than UA. Their inferiority is reflected in their price. The only weakness is the shoes but apparels are much more profitable and have a lot more turnaround. Fact: People have more clothes than pair of shoes.
"UA: PEG Ratio (5 yr expected) 1 13.02 Growing slowly but has a nosebleed multiple = disaster Oh and they pay no dividends, just like enron did not and we know what happened."
Sellers will regret it by 11am est
Pretty sad when UA is filling the racks in discount stores. Nobody wants the junk. Keep bashing trump plank.
"dont buy here,,,this was short covering,,,it stops here,,,,they will re short here tomorrow,,,be cautious trying to buy here"
nice bounce back
"All you have to do is visit an outlet store or look around at the gym Under Armor is selling product. The consumer has cash for causal clothing and workout outfits and sneakers from not eating out and going on vacation during the Covid crisis . Consumers are out shopping and spending that stimulus money and a third check is coming to another 730,000 Americans. Just look at Crox and Sketchers earnings Under Armor is next."
DOES ANYBODY OUT THERE WANT TO PUNCH KEVIN PLANK IN THE FACE MORE THAN ME? WHO DAT?LET'S FANTASIZE ABOUT THE WAYS THAT KEVIN PLANK CAN PAY BACK THE POOR INVESTORS THAT HE TOOK TO THE CLEANERS.
This stock is going to go back to 20s
Squeeze coming
How many people bought both AMD and UA?
Great Result. Congratulation Longs. I am not here to bash retail shorts. Retail long and shorts are always clueless (Include me) but I think this was great result. Don't listen to Analyst they are bunch of greedy smart people out there to help big player steal your money. Not saying we ignore them because they working for Big Player but also 50% time doing right thing (In order to keep some reputation). Just hard to tell when they saying truth and when not.
UA does 13% of the business Nike does. valued at 10% of Nike and has better growth then Nike. How is Nike rated a better buy?
i don't think it will die though ... right now it is traded as if it would die
LMAO! All you Gooners post mundane nonsense personal crybaby posts.....nothing of any substance or value. My one and only post to inform the less experienced investor to pay no mind to this board. It is complete and utter nonsense.

People are making big deal about their Flagship store. So I research more. Lot of misconception there. $200M price tag is real but it's total lease they will pay in 15 year.So It's not as significant. Work out 13.33M/year. Nike paid nearly 3 time that much for their flagship store.

UA is down 9.93% to 7.26
Why it’s crashing ???
UA is coming out with their new homeless line of sporting wear - because that is their new target market since they cant compete with the big three to sell it to the mainstream consumer anymore
"When you don't have a clue and you short a stock, then you have to come here and write stupid comments one after the other."
Mike - Come out you coward!!! I know you see this message!
How many believe that UA can get to $25 by end of this month?
People cashing in profits and buying cannabis! :) It will be in mid $20s by end of the year.
"If gets to $24, we are in a good place. Lol."
RKT or UA please comment
back to $20 tomorrow
"Trading Nation says don;t buy but don't short ti either,"
"PE Of 45 even at $18. share! C'mon Man! PE Of 30 @ $15. share,this is going to drop even further,just a little rest today then the carnage will continue next week with absolutely no dividend payment to soften the blow,sad just sad!"
Has Under Armour signed Taylor Swift yet?
"Everyone forgot their results , all sold okay boyThe decline that occurred is a technical drop to close the gap at 18.40 has closed !Now resistance at 21.20 will close the gap at the top at 22UAA good for longs and Plank Crazy man"
"As long as Plank is not in the helm ... i am okay with it.The company expects pressure on its gross margin in the second half of the year, and might not have enough inventory if sales recover faster than expected, executives said on the call."
Cramer says maybe at $11.... I say wait until single digits. This company could be in dire straits. Plank started a distillery wouldn't that #$%$ off investors of UA that he may have been putting a lot of his time into a non UA entity??? Everyone will be drinking as stock continues to plummet.
"I wouldn't say train wreck but there was some damage done for sure. Looks like they are steadily making repairs , no more big drops in stock price. Not a shiny diamond of a stock but lots of room for upward progress towards $28 year's end.... Be patient and if Curry wins another 3rd championship, his sneakers will be very popular and in super high demand especially overseas and in California. UA long!!"
Good trend line building the past 3 months.
great rebound tomorrow
"one day couple of years ago I purchased NKE, COLM, LULU and UA. UA did not do as well as the other three. I hopeful UA will catch up and give good returns. Long on all 4."
"I am a long holder of the stock and wish for strong numbers but watching red every f*cking day is getting rough. You would think something positive would come out of this but never does - you have Curry, Spieth, MLB contract, college contracts and nothing. I guess the only hope is the short squeeze but it's been tough!"
We going the wrong way
buy ___ Fred ___ strong buy Nov. 6.50 target ___ at 3.57
My wife bought this #$%$ stock. Could this be grounds for divorce?
LOL Gshaun YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!
UA has lots of problems .... But the biggest one is Kevin Plank .... Sell Now .... Don't get left holding the Bag !!!
Just picking up your shares cheaper
"on May 7, this was $15.86 ... then up every day ... to 22.12 ... amazing"
Really what happened wow dropped $1 just like that strange
So many lawsuits OMG
"What a con-job releasing 2.5 year old information on Sunday night, the day before ER. Cons. We beat!"
selling to themselves can drive down price which is illegal by SEC.
AMD climbing this week! Loading up Monday AM. New partnership with Intel. Entering mobile computer space. New integration on Apple products and deal with Tesla right around the corner! Green uptrend right now. You're welcome.
well this stock is overrated anyways.
The name Under Armour will not overseas. They don't like the armour part. I warned you Nowrdq
"Short this garbage, it will collapse!"
I wanted to buy this stock when it went public a few year back but the price moved up to fast and I never got in. I saw it was now sitting at around $8.50 and thought I would dip my foot in. I do get concerned about the retail environment so they will have to continue to innovate their distribution network. I still like a lot of their stuff....but then again--I am an old man with little fashion sense.
Under Armour is great company with outstanding products.
UA is giving all military members 40% off of anything they buy on UA website. This is 
"Steph Curry not leaving Under Armour - Yet! But not real happy with management either! Border Tax will kill UA sales even more,treading water,careful!"
"My cost basis is $6 and I have owned UA through the splits. I really like wearing UA stuff and I have given grandchildren UA stuff for years. I can't decide whether to just sell out or hold on. I could put the money into something else that might do better but I really like UA clothes. I own Nike too and it does pay a dividend even though it has not done well this year. I do have a split in it, too. I know I am not selling Nike, but I can't decide yet on what to do with UA and UAA."
Ouch see you under $10
Why would you be a buyer of this stock? A lot of the commenters below claim to have seen a lot of people wearing UA gear recently and the company still reported a loss of $0.08 a share after taking out over a 100 million for restructuring charges!Can't see this stock going higher in the near term.
I think the rally is over ... 16.5 .. not bad.
start buy @11.52
It sure is heart warming to know that we have such a renowned space scientist in Steph Curry promoting this company's shoes! DUH
"I'm sure Kevin Plank has a lot on his mind, but running this business ain't one of 'em."
"I hope the selling out of UA architech shoe is a sign of things to come,,,,"
"CNBC and cramer, a subsidiary of comcast...is using my cellphone, television, and computer to track and spy on me without authorization."
"UA should buy lululemon (an so get mirror platform) and pelaton (plus make their premium shoes at $125). Vertical integration, massive number of customers,"
RSI at 17!!!! Talk about MANIPULATION!
earning beat .09 vs .04....beat on rev also
shoes are not good quality
If you go to Macys ... junks from UA none is buying
So much for all those $30 estimates
"No reduction in FED rates for the rest of 2019 - so no stimulus as many were expecting and that means slower growth. Trump may ""demote"" Powell which will create uncertainty and push markets down."
"love this stock, can't wait to get in at lower prices..."
this rally is unsustainable. Will fall back to where it came from. Look at SKX's rally and fall back. UA will follow the same wall street playbook. It is just a game for Wall Street sharks. The pigs will get slaughtered. Hehe
"Buy if you can , UA will not fall today , Reverse current"
Go!! Go!! $12.
I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR A RUMOR TODAY THAT KEVIN PLANK IS RESIGNING OR DIED SUDDENLY. ANYONE? IS THAT WHY THE STOCK IS IN THE GREEN TODAY?
"No dead cat bounce with fresh new $17. Price Target,only lower!"
look at bw - it's on a run looks like!!
Under Armour is up 5.83% to 20.87
21.8 - Time to Buy. It won't be this low for a long time.
Under Armour is an unique and strong brand. For me it is on a par with Adidas and Nike. People's desire for more diversity and individuality in sportswear will help Under Armor soar.
It looks like the Curry shows are hot again. In my son's basketball league they now have 6 kids wearing Curry's out of 4 teams.
Sold its fitness app and it goes up?
When is asap rocky releasing his shoe?
Under Armour is down 4.92% to 18.48
go LULU
"Going against the grain - I think this is a double within 2-3 years. But might drop as low as $12 first. If I wasn't already in it, I would scale in here below $17, below $15 below $13, then sit tight."
U gotta be kidding no way
At $ 16.95 I will make a small entry point.
"webtraffic for July is through the roof, next quarter will be a smash up to 20 easy. Good momentum"
buy zyne
"Run from this company...too much internal conflict, instability, and turnover. I sold @ $18 and change in 2017 and never looked back."
$12 coming
wrote a lot of puts
"So now Under Armour is being Boycott by half the Nation,Wow! I couldn't make this stuff up If I wanted! Just Too Funny!"
I consider an Accounting probe a material event. Why was this not disclosed earlier?Two year affords ample time to make the reveal. Why disclose it now? It feels like more bad news headed this way.
UAA reached a 52 Week low at 14.44
UA is down 7.15% to $17.65
"Whatever bad news is poured over Nike is twice as bad for UA. All this ""Adidas taking over"" talk is temporary and while it may seem bad for Nike, it is unfortunately worse for UA. I still think Nike will come out on top. Adidas style is a trend right now. Trends change."
UA on Black Friday trading 1000 shoes a minute. Doesn't look like inst buying to me. I posted why this is a short many times and continue holding the short even during Christmas season. There is no life in this outside of desperate retell traders
Nice upgrade by Piper Sandler with a PT increase to 28. That is 4 upgrades this year alone. Look for some strong gains the first half of the year...
Got my sell orders at $80
Wake me up when the market cap gets down around $2.5B and I'll consider covering.
Throw in the towel! If APPL misses this market will tank tomorrow and down goes UA again! Not looking good for longs!
Why is there a UA and UAA?
"ACTIVIST investor needed quickly, we shareholders will vote with anybody , this terrible mgmt. team needs to go today"
"Go Woke, Go Broke"
My wife and I are longterm holders expecting a rebound. We bought UA Christmas gifts for the grandkids and they were all excited. UA products are still respected and desired by our kids 10 to 25. Their reactions make us confident for the future of UA.
Walmart Blue Light Specials on UA Gear! Retailers looking to unload merchandise that's not moving is only reason to cut prices otherwise they would sell for full price! More losses for UA Ahead!
"Over priced Poly ESTER,, Keven P wants a new House so he is selling 72 Million shares to pay for it.. The Land alone cost 2.8 M for his ""new"" house , it will be 35,000 Square feet and just a little bit smaller then the White House ! Wow, the Rich do live well, don't they.., every day you put on UA your paying for his house!"
Just breached $20.00 and heading lower. I'm backing the truck up at these levels and planning to sell in about 10 to 15 years from now! Can't lose!!
"I love when is down over 10% which mean i can add more share, im still up 17% "
"In october 2015 Under Armour had half of the market cap of nike, today it has one fortieth of it. I bought, because I think that this rate shifts back in Under Armour's favor"
Everybody sold out now first stop $11.20 then $6
UAA is up 9.68% to 9.86
$17. Near Term! Low $14.'s before carnage ends!
Got back in last week - just wish I had filled my whole position at that time. This will be the top stock for 2018. The strong promotional activity will impact margins for the next quarter but introduce a whole new consumer to UA products who will return to buy more at higher margins. Anyone who owns 2-3 UA products end up being long-term consumers from my experience and are more than happy to pay full MSRP because there is a value to quality products.
This is starting to nose up...
17 soon for UA
ua is overvalued big imho
NOW ANALYSTS SAYIING UNDER ARMOUR REPORTS WONT BE PRETTY........uuuuugh
Wow. Nike and Patrick Reed win the Masters. The rich get richer!
Take Profits before this next dip again..........:
"Nice trajectory path upward started again folks! Look at 3 month charts, UAA is in an upward pattern that looks to break 23 in about 2 weeks. The stock is like a stubborn boxer that won't stay down and keeps getting up , like Rocky Lol! Go UAA "
going under soon? LOL
Why would you buy this junk!!!
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO KRAFT. ACCOUNTING ERROR NOT FUN
"Last Post! GLTA but remember there will be Dead Cat bounces that look like a reversal but that's the purpose of a Dead Cat bounce,also not only are shorts still in control like it or not but Day Trading is now in full effect! You've been warned! Have a nice day!"
Go GSW!!!
"I agree, and it looks horrible again, congrats!"
Not one item sold out! Suicide squad
Told you. Wondering why it is still trading that high
Solid base... 18 dollars coming
"PE ratio 1700 , wow"
Get tim tebow a pair and watch under armpit outperform
"What happened to that close above $20. prediction? Be lucky to close above $19.with Price Targets cut by more than half,best guess is $14. or $15. as entry point if they don't go bankrupt first!"
maybe Kevin Plank should buy back shares of his own company that he stole for doing nothing the last 6 years. I agree the material is so much softer than Nike.
Virgin Galactic just IPO and the spacesuit is designed by Under Armour... this sounds nice
"Steph Curry Comments! Check my posts,I said he might! Nailed It!"
JUST ANOTHER RED LETTER DAY FOR UNDER ARMOUR. SIMPLY THE WORST COMPANY AND STOCK IN THE S&P. ALL BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE WORST LEADERSHIP IN THE S&P.LOL - TALK ABOUT A RESTRUCTURING IS NONSENSE UNLESS IT INVOLVES THE LEADERSHIP. KEVIN PLANK NEEDS TO GO. PERIOD. FULL STOP.
What is John doing? He's posting nonsense and then deleting it.
UA hasn't had a big enough kick in the #$%$ now they insult Joe sixpack? Wow!
what's up with today's bump? any reason?
"The CEO has eyes but he does not see, he has ears but he does not hear. He has brain but it is too small."
up big on no news? there should be something going on
Bad day for UA?
Of course Durant says that #$%$. He sponsored by nike and as I hear it his shoes sales suck. Hey Durant just put the ball in the hoop and shut up.
something is happening - why all the buying in the last day or so? someone knows something or someone is pumping this up.
"Based on trends with Skechers, a PT of 24 is predicted after earnings for $UA."
Lulu's designers and marketing would fix this company pretty quickly. Good fit?
"Look as incredibly brain dead Under Armour's management is, even Crox was able to crawl their way out of a massive hole. I'm buying more UAA shares because they can't possibly screw up North America any worse than they already did!"
Buy the dips boys....
It will close at $18.20 or higher today. Plenty of time....Long and Strong BIG here.
"At this price has got to be a take out candidate, right?"
Any news?
"When is this company going to make shoes people want to buy? I’ve been saying this for years and I’m still waiting. I’m not trying to trash the company, I actually believe in it, I just don’t know how patient I should be. I would like a better entry point if possible, do any of you see it hitting $15 this year?"
they should give dividends. price may go up and ua company would work harder to expand.

"Hello guys, not one item sold out in that ugliest collection ever"
"Who are these people or person that has a firm grasp on what PE ratio indicates and gets on here constantly spewing ""PE ratio"" as if thats what makes a stock move in any direction. Please... we undrstand that you know what PE ""means"". Also, by your logic everyone take a second mortgage out and buy TWTR immediately! Its PE RATIO is -$29!!!!!! Hurry!!! PE RATIO!!! Oh yea... anyone stupid enough to short UAA at these levels, the short squeeze youre about to experience is going to be the one that changes your life."
"why the two issues, UA and UAA?"
what did I say last week...I told y'all...buy out is coming on horizon..
Fatbody Sam Poser from Susquehanna is at it again; poo-pooing UAA all over again. Don’t listen to him boys.
He thinks it tinder here
Don't believe in fat old analysts about fashion brands. UA is going to be cooking in the next few years.
UA and LULU merger would rock!
"My son plays AAU basketball. This is the first year their program is doing an Under Armour Circuit, where you can't where anything but Under Armour into the gym. We've been looking in stores for shoes for him off an on the last couple of months. What is very concerning, is there aren't any retailers really carrying hardly any of their basketball shoes. If you are a lead AAU sponsor trying to compete with Nike and Adidas, you have Steph Curry, and you still can't get shelf space that does not bode well for meeting future growth, which is why I've stayed away from the stock."
Anyone's thoughts on possibility of AMZN buying out UA? Check out link from Bloomberg. Could make a lot of sense for AMZN to buy someone like UA vs building up their own brand. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-13/amazon-is-said-to-make-sportswear-push-in-industry-rattling-move
$12 IS FAIR
Looks like Plank is at his wit's end trying to save his own baby ...
https://investorplace.com/2019/12/2-big-reasons-why-under-armour-stock-could-rebound/
UAA needs to step up to the plate and announce a stock repurchase plan.
$9 is not out the question
"Even if they meet next quarters earnings don't expect more than a 1% pop in share price which will soon be only .16 or .17 cents,at that rate it will take forever to get back to even $20, just sayin' better places to invest ( T 4.7% Divy,10% ROI)"
Looks like your on track Jarold for 18’s by Wed
How anti-American can Under Armour be?
It’s matter of time!!!!!
"Buy UA, Just do it."
Well it took the SEC a decade to take a look at Made offs books. Jeffy at GE was allowed to pillage for two decades.
That was just another short entry. That bump up from 12.12 to 12.20 in that one trade
"Hey Clowns that own this stock......when do we hit $25? LOL.......we had one good day on earnings, and then rolled over like the dog POS this stock is.Thankfully, I sold 1/2 my position that day at no loss. Still stuck at $32 with the other 1/2. What a loser Kevin Plank is.You want this stock to pop 25% in one day? FIRE KEVIN PLANK........THAT WILL DO IT."
Plank must be hiding in his mommy's basement while market is shredding the stock to pieces. What a great job he has done by creating so much value over the past 5 years...NOT
Patients here! Will see $18 soon enough
http://fortune.com/2017/10/31/under-armour-is-struggling-heres-why/
Johnny Cash ill walk the line-looks like shareholders walk the PLANK...
WE SEE THIS UNDER $15 REAL SOON THE PRODUCT JUST ISN'T SELLING IN THIS SPRING
Mchin....... Better crawl out of under that rock soon...... lol
hwere do I short UA or UUA
"The ceo likes to kiss his own product while the president is wearing them; this is not going over well . When will CEO's and BOD's realize that to be successful in business,you must remain apolitical."
UA has a better chance to see $10 before $20. How much did they make last quarter? This stock is highly overvalued right now. Those big contracts with Steph andJordan Spieth might bankrupt UA. Good Luck.
The problem is nobody is buying their products but everybody is chasing its hyped stock.
UA is set to have a pretty good comeback according to Goldman Sachs.
sold at 15.9 then bot back
UAA is up 7.36% to 15.90
New 52 wk low today
"Exactly........ spot on S, my thoughts exactly.!!They’re trying to run the price up, by increasing the target price. Luring investors in to thinking the stock is going up, then corporate investors will dump their shares and run with the money!!"
Under Armour was upgraded by Susquehanna
UA is up 9.12% to 8.73
"Under Armour "" We are the Champions"" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
UA really getting hammer.... is the management still working?
Hilarious. This is about the only stock in the red. Wall St HATES this company.
Anyone consider to buy
"Can’t be long now before Nike buys UA at these prices, seems like a no brainer."
Love it!!
surprised to see that it couldn't hold 17.79 today. Oh well.
I sold at $18s ... regretted ... wondering how could I hold longer? Will the Mafia MMs see my shares using machines?
do I buy UA or UAA? I see one is up over 1% while the other is down not sure why. makes me think I buy UA since it's down and needs to catch up
It's holding up well. It appears that there is fight between few analysts with opposite views on Q1 earnings. By tomorrow the sky will be clear.
Looks like everytime a stock is coming out with a earnings report it is time to short. Just saw it with SWHC too. Tired of this #$%$.
Mr. Kevin A. Plank is still in the company? LOL
Nancy i love you
PE is too high....
Nike boycott work #maga
Do we blast down into the 11s here in a few?
what is the pm price?
$15 coming? OMG! Dmmm!
camilo long while it goes down and short while it goes up must be a great investor
"buy now before late , Do not sell before the 30"
Expectations for this quarter are really low. could set-up nicely for a beat. Retail sales and economic reports have been good lately.
How can this be news? The review started two years ago.
Great stock buy waiting to buy cheaper maybe 12-13 if gets there
PLANK NEEDS TO BE SPANKED. No Trump voter will EVER buy another Under Armour product. WE BOYCOTT UA!
Under Armour is the New Cool! Nike is Old Fart Favorite... get in while it’s cheap - no fraud just unique accounting- no results given since starting investigation in 2017!! No worries!!
How many longs are gonna hold once we hit $17.?
Its going $100 like Nike Buy and hold long
Fred. .65. profit a. 7 p.e. $18
"So what exactly is UA? A shoe company or an apparel company? Is it an apparel company that happens to sell shoes? When I think of Nike and Addidas, I think of shoe companies who tapped into the apparel market. It seems like UA took the opposite approach; apparel tapping into shoes. If that is indeed the case, why would teens no longer wanting UA shoes be a “crisis?” Are the margins that much better on shoes that UA has refocused and now depending on shoe sales?"
"Where do they expense the strip club expenses? - now MSNBC scandal - what a ""company""."
Why the drop?
Nike beat earnings. UA feeling the heat now. I just don't see UA growing to the big brand that Nike and Adidas are today. I hardly see anyone wearing UA ..maybe a gym shirt here and there. Shoes? Barely. All I see is Nike and other designer shoes.
UAA is down 5.70% to 21.49
Quietly Under Armour has 2 of the top 5 NBA leading scorers. $GME $AMC $BB
"Nov 06, 2017 10.50 11.03 10.36 10.97 10.97 8,861,700"
"The Street just posted....Under Armour has a dual-share model, but there is a third class of shares that aren't publicly traded, are not worth anything to investors but hold a disproportionate number of votes per share. Plank, of course, holds tens of millions of shares in this class, essentially controlling the entire voting structure of the company."
Kevin. Move aside. Consolidate
Garbage stock.
tomorrow open above 24
"Sept 14, 2015 this is $104??? OMG ... so if sb. got trapped there and there is a suitor, no chances!!!"
North American president of Under Armour purchased 48K+ shares 2/20
Why up 7% already
Nike shoes split in half .. Zion touted number one pick overall in NBA ... was injured in the incident.. Bad publicity for Nike .. UA should take some market share away !!!
"NKE and DKS up 20-30% over the precovid high while UA down over 40%. There are serious macro trends behind this company with work from home environment, more people enjoying the outdoors, plus their consumer base (middle to upper class) has more money due to not commuting, not going on vacation/out to eat, etc. The market has hated this company due to lack of growth. It should return if they have anyone competent leading the ecommerce."
"NFL ends cobtract, down it will go"
"Plank put the nail in the coffin of the stock price by leaving the council. I bought my kid Nike shoes for his football team practices, even though he wanted UA. You better believe a lot of other people are doing the same thing as we speak."
"This stock is a terd. Why buy an apparel company with an outrageous 75 PE ratio, no dividends?For less money a share you can own Hanesbrand which earns 6 times as much and pays a 4 percent dividend. Champion quality is superior to UA"
all brands are over priced. ua has top athletes. don't be fooled by haters
"Congratulations Plank. Thanks to your knee jerk PC reaction you have disappointed your loyal shareholders and customers. You have also made the NYSE top losers today, just like you are. GREAT JOB!!!Too bad We can't quit YOU out of Under Armour."
"Down 60.39% as of today, tell the North American president of UA that I have some shares he can buy right here."
"get ready to take money off the table ,they sill lost money that is no a good sign .that mean people still buying other fitiness stuff from other sport companies"
"As soon as there is good news or upgrade , they post negative news about uaa within few hours ..Amazing how they want to manipulate the stock"
"Retail. U play the luxury sector: RL,tif, lulu, PRDSy, lvmh. Not middling cos with low pricing power."
Well this is just F’ing lovely. FML!
i like their shoes bot a lot UA shirts from macys
"I see the pattern, M&A is coming! They sold shares to make the stock drop then negotiation the price."
Sorry folks! THIS IS NOT ACCOUNTING FRAUD!! This is an investigation of accounting practices. The average investigation takes 2-3 yrs. Over 50% of the time no action is taken!!
Closing above 18.41 is fine too.
Cramer must be shorting he is ranting this morning.
"maybe UA needs to start selling face masks, buy 'em by the dozen in the colors of your favorite team"
I did my own research this past Xmas. Every UA store was packed with customers. The next ER should be nice. : )
"McDonald’s down over $13 after hrs. WTH something big is brewing, have never seen that before!!"
The sale in the fist Q is going to be weak - since a lot of people already bot last year. Ignore retailers
"I'm down over 3,000 (30%) any chance this will go up a little to recoup my losses or should I sell now since it's just been dropping a little daily? This was my first ever investment so I'm new to trading still!"
"Just came back from Disney and noticed a lot of people wearing UA. Wanted to buy a hat at Disney, but when I saw it was made by NIKE, no way. Our family has switched from NIKE, and while not enough to put a dent in spittoon, we will not purchase anything NIKE, and like under armor actually better."
I told you to sell before earnings
"Remember when all the libs/left media was out to get UA because Plank actually said he agreed with Trump's economic policy? Well they succeeded, and the only beacon of light in Baltimore is about to go out. Way to go libs. The left won't be happy until everyone works for the govt, they've used Covid to eliminate the travel/leisure industry as it was one of last capitalistic business groups."
Technicals are showing great signs of upside potential. Technical 75% chance bullish. http://www.foxchart.com/index.php?symbol=ua
PE of 84 when the highest growth division (not the entire company) is 40%. Couple that with declining margins and it all spells massively overvalued.
as a long time buyer of UA I can tell you their quality is better than ever. one of the many reasons this is a long hold in my portfolio. in at 19.33. glta
The stock has been overly punished and with the turn into more positive sentiment should bring it back up. I believe it reached a bottom in the high 18's it touch a week or so ago. shorts who enter the game in the last quarter might be up for a squeeze. I believe we will soon see some improvement in the analysts recommendation.
would be interesting to see how many on here actually own stock in under armour or just get on here post negative comments. I own stock in it.
"@12:45:36 some institutional buying.7,315 shares bought at $20.73.Level 2, TDAmeritrade."
rebound back to $12?
Kevin Plank needs to put his money where his faith is. If he thinks UAA is a POS stock and he won't invest in it. Why in the world would anybody want to invest in it?? What a manipulating loser. What a loss I'm taking. Hope Kevin enjoys the fruits of my labor.
UA is a strong sell at this level - Inflation index will be released tomorrow - this may drop to $16
"The fundamentals of UA are strong: Global Brand, Cash, potential market share, air time & sponsorships. It is only a matter of time when UAA starts climbing again to the heights it achieved a few years ago."
Shorted this thing into the ground. I love UA. Give me a thumbs down if you’ve lost your life savings to this stock.
well on the bright side it cant drop much lower.. $12 pretty much has to be the bottom
This is a bloodbath..
The only reason I can think of that the MOTLEY FOOL is thrashing UA is that it trying to drive the price down. It's going to rocket.
Under Armour is up 9.72% to 13.21
I am willing to give Plank a chance - he has admitted his mistakes in politics. UA is my favorite brand to be honest. I don't like junks from Nike or Addidas (stinky)
YouTube is getting heavy with the new UA HOVR sneaker; people claiming its revolutionary (anti-gravity) cushioning technology. The next big thing since “Nike Air”.
"I'm glad I sold at $98.50 a couple years back......I didn't like their business plan...sadly, this goes a lot lower"
MOJO back? Even Jordan Speith is playing better. Curry #2 in NBA scoring. Emiid #4. Tom Brady wins the super bowl.

"wow. definitively need to short this.check the report: NA sales keep on declining with inventory building up in mid-teen numbers. Read: ""We will have to continue liquidating product at low margins"", so no EBIT. International business expanded by 47%, but this is mostly due to store openings in lots of countries. in most of them they operate not directly but through Retail partners who buy from UA since they need to fill the stores. But it doesn't mean that final consumers bought UA products. Numbers look very much inflated. Unless they prove somehow that final consumers demand is strong.Plus international inventory building up faster than their Revenue. Plus they have issues with DEBT/EBITDA at quite alarming ratio."

Management has lost its way...I'm now buried in a stock where management just got lucky and now has no idea how to increase sales at a good profit margin...Ugh!
might be a good buy international sales up 35% and direct to consumer sales up 15%
UAA is down 9.55% to 8.19
Is it worth buying under armor before earnings and when is the earnings
"Wait couple of weeks and see where it is...Go-go funds looking for 20+ percent growth need to dump this over next two months. Don't see any catalyst at this point for PPS to go up. Valuation is not cheap for value fund to buy. Risky bet with nearly 5B in rev to grow 1B a year from hereon...Wait till 14-15 multi-year low for possible support from growth at value funds. I doubt value funds would not touch this until around 10 or so. No turn around story evident. Exec mgmt. have lost credibility. UAA projected 20% growth in rev and you got 10-11% so would you believe them if they say 10-11% growth. Good chance that growth has hit the wall and rev may fall flat for rest of the year. Besides, UA is investing heavily and thus credit downgrade to junk since no guaranteed that the investment will be successful...BYTW there are 3 classes of stock (A,B,C) instead of common and preferred (typical setup with preferred giving div and no vote). Again very troubling in trying to keep accounting staright... Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always..."

"Poser was equally wrong about Deckers Outdoor (DECK), the maker of UGGs. He just raised his price target to 62, saying the company is in big trouble. He's been trashing it for a year or so. Right now the stock is over 95. Long ago I advised DECK holders to consider his reports to be worthy of nothing but laughter. The same would appear to hold for his UAA reports. He would appear to be out of touch with the strength of brands such as Under Armour, UGGs, and Hoka One One (another Decker's brand)."

UA is cutting into Nikes market big time what a bunch of #$%$ Nike has supply issues. UA product line has expanded from winter jackets to new golf clothes and causal wear during the pandemic. UA is firing on all cylinders and the consumer has a pocket full of cash to spend this spring. Stay the course this will hit $30 in 2021

why the big dip after hours?

Members-only clothes are more popular now than UA....
"Mike you do t know anything! This share is the best share there is at the moment. Their inventory is 25% which is nothing, they will clear this the coming months. Their debt ratio is also not worrying, conpletely normal in this business. Their potential in the rest if the world is enourmous. At the moment you dont see the brand in many chainstores but it is very popular(i dont like the brand at all but have shares). They have a hub for shoes now and the first new models are an instant succes. Their footwear business had huge potential just as their oversead revenues. This stock will go to 50-60 before the end of the year. I dont understand why you are being negative on shares you dont have, you lost some money with it, stop crying like a little #$%$ and get over it. Buy some extra shares and double your money within a year"
CNBC just hit it saying last on susquahana list. Watching for a pullback to add.
Anyone know what UA is forecasting for Revenue in Q4? I cant find it anywhere.

When they drop the athletic bio tech shirts it’s game over. This company is about the future not tennis shoes
Ua needs to stop with Kohls and the other brick and mortars of the world. They NEED to and MUST invest in e-commerce by partnering with Amazon. That is the only way they will get on track again.
I love their style ... much better than Nike and Add ..
Why are we up?
Up 6 percent. They should fire more people.
UAA is down 15.28% to 17.91

"technically support levels are a little under $16. & then $14., but some tech. indicators are starting to bottom out/or are nearing oversold levels; so much further downside is probably overstated. Trade wars/tariffs are having an affect & lack of wage growth is an ongoing problem. Tax reform did not solve that nor was designed to be a solution. Tax cuts are only a one-time benefit whereas income/wage gains is the gift that keeps on giving. If you are trying to sell to people who don't have the money to buy what you are producing how is that a good outcome for the future?"

"Just back from gym where I wear my UA attire. Gym bag and shoes. Now I see this from the CEO and could just puke. He must not realize that people that work buy his products. Not the people he's trying to appease. I have bought so much UA with my hard earned money, now I won't buy anymore. This stock will go PLANK to the bottom from this CEO that should never had got involved in politics. He says it wasn't political, but it was wrong timing on his part. Us conservatives spend money on good products, but also spend where we have a sense of pride. I bought more because of him being there. We go to Branson,MO a few times a year and stop at Tanger outlet just for UA. Not anymore."
what does going red mean?
Under Armour reached an all time low at 6.53
the comment made by UA should calm down the left and be good for the stock. but it's trailing the market today.
Busting through $20 now. Next stop $24 yeah. All those naysayers saying it was going to $10. Loving it. NKE moving off the lows as well.
"Kevin Plank is such a moron. Right when the company looks like its turning the ship on a disastrous past 3 years, this strip club scandal comes out."
Big whoop with that upgrade. Trying to make money for their clients. Dead business this ua is. 70 bucks for T-shirt’s. Lmao.
"Stick With Under Armour,Really? Barrons! Under Armour currently commands a market capitalization that is only ~10% of that of Nike, while Under Armour’s TTM revenue is ~14% of Nike’s and TTM EBITDA is ~11% of Nike’s. Market share not there to justify holding the bag on this pig!"
Poser....opinion was since 10/17.But keeps on vomiting it back because there is nothing else for him to cover or talk about. He wants to make sure that all investors continue to remember that UA is NOT doing well like they breathe.

Shorts hammering it in pre-market to reduce early losses and prevent margin calls this afternoon. No reason to be short anymore and same guys will cover later. It's a game they're playing to #$%$ out weak holders.
Kevin plant but your stock back. Don't build hotels do your job or maybe we sue you for not doing your job . You have a fiduciary duty to your stock holders. Hope you can prove your work at ua while building your #$%$ hotel. I lose money we all will give you bad reviews to watch you go bk
I am going down with the ship! Maybe in 10yrs it will reach $37 where I bought at. The worst pick thus far in my portfolio

In the short-term UA does not seem to be like a good trade. Not sure how awesomesto-cks finds all these incredible trade ideas but im happy.
Not far away to 25s
good morning USA
If someone can look at UA financials and then look at SKX financials and explain how UA is worth $8B I'll tip my cap to you. This should realistically sink to $2.5-3B market cap until they can prove they've put a turnaround plan into action with some solid bottom-line growth.
$10.5 is a fair price
I’ve been in the garbage since $30 I think I’m gonna take my losses and get out with this huge jump
"Everywhere I look people are wearing UA clothing. Hopefully, their sneakers will catch on. Could be a very good year for UAA stock in 2017."
"All they had to do, under armour management, its as simple as chipotle adding shredded lettuce as an option and one day breakfast. That simple.Under armour shoes are too heavy, too hard, too goofy. Their shoes have always sucked. The perfect shoes are pegasus 35 turbos or the new turbo 2's.Under Armour can't be taken seriously till every shoe lists the exact weight and the right colors, solid red blue and white are not always sold out like with their best shorts.Now their lightest best short, heat series and dry shorts, don't make shorts, heaviier or add that thick #$%$ to the waist, stick to 2006 to 2008 style, just include the old style bathing suit liner, bit make the pockets deeper, enough they can carry around, cash, keys, a bottle of medicatioct shortsn.If you just make those exact shorts but with the same light pockets, just deeper, they will sell in droves. Ua has been told this so many freakin times on their reviebly the saws, management in charge of this and not listening should be fired.Probably the same dguys repeatedly making suck heavy shoes then stuck with them when they don't sellVe had more lives and chances than the most worthless door dash drivers.Can you imagine how worthless they are. Evrrutime they are even 1 minute late, call doordash customer support and tell them, demand your credits. A mile away, so what worthless f's still late.#$%$ and real mg can't get jobs.Socks shorts, some hoodies and jackets, major sports ua does right. But shorts could be perfect, offer a deep pockets version for 10 or 20 more, I'd pay it, #$%$ would fly off shelves.BuddahChina vroom uxin is the one back to 10New hires at ua, print this #$%$ out and read it to your board room. When deep pocketed heat shorts widr leg fully stretch to the knee, 9 inch sell out. That corner office, new biches and unlimited coke with the ceo is uour new reality. You can even afford a new peloton read mill or bike in your office now.These shoes are 8.8 ounces and come in solid red, blue, and white. Sellout credit if we sell out of your color within 90 days.Fire them, if it was me, I'd already be fired.Ua management and designers haThe bottom soul is 35% , softer than turbo 2's by nike, which would be perfect.Is that too hard? If I ran a top flagship position at under armour I would be running circles around nike within 2 yrs maxBuddahUxin back to 10"
Double beat top and bottom...down 15% on Federal probe rumor released night before ER. So shady! Good timing with release. Should be +15%. Will go green today!
UAA to $25 by July
shorting this tomorrow
Probe has been ongoing for more than 2 years. This short attack will be short lived.
I like Mike sneakers...but ua tops? What are you guys buying from these companies?
Better load up while its bottomed out aint gonna last long
UAA is down 5.01% to 20.65
I just don't get why this has such a large premium vs a Nike... I think it is a good company but the stock just got outta hand I plan to buy when the stock is valued correctly
Short!!!
I bought UA in Nov 2017 under $11.00 I have nearly doubled my money yet all I read on this site is negative. If you don't like the stock sell it and move on. why all the bashing. I listen to results not all this negative hype
Hf Xmas party
UA is just piggybacking on the industry. This company still needs to prove itself. a lot of gullable people. the rock selling shoes? #$%$! sure they made limited quantity. it was just a publicity for the actual release (Coincidental re-release) on June 28th. UA Marketing Dept creating false hype.
"Longs, this is our day. Shorts will burn."
UA is the new STARTER.
"Kevin A. Plank your a big hit with the liberal circuit now that you dropped out of white house bizz council... BUT REALLY, are you watching the triple bottom on the chart break down. Your company stock is melting.... next stop the 16's, on the way to the 11's then you can tell everyone in the liberal community, oh and your stockholders what kind of hero you"
Let's go UA and smoke those shorts!!!
Amazon will buy UAA soon....
Sell and cut your cost UA wont survive this down turn
The company big earning that beats revenue estimates was released this morning. That's why shares jump
"What has to happen to make one as bitter and negative as John-z? Your wife leave you for your sister? The guy who used to pick on you everyday in school becomes your boss? Why so nasty. Chillax bro, it's just money."
Love the company been wearing their clothes for years. I see UA all over the gym what’s up .
"whats up with so much green? im long, so i cant complain. we might get to 14 soon."
Under Armor gonna be Under Water tomorrow!
sorry Mike you should not have short your position...No !!! we are not going to wake up...us longs have been awake for a long time... yall are too greedy playing this stock for a quick buck and it's turned against you
Today looks nice
Pins popped 37% wow
Amazon wants to manufacture athletic wear. Why not just buy this company on the cheap.
manipulated like this is unprecedented lol
Nice beat!
"i just put in a fill or kill for 450 shares at 11.12 came out to like $6,200 after fees hopefully this does better than my last $20,000 that is still in for $18.50"
Close above 18 today. don't tease me....18.5+ would be extra bullish if at all.
"Todays upgrade looks like it will be the biggest clown call of the year. So UA is somehow going to rise to 3 year highs in a global economy that is deteriorsting rapidly. How can they say this and how can an inv believe it if they objectively look at global YTD data, especially the stuff over the past 3 months. This one will be interesting to watch unfold."
UAA reached a 52 Week low at 10.52
Should be another leg up today. Jefferies and others raised price targets overnight. Management held the course and is executing on the operations strategy. Congrats to longs. Expect the stock will continue to trade up. Irony of this is that Nike or Rakuten or other could have bought UA at $12 and owned the entire franchise but will now end up paying $40 to $70 at this rate.
Under Armour gonna boom now
any HOVR left? Want to buy a dozen
Buy buy buy
UA dead cat bounce will be below 17 soon 10 after earnings
does any athlete like president trump
"So much negativity on Under Armour today. Somewhat surprising that negative earnings were not already priced in. Have to wonder who is selling today when it has been known for a while that UA was having revenue issues.UA was one of my most profitable trades ever. Was lucky enough to sell at a pre split price of $99 per share. Have waited on the sidelines for a while and am just now beginning to accumulate some shares.Let's look at the positives that are not going away:-UA is profitable-UA is growing internationally both in sales and market share-UA is growing in direct consumer sales-UA has the MLB contract beginning in 2020If shares stay lower for longer, there are many possible suiters who may purchase this firm from Plank:Amazon, Berkshire, Nike, LuLu, Adidas, VF Corp... not to mention Private Equity or the possibility of taking UA private. Look for the company to get bought out in the $20 a share range ($10+ billion) if it does not get back on track in the short-term.Good luck to all."
Great buy at zero dollars per share.
Will hit $16 today. Then retract back to $14.
Downgraded. But for good reason on UAA’s part. Should be an interesting day
Anyone think UA might hit $18 or $20 in DEC-2019 good time to get in $16.07 or not.Please honey person advice
It’ll tank. Trust me.
JP Morgan upgrade UAA
Sell now this UAA will not recover form this sorry longs its over. Cut your loss and sell now
"Nice ""stop the bleeding"" quarter. I'm long, so par for me would have been stock down 20% given the last few quarters. Overall nothing to write home about though. They just re-affirmed lowered guidance. Sales growth in north america is now negative, and footwear growth has hit a wall. As I said before, they need to diversify with a few more higher end athletes instead of pegging everything on one guy in each sport (Curry, Newton, Spieth, Murray...)"
Kevin Plank should be next to resign! The only way to restore confidence in this company after that horrible interview on CNBC!
Heading back to $20
me too .. Added 5000 shares with 14.97
LAWSUIT!!!
"UA has learned nothing from the NFL or any other high profile athletic institution/athlete. Sports radio is overrun with politics, games are overrun with politics - stop and look around - we just want our sports back. I also am disgusted with the lack of effort put forth in keeping up with customer needs. I have a beautiful yet bad#$%$ athletic daughter and she absolutely hates the female line of UA. She shops in all the boys departments for their brand - she is 10 and she thinks UA sees her as weak! I wrote the board and told them to watch the TAMPAX commercials to get an idea of how to represent a female athlete - they do a way better job and nobody even knows if you are using their product - yet we wear UA on our chest, back, sleeve, you name it!"
UAA is down 4.92% to 21.85
This Mike Poser guy needs to dig himself into a large hole and never come out again. + nsip please do yourself a favor and save face at this point. Leave the board- you said the stock price would be $8 by now. Get out of here! No one cares what you think!
Impact of WSJ Story: Plank gets bored of the negative PR push and resigns like so many other founder / CEOs. We get a new CEO in with a huger personal incentive to cut costs and SELL the company to max out his / her stock package. Sounds good to me! OR he works even harder and blows away expectations for a few quarters to stick it to the bears - then sells at an even higher price. Sounds good to me!
The data breach on top of this will be driving price of this stock much lower.https://www.marketwatch.com/Story/under-armour-should-return-to-profitable-growth-in-the-next-year-2018-03-30?&siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo
Lol UA is fkd lol sorry longs
"Best thing for Under Armour was Kevin Plank leaving, should be back too 26 by end of year."
Correction finished and from now on market will rally to sky
Analyst expectations are calling for flat Q4 revenue!?!?! In 2016 they were going through Sports Authority closing. They had Kohls this past holiday season. I'm thinking we get a nice beat come ER.
"Had sold and lost money. Disappointing Mgt. Not high demand clothing anymore. So many better companies. Just saying, I have no interest or holding and wont"
"@Jonathon, you may be right or wrong, you may be a pumper or whatever, the truth is PLANK NEED TO GO, I used to truly believe in him as I am sure most if not all the shareholders did and now we don't. Plank has taken a great company and pulled it off the path that it should be on because he was worried of what the shareholders vote would be. That's the sign of a horrible CEO, hence why he split the stock. bottom line. he needs to be gone. UA is a great product, innovative by leaps and bounds but him nope."
what is going with this company??????? absolute mess
"One step forward, two steps back with UA"
going out of businee
"Guys this was great buy at 10-13. Right now valuation is near to 8.5 Billion.The positive scenario for UA for 2018 is this year break even, 2019 normalised profit of 250MUSD. You are paying for 2019 PE of 34 in a positive scenario. That is not cheap."
shorts running now before late
I don’t understand this. Was UA just s fad? All I saw was UA on all kids and adults a couple years ago.
I can see it now protestors outside UA distribution centers blocking trucks and calling for a Boycott! What a mess!
"What a value trap....sell, sell, sell....I am there to buy as many as possible....looking at their financials and reports they are making money."
"Under Armour, Inc image is garbage. They are finding themselves on the wrong side of history. image/perception is the hardest thing to change. This company is ripe for a takeover."
This win will help to promote Curry’s UA shoes and other apparels.
"Well, what did we think of Plank on Mad Money?"
"Not an investor but definitely smart timing. Right before holiday, everyone will forget!"
can this really continue to grow at this rate??
The only people wearing under armour are little kids and older wanna be tough guys in their 60s
I'm long as long gets. It will go up I travel all over the world and I see more and more ua . Mexico loves ua by the way . Mexico City airport looks like a ua store
BTW..... UAA cant keep the Curry 4 Magic on the shelves in China. On back order for 6 months.. thats in China. People blowing up social media trying to get a pair.. look it up. Short UAA please... youre gonna owe Ameritrade 100% of your current balance. Dummies
Just don't get it.......great 3rd quarter report etc etc. Someone on the inside knows something we don't know------as usual. How far get it drop today??? Sitting here watching and waiting to make a buy....
Supply chain disrupted due to corona virus. This is headed to below 15$. Time to back up the truck at below $15...
Covered my short yesterday near the lows then reshorted it at end of day on the reasons why I said I shorted it to begin with confirmed by investors day comments from CEO. Another restsiker reporter AH yesterday on GarageBand numbers and a huge miss in ref and earnings. Broke consumers living on credit will not buy UA products like many where think they will
"The press is on the Nike bandwagon, they don't even talk about the Nike. Oregon project or how China is boycotting Nike."
Their new 300$ shoes sold on out their website within minutes of opening wow wow wow
i SOLD my calls half position @200% profit and seems too early.
No sign of support in sight
"International Asia Market for UA - Check this out2016 Sales in Asia to date - $188MM2017 Sales in Asia to date - $309MM That is a 63.9% growth. Asia market for UA is such an untapped market that people don't even realize. Even if there is a small decline the next coming years in the US market, if you look at the Asian market 5 years from now let's say a conservative 50% increase in sales yoy which is def doable, you will get $2b+ in sales for 3 operating quarters. No doubt Curry will have a influence in China market for sales which will help contribute to the UA international bottom line. If you guys are ever in Asia, check out some UA retail stores but most importantly look at the kids playing basketball in China and what Jerseys they are wearing and who their favorite bball player is. Kobe is gone and kids love Curry. That's just a fact. US market will eventually pan itself out but it is the Asia market that eventually will be the money maker in the long run."
"And i was not a shorter, i thought this would happen but i cannot invest in something what is soooo ugly. Lululemon is the new thing here in europe also"
Sam Poser is a moron
"Upgrades are so bogus with nothing to drive it.Every time I’ve seen these upgrades, or downgrades, the stock went exactly the opposite way."
Glad I bought in pre earnings under $18. This is a good brand and UA continues to innovate. Long term hold.
they beat eps
"My family will never purchase any additional UA products. Plank is a grand standing idiot. If he thinks he is taking the moral high ground , then he is a fool."
WHERE DO YOU THINK UAA WILL STAND AFTER ER?
This company is still a mess! - Disastrous past 3 years in relation to earning calls - Strip club scandal(s) - Executives leaving/getting fired - Ugly shoe line that is not improving
37 FPE with a PEG 2.33...this thing still has some down side!
Kevin Plank will NEVER do it. He won't invest in a money losing proposition like UA. He has made his money from it and is now running it into the ground.
Aeropostale part 2
Boycott Nike. Buy Under Armour.
NKE has obviously helped UAA
"I think that Q1 is going to show some good sales, last 4 were good as well,"
earnings season UA good for 11 bux
lol spending shareholder money to let it rain at strip clubs. no wonder the stock price is so low
The earnings are quite great?! Expected -600Mio and it was just -150Mio. That‘s quite an outlook for the next quarters and years to come. 
Curry 4 Shoes seem to be selling well.
Every time I think about buying this a buffet quote comes to mind. Be greedy when others are fearful. Think I’m gonna add to my positions today.
"ALL EYES ON ME.......PLEASE VOTE ON THIS PROPOSAL.VOTE ""THUMBS UP"" IF YOU WANT KEVIN PLANK FIRED.THANKS FOR VOTING."
The cowardice displayed by the UA CEO in abandoning Americans and President Trump like a pathetic coward - - - made me liquidate my team's 26000 newly purchased shares. Under Armour is now uninvestable until and Kevin Plank is gone.Plank is a detestable girlie man...horrible human being. I wouldn't want him associating with anyone in my family. President Trump should find a way to punish him further.
"LOL! Another article from Motley Fool. These guys are complete clowns. They are continuing to double down on that stupid short bet. Sending their renders into losing their money. Hey Motley Idiots, this stock already has a 27% short float. You're about to get bagged!"
"UAA discloses cv will have negative impact on earnings, fall big. They don’t have near the exposure oversees which has hurt them. Nike on the other hand discloses nothing about cv impact, has huge exposure overseas and goes up, crazy"
UA cleated featured in super bowl ... that is good Plank!
"Can someone please explain the following:Respectfully kneeling as a peaceful protest to the well documented problem of police brutality = Traitor.Trump insulting gold star parents, bashing and disrespecting a war hero (McCain) and selling us out to the Russians = Making America Great Again.Something is terribly wrong here?"
uaa back to 22 next week
In the end the people who stand with trump will get the last laugh
I see this reaching $7 soon
"UAA at $18.68??... it's time to BUY (I'm not kidding). Don't listen to the idiot-""analysts"" who say otherwise. UA is still growing 9% (much higher than Nike), and on a price to sales basis, UA is 70% cheaper than Nike, and 20% cheaper than Adidas! BUY now, you'll be up 80% a year or so from now."
I think UA blows out revenue numbers. All I see is UA apparel at my gym in one of the middle country red states.
"Here's the thing with UA, it might drift lower until it performs better, but once any minor turnaround or positive news or upgrades hit, it will pop 20-30% due to being a big name. Personally I think they should move out of shoes and focus on clothing. I am seeing it everywhere from the gym, to high school games, to pro games, to kids and think they have a strong product. Time will tell. Long 1600 shares @ 15.98 purchase price."

anyone surprised this is rallying the day after Plank is #$%$ off his athletics about his Trump comment
"Make better shoes! I compare hiking boots, court shoes and urban hikers to Danner, Nike, Columbia and Merrel. All 4 are much better than UA. Hire a couple of experts from these companies. Over pay if you have to. If they don't turn the product around, get new experts. This can be done."
"As a publicly traded company, wouldn't UA have been required to disclose the probe when it first started over 2 years ago? Or did they and the news is just resurfacing? Can't claim to know anything about disclosure requirements, but I'd be very surprised if it's optional especially given it's a federal investigation as opposed to some he said she said civil claim."
I took some pictures from Macys - very messy UA section and Addidas already encroachs in
"inventory gonna be the key, along with guidance. good luck longs , I'll cover around 12.40"
"So let me get this straight. Stock is up because KP told Crammmer that he has been ignoring the company for years. That's like saying we had a huge fire but it wasn't as bad as the news made it out to be. OMG, longs are desperate."
Have you guys noticed this stock went up in June and July every year since its IPO?
UA needs to penetrate the European and Asian markets to get back on track. The way to do this is with a major sponsorship of a soccer team.
"And hiring all these newbees, just putting em further in debt!!"
I think we will see 17$ today...solid quarterly earnings. Lets do it!
"I correct myself, nike does make boots, but I dont know anyone who owns them."
That’s what they get for hiding it. It’s a broken company now. This is “do not touch”
Investments and analyzing retail is my business. I am good at it. UA has the best brand name recognition of anyretail product. My wife worked as a manager in the highest grossing store they have. This company should be shamed for the way it is managed top (Kevin Plank) down. It is squandering opportunities at a precious time in a retail company'sdevelopment.
John did you short this stock so low?.. why did you do that man?!..
"q4 could be worst see this crashingbelow $7 a share ,"
5 years from now UAA will either be at minimal double what it is trading now or zero. I'm betting on at least a double.
Now the libtards want to discriminate against strippers! Sickening.
AH up 20% what is the news????
"Sky is falling? Typical bashing when people should be accumulating UAA! The real investors know the truth. Free paid media news is not really free. You follow them, you are enriching somebody but not yourself."
whats the difference between UA and UAA??
bought so much average down to 15.55
Real stock value is actually projected at a high of $15
dismal sales to crash under armour
You're a absolute fool if you think Under Armour is going anywhere. Theres a reason Nike hasnt bought UAA... its because they cant you fools! They cant get the shares! Plank and the board are quietly accumulating their stock back and in 24 months UAA will be so expensive youll puke. Dont be a dead money fool...use your brain. Nobodys buying Under Armour... Pfffff as if! Biggest lie ive ever heard
"SOLD! There just isnt anything positive going on with this company. Order 3 things from their web site and it comes in 3 different shipments. The web site has more different items than Ebay, their best selling items probably sell less than 100. They dont have their logistics in order at all. I do see people wearing their clothing, and I like everything I have from them, but that doesnt mean the stock is a good buy. I just dont see anything positive here and dont see that Monday's earnings report is going to be anything but completely horrible with no light at the end of this never ending tunnel of doom other than an oncoming train if you are so unfortunate to own the common."
"when is earnings date, I thought it was today pre market"
UA is down 10.07% to 6.70
"the report is not good but people are still buying,"
Why are Class C shares trading at a price a few dollars lower than regular UA shares? Seems like those of us who owned UA pre-split are screwed. The Class C share price does not seem to move at all?
Careful ppl...... Analysts Bearish sentiment on UA still Extremely high
This stock is in no-mans land... wouldn't touch it till at least summer '18.
It all goes back to Steph Curry's injury! LOL
I just wonder how much stock is Stephen Curry broker buying today ?
Dumped all as I can ... wont be trapped when it falls to $13 again
Ua going down with all the other spoiled athletes. Just watch steph curry just gave his middle finger to america. He shoots a basketball. He is a nothing
They will do ok not great
"Hey again guys... this caught my eye again since it's so down today... should I go back to shorting this garbage? Was a nice profit last time around ,)"
overvalued i think for now. LT not sure
Will be RED soon what happened?
OMG THIS IS EN FUEGO!!!! ONLY $44 A SHARE OFF ITS HIGH!!! BACK UP THE TRUCK!!! HOUSTON WE ARE READY FOR LIFTOFF!!!

I went in the White House with nothing I came out a multi millionaire. Clintons

$9 stock
"AFTER WHATS BEING SAID , UAA NEEDS TO GET A M&A DEAL, OR SIMPLY BOT. TAKES CARE OF THE SHORTS TAKES CARE OF THE SPACE SUIT IDIOT MAYBE WE GET $22 or a Macy's stock"
The stock price has been awful the past few months but showing some small strength lately. It has lost its way but still has some branding power with Tom Brady and others. I am staying with it. It would be a good fit for LULU and at a cheap price.
I just need to see 20-21 and hopefully ER keeps momo going higher.
"i like how uaa is green today, of all the days"
Nice Report. Expectations were so low. Need to do this again in current quarter. Results continue to improve. Credibility is restored. Valuation continues to improve. Traders want momentum up - and down. They have short term memories and have already put the fall mess in the rearview. Shorts will be covering at the open and should drive higher.
UAA reached a 52 Week high at 23.47
"$10.73 once, i think we should sue BOA ANALysts"
I think earnings come out next week...best guess on how much UAA is down for the quarter?
Just Lost All Respect for this company.....taking co-workers and others to strip clubs with the company money.....WOW....beyond tacky and a waste of investors monies
A few large share price upgrades and UA crawls along the bottom of its earnings bounce. Majority of those buying this are the ones who believe the upgrades. I do not. Please show me anything in global data or in the US that shows robust strength. Consumers more tapped out on debt that ever and are pulling in on credit card use with higher int rates. Someone is selling you the shares you are eager to buy. Ask yourself who? I'm on my 2nd short in UA since the earning bounce.It isn't moving higher for a reason. Smarter $ selling you the shares you want.
Next resistance is at 21.75 aprox
"buy on any weakness, the trend is changing on the stock, we will keep going higher and higher, my next target is $23-24 range."
only g ays and school teachers wear under armour
buy it under $10. it's not worth $14 or $15
"Don't really understand how such a good product does so poorly as far as pps, maybe time to change up the management team or stop paying so much for endorsements. I know in my sons high school they have dropped Nike and gone with ua. I see ua everywhere so it's selling but can't tell by their stock"
"The 3 day EMA crossed the 8. Good sign for an increase now,"
"#UA closing 2000-3000 retail doors. Not 200-300, but 2-3k doors.....do your own due diligence."
"Really 20,s hmmmMay be few months down.."
"UA are too tight, too slow and don't want to expand there product rapidly. It's not even worldwide as far as getting their apparel out there to be bought. It is not at full capacity. Wish the big dogs at UA would move it. The name UA sells itself."
"This company’s future is in the hands of future ownership. Also, shoes that aren’t ugly as sin will help."
"what's the difference between ua and uaa, votes?"
bought more!
There is around $1 billion dollars that still has to cover. Any added buying pressure is really going to lift the stock. Guys like Sam Poser are going to cover in the 20's and lose their firms tons of money. I think he needs to be avoid talking about fashion/apparel/sports.
"70% of their sales now go thru discounters, no one wants it"
"My prediction: UA will beat expections by a lot, but the stock will still go down and John will still call UA garbage"
Well darn it again. I am so good at consistently buying at the worst possible time. There must be a way to make money on this
List of SOME UA Athletes:1) Tom Brady2) Julio Jones3) Cam Newton4) Bryce Harper5) Clayton Kershaw6) Aaron Judge7) Steph Curry8) Jordan Spieth9) Michael Phelps10) The Rock
"Push It, Push it...."
Definitely something shady going on. Just looking at the numbers. Look at the net income and compare it to their peers. They are definitely hiding money to save on taxes.
$8-$11 stock
I bought three UA hoodies over the weekend. I thought the styling and fabrics were much better than the other brands. Now I am considering the stock.
"I don't know about you but the gym I go to people only wear UA & Nike. Adidas is scarce. Honestly IMO Under Armour used to be an ugly brand with no big athletes wearing it. Now I regard UA as one of the best, if not my favorite, brand. I think peoples perceptions are being changed about the brand and people are loading up on Under Armour. Also, I'm 25 years old just an FYI."

"Steph curry endorsement, upgrades from JP Morgan, good earnings momentum. AU stock price flat. What gives. I’m waiting to unload."
Kevin plank is confident...he hasn't bought a single share. Z
"earnings obviously will not beat. or maybe they will but not by much. guidance will probably be good, with dropping ucla and cal. that's a huge savings. Their online ordering system is getting better, however the shipping is terrible. Turn around time for online returns, extremely terrible. it took me 1 month to get credit for a return. They should concentrate more online ordering platform instead of in store purchases, like department stores. save money on inventory and on shipping. We might be in this epidemic situation for many years."
UA will be Hot during holiday season.They shake you out first with bad news after exaggerated Bad News....Fear Fear Fear....By January Nothing but UPSIDE SURPRISE......so people jump on the bandwagon for the next Gold Rush.We are dealing w human Greed and Fear.
UA currently has a market cap of approximately 1/18th of NIKE yet UA's stock price per earnings is not even double that of NIKE...I'm holding and buying the dips.
"HERE IS THIER PROBLEM THIER STUFF IS NOT COOL ANYMORE,ALOT OF PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO WEAR THIERSTUFF"
Under Armour is up 5.30% to 16.85
Down $100 k on this stock. Never in my life could predict I'd get crushed this badly. The pain I'm feeling is just miserable. Praying this company does something to turn it around or issue a statement.... something
Wow.. tanking.. head fake. .
"Up here in the great north , I am biking a lot and so many bikers , joggers whomever are wearing Under Armour, this is nothing new but at least now they are not buying it in discount stores. Give UA a few more years and UA stock price will be looking like Nike or Lululemon. ,"
They should produce some watches ... like garmin. The HOVR is amazing
Welcome to the new reebok...at least let got a billion from it...hasnt rebought a single share
Up $4-$5 tomorrow
How about a nice pull back opportunity? Anything below 32 a share seems like a steal heading into the holiday season for me.
"On Monday night, Curry took 11 three-point shots in a game against the Philadelphia 76ers. He missed all of them. It’s only the fourth time in NBA history that a player has gone 0-11 or worse from three-point range in a single game, according to ESPN."
Earnings will be the end of the teens for this stock .
"Stephen Curry will drop UA soon and go for Nike or Adidas. No athlete wants to be a part of a failing brand, or at least a failing stock. Think of how much money Steph has lost from this deal. The stock depreciation took away a good chunk of the money he made from the contract deal. Once he drops UA it is likely others will follow suit. Steph can no longer save the UA brand."
Why is this company losing money?? LOL
"4Mvp, is 8 comment in 20 minutes really necessary. This is a conversation board, not somewhere you hang out when your bored."
Risk Reward 2 up 10 downYou decide Lmao
"Relax people - the company isn't dead or dying, they just aren't the same upward tear they were before.. You'll be fine. Just hold long term.."
"No doubt the shyster lawyers will jump all over this. There will be class action lawsuits. At the end of the day, shareholders will lose more."
Hey guys that was not a great report. the accountants tried their best to make things look good. All they have done is spent more money to achieve a greater loss.
"NKE's market cap is reaching 100B, ADDYY 43B and LULU 10B.UA is just 5,6BI don't think UA will be the next NKE, but it makes sense that 5-10 years from now UA can be at least a 20B company, mainly due to international growth.That's a x4 investment.Rough numbers but just buy and hold :)"
"better earnings, less expenses, less taxes...I think it's a good outlook"
Growing revenue and profits year over year with a PE in the 40s...... seems undervalued to me.
Is UA Fkd?
Upgrades coming....retail coming back...load up!
"Under Armour stock is GOING TO ZERO. EVERY WEEK IS ANOTHER NEW 52 WEEK LOW.KEVIN PLANK IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST CEO EVER!!!!!PLEASE RESIGN KEVIN, BEFORE YOU DESTROY WHAT IS LEFT OF THIS COMPANY'S MARKET VALUE."
"Not sure if Richard knows what he is talking about. I go to the gym and see people of all ages wearing UA gear. I see it all over equipment and uniforms while watching the tube. The one thing I have noticed, I don't see many women wearing the UA logo. I think they need to get into soccer more so they can get more into the Euro and Africa."
"This is Extremely OVERSOLD. The stores are doing GREAT. The brand is GREAT. It will rebound to $20's soon. Remember, HOLIDAY SHOPPING SEASONS are ongoing and GOOD for UA. Long and Strong!"
Wondering if UA getting out of the College Area?
2.5 year old issue. old news with no effects on current or forward earnings or cash flow.

Under Armour is selling at 75x forward earnings. Looks expensive especially with Nike doing more direct sales and increasing market share-
"Entered the June 1st exp 16.5 calls @ $1.25 , feels like a solid entry , asset was at $17.30 . Only paying about $50 in premium. Will keep my stop loss around $.85 , any other active option traders with an opinion?"

UAA is up 7.64% to 10.43
"Open letter to Under wAre longs. STOP using sleazy marketing tactics to sell your Chinese junk to kids. Your junk is the same as all the other Chinese junk. As is the case with all junk dealers, you try all sorts of branding tricks to mesmerize kids into buying your junk. You try to make them feel inferior if the buy the competitors' junk, and superior if they buy your junk.Stop it. Stop the brain swizzling and targeted ads. You know that kids are impressionable, and impressionable is the only tool you have to sell your junk. Stop it."
Before 12-12-2018 UAA above 25 $
Plank selling rest of his shares!
17.2-18 today - IMO
Going to $31
Going to close strong. Could see 23.50-24.00. Ive been right on this one. Sell now at your own risk.
Law firm investigation of UA’s board of Directors
"Stock upsideWall Street doesn’t see a further upside to Under Armour stock or for any of its close competitors. UAA stock is, in fact, projected to fall 31% over the next 12 months. Nike, Lululemon, and Columbia Sportswear are expected to fall 10%, 4%, and 3%, respectively, over the next 12 months."
Another upgrade this morning from Cowan & Co.
"Vraiphil is full of itHoe about oil company shares or bank, way worse. They are all the same"
This increase is well overdue. Can see it hitting $17 soon
"Cutting to get to profitability made sense. Finally beating expectations that had previously been re-stated down 3x is not worth throwing a parade. It only shows that they are figuring out how to do IR correctly. Now they have to figure out how to invest to grow, something they haven't done in roughly 3 years. With Frisk standing firmly on the investment switch, it'll be a challenge but something they will eventually have to do for any real growth. Interesting to watch develop over next 4 quarters or so."
"good to see incompetent executives leave. now its plank's turn to sell UA to Amazon so he can go back to play moon shinning and motel 6. UA is a great brand, it deserves better than ""i lost focus"" after dropping more than 50% value"
"Though not an investor in UA, just thought you all may be interested that the company's products are making inroads among Brazilians (I live in Bz half the year). The Bzn market is huge and they have plenty of $$ to spend on fashion (capital of plastic surgery). I think it is just the beginning of things down here."
People who workout for the most part are independent thinkers not brainwashed by the media brainwashing and race baiting. I see everyone at my gym wearing UA products and the stores are packed is all the research I need. Spring is here and people are flocking back to gyms at record levels driving sales. UA is eating Nikes Lunch WE KNOW
"The writing has been on the wall for a few quarters...poor strategy and leadership along with poor product has driven this once star into the ground. As I have said before, when is the BOD and C-level team going to be held accountable? They literally have made the wrong decision at every turn over the past 10 quarters."
Revenue beat but at the expense of lower margins.
Sell now .... Don't be left holding the Bag ..... Sound Familiar ?
"Revenue estimates at 1.13B are too low. This is under Q3 of 2019 and look at what happened with LULU, DKS, and NKE sales. All tanked in 2nd quarter with a huge rebound 3rd quarter. Trying to value this off earnings, when negative or close to 0 is a fool's mistake. NKE trades 4x sales, LULU 10x sales, UA 1x sales."
"Now that we have settled with the SEC and cleaned our books from prior torment, expect record earnings. Nike and Adidas ain't got nothing on $UA. $UA has already taken some market-share. Expect record earnings."
To everyone who is saying that no one wears under armour and that theyre second tear need to understand that it doesnt need to beat or get near nike or adidas for you to make money lol
"Well we have tim coppens on who can elevate the brand, and the rock. Lets have a former wwf wrestler design his collection haha what a joke!"
All it will take for this stock to be trading in the $35-$50 range is one upgrade and the next earnings beat in August. This thing will be flying!!
Lots of discounts out there at retail for UA.. North America still stagnate?? Will Frisk's plan ever take hold or is doubt creeping in? My guess is Larose (MD for NA) is the next exec thrown overboard by Frisk and his internal followers.They've been finding ways to rid exec payroll since he got there in 2017 for both cost savings as well as new blood that are more his team vs Plank.
The new look for Yahoo Finance is awful! PLEASE bring back the old one.
F plank take care of your wallet
Misty Copeland released....highly paid to bad mouth UA...good riddance...
"let's hope for a beat and strong guidance otherwise, it's down a few bucks"
UAA is up 11.24% to 11.58
WHY IS THERE UA AND UAA
I did sell most of my calls.. Just kept few in case of breakout to 27-29 in next 5 weeks.
Thoughts on earnings? Tuesday morning right?
UAA is down 15.17% to 9.17
Pre-market looks nice
write $16.5 put is better
"Mr. Kevin A. Plank Chairman, CEO & Founder simply is useless. If this company is to survive, this man has to go. If this step is not taken immediately you will surely see after some sideways movement at this new level, 9 to 10 share as the next stop. If you think there is a 37 million plus short out there for nothing on this name, just take a look at the chart and you will perfectly understand. As the year comes to an end no one will want to own this name so pressure will continue."
Sometimes we can OVER think the market... forget about Kohls/DSW and all the above! The brand has their #1 Guy and their #1 product on prime time TV in a rubber match against the #1 player in the world! And UA is up. Not a lot to think about! 
Currys vs jordans..anyone?
Big bounce. 10m miss. Peanuts to a blue chip retailer. Int’l sales fab. Up up and gone.
Manipulation at it's best.
OK. Morgan Stanley didn't do very well on the research analyst and used a wrong statement against Under Armour! I don't care Nike because i love Under Armour the unique's design for better athlete sportswear. The shirts and pants and shoes make me feel special.
13B down to 5B. How long it will get back to 13B. Take your $$$ out and put it somewhere else.
gonna buy more puts 5 dollars a share april
all in @ $9/share
Wow.. fell off a cliff.. probably go much lower.. bad management
#$%$ mate thougt i was golden when i got in at 20... ...
Big share dillu coming. Running out of cash.
Jonny boy nobody would want to buyout UA even at these depressed levels this thing is a shrinking ship will go BK soon my friend
Taking bets in how long until Richard starts flapping about dead cats..... I'm saying tomorrow 8am
"UA stock already going down, are the big dogs slowly pulling out before the big dip, to leave all of us hanging with the losses......AGAIN!!????"
there are nearly 2900 post here and 2000 or so come from one short basher...John
"With Dumbrow and Parkinson both leaving, big change in creative and design of product ahead."
here we go.. 20.64 today
UA-C is trading 10% less than UA . Not sure why anyone would own this class c stock
"UA was the only stock to openly upfront say the would lose a lot with the corona virus, and it’s got punished the most."
Buying this still feel it will be the next nike but much better
"This is why you don't take ANALyst advice: Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UA) - CLSA Initiates Coverage On Under Armour, Inc. Class C Common Stock at Buy, Announces $37.00 Target"
GAME DAY!!!
"Put all this together:1. Last Friday, went up with very low volume - not a good sign.2. Now stands way above 50-day and 200-day MA - last time it happened, it went down by 35%.3. 2019 EPS estimates reduced from 35 cents/share to zero cents/share in last 90 days.4. 2010 EPS estimates down from 53 cents/share to 52 cents/share with FPE of 45 which is too high.UA should be at around $19 within the next two weeks."
"UAA shoes kind of suck, they need to rethink the whole platform"
looking for price cut in half
The reason UAA is down taking profit... Whenever they stop selling it will go up.....
The new coranvirus masks seem promising. Something tells me the mask thing is going to be around for at least a few years.
UA is a buy. Got in under 15. Good luck all!
It's not too late!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/under-armour-inc-stock-finally-184250852.html
Time to put money in this stock. It is certainly pointing north based on the chart. Looking to fill the gap in the $30s.
Thank you Colin Kaepershit!
1 year cup base pattern. All good with some profit taking today.
We are going to need a huge earnings beat to break through the resistance at 22.
"Ugh, what's the bottom?"
This might fly to $24 ?
Haven't broken 20 since the $5 crash on Jan 30th. NBA Championship tonight should push to 20.50-21 come Monday. Especially if Curry takes MVP. Good selling point?
Day Trading! Dead Cat Bounce!
Think about it like this...if you had 10B and you could buy ua outright...or you buy 10B on 10 year bonds at 3.10....over the next 10 years...what do you think is actually going to return 3B?
But muscle said it was $$$ money to be made though
"SHORTS GET squeezed, badly, at this price it's a buy"
This Cody guy is an idiot. The stock goes down by 54 cents and he things its going to crash.
More exec's leaving. GM of Team Sports most high profile. Frisk continues to clean house; cut SG&A to get to profitability.
Why is UA-c Now trading 20% lower than UA...Bad enough that UA has dropped a lot recently but also UA-C drops even more than UA everyday. Will the gap ever close??
https://twitter.com/darrenrovell/status/1276911854607118337
I hate to be the bearer of bad news guys but this is probably going to crash soon. UA hasn't been completely honest with us.
Just erase all my 35% gain like that
think it will tank on earning report
Another downdraft. Expect another dollar down at the close. Still overpriced...
"Well so much for those gains today, look at it plunging"
I'm ready to short 1000 shares at the open tomorrow for a quickie.
DKS tumbled big
How did UA fall so badly? It was the best performing stock from 2012-2016. This period included 3 stock splits and over 400% ROI for investors. What happened in the past 8-10 months that made them become the worst performing stock in the S&P 500? I am looking for specific events and decisions by management.
Million dollar question will do they in next quarter (July to September) since ppl might want buy new shoes / shirt for workout and jogging etc.
Sell now and avoid more losses.
Fly rumor that UAA is putting themselves up for sale. COLM is interested don't know who else. Guessing it would be good for LULU or AMZN and would be after MyFitnessPal is sold off
Give me 20 man. End of the Week?? Hope so. With the Nike scandal shows how rotten Nike is. UA long and strong.
"150 million accounts exposed. Big business is killing us. They don't want to pay good wages. They fight to keep unlimited immigration, and send jobs overseas to keep costs down. And now they are enabling bad people to steal our wealth.As time goes by, I'm thinking socialism, where big business is nationalized, isn't such a bad idea."
"""Teens no longer like UA"" .... if ive ever heard BS ... this is it. Every teen i see has UA on at least 2 parts of their bodies. Thats the quote i was waiting on... im STRONG buying now."
"Kevin Plank made his money and forgot about the stockholders, Now he wants to make Baltimore great again !"
LOL Mike has got his wife on here trying to sway people to sell their stocks. desperate times call for desperate measures.
imo i think they will have a great earning report.
$9 million? What? Gum money?
It is about time that this company has positive momentum going for it. Could be very good and profitable summer starting with Golden State and Curry winning NBA Title.
bot a lot of clothes from it
There sure are a lot of WISHFUL thinkers on this board. LOL
Dead Cat Bounce today .... Get out now ...... That's all !!!
Watch the rally up in UA Friday pre-market until earnings. After earnings you won't see the 20-23 range anymore
Are people going to boycott UA because they are supporting the kneeling players at the NFL games?? UA is a major sponsor of the NFL. I got some UA stuff.... but I ain't buying any more until they clarify.
Bought 2000 shares today as I believe the bottom is in or very close to being in. Only time will tell.
"This stock market cap is 7B, compare to LULU at 47B and Nike at 217B.Target price : 30 B market cap at least.. that’s 60 per share.This stock has 2 tailwinds as Corona goes away : retail stores will reopen and sports events at all levels will start up."
"High fly stocks like UA at risk if economy slows down as result of FED action today. Inflation is not a problem, so why FED didn't oblige Trump and reduce rates to grow economy faster just in time for election in 2020? Trump will fire Powell!"
bought 6000 shares at 6.98 when everyone was saying bankruptcy. im going to ride it to $20 and beyond. El-Erian is now on board. He was ceo of a trillion dollar Pimco. This should be a no-brainer for him.
PR interest seems low overall by UA. sales may go up
GREAT NEWS!!!!
Shorts losing their shirts. Squeeze them till their eyes pop.
"There are a lot of ""experts""that are disregarding the turnaround that is already beginning and showing some early results that are indeed surprising these ""experts "" and the big surprise was revenues . The ""experts "" remark that sales increase was substandard in the US and it was but not so bad when they were predicting a loss . They damn by feint praise the international business is displaying an excellent future. The stars that endorse are first rate and so is the investment opportunity. It just might not cost as much to restructure as Plank is estimating as I am sure he wants to be conservative and never disappoint the street again and go back to beating the street. Believe me nothing better than having some extra reserves around . This is being bought by some shrewes buyers right now, watch and see if I am correct,"
"Hey Plank, go buy Patagonia so you can own something that is trending the right direction."
Finallly a good earning. Strong presence overseas.
I extend my sincerest THANKS to short sellers who bought back borrowed shares today ! See you @ 13 soon.
curry4 is all sold out. that said enough!
bed bath beyond crashed retailers are in trouble
look at where it was on apr. 30th before the sell off on tue & tell me great earnings!!!
is UA going to be a turnaround story in 2018?
UA is going to be at $25 in July.Keep selling and I will keep buying!!!
about to go reedddddd
UA is up 4.92% to 18.13
Time to update the Share projections to at least 25.00
"Another day......another new 52 week low.HOW MUCH MORE CAN THIS STOCK LOSE? AS OF 9:11AM, ABOUT $18.51 MORE TILL WE HIT ZERO. FROM OVER $50 IN 2015, TO $18........THANKS KEVIN PLANK FOR YOUR ABYSMAL LEADERSHIP.CALL THIS PHONE NUMBER KEVIN FOR A CONGRATULATORY MESSAGE......1-800-YOU-FAIL."
i hold US UA shares. in the UK UA apparel is the prestige sports clothes to wear. in my golf club nike and other makes are being pushed out by UA. UA is very well supported in the uk. i think most people are bored with the traditional brands. im holding onto stock
"20 minutes since opening bell down 4% with over 1,000,000 are traded. Financial institutes to make a decision this morning, do I stay of do I go. Shares traded could = 10,000,000 today. UA = Titanic."

"Money rotation from continual sell-off in tech stocks? : )Don't forget to load up on UA goodies for your Xmas gifts.We're going higher, much higher. GLTA"
"All this talk about merger or acquisition is a bunch of nonsense. Under Armor has nothing to offer that Nike , Adidas or Reebok do not have or need. I bought in at the $10 range and am holding but not because of it being a take out candidate. This is a good company that is severely undervalued."
What are your realistic expectations for er? Big beat? Blood bath? As predicted?
UA all the way! !
Maybe you can send some free shoes to that #$%$ wipe obama
Another Down day for UA .... Don't be a Bag Holder .... Get out Now.You can always buy it back at $13 - $14 After Q3 and Q4 Losses .... UA will be forced to announce a new management team and reorganization .... UA will be a good BUY at $13
"Funny, they report no earnings, have a near loss of $10 million, add to the debt, increase inventory by 27% and everyone gets excited. P.T. Barnum is alive!"
"Under Armour is struggling, and the departures of its chief designer and CEO last year don't inspire much confidence in a quick turnaround. It is still facing a Securities and Exchange Commission probe over potentially inflated sales in 2015 and 2016, and its stock price is ridiculously overvalued at way more then 70 times next year's earnings - one of the biggest in a brutal industry marked by many failures and closures"
"Overhyped earnings killing shareholders,it's a crime!"
Under Armour is up 8.04% to 18.95
How did this seller of performance wear become such an underperformer. Maybe they need to find someone like LuluLemon to run their business. UA used to be a go to brand.
UAA is taking business away from all the other Consumer Non-Durable companies. UAA hit it's valley and has been blowing away the competition. Expect a blow out earnings report!
Is UA affected by the Hanjin bankruptcy?
Shorted 200 shares @ $15.19 Wednesday. Hoping for $14’s April.
how come we have a UA AND UAA WHATS THE DIFFERENCE ?
Strong dollar hurts this company
"I have never been a shareholder. I loved (emphasis past tense) their products. I will buy no more. Target, Starbucks, Under Armor, Merck, and more CEO's should stay out of politics. Their fiduciary responsibility is with their shareholders and their employees. There may already be shareholder lawsuits in the works. I do not follow the stock and am commenting only after seeing an article on the company."
I got in at 19 a share but what are you going to do ! sell and take loss and loose half your position or just stay here and see what happens..I really have no choice but stay and see what happens...I really believe this company is going to be bought out by LuLumon or Addidas not sure about Nike they might ..it's possible Sketchers might buy the company but I believe it will be bought out
"Hard to believe LuLu market cap is 10x that of UA. When market sentiment toward UA turns, I believe UA will skyrocket."
I'm loving all these sellers pushing this stock down. Next month we'll reap the benefits.
Well......I am this close now to selling my lots bought at $32. What a loser this stock has been for me. Will we see a $16 handle today? Jesus H. Christ.........the bloodbath in retail continues. The irony is that my Amazon stake is also tanking. Go figure......
"improving margins and a smaller forecasted sales growth next qrt. sales will beat, margins improve. the 2.5 year inquiry has nothing to do with forward forecast. Way oversold yesterday. Buy the hAircut. it grows back."
"Kids just don't play sports any more, and they certainly don't wear sports gear for every day clothes. This company is going to go the way of the dinosaur..."
"Not one single extra follower, thats just a useless view"
Any insight or suggestions to how UA will do on their earnings report?
very nice open +17
"lol why do people invest in these kind of companies? if you look at the financials they dont look so good. P/E horrible, P/BV horrible, Debt/Equity horrible, current ratio horrible. Way to much risk here.. is everyone ""hoping"" for a bounce back? or why do people invest with their gut feeling?"
could this stock go under $10?
Anything under 35 is a gift Enjoy
buy pullback now.We could see close around 24.2-24.4 range today
Soon We will reach to 200SMA $15.50ish :)
Congrats Warriors!! UA Back up to $30's ???
Went to Universal Parks. Place was wall to wall UA gear and shoes.
Time for the buyout. Join with another co and it will be big player in the market.
I HATE this NEW yahoo Finance page.
LOOK OUT BELOW!
"I'm surprised to see UA up today, they are an NFL sponsor. Just a matter of time until more conservatives put two and two together and drop UA products. Why can't Kevin Plank ever be on the right side of a controversy?"
Is $30 realistic for 2019. Spike would imply 50% from current levels. At $30 I’m out of this stock.
Once the stimulus package pass the senate Next week ...UAA see you $30
to easy to pick out all the shorts on this board..Yea like you JOHN and NSIP
What's the diff between UA and UAA? Which is the best long (has greata beta?)?
Everybody’s panic.... I think the trend is up.... The revenue is not bad..........
Shorting
My average cost about $25. Nike should take this company over and put it out of misery!
UAA is up 10.40% to 22.88
"I’m short, obviously hoping this story gets traction. If those two clowns were on cnbc pumping their business while knowing it’s down the drain, then that is abominable. If this is just a misunderstanding, then that’s okay. Tomorrow will tell."
"Plank just cost his company big time, by separating himself and company from Trump, he separated himself for these who purchase his products. I to would be out of this stock and company but, am a big loser here also. I might still take my loss and get away from this company. Plank and UA are done."
UAA HEADED FOR BANKRUPTCY?
Selling right before earnings. The fundamentals are horrible. The stock had some momentum but it eventually gonna go down. It’s gonna take all 2018 before the company is profitable again
UA reached a 52 Week low at 14.58
Where is the overweight analyst with his $8 prediction...lol
Shorts have fessed up and realized which way to go!!
"The next time KD is in the team huddle, he should look down at the guys feet that has won more championships than he has."
My $8 call for tomorrow isn’t looking too good
Agree Curry is too political but so is Johnson. I don't think a Michael Jordan type athlete exists anymore.
Dud company ...even their products are just barely ok
I'd expect a 5-10% decline this 27% decline is a mistake. buy the dip
The earnings and growth momentum cannot support this stock price for long. The wall street wolves are waiting around the corner. You cannot lose when you take a profit.
"New spring merch is in stores. Looks good, check it out. DC store busy with buyers 11am Thursday. This will be a good spring season for ua, look for NA sales growth higher than expected."
Maybe back from the grave??
Does under armour have pricing power. That’s the key question. I suspect they have a little but not much. I’ll pass
25 bucks a share damn get the lube out shorts
who deleted all the positive comments on this board? someone big trying to run the price down? and why?
I hope UA starts a patriotism campaign now!!!
What this rumours UA is for sale..Businesses thinking about acquiring Under Armour face a key hurdle https://finance.yahoo.com/news/businesses-thinking-acquiring-armour-face-key-hurdle-003050108.html
Nike might wanna talk to Steph Curry about now! Called Trump an asset minus the et! Whoa!
"good luck longs, tomorrow"
Boycott will start to pick up steam after curry comments on Keven Planks comments about Trump!
UA stops expensing for strippers ! Oh nooooi!
"A past interview.... When they diverted from their mission statement..... CNBC:You had an early line that you would use. Can you tell us about it?KEVIN PLANK:Cotton is the enemy! That’s what our brand is about. To get consumers out of cotton. Get them to try performance. I believe the vision that this company has is that everyone is going to continue to expect or demand more from the products that they wear. We’re showing consumers that you should expect and demand more. You should expect lateral support, you should expect moisture management. You should expect the fact that your shirt shouldn't stink. You should expect the fact that your apparel should have UPF30 protection in it. And that your product should be able to stretch and move with your body. That’s sort of the DNA that we put into every product that we build. When we say cotton is the enemy, it means that ........"
Double digits growth
Time to shut the doors on doom predictors. A new beginning for Under Armour.
"this stock may continue to drop in the short term, but in 5 years it will be trading at $60"
"it hit 12.80 in premarket just after 7am when cnbc reported they had a big beat, glad I don't own any shares!"
Lol where are you longs?
"still waiting on my check from Plank in the loss I took,"
Less than $3 more to go UP to $20 again. NIKE should make a buy-out offer soon. When it is still cheap!
"One of these days, you righties will learn that most of the country have minds of their own and don’t invest based on politics!"
"And one last thing why ua will never come back in the near future. With apparel you smneed to see it in tiers which need to reflect society. Upper tier is upperclass, premium upper middleclass etc.upperclass - lululemon, nike, adidasUpper middleclass - sameMiddleclass - some ua with yankees, reebok, champion, adidas, nikeLower class - ua, nike, reebokNever gonna change"
Not sure why people insist on playing the low end of retail. Good way to lose your shirt
Wait until all your clothes monitor your health continuously. It will happen and UA will be the leader
This stock is GARBAGE! Kevin Plank should be embarrassed by this performance. I'm dunzo!
"One of the most inflated, fake earning release company in the stock market. Nike, Adidas struggle but they post profit ... really? Stock price should be in bottom single digit."
stop loss took affect at 20.40. kinda wish it didn't
Going to $10.
CROX and SKX on fire UA is next. What do you thinking the Yutes is doing with its stimulus money they are buying clothes and shoes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6qGwmXZtsE
UA is still too expensive based on its PE ratio. Its real value is $7.25.
"its amazes me, people still invest in these companies"
UA is failing.. gear all over discount stores.. retail prices way to high. $25 for a basic t-shirt is nonsense.
"UA website = FAIL......went to UA website ..poor..NO SPORT jumps out at you Nothing...""graphics HIGH-Schoolish""...clicked the mens menu ITEm...NO FOOTBALL or SOCCER listed in the drop down...R U NUTS..listed are golf, Running, Tennis..hahaha..thought I saw ""bowling""....I gave up trying to find soccer shoes so I typed it into the ""search"" ......went to NIKE website and had the Opposite experience.....FIX your WEBSITE...'GET"" me excited about your product......"
"My family is living in Korea, and this brand is booming now. I have no idea why CEO of Samsung was wearing this brand and showing up in public. Every one is buying this brand ever since then.."
Bad strategy compounded by poor execution and zero leadership...sweet cocktail....
"Big week next week for UA. Will be interesting to see the result of all the cutting re profitability. I would like to hear how they plan on growing again in any real way. Is low single digit profitable growth good enough for the growth investor? Or has the investor changed with the downturn? No idea. I am surprised they got out of the NFL with all the stud athletes they have. Why have Tom Brady, Chase Young and DK Metcalf if the company doesn't want to be in football?"
Heard target athletic wear is better then UA and big money is getting out of UA cause of that.
"Likewise, Curry needs shut up and play basketball!"
"While in China, my son needed some dry-fit for a hiking trip, but couldn't find UA anywhere. Lots of places this stuff would sell like bonkers that remain untapped. I hope the new guy finally gets serious about going global."
the president needs our support and walking away to please a bunch of girls in a coffee shop isn't helping..
What a joke. Media served terrible earnings as growth and the bubble is inflated even more.
"EASY.. MARKET ADVERTISE with sport superstar MESSI, Neymar, Runners, S.Curry.. And change that logo to more eye candy s#xy, slick Logo... And enjoy the ride higher.. How hard is that"
The numbers weren’t that good. Still burning through serious amounts of cash while management tries without success to “restructure” in order to right the ship. This could trend a lot lower.
Wow. I bet CEO will think twice before ranting about politics again! Good way to #$%$ off 50% of your customers!

under armour is under valued
Whisper is for a profit of .04 . I think shorts are getting nervous. They are being greedy !
Told yall to sell...new 52 week lows incoming...$14 next week....Managements silence is deafening
Red day
"Houston, we have liftoff!"
"Most of these clowns told us ""strong sell"" when UAA was below $10.When UAA goes above $50 they will suddenly tell us ""strong buy"".Complete waste of time with these ""analysts""."
OUCH
Not bad for a crashing stock- bullish longterm - SEC bs!
READ WHAT JEFFRIES IS STATING. I AGREE 100%

It’s going Red at closing

SELL NOW! Adidas just pulled out of the UA deal!
"Wow the amount of downvotes on anything neg about this stock. LOL incase if you guys can't read, it has lost 50% in a year, yes this will rebound at some point but with the current model of business expect price action in single digits post ER. I could be terribly wrong, but caution is better in this case."

"Will test 52 week lows and below in coming weeks! Shorting has intensified since Price Target was cut to $16. from $27.,Dead Money here!"
"Why is Sam Poser of Susquehanna not talking about the 2019, 10 year contract Under Armor has to outfit the MLB? This is going to add tremendously to the balance sheet. That, and the tax benefits. I think he is not being objective and is buddy's with Mark Parker of NIKE. Why didn't Joe Kernan or anyone else ask him these questions?? Why has Kevin Plank not put a statement out? Sheesh."
q4 won't get better see this crashbelow $8 by 2017 andcrashbelow $4 in 2018. 2018 next yearwill probably be worst

UA'S overseas business growing fast. Inventory from closed chain stores has been liquidated and growth is back on track in US. Nothing but up from here on. Very good news they are reporting BEFORE the market opens on August 1. If news was bad they'd report AFTER the bell. I think we see $30 by January 1.
You guys are all wrong. The stock isn't garbage. The stock AND the company are garbage. Nobody likes UA. I'll possibly potentially maybe consider buying at the $9-$12 range.
kids dont care about this#### will still buy
all losing money? Nice eh how numbers on accounts made up by banks control lives
Close around 24.2

What's the difference between UAA and UA???
Please take the pledge not to buy Under Armour products until they stop endorsing trophy killers.
Even Shaquille O’Neill couldn’t rebound this good...
"To those saying, ""I see people wearing these clothes all the time."" That is the problem. There's no money in things already purchased. Kids are already moving onto Adidas. This stock isn't going up."
I told you guys yesterday will turn to green soon. LoL

Bullish sentiment!!!
Q. WHAT IS KEVIN PLANCK'S FAVORITE SPORT?A. IT'S NOT ANY OF THE TOP FOUR AMERICAN SPORTS. IT'S SCREWING OVER THE SHAREHOLDERS OF UNDER ARMOR. KEVIN IS BIG LEAGUE AT DOING THAT. HE HAS DESTROYED $5 BILLION OF SHAREHOLDER VALUE THE PAST YEAR. WAY TO GO KEVIN. WELL DONE IN SCREWING OVER YOUR SHAREHOLDERS. YOU ARE A MASTER (BATER).
Lol I love the shorts on this board that have gotten their panties into a tussle. This is comical.
So many articles out there bashing UA this week. Market makers want the cheap shares and cheap shares theyll get. Im taking advantage too. Im in at 17.36. GL FOLKS.
What's up with the #$%$ valuations of some of these companies? It's like they IPO'd specifically to screw over shareholders. But I guess that's just how Wall St rolls.
"watching what mutual funds like TIAA do ,will be my clue, otherwise I can't believe I feel for this terrible mgmt. team"
shorts all got squeezed badly ... up 100%
Dogs of the S&P strategy must be causing some buying.
UAA is up 9.69% to 10.69
I guess shorts win out for now unless it muscles close around 16.65-16.75
"PE of 45! Are you for real with negative income and growth,Please!"
"Lucky for UAA, Nike is doing ad campaign with Colin Krapernick. This will hurt Nike sales for sure."
Susquehanna Financial Group Sam Poser - who is this stupid guy? I have reported him to SEC. Investors should bombard SEC with emails for explanation. ANALysts move stock prices.
Bought at $12 sold at $15. I will be back in if/when the price falls back in the $10-$13 range! Love this stock for a long-term play!!! Good luck to longs that stayed in.
I'm still short
"UA is a weak brand in apparel, that's it. Their competition is too great. In the 10 years I've known UA, they have yet to expand their brand awareness. If anything it got worse. All I see is Nike, adidas, and of course other designer shoes. I don't know what made you buy this, whether it was the motley fool or something else, but this is it for UA. Getting their name out there with the presence of other apparel giants isn't an easy feat. Struggling brand."
"Analysts from two unknown firm downgrading Under Armour and that tells me what is going on with the stock price. Investors are not selling it but big shorts are taking it down to cover the shares within a week. Add more shares to your account and thank me later. People who panic, loose their shirts."
Why did JP Morgan and ML ANALysts downgraded UA at the lows?
Looks like the Hedge Funds might be at it again with their shorting routine. Wait till they knock it down and buy some more!
This will not end well! buyers dried out.
lost a contract to nike for the MLB sponsorship. 2020.
UA needs to throw the bank at Zion Williamson.
$5 this week
Nike is in oregon
push it to $24 ...
In Toronto area this past weekend. Under Armour over 75 in line to get in buy products.
Shorts are piling but I was here first
You can burn Nike shoes in protest or the shoe explodes yet Nike reached another 52 week high. IMO Under Armor is an ant trying to bang an elephant. Nike just crushes its competition.
The nightmare continues ..... Get out now .... You can buy it back at $12-$13 in Q1 2018UA will have a new management team after poor Q4 results and will actively be looking for a buyout.
Increased my position in UAA after seeing yesterdays news.
The macy's store is filled with junks as I checked last time. clothes not selling well.
I'm guessing 50% of the shorts will cover before Thursday and the other 50% are just rolling the dice.
"Hope chinese maffia steps into uaa, than we can go learry high"
"Q3 Results scheduled for release Oct. 31 .... How appropriate, Halloween .... The results will be Ugly, Scary and not a Treat.Get out now .... You can Buy UA back at $11 -$12 Q2 2018 ... Don't get left holding the bag."
Plank (CEO) just dissed 57 year olds and older of not being able to learn or are unteachable. Baby boomers are if he does not know the strength of this market. Attitudes of his type of mentality are obvious reasons why the stock price is so low reaching mid 2014 prices
$15 puts....told ya buy hand over fist....next stop....sub $15
"Intraday 52 week high today. Showing some strength, but there is a lot of resistance to break 26."
To the moon let’s all agree it’s going to take Nike share from now on
"10-year uniform partnership with Major League Baseball is a huge deal, so Amazon will grab this... soon"
Problem is the only people wearing under armour are little kids and old men that think they're cool.
I have made a fortune this year short-selling UA and DEPO. Lake house paid off. Just wanted to share a success story since there are never any in here. Thank you all! UA has changed my life.
Anyone with any knowledge of technical analysis care to comment on where the support is for UAA? I am looking at it and with the markets all flashing red- I don’t want to buy in too soon.
The SEC probe continues. The worst is yet to come.
Plank is acting like Aubrey McClendon. He should concentrate lon making money for shareholders rather than building fancy digs for the co. and buying a water taxi etc. John Medura
Lol sorry UA Nike is better. UA are for red n ik
What's the difference between UA and UAA stock?
UnderArmour’s Blue Angel Midshipmen football uniforms are incredible!!! GO NAVY!! GO USMC!!
I bought UA today for the first time & guess what: All the shorts and negative statements will be of the ones who will loose. Read between the lines. Could it be possible that a neophyte investor might know when lady luck is coming.
"Not sure what Asian made wear has to do with creating Jobs in the USA anyways, Amazon doesn'tneed people to sell us those asian made clothes.... Maybe his under wear is #$%$in itself, we can bypass the middleman and buy straight from asia without their 500%ark up.. Cost $4 to make and ship a shirt and they charge $25+,, you can get the samething delivered to your house now for$12.... Plank is a Blank..."
"If you were looking for a point to cut some of your losses you just had it,don't wait too long or you'll be in the same boat if not worse in a week or two!"
will breakout to see 16.5 if not further but then it's accumulation.. let's see
Q4 WILL PROBABLY BE WORST SEE THSS CRASHINGBELOW $8 BY END OF THE YEAR OFYEARS ANDBELOW $4 IN 2018
"UA ripe for a buyout? Company struggling a bit, but worth a lot more."
"Comes down to just how believable Plank is. My gut says don’t trust the guy. Plus, I’ve always liked UA shoes recently and can’t get over the poor selection style wise, but also the lack of product in various stores, and believe me, I’ve looked everywhere. Adidas has seemed to make an incredible comeback, as I see their more stylish shoes everywhere at seemingly the expense of UA."
CEO Frisk 10 am cnbc.
I sold at 11.89 short of 1 cent of the high....just stock market
Took off my watch list. Will never buy now. Idiot CEO....will not buy it's products either.
I dont give a #$%$ what any analyst say... the company Under Armour IS WORTH MORE THAN $5.8 Billion dollars!!! I added today and ill hold how ever long it takes! Nobody will scare me off this grand slam!
Look's like UAA's massive debt and higher interest payments are catching up with the share price. Good Luck.https://www.investopedia.com/news/4-stocks-poised-fall-dollar-rebounds/?partner=YahooSA&yptr=yahoo
Are you going to sit here and watch this breakout into the $20s its coming the tape does not lie. Someone big is about to come out with coverage it wont be long for $25. WE KNOW
I think we beat tomorrow. I think international growth is pushing us in a positive direction. I see a little positive momentum with shoes with HOVR and Curry.
My target sell is $15 by now and March 1st. I'm ok with the current valuation hanging around for a little while though and buying more shares at the current price.
Watch. Kevin Plank with his controlling class C stocks is going to run this company into the ground. Then take it private again leaving all us UAA and UA stockholders with nothing but a bad memory. Oh yea. And an empty wallet.
"UA's financials look atrocious... Earnings negative, operating margin, etc.. is the stock rise baking in something coming in 2019 that I don't see?"
RUN
I will take any 18 close today if it can hold.18.5+ would be great.
"wait until wwiii with China, this stock will go to $100. all military personnel wear UA. 300 million military personnel."
"Another day, another hosing of Under Armour stock. So what is new? One of the worst companies, led by the WORST CEO in the Fortune 500. So what can you expect from this POS stock?"
What the hell happened???
Under Armour is down 4.90% to 18.04
This is top quality second to Nike..just be patient
UA reached an all time low at 10.25
"Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) was upgraded by analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc from a ""neutral"" rating to a ""buy"" rating. They now have a $28.00 price target on the stock, up previously from $24.00. 34.7% upside from the current price of $20.79"
when is the earning?
My bet is that yesterday and today an activist investor is going long.
There goes the gains
"I think even if they beat the earning, guidance will not look good! Dollar, Oil and Trade war! Interesting:) I will get up early tomorrow morning:)Good luck all"
investorplace bashed UA to $12? LOL
i feeling like this is a good stock. i see a lot of people using their products at the gym in my country.
Under Armour (UAA) - Get Report received 'Wells Notices' from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This is not a formal charge but an investigation has determined that a further explanation into the numbers reported is needed. Under Armour will have an opportunity to work with the SEC to come to a resolution.https://www.thestreet.com/investing/morning-bell-with-jim-cramer-tech-earnings-gaming-under-armour?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO&yptr=yahoo
I was not impressed with earnings as they are not even close to being profitable. If ANYTHING their losses INCREASED by another 50 million for the year. I had high hopes for UA and it looks this is going to be a sluggish year again.
2nd most shorted stock.
$UAA Upgrades Cowen Outperform USD 17 » USD 23 Maintains Morgan Stanley Equal-Weight USD 12 » USD 13
I am no short and would like to buy in don't feel the bottom yet. Stores are not moving inventory in NYC and the product like is missing something that once made it cool. Addis is eating their lunch
Will UA survive?
UA is NOT the future... ask your kids what they spend their (your) money on - Nike and Adidas
"I say sell! Last quarter they had all those hovrs, curry 4 the rock project and still no increase in ftw. One month till next quarter and no capsules have been launched so will be negative and down!"
Sticking with short term of 11.00 for UA / 12.25 for UAA. Very optimistic to think higher than that for now.
Going Red!
college fund ..I'm in at 19 ..when I bought I knew this company was in shambles ...and lost sight ..I will look at it in 9 months from now..I know it tough when market are up and UA is down ... this company going no where or I really believe Amazon going to get it or Addidas...I really believe this company going to be sold but if not DONT SWEAT IT !! it will go back up to 20 to 25 by end of year ...
Well it's about time. Say goodbye longs.
"John "" The Short ie "" back at it again..it's amazing all the negative post on here but yet the stock keeps climbing. I mean ""Hey"" I think Kevin Plank is alot smarter than Jim Cramer .Oh I'm sorry it's Jim Shamer . mark my words this stock is going higher b/c I really believe that Amazon going to either partner or purchase the company..time will tell"
We have arrived.... we have arrived.... Plowing all my previous stocks into this stock one share once a day... do the same and we will get rich together MUCH LOVE>
Way more people wear SuperDry merchandise than UA. SuperDry $300M market cap
Bought some puts today for this pos
In the short-term UA does not seem to be like a good trade. https://myawesomestocks.blogspot.com/ alerted a new stock just now. going to check it out.
need 13
Holy #$%$ is there a way to delete a commentor? This 4MVP is annoying as a kid in a candy store.. damn.
Here comes UA 
Jarold........ Your spot on again!!!
Under Armour has been quietly firing workers when they find out they are conservatives. Do not buy anything from this radical left wing company.
When it will be good buy? 5 or lower?
"What you guys think about Under Armour Sportsmask, best fitness mask on the market? It is so hot, the company can not produce enough. The price for the mask is $30, but you can sell it $50-$70 at ebay. Sportsmask contribute to UA in two ways:1) finance. Do not underestimate the sportsmask financially. It is extremely high demand and high margin. Also it may bring people to its website for other products.2) High quality brand. re-enforce its high quality brand status."
"Funds dumped big time today. We are heading south, too many downgrades - sell"
Getting very negative on these boards. That's usually an indication the stock is ready to bottom. In 2-4 years people will be wishing they bought this low. Not many good buys left in the market. However this is one of them if you have a long term outlook. UA is going nowhere and will be around for many years to come. Buy them when there left for dead.
Why is this dog down today? Perhaps Plank needs to get his gut checked after getting kicked hard by LULU and NKE for the past 3 years.
24.60 price
"Buy Nike, UA headed lower in sales"
Another 5% tomorrow
Exercised my call options . Fingers crossed
"Yeah, when it tanks to $12"
"Regarding UAA and Motley Fool, they were the reason I bought the largest position in my portfolio. It didn't work out but I don't put all the blame on them. They put me on Shopify, Mercado Libre, Cognex, Veeva, Cara, Teladoc, Activision, Kite Pharma, Illumina, Sierra Wireless, Match Group et al. Listen to them more times than not and you'll be just fine."
".Rule 1: Never fall in love with a company, fall in love with making money. Easy enough. The inverse is true of course. Never let your hatred for a particular stock cloud your judgement and lead to poor decisions. The market is always speaking. Make sure it's your head, not your heart, that does the listening. GLTA"
Whats going on Why are we selling off?
Plank you don't like what trump said ok ..... you were in a position to make a difference instead you chose to f over your stick holders.
"Few bad for those didn’t sell this morning’s brief pop, I sold $11.89, noticed I didn’t set at $11.9 because that might not execute. You’ll learn experience"
"Shhh the paper is going down, I'm going to be a millionaire !!!"
Anyone think earnings will be a $3-5 pop or drop due to 1) how volatile other retail earnings have been this year2) the fact that this is a very important ER for under armour because of how terrible the last ER was.3) depending on results either multiple upgrades or downgrades comingLet me know what you guys think.Thanks
Don't know who would by their merchandise..to expensive...stock in real trouble
"Watch the short term day trading selling start,just before close!"
another upgrade is coming. IMO
Looking good in pre market!
Without Durant Golden State won championship two years ago. With Durant making 10ft pull up jump shots and additional dunks just an insurance for no mistake like last year losing 4-3. Without Curry GSW will never be like such a team. MVP should be for Curry not Mr. Durant.
You will see a ton of ua products at tj maxx and other outlet stores. That is why revenue is going up and profit is going down.
Earnings next week . Any estimates ? Would s beat put is back to 15 ?
"Getting out before the $3-$5 drop coming from the panic mania!! Let’s be smart, it’s Xmas money I could use it for!!"
It will close at $16 today . Up Up UP
"Not today. Maybe Thursday, if the dust settles. Had to say."
"Martin, you also dont know jack. Oooh i know this and that its all about sentiment and kayla tushe."
Looks like $19 tomorrow
Pumpers might pin it to 13.2 for OE? Pumpers are amazing
out at 18.44
I lost a ton of money on this years ago because of that arrogant Kevin Plank but they have better leadership now this will never see $100 again but maybe $50
https://www.barrons.com/articles/under-armour-two-tables-that-look-troubling-1521124682
You guys are crazy. Trying to catch a falling knife. Many of you already got cut. Many still bleeding. But it seems many of you can take a lot of pain that's for sure. We'll see how long you can handle it. UA is still overvalued. More so than NKE. Stock PRICE means nothing
Kevin Stank needs to go.He's running this once great brand into the dirt!
Definitely a buy
Check out SLS ! Pending FDA approval any day for 1000 % gain !!
I won't buy Nike and UA is my go to Brand.
Even Plank's politically motivated decision to pull out of Trump's manufacturing jobs initiative will not help. Kevin is such a hypocrite and can't see the forest from the trees.
any idea how much accounting fraud boosted the revenues ?
"Under Armour Is Subject of Federal Accounting ProbeJustice Department, SEC examining how sportswear maker recorded revenueSold to you at 14"
good er
Bad news coming
Kramer says sell
Going to single digits if they couldn't make the numbers . Hope they do not cook books this time so that a new probe is invited by this B.S.
I bought Microsoft stock ten years before Bill Gates was born.
Is this current enough news for You? DUHhttps://finance.yahoo.com/video/under-armour-down-2-comments-161300085.html
uaa or ua..doe it matter
All my friends in California wish Ronald Reagan was governor again. It was much better back when Reagan was governor. Now it's full of illegals with taco stands on every corner.
Sentiment doesn't drive SP. Performance does. Where has itt been?
Still I believe UAA will go soon to $35 ...
"The believers have arrived. Sell, sell, sell!"
UAA is down 4.98% to 21.92
CRASHING! SELL NOW!
so this investigation has been going on for 2.5 ears and nothing has become of it...but WSJ decides to publish the news on the weekend before the earnings release. Sounds fair and square journalism to me!
UA is standing tough in the eye of so many critics. The company is for sure moving forward and refusing to go down! Stay STRONG Under Armour and Protect this House!!!
So i guess the upward movement was due to landing a contract with NBA Lottery pick Josh Jackson.
For the damaged shareholders here (and that includes me and just about everyone else). Here is the law firm that is taking names for the class action law suit planned against Kevin Plank and Under Armour for their lack of fiduciary execution and destruction of shareholder value:Contact: Goldberg Law PCContact them and give them your name so that you can recoup some of your stock losses in UAA.
"Is UA-C going to drop to $0? Class C and Class A are no different besides the voting rights, why is it getting penalised so much?"
"Price Target cuts coming again 2nd round as share price continues to fall,looks like $17.'s were in the cards as one analyst predicted!"
"IMO THE TURN AROUND IS WORKING,GETTING RID OF OLD STOCK AND REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE,LOOK AT LULU LEMON,SAME AS THEM,LOOKING FOR A INCREASE IN STOCK VALUE VERY SOON."
So how did ANALyst know what price should UA be?
cant pay ucla so who is next?
"Should settle around 11, but may take a couple weeks. Panic selling and overly optimistic buying going on right now."
Wow what happened?
There go the gains for today
Why $UA and $UAA has big stock price difference? Shouldn’t they be close to each other?
"Yes, they solidly continued to lose money. That is so encouraging!"
TOO MUCH GSA COSTS!
Overall I think we will see upside for UA in the short-term. Perhaps a pullback next day or so could occur I suppose but are yall also seeing a further leg higher? Im not sure about you guys but awesomeSTO-CKS has provided me with some pretty good trade ideas. I messed up executing some of them but thats on me.
"Curry Brand launch is a long time coming between UA and Curry camp. It is a make good for when Curry almost asked out of the contract a few years back and Frisk/Plank had to offer this up to keep him. Having said that, a couple of thoughts after reading the release...interesting time to launch (discount season/volume rich for retail) a an offshoot brand that will take marketing dollars away from promoting broader UA brand until (or if) Curry brand can stand up on it's own and fund itself (biggest risk to UA). Second, I question whether a brand can have a ""cause"" as well as be labeled ""premium""; it seems counter-intuitive. Last, Curry is 31 and has only a few years at most to really drive it."
"Unsold inventory means nobody is going to be buying UA's clothes this year. Guidance will be lowered, earnings will disappoint, debt will increase, and shareholders will be screwed. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: this is a single digit stock."
"just remember at $15 a share a week ago they said it was a buy rating by the analyst,,,these clowns are pumpers and dumpers,,,,,they have no real clue to what is going on,,,proof here now at 12,50, they used the upgrade to get suckers in as they shorted it"
Now what? Timber already? Lol
Did they find out the truth?https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2018/04/09/under-armour-aston-villa-soccer-club-terminate.html?ana=yahoo&yptr=yahoo
trading as index - We could see close around 23.3x if market settles down.
As a travel coach for 14U softball in Western NY .. having two girls 10yo(no sports) and 13yo(2 sports) my wife works at the middle school called Willink(section V) under a Vice Principal plus I am the commish of the www.sgatour.com.. UA is all over the school and on kids.. just like when I was 18 in 1985 and MJ was the man and Nike grabbed me... Plank is a smart man and an old athlete and it's his company. He will come back... I agree with Bernie and his reply.. it will pop!
which is a better buy UA or UAA
___ Fred. ___ stockinvestus. __ strong buy 6.50 near term
recovery seems to be stalled unless UAA gets above $22. now or done we go & probably set a new low.
witness a merger or buyout in the future ..
18.2-18.35 high target today. IMO
go up to the moom.....$100
"I started following ""awesomestokcalerts"" (Gooogle it - off course without any space or dash in between the words) and their notifications are better than anyone else."
Gets upgrade and goes down?? Must be profit taking

"Dan is a short pumper look at all his posts defending the action, make up your own decisions dont let DUMB DAN sway you"

tomorrow 22
what's the difference between UA and UAA? anybody..
I’ll buy at 4 maybe. Where is gshaun?
the HOVR shoes are crazy cool. could change the shoe game!
Do yourself a favor just buy Nike stock!
Holy coowww!!! Massive volume now !!! Booooom!!! Cover shorty!!!
I'm in at 19 bucks will see what it's worth 5 yrs from now ...Hero or Zero...
I would wait for the $11.50 to buy AU.
"If this not a bubble, what is a bubble ?"
Get ready for the pain.
Under armour runs on sports. Once sports open back up again should see this stock soaring. It’s a $30-$50 stock at $7 now
KEVIN PLANK SHOULD BE FIRED......IMMEDIATELY.TODAY'S STOCK PERFORMANCE AND THAT OF THE ENTIRE LAST YEAR SHOW THAT WALL STREET HAS LOST COMPLETE FAITH IN HIM AND HIS LEADERSHIP.UNDER ARMOR IS A BROKE COMPANY AND BROKEN STOCK UNDER KEVIN PLANK.PLEASE RESIGN BY END OF TODAY KEVIN. YOU ARE POISON FOR THIS COMPANY.
"Is SEC aware of the trick that MMs used? For example, when there are few buyers (scared), they sell to themselves to artificially drive price down."
"Applause to the folks on here and analysts who complained of UA being in Kohl's. Even though Nike, Adidas, and others are in Kohl's as well, UA was watering down their brand. Don't listen to these dummies. Do your own homework. Also, happy they are getting out of MLB deal; waste of money."
I never dreamed this stock could drop this much
"nsip is a passionate loser. I made money in the market yesterday. How did you do? All of which you stated below, like others on this board, is nothing but a SWAG. I, on the other hand, am continuing to be proven right."
Hope you bought this one before ER. I think a huge upside surprise is coming.
I think the bad time is still to come for under Armour stock
We should buy LULU and dominate the women athleisure market plus get Mirror at home gym on the side and spin it off. Still will and always be a strong #2 in the sports market to Nike.
"Huge Overreaction, with close over $20."
"i'm hearing the amazon takeover rumor, is that true?"
"This looks like the buy of the year. If it hits $15, load up the truck! UA stuff is top notch and really not any more expensive than any other quality brand. In fact, I consider it the cheapest of the upper brands."

I'll be like dwm but opposite.. stock is going to $99 guys any day!
"The amount of new UA stores opening in SE Asia makes me bullish. However, UA needs basketball sponsors similar to Nike to really hit it big there..."
The shorts need to cover there is no more for this to go down.

I like UA products!
Dip more buy more
33 Million shorts..................Gotta cover sometime :)
General Motors (GM) veteran Clay Dean became its chief innovation officer? What a joke! So Plank hires a guy who worked for twenty years at a failed car company (that the US tax payer had to bail out during the GFC) as their new Chief Innovation Officer? What a dumb move! Hire a guy who doesn't understand the apparel industry and couldn't innovate at GM. Another nail in the coffin for UA but Plank has made his millions.

Up 5 percent by week end
I’m thinking if I should sell out ? Any suggestions?
"There is an entry point to UA at these prices for a long term hold. Long term international growth will come through and domestic will recover, it will just take some time. Honestly....the fact that UA has a lower market cap that Sketchers....yes less value that Sketchers is just absurd. I see no long term risk at these current prices. Be greedy when others are fearful..."
"Mr. Plank, please go!!!!!!!!!!!"
I'm in for 500 shares
Single digits next stop.

"Brand awareness costs a lot of money! They need to sell at least a million hovrs a season. You dont know #$%$ about apparel in details, you just look at minor details and blow them up. Look im not trying to be negative i have put a lot of my money on this horse but you have to stay realistic also. 5bn company needs more than 2 best selling shoes and some tees! They need at least 10 bestsellers of a million pcs per year at least. Nike and adidas have over twenty of these"

MICHAEL JORDAN SAID REPUBLICANS BY SNEAKERS TO! BIG MISTAKE BY CEO OF UA. RIGHT WING BOYCOTT OF UA IS ON!
"Im just bored you mongoloids!Adidas keeps on killing under armour, well after the rocks collection no one needs to kill under armour! SUICIDE SQUAD"
"For every investor out there, stop making decisions based on fear... UA is an incredible company. Even more now at 19$/share. Always remember the great Buffet saying, be fearful when others are greedy and greedy only when others are fearful.Have a good day everyone!"
CEO has to go
UAA strong buy! Target to hit at least $25 by year end base on technical charts.
At 5 be a good entry
The symbol change is taking down UA. UA-C will benefit. Ultimately the prices will converge but no net addition to market cap for UA.
PE ratio of 1500 and stock jumps 7 points.
20 by Friday is possible. IMOStaying long until 20
How strong is the NFL license ?
"Seriously if under armour makes good products, all will be buying including other countries or other regions not just one and only one kind White! Warren is telling Hong Kong to buy it. lol"
"I've been watching like a lioness for this one for a long, long time. Pounced on close monday. It's time"
Is UA the same as UAA?
aint this something. almost to 15 so soon. hopefully we get a squeeze on shorts and propel this thing even further.
Waging a stock on a ballgame........get out and stay home........ really??
What a horrible stock. Ya and it’s sponsors have offended 69 percent of America
investorplace said a 14% drop to come?
i bought this stock today for the first time. I've been watching since the iPO and finally feel that it's a value and it's capitulating. Best of luck. Stop is at $10.50.
Nike was the same way in the beginning yrs until they got their #$%$ together. hopefully it's not going to be like LA gear.?
Wow are you serious UA
Buy some gold now. Inverse relationship with interest rates.
Stock is garbage and is very bearish
Good news is shares have dropped so much that a 2 or 3% drop each day won't be that much!
UA is down 4.92% to 18.54
Target is 20.50 today
"I hope everyone realizes this isn't real, someone is manipulating the SP so it won't collapse, guess we'll wait until tomorrow and the next few days to see it collapse, they can't keep this up forever."
"Lol- Mike, John, and nsip haven't been heard from in days. I wonder why??? hmmm"
why the fall?
http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/31/investing/under-armour-earnings-stock/index.html
Mike and Jon ...Sorry short cortz UA is not going down to where it was ...you 2 shorts need to smoke your last cigarette
"UAA should have stayed out of politics...It's still swirling in the toilet, will the turd keep it from being flushed???"
I think what would really push Under Armour to the next level is that they need to expand outside of North America with Pro Endorsements....they really need to sign big name Soccer stars....i see they are moving more into the Boxing World but Soccer is the real play
"Losing Curry would be a disaster for Under Armour UAA, +2.98% . Curry is the company’s most important athlete endorsement, with Morgan Stanley pegging his value to Under Armour at $14.1 billion in 2016. Under Armour stock received a number of downgrades in the past week after posting disappointing earnings. The company’s shares are down more than 30% in the past month, and down almost 73% in the past 12 months."
Anyone know their next Earning release date?
"If UA goes below $10 per share, its market cap fall below annual revenue. This is a BULLISH sign. Just look at what occurred this summer with RL (Ralph Lauren). RL was sold down to $66 per share and bounced hard once it traded below annual revenues. By the way, Ralph Lauren currently has a negative P/E ratio due to some of the same factors UA is facing. Look at where RL is now. $89 per share. RL is up almost 35% from where it bottomed.I see so many asking for a good entry point in UA. There is none because no one knows the bottom. Best bet is to begin dollar cost averaging by purchasing $1000 worth of UA each week for the next 6 months. I started buying below $14 after selling out at a pre-split price of $99 per share. Don't let the analysts scare you into selling. The analysts were the ones buying my shares of UA at $99. I'm back after a 2 year break to buy my shares back from them. UA is the only stock I have been lucky enough to exit at the top. I may not find the bottom, but am betting a dollar cost averaging strategy will get me close.This is in my own opinion. Don't risk what you can't afford to lose!"
UAA is up 9.10% to 10.14
"I lost fortune on UnderArmour. Finally after painlessly seeing the shares lower and lower all the way from $42 to $16, i couldn't take any more. Glad i got out at $16. I am still willing to get in, but only if this CEO makes way for another CEO."
back to 50 gradually
If they stay in business 10 years share price around $5.!
Everyone sell on policial view . I will stick to numbers
I was in China 3 years ago and all I saw was Nike. Anybody know if UA is being sold there.
wells fargo steals from thier own members. Wells fargo secretly buying? All analyst and friends and family need to be watched for insider trading. SEC will investigate this clown. I hope no one he is affiliated with shorted this stock.
"Lower Lows Lower Highs,Oh My! I see the best ultimate support on this stock at about $15 to $16 range. Look for the stock to go higher first, but ultimately re-test that 15 to 16 range. And that's where I'd get more interested in trying to take a long position in that stock"
"You negative people on here, get over it. UA and UAA will turn the tide. Be patient. Rome wasn't built in a day. I have a triple in both. UA and UAA along with some splits."
Nice run today. Let's keep it going.
I guarantee that Plank hears the criticism and complaints from investors. He is making changes and progress in creating highergrowth for the company. Buy UA and hold longterm.This chart reveals the amount of 'reversion to the mean' that may be recaptured. https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/ADDYY#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

Market Cap will be under 8 Billion very soon!
Let’s hope you’re right.........??30 by Friday be nice too
This stock is a poster child for why listening to analyst is a waste of time. It is also hazardous to your wealth
https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/under-armour-sportsmask-sold-less-hour-ceo
Hey Plank !! Sober up and start running this company or step down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Many running for the exit and I am buying....maybe a onetime opportunity.
If earnings surprise will pop $3
There is no resistance all the way to the bank.
Got in at 17.12 pre market... I hope it hits $20 today
why the drop AH ?
https://www.investopedia.com/news/why-under-armour-faces-steeper-declines/
"I do not see any reason, why the share should rise. UA shoes for 15#$%$ in Europe. Nobody wants to buy."
UAA is up 12.86% to 16.06
"If the rate of loss over the last two days continues, UA will be at 0 in 26 trading days. Maybe the value is not what everyone thinks it is."
can someone tell me please. UA. UAA what's the difference. thanks
Read my post 2 days ago
UAA is up 4.95% to 22.28
UAA reached a 52 Week low at 7.53
NSIP.... your gamble will pay off be patient
"Keep your eyes on the prize - UA exceeded expectations and raised guidance. Everything else is ""media noise"" and hoopla.Nike survived a recent ""scandal"" and so will UA.Buying on the dips, it's going higher, much higher."
Looking good so far...
nothing changed imho
UA will never beat Nike. I think UA is a white people brand
They need more supply of the HOVR shoes. Impossible to find size 10.
"Yup, already sold!!!"
Adidas why are they talking to Under Armour
Reebok 2.0. Same strategy; would love to know how the company leadership feels it'll be a different outcome?
"Under Armour Inc. President Patrik Frisk bought $500,000 worth of company's shares through his family trust as he continues to work on turning around the sportswear maker.Frisk, who joined the company in July, purchased 14,000 Class A shares at an average price of $18.50 and 14,000 Class C shares at an average price of $16.62, according to a federal securities filing Monday. In total, Frisk purchased $491,680 worth of shares. The transactions took place on Friday."
i think UA will continue to slide lower and lower. target 20 a share
You can dam well bet this is going down if they disappoint.
"no doubt this is a buy right now, too cheap to pass"
Under Armour Boycott on Twitter! This is all over the net! Wow!
Over half a billion in losses. What's next quarter going to do? It would take them years just to make up this huge loss. Geez
Just loaded up at $13.90. What a gift....
Someone please give me a good reason why I should still own this stock?
"Curry has become too political, and turned a lot of fans off. Bad move on the part of UAA in my opinion. Should have done more with Phelps."
"Send Plank to North Korea, ASAP."
heading to 13.5 technically ... but I don't know when. Plank is very bad
Major short squeeze today!
it's a hold call from zack
Has Under Armour plunged to 6 yet?
might pic up some fb tho
UA is down 5.40% to 18.23
You can still buy Monday and get paid also Dropbox will pop on earnings may see $34-$38 after great buy it's were in headed before earnings
Come on Kevin!!! Where are you??? Turn this thing around won't you!??!?!
"Has nottaa to do with UA, post that sh&$ somewhere else dude"
Over 25 tomorrow Let’s go
Check out the restock of the Project Delta that is selling out!
Fred week high. 3.41. at 2.55. load up
UA needs to hire the dude designing the Jimmer Fredette Shoes....
need to see close above 23.2 to get bullish again. IMO
Its america ..... left loves to not work and lie cheat and steal. Kevin plank is no different.
I think analyst and business programs like to cut down certain stocks and UAA is one of them.
UAA reached a 52 Week low at 16.09
this was a 108 stock
"again, short at will"
UAA is up 10.80% to 15.28
"Plank (stable genius) doomed this company when he came out in support of the racist bigot faux-patriot ""precedent"" bone-spurs."
Uaa is not painting a picture of success. They have given up on growth. They proved they can't be a big player in the clothing market. Even if they earn a profit the stock is not worth what it is trading for.
Who thinks UA is a winner long term??
"Too much overeaction from the stock market. Guys, the stock is getting beat. Yes that is very true but the only reason is b/c its not meeting Wall Street expectations. Take that out of the equation and just look at the business fundamentals. The Current Ratio is above 2.0, the Debt Ratio just sits under .50 and the company has been profitable for the last 5+ years. Only this year there has been a loss the first 2 quarters but there is still a profit for Q3. Q4 we don't know but we do know is that even if they lose money for 2017, it will not impact the company's financials. They are sitting on so much cash that another loss for 2018 won't harm them. If anyone has run a business before, they know what to look for and Kevin Plank is not a fool. Look at all the CEOS and Co-founders of companies on Fortune 500 companies. Most of them are 60+ years old while Kevin is in his 40's. He takes risks but that is what a young business leader does if he wants to take his business to the next level. Look at his YouTube interview videos and how his business principles align with Under Armour's. All you guys saying company is going bankrupt and UA going under needs to do more due diligence.Company is still growing in annual sales. JUST NOT wall street expectations. BUT who gives a #$%$ about what wall street thinks! Take that out of the equation and you got a company growing in annual sales 7-10% is still #$%$ good. This stock is getting beaten but if you are looking for a long term value (I mean 10+ years), right now is a good time to load up and if dips more, then re-load up. Just don't drop all your cash reserves in this and save some for the dip. Or buy some options to hedge it! GEEZ GUYS! Stop worrying!"
"Motley Fool should be ashamed,pumping this for their own personal gain!"
short UAA long NKE worked well!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Upside? If UA reports mediocre numbers we sell off 10%. If they report great numbers we rally 20-50%. This is a risk I’m willing to take.
UAA reached a 52 Week low at 7.32
Nike has lost its way.
"52 week low, no brainer; I bought apple at $92 and the market kept saying it's going lower....hmmm don't think so. UA signed with the Wisconsin Badgers and they will bounce back much sooner than a year....I'm loading up for the first time at these generous lows."
"nsip, you obviously haven't done your f.in research, go on their website and keep track of all the apparel, HOVRs, and Currys that are selling. In this quarter they have sold out 15 different colorways in what I have just mentioned not mentioning the soccer cleats that have been on fire this quarter. I check it atleast twice a day! On top of that their expectations in terms of revenue & EPS forecast is totally different than what Adidas and Nike have! So the same numbers dont apply to them."
Kanye West and shift from fashion to performance will propel Under Armour back to promised land.
"Morning Star opening line - Under Armour (UA)/(UAA) has grown into a leading apparel and accessories brand in the United State .. Hey guys, they just lost 4% of their domestic sale and have been consistently declining in the states.. lol who the f writes these"
Plank left won't buy your stock they don't work
The question is....Has UA virtue signaled enough to finally get positive media coverage?
Owner should take company private
time to buy UA again
"UA Revenue for this idiot Mike, who is spreading fake news. Mike stated UA's revenue declined by 54% - I just pulled up their 10K report via SEC filings and the following are their revenue figures for the past 4 years. Their has been zero decline in revenue ONLY growth. Put a sock in it Mike. 2014: $3.08 Billion 2015: $3.96 Billion 2016: $4.83 Billion 2017: $4.93 Billion"
"it can run, 100 possible"
$40 a share in 12 months
Will it come back up?
"News: Under Armour, Inc. (UAA & UA) are in talks to acquire Depends adult diapers. Kevin Plank has gone on record as saying this acquisitions will unlock inherent synergies."
holy #$%$ thundercrack a 8000 dollar hit ..WHY WHY... everyone knows this company will be bought out on 90 days dude ..I should have waited
This is not a gift. Accounting Fraud is serious. How many companies had accounting fraud that resulted in a positive stock move?
Citigroup and Goldman Sachs maintains their buy rating and price target held at $26https://www.benzinga.com/stock/uaa/ratings
So is this the bottom?
Congrats to Kevin Plank for a good quarter. But Kevin is a very cheap guy. Several years ago he bought his mother a new car. She hated it and left it a t the dealership for a year. But who could be excited about a new smart car? LOL
"Decent earnings, but NA not growing...still. Big problems blemish when a company can’t defend its home turf. Also, Chief Accounting Officer announced he’s leaving last week, or that was rumor amongst ex UAers out there. No rationale given. The drip of leadership heading for the hills continues, but good for the bottom line, of course."
The market seems to agree with the Plank resignation. Good for us.
Down to 3
Glad I didn't buy Friday.
Buying opportunity
They might get bought out at this price
"Fellow shareholders, should we expect ""Spaceman Plank"" to come forward today?????????"
Making Curry face of the company is a good strategy.
C’mon UAA....
"No business next 18 months, many can go bankrupt due to China Virus"
can anyone explain the big jump? i dont see any positive news
Load it up fellas.
curry 4 shoe profits reportedly fund neo-nazis
Wow. I was expecting to see recent reactions on UA's message board given all of the posters commenting negatively on Nike's site citing that they will be buying UA or Adidas. I guess it really is all just noise.
"Curious why UAA pays Tom Brady, Jordan Speith, and all those other athletes so much, yet I never ever see an advertisement featuring them. Seems like a tremendous waste of money to me."
"New day high ,must be Tom Brady big endorsement deal. Lol"
"Come on Chris, buy some more, stop the price from falling....ha ha ha ha ha ha ha"
"The brand is #$%$ the financials #$%$, but stock goes up. Computers do their thing this has nothing to do with the company. On the otherhand, it is very unliky to fall to 8-9 from here on"
check out the forward PE and PEG ratio...company is overvalued at this price
Where's the buyback program Plank? How about a dividend program?
"Maybe if Plank spoke clothing instead of politics, this would do as good, if not better than Nike...dead stick until he resigns..."
Love how my posts are being censored. Yahoo is such a joke.
"ANOTHER GREAT DAY FOR UNDER ARMOUR.WHAT A POS THIS STOCK IS.UAA IS LIKE THE ANGRY TURD IN THE TOILET BOWL.....YOU KEEP FLUSHING IT, BUT IT WON'T GO DOWN"
"stock needs to move above 22 to move higher, that has been the ceiling recently"
and there goes the gaines of the pre-market as reality sinks in
Ping Pong
good things happening finally
Sell UA. It is the best advice you will get. It is grossly overvalued.
Nfl and nba snow flakes take knee we will take your money . You pigs. No sponsors no education you will all be broke. Dunk that you pigs
"I'm old enough to remember when UA had all the major sport MVP's, was gaining marketshare and had all the kids...now...they can't outfit TB12 w a decent pair of pants..."
"Very dependent on marketing, which is subject to the whims of consumer trends."
"Under Armour, is dead,as we knew it. Greedy Keven split the stock,and we all lost our #$%$. /but he is still building his 35,000 square foot house. Which we are paying for ! This was a great stock early on,but greed and ego,killed the Golden Goose."
UA is down 8.15% to 8.23
"Get woke, go broke! I wonder if they sell clothing that can make me seem less white, might be a huge driver of sales...ha ha"
Sell the dead cat.
surprised that Nike hasn't come bidding for it ... this is a better brand than nike imh
Bk soon
Fair Value around 12 bucks IMO
"As I pointed out earlier, the Barron's article was written by Jack Hough, which is the kiss of death for this stock. He is hopelessly stupid, but a great contrarian indicator. I don't have a position, but would be interested at around 15.... We will see"
Under Armour finally getting over the hump? I noticed the Curry's are back selling pretty well. They keep selling out for various sizes. MLB will be coming after this upcoming baseball season too. International markets will continue to grow. Hopefully selling more shoes now too with Kohls doing well.
"Hold onto your shorts into this close as $17.'s may be breaking point for many frustrated investors,I still see another $3. to $4. before the shorts get nervous,still along way to drop!"
superdry better than UA. superdry 250M
If you're going to short....I suggest waiting to see how they want to take this the rest of the week.
"I sold yesterday a nickel less than the top but close enough, A nickel less was lucky on an option ( call ). The sell was technical so I took it. I will look at re-enter around 15. Not sure that it goes that low and I would not short it because there is a good story built around International sales. I do not understand the need for so much capital to restructure. This is a cut and sew business backed by marketing and distribution. These are fundamental gripes. The technicals are getting weaker but it may not mean a price reversal although a retest to 14-20 before a bounce would not be a huge surprise. I take 50% profit and smile."
It's going to take a LONG TIME for this one to recover. You can probably do better things with your money and revisit thin in a year or so and miss anything.
"uaa, your killing me"
IF closes below 24; I will sell all my calls.
"Too much call to put ratio, like 2 to 1. Market makers will do whatever to bring it down, especially after their lackluster report and guidance."
I shorted some shares will turn green soon.
Alot of nike business coming to under armour. go long.
"These overpayed athletes with their political agendas...are killing these bohemeth purveyers of overpriced #$%$. I, for one, am enjoying the downslide of their stock prices."
What’s your predication for tomorrow’s opening. I am thinking 22.
stock in cheetah clubs just tanked ha ha. oh wait there's no stock in cheetahs lmao
Probe is a scare tactic...easiest 15% you are ever gonna make! Buy!
Still 50 p/e?!?! Short the hell out of it
$13 for UA is very likely ... Plank is bad
Only sales and PROFITS will help UA grow their brand. And they cannot seem to find either.
The revenue hasn’t declined further in Q4 and they are taking new initiatives. Should see some rise in share price since the future is looking alright.
back to 21
"Abandon ship, abandon ship."
#UAA Looking good to the upside after some consolidation. Buy rating stands at 7 at 9trading. Watch it over 23.3 for a run up to 27.79.
"Well Mr Kevin Plank. Is the price of UAA down far enough for you to consider investing in you own company yet?? Or are you waiting till you drive the price down to single digits???? Oh!! By the way great job you are doing here for someone. Just who the someone is, is the question."
"If no big brand trying buyout here, They all stupid. Under Armour is very very good brand. last known brand value is almost equal to current market value.Company also have very high margin and so all those sell slow down is just temporary and will come back strongly.They are leader and will remain so."
Curry 5 model of sneakers? .... oh my ...
Bam
how is falling from 19 to 17 a 4.77 loss? I have not followed this stock but like the product and of course they have not adamantly disrespected the country. Whay's up here
don'T get too excited with hedge funds buys. they're often wrong or take a long time like a year to work in your favor.
will high like NIke $75.00
Your wrong Fuel going to $30 by year end fool
"its not a regurgitation of 2 yr old news, its a preview of coming attractions. they put it in the press, the ceo and founder steps aside.. something is coming down, its not good, and they need to give shareholders a heads up, imo. wake up"
"With this kind of growth, worth at least 50. Look at all those influencer on YouTube, they are wearing UA"
UA posted a whopping net loss of $773 million in the first half of 2020. Analysts expect its bottom line to remain in the red for the full yearthe worst is yet to come stick with winners like LULU
Can anyone tell me the difference between UA and UAA?Thanks.
"anyone know if GYMSHARK will ever get in the NYSE, I mean.... they did ring the bell a some time ago"
$30 by the end of the year
"Thanks for the big drop in pre-market, bought 500 shares, Go UA"
stockinvest says. Fred strong buy 5.09 soon
Shorts getting SQUEEEEEEEEEEZED!
Will the last bag holder leaving the building .... Please turn out the lights ..... Sorry !!!
I am surprised...I think Sam Poser will pay money to show up on CNBC to talk about UA again.
Great pain 22.5 or 20?
"Today 18, tomorrow 19, by Friday 20"
anyone else think there will be a short squeeze?
"For example, if you think a co. will die gradually, why bother? Like IBM ... UA"
see http://tradingtips.zohosites.com/ .
What had happened?
Bashed Trump in 16 and blew it altogether. Dixie Chicks bashed Bush and never heard from again. I owned a small AC company for 24 years. I had a partner for 6 years. Made him pull his political sticker off his bumper.
Tue Jun 25 1018 - SELL@25.51
"Has everyone muted Bob?? I see he gets not replies and posts 10 times a day. If you have not muted him, can you talk him off the ledge??"
Just looked at the all time chart and whoever bought this at 80 bucks man I am truly sorry
Downgraded to sell $7 target
UAA is up 4.90% to 21.08
"What a joke, up .27 after hours, and can’t get .23 in regular sessions"
execs cant expense their trips to the titty bar anymore. of course they are leaving the company
I think this is one of those stocks you can’t look at for a couple years
"Fell asleep at the wheel. If this company was ran right the last few years they would be competing much closer with Nike and there would be no such thing as Lululemon, or at least in its current market share form. With that I think they are on the up, possibly slow and steady, but certainly up. Too much value in the name and quality to not be a competent, profitable company. Disclaimer: Currently have 2000 shares @ 9.77."
Longs have nothing to worry about? They just lost 60% of their investment in six months. Whatever school you attended in Kentuckabama should be closed forever.
"What an unmitigated disaster of a quarter. Growth rate basically cut in half from 22% to 12% or whatever. I mean wow, talk about screwing shareholders. My god, learn how to manage expectations. If you can't, just sell the company to someone who knows what they're doing (Nike or Adidas)."
I'm pretty sure Kevin Plank falls asleep every night thinking about some way to SELL this Dog ...... That's all !
UA reached an all time low at 7.98
hovr shoes r so popular
"24-26 has been UAA resistance barrier. Glad to see 24 again, and patiently waiting to break through 26."
19.8-19.9 today.22 is coming fast.
14 eoy. Long run i don't know...
There she goes....
NKE and Adidas are down because of China and now UA is following. How much of UA's business is in China?
"Nike, Adidas, puma., Asics,Mizuno .....etc all of them green except this garbage. "
UA reached a 52 Week low at 13.13
lululemon athletica is becoming more popular
"So, you lost 60 percent of your investment, and one of your star hoes now hates both the company and Mein Trumpf, and your earnings sukked, and your exposure to China is huge and your P/E ratio is off the charts. Hey, it's all good. Who wouldn't buy into this company? I mean, down south, of course."
$20+ stock. Great buying opportunity here.
UAA is down 7.64% to 10.64
"UAA is this generations Nike... Institutions will scare retail investors off the stock and it will gap up so fast they wont be able to get back in... happens all the time. This is a no brainer unless you dont like buying growth stocks low. 99% of retal investors will miss UAA and they'll say something really smart like ""buuut the PE Ratio"" .... as if thats what really indicates anything regarding price. Novice Novice Novice"
Guys buy PLYZ. This stock is on fire!!!
watch them short it this week back to $15
"my kid is 10 all him & his friends wear is UA & some nike. they all like ua better, shoes fit better, nike always too tight on sides, ua also have way cooler colors etc. its a whole generation of kids who all ask for ua."
Planck is playing with fire again ... sad
"I used to be a Nike stockholder fanboy and shifted to UA a year ago. I cannot complain, great results. Company is on the right track. Future is bright"
This was old news. Just imagine if they get The Rock to endorse UA. Remember Puma was a cheap brand back in the 1980s look at them now. UAs story is not anywhere close to them and their quality is top notch. The story will always be of the underdog stealing market share. Wait till you see Nike try to buy em over else watch them eat up Nike and Adidas market share in the upcoming years. I'd be foolish to not buy their shares while they are down like right now.https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/2016-08-08/under-armour-ua-created-a-shoe-for-dwayne-the-rock-johnson
"So the earnings report is tomorrow, but Yahoo has it listed for late April...?"
Putsssss!!!!
"The 30s by the end of the month, like if you are agreed"
when is earnings?
"Congratulations to all longs! I missed out on the recent price jump but that's ok. I still don't trust the stock won't dip back down. May 24 short interest shows 20% of shares are held short, with 10 days to cover. Maybe some of this price action is shorts covering their you know what. Guess we'll find out! GLTA"
This is crazy
"They've made some recovery since April but people seem to have such a negative view of their products. Maybe not those buying for style but athletes. The kids in South Dakota and the college campus are wearing them, they seem unaware of any politics when asked, but is the quality there???"
Under $10 like I said earlier today.. Once the worse earnings and forward guidance
"Kev better hope MLB doesn't change their mind about who they want supplying uniforms after his comments about Trump,think before you speak! The comments received criticism across social media from those who don't support Trump. Some activists are vowing to boycott Baltimore-based Under Armour"
Lulu lemon buying ua
TIME TO SHORT IT!!! hehe
"SPACE MAN heading for a class action for the cover up,or maybe heading for a M&A deal"
"Under Armour’s (UAA) apparel business, which accounts for about two-thirds of the company’s total sales, reported unexpected softness in the fourth quarter of 2016. Sales grew 7% YoY (year-over-year) to $929 million. That's not gonna cut it with lawsuits and declining business,slow decline today but will pick back up next week as it bleeds into low $17.'s,last chance to sell at $17. today,if your in at $6. share maybe you hold but each $1. drop is getting closer to bankruptcy!"
"Well, that completes 4 down days in a row. This has only happen 2 other times in 2018, and after both 4 down events they were followed by 2 up days in a row. This may be the valley prior to the earning report."
I suggest that US abandon the stock market
"Something is wrong with the company,lot of bad news, that's how manipulation looks like when the news get very bad for the company,This is how shake outs look like in a stock with a lot of bad news.Shareholders are the reason for that I doubt that, they are who bombarding the stock with large selling actions, they do not want to support the stock.But guess what these are times when you buy something like that, only weak hands buy on rising prices, but smart money buy on falling prices. If the stock is under its fair value with big percentage no way it will come back so sharp.I can see there is some hidden news is coming soon it may take some time. And when the stock pushes up it will push without any influental news but they will release it after the push up, I think they are buying it now because of that."
"The sad part about this is, even after a 40% decline in share price for UA. The Stock still has a PE ratio of 60!!! Just shows you how badly this stock was pumped from 2012 to 2016. The big C level executives walked away with millions of dollars."
"Gshaun sure likes to ignore debt and inventory. He neglects to point out that 10K sales included sales to new stores, third party retailers and $1 billion of debt from previous years of unsold inventory. Figures make liars and liars make figures. Pound salt loser!"
Why isn't this positive news about opening a large distribution center and employing 1200 new workers? Anyone?
What is going on we have UA & then UAA what one will be the better one to buy if any
What u mean buy ...do you think it will go up?
People panic
Let's all cheer for a $48 million loss!
No one is buying expensive clothing in the near future. Even people with money are scared to make purchases of expensive items. And compounded with high unemployment makes this a scary stock
This has been one of my worst buys.
Dropping after hours. Tomorrow -10% again
"Kevin Plank is an example that some entrepreneurs have the talent for a start-up, but are a train wreck as CEO of a maturing company. Plank is #4 on Forbes list of ""20 Worst CEOs in America"". He is no Steve Jobs or Bill Gates. In the past two years he has managed to make UA's financial performance chart resemble the luge track at the Olympics. (Maybe there is an endorsement opportunity.) And it isn't all due to market segment conditions when you contrast UA's performance (4.8% TTM) with Nike (12.02% TTM) and Adidas (5.57% TTM). As Kenra Investors posited: ""It's obvious that the company's (UA) growth was in part a result of a fad, helped by the popularity of its endorser Stephen Curry. Sales growth in North America is declining extremely fast and, at this pace, will soon approach negative territory."" Plank has been driving this dog sled downhill from $82 to $13 in 24 months. The dogs are even barking mutiny. When will the Board of Directors get it?"
"I sold 1000, still 3000 open. Glad I hold into earning."
Enron in the making

My $10 PUTs I bought in Sept. are lookin kinda nice right about now......
"This fall UA will get its footing back... with lots of team, club, college, and pro endorsements. Focus on quality and performance. Next lululemon."
"Nice bump,today, although UAA needs to break above and hold above 22 for the gain to be sustainable."
"Shares of UA were up over 4% today on the rumor that someone was actually spotted going into a mall based Under Armour, Inc. Store. Shares should reverse tomorrow after it was confirmed the person was asking for directions to the LuLu Lemon store."
"They have a ""disengaged CEO"" now so stock will suffer. Plus, short interest is like a leech sucking blood out of your leg when you go swimming in Minnesota. This stock is a ticking time bomb heading into the election."
"After earning report this week, don't be surprised to see $15."
"Why Adidas over UA. I am at the gym and all I see is UA wear. Midwest state likes UA, Addidas must be big in Euro not in Ohio."
The company will be bought at $15 a share one day
"Short the stock please, you shorts are smart money and know balance sheets. So short and I will sell you my stock in the mid 20s before you know it. Even if market corrects this is going highet"
the pugs effect she leaves Duluth and it goes up 3% and she comes here and it goes down
Uptrend confirmed
Driller .. absolutely dude .. everyone has shorted this stock so much that they think they have figured out a pattern like DWM ...you will never figure a stock out or any stock out ...all it takes is some kind of news and it's off to the races ...a stockand company like UA is too big to stay stagnate for ever ...when it goes it will go
"Another BIG problem is complacency. A top level person at america's largest sporting goods chain told me, ""their salesmen don't work hard and spend too much time golfing and having expensive lunches"". They never even knew that NIKE has a marketing program where they recycle their reject insoles and donate them for use in flooring. Plank could care less about the enviornment. He just wants to imitate Phil Knight."
This will bounce back just like GE did. Watch.
Anyone buying @ 22 ?
Just because the ceo says he screwed up doesn't mean a turn around. Actions speaks louder than BS words like making booze!!! UA is far from turning around. Show us the money and not just Hot Air!!!
UA high performance covid 19 mask about to be out and in demand. personally I think it's the new technology in materials t o be implemented in their work out clothing is what to watch
"Under Armor isn't big overseas because the United States is the only country where we treat high school sports, football is particular, on par with professional sports. You go to to any high school football practice, and that coach is there like the next game is the superbowl.What does that have to do with UA? Well, it's all about the story of Plank and how he came up with the ""wicking fabric."" This story only appeals to those who think high school football is the center piece of culture and that's not something that can be said of Europe or Asia."
Insiders are selling like no tomorrow GLTA
"CEO must go, he admits it's systemic and ""culture"""
Next Quarters earnings report? Will Boycott be the excuse this time around or just more sports retailer bankruptcies?
more investors may be attracted to this company
17.8+ close today will signal 20 in few weeks.
"When Barrons writes a positive article, that is truly a black swan event, LOL. Retail is tough but I believe this company will rebound some. Bought at 18, seems like a good risk/reward."
Lol the shorts are trying everything in their power to get people to sell their stocks. Do you guys realize the firms trying to get you to sell are the one with the highest short positions on UA. This is nothing more than price manipulation.
I love the brand but not the stock. Should I get in now or wait?
"The downhill path has started. Take your profits now, before it is too late. ;)"
UAA is down 9.51% to 7.74
The company needs to be bought out by amazon. Kevin Plank then fired. stock will jump up 10$.
UA reached a 52 Week low at 10.28
I wonder if today's reaction was partly due to Under Armour's release of customized shoes. It looks pretty awesome that you can personality add anything that you can create to your shoes.
wow from up 25% to down now lol
They cleaned all the experience out of middle mgmt with downsizing and now back to the merry go round of VP’s
UAA is down 8.39% to 11.57
"here comes the pop, amazon"
Can anyone explain what happened from 2014 to 2020 to go from 110 to 8 dollars ?
what? you mean over-priced and over-hyped expensive clothing made in 3rd world countries isn't a sustainable business model?
"NIKE down, price compression real! Has UA really leveled off yet?IMHO"
"Hi folks,I'm new to UA...looking for a ""deal""..this looks to be one?...company going to be ok? Any (educated) advice would be appreciated. Thanks"
support at $10.30??
"2,510,799 only????"
"$UAA $UA now close to the same price in 2007 (or 13 years ago), this was a stock touted by Motley Fool to buy in early 2017 at all time high."
"Shorts are in trouble, this was at a year low, over 1/3 of itsome year high, and you didn't cash out.You will be getting pinched here, as this is a high quality product and company. Buy. This will pop."
"Rock1 sold out whitin an hour. You see, no logo visible and clean shoe and sold out. Too bad they make so mich clownish shoes and clothing"
Overpriced stuff. Avoid it.
"And Adidas is eating under Armour's lunch in shoes, too. Really, Adidas has something here. Now, how quickly before Nike copies what they have? So far, after seeing Nike spend zillions of dollars over 6 years and be trumped by Adidas who bought the bounce tech for $50 million, I don't have much faith in NIKE management. And now they are pitting themselves against America, something they have already been doing by making their shoes overseas and using ""slave labor"". Adidas should further differentiate themselves and make a USA shoe line and make it patriotic to boot. And only make it on their most expensive Bounce Shoe/sneakers."
A bear's worst fear coming true. Too much positive news preventing their manipulation.
"Look, if CROCS could stage a comeback then surely UAA can!"
ROFL if you're buying into the bull trap
$UA PR lifts target to $29www.stocktargetadvisor.com/blog/pivotal-research-lifted-the-target-on-under-armouruanye-to-29-from-26/
UA has lost 60% of its value since the stock split last August. They are now the worst performing company in the S&P 500. Why has there not been an overhaul to the executive team?
Delusions of grandeur!https://www.thestreet.com/story/14486343/1/under-armour-ceo-kevin-plank-fourth-quarter-earnings.html?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO&yptr=yahoo
"Hey I slept in today, what did I miss?"
Many executives are leaving the company or getting fired. UA will have to pay out all of these executives with hefty checks that will affect the forecasted EPS on the next earnings call.
"its a joke, still dont believe in the brand. Super ugly. You guys are not objective. Share goes up for a reason no one knows except the computers. Good luck and im out"
52 week low and it's just getting crushed
Just got my Kohls mailer. 25% off all ua this coming week. The shelves are loaded with ua stuff.
21.8 will be seen by EOW?21 is given - IMO
I’m glad I sold out
Mr. Plank should resign now
Short it tomorrow for ST only ? Any thoughts?
$19 after Earnings!
This will go $9 after ER :)
If the left gave a #$%$ about politics they would buy. But they won't they have no money and they are focus on giving our enemy money. Good job today plank. You idiot
I work with high school students in the Midwest and often ask them what they're favorite brands are. Most say Under Armor or Nike.
This is really turning out to be a real BAD investment decision on my part.
Now UAA should release earnings tonight
Taking a poll......how much money in this POS UA stock have you all lost? I will start and say that POS Kevin Plank has cost me $60K just in the last couple of months.
"This brand has so much potential! Some stars need to be aligned, something needs to click, the right opportunity hits and it'll take off."
Resistance around $14.73-$14.77
Hold on to your AU hats shaping up like a Big run is coming
profitability is a big concern - one product or one Q won't help
That Loud Sucking Sound you hear is the principals at UA selling their shares ahead of the real downturn which will occur after the Q3 2107 Results.... Sell Now ..... Play Short Options until Q1 2018 and then BUY at $12 ... Don't be a Bag Holder.
UA is what I see at the gym. I look at the wear of the folks at a Midwest gym and have to say 80% are wearing UA stuff.
Been holding this one more than 2 years. The reason i am holding because i love there products. I agree company going through some troubles but the management will overcome it soon. once Nike was same way. Look at jt after 20 years with so many splits and dividends. Trust the company beforenyou invest.
"I have owned UA for a long time and don't plan on selling, but I won't buy any UA stuff from Amazon. BOYCOTT AMAZONThey are trying to kill all retail."
"Yeah, selling before the big drop!!UA (Plank) is just saying what we want to hear."
just bad people running UA.
"I love how when it was $16, all the articles were Debbie Downers. Now at $26, they're all positive. I am long but frankly can't figure out if shares are cheap or expensive. I really just bought UA because I bought 2 Nike shirts that turned out to be low quality and the market cap of UA looked so low in comparison with Nike's market cap."
Anyone know the status of the Class Action suit against UA and the name of the law firm I should contact to get information
Amazing .. no clothing retailer even made an attempt to go here space suit.. UA can displays it technology of course branding will definitely bring this stocks to another world!!! Booooooom!!!
"Bye, bye Under Armour."
this company will be bought out..mark my words today people
Nike and Villanova win another championship. Hale to the victors!
I bought 1200 shares at open for $10.30 and quickly sold for $10.54 in the crazy morning.Glad I didn’t hold for higher.
"i wonder if the stock price eill goe back to 100 now that they are not spending $25,000 a night on strippers for athletes and corporate people lol darn i knew i shoulda worked here haha."
ua has risen on one new pair of running shoes for Curry
"Thank the LORD my kids aren't dumb enough to fall for the amateurish brainwashing techniques that UnderwAre uses. ""Hey, if you wear these shoes, you can dunk like Stephen."" Seriously? That's all you've got?"
short short short
3 up days in a row for Under Armour. Haven't seen that in a while. Hopefully this is a start of new uptrend for long suffering UAA shareholders.
day traders held this up. it's going to keep falling for days as more longs learn about this. it fell even more on lunch hour when ppl had a chance to view it.
Inventory up 27% means share will go down to 8-9
Under Armour bringing new chief designer onboard
Just thk....this is an up day
Paying 50 million rent in NYC doesnt help
Sold all yesterday! Gonna go down to 12 or 10 even wanna bet
Frisk talking 'reinvent' on CNBC....lol.....as his stock was trading $9.07 on the screen. Finished day at $8.63. Back to 'invent' drawing-board.
"UA should be crushing NKE. NKE, the unpatriotic ""Take a Knee"" supporters.... This is the equivalent of a Democratic party who is crying because they can't beat a clown like Trump. This is sad. They need to get their act together."
Some profit taking going on today ... $104 stock
the next Enron... couldnt get out fast enough
Plank the problem with your political view is........movie stars don't wear ua
lol. my short is looking good
"Can’t short this you will get hurt just buy dips and wait, this will beat Nike 5 years from now"
Where does UA manufacture all their clothes?
Rumor put out last evening that UAA is being investigated for potential accounting issues. Interesting it was put out the evening before earnings announcement. Really is anyone else suspicious of the timing on this. Sounds like a rumor put out by short sellers to run the share price down. This is not the first time WSJ has done this.
"The search for truth--I recently made a decision to spend my retail dollars ONLY with companies that have the courage to speak the truth---what is the truth---there are radicals on both sides--#$%$--BLM--ATIMA---White Nationalists---Plank is a coward---he did not condemn the shooting of 5 police officers in Dallas---he did not condemn Ferguson, Baltimore--or the numerous instances of violence from the left----goodbye UA----"
"UA will not recover... poor decision making and missed opportunities. Look for 5 dollars, then chapter 13 protection."
Covered ... now to $40 ...
Watch chart for next leg down! Another fall off the cliff moment!
.23 vs .18 per share. Let’s see what the traders do now.

Are yall buying ua or uaa????
Pay attention to the fundamentals underneath. I doubt they will beat estimates.
I was at the outlet mall over the weekend in New Jersey and the line was an hour long to get into under armor about the same for Nike
"The very first step UA has to take is designing, implementing, and manufacturing shoes that are up to date with the current trend preferences of the consumer. People are not going to pay $100-150 for shoes that are considered ""uncool"" and deemed as the laughing stock of shoes. If you go on Under Armours website and browse what they have available, you can tell why their shoes sales have been lagging for several years now. The competition is fierce as ever before with Nike and Adidas who are hiring the best designers and putting the best product out on the floor. UA has a golden opportunity with Steph Curry and I do mean GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY. He is among the top 5 most popular players this game has ever seen. He is right up their with MJ, Kobe, and Lebron in terms of his global footprint. If Plank cant advantage of this once in a lifetime opportunity with Steph then I dont think he will ever be able to do it with another superstar."
why down so much???
"Like i said in the beginning, their international business will save them. All of the rest will also come true, 50 before the end of the year"
"It’s funny how quickly people abandon their ideologies. As soon as the virus dies, within a month everyone will be flying again. Sooo many people said that wouldn’t stop living their lives due to corona, they all did. Sooo many people say they won’t resume their lives after this is over; they all will. Long terms calls for the win! $JBLU $UA $AAL $DAL"
I'm sad....We are missing all those cocky shorts like Mike. They were great kids and just needed a little help with investing. Rookies that need guidance.
I’ll buy at $5
Why is this showing a different price on yahoo by a buck??
"The UA Hovr sneakers and the Rock are still constantly sold out everywhere. Profits plus extremely high demand make this company a 27 to 30 dollar stock by June 2019. Seatbelts fastened, ready for takeoff!!!"

Is john talking to himself? John get a hold of yourself and buy some shares
like what earning number and when do they report
now it is going up after lunch.. Easy win if you know how and when people trade.
"Many are talking about rising oil prices, and tariffs. Yet, others are talking about a 5% GDP number on Friday. Someone is going to be right and someone is going to be wrong. We are definitely going to see the stock move by the end of the week."
New 52 wk low guaranteed this week
"Nike is dead, ua is the winner"
Like or dislike if you feel Under Armour will report good or bad earnings.
"I have to wonder why UA stock prices are not going anywhere? UA apparel is everywhere you look in the stores, on the streets and very popular with all ages of consumers."
UA upgraded outperform to strong buy $30 share price
"Under Armor stock could be Crushed!!While Under Armour Inc. (UAA) shares were surging Wednesday afternoon, there's one big long-term risk that looms as especially pertinent for investors to consider. If Under Armour doesn't hit a certain EBIT (earnings-before-interest-and-tax) margin, the stock may be perceived as a dead end for a long time, Morgan Stanley analyst Lauren Cassel wrote in a note late Tuesday evening. As for Wednesday, the stock rallied 6.47% to $23.21 each. The stock was up a bit in the morning, before really popping around noon, when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell spoke at The Economic Club in New York, and came off as slightly more dovish than he has all year."
Longs feeling good today
"What a crazy market. When a company beats on earnings and revs, but margins fall, they kill the stock. Unreal"
The bottom line is screaming the 6 -9 range. Brick and Motar companies not making money don't survive. Look at SHLD and JCP..
"I took back $300 worth of their gear last night that I bought last weekend, Plank can keep his politics and he can keep the gear i bought and returned!"
Lol sorry for your loss longs ahah
Hopefully Kevin Plank talks some more today and we see $16.'s!
Can Plank do planks?
none is buying their junk clothes
"I have inventoried sports wear of members at my gym in Ohio. UA beats Nike 3 to 1. UA seems to be more popular at least in my area. I wonder if UA is winning in the USA, and needs to increase its sales and revenue overseas. Thoughts?"
two years ago when this thing was at 45...some big hedge fund guy was buying hand over fist...kept saying he would tripple his money in 5 years....wonder how he feels now....
"Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back"
How do you post images on here?
UA. Just keeps getting beat down. No letting up on this beat down since Q2 earning release. This hasn’t been or will not be an easy turnaround.

"UA will eventually get bought out by Nike, UA won't survive another 5 years."
I work in a school and more kids wear UA than Nike. Even lunch boxes and accessories are getting more popular. I have a good feeling about UA!
"I like a lot their stuff and here in Europe they are becoming more popular, it’s the new thing beside the same old names, but in football they are basically non-existent they have to invest in that if they really want to grow."
"Fellas, don't worry about debt. Dominoes pizza stock price was $13 when they had 1 billion in debt. That crazy pizza company is now $200 share and still 800 million in debt. UA is a GREAT product, even MLB agrees!Stay patient....."

"Sharing 2 of John's posts from last month that I thought were very well written and particularly telling. What has changed in the last 30 days regarding UA as a long term hold??? Why continue to bash??? Read this good advise from last month authored by a current basher prior to dumping your shares.Johnlast month$UA conversationThink about this...everyone was falling over their feet for this company and stock up till now while stock was hitting all-time highs. Now, the stock is at a 70% discount and people hate it. This is CLASSIC. What really fundamentally changed other than the price of the stock? If someone were to offer you a dollar for a dollar, that isn't a great deal(UA at all-time high's and everyone loved this deal apparently as it was happening)....now the dollar within a year becomes a quarter and everyone thinks a quarter for a dollar or two over the next 7 years is a horrible deal. Long story short...people will never learn. Look at 2008....stock market sold off 60%....ppl were selling their stocks at lows....nobody liked the market....hated it...now the market hits all-time highs ever single day...PPL love it. lol. Suckers are born every single day. This stock is becoming more of a bargain every day now that it has sold off 70%. It isn't going bankrupt. It is GROWING. One should study oneself. I personally have no money invested in this anymore. But am thinking about getting back in as it continues to bottom out. Company has done what noboddy has predicted in 72 months. The stock price will sort itself out in time. Fools selling at these prices while buying high. Should not play the game. -ZJohnJohnlast monthReplied to a reaction$UA conversationso if someone bought at $25/share and 10 years from now...the stock is at 200/share....he lost what? Exactly. Warren Buffet and other smart money managers don't catch bottoms...they buy when a stock gets cheap understanding it can get cheaper. That's why people who are long term investors DCA....they aren't trying to sell when it goes lower if the company they like gets cheaper, they continue investing. All those who sold Amazon or even Apple during sell-offs...where are they now? Not as wealthy or wealthy period. Those who held or invested more....well you know where they are. That's how it works. Short term is impossible to predict. But UA's stock got ahead of itself...but the impacts its made in the sporting world in the last 72 months...tremendous and going to continue to reap rewards as the company learns from its current mistakes and gets better. Smart money is BUYING and holding. -Z"

2 years of investigation and nothing...
"Is anyone buying? Jefferies update today to buy seems to like an opinionated pump with unsubstantiated support. IMO it is not credible to buy even though it seems bottomed out... until Kevin Plank buys. Is he? From a recent CNBC interview, Plank was questioned if he would show confidence to investors to buy his stock & he repeatedly refused but continued to ramble about how UA had great things in the pipelines. It was talk, no show of action."

Dwayne Johnson buying the XFL ... nobody else see with his affiliation with UAA being a boost for the company?
Soon $15.50 and I an a buyer
$28 next week
UA and Macys both will fly soon
Analysts are more negative on this stock now than they have been in the last four months!
"Sorry if this has already been asked, but why are there 2 ticker symbols for Under Armor? There's UA and then there's UAA. What's up with this?"
They need to dump Jordan Spieth. He’s no longer a force in golf. Tying up golfers in long expensive contracts worth $10’s of millions of dollars is foolish these days.
"I went to a University of Maryland football game yesterday. The CEO of Under Armour is a graduate of the University of Maryland and Under Armour is a major sponsor at the Maryland football games.I will NEVER buy another Under Armour product or go to another Maryland football game again. It is obvious that the degrading treatment of fans is a reason Maryland has little fan support.Why?1. They treat the fans, especially non-Muslim women like criminals before they even get into the game. Women are ""electronically"" violated, strip of their possessions, not allowed to take in a pocket book, and forced to put even their personal items like tampons and other sensitive items in clear bags that they must carry around in public while in the stadium.2. If you are Muslim, you can bring in anything and you bypass all the ""electronic"" security humiliations.3. A individual involved in a murder, Ray Lewis, who played for the Baltimore Ravens, is constantly heard in the numerous Under Armour commercials on the jumbo trons.Thus, if you are criminal or Muslim you are welcome at Maryland football games. If you a law abiding Christian, Jewish, Agnostic female be prepared to be humiliated and threatened by the University of Maryland."
The UA outlet store was packed on a Sunday morning! Seems encouraging.
ER will correct it below $7.00
CEO of Under Armor is selling up to 2.075 million shares. His ownership is going down from 15.6% to 15.2% $UA
Sam Poser is a #$%$ moron
He’s back! Slam dunk time. Lets get this thing back on TRACK now. GLTA
My buddy in retail M&A told me Nike taking a hard look at UA especially with where market cap is right now! 
anyone else see the nike gloved eagle ftball player strip the ball from tom brady's UA gloved hands?
They can sell online they do not need the stores
Another re-structure. Scrapping the highly touted GM model of the last few years. Another re-start. It is no wonder that this company makes zero actual progress in terms of growth with all the money wasted in these transitions. How does the Board allow the management team to continue?
"I’m in too now!! The story is the Feds have been there since 2017!!! If you don’t think they have been dotting all their i’s and crossing all their t’s, then you are crazy!! And if they weren’t we wouldn’t be hearing about it 3 years later!! This would have blown up in 2017 or at the very latest 2018! Also, if this was as bad as the reaction to the stock became, then there is no way it wouldn’t have leaked sooner than late 2019!!! They couldn’t come out and say it yet but we are likely going to hear an announcement soon that this is all cleared up and appropriate action has already been taken!!! CASE CLOSED!!! Get in now... you’ve been notified..."
OMG. Federal investigation. This is gonna be a bloodbath tomorrow.
Think about this.....there are approximately 300 billion people world wide in the age brackets that would buy Under Armor. In the next 10 years that number goes to about 500 billion. That's 2 billion possible new customers for Under Armor who is focusing on growing world wide distribution. In for the long haul.
This is what happens when you run up a stock 5 days in a row before earnings. Renting the FAO Schwartz store in NYC for $20 million a year is probably not good either.
Did they scam the shareholders? GE had the same dipped under $10
as popular. as $UA is with all the athletes.. that Immediately tells me that it's a poorly run company... how sad... I actually like $UA
The question is....is UA now woke enough to get positive media coverage tomorrow?
I thought UA was gonna destroy Lulu....lol. Guess not.
"buy all dips when you think the bottom is in ,save some much dry powder and load up !!gonna be fun tomorrow !"
dead money now
"This is looking more and more like a crime scene here,big overhyped projections to investors just last quarter and now cut from 20% growth to 5% growth in Q1 and CEO quits on top of it all?"
"Holding this stock for 3 years, I have never suffered like this before, it is similar to Chinese torture, I have no hope anymore."
"Bought some today chance of going a bit lower., but great price at 14"
Target Est : 19.00 from 17 to 19
UAA is down 4.97% to 17.59
UAA reached a 52 Week low at 14.01
Tesla up $100. share in just over 2 months! Unreal!
Good brand and great quality products! Just ignore free advice from no-name analysts! They are not serving you!
Mgt. knew
"RIP Mike, nsip, and John Short sellers who didn't quite make it."
Plank tanked UA all by himself... not cool...
Trump met with commissioners and owners of all major sports leagues yesterday. Optimistic discussions.
"squeeze, squeeze i might see green again"
Cramer was behind me selling FB in 2013 at $32 and BABA in april at $110 in 03/2017. This guy is a moron.
I don't know about single digits but worse case scenario has this mid $12.'s in the Perfect Storm of Market Crash and share offering!
"Hey Nancy, where did you find that info? Gshaun is not smart enough to find it. The only thing he can do is hype a loser. He does not realize that he is hyping a #$%$. But apparently the analysts know. This SEC probe has been ongoing since last June."
Looks like we will close above the 52 week low... at 5x volume.... when am I supposed to jump in?
"Best Relative performance in the sector. Top 5 1- $FOSL 2 - GIII 3- $UA than $hbi and last $LULU,,It's on sale..."
"All you shorts are pretty funny. Your silly rants are aided by a couple days of an overall down market and your way overblown #$%$ about how bad this company is. Anyone with a brain can read a bit of statistics and look at the over all picture will understand that the company is still on extremely solid footing. Oh...it dropped because analysts continued to expect this excellent company to continue 20%+ growth per year! Reallty??? So nobody thinks 10-11% growth is any good anymore? Really?? You guys need to get a life and stop your BS. It's oversold. I fully expect it to recover at least 50% of today's drop within a week, if not less. And if one has to wait a month to gain back this 5% drop, yeah...that's fine too. That's equal to a 60%+ annual return. I'll take that too. So...again...y'all cool it with your #$%$. This healthy market leading company is just fine."
"12.65, then 11.50 if you just play the charts"
UAA is up 4.94% to 22.96
painful stock to own
Might VF be interested at these levels?
"All operating matrix improved. This is great thing. USA decline now clearly due to major partner channel bankruptcy (Sport Authority and other) Given direct to consumer picking up, It's not really material to stock anyway.In 2018 even USA growth will return I think."
Long term UA is way undervalued. For certain.
go ahead and sell.. I'll keep buying and laugh all the way to the bank in a few years
"The CEO of this company is a pompous auss. He is now into his new business and new love, the love of Whiskey and money. Under Armor was his old gig, now after he made billions and sold tons of stock in UA, let the old business of garments die and the new business of Whiskey live and thrive."
Too much support
"I’m pulling for them and gonna hold til I get even, but honestly this stock is the biggest blunder of my short investing career. Averaged at 32.50. Ugh!"
I don't get what is so baad about being in Kohls. somehow that is awful for Under Armour but no one seems to mention that Adidas and Nike are in Kohls too
Now is the time to be buying not selling. Easy money to be made here in 2 years. Remember wall street is full of crooks. Need to trade against the tide.
Could be the last day to add under $20 Big news is coming this week.
WHEN IS EARNINGS??
I say 22 by June and staying long.
"I sold yesterday am @ 21.26 most of my psn. I am kinda surprised their has been no follow through, particularly on an up day like this. Feel like I made a good decision and 50% in a year, better opportuntiies elsewhere"
Under Armour = Under Valued. What will this stock be in 2 years when they begin to own baseball? All the kids are wearing UA and will as they grow up.
I see you guys put all your trust in one shoe? Nike sells 100 of pairs like the hovr adidas also
$UAA Target Raised by Piper Sandler Neutral USD 10 » USD 14
"just about ready to start up, over $21 before you know it"
TIMBER
Loaded up at $19.03. Sell off is overdone
UAA reached a 52 Week low at 15.05
Time to take out profits......... looks like $15-$16 around the bend
"Little too late for Plank to be writing ""Keep UA simple"" on his white board...you are making tech sleepwear for goodness sake. What is the vision of this company anymore?!?!"
"i like UA gear, but i never pay full price"
Paging Mike on aisle 6! We need a basher cleanup with basher tears. Someone thought it was going to $8 but we are over $20.
"Martin i dont hear anything from you, all those views"
UA is the future
This stock will keep going up people!! Remember UA will start making all of the uniforms for MLB. The deal starts in 2018.
Shorts are comming...!!! it is going down finally....
"Pre-earnings short squeeze, but will earnings warrant it tomorrow? Hope to see signs of stabilization and the potential for a return to growth."
it might drop to $12 again ...
When will UA have to start writing down the $700m they spent on connected fitness? This is Apple's game.
"Just think, if you had voting rights, you could walk the Plank."
may Nike will buy UA
"The bad thing about companies in this business area is that have run up 200 or 300 percent for the last year, you better have earning better then expected and have numbers going forward better then expected. Not the case with UAA... Every analyst expects them to miss, and if they speak that current estimates going forward stand... This is a $22 stock next week.Buying the valley!"
what a day
"I’m a small time trader with a few million spread out in the market. Best of breed in some sectors is my strategy for years and it’s worked. After seeing the product line at a huge UA outlet in Lake George NY and how packed it was I purchased 5,000 shares last week.I’m cool holding this is going to $30 millennials love UA and sports are starting up again these analysts are downplaying the potential of UA and its earnings."
18 by friday
UA reached a new 52 Week High at 22.03
UAA reached a 52 Week low at 13.54
Hard to believe was up 12 percent in premarket Friday..
This will lose all the gains today and end negative
Down! Down! Down! Wait til' Kohls announces store closings! UA overpriced China junk and NBA star choking big time! $15.'s next!
Why haven’t the institutional investors on the board fired Kevin Plank? Are they a bunch of dummies watching their investment being burned by the incompetent Plank?
So much for the UA run it’s over maybe under $15 I would start building a new position but I think I am done with
"Elizabeth Holmes, could be added to your board.Holmes has avoided being prosecuted while some inner city kidis doing time for smoking Pot. Very fair!Elizabeth Holmes is bogus, and so is senior management of UA!"
"Tough to sell Asian sweat shop shoes, wife beaters, ghetto jorts and other useless, overpriced apparel when you sidle up to the next Ay Dolf and one of your star players reveals that His Hairness is a racist, as if nobody realized that."
will be buying under armor now on
Nothing more than inflated bubble.
Did you met sally?
The Rock's new line is already a HUGE seller. His training shoes are some of the fastest sellers ever sold by UA.
"This stock within a year will be at $12. Kevin Plank lost control over his vision, his direction and most of all his patience."
Who thinks i should invest rn
Ua news kevin plank builds hotel. Really? Every time you show your face stock drops.
Lol all that sell now stuff
"I love UA and have lot of their shoes, but their performance is below expectation!Can someone explain how upgrade from $10 to $13 price target = $16.14 closing price?It seems some zombie got drunk again?? There is too much manipulation at wall street. Lunatic price movement does not make any sense."
i wont put too much emphasis on shoes
"I recently bought into this stock at $16 and figured I’d go to the local outlet mall to check out the foot traffic. It was the busiest store at the mall, we are sitting pretty!!!"
sinking ship. sad coz they have good product line
This will be trading with jcp soon
This compnay will be taken over by either private equity fund or by Nike. It is cheap. The CEO lost his compass by going into the Booze business while he was heading a fledgling company which was a symbol of health and fitness.
This is going green today.
UAA is up 7.85% to 23.77
"Jesus.....This stock is much more likely to go down tomorrow morning, than up! 100"
maybe $45
"Some financials about UA from Yahoo:1. Forward PE of 45; Trailing PE 1,7032. Profit margin 0.12%3. Return on equity 0.32%4. YoY revenue growth 1.6%5. Debt/Equity = 63Can someone explain why UA deserves a whopping FPE of 45 (more than tech companies that are growing in double digit)?"
Hate this new Yahoo format
I am afraid that right now the machines (AI blah) the market makers (or mafia) can know every holder's position and trade against them.
"join the ranks of GE and Disney, this is just the beginning"
This will TIMBER like you’ve never seen..
ua will close gap at 15 today watch the news
"Up in the after hours, Im buying drink to everybody in the bar tomorrow"
So why is this falling?
Time for your investments to get hammered plank . It’s time we show you how we feel about you not doing your job. Look at the ua news . Kevin plank hotel and whiskey. We know you don’t care and your hotel will sink pig.
John probably
Embarrassed to say I own the stock. But it deserves to go down having a #$%$ of a CEO like Plank.
Nice upgrade
Anyone on this board I can become obsessed with and stalk from board to board?
I will buy at 9 soon.
"Finally, finally, Kevin Plank did something right. He distanced himself from the orange clown in the white house. But it took him long enough. But I give him some credit today for finally showing us he has a back bone.Unfortunately, he is still a stupid business man. Who has made many, many stupid mistakes the past two years. Resulting in the destruction of the stock price.But hey, thanks Kevin, for finally seeing we have the worst president imaginable in the White House. Now, can you help us impeach him?????"
The same old man saying the same on Bloomsberg? Nothing is new. This is how analysts cover some big shorts.

"CEO just stated we are disappointed.. No duh.. Get out, the CEO doesn't know what to do"
love ua products but the company is going to single digits
This is most likely going to go down today because of planks decision. Don't mix politics with business... most of your North American sales are to Trump supporters you don't want to disrespect them and you also don't want to disrespect Hillary supporters. Sad. When will they learn? Still going to go long on this one but get ready for boycotts.
Better to be long the UA [class c shares] record short interest -13.79% of float UAA [class A shares] have a -7.59% short interest and the spread between both shares classes is over 16.25% a record. Swap your UAA shares for UA.
Ill buy at 3 dollars again
"Where is my post, yahoo? This is Kim K West."
-.20 a share not for me!
Before UA Boycott business was1/2 of what they projected thanks to bankruptcy by sports authority and others and next quarter it will be 1/2 of that 1/2 less because of a nation wide Boycott! Unbelievable! What a story this is turning out to be!
"Well after Nike stupid statement, I'm going back to UA."
"saw that coming, but the puts in this market are too crazy for me.HBI should buy them"
Hahahahahahahaha. Just another scam. Plank on CNBC handing over the reigns fully knowing this fed investigation underway. What a pack of criminals.
"Only big sizes sell out meaning only fatties like sam poser wear the brand. Meaning hip kids will never buy it anymore. Bye bye under armour, even here in europe its the trailertrash brand"
Sell UAA today and buy it back in a few weeks when it is cheaper.
These MF shorts with the spam post gotta go it’s annoying I want to enjoy $40 end of the year
THANK YOU NIKE
FPE is now 46.3 - that's amazing. UA knows no law of gravity!
"Under Armour’s Class A common stock and Class C common stock are each listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbols “UAA” and “UA” respectively. To purchase Under Armour stock, please consult the stockbroker or stock purchase service of your choice."
This stock is not dead. As much as people believe that it will come back better than ever.
"watching college ball and see UA all over. Boston College, UCLA, ND. See them on AL/NL equipment and will be on their uniforms soon. Need to get in Euro soccer"
short 1k shares at 13.34
Based on the downturn today I'm guessing the earnings call Tuesday will be a big bucket of bad news.
"Top Under Armour Execs Face Enforcement Action Over SEC ProbeGood Lord, why is this green? It should be down 30% or more."
I got back in today! This management team has something to prove!
Planks insider trading finally caught up with him !!!
Just bought anthers 500 shares
i want to seehow inflated the accounting is before i buy.
"LMFO! When UAA was around $12 a share the loser analysts were saying it's over, sell.Now that it's back up to over $25 they're saying buy??"
"Well, we finally get a good report with icing on the cake being the sale of myfitnesspal for 345 million. Hope to be even today. Need a close at $15.25."
What’s going on
Going up higher in after hours!
Buy before Golden State wins the finals and the shoe sales heat up the rest of 2017!
"Under Armour’s sole bond issue downgraded to junk status! Ouch!S&P cited competitive and pricing pressures, as well as weak operational execution by the company for its ratings action"
UA > nike I'll take Tom Brady over that useless terrorist kapernick any day of the week.
here comes 20-22 range....You know it ... about to pop....
When is UA earnings
UAA - Where women and men bang each other
U A IS THE FUTURE OF THE SPORTS INDUSTRY.
"Going to single digits...soon. C-level is out of touch with consumer. Frisk and his team of know-nothings have tied the whole turnaround message to this strategy developed by BCG, and it is way way off. iThey can't go back now or else the whole sr. exec team is exposed as a fraud...tough spot for them...will be interesting to see over next 3 quarters how they react..."
super low volume lately..
"Plank resigns prior to earnings. Hmm, a miss in the forecast?"
This is in rador for a while..a missed opportunity
I never had regrets in investing or gambling but this one made me think a lot!
just because i longed it They are trying to bring it down
Great. One last thrust into our rear ends to finish out 2017. Thanks Plank you loser.
This thing looks like dog 5#!+
Taking any short term profit! Expect sell off into close on any up day!
"So what if anything might help us regain our losses? I think a new CEO, major restructuring, or a potential sale of the company would get us there. Does anyone have thought on the viability of any of those 3 happening?"
All law ABIDING ethical decent Americans started our UA BOYCOTT today. #$%$ sporting goods is our first target. If they DON'T remove UA cheaply made sheet Americans will stop shopping there.Pick up your phones and start calling #$%$ and work your way from there.Lib Dem communists must be stopped from destroying America.
"rename it OP, overpriced polyester"
When does UA release earnings? Thanks
Should drop PE of 25
"Would anybody be interested in filing a lawsuit again Kevin Plank not UA I think Plank should go to prison for violating how many acts lying to investors to keep them in the stock, selling before anyone else knew the bad news this guy is corrupt and should not be admired no company in their right mind would buy UA but they might just might take the company for free but I doubt it they wouldn't want all the baggage that comes with this #$%$ company"
"Yea, I get the UA as a men's line thing, but I have to say I see a lot of people (both men & women) wearing it. That's why I bought it. I'm not too concerned about Amazon, either. UA is a brand, and they sell on AMZ all day long. The clothes are comfortable, and they have a good rep. The shoes, though, are a concern, but I think they'll work them out."
"I am not an Under Armor shareholder but do (now did) like their products. You won't see me purchasing another UA item. Looking at the share price, it is over 50% below its 52 week high. This CEO must be mentally bankrupt to mix politics and his company. I put him in the same boat with the CEO of Target, where I also refuse to shop.I am a MRK shareholder and I am writing the BOD to ask them why they would condone their CEO to be a paid protester. I would think you would have a lot better chance influencing policy and the POTUS on the council, versus the sidelines."
"its all a scam stocks, this company was all fraud and screwed you all"
What is the difference between UA and UAA
"Some Activists are vowing to Boycott Baltimore based Under Armour,no talk of what Athletes will Boycott Under Armour next,or what Sports Teams will Boycott Under Armour! Getting real messy!"
why are there so few analysts with earnings and revenue projections for UA?
"if KP's ego would get out of the way...and they got back to making great product and not try so hard to be cool.. maybe if KP didn't fire all the great people who started the UA journey with him ... and maybe ditch the ballerina, the bad actor and the left coast warrior ..... or maybe just sell it outright ........"
Nice Chart! Looks like $15's Imminent!
"UA is going to have a great quarter, Project Rock is selling out across the board. All UA product in high demand and selling in all locations."
1 yr target est 16??
Sold 240 shares today for $13.70....Today was the 5th day in a row UA has gained on the day. I see this stock sliding tomorrow and buying back the 240 shares a decent amount lower than $13.70. There's a lot of resistance before getting to $14.00
if jordan spieth wins today this stock will go up happens everytime
"Curry, the Golden State Warriors’ two-time NBA MVP, has a endorsement contract with Under Armour running through 2024 that’s reportedly worth more than $4 million a year.On Tuesday, Plank told CNBC that Trump was good for American business. “To have such a pro-business president is something that is a real asset for the country,” he said. On Wednesday, the company released a statement that stressed it was focused on business issues, not Trump’s controversial actions. “We engage in policy, not politics,” the statement said.In an interview with the San Jose Mercury News, Curry said he was surprised that Plank had praised Trump, but that didn’t mean he would leave the sneaker and apparel company — yet. “It’s a fine line but it’s about how we’re operating,” Curry said, “how inclusive we are, what we stand for.”But Curry said he would leave if that fine line were crossed. “If I can say the leadership is not in line with my core values, then there is no amount of money, there is no platform I wouldn’t jump off if it wasn’t in line with who I am.”Losing Curry would be a disaster for Under Armour UAA, +2.98% . Curry is the company’s most important athlete endorsement, with Morgan Stanley pegging his value to Under Armour at $14.1 billion in 2016. Under Armour stock received a number of downgrades in the past week after posting disappointing earnings. The company’s shares are down more than 30% in the past month, and down almost 73% in the past 12 months.More from MarketWatch Nordstrom recovers from Trump’s ‘Terrible!’ tweet in just 4 minutes Could This Pair of Eyeglasses Mean the End of Bifocals?

Every other stock in my portfolio is green today.....except.....you guess it......the biggest POS stock in the world. Underarmor. THANKS KEVIN PLANK FOR BEING THE WORST POS CEO IN THE WORLD. NOW PLEASE QUIT OR BE FIRED.WHAT I WOULDN'T GIVE FOR AN ACTIVIST INVESTOR TO COME IN AND FIRE PLANK. THE STOCK WOULD POP 20% THAT DAY AND I WOULD SELL AND NEVER LOOK BACK. WHAT A POS INVESTMENT THIS STOCK HAS BEEN.
UAA reached a 52 Week low at 13.37
"I'm assuming Hedge Funds are pumping this while trying to get the hell out before realty hits and it tanks big-time...who would buy it right now? You have to be crazy to buy, this could easily go down a few bucks."
$16.'s ! PE still too high Plank!
going green last hr
Market double top...UA heading back to lows.
Looks like Lots of news and possible increased institutional holdings this market.This is just awesome. https://rebrand.ly/MassiveBreakOut
I have a Golf shirt by UA called cold black it is the best thing I have ever worn on the golf course!!! They have very good men's apparel. My wife can't stand their stuff!!Maybe they should join up with Fabletics or lulu or aritzia!
"You people can't even write , how could anyone take investing advice from here ."
BREAKING: Under Armour considering bankruptcy protection as sales continue to plummet.
"Can anyone post the link to Patrick’s interview on cnbc,"
Within 2 weeks...: We will see US$24
The CEO did enjoy a lot of trust. Plank has some work to do. He has potentially put his company in play by taking his eye off the ball. It seems he got his outside interests confused with his core wealth builder. He is smart and will go back to work. Hope he does it before he loses control. Good man just went on automatic too soon.
Looks like shorts covered yesterday to be back in the black. Now new long positions probably have opened considering the hefty discount.
This is how it is done.https://finance.yahoo.com/video/adidas-shares-jump-increase-profitability-171900973.html
BofA downgraded UA today and set a price target of $12 down from $21.
The reason they’re being investigated is that Kevin Plank supported Trump
"I hope the Curry 6s are great performing shoes, because they’re terrible looking."
UA is up 4.92% to $17.36
"This is improving but slowly. Glad they committed internationally or this would be grim. It looks like a very slow recovery needing a lot of patience. I bought around 13, I may move on, their are so many more exciting ideas right now"
Wow the valuation is absurd
Lots of warrants needed to be cash in .. I have to sell half of shares here it run quite a bit .. hoping to pick up in the 20’s again ..
"ceo must stay and stop politicaly views,short this pig."
"Nice to finally see an up day. UAA has been not getting any love recently, but I feel things will change with our next earnings release."
"Under Armour to $100,000 -- Just come out with the Bitcoin inspired line! All self respecting athlete will drop $50,000 for a pair of shoes that have a piece of a Bitcoin!"
Nothing will damage your company image more than being pro-Trump!
UAA is up 7.61% to 9.90
"1.1 P/S, restructuring charges behind them, retailers selling their products over the holidays killed it (Kohl’s), shorts holding down a great company at such a small market cap... looking for a squeeze come earnings time like that of SNAP or VRX... GLTA longs"
Looking to scoop up some shares if it dips to $17.50...
here comes 17.8 -
what's the difference between UA and UAA?
"should media or ANALysts be banned from talking about stock prices!?if they can move the stock prices, then that should be banned!"
A real Cry Baby The CEO OF UA -
Boy if u sold at 14 you’re lucky. Hitting nbc nightly news now
Jeebsie that's gotta be the dumbest comment I have ever heard.
Anyone hearing this! Sounds like they’re going bankrupt
21 tomorrow after Nike’s earnings
Re: o.http://www.businessinsider.com/teens-say-under-armour-isnt-cool-2018-0pepper jefferys is a shomofo.o..
Could someone help me understand the premium given class A shares over class C. My understanding is that C has no vote and A has 1 vote. The CEO also holds class B which has 10 votes and therefore he controls 65% of the voting shares. Why such a large premium for what appears to be a meaningless vote?
"Oh please shut up, next quarter they will be down! After all the exposure with the rock the curry 4 and hovr shoes went up 0.8% now that should be worrying you guys. That is why i sold, no future growth dead share for at least a year"
Added more today. I never bet against UA. One of the best brands out there.
So when retail giant Walmart cuts prices on UA gear it's because it's such a hot seller? Face it UA has peaked and now facing retail hell as all other brick and mortar stores except in the case of NiKE and Addidas they can afford to build their own stores to control inventory and avoid sports retailers that go bankrupt where as UA has a Junk bond rating and will be lucky to get a car loan!
CNBC just hammered UAA.
Dang..pity the poor bag holders on this dog..
How long will this lawsuit take I bought jan 17 call options before this happened ?

Issuing debt
Huge sell-off in tech stocks today; maybe fund managers will consider putting their money into undervalued stocks like UAA. Wink wink
Kevin Plank should probably worry about his plunging stock price rather than his political stance. Oh wait that's why he created a stock class with no voting rights.
Vs I hope your right this F ing rollar coaster ride is making me dizzy
Excellent move today. Look for confirmation tomorrow.
disappointed that UA pushed back their MLB agreement to 2020. I was looking forward to hearing about this in the upcoming press conference since it is hardly ever mentioned. I felt it was the ace in the hole to give this stock the much needed boost.
This Cody guy is a moron. like if you agree
"Why am I buying UA? Because I love their products, and I believe their upper management just learned a hard lesson. As a result, they're making moves to turn things around in an aggressive way. Yup, I'm long on Under Armour."
"How do you think most of corporate America does biz? This includes the last 50 years at IBM. Trust me, it's not the golf outings that contracts get signed. LolThis too shall pass. UA is going higher, much higher."
Just curious to see what people think of this stock moving forward the next year? Is this a hidden gem at such a low price? Can we see it hit $90 in the next couple years?
What a crazy market. I bought shares of AAPL at their all time high and those are under water too!!
"Social Media all over Kevin Planks comments about Trump,Activists vowing to Boycott UA,opening the door for Major League Sports Teams and Athletes to join in the Boycott! Wow!"
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analyst-under-armour-risks-prolonged-164152348.html
gotta love UA's subtle product placement in several Netflix series
Analyst are crooks.......period
UA made these mistakes.. Over expanding to quickly burning through cash and adding debt.. Over paying dumb athletes. Thinking people will continue to over pay for their brand name and not realizing athletic apparel changes. Getting involved in politics.. Now dead money for a year
stock has done nothing but disappoint and drop.... who would buy this garbage
Sounds like WeWork .... low margin textile company trying to be a Tech stock UA trading at a 65 P/E ratio
Not so sure why an investor would invest on UA lol
I was getting sick and tired of getting creamed in the markets and then I joined this one website I found online and the picks have been awesome. If you want solid stock tips delivered to your inbox all you need to do is go to the-stockdork .
Lol at all of the shorts on this board hahahah..... they are trying SO hard to slander this company it's becoming comical. This nsip guys is probably the biggest moron here
"Take her down, Take her deep. make the stock really cheap"
Too bad for shorts with options expiring on Fri.
"UA needs to stayed focused on their turnaround, open up the focus for women in the growing market of roughfit, crossfit, spartan, outdoor and active fitness that extents beyond the mall style Lulu. UA is You. This will be $30+ by 2020."
UAA reached a 52 Week low at 16.26
What the hell UA
sweet UAA
Any thoughts on close today?
patience.... Soon will be moving higher
I'm the three fingered knife catcher.... but not sure I touch this over 13.
They’re raising to premium prices and gonna turn everyone away....... who’s running this business n e way???
hi I am new here for UA. from what I see dump this right now or wait 3-5 years for a turn around
"Treading Water! Watch for sell off into close,UA lucky Market not tanking yet! But when Market does tank watch out below for all stocks with PE values way too high! Careful here!"
"Mike is another idiot short on this board. get the f off this page if you dont like the stock, moron"
so many UA brand haters. must be Colin Kaepornick fans.
As i have said before UAA should buy Fitbit. Its the future.
Long term this will work out for everyone
Sold all my UA holdings today. Sick of rich whiny athletes and clueless management.
"UA will be down around $3.5B in top line Rev for 2020, which is just amazing based on where this brand once was. Also, big layoff must be coming by end of month as part of restructuring by end of Q2 as they try and maintain profitability levels."
"I dont pretend to be, i just know this is a sentiment stock. It will go up cause like i said and vrash again. Pump and cash out on time is what i do"
Is Jim Cramer still this company's biggest cheerleader? just wondering
last chance to buy in ....very cheap
it will cross over $18 then dump. volume only double the average so far and early in the day
uaa held strong at 20.50
"Yes, i bought some extra. Hovr sold out in europe. New arrivals also selling out. Direct to consumer numbers will go up double digits, overseas sales will double again. Will go to 50-60 and drop to 15 again next yearWho wants to bet"
"went to UA stores over the weekend, found that they cut prices on many items"
This UAA thing can easily be brought down by badmouths
This thing is going to 20. See all the bashers quietly buying
"During an interview Tuesday on CNBC, Plank called Trump ""highly passionate"" and said having a pro-business president can be a ""real asset for the country."" The comments received criticism across social media from those who don't support Trump. Some activists are vowing to boycott Baltimore-based Under Armour (NYSE: UA)."

"For how long will the US Government continue to PUMP the US Stock Prices artificially? Everyone knows that the US Market is in the MEGA BUBBLE; it is even more overvalued than Tulip Mania Bubble! The US Stocks are INSANELY OVERVALUED and OVERBOUGHT! The Valuations are impossible to justify!For how long can the US Government run this fraudulent Stock BUBBLE, while Corporate revenues are tanking, Corporate and National Debt is Astronomical, the Valuations are beyond insanity, Political polarization is at max, there are ongoing and upcoming wars, the real resources are limited, Economy is Collapsing, Competition is intense, the Stock Dilutions are at record highs, everything is getting worse, China, Russia, and many other countries are set to ditch the US Dollar as an international reserve currency. Now there are 100,000s of companies worldwide competing for $1 revenue! The US Companies that barely generate revenue of $1-2 million are trading at $50-60 Billion Market values, while in Asia, the same companies with better fundamentals, 100 times more revenues, are trading at 99% less market value! The US Company valuations DO NOT MAKE Sense at all! Why would one invest in US Stock Tulip Mania while he/she can buy the 1000 times better company share for a 99% cheaper price? The US Stock Market is a MAJOR PONZI SCHEME designed to patch fraudulent pension systems in the US temporarily! There is NO PROPER Revenue Collection by the IRS since 2016. Taxes are extremely Low, and Nobody is paying custom duties! People want more free money without working, more free checks, more capital gains, more stock hypes every day!

This is going to 27 !This analysis not a request and presentation
"Retails have been down, folks were not careful"
back to 20 next week
Going to $5 soon
"Nice deep long bottom, getting weak hands outs, time for believers and smart money to accumulate for the long haul. Like if you agree UA will produce better returns than NKE"
"trolls lulu forum is open for criticism, make your way over there."
Going to get a lot of market share from nike...this will help the brand back onto the long sustained groth path.We have seen the bottom and it will get progressively better from here forward...
Which is better buy UA or UAA?
Plank is a pig #$%$
this will go to 28$ after the earningswe will see !
For me this brand can compete with Adidas and Nike! It has its own brand essence and should continue to grow imo.
"love their shoes, great company, has great team of very capable people, needs some time...."
"Tough sledding here with Curry brand launch. The Rock has a built in audience that is global and massive (6-7x of what Curry has on IG alone), so I think that is a really tough comparison. Best guess is this settles into a little niche type brand that has a few product capsules to keep SC satisfied, nothing more. They can't waste brand marketing dollars on something so small."
I can't believe that what I'm trying to post here in regards to the ongoing situation with Kevin Plank's position on Trump is being censured. BUT IT IS!!!!
New 52 week high!
Forget about getting in at $ 16.95 this thing has no foreseeable bottom.
"I don't understand the hate that UA gets. I work out 6 days a week and see way more of their stuff than Nike (except shoes, I don't know if they can catch in shoes). I am 24 and all of my friends and I buy and wear 90% UA because of the fit and the fabric of the shirts. Aside from the awful CEO (which I don't see lasting another year) and the lack if international interest.. why is this stock struggling so much? They make a great product and I load up every time it dips, I'm banking on the (very) long term."
Im holding this baby this $8 - 5k shares.
Why is my posting of NFL Being deleted? This is the third time I have posted it!!
"UA has $165M in cash against $1.8B in debt. They are not making a profit. They are not growing. And they are valued (market cap) as much as Skechers (SKX) which has $800M in cash against $77M in debt, while earning a healthy profit, and growing at a 14% rate. What sane person would invest in UA when you could invest in SKX???"
This will be up tomorrow mark my words
They should hire Goldman and explore strategic options NOW!
Accounting issues probably true due to plank using UA to fund his other business ventures now he?s getting out before the #$%$ really hits the fan. Also a change at CEO usually always cause alittle down fall until the new ceo gets his system and changes in place. Also most UA problem is that their products are over price not under priced like they are saying! This will go down to about 9.50-10/ share then creep back up to 22-24 over a year. This won?t be back up to 22-24 till this time next year and if it does it will only be due to pumping the stock. Just my opinion
Let’s goooooooo
Neo and Selig must be Nike Executives.... They are wack...
Going be back up to to upper 20s this week
Just a lot of competetion in this space...don't know which one to choose...any advice?
Under Armour is up 8.34% to 10.32
Didn't you find it strange that the WSJ found a memo from February just as the stock started to break out? I wonder who gave it to them?
10 today!
Sad. So disappointed - such high hopes and sadly need to harvest a loss. Oh wait!!!
This conference is a joke
iIt's going to $20 soon... start BUYING
"UA at almost 20 bucks. I’ve got a boat load of July calls, $25 strike. *IF* earnings are good, we might see 22-25 next week & I will be in the money."
I think this will explode today...easy $15-$16
Be careful..!!! Next quarter earning is negative again...
"I am truly enjoying the implosion of Under wAre. Just another company that tries to prey on the impressionable youth and sell them Chinese junk at inflated prices so they can, ""be cool."" Let me tell you predators something .. my kids are way cooler than those suburban toads who have to load up on the latest trend in order to fit in. I am fifty five years old, in top shape, ex-military and wouldn't even think about putting that metrosexual garb on. It's not the shirt, it's the countless hours on the bike and on the trail that make the person an athlete."
Under armor is like a gold brick in the future will be raining down money
Time to wake up UAA
Always fade Goldman... They're working out losing positions on retail saps...
"Soon all retailer stocks will be worthless,expect $12. to $13. range next!"
When this goes down in price y'all should know it's because Under Armor was recently charged by the SEC with misleading investors. They failed to disclose known uncertainties about it's future revenue prospects.
"Sometimes you need to take your loss, i did."
"not a bad bounce off of the 52 week low yesterday, time to buy more with the 4th qtr expecting to rise"
sold all my shrs to bagholders
"I dont understand why UA market cap is alot less than lulu and puma when UA still have a comparable gross revenue as puma and alot more than lulu at current time. I understand virus will affect the stock, but it seems it is oversold. some smart investor/institution may just pick up shares at this level and make huge profit later"
Buy or not buy? How low do you think this will go?
"2019 will be a good 3 to 4 dollar rise in stock for sure. U.S. military and elite colleges lime Notre Dame and Wisconsin are buying the sportswear. High Schools and police dept are also stocking up across U.S. Also, dead beat execs got fired and replaced with young ambitious execs. Get ready for a nice ride up!!! I called it last year and made 50pct on this bad boy!!!"
UA is down -4.94% to 19.53
Nice volume today this is going to breakout into the $20s real soon. WE KNOW
so cheap it to buy
opening bell on Wednesday crashing below $9 downgrade coming
"How does it feel to be a bagholder for this awful stock? Seriously, you clowns have no idea whether this junk will go up or down on any given day. You have Jordan Spieth on the payola plan and he choked at the Masters' tournament. Yeah, he's a good guy and he had a good last round, but he lost and you are paying for that.Let me tell what it's like. Your company is evil and hires untold legions of MBAs and marketing analysts to try and brainwash my kids into buying your Chinese made junk. Your junk is no different from any other junk. Huge markup, big sweatshops in Asia, sexy marketing that tries to tell kids that they are inadequate unless they wear UnderwAre junk.This is a flea market junk company from top to bottom. Huge payoffs to professionals, the message being that, ""if you wear our junk, you can be Jordan Speith.""Do you not realize that this is a ten thousand year old marketing scam that tries to brainwash the young using simplistic and evil, predatory tactics?Is it really worth a few bucks to hawk this junk to impressionable young people and use their insecurities to enrich yourselves?Funny how longs in junk stocks such as this try to take the high road and pimp this stock as something worthwhile.I really, truly hope you lose huge amounts of money, first by using Asian slaves to produce your junk, and secondly for trying to brainwash my kids. I have millions of dollars in the bank, so don't try to paint me as a desperate short or a troll or a wannabee, or whatever.I hope you lose your entire investment. This is a sin stock, probably as bad as, or worse than cigarettes and/or alcohol. A genuinely reprehensible company bent on push marketing to the impressionable young."
"I see no comments/opinions about Kevin Plank making positive statements regarding sales being solid for 2016 but behind closed doors the writing was on the wall in red that the company's forecast would not meet the projected numbers and Plank sold his personal UA stock that in the end mislead the stockholders. My opinion on Kevin Plank has changed 100%. Not even sure I want to wear his clothes anymore. As of today, the company isn't paying their bills and they're holding onto cash. Another sign of trouble the company is selling their clothes at Kohls...in my opinion that's like selling their clothes in Walmart. The company is in trouble because greed took over."
sees 19 before 13
another problem for UA is durability of their clothes ...
Don't know what is holding this up. Too many questions to hold onto this stock. Maybe pump and dump.
Investigation take a toll. Back to 7s
"When will the board wake up and fire Kevin Plank. He thinks he can out talk all the problems, this guy never shuts up and listens."
"UnderArmour provides a totally different inventory at discount retailers as opposed to #$%$?s, etc. The ?not protecting their brand? argument is stupid. Nike, Reebok, and Adidas do the same #$%$..."
imho this will do great imho
John is just talking to himself at this point.
Steven Curry's actions on the court seem to reflect the values and actions of this company. Pitiful just pitiful!!
"Reality always sets in, they reported a huge loss, estimates are estimates"
This should be trading north of 50 Let’s go
looking at next HMNY?
Not sure if it can pop above 18.5 but any 18(s) is fine.
More Downgrades! Ouch!
I wish they could force him to sell his mansion
Not to mention cooking the books alegations
Jim Cramer: I Do Want to Own Under Armour's Stock
History will not be the same.....Stephen Curry will take NBA Championship 2017. UAA is set for the rest of the year. or perhaps next 10 years.
New high for a long time!!!!
Antarug000 be patient stock friend I'm in at 19 not worrying at all.. I still think Amazon going to buy this company
Done. Will go bankrupt.
"Now that Plank is out, when the economy recovers, look out Nike..."
"Any thoughts fellow shareholders on our guy ""Spaceman Plank"" after our 22% drop in share price???????"
Holding 10k shares at $8. Let’s go UA!!!
Sure doesn't look very promising.Downgrade Macquarie: Neutral to Underperform 1/16/2018Downgrade Susquehanna: Neutral to Negative 1/9/2018
Hate of NIKE wont make this stock a better option. I love people who make emotional decisions over intellectual ones. Just Do It Nike. NIKE UP Up and Away
Today dumped all my 401K holdings ...
no brainer SKLN. read tucson med ctr article
I’m in Paris right now and the truth is retail is booming here not dead like America. Seriously people are out buying buying buying. And UA is growing here seeing a lot more people wearing it this year then last winter.
gdhsgshshsbsbz Just sooooooo mad from 50 dollars to 20 When I invested I thought I would make my money back GUESS NOT I LOST SOO MUCH MONEY
RetiredR John is shorting the stock this why he post all the bad or negative opions
"need this to break, to initiate long position."
How long before Plank sells this company?
UA headed to $10So overpriced!
"like I said last month..all you Mo Mo's are looking at PE's and multiple's and earning all when everyone going to get it ...it's all about emotion..if they say "" Hey the Outlook looks grood ....even tho it's BS "" the stock goes up ! if they give conservative statement..the stock goes down ..UA not going anywhere either way...I bought I'm at 19 not even worried in the least ..I hope the goes down b/c hostile take over will come ...if plank thinks he can turn it around then will have to hang on to stock longer"
UA reached a 52 Week low at 12.05
I guess the good news was priced in. I can wait but Wall Street hates to see this company thrive
http://www.businessinsider.com/steph-curry-exposes-under-armour-flaw-2017-10

"Steph Curry wins the NBA Finals, Spieth wins two majors, Aaron Judge is the clear favorite for ROY. These are players who are elevating the brand. With its MLB deal coming into effect in a couple years, UA WILL go up!"
I keep this stock only as reminder of my mistake in buying it a few years ago.
But it’s the truth.........
WAYYYYYYY too expensive Short at 20.40 GL
UAA is down 6.28% to 13.74
UA is an easy double by the end of the year
"UA has an image problem and that problem is being corny. Let's look at two advertising campaigns that they flouted without shame which were/are cringe-inducing and embarrassing. Protect This HouseOkay, whose house? My house or Uncle Jesse's? What message is UA trying to convey with ""Protect this House?"" I'd protect Uncle Jesse's house but he's already got a shotgun and he's often drunk. In any case, this slogan is corny and confusing. The Only Way Is Through Another embarrassing slogan. The average consumer of UA products isn't going through anything unless it's the doors of a McDonald's restaurant. UA lacks the critical ability to identify its core consumer because they're not athletes. They're average Joes and Janes who just want something cool to wear. Unfortunately, UA as a brand is not cool when their branding is this corny. UA's sneakers are also corny. Listen to the kids on the street. No one buys UA sneakers for this reason. Why buy UA when Nike and Adidas are what's cool with aesthetic designs that don't look like they were designed by Romper Room kids?"
Bank of America Lowered Under Armour Price Target From $21 To $12 In Conjunction With Downgrade From Neutral To Underperform On North America Weakness - we should ask him why
Plank was cooking the books. Absolute solid quarter and that dimwit ruined it...
Starting to think our only hope is for someone to buy us out.
"Do know if anyone else has noticed, but I see UA apparel much more in the gym at the work place. It is obvious that sales ave to be up this quarter. Question is, did ASP go down to sell the merchandise?"
Time to nibble.
UA is up 6.86% to 9.35
just added 10000 shares.. Easy money making
look out below. Not good.
PE 98-No Thanks.
"Revenue up, international sales up, North America sale up, the stock should be upgraded"
loving ua not the stock but the fact that I can clothe my family for nothing with its discounted product line.
"Stock will trade back down to $20, take your money while you can."
forward pe of 117 right now and they are expecting revenue to decline 50%!!!!
"Estimates are just Guesstimates, have nothing to do revenues or company value!!"
lots of Class Action Lawsuit against Under Armour. Stay away for now.
Time to take my profits and wait on 16 to buy back in.
As long as Curry is running up and down the court in the NBA finals UA will continue to climb.
ua is going to have a killer Q4
Look out below!
Hope UA sells scuba gear...Cauz its going under today
Sam Poser gave a $11 target ... amazing
manipulation expected
$19 in February.....
Thanks NKE! 
"Under Armour doing what it does best, following instead of innovating. I'm done"
with the price action today I am cautiously optimistic about tomorrow's earnings. going up when the market is going down leading into your earnings report feels like good news. a beat? a beat w/ a revision of future earnings upward? i'll take it. #fingerscrossed
An activist investor needs to come in here. There is absolutely no reason or excuse for a company with the best technology in the industry to be losing money at this stage of the life cycle.
UA is still languishing in the teen's. I remember back in 2015/2016 I was trading UA stock options in the low 40s. This company is too inconsistent to seriously consider adding to an investment portfolio.
"This brand is a train wreck. Massive attrition of employees and leadership (both forced out and quietly leaving), zero product innovation and constant failure to ignite North America under the current MD. Frisk is not a brand guy, so looking at next Reebok.Too bad as they had a shot to be great; now just another athletic brand that has no energy nor real growth in next 18-24 months."
drip drip drip splash splash splash gush gush gush=money being sucked out of this stock
Misty Copeland...what revenue stream does she create? Cut her loose!
"The Dow might get back in the 23,000 mark by the end of next week. This might be a worse month than October."
Closes around $17
I think $35-$40 year end back in 60s next year
just a matter of time before ua/uaa turns around.. been to 3 ua outlet in nj and all of them have 50% off the entire store.. yes margin will shrink but offset by sales. many retail stocks took a beating last qrt and now only the top name brands (that aren t located in malls and depending of mall traffic) just a matter of time with ua.. i have slowly started to buy uaa .. glta
"Hey Mike, Heres an article for you!"
"Under Armour is closing all of their stores? No difference, they’re all empty anyways. Disclosure: I’m long 2,000 shares unfortunately."
Worse Case scenario: if the investigation will find the company is at fault. Who will take the fall?1: CEO/former will be locked in jail2: Reinstatement of Earnings3: CPA firms that did could face penalties if they did in collaboration with management 4: Stock will fall another 20%. Probably to $12-$13 level It is high risk investments. But payoffs could be huge for long. These are scenarios that in my head now.
Stock price should be at 30$
"Love the risk/reward here. #$%$ and Nike both delivering blowout quarters bodes well. With a market cap at 4.6B vs. NKE at 200B you have to think this is getting attractive from an M&A perspective. Obviously there is a management issue but they still have the best products and no one is buying ""work"" clothes anymore. I recently purchased some items off their website and their new $80 T shirts (!!) are sold out. Loaded up on some call options for the quarter."
This is looking good we are building support at 22$.
"Gonna go to 12 like i said before, end of the year up"
CFO is not up to the task of public co. Wholly unprepared for conf call. Still working on long term model and 'assessing' future profitability? hopefully lone pine has the wherewithal to replace this turkey asap. no reason to own uaa for 12-18 months absent some activism.
What is this down pre market
I would like to thank Mr Plank and star endorsers like Steph Curry who made my put position I closed this morning the most profitable trade of the year so far. Seldom have I been able to count on leadership to consistently work against the stock price the way these two have . . .
Let’s go!!! $18-20
Under Armour's Tom Brady tonight?$gme $amc $bb $doge
"I lost over $500,000 a year ago when it went from the 40s to 20s and the drop has not stopped since. I bet it will go even lower to single digit."
HOVRs - why don't they make more? I tried many times and couldn't get one !
funny when hits almost 15 bucks we get so excited lmao
"Feb 08, 2021Tom Brady is one of the leading spokespeople for Under Armour, and he's not in the business of giving free PR to the brand's competitors.Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat out Patrick Mahomes' Kansas City Chiefs to win Super Bowl LV Sunday night. As the 43-year-old quarterback hoisted the Vince Lombardi Trophy for the seventh time in his esteemed career, he caught a glimpse of himself on the stadium's video board.Tom Brady is an Under Armour ambassador, and he's fiercely loyal to the sports apparel brand.After he won Super Bowl LV, the Buccaneers QB acted shrewdly to snub one of Under Armour's competitors.Brady noticed a Nike swoosh visible on his undershirt, so he pulled up his championship T-shirt to cover it up."
Does UA have the MLB deal or not? I read that Nike has it.
"Just getting ready for the Big pullback, elevator going DOWN"
Seems cheap to me.
"So, on the day the DOW hits 21,000, Under Armor (stock symbol POS), is actually negative and in the red.Simply fricking unbelievable.Kevin Plan is simply the WORST CEO EVER of any American Company.Kevin - if you committed suicide TODAY, the stock price would jump 20%.....easy.Kevin - please consider taking care of your shareholders and doing the right thing."
Shorted the junk today ...
cut losses now!!
Stifel just Upgraded to Buy from Hold. Target moves to $17. Expect this to be the first of many. And institutional investors love to see re-rating opportunities like this. Each upgrade is a catalyst for the upside.
"When you look at Under Armour and Foot Locker they have high domestic exposure, Malls are dead,Kohl's is empty and more Sports Outlets are filing for Bankruptcy,just can't compete with likes of Amazon and other online retailers,more and more looking like the JCP and Sears story here which were both much bigger than UA!"
I really expected this stock to surge this morning
What is the cost basis of the share of stock that was given as a result of a lawsuit? It surely can't be zero since it would be reducing the value of the company. I can't seem to figure it out. It won't amount to much.
Why is UA up when GDP is down. And unemployment up
"Keep going down, bought some this morning...ready to buy more."
Im in
UA is up 6.72% to 8.89
ouch
"After reading about their attempt to get out of the Cal praetorship, it's pretty clear on two fronts: to make that type of argument shows how little money they have on hand cause it is a massive reach in particular in the state of California, which probably explains how little marketing they do. Second, hire bad people, get bad results. Frisk and his team can't be this bad, but they keep proving it so."
Teens are abandoning Under Armour in droves — and it's turning into a huge crisis for the brand
UA is correcting big time. i am watching until it hits below 6.
Went skiing this weekend and just about every other kid was wearing an under armour sweater.
A 100 DOLLAR A SHARE 2 YEARS AGO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!??????????????????NOW 11 BUCKS???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????/////
"This stock was $ 100 in 2015... Now is $ 15. It is very cheap and with today's good earning, it can easy go up to $50."
Guidance will tell the story. I think they are still hurting from the downfall of Sports Authority and I don't expect top line numbers to come in where expected. I'm thinking a better entry position will occur after tomorrow's announcement.
Is UA going bankrupt?
Time for UA to get rid of spoiled brat Curry
Good point on Amazon buying UA never thought of that angle ... change tick from UA to UW ..Under Water

Gong to be an interesting day. Read this article https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/03/under-armour-is-the-subject-of-a-federal-accounting-probe-wsj-reports.htmlThe feds are looking into UA accounting practice. Nicely timed for Monday morning.

"UAA), currently trading for $8.85, to continue having problems.Stay away from this stock and consider buying Nike Inc. (NYSE: NKE) instead."
"Holy goodness, someone at Motley Fool HATES Under Armour!! Either that or there are a lot of worried shorters of the stock out there who thought UA was going to bottom @ $15 and instead are losing a TON of $$$ because it's looking more likely to end up @ $25 as the months go on. Poetic justice for those who thought it was the longs who were ""holding the bag!"""

"BAT Tax! If Plank is ready to embrace Trump, it’s not clear if his company is ready to fully embrace American manufacturing. Under Armour’s latest annual report shows that its products are mostly made elsewhere – primarily China, Jordan, Vietnam and Indonesia,that doesn't bode well for the new 20% Border Tax Trump just passed!"

"all retailers are in a downtrend (or in a best case scenario they are trading near the bottom), so earnings does not matter. Speaking seriously UA is a bit overvalued in 30-35 price range vs. average retailer. UA was priced for faster growth (not just for growth itelf but for a FASTER growth). It is a typical the WS game that difficult to comply for an ordinary joe. I consider buying UA in low $20s."
I bought UA @19.65. did i buy the wrong stock? what is this?
Will the price shoot up Monday considering under armour makes the astronaut uniform for virgin galactic? Virgin Galactic had a successful test flight into space today.

Now you must pay out of your own pocket for champagne room. Beeeee. jays!! Lol
UA shoes are amongst the ugliest hideous shoes on the market. I would never drop over $100 for them. Can these guys really not afford some good shoe designers to make their shoes? Shees Adidas is eating their lunch right now in the shoe game
maybe someone finally said something good about the company
Macys will die gradually too
Dumped all here ...
"Just to tell some of you how much people like UA stuff. I sold a grandchild's polo type UA shirt on Ebay for $23. That is just about how much it cost new. I will be looking soon for some athletic shoes at Academy Sports. as mine are starting to look a little rusty. I love UA stuff. When I fell a few years ago and broke a rib and punctured a lung and the hospital asked if they should cut off my shirt or if I could pull it off, I told them I would get it off since I had ordered a jacket to match and hadn't received it yet. I am a devoted UA lover of UA stylish stuff and I always get compliments. Go Kevin Plank. This stock will rebound."
"I’m not in UA as of a couple of years ago. I do think it’ll come back. The bald guy on CNBC is regularly wrong. Five years ago: “I like UA because it’s a tech company, not a clothing company.” Today, he says it’s not a good investment. I just heard him say he likes Tesla because it’s, “not a car company, it’s a tech company.” Five years ago he hated Tesla. Don’t listen to that but. Learn to do technical analysis, pair it with fundamentals, and you’ll do fine."
UAA is down 4.92% to 22.33
John your obviously a short troll that got burned today. Just cover and move on to something else.
I think the CEO really didn’t help himself in interviews about future guidance.
Curry 5 releasing today!!! Great. Looking shoe. Curry sold out 4 different color ways in just this quarter alone!!
$7 down within one week ... really too much
"UAA reminds me of TVTY, I missed both cheap. just watching them cheap.In one Month UAA would be at $18? LMAO!"
Intriguing earnings announcement time. It's before the bell. If poor performance was to be posted it would normally come after the bell. Nice.
Adidis is planning to buy UA for $15 billion! This is is bout to POP!!
"Gimme short, oh dodo gimme shortOh dodo gimmi short Untilk the morning sight"
oh I meant Jim Cramer
UAA is up 5.49% to 19.59
So much for analysts trying to trash UAA the past 2 days. their motives are well known
is UA earning on 26 or 30 of July ??? getting conflicting post ??
"Did this stock get pumped up, was this a pump and dump scheme, I was trying to buy at $21 and it passed me up so I let it go. Now I don't have enough confidence to buy, guess it should wait until it gets to $21"
What do you think Sam Poser is doing?
Great job Kevin Plank for destroying so much shareholder wealth while still making billions. This guy needs to be fired.
Looking good for higher prices. Short term target at stoxline: 16.75
Might there be some consolidation for this industry in the near future? How about UAA + Reebok or ?
"We just got ""planked""."
"UAA is good at producing overnight bag holders. In fact, even long term holders who held it for nearly 7 years did not have any gains while the market index has more than doubled during the same time. When a company crashes 20% overnight, it means it has serious issues, and not merely a correction. $UAA $UA is likely to go lower. So glad I didn't buy this when a certain investment service was telling me to buy at near all time high in 2017."

They had some interesting insights about UAA on (http://Thetraderguide.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"$3.5B by EOY. Giving up on contracts, layoffs by end of July/early Aug. Big thing to look out for...back to school campaigns normally hit around July 4th. Realize this is not your normal year, but much of the ordering and production of product is done 6-12 months before it shows up at retail. The BTS time frame is huge for sporting goods/lifestyle brands; if no or little campaign from UAA over next 3 weeks, much bigger issues ahead."
"Kevin Plank - if you are reading messages from your sucker investors, let me say that ""YOU SUCK THE BIG ONE!!!!""You single handedly destroyed over $10 billion of shareholder wealth with your stupidity and failed leadership. Under Armor market cap is now just over $4 Billion.And for all of you out there who were debating either to buy NIKE or UA as an investment, well, if you are reading this message, you picked the wrong horse. NIKE is jumping and breaking out. If you have money from UA that is at a profit (highly doubt it), I would switch it out to NIKE. NIKE now has almost $100 Billion market cap. They could buy UA 25x over. They could and are squashing UA like the cockroach they are. Kevin Plank is the King #$%$ Roach."
"Sell AH, it will crash to $8 at open"
they got great signing. the kid is gobba be an awsome player for dallas years to come
how many times have I told this board ITS NOT ABOUT EARNINGS ....LOSS OR PROFIT !!!! ITS ABOUT PSYCH AND EMOTIONAL Purchases ... great earning report and stock goes down...there is your proof

"Loving the price action in UA. Now that Plank has a handle on supply chain and inventories the future looks better than ever. Solid brand name that will only get stronger. Steph Curry, The Rick, Jordan Speith. Big names in major categories. Wait until a lebron or tiger switch over."
I’m always looking for gifts!Thank you panic sellers and emotional shorts!! Shorts are notoriously not doing their homework! They love to short on the first sign of what they think is really bad news - because sometimes it works... NOT THIS TIME!!
"They are looking at a 50-60 Million dollar hit 1st Quarter and that won’t be the end of it. I couldn’t stand it any more. The chart looks like a death spiral. I dumped shares. I may buy them back, but I think it’s headed a lot lower, probably to 5$ based on what you can justify for earnings."
"Ill be honest, I'm long but everyone always fighting about how UA is everywhere which it is and that they are doing so well etc... But all these shorts are right.. 7 days in the red..... I'm out as soon as the earnings are announced."
"Maybe we're going to have politically ""blue,"" or USA-bashing, companies and ""red,"" or non-political, or pro-USA, companies. So Nike, which applauds protesting the flag by honoring Kaepernick, can be a blue, pro-USA-bashing company. UA can be a red, or pro-USA, or non-political company. I'm fine with that."
The $11 - $13 share price was a very rare buying opportunity.
"You will soon realize. #Jonathon that you have awakened to that again. Your dream is turning into a nightmare. But then again like UAA, you become accustomed to losing money. I am praying for you bRo."
"Robert, US Companies first lower their revenue expectations by 70%, then if is only falls 60% it is said to be good and beat expectations . What?If you know that you will have a $1 Billion Loss, you can Lower the expectations to $1.5 Billion Loss, but Losing $1 Billion instead of $1.5 Billion, and ""beating"" your own useless, worthless and bogus expectations means nothing."
UA is down 15.98% to 15.25
sounds like you need one of my shirts lipsstik.com
"Praise little baby Jesus!!!Plank has been an anchor for UAA. I called for his resignation in 2016 after many of his missteps.This fantastic news is 3 years late, but better than never I suppose.Should be good momentum for UAA now that he's exactly where he should've been a long time ago."
UA is up 10.70% to 14.59
Very invigorating to see this pro-China junk store get kicked to the curb. Trying to sell Chinese junk to my kids for years and years. Hope to see you pro-Chinese losers at zero.
Why is Under Armour trading under two different ticker symbols? $UA and UAA. Which ticker should I buy into?
Under Armour is down 4.95% to 15.09
this is NOT a race Look at Buffet. Relax.
please see my posts from yesterday- i hope everyone bought a few shares. if not u can still get in here. buy low sell high.
"Insider selling to be investigated:Plank last sold Under Armour shares amounting to 1.05 million in a series of transactions from Apr. 21 to Apr. 29 last year. The sales were well-timed. Jut six months later, Under Armour's red-hot growth came to a screeching halt in the third quarter amid a fresh wave of department store closures and the bankruptcy of The Sports Authority. In effect, those harsh new realities removed vital places for Under Armour to hawk compression shirts and joggers and led to a groundswell of discounted inventory at off-price channels such as TJX Companies (TJX) . Under Armour's lackluster third quarter along with a major long-term profit warning sent shares plunging by over 20% on Oct. 25."

OE manipulation by market makers
So hit $18.80ish now its time to dive to $17! :)
Lol. Like anyone is going to take advice from the guy who is shorting AMD. Move along Putin.
"If I know Under Armour - and I feel like I know it pretty well - UA stock price will be around $19 by the end of the week. I hope I'm wrong, but every time the price momentum starts to look positive, it immediately drops back down. I'm long and will never sell...I'm young and believe in the company long term. Mr. Plank said Under Armour is in the execution stage of the company's business model - hopefully us shareholders will be rewarded. They sold out their 3D shoes at the beginning of this quarter. The design your own shoe is unique and will increase shoe sales. Also, I believe the move into Kohls is a good thing - as a previous poster mentioned, Adidas and Nike also sell at Kohls - This is a BUY before earnings. People from all walks of life wear Under Armour - from kids to grandparents - just look around you."
I say 12 by June
70% share value gone! With no dividend and no bail out package! Just Dismal!
NSIP Nice try dude !! all bad talk isn't going to work...you shorted for summer calls now your going to loose your #$%$
Finally get a CEO focused on turning this around…$30 soon
"good day, what is the difference between ua and uaa? thanks"
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-34zQJbG-VQAnyone knows about when the first quarter results will be released?
I doubt about the clothing sale ... shoes are ok.
If lulu is at more than $300 UA should be at least $100 fallowing the same logic.
"Blood bath. Frisk is at a minimum 2.5 years into his 5 year plan...and this is what we get?? Make no mistake, Frisk has been running the show well before he was named CEO. Putting an operations guy in charge of a supposed premium brand gets investors this result. The whole Board should be swept out, along w Frisk, Bergman and the rest of the inept leadership."
In the early years Nike stock also endured huge drops like this due to mis-steps. UA will eventually regain their footing. I'm holding on for at least 5 years.
i will never understand why analysts kill UA for getting into Kohls but dont seem to notice that nike ans adidis have always been in Kohls
Should be able to buy this around $6.00 soon !
I can't imagine UAA publishing anymore bad news in 2019...I think this will rise if Kevin Plank will stay out of the spotlight or just resign..
sold some shares today for tax deduction. happy new years to you too Kevin Plank
Plank accumulates nearly all of the UAA stock and issues its first ever dividend.. except the board owns nearly all the float via this amazing amount of noise. Trades above $60 in 15-18 monhs. You heard it here first. Remember this post.
lol this is the only stock out of the 40 in my portfolio that is red. UA is pure garbage.
Could see 16.1x as lows... wow
Meril Lynch upgraded UA to buy with target set at $54
Expect slow slide back into $17.'s and lower especially if this Market corrects!
17.25+ close and shorts will be covering soon.Next leg up should get us close to 19.5-20 if not more - IMO
"Durant won the MVP. But, it was clear that Curry was the Golden State Fans MVP with the chant ""M V P "" when curry was gonna be asked a question on podium. Lets see if this championship helps UA."
Solid base
Bryce Harper’s Baseball contract next season!
"When the dust settles, think about being able to say you bought Under Armour stock under $10.Stores are opening, UA is a great product, I am excited for us.52 Week Range 6.37 - 24.55"
#UA must buy for me. This is coming back soon in my opinion.
The junk Macys is alive!
Pump then Dump
"At a P/E of 38 and declining sales at the moment, there is no quick turn around here. It simply is not offering ""value"" at this valuation given the fundamentals at this time. If it trades at a P/E of 19 (still a little rich), the stock would be $6.00. UA could make tremendous fundamental improvements, but the stock may still languish awhile. The price of the stock is simply way ahead of the fundamental story at this time."
Thud ... Splat .... Boink .... Thud ...... The sound of more bodies jumping out the windows at Tide Point.UA has lots of problems starting with KP .... Sell Now .... Don't be a Bag Holder !!!!
Best clothing line will go higher owned this from start of year will send at the end in mid 20s
Today's teens are tomorrow's adults. That does not bode well for the long term viability of the brand. Look out below!
I heard UA is going to merge too days ago
Time to buy
"Under Armour splits it's shares, ""A"" and ""C"". okokok, the new cheaper shares designated ""UA"", the original company stock symbol... What type of company would do that to their long time shareholders? Get ready for class action lawsuits, maybe an SEC investigation."
"I would love to see a new commercial from UA that involves our great men and women in the armed forces and law enforcement, emergency responders, fireman......etcwearing UA gear. They should represent all wars going back to WWII. I would not bash Nike per say but I would send the message that UA stands for this country and all who defend its honor. An American flag blowing in the wind in the background would be a nice touch. If they do not react to this huge opportunity, the management will have certainly failed the shareholders and more importantly, all proud Americans."
"Options have not direct effect on stock prices, talk to broker already"
Next earnings will drive this up like crazy
Hey John back on here ..lmao ..he is at it again
Net Income Avi to Common (ttm) -159.47MDiluted EPS (ttm) -0.36
Did Plank compare himself to Tom Brady?
What happened?
opened high will it go higher or lower that is the question of the day...
VERI and EKSO. Artificial intelligence and Bionic Robotics. New big corp contracts and climbing fast. You're welcome.
buy and hold for years. this brand isnt going anywhere.
"Rising with good volume. Stochastic oscillator and RSI are triggering bullish signal, according to stoxline. Would like to see a break above 15.19."
Amazon down this should be up
Down 1% yesterday and DOWN 2.4% ahead of opening today ....... People will start jumping out of windows in Locust Point any time now.
Looking to to push thru 18-19 today Goldman Price target 25
this traded for 100 share 2016 what happened?
"Dam John keep killing the stock ...I bet your sweating with short mentality of asking your self ..WHY did I short this stock ..every analyst around said it hit it's low at 10 bucks ...just let me say this .. remember when Citi Bank was 7 bucks a share about 5 years ago...ummmm wonder what it is NOW ...if don't the tick is ""C"" ...I mean C Mon everyone..you really think this company going BUST ...Really !!! ...this company will come back or it will be bought out..mark this post ...I personally think it will be bought by Amazon..but we will see"
why the 1.00 drop in the late morning?
It's all about high velocity manipulation as will be shortly demonstrated.
I'm in at 15.
Shorts always have an agenda which is to make it seem like everything is going the wrong way. The truth is Under Armour is generating massive amounts of revenue and as the fastest growing company in the history of the world starts to heal its growing pains look out because next year at this time we could be looking at a $50+ stock valuation.
Chart is calling for 19-20 range. new curry shoes coming too.
"The smart money knows whats going on here, it is looking ahead, not behind. Turnarounds take time, usually longer than expected or hoped for, but, the rewards can be great if you are early. It is very early but the bottom has been made and the tone is changing. Today's action only confirms that"
UAA or JWN or M ??
"""GRAND STANDING"" CEOS ARE BITTER THAT TRUMP IS BRINGING BACK JOBS FOR AMERICAN WORKERS AND MAKING THEM PAY REAL WAGES INSTEAD OF using SLAVE LABOR from THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES!!"

Look for $12 Per Shr!
"COVID is going to double with the cold weather they say, and I could see stocks going back to March prices......?? No matter what they do"
I'm waiting for this to take off soon.
Time to leave when the Captain of the ship sells his shares....
I put in a Stop at $2.85. Hoping we don't get there before YE.
"UA ought to target the store brand. It obviously can't compete with Nike or Adidas. No amount of showboating will change that. But not many people would buy Unipro or w/e over UA if UA was similarly priced. And let's face it, UA gets as much respect as the store brand."
Looks like most of the weak hands have been washed out. Rather than bashing UA and Plank just get out of the way if you don't like the company and don't want to own the stock. There are clearly plenty of investors both individual and institutional that will gladly buy your stock and benefit as the bottom is put in and we start moving back up. Should be a very happy Christmas for longs that bought in at these low levels.
I shorted at 15.25. It will go under 14 in the next two weeks. your welcome.
"Sorry guys, but i don't really see people around me wearing under armour. Bearish on this one"
"I am officially DONE with any of this company's products. I will NEVER be a consumer in anything produced by this co.Also, the share price will 'probably' plummet further. CEO's should stay out of the political arena and keep their views to themselves. Disc: Never any position in this LOSER and never will."
down?
UAA is down 10.37% to 8.26
"It’s minor,Still not good,Monday will suck, 5-6% Red.After that it should be ok."
"Question for you Under Armour experts. What is the difference between ticker UA and UAA? If I wanted to buy stock in this company, should I buy UA or UAA? thanks."

Profit taking after the Dead Cat Bounce ..... Back to $18 by Friday .... Sorry !
"Shorts Read....Time to switch sides or more pain will continue. You have a 27% short float and GS is winning the Finals. Curry shoes will be selling like hotcakes. The custom shoe will sell like hotcakes. Plus new revenue from DSW, Kohls, Famous Footwear, etc is going to start moving. Watch out!"
Strong now
"I may never get back to even on this one, average price is $25"
glad I sold UA at $102.50 a couple years back....I thought it was over bought
Time to buy back to 23 againIf the market is green
I agree $30 in July
UA needs to get rid of the current CEO .. CXOs ... just the brand worths more
Steph may be a moon landing denier...still he's smarter than LeBron by a long shot!
Because teens are very stable consistent and wealthy consumers....
"I sold it before it tanked, looking to get back in, i missed the $15 level recently. I don't really understand why their stuff is so expensive, much more than peers and it doesn't seem to be discounted that much, maybe that's part of the problem, I think they would sell a lot more if products were 10-20% cheaper at full price without changing quality or performance"
This stock is doomed. Kevin Plank will be appearing on Cramer tomorrow night. LOL
massive sell off in the days ahead. cut your losses. this company is losing money & is going under. I see unlimited loss potential. major losses will be eminent.
Wish I had not invested in this. UA is not responding and Adidas is capturing...UGH!
"John, every time you say something the stock goes up, thanks man."
"michaelRlulz guy is like John, put him on ignore"
Kevin Planck is such a mess ...
How are they down 9% in the pre market when they beat earnings?
"I am happy for all of you that have made money off UA, but the reason why I have stayed away is because they just haven’t made products that I like. I feel they should be so much further down the line with footwear. My question is are they growing in the US? I know they’re are growing internationally."
Just got my first pair of us sneeks great quality excellent product like better than Nike
Hello guys I need help. I want to buy a under Armour stocks what is the legit symbol? UA or UAA? I'm new in stocks TIA
YIKES.
buyout coming?
The Wall Street Journal caught wind of the Accounting probe and forced Management to fess up today. That says a lot about management.
"more and more people trend to buy Nike shoes, UAA sales will continue decline, Nike shoes are better than anyone, Nike shoes looks stronger than anyone, others looks too weak,UAA will down to $7 per share, Nike clothes very good too, but too expensive, if Nike clothes discount, others nobody buy."
"Was at the mall yesterday searching all the shoe stores. Obvious winners are still Nike and Adidas. Their shoes are just ... Nicer. They are on the forefront of innovating and keeping up to date on style and trends. It seems UA is simply playing follow the leader or catch up with these 2. Sure enough, most people in the mall were wearing Nike and adidas anyway. It's just a more well-received product and look. Good luck to you UA holders, I just don't see UA becoming as widespread popular as these 2 guys. The sexy sleek swoosh suits men and women nicely and the adidas classic 3-striped shoes is catching fire with young women these days. Of course this is just a trend, but trends start with trendsetters. And Nike / Adidas will be setting these trends for as long as I can see. Disclaimer: I own Nike. I do not own Adidas."
This chat is dead
Cramer says UA is fine. Now I'm worried.
"UA's debt ($1.25 billion) and the pending debt recession ($21+ trillion, national students debt of $1.3 trillion. and today's budget spending plan of $1.3 trillion) will contribute to sucking the life out of this company. You have been warned. This will make the housing debt crisis in 2008 look like a cake walk."
UA has no cash and only depts. Will sink to $4
"im back in, got to love days like this"
"For sure, I will buy UA at $8.00."
So last night in AH some more retail names got smoked on earnings but mostly guidance. The list keeps on growing and giving. Here we are going tint holiday and they can not get traction. Most sad is the number of buyer of UA who think UA is different. It has price target increases but moves away from those targets. Buying volume is light met by heavier selling volume. Instituions do not look to be involved in buying.
Shorts are going to pile in the next few days.....they have to or lose there Butts
"There is not much value in this stock. the sneaker business is highly competitive, and growing is slowing down.The p/e is too high. it is highly unlikely the stock will go to $30 in near future."
scary stock
UA should stop paying millions and millions to all the whining crybaby professional athletes then maybe they'd make some money.
Will Under Armour go bankrupt this year as a result of hating Americans?
What is the relationship of UAA and UA? Why they are not falling the same amount?
"I've been a big Plank fan, but my god!!!! He has now #$%$ off Republicans and Democrats which is tough to do. This is going to hurt sales. Dissing the president isn't a smart move."
I was planning on buying into UA but thought earnings would lower the stock. Scared money don't make money lol Congrats to those who bought in pre-earnings.
Good price to buyMaybe this back to 23 next week Good luck for all of you
New CEO Trying to keep it above $19. buttttttt shorts are too strong!
What is the difference between UA and UAA? I would like this stock.
SHORTS covered but do not short either. Still some concern about North America revenues but International is very hot
Tomorrow going to buy a #$%$ load and hopefully bring down my average price.. then going to hold till I can pull a profit and get out
UAA is up 4.95% to $18.87
Earnings coming October 24th.. will be GOOD NEWS
I?m shorting this #$%$ at 8!
The ballers must pay out of their own pocket now on! Lol
"On top of everything else (SEC investigation and weak guidance), shoe sales dropped 12% last quarter. This is down from growth previously. Well, now we know why the CEO change."
green af
You now have my families business - NKE will never get another dollar from my family - 4 kids all in sport.
Getting ready to slingshot upwards. Resistance seems to be around $42 right now. Maybe a little less. Above $50 after earnings?
Hang In three UA ! Close Above $13.
"Nationwide Boycott against UA thanks to Kev's comments about Trump,nations split 50/50 and he call Trump ""Passionate"" Ooops! How many Pro Sports teams and Pro Athletes will now rethink who their supplier will be,how many Pro Athletes are from other countries that don't endorse Trumps immigration policy,don't forget what Colin Kapernick started by kneeling during the Natinal Anthem,UA better hope this Boycott doesn't catch steam,Wow!"
"PS to Jeff...you observed only a month ago that fully 50% of kids in the gym were wearing UA. Focus on that and don't let today's considerably oversold blip steer you off course. Yes, it may be a year or more before we see it back above $30. But this ridiculous drop just created a superb buying opportunity if you can still get shares for under $20 and be satisfied with a quick short-term gain of 10-20%."
UAA is up 8.79% to 11.88
Ua nfl kiss my ace
Under Armor needs a superhero movie to energize sales. But how does one make a superhero out of underwear?
c Mon everyone.. I mean y'all really think this stock is going to crash along with the company.. Geeze ..yea this company will be under the market spot light ..but remember when Netflix was 120 and they had bad earning.. everyone said sell sell sell they can't sustain more growth ..ummmm now look at the price..if your a chicken little the market for you every time you hear the sky is falling but if your strong will and believe in a CEO like Kevin Plank then UA is for you
"Sorry, the only people that wear under armour are School teachers and gay people. ...."
over the years - WS mafia used all kinds of dirty tricks ... including ANALysts
I’m not an analysis but I do visit stores and talk to associates as well as view the product. In my view Nike has a better appeal to the younger generations and women. The colors are better and the clothes look cooler to wear. The marketing of UA is terrible it’s not attractive to women and the younger generation and its branding is tired. I also don’t like it took the IR department over a month to respond to some basic questions. Made a few grand here on trade here but the stock is not for me long term. I am much happier with my CROX investment.
Market is up big and UA is languishing. Ugh!
UA Stock down again today .... This Stock will see $15- $16 soon .... Tired Brand that doesn't fit or wear very well.
"So what, 100k turnover max for a 5bn company. I dont u derstand you guys oay attention to these capsules which are launched you amateurs"
Nike Nike Nike I told you Trumper Chumps. Listen to trumpy and you will be bankrupt like he was 6 times. Merry Christmas!!
May see 20% haircut today.
"Debt covenants dont apply anymore, Buy"
"Mike, how do you know UA only tested the market with 10 pairs of the HOVR?"
https://muckrack.com/dave-marino-nachison/articles
Funny thing to the short sellers. The Wells notice news was announced and the stock closed higher! Obviously a non-event. As this effects 2015 revenue shifting from quarter to quarter. No restatement required.
Dow at all time hight
"Donald J. Trump@realDonaldTrump - that moron talksRECORD HIGH NASDAQ! It would all come crashing down, including your Jobs, Stocks, and 401k’s, if Sleepy Joe ever became President. China and others would own us!!!"
target is $11 ... i don't see many ppl in their stores now.
"Another .35 to keep the bag holders from feeling too bad about drops,what's another .35 drop,then again tomorrow then no loss a couple of days then another .25 to .35,slow and steady drops!"
29 by EOM possible if market heads back to yearly high
"MACD is about to cross signal line, but not sure how to play this with earnings coming up next week?"
Not a problem. ..just theft of shares by algos
the only news i see - analyst stifel nicolas upgraded it from hold to buy.
My order is in at $3.66
UA reached an all time low at 9.20
PREPARE FOR BATTLE!
Morningstar rates under armor undervalued per their posting on yahoo finance
"Come on UA, ADVERTISE, MARKET with Stephen Curry, MESSI, Neymar, Runners, and change the logo to more Eye-Candy, Slick Logo, ie, Tesla super S#XY edgy sharp 'T'. Work on it, it's worth the time, Brand-Name, A real GOOD Logo is worth $$BILLIONS. You go to admit, Best S#xy Edgy sharp Logo 'T' from Tesla.. And the CEO Musk himself is a headline grabber, thats $$BILLIONS of worth ADVERTISING Marketing, Power, Push for achieving higher goals.."
"Today target is 22.50 or highest , IF market Green"
Will Fremar's departure push UA even lower?
would be interesting if they got bought out
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/80/FAO_logo.gif This move will be a game changer better get on the bus now.
"THIS STOCK IS DEAD,AND HAS BEEN FOR 3-4 YEARS. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO,IS LOOK AT INSIDER TRADING !!"

Why would amazon buy such a douchebrand what doesnt make money
"IZEA is up 27% and climbing after hours! Artificial Intelligence, Media Influencers, Blockchain News. Load up folks!!!"
Kevin A. Plank needs to resign.
"We are at a key level of support here. Let’s hope we hold this (or higher) for a few days, and then the trend is our friend."
"IMO, this is not a stock to short. UA has contracts with NCAA schools and there is still tremendous uncertainty on what will happen this fall. If we end up having a season, even a shortened/altered one, UA will run. Retail sales are important to UA, but the million-dollar contracts and future contracts are key to UA's stock flying higher. IMO, this stock is a great buy under $9. I would buy slowly here and then by at any pullbacks under $9. At least that is my plan. Buy the red! We will see $15 by next year.This article is a month old, but highlights some of the deals: https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/ncaa/naval-academy-revisit-under-armour-contract-week#:~:text=Under%20Armour%20is%20under%20contract,in%20its%202019%20annual%20report."
15 coming
The beating will continue until morale improves.
"With Larose, MD of North America, now being replaced, Frisk adds to his cleaning house part of his 3 year growth/profitability plan. Leadership has been let go, in some form or fashion, in HR, Marketing, Creative, Product Design, MD of Europe, MD of Asia, let alone the 1000 laid off and countless others not replaced as they quietly moved on, in the last 18 months. It is actually quite shocking. Lots of savings for sure.With the next earnings report, Frisk is just 2 quarters away from completing his stated 3 year re-build; and not much growth to speak of. If no growth from Q1 (really growth, not shuffling numbers),at one point do investors hold Frisk, Plank, Haley (strategy), Eskridge (product), Mirchin (advisor), Fipps (IT) accountable?"
"UA has nothing to do with Bradys accomplishments.The brand has to sell itself, and evidently is not!!UA is naturally trying to boost the stock by saying, its charts are setup for a good earnings report.... LOLThen they get ppl to buy and drive it up, just so the insiders can sell and recoup a bunch of money they’ve lost."
What is the problem today?
NKE finally up. After 2 years of being stagnate.No more market manipulation. Stock will go up and up.While UA will continue to flop. Dump UA amd take the loss. Move on.
One word. Aeropostale
"So now after UAA ran up from $7 to $23 a share, the ""analysts"" raise their share price estimates and tell us ""buy""???"
"Lifting minimum wage just causes the price of merchandise to increase, so it is a no win situation. In fact, this ideology will be the major cause of inflation and cause the market to crash. This has changed my entire opinion of this company."
"People who will no longer buy Nike will buy something else. I want that something else to be UA. UA, please play up patriotism, even subtly. ""UA USA"" is a natural basis for logos and slogans."
which idiots badmouthed uaa again?
UA is going right back to almost 16 hope everyone loaded up with shares. Enjoy the money shower
"Junk! The sports equipment and apparel retailer UA had its credit downgraded, sending its sole bond issue into speculative or “Junk” territory.Standard & Poor’s cut its rating on the issuer to BB-plus from BBB-minus, the last level of investment grade. The outlook on the rating is negative, meaning S&P could lower it again in the medium term. Reinvest elsewhere or lose it all,AT&T still attractive but probably not for long as it's rising,Price Target $45. ~ $46.,Dividend soon to be a whopping .50 share! What did UA payout per share?"
18.80 by Wednesday!
Added to my position
Trust in JESUS for eternal life. John 3:16. Have a great day.
"Once negativity on a stock goes mainstream, it is actually top to back the truck up and load up. If you wait to long, you will miss the boat. So much growth potential overseas where Nike & Adidas are already saturated and matured."
this will be back to 20 by the end of September if not earlier
"I'll ""nibble"" when it hits $3.50 in about 1.5 years. This stock is broke, plain and simple."
"After a week of losses, short sellers have decided to take some profit by buying to cover their positions. Expect more downward pressure next week."
"Well why dont you buy for 200k, youd be a miljonair in 4 years mongoloid"
"Saw 70 year old fat guys wearing UA on the plane yesterday, the brand has lost it way."
"Here's my two cents for UA execs...before signing any more high priced athletes to contracts, make sure they have half a brain and actually support the brand."
Pricing power is the key. Does uaa have pricing power. I suspect they have some. Maybe this will recover
"Just look at the financials, this company is junk. Wall Street owns it and would love to dump it on you. Be very careful.https://about.underarmour.com/investor-relations/news-events-presentations/corporate-news/id/20851"
priced based on 2023 income projected but market saturation and current market value 9.99 fair price 7-8
"Darn, 2500 shares I will sell due to another inept turd choosing politics over business. Really liked their product too. Used to buy UA before Nike every time. Pretty bad when you need to purchase an overseas product because American business CEO's don't know how to keep their trap shut..."
"Does anyone here follow the 50/100/200 moving averages? If you had purchased UAA on 7/27 at $11.20 when the 50 day crossed the 100 day, you would be up 50% as of today (which just happens to be 11/20 lol)"
"UNDER ARMOUR CUT TO A ""SELL"" BY DEUTSCHE BANK. JUST DISGUSTING.......KEVIN PLANK - PLEASE RESIGN TODAY. THE STOCK WILL POP MINIMUM 20% IS YOU DRAG YOUR SORRY #$%$ OUT THE DOOR."
Nice upgrade....?????UA just went down twice to 13 in the last 2weeks...... lol
"Only way to raise cash for more investments is to issue more shares which is the next step UA will take since their bond rating is Junk and no one will loan them any money,so by issuing more shares they will once again screw over the shareholders as dilution will eat into the already dismal share price! GLTA"
Any theories on why JohnZ hates UA? The dude his wife left him for wore UA. The 'cool' kids who picked on him all wore UA. UA fired him from his sweet mailroom job at UA forcing him back to janitorial work at Taco Bell. Anyone know where this obsessive hatred comes from?
UA reached a new 52 Week High at $23.00

"United Airlines suck, lets sell under armor stock to punish them"
Why are you guys long on UA when NIKE is better?
"Based on news this morning from Raymond James, I would only think of this stock as neutral, imo. I see a brand in decline with little to no product innovation or stickiness with the younger buyers and taste makers. Strategic failures with NA, womens and footwear; which all have no traction right now, present a very real long-term challenge after significant investment in these key areas. And the continued resistance to ath-leasure product segments limits the potential new consumer base. Throw in the mass-exodus of employees, no significant marketing spend (both helping profitability) and poor C-suite leadership (Frisk and his VF clique) and neutral it is."
"And their market cap is 10 compared to Nike at 1000. Is it really 1% of Nike This should fly on TB 12, the rock, Steph curry, Embid. They got 2 of best basketball players along with the best in TB12. And don’t forget best of all. Probably the most likeable actor in the world. The rock."
Kevin plank you go on tv stock drops . You make a division the stock drops. Please shut your #$%$ mouth. Maybe share holders will shut it for you
This is YUGE!Imagine the marketing material when UAA starts making space suits!
test
I believe their is a buying frenzy taking place
The golf collection is really boring. No creativity in the design department.
someone going to buy the company
Not as bad as some other companies are doing. Only 23% business drop is alright from the looks of things.
........to be contiued
"UA has lost 57% of its value this year, second worst performing stock in the S&P 500. There is still more damage on the way since they lowered revenue forecast for the year. let that sink in for a minute before you invest any more hard earned money."
"With all this movement and COVID impact, I am still thinking it will settle around $11.00, but sort of baseless in my speculation. The big question is when? Retail will recover, but again when? Short term neutral, longer term bullish, today who knows."
What this stock needs is Andrew Left and Citron. That will put SP where it belongs!
Under Armour will gain from Nike stupidity
Uh-oh. Sometimes truth emulates life. Prepare for the high velocity traders.
Wall Street Traders playing game with UA. Trying to shake out retail holders so they can cover short positions ahead of earning later this month. Such a predictable trap. Susquehanna is notorious for this and makes its money trading up and down. If you are thinking of selling ask yourself - what has changed between yesterday and today? Other than Nike reporting positive data - which would only be helpful - nothing - nothing was disclosed that would make this a sell at this level.
UA is up 8.98% to 8.15
Didn’t know an SEC investigation was good for a company. More companies in portfolio should b investigated as well
"Wall Street........Under Armour Expects Wider Net Losses to come, from further Overhaul Costs."
I would expect $75 EOY 2018
"THE BOYCOTT IS ON! Trump voters are not shopping any longer for UA clothing/shoes. (except maybe, for the stuff they cannot sell and gets marked down 90% at TJ MAX) Otherwise, we buy Nike, New Balance or ADIDAS but, never anything from Kevin Plank. Plank through us under the bus. Plank will be spanked. UA - is in big trouble now. BIG TROUBLE!"
wonder who is buying at these levels. cool guys
day 3 of losing as the dow goes above 20k again
"INVESTIGATION ALERT: The Schall Law Firm Announces it is Investigating Claims Against Under Armour, Inc. and Encourages Investors with Losses in Excess of $100,000 to Contact the Firm"
"Jordan Spieth, AKA the walking UA billboard, is straight up ballin' at the Masters!"
The possibility of UA going under is high ... sale slowing and continues to lose money
Stock is still outrageously expensive
"If the Rock, Curry and Copeland disagree.. return all the endorsement money..... lemme see doubt it!"
8 bucks..what a joke....still say 30 bucks in 1 1/2 years
Any dodos still shorting
The expectations on the earnings report is so bad that even if they miss the stock may have only upside.Sit tight!
"this will be a nice addition to Amazon for real, or who knows maybe Apple too"
"Kohl's, that the end of this brand.."
"Nike didn’t come out with good earnings. UA closed all stores in March and let go/furloughed 8,000 staff. I don’t see them doing well. I don’t have a position but will buy under 7$"
UA is down 17.02% to 20.24
Nice job Plank of destroying shareholder value. What was he thinking about his move to performance wear? The whole world is moving to athleisure.
Let us all write to urge Plank to resign now ...!
"What is going on, once it got past 12.50...it's going down fast now."
Keeps falling like a rock. Abandon this sinking ship before it hits $5.
You will all say in the next 2 years I coulda bought that in the 15's
John sucks...No brains..Anyone who posts that much is an idiot...
"UAA is up because of Dewayn Johnson aka. The Rock , He’s the Oprah Winfrey of WTW. Sales will continue with his 100 mill followers"
Glad I sold UA a few years back at $102.50.......I thought it was walking a thin line
How many people on here think UA will meet analyst expectations for Q3 tomorrow?
entire stock market is down. chill
target is 20.60 today
"This is not a falling knife, it is a falling chainsaw going at full speed."
green!
"If only Kevin Plank would have focused on Apparel rather than political views the last couple of years, UA could have come close to surpassing Nike today."
John you are an idiot !
Large blocks getting bought. Looks like institutional buying today.
"This latest controversy makes for an interesting story but still a lot has to be proven,"
Looks like the run up is going to be very short lived. Was hoping for the opposite.
Bot here @15.77!
"too MUCH ego, gone today, maybe a company with too much cash MRNA will help make back my losses, UAA a terrible mistake, PLANK just talk, worse he loves hearing himself talk ,gone with a fair amount of shares today as smart shorts cover, and a good sized loss"
"on sky sports today ive seen anthony joshua draped in ua gear, spieth in ua gear, harry kane in ua gear, why are these shares going down."
"Hard to believe this recovery in Under Armour stock. Just 6 short months ago, we were in the low teens. Now at 52 week highs. Pretty amazing. Either the turn around is for real or hedge fund shorts are caught in the cross roads of the overall retail rally. To me it feels like UA brand is much stronger internationally than in the US. LULU reported terrific comps last week especially from overseas market, so that's my guess...."
UAA is up 4.94% to 23.06
great we have a new of North America sales that couldn't make it as a CEO and you look at what she did to the stock price of Duluth time to sell our shares
A lot of shorts hanging around. I know the standard message board wuss out though. Once the stock runs they will never come back to eat crow.
"I think they finally need to get Plank out. Put someone in there who knows how to run a business, isn't married to the way things used to be, and doesn't have political baggage."
Class Action coming soon!
"I am long on UA and think they can turn it around. However just looking at the sheer ugliness of their shoes, I dont think this stock will recover for a while. Lululemon has better-looking shoes than these guys. Everywhere on the internet UA shoes are the laughing stock of the athletic world. With memes and infographics making fun of them. Kevin Plank, if you are reading this stop ignoring your shareholders! We have been the worst treated investors in the S&P 500."
"good products, but management is incompetent. havent seen lot of branding and there was politics involved."
17.2-17.5 coming soon.
I think we will see 20 in 1 week.
Huge party at Under Armour tonight...
UA frustrates me to no end. They had a shot to get in that upper tier of global sports brands and have failed miserably. Continue to go the route of Reebok and move away from sports to training and running is a losing road. Whoever is in charge of their strategy needs to go. It didn't work for Reebok and it won't work for UA. brand.
Hope the CEO doesn't plan another investors conference for a LONG TIME.
UAA is down 4.92% to 21.26
That was a great interview by Kevin Plank!
have they changed the symbol for UA to UAA?
"OK, now that that little deadcat bounce to 12.15 is over with the real precipitous drop can resume. 11.63 close."
"Keep your softest best baggiest shorts with the pockets and your dri shirts, make the hoodies in a super thin zip up and keep trying on your shoes. You post the weight on your shoes but your outside soles are way too hard. Buyers wouls rather they be 90% softer even if they wear out 90% faster. Put 3 rating categories on outside bottom of shoe sole, min medium and max softness give, make half or most your shoes max soft, your sales will skyrocket. If you can't see even ugly shoes selling out on skechers website because the soft rubber bottom soul offers enough spring in your step you can throw the inside soul away when you ruin it or it smells but for the moment too busy to replace.If you know what I know you scoop this dip, triple drive thrus, smartphone ordering, digital picture menus, voice ordering almost here!SRPT therapeutics reports today after the bell.

It makes it seem like all the shoes suck when they do that, keep your clothes designers, fire most your shoe designers or at least who is doing your shoe budgeting and buying. You must differentiate yourself uniquely by offering the softest bottom souls you can buy, then ua goes to 60, 80, 100, till you do this a new ceo won't help."
"Ok, I am back after the successful LULU trade. Time to go long on UA, Target 20."
F.F back at it again. Maybe he should cover the healthcare industry as he's the picture of perfect health
UA has to recreate its brand .
told you yesterday to hold
Plank will announce BK soon. Fallout from getting kicked out of Trump's economic advisor panel. No stock has ever with stood this amount of loss and stayed in business.
"It's here ""BAT"" not the baseball term but the ""Border Adjustable Tax"" ,I can't make this stuff up! Retailers joining together to defeat the ""Border Adjustable Tax"" in other news , The comments received criticism across social media from those who don't support Trump. Some activists are vowing to boycott Baltimore-based Under Armour also opens the door to pro athletes and pro sports teams joining in the Boycott,don't forget what Colin Kapernick started with kneeling during the National Anthem,take todays profits and run for z door!"
I m waiting to buy more too ..
My guess is naive retail traders buying they silly upgrade calls from firms that never saw the downturn and only jumped on this after earn report and a bullish CEO narrative.Volume does not tell you funds are buying this news. So who is? Those on this board?Global YTD data is in the crapper. Consumer has little to no money. If you think there is an international or US desire to buy UA products to a level of a $30 target (a 3 year high in share price) you will more likely regret it to the smarter people who are selling you their shares. Anyone here tell me how UA is going to see the sales that propels the stock price to $30. I really want to hear your case.
Just read the IHS’s Markit Score report on UA!!
I bought UA stock last year when it was $103 a share since I believed in the company. Since then they announced all the bad news in one day the the price dropped dramatically. I had to sell it and lost tons of money. I blamed it all of Plank. Now I make all of money back from investing in a fiber optics company. I'd say get out of UA mess before it's too late.
The SEC failure is that they have never be able to forbid the manipulation behavior of the MMs - mafia
$12s and ill take a chance
Never hit 20 will it
Who has a prediction on bottom?
glad i got 17.9
sold my shares today with a tidy profit...buying more Canadian cannabis.
I heard under armor is going to be bought
Has all the makings of a sharp drop and then rebound or vice verse. Be ready to trade Mon AM!
everyone don't panic just quick money up siders a buck or two selling thier stock and moving on to another stock ..let them sell this is healthy pull back
run don't walk
UA better then Nike soon to double again by 2019
"Now its a buying opportunity. 10% tariff, who cares. On sneakers. Who cares. Prices havent risen on anything with tariffs, the Chinese are eating it. They have to, they cant afford lower sales. Sneakers small part of this business anyway. Picking up a few shares here."
"While everyone is talking about the NBA, half the kids getting drafted in the MLB this week are rocking UA hats. Also, US Open starts tomorrow. One of the favorites is Jordan Speith (the walking UA catalog) and it is in Wisconsin where Under Armour is huge so lots of UA logos on TV this weekend.."
I'm buying @9 if it gets there. In 10 years you will cry that you didn't load up when it was so dirty cheap.
Don't buy stocks unless you can afford big losses like what we have here. The individual investor should stick to mutual funds.
The Crock took us down under the water deep but then had to come up and soo we go day by day waiting for a Home run
up from here
why is Motley Fool constantly bashing UA stock for months. Are they trying to keep the value down for a reason. Everyone else is positive on the stock doing well. except for the Fools at Motley
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-under-armour-inc-stock-115710801.html

"LMAO at the shorts here now. It's basically over kids. Time for the big boys to step in. Sports Authority BK was the start but Amazon's sales show why it's got to end. This isn't a UA story anymore. It's a retail story. UA could also become a $35 take out candidate. Be very careful at this price, you're playing with fire."
Sell in May and go away.
"UA is a"" go it alone stock"""

"CFRA MAINTAINS SELL OPINION ON SHARES OF UNDER ARMOUR, INC.8:03 am ET November 6, 2018 (CFRA) PrintExecutives at Under Armour have for years taken athletes and employees to strip clubs, the WSJ alleged in a November 5 report. The Journal also cited sources that these trips were among other practices within the company that women found to be demeaning. UAA released a statement in response to the WSJ report, stating that the company has ""addressed these serious allegations of the past and will continue to address workplace behavior that violates our policies."" With the #MeToo movement building global momentum, we expect these allegations to strain UAA's partnerships with influential female athletes, and to dampen brand trust long term. We keep our 12-month target at $20, valuing UAA using a discounted cash flow analysis. We keep our 2018 adjusted EPS estimate at $0.23 and 2019's at $0.33."
UA or UAA - which one would you buy? (if you were wanting to buy Under Armour stock)
UA is up 5.37% to 20.80
"Wait for it to trade back in the low 12's and purchase for a swing trade. Also hold some long term, just use the trading range to make back some of the money I'm down on UAA."
Under Armour is down 11.07% to 7.95
UAA reached a 52 Week high at 26.30
"bought at the close yesterday, looks like a good bet so far"
"Hey folks, I'm out here in Lackland Texas AFB. I noticed most of the apparel in stores for both civilian and service are all UNDERAMOUR."
"While the company's CEO and founder, Kevin Plank, is no stranger to self-serving promotion and insider deal-making for his personal gain, including having UAA buy land the CEO bought with personal money (which is one thing the SEC may be looking at), it just seems odd that the company's CFO and other key executives have departed while the company's being probed."
"UA will close the week over $12. Black Friday promos are reasonable - they are not giving the store away with crazy promos based on all the email offers so far. Decent prelim results from Black Friday for retailers should serve as another catalyst and give UA another bump. All these step ups keep putting the floor slightly higher. Nice, gentle slope back up."
back up the truck!
"Look at UA this way. People have not been buying apparel of any kind. When people start shopping again, UA will be one of the logos they buy."
Was being hopeful
Joe Rogan made a post about picking up his new #KeepHammering Underarmour trail shoes from Cameron Hanes!
Managements quietness....Is deafening!!....like a jet engine taking off
No wonder JP Morgan upgraded UA. They are the agent to issue new debt. This stock will $15 in early June.

Shut up mike! Its just a survey from the same negative publicists. Thing is that after all this bad news the share should would go to 8 if it did not already rock bottomed. MongoloidBuy buy buying time again
Stop comparing Nike to UA. Nike has Jordan's. that one brand can crush UA today if split.
"For those of you who want information on suing Under Armor for screwing you with your share price:NEW YORK, March 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The Law Offices of Vincent Wong announce that a class action lawsuit has been commenced in the USDC for the District of Maryland on behalf of investors who purchased Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE: UA, UAA) securities between July 24, 2014 and January 30, 2017."
its not a formal charge and are cooperating with sec to reach a solution
UAA reached a 52 Week high at 27.42
"Where does everyone fall on what kids (not adults) are wearing these days? I feel like 5 years ago, it was all UA. Now, not so much as Adi, Nike and Lulu are just taking over the youth segment. Did they break out youth biz in last call? Just don't see it on the kids, both at kids school and on the fields, like I once did. The retraction has been swift. I don't believe current strategy gets the youth segment going again. Limited brand impact/shrinking platform means limited future potential, if any.I think it stays between $19-23 for next 12 months, at least, based on current metrics and what I see in the marketplace."
Clawback from Plank? How does the SEC recover the ill gotten gains? Interesting?
Perfect buying opportunity. Misleading headlines driving a price down. Buy Buy Buy.
Dipping my toes back into UAA after watching it for a year. I’m a buyer at these levels
UA is a sweet deal still. Buy one share every day and get rich with me...
Did the Taylor Swift and Under Armour announcement happen yet?

I got a 10 year holding period on my shares of UAA. Easy money over that period of time!
"UA quietly got out of Boston College to go along with UCLA and Cal, which were not so quiet. Probably an upfront payment of .50-.75 cents on the dollar and an amount of product to get BC through a year or two of athletics to give them time to find another provider."

this stock is overvalued!
"I've lost over 250k on this pos, worse investment ever"
No insider buying....been dark for a while. They must be in hiding. Plank getting into the Hotel business and throwing his shirts in the trash

"This is the end of the mid term down turn... UA is heading into their prime fall season, with back to school, College football, Pro Football, and High school/club sports. UA is Made for Performance, not the celebrity of the day. UA begins with YOU."

"I should have known that this Cramer darling was a loser.More downgrades from investment analysts. UA will just resort to sell their stuff at Kohls, WalMart and other discount apparel shops. I feel like a sucker for ever buying this over-valued equity."

That loud sound you just heard was the Dead Cat Bouncing .... $15 is the New target for UA .... Get out now before you are left holding the bag !!

UA wont survive this
Why is UA up when the market is down? Don’t see any news out today.
"1st 30 minute of buying to days high done over 30 minutes on 250,000 shares. Following 15 minutes of selling done on 350,000 shares.Past 10 minutes on almost no volumerest of day is long."
UA is up 8.43% to 8.69
"Done alot of soul searching the past few days and as much as it pains me to say it, get out!! I bought uaa at 30 thinking a 40% haircut was as low as it could go but obviously i was very wrong. I dont see anybody wearing their gear anywhere anymore except the occasional sweatshirt. This will drop 25% after earnings. I am not short but i am no longer long. So good luck to all but i dont think any amount of growth overseas can outweigh whats happening here."
This is a total joke
"Foward PE nearly 60, Curry 5 getting terrible reviews, declining in the US market and nearly $1B in debt while not turning a profit... Should be in the single digits.."
Under Armour-= the old LA GEAR ?It is UCLA Gear...... almost there Planky !!
"In a Tuesday note, B. Riley analyst Susan Anderson maintained a Sell rating and a $12 price target on Under Armour shares, well below the FactSet average of near $21. The stock is up roughly 18% in 2019.“This is the second year in a row Under Armour has moved down in [the] basketball ranking after reaching third behind Nike (NKE) and Adidas (ADDYY) in 2017,” Anderson wrote. “This is concerning given footwear is one of Under Armour’s growth vehicles. We believe this is reflective of the limited innovation we have seen in Under Armour footwear compared with Nike and Adidas.”"
"Expect some ""correction"" on Monday.............."
It's 2013 again. The stock price.
"Without quality shoes I can’t see this stock going much higher this year. It’s terrible they put all their great athletes in mediocre at best shoes. For being a performing brand they are definitely getting outperformed at their own game by Nike. I’m actually a supporter of UA, but I will wait on the side lines till I see improvements in there products or a big drop."
awesome stock. lots of upside potential.
"UA #$%$ on the hunting, anti-hunting, Trumps economic policy and the democratic party all in one year... Dude, you sell clothes. That's it...Keep your beliefs out of the boardroom! As much as I hate NIKE, they are the better play...$6-$8 by the end of the year. Mark it on your calendar!"
Looks like Kevin Plank stepped in . Now he needs to step out of a leadership role at UA if this company is to survive and recover.
Anyone consider buying?
UA is just a ponzi s scheme for management to getrich and Wells Fargo knows it.

Brady wasn’t wearing UA pants when they ripped. He mentioned this on twitter
"They’re just holding the price up until the earnings report, and then it’ll tank again like it always does, beat estimates or not!!"
"UA on its way back to high 16-low 17 range soon. Ridiculously written off as dead. ALL of the ""experts"" hate the stock. THat means it's time to BUY. GLTA."
Stop all the whining. Great buying opportunity here!!! Taking a large position. Predicting an earnings beat.
chart says 17-7.2 once 16.7 breaks through today.
What’s going on with the stock!!!
I love negative news. It drives the price down I buy more. By end of the year will be $20.00 plus stock again
Anyone had a chance to try the HOVR's?
What is your target price guys ?
Did everyone miss that their international sales were up almost 60%. This is where it is going to matter for this company!
"Nike does almost everything well, but they do have a couple weaknesses such as their anti-American leaning and use of slave labor. UA should spend some ad dollars and exploit it right now."
Seems like a good buy to me
My perception of Nike has changed drastically. It used to be if you had Nike you were cool. This isn't the case anymore. Under Armor has a much more even playing field now and I could see this AMERICAN brand benefiting greatly from Nike's downfall in marketing. UAA long and strong!
How many pairs of shoes does it take to compensate over-paid President hating celebrities?
Very surprised this went down only 33 cents - this overvalued stock could go down tomorrow by more than $1. Target price between $15 and $19.
Need to break and hold above $21 before next leg up. Hope to see $30 by year end.
"Columbia, Sketchers...all beat the estimate by big margin. same fireworks will be there on tuesday"
Smell what the rock is cooking 20s here we come
We have liftoff. Steph Curry's shoes sold out. And news is out just ahead of earnings.
Great earnings and raised guidance. A good combination.
Good long position to start GLTA
The TRUMP Train effect!! #MAGA
this is a $42 stock
Company cuts guidance!
Tomorrow???
"Expect shorts to cover when prices of goods drops so inventory glut eliminated, SGA drops, stock offering without voting is withdrawn and secondary is announced assuming it pays off debt not exec bonuses. I will look seriously only AFTER these things are done! IMHO"
it's called Uncle Martin in china..
Go UA!!!! Screw Nike!!!!!!
is ER tomorrow moring?
Problem is at top..... poor senior management..... Fix it or sell it Plank
This stock will continue to tank until they can post a profit.
"If I've learned anything about trading this stock since the big hit in Jan, it's that hot streaks like this are normally followed by slow days. In at 17.83 out at 21.20. I'll consider buying in again closer to their earnings announcement if things are still looking up. GS finals win isn't going to flip this company around."
Shorts are spamming this board the mothers of all squeeze's is coming and so is $30.WE KNOW
UA will go to 23.00 easy
The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. This is the case here.. very very irrational for UAA to have a market cap under $6 Billion. If you think UAA is evaluated fairly at this level then short it.. but look at NKE and Adidas market cap first. This will shead some light on it for you.
Sup
"takes a week and a half to come up 10% and its gonna give half of it back today because lulu gave poor guidance. think I have to admit defeat on this pos. I wish you all well but to kevin plank I say ""choke on it"""
I say it’s a buy
"UA's new HOVR shoes are completely sold out on their website for men and almost all of the HOVRs are sold to women as well. For people thinking this company is going down and some morons even saying it going bankrupt like Mike, couldn't be any more wrong. UA is a very valuable company, you've got some of the best athletes in the history of their sport, (Curry, Brady, Phelps, etc,) a massive deal with UCLA to target one of the biggest markets in the world. The MLB deal that is starting in less than a year."
Glad to see Kevin Plank and his liberal company getting beaten into the ground due to the CEO's stupidity. Maybe someday he will learn to think before he speaks. I hope the NFL and their sponsors are watching . . .
Zero chance of positive news. This thing is done.
"I calculated UnderArmour sold out 22 colorways of shoes this quarter on their website. If you don't believe me, go to their website and verify. The sold outs include the following: - Pink Currys -White/Gold Currys- Pi Day Currys - Malaria foundation Curry reds - 5 colorways of the men Hovrs - 5 Colorways of the men Sonics - 4 colorways of the women Hovrs - 3 colorways of the women sonics - Project Delta whites (and almost sold out in yellow and grey) Their forecasted revenue is 1.12Billion for this, any insight into if they will hit this mark on the 26th based on the information from above?"
"UnderArmour loses another $183 million, https://finance.yahoo.com/news/under-armour-loses-another-183-121304280.html"
Cramer said to buy UA yesterday.... that is when I sold.
dying company ... chap 11
UA is a long term winner

pump it to $18 please - UA is the best wear for me
"I just cashed out the little I had left from my bungled investment in Charlotte's Web, and invested it here. So, if I've cursed all of you, I sincerely apologise."
And their site is about 10% of their total business you idiot! And next to that 50% of what is being sold on the site is mainly driven by sales from their own staff cause they get a discount of 40-50%. You need to check out key accounts of them and all the ecom sites where they are selling. Ser if they have the same numbers. Funny you base all your knowledge on what they sell on their own site! Not representing reality gshaun the sheep
"When Golden State wins tonight, this stock will skyrocket on Monday!"
Why has ua dropped from 100? It's a decent brand. is it a problem with the business structure?
Great news for UA that Nike is going down the toilet BUY BUY BUY
It’s like Hanes Brands ..HBI.....it’s what you wear under your clothes ...people will not pay a lot for things others cannot see !
wow.. ua will be taken out by virus
"I am not expecting UA to crash Nike, but I have faith on the brand...in my opinion the design and quality of UA can compete with any top Brand... UA is on the 16's and Nike is above 50.. Adidas is over 150... i think is a great opportunity UA now for the long run..I am buying more because I like it and believe on the brand..."
I searched through he past couple weeks of comments in this section. I'm surprised not a single person here is aware of the the situation going on with the stock you invested in. Please take this time to do your DD so you don't end up losing money.https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-78
"Can't justify holding this as every day you lose additional capital that you could put to work safely other places,sorry for all your losses but this is a losing cause at this point with shorts obviously in control!"
UA athletes cleaned up last night at the ESPYs. Thought that would give the stock a bigger bump this morning. Can only imagine how well the stock would be doing if the Warriors and Steph didn't choke away the finals and if Jordan Spieth didn't melt down at the Masters. Love the leadership with Plank and the innovation he is bringing to Baltimore. Going to hold onto this stock for a long time
buy @13.91aggressively
the one athlete i would not resign is Steph Curry. He does nothing to promote.
"Next week it will be the hottest sports retailer in the business. For no reason, on no news."
ua is everywhere. wait until NFL ties deal with them. it's not going anywhere. go long and make $$
"Well, Durant the mvp for me so far... marvellous player.."
How about more time opening global market and less time making come back videos?
"Wow, another upgrade bc a conversation went well............really ppl"
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-under-armour-uaa-14-144702476.htmlUnder Armour (UAA) reported earnings 30 days ago. What's next for the stock ? We take a look at earnings estimates for some clues.
Like this if you think Mike is a loser
"What a pitiful stock to hold at this point. It has gone down since 2016 from over 40 to todays 15.50. I expect it will be worth about 12$ in the next month. Glad I didnt hold at 40, but had been looking to get entry for the past year as it stagnated. Now will definitely not be buying until everything is sorted out. Then will be checking if it is even a growth company as the other sports brands gain additional market share globally. What a disaster"
HOVR phantom shoes are amazingly good - out of stock?
Finally get results out tomorrow - Hope they come in Better than expected but at least results will be out and analysts and investors will be able to value on 2018 estimates. Go UA Long
"Is CFO Chip Molloy leaving because he sees no future and thinks UA is a dead company, or is he being forced out since he/they completely choked on the forecast and outlook? Anyone have the inside scoop?"
Power Hour Son.
This ticker is poised to strike back to its prior resistance value. I am forecasting it to hover back up to $20 per share.
"Delayed earnings reaction? Okay, I'll take it."
here comes 23.5-24
"when there is fear, hostility and negative news, stock gets hammered, left for near death. At that time, the clean up crew comes in and buys all the dumped shares."
This is BS lol. It'll come down...
Great entry point. You've got to believe that this ship is making the turn around with new CEO.
Should be lower
"Tiny BRAIN, giant EGO, COMPANY NEEDS TO BE SOLD and cleaned out"
So they made 4 HOVR shoes and sold all 4 or them. so what? That can mean management suck at planning. Note: I bought at $41 so I'm down quite a lot. I'm holding for another 5 years because I believe in Kevin's vision.
going from bad to worse I'm glad I did not buy in
Time to buy today and hold till next earnings?
heavy buying column collecting. all the shorties can try and make a last ditch effort but 13/14 is coming.
"Kevin is butt hurt that KD called out UA. He's not just saying that. It's true. I said that exact thing a while ago on this board. No pro player wants to be associated with UA. Like I said, don't be surprised if Steph drops UA. They've done nothing for him - look at this stock price. You guys are just to full of yourselves to realize the reality. UA should stick to gym wear. That's the only place they have hope."
"Way Too much negative news to buy in here,looks like additional news will surface on this company in the coming days!"
"What happened to ""the only way is through"" ad campaign?"
UA is up 8.71% to 7.49
"UA could still go under ... with Nike, Addidas there. So long term I won't want this"
Somebody please help me. I do not understand why people that say this is a junk stock even waste their time to write their comments on the message board if it’s terrible don’t come to the board I literally do not understand why people who trash talk are hear. I wish you good fortune on every body who invest in any company I don’t wish for it to go down or call people stupid for thinking that something such as under armor will fail. I’m 27 years old I’m going to continue to acquire the stock for years I think it will pay off in the long run. Time will tell.
They charge to much for their sneakers and there nothing special .
Down to 12.80 AH.
Good run up last couple days! Taking profits
Has Kevin Plank sobered up enough yet to see what is going on with this company he is suppose to be running??
Wow I was expecting a much better report. Just in line. Not enough to justify a $44 stock price. I think we fall back below under $40 and it will present another buying opportunity.
urge mr plank to resign
The kids today...what are they choosong...nike Adidas or ua?
An abysmal report...north America ain't growing...net revenues barely rose 2.6 percent...joke. z
DKS just mad they no longer hold a monopoly on the retail of this great product. Not to mention the fact Academy Sports is kicking their butts.
Is the SEC case completed?..
Why no Spieth bump today after he wins the British Open? The times they have changed.
I bought some more shares and a new hoodie! Grabbing some more CVS as well.
Game Day!!!!
buy at $6.90 for day trade
The future is bright and the product is good in the long term. There is no reason at all to not be in this right now.
UA is up 8.62% to 8.95
Selling my nike and buying more UA!!
"I have, what is more than likely, a stupid question: ""I'm thinking about getting in here, but why are there ""2"" Under Armour stocks?"" UAA, and UA. ??? Different class shares, or what? Thanks in advance."
"It sounds like some big money players on wallstreet need to cover their shorts, so their having their lap-dogs come out with some very negative opinions. They're afraid that if UA earnings report looks good, they will have a difficult time covering. I've seen this done before on other stocks. They want to scare away those thinking of buying"
Oversold with a PE over 40??? I'm long UAA but I'm not delusional. More pain to come.....
"Motley Fool pumping foolish garbage! Don't be Fooled by them or any dead cat bounce,you've been for warned,don't make me say I told you so!"
Keep adding going to 20
UA is down 7.99% to 10.25
Question about the UAA shares vs UA shares. Since the shares are the same (Plank controls the voting rights anyway) is there a benefit at all to owning the UAA shares? Can they dilute the UA shares without diluting the UAA shares?
I see $25 very soon
Kevin Durant gets injured all the time In nikes. Must be the shoes.

$UAA Upgraded by Oppenheimer Holdings Market Perform » Outperform USD 30
good to see that some investors realize that this brand is still a huge player. haha that 10% down day was just better buying price. granted I wasn't riding it all the way down from the all time high either. I just got in at all time low. my condolences for your account values:)
Another brand (champion?) is taking more space than UA
Has anyone checked out their popular new sports face masks?
If the market performed based on my feelings I wouldn’t have to worry about money I just have a feeling that if I stick in this for the long term it will pan out. Bought more shares today.
I told you all that the earnings pop came before earnings.
"Nike has a lower PE of 26, and they pay 700 million a year back to share holders in dividends."
Why the jump AH?
UA is a buy when/if it hits $5.00 per share.
"Everyone talking about How this fail to make it fashion brand. Why you need to make it fashion brand. This is performance brand and as long as it stick to principle, I think it will come back big time. All analyst are bias and main reason has nothing to do with fundamental. It has to do with how many are shorts on stock. I was holding long spread earlier in jan reason I sold Stock for loss, and before I sold, 1 month back I brought calls. Now to lock all good profit, I also sold $13-$15 calls and I found that someone exercise my short call. Next I got call from my broker to cover immediately because they can't borrow shares. I try my best including offering to pay significant premium for borrowing but he not agree. Reason I was willing to offer premium because my $5K+ tax loss now converted to wash sale.Next day all analyst start negative comments on this stock and drop from 16+ to $14."
"The name of this company is completely wrong. It is in no relationship to armor. The real name of this company should be modeled after the owner, who is a big #$%$. Here's a new name : PUSSYSKIN."

"FYI. No one wears UA junk. No one. Everyone is on the Nike, Jordan and Adidas bandwagon.There were lines and raffles for the Jordan retro 6, the Lebron James Kith lifestyle edition sold out online in 10 minutes. Same with the Retro 6 gatorade edotion.I buy and sell these shoes and make 30%-400% profit. And this is just play money."
They have almost sold off all there overstock so that's discounted prices but it's all good
Going to 5
I bought some in the morning and sold in spike. I will wait till noon to see if the selling pressure will continue same as yesterday.
"What do you guys think about the contract they have with MLB to start making their jerseys,Not only form games but for fans. Dont you think that will give UA a push?"
here comes 19.2-20 range
Hopefully should beat earnings and get a pop of $1-$2
Shot out to everyone who grit their teeth and held on the past couple of months. #Longs
The Curry 4 Golds that were released on Friday sold out within 3 days!
Is this gonna be another gopro? Earnings estimates set so low that they gonna beat it for sure.
I've been waiting a long time for this breakout to happen.
want ever buy your #$%$ again idiot. Bad move
"UAA is under Liquidity Crisis, loosing millions each day. This pullback will drop it below $2 soon. Get out ASAP."
Worst messaging I have ever seen in a report. these guys do not know how to communicate to street.
Looks like UA is a shill
One year cup base pattern. Hopefully cup and handle. Look at VRX last two days cup and handle pattern take off. I own that too!!!
"UA will be bought out by a VC company, and turned around. Because the current CEO is a fool. Built a fairly decent brand, then proceeded to waste it. Enough cheap polyester, filmy polos and t-shirts. Start making real clothes...and shoes!"
strong buy here. better products than Nike. less woke BS. on their way back up!
If Motley Fool is trying to manipulate the UAA stock by posting erroneous new articles is that a crime?
patience....... tariffs are on the way. Soon will be moving lower
Blood bath
Any dead cat bounce is most likely a sell.
"Went to UA and Nike outlets located in same shopping venue. Nike had a lot of customers, UA none."
"I sold at $12 today. My cost basis was $32. Took a $8000 loss. All thanks to the absolute worst CEO in the world, the incomparable Kevin Plank.If I ever meet Kevin Plank in person, he will meet my fist in his face and do serious damage. To the tune of $8000. I wish I had never heard of this POS stock and company. Kevin Plank is a real son-of-a#$%$."
The financial media sure have their favorites and UA is obviously not one of them. It's almost like they're mad that it went up today. Bitter and angry and determined to make sure it doesn't continue.
"JUST ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE FOR UNDER ARMOUR SHAREHOLDERS.......ALL THANKS TO THE TOTAL AND INDISPUTABLE INCOMPETENCE OF ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE, THE CLOWNISH AND TRUMPANZEE SUPPORTER KEVIN PLANK.KEVIN PLANK - PLEASE RESIGN FOR THE GOOD OF ALL UAA SHAREHOLDERS."
How was this up 16% premarket and now trading lower?
This sucker is hitting turd status.
"Take next year's guidance of $5.4B, put a 12% net margin on that and a 20 PE and you've got a market cap of $13B. UA will not achieve that margin anytime soon, but that's what NKE does as a mature company with scale. Using this as a guide I don't see a ton of additional downside unless the economy just falls off a cliff."
should have stayed out of politics - CEO is an amateur... Need real leadership at this company not some SJW who wants to be invited to the cool people parties.
in @ 21.43
"bought thus at 47. so have to hold on for a while, really disappointed in this stock and plank"
"This stock is a joke, bag holder since $25. Just sell the company already."
"Under Armour is out as the next official jersey supplier for Major League Baseball after Nike signed a 10-year deal with the league that begins in 2020. Under Armour made waves in 2016 when it announced that it signed a preliminary deal with MLB to take over for Majestic as the official apparel supplier for the league once its contract runs out after the 2019 season. Nike will design all MLB on-field uniforms, -- which will feature Nike's iconic Swoosh logo -- game-day outerwear and all training apparel for the league's 30 clubs, and sports merchandise company Fanatics Inc. will manufacture and distribute the apparel.https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/nike-replace-under-armour-as-next-jersey-supplier-for-mlb-14845987?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO&yptr=yahoo"
"Sorry guys that was a big loss, could see 6 this week, hoping downgrade won't follow"
"Verus International, Inc. (VRUS) check this stock. You will never regret. Q3 +6M revenue. Don’t be late ( Cheap but big chunks of money )"
Love that EOD breakdown. 
"The ceo ego kill UA and now he is humble by how stupid he was. He lost many loyal customers. Female all wen to LULU, adidas and many loyal male customers went back to Nike because of his loud mouth."
"Nike stock is not booming, Adidas not going up, everybody loves beating up UA. just another business tactic to drive stock price down so the millionaires can buy it low....."
Has anyone noticed the increased lack of quality in UA apparel? My wife had 2 pairs of running tights essentially melt in the dryer late last week and the stitching seems to be poor. Maybe it's cost savings taking hold around fabric and production. Wanted to see if others had noticed anything similar??
Why down so much today?any thoughts?
Believe me ( as the Donald would say ) this company will be bought out ... Believe me !!
And they are talking about cancelling the summer Olympics. That will bury this company.
"You can tell when your message board has a troll virus infection:1) Someone posts constantly.

Could twitter add a ban list... someone need to be banned... just saying
Wall Street criminal X Under armour
"The market is wrong on this stock. UA reported an increase in revenue despite having a 1% decrease in North America sales. UA generates 70% of its revenue from North America, which means it is finally starting to perform well overseas, which is a huge market. To put things in perspective, Nike only generates about 35% of its revenue from North America. With the job cuts, UA clearly has a plan set in place. This is a great company with a vision. Don't lose faith on this stock!"
"plank, what a moron this guy is"
There it is! Bloodbath continues! Shorts In Charge!
Very heavy short interest. Turnaround is in process. Lower debt. Lower inventories. US is only weak number. Everywhere else is growing. My guess is manipulation down on pretty much in line numbers to give shorts one last chance to cover. 20% drop makes no sense on report.
Anyone else find it funny that we were on a roll and then Under Armour comes out with the whole hunting issue. I'm kind of curious now as to who made that call and why someone at Under Armour wants to drive this stock's price down. The stock is seriously under valued and someone is trying to keep it that way.
Is this company another Sports Authority?
Slam it down for options and walk it up next week
18.3-18.5 today -IF it goes to 18.9-19; I might be tempted to sell half
UA just begins to expand in China ... now it is bad imho
This bouncing dead cat has 9 lives apparently
Why is it down?
"The pain is considerable for Plank, and he could decide to sell out to VF Corp. to take UA to the next level. $30 a share would be the price."
time for pop to 19.2x soon.
"Motley Fools trying to re-coop losses by pumping today,more carnage before shorts get worried,share offering on the horizon will add dilution big time,the only way they can finance now that their bond rating is junk,so watch for that!"
Today is a good day!!! For UAA
https://finance.yahoo.com/video/canaccord-genuity-analyst-says-sell-162100632.html
all i can say is look at teva and compare some restructuring and some upgrades and a double
"Per The Rock: ""Over the years, I've failed hard and had my dreams crushed, which inevitably put my back up against the wall."" Sure sounds like a great business model for UAA!https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/under-armour-and-dwayne-johnson-challenge-you-to-answer-how-are-you-going-to-get-here-in-new-global-training-campaign-300632921.html"
Performance mask sales skyrocket !!
If we go into a recession.. this stuff will be at the dollar stores
UA HOVRs are sold out on their website. great news!
Whats the difference between UA and UAA???
2$ off in a week from 17.7x to 15.7x - time to accumulate again.
Basically $1 off 52 week low. New lows by Friday- no... Wednesday.
Winners never cheat. Cheaters never win at the end. Only President Donald Trump and GOP Congress can make Under Armour Great Again.https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/04/under-armour-uaa-earnings-q3-2019.html
Lol Mike just recycled an old article again. What a sore loser.
Any green close would be great....BUT let's get over 18.25 today to get us near 20 in few days.
Let's take a moment of silence for our fallin' short sellers like Mike. Be nice...He is losing money!
"you think this is a good reason why the stick moved up ? Because the styling of ibe kind if running shoes changed ! Under Armour Inc. UAA, -0.49% UA, -0.05% is adding a fresh look to the Curry 5 lineup this week, a signal of the excitement surrounding the latest iteration of the sneakers bearing the name of the popular NBA player, Steph Curry. Under Armour introduced the Curry 5 on Pi Day, March 14, priced at $130. Just 314 pairs were available initially, though the shoes were restocked in April, according to Sole Collector. Now the site reports that Curry has been wearing a ""Welcome Home"" version of the shoe, with the first sighting at Curry's comeback game earlier this month. That shoe will be released on Friday, also priced at $130. The Curry 5 was sold out on the Under Armour website as of Wednesday afternoon. Previous versions of the shoe were notwell received. Steph Curry and his team, the Golden State Warriors, are currently in pursuit of the league championship. Under Armour shares have jumped 7.5% in Wednesday trading, and are up 40.6% for the year so far. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.41% is up 2% for 2018 to date."
Plank needs to put his money where his fat mouth is....buy some shares and show some confidence in UAA.
Any thoughts on a UA option?
SELL SELL SELL
Is UAA or Is UAA one of the worst stocks ever? Pity those who bought @40
Yuuuup Goldman upgraded to buy with 28 bucks price target!!!! Boooooooom!!’nn
Technical analysis is improving to Buy. 3 day EMA just crossed over the 8 day EMA. Strong entry level signal. Buy and hold until the 3 day dips below the 8day.
Upgraded with a $12 PT...About time. Been holding for awhile now...
amazing how the best suposobably banks and or advisers and whoever else downgrades r wrong time to time point is all a gamble no matter which way you look at it just b patient believe ur beliefs
NOw is time to buy with this low price..... It will shoot up in the afternoon
"now i realized that we should not buy apple, amazon, alphabet.. because they can rarely go up"
Did anybody read my post on this breaking 20. Yes I sold today but it will go higher I’m waiting for the pullback a week from now
"It couldn't hold the pop, only down all day from here. Price action says everything."
$4.00 stock
"hard to see institutional interest in UA. For past hour volume is avg 3000 shares a minute, 5p per second. This is likely retail buyers who'll be ponded by closing bell. I guess we'll see by end of next week if the earn report has traction or gets faded."
They have gone to the bottom already and are turned around earnings will beat estimates and they will have done even better then last quarter I hold my shares I see $34 a share in 2 years or less
looking good UAA
If UA pulls back then it perhaps won't be a surprise given the current neutral EPS(ttm) of 0.45. The opposite could happen though. Im not sure about you guys but awesomestoc-ks has provided me with some pretty good trade ideas. I messed up executing some of them but thats on me.
Bought more.
and it looks like we may be in trouble here... hope for a buyout or major change in management's approach
Why is this down so much?
You all know me. You know my posts. I have consistently called for the dismissal of Kevin Plank. I have been calling for his removal for months now. The stock continues to plummet under his obvious ineffective and destructive leadership.Please - everyone - join me now in calling for his removal. Call the BOD. Call other shareholders. Call anyone......but let's succeed in getting rid of Mr. Plank and restoring a positive direction to the stock price.
WARNING: Good ol JPM baiting the public then they will dump their shares. Wait to buy in it will drop plenty in the next 6 months ;)
UA is down 4.91% to $16.85

"All most all Hovr connected Phantom is sold out. Curry 4 is also very hot. Look like Under Armour finally making inroad to Footwear market as well. If earning result confirm volume, it's new hot new trend and stock will go to $30+ easily. Just like Sketcher."
"UAA has zero interaction with their stockholders. I have many shares but all I get is crickets when I ask for someone to return my many calls. I would like to know if the CARES program is going to save them from sure bankruptcy. Also I would like to know the progress of the SEC investigation. Also I had a suggestion to help out connecting the company with an outlet like Rite Aid whose allowed to stay open in their 18 markets regardless of the pandemic. Maybe since Rite Aid is in a neighboring town, Plank could sit down with the lady at Rite Aid who also is in deep doodoo. Maybe create an off the rack area in each store. This stock has been tanking for 5 years!!!"
Is Plank even alive? Has anyone seen him lately?
UAA is down 9.02% to 8.98
You guys are crazy it's not going to get lower then $18 period do you realize how fast they were growing and now it's slowed for many reasons but they will make a big come back period but it while you can here or don't UA is a great brand and more athletes will come to there company for that $$$$
short at will
buying at 15
"They are worried about inventory levels in Q4, but inventory went up 24% in Q2?? After going up 7% in Q1? Can they please figure out inventory vs demand? Holiday is the biggest season in retail, and they won't have enough inventory...really??Amazing the inability of the Sr. Management team and Board to get things right as it seems like every quarter something else pops up and takes the headline as it relates to operating a business."
"They should include trump bashing in the guidance. “We expect weak North American revenues to be offset by our CEO’s virtue-signaling. We expect to blow the opportunity handed to us by Nike by engaging in comparable liberal idiocy. However, we expect the smug self satisfaction arising from owning stock in a woke leftist circle j of a company to more than compensate for the 30% stock price decline caused in part by our banal posturing.”"
"Would love to see great earning report this week,"
All work no play! Stock will fall about 5 percent by Friday.
Just muted John! I did not realize that feature was present. How cool! Feeling relieved!
And look at it lose it gains pre-market
"how did this go premarket up 12%, to down 7%? I was busy all morning, what a joke!"
Really this is strange very low volume too
16.7-16.8 today would be nice surprise for a close.
what needs to happen for this stock to break through already?????!!!!! its been stuck in the $18-22 range forever!
sell weekly OTM calls for months. finally it was assigned at 19.5 last Friday. Will sell 19.5 puts before earning.
"Just wondering how cnbc and the analyst are registered politically. This may and I say ""may"", be politically motivated. As all things are considering Planks favor for Trump not politically but in a financial business realm. I will do some research to my ""may"" question."
Under Armour is down 4.99% to 19.23
How awesome would it be if the same short squeeze happened like when Porsche bought VW....... that would be a wonderful day
another 52 week low
going down. Back to $12 ! Numbers are really bad.
$80 stock
Neighbors at the summer condo took the young athlete son to the UA store for more of the choice young groups clothes. Wore some really stylish new shirts around the destination.Seeing the brand more and more with new season styles...I'll go the Peter lynch route and hold on for guided increased earnings...Patience will be rewarded...
Hahahaha bam bam
UAA reached a new 52 Week High at 23.82
Corona has been a huge blessing
Do you all truly believe a Goldent State win will effect the stock price? Read that a lot here in the comments and not sure if jokes or not. Sincere question gents.
"Anti-Trump Plank, we do not want your products ... Please resign now."
"This is not the bottom folks, there is still more damage to be down here. Plank stated the company might not make any money this year. On top of that, the Curry 4's are delayed. there is a perfect storm that UA needs to navigate."
"Patrik Frisk should be good, but he also failed it seems"
I'm in on this one . Important to separate the politics from what consumers can and will purchase from WMT.
Short!
"uaa will be bought out my amzn, theyre looking for a clothing line. Then Plank can spend better time getting drunk from his own supply."
"Where is this stock going? Why has it dropped so much in a week? Any ideas, going up or down?"
fine no 18(s) - we will take 22 tomorrow.
Have owned UAA off and on for years. Sold my stock about a year ago after my last order of short sleeve shirts. The quality had dropped noticeably from previous. Half the shirts fit properly the balance not so much. UAA took the shirts back and refunded my money. Never had to do this before. The quality has dropped. The prices not so much. Bad quarter over the Christmas season definitely not a good sign. Not buying now.
This may explain why this stock is so beat up:https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/48356314-greenman512/4988951-armour-case-market-inefficiency
hello guys I'm new in stocks. what is the diff of UA and UAA? TIA
Back to $12 and eventually $5 when the accounting Fraud details are revealed. Companies who lie need to be punished. Old CFO's are probably on way out of the country.
Going to $20
Under Armour headed to single digits.... Long term chart shows the slide down the right side of the mountain... 50 and 200 moving average are history. Next potential support area is the 11.45 area that you all saw back in 2013 and more then likely will over shoot that weak support area.... More like under water and diving deeper.
$20 my selling target
UA is heavily pushed in the armed forces. Lot more military personnel will wear Under Armour. They provide better deals and clothes tailored to military support as well. Don’t see any other brand doing this.
"Theoretically speaking, short squeeze can move it up to $103. unlimited loss"
"Look at all these angry shorts lol, they are pooping their pants as speak. Did you guys really think that UA was staying this low for this long? This is a great company with great brand recognition and has a ton of potential to grow globally. Their MLB deal kicks in beginning 2019, they have some the best-known athletes in the world, they are investing and becoming more athleisure. Ultimately they will get bought out by Nike, Adidas, or Amazon. This is a great company. John go pound sand you moron"
"All you have to look at is the Forward PE and PEG ration on this and you know to run. If we hit a recession, this will be killed. With that being said...I love UA...just not at this price."
All I can say is Plank better deliver.
short squeeze is coming
I'm long on this I love the company the shoes and clothes love me they will out perform Nike someday if they are ran right ! How do I know this cause everyone loves there stuff it's a name brand company and will come back like a rocket !!! I hold even if we see $15 a share I'll just buy more great deal
Motley Fool Too Funny!
I like their new business plan. Sounds very proactive
Make sure to check out EKSO. Just landed a deal with Ford. Big gains this week!

"All you cheerleaders for UAA doesn't help the stock one iota. Do any of you realize why NKE dominates the sports apparel and athleisure space over UAA? It's because women don't buy Under Armour, they buy Nike. Women look at Under Armour as a men's line, pure and simple. Not saying that's right but that's the way it is. Get that through your head."
How much gym clothes do people need. Really.
UA going to 50 soon
And yet they still lose money. Internationally cannot make up for it..
I hope you Bag Holders listened to me and got out last week ..... UA headed for $12 / Share ... Sorry !!!
NKE numbers down ua is going to get crushed at earnings
UAA is up 6.89% to 18.08
where is that #$%$-bag Mike?
Uh oh
"Good work longs in since day 1, you all deserve this"
UA should be hovering around $3. It's still too expensive with a multiple of 39. Especially now since the company has stated revenue will halve for Q2. Now Imagine if the country is still in lockdown for Q3 & Q4. Stocks are extremely overvalued.
I guess UAA will stay at its current 20+ price point until they release their next earnings report when they can show institutional investors and analysts that their earnings have improved
Should settle at support around $5. (20 cents earnings this year times a pe of 25 which may be too generous?)
My family loves UA. Nike and Adidas are way over rated. I see more wearing UA.
MUST HAVE BEST DESIGNS ENGINEERING CLOTHS
Great start to 2018! Baird analyst just Called UA the retail Stock with greatest multi-year upside potential.Happy New Year Longs!
"If you actually read the pr, it was a pretty solid quarter. I'm still high on the MLB deal for 2019 in beyond. pretty promising future for longs"
its a Rally!!
Thinking UA has finally bottomed. Guess I’ll start buying...
I'm in the Special Forces and our community is transitioning to UA tactical gear. I bought at 11.88 in Nov 17'. Holding for two years. Hold strong fellas! Make America Great Again!
I set a limit order at $15
Stick an apple in this pigs mouth. Its cooked.
why did. they. push back earnings release date?

"Frisk, who joined the company in July, purchased 14,000 Class A shares at an average price of $18.50 and 14,000 Class C shares at an average price of $16.62, according to a federal securities filing Monday. In total, Frisk purchased $491,680 worth of shares. The transactions took place on Friday."
"So on 1/9 within a few days there were 2 downgrades from analysts, the price was 12.5. It is now almost 16, isn't that great advice. That is most wall street research in a nutshell. Now don't forget they will upgrade it at 19, lol"
what a laggy piece of fshit. Everything up on market except this one. officially a bag holder.
"UA has just shown their loyalty to their investors and customers, what they think of your worthwhile, by pis+*|#$%$ your money away on booze and babes!!! Wow, am I ever done with this one...........burning my UA and selling this stock!!"
ALMOST no growth....$10-12 range
Going up folks will steal Nike market share
Lying on sales. Soon BKRPT.

"With the revised guidance, the forward PE ratio is now 100. There is no credible plan to reignite growth in the U.S. The only plan is to cut costs.The brand has been cheapened by selling through discounters. The only way to undo that is to reduce sales.How is this stock trading north of $10? Even at that level the PE is over 50."
"Liberals = Hatred, Violence."
17.58 is a good buy
Excellent earnings report turnaround happening in the making
B2B. Watch out Nike and Adidas. UA is back with a vengeance! See you at $25+!!!

WOW. what a peeeece of sheeeeeet.
Sold this one @20.12 march 2017. It is not a fun stock for longs.
"Plank's problem is that he is listening to Frisk, Haley, Bergman, Mirchin and BCG! They are the issues. I have said on this board before, the brand has no energy or momentum. Growth in North America is a long, long way off. Go look at what people are wearing at the airport, parks or at a game...it isn't UA. Plain and simple. And BCG, along with those leaders, are the one's who built and executed the strategy being executed. COO, Strategist, CFO and Consultant. That is Plank's big mistake."
"This stock will not stay down for long. If you are a short, it will be wise to cover your position here."
people are buying this trash? just have someone kick you in the nuts every day instead. this is worth $2 on the pink sheets
slow and steady. #blackfridayiscoming
"Buy it’s never going to revisit the lows, athletic gear is fashion, ua will slowly eat and Nike, 25 before year end"
Did Kevin Planck get fired today?He should have.This stock will not go back up until Kevin Planck is fired from his job.Where oh where is an activist investor to demand that Planck be fired.That's what we need.
"Nice gains today.. I think UA will continue to rebound nicely and offer investors a good short term rebound and even long term investing under their new CEO. I would love to see some of their endorsed celebs (Rock, Currie etc) do some advertisements in the near future, or on their new pride endorsed shoes: https://sports.yahoo.com/under-armour-2020-pride-collection-160808607.html"
Close around 21.5 is fine if not 21.9-22We almost had breakout yesterday but expected profit taking.It could see 20.5 today but i doubt it
The Fools at Motley Fool are indeed trying to manipulate the UA stock by posted negative fake news and comments. The SEC should investigate
"According to a CFSI survey, 44% of American citizens said their expenses exceeded their income in the past year and they used credit to make ends meet. Another 42% said they have no retirement savings at all.You think these folks will be buying UA products for Christmas or after? Not likely. This also applies to most of the world right now with power fin conditions than anytime over recent years and getting worse, not better. I'll stay short UA"
Locked in 2500 shares under $10. Can't wait till this Covid-19 hysteria is over...
"lank and Chief Financial Officer David Bergman received Wells Notices informing them that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is likely to “allege certain violations of the federal securities laws,” Under Armour said Monday in a regulatory filing. Under Armour also received a notice informing it that the agency may file an enforcement action against the company,,,"
Shorts are thinking this one is another ENRON. Long have a hope. This now is the battle between LONG AND SHORTS.
Lets see UA drop to 5 or less in return for Planck's hate speech against Americans.
worried about the sale numbers- shoes is a small portion
Watch for Nike takeover
"Another Target in the making...The silent majority will speak louder through action than words...Here's an idea, how about keeping politics out of business?"
2 years they been looking at this and they decided to say something now?....is management in on this scam?
UAA is down 11.52% to 8.83
Any advice on option calls? Long UA.
Ua stands for undermined america
I just sold 2/3 of my shares. scary how it is going down before the earnings
Sacking executives good news for Uaa
Where's all the people that bought at 18 calling it the bottom?
"Analysts rate UA UNDERPERFORM W/$14 PT . YES Please. These analysts must be short UA or long NIKE. Whatever , I prefer UAs style and quality. I'll backup the truck and boat @$14. No Brainer!!"
UA is a joke
"Hi , I interested in purchasing some under armor stock. What is the correct ticket ? UAA or UA? Please help . Thank you"
"Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank admitted Thursday that sales for Stephen Curry's current signature basketball shoe were disappointing.""Our success in basketball hasn't been without its learning,"" Plank said on the company's earnings call, in which Under Armour reported its first-ever quarterly loss as a public company. ""As we launched the Curry 3 late last year, our expectations continued to run high. And while the Three played very well on court for Stephen Curry and our athletes, a sluggish signature market and a warm consumer reception led to softer than expected results.""This has created an inventory imbalance that we are working through. One that, yes, is baked into our full-year outlook which hasn't changed and, most importantly, yielded lessons we're applying ahead with the Curry 4 and beyond.""That's not good news!"
"nobody talks about ua,s boots. I have a pair paid $200 for best boots I have ever owned. 3 of my friends have ua boots and love them. nike does not make hunting boots!!!"
obviously; today's close will dictate 20 or 16 first...18.2+ close (not sure)18.6+ would be nice.Any close below 18 would end the rally for now.
"Jay, not sure where you live, but I am in Ohio and UA clothing if not more often at least equal to Nike. I agree it is overvalued, doesn't seem to be a growth stock anymore, but may be it will grow into its evaluation."
Kevin Stank is killing us!
UAA reached a 52 Week low at 7.42
The market has been eagerly seeking an excuse to dump UA. Today they got it and ran wild.
what happened to the CNBC video on Plank ??
"Thanks for the recommendation Motley ""Fool"""
"Great company. Uses every type of marketing trickery to brainwash the young into buying Chinese made junk so that they don't feel left out.Let's face it. Ninety percent of UnderwAre buyers are overweight losers trying to relive the two years of greatness in high school.It's classic, lowbrow marketing. Preys on peoples' insecurities. Horrible company. I sincerely hope you bought this terd at $40."
I just need this to go down to the ankles 
UAA has been beaten for the last 2 years. UAA is not going bankrupt anytime soon. They have sales worldwide in the billions. Every dog has its day. They said the same about Twitter not beating the numbers. Just saying....
Very underpriced! Holding until it hit $100!
I’m in before the er Come on!!
"Well, this POS stock is right around my selling price of $12 last week. So maybe I bottom ticked the stock again. But I will not buy another share of this POS company and stock as long as Kevin Plank is CEO. The man is incompetent in more ways than I can list or count. If Plank is fired by the BOD and new blood is brought in, the stock will pop 20% easy and I may give it another whirl."
Mike shorted?
We should hit 32.00 next week. The Jan 32.50 calls will be a DOUBLE.
Political opinions have a very high price at the retail level.
I buy UA products only too!
"Regarding Deutsche Bank recommendation of UAA, this is Wall Street's version of the pot calling the kettle black.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deutsche-bank-announces-investment-bank-053613924.html"
Timber incoming.
This is the stype of stock that you hear horror stories about breaking shorts on margin. Retailers dont understand that when the institutions grab it (which will happen very very soon) the short squeeze will be so violent they will not be able to get out. Theyll double and triple up and owe money really fast. Remeber it goes up much faster than it goes down and your room for loses is infinity. Good Luck
still burning... Shareholders should get this idiot CEO out
"I see ppl wearing UA, but they’re old pucks like me that are wearing 10 year old clothes yet.... lol"
Been dead money for a while. I dont think being in Kohl's is really going to help the bottom line. This is a 10 year hold for me because I dont see how I'm going to see $32 in the near term. However will look to add more and are hoping for entry point of $16-17 to lower my average.
"All analyst action lately misleading all. Here is real reason.I have good amount of Tax loss last year. So in november, I brought bunch of In money calls. And Mid december I sold stock. Workout very well because price of stock raise quite a bit between november to December. In order to protect my gain, I sold bunch of different Calls expiring jan 19th. So I can claim tax loss without issues. Now nearly 10 of those calls got excercise ahead of time.Next I get call from my broker cover that short immediately. I force to buy it back and give up all my tax loss benefit for those 1000 stock which was biggest of all tax loss benefit.All these analyst working for those big player who shorted and now can't find volume to cover at lower price. Period.This is how badly Enitre stock market manipulated. Analyst will upgrade stock that all time high and will downgrade stock that all time low.$FSLR where I make most profit last year. I started buying $35 range and analyst keep downgrading, last downgrade put price target way below cash this company has on hand. Now this is company was still profitable even when most of other solar player can't make profit. Has history of better cost control and profitability yet they assign price target that below unrestricted cash on hand almost 50% below book value. Now that stock gone from $25 to $70+ since that last downgrade."
"Given the Curry 4 roll out is Friday, the stock should be rising."
"Eight years of a leftist creep in the White House who pandered solely to the creeps of the nation, legal and illegal. Now, the Creeps are deservedly in an animal like panic."
I think this company is one to buy and hold long the best growth stock over 10 years period the brand won’t go away
I love this stock as a long term play. I live in West Africa and see all the kids playing soccer here wearing UA gear (much more than Nike or Adidas). Huge overseas growth potential and a quality product. They grew too fast and just learning how to be this big and expand efficiently. They'll figure it out soon and this stock price will be in their rear view mirror.
Crushing the resistance level today!
"Under Armour, Inc. is expected* to report earnings on 05/01/2018 before market open. The report will be for the fiscal Quarter ending Mar 2018. According to Zacks Investment Research, based on 17 analysts' forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is $-0.05."
Down premarket
Slow down this rise my heart can't take this.
bought some today. there's gotta be substantial sales boost off the Nike news imho
Thoughts on the new ad campaign??https://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2019/09/10/under-armour-kicks-off-football-season-with-new.html?ana=yahoo&yptr=yahoo
Worst timing and first bad investing decision to buy at 24.90 before earnings. International Development starts with soccer and that takes time. I still can't see the bottom at the bottom of the well since pe is too high for guidance I took my remaining 75% of what I put in and into SHOP to make it back.
can down a little more!!
In the short-term UAA does not seem to be like a good trade. the other week awesomeSTO-CKS alerted this company i think. google them .
2 days in a row that she shorts are getting SQUEEEEEEZED! I love it!!
UAA is down -4.92% to 19.91
I still love you UAA
I’m in the market for some Under Armour shirts. This company will survive.

U.S. Special Forces Operators are transitioning to UA tactical gear.
With a show of thumbs up- how many of you think Mike is a fat loser that lives in his moms basement and is having a gay affair with John?
"Great products, I see UA merchandise being worn all over the place.But the business is being run about as poorly as the Trump administration.What a train wreck!"
Buy before Golden States wins tonight!!
Aha!
#$%$ is going on UA
Onward to $25!!!
Any news? Why the POS goes up today?
"Couple of thoughts here:1. Have you seen the resale market for the Rocks UA shoes?2. The above along with the Curry4 are certain to make positive impacts on their shoes sales moving forward***Shorting a stock that has 25% of the float already short is a risky proposition. My take is you will see a short squeeze in the next week or so. All of the negativity from the Motley Foll (multiple articles a week) are talking about things people already know and have priced in....what is NOT priced in is the sneaker division trouncing last years sales in the coming quarters on VERY low comps. Football season is also a good reason to go long....UA is very strong....buy great companies low for the spike......see TGT, WFM, SBUX etc....yes they are not what they once were, but when you buy after they got lambasted you got a 30% return in very short order."
UA reached an all time low at 7.17
I will keep saying to everyone...this company going to be bought out..we will see
"Just remember, you don't lose any money until you sell...or they go bankrupt."
John is like morthttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ID6-6cd5w
There is also a legitimate chance of UA going under.
UAA is down 8.99% to 10.42
UA will go up big soon
"After hours someone sold or bought 15,000 at 12.7496... ?? or its just short covering?"
To buy in.....?
"Needs 33% haircut from here for forward p/e of 12 ,$7 a share might be a buy but things could look must worse after terrible 4th quarter."
12 low 17 high in 6 month
UA is toast.. Going under $10
lost alot of money on this stock. Company not doing anything internationally to get their products out there to the consumer. Is this another LA gear? Company doesn't want to spend money for the long term. And no dividends.
Where are the bashers? Don't leave us now! We will miss you.
Go ua to 20s in no time
"lower prices for goods, lower SGA, lower pay offs to athletes = lower stock price. See you all at $5. IMHO"

Not Touching with a ten foot pole after all the Boycott News out There! Wow!
"Are you kidding me? Tanger outlet in NJ line was around the corner , costumers coming out with 2 hands holding bags, the way I see it $40 by the end of the year."
Get out now.. Sub $10 tomorrow..
Just like GoPro/CMG..this will probably dip again before $25
10 year low ouch
UAA is up 5.66% to 23.13
"Just can't catch a break here. Is Kevin Plank going to do anything other than collect his salary,benefits,and worthless stock options???"
So how soon do the tutes figure out that Plank cannot pay his debts. They are the only ones holding up this loser of a company.
closing under $10 today

"The Fed has already announced that they will be raising the interest rate 3-4 times this year. If UA cannot pay down their billion+ in debt today, how are they going to sustain the mounting debt going forward? Hype, logo, and branding do not pay the bills. Your continuing investment in this loser is going down a rat hole. And you all have given up your voting rights to stop this mad man! Wake up!"

$8 price target. Just unreal. $8 frickin dollars.Wasn't this stock once above $50? Thanks Kevin Plank - inarguably the very worst CEO in all the S&P500. Let me feel good for one second - KEVIN PLANK - YOU SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
wow sunk .54 in last 20 min. of trading day. that was strange
"The P/E seems high but market cap at $8B? They will have to go after Margin at the cost of Revenue and they won't be able to leverage fixed costs, so margins will further decline. They are over valued still."
Nice two days of trading this is setting up to run
This is what happens to you when you go against the TRUMP Train!!! #MAGA !!!
Buy now and this is bottom
And the hacking thing only gonna get worse just to make sure everyone gets an iris scan.. full control! If your freedom needs to be sacrified for your safety you will lose both
We need to root out those ANALysts who badmouthed UA - like investorplace(junk) - put their names on a website to warn people away.
Terrible management .
"Curry 5's are ugly sneakers, too expensive, and nobody is wearing them!"
LOL..what a head fake rally yesterday. Feel bad for those got caught
ok John we all know your a short but dam dude trying to post nothing but negative news isn't going to work buddy ...UA is on it's way up .. GET USE TO IT !! just take your loss and go buy another stock ..get off of here ...
Will UA go up
Really odd - the ANALysts worked together and there are no rules now
Prepare for dilution!

TRXC FDA APPROVED. HUGE POTENTIAL FOLKS. I never invest in clothing industry
unbelievable. it was such a promising company
The Rockdelta shoes is selling out fast
Under armor is the biggest lower ripping people off for years now it’s payback time
what's the difference btw UA and UAA? Which one should I choose?
"Can't beat Wall Street at its own game. They have been heavily sorting this stock for awhile now. Company is still growing and making money. Hopefully, the company can find another growth engine. Until then, the shorts are in full control."
UAA reached a 52 Week low at 11.69
"When the CEO decided that he needed more control and made different classes of shares, that was my clue to get out. He didn't want any extra input."
i love their running clothes though ... pretty much i bot every running gears from them (not shoes yet) - I don't like Nike or Addidas
"I'm not really into technical analysis, but it seems like every time this thing gets around $22.00, it either stops, or pulls back ?"
"Big Question is where does this open at tomorrow? EBTI said to drop 38% in 2017 so this is far from over,expect another 15% drop to at least around 16.34 then overshoot lower as the shorts are in control to low $14's."
Next resistance at 29.09. Still just a 10B company...
Too expensive!!
"UA Down again today ..... All indices are up .7% ... Europe and Asia were up 1.1%UA has lots of Administrative / Distribution problems to go with Poor Quality, Terrible Fit and Out Dated Designs.No positive news for UA in the near future ...... Sell Now .... Buy it back when it bottoms at $13Get out now .... Don't be a Bag Holder"
Why up so much today?
And the shoes after such a succes with ghe hovr onlu up 1 or 3% is a joke to me
think we see 16's next week? looking to reduce my cost basis of 18.55
UAA reached a 52 Week low at 8.00

Adidas CEO's comments appear to have helped UA's share price today. More than our CEO has done to help!
And how about the shady guidance going forward? At least you won't get sunburned!

"Every dog has it's day, but this dog's turn hasn't come yet."
"At its root, Under Armour is a corny company. I've commented on this before but their ad campaigns are corny and the company itself feels like an old person trying to fit in with the young crowd. Whomever came up with the ad campaign of, ""Protect This House"" and ""The Only Way is Through"" doesn't have any feel for the attitude of the young demographic and their corny campaigns have doomed the brand. That said, I'd buy some UA in the 3.20 range. However, I wouldn't buy a single share above that price."
I am in Jackson hole vacationing with my family. I was shocked to see under armor in many of the stores with hats shirts sweatshirts there was no sign of any other athletic manufacture. Their stuff was the most expensive but the highest quality. I don’t think I’ve seen location Branded material like that. I talked to the owner of the store and he said they were doing a much better job. It’s not just about sneakers

"The leadership is so bad. The stated strategy is so off the mark (and this is the strategy over the last 3 years, for the record, so nothing to do with Covid). Their product has been and continues to be off trend. And the brand is not cool (see SNL Middle Age Mutant Ninja Turtle animation). Not sure how anyone thought this recipe would work...get out and take the loss.."

"I don't believe the sunshine pumpers nor the doomsday people. The real answer is somewhere in the middle. What do the rational folks think? Buy below $12? Average cost down to $10? I think there's an entry point here somewhere, just not sure where."
Hurray
Short interests building up
UAA is up 8.44% to 8.74
"Terrible management ,, expecting it to tank today , another 8-10% down"
"What you look for is these ""green shoots"" signs that things maybe stabilizing/ turning around. Management refocus, some really good hires, focus on global execution, revenue stabilizing, etc.. This is hopefully a slight change in stock perception also where people take a look. This is the first quarter in a while where there is some positives (intl Rev). Now as they continue to execute, earnings will recover and the the high p/e of today looks cheap. Thats why you buy stocks when they are out of favor. I actually see some real positives in strategy, products and focus. Many of the people who bash daily and just cant even fathom anything positive will flip or disappear when the stock recovers. Just my perspective"
What's the difference between being deeply in debt and and having bloated unsold inventories?
i see more superdry than under armor in my country. superdry 300M #$%$
"until now, I am quite satisfied with its products, much better than nike's"
Accumulating more shares here.Even CROX was able to rebound from the single digits with their turnaround efforts.Under Armour is way better. Buy and hold. 5 years from now you'll be smiling.
Data breach going down
Gee the price keeps falling. It must be the Curry influence. LOL
Needs to get down to $5 for it to be a buy...probably within next 2 weeks or so...Nice job BOD....and your boy Frisk and his pals...getting it ready for that sale...
This stock will be $5 after earnings watch them short the hell out of it some more it will happen watch
Now it is a buy!
LOLhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-climbs-earnings-top-estimates-212414023.html

"Hang on, elevator............. goin down"
"Three color ways have sold out for the new UA HOVR shoes, the new released curry golds that were releaseed on Friday are almost sold out as well, the low top curry reds are sold out. Also something that UA was not doing well in the past was selling to women and that looks like its changing as well. The HOVR shoes are selling very well for women. The days of Under Armour making bad shoes are long gone."

Cramer is a stock manipulation master! Do the opposite of what he says to make money.
"Maybe next year they should skip the investor update, lol"
"Why isn't there any merger talk? this is still a strong brand. I go to the gym and I see a lot of people wearing UA sneakers. where is Adidas? How about Lululemon? They have the female side, UA can have the male side if you will."
Lol right down 3% now see it move up in a hour or so to up 2%
UAA - THE GREAT MASK. So what do you have to hide? DUH
"Looks like UA can not keep up with the demand for online sneaker orders , especially this new hovr cushion models. Earnings will go up up up for next 3 to 5 years! Keep complaining you loser Nike lovers! UA, Protect this House!!!"
Anonymous - I think you are wrong and hate speech against the CEO is not productive IMHO. He just needs to realize the premium on UA goods is no longer justified and SGA needs to be seriously reduced. Until then its single digits with no near term inflection point. Again IMHO
"my son wears UA & nike only, so do all his friends. UA is the cooler of the 2 to be wearing."
Sell before too late
"Really ugly Q1. Revenue fell 23% to $930 million, though approximately 15 percentage points of the decline was due to “pandemic impacts”... So management estimates that revenue would have been down 8% even without the pandemic!!! That is scary for a brand navigating the crisis. Back of the envelope gives fair value around $2.5 B which is about $5.30/shr."
"Was in an athletic store this past weekend, and they said they’ve sent back over 200 UA items, bc they aren’t selling."
it's worth $11 a share
Might UA be bought? I read that Lindsey Vonn etc. got a lot of shares
Starting to feel way oversold. Lululemon valued ~5 times larger than UA with half the revenue? Doesn’t make a lot of sense to me. I get that LULU is growing a lot faster but I expect a UA pivot into more athleisure. The brand still super strong too IMO - mgmt needs some inspiration though.I plan on waiting for the trend to reverse to pick up shares. This could go lower.
Why is this down over $2 premarket?
Cut F/w Guidance in half... Holly #$%$.. Sell!
The CEO insulting his American customers who voted for trump (63 million of them) is NOT a good idea. Planck should resign or the Board should fire him before the stock drops to zero.
well again I thought this might rally when it got to 23. now at 16. was I wromg. yes way wrong.

"this is comical to watch. US closed Friday near a 5 day low. The trend every day nearly since the big pop is opening bell buying by people hoping for a better story only to see US sold off at closing bell. Us on upgrades an a bullish CEO call hovers at the low end of the pop, never rising higher."
Hey Mike they beat revenue forecast by almost 80 Million and hit their projected EPS forecast. Those are two most important fundamental metrics a company is graded on. go pound sand your #$%$

Everyone makes everything about politics . Why ... the left are a bunch of snowflake cry babies. They are sore crooked losers
The UA HOVR shoes are almost sold out in red and white. Black is almost sold out as well.

"Under Armour was the top gainer in the S&P 500 Index (SPY) following a bullish note from Stifel analyst Jim Duffy. Duffy said, “Recent discussions with Under Armour leave us highly encouraged by leadership commitments to profitability improvement,” wrote Duffy. The S&P 500 Index rose by 12.25 points or 0.44% to 2,746 yesterday."
"My guess is that UA is due for a pullback in the short-run. check out awe-someSTOCKS, its a pretty reliable service. of course you have to do your own due diligence, but they generally point you in the right direction."
"DOWNGRADE COMING ANYTIME NOW CRASHINGBELOW $9 ,Q4 NUMBERS PROBABLY WON;T BE THAT GOOD EITHER"
"Someone told me before I sold last week that Under Armor reminded him about another long ago athletic wear company called ""LA Gear"". Does anyone know what he meant?"
"This company definitely has potential to come back. I'm not counting it out, and I don't think anyone else should either."
"Hope you get it, the stock must go up do not short here"
Stevo ...UPM is a shorter ...he is still on here lol
Stock is just going to ZERO. You can see......stock has a short interest of something like 50%. Everyone believes the equity is worthless.WHERE ARE ALL THOSE GODDAM PUMPERS TODAY WHO PUSHED THIS DOG SHEET STOCK ONTO ALL THE UNSUSPECTING BUYERS IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS? WHERE ARE YOU SONS OF #$%$ TODAY??????I own 400 shares bought at $32. Just the most horrible stock ever invented. I guess I will look to sell for tax losses by year end. Just imagine how much lower this POS will go when many of us are all doing the same thing.I CAN SEE THIS POS IN THE SINGLE DIGITS VERY SOON......MAYBE EVEN $5.KEVIN PLANK SHOULD BE SHOT.
Zucks is bad mouthing this stock. Again
If kevin plank resigned it may hit 20 again
Does anyone actually wear under armour?

"DickyD and the rest of the crew just mad they've lost money on UA, just like SNAP investors. Seriously, the company is going nowhere. I don't know what virtual reality headset you're wearing but no one wears UA. From a financial standpoint, it's way overvalued and they are in a weaker position to outspend competition."
"Buyout rumors!! Apollo is in advanced talks to buy company, possibly next week. 11+ billion"
UAA is up 19.30% to $21.70
Goes UP goes DOWN why?? nobody knows
I lost everything I had on this #$%$ I want all of us to sue #$%$ Plank the arrogant #$%$

Looks to be back on the upswing. Good time to buy more here. Could close over $20 today. Not many stocks on sale. However this one of them.

missing out on the mlb is a huge deal. i think sell for 2 days then get back in.
Any update for UA?
"So much for the relief rally as 50% of the USA is now going to Boycott UA thanks to Kevin Planks comments calling Trump Passionate, The comments received criticism across social media from those who don't support Trump. Some activists are vowing to boycott Baltimore-based Under Armour,that also leaves the door open to athletes who don't like Trump also to Boycott UA,also entire sports teams who didn't endorse Trump to Boycott UA,Wow! Kev really put his foot in it and timing Wow! See I told ya this was gonna get even better!"

Cramer said buy?????????????????????????
"If you have owned this as long as I have, you aren't losing your money. I have owned for both splits with a cost basis of $6 and I don't plan to sell. I was at a basketball game last night where both teams were wearing UA stuff and I was wearing a UA stuff. The brand is a great one."
"holiday season just around the corner, this will do well"
I was in China 3 years ago. No UA lots of Nike. Why?

"Why is UA Stock going down ???? ...... The question is all over this board ..... Here's Why !!!The average UA consumers are 45 - 50 Year old manles seeking their glory days.You can see them everywhere sporting their Neon Green Running Shorts, Compression Tee's and Matching Green Sparkly Hoodie covering too many trips to the Buffet but proudly displaying that Huge UA Logo .... They look silly and that's why the 18 - 24 year old demographic won't wear UA.It only gets worse from here .... I've been telling everyone to Sell Now and Buy back in Q3 2018 when it will sell for $10 and wait for the Buy Out..... Sell now .... Don't be a Bag Holder."
"Gotta get out, takin my profits........ hearing back to $18 soon"
Might be a buyer when PE gets under 20! Until then just watch the slide!
"To all the ""GET OUT NOW"" and ""DON'T GET LEFT HOLDING THE BAG"" and all the posts that use ""..."" instead of commas like normal people:These are the Shorts actively pursuing a price drop. What an act, feigning to care about anyone else's brokerage accounts besides their own - which, by the way, is NORMAL to only care about your own but this pretend game is getting old and ugly - they are solely posting for the sake of making their short positions profitable. You don't see Longs on here getting all up in arms and spouting ""GET ONBOARD NOW BEFORE THIS SHIP SAILS"" or ""DO NOT SHORT THIS STOCK YOU WILL BE SORRY,"" no, you see reasonably minded (though sometimes maybe a little too eccentric *cough* Caleb *cough*) and logic-rooted comments about UA's future outlook, globalization, turnaround, etc.Anyone Longs on here reading this post - don't fret, the ridiculous and obnoxious ""...""-peppered rantings of these hyenas will wear off soon enough. As for you Shorts, try out growth investing for a change - I promise it's a lot less work than having to pretend like the world is burning down around everyone all the time. Also, holy #$%$ you are annoying!"
"This is just the SEC turning up the heat on Plank and Bergman. My guess is they tried to settle and Plank/Bergman refused the terms or could not come to a deal with what the SEC proposed.So, SEC starts to press the screws to them a bit to try and get them to accept the terms. If either agree to any type of fraud (irregardless if the settlement has any jail time attached, which would be unlikely), neither Plank or Bergman could ever work as an officer for a publicly traded company or sit on any Board again. They would be toast. So, a lot of reasons why to try and fight this til the end...they don't have a better option."
"UAA simply needs new designers. The apparel is not appealing whatsoever. Not surprised, their sales suck"

"New President of NA, and an upgrade from Bernstein.. good signs"
green by end of the Day
"Sports and politics do not mix period. Some athletes have made ton of money promoting products like UA, NIKE, KO, PEP, etc. and they never complain before signing the contract. My suggestion to all those athletes is please support the needy families and children that need school supplies, shoes, and some food. When it comes to pitch in their own money from big athletes they say ""I will support fund raising and I will contribute few dollars (lol, lol,lol)"". So, it's the public that contributes all the fundraising and these athletes and organizations take the credit. Folks, these athletes make money and they only do lip service when it comes to charity or BLM revolution. Don't be fooled by these athletes."
From a consumers point of view. I always thought of under armour as a gimmick brand but brought some socks on a tjmaxx deal best winter socks I've ever bought. Went to the website to buy more and let down only to find hockey socks this company looks like its headed for receivership
"Foot locker beat and upgraded, #$%$ sporting goods was up 20% on a beat and upgrade, Macy's up, Tiffany's up, the consumer sector is strong and getting stronger."
go to the top
This is headed down.
love their products but giving up on the stock
I like the fact that total cash increased from $1.01b to $1.52b stock price should trade much much higher
Market Cap. of Nike is 92.8B vs. UA at 16.7B. Nike's cap. is a little more than 5.5 times that of UA. Will UA continue to grow and close the gap with Nike?
I'll keep this simple. BUY Under Armour right here. She' going A LOT higher.

what do you think with the coming earning ?

Analysts lack all credibility. Get their information out of comic books.
I want proof Trump graduated from the 6th grade. He asked if Fredrick Douglass will be attending the Black Caucus Meeting.
We've got another idiot short on this board and his name is Cody.
Why does everyone hate this stock it’s worth at least double from here. Wake up
Great opportunity to buy while it's low.
ERP and inventory problems key. North America sales key while international sales are the focus. The theme for this quarter is bottom line.
so glad I sold this POS stock
So much for releasing earnings. Sad truth is that nobody believes that they're truly earnings. May the old CEO rest in peace. HA!HA!HA!
"Just looked at that 52 wk high, yikes, sorry to any longs...what happened? Anyone buying at these levels?"
"UA has 2 teams in Final Four, Masters next week and Harper on fire. Hopefully they have plans to take advantage of all that spending they did to get they did in sports and do some great marketing. All I have seen is a lot of product marketing so far in Q1 beyond Lindsay Vonn (who is retired and just had surgery) and the Rock."
"So a few months ago, I ordered some golf pants. Got them in the mail, and they were too long. Apparently UA golf pants run a bit long. So I mailed them back and went to the UA store to try on and buy new golf pants. After seeing that I had yet to be refunded, I called UA to ask the status. They apologized for the delay, even though it was still within the 10 days since they received the pants. Not only were they very nice and helpful, they sent me a 20% off code for my next purchase. Was surprised by the great customer service.Also, their golf pants are so comfortable. I wear them as dress pants for work, as they look like dress pants, but I don't get hot on these summer days, and they are much more comfortable than any other actual dress pants I have purchase."
Kendrick Carmouche (Kentucky Derby jockey and the only African American jockey since...2013). He loves wearing Under Armour. Great spotlight for the company. Any Kentucky Derby wagers here? $UA
UA is up 9.14% to 9.43
"What was Plank thinking? What was he hoping to gain by publicly supporting Trump? Trump is a pariah. Plank, I'm drawing a blank."
UA is still my favorite running brand
"Under Armour accused of demeaning corporate cultureNov. 5, 2018 4:27 PM ET|About: Under Armour, Inc. Class C (UA)|By: Clark Schultz, SA News Editor Under Armour (UA, UAA) is the target of a Wall Street Journal expose on some of the practices of top male executives found to be demeaning to women at the company.The WSJ reports that top male executives allegedly violated corporating policy in various ways, including inappropriate behavoir and corporate event invites to females based on attractiveness.UA response: ""We believe that there is systemic inequality in the global workplace and we will embrace this moment to accelerate the ongoing meaningful cultural transformation that is already under way at Under Armour. We can and will do better."""
"Im not a short seller i just lost confidence after today. No profits margins down inventory up, dead share"
Boommm... Finally some good news. Here comes $25
what time's the ER?
"It's time to sell the company to another firm. Now is the best time to do so. The co has the stores, employees and products. It needs a helping hand to be run better. let's see management step up."
Motley Fools sweating this one out so much they post false news articles like their legit!

"sheesh, UA Kevin Plank said a 57 year woman who is a seamstress, has no ability to be retrained into another job! well I am a 57 year old woman who has left a long time career in computer science and has been retrained as a tax professional. what an offensive statement. will not be investing in UA any longer."

This stock is a scam and the pumping up of it is a scam.
"After taking huge losses all the way from $50 is to $16 range and closing my position, I re entered today with a small position. After reading several analysis, I believe management had learnt their mistakes and are steering the ship in the right direction. This quarter may not be the greatest quarter, but any indication that they are making progress will help. Good luck."
"Anytime the Dow is up big, UA is down. I have always found that surprising. I wonder why that happens."
"UA will have a great qtr. but forward guidance will push stock into the $33-$35 range before sept. 1st. after that in the fall hedge l funds and mutual funds will stat dumping NIKE as it appears mgmt. has lost their minds and start moving into UA, so simply UA is a great long and short term BUY, i'm buying all I can the last few weeks before EPS , also you'll probably see TIAA money mgrs. as buyers this week"

Another lawsuit What’s going on
Back at this board
morons are selling ... with the shorts. sooner or later
why is it down 2% in pre-market ?
Rising with good volume. Looking for breakout at 20.69 for a run up to 24.17.
"Have you ever seen a real-life land whale before? google Sam Poser the ""financial analyst"" that has been dogging this stock the past 6 months (Mike looks just like him as well).This dude literally wears 4XL and thats probably why he hates UA so much. Because UA doesn't accommodate for size. This dude should not be giving advise on fashion and what people are wearing and what they are not. This dude should be analyzing Mcdonalds or Burger King stock."
why this stock is tanking?
Tom Brady was already on UA spokesman payroll before this win. UAA (and UA) should be up on the bowl victory.
Down on bad news as usual. So sick of UAA.
"margin is horrible, too much inventory"
"Price target $16, headed there........."
when all the comments for a stock go one way and the price action isn't following a top or bottom is likely in
2.5 year old probe. Improving margins and improving sales. seems to me as a huge buying opportunity.
"That was signs of a real turnaround, very good report"
"Big disappointment, with what I have been seeing on the street in the way of more UA wear, I would have thought UA would blow the revenue numbers away. I was wrong."
"this quarter i would expect sales to beup due to baseball season and i beleive they signed a deal to provide mlb jersey to teams next season. UA has a large preesence in baseball from little league to the majors along with their other business, I would have expected this to be the best q of the year"

Ua has a solid base can only go up from here . Shorts better have covered. The dip last week shows the base is strong . 18 soon
UA is up 7.01% to 15.72
Held the stock for 10 years. Should have invested in $LULU instead.
"Goto Vancouversun.com to see a pic if a bus shelter ad in Vancouver by the founder of LULU that said (to LULU BOD) to buy UAA now. LULU has $1B in cash & no debt; whereas UAA is now weak, junk bond debt, too much inventory & technology purchases they cannot monetize.The ad goes onto say...''Buy Under Armour & bring it our original culture & money-making business model'' !Must have been a slow business day for Chip Wilson."
Just a dollar off no reason just off....
Up big after hours....
Under Armour Is Upgraded to Buy at Citigroup
Back up the truck at 6.60. What a gift
"Listen up girls. 5 years from now UAA will be much, much higher."
"$14.'s next get ready! like I said this will look like jcp very soon,single digits on the horizon folks!"
"The fundamentals are just awful. The stock went on a run due to the entire retail sector carrying it. Don't be surprised to see this settle in the low teens. It's sitting at a 70 forward PE, with no growth and no profit this year. Be cautious. I have no position either so do cry short to me."
Under Armour has flown under the radar for years. Gear is looking good.. more stylish than ever. Rebuilt structure to become more profitable. Making lots of smart decisions. Much stronger and smarter now than pre-pandemic. 40+ stock in 2022.
what bad news came out today?
"i am curious why buy UA at 60x earnings with no real strategy or competitive edge going forward, if you could buy Capri at 5x or Tapestry at 12x earnings ? record low valuations, and much more stable and profitable businesses"
Sold all my Nike and bring my shares to UA in the AM..
bought 1000 going to 20
BK in 6 months!! Sell now!!

17.2x next if it continues to move higher today
I'm going to go to Kohl's today and buy a marked down UA T-shirt just to show how mad I am at Nike
Not too many thumbs down here. Lotta PO shareholders. Doesn't he realize business is business and we're from both sides of the fence. Maybe he'll join Kaepernick on the unemployment line.
if you are not buying you may regret it later if you buy and it falls more dont sweat it buy some more this is going to be a home run investment just like nike go long
"Post earnings, still don't see a lot of energy around the brand as the youth move away from it. Feels much more like a commodity than an inspirational brand that kids will ask Mom to get for xmas. Most likely a strategic decision to move away from team sports (youth) into the running/training space. Still don't buy it. Feels like a business that is being designed to just be ho-hum/me-too type product based business. Little growth and no dividend only make it worth watching for me."
"You know it is a PoS, dog of a stock, when hardly anyone ever shows-up to #$%$ anymore.Wake me up when it drops to $13-14"
This needs to test $20 before going up again.
Did UAA get an upgrade today?
"Here we go, end of day sell off"
"Does the Motley Fool really matter? Does anyone care about anything they say? The short answer is, No."
"They should stay in the University market like the ND one, and add many more - let Nike and Adidas pay the pro athletes. Watching this stock but not in it yet. Expect to start accumulating soon. They have good products. This whole shoe and clothing apparel business is going through a down period but should recover fairly soon. I think if you have a 2 year investment window, you can make some real money here. UA is also attractive enough right now to be bought out by private equity. Interesting company even if it looks speculative now."
Plank the left wants to know if you can buy ua with food stamps
LULU went through the same thing. They have a good product and they are moving right along. Nothing goes straight up. I own some of both LULU and UA. I bought UA after the haircut. They'll be fine. LTH
"A serious runner always wears UA ... nothing else. Simple as that, as for sneakers, runners are not wearing nike or addi either, they wear Asics"

UA a failing brand. End of story.

Analysts are only saying it won't be good so they can pick up cheap shares for themselves. BUY!
"Unscientific observation: I was at the ballfields all weekend for a baseball tournament, and UA was seen a lot more than Nike or Adidas Same at the gym. I don't know what the margins these items are being sold at, but visibility is definitely increasing"
UAA is down 16.22% to 22.99
WELL BACK BELOW $12 AGAIN LIKE LAST YEAR NUMBERS ARE BAD THEN CRASHCRASH CRASH AND KEPT ON CRASHINGBELOW $12 NO DIFFERENTTHIS TIME BEVERY VERY AFRAID TO LOSSS ALOTLOTLOT MORE MONEY
UA = Under Average
Under Armour has a goofy looking obnoxious logo to begin with. They need to design a logo which appeals to casual sports wear people as well as athletes.
"My two sons and i visited our local UA outlet on Memorial Day around 11:30am. Store was super busy. Five cashiers ringing, with a line of 10+ people."
Oh look another sell off
If some of the socially conscious Nike crowd knew that Nike uses slave labor how many might move over to UA. A small percentage could add a billion plus to UA revs.
When are UA earnings coming??
now going up to sky . Easy money
Going higher just watch
I’ve been in their stores and I’m not surprised. The product is not up to snuff with their competitors. The service in stores is lacking. The biggest issue for me personally is the fabric used on their half zips.....it used to be a great blend and now they are basically sheer....I won’t buy them anymore and every time I go into a store I let them know that they have lost my business until they improve them.
"Why sell at 20 when it will hit 50 you moronovic, that is morin in serbian"
My only hope now is Plank completely separated himself from politics and taking any type of social stance on anything. He is running a multi-billion dollar company. What is he thinking! He really #$%$ off conservatives now. Not a great way to get the sales back up to the growth in the recent past.
"forth quarter numbers will be worst and 2018 won'tget better ,this will crash crashhbelow $3 in 2018"
"This company is dealing now with low margin commodity goods. Another 1 point down means the beginning of another 20% (5 points) decline. Earnings release are on January 26, 2017, if they are better than expected, the slide down could reverse."

can you remember K-swiss? same story as Under Arnor
UA is going up again.... This time up to $16
Trend is up and currently consolidating. Najarian is pumping and this board is quiet. Seems like a buy here.
need this to go up another $1 and want to bow out
Citibank maintains its “buy” rating! 
I’ll buy back in around $16
lol nice I’ll sell at $24
Company is in Baltimore. Why wouldn’t you expect fraud? I watched The Wire.
The earning expectation has been so low
What is going on with UA??
I’m boycotting all those ace wipes . Die ua die nfl die nba got china
"The $12 target from BOA is on UAA, not UA"
Why does this “UA” lag so far behind “UAA”?
Why is this up
Is is based in Baltimore?
MF obviously is short. Follow the fools and go bankrupt.
"analysts and their opinions are like #$%$, everyone has one. just too much negative opinions out there"
Who is going to jail for cooking the books ??????
Bounce back very fast! Accumulate here!
Can Plank take the company private again? Is that really a possibility? Has any other major company ever done that before?
if ER is poor ... to $10
"I don't like their debt. For that reason, I will never buy UAA."
"I thought about it for a few days and my family and I've finally concluded that we will no longer fly UA. Although I and my family have built so many mileages in our frequently flyer account, but this behavior by UA is well worth forfeiting those miles and select other carriers. Flying minimum once a month domestically and once every 2-3 months internationally, it could very well happen to me as well and not worth taking a risk. Other airlines have much better business and first class seats anyways. Time to go shopping....."
This will be the biggest benefactor of Nike's beat down
Kevin Plank needs to shut and listen. I couldn't take his incesant talking on CNBC and had to turn the TV off! I couldn't imagine being an employee in a meeting with this guy.
UA has no Soccer STAR wearing its shoe...Worldcup Soccer is 35 days away and I don't see Under Armour anywhere.....
hopefully it closes around 21.6 if not 21.9-22 todaybreakout takes it to 23.5 immediately once it's over 22 -upgrade is coming to get us there.
Patrick Frisk bought half million dollar worth of shares b/c he knows someone going to buy the company...just like I predicted
Got in at 7.09 a few months back
Good lord
Buy the next dip
Tiger winning and Jordan (or anyone else) in sight is such the storyline for these 2 brands right now. UA's brand is so down right now and getting no help from the athletes they sponsor. Frisk isn't a brand guy; so doubt he cares much. Biz will be run better ie profits; just very little growth and lack of impactful marketing reflects that. Will be interested to see Q1 results. Just such little energy from this brand right now. Really amazing to see the downward spiral of a once great brand.
"Really tempted to pull the trigger on this. High school football and college football are playing in many parts of the country. It certainly won't be firing on all cylinders, but it'll help. UAA really needs sports with no restrictions back, which probably won't happen until spring/fall of 2021."
This just in: Kevin Spacey issues a strong buy on Under Armour!
We should be seeing 20 very soon !! The momentum is back !! The space suit another catalyst that should propel the status symbol of UA branding!!! Booooom!!
Why doesn't UA make clothes for fat people like me? Don't they needed the most?
I am very glad UAA is ending their deal with Berkley. It was an embarrassment to see the UAA logo on the leftist uniforms.
out of fashion ... that is the key thing. It is hard to get back before going under
Cant have any fun
LULU should buy UA and sell the product lines exclusively in Lululemon stores.
WAYYYYYYYYYYY Overvalued!!
NEVER....EVER....NEVER....EVER trust a fat old analyst giving downgrades and advise on fashion. I'm looking at you fatty Sam Poser!
Brought my buy price down from $22 to $11. Gotta love when things are on sale. Now ready for big profits here
What is the big deal about this whole kapernick thing? Might benefit...might not...UA has to compete with attractive product...not off controversies.
What makes anyone think this brand is going to die?
Revenue
Uaa is killing me
I hate to invest in clothing industry. It make no sense
if higher than 19.5 by Friday my covered calls will be assigned. otherwise will do same for next week.
Keep shorting so you can cover at 17 or 18 this week. Lol.
I think i need to work for jnder armour to make sure this share goes up quicker
"Today target is 23.80 and close below 23.30 , If the Market not Red"
This is bottom for sure ! Stack up
HERE COME THE SCARYSCARY CRASH CRASH BACK BELOW $12 beveryvery afraid to loss alotlot more money
"We (USA) can't go to Europe to shop, they won't let us in, the virus you know...."
"Nice write up in Barron’s, let’s see what happens tomorrow."
There’s blood here so I’m buying!!!!
"Notes from the streetPersonally, I'd probably pay 20 times next year's earnings for Under Armour, which would put the stock in the $8.50 range. That's another 50% haircut from current levels, and it also is based on current 2018 consensus earnings estimates of 43 cents a share, which may be cut. I'm not sure the stock will reach those levels, but for now it's in stock purgatory -- not a growth story, and not a value story."
There is still over $1 billion on debt that Plank has got to cover. I believe that he is outnumbered.
Grab as much as I can after I dumped it around $15.7 last time
The new HOVRs that were released today are almost all sold out!!! Within 24 hrs folks! Ua is changing the shoe game and stealing market share from Nike and Adidas
"Not yet, but this will soon be a nice buy. I suspect it is near it's bottom, but hard to say. Patience"
look for the wash out. Will end the day up from here.
"SPACEMAN PLANK, not a peep, shareholders we'll have our time with proxy statements"
Back up the truck if it drops under $36.50!
Came so close to pulling the trigger on buying this. Cramer says he would be a buyer at $17. He has an army of people who make big money doing the opposite of whatever he recommends. Pulling for you Frankie
"Jonathon, if analysts were to upgrade Under wAAre to ten brazillion dollars a share, would you protest, Jonathon? Would you cry foul? Would you condemn these analysts for unfairly overestimating the value of the Under wAAre company?"
"UA just needs to run a TV commercial with an American flag, and then sales will spike up. They need to run it this weekend."
"Shorts are going to get crushed on this one.. If UAA numbers are even the slightest bit better than expected it's going to blast off. Shortheads will rush to cover as UAA helps itself by buybacks after report. No money to be made on the downside here, this company has been taken out to the woodshed already !!!!!"
Too much negative sentiment right now. Gonna rocket ship tomorrow.
UnderArmour ain't going away boys. Give them time. Don't listen to the fat analysts. Take advantage of the dip.
cnbc just talked about UA and mentioned that it is a company with alot off potential and despite the thing about pulling forward sales wich they tought the stock is undervalued.
"I have no position, but this bounce is absurd. Barely beat Revenue, in-line on EPS. Guidance for 2018 was bad. Read the surveys: The kids/tweens/millennials DO NOT think this brand is cool anymore! It will fall back to 14 faster than it will rise to 20. No mans land for this stock for awhile."
I used to hold under Armour but sold after I walked into the mall and to their store and me and my brother were in the store awkwardly walking around because it was just me and him and the employees
Prepare for $10.00!
I see a dividend coming soon before the run up to a market cap of $25 Billion where it should be
This will pop like a rocker. Kids need a new idol mentorand Curry is it. I’d be buying this cheap stock up and retire maybe a bit earlier players ? !
"How does selling at Kohl's kill the brand?Nike, Adidas, and Puma are all parked on the racks right next to the UA in all the same stores."
a lot of places are running out ua supplies why?
Summertime is the sports season. So UA will have no shortage of customers in the coming months. Great opportunity to grow overseas.
Rolled the dice and got lucky. Bought a few weeks ago at around $19. Up 10%. A nice steady climb to $30 would be sweet.
UA getting killed today. SHorts are at it yet again.
"Macys' collection of UA clothes are limited and scrambled on the ground, not many choices."
Why isn't UA going up? The market had a good day in spite of Facebook. Maybe it's the Curry hype.
"So if google knows everything you do, it is not hard for the Mafia to know every shr you hold"
"The word is out, UAA to be acquired by Adidas. Adidas down UAA up. NKE down too. It's an Adidas vs. Nike world coming soon to a sporting goods store near you !"
KEVIN couldn't manage a hot dog stand
You can tell Kevin Plank that I've bought my LAST Under Armour gear. People know me that's pretty much all I wear.
This new Yahoo format is terrible. Bring back the old one.
Is UA a white people brand?
MCD biggest story of the day till UAA says hold my beer...
What's going on in after hours? Yahoo says it's up .01 and stock tracker says up .92
"Complete and total cowardice and cluelessness to be selling at these levels. Below $31? LOL! Run lemmings.... and ""invest' in something you understand like CDs or savings accounts. Cowards!"
"If the feds can’t figure it out while they are cooperating over 2.5 years from first inquiry, it’s a nothing burger. Guarantee a big beat and this news out today to temper the rise...let’s rock UA! And if they did fudge the numbers in the end,‘there’s a good chance they will again for tomorrow’s earnings, lol! Better to be a long here ;)"
"This is a least $80 stock, cheap cheap"
Short squeeze will send it to $15.00 tomorrow with new announcement.
Either all the commentors are named John or John needs to take a serious break before his hand falls off !!!!!!
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UA?p=UA - what a joke that investorplace.
"Do you know the hovr, curry 4 basketbal and rock collection are sold out almost everywhere. First quarter numbers will be way better as previous year so will go up up up"
Just got done reading an article about buying Under Armour on the dip. Looks like its perfect timing for a buy opportunity.
Things seem to be getting overextended for UAA. Ive been struggling with this stock lately. Some of my other trades have been from awesomeSTO-CKS which are working out pretty well.
Buy and hold! It was a shake down just few days on the behest of some short sellers. These analysts are taking money under the table.
"The investor day slides look more like a motivational promotion, and less like a business plan. I'm sure some analysts were disappointed in the presentation as much as I am. Let's just hope some new products get launched, and Plank stops stepping on his own #$%$.."
I think $15 tomorrow.
Under Armour is the next Members Only. Bye bye UA.
UAA is up 4.90% to 19.68
When UA is back near $13-14 then I'd consider buying..
UAA is down 5.27% to 17.98
To funny article by the Fool..they missed the spike spo wanted to bring it back down..look out now this thing may go on a tear
"UA has made huge inroads into the demographics that matter. Good luck telling your kid you won't spend $45 on thebasketball compression pants he wants. Mine wouldn't be caught in others. Yeah - shoes have not been great. It's a tough market. Cleats and other areas are paying off. This is a winning company that lost a bit of its focus. It is not a disaster. They have not missed cycles. They will be back on the rise or management will just say Thank you to Wall Street, get private equity backers and go private like Dell and other smart CEO founders."
maybe plank should get tom brady a board seat and 10% ownership. get a winner on the board
Get out
"green, looks like a nice day. I keep my positions and loading on the drops. this has good upside potential"
"I still wear UA when Nike’s in the wash, but it’s 2-3 years old. Won’t be buying any new even at 1/2 $$ price!!"
UA recording sales before delivery. Serious no no! Stay away from this stock!
wow UA
"Lol........This is how UA gets rich, at the expense of their loyal investors......"
will be 22 by tomorrow
Nice time to short!!!
I bought 5000 shares @ 42.20 with my wife's IRA What do I do?
"Incoming 2-year-old recycled article from Mike coming in 3,2,1"
So yesterday UA closes red on heaviest volume in awhile after opening hogarth as it has every day. Macy got clocked yesterday and JCP today. Amazon in the crapper and global and US data continues to show weakness getting waker but UA inv think UA will survuve it all. The daily sell offs from afternoon into closing bell tell you what smarter money is doing. Just my opinion I know you have your own reasons to be long. Still short for something deeper into the gap up it had a few weeks ago
"WHAT A POS STOCK. THAT'S ABOUT ALL I HAVE TO SAY TODAY.OH, WAIT. HOW ABOUT KEVIN PLANK COMING OUT TODAY AND DEFEND TRUMP FROM IMPEACHMENT. CAN WE HAVE THAT TODAY?LOL - BROKEN STOCK, BROKEN COMPANY, AND BROKE#$%$ CEO."
Plank needs to come out apologizing
"CEO Kevin Plank opened a private investment firm, Plank Industries, in 2017. Analysts worry that he is more interested in whiskey-distilling and racehorse-breeding than in fixing Under Armour’s flagging operation. - The guy is playing fire"
"Damn this is a shame. UA trading at $16-17. What happened to all of the Nike protest warriors who said they dumped NKE shares and went and got UA??? Lies. Anyhow, honestly I really did own UA a when it was trading in the $40s...glad I dumped."
"Ua is not going anywhere but up, Nike and the Germans are going to loose share from this point forward"
"The 'ole boys cheated on their expense accounts. Apparently liked entertaining but added a couple of 'zeros' to the amount. They liked that expense account for that extra dough. It was their COOKIE JAR! Oh, yeah. Hope they 'pocked enough' to last them a while as they are now OUT OF WORK! FIRED, in other words."
Plank is hard up for money. He sold all the data to Cambridge Analytica.
Hope is not a strategy.
Is UA product apparel design awful or what? I honestly can't find anything I would wear on their site. The sneakers are cool but apparel needs a complete overhaul.
You lose so much money but stock price goes up?
in@12.46 a lot !
Nike did well and so should as well.We test 52 week tomorrow if not break it... as long as mkt is ok
You longs need to sell now UA wont make this down turn. Sorry for your loss
"Doing my channel checks.I found that Portland/Oregon officials are incensed that federal agents are ""invading Nike country using tactical gear from Under Armour"".How dare they! lol"
SEC should start another investigation into stock manipulation...
"Boy, analysts are really trashing UAA the last few days and this morning. Feels fishy to me. maybe an attempt to drive price down. Did not work yesterday but will see about today"
UGH
The drip drip drip of layoffs continue/ more IT jobs disappeared this week.
Next stop $25. growth is done.
I think Plank needs to go ... too long
UA Special Forces tactical gear is freakin’ incredible.
UAA reached a 52 Week high at 25.21
"the buyers aretraders trying to make a buck, buying because it keeps going up due to the MM""s pushing it up without accumulatingthe MM's buying it back and forth, while selling. More shares sold then bought lately they say (not sure that happens)I guess they mean those sitting on it are selling, insidersshorts coveringstupid people that buy because they use netflix and don't understand it is 10 times too high336 support130 on long term chart"
"This CEO shows he hates the American people, at least 63 million of them who voted for Trump .... that's a bad attitude in my opinion. Bashing your customers is not good leadership. Wait until it drops to 6. Maybe he will apologize to the American people then."
I've been thinking about buying some UA. Went to one of their outlets few weeks ago and was disappointed. I didn't see anything that I wanted to buy. Products that they had sucked. Sneakers only thing I saw that I liked. Maybe just me?
Does any negative person on this board live in the Baltimore area? I’ve heard that Kevin Plank is determined to make Under Amour wildly successful again. I think he’ll be able to do it.
Gross Margin of 45% is HUUUUUGE!
As per CNBC this morning
"Surprising to see the SEC moving forward with enforcement action on a five year old accounting investigation into $UA given everything else that's going on in markets, but they are. Some more details here for anyone interested:https://theheadlinereporter.com/archives/76"
Rooting for South Carolina to win the NCAA tournament... great exposure for UA
"Mr. Plank, buy fitbit."
Apparel makers losing all their dollar an hour workers in Asia. You eventually have to pay the piper for your sins.....
"DLTH stockholders were victims of over expansion, was Pugs to blame? If so UA is in trouble if she cons her way into meaningful power... This from a former DLTH investor that got out in time..."
test 23.5 by end of June - IMO
"No worries, this is going to move up for sure."
"Under Armour, Inc.'s new CEO hard at work in the executive suite."
"Are you kidding me? This stock is dead, hence why they are trying everything they can to still be relevant.https://finance.yahoo.com/m/864ef0cd-bbeb-3a66-a99e-725b017b5bf5/under-armour-partners-with.html"
"That's nice after dropping 30% we'll give you 2% back! Dead Cat Bounce! Share Offering,Dilution coming!"
Any reason this is going up today?
Should SEC step in on the news that Frisk bought shrs?
Analyst rates stock from sell to strong sell today.
"I was unsure if I had made the right move when I bailed on this @ $14.25 on Jan 9, but feel lucky now.Looking to buy again now, maybe see if I can get in below $12."
More exciting news for Under Armour over the week end! Class Action Lawsuit and Boycott!
"a federal classaction suit ,this isdisaster bad bad news ,this just keep on getting worst ,,pretty much almost could garentee could get downgrade anytime time niow this wil crashcrashbelow $14"
What is the difference (other than price) between UAA and UA since they are both NYSE?
"Couldn’t believed 25% pop to -7%, luckily I sold at 11.89 BOOYAH!"
Wow up a whole 40 cents. THERE IS ZERO REASON TO OWN THIS STOCK.
UAA ... up up $35 soon ....
"Omg....... another earnings report coming May 2nd. These are never good, even if they beat estimates......uuughh"
After reading this article I decided to rather focus on LULU: https://www.stockmetrix.net/blog/post/082718/lululemon-warning-signs-stretched-valuation?t=yfzhanb
Last time this happened the next quarter earnings it was up 20% so its part of the game
I'm screwed at 19 Buck a share ...but have no choice but to ride it out..Hero or Zero
Would someone tell Plank to shut up and quit doing interviews? It does the company no good whatsoever. This guy can't do anything right anymore.
Everyday goes up this is getting boring...Yeah NOT
I absolutely love the My Fitness Pal app by Underarmour. I am back to healthy weight using it to count my calories.
"Do you believe rumor or earning is the question....It doesn't seem to want to break above 18.15, so back down is my guess."
"All in the silence of the night, your holdings in UAA will dwindle to 50%. Nothing you can do. Just get ready for some serious pounding."
Timber!
havbe to disagree Bottom is in !!...Christmass around the corner ...20 dollar stock in1 year
5B only? LOL ...
The shorts on this board are some serious tools.
It's going to report stellar quarter and go up 20-25% tomorrow. My option calls will cash in big time tomorrow. Cha ching
