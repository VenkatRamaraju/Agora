"Hearing out of lower Manhattan there is a legitimate bid on the table. Sounds like the issue right now is valuation...debt, cash flow, etc. Typical EBITDA stuff. The ""low 30's"" number is rumor mill. Blackstone and Apollo were talking $28 range. So somewhere between what it is now ($26) and $30-31 is where it will probably land. It will sell...what they do no one else has been able to replicate. What they need is discipline...and a common IT system internally (which is killing them right now)."

They're squabbling on price. Also still considering if they should break up watch and buy into pieces or sell it whole. The debt is the big issue right now.

fake rumors

"I can’t believe this thing was up yesterday and again today by this much. Missed on rev and EPS and guidance. Also, CEO talking about some mumbo jumbo on cloud architecture and how that is going to be transformative without any CAPEX???? Whaaat??? Looks like private equity guys could step in to take this thing out. If that does not happen, this thing is going down to $20"
pure carnage

just a rumor
over 25 by close for sure
"I'm watching the option chains this morning, and am laughing my butt off. I can't believe how much inside trading is going on. Knowing what I know this morning, and looking at the HIGH number of options being traded, if the SEC doesn't investigate this, then I don't know what to believe."
NLSN is up 7.81% to 13.12
"Wow, a 5 year drop on this stock. Time to change the board members!!"
this has become a takeover candidate even after the announced split within the company
going below 21 for sure
"So glad i left there! As a senior executive, I saw first hand how bad the management was and they were headed toward disaster. Glad that their underhanded dealings caught up with them!!!"
NLSN reached an all time low at 11.72
"Confirmed deal is done. Happened very late last night. Price still being finalized, somewhere around $31, $32 and change. Comes down to NPV and EBITDA calculations...details. Call options buyers the last couple of days will be VERY happy (and should be investigated)."

"Just out of curiosity, how long ago did Chris and Art Nielsen withdraw from active participation in NLSN?"
Nielsen is down 4.94% to 13.48
NLSN is a sham! All of the insiders got out and all of the GE upper management got their big payouts and left town as soon as possible. Now the remnants are left with an incompetent management and a sagging stock price.
Nielsen is up 4.91% to 14.32
"OK. Price action from today shows that momentum is done and tired with this stock. Simply no more buyers out there. This thing will see $22 in the next 4 weeks. Mark my words and sell as best you can. There is no reason with the earnings they announced, that the stock held up this much, even with the private equity interested in it. Pain coming."

"None the less, Blackstone and Apollo are not dullards. They know what they are doing. They did’nt want to pay $28 because there is no way to get from under the $8 billion in debt they would be assuming. They can’t sell the asset to anyone, 3-5 years from now... this thing is not a utility and their customers are increasingly going to FB and SNAP to get their metrics. This thing only has $1.48 in cash per share, somehow manages to pay a dividend of $1.40 per share and has a total debt to equity ratio of 2.75. Think about it.... at an EBITDA of 1.47 billion in 2018, their DEBT/EBITDA is 5.7x which is way higher than many utility, energy, or material stocks. Either a dividend cut, more writeoffs coming or equity dilution.... since there is no cash to operate... and we now know that private equity won’t buy. This thing is fairly valued at about $14"
low innovation and high competition... Nielsen is toast.

This company is in bed with the agencies of the US government and is used to support corrupt decisions by them. The testing methods are classically flawed. I would say the testing methods are defined by people who have grown up in rich families that have been in bed with politicians for generations and graduated from ivy league schools and think people are ignorant and afraid to challenge their rich degrees. I think this company is a sham.
I worked there and they are a total disaster.....

"Just looked at the volumes and timing of call options trading in NLSN this morning. I want to know who was buying all of the 26, 27 and 28 strike price options BEFORE the big break right after the noon hour EST."

Wow! Bye bye dividend. (83 percent of it).
Deal appears to be dead again. Debt is the issue. My take is that they will split it into pieces.

"The Activist SpotlightNielsen Holdings (NLSN) Business: media measurement Investor’s Avg Cost: $23.09/share Stock Market Value: $9.3 billion ($26.15/share)What’s Happening: Elliott Associates intends to talk with the board about operational and strategic opportunities, including a possible sale of the company.Key Numbers: 13.7%: Nielsen’s return since its 2011 public offering 183.8%: the return of the Nasdaq over the same time periodBehind the Scenes: Elliott is a very successful activist, particularly in strategic situations. Nielsen has two businesses: 1) Watch—its television and online video ratings, a virtual monopoly with 45% Ebitda margins; and 2) Buy—for retail consumer behavior information and analytics.Buy, which has been facing challenges, accounts for only 20% of Nielsen’s Ebitda, but has somewhat monopolized the company narrative. Accordingly, Nielsen is trading at a very depressed valuation. There are opportunities for the Buy segment to invest in technology to improve performance. However, the primary opportunity here is strategic. Nielsen is conducting a strategic review of Buy, but private equity may be more interested in acquiring the whole company.Private-equity investors bought the company in 2006 and took it public in 2011 at $23 per share; they still have their eyes on Nielsen. The company’s chairman works at Carlyle; another director works at Blackstone, and the former CEO of Nielsen is the head of portfolio operations at Blackstone. The company recently announced its CEO will resign by year end, which makes it an ideal time to sell the company. Nielsen said its board and management “welcome the views and perspectives of its owners, including Elliott Management.By Barron online, Kenneth Squire"

the selling of the retail research arm of Nielsen was always the intent when they announced the split of the divisions a year ago...hence the long delay of implementation...the late Mr Nielsen just turned over in his grave with the announced sale today (11/1)
