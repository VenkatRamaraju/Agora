Moving on to better investments! Good luck bag holders."
Something has happened for this stock to drop over 4% in one day. Does anyone know of anything out there. I can't find any news about it.

"Cerner needs to bought; they are cleaning this company up (and getting rid of the former deadwood management team) in the hopes of a buyer coming along to make shareholder's happy. Brent Shafer is a placeholder CEO; say all the right things, smile a lot, and pray that a bigger fish comes along. They had their lunch eaten long ago by Epic; Cerner bet on the wrong horse and were crushed in the EMR Market. Time to sell and move on."

Got it. Amazon

I wonder what happened to all the longs...

Rumor about partnering with Amazon .
"I have to update my post. CERN has languished in the same range ($55-$71). Since it appears CERN is on a downward swing at this time, those who believe that it's a buy signal every time I post should load up. Good luck with that."
Did I remember from conference call that CERN will begin a dividend program this year??
This industry is headed for consolidation. Whether this is good or bad for CERN is hard to decide. If GE Healthcare bought them it would have to be from a lower price base.
POS hasn't moved for over 2 1/2 years. Sell ALL and buy FB on strong momentum.

"CERN has languished in the same range ($57 - $71) for years. And based on their touts and profits, you would think they'd reward shareholders with at least a paltry dividend."
Cerner is down 5.02% to 61.43
"Is it conceivable that we could see a stock price of $75 or higher by year end??? I've held this baby since 2003. I like the dividend, but it's strange that everyone that was with the company back in 2003 is gone or about to be gone."
Great technicals today. Might break through its ascending triangle resistance line....
Market wants to sell me a backlog...yes please!
