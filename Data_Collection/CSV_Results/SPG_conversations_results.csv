Recent headlines and conversations for SPG
It wasn’t that bad lol
Buying JCPenney is not going to work out because JC penny is going down as a retailer similar to Sears. It is a dying business. My guess is JC Penney might have some prime real estate that Simon might use for other purposes. Perhaps Simon got JC for very cheap price
"What is most surprising is that any longs are surprised here. The list of bankruptcies continues to grow while SPG continues to extend it's exposure. Offices trending toward hybrid use of workspace and concurrent reduction of office sizes will only add to the commercial market inventory, another negative for SPG. Potential rent alternatives continue to vanish. And, as I've said before, look up CO-TENANCY CLAUSE in commercial leases. Buy at 40 and hold for a decade."
Uh oh.....pre-market not looking good. Asia and Europe down big too. Stimulus is being played and a deal may happen between Pelosi and W/H only to be shot down by Senate. Nancy would love to have $2 trillion debt be logged under Trump administration and GOP not going to let that happen....jmho.
Disney shuttering at least 20% of Disney Stores as it shifts focus to e-commerce
Chicago closing ALL restaurants......hmm.....it's not even November yet...long winter here folks.
"Wisconsin Southridge Mall & 2 other Wisconsin properties go into foreclosure. The Mall at Tuttle Crossing, Ohio also a Simon property goes into foreclosure. Don't shoot the messenger:-)"
"Why does ticker symbol SPG show up as ""Spark Power Group Inc."" on Yahoo Finance? Everywhere else I looked, ticker symbol SPG corresponded to Simon Property Group???"
"Hi, please forgive me if this has been asked before. Can someone tell me when the ex dividend date is for this stock?? It should have been this week some time but see no information on it. Thanks"
How big of a deal is it if let's say.. 50% or 70% of the shops don't pay their rent?
"I live near a lot of malls in LA and spg is booming like there is no lockdown, BUY THE DIP"
"So much uncertainty. C19, global retreat into curfews as numbers exceed the worst of last spring, failed back-to-school, and the demise of Black Friday are churning #SPG price action into lower vol, eating at premiums and encouraging longs to cover positions and head to the sidelines...out of retail risk... OR into #AMH and #MPW? ... diversifying REIT positions just might provide some principal protection, with strong analyst support and healthy institutional participation at a more palatable price points."
Get out while you can and buy back in later or don’t look at this stock for at least 12+ months. GLTA
should I buy a thong with my dividend?
Earnings around the corner. I understand retail stores are scaling down (doubt will go extinct) but there are plans to restructure oentertainment & dining.
buy in target would be around $50 time frame is less than 2 months.
Couple Weeks after the Q2 numbers (which will be less than expected) SPG will star gaining crazy at stock market. I will hold it till mid July or August for sure. Nothing to panic.
"https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/taking-a-pass-on-simon-property-group-15366387?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO&yptr=yahooWhen The Street(aka The Herd)turns its back on SPG, you know it's time to walk away...."
@MT....where you at on #SPG?......check coronovirus news. Be careful here.
"Michael, anything else to say next time I tell you it will go to 61 next Thursday as I did last week? Next time listen and you will win ;))"
No resistance until $68.48
"Phew. Out at 92 of what was left. Probably be back in at 35, after TCO biz is concluded. Unless Simon says buy failing JCP too!"
I think we are looking at $115 by EOW easy!
How do we all expect the quarterly report to go?All i know is I feel like it's going to be good
Just buy
"OMG,RIP Simon.New this morning stock offering 17.5 million shares...of dilution!GTFO people!This will fall to $50 bucks"
"Accumulating more - best assets in the biz. Time and patience. And while you’re waiting, collect that 7.5%."
short sqeeze in MAC looming 50% shorts have to cover
look like wrong entry..
Watch the break through $96. Bounced off it.
Simon Property is down 4.92% to 120.51
Just bought more. Total of 1100 shares :D
This how I like to start the week.
Big volume!
$SPG....... Looking for day/swing momentum trades? Loin Stock AlertsQ......... has you covered. They call it like it is without all the fluff.
Short squeeze coming?
Simon borrowed tens of Billions to overbuild retail patsy malls!Sears and Macys are toast.Most of your tenants are 18 months away from lease ruptures.LOL
"People can make money on SPG short and long. The truth is nobody knows exactly how things will unfold, I can only say that the shops of SPG were I shop are still quite crowded (but less than before). Why? The outlets that Simon Property owns are in locations that have a huge attraction because it is not only a mall but also an experience. This is the situation in Europe, in USA they are lagging behind. Data is showing a new norm of 80% in asian countries (SPG also owns some), 60%-70% in Europe (slowly crawling up) and USA sub 60% (lagging like hell). The more regulation there is on wearing mask, and cleaning hands, the better. USA needs to step up its hand cleaning and social distancing game. I hope SPG keeps the dividends low, looks for opportunities, and keeps the cashflow in check; the moves they did so far I really like. I think the reason most sold out of SPG is the dividend cut and the uncertainty surrounding Covid 19.There will most likely be a second and third wave. The second wave in US seems to have already started when the first wave was not finished. The third wave is likely to be a lot less impactfull (I analysed previous pandemics).Shopping malls and outlets are part of a costumer experience and will keep attracting people. Small locations will attract even fewer people than before is my expectation.You can increase this stock price! How? Wash hands, wear masks and keep distance.Shops should keep doors open and consider the air flow."
Say it isn’t true Joe ?I keep shorting
"Well, Jim Cramer mentioned it today so.... yeah."
JOSE most traders lose money. Did you ever lose money? so why laugh at people under water? Seems like you are the only basher on this board period. Go long SPG and thank me later son.
"How many times in your investing lifetime can you buy such high quality REITs at such massive discounts to NAV? Look at the charts as far back as you can and see when it has been the best times to buy. Prime, top quality assets that pay big and arguably very safe yields currently on sale and primed for the recovery. Real assets. Real income.$SPG $BPY $MAC $RIOCF $HRUFF"
I’ll enter in 70s
Still half the price of it’s all time high now owning TCO and multiple other properties coming online. Don’t be surprised to see $200 very soon
"Wow!!!!.....this is like robbing infants holding a suckered in a baby carriage....so used to this in miners, I guess normal investors don't see the forest from the trees. Thank you all!"
I'm officially up 100% on SPG today...nothing but smiles. That is all.
Going to be a lot of crying longs when the dilution price comes in at $76 share and stock falls.....not sure why noone besides me is asking what the secondary price is set at. Another bizarre market practice for 2020.
"Visited mall to return online purchase, a lot of empty/closed store fronts."
"You WILL lower rents and shorten lease terms, OR, you will face more empty caverns inside your malls. Tenants will revolt, presuming they are not already operating in bankruptcy.Amazon has very quickly changed everything. The Simons still think it's 1984 @ The Gap !"
"When posters resort to using #@seeking#alpha articles it's a definite ""Danger Will Robinson, Danger"" type moment."
Malls getting busy! Christmas here we come! Go SPG
"Interesting- down 10% in 5 days. Vaccine rolling out, TCO almost complete, divi strong as can be and probably looking at a boost. Buy the dips. Safe $150 12 months out."
How many here listened to the call and of those how many are buying on any weakness. Back to $150 fast
Have you noticed Amazon lately ? Corncob !
RUE21 won't be carrying anymore water for the Simons.
“We are encouraged by the consumer response thus far”
Do they want to run this in a hurry to the $140s? Powerful move the past few days...
"I think SPG is headed <$50, maybe down near it's Covid-crash low of ~$42. In the Ameritrade dividend estimator tool, they have now listed SPG in the ""The following symbols do not have a sufficient history of making consistent dividend distributions to estimate future dividends:"" list. Now we have the riots going on.. sorry, I'm not a short, I just think it's going lower from here, pretty soon the div if paid will be 100% of AFFO, and they're buying Taubman amidst all of this..whew..."

Like a teenager maxing out their credit cards. Folks'll be racing to shop at brick and mortar Lucky right after they pick up Men In Black at Blockbuster."
I am interested in buying at the 42-46 price range. any opinions about the possibillity it goes back to this price range with the upcoming Q1 release?
what did he say. There are those are a little nervous about our technology and it sounds like he hit the nail on the head on this Yahoo forum
Buy the dip right now. $130 coming soon
Today this will be like a rocket!
unbelievable!! NY fines Simon about 1 million for the 2 year investigation of the Attorney General saying they have deterred retailers from opening additional outlet stores within the area. Now lets see now these stores would open additional outlets that compete with online shopping? This is completely ridiculous. Simon announced that the investigation was without merit and distracting so they just paid the fine and went on with business.
Spg- malls will be mostly dead
Just relentless selling!
Wow.. stocks up everyday.. reits down again big.. crazy!
Pop to $150 post earnings. Can’t wait for Monday night conference call with David!
Back to $150 by summer
no matter what happens it’s a screaming buy below 80 bucks a share. Especially with the governments 6 trillion dollar put

I need to see this stock rally to 75 already !!!
"Nice squeeze.. Makes perfect sense.. the virus is gone, rents are all paid, and shoppers are flocking back in droves.. lol"
"Go to any hair salon, beauty boutique, etcetera......ask owner how business is....they will tell you stories of customers calling in canceling because of layoffs in theirs household.....some crying. Even employed customers will do things like self coloring at home and only come in for a cut.....don't take my word for it.....ask stylist when you get your own hair done. Scary retail out there without debt inducing stimulus."
SPG management is all business.Walk away from under-perform malls.Strong arm purchase agreements to lower agreed upon purchase price.Sue tenants.All business. That's ok. Is all business.Is it right?
Will this go up soon?
somewhat low Robert? Down 7 dollars a share? AMZN up 17 I guess I should have bought AMZN instead of Simon stock. Am I boasting? Well not now.
down turn was caused by joe biden saying he would lock down again. however vaccine makers say it will state to be distributed by next month.
"I have made $22,000 in 3 months buying this stock and then flipping it for .50 to 1.00 per share...wash, rinse, repeat.. $$$$ I'm not quite a day-trader; more like a every other day trader!"

"Energy stocks up sharply lately means a lot of cars out there. Plus, Thanksgiving and Christmas is coming.SPG is great. Joe can eat his puts or poops."
JC Penney is the next SEARS. Malls are toast. Merry Christmas to the Simons of Indy !!
the flowers will bloom in the spring
When div will be paid?
"Under Armpit continues to collapse. Just another retailer, who thought shoes would save them....at the mall."
96% occupancy they have that’s amazing
Look at the recovery in the stock market since the bottom in March. Now look at SPG chart. See the difference. It's not rocket science. This stock will not recover. It's a dead cat bounce. Next step will be a divided cut. Dont listen to the shills .
I am going into it..this week iwas reading the charts thi is a good chance to buy ..once thi is over..is going bact to 100/up
$100 end of year as predicted

"This stock is facing a major hurdle with 50% of companies continuing with work at home when virus is eliminated, no brainer for cost savings. So where is the incentive to keep paying ridiculous rents. Whichever companies remain will look for large discounts. Commercial real estate is toast , This stock is a screaming short."
Next week is going to be a big week. I have a feeling!!!!
Dont worry not many muppets left to panic sell the same news for 100th time from here
SPG reached a 52 Week low at 134.28
Need to take out $96 and then we’re off to the races
Good bye 60s. Hello 70s support
canaccord genuity a full service banking and financial services firm in Canada has a buy on SPGIt is the largest independent investment dealer in Canada.
The overwhelming negative sentiment on this message board is probably a contrary indicator.
SPG board is boring
5% loss in 5 trading days. This is not your yesterday's REIT. lol
I warned u
Any guess what the dividend rate will be once the TCO acquisition is finalized?
"I’m long SPG, this pandemic will not last forever!"
What about Simon's 207 Global Properties with 3 Billion global visitors a year
"Just look at Tiffany/LVMH deal that legally couldn't be broken up on Covid Pandemic grounds....#SPG buying Taubman, all that matters is ""at what price""....more balls and chains....no Court undoing a sophisticated take-over......won't hapoen."
$91.37 is the number to break for the day. Giddy up!
Guess #SPG management will now be busy with what's fashionable for Brooks Brothers to display and sell for 2021. UGH!!!!
Zero interest rates for the next 2 years! Take the depressed teal estate with the divi all day!
"I think this stock will be at $100 by end of 2020. There's just way too much debt and in order for the company to further transform itself, it needs to load up more with debt. Owning this is like owning a junk bond. It pays well while it's paying out, but you never know if the lights are going to be shut tomorrow."
"Hey, Snowflake, whish it would warm up a little so some of your flakes would melt and disappear. You must be writing a book about what you do hourly!"
"I sold half today. thinking this will get higher. and with a nice dividend, I have to hold on to this one"
@Kelly downthumbing me across all post.....that's a clue to when you get on their nerves....they just get vindictive. lol.
read article about hidden loser in AMC collapse.
Looks like @Robotech has picked up the fallen flag on this battlefield as most other pumpers have met their demise.
A bigger stim coming sooner or later within a month
Buckle up....here we go
Amazon up $40 per share after hours. Retail shopping malls are in secular decline.

"Hi, I’m Joe J Valens and I don’t want the world to rebound"
"Been lurking around this board since late March. For what it's worth to y'all I live in Orlando FL. SPG has some properties opening up back here and it is not looking good for Florida Mall at the moment. The mall was ""open"" earlier in the week, aka the food court and Dicks Sporting goods (which stayed open the whole time with curbside) but the department stores are just starting to open and there was hardly anyone in Macys today. I don't see any signs of consumer confidence coming back to Sand Lake (which I drive daily). Tourism is nonexistent (traffic is amazing) and the surrounding area cannot support that mall, especially its high end stores. Dine in restaurants are reopening, but even in one of the free states people are being super cautious and have averaged 4-10 tables seated at a time at the average Chilis. Just passing on what I see in real time, good luck. Lemme know if you see any SPG properties around you performing well :)"
MAC is on fire. Sell half SPG and buy MAC.
Just hold $100-$105 and I won’t worry
No stopping SPG!
when is the dividend date for this Q2
"Just not sure if buyers are driving around looking at local malls. Most have lost 2 major anchors, which triggers renegotiated leases for lower rent payments by smaller tenants. This is a dying industry. Great articles on Demand Destruction at #retail#drive.....online stories on retailers. Total Destruction."
"JPM analysis on the raise price target to $125 is a joke. Prepandemic stock was $150. During pandemic acquired Taubman, put in place a retail e-commerce money maker, abatements done, more properties coming on line and dividend increases on the horizon."
"SPG the only REIT to post profits during the worst months of the pandemic between march to june. If when the world was actually shut down and SPG made money, there is no way they wont make even more now with more stuff opened."
"$SPG, $BPY, and $MAC all up this week. $WPG will follow!"
SPG could end up looking like a steal once the economy starts to normalize
"2 articles below! Commercial property is seeing transactions at book value. NAV is supported by recent sales, which goes to prove REITs are heavily discounted. The 2 transactions below are very recently negotiated. $SPY $BPY $SPGhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/riocan-unlocks-value-enhances-balance-213000905.htmlhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/san-francisco-transamerica-pyramid-sells-for-650-million-223959613.html"
"Does anyone remember what did Simon say few months ago about minimum quarterly dividend? I remember at least 60% of FFO, but I could be wrong."
Over 87 in AH Decent volume too Any ideas ?Hopefully an upgrade coming
The co-tenancy clause in mall contracts will be Simon's downfall. Acceleration of bankruptcies and closures = no rent=no income.. Add to that their horribly timed purchase of Taubman... drew down US$3B of capital AND increased their exposure . David Simon can't prop up the price with US$9m purchases forever...Playing the bagpipes at the funeral of brick and mortar. This is nothing like 2008.
95.56 resistance
All the muppets out!? Man we got dumb people in this they are going to control all jcp locations some of this space could be converted to apartments let alone amazon or flagship jcp stores. It also gives simon online retail stores. I am giggling at how most longs and shorts dont get it. Location location means MONEY
Snowflake. You said $109. Time for you to sell 1k shares you bought at $119.
SPG Management said that there is no need to raise additional equity and balance sheets looks very sound. That is what the investment community wants to hear to take the stock price up from here!!!!
"SHORTs, if there are still any left, The more you short, The higher it goes & The longer you hold, The more you'll lose. COVER and GO LONG to make up for the loss you've taken. Target is $100"
"Hey Barney, how much did AMZN go down today? Oh I know you must also have Facebook .How much did Simon stock go up today? Oh I know Barney instead of buying the stock all you do is gripe."
I swear I saw 36% down a sec ago
Does Barnacle Barney have a buy on SPG or a downgrade? He is surely a top independent financial advisor.
"I considered taking some profits today when i saw price going up, hope it holds tomorrow.."
Straight to $150z enjoy the ride
Buckle up - here we go!
SPG dumpster fire just getting started. Please trade accordingly.
Can this hit 80 bucks tomorrow EOD with this hype?
The sucker the longs with the so called dividends. Your lost is my gain. It’s what it’s!
If Simon stock ever gets back over 170 then what?
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/a-scary-number-of-retail-companies-are-facing-bankruptcy-amid-the-coronavirus-pandemic-180604964.htmlThe writing is on the wall. Buying assets because they're cheap is not a sustainable strategy. These retailers are in 11 or 13 because they were yesterday's news with antiquated business models preC19. Think about the supply chain; what manufacturer will fill orders to a company in reorg? Empty shelves are death to a retailer. And if you're thinking SPG is all about the real estate, think again. Our new reality will feature hybrid workweeks which will translate to downsizing of commercial office space and the consequent flooding of the market with inventory."
"Yeah, the malls are going to open, and everybody's going shopping at Sears and PenneysHurray, Hurray. Bahahahahahahaha. Al the best, Brad."
180 PT !
Shorts are welcomed. This is my highest position and I want to buy much more but it looks like we wont see $60s ever again.
Dont fall for tech rally if moderna is good they areDead money will mean 2 worldClass vaccines bear case deatroyed
"Pier 1 Imports, the next mall rat to collapse ?"
SPG should use this opportunity to get property taxes down to help their tenants i dont believe these malls are worth what they are assesses at jmho
"It is all about vaccines. Any good news from one is the vaccines, it will jump."
"SPG will default on their mortgages, and file bankruptcy in December.Christmas will be a disaster for them."

Setting up for a good friday... cheers
"$MAC currently trading at ~2.5x P/S while its larger peer $SPG is trading ~7.5x P/S. I'm not suggesting Macerich deserves to trade at a multiple equal to it's larger and better run Simon Property, but I am saying the gap between the two shouldn't be nearly this large. $MAC can double from today's $13.xx level and still be a decent bargain. $MAC is being big time under-appreciated as a re-opening play in my opinion. Good luck MAC longs!"
Trash company. Sellll
when this go 80?
who has daring to buy
"ahh the old dead cat bounce, gotta love it. The longs think this is going back to 90. See you @ 40. Short this pig."

Under Armour expects full year revenue to be down by a high-teen % rate as it sells fewer items through department stores and off price retailers. Sales and earnings topped expectations though. Wonder where all the sales came from if not from department stores?
Spg will hit $200 by end of year.
$142.25 - 52 week high
"really doing its best to hold the 60 handle. Still think we could head lower and back to the 50 range, but another round of Fed intervention will prop it up."
NVDA very volatile up to 168 this morning then down to 143 back to 152 and now is 149
"So, in lockdown it goes up to $90s on pure speculation. Now when everything is rolling across the country it dips down in $60s. Might even dip down to high 50s with scare money."
Work from home new normal now..Post covid..no need for office space..sell sell sell
The kings of all kings simons!!!!
so far 145 to 147 good buy..i traded 5 to 10 times and so far lucky lets see
"Brookfield retail reit bpyu paid their full dividend. Said that they thought april and may would mark the bottom and that they thought they would eventually collect all the deferred rents. They also put 5 BILLION into a retail fund to invest in retail tenants that had strong sales, but depressed valuations due to short term liquidity problems from a forced govt shutdown."
"Apple, Boeing, bunch of other stocks....this one included up on pitiful volume....don't be fooled....10:30am volume should be 1/3rd of daily volume....watch out for this Market....smart money selling out to retail."
Who bought my shares at $81. Thank you and good luck.
is this heading to bankruptcy?
Is anyone actually going to shopping malls anymore? I have one 3 minutes from me and use Amazon for most of my gifts. Does SPG have a bright future?
"Darn, Amzn got down to 992 and I was away and missed the opportunity to go long"
never buy this mall stock ..wait for 100
What are peoples opinion for today? Will it drop another consecutive day?
wow a bit excessive. buy the dip!
Dividend boost coming. Love this money making machine!
I am out when we get to 110 and thank you for everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Do the foreclosures in retail industry give SPG a boost or will impact be negative?My thought is they can buy a lot for bargain.. what do you think?
Look for the break above $95
"Other reits even with good results got hammered 7%, I think as an investor you need to be able to handle a 30% maybe even 50% downturn. Else why do you invest in reits?"
Executives cutting salary they will suspend dividend too
"Some Math: 28,000,000 unemployed just lost $300/week = $8.4 billion/week. If just 2% would have went to purchases at a Mall it would be ($8.4 billion x .02) $168 million a week in lost sales per week.....over $3 billion by year end at just 2%. These are just staggering numbers that people are just plainly ignoring."
Moderna vaccine !!!!!!!!!
I was shopping online for action cameras and Amazon's price was the highest. So where are all the discounts?
Toys R Toast is closing 180 stores. Maybe the wise guy Simons can turn the empty caverns in their leveraged malls into bit coin mining ops ?! Bbbbwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
is there any notice for dividends in Dec?
unbelievable. Why the weakness
"malls are dead, total garbage"
David Simon made a passing comment on store closing saying 2019 will not be as bad as 2018. The press has blow his comment out of context. All metrics up and raising dividend. Buying back stock and paying off debt but the press says he is nervous about store closings.
ER can only help this sad stock valuation.
Who grabbed that cheap stock with me?
"SPG is dead. 80% of businesses are not paying rent, this company will bleed cash in the near term and will be forced to liquidate properties below value. Real Estate is the next big shoe to drop. stay clear. might bottom in the 20s ."
"Just bought a bit more before close, I think this is a one day break for the entire market today, this one was $168 pre-Covid plus the nice dividend."
$250 stock at the gifted price !!!!
"Good things come to those who wait, who know the value of patience, whose achievements are derived through dedication, effort and endurance."
lol wait for less than 100...too bad earning
Toys R Us is close to bankruptcy. Maybe the Simons can put on their Santa Claus Grinch outfits and cut the rent tab ? LOL
$100 by friday
Buy the morning dip - this one ain’t stopping
Give it 2 years to rise to 300's. Load it!
This is going down. There is problem with evictions.
Risk reward horrible here as soon as xmas isOver governors will have zero issue closing malls again
Nobody is paying rent — earnings are toast
Keeps bouncing off $96. When it breaks through gonna run
"Many stocks up and volume is 1/2 of normal, some just a tad more......be careful. One indicator is #EAT and #DRI. They'll be big beneficiaries of new Stimulus bill. They're sickly today. Lots of big caps up, but again volume way down."
Absolute beast! Glad I got in at its low.
I think this thing is rallying on the premise that they’re gonna raise its dividend back to the higher dividend
Simon Property reached a 52 Week low at 101.73
"SIMON SAYS ""sell this stock today"" !!!!"
Get ready for the post earnings run
"they are ensuring they get a better deal from Taubman. Just want a lower price I feel, or they're looking out for investors ensuring they have enough cash to avoid a massive dividend cut. I see this as good news."
This lawsuit will be like Pennzoil vs Texaco. A battle to the death. Simon will take Bk before they blow $52 a share on TCO. You watch. imho
80 is the new 60
Went up too fast - heading back to high 90s...
Bouncing right off $96. Buy

JC Penney just adored retail shopping malls. How'd that work out for them ? More caverns at da mall.
within next 6 months SPG likely hits $100 - this is my final selling target. I made already 3 trades: last one was from 52 to 69. Currently my average buy price is only 22 (taking into account profit from 3 round trips). Bottoms were hit 3 times. We are going for the 4th one. It can be dragged a bit lower than 50 but this will be the last chance to buy it cheap.
"Earnings $3, and how can they afford dividend of $5.20?"
With this stock I just reinvest the dividends. Best of breed in a sector that is consolidating which is good for us imo. I can see a 200 handle someday and their dividend in the meantime will always go up.
You think it’ll test 55-60s again?

"based on the chart, it looks like it will ultimately work its way up to 80-85 dollar range. That is about 55% of its value pre pandemic. Makes sense. $50-$60 range is pure fear. I have faith in the american shopper, and rent delays are not the end of the world. The banks will allow mortgage delays to coincide as well. Basically a pause. I am buying calls on SPG, SKT and MAC.

$WPG $SPG upgraded today on bullish prospects for malls. I know the whole relationship between the two but bullishness in the mall sector will only help wpg. Recall that 40% of wpg is now modem malls it's not just the malls that spg spun off years ago.

"Simon is living on the fumes of leases written years ago. Every new month, somewhere there is a lease expiring, and the retail mall tenants are becoming increasingly weak and distressed.

@Joe writes this down too. Managed to buy 100 more shares. A total of 1100. :)
Should fly with announcement of squashing the deal. Still going to get the properties. Just at a much better price. These guys are sharp. Lucky too that the deal didn’t close prior to Covid19.
Fair value right now is about $90.

This has a huge post covid19 upside. May not be straight up but this business is going to be thriving again and the dividend will keep coming. A clear cut investment going forward.
CFRA maintains a sell on the stock .... they missed the boat on the run-up .... they want in ...so they downgraded it ...lol ...... these brokers ....hold your shares ...economy and physical retail will be back sometime next year ... and this company isn't losing money under current conditions ...it will be around and is positioning for the future ...

No?Yup.. makes perfect sense.. Sorry, got to add to my short.. Think this rally is a bit premature and makes no sense.... And I dont care how much insiders buy to prop it up..."
Buying any weakness at the open and will continue to build. Easy double in 12 months
One reasonable upgrade and this thing flies!
they own the best locations.I know some of their tenants will go out of business but they still own the space.

Buy that morning dip. This week we break $100. Heading right back to $150 fast
"I just bought a few shares of Simon this morning. Malls will survive. The best will survive the best because of management and locations. Even amazon has resorted to brick and mortar for a very good reason. People still want to buy merchandise immediately and touch and see it before purchase, try on a new pair of shoes. Of course they will evolve into something else that nobody can visualize over time. I’ve watched a Simon property do just that over the years. Lately it has changed even faster. Just like the S&P 500 has a turnover of 35% every decade, so will a mall. For every penny’s or Neiman Marcus that bite the dust there will be another up and coming company that no one has heard of before. There’s no longer a penny’s or radio shack there but there is a Tesla showroom next to Nordstrom and an Amazon bookstore. Who would have thought that they would now exist 10 years ago. Many more changes occurred and will occur in the future. Many tout that there’s just too much retail square footage. I don’t think so. Population increases produce demand. I want to find something locally at a good price. My next purchase is going to be a 10 foot drinking water safe leader hose made by flexilla. Guess where I’m buying it. It’s not at amazon or eBay. They both have the same hose at a much higher price than Home Depot."
"S&P 500 at record highs, but not simple Simons retail mall complex."

"Here is an exercise for someone: What is the value of the raw land that Simon malls sits on? In my area both Simon malls sit on highly desirable real estate. I'm sure other malls owned by Simon sit on valuable real estate. The malls can always be bulldozed to the ground. The last time I looked land did notcome out of a printing press. Other businesses can be built on the real estate such as apartments, condos, medical facilities,and other needed structures and businesses."

France just went into a National Lockdown.
With record # of store closings last year Simon still managed to squeak out profits. But Barney says no. Somehow Barney thinks Simon is not a smart CEO. Barney has been saying for the last two years Simon will not be profitable but so far Barney has been proven wrong.

at simonson in santa Clara right now. its fully open operating at in store 10% people are in the halls of the mall and out side waiting to get in. it's not full capacity but it's not 0 capacity... some fools are even in there gotta messages.
$180 is the yearly low back in Feb. I guess that's where we are heading. Wipe out all the profits don't you so we can just write this year off as flat. The next pop in REIT and I'm out until next year. This is BS. Just drop it because of a thought of a rate hike of 0.25. How ridiculous.

"SPG is not Spark Power Group. Spark trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol SPG, but does not generally trade in the US markets. They are on the Pinksheets under the symbol SKGPF, but there is no bid or ask. SPG Toronto is about 1.1 a share Canadian.Kevin"
Barnacle Barney did you by chance listen to the conference call by Dave Simon?The reason I ask is when I listened to what he had to say he says one thing and you say another. I wonder if you know more than Simon when it comes to the real estate business.
Easy money loaded up yesterday
I think the earning is very good!
"All the REITS are going to go higher. 0% interest rate environment and cash flows are still tremendous. Restore old dividends and SPG, SKT, MAC and others are just too heavily shorted for the definitive recovery."
"$600/wk, $10 billion total/wk now officially dead until further notice."
"Oh my...motley fool on #SPG teaming up with #AMZN...lol...didn't read as I know it all already.....they won't and Simon can't get permits to go from retail to distribution hubs. Besides that, any followers of Amazon knows that they use their partners (think usps, FedEx, ups) until they don't need them anymore. Do your due diligence on such nonsense articles."

Ok - bought 500 more yesterday at $68. 500 more today on any weakness.
sold with quick money
Well everyone who panic sold this morning at $49 is now effed.
"Joe, I respect your decision to short SPG. What's your exit share price to cover? 30's? 20's?"
Bed Bath and Body Odor continues to stink up this retail patsy sector. (smirk)
Why is the stock weak ? The chart ? Looks like a reload price of around 110ish . All I can see.
I'd say going green was a sign stimulus has a chance. but volume is non-existent.
The best stimulus is an open economy. Joe doesn't analyze information appropriately to think COVID19 will be worse than already has is wrong. Only real concern is outstanding debt. If the mall can stay open it will cover most of those costs.
Love the cheap am stock! Easy buy all the up to $150
Maybe SPG bought into Amazon stock.
Looks like a great earnings report tomorrow! Go SPG!!!!!
Buy the dips and be rewarded. Down from $160s pre Corona. Over $50 Bill mc to under $20 Bill.
Retail being suckered into stocks as Funds sell off...just my humble opinion......do your own due diligence.
And don’t forget that dividend will be “announced” sometime in June per the CEO !
"i dont think they can support that dividend forever .. eventually they will need to cut it ... but even if they halve it, it is a decent payout. as for SPG's future, i think most Americans want to get out of the house after being couped up ..once the risk goes down from vaccine, more effective treatments, and/or a less deadly virus mutation, .... SPG will come back .."
The entry point I'm gonna hold out another day or to see if it goes to about 65

I wish i had kept this when it was around $50 last year
"After earning we will see 75 at least. They have very positive balance sheet and occupancy rate. Most of the retailers suffered a lot , not mall owners in this pandemic."
"Just wait till David Simons tenants leases expire later this year and into 2018. Can you spell market capitalization collapse ?Oh joy to the world, SEARS, Macys, Kohls, don't count ?! LOL"
No one below the age of 65 goes to the mall anymore.

"Q3 Earnings FFO for HR.UN:""FFO per Unit in Q3 2020 was $0.41 compared to $0.38 in Q2 2020 and $0.43 in Q3 2019. Excluding the Q3 2020 provision for bad debts of $13.4 million, Q3 2020 FFO would have been $0.46 per Unit, an increase of $0.03 per Unit compared to Q3 2019. AFFO per Unit was $0.35 in Q3 2020 compared to $0.29 in Q2 2020 and $0.35 in Q3 2019. Distributions paid as a percentage of AFFO was 49.0% in Q3 2020, resulting in significant retained cash flow. ""Let's take the 41 cent number, which I believe is low. 41 cents x 4 quarters = 1.64Price to FFO is around 7.7. That is ridiculous.Now remove bad debts (CECRA replaced by CERS, so bad debts will drop), factor in rising contractual rents, higher new leases, improvements in rentals from Jackson Park, and FFO from all their just launched developments such as River Landing, and likely have FFO around .46 to .50. At the mid end .48, price to FFO is around 6.6.Worst case, bad debts get worse, leasing of new properties falls apart, CERS support is stopped, and we are looking at FFO around .38/quarter. That works out to a price to FFO around 8.3. I find this highly unlikely, and still incredibly cheap.No matter how you cut it, fire sale is happening on this highly diversified REIT designed to weather a storm like this.""As at September 30, 2020, H&R had $1.0 billion of unused borrowing capacity available under its lines of credit, $54.4 million of cash on hand and an unencumbered asset pool of approximately $3.5 billion. ""Additionally, 250M unsecured debenture at 2.906% was completed in December, adding even more liquidity in Q4. This low interest rate on unsecured debt shows the quality of H&Rs credit rating.$SPG $BPY $WPC $BXP $ARE $SLG $AMT $CIOIt would be irresponsible to not put that cash to work in Q2 through buybacks and/or a payout increase."
cfra believes the stock price should go down to to a level where the dividend would yield 17% or more in a major downturn. Wow. Some of these analysts are seriously dumb. But i will take it if people react to it.
lol people dumped
Why is this down if earnings were good?
By February earnings call we’ll be at $100. Thought we would have hit it by end of year. Was wrong
Gotta break that $122. Earnings going to take this to $150 fast. Hop on board!
"""It's Like The Plauge"".....the only ones stepping up are the ones with a ""vested interest"" in it....rent & past rent. Simon bought Forever 21 after noone else bid on the failing retailer....it was a disaster...now they're doing it again with Brooks Brothers. First check will be to pay past rent and penalties, 2nd check will be to pay past rent, 3rd check will be to pay past rent, 4th check will to pay current rent for empty store."
"I have no idea what this Barney guy is saying. All I know is I'm making money on Simon Stock especially adding up all the dividends I collected for the past year. 14 hours ago Barney makes a statement of borrowing billions, to build malls in spite of less foot traffic and it won't end well. Today the stock went up $3.25 dollars to 163.75. I guess SPG stock should be going down instead of up with all the negative statements that Barney is making."
"Due to delayed payments, empty malls, and all the debt. Why anyone would like to own it?"
"Not here to argue but just trying to understand the viability of shopping malls when so many are shopping online now. I guess people will be going back to the malls post COVID, but I’m thinking the novelty will wear off in a few months. I see so many bulls on here so would appreciate some feedback."
No turning back now. Corona moving further into our rear view. All the malls and stores are open. Should be a solid holiday season. I stand by my $100 year end.
are they still interested in buying Macerich ?
come on let's see that $90!
What is next support level from here?
Simon Property is up 8.76% to 81.24
"Cohn & steers and Blackrock together just added $5million shares of SPG. You can search the top shareholders to verify this. You sell cheap, they buy."
Simon will walk from the TCO deal. The market is telling us that.
Its time to load and crush these shorts in this guys
"Shares of the mall owner tanked more than 7% in after hours trading on Monday after reporting disappointing earnings. Simon Property Group reported earnings of 48 cents per share, compared to the estimated 90 cents per share, according to Refinitiv. The company made $994 million, missing estimates of $1.08 billion"
Major fight for 58...
90 is the fair value should be there by Friday.
"After SEARS, JC Penney, Target, and my personal fav....Macys, collapse, the Simons can then try to lease space to Big Lots, recycle dumps, Ollie's, and Kroger !"
If fastly is over 100 this is worth 200
i believe we will hit 150 in the next 12 months

RKT at $23 you are crazy to not buy it now! Just saying spg great company too. Let’s go
Oh really!!! While Barnacle continues to bad mouth Simon stock I'm making money. Every time it goes down I buy and then sell when it goes back up. Yesterday I made 200 today 80. Since January I've pocketed $3000. You know instead of yapping and saying nothing like Barney is doing all the time I take advantage of the declines to buy and sell.

Calvin Klein affiliated stores closings announced - 167. It just doesn't stop. Walking a mall will become depressing with every third store closed and no Anchor stores at each end :-(
Motley#fool article suggesting Taubman poor results could help Simon in their Court case that heads there next week. The article certainly wasn't written by a attorney. About the only thing he got right was they could agree to a break-up payment from Simon. They've already spent $18 million in attorney fees....guess Simon isn't such a stand up guy after...welching on a deal.
Is this thing going to hit 75$ eventually?

"I have been a commercial broker, specializing in retail, for 20+ years and malls are not ""dead"". Totally different situation now, obviously, vs. the great recession. However, even 11 years ago, I frequented several malls, including one in Atlanta (which was supposedly ""dead) while visiting for a wedding. I have also been taking the time to check the parking lots of malls in the areas I specialize in, which include Colorado, Utah, Idaho, and Northern/Southern California. On weekdays, these parking lots (especially in Utah and Colorado over the last 2 months) have been 75% - 85% full. On weekends, they have all been 100% full, with side streets packed with overflow. Yes, online shopping is here to stay and I, myself, am a Prime addict to a fault. However, there is an intrinsic value that shoppers place on visiting shopping centers. People want to get out, try on clothes, touch and see the items they're interested in...and don't discount the 'people watching' aspect of in-person shopping, especially at malls. This was all noted early on in Europe back in Feb. - April during some of the strictest lockdowns anywhere (besides China, of course). People were quoted as saying that they want to get out...to shop, to eat, to socialize, etc. and, most importantly, to spend their money! I can't speak for the east and midwest, but in the mountain states and west coast, driving and walking around over the last 60 days can be explained as ""business as usual"", especially in the mountain states. A vaccine/stimulus combo will set brick and mortar retail into a hyperdrive as never before seen...mark my word. As a side note, don't 'discount' bank stocks. Never in history has an economic recovery been possible without, you guessed it, banks. Borrowing, regardless of record low interest rates, has been off the charts, mainly for single family and multi-family purchases and new developments (just take a drive around the greater Denver and Salt Lake City markets and you will see more new apartment projects than you could ever even imagine...the next decade will be a market of renters (due to home pricing, lack of inventory, and those with less than stellar credit), along with first time home buyers...it began post great recession and is at warp speed now."

Is a dividend payout ratio of 125pct normal for a healthy REIT?
"SPG price is too low, they’re #1 in their industry, properties have been all reopened, I’m starting a position now..."
SPG Shareholders - My opinion is that SPG will be buying Taubman at the original agreed upon price. This looks familiar to the Dow Chemical & Rohm & Haas merger many years ago. Simon cannot make a statement about Covid and walk away.
Be careful out there today. Either sell at the open or wait 30 mins before making a buy.
Is Simon the first major mall company to be using those AR robots called roameos from AITX to patrol the malls and parking lots? Cool.
Wow! record volume of 2.7million shares.
should have added more by the dip!
New covid in uk coming here $mac $spg

If that dividend is for real that's 15% is a hell of a return on your money. I have a feeling that dividends will disappear.
I will be happy if the dividend only gets caught by half. Stock would probably go up on that news.
"Folks, I'm feeling real stupid because I'm confused due to various dates I've seen floating around. My question is when does SPG distribute it's div of $ 2.00 it had announced with an ex-div date of 6/15. I know they subsequently announced a cut to 1.30 but does that mean they changed from 2.00 to 1.30 for the shares held prior to ex-div of 6/15 ? Anyone shed light to clear my confusion ? Thanks."

what we thinking Q3 number will do to the stock?
"Please....let's get this straight. Amazon has zero interest in buying any malls. Amazon isn't interested in operating out of an ex anchor store that structurally wouldn't accommodate even the amount of weight of trucks needing to enter a re-purposed building. Prologis is one company that makes and leases these buildings to Amazon specs, if Amazon isn't the actual owner. Pumpers of the mall/Amazon mixed use need to do some legwork (due diligence) and actually go see the inside of some of these buildings. They're built with very few if any supporting columns as every one is an obstacle. If anything a mall would be bought for its land footprint and torn down to build a 500,000 sq foot or more purposed site. If, Amazon were ever to use a anchor store, it would only be a temporary lease during peak months. If you're going to buy this stock, and I'm not saying you shouldn't.....don't count on Amazon to be the answer to the empty anchor stores. gl"

Now what would happen if all these retail stores go out of business and the municipalities that collect property taxes will no longer get the taxes needed to run the government then what. Now along comes Amazon that takes causes this to happen what to you think they will do to Amazon?
Regeneron news is huge
Anyone feel like donating me some money so I can buy more spg shares? 2% interest per year matures 2024
"Assets SPG have are gems. Real estate will always prevail in the end. Always has and always will. E- Connerce will have its place and will affect brick and mortar but it’s not going away anytime soon. Buy the dips and be rewarded. Patience. Collect the dividend, even if it’s reduced and watch the stock appreciation over the next few years."
"That @oaresh has to point me out, announces that I do have an impact on rational investors that thought this was a ""Safe Dividend Play"" that we all know it is not."
Massive BEAT OF $1.26 to $0.96Occupancy was 90.8%
Market predict a decent dividend cut or Don't like JCP buyout
could Amazon buy out Simon?
$95.56 is what we neee to break. Then off to the races
SPG is down 9.27% to 59.69
6 weeks lockdown end of November
"I can spell frogasrep. what business of it is yours to know how many shares I have purchased. it seems to me that you are boasting. if you own 1 share or 100000 we are all in the same boat sadly to say, since the stock is at a somewhat low, all anybody who has share' s in this stock"
"As long as there are women in this world, there will always be malls. Ugly old men like Carl can only create ripples out of noise."
the problem is SPG broke its pattern after vax announcement I'm still trying to figgure out what's new normal
Foot Locker plunges 25%. Just another sign of the permanent decline in 'malls.'
Retail mall malaise.. that's what they call it. LULU bottom dropped out on stock. Yes they have 360 locations.
We now know the Dec 13th spike to $187.43 was a head fake to induce more shorting. They declared a bullish move hitting $187 which is why the MM let it ride that high because it now allowed them a quick 5% take down in the next 7 days. This won't go higher for several quarters now as more interest rate hikes are planned for 2018 than originally planned
"Okay. This is my opinion on the share dilution. Taubman Annual Diluted EPS pre-covid $3.32. Now SPG owns 80% of Taubman. Which gives us an addition Annual Diluted EPS of $2.65. SPG Annual diluted EPS pre-covid was $6.81. Add $2.65 gives us Annual Diluted EPS of $9.46. Now lets factor in share dilution. Total shares outstanding SPG 305 Million. Plus 20,125,000 new shares. That is an dilution of 6.6% to existing share holders. New Diluted EPS with taubman $9.46. Take away 6.6%. Gives existing shareholders $8.84 in EPS. An increase in EPS of $2.03! Way better than pre-covid levels!! So, there in no need to be bearish. This company is set to outperform as soon as this pandemic crisis ends!"
Close above $90. Get a piece
anyone buying this ?
any suggestion about dividend?
"not buying this until it reaches around 40-45$, dividend will for sure get wrecked"
as I said 85
Stock is waiting for dividend information before moving higher..IMHO
and tomorrow we will be up again..
David is a genius. So looking forward to the earnings call!
Just unloaded by extra 1000. Back down to 3k. SPG going to $150 fast and then $200 in 12 months.
Reopening won't help. Consumers won't visit Outlets
Buying the dips and making $. Enjoy the ride up all!
Best stock in the portfolio today I’m loving it keep going Simon you’re doing beautiful
"Today, Simon's Board of Directors declared a $1.30 per common share dividend, payable in cash, for the second quarter 2020. The dividend will be payable on July 24, 2020 to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 10, 2020. The Company expects to pay at least $6.00 per share in common stock dividends for 2020, in cash, subject to Board of Directors approval."
Overall I think we will see upside for SPG in the short-term. Perhaps a pullback next day or so could occur I suppose but are yall also seeing a further leg higher? I started receiving notifications from aw-esomeSTOCKS the other week and so far they have presented interesting new trade ideas.
vaccine is approuve (bntx/pfizer)
It's going to 75 next week and then dip back to 70 week after.
Capitulation
up soon
it is finally time to buy with both hands kidos dont miss out a once in liftime chance.
Patience. SPG. MAC. SKT.
Likes the 54ish level today
Think I missed it too. Going up 15% in hope the economy is opening but a few people catch covid and they’ll close just as fast
"thoughts on O collecting over 90% rent and killing projections? what's the impact on Simon with regards to market sentiment? if Simon comes in at 90% collection, does it rally?"
Pelosi says Congress stays in session until Stimulus bill passed. Game of chicken now with McConnell keeping Senate in session. Look at #BLMN if you believe #SPG is taking over premium mall space....#BLMN comps and going forwards are running on all cylinders. Next Q will show management very upbeat and sales higher on competition that have gone bankrupt. gl
I really like the fact SPG is putting TESLA charges in. I have now used quite a few give me a 1/2 hour to cruise around the mall. I have actually bought quite a few things that I wouldn't have shopped for.
It's going to be smoked. Look at downfall like 2008-09
Normal pricing. Do your research. Buy the dip. Going way higher
Joe I just think your overly pessimistic... almost unrealistically
NOT PUMPING JUST SAYING THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THIS STOCK IN ONE YEARS TIME SHOULD BE IN THE 160-180 AREA.
Target proves retailers who adapt and have aKiller drive up hybrid model are winning.
It's probably going to pass $80 today. Wonder when Joe wakes up tomorrow will probably faint again... XDFainting Joe
Love this company and stock but I cannot see the real rebound starting till we have Covid19 under control. It is currently far from that. I'll prob buy some anyway.
Watch next Quarter....you're going to witness massive store revenue losses on lost $600/wk unemployment checks! Consumers just now awakening to fact they're living paycheck to paycheck.
Simon Property is up 13.60% to 64.97
Burn shorty burn. 57 is 50 day sma Going to retrace 50 percent of old High after earnings. 80 plus per share. Great real estate. Short term hiccups.

Do I need to purchase right now or its too late ?
"Wow, this is heading to 54ish."
"I was going to pick up some SPG , after the company successfully screwed TCO (IS ONLY BUSINEES, NOTHING PERSONAL). I sold TCO.Lucky I did not. Or I would get screwed too. I bought PFE instead.Now, I wait until SPG price drops below $72.50 from $79. Wow.Is business."
I told the board. Hope you all listened. It’s still not too late. Buy any dip to $150

"Couple of interesting conflicting arguments on this board (shocking, I know.) On one side, malls are dead, virus was the final nail in the coffin, after Amazon, walmart.On the other, they are sitting on some very coveted properties, can they repurpose or repopulate the stores?I air on the side of a long term bull on the stock, but think there are real short term headwinds that will keep pinning this down until there is a real all clear for people to go back out. Even if that is on June1, I dont see people rushing out in drove sto the mall, despite being stir crazy and needing contact. The government will continue to porp up the markets, but there will definitely be drops and I vbeliev another opportunity for long term holders to get in at a better price than currently. I wouldnt be surprised seeing 50/ 55 retested over the next week. Good luck to y'all..."
When is earnings?
"MACY'S had another lousy Christmas. What happened to the superior merchandiser ? And to think, Macy's results occurred during low unemployment, low interest rates, and economic growth.Simon says malls are toast."
"Where I am, I'm back at the gym, went to a restaurant, malls are as busy as ever, the lake is packed with summer guests, hair salons are open, business seems to be back to normal. I wouldnt expect it to take long for REITs to recover. $BPY $SPG"
"get out when you can... after high tech, next wave for properties are coming... I learnt my lesson and got out late for some high tech one...with high loan borrow rate and interest rate, there would be impact on real-estate... if you check the business, I can't see the revenue growth for this one other than rental (some some retailers got hit hard as well due to borrow rate increase). If they wanted to build more malls, every cost (labor, loan rate, material rate) would all go up... just feel the valuation is high for this one..."
This will be $100 within month
Sold 145 put today. Guess I won't get stock.
"This stock sucks! Expect a dividend CUT !All the best, Brad"
Squeeze in the AM to $65
sold again at 145 but this stock for sure below 100 when market crashed
SPG short term bottom is around 145.
Silly message board from some. SPG got JCP for a steal - pennies to the dollar. they also know that malls are coming back and Gen X children (the generation behind millennials) are storming back to malls in droves because they see how zombified their parents and aunts/uncles are on the stupid computer and shopping sites all of the time. SPG knows - this new generation really wants to get OUTSIDE!!!!! Smart! very smart - just buy SPG and go long. Just my opinion.
SPG reached a 52 Week low at 134.71
Simon Property is up 13.24% to 60.13
Simon Property Price Target Cut to $50.00/Share From $120.00 by CFRA
@jake ....Simon has no target or Walmart anchors....and theaters in 2008-2010 still did great business and I can't think of any national big name brand that was in mall to go bankrupt. I'm just stating facts....2008 is NOTHING like 2020/2021
Bottoms today fyi
Breaking out as moron trolls bash
When will the Dividend cut be announced ?
WOW a $50 drop in the PPS just because of the threat of the drop in interest rates. Well since late July we have had 1 increase of 0.25% Just imaging how far this will fall when we get another one in early 2017. We'll probably lose another $50 by June
Spy Bears are so dumb $aapl can go to 80-90 in weeks ahead but 90% of non tech sectors can easily bounce 30% in weeks as election fake fud fades and as a vaccine or regeneraon comes online with the spy still up crushing your permabear #$%$ $xom $spg $amzn - so many sectors like reits and energy at generational buys
you think this will pop on PfizerFDA news?
$SPG will never let AMC go under. These prices are insane for new longterm investors.
Wow - $85 to $70 in a few days. Surprised. Still hitting $100 by eoy
John is getting hammered! Buy the dips all the way back to $150

Amazon confirms itsComing to neighborhoods
Take the 220 million penalty and move on without Taubman Centers. Simon?
Waiting on $124 to unload my extra 1k. Feeling over exposed. C’mon SPG!
I hate you @Joe
When is the ex dividend date? No one mentioned on the call yeasterday...
where is my dividend?
I think the reason why it was down was due to Bed bath beyond and V secrets closing stores.
A new seeking alpha article mentioned SPG offered $95 to buy MAC before. MAC has the best malls. MAC gained 700% in one year after 2009 financial crisis. It may do the same this time as well.
All companies took loan but simons gave dividend
I don't understand why this is not in the 70's
MAC earning beat expectation.
These low prices will only last so long. Buy the dips. Here’s a map of states reopening:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html
Easy $. Just bought more
Bought 12/18 $80 Put and $75 Puts I think it will level off at low $50 or high $40 then I am a buyer! Everything else the Dividend will continue to attract investors but the little guys will suffer in the short term but if you hold for the long hole you will be paid off with the dividend but you will to wait for several years! YIKES
Once again a gift
Is 90$ still a good entry point ? Thinking about buying some but dont want it to Heavily drop in 1 week
I almost sold 1/2 of my positions yesterday to move into AMT but didn’t want to take any loss no matter how small it was. Too bad and too late.
I think the market selling is very one taking profits so they did have taxes on the books for this year
@Joe I am beginning to think that you have some puts calls at @40 and they expiring soon wiping you out dogs!
"Hope is not a strategy ! These malls will remain empty for months.Simon will run out of cash to keep feeding them. All the best, Brad."

Wait until they announce the dividend cut of 50%.
SPG will report earnings on 10 august. Expect something about rent not being paid to have significant impact. The % paid is the main number I will be looking at.
Powell spooked the markets.
What is goimg after hours Friday? It sinked almost 2% 
They should be announcing their dividend within the next week or so. Wouldn't that be something if they didn't reduce it?
"This stock is for , well let’s just say a lot of carnage still to come. Don’t hold it for a dividend. You will lose all ur capital. Put you money in pork bellies, can’t lose."
Today's market is just incomprehensible. Such companies as Beyond Meat are valued at half the value of SPG. I just give up even trial to understand it. You just have to follow
"just because you pay a lawyer , CEO, or director a ton of money doesn't mean they are any good. my opinion"

I think it will drop more before it goes up. The tariff talk and Buffett saying he has over half his money waiting for a fall this weekend will make many investors pull out and drop the market more.

"Morgan Stanley Lifts Simon Property Group to Overweight. Price Target raised to $125 From $88.Also Simon Property Group is now directly involved in retail companies, making investments in struggling chains like Forever 21, Brooks Brothers and JC Penney. SPG now has an e-commerce business that does $3.5B in digital sales... which allows them to do vertical integration from online sales to brick/mortar delivery. That is pretty good to drive overall valuation and PE multiple."

"Traditional buyers of #SPG & REIT'S were dividend junkies....now, they're finding out dividends aren't any good if you lose 50% of principal. This is now a trade, and mom and pops are either out of these type of buys or bagholders."
Simon is the king we have taubmann we have jc penny amazon tenant. we have all of them.
it's going up! Life is good
"What are you all thinking???I wouldn’t invest in the malls, what with all the riots and the mayhem.."
The momentum is upside. Robinhood crows are buying SPG big time. It closed almost at the high of the day suggests it will rise more next week. It will hit par (100) before any pull back.
"Finish Line plunges 15%. It's all part of the secular decline in retail mall sales. Simon can sputter alone collecting rent from the unfortunates who signed leases. Eventually, those leases must face steep rate declines. Try collecting rent from your bankrupt tenants, Radio Shack for instance, and very soon, SEARS. I wonder if the wise guy Simons are secretly plowing cash into Amazon stock with their own private accounts ?"
WHY QUESTION SIMON? WE GAIN 25 MILLION FT OF A VERY HIGH END MALL CONSOLIDATE AND ADD AT LEAT 3% GOING FORWARD TO FFO.
Wow......big trend down Today for this Retailer!!
Do you know how long the line will be on Black Friday ?
The bears are dumbies here lol...4.1 billion in cash SPG sits on with 4 billion in other liquid assets lol....with collecting 1/3 rent this business can survive any short term pandemic! lol Ill see you bears at 200 SP and be relaxing in two years!

"A lot of talk that tax loss selling is now ~30 days in the past. Those that sold for tax loss, are now able to repurchase. If you look at the Charts, majority of tax selling appears to have started around Dec 16th onward. Correlates nicely to the support the last few days. This was a smart move for those that sold as they are able to ride the wave back up in 2021. Time for the REIT recovery (not specific to HR)$SPG $MAC $BPY $BXP $ARE $FRT $KIM $ALX $WPC"

"Actually here in Europe, a major part of the people is going back out to do shopping. Except the old people who are in more danger. And the consumption of those younger people in drinks, clothing, small stuff exploded in recent weeks. That's the reason I buy SPG - top A locations where I also like to go shopping.The balance sheet of SPG is pretty strong. Ofcourse it's going to have an impact and SPG might in the short term have to settle for less rent."

lets see now SPG worth 45BAmzn worth 530B That's right 530 Billion. So Simon stock is valued about 9% of AmznLike comparing a peanut to a watermelon.
Excellent!!! the 4 malls they are giving up are the junk ones Mr Simon said the didnt care about perfect... Getting the deal done with Taubman at such a juicy discount even better hahaha i love it that Mr Simon only had to spend 18 million in legal fees to save 800 million... SPG has 9 billion in cash and 80-90% rents coming in...if the whole USA shutsdown for 6 months SPg WILL BE STILL BE AROUND WITH CASH ON HAND!!! Best investment I ever made...not selling any not buying any all my money is in..CHEERS!

holly molly glad I bought this monday!!
"Let me tell you a couple of thoughts. SPG is the biggest and strongest (size and financial stability) REIT. Big deep pocket boys/girls understand it. The stock lost 70% from it is very recent level. In the pother words an upside is huge (100-150%). What those crooks are doing now? They are controlling the price while accumulating shares. How low they can drop a stock? Who knows but I doubt they can do it below 45. Move up as always will be fast, starts between sessions (say ""suddenly"" opens 10-15% up) and then within 3-5 trading days a price can be almost doubled e.g. from 45-50 to 80-90. If it is a case what a difference does it make if you buy it for 55 or 50 or even 45 (I doubt 45 is reachable). Gain will be huge and fast anyway. From a TA point of view the stock is not oversold i.e. there is some room for a lower numbers. In general the market went up ahead of itself, ahead of economy recovering. Many stocks already overbought i.e. a certain correction is still probable before the next leg up. For the time being I'm day trading SPG with a small profit. Last buy was 53.93 sevelal minutes ago."
What is a prospect supplement related to potential three part note offering-SEC filing??
Just sold the extra 1000. Back to 3k
Dividend for Q2 is $1.30 and at least $6.00 for year 2020.
Every REIT company posted a loss in the middle of a pandemic but SPG turned a profit. Imagine how much money they make when there is no pandemic.
Well what do U know Trading professor. So far it's going the wrong way for you. IS it time to load up? No not yet you say? Yes for TP it is very bearish not just bearish but very bearish so when it was down to 158+ I kept thinking what TP said so I waited to see if it would trade below 158 but so far It hasn't

"OK, so considering many brokerages charge $0 to buy and sell. What's the difference between buying a growth stock (if you need the income) every quarter selling off 1 or 2% of the shares (no fees) and paying 20% capital gains tax rate on that versus buying a dividend stock and getting the dividends and paying 22% tax rate on the dividends?"
"Yes the option puts of July $40 make sense, there are a lot of selling pressures as the volume of traffic in couple of month will be dismal."

What was the div rate b4 the crash? I am ok with $5.2 for now living off the ramen on sale ....
let me buy at $60..
A little profit taking and consolidation back to 50 DMA. All reits are doing this today. We'll regroup and head higher in the next few weeks. Great buying opp here at these discounted levels.
"Asset $32B, Debt $28BExcessive PE @ 25XFed raising rates 0.25% every 90 days making SPG harder to finance its debt obligations.Big box stores closing left and right...Other than the dividend, there seems to be no reason to buy this stock. As saving rates rise, the demand for ""dividend income"" stock like SPG will fall.Somebody explain to me why SPG isn't < $120 ?"
in my opinion... SPGs capital expenditures was buying in a down market with cash they had saved. all they need to do is capitalize on new volume potential.
Look for the break out about $94 and we run to $100 fast
"Whew what a morning. Quick slide to $US60, typical day in #SPG land. But half a day's typical volume in the first 90min of trading distinguishes this move from usual hi beta we've become accustomed to. This has teeth. Analysts have backed off entirely. Yes, large institutional positions in place but(1) they have been wrong before(2)they rebalance quarterly, not on a dime...Finally, there has been no buying by insiders since May...I see support Dow 25k, #SPG$US40-- where I would get long for long. Which, these daze, could be done by Friday."

Gap up 36% this month. They better pay rent fast or SPG gonna boot them!

Good luck with all that! No chance!
"I think its dropping because of dividends news is over, dividends chasers sold the stock to move to a new one...it can also be attribute to the stimulus news.But i believe its more related to the dividend chasers...Do I believe in spg absolutely, we should hit 80% soon!"

any thoughts on the $115 call this Friday? Any chance it can expire out of money?
Our eps was still over $2 !!!! In Q2 was only .98 cents haha what an improvement the stock should be $95 easy on this news..so what if we missed by .20 cents we are still double Q2

$CBL getting ready to  off. Grab rn in AH or be sorry Monday.

There is a ton of big money buying in. Who has billions to invest in a business that they would fully understand? Maybe a duo called Buffett and Munger? What happens to SPG stock price if news gets out that BRKB took a big stake in SPG? To the moon Alice!
I know retailers with a similar portfolio as SPG and they collected 40% of the rent.And the shares of that stock tanked with 30%; after that I took a position.It is a big risk.
"More states are lifting restrictions, and that means more malls will be open for Business."
sold 50 shares in after hours at 159.63
"make no senses to have 28% up today while other retailers were down.... anyway, I am happy and sold my shares to take profits."
If the market collapses you can be rest assured Amazon will go down 200 dollars a share
"When it comes to stocks... There are 3 phases this year. Pre-COVID-19, COVID-19 period, Post-COVID-19.This is the time to invest Post-COVID-19 stocks not going backward like JOE. I invested and planned beforehand. Unlike Joe, which stuck in the past.JOE is a negative person on this board. I wonder how much he is going to loose for looking backward."
"A little normal profit taking, buy the dips guys, this is steadily gonna rise to $100"
GREAT CC. DIVIDEND STRONG EARNINGS BEAT SETTING THE FOUNDATION FOR EARNINGS GROWTH NEXT YEAR. STRONG FINANCIALS. CAN GROW WITHOUT ISSUEING NEW SHARES!! CEO SAID THE STOCK IS UNDER VALUED AND I AGREE!
@paresh....what about the $10 BILLION PER WEEK not flowing to 23 million recipients?....Retail apocalypse staring you right in the face and you're in complete denial.
"Mall traffic is getting close to normal around me. Even the JCPenney was busy. Outdoor malls are the best and SPG has the cream of the crop in their portfolio. And the ""Mills"" malls across the country are major attractions."
"SPG doesn't have ""sales""....they have rental income that pays dividend....rentals are mostly in Court or Bankruptcy proceeding. Beware retail investors!"
Upgrades coming for sure!
Some people say malls are dead. Wrong wrong wrong. Malls are packed and took me a while to park my car. Malls arent dead and never will
MAC is up today。 buy MAC. Forget about SPG。 SPG is too slippery.
"Technically:17 of june 2020 there was a sell signal on the MACD, this has not changed yet. The RSI is at 43 and sloping down (nobody is interested). Money flow is slightly up, so even though nobody wants to buy there's still a bit of buying going on. The downtrend is still ongoing and there hasn't been a trend change.Just under 50 USD there's a level that has been tested 3 times that hasn't been broken. If you are patiened and you don't care about ''missing the boat'', just sub 50 USD should be on your radar."
Looks like good chance to buy. It will go up to 150.Just don't know how long it will take.
This company manage the majority of malls and outlets of USA so assets are huge here
They will suspend the dividend
"Anyone who ""calculates the yield"" and buys on the basis of yield is a fool.This mall business is no longer a viable business. People are shopping at home. All the best, Brad."
Any news ?
"a couple of thinks. 1. there are 11,000 open intrest options calls for 85 for nov 20. 2. if moderna announces 95% vax it could shoot up on monday. 3. but the lock downs could really push the stock lower because of more companies going bankrupt.I find it odd SPG is spending billions on new companies while letting other debts default."
Toys R TOAST ! It's not just the stores in jolly ol' England that are shutting down now. More holes in Simons growing vacancy lists !!
I think this recovery is going to take longer than we expect. All the money is in tech. We need retail to buy the stock.. spg you snail move ffs
Will buy 500 shares tomorrow! This will be $150 by mid 2021!
Look for a break above $121 and change. Then it’s free to run to $150

Do you guys think Simon will increase its dividend in the mid of next year?
What’s going on with the dip?
I think these will give Simon a strong opportunity to reimagine mall anchor stores in a way they couldn’t before. They have an established and well liked brand JCP and I think this is the best play available to turn around the business at their properties. The alternative is to start something new...I like the JCP play but you have to imagine that SPG will do it right. I THINK THEY WILL!
Anyone who didn't see this drop coming hasn't been watching this stock for very long.
"Lets use some common sense here. Just downgraded by Moodys for its outlook. Social quarantine extended until April 30. Cheesecake Factory says they cant pay their rents. ..Insider buying aside, who in their right mind would TOUCH this stock right now?Yes, malls may make a comeback, way down the line. But there is an easy 30% down from here in the short term. This could get ugly. And then some."
Ok who sold at 47.. Go ahead an confess
spg is already bankrupt not sure who is still buying
Earnings 5/10 - be long. Break to the upside
Serious convo here. Do bears not see yet that Simon is setting up the company big time here buying bk assets on sale?? Also many of you are clueless. Each brand they bought has online ecommerce businesses. Thats right SPG is by default an online business now. And these brands are also sold at other online stores. Hint:Load up before othersGet it
"NKLA, is now a publicly traded company.NKLA, is a manufacturer of electric trucks, NKLA, hasover $10 billion in advance orders. SPG, could offerperipheral Mall sites to NKLA, for showrooms?NKLA, will rival Tesla to be the market leader in truckspowered by electricity.."
"This will go to 100 and then 120 shortly. Will be staying around for the massive dividends! Honestly we could even see a massive near term/mid term bounce back in retail demand due to everyone being stuck at home, and stock could climb to new highs. Great management as well, can't go wrong here folks!"
"Shorties getting killed, lol"
"I thought the ER was pretty decent and plans to open locations seem promising. I've been eyeing SPG for several months and finally opened an initial position today, investing about half of what I'd like to. I'll invest more if it dips further, but for a company managing such premium properties, you can't go wrong at a bargain price of $55 or lower."

Oh my....where is @Michael and all the other children at today?
"Brick & Mortar stores' stock prices have gone thru the roof due to short squeeze. This has made retail stores financially more viable, and hence stronger commercial tenants for SPG. Dillard stock has gone from $25 to $81, Macy's gone from $5 to $15, #$%$ sporting goods from $16 to $60... and the names go on. This phenomenal development will made SPG's cashflow more viable than ever before. I predict Monday's earnings announcement to be good, but more importantly, a blockbuster outlook for 2021. My expectation is that SPG will hit $120 in next 30-60 days.....Enjoy the ride, longs!!"

I am getting exhausted by SPG which I bought for high $50s during the height of the lockdown whereby the price shot up to $80 quickly before fading back down to $60 today. Very disappointed with this stock and I am now considering selling. Any thoughts?
SPG reached a 52 Week low at 93.40
It's over extended. Be safe here.
"SEARS and Kmart closing even more stores #$%$ plunge. It's reverse psychology, consumers will flock to the remaining SEARS stores, before it's too late to shop at a fallen retail relic ?!"
60 bucks undervalued that is what is crazy. So much opportunity here
This new strain of Coronavirus from UK is fake news.
"To say that Simon's move is to try to #$%$ a better deal with a lower price with TCO makes a lot of sense. But then, if so, why doesn't Simon also express an intention to buy up another competitor, say MAC? That would add incentive to TCO to lower the price."
"tenants are not paying rent, foot traffic is down, hospitalization rate is picking... not good time for retail, better off wait till mid 2021 for the picture to clear. premature vaccine optimism does nothing for the company cash flow position"

"CIBC Report on REITS came out Feb 3.HR Outpeform2021 $1.75 FFO Estimate2021 39% FFO Payout 2022 $1.83 FFO EstimateThe 2021 39% FFO Payout Ratio is screaming distribution increase. Price to FFO and AFFO is one of the highest discounts of the Canadian REITS and heavily oversold. It is expected to outperform the market and narrow the GAP with other great names. HR maintains one of the smallest impacts due to COVID (2020 about 5% earnings hit) and returns to growth in 2021 onward. Yet the units trade at a massive discount. $15 would still make HR incredibly cheap around 8.6x Price to 2021 FFO. $18 would be around 10.29 Price to 2021 FFO (more in line with today's market discount)The unit price pressure is up. Good reporting by AP.UN continues to show how durable Canadian REITs have been and how incredibly oversold HR is. $18 / unit puts HR on a similar discount to other REITs on a P/FFO for 2021. At under $15, HR is incredibly cheap.Do your own research and invest wisely.I am proudly holding long.$BPY $BXP $SPG"
SPG should buy CBL)
Trump hasnt helped reits!!
Poor @J is getting BURNT today.
Looks a like a retest of $51 is coming
Orlando 75 million people who will like to shop at our malls.
I know im gonna get a lot of flack here but this thing is going to retest the lows. Its a shame cause I thought we where gonna break out. Covid-19 is surging back in the early states that opened. Mostly because its hot and there all together in placed with the ac on no mask etc. GL I'll be back in at below $40.
"This stock going up is nuts. Corona cases are spiking all over the place. It is inevitable that states will have to close down, again. Even Texas' governor is admitting, so."
Great company! Long and strong! Hold and you’ll be rewarded!
With every mall that opens this inches back to pre crash prices

Man this thing has pretty big percentage swings every day. Day traders loving it. Me not so much bought in at 53 long
Sold this bought in 60-70 range and still think it goes higher but buying China beat up names good luck
Volume has just DISAPPEARED...... Danger Will Robinson.....Danger!
Any Simon Malls in Texas?.....first State to break coronovirus records. Be careful next 3 months.
wished I had 10k shares to retire on 10k x $5.2 = $52k dividend annually. I could eat expiring tuna and ramen on sale
MAC is poorly run AND losing money
Dividend eliminated
Buffett sells WMT and vows to avoid tough business of retail. Simons would be lucky if their debt heap malls are used as gigantic recycling caverns for all the worthless consumer junk bought from Asia over the last 45 years! I laugh as my AMZN rises and retail malls fail.
This is going over $500 soon !!!
"ready to go. Barney and Chad, it's your chance now to own Simon stock"
Pumper the snowflake? You are melted or what?
Spg... hasnt made any big moves in months... Ffs.

Look out below tomorrow. You can thanks the Chinese for discount prices in the market again.
Retail sales rocking!
What's another 50 to 80 SEARS closures to the mighty Simons ?!

Tangible book value is only $7.00. Why is SPG at $63?
They covered keeping divvy at near levels by not buying Taubman. Smart management making up for a bonehead buyout will propel this upward.
Why its falling off a cliff

What is happening to this stock today???
Hi ya all. Did you buy Simon stock at the low of 150.5 and now it's 155.3? Almost a 5 dollar gain I see.
Patience is a virtue- buying the dips all day
More discounts on the horizon. Don’t rush yourself jumping into this stock at current price. It will free fall another 6% from here on.
"ANF plunges 15% today, and is well below the $84 high in 2007.Abercrombie & Fitch is just another retail peddler who cannot seem to ever get their mojo back. Amazon exceeded $2000 per share this week. (smirk)"
Great day Simon going to 90 the fair value and then much higher with all the asset purchases.
"Best Buy, Urban Outfitters, and Under Armour all deeply in the red this morning. Hey maybe Santa Claus will save the mall traffic this year ?! Oh wait, that gets worse every year!"
Peer review study coming out tomorrow showing 40% of most EU cases are a new strain of coronovirus. Just fyi......
I don't see how Simon can pay the 14% dividend and still buy Taubman in July for 4 billion. One of these have to give in here. Maybe both.
This week Real Estate will dominate gains. Buy while prices are still dirt cheap.
Real estate still way overpriced especially with economy in the state it is in now.
"I understand that there is a fair amount of risk with any stock you buy but... this company owns a solid portfolio of assets. While the struggle to return will remain for some time, property is something that history shows is in demand. When it dips, it is one of the fastest recovering investments. This stock seems to be worth $68-$82 based on market conditions and their asset value."
"Christmas with the crumbs.Macy's plunges 18% today.Fast Eddie is holding 50,000 SEARS people as human shield for his attempt to 'save' a zombie corporation."
Over $200 to $60. Prime properties. Dividend. Even with cut. Homerun. $100 by end of year.
Sawgrass mall is packed! shopping is booming in Florida. People are people and do what they always do. Shop shop. Simon group are well positioned
Dillards was slammed at the Simon n e mall in n richland hills texas yesterday
Did SPG miss the Q1 2020 dividend? There should have been a payout in May 2020. There was one on Feb 2020 that was for Q4 2019. Now they are going to announce Q2 2020 in June. So what happened to Q1 2020?Everyone keeps talking about Q2 2020. What happened to Q1 2020?
"If they go forward and buy TCO....SPG will take another 15% + haircut, Dividend will be cut no matter...These maLLS WILL HAVE PROBLEMS GETTING TENANTS, GETTING FULL RENT, AND BE HARD TO FINANCE ....UNTIL VIRUS ISSUE DISAPPEARS."
"Anyone ever see a ""micro distribution hub"".....not pretty....and not profitable as ""anchor"" stores. Don't be fooled by these constant fairytales of (prior premium) of empty space ever going back to being immensely profitable. JCPenny got a 2 week reprieve and Simon might even become the Landlord and tenant....wouldn't that be self destructive!!"
wow 117
"short squeeze coming, still cheap here!"
Buy it when it’s hated and be rewarded long term
glad I am out with small loss
Mall owner #PRIET gets default notice from Bank (Wells Fargo).....only receiving 53% of rents due.
Don’t believe malls are dead...was just in a Simon mall over weekend and it was packed...buying online is convenient but people like the experience of multiple stores on one place and place to go with family or friends ....I don’t see all negativity here....Simon has top malls in the best areas in country....in early June this shot up to $90 on limited news imagine when there really is a vaccine
"Hammer it home again...#WPM, #RGLD, #AUY....first 2 are near all time record highs. $1-3 trillion in more debt stimulus. Not good for $USD short term or long term."

"CFRA still says sell lol ""While the lower price saves SPG approximately $800 million, we are still negative on the transaction as it further entrenches SPG into the shopping mall, a retail format we think will continue to decline and face numerous headwinds.

"Steady, steady, steady grind down once again today on low volume....Funds selling to retail schmucks, meanwhile #SPG overseeing #JPM slow death, rents not paid and Taubman lawsuit still in ether."
"Simon's stock will end up like CBL's stock.It ain't coming back. This is the end. Don't buy it. All the best, Brad."
The National Retail Federation forecasts retail sales will grow between 6.5% to 8.2% to more than $4.33T in 2021 as more individuals get vaccinated and the economy reopens.

"Strong Q4 earnings and continued dividend payments. However, FY21 EPS forecasted to grow 25% YoY, with occupancy at over 91%. This is great recovery compared to last year. Would be great to see the forecasted growth translating into Stock price upward momentum!!"
"Look guys, starbucks beat the earnings for Q3. SPG is good. Buy SPG before too late.It means people are out shopping and drink coffees."
"SPG saves a lot of companies during this quarter. If you look a lot of companies would be bankrupt, but SPG jumps in to save them. Like JCPENNY, a lot of retails owes SPG thanks. Soon or later these retails will pay rent with premium for SPG and loyalty. Vaccine is coming. It’s your pick of stocks. Crab head Joe will be wrong again."
Simon-owned JCP kicks out their CEO and installs a chief investment officer( baby sitter). The JCP locations are turned to Amzn DC's/retail store hybrids.
"Very low volume, pumping into September/October months. I'm not long or short #SPG in any way. My take is that this is nothing like 2008....Online purchasing and mass bankruptcy by anchor tenants have totally changed dynamics of 2008 era. In 2008, 3% of total U.S. sales (minus gas, autos, etc) were online...about $200 billion. 2020 online sales to reach between $800 billion to $1 trillion. You can stick your head in sand or look out your window and watch multiple delivery trucks delivering goods numerous times a day, 7 days a week. #SPG will do OK in future, but the glory days are long gone folks."

One of these days I’ll sell at 68 to re buy at 62 the next day. Of course if I did that it would probably never come back down lol
It’ll be up another $10 tomorrow if not more.DO NOT SELL

"Just watch this stock SPG. I hear rumors that this is next Robinhood stock, If that is true, this will become a tech stock since they can host servers and all kinds of stuff with the real estate they have even if the malls may be fading. This is also like TSLA where institutional ownership is very small and hence there is no hype from investment companies. I would not be surprised if that happens."
"Look at what happened to FB. It went down over $8 a share yesterday, They day will come when Amzn will tank at least 200 or more a share."
where is my dividend money?
"Balance sheet concern: Total asset value 32 Billion, 24 Billion in debt is a major concern. Sector concern: Amazon slaughtering everything out there. People buy clothes online, try it out, return it at no charge if they want to. Why go to mall? Yes SPG owns premium outlets, but most people go there for window shopping, then buy the same thing online afterwards for 10% off the cost.Macro-concern: Fed raising interest rate 25 basis point/90 days, long term Fed fund rate stands at 3+ % about 2X it is today.Only day traders hold these stocks, never intending to hold'em for long because volatility is so big, which traders like.As long term investors, I want to see this stock go down to low $100's before pulling the first trigger.Limit order at $120, $110, $100's. We'll see what's next."

"I love how Joe hates SPG. Shorts it daily, buys puts and now, magically ends up with shares at $72.00 thats he’s happy with because his broker bought them for him. Go figure. Supposedly we were going to hit $62.00/share, but now $72.00 is such a good buy. This is what liars and manipulators such as Joe do, they’ll say just about anything and do the opposite."
Simon Property is up 6.90% to 110.15
Anyone short this stock is insane. They made a great decision in buying JCP. Look at market cap history for JCP. Look at the people involved in saving this store. Look at the strategy of keeping this anchor store! Also consider if a Macey’s closes...they can fill the spot with JCP! Good decision. They just need to turn it around and I think Simon can.https://www.marketcaphistory.com/jcp/
"FFO is below expectation. But collected 85% rent in Q3. With vaccine coming, no more lock downs."

"they are buying the distressed assets cheap. and it's not a bail out, they are only buying the assets not the debt. actually very smart..... they just need to close the stores not in their mall."
i am at one of Simon’s mall and it’s packed. There was long line at Coach in it. Mall isnt dead especially the Simon ones
Shopping and retail centers are picking up traffic. I've been noticing this locally as well. This is positive for retail REITs $BPY $SPGhttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4356538-strong-traffic-registered-malls-and-outlet-centers?source=intbrokers_regular

"My average buy price is $90/share. Do you think this stock will cross 90$ this month, so that I can make some money?"
I think it's time to sell simon at a loss I don't think it will ever go above 200
SPG was one of the 10 most profitable shorts in the market in 2020. Now lets see if the shorts win on this one this year.
"Y’all ever think about how much money in real estate they’re sitting on? That’s a main reason why theyre not going anywhere for a few years. People love malls too, it’s a way to get out and actually feel productive when shopping."

"This is a solid REIT , these are bargain prices"
Back to $61 now. We all know this happens all the time
100$ before you know it 
this is really perfect stcok for day trade..i dont care about dividend
"seems the JCPENNEY purchase is not bad for SPG and they did a good job negotiating. Naysayers say your piece as always. I'm long and thinking of increasing position if it drops further. won't sell but plan is to hold for years to see what happens. am done with being scared out only to see things double or triple after sharp scary drops that scare people out. people will still go to malls and if this pandemic subsides, may take a year it two, SPG will recover. how can you see other people just ordering online. people are social animals and like to congregate"
"SPG And the whole sector is down, should you sell right at the bottom? SPG is the largest REIT in the world that they make you broke, I don't worry. I worry about companies that are still on the stock exchange that go bankrupt. Real estate, gold, silver are the best long-term deposits. I am collecting riding stocks from dividends I buy new positions. Bank sector has cut dividends for years. REIT It's my #$%$ but it's coming back."
"4.7% dividend yield is a skull and cross bones sign of impending trouble. The market knows malls are in secular decline. The Simons of Indianapolis have yet to grasp reality, but they do grasp excessively large pay checks every month."
today is legit crazy
Why is SPG so down today ?
About Urban Outfitters. The rents are coming down.
SPG reached a 52 Week low at 101.73
"Market is expecting the worst and SPG is collapsing, the qtrly. dividend will be slashed to 25 cents.The short term is awful for SPG, it will take 2-3 years for the stock to go back to the pre corona valuation of $150.Get ready to hear a 'dirge' this afternoon, it's going to be ugly."
"Just love stocks that beat estimates, beat forecast and raise their dividend and get hammered for it. Makes no Freaking sense. This stock should be in the $240's at least right now. Oh I forgot about manipulation, It's okay then. I forgot the shorts got burned by the good news so they have to hit it hard to make it look like it was a bad quarter, I get it now. I can't wait for the next run up, it will be strong. Shorts suck!"
get out when you can... treasure bond is at 1.5%... inflation is coming...there is no way for outlet mall property going up with fixed rental income
entire market is going into reversion. Not just REITs.
"Had it not been for the overall market sell off especially in the final hour of trading, SPG would’ve closed green and probably around $60."
Nice call Josh Brown...lol
Viac and spg all risk priced in zero reward.... yet
Too many fear mongers on this board. They presenting false statements unsubstantiated links. Everything will go back to normal and America economy will be vibrant.
My re-entry point - $60. Nothing changed for me and just as last time I will get that price. Sold at $71 and now buy order submitted for $60. Within two weeks I should get my price target once again.

Feeling blessed. I panicked Monday thinking the Military might take out the Biden Fraudsters and dumped 1500 shares Monday. Did more research and bought back 2500 Tues AM. Keeping those Five Large in the drawer. SPARC will be a monster. Tubman accretive. COVID healing ... Add it up. $16.00 FFO 18 months out. 70% Payout = $2.80 per quarter Dividend. $186.00 at 6% yield.

I'll will keep buying all the way down to $100. Need some good dividend stocks
It’s a gift getting it under $70

spg stands stronger than pre pandemic.. patience and you will get rewarded 
at least up 20% tomorrow
These guys are smart. Acquiring failing retailers and growing them with an e-commerce presence.
Volume is picking up

"$229 to $183, and nicely linked to the slight, slight uptick in US Treasury 10 year yield rates.JC Penney is following SEARS into the history of retail wastebasket."

Listen I’m not saying this is going up anytime soon but all I can say is shopping for clothes online is terrible
Resistance around $120

I believe SPG will suspend their dividend to conserve cash when they report May 6.

"Great stock for patient investors like me, with a good dividend while I wait. The high-end mall in my town is doing great and suspect the same elsewhere. So, the dividend should be safe. Ordinarily, I would say that the eventual rise in interest rates might clobber the stock price. However, since covid already pancaked SPG, I think future rising interest rates might just slow down that price recovery."

Senate shut down for 2 weeks. Even if Pelosi and White House agree on Stimulus Senate has to approve and they won't even have time before elections. Pelosi knows this and waiting for new administration to take credit.
If it hits $50 I would buy and hold its dividend is pretty nice and it’s in real estate which is not that week despite what some people will tell you however this company owned a lot of US shopping malls and maybe office etc ect and nobody is going out shopping any more so they can pay there rent on time which is going to effect this company I should imagine or maybe it won’t ether way it’s a decent bet.
More retailers are filing for bankruptcy everyday. Not looking good for SPG. Not buying into this reopening hype
Break above $84.50 very bullish
you may think one day it would be saved by someone or group using 10/share as it goes bankrupt. it may happen as this company has heavy debts and need to repay on due day. It depends the virus and the economy
Another new 5 year LOW!! Bummer..
Nice upward movement today in a deep sea of red market!! Good sign that we are going to recover here!!

"Lower stock price, higher yield! Bought more! Giddy up Simon"
Malls starting to open soon
"The March 2009 low of $32 on Simon was an indicator of what it's really worth, even today, after the massive DEBT is finally paid off. Malls are frogs in slow heat beakers."
Amerika opens up again. Full stores soon with bored housewifes.
Easy $. Said it from $60. Buy the dips all day long. Overweight. $200 in 12 months. Listen to the call!!!

This one is on my watch list to buy. 52 week low and pays a hefty dividend. I understand mall traffic is bad but why such a big punishment?
We’re going to sail tomorrow
Bought at 86. What should I do? I dont want to panic too much.
So what happens if Simon's malls stay closed for six (6) months ?
Simon and Trump are doing fine.
what just happened???
"In the pandemic era especially when cash collection is significant, management will have to project carefully the funds available for distribution for the rest of the year. REITs do not like to decrease dividend rates because of bad projections at the beginning of the year. SPG is taking their time to declare dividends because it is to their advantage of pinning down the most stable rate. That is why I think they will announce dividend closer to March 31."
"Fact: #SPG was at $72 just 2 weeks ago. Fact: #SPG is now a retailer of 2 failed brands, one being a anchor tenant. Fact: Hedge fund got creme of crop distribution centers, while mall owners bought out dying tenants. .....just facts, but enjoy your one ""up"" day as tomorrow will be down :-)"
"Amazon hits $1180 per share. Malls have signs, ""For Sale"", we need $23 Billion to pay our DEBT."
Are they paying the dividend?
go visit a mall tomorrow. parking lots are PACKED.
"@Joe let me really ask you something? no really I want to get your opinion! low volume is at times not bad. It might mean less shares in the open market due to the high dividend and most buyers holding for continue growth. High volume means the stocks is uncertain, now that's not the case every time but SPG I think it is. Low volume means less people selling and more buying and holding for the long haul, tell what you thin @ Joe, thank you."
"1Q might be ok, the guidance for 2Q will be ugly. The stock market is forward looking. Hence, I will stay on the sideline. I can always pick it up at higher price if it shows a sign for the recovery by the end of 2Q. GLTA!"

My list was $BA $SPG $MPC $CNQ $CVE I guess CDEV is my last chance now to have any sort of recovery. Should I wait for a pullback to $1.25 range or just pull the trigger?
Bet on normalcy in a year! load up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
check out Mac dirt cheap
Does anyone understand what SPG owns re JCP?? I find the public info confusing ... they own half of SPARC ... SPARC owns .... stores on SPG/BRKFLD Malls? Other Stores? Some distribution? All distribution?? Does JCP own anything? I think Lenders own non-core Retail and some or all distribution. Anybody have a clearer view?
Dividend will in future will go up to $4 a shares
There is a company similar to SPG which relatively lost 50%-60% more value.That either means that SPG is priced too high or the other too cheap.What do you guys think?
knowing spg it runs to a new high then pull back about 10 bucks then hits new highs. if it gets close to 100 I'm buying more.
Buy the pullbacks. Going way higher
Buy any dips. Going way higher
this is going to trip the trading circuit breaker. +15%

Why? -because the world has learned to live with HIV & Hep C virus among us; same will happen to this virus if a vaccine is not found. Aside from its high rate of transmission this virus is not as deadly as many other microbes out there, plus it’s target audience is very predictable; individuals older than 65 and patients with underlying conditions. The solution is simple; isolate and protect and support the at risk population and let the rest of the society live with the virus and function normally with some added social distancing.$PK $SVC $SABR $SPG"
Adding today stock will be much higher imho. Dividend will also be raised.

I SPG can prove in count that Taubman did not take the right steps in the Covid 19 closers and lost more money then they should have. They won't have to pay any damages for kills the deal. I didn't want the deal.

It's too dangerous to buy until earnings are able to afford dividend. They take loan to give u dividend. Malls r very dangerous.

"one reason why Disney is great, is they always had shrewd lawyers. Decades ago the included ""media not invented yet"" in their purchase contracts. SPG is not a Disney."
why is SPG up when all others are down
To anyone who thinks this going down to 30 keep in mind that nothing is going below the March lows. The world was in a panic and the reality will always be better than fear.
At 60 SPG is probably one the best shorting opportunities you will ever see in your trading career. These ghost-town malls were bleeding heavily before the China Virus hit. Please trade accordingly. Bye Bye Simon.
It's a problem in the coming year. Moratorium be lifted on Dec 31 n be painful for REITS. SPG will drop like a rock. Not ready to pay more than 45 on this with so much debt. Stay away.
"Rent or no rent, their property is valuable and in worsr case scenario, the properties can be converted into another business."

"The rotation to reopening appear to just be starting. Now known as ""The Great REIT-Opening"". - Canadian REITs have had government support through ""CERS"" paying up to 90% of business' rent and related expenses. Those businesses must pay the landlord their rent as part of receiving government funding. This is one of the BEST programs in the world to keep business' paying rent and keep them alive for the REIT-Opening.- Canadian REITs are the perfect hedge against a weakening US Dollar. Canada is commodity driven, and the loonie has been strengthening against the greenback as commodities rise.- Canadian Real Estate is not saturated like the USA. For retail, 23.5 Sq Feet per capita in the USA. 16.8 Sq Feet per capita in Canada.- Canada land is highly concentrated in major markets. Specifically Vancouver, Toronto(GTA), and Southern Quebec/Montreal. Land is very limited in these areas due to Oceans/Lakes, US Boarder, and Mountains.- Canadian REITs have some of the lowest leverage and extremely high liquidity for their market cap, making them some of the safest REIT-Opening plays and are incredibly undervalued to NAV.- REITs in general have been refinancing at record low rates, and is working as a natural tail wind to earnings.- M&A and Buybacks are going to be the story in 2021 as the record amount of liquidity on these balance sheets are put to work.HR.UN, REI.UN, D.UN, AP.UN, SRU.UN, SOT.UN, MRT.UN, MR.UN remain very beat up to NAV, yet Year over Year revenue and FFO has been minimally impacted. These REITs have serious upside in the REIT-Opening Trade.Americans and Canadians should consider these names in their portfolio for a weakening US Dollar vs CAD Dollar, and as a natural inflation hedge. These all pay distributions monthly. New land cannot be made. It is limited, and Canada's land is very limited to these key areas.$MAC $SPG $BXP $STOR $BPY $AMT $CCI $PLD"

I have been searching for a site that will send me extra income producing stock tips and I think ive finally found it. If you are like me and in need of stock tips that produce good monthly income then you need to go to (http://Multistockalerts.com) now!
well the earnings are out mr.phil2u. What do you think? The dividend is now 1.80.
market up huge and this isn't moving. Economy not recovered by far...great depression coming this winter. mark it
Too rich of a price right now?
Dividend just got cut into half. Going down
"Anyone notice the upgrade on the 20 of january?Simon Property price target raised to $130 from $120 at Compass Point 01/20 SPG, TCO Compass Point analyst Floris van Dijkum raised the firm's price target on Simon Property Group (SPG) to $130 from $120 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. Simon's shares ""could re-rate incrementally as it gathers steam following the recent transactional evidence,"" van Dijkum tells investors in a research note. In addition, most investors expect the company to turn its ""attention to other prey now"" that Taubman Centers is under its control."
what's good entry point? I want to buy and hold for my IRA. Had few times day trading but want it for long term
"by the way JCP failure is good for malls. They have great spaces that can get back filled by better retailers are higher rents. For example, here in our mall we lost a sears, and we got a Dicks sporting goods and a cheesecake factory. I know the mall owner GGP effectively tripled their rent or more. In ashes can rise a better crop."
Still haven’t missed this one if you didn’t get in much lower. Assets valued well over $250. Buy any dips. Dividend increases imminent
Question: How much rent do you get from a vacant mall?
$142.77 is the 53 week high we need to break.
SPG is up 11.00% to 60.75
very impressive management
Properties didn’t get looted rally?
SPG has all that glitter but that glitter ain’t gold. You wanted TCO but couldn’t afford us! Byeeeeee
Protesters are destroying stores and looting in every major cities. This is not looking good for SPG. Will drop like a rock.
It's time to FORECLOSE on Simon's malls !
Is there an over reaction here?
SPG poised to pop post earnings. Look for a divi bump. Listen to the call. David is very direct and honest.
"6 days ago Simon stock went downs to 154 then Barney says another haircut for mall rats. While he posting negative comments I bought at 154 and sold at 158. Posting negative comments don't make money. Why waste time downgrading Simon stock when you can make money, It don't make any sense at all. It's like someone comes up to you and says here is 500 or 1000 dollars i'm going to give you and Barney says no I won't take it because I firmly believe that the mall business is dead."
"retail malls will want to open up even faster with a May mandate for states vaccinated, large numbers already getting vaccinated, several states open already to 100%, and now with people getting $1400 checks they will want that money spent at their malls. This is what many places have been waiting for. I think next week we see SPG and other REITs pop. GLTA "
Almost $78 lol can we make to $85 tomorrow?
Seems to need to break 85 to run Amazing how all the brick and mortar have rebounded so so strongly and the guy who gets the rent from them hasn’t Doesn’t make sense
Check out http://Pick-stocks.com. They just mentioned SPG in the daily newsletter.
Bunch of Reits filing bankruptcy lately. Is Simon next?
Long and strong eleven thousand shares. New position. Buying the fear.
"Wouldn’t be surprised with a sell off on open. Have been through a few earnings with this one, it’s pretty standard. Overall bullish long term"

Have my extra 1000 out for sale at $119
Buy the dips. Works every time.
"Did some analysis on SPGRevenue2020 estimate: $5.1bn2019 actual: $5.7bn Net income2020 estimate: $1.7bn2019 actual: $2.0bnEPS:2020 estimate: $5.452019 actual: $6.46Total debt is high at $28bn but this includes the additional $3.5bn raised last quarter. As such, SPG had $3.7bn of cash as of end of Q1-2020.Unlike most other under stress companies at the moment, eg. airlines. SPG is not expected to make a loss this year. Even if you stress the 2020 estimates by another 20%, it’s a great buy at this price."
Investors are deluding themselves that Mall owners have even a level playing field when tenants renew leases....great destruction ahead for foreseeable future....who's going to pay going rent to a dying industry?...commercial and mall properties are most saturated in U.S
"In a down market , if this stock can remain positive, it shows resilience and upward momentum. Keep buying on dips..."
How is that shorting at $80 working out? hahaha
This freaking stock can't seem to find which way is up. It opens up over $3 than back down to $1 in minutes. Hey SEC there is a lot of manipulation going on here and it would be nice if someone could put a stop to it. Stocks just don't go up and down like that in minutes without being manipulated.
$69 is cumming
Going back up. Load em up...
Glad I sold @80.5 yesterday
2 weeks to make it to $100. Let’s go!
Anyone thinking of buying Commercial Property stocks is in complete denial. Go read #Retail#dive articles....one after another major retailers going BK or as in Nordstrom...just refusing to pay 100% lease....reducing payments to 50%. Simply go to the malls yourself and look at the destruction.
"The implosion of Toys-R-Toast has even left a trail of retail damage to HAIN; $800,000 in bad debt write off for Hain baby formula left stranded at the useless toy stores. The Simons have built on quick sand. LOL"
Moderna has collected more than enough data to have an interim read out soon. Be prepared for another big gap up.
It's about time SPG declares and so far they have not
"Merry Christmas Joe, unemployment rate went down. Guess what? More jobs added to economy. Do you still think retail closed during holidays??? Laugh"
Just doubled up. This thing is ready to take off.
Going to see 42 or lower.
Everybody just sit tight a few months. Next month or so there will be some tax loss harvesting. Come January after a beat on earnings $100 plus. Put it in the books!
These sell-offs helped me a lot to average down. Im very pleased
very few people paid rent
"@Michael....""@Joe thinks we're going down tomorrow"".....watch and learn son....2 more years until your 23 year old brain develops:-)"
"Guys, this must just be hedge funds unloading to the retail investor schmucks lol - Thanks @Joe for all your laughs"
Apparently they focus on NOI and not lease spreads which is a significant strategy that seems to be working well so far.
Hold on for 10% ride down :-)
"So the REIT is now a retailor....should be interesting as they both fail. Probably taught at Columbia Business School in 2022 under ""Failed Business Models ""."

"court with Taubman next week. If Taubman wins, SPG has to proceed to pay top pre pandemic prices for the company and SPG will lose so much money to acquire a failed business."
Such a big up here!
Everything is being censored
Do you guys actually think that it’s the end for malls while the new generation can’t live without them?
"Real Estate is the most valuable asset for long term. If you had bought a home 30 years ago you would of made about a 400k profit. Same goes for commercial real estate. People will want to go out with families enjoy the weather at the outdoor properties and smell, look, feel, and touch the merchandise they are buying. Eat at restaurants, drink cocktails, and have a good time. No civilization is not over and don't believe that everything will be different after it opens up because history says it will be the same as it has before. People are tired of watching netflix and ordering overpriced food and toilet paper online. I think the consumer will go back to brick and mortar retail specially women who are tired of being mac and cheese online. Mark this post this is once in a lifetime opportunity to invest in real estate. My price target for Simon in 3 years is 360."
"Even with the vaccine news, it is still down? Why?"
will be over $100 within a month
the analyst who just downgraded SPG must feel really really stupid right about now ..
"Moodys revises #SPG outlook to negative....that was March 26th. ""new Debt strengthens liquidity, but operating challenges persist"" - July 9. This was all before most big anchor stores stated they were closing, as in JC Penny just this week. Bad enough to lose 1 anchor store. but now a lot of malls losing two anchor stores. Retail apocalypse."
I am debating between SKT and SPG.. appreciate some honest opinions
"Where are the posters that were saying $22 a share or wait , blah blah blah..... Bring the clowns out"

Be wary of @Michael....who only seems to be invested in this one stock.....never marry a stock.
How this isn’t $110 right now is beyond me. Upgrades and dividend increases coming.
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/simon-taps-debt-market-raise-131301518.htmlSure, let's add to the pyramid of debt and poorly timed purchases...Taubman, Thailand, JCPenney, Lucky. Like watching a huge Jenga game at 2am at a beach bar in TX . Without a mask."
SPG holds very well around 88-89 level. It will pull up to next level too $100 in year ends.
Just wait till the upgrades start flying at 100
SPG reached a new 52 Week High at 176.16

Where are the upgrades? These morons will step up when the stock is at $150
"AMZN record high today ! Lower lows are coming for Simon. Last 5 million square feet of retail space in USA will prove to be tipping point for sector saturation. I won't say brick and mortar are toast, but Amazon will continue to threaten and weaken retail square footage."
Dividend stocks are down today because of possible Biden win and tax dividend as regular salaries
"At $140, it’s officially a 6% dividend, assuming it remains intact. Earnings announced early Feb. Myself I saw good Xmas traffic at the high end malls, but who knows. We’ll see"
Bought this in the $60's primarily for the dividends. Loving it even more now!
"Although I dislike the routine of morning strength most days with a fall-off in the afternoons, it does appear we are forming the right side of a cup in order to get back to the $80 range. Once we move past that we get into the mid $90 range."
"Camarillo, CA outlets are booming this weekend!"
"Currently it looks like there is: 2,2% chance it will trade sub 32 USD; 13,6% chance it will trade between 32 USD and 48 USD; 68,2% chance it will trade between 48 USD and 82 USD; 15,8% chance it will trade above 82 USD in the near future. Goodluck no matter if you are short or long!"
SEARS is closing 45 more stores. Just when you thought Santa Claus 2018 would save the malls ? LOL

"Great q4 report we are on the mend. What a company, TO THE MOON!"
what's SPG vote about
"David and team seemed very confident in the business model and ability to drive rental cashflow and YoY growth in 2021. It also appeared to me that their projections are too conservative which leaves room for upside surprises. Let's see what happens, but I am happy with the earnings and 5% dividend yield while their business returns to positive growth."
SPG-PJ reached an all time low at 59.18
Buy the dips! $150 very soon! 500 more for me
short term target 88
SeekingAlpha just released article That SPG will need additional funding causing dilution
"Here is food for thought for you mall bashers: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shopping-moving-online-esports-going-083000940.html Mall spaces can be re-purposed for social activities if not for buying and selling. You cannot change the fact that humans are social animals. It's their nature. That is why movie theaters never died to this day. They need nice, comfortable places to go out and socialize. This is exactly why malls will not die, you knuckle heads."
$150 soon

"@Joe said STIMULUS IS EVERYTHING!!!.....end of story....if you believe stimulus is happening, then, #SPG is a buy...if not...it's a SELL. K.I.S.S. priciple....keep it simple stupid."
"Allen, you twisted my words. I never said retailers would nor should renew leases based on people strolling & eating at food courts. I simply stated that malls may decline but not disappear because they provide a past time for many people. Your unnecessary insults proves you are low class."
I've pulled the trigger to soon and too late... like I said yesterday might have hardened SPG. kinda hard to tell where new trend line low will be
This is 100 billion dollar gorilla  who will eat all the small companies

Can't even buy any decent priced puts!!!....no matter what the expiration dates.
Vaccine available for first responders in the next two weeks and available for all end of March/April. Light at the end of the tunnel. SPG got JCP for nothing and TCO at a deep discount. History will show the pandemic to be company changing for SPG. David is a sharp cat!
Pfizer vaccine is 95% effective. Will submit to FDA for emergency authorization in a few days. Approval in November is possible.
No lockdowns under biden per faucci in interview i saw eat it bears
"Vaccine is going to come out in two months. If you cant for whatever reason hold on to already battered stock for few for months which SPG has more than enough liquidity to survive with, you shouldnt be in the stock market in the first place. The hedge funds and there will likely be short squeeze once the first vaccine comes out because the future becomes definite, meaning things will get better each day for SPG."
Upside $88
Dividend being paid next quarter -> DividendsSimon's Board of Directors will declare a common stock dividend for the second quarter before the end of June. Simon intends to maintain a common stock dividend paid in cash and expects to distribute at least 100% of its REIT taxable income.
Any suggestions for someone new at stocks? Been reading the books and checking some stuff. Would love to have people to talk to about it. Started investing a week ago and I have doubled my money but I have made mistakes that I learned from too.
"The economic landscape continues to struggle for air without gulping water, yet, SPG forges to new highs. My 2 cents worth says SPG management knows how to make a profit?"
"Pretty impressive quarter considering the circumstances. As long as dividend is safe, which it looks pretty damn safe, expect the buy orders pouring in"
"Stores are open, rents are collected. SPG just had a deal to save JCPENNY. It’s not bad earnings after saving jcpenny with Brookfield. Buy while you have a chance because vaccine will be out soon. Don’t listen to crabheads Joe."
It will be funny to see David Simon's face when this stock files for bankruptcy.But he'll start a management company to run the malls for the new owners.
sold
With 100s of companies searching for a vaccin.. we will be like rocket very soon!
Turn this baby green today!
Go back and retest $100 please.
Toys R Toast won't be saved by Santa Grinch this year either. Try squeezing rents payments from a chapter 11 deadbeat.
From $186 to $45.00I am thinking to buy 1k shares .. ur thought ?
"Whallow in the $159s. By Christmas, another non-mall event, you will only wish you still had bids in the $150s."
"Other respectable reit tanked 30% after earnings, and still is tanking.Probably related to 60% not paying rent and maybe the forbearence period that could be extended.What are your thoughts? I still hold a small position in SPG; hoping for a rebound, but less heavy than before."
Here’s a thoughtA lot of other weaker operators go out of biz and they surviveBenefit from this crisis
"Never add to a losing position. Left holding the bag on a big short here since early spring, based on their aggressive expansion in brick and mortar, debt issuance etc. There were SO MANY reasons to be short. But here we are 5 long months later with a 6% div that analyst consensus believes supportable, and even at these levels a PE of 20. Premiums are so rich it would almost be a crime not to enter here. Not saying I'm in. But so tempting."
Got some at 53 but I was hoping it would go up after Friday. I have 20k coming in Friday I wanted to put on it. Ow well it will be to late by then.
Who is foolish enough to hold over the Weekend before (non) earnings report???....surely not the big funds that count on dividends!!...selling off to Retail Schmucks!!

People have truly lost their minds treating a pandemic asBeing infinite conditjons
The king of kings simons !!!
do people not get that SPG's top 5 tenants are disasters and that is largest users of space are Macy's and JCP which are both non viable? SPG is like turning subprime into triple AAA. Its all smoke and mirrors
Heavy manipulation of all REIT stocks right now. Up big one day and down big the next.

SPG earnings is Tuesday August 1 before market. Might get back in Monday. SPG is a good trading stock with very juicy Option Premiums. Only idiots and liars say different. I actually think shopping centers will coexist with Amazon in the future and Simon Properties is the pick if the litter.. If you can't make money trading this stock best pull out and buy Savings Bonds.
Down down down.. reits.. ughhh..
It is only a loss when you sell it..I bought some more at 65.50.. I'm very bullish.. let's go!!

Most Americans in the lower class... going out to outlets and malls considered not an expensive experience and these places will be packed by end of June.5. I honestly see it going up to 90 easy by end of June...6. Not sure about the long but you are safe with nice profit till before Q3 results..STRONG buy

SPG will hit 100$ by the end of the month!
looks like 50 day is getting close to crossing the 200 day

5yrs AGO SPG dividend was 6 dollars a share. You get the picture.
Do I hear $99 bids ? Simple Simon retail caverns converting to recycle dumps ?
Last $600 federal unemployment checks have been sent out. Full stop on this week's check. $10 BILLION/WK in disposable income gone.

"Over 7700 retail stores closed in 2017. Put that in your Christmas stocking, Simons!"
"New lows won't be the last lows. The FED has taken away the Simons punch bowl. LOLTake a good long look at Macys, SEARS, JC Penney, Target, even Wal-Mart.10 years from now they will be as relevant as Montgomery Ward and GC Murphys. LOLRetail....where capital goes to die."
Expect a major hit on SPG this week with the civil unrest brewing and the looting. Very attractive buying opportunity and potential for massive gains after the storm clears.
Boring
Faucci just said it wont be a pandemic for much longer eat sht bears
Divy paid tomorrow! More shares tomorrow!
Taking a vote. Who thinks this will go to $100 or more in the next 3 years? Thumbs up for yes. I'm a thumbs up.
The people will continue to visit malls !! That’s enjoyable for the families ! In Cristmass the malls will be packed ! Remember this !
"See Fauci warning about Fall & Winter (last night). See CDC warning about restaurants, again....last night.....Woodwards book drawing greater scrutiny to actions taken in past, present and future. Home Depot cancels Black Friday altogether.....this isn't going to be pretty for Mall Owners."

Anyone else feeling let down that they didn’t raise the dividend?

"Work from home is proving to be less productive, especially on Fridays and Mondays. Offices are important and essential for company culture, productivity, and brainstorming.

I think we are set for a rebound tmr!
"Simon now opening Norfolk premium outlets in Norfolk, Chesapeake, Virginia Beech areas. They just keep expanding and growing. Now the Bell is towing for Barney but not for me. I'm in at the right price getting big dividends unlike Amazon which pays no dividend. Amazon will sooner or later get more competition from other retailers. They are not the only company that can do on line business. When ever I look for anything to buy Amazon prices is never the best price so I never use Amazon,"
I think we should hit 100$ in 2 months!
Shorts will be taking this very high today

"I also owing IVR, best time to buy this mREIT at the dip with great discount price. Hit hard by covid and recovering, high yield, profit and dividend increasing. Besides, it's heavily short, for those like squeeze, there's lot of juice in it. Do your study. Great opportunity!! "

"It's one thing to have an opinion on a stock but another to give false and misleading statements like Barney says and I quote ""Simons intend to force Starbucks to keep losing money on their teashops until 2027"" According to Forbes (and of course Barney knows more than Forbes) the article says Starbucks is NOT losing money on their teashops since they have grown more than 40% after being acquired by Startucks in Dec of 2012. Barney making the statement about koohas bars and calling Simon wise guys in unacceptable so I will report this to the Yahoo board and make a call to Simon investor relations."
88.88 is a lucky number. Ill be adding some more shares 
"SPG is a great stock, just not now. maybe mid 2021."
This was oversold imho

why are we crashing after earning? are they cutting our dividend??
Literally should be 150 today

Un-vaxxed will be blocked from malls, theaters, bars and restaurants, etc. etc. etc. curious minds want to know."
"I can live off 5% dividend on expiring tuna and ramen on sale. When the going get tough, the tough get going. Hold for $300 in 5 years! kaboom!!!!!!!!!!"

"Brad is correct. Now J Crew is going bankrupt. Soon to follow likely will be DDS, M, JWN, LB & BBBY."
"Once vaccine is out and we are back to somewhat normal it should be over $120 easy. This company is to great to be down forever. Plus, the dividend should be back to where it was Pre-Covid"
Only simons will rule the real estates other companies will die
140 soon

injust did a 76 GTC+ext hope I can get it at 4:30 a.m.. I should have been in more at this point but I'll take what I can get.
How is SPG - with many of its malls open and currently earning a PROFIT - trading at the same discount as the airlines and cruise lines???
Yup. I defintiely added here :)
in reading through some of these posts I'm thinking I might be in at the wrong time. I never saw so many noob trading questions which tells me we are in for more pain. new investors aren't disciplined but rather trade on emotion. I hope I'm wrong.
I was expecting the HFT programm to take this up 3 bucks today .

"Hey for those that actually care, a 20% drop from the high of $225 is $180 which corresponds to the low of the year. How coincidental."

the stock keeps going... goodness! 
this is undervalued
Cancel the TCO buyout and cut the dividend to conserve cash. They will need every penny. Do it now you idiots
New lows beget lower lows. Retail malls are in permanent decline. Your tenants are toast. Just ask... Toys R Toast. $24 BILLION loaned to these Indianapolis pikers.
Any Positive News this stock has great gains. Once we are back to normal it should be back to $150. Can't wait
"Keep an eye on $122...we break it, we run to $150"

SPG is down 13.11% to 47.67
"All the usual characters @steve, @Michael, etcetera taking day off it seems."
If I were Simon Property I’d downgrade BofA on uncertainty during unprecedented times. Seems like a pretty easy call.
David Simon just said they are use contrarian investing and you all are herd investors thinking as investors and in the long run will LOSE?
Don't be fooled by the div. Tenants are not paying rent. The biz is getting hammered. Buy stocks that benefit from covid.
Bottom line - the malls are packed. Traffic/parking to and at malls are maxed out.
mosrly it will open at 120 or 115 tomorrow
It's a sell off of trump news this will bounce back
I am not done adding. This needs to crash back to $62
"WE will have to wait until 30th June for Simon to announce a dividend raise*****************************The Company paid its first quarter 2021 common stock dividend of $1.30 per share, in cash, on April 23, 2021. Simon's Board of Directors will declare a common stock cash dividend for the second quarter of 2021 on or before June 30, 2021.Simon's Board of Directors declared the quarterly dividend on its 8 3/8% Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (NYSE: SPGPrJ) of $1.046875 per share, payable on June 30, 2021 to shareholders of record on June 16, 2021."
Im really surprised that the TCO termination isn't having a positive effect on stock. Essentially they eliminated a future debt increase of 3.9 bil and potential dilution to share holders from occurring. These aspects should create positive momentum in share price
Does this board realize the amount of real estate SPG has acquired in the last 15 years? The stock price is the same today as it was 15 years ago. Real estate does not disappear. The perceived value may decrease but it’s all perception. Do some homework on commercial real estate.
They will be cutting Dividends to survive. If they get help from Feds they will be unable to buyback stocks and will have to cut dividends in order to get help. That’s a fact!
"I realize they had positive net cash flow but I think the wave of retail defaults such as J Crew and JCP, along with rent defaults, will weigh on SPG revenue.As a result, I believe they should reduce the dividend to conserve cash."
I mean if it is still dipping I'll add more. It's the boxing day sales!
Brookfield making moves. Once in a lifetime opportunity. Get long SPG. $150 year end
"JCPENNY left with 690 stores. Hedge funds get 160 Distribution centers/other real estate. ""It's a financial deal to conduct a lengthy going out of business sale for jcp. Jcp...not going to survive said Nick Egelanian, president of Siteworks. But this allows the big mall owners to control the death process and that's really good for them because they don't want these things to close immediately - that will cause other closures."""
Good ER. Their business is picking up and malls are increasing in occupancy and rent payments. Also they made net profit. Here we come 100!
"Interesting opinion that I noticed on another chatroom:""Sorry to repeat myself but after the last hearing we are still in a very good shape and way undervalued. After the AMZN partial asset buy going thru $SPG (140 closed stores) the JC Penney operations will continue and we will end up with a company that has ZERO DEBTS + 1,2B in CASH + a new, motivated and efficient management TEAM + at least half of the existing stores OWNED IN FULL and a 2B INVENTORY already paid... So YES YES YES I ACCEPT THAT! And definitely the future fair value of such a company is not 100M but rather over 3B easy. Well think about it, that explains the MMs trying to steal shares at little cost. The future of this company starts now!DO NOT SELL ANY SINGLE SHARE UNTIL IT IS VALUED AT 3B!"""
Well it was looking good there for a while today lol
when it seems too good to be true...it probably is
Because the S&P and Dow are in the red...lol
"With 8% dividend and high potential to grow, I don't understand why its staying so low. In-store retail sales were about 88% compared to online sales which were under 12%. Even if many malls will go under and some stores declare bankruptcy, Spg malls being the best placed, are here to stay. Any thoughts?"
Rock solid dividend through the pandemic and acquired TCO for $800 mill less. All I can say is wow! Kudos David
Hilarious....MM dropping the price on 100 share sales. Cant wait for the Virtual annual meeting
Back to $62 soon
"Easy 140$ stock, the guy under is clearly waiting for a dip, if you read into assets spg will not go bankrupt, the ceos literally made millions of dollars of bets about the stock and bought over 19 million in shares because they know the stock isn’t going anywheres."

I keep loading up anytime its $68 or less.
Buying every dip.
I am raising my buy point to 48. I am not buying now.
"Volume in the tank today, not just on #SPG, but almost all stocks. Take 10:30 volume and multiply by 3x....that should be average daily volume. That's of course no news on your particular stock, sector or Markets themselves. ALL Indices have show low volume past 5 trading days.

Oh ok I thought they declared a special dividend it is just the regular div. thanks looking forward to it. Don't know if I would buy again though.
The only problem I have is I didnt buy more....
This certainly isn't a Dividend play anymore. Unemployment Stimulus was one of few lifelines for disposable income. That has now vanished overnight....100% Poof!
"So, I am buying more on the dip but figured it would go down. Toxic Jim.""Bartyesterday$SPG conversationWell, Jim Cramer mentioned it today so.... yeah."""
I feel spg is about to crash.. so i hope it pops above 63 usd then i can sell without loss.
"I bought 3,350 shares at 69.00 + with a time horizon of two years +,and felt a few feet taller when it got close to 90, . Now I'm feeling many feet shorter and it's not a good feeling. I think absent the pandemic, absent SPG taking legal recourse against tenant/s, absent SPG backing out of a purchase deal with TCO, absent the company's direction to purchase JCP, this is a good company with a good dividend (which appears now to be uncertain). I can neither control the situation nor wish to sell and crystallize any losses. So I think I'll hold for now. Any illuminating thoughts are welcome."
SPG should offer to buy MAC in a one for two share all equity deal. It would be a steal and much better than the TCO deal.
Looking forward to the SPG bankruptcy filing
SPG collecting a pool of brands that will be easily revived. Great management!

"SPG is making announcements about leasing vacant space in its malls for coworking space. Believe me, there are a lot of public-private partnerships out there with economic development dollars behind them that will want these spaces. Don't be too narrow-minded about who leases space. There is demand for SPG vacant space."
All the bad stuff every one is saying is already factored into the current price of 50% less than the 5 year average. This is the reason why people must buy because its already very low priced due to the bad stuff.
Join the short squeeze at MAC.
Put a fork in it.

"Simons must personally pay back the BILLIONS they have borrowed! Between the street fights inside malls, and Macys collapse, malls are becoming the place to AVOID!"
Very powerful company with to much cash !!
We have a classic Cup and Handle stemming from June Run up and forward. This will get tons of attention technically. Might balk momentarily ... but then should blast higher.
One thing for which I am not sure is that these malls will create employments so does anybody agree that there will be some kind of pressure for government to come up with some incentives for mall owners and retailers in general? Just throwing out my idea not sure how it affects the stock price.. Also note that Simon is in advisory committee for President Trump.. Any thoughts?
$100 by earnings and don’t be surprised with a divi hike!
Market will have zero effect from here real estate is eternal
"LOW volume is not indicative of a takeoff, especially with Markets Hitting all time highs (also on low volume)."
It's ironic to see Simon property going to Court to enforce tenant payments in full (read GAP) yet they don't want to honor their own Taubman due diligence agreement to buy it out.....#SPG is not a unsophisticated buyer and the Taubman deal was initiated by Simon and everything was done on the same type-faith they had with tenant GAP. Any jury would certainly side with Taubman. $18 million spent so far. Appeals will triple that number.
Going short another tranche.....average between the two at $80.24......you guys are awesome!!

When are they giving the dividends for the past quarter? I think they are late. Must be in May.
this will touch 50 soon..
Stock is about to make a significant move. Dividend / TCO Relief = $80.00
I feel SPG is incredibly strong compared to its pears. While its pears went down 30%-50% recently SPG has been trading sideways. That means SPG is better than them and probably has more bullish buyers.
why red again??
SPG is down 5.86% to 112.08
"Main Street media might be trying to scare investors, however, look into your smaller news outlets for a clearer picture:https://www.unionleader.com/news/health/coronavirus/shoppers-line-up-as-malls-open-their-doors-with-half-of-the-stores-operating/article_f2c27c6c-8bbe-5865-b036-a486b51f66a0.html"
IMO both SPG and MAC are very likely to raise the dividend with the next announcement.
i am in at 53...next buy at 45 then 40

Stock will be at 140 before end of day
"Fred's is closing another 104 stores. XRT has gone flat for the last 5 years. If the Simons think they can skate off to new tenants like UHaul and recycling dumps, they would be well to remember that malls need maintenance, and property taxes also eat away at values."
Close above $96 is very bullish!
Love the juicy divi
one cannot help but think when retail/mall shopping is toast it gets even worse. hats off to wmt for buying in to online retail in such a big way. with all the bricks and mortar they now have the cake and can eat it too.....
The fact is that the landlords make money no matter what. The tenants may go bankrupt but they need to honor the rents .
Next week it will be some news about the dividend and the market will adjust this too lower price if the dividend stay around 8%.
"So the Simons announce a stock buy back, just as Payless ShoeStraps is closing 2300 stores. The Simons in corporate HQ seem oblivious to what is happening to their dying retail mall 'empire.'"

I smell a downgrade coming
TCO complete. What a deal! SPG rocks! Get long and enjoy the ride and the divi
Same procedure everyday. I buy the morning dip here and I'm up end of the day. My top holding here. Top quality dividents. The only reit that posted profits during the worst months of the virus shut down.
They might raise dividend to 2.10 which would be almost a 5.2 % dividend
V Line recovery! I think so!

"That's all hype. Target not doing that bad. Walmart is the one doing great. It's up to 90 now. As for Amazon, they are trying to monopolize all the retail and groceries but that won't last. Every time a store closed the State, cities and counties lose property taxes and the sales taxes that these stores generate. The States will not sit by and allow Amazon get away with that. Also the store closing come with large layoffs. States will probably have to start charging for buyingonline. All that stuff sold online should be taxed like they do at the stores. It's not free to ship those products you buy online. Sooner or later Amazon will take a hike."
That cute fat boy Josh recommends SPG!! We will see. I had calls for SPG but sold and looking to buy again!!

Anyone know if the dividend is still in play?
Need to bust through that resistance and then off to the races
Perfect buying opp
Dividend will be reduced in August. Management already took pay cuts to soften the blow to retail investors. More states joining California in Re-Closing actions. This Pandemic is far from over and most anchor tenants won't be in business by the time all US citizens are vaccinated.
It appears that SPG is stuck in the mid to high $60's as I continue to patiently wait for a breakout into $70's and $80's. I wonder whether we need another round of stimulus so that consumers will have spending money in their hands in order for this stock to have its breakout on the upside.
"Fauci reiterates: Virus with us well into 2021. Double downs to hopefully be written in on right side of history. Meanwhile, Trump calling Putin about getting cut of ""bounty money""."
This thing is gonna run. I’ll take 7% all day long. Plus the stock is heading back to $150 fast. Homerun here.
Buying the open. Won’t be able to see $80s ever again!
i think malls are dying cuz of online shopping
"i don't see why SPG is holding up so well. recession is coming, if people aren't shopping in the mall now, they will shop even less in a recession."
Get the cash prepared to buy at $61 next week guys.
If SPG goes down to 100 the dividend will be 7%
"A ""Premium"" cruise line just announced they're going back to Market for another $250 million to stay in business. This is not your daddy's recession folks!!"
Oversold! Time to accumulate!!!!
Resilience. Firm support at $60
cheryl what you think buyout price would be I don't want less than 150
"Despite Barney's hilarious rantings, the stock is up $10.00 in three weeks."
"Keep telling everyone - assets worth 3x of current stock price. Be patient, buy the dips and stay long"
Told you so.... $50s here we come
My bid is $48
#MAC down 1% on great up-day for Indexes.....be careful here people...it's your money.
"Cruise lines extend closures another month....to end of October......started out with ""end of July"".....then August, then September, now October."
I believe it will be shorted tomorrow. just my opinion.Will be an excellent time to add to my pile
Yesterday when i wasn't in this it went to $87.00. I bought today at $85 and it went straight downbelow yesterday's low. Will it go back up to $87.00 today ??
This should be at 90+ with the market being positive today. Lets's go!!!
"The pandemic will end. There are not many places to go. people go to the mall for shopping, dining, movies, in relax atmosphere. so it is too early to say life styles will change."
Horrible negative news on malls will allow HFT programs to drive the stock price down relatively easy
"Here is why SPG will bounce back eventually. People will support local. Local restaurants, salons, retailers, etc. Malls are local and will get a lot of this business. Sure online will continue to do well but people can't wait to get some normalcy in their lives and that includes local shopping and eating."
watching FDA complete circle jerk
New your is shuting down again!!!
"Simon Property Group is in a stronger position than its competitors, the analysts say, because the mall REIT had $10 billion of liquidity on March 16, not including the expected $3.6 billion cost of its acquisition of Taubman Centers (TCO), expected to close in coming months."
1000 for a day trade!
Breaking $100 this week. Vaccines are a plenty. The née norm will take foot over the next 60-90 days.
Don’t forget the almost 5% while the stock continues to rise! And they will increase it. It’s a matter of time
bullish breakout no resistance.
Look at the chart. The spike up volume has been much higher than the down volume. The spike up volume have also decreased a lot. Less and less sellers. The stock has been accumulated.
"Funny reading this board and seeing how quickly sentiment can change. Was the virus really a watershed moment for Simon's class A properties?? Or, is this an example of an opportunity to be greedy when others are fearful?"
Will SPG hit $70 by the end of the week?
"Still think SPG will drop further if second wave of COVID-19 hits, which looks likely. I'm only going to buy if it drops below $50."
"JC Penny...Bankrupt, Nordstrom....Bankrupt, Nemann-Marcus....Bankrupt.....Unemployment soars to highest since the Great Depression, America shut down with pandemic...hundreds of thousands dying, all announced within 3 days, and the stock goes up. This is sure one crazy world we live in."
Buy it when it’s hated and you will be rewarded. $150 before you know it. Down from $230.
Gap $ coming soon
Oh My.....
"Oh Barney, how is the retail rats doing today? It appears that Barney hates the Simons. He calls them rats."
if the dems and Republicans can work out this current deal in the next couple days & Q3 hits hard well be 80+
"it is well known that spg will reduce their dividend in half, since their revenue is paltry for the quarter, this should really be called return of capital"
"Oil, Pharma and SPG might get a nice bid on sector rotation as Tech tanks. But today was just one day."
It seems some smart money will buy the dip. Only because the vaccine of Pfizer is a game changer.
I've never seen futures up 4 / 5 %
Payless ShoeSource still has 2700 stores as it shuffles into it's second bankruptcy. Troubles at the mall with....foot....traffic ?
GAP closing 225 stores.....even more planned for 2021. Meanwhile JCPENNY reports massive losses.
too much polarity here. malls are here to stay and will.be populated again but it wo t be till we have a vaccine and peoplle feel comfortable being around otjers. If u walk down the street now without a mask on many people will walk on the road to avoid passing next to u. I see it just taking a walk around d the block. and the economic situation for a lot if people is really bad and scary. But in the end yes people do like to see and feel and try on what they buy. But for now spg is a pretty good short term trade. but 30s to 50s I think good long term opportunity even if dividend gets suspended which I believe will be inevitable. But only for about 12 months. Just my opinion. and I hate having to go to the post office to st d back jeans from eBay with size misrepresentation. wouldn't have happened at the mall if I had tried them on. But would have been more expensive too. Just my opinion
"Wales just locked everything down for 2 weeks , but for some reason , the Stable Genius thinks having Super Spreader rallies will hep fill Simon Property , just what is the plan , are they going to start leasing Mortuary Vaults ?hey babe , lets go to the Mall and see the kids in 7A , 7B , 7C , then grab a bite and maybe a movie , I'm thinking the walking dead , never hurts to hope right , and who knows , just maybe the Chosen one can resurrect the Dead , after all , he is The Stable Genius"
75 by next friday covid headlines gone in days. Did u permas see cruise lines bounce on friday i bet not
Thats a premarket
$29 down after market??
Daily volume setting up for another lackluster 1/3 avg daily volume.
Tco went up today. MAC held up well as well. Probably the lawsuit.
Remember: spg up big whileNaz crumbled on wed. More of same thursday shorts. Money flow rotation toNew leaders
"Any views on what direction this is going against the market over the next 3months. Earnings W/C 3rd Feb might bring some sort reality check, maybe the stock will continue up to $100? its anyones guess. Whats peoples weighting of this stock in a varied portfolio of stocks? I m a UK investor."
why arent they declaring dividend? what’s going on?
Thank you for the divvy. They will add up nicely as the overall economy crawls out of COVID later next year.
"David Simon is not worth $3.7 MILLION per year in salary. It's no wonder that retailers like Bed, Bad-breath, and Beyond are in free fall. Rents are WAY-to-High at the malls !!"
Any ideas on Amazon partnership timing?

Oh boy @Joe not doing well today in any of his stocks.... Sucks to be a bear with puts....
"MAC reported much better FFO in the third quarter (although net loss did not improve) even though 25% of their portfolio was lock down during the quarter. SPG largely does not have MAC's handicap of owning large percentage of their properties in NY, NJ and CA, so I expect SPG to have great FFO with improved net income which means it should shoot up after ER just like SKT did today."
"Shareholders given a chance to get out before total breakdown on $600/week stimulus disappearing.....Dividend cut of 50%....this is now a retail play...not a dividend play. This IS NOT A SAFE STOCK!!!...it's a speculative play at best....a total disaster at worst. Mom & pop investors NEVER, EVER counted on losing dividends on top of equity....but .....THERE IT IS!!!"
DOES anybody really think they will open 3/29? I don't
52 week high
holding 200 @60 .. thinking about getting out
"Most malls are opening in Indiana on Monday. The traffic today has picked up significantly. People are ready to get out and shop. I'm not sure SPG will be $70 or $50 this week, but I feel good about a 3-bagger in 3 years."
real news will be coming the next 2 weeks
"Another reit reported its results, and despite that it doesn't seem too bad, the impairments were really high.The price of the share went down 7% just in the opening. Be prepared for anything guys.And don't forget to stick to your plan."
In two years you make lot money . I am looking to buy into this now but seeing if it pull back a little more . I am looking a year or two myself so you be ok I am buying 3000 to 4000 . So it be a lot money for all of us good luck .
will trade my wife for more shares of this
They talked the price of AMZN up today. IT is way overpriced. valued at 408 Billion. A retail company valued at 408 B that is B for Billion dollars? like no one else can compete in that business.
"Inconceivable to have worse timing and circumstances. This expansion, combined with timing on Taubman deal exposes SPG to unleverageable market risk. Is the principal risk worth a taxable div? One cut or miss and its a run to the exit. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/simon-property-spg-inaugurates-premium-132301576.html"
"Needless to say, at one point soon they will announce suspension of dividends, they have no choice.they protect the little cash they have to pay interest and hope for a miracle ....looking at balance sheet...I have no idea why anyone in this market would want to invest in commercial real estate ...office buildings or malls."
Meadows just said extended unemployment numbers are to expire....No Deal.
MACYS is closing even more stores. Looks like Santa Claus didn't save the giant mall rat after all.
Im torn between investing more here or in my oil/gas midstream holdings. Im bought in here at $52 average with about 15% of my portfolio. Dividends and depressed pricing is relatively equal here as my midstream holdings. Only difference is price of SPG is about 4x cost of my midstream holdings so I could acquire 4x the shares for increased future dividend re-investment. Ohh the conundrum what to do
Should close above $82.50
lets see 140
"Retailers can open 100% of their stores, but if consumers aren't spending then it's even more disastrous to bottom line in General and Administrative expenses. Average American not comfortable taking on new debt within current economic crisis. Discretionary spending would first go to luxury of eating out, not a new handbag or evening attire....unless you're talking lingerie :-)"
Buy the weakness all day! And enjoy the “scrumptious” divi along the way!
So I was thinking the foreclosures might be badd news However if Madonna announces a vaccine with 90% plus of fish and sea it could be opset and actually go up we will see

Should be up to 80sh next week.
"Remember- pre pandemic SPG didn’t own TCO, didn’t acquire failing retailers and didn’t have new properties coming on. Worth way more than $229.10."
They said they would pay a dividend...they did not say how much.
This is what’s gonna happen in orderAll property’s opening firstTruman buy outResume all the construction Then buy back shares before feb 2021
MAC up 1% already. REITs bottomed this morning
NINETY FIVE PERCENT of business leaders state some sort of fiscal stimulus is needed to support consumer demand. Sorry.......we're too busy with a Supreme Court nomination.....see you at end of January when we're a minority party.

"good friday mall traffic down by more than 50% ...ok ...so what ...the markets expect that ... the rising price is due to expectations about the future. there will be some dark days before things improve, but smart investors see the light at the end of the tunnel and position themselves accordingly...gl"
This one is going way higher! No matter what they try it won’t go down
What other stocks are u guys all buying?
"When is Moderna expected to announce an update of its phase 3 results? Some say this coming week, but is that something firm or mere speculation? Thx."
Joe the broke why do you worry about spg if you don’t own it ? Beach bag
can you let me know what color of thong you will get
"Any day market dumps, this stock will go to $52, then $48."
SEARS can't close stores fast enough. Macys isn't far behind.Retail pedestrian malls are in permanent secular decline. The Simons will have a lot of explaining as to why they have $23 BILLION in debts.
Malls are dead.
why is dog trading wierd. when everything else is up a good amount
The talking heads (Analyst's) just want to put the negative spin on REITS right now so that they can close out their shorts before they start saying that people are heading back to the brick and mortar to feel the experience before the pandemic. This company has great management and knows the business. This stock will double in a year from now. Good luck to all.
Buying JC Penney doesn’t solve anything. Don’t own any Simon stock buy just opin on the purchase of JC
"I've been shopping on line for years now. Like when I shop for expensive Swiss watches like Longines, Rolex, Cartier, Tag HauerI can always get lots cheaper with online stores than I can Amazon. Like when my wife and I shop at Sam's club and buy just about anything including TV's, Computers etc if it don't work right or something happens later or your not satisfied just take it back and they either exchange or refund. We went online to shop for furniture and then when we see what we like we to go furniture store and try it out. We can't do that at Amazon. All the specialty stores are now going online just like Amazon. Amazon may well be overpriced stock, who knows/"

Dumped my puts this is ludicrous

Anyone else ever check out (http://Multistockalerts.com)? They just sent a tip about SPG
I am so confused why is there no ex dividend date for Q2?
Any predictions for today ?
Simon being appointed by President as real estate executive to restart the economy.. Will this help in driving stock price?
"Malls are in secular decline. In the future, 'shopping malls' will be considered a relic of a decadent and excessive society who borrowed themselves into a pit, so that they could import worthless junk from overseas."
the stock lost 66% from 3 month ago numbers. Definitely revenue will be TEMPORARY deteriorated. Majority of businesses/renters will be reopened within next 2-3 months. the market will take this fact well in advance. I do not expect $150 in 3 months but 100-110 is easy reachable.
Remember what David said in last CC? If the dollar declines then the profits go up Global SPG That is being overlooked
"Cheryl, in terms of Post COVID recoveries plays the banks have come back ... DFS and AX my favorites, REITS have been a good Second Wave ... do you have thoughts on SPG vs VLO and PSPX? These depressed Yield Plays are too interesting."
dont think about dividend and all just trade for easy money
Mark It!!....@Simon and @Steve bought more at $64.85!!!
It’s gonna be fun when they announce Q3 results which will include rent from Q2. Be careful shorts
this is going to 100
down 6.66? um no I got out too much uncertainty in retailers at the moment.
"drove past very large mall the other day and i was surprised to see so many cars there. it wasn't like last year, but there were still a lot of shoppers. i would say 85% full parking lot. last year you couldn't find parking. overall, though, the good malls like the one i drove past will survive until the vaccine is out - and then there will be this appreciation for being able to go out ...this pent up demand ...."
Now u can buy
"prediction: Supreme Court ruling trumps stimulus, stimulus not approved by election, stocks sell off and you can buy this sub $60. Pelosi would love to pass stimulus under Trump to include that deficit under his administration, but GOP held Senate not falling for it. Stimulus won't be passed until mid to late January."
"Few companies represent mall life more so than Macys. The lead banner in the rat parade is ticker; M.Take a good look at the decline in sales and profits. Santa Claus keeps missing Macys, every darn year!Eventually, even the Simons will get less revenue from the starved mall rats."
AND THEY DID THE DEAL ON A SUNDAY!!!! HAHAHA SPG POWER!!!!!!!
Oh cool. A stock that will give me a $1.30 per share Dividend and was trading at 140+ 6 months ago. Seems like a buy to me.
SHOPPING MALLS ARE DYING !
@Kelly want to chime in this afternoon???....please...the floor is all yours:
"Great Article - Mall Owners tp Department stores leaving its malls: See ya, wouldn't want to be ya.Look at https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2016-09-14/department-stores-leaving-malls-is-fine-by-mall-ownersMall Owners are getting more juice out of smaller stores."
Go back to $60 so I can buy it
There was some asset reallocation (profit taking) from index leaders to laggards / REITS today
"went to 2 SPG owned malls in charlotte area over the weekend , it was more crowded than pre-covid, this stock will sure recover ...."
"Retail collapse candidates for 2019;ANF - people just don't go on safari like they used to.BKS - books aren't cool these daysODP - completely blitzed by Staples, Quill, and Amazon.TCS - last but not least, these wisecrackers sell storage for all the useless stuff people have bought at malls since the 1960s"
Huge retail sales beat and SPG drops. Typical 2021 stock market moves...
Thought about buying FRI but was hesitant to pull the trigger. Congrats to those who did. I ended up buying some TTD instead which coincidentally would be the beneficiary of my long term concerns with SPG. But best to all.
225 dollars per square foot.  The galleria in Houston is worth at least 500 per square foot in a depression. This is insane. You can get REITs and insurance companies dirt dog cheap still. A lot of everything else has rallied. Like how do sit down restaurant stocks quadruple back 75 percent of old highs but they are still closed. ? Future outlook. I am betting same happens with reits and insurance. For you income lovers check out unm. Dividend in tact. 8 percent.
This Taubman mall conflict is holding this stock back...
anyone suggest this stock??
"Wow, a couple of good articles today on how SPG is still oversold and underbought, and how the big hedge funds are putting long money into this stock now, I think we’re in for a nice summer of steady upside !"
"Not to mention, people don't realise that ANY DAY we will wake up to the headline ""Covid vaccine/therepeutic discovered"". Literally all stocks will rally massively then. This stock is for LONGS, and in the long term this is an easy pick. Just look at what happened after 2008. Enjoy the rollercoaster but keep a position. Thank me in a year."
Dividend got cut. Going down
This ride will be short lived! The malls will be closing back up as the Covid cases grow! No cure. No treatment..... more cases and more deaths. I’ll be shorting SPG! #FunRidehttps://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/2020/04/28/parkland-sees-rapid-increase-in-covid-19-cases-with-most-intubations-yet/
Hey Joe made $178 by just holding not good but not bad. I hope to keep on growing @Joe. Once we get to $80 you owe lunch buddy!
highly dout lock downs again... we need to stay open and live with covid.
Half the market cap pre pandemic and now own Taubman and JCP!
shame on those chickens who short it 
TCO is probably close to bankruptcy and SPG doesn't want TCO pulling SPG down with them.
Brilliant move! Buy the weakness.
"Virus Raging,Cut in Dividens,Tenents not Paying Rent, Lawsuites and on and on...."
"I usually for SPG in Stocktwits and MAC - I have to say @Joe talks wayyyyy to much on this board. Someone is trying to help a few hedge funds cover their shorts. Geez, relax a bit Joe, if you’re not short, then you’re agenda is to buy lower. Period."
PNC selling entire stake on BLK is creating market instability today. BLK is working with FED.
Any thoughts on SKT? Seems like similar stock... same story just smaller brand..
Buy tlry.. has nothing to do with 
$95.56 is major resistance. We get through that it’s off to the races.
Assets are awesome. Way oversold. Remember $150 pre Covid. Covid will pass. Buy the dips and have a longer term view. 12 month back to $150. Vaccine getting closer as every day passes.
"Wow in one weekend SPG has really put out a mixed bag of important consequential news. The good, the bad an the ugly. Giving back several of it's malls to lenders is definitely not a good sign. Being forced into buying Taubman even at a small discount also not good. I'm for sure not feeling as bullish on SPG as I was on Friday. I think we have a serious rollercoaster ride coming up."
"I know you dividend loving investors may be skittish of gold and silver stocks, but go look at the oil majors today....they're all up 4-6% too. Major disruption coming to world economies and smart money running to hard assets with no counterparty commitments."
MAC is way undervalued get in for 7% divi while you wait 50% shorts there
even or green end of day
any idea why is it down?
"So the short ratio has grown which means possible drop down of share price just like one week ago, do you think it is more reasonable action to see $MAC and switch to $SPG?"
Look for the break above $103.50
"Nike taking $200-$250 million one time hit with employee termination cost....# of jobs being axed, yet unknown."
@joe Q3 earnings can only get better than Q2. Why do you expect the stock price to go down?
"If SPG reaches $200 on a bounce one day, I'm out until it bottoms at $180 in a month or so. As we get closer to the rate hike decision, we will continue to drop further. No sense in continuing to take loses on this one for the rest of this year."

One question.. can anyone explain me why in the premarket there's only 100s of stocks being traded?
I've been to Dallas and Tampa in the last week. Even though restaurants and some stores were open it was a ghost town. Anyone who thinks that these malls are going to get back to normal this year are dreaming. Now the tenants are going to have the worst of all worlds. Simon forcing their hand to open and pay labor costs with virtually no sales.
Bought at 85$. Urgh. What should I do.
"Just visited Simon Mall (Woodfield Mall) one of the largest in USA. They are starting to get customers, just needs to get into Phase 4 to really start to move up."

"Dividend coming, time to buy . Don’t miss out on this easy return"
what's the long term plan for SPG about the retailers it has bought?Is it going to keep them or sell them?
bed wetters get out the way. load up every chop... and get you hand on the claymore.
Guess everything is ok in the world again.Gilead's drug can help treat (not cure) the disease.Quick.. Everyone run out to the malls.. Oh wait.. Youre still unemployed... And cant go out until May / June.. lol.. Wow
look at the May 19th puts. 3.5 bid strike price of 165. Now with the 1.75 dividend that put actual cost is 5.50 SPG would have to go down to 160 by the middle of the month to make that call profitable.
"Out at $115. Nice ride from last April, 1,000 shares at $53!!!"
140 today
Ummm. You value their infill class A real estate at less than 150 psf. Clearly you are short or clueless.
"@amrita poster says ""If in down market"".....HUH?......Markets have been hitting ALL TIME HIGHS.....don't let stupid people take up space in your brain!"
"Simon negotiating better terms on the TCO deal will give the stock a huge boost. I have read through pages and pages of information on this. On the surface it seems difficult for Simon to walkout, however, they can still squeeze some juice out of it by threatening to walk out and fight a long legal battle. The merger is in the favor of both parties, however, not at this price. Each $1 off of $52.5 saves Simon $60 million. If they negotiate an out of court price of $40-$45 per share, it would be hugely beneficial for both Simon and TCO."
"A lot of firm and analyst start jumping out within these 2 days to downgrade value stock that run up on Monday. They try to bring down the share price so that they can jump on the boat, there's no reason the downgrade come right after the huge surge and not when these stock are beaten to death few weeks ago. Hold on to your stock longs."
I'm in and just holding long. tried to dance and make some extra money but I'm done unless this goes back to 75 I'll get more
J.Crew Group is peering into the DEBT abyss. That's 520 stores that would end up being caverns.
"Shares had their run, now Robinhooders will pull back and momentum will fade. Dividend will likely be cut 35% and then heading into the fall, there are many challenges that will act as tailwinds. And if SPG takes on more debt to save a failing JCP on top of Taubman. I see a pullback into the 80s for sure!"
"Don't watch YouTube videos of this company's CEO pumping you on silver...be a grown up and read Quarterly reports, SEC filings (pay attention to footnotes) and figure out how much silver the 3 remaining mines have left. Research the Mexican president (AMLO) and how hard headed he is...that $209 million tax bill will be collected if you've read anything on this guys personality and his previous dealings with tax arrears. If these mining CEO truly truly believed silver is soon to shoot to the moon, just why wouldn't they quit selling at these prices? Sell only enough to fund operations and pay the bills. In fact during the coronovirus, corporate staff should have taken pay reductions like some other companies did (see #SPG for example)...simple Mall owner worth billions...everyone took partial pay and it's same going into next quarter.....Biggest thing is ask yourself why this CEO can make videos, but CAN NOT deliver an Earnings Conference Call.....financial scam disguising as a miner!"

approximately 164 which is still very high.
Nice new low for simple Simon today. Just the scent of a 3% T-bill rate sends you mall rats into a hissy fit.
"In reaction to closure of all properties till 3/29.Overreaction by far, payout will continue (REITS laws) and even if slashed will still be generous."
Just bought more cheap stock. Don’t miss it! And enjoy the divi while you’re waiting!
Does anyone know SPG's next dividend payout?
current price reflects a 75% cut in dividend
Watch they buyout small company’s pennies
Who's watching stimulus plan that was supposed to be done before election?....Smart Money (Funds) are. Dumb money taking about dividends. while stock is down 10% since last dividend payment. Retail schmucks just delight me.
"They have a 95% occupancy rate right now which is very close to historical rate, it’s ready to explode to the upside.."
WMT will be giving AMZN all the competition they can handle. WMT going up like crazy.
anyone can tell me please. i was bought spg today 7/9/2020 do i qualify dividend pay 7/24/2020 thank you.
SPG-PJ reached an all time low at 47.75
Coronavirus will kill this stock
Beast heading a lot higher with a “scrumptious “ dividend that’s rock solid
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/simon-property-misses-3q-sales-123705275.html...and this is BEFORE the current US nationwide C19 explosion. An amazing short at this altitude. And for those who were ready to hang their hat on #SPG with rumors of a flip to AMZN fulfillment centers, perhaps check into what sq. ft. valuations look like for active retail anchors vs warehouse space. I do think this will be a profitable spec @ $US40-50 if they can weather the challenges of the next year. They are well positioned IF they can stay afloat. No way is the principal risk worth the dividend. Seek current income in a less volatile, more diversified REIT like #MPW."
My 1000 from this am out there at $124
"closed at a fresh, new 52wk low friday.All-in short monday, adding on any and every attempt to climb back over $150.Time for this pig to break in earnest, and revisit par sometime this summer, if not sooner."
This is garbage. Move to cloud is real. Wait for 23-30 at max. DIV cut is coming. They can't afford the dividend without more debt.
"Yeah, so they're suing Gap. Suing all tenants who miss their payments doesn't seem like a real sustainable operating model. And good luck pulling the Taubman Deal. More lawyer$. Do your homework, kids. SPG carries major exposure in states with rising virus rates, again. Folks aren't running back to shop in Vegas so soon. And those that do wont have the bucks to spend. I think David Simon is a brilliant helmsman. But now they're bailing the boat with a teaspoon, storm waters even the very best of the best could not have possibly anticipated. Hedge your longs."
This is too powerful to stop
"Will sell more puts if it drops below $110 for strike price of $105. Good long term holds, one of the recovery trades together with KO, PEP, BA etc."
Does anyone else ever read (http://Pick-stocks.com)? They just mentioned SPG this morning.

i will buy at 145
Beat shorts by investing in SPG its undervalued and pays awesome dividends. If stock price is manipulated by wall street then atleast collect dividends because REITS have to pay out 90% of profits as dividends by US LAW. #spg
why is it going up
bitter nasty lawsuit. super hard ball
Break out coming. Buy the dips and stay long for the next 5 years

Simon is the best!!
How can I buy SPG at 55 USD? Why today it doesn't crash like the rest?
"Is retail bottomed? Jared Dillon is the only finance guy I read and he thinks so. Below is his article on the subject.Ding￼I’m sure you’ve heard that malls are getting killed. Pretty soon there will be no malls. Except for those with a Planet Fitness!￼Source: WZZMThere has been lots of ink (and electrons) spilled over the death of retail.Everyone knows it is only a matter of time before Amazon puts every department store, every mall, every brick-and-mortar retailer out of business. Amazon gets an infinity market cap and everyone else gets zero. Sound familiar?That’s the accepted wisdom.Is Amazon a great business? Yes.Is a department store a bad business? Probably.Does Amazon get 100% market share, with department stores getting zero? Probably not.Amazon has over 80 million Prime subscribers in the US. It’s not quite saturated, but it’s getting close.￼I admit to being a Prime member, a late adopter.It is pretty cool. Stuff shows up on my doorstep in two days, for free. The huge poker chip set I just ordered probably weighs about 40 pounds—free shipping! And I get all the Prime movies and TV shows.Sometimes, when I reflect on what a good deal Amazon Prime is, I think that I’m picking Amazon off. But they’re probably picking me off! 80 million customers times $100 is a lot of money.Here is my thesis: Amazon will grow and grow, but there will always be a role for physical retailers. A reduced role, for sure, but there will always be a role.From a capital markets standpoint, now might be the time to put on the trade.The BottomThis is when I started thinking that we've reached a bottom in physical retailers: Last week, ProShares—a $27 billion ETF manager—registered to list some double short leveraged ETFs on brick and mortar retailers! According to Bloomberg, “The ProShares UltraShort Bricks and Mortar Retail fund and ProShares UltraPro Short Bricks and Mortar Retail fund will seek to use derivatives to generate daily returns of two or three times the inverse of an index comprising the most at-risk US retailers…”Ding!In my experience, specialty ETFs like this are usually listed at the worst possible times. Plus, you know my thoughts on leveraged ETFs.When 2x short leveraged ETFs are being listed on physical retailers… it is probably time to buy physical retailers.￼This infographic from AEI is a couple of months old. Since then, Amazon’s market cap has increased to $481 billion. Meanwhile, Macy’s market cap has fallen to a little under $6.5 billion.Amazon is worth around 75 times more than Macy’s? That doesn’t seem right.I hope by this point in the article I have you thinking.I am no Macy’s fan. It is a pretty terrible business, they sell middlebrow stuff in middlebrow locations. Although their online business is actually not bad.I used to buy ties at Macy’s, back in 2001. People laughed at those ties. I no longer buy ties at Macy’s.￼But look—at a $6.5 billion market cap, Macy’s is reaching distressed levels. That means we have to put our distressed investor hat on, pick this business apart, and see if there is value—in all parts of the capital structure. Maybe we don’t like the stock, but maybe we like the bonds, for example. And, Staples was bought by private equity recently for about 0.4 times revenue. Apply that standard to Macy’s and you get to a $10 billion valuation. They’re still kicking.Plus, there’s an argument that this whole Internet retailing thing is just a giant bubble, according to the chart below.￼Source: @bySamRoHow Do You Play It?This is a smart trade, but it is also a dangerous trade unless you are smart.There are two ways to do this:1) Be a distressed investor: Look at the worst-case scenario, look at all parts of the capital structure, and find value.2) Be a quant: Buy a basket of physical retailers, sell a basket of Internet retailers, and wait for them to converge.The worst way to play it is just to naively buy Macy’s (or another retailer) and hope for the best.Furthermore, I think it’s time to go dumpster-diving in Mall REITs, which is what we’re going to do in the next issue of Street Freak."
We found bottom at .38 Fibinnocci level ... confirming upward trend ... after pull back from double top ... trading up X dividend. Quite positive.
Nice! Filled
SPG is up 10.21% to 61.43

This is your chance toGet out watch how the vaccines fail
is the dividend intact?
Last Q on Aug 30th I got $1200 in dividends then sold out at 162 and bought back in. Did you all do that??If you did congratulations. !
Bought the weakness again!
SPG seems to be doing nicely for a company that a gloom poster keeps telling us is going broke. For past six weeks it has been well above the 50 day moving average.
These guys are brilliant and patriotic at the same time! Making money AND saving jobs. Should he given a Medal of Honor
The malls begin to see a lot of visitors again!! This stock will be at 150$ soon !!
Jpc buyout news ruined our momentum.. Bad decision from management
"So, on conference call Simon was bragging of getting Penny's for $500 million. Well, he got it, for 60% more ($800 million)....Funny how H/2 Capital funds bought the distribution centers. Guess JCPENNY/Simon property group will have to rent those centers to distribute Simon brand clothing. Biggest reveal is that #SPG & Brookfield didn't want thousands of co-tenancy clauses triggered by losing the Mall anchors. This still won't be enough to save anything more than the best malls. Retail apocalypse coming from now until 2023."
It will discount by one percent tomorrow for good entry.Who cares about the div if you can get in at decent price.
125 soon
trust me its all scamsor i should my head with a bottle of beer
"4.5% cash dividend yield is a warning sign from the market. It's a high yield relative to the market as a whole, and fear exist abbut the underlying capital stock price, and/or the marketplace doubts the viability of that dividend for the long haul. When dabbling with retail shopping malls REIT, one wonders if adequate maintenance is being done to be paying out 4.5% ""yield."" ?"
I bet they haven't announced because they don't know how much the increase is going to be
Up 3 tommorow massive rotation is ongoing to reits and industrials and value: ignore futures focus on each stock independently

Buying on the dip!!!
"Costco and Walmart have been killing the Malls for several years. This is the final nail in the coffin for SPGBoth Costco and Walmart stock are better investments than these vacant malls. All the best, Brad."
"@n00 yes, but I agree with Gary. Your being very short-sighted for a stock that is strong and will probably break back into the $100 range again within the next 2 months. Provided no coronavirus, new administration, or apocalyptic scenarios. I know that's a lot of caveats but it's been a strange year.Also with the purchase of JC Penney and possibilities of working with Amazon on more distribution centers I wouldn't be surprised if Simon gets back to its pre-covid prices within 6 months. my opinion of course."
"@Joe's post(s) only counts if you listen and act to what he's posting...and, of course, using some common sense. When pumpers attack an impartial poster, it's better to see who's posting factual information or fairytale stories like @steve, et al."
Buy the dips all day long!
Does anyone know when SPG's shopping malls open?
Home Depot was pretty crowded this weekend.
"Great earnings, improving cashflow, stronger occupancy and rental contracts with departmental stores like Dillards, Macy, #$%$ Sporting goods etc. SPG is now on a rebound with very strong fundamentals. And at 5% dividend and improving growth story, the investment is a no-brainer!Enjoy the ride, Longs!"
"After the nice 2 week 35% run, and the epic 2 day 20% bounce that the idiots Neamtu and Benjo obviously missed out on, I’m hoping for the healthy few bucks normal pullback from profit taking tomorrow on Friday, so I can buy more a few bucks cheaper on the fun road up to $120 in February...."
Where is symbol Spg ?? Ugh !!!
Thank you for the cheap price. I am now a spg shareholder
I told you 85 2 months back
"If Trump/Pence win I’m buying SPG, if Biden wins I’m shorting it, and CCL too"
I seriously don’t get why people voted for Biden that will raise your taxes and shutdown economy. I guess people like that lol. I just dont get people
i think no one interested in this stock..jts going down only from last 6 months
The trend is your friend...going higher!
Under $80 soon. Wow look at TCO!! Down over $17
Great potential You just have to know when to buy in
but this could also be consolidated and it's really tight
Is it possible to see your stock portfolio double in a month and still have an awful gut wrenching feeling? I bought in near the bottom but I was restrained at how much of everything I bought. I never imagined the market would recover so strong and so fast. I should have gone all in and then some 
I put an buy order @$40.56 gtc
Don’t be surprised to see David take this private this year. Assets worth triple.
looking at the 20 60 200 ma... over the last 6 m this is charting with the potential to move up to 68
Buy the weakness and be rewarded. $150 end of year.
i give up all my stocks are down 20% not winning vs virus and communism
SPG and MAC are at resistance. Healthy pull back. Should get over resistance next week and going much higher.
"Wells Fargo just downgraded, time to buy. Oversold."
All the big money pros must know that the earnings will be low when they report before the market opens tomorrow morning.
raked in another profit plus dividends while Barney keep whining about Simons grasping reality. Instead of trying to make money on SPG stock all Barney does is useless talk.
Most of these Simon malls will need to be bulldozed.Shoppers will not be returning to these virus caves.
@Steve still claims target and Walmart are (#SPG) mall anchor stores and Amazon taking empty Sears and Macy's space....NOT.
Divi paid every 3 months. Last payment 1/22. Next payment will be next month around this time
Nothing worse than a big empty mall that you have to pay taxes on.
Bought the open. Going way higher! TCO purchase was a steal! Simon - maters at the game
new 52 week high today! Go SPG
All I care about is dividend and net earnings. Sounds fine to me.
you worried about David Simon ! You better start worrying about Amazon if the market tips its hat to a bear market if interest rates continue to rise. Amazon could fall a couple hundred points
Hello $50s' here I come.....
wait did they delay their earnings call?
Uh...Oh....here comes the roll-over.
"There's one contraindicator telling that SPG will win the bidding - they will probably loose the bid.Check online for the one who published it, that's one of my 5 favourite contraindicators."

awesome day bought back again and will sell tomorrow at matket open

$150 year end. Buy any weakness
If you can grab SPAC shares under $10 it will be a homerun. David said JCP going to turn out to be $1 billion at least
"What are they going to do with the money losing enterprise that is J.C. Penny's? I can't imagine it will continue to operate like it has. They want to save the business..and jobs {supposedly}, but it is a department store and that model appears to be dead. Even Macy's is struggling, and they are far better than Penny's. Using them as distribution centers sounded with Amazon leasing them sounded better than a plan to revive Penny's. Without Amazon tie up, what are they getting? I am not sure i get it. Anyone have any insights?"
Back in the game at 54.75.
Money in the bank. Question is when is David going to raise it? Stock flies when he does.
this is brutal what the heck why?
boughy back for day trade
"Who is dumping today ? The stock price assumes that we are going to be in lock down for the rest of the year and only Amazon, Costco and Kroger etc. will continue operating full scale."

This stock will explode because the next year we won’t have the virus !
strip malls are converted into multi use apartments/condos/retails ... look for Simon to expand into this niche market! $200 in 18 months! load it or the orange will buy for them all ....

"Amazon not interested in empty mall anchors. Listen to conference call.....he wouldn't answer this question last CC, but did this time. All those rumors and pumpers...lol.....I shouldn't be saying this because I still want $84 to short this again :-)"
Brilliant move. Brilliant! Bought exactly what they wanted at a discount. I like it 
Market going back to 20000
Was hoping to break $100 this week. Need a big day today and tomorrow

Don’t believe the fake board or any fake news. These guys are killing it. No one better! Listen to the call. Simon is a stud
remove uncertainties is good for both companies
#MAC was down 2.95% yesterday on disappointing earnings.
Why not but quality REIT at discount? Obvious decline but does anyone think malls will disappear? Impossible consider it's a pastime for many just to stroll through or eat at the food courts. There's new high end places coming up in NJ; IMO that's where it will grow in affluent areas.
"The debt is biggest issue here, and move to cloud is another."

"Not worth the stress, closing position.. too many other good stocks. Sell off seems over done with no merit."
"I bought SHOP, instead of SPG. SPG has too many problems."
This is one volatile stock
Everytime this goes down it shoots right back up next few days. This will be around 55 in 48 hours if not more
lets break 150
joe #$%$ on SPG but I Bet he dont have any money on the line lol
keep a lid on it. I need to sell some other stocks to get more cash to buy more of this one.
SPG reached a new 52 Week Low at 148.63
Just bought a piece more on the pullback. Position growing.
bed wetters better get out of there short position... relief bill going to be signed
Should get back to $100 fast. Buckle up
i like spg and own shares. i do think they may need to cut their dividend. it would be prudent to do so at least for the short term. i would hope the market is expecting it and would not react negatively. it is a very high dividend and even with a cut should have a good yield. .....glta
Predictions for Friday?
why it keep going down?
Paris shutting down again and it's only October.
"Folks are seeing that it was $150 pre-Covid with a nice dividend, and can double your money here"
Dividend cut tomorrow?
This is a heavily manipulated stock. There must be good news that is not available to the public yet so the manipulator is taking the price down for a reload. I am buying.
Run up is going to be very swift - COVID is done.
"Incredible they announce 17,500,000 share dilution with no price tag. BIG TIME SHORT....not going off at $80/share....I can tell you that much!!"
"For those that are concerned about the retail bankruptcies, you need to consider whether it is a Chapter 11 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy. There is a huge difference, and the wonderful people feeding the news to you don't seem to know the difference report as if everything is Chapter 13. Lord and Taylor filed Chapter 11, which is reorganization. It means they currently can't meet their obligations and they need some relief for a period of time. It does not mean they are going out of business (Chapter 13). It's certainly not a good sign, but it means there is still a path forward if they can get some help. It's quite clear that lenders and landlords and everyone else are going to be extra lenient this year. Some will go under for sure, but only time will tell how many.Note the ""going out of business"" graphic on this article--completely inaccurate.https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/02/business/lord-and-taylor-bankruptcy/index.html"
she will be up soon
Will switch to SKT now.
will we see pull back or its going back to 150 soon?
How’s financial report?
"this is strange stocks. I got it around $60 and hold it till $87. ""Then I got burnt when it went back to $60s. Anyway, I am not trusting this one with new virus spray across the nations.

Bought more at $72.25
Covid is literally over in days wall st sees itOnly muppets dont
Worst stock for pandemic and post pandemic. Online killing it. Why go to virus infected mall when you can shop from home? 90% of mall tenants bailing. Get out quick!
Actually paying far more than pre covid for Taubman. Would have needed to sell far less shares to raise the same money even with the discounted price. Anyone been to a mall lately? Not me! And my money won’t be shopping there for a while. Fundamentally dead! USA could close half the malls in this country and not miss them. They’re not coming back no matter how many retailers they buy to save rent collections. Ridiculous concept. Retail bankruptcies have just begun. So many better places to park money! I’m short and will bank on that!
BTIG analyst James Sullivan raised the price target on Simon Property Group to $125.00 from $99.00!!!!
The Simon web site shows 104 J Crew stores at their properties. These are likely smaller sq. ft. stores but the retail brick & mortar bankruptcy's may just be starting.Simon will likely be stuck with all these J Crew unpaid rents and empty stores with more to come.
"Capri, owner of Versace, Korea and Choo brands along with Ralph Lauren Quarterly Results show Widespread Damage to Apparel Sales.....you can listen to posters about this Mall or that having foot traffic or you can look at Retailers actual, devastating losses. Your choice; do some real Due Diligence here."
Well its getting close for earnings. What is everyone analysis of how well/unwell they did this quarter?
Volume cut in HALF.....funds selling to retail schmucks.
this stock market is an absolute joke
Simon closed all its malls!Good riddance !
we are in uncharted territory since the pop. my low trend line area is around 70. I sold 100 shares at open. turned around and purchased 150. and will go in around 10 more grand at 70.
Glad to know you Joe. The only fallen flag on SPG. laugh
"No Amazon talks....thank you Mr. Simon for finally putting that nonsensical rumor to rest. He does give a good conference call, but he hedges a lot, which you really can't blame him during these times."
"Hey Jane, looks like a flushing day today.. upwards "
This is an S&P 100 company with a solid balance sheet at a discount price.

I started selling and buying puts at 12:51 pm.
Good thing i bought the dip again.
$80 next month
volume 7.5 mill already that's on track to break 25 mill
total garbage but I bought for day trade
Love the cheap morning stock!
Just imagine what historically normalized interest rates do to the $23 Billion debt heap which is collateralized by ever increasingly empty retail malls ? Run Simon run !!
Good news!
spg earning will be epic!
I listen to the call too! they stated they by choice gave some tenants a rent break the Q for the betterment of all to take the pressure off the retailers. a little Q4 covid unknowns but that's been known! they weathered the storm got great stores for cheap and expect to manage them better and make money.
"Tailored Brands - (today) ""Bankruptcy Likely""."
Great article by Zacks on exploding OI and Vol for SPG options yesterday and today. Market psychology is clearly defined. Short. Full stop.
"the down trend is not looking good, its a slow selling with a reason"
most likely the country will gradually open at end of April.
Green into the close on an armageddon day ON volume
Any morning dip on retail sales is a screaming buy. We’re going way higher.
approximately 20 million shares are short... Should provide a bounce after this turns green today

"To poster @Michael - see #cnbc# story about dollar depreciation (devaluation really) from analyst at Standard Chartered Bank. If you're young you need to be in stocks that protect you from what will certainly be a US dollar devaluation....that would be overseas stocks or even base mining companies like #BHP i mentioned. The debts and deficits will absolutely destroy your generation's living standard unless you invest in the right investments. I'd suggest doing some due diligence on that front...start with that article I mentioned above. All my kids and grandkids are protected.....retail stocks good for a trade, but think actual real estate for yourself, farmland or for R/E for income, then other hard assets, not soft goods....good luck!"
SPG is up 11.79% to 52.23

$68+ coming up
Why are this and MAC (both mall REITs) the only two recovery stocks rising today??
"whats the attraction here? SPG has gone from 184 to 140 in 1 year, getting a nice dividend is good but at what cost? I would love to hear from some people who are much smarter than I am, would really like to understand how this is good."
AmaZon investing in physical real estate including offiesAs muppets bash reits
"the ""experts"" are probably still ""watching"" as SPG continues to rally ...a bunch of geniuses ... lol"

"Yeah I'm an optimist, but SPG is leveling, the same as Aston Martin."
It was hard but I loaded up on SPG when it was in the $60's. Me thinks I might average on the ride up.
simple Simon buys up it's own tenant to prevent even more vacant cavities in your declining malls.Aeropostale
Just bought another 1000 shares. Now own 5000. My limit. Selling half at $150 and keeping the resr
I feel like our dividend might be going away in the near future
Do I understand correctly they are not going to accept any beaks in rent payments? They are suing GAP eg. So we should see at least $120 in the blink of an eye.
The demise of retail has been grossly over exaggerated

The article of Jennifer Matthews on Yahoo Financials says debt approx. 23 million and total debt 26 millionSo where does Barney get his information???????Is he posting false information???
Thank you for the cheap shares. Will be buying as much as possible. If you have the time and the risk tolerance you can buy into the best real estate in the world for now only about 220 per square foot. Amazing. Simply amazing
At what point while reopening do we realize how oversold SPG is?
we had a goog rip today

guys what time does simon’s earnings release come out? Is it 1hr before the call?
David Simon is a smart man and you can tell he is very well respected because he doesnt make promises he doesnt keep or give false hope information..he is straight as an arrow but does give hints to the positive direction SPG is heading..They have done a great job and are now in a much bette spot. Money is here

"Online retail sales are under 12% of sales and people still say malls are a thing of the past!!!! CRAZY!. One thing is not refutable, which is that some malls will definitely stay. And which mall is in a better place than SPG!(with so many malls getting worse over the past 10 years, SPG did better each year!)the more malls that go bankrupt the better for SPG. Also must mention the large insider ownership!! Half of my portfolio is SPG. Am I making a mistake?"
Nothing can stop this landlord only crying babies will cry like JOE
if gold is too expensive they buy this one.
healthy correction. it was overpriced anyways sp500 should be 2900-3000
"I own 5200 shares. Lets go baby, LETS GOOOOOO!!!!"
Why did SPG overpay TCO? TCO balance sheet is a disaster. They have been paying dividends with principle.
After hour market not impressed.
possible back to $46
Everyone fear when they hear Simon property
"Dividend Tax QuestionDoes anyone know why the dividend received 01/22/21 is considered taxable income for tax year 2020?Just got my 1099 from Schwab and this is the first time I've ever seen something like that. SPG sent a notice out on 01/15/21 saying this was going to happen, but have no idea why cash not received until 2021 would be taxable in 2020. TIA"
Sell the news $65.00 stay alive.
Just bought more before the close 
$150 end of year. Buy the dips and stay long. Easy one here. 6% while you wait
Anyone short this stock should cover ASAP! $150 soon!
Unprecedented Strength.
"One thing I think we'll see post Covid-19 is stores and restaurants in need of more space in order to be able to give customers more room to physically distance. Also think this will play out in office REITs like VNO too. Companies, especially in NYC where Vornado is, will have to give employees more space form each other and not sit them right on top of each other. Now, this might make companies try and put pressure on the property owners to reduce the price per square foot but overall I think the need for additional square feet will eventually help balance out some of the troubles brought on by Covid."
@amrita poster is 100% clueless on bankruptcy laws. sheesh....where do these people come from?
the other problem Is the people who bought from 62 to 80 might not be wanting to sell... the might be pinned becase of up upward volume
Nice divi and buy the dips. $150 before you know it
All stores reopened and busy in Florida. All Apple Stores too.

...and #SimonPropertyGroup continues to unload their cash in all the wrong places. #Brooks Brothers as an iconic brand worth saving? The strategy for resuscitating 80's icons may have briefly worked for Burberry back in 2013 but so much has changed. The Brooks Brothers look hasn't floated the boat since Gordon Gekko rocked his suspenders in the film Wall Street(circa 1987). Who's buying a suit when we're all working from home and weddings and funerals are virtual? Support at $US40.
I have a feeling it will hit 56 today 
perfect .sane pattern
@paresh......glad you sold now right?....perhaps get some April calls.

"Our team wants the Simons to borrow billions, more, to build retail malls at every interstate cloverleaf in America.Really, what could happen ?!"
"Mid $50’s coming soon, malls are dead and half the stores are out of business. I went to 2 malls over the weekend and about half the stores were out of business and empty. That’s not good for Simon. How do they expect to bring in new tenants?"
congrats everyone that held like me lol
"Everyobody who bought Simon has lost their money.This is agood example of why you don't chase a yield. All the best, Brad."
Trading range. Need to break out above $122
I think this is heading much higher. I drive by malls in the area and they are packed like Christmas. Pent up demand along with people tired of staying home. Continued upward trend with vaccine being ramped up and more stimulus money coming.
what's the feeling on debt settlement?
Realistic this stock can trade at 25 all day long. Will it get there maybe I think more likely than not even if they do open up the malls
"Simon's Board of Directors has declared a $1.30 per common share dividend, payable in cash, for the first quarter 2021. The dividend will be payable on April 23, 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 9, 2021."

If the dividend is paid out in July are you guessing the dividend will be $1.05 instead of $2.10?

"Who forgot to sell Simon summer of 2016 ? That was your last gasp of decent bids.Retail malls are in secular decline, but that won't waive off your $23.4 BILLION debt load.I will say this for Simon, no goodwill nor intangibles on the balance sheet, but billions of dollars of DEBT, with interest expense, supported by the 'collateral' of declining retail malls."
Earning report meeting only at 5PM ET
Malls are dying.
It will tank bigly like $SPG $SKT $WPG $CBL $TCO
Another institution buying up REIT units for the predictable recovery.$SPG $BPYhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/josh-brown-predicts-end-market-163113425.html
SPG will slash dividend in half. 7.5% return at this price. Stock soars to $80. The HUGE investment by the government will cause inflation which will create more equity for SPG. Stock hits $150 next year
it pays not to listen to analysts ..... downgrade my asp ....
"If the market looks 6 months out, SPG should be $150 fast"
Investors may want to see last evening's CDC NOTICE regarding dining establishments. #SPG has some of those as tenants don't they?
im tempted now to get in on it if it goes lower then 55
"SPG is savvy but I don't know if they can keep ahead of the dying mall trend. Here in Albuquerque they sold the once immensely popular but now dying Cottonwood Mall and bought the up and coming outdoor Uptown Mall. Uptown features more restaraunts, IMAX movie theater, walkable scenic areas, Dave and Busters, and the popular luxury retailer discount chain Nordstrom Rack. America is over saturated in retail which we all know, if SPG can continue to divest itself of its dogs and invest in the up and coming shopping/entertainment venues it should be just fine."
Here come the upgrades.....smart $ doing some math
"Opened a long spread 50/100 2022 at $9. Unless SPG goes bankrupt in next 2 years, I see it as reasonable bet.."
s p g
Stimulus is dead. I've been warning you....
congratulations you all. I sold at 65ish. (bought for around 60s) I dident see it coming back like. I'm happy for anyone who held. (no spam no bs no short ) just wanted to say my hats off to you all. :) 
Green ! Can get very interesting now
"Has anyone on this board visited a Simon center recently? Are they busy? Are people lined-up in front of stores? Are the parking lots full? I don't live near a Simon Center, but when I look at other COVID-19 beaten down stocks, SPG seems to be a bargain, trading at approx 57% of it's pre-pandemic level. Other COVID-19 affected businesses, like Marriott, Wynn, and Southwest are trading at about 80% of their pre-pandemic levels -- but are currently losing money; even now, SPG turns a profit. While this may dip back down into the 70's after the ex-dividend date, I'm inclined to believe that this time next year, after many are vaccinated, we'll be back in the 120's or higher. This stock may be one of the best bargains on the market for the simple fact that this pandemic shows that lots of folks HATE staying home, and want to go out to restaurants, bars, shopping, Disneyland etc. I don't know anyone that says ""gee, I love staying home, ordering everything from Amazon, and not leaving my house."""
Might go to $50 by November
"It was 150 prior to covid 19, down to lower 50s while covid was top. Now people are openning up everywhere and some people wait to get to lower 40s to buy. comeon you make me laugh. hood luck with that. next week this will be back in the 90s"
Oh no....I'm green again @Kelly....and will be even MORE GREEN next week!!
I feel some big short players are now manipulating the price...
Carl driving it down ? That wont last . I'm a buyer if it goes lower. And the lower it goes the more I will buy.

"SPG is crazy, it goes up when the Dow goes down and goes down when the Dow goes up!!!"
Buy the dips....patience
How were not at $100 by now is surprising to me. Money chasing high flyers.
David Simeon said it again investing is a herd mentality like what is going on here
Nice run at 119. Lucky opp to buy the dip
Today is the last day to get the big divvy. Shorts will have to pay the divvy if they hold after today.
We're going into the 3Q . Since the beginning of this year SPG has been trading in 180's twice. So the mall traffic was bad then and the stock was up now its bad again? Did anyone take the time to listen to the last CC of what David Simon said? So far in the last 3 years its been the same problem and yet the dividends has gone up from 1.75 to 2.05 today. I don't know maybe there is something wrong here. There are always those like Trading Professor on every board touting what they believe since they probably short on the stock but anyone who really is won't waste time talking it up every change they get. Ive seen this for the last 15 years now and it's never changed.
goes up 3.5 on Tues then gets wacked down 10 Wed and Thurs.
"Ha ha, their buying jcpenney, they have no choice cause if penny closes there goes the malls. Talk about jumping on a sinking ship,"
SPG is up 8.54% to 48.76
Yup. EZ parcheesie. Still worth $80.00 even with reduced earnings. Just getting her sea legs back now.
skt is higher than pre pandemic
glad I sold at 140 range..this is total trash
"@Robotech......you better alert those oil companies about all the cars on the road because they're all going into red as we speak, while Indexes are way up."
MSN had 22 picture slide show of companies not paying rent or paying only 25%....#SPG mentioned in 13 of the companies refusing to pay rent. Too funny...next Quarter will show true extent of Retail Apocalypse.
Does anyone else ever read (http://Multistockalerts.com)? They just mentioned SPG this morning.
"Simon executives are telling you that mall assets are worth less and that their tenants are not paying rent, yet smug Robinhood millenials bid up the stock. This is yet another indicator of the worst stock bubble I've seen in my lifetime."
Over under when SPG is back to $150?
MAC resume upward trend on earnings for mall REIT plus it beats expectation. The only disappointment is #JOE. What a joke. lol
How many times can people panic sell the same newsFor 7 months? Covid has a kill rate of the flu
"OH OH , high ya all. Do you see it is up 3.44 now. You see buy when it drops then sell now. In the meantime I'm waiting on 800 dollars dividends from the Q from these collapsing malls you keep talking about. I wish I would have loaded up more when it went down to 151.3 yesterday.Hello ya all how are"
I'll be shorting again if it hits $84 :-)
Shorts r screwed Monday- authentic brands just joined on
next big move day will be Q3 numbers release
I'm buying any weakness here. Positive news out for retail.
Market telling you everything. Genius
With the trump corporate tax cuts and resulting earnings you had to know Simon would spike into and after earnings!!!
Covid gonna be in rear view soon. SPG break out coming
@Joe the stock is moving up and there is no way that your short position will survive for long baby! remember above $80 you owe me lunch sir!

joe is the same person who walks in a park with a mask on
all the store closings wreaking havoc on State budgets from loss of sales taxes to empty buildings wrecking town center plans and ruining dreams of revitalization. Now sooner or later the States will have to take action on online sales to make up for the lost revenue and when that happens the great Amazon stock will take a big tumble.
"So if the sales at the malls are not $650 per square foot, how do the tenants afford the exhorbitant rents?The rents are so high at Simon's malls that they'll have to be cut. All the best, Brad"
kinda wierd it's up so much ah
"I, like most people are tired of home confinement and shopping onine. Tired of the boxes pilling up. I need to get my life back and be out there shopping, dining, watching movies in theater, going to sport/music events etc...Malls are going to even be busier post pandemic because there will be fewer and people are just ready to get out! This company will be making more money and paying better dividend from 2022. Best and safest investment right now..."
"Joe is a fool. Joe claimed mall now have empty spaces while alpha article said as of August 91%of Simon's tenants were open and operating. Joe the fool.""As of August, 91% of Simon's tenants were open and operating. Additionally, management reported that by June, average tenant sales volume increased to more than 80% of prior-year volumes.""https://seekingalpha.com/article/4385773-8_2-yielding-simon-property-group-priced-for-disaster-wont-happen?utm_source=marketchameleon.com&utm_medium=referral"
"Great deal for SPG on $TCO discount. In 5-10 years SPG holders will be laughing. I do not hold SPG or TCO, but do feel the risk/reward for SPG is very good here."
"Again, do NOT buy this stock right now.... it’s going to test the $40’s again. Specially when they announced dividends cut! Just be patient! Don’t listen to the people that says “ it won’t go below $50 there is no way it will be $200 by end of the year”"
Still have a chance to hit $100 by Dec 31
This will be in $1000 in 3 years
Futures nice and green...up big time. Get ready for the bull rush
Basing out at these levels. Range bound $116-$121. Needs some oomph to break out

Online Competition PT 1https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/28/what-trump-could-do-to-amazon-tax-treatment.html
why do people get sucked into this loser for dividend? down 50%
"I know the lawsuit with TCO and biden's strict covid procedures has an affect on the stock, but post TCO lawsuit (hopefully there's a settlement) the floor on this stock should rise everyday. We've been hovering between 58-65 forever, this should be a triple digit stock by the time the economy reopens."
King of all king of malls
there you go Michael Kors closing 100 stores. Now how to you think the cities an and states that get sales tax and property tax well fare? Not to well I think. So do you think they will sit around and do nothing. Now the Stores that Kors is closing are in not too good business areas. Remember Simon has ONLY 47% of it's business in malls and from what I hear they doing ok. Now do you really think that Simon is expanding globally because of all the store closings?. Do you think that Simons are buying back a lot of stock because of all these store closings.? So far there have been TWO earnings reports and the 30 dollar decline from the 1st ER to 153 and 4.6% dividend. Now Simon is not stupid. They can get into this online stuff just like Amazon. Amazon will not dominate forever. Have you ever heard of competition. Like Amazon got 90% of online so far and that is a monopoly in the online business. That will change.
I think SPG is going to declare $1.50 dividend this quarter. Does anyone else agree? They have finished the TCO acquisition and the problems of 2020 are mostly over...so why not?

Still wondering how long it’s going to take the market to figure out this one?
Likely head fake in morning and backup to mid 80s by end of the day

Looking for early am cheap stock. Covid cases are plummeting.

SPG deserve to get credit for keeping 70000 jobs at this critical moment in this country. not like Buffet who only care about the $$$$
All I do is BUY BUY BUY! :D
Buying the dips all day long. $100 in no time
Real estate bubble needs to be popped like the stock market.
Headwinds for SPG. Interest rate is going up and retail are in a depression.

"Retail sales are now at around the 2010 level (setback of 10 years) and my assumption is that now with the summer it's increasing to a higher level. Here in Europe people are shopping more confidently; Asia has recovered too, USA is lagging. Sooner or later USA will implement safer ways for people to shop and then confidence will go up."
Bought my 1000 trading position back. Back to 4k. Let’s go SPG!
See you at 50.00
So? Dividend cut or not?
Still looking for 64 but if it doesnt make it I will have to load some at least between 64 and 69 .

"Great conference call. Takeaways from the call from my perspective were the following. 1. Things aren?t even close to being as bad as others report. 2. Their balance sheet is beyond pristine. Beyond beyond. 3. Retailers owe the rent. Period. Deferrals are because SPG has the balance sheet and the capacity to help and they are kind. Their contracts are strong. 4. Stock price is stupid cheap per CEO but he understands people have fear 5 dividend will paid in cash and from what I heard and implied, earnings are Strong even in a downturn. 6.

"SPG reported some $35MM in profit from SPARC last quarter. That is without JCP. Has anybody tried to guestimate what impact SPARC JV might have on EPS a few years out? Not much info in the SEC filing other than line item disclosure.

Simon can only choke back the fumes of old leases so long. Eventually the rates are renegotiated down, or tenants like Radio Shack tell the landlord to take a hike. LOL"
I am still not buying. I want to pay $30
SPG reached a 52 Week low at 43.06
is it good buy? any suggestions
Bought 2k shrs @ avg 58.60 Hoping this is for real. GL
I think we will go below 73$ today
Do not catch a falling knife ! Bankruptcy is expected for Simon
"been hearing about SPG did a little research on it a while back and still didn't pull the trigger, now watching the news and see that SPG has taken ownership of one of my local malls in my city. I'm like oh shoot I own them! then i checked my account and realized i never made that purchase"
Seem to have hit its peak for awhile .
Even if the stock gets lower than this just imagine a year or more from now. Load up.
Moodys: Retail profits won't rebound until 2022!.....of course I told you that much earlier. Retail apocalypse for another 18 months minimum.

"Everyone in the USA who wants a vaccine will likely be able to have one by May or June. This will exponentially speed up delivery to Canada and other countries, as production will likely keep producing and filling demand to other countries while they still can. It's a rush to make bank on vaccine investments before they are no longer needed.$VNQ $BPY $CIO $BXP $WPC $SPG"
I am getting nervous. Why isnt spg announcing next dividend?
Analysts covering Simon Property Group $SPG expect 14.9% EPS growth  next year: https://simplywall.st/NYSE:SPG/simon-property-group
157.50 is 1 year high. Now sits 60% below that. Markets hitting new highs. Dont live ur life in hope. Cut ur losses.
Feels good to be right.
SPG went up 3 straight days after their release
"We are in the midst of a major bull market wait till summer, covid subdued, continued government stimulus retail will do well. By August this stock will reach $145 easily."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/a-scary-number-of-retail-companies-are-facing-bankruptcy-amid-the-coronavirus-pandemic-180604964.html
Drop this one until first week of Feb. That's when it took off on a 6 month tear in '15. Dead money until then.
"''Brooks Brothers Group Inc. received a bid backed by Authentic Brands Group LLC, the owner of Barneys New York, and mall owner Simon Property Group Inc. to buy the bankrupt men’s clothing chain and keep it in business.'' They offer a lowball price for Brook Brothers, but who else can offer money in this time?"
"Bought at 86.5. Dont know if I should hold, i’m long on this one but dont want to loose everything. Thoughts ?"
"I recommended 3 stocks two weeks ago to protect your money....ALL 3 are up 8-15%....#AUY, #NEM and #WPM. Don't be hoodwinked by Simon...they're dumping to retail investors...they actually see massive number of tenants not paying rents. Protect your Family wealth."
Bout time!
At a Simon mall right now. Packed!
They will buy others malls for free
Simon Property is up 8.62% to 75.10
Malls are packed for labor day weekend!!!
Another 500 at $59.78
Falls a lot faster than it recovers- disappointing
double down 30% easy till election day.
Zero reason to accumulate here as shopping season ends in 1.5 weeks and a hard winter ahead dont be a muppet buy at 75 or leas
There will be no lockdowns under biden in late January get real. Covid will all of a sudden disapear from media discussion so biden agenda moves forward
David Simon is a genius. Paid $600 mill less for $20 mill in legal expenses. SPG is off to the races!
Gap up squeeze tomorrow as dividend chasers get in now that it’s safe.
I am in Las Vegas. Two premium outlet mall are 65% less traffics than previous years. I am selling mine tomorrow. It is unbelievable that this one reaches $85
tubman jcp store volume gunna make this take off with eps next 2 quarters
"SPG will hit 63 watch carefully if it falls under 63 then next buying point will be 60 keep for a week and sell at 70, 15% profit easy."
Any chance the deal goes through ? If so does SPG go up ?
"This stock SPG is way below value. Vaccine is coming out soon. And it will skyrocket. This is only part one of skyrocket. For fools like Joe, hope Joe can wipe his butt with those puts he bought on SPG."
130 to 140 is perfect profit...should go back to 125 soon
Got off @ 63.42 Nice rebound GLTYA
Amazon is currently in talk of a buyout of SPG.
"Vaccine is coming, thing will get back to normal hopefully soon! This is a company that did make some profit even when mall were closed!"
"Isn't their strategy to invest in top tier Malls, while maintaining strong financial position to add to their portfolio at reasonable valuations? Sounds like a recipe for a very bright future as we rise out of this once in a century pandemic and return to the social activities that we so miss including strolling in crowds at indoor and outdoor malls. Stay safe and GLTA!"
Doomed.
"For all you people that have been losing money past 6 months....go look at #AUY and #NEM.....they're going to be future dividend payers. Silver up $1.00 today with EU adding almost Trillion in stimulus program last night. An example is Newmont has 850 million ounces of silver in reserves....at $21/ounce that works out to be almost $17 billion. And they're a gold miner, silver just a by-product. Same with #AUY - 11 million ounces of silver mined per year as a by-product, with gold as their mainstay. Property REIT buyers are usually pretty level headed.....you must see that all this multi-trillion money creation is just insane....debt and deficits are going parabolic. Just can not be sustainable.....protect yourself from inflation folks.....future is not looking pretty for the US Dollar."
Shopping MallsThey will bounce back according to comments Trump has made. He feels most people like to see in person what they are purchasing. As a merchant he sure gets our vote
Bought in today. This is such an undervalued stock.
someone is juicing the numbers today or the market things TCO has been gotten for nothing.
"Simon Malls is going down like the Titanic.The dividend will be cut to zero. All the best, Brad."

make spg great again!
no point of catching this falling knife now.
Look for that break above $103.50 now. Should have a quick run back to $150. Now own TCO for $800 mill less and pandemic in our rear view. Just got my first shot
137 already...100 by May
My guess is Barney didn't sell at 960 or better and take advantage of the spike.
I was before thinking should I buy AAPL or SPG.. hmm... regrets..
Bring me some cheap am stock.....
will close today below 130 due to a terrible report
They plan on paying out at least $6.00 in 2020. Let's see - at $100 that's at least 6% and at least 5% at $120. Just five malls still unopened. NY is saying malls need HEPA filtration system to open. Not sure how hard that is to implement for an entire mall or if the last few matter much at this particular juncture.
Rotation....finally out of big tech. Enjoy the ride

"Forecast of $9/eps, at a 20 p/e that’s $180 price target.. with my math $180 seems to be higher than $99"
"Anyone have thoughts about when we might hear more news about an Amazon partnership? Joe said that David Simon said there would be no deal, but I listened to the earnings call and reading between the lines I think he said exactly the opposite. The analyst who asked was just sheepish and got an appropriately coy answer in return."
Only Barney knows.
"amzn goods are overpriced period! my motto, shop amzn buy elsewhere. suckers/millenials pay a huge markup for 'convenience'"

Where is @Joe at?
SPG is the stock. What is SPG-PJ? Is it callable and at what price?
ui ui ui
Best Buy bad report today. Macys and Target are rushing to be 'online' before Christmas.Malls are in secular decline. One can only hope the Simons live long enough to watch their family fortune (built on debt) get vaporized.
"The BOTTOM is 50% lower from here. Do Not listen to pumpers.....go to the malls, talk to the remaining salesperson....look at boarded up anchor stores....walk by every 10th establishment closed down....OPEN YOUR EYES!!....No-one protecting you here except yourself and ONE computer click to sdll....you can ALWAYS buy back if things get better. You can't recover losses!!!"
Green into panic
@Joe is sooo quiet
Most undervalued stock on planet

"Anyone grab those double digit gains in #WPM, #AUY, and #NEM I mentioned past few weeks?.....#WPM will be the 2021 dividend king being bankers to the miners....they also own about 20 million shares of First Majestic, #AG, but stay away from that....all their profit goes to #WPM anyways....most undervalued, best run Royalty Streaming company with only 39 employees."
If this drops to 50 im IN IT
"Good luck to all, although today's action lets me know we wont need luck. I NEVER listen when doubters try to get me to sell my stock and neither should you!!!!"
"They are basically buying growth, effectively. At a good price, too."
this is incredible. This year alone I've collected 1600 in Dividends and getting ready to go for 555 more. Actually instead of getting 4.7% I'm really getting 20% because everytime SPG goes down I double down and sell the extra shares when it goes back up. This retail scare is giving Simon stock fits making it go down quite a bit.
"If you don't buy now, you will be sorry"
"We rate SPG as a 'Strong Sell'. Their Subprime malls will be closing in 2020 due to tenant bankruptcies.Invest in technology instead. All the best, Brad."
very strange stock for this one. I have to congratulation long. I entered several times around $62 and got out around $70s....Still not sure why this one is up like crazy? it is just a landlord who collect rent from retailer tenants....Maybe I just not know about this business models...
"L-Brands cutting 850 jobs, closing stores and negotiating ""Rent Relief"" with Landlords. Tuesday after market close."
I guess I didn't hear the full earnings call. Did they not announce the 2021 dividend? Or do they do this at a later date?
Big news is coming and ready to fly. Hope you all are on the board.
MAC outperforms SPG consistently
Down $15 from Tuesday's pre-opening price.

Look for a close above $73
"Do shorts smile or laugh or just have good time? No way you can be a permanent short without being always negative and seeing doom everywhere.According the shorts, the life we knew pre-pandemic )just 4 months ago) is forever gone. Nobody is going out to have fun or shop anymore, Real estate are worthless because nobody will be able to pay rent or profit from a business anymore. The fun life is over for everyone and we are all going to be miserable like the shorts are...I can understand buying a put for an obvious overvaluation but hoping for misery just to make a couple buck cannot be healthy..."
still hot 2 nov 20 85 call options let's gooooooooo
Lots of small buys today. Seems odd that we finally get an upgrade on the day that people would be reinvesting the divi (if they don't drip). Let's hope it holds.
malls in gilroy santa Clara are packed. just wait the malls are gunna crush numbers and be back to a cash machine.
I will hold and buy more. I would not sell these golden properties at $225 per square foot. Maybe $500 per square foot. Short term doesnt matter. This thing is cheaper than it was in 2008. They have more properties and more earnings.
What happened today?
"If there was ever, ever a time to cut the dividend, it would start with this Quarter and you could not even blame Simon for doing it."
"Guys, I have a question on balance sheet. Q4 of 2019 the Current Assets was 1,994,106. Q1 of this year the Current Assets is 4,518,343. What happened? Thx"

"When the dividend is going to cut, this is going to drop hard. They can't afford dividend at all. The debt n dividend are two biggest issues for now."
"Oh....all the hate i have taken from the pumpers since the high $60's...low $70's......sold 50% of my puts, riding the other 50% risk free. Mall operators are under duress and will continue to be under DURESS for all 2021. gl"

"Gymboree closing 900 stores. Let me guess, that has zero impact on the Simons >?"

"1.75 dividend payable on May 31st,, Nice !!!"
People are going to malls and packed. Everything will reopen. Plus other retailers such ask IKEA will come in on the open space.
"Hi Joe, how much puts you still have on SPG? laugh out loud"
Based upon Taubmens price history recently it doesn't appear that investors are very confident that SPG is going to move forward with their acquisition or atleast not without a major price adjustment. Either way would be fantastic for SPG. Personally I would prefer them to completely back out and eat the 220 million charge and acquire Macerich or Tanger at a much reduced cost.
Vaccines are a plenty down here in Florida. Anyone who wants the vaccine will be able to get it in the next 30-60 days. We’ll be back to the new norm by summer.
SPG exceeded my expectation today and I am happy I still hold my position strong.Hit 60 tomorrow?What say you?
SKT buyout rumors
Nice new base formed in the mid $72’s and now the new run upward...
"What a load of shhh it. I dumped at the open, I'll get back in at $59."
So what's ailing SPG ?
Took my profits today and will be back after record date . Folks will move money elsewhere after they collect and the stock should drop several bucks . 1.30 isnt worth holding thru the div when you could rebuy alot cheaper than 1.30
I'm wondering if the announcement of the vax approval with make this pop a decent amount

@Joe - Great news 
Outstanding report considering what has happened and many are still fearful. We move higher once we shake out the weak hands. Two months $80 plus.
"I got a $20,000 dividend "
Had to buy some more. Couldn’t resist. The lower the stock the higher the dividend. Works no matter what
Coronavirus just speeding up the inevitable. Any bull runs should be shorted.
Has simon collected rent from the freeloading Gap Inc?
Most companies nowadays can skirt any SEC rules and regulations by adjusted earnings vs GAAP earnings....the few that can't are ones who pay out dividends.....That REAL money has to come from somewhere!!

"Unemployment $$billions just went Poof!....Executive Order, if even legal cuts about 37% from current level even if it gets through. $1-$3.5 trillion in New relief gone. Malls seeing 35% less in overall store revenues now will see even less. Many more Retailers will file for bankruptcy just to get out of unprofitable locations and leases. Plus, the ones they want to keep they will renegotiate lower rents. There is no other stores waiting in line for any space whatsoever.....there's this huge glut and now massive cuts to Unemployment benefits.....Earnings won't be pretty, but pay attention to guidance....there won't really be any as it would be foolish of them to predict bankruptcies, Unemployment, coronovirus and general economy in today's environment. gl"
Small dividend cut and this thing flies
David made an interesting comment during the call that many of the retailers stock prices are now way above prepandemic prices yet SPG is still below. Buy the dips...going way higher!
Still half the price of Pre Covid! This thing is gonna run. Hop on board. Still not to late.
Get in at 50 a good idea?
killing the shorts!
At what level will there be buyer exhaustion ?
Vaccine by December. $125 by 1/1/2021

Why after three decent Q's and the Dividend X date right around the corner is Simon stock going down?
You know they are not going to pay that dividend
"guess old Barnacle Barney will have to wait for his Simon Short to go lower. It closed at almost 170 today. Be careful Barney, Simon might have Something up his sleeve, We shall find out next month."

malls will never die people like going out. On to real info... if this JCP deal goes through SPG and the other company will instantly profit 162% on stright value. If properly managed this could catapult them to new profit levels.

"Don't you just love it Barney? The stock is selling at 160 and Dividend on the way. You made a bid mistake not buying at 154 6 days ago, a huge mistake."
Try looking at the last 10k and look at the Simon properties in your area. In the Charlotte NC area there are two and they are choice. Anyone have a opinion on Simon properties in there areas?
Got the whole board to myself today 
This will be $500 next year
So Im thinking they priced the offering a little low to entice the debtors that they will collect instant Arbitrage... 6% of this stock at 72$ bucks wont have much of an effect... also It wont have an effect.... if you offer 6% new stock but as soon as it lands it's already sold... that shouldn't affect price.

"I smell a conspiracy theory a brewing right now. All of a sudden the REITS drop 10% in a week or two on the idea that rates may rise soon. News flash, this concept has been going on for years now. They short the REITs knowing well that the jobs numbers will be bad (since they are reporting them that way, which then takes the pressure off the Fed to raise rates this year. They allow them selves time to get through the election mess and for their efforts, they received short shares of all the large REIT firms for their service. They walk the REITS back up to where they were, make their money and don't have to worry for another month now. Just like what y allegedly did. She approved State grants for people in a foreign firm (which is out tax money people) and in return for the grants, this foreign company all of a sudden appoints her a board seat which by the way pays her six figures. So basically she is stealing out tax money in a round about way. At least that's what is being reported on TV"
Earnings and FFO beat? Didn't compare the numbers yet.
bought back
"OK, even you guys (and girl) have to admit....that was one ugly last hour of trading!"
Few minutes ago a selling of 4 million shares in a short time.. is that a bug or that actually happened?
"I can't believe this is going bankrupt. I just looked at the form 4 filings , the last few days management has bought millions of dollars worth of stock"
Pump and Dump.... The Flush begins will be Red in the next hour...
"What do you guys think about SPG-TCO merger? Simon agreed to pay too much for TCO. Had Simon waited just a month, they’d have got TCO for $15/share rather than $52.5/share they agreed to pay.Can Simon walk out of the merger or negotiate a better deal?"
I would love to finish the week holding around $125. Needs to slow this pace so profit taking doesn't get too dramatic. IMO
$24 BILLION is a lot of debt. The real irony will be turning malls into Goodwill stores and recycling dumps. Higher and better use !
Stop kidding yourselves. This was my favorite stock and I still believe it is a long term winner. However there is no reason to hold this now with the corona virus and lock downs. Im you can make money with 5g and stay at home stocks and come back to spg later. This stock is not going up anytime soon.
80-100 stock in a 55 dollar body.
My bad...volume still weak. Check back at 10:30 and multiply  3......let's see :-)
"SPG *will* honor its deal with TCO. The argument of “not doing enough like peers” will not have any weight in court. TCO will tell the judge in a sarcastic tone that they compete with their peers and don’t copy their peers....and frankly, there isn’t a playbook on how to be “responsible like your peers during a pandemic” available. Buy TCO and wait for your 52 dollars a share payment to arrive. Spg lawyers had to go through some Olympic level gymnastics to come up with that argument."
$ are pouring in reit. Accumulate & hold!
And Flush.......
"Job consensus for next week were expected to be 2 million....NatWest economist now looking like maybe 200,000. Grant Thorton economist said it could even be flat to negative......guess that will drive foot traffic, but not sales."
WOOOAHHH!! KILLED IT TODAY!!!! $30k on SPG (~1980 shares) in the bank.. SOLD! I'm GOOD!
So anyone knows when SPG and AMZN will likely make the deal mentioned previously?
The share price is like yo-yo now
Mall are cesspools/Stationary Cruise ships/GET OUT OF EVERYTHING MALL
Long and strong! The divy will remain at 50% or more!
"Seaweed Barney, bless his little heart, isn't it nice to be always right! You wonder what he did wrong to lose his job at Simon Properties? His hate is disgusting."
SPG-PJ reached a new 52 Week Low at 66.50
pain is pleasure
"The CEO said ""Many companies are reducing their dividends by 50-100%, we will not be one of those companies"". If you believe that.... the max cut would be less than 50%. That would still be at least an 8-9% dividend at this level. Hopefully he is right."
"Retail has changed a lot since the financial crisis, but it is exciting to look at the ""potential"" returns based on the charting post-crisis. Additionally, if dividend is cut less than 50%, which Simon hinted at, the last time a dividend was around 1.25+ was 2013 with a share price over 100 dollars. What I find interesting is that during the financial crisis when valuation was also this low there was a dividend paid mostly in stock and less than 1 dollar! We are paying for a company with a solid balance sheet and probably about a 10% dividend yield after the cut. Easy decision for at LEAST a short to mid term play."
Why are all the large Reits dropping so quickly? It's not like people didn't know rates were going to be going up at some point. What does an increase of a 1/4 point have to do with SPG dropping 5% today and almost 15% in the last three months?/
This was or is the pull back get ready 4 + 75 in the coming weeks
Simple Simon keeps borrowing billions to build out more square footage for malls with less and less foot traffic. It won't end well.
LETS GOOO!!
T
Waiting for SPG to drop to 50 USD - 55 USD.. I don't know if it will ever hit..
If this is beginning of a big decline then what do you think will happen to AMZN. Barney?
"David Simon makes $3.7 MILLION every year from this indebted retail mall stupidity. As an Amazon shareholder, I laugh at how your shareholders are being duped."
"Elephant in the room is A/R. Creative reporting as to what actual rent collections are. Huge AR balances with Gap,etc that realistically may never be 100% recoverable. I'm bullish on the RE and DS is one of the smartest guys around but I'm not sure potential uncollectible rent is being properly priced in by the market."
"I visited a Simon Mall last week. Locked and completely dark inside. Homeless rummaging in the garbage cans out front. A big For Lease sign offering 48,000 square feet.This didn't look like ""great"" real estate to me. I think I'll pass. All the best, Brad"
At no time this will be $250
"Here is a picture of the future of mall REITs .... they will become ghost towns.Amazon is killing these, SELL - Simon Properties (SPG), Taubman Centers (TCO), and General Growth (GGP), CBL Properties (CBL) https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-walmarts-latest-moves-confirm-203539327.html"

Will be fine for a few weeks then it will get crushed when the inevitable second wave of infections hit.
"I still don't think SPG can handle the MALLS downside. It's full of debt. Won't be able to survive with so much dividend. I am buyer at 20-30 range. No position. They got 2 headwinds, 1. Moving to internet, and 2. Covid related piling losses."
All you bears getting burned! Going way higher
This should’ve closed above $53. Little disappointing performance late session.
"SPG I buy everything because they know covid19 is not forever, long terms in this , good divends in the future"
nice
"wow , im a bag holder for now... Need patience"
"Barney, did you short AMZN at 962 ? Then you could buy it back now."
118-119 today - will sell 1000
"Dang it. I had a $76 limit buy and it just didn't quite get there. I suspect it won't in the next few weeks but it will be sitting there just in case. No time to sell friends, only buy."
"buzz said to come over to Ocugen, it should be going up tomorrow. like NOVAVAX did"
Good luck to longs today even if it’s a miss (I hope not) we guidance which should point to good growth in the 2nd quarter onwards
Stock is just fools gold - it never holds any gains. If you are buying the stock based on vaccine news I think you need to reaccess how you value a company. Stocks like MAR BKNG EXPE LYV will be fine once Covid passes and that is why they have recovered. The difference is SPG's challenges will not dissappear when Covid passes.
#nov20 80 and 85 call options
Wait for the dividend hike. Then we really fly!
"Maybe you can book Arsenio Hall as entertainment in your malls ? We heard he is making a big come back, just like retail pedestrian malls ?"
33% drop in FFO. Better than MAC’s drop of 53%.
Everyone keep in mind that at todays prices investors are not buying based on actual earnings and revenues. They are investing based upon what they project 6 months to a year from now. Makes short term trading dangerous as you may earn more holding through end of year. That is why stock prices are no where near reflective of a companies actual earnings report
Massacre Monday!!!.....when Property REITS crashed and left retail investors holding the bag.
SPG-PJ reached a 52 Week high at 75.40
This is still great company for long-term investors but there will be a lot of volatility over next month or so as SPG determines whether to continue with buyout of TCO versus pulling out of deal/renegotiating terms while also evaluating which retailers are going BK and whom to replace them with. SPG has the highest quality malls and will get any empty spaces filled wit more modern retailers boosting their long term outlook.
Can't fake rents that are overdue or that are subject to Bankruptcy Courts!!!!
bails out bankrupt companies but who is going to bail them out...trash
purchased more shares... price is really good right now!
"if congress appoves a bill the stock (SPG) rises, if not it lowers and we have another great opportunity to add to our port. It's a ....,"
malls are a hard business but SPG knows the game expansion and convertion. #spac will be growth.
"I mentioned my 3 favorite stocks (see earlier post here(...#AUY, #WPM, #NEM.......all hitting 52 week or all time highs. Be smart....you see $trillions being wasted. $26 trillion in national debt.....protect your legacy."
TCO is toast and SPG got really lucky
Down 15% in 10 trading days. Funds unloading to Retail.
The minute details will kill you in a contract if one is foolish or lazy
spg got a discount on taubman just when things are on the cusp of reopening ....vaccine soon to be distributed -by spring things should be looking really good .....spg played this just right ....good to be an investor ...
Keep buying cheap stock! Enjoy the ride!

"Wpg going bk. Preit went bk, cbl bk.spg? We made money during covid, how can the market ignore us any longer?"
So undervalued. The bears are going to wake up not too far in the future and have to really question themselves.
How we feeling about earnings next week people? We thinking we might see another boost in SP like last earnings? I doubt we will but thoughts would be appreciated
SPG reached a 52 Week low at 130.57

"Thus far i haven't sold any of my holdings, but this company is beginning to #$%$ me off."
Bought more at $95
Whoever called this company a sinkhole on this message board is absolutely right.
This will be $100 in no time
I warned u to go long and ignore the incessant fud at capitulation levels. Spg will have online exposure now thru jcp
'Joe' is obviously a paid basher - claimed he owned no SPG stock and was unbiased - yet he posts hourly an unending stream of hyper-negative talking points bashing all things SPG.Undoubtedly on commission by Shorters and paid by the # of posts and # of responses naming him by other posters!Everyone should MUTE the #@×# !!!
what's the ex dividend date? I can't remember when bought it but had it at least month half maybe 2
SPG reached a new 52 Week High at 181.29
ohhhh close to 52 week low
Def a hold but if you want quick profits I’d go elsewhere
The brains always say that the market looks at least 6 months out. Vaccines will start to be administered this year under the FDA's emergency approval. They will approve others under emergency approvals as well.
50% volume....just fyi.
woah talk about volume and volatility. what's happening? 
Good Day Boys. Good Day
$100 by end of the week. Vaccine rolling out
@Joe I knew you had puts and they going red tmp.gif
"sure amzn interested but they are opportunist ...i would think spg rather wait for vaccine and recovery before accepting any lowball agreement with amzn. we will see if they can come to terms. in any case, holding the stock. it is a bit of a gamble, ...but i think it is one worth taking ..glta"
"Looks like we bottomed, up up and away now"
I warned u top in
FDA has officially approved remdesivir. People’s fear of going out will disappear. Watch for the recovery.
"My team owns Amazon and has for some time. Maybe Piggly Wiggly will save the Simons ? Oh wait, AMZN just became a high quality grocer. Too bad for the Simons. Walton boy just dumped some of his Wal-Mart holding. What does that tell you retail mall dolts ?"
Everyone was selling this on the heals of the next rate hike. Am I missing something here. We care even closer to the Dec rate hike and we are driving upwards again with good momentum. You don't think some MM were pulling our leg to steal some low $$ shares a few weeks now do you? That wouldn't be legal. This market is all F'd up just like out government and the world for that matter
All these fools calling short yet don't Put any money on it
"Bed, Bath, and Behind plunges to 5 year lows. Just another struggling mall rat."
Sell off this week
CA Spg malls packed this weekend
is spg fundamentals still strong
Better to take profits from this week. Great stock.
Welp. I guess patience pays off :) Congrats to you all for a lovely couple of days here!
YOU DO KNOW THAT AT THE CURRENT PPS WE HAVE GREAT UPSIDE TIME TO GET GREEDY IMO. VALUE LINE HAS A 3-5YR PPS TARGET OF220-300! SO EVEN ON THE LOW END THAT IS A GREAT RETURN!!
litigation on cancelled deal and Covid wave 2. Not good. Going back to the 50's.
"These Simon Malls are ghost towns. Nobody in the place. The reason is that they don't sell toilet paper.I think bankruptcy is coming for Simon real soon. All the best, Brad."
"What should we do here, i bought 700 shares at 89. should i sell ? its all my savings"
look at other mall reits like Macerich... great potential and gap to fill
SPG was the only REIT to have actual profits when the world was shut down between March 2020 to June 2020. not worried at all.
Any news from the JCP sale hearing today?
"Maybe ""Dirty Lemon"" will be the dream tenant to support the Simon $22 BILLION debt load ?"
What is the reason this is up? I'm finally in GREEN again....!
Finishing above $70 today. $100 in sight
"I'm a senior citizen, but I'm not new to Market....bought #ACB yesterday and up over 80%....yes....80% in less than 24 hours....you can check my post from yesterday where I bought.....gl."
"I listen to basher and short from time to time, they're right. At SPG we're talking about a company with a value of 20 billion in the best of times 60-80 billion. This is not a cannabis fries shop that just burns money or dilutes it like ACB. Perhaps it is a good idea to collect cheap companies could pay off for the future. I am not worried about long-term at SPG."
we are going to break 52 week high today
Bought for 57... now the question do I hold and enjoy the div or do I sell?
"Trump is right. Amazon is milking the State and Local governments out of taxes and causing job losses and using our Post Office to be it's delivery boy. By doing that Amazon don't have to pay the benefits, just let the Federal government do that. Wow Bezos figured out a way to flim flam all the states and local governments getting their business tax free. Not get this along comes Trump and the GOP and they LOWER the taxes for Amazon's profits to make sure they scr#w everybody."
Just went to premium mall in Chicago and could not find a parking spot for 15minutes. Most of the stores had a line to go in with distancing restrictions.
"I don’t know why I’m going to write it’s obvious a lot of people here are bias. I would never hold a stock with a chart like this , looks like at&t monthly take A look"
Fat joe why is this keep going up ? When will I see $50
"SELL AT THE OPEN and then ride the downward current in a river tube. If LULU is pressured - the TOP best managed performing retailer is crushed by retail store closings and foot traffic, what does this say about other retailers who can't get their act together and are SPG tenants? The market has given you a chance to get out - take it!! You can get back like a salmon swimming upstream in the low 60s"
Buy buy and buy more before it’s to late
"Rarely does someone blow a dog whistle to announce the shifting of a tectonic plate. They kept building canals in the US well into the 19th century, even though railroads had overtaken them and made the canals basically useless. Simon is still packing a debt load of over $23 Billion.Amazon sales this week have been stronger than any analyst forecast.I might have a team of mules sent to The Simons as a holiday gesture."
Spg up $1 in premarket.
Great results Joe the shorter is crying stock up 30% lol 
Last time this thing hit $35 (great recession)...lets's see how close to that it gets this time...

"JCP wants to come out of chapter 11 bankruptcy by December, in time for the holiday season, deal should be done with Simon in early November"
Getting crushed today.
Had to sell 1000 at $114. 3k left to run
"You dividend players out there...go look at #BASFY, #BBL, #MO.....things like that....this is dead money going forward."
"Asked my millenials about them taking online purchases back to the mall....were all the stores open? No. Was the mall busy (foot traffic)...Yes. Did you buy anything after you returned your online purchases to the stores?....No, not really. I suggest potential investors look at specific retailer earnings....this will positively show you their ability to pay rent to Simon. Research how much consumer buying power has been decimated with $600/week loss of income by 30 million consumers. Use your brain here, go to Mall, look at physical store retail numbers. There's nothing positive here until new stimulus is enacted (not happening b4 election) or Government just starts dropping money from helicopters. gl"
Looking to break $94.36
Ok this earnings report was good and folks going to the malls will only get better. Real-estate has always been a good investment over time. It is hard to comment or make positive comments since there are those who are just negative and are either shorting this stock or are buying puts. So I am a long term holder and I bet anyone that this stock will be back around $150 by the end of this year.
Terminating the deal is going to be costly in court as I would expect it to drag out. I personally expect that SPG is doing this to gain leverage to renegotiate the terms as Taubman currently cant really afford to fight this out in court. I would expect e negotiated deal for sale with price per share being reduced to $38-$42 dollars
Keep buying while insiders unload. There is another shoe to drop . Going below 50 within the next few weeks
"Here is one more fact then, how about the 7% CAGR growth? Can anyone answer that?"
buy order set at 32$ for quick bounce
Got in late at $99 and adding on the way up. Better late than not at all...as others have already mentioned this has a ways to go and could reach $150 or even higher.
"Little birdie told me I was missed on #SPG board.....as stated previously, I have absolutely no positions in #SPG. I have followed commercial and residential real estate since 2006. My belief is, we still haven't seen the bottom. Google Ikea buys L.A. mall. You'll see Ikea has idea to fill up empty anchor stores with its Ikea stores. Here's the rub....Ikea has a ""International Mall subsidiary"" that puts it into direct competition with current mall owners, not as a tenant, but as a owner and anchor of the malls. Ikea is not a JCPENNY or Macy's that were having problems before the pandemic, but is a destination type store before and after the Pandemic. Just my 2 cents, Ikea malls coming to a neighborhood near you to compete with established, yet newly anchorless malls. btw, not a fan of Ikea, they sell junk furniture and accessories. I believe in buying quality furniture the first time, not multiple throw it away type items after they quickly fail."
Went to a Simon owned mall here in Missouri and it was busy today. 90% occupancy too. I’ll check Camarillo Outlets in CA Sunday when I fly back. They have been busy too
What has Simone done so far? It appears they have bought more shares recently and lowered their interest rate on billions of dollars. Its amazing that so far all are so bearish right before the next ER and up to now SPG has not had a bad ER.
people wanna get out of the house ..they have been couped up .... once a vaccine is available and proven safe it will be like a big party ....with overflowing traffic at the premier malls ....watch ...
"Joe, what are you going to do with your dividend money? Oh wait, you won’t get any..."
Santa Claus is coming to your town retail mall ! Coal black eye lumps from SEARS !
$18 million spent on Taubman lawsuit so far.
Wake me up when SPG breaks above 150.
Dividend will go up to $20 a shares
Just got my 1000 cheap. Good for at least 2 pts today
"I really want to buy more, but I have a feeling we’re in for a bad ER..."
Keep an eye on breaking $122...
SPG will try to get over 167 before the close.
No 1900 !
Watch for a close above $90
"Sell SPG and buy SHOP ! SPG is in a dying business. All the best, Brad"
From what the States trying to do will cause AMZN to go down. Now they will have to collect sales tax for all the states and open distribution centers in most of the states. Now good news for AMZN that Barnacle is in love with.
premarket was manipulated... no reason for a drop of 13-15%... following the breakup news.
Going to take out $122 this week
I'm still waiting for
TEN PERCENT LOSS in 5 trading days is not a buy and hold dividend play....retail buyers beware.
May want to fill empty box stores with self service storage companies such as Iron Mountain or Cube.Another idea is that malls that have theaters as tenants use Movie Pass as a promotion to increase mall traffic and have all the tenants participate in the cost in exchange for some benefit as well.
Buying more at the open. Emotions always lose in this game.
"I went to see how their outlets in Camarillo, CA this passed weekend were doing and let me tell you the place was packed all parking lots were full. Crazy to pass up on these cheap shares."
"Legit question: as they were once almost $230, is this a good price to buy right now?"
Best short in the stock market right now. This thing heading to $60s.
"US Ten Year Treasury yield falls way back to 2.97%, and the simple Simons think they have a ticker to paradise. Harder times will come to your malls."
"No-one ever post any news making events here. JCPENNY announced yesterday after the close that they were closing an additional 144 stores than planned in bankruptcy. And bankruptcy is stuck in limbo as some creditors are fighting the sale. Meanwhile some vendors are not supplying goods that may never be paid for. For Simon to team up with Brookfield (just for the stores, no distribution centers) was either a desperate act or a strategic one. If just Simon or Brookfield bought them, they could have selectively shut down JCPENNY stores in just the competitors malls. Should all be exciting to watch as Christmas gets closer and closer. Also, big question....144 more stores closing, does that make the buyout smaller?.....Have to remember that's 144 malls.....maybe they're outside of Simon and Brookfield malls, which would then be good for them short term, but long term they're still buying a dying brand that they'll be stuck with forever.......unless they do the Amazon thing....lol....just kidding.....that was all hype and hope and dreams. just some food for thought.....oh, and watch out for GOP Senators.....only 8-12 that would vote for stimulus in $1.8 trillion area......they need 60 total, so at 12 GOP & 47 Dems, you're still only at 59.....may you live in interesting times."
@Joe - Please help!! Ever since we’ve met online & I bought more (against your wishes of course) my shares have gone up. Can you give us some more guidance? Must be retail buyers only hey... 
"Hello all Barneys , AMZN down 52 a share now."
strong break out
Offering was at $72.50. Why isn't the stock tanking?
consolidation for lift off
Board needs to listen ....I’m helpIng everyone. Don’t sell! Buy the dips. Lock in at least $100 by end of year
Another 500 at $68
Why is this still dropping?
ha ha ha lets see 145
Vaccines and therapies will continue to roll out. Watch this baby fly with each announcement.
Steve Eisman of The Big Short fame gave very in depth interview yesterday on Fast Money. The only thing in this market that he thinks is a short is the Mall Reits and mentioned SPG by name. I have no interest in this stock but thought I would help out.
Still way below precovid and now own TCO for $800 mill less . What a coup!
"spg is already bankruptJose, I've not read anything like this? Where do you get your misinformation?"
Data just released from early trials show the antiviral drug remdesivir having success in curing patients
"Simon has been working on mixed use project development for many of their malls for over 2 years. I believe Amazon will buy SPG and partner to build HiTech Mixed use developments called Amazones. They will allow amazon points to be used for shopping,dining healthcare dry cleaning grocery store etc. this enables both brands spg and Amzn to evolve into a lifestyle brand vs transactional brand. SPG will then become true destinations again vs neighborhood amenity they are turning into. Amzn can use its platform to drive people to these Amazones. That’s the bottom line. Just Distribution centers don’t cut it."
Bought 500 @ 54.80. Wish me luck. LOL
Will buy tco under 1 billion
Amazon $1272 per share. Remember the good ol' days when Simon was $225 and Amazon was $745 ?That was July 2016.
So easy here. Support at $96. Buy the dips!
They have to much cash to powerful
Who loaned $23 BILLION dollars to these retail brick and mortar peddlers ?
"Just checked my crystal ball and SPG will break $100 after earnings, hurry up and jump on the money train!!!"
waiting for 135
"All medias is downplaying vaccine news, and the funny thing is, FDA is in favor of approving vaccine, BUT NEVER APPROVE IT yet. This feel like market manipulation to the max, hold on to the stock Longs, it won't be long for the stock to take off again."
How this is not up more is nuts
When are they going to announce divs? I read by end of June. That is in a week.
I like the recent management decision to withdraw from the Taubman deal. They need to be inline with management thinking. I know it was a hard decision. GL SPG!
"Well, Barney, sold most of my SPG as it rallied from 148 to 167 a 17 point gain plus dividendsGood thing I didn't listen to you I would not have made any money in SPG"
why the mid morning turn around?
What news do we have on the Dividend??
This REIT will cut dividend 50% each quarter going forward....Retail Apocalypse!!!
I dont get the fear of buying this. Akin to buying apple at lows
Spark power group? What
"It's actually 20,000,000 shares after additional allotment."
Will hit 70s tomorrow
"Hey Barney, AMZN down $21 Is it a buy here or do we wait until it goes down another $80/share"
Coldwater Creek (owned by Sycamore funds) closes down completely.
"We have seen for quite a while that certain stores were near defaulting. I think SPG has planned for this and will dip a bit more, but return quickly. My two cents."
The day traders are all over this stock it seems. Yo-yo
The strongest property owner in North America!!
"$125-$150 eoy unless Covid roars. Otherwise, get long!"
very impressive CC. So outlook looks excellent
How many retailers will this REIT own before all these bankruptcies are over with?....then they want to partner with hangman (Amazon)....too hilarious.
People chasing retail reits like momo stocks equals automatic sell to me means the muppets r here $spg $mac
How you guys know spg can maintain dividend? Things arent looking good
Average 10:30 daily volume.....no real upside here for next 30 days.
They will buyout companies for cheap
"OH my.......What was once sold as a ""safe, dividend property stock"" is now a ""buyer of failed retailing"" stock.....this IS NOT MY DAD'S investment!!!!......this is now a retail play....not a property play."
I made calculations.. there is 1 reits that got 40% of the rent in Q2 2020 and lost over 30% of the value. I think I will sell SPG if it hits 63.00+. What are your guys thoughts?
Several analyst are keeping the stock price down on Simon Property and they do not disclose their short positions. I believe they have shorted this and they justify their stock rating by saying brick and mortar stores are going away or have lost their value. I work with a lot of people who are looking forward to getting out and I know a few businesses that want to set up shop in malls. And Simon Properties is redesigning their malls to be more consumer oriented. I am looking forward to their report February 8.
Oh my.....watch and learn how institutions rob retail shareholders.
Hi Chad and Barnacle. How do you like what Simon stock is doing? Look at all the lawsuits piling up and the fumes on leases written years ago.
lets gooo spg up today! i have a good feeling
Joe's option does count till he sells short or sells put over 10k... big mouth no money
Love the cheap stock!
"I just want to give my two cents. In Korea we had the e commerce boom back in early as 2006. Please note that we had the guiness of record breaking internet users in Korea for almost decade in the past. And yes of course, we had this conversation about if most of the physical stores are going to close down because of rise of e commerce. Well 15 years later, this is what has happened so far. The malls did not closed down and they were resilient. You go to China and take a look for yourself. The most advanced e commerce country in the world and the malls are thriving. They are not dying. They are thriving. The malls in Korea which have gone down either were manged poorly or were simply in not good location. Yeah in 1990s they were indestructible, but that was not the case anymore. However, the majority of malls thrived. They thrived because of prime location and its real estate price appreciation. Further to note, even e commerce companies started to come into the mall as well which they called ""offline stores."" Once you establish e commerce clothing companies that generate few hundred million revenue, spending 1 million dollar in rent is nothing and in fact you want to do it more for marketing purposes as it increases exposure to the public geatly hence it increasing the brand value. And you see this, Amazon trying to get into the physical location. Not just distributing centre. And I promise you guys. Amazon will eventually build its own physical stores in the malls. Some futures are not hard to see. If you think e commerce is going destroy malls and commercial properties.. You are just solely mistaken... This time is different they say... But based on my experience, human nature and its society do not change so swiftly. Wait for a year and thank me later. Is this company going bankrupt next year? Probably no... Even Howard Marks said during the interview with CNBC that retail real estates are undervalued."

"SPG SHOWING SOEM DESPERATION. Simon is saying Taubman is in the mall business and that is a bad business - so what does that say about Simon. Can he get out? Probably not since the materially adverse clause was signed after the start of the Pandemic. Sure, he can try but he just made the balance sheet shaky with legal uncertainty and that will restrain the dividend. And, yes, he is suing Gap, but they will bit be a pushover and just pay rent when the Malls will close. He will be lucky of he gets $30-35M out of the $65 and then all the other tenants will want the same treatment."
I just sold all my shares. there are a couple things concerning me. too much risk... I'll get back in if I get a good price.

So oversold. This thing should pop to $100 quickly just on its asset value.
"The Simons remind us of wheat farmers in the Texas panhandle and west Oklahoma circa 1925 to 1933. In response to lower and lower wheat prices, the farmers response ? Plow more acres, and grow more wheat. The Simons think that their tenants will continue to be there, year in, and year out, paying increasing higher rents. Guess what dolts ? YOU are the wheat farmers now."
oh happy days. I loaded up much more under 68
They are waiting to buy tco under 1 billion
Buy morons

@Joe almost time to quadruple up 
"Are you all making fun of John? Can't you see he is a very serious investor and he has a great handle that SPG will tank, don't you know?"
Have a little over a month to hit my $100 prediction
Im upset i missed the ride
For amazon to continue to grow they really do need spg
Strong week. Simon look like it could be over $100 by mid December. Nice head winds. I believe we could be ba k to pre-covid levels by July. IMHO
SPG has major malls in most every country in the world. People look at it as if its US only. Most of the malls are fully open. This is a solid stock.
pay attention to what was said on the call and go study the history. They said this downturn is like the one in the 1990's and added it took 4 years to recover. Go search the history and you will find out it took 4 years from peak to trough for CRE. Long way to go. The other major difference is we have the internet now. You have to wait and let this play out quite a bit more.
Sinking ship! This will see 50's most definitely. Still a solid company though. Buy at 55$! It will reach 55$.
Here is an exercise for someone: What is the value of the raw land that
If you all had listened to Trading Professor you would be broke.
These REIT's are last on the list for a government bailout. Please trade accordingly.
Join the party at MAC. Going to be fun next week.
MAC has higher volume that SPG this morning. Going to explode to the upside.
haha garbage
Instead of Barney and Chad buying SPG at 151.3 they spout off how bad if is owning Simon stock. up 3.71 dollars a share or 371 dollars for 100 shares. Now maybe 371 dollars is not much to Barney or Chad ZERO but I think it is.
Well I got to smile for one hour now reality has set in.
"Shorts are still in control... This is a short pattern forming every day. Same for the retail stocks, we're not out of the woods. So most likely it will close around 68. Green is not for today sadly."
npd. no matter what you say i'm making lots of money on SPG. Have you ever heard of hedging?
Don't get me wrong high debt and some bankruptcies are of concern however CO vid I don't believe is that big of a contributing factor at this point going forward
SPG is up 12.72% to 70.91
"For whatever reason, seems like a bad time to be short on this."
what happened to the $229 bids ? LOL
All I can say wow ..
This thing is ripping today
Shorted at $80.52 and still have half my puts.
They should announce the dividend next Tuesday sometime based on Past behavior history of when they file their 8K. If it doesn’t happen then you know they are having an issue.
@JOE you are a ray of sunshine my friend! If you don't like the stock beat it boss LOL. I hope you admit you were wrong when its above $100 chief....
Thinking this pump might be a bit overdone and is a good entry point for a new short. have to imagine that first earnings report will be brutal....
"SPG holders should buy TCO and sell covered calls. You can get $6 for Jan $35 calls. If SPG loses the lawsuit and TCO deal is on, TCO will go up and you pocket the $6. If the deal is off, SPG will go up and TCO will tank and the $6 will compensate for the loss."
Hi people hope you’re well so with yields on treasury’s on the rise wouldn’t that negatively impact real estate? Could you shed some light on that
I shorted 100 shares of AMZN at 1349 with a stop at 1348.
lol @ $2 dividend
Buckle up kiddos!
Congratulations to all longs! Most retail stocks have already doubled like Nordstrom and Gap. When do you guys think SPG will hit $120? End of December?
Does this board understand how many shares are outstanding? Over 300 million. This is like 6-7% dilution. Nothing! For the purchase of TCO. Genius
guess on x date. 5-13? maybe nx month- maybe a cut?
Just bought more. The lower the price th higher the yield.
A glimmer of a rebound
GAP will pay the rent and SPG will soar.
we don't know where the new bottom is we need to shake that out

"$WFC is dead money unless you're holding long term, and i mean long term. $JPM $SPG"
"$23 Billion in DEBT, and now the Simons want to spend another $1 Billion to refurb the collapsing malls. It won't work."
Bezos has gotten away with retail murder so far but sooner or later the States will be forced take action to destroy Amazon's monopoly business on retail.
These analysts are such morons. Time for GS and the other big boys to step up with significantly increased price targets.
SPG strategy is to take stalking horse purchase offers with these bankrupt clients just to set the purchase price floor for other buyers. They don't have a desire to win the bid but just rake in the rent for many years to come. That is why SPG went up yesterday when they were outbid by Sycamore for JCP assets. Doing the same with Brooks Brothers.
The div cut suggestion was from a call May 11.. this isn’t news
One store closes ---another two open !!! everyone loves a CInnabon--Malls will never die away EVER!!!! Everyone loves to try on clothing too. see you at 200.

This stock is so good when all the faang stocks and tsla is taking a beating.
Stock has topped off. Just a dividend play now
Just came to Vegas and the Simon owned Caesar’s location is busy.
How does the dividend work? I bought shares around 50 share price 100 shares do I get a check in the mail how do they know who I am and where I live? Do you have to hold the shares for a certain period of time to get the demo dividend???
"Aberronchie & Fetch, and Gap, continue to sink. More mall rats heading for the cliffs."

Stock downgraded A- Fitch
The 200 billion is moving
JCP just said its sales in Oct were 500 mil. 130 mil sales in a week end. if SPG get JCP for 800 mil. it eliminates rent overhead head SPG could start getibg JCP revenue not just rent! SPG just has to manage it and do whatever is efficient.
SPG just announced pricing of $300m IPO for its SPAC - will this move impact the stock price at all? Thoughts?

"All I know is by doing the opposite of what @Joe would like, I made money today. Thanks Joe"
Online retailers are going to brick and mortar and brick and mortar are going online. SPG can borrow at 3% long term and their dividend yield is almost 5 3/4%. SPG Revenue will be good. The GAAP and EBITA statistics will be decent.
"Here's how millenials shop nowadays...i know because I'm related to bunch of them.....They order 2 or 3 items online, see which one they like the most, go to Mall stores and return unwanted items. Crazy, but true. Ask your own relatives that are millenials....they're all doing it. So Mall traffic doesn't transcend to Mall purchases, mostly just convenient way to return items. just my observation....best to read retailer reports about mall vs online purchases and confirm for yourself. @Mark talks about long lines at restaurants, well if your establishment is restricted to 25-50% capacity, of course you're going to have long lines. Perhaps Google what Fauci and CDC said about in-store restaurant dining this week. Then go look at #DRI & #BLMN restaurant stock prices for Thursday and Friday. Don't let pumpers take up space in your brain. Research, research, research before investing.....and perhaps go to Malls and ask clerks how business is doing as far as actual sales and get their take on it. They're living it every day....if they say things are great and you don't see empty storefronts, perhaps it is time to buy. $18 BILLION a week has now disappeared via loss of $600 FED unemployment and doesn't look like a deal is in the works to extend it. Just a fraction of that money not going to Mall tenants is a retail apocalypse."
Time to break $122!
East $. Buy the open
If any of you listened to the call you would have heard the “best in breed.” These guys are studs. Stock is going to fly. Buying any weakness on the open.
How much was spg paying dividend when it was over $200 before covid?
Spg up $1 premarket
"The richest man is going to make a decision, lease or buyout?"
anyone buying this for long term?
"Not more than 20. It's going to see lower than 2008 price. Now more debt, move to cloud and worst situation. 20 is reality."
Tempting but i went with my gut and walked away. Shares seem cheap but I think the closing of businesses in the mall is telling as is loss of foot traffic especially during days like black friday last year are going to be permanent and continue to decline. its also a bit scummy for malls themselves to own the businesses. Lots of opportunities for fraud though I am not saying simons does that themselves. Gunna stick to other reits.
Short squeeze.Ride the wave but get out before it turns
REITs are all moving. SPG should be $100 now. These guys are the smartest in the biz.
"THE DIVIDEND CUT IS COMING. SO many headwinds, including a probable 50% dividend cut. If they don't surprise the market and make it a 35% or better, look out below. On top of the Taubman deal which they cannot admit was a serious blunder of timing, they are considering a bid on failing JCP?? More debt financing?? That looks bad either way as it almost certainly portends a long stretched out BK filing with JCP which means no rent for SGP for a major anchor tenant - otherwise why on earth would they even consider a bid. Back to the 70s faster that you can sing the Bee Gees."
il Keep Sarah but the rest of you can go unless your going to right burn me back
SPG reached a 52 Week low at 151.12
still waiting for dog to make 220

Head fake as predicted Huge divLet’s face the fact it’s just not malls anymore they are town centers for various shopping and entertainment Let’s also realize people can’t stay locked in their houses all the time they need places to go that they feel they can be entertained and get out without having to go awayShould be a good hold from here !
Dumping a bunch of puts to losers today
"No doubt between forbearance and renters going bankrupt and not reopening, revenues will take a significant hit. The question is how much of a hit and for how long? Then, how much of this reality is already priced into the current stock price? Down from $186 as the 52 week high is taking into account a lot of financial distress. Maybe it's time to dollar cost average in. 500 shares set at limit buys to catch intra-day dips will do. 4 to 8 times and you have a very nice long term hold. At least a double and maybe triple over the next 3 to 5 years."
Bought 500 more. Buy the weakness. It’s a slam dunk
"So SPG pays Divs on Jan and also in Feb?, pls clarify."
"Nice segment on CNBC this morning about mall traffic continuing to decline, across USA.Retailers response ? Build out an online presence (that Amazon already dominates). LOLSay bye bye to your easy money days, Simons!"
June 19th calls had another spike - get in while you have a chance.
"The dividend that will be paid on July 24, was originally scheduled to be paid in May. Another dividend was to be paid in August. What is the status of that payout?"
imo a spac wont do anything for investors of SPG unless they combined the net income and profitability into both

Easy $150. Buying the dips all day
I need virus to stay this way longer so spg can stay low. I am not done adding
@Joe I am officially jumping on your bandwagon baby! I am buying puts will go down for awhile so sad! I love this company but that’s way too many shares coming in! The CEO should be fire. I would have taken my chances in court if I knew that to pay for the Tubman deal I would have to add more shares and dilute the company shm
"When this stock was at $200, I wrote a story in Seeking Alpha that it is a ""SWAN""I still think its a SWAN, but one that croaked. All the best, Brad"
Look for the break above $85 and then we run to $100 fast
"Added more shares today! I sincerely love stocks that have yet to bounce back! In due time, this will surpass it?s all time highs! I?ll be waiting and holding until it breaks 200! I will also continue to buy on the dips! The truth is, mall space will take a bit longer for people to buy in! It just takes less uncertainty! Who will be our president, how fast will the vaccine be available? Or will we have so many people who get it, that the spread slows down significantly! This novel virus ain?t so novel anymore! Death rates dropping fast as #$%$ People who are fragile to it know they need to hide! Once the ones who have had it or aren?t fragile to it can shop, it?s back to the fundamentals! Therapeutics are already dominating this virus! Let?s gooooo SPG! Keep gobbling up these companies who can?t pay rent due to business! I?ll keep checking in to say hi to a previous winner whom will go back to winning in the near future! Get ready to join the party!"
holding until dividend news no matter what...sink or swim
if i buy today no dividend?
Got in at 149-150! Lets go.
"Way too many unknowns for previous buyers of stable stock and dividend. This is no longer ""Stable, Cheap or SAFE.....exactly the type of stock investors would have not touched 8 months ago. NOW....they're either selling or have become reluctant bagholders....not a good situation for stability, especially with Indexes close to new highs and ready to crash in the September/October months."
This stock up almost 30 points from low 45 to almost BB 75 55 a steal
"Notice that every time Yahoo business news brings up more news about the financial problems of Sears, and JC Penny the shorts jump on SPG and short the He## out of it. The news they bring up was out months ago but they rehash it over and over and then Simon Property goes down ever more. Even though Simon has not shown any big problems with store closings the shorts hit the stock with all they got. SPG has only 47% of its business in malls but you would think that with the way they hammer the stock one would think that Simon is 100% mall business and most of the stores are closing."
Shareholder equity on this company is 2 billion and declining. That is what the bondholders might get for it assuming the book value did not just drop to zero in the last month.
Don't listen to ZACKS and Joe !!!
Nobody going to shop at dead malls. Our way of life has changed. Malls are dinosaurs.
@Joe better sell your outs now. It will go to $80 after earnings.
"Need to have patience here. If you believe in the company and management then hold your shares. Just bought in here and have been waiting for a little while to do so. The stock was up over 10% on Monday... it's weekly gains are still fantastic and needs more consolidation before it pulls another move like Monday. Amazes me when people complain that a stock doesn't go up every day. If they did, we'd have Dow 100k already."
Guys is there strategy of buying undervalued tenets and turning them around working just a question ?
ABR reported 35% earnings growth. Forward PE is only 6.25. It can double in the next 12 months.

Did you guys received your dividend....?
"SPG is not really a reits company but more an Omnichannel company. Why would I say that?Because recently the reit companies dropped about 40% where as SPG is going up, that clearly means that SPG has the edge and will keep on going up."

"tenant bankruptcies, this might be yielding 10% soon"
"Does anyone know why SPG book value is only $7 while MAC's is over $17? If MAC's book value is over $17, MAC stock should be much higher than around $8. I thought MAC debt leverage is much higher than that of SPG so I was expecting to see MAC's book value to be much lower than that of SPG but it is opposite. Why is that?"
Millennial here. Just opened an account with RH a few weeks back and put all my savings in this stock. Bought in at 54 and I’m not complaining. Whooo!!!Stock market rules!
After 9/11 many people said they will never fly again. People get over things in time. People will go to the malls again.
@Joe buying more puts against Thanksgiving and Christmas. laughs
"With Simon Properties, here is the question; if the stores are closed, do the tenants still need to pay the rent?"
80 friday shorttards your puts worthless
Should race back to $150 quickly
"I made already 2 rallies on SPG. The first one was from 51 to 66 and the second from 62 to 90. I bought it for the third time for 65.4 (a bit high) and I expect to sell in high 80s again. No doubt earnings are going to be weak because this Q2 is the weakest ever quarter. And the stock is held down not in vain. The worst case scenario SPG will drop for a while below 60, though I doubt. Most likely it will be taken up in a fast manner on a base of recovery coming."
Good article on commercial real estate risk....#cnbc.
Once interest rates go back up. Time for the real estate crash lol.
Going to $80 end of months everything opening
what you guys think about the Tubman litigation... the market doesn't seem to care but it seems like a big risk to me.

This thing will continue to sink as more retail sector earnings plummet. I don’t know the bottom but I want in on this stock at the right price! Still a great long term investment! Will put an a order at $55 and see what happens
"I think 62 USD is a strong support, so don't worry guys."
Anyone nervous about this second wave of coronavirus? seems to be worse than the original breakout. On the fence on if I should buy now or later. Governors are starting to shut things down again.

"Forget the dividends. Simon is dying because its in the wrong sector.The world has changed, and people are not shopping at malls any more"
why would this be higher than pre pandemic?
spg ain't boring anymore
will they slash dividend?
"Ascena Corporation updates bankruptcy filing announcing 1,100 store closures. Retail apocalypse."
When does SPG payout next dividend?
Buy Aurora cannabis. They don’t have to beg for rent payments they’ll never get.
A complete adjustment onto all value stocks could occur after t results whether $viac $sbgi $spg etc
Dump this trash company! Mall retailers going Bankrupt every month.
Going way higher. Bought my 1k trading position. Back to 4k
"Posters @Michael doesn't understand what ""funds"" are and what ""retail"" is......retail can be a Raymond James manager who had pep talk to push a stock or their own product, which may be overweight that stock....just a simple example. A ""fund"" would be a big Wall Street name or Connecticut private investment group that sells off to the likes of the Raymond James types....so when I say retail....it's not the @Michael's of the World. another free lesson son :-)"

"The great value rotation and hunt for yield continues. REITs are definitely the sector of value recovery, as well as yield.

How much rent will Simon collect from a bankrupt SEARS ?
Bought at 86.50. According to you when will it climb back to that price ? Just curious here !

Simon's Board of Directors will declare a common stock dividend for the second quarter before the end of June. Simon intends to maintain a common stock dividend paid in cash and expects to distribute at least 100% of its REIT taxable income.
Imagine if SPG could turn JCP like Kohl’s? Then spin it off. Wow!
perfect i bought now
Urban Outfitters CEO just basically waived a white flag. Retail malls are in secular decline !!
"In at 51. No regret. Americans want to go to the malls, and not staying home.Long term investment for me."
so correct me if I'm wrong but SPG has 240million ish sqft of rented real estate. If you take the market cap 16 billion and in the debt of 24billion = 40billion ÷ by 240million sqft gives you a cost per sqft of 166. which seems like a steal. Hi end real estate easily goes for 500 to 1000 a sqft. I like to value the assets when buying a stock like this. This management team seems top notch and they're best in class when it comes to locations and real estate. All around this seems like a no brainer.....
90 percent of shopping is brick and mortar. Now it’s ups to 20 to 30 percent. That is short lived. People still want to go touch and feel and try on what they buy brick and mortar is not dead
"SPG is almost dead company. I see it cutting dividend and filing chapter 11, if Trump wins."
Right again! Who sold at the low? $125 by end of year. Buy the dips and be rewarded.
Where is the dividend !!
It was a bargain
I was waiting for a pull back...but's it's not coming....it's only growing.... I wish they would go down a bit so I can invest in this amazing dividend & growth stock. Better than a FAANG stock.
SIMON earnings are much greater than MAC. It's going to be a beat like MAC. Upward trend for earning is coming to mall REIT. Sorry little JOE JOE DK.
The vaccines are shipping now! Who thinks that means an end to this shutdown madness? Who thinks SPG will be over $100 this week?

Yes boy yessssss YASss I been accumulating every dip.
You can't buy toilet paper at Simon's Malls.
"I have homes in both Denver & Salt Lake City. Every time I've driven by a mall in the last 2 months, their parking lots have been 80% - 90% full. On weekends 100%+. Having been a retail real estate broker for the last 20 years I can, first hand, tell you that Simon stands tall above the rest. Definitely long on SPG."
We are a nation built on credit & consumption. SPG will go back
"Heading back to $76, pre-mkt value. Get it"
"Macy reports 20% drop in Sales from year ago quarter. Danger Will Robinson....""Danger""."
$95.56 and then we fly
Biggest reit in the world soon
SPG is up 13.02% to 61.10
Nine West is toast. Just another broke brick and mortar retail shoe peddler at your local Simon mall.
I bought SPG shares yesterday but I'm not sure if I will quantify for the div payable July 24th.Please comment if you have an idea.
"Mall in America is a dying business model, Amazon is eating its lunch."
"Simon's malls will be closed for a LOOOOOONG TIME.And when they re-open, many of the stores will have closed for good. Sell. All the best, Brad."
@Joe!!! Baby boy where you at today!! Homie
Any weakness in market will hit this share more temporarily. I would hold before buy more
Consumer confidence kicks off in 5min. Could get rough pretty quick. Be ready.
What a joke! bailing out forever 21! They might as well make up there financials! Paying your self rent as a landord!What a house of cards.
Sold ths winner too soon. Market tough on me....
@joe what you think about RDS.A??
This drop off has to be related to tenant woes: JCP and J Crew. When will the bleeding stop!
"Nice $3 plunge for the Simons. Just wait till the FED raises rates a few more notches, around your mall throats ?"
"That's right. No more stores, no more malls. Nowhere to shop. Everybody just stay home and buy everything online."
looks like we got beginnings of bear market along with SPG going down.
"Last Day to get out before disastrous earnimgs and next Quarter forecast.....stimulus money at best is being reduced to $400....at worst, disappearing altogether. Either way....Black Friday won't happen this year at all....think about that....the whole year will be red, and so will 2021, where all possible stimulus will have run out and 2017 corporate tax cuts will be overturned. Think 6-12 months ahead like the Funds do."
"Use this dead cat bounce to GTF out of this reit and any other REIT, The landscape has permanently changed for real estate, especially commercial."

More guilible investors thought cruise lines were sailing.....they got another wake up call today! These debt laden entities were priced to perfection and pumped by the Street to retail so funds had time to exit. Sound familiar?
The TCO buy was a horrible deal even before covid. Hopefully damages/penalties/legal fees for SPG are Kept at a minimum. Great decision to can this deal.
i shouldn't have sold this stock at 58...
Where is the bottom ? Selling like there is no tomorrowI think it will go under 130 after earning.
Spg train has left the station !!!!

"Recovery hopes revisited as stocks tumbleJun. 11, 2020 4:11 AM ET|By: Yoel Minkoff, SA News EditorU.S. stock index futures, along with global stocks, are taking another turn for the worse as investors cash out of an extraordinary rally following the latest comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.While he vowed to keep stimulus aggressive ""and keep interest rates near zero for years,"" he struck a cautious note on jobs, undercutting the hopes for a V-shaped recovery.""My assumption is that there will be a significant chunk, well, well into the millions of people who don’t get to go back to their old jobs and there may not be a job in that industry for them for some time. It could be some years before we get back to those people finding jobs.""A resurgence in COVI9-19 infection rates is also hitting states that have recently reopened, prompting concern about a potential second wave as the total number of U.S. cases topped 2M."

They are not paying rent and it doesn’t matter if they open if there is no demand due to 30 Million people been out of job and I see people here saying “this is so cheap it won’t go down below $50”  Sure it will but go ahead and keep buying I mean if you like to lose money!
Bought the dip as I do everytime. Breaking above $100 very soon
This is a cash cow unstoppable!
Buy the open - don’t even think anything else. So undervalued and niow with the vaccine.

Simon had a earning miss of 2 cents. Beat revenue and positive guidance. Hopefully if will drop 20% on the open. I promise not yo buy any:)
"Link at bottom. Much more in depth explanation of how the EUA is expected to go down. I learned a lot. Interesting the EUA approval could be much earlier than I expected, as early as just after Thanksgiving, and the meeting on the 8th to 10th is only an outside party to review the data further. This is likely to get public confidence that it is not just the government OK'ing the vaccine.----Concurrently, a group at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) - is scheduled to hold a meeting on Monday, November 23. However, once the FDA does authorize a vaccine, ACIP will meet within 24 to 48 hours and discuss if everyone should get the vaccine, or if some groups should be excluded, and who should receive it first.'If all this data holds true - and I'm hopeful that it will and I believe that it will - then I suspect we could have an EUA for one or potentially even two vaccines shorty after Thanksgiving,' he said.----Cliff NotesFDA Meets and approves the Vaccine shortly after Thanksgiving.

"I believe SPG will go private at around $100 per share. Blackstone and Goldman are dying to do this deal for the prime real estate, and they have too much cash earning 0%. I expect an announcement by end of May.Shareholders will want $125 to $150 a share, but ultimately the Board of Directors and shareholders will have to accept $100."
Toll Bros just increased divi - Simon up next
at 150 a share that would be 5.5 % dividend
"Oh Jose, did you miss the boat?"
are they trying to get the price to drop before the div announcement so they can load up on a cheaper cost basis?
Numbers weren't as bad as expected. Could have a big run now after it was left for dead.
Looks like Joe covered his short position
Simon suing Starbucks! Simon is so worried about their empty caverns that they intend to force Starbucks to keep losing money on their tea shops until 2027. Maybe Starbucks should convert the tea shops into hookah bars to spite the wise guy Simons!
No need for malls going forward.

Back to $150 fast. Buckle up!
snow flake resistance is at 115.
Trading is speculative!! This was $44 in April 2020..This is a stock to be held in a long term portfolio.. just my input

Stimulus will happen get in while cheap Vaccine will happen get in while cheap

Many new developments coming online, a restarting of the economy, and lower borrowing is going to drive up forward earnings pretty quick.Distributions Increase to 8 cents/unit resulting in FFO payout ratio of 58% or AFFO Payout Ratio 66%. I expect this to be in Q2 2020. Hopefully buybacks are announced first and start soon.Liquidity:200M Cash1B Unsecured LOC3.5B Unencumbered Asset PoolBad Debts will be lower due to elimination of CECRA write offs as well as fewer tenant bankruptcies. There are a lot of unknowns. Converting construction developments to a finished product, such as River Landing could materially improve Q4 result estimates regarding FFO & NAV. River Landing is the largest project completing. HR has stated that leasing was ahead of expectations in residential, and retail started to occupy space in November. However, it is likely they have a few months free rent and won't add much to FFO until Q1/Q2 of 2021. The board will likely take this new FFO and use it as additional tailwinds to support a vote on a distribution increase. If not, buying back units would be a good use of funds until the unit price recovers, then increase distributions in Q2 2021. I believe with 2020 write downs behind us, distribution increases are not only warranted, but also needed to ensure the trust pays out enough distributions to avoid any income tax obligations as a REIT. The focus in 2021 should be recovery of the unit pricing. $SPG $MAC $BPY $BXP $ARE $FRT $KIM $ALX $CIO $VNQ $WPC $BAM#D.UN #SRU.UN #SOT.UN #REI.UN #MR.UN"

0% chance more people are dieing from covid that feb... things are shakey in the REIT game game due to election and covid treatment...SPG ain't just some mall if your in for a year pluss your money should be safe... ignore non fact based fear mongers.
drop to $50 ... the junk wont recover
"Those who are espousing a return to 150 again, are in for a big awakening. I hope they are right and I'm wrong as I stand to gain more from their assessment. However, I'm of the opinion that SPG had made some very worrisome moves lately. I'm not a fan of JCP and believe they are an outdated retailer, with their sum of the parts being greater than the whole. Fail to understand why anchorage of an old fashioned store is such a lure for SPG that is basically a mall reit and lacks the expertise to manage retail skus and inventory control. Further, this direction detracts from their original commitment to buy TCO, which was more in line with their mission and vision. If TCO goes to court, SPG will most likely lose the battle and could be forced to leverage out way too high. OXY is the perfect example to illustrate the consequences of carrying large debt on the BS. Finally I consider it highly unethical on SPG's part to unreasonably fault TCO for inappropriate action during COVID-19. That's a CYA attitude. Anyhow, I hope I'm wrong and better days are ahead for SPG, TCO and all the shareholders. GLTA."
I got WELL at 49. sold at 59.60 this am then flipped it to SPG... it's near bottom trend line. little risk in my opinion and very large upside.
is the dividend listed real??? I am first time in SPG since 77. Good Luck to all
ER is good under the circumstances.
"Checkout all of the malls SPG owns on....https://www.simon.com/mallWhat a huge safe dividend of 8% too!Simon now owns Forever 21,Brooks Brothers,Lucky Brands and will probably lease some JCP stores to Amazon or not whatever.Regular healthy people like going to the malls,shopping, watching movies in theaters and eating at nice restaurants.Only fat people sit at home 24/7.Sorry,there will never be a total retail apocalypse of popular malls where normal people,families and kids enjoy life.Spg will go to new highs and is one of the best REITs on the market.SPG is the largest Mall owners in the US,and possibly in the world."
Place your bets. Sentiment is negative. Just like it was with Disney. Will it crash after earnings or will it go up? Based on Kimco rally today I’m going to add a little more on Monday.
Today's news of Apple closing recently reopened stores in areas with recent surges in C19 should be taken as a harbinger of the retail season to come.

Is their divvy safe at this current yield?
"nothing but a healthy pullback! Might not be green today, we can't have all green days but overall it will go to 100 soon."
where is our dividend announcement?
Short squeeze anyone?
imagine after the covid!
"98% owned by institutional, 2% panic selling, 50% manipulations...."
Hopefully this upside action holds today. Good news from Moderna on vaccine progress.
How many tenants have filed for bankruptcy? Why still paying a dividend? One bad decision after another with this company! Brooks BrothersSur La TableJC PennyMacy’s Neiman MarcusNordstromEnough of a list tons of others including smaller stores like 1200 GNC stores closingWhere do new tenants come from?
Simon Property will come out of this pandemic making even more money. They added cheap assets and are more efficient. This will run through its pre-pandemic level and gradually boost its dividend.One of the best recovery stock for sure... Disney is another company that will recover its pre-pandemic business while picking up streaming with Disney+ during the pandemic...So it will be an even better company.
"Link below: Investors are underestimating the speed and extent to which people will return to offices and malls, Bruce Flatt says$SPG $BPY $VNQ #REI #HRhttps://financialpost.com/real-estate/property-post/workers-will-be-lured-back-to-the-office-brookfield-chief-says"
I been holding this since last year this is dividend paying cash cow it will go right back to 154
Should I buy now?
GAP just signed Kanye and their stock surged. Wont this help SPG as this is one of their biggest tenants and might enable them to pay their rent? Also Taubman merger might be happening. Seems this stock will shoot back up after these two synergies come together?
New covidVariant sell
added more lets see
Buying extra 1000 back at open. Sell order out at $130
@Joe you will be the only fallen flag. SPG is great. Sorry you will be missing it pretty soon.
Come on $100 Dec 31!
I always want to own this stock.Still waiting for a bit of lower price.No rush.May be after election.
what's advantage of dividend
Will the Simons be handing out Christmas bonuses in the form of Toys-R-Toast gift cards ?Just another giant void in your declining mall portfolio.(smirk)
154 already
"We didn't think SEARS had 100 stores left to close, but that is todays news for the Simons."
SPG-PJ is up 11.44% to 55.62
"Deloitte surveys shows consumers spending considerably less and visiting fewer stores during this holiday season. Don't argue with me, argue with Deloitte."
Upgrades and dividend hikes in play
SPG should be worth $75 dollars at the high end. 15 times $5 eps. It is trading at 13 times book value if you want to look at it another way. That means 159 ÷ 13 is 12.23 BV per share. The average Reit in the U.S. is trading at 2 times book. If Spg traded at that multiple it would be trading at 24.50 per share. The long and the short is buyer beware this stock is very overvalued. Retailers do not want to pay 50 per square foot anymore when Amazon is paying 10 per foot for industrial space. Reits that cater to retail are doomed with their high debt levels.
Darn....I missed that $84 pop......would have shorted again :-(
"Illegal, Impossible, Impractical....argument GAP is using to claim Force Maujure in not paying rents. Also, a Federal Bankruptcy Judge in Chicago decided only 25% of past lease was appropriate for a Italian restaurant chain......besides that, none of theses Landlord/Tenant suits have actually set a precedent as of yet. Isn't it ironic Simon wants to break deal with Taubman, but they don't want tenants to break deals with themselves. Too funny."
See you at 20$
Shorts completely screwed they just sit here and bash
Can i look at list of SPG leasers list (main clients) ?
"welcome back to the $170s, Simons!You are a long way from $229, and it only took a tiny tick up in interest rates.Just wait sill cyber Friday pours some more coal onto your Christmas cookies!!"
She’s gettin ready to pop !
any dividend cut?
"Gap banana republic old navy closing 250 stores. H&M closing 200, express is bankrupt.. American eagle and Abercrombie are both skeptical on mall performance for next 5 years.."
"Joe is praying for miracles that COVID-19 continues so his puts can growas we are praying for miracles that vaccines come out to cure everyone and stimulus to save the poors.Sorry Joe, your prayer is more like a curse."
That will put a top in on spg and ecommerce will bottom
Any riot damage?
"We went to the mall this week and saw several stores and restaurants have already gone out of business. One of my friends is a commercial developer and he said several of his tenants are going BK so his company is cutting pay. Not sure why anyone would buy a company like SPG until retail recovers, if that ever happens."
LOW LOW volume...market makers keeping Retail investors lulled into sleep.
"ok debt is a bit too high, but dividend and margin is pretty big. not too expensive as well"
Simon Property is down 4.96% to 105.91
"Good time to get in still, it’s only up from here, this was $150 pre-Covid"
Already moving up with the positive comments on the call.
Ohh wow !!
"In the very short run, the 3-week lockdown which will go into effect will obviously be not good for the mall business. However, with the vaccine becoming available as soon as mid-December of 2020, the mall business should be picking up steam going into the spring. I don't necessarily see this stock bouncing back all the way back up to $150+ by the spring of 2021 but I do expect it to be back over $100. In the meantime, the holding cost is negated by SPG's dividends (hey, my money market pays 0.6% per annum so I prefer to stash some of that money into SPG)."
"$200 a share is the magic number for SPG. If we keep trading below that, we stagger going forward."
"These guys continue to crush it in the worst of times. Saving 60,000 jobs and printing $ while doing it. Amazing"
i sold at 146...i will buy again at 140
4 contracts for 80 November 20th #$%$ gunna blow up. x6 money I'm hopeing
SPG is bidding over $75 per share Shorts better cover.
Simon is a $ making machine!
"Low, Low volume....retail schmucks in for another day of fantasy as Funds unload to them."
Getting Our #$%$ Chewed Today.
"4.5% 'dividend' yield here is a yellow warning sign of sickness. Retail mall traffic is collapsing not because of the economy, but because of Amazon. AMZN is now getting into furniture sales and pharmacy. Enjoy the $44 BILLIONN debt load that the Simons have borrowed to build these relics."
This is a great stock but just not now with record high covids and more shut downs. Maybe mid 2021
I did a comparison of SPG and MAC financials. MAC is undervalued by 4.3 times compared to SPG and deserve a stock price of $60.
Out of the Horses mouth 20 minutes ago. McConnell says stimulus unlikely before the election.
Definitely a buy in low 60’s and watch the algos go crazy
what the hell? with news its red
With so many strong buys and positive articles- what happens if it is downgraded?
"Im very long on this. Every time it dips, I'm buying. Im absolutely not scared at all"
"You kidding me, only less half the blue states does any shut downs. Malls are bustling in ALL RED states."
"A Mall stock cannot buy out their failing tenants, but not their distribution centers and be successful. Simon buying out retailers is last gasp, desperate attempt to stop thousands of other tenants invoking leasing covenants that allow them to break or renegotiate leases if a mall loses its Anchor. Then, you have IKEA as new market player in US as a anchor itself. But instead of renting, they have their own property grouo which is buying malls with missing anchors at firesale prices. This concept of a manufacturer buying malls is totally different than Simon and Brookfield trying to enforce leases via poor bankruptcy buys. jmho."
"Simon is not in the mall business. They're actually in the lawsuit business. A good business stays out of lawsuits. Simon keeps getting into them. All the best, Brad."
Love this company. Can't wait to see what they will be doing/changing with JCP and Taubman. Great business sense. This should go up because they have the better upscale malls that will not be going under. Once the pandemic simmers down this should be back to 150+ with the dividend back to norm.
"I went to malls they are packed , this is crazy watch the surprise earnings"
"This move was telegraphed in the last conference call and was obvious to anyone that heard the call or read the transcript. Market hoped for a renegotiated deal but it didn't happen. So, it goes to court and will cost $100m in legal fees and eventual payout of probably $500m to Taubman in about 3 years. Taubman will likely be sold to BPY/BPP if they no longer want to go it alone, but they will probably wait until post-vaccine at this point. They will survive just like the others, that isn't the issue. I doubt they renegotiate now out of sheer spite. They didn't have to merge in the first place.That conference call was all 'can't comment due to pending litigation' along with weird statements all designed to provide public declarations differentiating Simon from Taubman. Simon- 'We are most definitely not a mall company. Please don't call us that, we are soooo much more'Implication- We are gonna call Taubman out as a mall company in court, so we are different.."
lol buy end of day and sell when market open dont think anything ..
SIMON PROPERTY BUYS TCO this could be a game changer if intergrated correctly cash flows will boom and the stock will shoot up.
Will be trading over $200 soon
L’Chaim !!!!!!$PK $SVC $SABR $DAL $SPG
Looks toppy here
This companie's EPS is so good for a reat estate giant $$$
We need some more trades man - I’m all for a 68 solid range but how long will it go for .
"LOL, this is a strong sell at every brokerage firm. Not sure why you would buy it, dividend is not safe and they are going to have SO many defaults on commercial property. The early consensus is possible bankruptcy... what are you doing."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/03/next-big-problem-businesses-cant-or-wont-pay-their-rent-its-setting-off-dangerous-chain-reaction/
"This is insane, my cost basis for SPG right now is $62.49 and I’m up 46% to date! Lol. Once the vaccine is officially out I can only imagine how much higher this will go!"
Amazon Stock is 500 Billion valuation. Now with their projected earnings of 4 billion for 2017 the ER will have to dbl for 10 years to get to the 1/2 trillion valuation. Do you think this stock is a little overvalued?
Buy any dip to $100. This company is a pandemic winner. Sure tech. is awesome and the way of the future (and valuations will tell you that to LOL) but you will never stop our need for human interaction and experience.
"bought at 55, not selling till 200 however long it takes"
what a bargain
Will be $85 tomorrow with this news
What is the board’s opinion of the effect of the Regeneron antibody clearance news on SPG? More or less or as relevant as news about vaccines?
What happen guys lmao
Something is not right here. Did they suspend dividends? Like always the big guns get the news first.
Have 1000 out for sale at $114. Have way too much
How long I have waited for this. With the div announcements this is on a marathon!
"Eliza Ronalds-Hannon, Lauren Coleman-Lochner and Gillian TanThu, March 4, 2021, 11:30 AM(Bloomberg March 04, 2021) -- Mall owner Washington Prime Group is preparing a potential bankruptcy filing. SPG slow bleed? REIT Contagion and Covid mutations leaves no one spared"
Malls and lifestyle centers packed this weekend again bears are so so wrong on retail reits
"I don't see this is an easy win for SPG especially quarantines where in place during outbreak and government still order corporations to pay employees. Anyway, long term we still hope it's good for SPG. Short-term hope gap is the only one not paying rent. But.... We also seeing jcpenny and Nike both probably also can't pay rent during quarantines close down ordered by government.....https://finance.yahoo.com/news/simon-property-gap-see-court-175156871.html"
Easy $. Don’t even care if the stock goes down. Ride that divi. Simon clan is a money making machine
New news on JCPENNY bankruptcy....see headlines.
"I had a theory that is making me interested in buying some SPG. Say few months go by and it wasn’t all doom and gloom but cases steady or dropping. People still are terrible savers and want to spend money, but not big money. I see less people splurging on international travel, flights, hotels , etc out of safety, and instead staying local and spending money in shops, thus making malls and restaurants the first industries to stage a comeback. I am not factoring in international shoppers who come to America though. Thoughts?"
This CFRA analyst Chris Keifer just downgraded SPG to SELL with target price of 120. Has anyone else seen that downgrade?
the biggest stimulus is an open economy! if what is said is true... about rent collection... time open q2 compared to q3.... things like delayed rent and some store closures will not greatly effect the market... the difference between SPG and other malls... SPG shoppers are less likely to feel the effect of this shut down... if people can go out SPG shoppers will spend.
Expecting a decent to good earnings report. Revenue should be higher and hoping Gap has paid their way overdue rent bill. Also interested to the see how SPARC Group is performing with the newly aquired companies.
What day is the dividend date as I want to buy some shares.?
They have 80billion real estate value
Is this a buy? or hold or sell ....
Shutdowns are starting again.... See you back in the $40s
Futures lower - buy any weakness. Going a lot higher
The question is when do we set new all time highs of $229.10? This year?
Scrumptious divi coming soon!
By the dep it's a bullship so off it will be back by end of day
To the moon
David continues to accumulate stock...hmmm
Looks like divies are still safe. Time to load the boat.
"Hope I don't see a news where people loot, destroy or burn Simons and its related stores in US"
"I am tempted to pick up some SPG shares at $63, any thoughts?"
good start into the day. I guess those who bought during the pandemie like Simon will be rewarded

My team bought AMZN years ago because we saw this coming. The total pathetic collapse of retail 'department' stores!
"The dividend bribe didn't work, lookout below. Please trade accordingly."
When I sell out Simon Stock I will buy GOLD.
"This is very very undervalued for the drip and face value. The bears argue retail is dying and even if that was true, this property can be converted into so many things such as class rooms, medical offices, and storage spaces. Look how well public storage is doing."
Does anyone know when the earning release time is today?
"This should be a good entry point for SPG. Those retailers' bad news should have already baked in since June.$72-75 should be the trading range for August, assuming no lock downs."
Trading range
Has Amazon purchase %10 of the share yet.
Share your reaction
"AMZN new high! In the years ahead, these 'malls' will be converted into homeless shelters, drone warehouses, and ultimately recycling centers for the 60 years of consumer #$%$ packed into American homes, basements, storage facilities, and backyard sheds."
15 days ago I posted that Simon would raise the dividend to 2.10 and looking at morning ER they did indeed raise to 2.1 ands Earnings of 2.99.
I think this will break back to 84+ around 10 am west time
Back to $60 ladies !!!
shorts getting crushed
PITI-FULL volume....just pitiful......investors become bagholders by refusing to see reality.
New base $96. Buy any dip that get close. Next stop $150
Will SPG finally cross the 60 USD and go down to 50 USD? I'm still waiting..
"Simons played the 'community good actor' card in their legal battle against Starbucks tea shops.Yeah, Simon, tell that to the tens of thousand of small mom & pop retail stores all over America that were destroyed by monster corporate malls built since the 1960s."
Beginning of the end of the pandemic. Back to normal by summer. Let’s go!
Amazon only down 18. It could fall to 800
50 coming complete trash
Will SPG hit my year end price target of $100?
"If I sell today, will I receive the dividend?"
Looks like @joe has sold his puts. No hysteria.
why are there so many shorts on this board today
Thats weird all this talk on the board that it was heading to $100
"Stock market at record highs, yet simple Simon making multi year lows. Retail malls are in permanent decline. Get it ? Got AMZN stock ?Under Armpit tanking today, just another retail loser."
"simon reached a deal with taubman! SPG bought JC penney, brook brothers and taubman. SPG is going to be giant now when all these syngeries kick in!!!!"
"All the easy money has been made, but the combination of that dividend and the potential upswing makes this stock still look compelling here."
NYC Lockdown set to December 1st
"This is easily one of the best REITs, silly to be this cheap. Great eps 6.41, excellent profit margin 36.78%, they turn 3.6 b of operating expenses into 5.67 b of revenue and what does the 10 year chart tell you? Super stable $100+ a share. Malls aren't going anywhere, and these guys have plenty of food in the stockpile."
"Quite a bit of correction of ~30 points from April highs, what has gone wrong?"
Real stronG hands buying all day - ceo is a winner
$80 by Friday
Bought the open.
Went to mall from 2-5 pm on black Friday. it was packed
