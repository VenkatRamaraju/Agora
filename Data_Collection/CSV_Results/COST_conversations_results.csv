Recent headlines and conversations for COST
"my hope is we stabilize at 150,,,,"
China population is 1.34 BILLION U.S. 311 million. Costco has plenty of room for expansion.
The stock market is rampaging. Up 35% in past month. Where is the volume though?
"Hanging tight around the emotional $300's. If it can pop over this, up hill from here."
COST looks exactly like Chipotle did a few years ago.
What times the report
I heard late August for the special dividend.
Price to book is 9.5ish.... PE 42ish.... Am I missing something? Seems awfully expensive still. Fair price in my eyes would be around $175 per share but that’s miles away.... Might have to put this stock on hold for now
Memberships up huge.good sign.
Remember COST always BOUNCES back !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!mark my words !
Sales doubled passed three months and stimulus and unemployment will be factor in this quarter
"This is crazy. Almost a 33 PE ratio for a retail stock. I love this stock, but it is getting stretched too faar and its time for a pullback"
"2 months ago this same stock was $393...,let that sink in"
"Special dividend?? I don't think so....Costco is all about looking out for employees, members, suppliers, and shareholders. This year it already raised wages for all employees substantially, and already raised the regular dividend, plus committed to plow $4 Billion into it's own stock, so don't think they will tack on a special div this year!"
Retail sales drop will take Costco down to 250. They are not selling anything that give them any margin. They don't make money on toilet paper.
BUY on these dips.........................................
This stock continues to flounder. Over priced and no where to go even when it exceeds expectations.
I expect a climb after call
Only reason its up is because people think the Fed is going to cut rates more. Not trading on fundamentals because it would be $200 max if it was.
here is your chance to get back in @ lower prices.Headed to 330.00-340.00
think we will see 300??
People are panicking buying lots of supply’s from Costco this stock is gonna explode
"Judging from all the bullish sentiments on this board, this stock is sure to fall. Costco is overpriced!"
Another thing to consider is that Costco put a halt to the samples during the pandemic. It has been proven that in sample days the average transaction increase in both number of items and dollar value. Costco going to benefit from reopening as well!!
COST getting attention from big investors.Targets could be set too low here.
awesome report... beat estimates .....
Brace yourselves and expect that the sp might go down tomorrow. Its not because of earnings its because of the trade war. If it goes down just add more because sooner or later it will go back up and beyond $250. Not a matter of if but a matter of when.
Will traffic in the stores be down over this holiday season due to less large gatherings?
Nice DIP....... for buy opportunity.
It’s going up
210.00-215.00 a BUY
I am getting tired of this flea called the Costco stock which I purchased for $303 at the onset of the lockdown and it has not made any substantive move. Now there is an earnings miss. I think it is time to get rid of this flea and invest in stocks which look more promising.
The price needs to drop so I can buy deeps.
Sold today at the high will buy again on the pull back before earnings
"Next week Costco would cross 295.And when the quarterly numbers come out., it will be 330 plus."
The worst thing is it can go to zero!
"Like many of you, I've gotten so accustomed to Costco's soaring stock price, that the decrease over the past 2 days (-4.5%) has been concerning. So I wanted to pass along some info that should restore your confidence.First of all, bigger drops occurred in late Oct (-6.3%) and early Nov (-5.4%), but quickly recovered each time. There is no fundamental reason why it shouldn't do so again.Secondly, today's weakness was due to November's sales report (+13.4% comp) which slightly lagged Sep (+15.5%) and Oct (+14.4%). However, November still surpassed all other months in 2020 - and Aug YTD comp was only +8.4%. Since December's ER covers 1Q of FY21, it will be the best quarterly sales gain of any previous fiscal quarter.Finally, a quick review of financials shows Costco's FY20 margins (Gross Margin/Oper Inc/Pretax Inc) were about 10bp better than FY19 or FY18. With the highest-ever quarterly sales, plus improved margins, Costco will report their best earnings in history, by far!Oh, and I also noticed that Costco's increase in paid members has almost doubled in 2020 (+7.8%) from the 2 previous years (+4.5%)."
Sub $300 tomorrow.
Should I still buy at this price? Or wait for drop?
Cost stock has been least down compares to any other tech stock
"Costco = fun to shop and walk through store. While Sam’s Club has similar layout, why doesn’t it feel the same?"
"To, The Leadership & Management Team of Costco, I will now on stop my membership and purchase in Costco until I see visible and noticeable Green initiatives from Costco that it has been so lagging as compared to Amazon and Walmart. Examples1) EV Charging points at Costco location do not exist and no plans for it announced. Walmart and Whole Foods already have many stores that offer EV charging.2) Warehousing and supply chain in Walmart and Amazon are going green with Electrification of delivery vans, Hydrogen forklifts, etc ramping up at a fast pace. Costco seems to be following old polluting energy technologies and no new plans announced yet.3) There is no clear public announcements on dollar amounts spend on green initiatives. Costco's website mentions few initiatives but seem more like a check mark and essay on procedural improvements with no clear definition on scale of projects. In contrast Amazon and Walmart have announced multiple projects in excess of billions of dollar for green initiatives.4) Costco does not have a published net zero carbon plan. Period.I request every users of Costco who believe in green and sustainable future for our kids and generations, please question, challenge and put pressure on Costco to wake up and show initiative. I will be watching and waiting to see before I resume purchase in Costco again.PS: I never owned Costco stock and neither have any plans in future to own it."

"Just back from Costco. Holy Traffic Jam, Batman! The lot is full and an aux. lot is full. Every register humming. Gas lines six deep waiting. No wonder the stock is ripping. Big upgrade from Citi today. Very important, but I wonder where the analyst was 15 point lower on the dip. New high coming."
"Costco is a millionaire maker, just hold and don't listen to to loser bashers"
"@Anna in this 100% sure higher inflationary environment, COST business model is going to get boosted the biggest compared with WMT and TGT! Ppl reselling products from COST wholesale are accelerating worldwide, not just in the US! COST Chinese official website is empowered to satisfy customers throughout the entire country! In January, their new membership numbers are increased by 800%! If 2020 is an unexpected surprise for COST business, ️️️️ is an even huger boom for COST to surge to the next level on schedule!COST is going to announce the increase of their membership fee!"
"Online sales soaring , memberships are up huge and sales are through the roof $$$Buy buy buy"
Costco is my most favorite organization. I have been holding their stock since 2008/2009 recession. There is no doubt if an investor considers further investing with more stocks at this price for LT.
"Merrill, Ameritrade and Schwab special dividend received. E*Trade as of this morning not received."

"Agreed with Bryan,hopefully announcing some time in the second quarter"
Special dividend coming
We get the $10 bucks + stock appreciation. No brainer Costco is a winner!
“Costco wins big in China”
"A retail store with a PE over 30. this is rediculous. 24, tops. wait till everyone drops down their memberships. less traffic. Way overvalued. Great company, line it, but overvalued. I'll buy way cheaper."
"I bought Costco at $150. a share a number of years ago. I bought because I could never find a time when there weren’t line ups. I liked the products and they pay their employees fairly with benefits. I liked the idea of the dividend, too. All those things remain the same. This is a great stock to have and to hold..."
"Look for the DIPS as great entry point............................Targets raised again, average 400-418.00"
stock is going up..you want in. get in now..over $300 next week
Costco declares a .70 cent dividend for next quarter. Keep up the good work
No increase in Corporate tax rates while the GOP controls the senate.
I think they are about to declare the special dividend
Why is Costco down so much on the back of great July sales numbers? Can’t find anything on a reason . . . .
"Costco China planning first store. ... Costco currently has 749 warehouses, including 519 in the US and Puerto Rico, 98 in Canada, 38 in Mexico, 28 in the UK, 26 in Japan, 14 in Korea, 13 in Taiwan, nine in Australia, two in Spain, one in Iceland and one in France."
This stock is going up $6 minimum after Q4 earnings report.
Nothing but an excellent company. Stock might provide future rewards.
I expected it down on great earnings. Membership is key. Maybe that is why it is up.
Waiting for short sellers to take it lower so I can add more with Special divi.
"Look for the SILLY dips as buy opportunities , Institutions are loading here, 400+ soon."

"Does appear that Buffet had it correct. Stock is is overvalued at this point in time. Had be down for past three months despite good numbers. Great company, great products. But stock has gotten over valued."

"pre market down...this stock is not what it used to be, has literally gone no place in the last 4 months...and this was one of the busiest places on the planet a few months ago...zero money to be made here"
Every Costco is jammed. Wells Fargo is the most corrupt major bank. Stick it out
I AM LOSING MY LIFE SAVINGS IN COSTCO!!!
Way to go
Why the bump today ? News?
management is spending too much time working on covid-19 rather than managing the business until the stores are enjoyable again it will be flat at best. sold my shares over a month ago and have no plans to repurchase.
Good post by R a few hours ago. Spot on information!
Look for COST to offer Covid19 Vaccinations soon at their drugstores !!!!!!!!!!!!!!this will be a HUGE plus on top of the increased sales !
Tax cuts are HUGE bonus for COST..................................
What a joke this market is.
holds ok could be much lower today
a good time to buy
Costco fiscal Q1 EPS $1.45 vs. expectations $1.33.
Sales up by 6+% as compared to last year's same period
why is the stock down so much today?
3/01/21 Costco Wholesale Corporation raises it's starting wage to $16/hour.#leadnotfollow
Great defensive stock. Long term holding in portfolio. Only regret not getting in before 213.
"COST is showing some weaknesses here, probably buyers are waiting to see how far it will drop before start to accumulate again. It seems that day traders reduced their activities too since the volume is very thin. This is a cycle that COST goes thru and next leg up will be strong which will push it up to $162 areas."
I think that 4B offering is showing up
Pretty scary 6 month chart
My bright idea: Costco should be acquired by Amazon. I think the Whole Foods addition to Amazon was favorable and made sense. Adding Costco to the family would be a great advance!
COST should not be down under any circumstances
Up almost $20 in just 3 days. Who cares about pensions. Cost is the best stock for retirement lol.
"ISM is down to the 2008 level.Manufacturing has shrunk for the past 6 months.Soon as corporations start reporting red, and laying off people, stocks will tank instantlyMark my words,,"
"What is so wrong with having an improving economy with low rates??????rates were this level in 2020, no one complained then........."
Instacart seems doing really well in this bear market. Is this benefit to Costco?http://www.gorket.com/2018/04/06/instacart-raises/
HEY GALIANO...GREAT CEO MOVE INCREASING THE WAGES TO 16...THAT EXTRA BUCK MADE THE DIFFERENCE IN MISSED EARNINGS. BRILLIANT MOVE.
"I don't really understand the impact of the Amazon deal on Costco. Costco gets the majority of their profits from membership fees, I thought."
Undervalued !! Time to start accumulating !!
COST and AAPLMUST HAVE as core holdings...............................
its friday....might as well sell off your costco stock
People don't return things they will eventually use Judge. That is a wholey insane assumption.
"If they are not doing good, they wont pay $16 min wage. It will fly to $400 tomorrow."
i would rather have cosco just increase their dividends a little
This is the best panic stock out there.
I think this has been red for 2 months straight now. What is the bottom? $250? $200? Lower?
“what looked like a massive earnings beat was actually an earnings miss as the results included a 17 cent a share lift from the new tax reform plan.”
you guys think this will dip below $300? I know today it got pumped with the stimulus stuff
Costco has been up 40%+ YTD.
"I am not happy about Costco taking advantage of consumers during this crisis. They allow business owners to line up early every morning before regular shoppers, and they work in teams to snap up as much as they can buy as quickly as possible, it is a race every day. There are videos showing how this is going, and it is every day as they buy as much as Costco will allow them to buy and they come back every day. Then those small business owners turn around and re-sell those items in their little stores for outrageous prices. I have been trying to buy toilet paper for 3 weeks now, and online, again, shame on Costco, NO toilet paper can be purchased for delivery at least in my near-Las Vegas zip code, per their website. I am losing faith quickly in Costco and this is enough to make me reconsider remaining a member, there seems little value in being a member when they give small business owners this advantage. Also, as much as they have been able to sell these pig merchants, my own purchases are way down because nothing that I truly need can be purchased anymore."
Amazon is not in competition with Costco................
We are maintaining our BUY rating on Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) and raising our target price to $330 from $315
295 i am in.
When is ER
Up $15 in just 2 trading days!! Soon all will wonder what was behind the past 3 month long sell off that occurred ? Laughable!!!
"I really never looked at costco as a covid stock, but it turns out it was..now that the rules are loosening..costco stays stagnate"
Costco posts strong November sales because AMAZON ISN'T ALL ITS MADE UP TO BE. IT'S ALL FAKE NEWS ADVERTISEMENT TO BOOST THE STOCK PRICE AND MANIPULATE INVESTORS. Costco isn't going anywhere.
The fear factor has just started. The virus is spreading in the US. There is nothing that the govt can do but shutdown cities and since this is not China it wont happen.
I knew it would drop with good earnings because the market is a SHAM.
"Amzn + whole foods = winning formula? Somehow I feel it is delusional. Sure Amazon killed a lot of businesses in the past but not everyone. One of them is Best Buy. Especially Amazon is now charging sales tax, and now Best buy can match Amazon's price. So Amazon lost advantage totally there. On whole foods side, it is well-known its price is ridiculous high. In the meantime everybody else are introducing organic foods --- costco, walmart and sams club to name a few. So in a way whole foods is already circumvented by these companies . Don't see how Amazon can change that."
"a local gas station, major brand has gas at the same price as my local Costco, quite a surprise. 3.69 (87 octane.)"
This is the norm. RED every single day...ZERO support. Retail play is done and is now way overbought...this can only keep going down irregardless of the ER. We will see pandemic lows of $275 really soon I think
Costco had a $420 price target in the past. I stil believe we will hit and pass $420 by early summer
Why COST AMZN NFLX AAPL are not participating in today’s rally??
Opening tomorrow 390
With good earnings and expectations. How could this happen? Any ideas?
keep loadin on dip days till next earnings u wont be dissapointed
"I just came back from Costco, parking lot was full, lines were long but cahiers worked very efficiently. Customers carts were full and everything always runs smoothly. Employees are paid well, customer returns are always in favor of the consumer, firing on all cylinders looking for a beat next Thursday."
Costco is only good if they have the products. They were out of some products this past weekend.
I just bought a lot today. I still believe Costco continue to be successful for long time.
The stock is up 27% YTD. I don’t understand why you all are complaining...
below 200 before end of nov?
Costco would be a huge beneficiary of $2000 checks which look very likely after GA senate results.Republican senate was blocking it vehemently..
"IMO, this has to retest 341 support. Overbought for now. I am not buyer, but seller."
"COSTCO is charging the sales tax based on regular price , not the sale price of all items it puts on sale for ONLINE PURCHASES.So if Costco has something on sale from $120 , to sale price of $100, it is still charging SALES TAX for online purchases based on $120.Costco is collecting this tax, is it paying this sales tax or profiting from it?Costco was INFORMED OF THIS OVER 6 months ago and continues to RIP OFF Customers online."
EPS 1.59 its a BEAT !
Machine traded market !!!!!
Be cautious with China news. The Chinese are notorious about abusing return policies. Costco may be in for a big surprise. Look at history of other Brick and Mortar foreign companies. Do your own DD.
Monday and friday..usually not good days for Cost stock
Anyone else notice the large blocks of 10/16 call options bought at a $460 strike price?? It’s at $345 pre earnings.. Am I crazy or is that real?
Moving past 400 soon
"Wow $GRF Greenrise Foods greenhouse stock owns 70 acres of greenhouses in Leamington, ties with Sunset Brand who sells produce to $COST. $GRF actually owns and operates 30 acres of Sunset greenhouses (grows, sells to them and they sell to Costco)"
I’ll be buying at $275 next week
"Option pinning, youd be crazy not to get in for calls for next week going right back to 350."
Will buy some shares today. ..well managed company
355 by call time.
Is it on ?
"costco shares are not to be compared to what the company does,,,fools chase price of stock,,the company has no give a damn about the stock because they sold it already to you a long time ago"
on target for $200.
"Realistically, Costco deserves a multiple of about 10. Single digit sales growth, low margins and some union labor are the reason."
"Costco makes the majority of its money from membership fees. They barely skim profits off from goods sold, and thus customers are likely able to realize ROI from their membership fees in just a few trips. Even if they bump up the price by a few bucks for the first time in several years, that won’t change.Their renewal rate is 90%. With that kind of loyalty, I doubt such a move would be dangerous at all.Honestly, as both a member and an investor, I kind of hope they go through with the increase."
Do you guys know if they are before or After the market on Thursday? Thank you
going green SOON.
Why is COSTCO going down at all. Makes no sense.
Up today
This company will continue to grow into its valuation as it might be the best manage company out there. I have watched it for far to long and right now is as good as it gets for buying.
costco er will b huge ..... 308 peaked and we r down from peak .....hop so post er it will jump 320 approx
"An increase of 6.9% for August, 7.0% for the fourth quarter, and 7.9% for the fiscal 2019 year in sales over 2018."
I’d rather be invested in a company that cares about there employees. But I guess I’m just built different. Stock go up and down. These people worked everyday as did I. Yet I make a lot more $ then them. They deserved a raise!
Costco reports after market close today. Should be welcome news
Costco goes to $300 by July.
No special dividend!
Needs to double the dividend
So glad i was buying the dip in late Feb & early March :)
"COST can pump up membership to 60-70 million memberships within a 5 years. The number that I assume is very possible. COST makes profit around 14 %, I guess COST will beat WMT in a few years."
"Backed up the truck and loaded the bed with more COST shares. Will back the truck up again if there is an earnings selloff. COST is dirt cheap in the lower 300s. TGT and WMT are also at bargain levels right now. Own all 3 and the big e commerce names and discount retailers. These sections of commerce are what will last long into the future, unlike traditional brick and mortar retailers that aren't discount places or are traditional shopping centers like department stores. I have been taking full advantage of the rates temper tantrum and loading the coffers on every dip. Long term COST will go back to 400 and then take out 500. These bargain prices won't last forever folks so take advantage while you have time."
"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/2633-instead-of-1599-a-case-costco-shows-seattle-customers-just-how-much-soda-tax-costs-them-2018-01-10I like this A LOT. Smart company, smart management. I am a member, don't own the shares, but no reason not too."
The shorts did have a point 
It’s hanging on $338 for over 2 hours now. At least it did not continue to drop. Solid at $338 . In no time it will turn back to 350
look at the costco chart. Very clear that it has bottomed. I see 160 in a month
"Well, Costco share sale is over, if you didn't buy too bad.Yes $400 this yr. is easy if you consider last yr. gains at all.Darn I love my Costco Stock!"
COST is above 400 next month! We’ll see 360 today!
the earnings call is at 5 Eastern. anyone saying they know the earnings is a lying short
Long line ups outside with shopping buggies discourages many shoppers; limits on who comes in; low volume in the warehouses. This is all priced in already.
"Low risk, moderate reward. A can’t lose stock. You just need patience."
"Viral video clip in China, drove the stock to hit 300. Another great month sales number ensures that Cost will hit 320 before Oct 3rd. Picture is worth 1000 words, If COST's PR goes get a few more clips from China, sends it out the few network. If Oct 3rd, COST has any plan to open up store in China, jus2 a month. I bet you that COST will hit 350 by year end,."
"Costco is great!! the only issue is that its way too expensive for me, Augmented Reality is the future and IPNFF is a Gem, it'll keep popping and end up like NEXCF because they're the only two companies in the market that sell AR as a product, GLTA know what you own."
"""Costco May sales rise 7.5% to nearly $13 billion, online sales double""Here we go... this is a shot Costco stock needed. A little reassurance that they are flying high. OH, lets here those naysayer's say something about negative Costco's online sales now , LOL. Can you looses say ""DOUBLE IN SALES ONLINE""?""Costco May sales rise 7.5% to nearly $13 billion, online sales double"""
"Earnings will be good, I bet ya the stock will go down initially though, it seems to be the trend this quarter"
Did COST crash a plane?
Started working for Costco this year. Met the CEO last month. Great company. Very well run . Our most is wide.
"And just like that......in just 2 trading days, Cost is up over $8 lol. Gotta love that lol"
$20 special dividend coming.
You can see COST weakening...it cannot get back above $267.20....I think the top is in....just waiting for over valued PG to finally give it up.
have BUY orders ready soon..........................
"Cowen rates Costco shares outperform and, in a rare move these days, raised its price target to $360 from $350."
everytime I check into this..it gets worse..pure crab
Largest foot traffic increase this weekend at my COSTCO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!its just like CHRISTMAS.........................................
COST target price is listed at $400 on yahoo finance based on the average estimate of 26 professional analysts. I would go by that before I went by an estimate by anyone on this message board!
shopping at Costco is still the top choice for most people.
I bought in at $390...and then is crashed...come get me..I. at the 390 intersection
never sell this gem.
Gone up daily for a week now...I see no problems ahead. Also agree with the parking lots always filled which only means good news for investors. Stop by sometimes just for the rotisserie chicken..Best Buy anywhere.
"Expansion in China alone will need over 200 to 300 stores to open just to start to handle their demand. This stock will, will continue to keep doing well and eventually reach 400 or higher in the future"
"Now we know how in the world the price was taking a hit after good news last months/quaters, the big boy has been dumping it all. Bye Warren."
Hey Balls- just sell the GD stock and be done with it already. These are unprecedented times we’ve gone through in the last four months so either sell it or take an extra pill.￼
When Buffett sold i realized I needed to get out and thankfully did. Love Costco as a store but sold on the premise you should never fall in love with your stocks. Costco is overpriced when you look at it's earnings. I'm doing great in Under Armour and you would think with all the sales Costco has done during the pandemic it wouldn't be falling off the cliff. I'll look to buy again when it drops to a more reasonable 200 to 260
Do you suppose Costco directors forgot the div meeting?
"$400 by 2020, they rule China. One billion new members."
"Guys. Time to buy cosmetics COTY, vaccine will be approved very soon, huge upside."
Makes no sense...
Mark this post. $10.50 special divi will be announced
"Still Overbought, Overpriced. Worth about 190 at best."
Stock price turns on a dime. Why so turbulent?
"Costco Wholesale (COST) PT Raised to $230 at BofA/Merrill Lynch on Q1 Report; 'Accelerating Traffic, Comps & Membership Growth' Source: streetinsider dot com"
$315 next week?
Up or down after earnings and what price are y'all estimating?
"How is it that we have strong earnings albeit at a slight slower month to month level yet beating expectations and now for the last 3 days more than $10 have been wiped off share price. So much for the $10 ""special"" dividend. It should be renamed Special Stick Price Eraser. we announce $10 and it cost shareholders $20."
Investment firm D A Davidson new rating has COST as neutral. Says its membership has top out.
This is a good stock. See the 300's soon
"I am curious, how many who post on this board have Prime? I assume everyone who posts here own Costco stock, but I am curious how many shop on Prime."
It went through the 300 mark like butter.Perhaps a 3 for 1 split is coming and a nice payout?
two back to back green days a rarity here
"this is gonna keep flying, Costco in China a huge success with hopes to add more.....how can you go wrong with Costco"
"AHHHH THE ETERNAL OPTIMISTS !!! Everyone appears to be happy the stock is nearing 300, as it presents another 'great ' opportunity to buy. interesting logic. would imagine if it went to 200 you'd be estactic. let me ask this, you think Mgt is doing a wonderful job ? is there ANYTHING you might suggest they do to improve performance ? I mean, they went crazy over raising employee wages. is there anything you might suggest that they could influence the price of the stock ? say, oh, i don't know, maybe purchase back shares ? stock split ? dividend grant ? is there anything they could do to curtail the selling short that seems to be wrecking havoc on this stock. i mean, thats a 70 point drop in less than 11 weeks ANY SUGGESTIONS ?"
Targets are now all in the400+++
Overpay the workers = increase in ur membership fees
How about a 4 to 1 split so the small guy can buy some shares?
354.77 today. Last time I bought was 352. $355 is also a great deal. In the long run a few dollars would not make a big dif.
Costco is international and whole food is limited to the US plus their prices are ridiculous. Wall street exuberance . Buying opportunity
Dead Stock on a day w a 600 point rise
Costco has crushed the expectations qtr after qtr for the last decade. Anyone who doubts them is not too bright. Every single time I go to Costco they have 15 check out stands with a line of 4-6 full carts at all times....
earning out
Ready for takeoff ?????
Burnnnnnnnnnnnnnn Burnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn SHORTS...................
costco makes most of the money from membership fees. the money i saved at their gas station along already pays the membership. long live costco.
"'Comparable-store sales, excluding the impact of fuel and currency changes, rose 7.5 percent for the first quarter ended Nov. 25, well above analysts' average estimate of 5.8 percent'...this is the best news! Earnings in-line, rev up, but positive comps...the big news!"
"Good ER in bad market, it will not go up for weeks"
Nice volume .....................................shorts better cover................................. or get burned.
drum roll !!!
I bought in at $352..a few months ago. and thought it was coming back around..and now this out of no where.
almost new 52 wk high. its like watching fireworks
I'm anti businesses donating my actions. We were great Costco fans. Out until the mask order is lifted. They make decisions and so do customers. If only 10 percent of customers are liked us they will see serious declines.
"Costco is allowing people in line outside to be one on top of another ! Unlike Trader Joes, they spread out 6 feet apart with lines. Nobody wears a mask inside and out. The Virus is spreading throughout these stores. Just a matter of time the governor mandates a mask for entry or else, you get the boot ! I refuse to shop at any Costco until they regulate this rule."
companies that take care of employee do command respect..
Praying that it opens flat tomorrow so I can load up on puts to ride it to 270 by next Friday
"Costco on line is open for non-essential items, also we can shop online for produce and grocery's Costco best deal on the glove, did I hear they're opening a second Costco in China?Oh oh! I hope they'll do social distancing."
"COST and AAPLjust ""own it"" dont trade it !"
"Normal nervousness before the quarterly report due on 28th.Everyone, including Walmart, Home depot, target, has reported solid numbers.Costco will do even better, a great time to buy a bunch!!"
Still pretty high hopes that COST is going to rise. Anyways the price/sale number looking nice :)https://wallmine.com/screener?d=d&e=NYSE%2CNASDAQ%2CNYSEMKT&o=m&r=v&s=COST%2C
I just bought at the bottom. Why would this even go down?
March sales numbers coming out tomorrow
"the Costco's are so crowded, huge sales numbers and many new folks."
"So... yesterday was too early to call for ""new 52 week high""? A little!"
"Bought more at 296! If it goes lower, I will buy more. No joker can tell me this is not good stock!"
Costco credit/debit machines were down for 30 minutes nationwide at peak time......that will hurt.
Costco sold out of amenities in CA and pharmacies like RAD sale skyrocketing and stocks are down?
Just a blip. Monthly sales were a bit under someone's spread sheet number. The stock has run from 10 to 220. Don't be upset when large holders sell a bit because the dollar amount of their shares has hit their limit. I have trimmed three times for that reason. Lots more gains to come.
"Incredible business, but no retailer is worth 35 times fwd earnings. Those saying 400 by year end will likely have to go through a pullback before COST gets there..."
"COSTCO is an elitist store. Looks at: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/insights/061516/whats-average-costco-consumer-cost.asp They will be the choice for future COSTCO stores (just go to a Walmart and see huge numbers of almost derelict customers). No offense intended! But where will anyone shop and get an electric car charged (not now, but soon). Who do wealthy customers want there kids to see? COSTCO represents the upscale America."
GREAT Growth here.positive for investors.
Healthy pullback !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!nothing has changed here for COST
Costco needs earnings and project to boot in one week. long
sold my 170’s total and all 20contracts for Jan 19/2018 for a profit of 98.70 good year folks.COST is likely to run to 200 by march or april thats my guess and that will happen inn feb if the tax bill passes
I knew it..stock hasn't done nothing for 3 months
why is this stock down
One of the most efficient run companies in the WORLD !!!
The markets should be green today after four days of beating and weekly options expiry. So we could see full swing .
I do not believe COST will go down 5 bucks tomorrow. If it does I will buy more. Sad state of affairs when Americans are to lazy to shop at a local supermarket. I was at Costco this weekend and it was packed. Do you really want someone else buying your food? I have never bought anything from AMZN and never will.
I sold this at 320!right before th pandemic and thought I was a genius a month later. Then I felt like a moron when it hit close to 400. Buying back in too good to pass up.
"It likes to bounce off the 50dma. A bit surprising that this stock keeps destroying previous sales records and then freefalls 4%+, and a divvy to boot."
Is this true that COST doesn't give forward guidance? I'm new to COST and I have never knew anyone else to do this.
when you work there and see all Inside and out you know its going to last
"Stellar Run Continues in March, Sales Up 17.6%370.00""s next stop"
After market close. Here we go! Hopefully we see. 5 percent rise on good news but lately in this market if they guide lower we are gonna be toast.
Costco E commerce up 43% = killing Amazon.
COST is down because people no longer to spend like they have been 4 weeks ago.
this stocks it’s very interesting. If are careful you can consistently easily make 1% per day.
+4.39 today....stagnant? Just not seeing what you’re seeing. I’ll take it
"clobbered? The whole market was clobbered, lol."
"THIS TURKEY IS HEADED FOR THE ""LAST ROUNDUP""...GOOD RIDDANCE!"
Fake news at work...
"ENOUGH WITH THESE HOPEFUL WISHES...'STOCK UP, THANK GOD ITS AT THIS RATE ETC ' OH BROTHER. IF COSTCO HAD MEET EARNINGS"
Can’t hold at 212
I was wrong... I predicted $150 before $170 when it was around $165 a while back. Congrats to those who disagreed with me.
This is going to beat so nicely haha
"one of those days, market has no clue which way to go"
Special DIVI. could be in the cards soon................................................
"Bravo to Costco. Costco allowed members over 60 years of age to enter their stores at 8 AM this morning. Costco pays their employees a living wage, they have the best quality products at the best prices. And today they allowed senior citizens who are most vulnerable to the Coronavirus to shop an hour before the rest of their customers. Costco is a socially responsible company!Bravo Costco!!!"
amazon effect is history. not that it ever made sense
Costco holding up well love shopping there
"I think after AMZN , Costco is a brand company with brand like kirkland ."
What the .....
dividend ex date tomorrow. bullish today and tomorrow.
Waiting to add more under300
"I've been watching COST for a long time, and finally pulled the trigger <$300. Was hoping for $280, but don't know if it'll ever get there. I'm long this! GLTA longing!"
the irony couldn't be funnier....i can't stop laughing.
"Picked this up at 293.79, don't know why but lately this stock is like catching a falling knife."
GREAT COMPANY GLAD I CAN BUY INTO IT SO CHEAP!NO WAY IT SHOULD GO DOWN AS MUCH AS A NASDAQ HI TECH STOCK!GO COSTCO!
CNBC says Costco comp sales are lower than expected. Probably due to people already stocked up.
Great company! Solid results! Loyal customer and stock holder
"The rout is on, finishes under 215"
market up big cost down big
This is outrageous. COST down another $4 after last friday's descent. Is this really warranted? I cannot even see how Whole foods/Amazon competes much with COST?
Costco forever
maybe the dip today because they are getting rid of the photo studio?
there goes the $5 day
took profits 178.00waiting for pull back to get back in.
"Analyst Actions: Telsey Advisory Lifts Costco Wholesale's Price Target to $350 From $330, Keeps Outperform Rating.$350, A no-brainer IMO. $400 analyst action before too long."
Costco packed today
"Peter Lynch:""Stocks aren't lottery tickets. Behind every stock is a company. If the company does well, over time the stocks do well, and vice versa. You have to look at the company—that's what you research.""Sooner or later we'll get there!"
"This ""Amazon Effect"" is so over blown... correct me if I am wrong but they said the same thing about Best Buy a couple years ago.... yet they are near all time highs... This is just the next bs story that the sheep buy into. Do you really think that these multi billion dollar companies are going to disappear in a few years? As many people have eluded below, the lines for Costco are at all time highs, they beat earnings, they have a niche only Sam's club competes with.... and most important the people that shop at Costco are loyal and like that store out of all the other options out there, Amazon is not some god that is going to come in and clean everyone out, eventually the government will limit what sectors and businesses they own to prevent monopolies. Use common sense people, dont be a sheep like how much of this country has become."
Massive drop expected in cost with all the panic buying of stopped
"Beat by $0.29 on earnings even with covid costs of some $200M. If it dips, I'm definitely buying more."
"COST is very undervalued at these levels. I’ve been buying hand over fist. Been doing the same for WMT and TGT. These retailers are not in trouble unlike traditional retailers such as Macy’s and Dillard’s. The first 3 I named have strong customer loyalty, excellent organizational culture, stellar management, etc. The way COST treats their employees is beyond exceptional. For both moral reasons as well as financial ones I am proud to be a COST shareholder."
this will tank 215 today!.... it's done... bear market plus accounting issues... not so good day for COST...
go costco..go....
I am on the Bullish Side for this Earnings Play. Costco getting pumped after earnings. Earnings plays are a Gamble tho we will see
In Costco store today. Very thin shoppers. Mask requirement cutting into business sharply. Gone is any high end shopping as people are buying basics. Still holding some shares after selling most a couple months ago. Deli and 5 dollar chicken is not bringing them in.
Thanks for the301.00 buy order
Still waiting this mass selloff all the bashers promised was coming. This is not a propped up stock. It’s trading at pre covid levels. I hope you all get burned bad. Tbh.
sold out my 500 shares yesterday - buy back when it hits $100
I'm surprised it can't finish green.. I don't think this has been up in over a month
"To me it looks like this share is trading in a sideways 290 USD - 315 USD trading range. I guess it could be nice for peolpe who don't like fluctuation and dividends. I'm neutral on it, I don't hold COST and I think for me to invest in this company there has to be a major discount. - Do your own research -"
highly manipulated stock. sad the stock doesn't go up anywhere even though they make good revenues
Let them bring it lower so we can buy more.
"Finally trading at 300, where it should be. Fundamentals have not changed post virus. Also looking forward to later this week when they announce March sales. The lines were crazy worldwide."
Costco will fare a lot better than most retailers during this virus event.
Costco is not a Boeing stock. up 15 down 10 up 12. Not for day traders. Long Term investment only.
COST is going to $400 by this summer if not sooner. Look at their traffic. Last earnings was impressive even after taking into account the minimum wage hike and etc. we’re in for a surge this year on costco purchases. Be prepared and buy in now!
"Rock solid numbers expected. Seems like it was years ago, not just months, there was chatter about a special dividend this year. Whether luckily, wisely or both, looks like COSTCO Management played it perfectly. Long COST"
perfect timing to take profits and exit. the fundamentals just dont justify the current price level of Costco!
I predict COST will announce a 3 for 1 split which is pushing the stock up this week. Word has slipped out causing inside information buying.
"There were 3 lines from the check-out all the way back to the meat department at Waterfront Costco near Pittsburgh, PA, this morning just after the store opened at 10 AM. The lines moved quickly and I'm guessing they probably broke their one-day record sales at that store. Costco is clearly a top-notch operation with strong demand...plus they have pharmacies on site...adding to their status as an ""essential"" business."
"Taking the fun out of Costco and price to $120 at the same time has a cost. My wife said take it off our list.Our car insurance send a check because of less driving,Get real."
"Funny, Costco doing great U.S. & now in China then analyst HAS to find something negative to say! I just laugh & enjoy my growing shares"
"putting some more money im costco. Feel like market might correct, but not costco. also holding cash is not my favorite thing to do. costco is pretty safe. might drop 10%max."
Cost may turning into good old medonald farm?
Can’t stop this juggernaut. Costco. 4 life
COMPS UP 7% !!! Earnings BEAT. BUY BUY BUY

costco is safe stock best place to buy your food and other consumer goods
COST and AAPLMust own.................... dont trade !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
COSTCO CEO----NEEDS TO GO AHEAD AND PUT OUT THE SPECIAL DIVIDEND SO GET THIS STOCK FLY UP ABOVE $400. HOPE HE IS PLANNING TO DO THIS MONTH OF NOV OR FIRST PART OF DEC TO MAKE THE INVESTORS HAPPY SO THEY CAN BUY MORE SHARES.
dividend payout is in their pockets. (dividend shoppers) and the selling pressure has slowed as expected.

"Im a COSTCO holder. Just a question. If death rates due to COVID spikes next week, will it make the price to drop also?"
COST is better than AMZN. It gets no respect.
Lower margin but higher profit was because of GAS which has lower margin. cost sold a lot of it. As long as profit goes higher then lower margin is ok.
I got in at 389...now its the bottom to load back
"as a costco share holder, I am furious of they silly policies allowing certain items to be return. Recently they let a woman returned a Christmas tree well after Christmas. https://www.yahoo.com/news/man-irate-costco-lets-woman-214209983.html"
Just buy and hold well over 200.00 soon
Costco has shifted from a value stock to growth stock!
Market cap is under annual revenue why is PE ratio so high in comparison to this?? Can anyone explain?
Spend 5 minutes going over blackberry stock and then look at what is selling for. Glta.
"cover your short position, this stock will run up bigly towards earnings release. Costco parking lots are crowded and many happy customers."
COSTCO has been doing some IT upgrades it is just a correction. Chill
$400 by year end.
SO FAR... Week hands loosing to the strong and smart! Recovering from fear selling now.
Does anyone long COST have an exit strategy? If so what? I'm thinking there is a pull back coming with the tariff news. Plus their PE is higher than comps and I'm not seeing much expansion.
Anyone seen Jim Cramer lately? He doesn't look well.
"Costco gives awards for ceo and other on 13 September almost 120 thousands shares as bonus, but on this way they reduced the shares value More shares and 0.00 cost and they can sale it next day It’s some thing wrong with that"
Buying opportunity as it always falls post earnings then recovers in the next few trading days.Congrats to those who added at the $335 range as you will be rewarded.
Good week rsi enters in the green zone macd turns +

"Costco Wholesale CorporationWed., December 2, 2020, 4:15 p.m. ESTISSAQUAH, Wash., Dec. 02, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Costco Wholesale Corporation (“Costco” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: COST) today reported net sales of $15.67 billion for the retail month of November, the four weeks ended November 29, 2020, an increase of 15.1 percent from $13.62 billion last year.For the twelve-week first quarter ended November 22, 2020, the Company reported net sales of $42.35 billion, an increase of 16.9 percent from $36.24 billion last year.For the thirteen weeks ended November 29, 2020, the Company reported net sales of $46.33 billion, an increase of 16.0 percent from $39.95 billion during the similar period last year.look for SILLY dips as great entry here."
Costco Wholesale is down 4.92% to 366.70
Consider Costco as Cloud based subscription model. Stock is way undervalued.
No special dividend this year? Was looking forward to it.
Deep down we all known how sustainable Costco is. Having China in the picture just points to exponential growth.
"This might be the only thing Buffett has got right in the last year, lol. wow, dumping this was smart."
Does anyone think AMZN will buy COST?
i havent lost anything holding costco thru all this covid
Wats cc
went to the store. so many people
"Cramer just now: ""If you are selling Costco today, I'm laughing at you."" He is right on the mark. I love it."
I have been buying Costco shares now for the last 20 years. I am lucky enough to have built up 4700 shares. I will always be long here. Because of Costco retirement is looking more possible
"$300 it's still well above. 1000 x $300 = $300,000. Still strong."
Targets increased 210.0
"Analyst Actions: RBC Capital Lifts Costco Wholesale's Price Target to $381 From $348, Maintains Outperform Rating"
Going green soon
warren buffett sold out costco and amazon the latest news it says. I wonder why he sold costco
"look a the looooooogg lines at Costco, it definitely benefitting from COVID-19."
"Inflation just around the corner, and that will be great for Costco"
"estimate 2.84 eps, came in 3.13 eps"
"If the US has only just started a recession that could last for a year or more, Costco could see a noticeable increase in membership cancellations. Confirmation when the company reports their next quarter earnings & guidance on June 4th."
"I guess since neither 'Funue' (Mr. Death) and 'Bert' cannot explain how they arrived at their 'two' different areas of support, we can all just disregard what they post.Pity, too. I was looking forward to learning from them both!"
Breakout todayBetter cover shorties.......
Big miss on eps and a slight beat on revs! ouch
cost nov sales up 6 percent ....below 293 is good price to buy
Where are the upgrades?
"so I love shopping there, does that make it a buy?"
report is out and basically no change in stock price means huge rally on open tommarrow. 300 in next day or so
Big scam today
"when is this thing going to split? great company that i would to to invest in, but am too poor to buy more than a few shares at this price."
Glad I didn’t buy fedex.
"Yes, COST is good. But statisfically in 5% upper percentile area. No big earnings surprise, and I think extra dividend is later.I recommend selling. I already did!"
Someone tar and feather me for buying ACB at $7 last year when I could have bought COST instead..
COST sales and traffic are way down now. It will take months for people work off the hoard pile.
"KEEP THAT POSITIVE ATTITUDE. NEVER QUESTION MGT AS TO WHY THEY DID WHAT THEY DO. KEEP QUIET AFTER ALL AS SOMEONE NOTED EARLIER...COST is not going to go down forever. It is one of the best run companies in the world and the business model is rockstar material. The stock price will eventually reflect this again. Wall Street doesn't always reward the etc... "" I PERSONALLY LIKE THIS PRICE. 300 AND LOWER IS THE GOAL. TO LOOSE %25 OF ITS VALUE IN LESS THAN 3 MONTHS...WHAT DO YOU THINK ? I THINK WE CAN MAKE IT."
Order in to buy 1st tranche at $295.
costco might be doing everything right so they say...but their stock will never be the same...you saw yesterday..it was up $4.50...and at one time towards the close only up $.29...people were just waiting for s good day to dump this stock
I have repeatedly told shorts that this isn't the time. I warned you that it was consolidating but ready to explode upwards again to $270. You better cover shorty.
"Did a lot of reading about Costco, sounds like a solid company. I personally buy 90% of my stuff at Costco."
down from here. to 113 ha...........................
If they open more stores in China it will zoom.
Why hasn't it moved. The earnings were incredible?
Continue buying on ANY DIPS here........................................
Why is Costco always trending during the weekend?
such easy money. no other stocks like this one easily make you money
Talks about divi increase .
COST and AAPL just hold it ..dont trade it !jmho
cosco rocking $$
Why isn't this down more?
"this is all computer trading,,,,no reason for the value anymore"
How you gonna even let this go under 345?????? lmfao let me guess tesla back to 500 first though.
Markets will TANK with Biden.
buffet sold costco but where is the $$$ going?
Strong Buy https://cweb.com/competition-is-heating-up-between-costco-walmart-and-target-cweb-com/
Finally some real movement since the China news.
Who cares about EPS beat during covid times honestly XD I don't get investors*Traders*
"When you compare BJ’s earnings with Costco’s, it becomes clear that Costco has hit a limit. Bj’s has seen exponential growth that is not yet reflected in their stock price. With a P/E of 14, revenue of $15 billion on the 2020 fiscal year, yet a $5 billion market cap, its evident that Bj’s is a better buy. Costco has more market share, yes, but you can’t expect significant gains from a company that doesn’t have rapid growth in their future when compared to their competitors. BJ’s growth rate in both earnings and revenue is significant and yet that is not reflected in their current valuation. They posted earnings today too, they beat, and marked significant growth q/q and y/y."
Costco will never see one hundreds again after earnings
I like the idea that it has pulled back prior to earnings.
You all wonder why Costco shares are not recovering? It is the chicken s**t traders that react to any rumor be it real or false. It has nothing to do with the company itself. Costco is a very solid company--stay for the long haul you won't be disappointed.
"Like I said, support is at 189, I’ll keep buying puts till then"
Why COST keeps falling after earnings? It’s dropped 10 dollars plus since. Does this ever going to turn around? Why keep on shorting this?
this stock is about to get annihilated tomorrow. i expect at least 10-20 point drop tomorrow after earnings.
"It's interesting Wells came out with this ""downgrade"" yesterday. It was the dividend pay date. So maybe they and their customers own COST, and with the DRIP, this was a way to buy those shares at a 2+% discount. With a price target of $235, they didn't want to drag it that far down. It could easily recover back into the 240s."
SHORTS gonna get BURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRNED !!!!!
"amazing and consistent stock. Yet, I feel that its value has ballooned a little bit too much. Last year's 3rd quarter was where COST experienced a earnings miss and I feel the same here. That being said, although I would rate shares a hold short term I see this as a great long term growth company. It's a genius business model starting especially paying employees higher wages to experience very low turnover. This combined with future growth in the recent Chinese market makes it a truly unique growth stock."
"YOU THINK THE MISS ON EARNINGS WAS DUE SOLEY TO...'INCREASED PANDEMIC COSTS ?"" REALLY ? THATS WHAT A VIEWER SAID..Costco beat expectations on revenues. They missed expectations on earnings due to unusual increased pandemic costs, but still had better earnings than the year prior. This is a positive earnings report! THIS IS A POSITIVE REPORT. INCREASED EARNINGS. HMMM AND DREADFUL EARNINGS. WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ? IS IT ALL ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE VIRUS ? REALLY ? AND WHAT CAN THEY DO IN THE FUTURE TO FIX THIS ? SALARY COSTS ARE STILL GOING FORWARD. I THINK CHANGE IN MANAGEMENT WOULD BE A GREAT SUGGESTION. HOW ABOUT SKIPPING ANY BONUSES ? BUY BACK STOCK, ANNOUNCE EFFORT TO FIGHT SHORT SELLERS BY HAVING SUPPORT FOR STOCK. STOCK SPLIT WOULD BE NICE. ETC."
"I have been wondering if this or target is a better buy, does anyone have thoughts on this? Thanks."
biggest problem with this company is having enough cashiers and parking for the daily onslaught of happy shoppers.I love shopping there as much as I love the stock. win win.
Bought Costco stocks @151 yesterday. I love this company. My family and I always buy foods and gas here. We save money. We also get double cash back from our membership and Citi card. I should've invested in this company when the stock was only $39 nine years ago
All that government stimulus money is going to Costco.
"Incremental wage expenses! they had to retain employees and they had to sanitize due to Covid in my opinion they still smashed it, anything else would have died by now"
Sales numbers are good up 5.6% from last year
The best company in the world. All other businesses have a lot to learn from them.
"Amazon gives a new location for returned and people go crazy happy! What you as an investor should know is amazon doesn't tell you how many billions are returned a year. , obviously it's not a good thing for any company to have returned . . Some investors are playing with emotions and not logic."
Bought more at 288.89
Costco needs to change the air flow in each building pull the air up not blow it down. This would put filtered air where people are and filter the air around them. It would be good PR also.
400 by January 2021
Target is now 278.00
Up 101.9 % e-commerce business in August basically doubled from last year
The hangover of WholeFoods/Amazon is wearing off. We were $180 before and are well on our way back there. Same great company Costco has always been and will continue to be. Hard to find a 10% gain positive outlook elsewhere.
Don't forget the employee 401k most buy Costco sto k each pay period.

LOVE SEEING MY DZSI AND COST RUNNING
Sounds like 3 foreign stores on the agenda! Sales increased by 25% in Canada and even more internationally.
Lots of BIG BOYS buying today
did we beat earnings ?
"so let's just imagine the rumors come true, and amazon buys Costco...what happens to the costco shareholders?"
how’s this gonna do tomorrow?
cost stock must be tired running up all day
Cramer knew something.
WHY SO FLAT THEY BEAT ON EARNINGS
Look for the SILLY dips as anotherBUY opportunity!nothing has changed with COST.
"Shopping patterns - buy only what you need, no compulsive or luxury buying. I have been to Costco - somewhat busy at 8am, then tappers off to very little if any traffic from 11am onward."
Saw a guy freak and I mean freak out today because they now require membership cards to use the food court. He was LIVID. Go Costco.
"Keep bashing. Bloodbath market day. Earnings out, missed eps. Yet no major sellof#$%$rself why is that."
People will regret why they sold Costco rn in just about 7hrs...
THERE IS A REASON WHY THIS STOCK NEVER GETS SOLD OFF
"Walmart, Amazon and now Target have one thing in common...they all have introduced hydrogen fuel cell technology to improve supply chain and warehousing effeciency... Costco in comparison is left behind and has lot of catch up to do here... hopefully sooner then later before Costco starts to look too old school ..."
ff
"You people bemoaning the 16/hour wages are idiots. You #$%$ if the government mandates a minimum wage because ?socialism,? and then you #$%$ if a company does it of their own accord.Guess what? Costco decided to invest in their employees, just like they?ve already been doing. It?s paid off in terms of a workforce that feels valued. And Costco customers keep renewing and loading flatbed carts with hundreds of dollars every trip.Let me know when you run a company that has people waiting for hours to find a parking spot the moment you open a location in China. ?"
I think Larry finally truly blacked out. Or shot himself. We will see if he comes back...
Looks like Cramer was wrong about Costco earnings. People cared. LOL
"You get to collect a nice dividend along the way, in the eighties we used to sell stocks when the PE got to 20, that was an expensive stock! As Warren Buffet says, ""the stock market will always transfer money from the impatient to the patient"""
"Funny..... Some of these posts are ludicrous and I find myself chuckling.I mentioned earlier today that COST was most likely going to bounce off the 50. Came real close. In fact close enough. Each time its bounced off the 50 over the last few months, it has made new highs. Nothing has changed. COST check out lines are long. People are spending $hundreds each sale. Parking spot is ridiculous to find when I go there. Nothing has changed. In fact, more sales month over month and year over year with new stores opening every quarter. The narrative is still extraordinarily bullish. And not just because of pandemic. The outbreak only gave a tail wind to the business model. Thats why we received SP divvy. China hasn't even begun to be exploited as well as the rest of Asia. The U.S. Hasn't even reached 1/3 of projected stores!!! People people people. This stock is almost as sure as the sun coming up each day. Dip on the monthly numbers, dip on the quarterly numbers, new highs following with days to 2 weeks. Rinse and repeat.I personally bought options down here today. I will sleep just fine. Jan strike and 2022 strike. Yeah, I'll be just fine."
$150's soon....
Next stop380.00-400.00
"I wonder if the membership fee is $60 in Yuan at 110,000 members in the first week. Having lived in China for a short time, I know the Chinese like concept of being members of a club. It connotes exclusivity similar to buying high end designer products. They need to put a store in the major coastal cities and Hong Kong. I would be interested to know the types of items they sell in China as opposed to the U.S. I suspect it is similar to the ones in Taiwan that I visited. Costco in Taiwan is quite popular as well. Go Costco!!!"
"just looking at premarket, it's another good time to buy"

"Pretty steady for such a horrible miss. They are waiting for conference call. If CAT can go for the same price of 8 months ago even though they have 20% less revenue and 40% less profits with o guideline, Costco may be able to be green tomorrow if the CEO uses the magic words. In this market where people pay 2019 for 2013 revenue all you have to say are the words reopening and vaccine. That's it. The CEO needs to say we are seeing great numbers with the reopening and that the vaccine will take them to the moon."
Shorts and their fake news! The preliminary financials look terrific. Maintaining growth extremely well! Can't wait for the CC at 2pm pacific

$COST Deutsche Bank raises Costco target on strong saleswww.stocktargetadvisor.com/blog/deutsche-bank-raised-costcoscostnsd-target-on-strong-december-sales/
Costco's drop is linked to the friction with China and the political posturing associated with that. That will be resolved in short order and this stock will rebound above the 20ma of 344.70 and then up to the pt's that were announced recently.
"60K shares at a $cost avg of $1.52... If I pick up another 15K at $1.25, then avg drops to $1.47. 75K is probably the max shares i'm looking to own. I feel pretty confident in that position..."
"People, do not expect a surge in the markets any time soon. If you do, you're only fooling yourself. If you want to be 'smart', really smart, you will use this time to increase your position in this particular company. Right now, dollar-cost-averaging is king. You will be glad you did because eventually, normalcy will return... just not any time soon.Be smart."

This bad boy is about to soar.
"tomorrow, let's hope we start climbing back up"
"cost needs to just quit announcing monthly sales, if you know anything about costco sales and earnings, they are always great numbers..but never good enough for wall st."
"I purchase huge at Amazon, and had not been at costco lately. But just went to costco 5 times in the last two months. Really enjoyed the experience of loading up on chocolate almonds, organic produce, wild smoked salmon, the best socks you can buy, the best authentic kirkland brand true organic olive oil better than whole foods brand. I also bought a cal king mattress that I love and they helped me load it in the store and in the parking lot. Amazon biggest problem is the shipping, and Costco does not have that problem. I am long Costco."

Definitive a BUY before earnings today. Plus Special Dividend coming soon!
COST is rocketing higher in pre-market to 181. If it had Amazon's P/E ratio it would be selling for over $1500 per share.
COSTCO Membership continues to grow well over expectations !thats what really matters.
Uh here and now ...if any dips it’s just temporary.......
why did this thing flop around today?
"If you don't buy then hold for huge gain after ER, blowing ER coming."
"Costco is a great place to shop, such bargins and above average clientele that make the experience even better. Sample days are the best too, they don't scrimp like Sams club giving a cracker or nuts out. Costco is the best value and offers the best products to customers and they are always willing to make the customer happy."
Will be green by 10 PM ET.

Costco making a ton of money320 by thursday
"Bottom line is pe is too high, FOR THE FUNDS, and they are trimming positions. Until they are done, then the stock is dead money. I like COST, but my love just cost me 10k"
"You know why it's going back up? Because I sold and cut my loses. Always happens like this. I should have read the charts and kept emotions out of it. Sucks...This was my first loss in 2 weeks of trade -_-. Stings quite bit. It just shows you no matter how long you've been trading, you can still panic."
"First of all, a split? Why.Second, seems like over reaction to 1 store opening in Shanghai . How many China stores does Costco plan to open there? I’m a buyer back at $160, but it took them over 5 years to open a planned store here just north of Charlotte."
Simply shows the intellect of trading in the current market place these days. With such crisp ER and a stock which mostly has average Vol and solid trading should not be falling this much AH. This is a sign of newbies investing with stimulus money and don’t know where to be at what time.Shameful and disrespectful to the stock this..
BUYING LOADING UP AFTERHOURS
Cramer today said today hold wal mart over Costco. He’s a dope.
one of the only green stocks today you know this means they smash earnings
"I use technical analysis as a complement to fundamental but since June this is a classic higher lows, higher highs recovery. I bought at 151 after this Amazon #$%$, glad I did. Looking at the chart over the last couple years, their is a great trading opportunity based on the chart, take a look"
COST rated asSTRONG BUY here.
How about special dividend in Costco cash??? If you like it give me a thumbs up
"This stock will set all time highs after earnings,its the Holiday season that will push it up."
"let me tell you one case where i find very impressive. long term buyer and long term stock holder.rarely shop in supermarkets anymore .one time i had a problem with a food item (i leave that one out to be generic because i suspect they will know who i am). i find the quality in the bag of these things not consistent. even took pics to show them. the store folks give me the expected usual reception. not happy about it. asked for manager, not happy about the way it went. called corporate, got in contact with a group that deals with this item specifically. they listened extremely carefully and within one week a team of 2 flew into another city where the food was harvested and processed. they end up learning more about the process and came away better educated. they followed up with me on their findings. all in all, i am very impressed that the corp folks really take pride in their work and sourcing. Don't get me wrong, the local store guys are very pro all the time already. awesome american success story, like amzn, like apple, ummm, help me out guys lol"
it's taking too look to see the magic number 360.buy puts and sleep well.
"$310 - $312 would make Cost 20% off it's highs. 20% would be considered a bear market. In terms of a "" bear "" term....Costco is far far from being in bear scenario. I've said it before. Highly doubt Cost will dip 20% or more. Doubt it evens reaches $310. It's close to bottom and the sling shot up will be Swift."
Debt to Tangible Worth of 2:1. Solid cash position All customers love Costco. Always busy with large dollar checkouts. Bought a logistics company last year. Online sales improving. Buymore with next downtick?
Plenty of growth yet internationally
I will hold. It's a great time to buy more.

Opening green tomorrow...
Low Volume = manipulation in price.look for DIPS as another opportunity here.
"I get tired of these analysts thinking they're smarter than the market and data.

Nice drop.
We are at April 2020 level !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!way OVERSOLD.................................save dry powder.............................................
This will be $230 by Friday open
why does this keep.going down??
"What is the percentage of Costco members that has Executive membership?Since we know Costco makes money on collecting membership fees and it has two type of memberships. The regular Gold Star cost $60.00, the Executive cost $120.00. The Executive membership fee is twice the Gold membership fee. There are reports of how many Costco memberships and the fee is always listed as $60.00. However, this could be underestimating the fees collected. I searched and could not find the percentages of Executive membership against the Gold Star membership. I have the Executive membership. Just for curiosity's sake, I would like to do a survey on this board. If you are a Costco member, which type of membership do you have?"
"There has been buying back into this name over the past several weeks. I fully believe the implications of rising rates, such as possible wage inflation, cost of goods sold when it comes to food, etc. have all been priced in now. Food prices have skyrocketed and the cost of inventory has no doubt eaten into COST's margins. But I think the inflation prospects are baked into the shares now and that investors have been rotating back in. Is it completely baked in? Hard to say, but I think the storm has largely passed for names like COST, WMT, and other grocers. COST and WMT are both oversold still at these levels and that is confirmed by the relative strength index. I expect COST to climb back towards 400 from here."
There's a rumour about a stock split. What do you guys think?
GREEN SOON GREEN !!!!
up up and away..................BUY while its cheap ! way undervalued......................
Nice rebound!!
Speaking of @RealDopey and his $3.14 Sunday brunch with wifey...I have $COST in my 401k going back to 2002.. somewhere around $30 that year...They crushed earnings!!
"I am just baffled by some of the posts. Quite a few complimented Costco stock does not move or hardly moved. However, does anyone read that Costco stock has a Beta (5Y Monthly) of 0.92? The Beta is lower than the average. It is supposed to be stable. Costco has held up well despite that the DOW30 jumping up and down. Being long on Costco stock means you hold on to the stock preferably more than one year. This way, you would not be hit by short term gain. Almost 72% of the stocks are held by institutions. It is even held by Berkshire Hathaway. If you are looking for a quick gain, look somewhere else. Look for a high Beta Stock not Costco."
Thanks for 167.30told u its a BBBBUUUUUUYYYYYYYYYYYYAMAZON trying OLD tricks again ...............................simply not working for COST.
"as bad as everyone is making this out to be..I personally think costco did pretty goid, wall st. expectations are unreal, and costco beat on everything"
"Doubters, Doubt.....Costco is strong"
one of my favourite corporations. Costco never lets you down- in store or in the markets.
A beacon of green in a sea of red today.Go Costco!
tomorrow will touch 300 plus
just watch what this stock does when COST announces their special dividend and/or stock buy back based on money saved via tax reform!!! go baby go!
with incredible earnings why did it go down
"I am a business Costco member over 30 years. I just don't understand why a wholesale club has a limited buying items? It is a wholesale, not a retailer. Limited 2 per customers!!?? It is a joke! And they really needs to improve employees' attitude, we are customers, please be polite. I pay over $100 membership a year and spend a lot of money every year in the club."
"Hey Costco, I see yahoo finance/Verizon, has given people 4 reasons not to renew their Costco membership.I believe its a planted story, esp given that earnings is out in about a month.WHy not let them know you feel about being targeted, and maybe suggest to your fellow wholesalers to drop their relationship with Verizon, and look for a telecom supplier that isn't doing hatchet jobs on companies, and isn't tryin to undo the tax cuts, and march to the agenda."

SPLIT
COST is one of the weatherproof stock (pandemic or no pandemic) and it will reflect in its earnings
Online digital sales grew by 99%! I will take Costco anyway heading into a 2nd wave of COVID-19. Q4 and next Q1 will be huge ! BUY the dip!!
"After the initial rush to Costco...eventually people are stopping to going in to Costco stores....Costco will loose more and more business to Amazon and Walmart due to these two giants having better online , warehousing and distribution centers...this is the toughest time for Costco and not going in to online strategy and improving distribution centers and supply chain with too much focus on retail stores will cost now...i can;t see Costco coming out without a scar from this..I had warned this few months back and was trashed on this board..."
NEW REPORTS INDICATE CUSTOMER LOYALTY IS 102% THAT MEANS SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY PAY TWICE FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING MEMBERS. REVENUE WAS 14 BILLION LAST QUARTER BUT THEY EXPECT TO TOP 108 BILLION NEXT MONTH WHEN THE ILLEGALS FLOOD THE COUNTRY. SHOPPING AT COSTCO IS SUCH A JOY. I'M TAKING MY VACATION AND SPENDING IT THERE IN THE PARKING LOT BECAUSE ITS SUCH A GREAT EXPERIENCE. EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION IS 108 % THAT MEANS THEY'LL NEEVR LEAVE AND HAVE IT IN THE WILL TO BE BURIED IN AISLE 6 NEXT TO TIRES AND DELI SECTION. YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE TAG ON THIS. THATS WHY THE STOCK IS DROPPING. NO ONE ELSE CAN EITHER.
"Fly like an eagle, up, up to the sky."
"Up 15 straight days tomorrow....NOPE!! Though, maybe COST can go up EVERY DAY IN JUNE (LOL)!! In 25 years of trading I do not recall a stock going this parabolic for this long.......gravity WILL take hold....and with NO TRADE deal next week....that should do it!!!!!!!"
Love to say Costco the only up and up today but this too is a dream that will pull back a little hopefully not too much
look for dips as BUY opp.
"Big guys and short sellers are playing the market, then they will jump in when it's low enough for them and start pumping up the price."
Can anyone foresee this going past 350?
Looking to add to my current (small) position; best to wait or buy now? My first and only purchase was back in 2018. :)
"Costco just happens to be in a bleeding market. Regardless of how well it is doing on sales, the effect of heavy selling throughout the market will temporarily overwhelm the amount of sales."
Looking forward to $250 by the end of the year
"If it can pass $344 today. It’s safe to say that it can only rise up from there. Good rating and upgrade. It can’t hurt the share price that much. I am surprised with good market today, it hasn’t turn Green yet."
stock market up nicely today..disgraceful stimulus checks on the way...and costco sinking again...
Nice drop. ha hah a ha aah
Down over 15% YTD 21.Trading lower post market but should work itself up when trading starts tomorrow.
This stock is so easy to make money
"today, it would be nice to have one of them $20 spikes"
"Why I hold cost? Simple, just because it is the company who want to share their profit with their shareholders. So I invest in it, not speculate."
"As the old saying goes, once you discover Costco - you don't shop anywhere else!!!Just look at the lines... Coscot is 340 under 6 months!!"
"pandemic is finished, COST is finished- everybody is cancelling their membership, - the only way they make $"
I guess next week 100$
COST continues to EXPAND !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Up $70 a share in just 6 weeks lol. Unbelievable.
This is a great price for Costco! Finally it is below 350. I am buying more shares! Market can’t be always up. It should crush but it is not time yet!

TRUMP made global slowdown..............................RECESSION next
"What I find most interesting is the ignorance from many people about having to ""pay"" for a membership to shop at Costco, and how they simply refuse to do so. Well, I would like to inform all of these ignorant people that between my Executive membership and using my Citi Visa card, Costco and Citi combined have been paying me anywhere from $500 to $1000 each year with rebate checks. They pay me to shop. I use my Citi Visa for purchases that i have the money for. Gas is a 4% rebate at Costco gas or any major gas station and 2% rebate on Costco purchases. The Citi card has other perks as well 3% on travel and eating out, 1% on everything else and also extends warranties on T.V. 'S and other electronics. I pay my cars off each month because my monthly shopping is part of my budget. THIS IS A NO-BRAINER WAY TO SHOP AND SAVE !!!!"
c mon costco let's gave a big up day
"got some at 310. good, bad or neutral?"
I read that some people think Costco will go below $300. lol...not gonna happen. We're touching the final bottom and this selling is an eye blink away from reversing upward.
"I wonder if I am the only one who does not care for a special dividend. I rather the company uses the dividend to repurchase the stock. For tax purposes, a dividend is taxed as ordinary income. As long as I held on to the stock over a year, all the gains are taxed at long term gain. Unless the stock is being held in an IRA or 401K, there is tax consequence receiving dividend. If one is a long, would you rather get some of your money back and pay tax now or rather have the stock appreciates and take the gain when you sell later. Opinions are welcome!"
So today is too late for the dividend ??
Costco has been selling off because the billionaires are going to step in whrn the 4th of March happens then 400 will HAPPEN!
Hey shorts - It must be tough to be you right now. But if you think COST will get a one day haircut like NFLX got today FORGET ABOUT IT.
"Watch Cost go up next week as investors pile in ahead of earnings. I say $290 area before earnings, $300 or higher after, don't forget that special divvy is still on the table"
"So, let me get this straight...Costco makes a ton of money compared to the year prior, misses the outsiders estimate by one penny and is now down by $15? This is absolute insanity."
Shorts might cover after hours
report decent but 'investors' are selling. Why? Because with the AMAZON effect people realize this stock is just too expensive. The market is changing and those in this stock will NOT see the appreciation going forward vs. the past. With margins weak at best this stock will have pricing pressure. There are just other retail companies to explore with reasonable pe's and expectations.
going under 200.00 by earnings date...............................selllllllllllllllllllllllbuy back later............................
"Hi fellow Costco investors,I am a mid-20’s investor looking for solid companies to invest in for 5-10 years. How do you all feel about Costco’s growth prospects? Does it still have enough untapped growth/market share to justify holding long? Or has its incredible run probably already included it’s best days?I’d appreciate your thoughts.Thank you!"
"costco needs to drop 75 points,,,the PE is too high looking forward"
picked up 25 more shares before the close today
Rising fast. $350 by next Fri.
Net income grew 22%
AH manipulation!...the stock should go up tomorrow!
What does COST have to do with TRUMP tariffs ??????NOTHING absolutely nothing.................................
Costco
a lot of talk about a special dividend that will never happen but if it did..coctco should award it to the people that didn't sell st earniings
"No position....so envious of the (regular!) special dividends that Costco gives! Congrats, longs!"
I heard that COST makes most of there money from memberships. Can anyone give me some color on that???
"Anyday in next few days Cost will post monthly sales, woo hoo! look out it's going to flip some lids and hope to hit new highs as the numbers will be huge yr. over yr. for last month. This will continue for many months & quaters""I LOVE MY COSTCO SHARES"""
Needs a haircut of 10-20%....to justify the valuation.
"Today is a good example how Costco does it's own thing, the Nasdaq has leveled off while Costco keeps going higher. Love it. Might be time for you few wieners to just get off here then to worry daily."
Tomorrow’s the special day. Are we going to see a special divi?
cant wait to buy more
COST alwaysBOUNCES BACK in a hurry................................
A grocery store with 42 PE ? What in the world is going on?
back to new highs soon.
Buyer of the dips...........................................COST almost always rebounds !
"With earnings this Thur, it blows through 200."
I think the retail market panicked because of the large drop resulting from the dividend. We'll see a lift soon. Probably tomorrow.
"Costco shoppers like myself, are a totally different breed of shopper than WFM shoppers. This merger will not hurt Costco at all in the long run. As for the stock, I bought in bulk on Thursday, and expect it to rise after all the fuss dies down. Nothing to see here..."
target is 230.00+++ boys...........................
BUY the dips................................
Green again at days end? Buy in the morning sell at 3:45 or so just like Home Depot. Free Money
There have been shares shorted LOL. must be some covering for sure with continued great numbers coming out from Costco.
Ughhhh what a bad day. Gonna go get my taint waxed and see if I can convince the girl to give me a happy ending.
"Costco shares currently @ Costco discount pricing... Get them quick, Time Limited Offer!"
This stock will become a safe haven for many investors in light of trade wars. Give it another week and watch it go up....
#WINNING
"Today prove what I said. BJ and Costco need to improve their service. Treat customers in good attitude. Employees are not care about customers. You buy or not buy, they will not get fire!!"
This one crushed earnings. We should see a 52 week high tomorrow. Strong growth opportunities remain with this one domestically and abroad. Would be nice to see a dividend increase.
"@ Ben, totally agree, last time at Costco spent $300 - just the average these days"
They killed it while everyone else is dead in the water
Their sales report is good. It will bounce back. This stock has done nothing but climb since inception. Not like some Nasdaq stocks but climb just the same.
COST special DIVI next ????????
"thesedays, strong earnings are not good enough.. and i swear i can make any stock go down. :)"
will we see $500 this week or $300 first?
Did anyone complaining on this board actually consider the SP had the good news already priced in? Great stock and company but SP has to be reflective of the business or it's just another Robinhood day traded stock going nowhere or shorted to death. Be happy for the growth and stop whining!
215 tomorrow
Come on SHORTS...................better cover soon............... told you the bounce back really hurts.....................
HD just went down hard.. HD PE of 22.. COSTCO pe of 25 still.

I strongly think that costcos stock prices will rise within this month i made an overview on costco this is my absolute favorite stock also favorite place to purchase goods in bulk at serious discount prices https://prwirepro.com/costco-cost-stock-price-overview-market-data-review/
Will drop before earnings. I am not touching this above 300
"How does the special 10USD dividend work? If I bought 100 shares cost yesterday, do I got paid 1000USD on Dec 10?"
Due to the coronavirus we shop at Costco about every 3-4 weeks. Last trip my wife and I each filled a cart with foot and toilet paper. Nothing extra. $821 worth. Have never spent anything like that before. If that's not bullish I don't know what is.Bob
"The sell-off of Costco is accelerating.......not a good sign at all. Brokerages will be out with downgrades in a few days, which will push Costco to at least $155 per share....Do the right thing, you do not want to have a sleepless weekend."
"costco probably isnt as busy as normal but at least they are making some revenue. maintaining, I cant say the same for other businesses"
Amazon is turning workers into mindless data /AI driven minions Amazon is screwing the Planet big time by shipping millions of boxes with packing material.Costco is much better for workers and good humanity. Low prices and convenience is not everything.
Targets raised !!!!!!!210.00
"I think after AMZN , COST is a brand and experience company."
"Hey, Hair Lip! How's that Hair Cut treating ya? Dont worry peach fuzz, it wont drop much, but it will breathe a bit. Enjoy the run to $400 by EOY."
Speacial dividend 
"Hey Grimmikins, here's a ShopRite slogan from way back that certainly applies to you in your capacity as your Mom's grown-up, live-in parasite.""Hey, Mom, what’s for dinner? ShopRite has the answer! (1970s - 1980s)""When you gonna cover that $113 short? Don't tell me it was just another whopper in a long line of whoppers? Is your $113 short of COST along the same line as your yacht in the south of France?Sailor-suited, fibbin, Joey-fascinated sissy..............."
up and away for the close.
"Grimmikins, you're only down $37 per share on your short at $113.Tell me, exactly how much imaginary money did you lose on that big 'ol whopper?Tell me again which port your yacht is in over there in the south of France. Its draught, its beam, power plants, crew size, etc.Methinks you're merely the Captain of the SS Rubber Duck in your Mom's bathtub.Sailor-suited, fibbin', Mommy-moochin' sissy....................."
"so much for those ""so call"" analyst.. what are they really analyzing?! Look beyond the numbers!!"
"RBC Boosts Price Target on Costco Wholesale to $414 From $399, Citing Strong April Sales, Maintains Outperform Rating"
Why is this dropping so bad?
"One of the only one open , and making money and it’s not moving up much? I don’t get it ."
were getting crushed again today
just went to Costco's - cant find a spot to park and waited 20 minutes to checkout ; every register was going full tilt ; seems like a no brainer to me!
its another ws ploy to pick up shares and test high's at eoy sales. Costco going to $240 again
Received my dividend statement in the mail today from Morgan Stanley
"I think I'm on the verge of selling out this stock is stuck in reverse..it had a couple nice days, but doesn't make up for the horrible ones...the dividend id good but thats about it. I can get that at wmt too"
This virus goes to show that people are generally irrational and basically scared little rabbits.
along with COST I'm looking into WM if they dip
I have a feeling it’s going to miss on earnings
"Walmart is already off 15% from its 52-week high, Target is 26% off, Amazon is 19% off while Costco is only 7.5 % off. Costco needs to drop to $210 to get closer to those three. It's doable, market is bloody tomorrow."
"This stock may be a winner, but I have leaned to really dislike going to Costco. Still no paper or cleaning items."
International markets are waiting on Costco.
My local Costco was packed yesterday
Last quarter dropped $5 after hours only to be $5 higher next day
Costco Wholesale reached an all time high at 328.52
green green market costco continues to fall...1 nice day thats it
wait till Costco opens up it's first location in China later this year
"Hey balls, 310 is coming. Soon. Maybe today. Get ready to push that sell button"
Will earnings be before or after market on Thursday?
Train is leaving soon....................................BUUUUUUUUUYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Surprised that there hasn't been a bigger gain since earnings beat.
"COST management has done a great job keeping the experience and brand and offerings at very high levels. This is a reliable company with a focused and strong management. Regarding e-commerce: I think that fast, inexpensive or free delivery are critical. If COST can connect with—get the message to— consumers in this regard, the e-commerce business will jump!!!! The confidence and trust in the company already exist; what’s needed is that delivery, returns, etc with the -commerce business is just as fast, easy and inexpensive as amazon."

"Watch.. Stock is going to go up days before earnings, they'll have a good earnings report and everyone's going to sell right after... At least that's what I'm thinking, then I'll load up... I've been burned too many times buying before a earnings call."
I feel lucky I sold this stock yesterday
"Myself, and a few people I know.... tried to buy several items at Costco yesterday. basics, milk, bread, cheese, veggies, fruit, I also needed bottled water as i am out of it, and paper towels and toilet paper. First of all, there was NO paper goods available and NO bottled water available. Why? As was reported elsewhere as well as a store employee, people panicked and bought it all OUT with unlimited purchases. leaving many people unable to get what they needed, even like me, just enough for my household near term. Of course, Costco wants to have HIGH sales volume. But as I was able to get most everything else I needed, I proceeded to the cashiers and this was about 2pm Monday. The lines were insame, it was a panic atmosphere, some lady was actually bragging that she got the last 5 cases of bottled water. I felt like teaching her a lesson but I kept my cool. However, I wasn't about to WAIT an hour to get through the line (Henderson NV) and I was so irate about it all that I just left my cart right there, walked away. FGas station was also like it was the end of the world. So, i went to WALMART. They had EVERYTHING I needed, thanks Walmart. Makes me think twice about remaining a member. What should Costco have done when people are hoarding? LIMIT purchases....there will be plenty of customers to share the products. But NO, they are not smart enough to make such a wise and fair decision. Boo hiss on Costco."
160 tomorrow.
up up and away.......................................300 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++
COST reached a new All Time High at 216.32
"Costco options imply 7.5% move in share price post-earnings (TheFlyOnTheWall) Hmmm, that would be $340, can the fly be trusted?THE FLY 2:49 PM"
Shareholders are increasingly questioning the corporations management. Time for a change at the top.
"Shares will remain relatively static until November sales are reported and whether sales growth and net earnings exceeds expectations, is in line with expectations or fails to meet analysts expectations. Any thing else is pure speculation."
"Next week is the er due. I expect at least 15 increase on stock price. Right now ytd is -11%, I won't expect it recover, but 5% is possible."
Those employees getting $2.00 extra/hr kept yours and my family supplied with food and yes toilet paper when they could have stayed home an collected unemployment making more money! You should thank everyone of them daily!
"this should be up huge in after hours, nothing but good in the report"
"The bigger story is that they grew revenue DURING the pandemic AND paid workers more money. Still a higher EPS year over year. An EPS by a suit means little if they don't hit it. Higher sales, higher revenue is what counts. IMO"
earning before or after guys?
BJ stock jumped 37 percent in May. Let's see COST jump 37 percent in June.
Mostly trading inline with others in the sector. Short it or dump it but..... 'show us'.
Thanks for357.00 again !
280-285.00wait.....................to add
This stock was the best performing stock to the worst performing stock in my portfolio.
"I am getting frustrated with COST which I had bought for $303 back in March 2020 and the stock is now only $307. This appears to be a great company with lackluster stock. Next time COST hits $310, I will likely sale and put my money in stocks with more upside potential."
"Costco in south East Pa was very normal today,shelves fully stocked except for toilet paper. Seems they are meeting demand so far. Expect our schools will close soon,possibly millions of lunches will be served at home for the foreseeable future."
where are you getting all these info?
2% cash back on Executive Membership just about pays for itself for us
Got back in at $310.XX
Amazon p/E 83. Debt 68 BILLION. No dividend. who is buying this stock. Costco p/e 34. debt 6b.
Wall street head hunting retail. COST is now on radar for a scalping. This is a bear market and all stocks get mauled. COST will be taken under $200. Going to buy back in then.
back when the pandemic hit i panicked and sold a bunch of great stocks i owned...I sold 2000 shares of DE..only to buy 1000 shares of cost...look at DE it has doubled..Cost..has stayed stagnate...my biggest stock market blunder
"a few months ago when costco was doing good I remember a guy buying in at $321...and then the stock started to tank..he was worried about getting his money back....I told him not to worry, he would have gains in no time...that poor guy may never get his money back"
"China-based website Shanghaiist reports that Costco has already met its goal of 100,000 memberships in China"
"The greenhouse industry is hot and fresh produce keeps increasing in demand. I’ve been adding to my $GRF position, Greenrise Foods and $APPH. They own almost 100 acres of greenhouses in Leamington. They bought all of Mastronardi Produce (Sunset Brand) greenhouses as well as another 30 acres last month. They have Major distribution channels like $WMT & $KR $COST .Their peers are trading around $30 while this stock is still at ground level. Time to load up!"
"189 is the next support, if we break that then 160. I think we will be trading around 190 by the end if week"
BIG BOYS are almost done loading...................................
Nothing but Bernstein helping weekly Options Mafia for this Friday.
Why COSTCo went down in the first place defies logic. The markets are not perfect. Can't even get into the parking lot in Boca Raton. Can only mean an increase in sales. Market duhhhh. Stock should be back at 325 + yesterday
"Yahoo has Costco Earnings Date on Dec 12, 2019?Didn't COST reported its quarterly earnings last month?"
When will this year's special divined payout?
When do they declare the special dividend ?
"Unless you are a very experienced equities trader (and people normally on these boards are not), Costco is not a stock to be traded. The vast majority of you should simply be buying small amounts every month and stop looking at the price."
Crazy trading the last few minutes. Quadruple BS.
"It's funny a lot of you are showing optimistic but don't look away what happened to LULU today when this minority had higher expectation for a Bullish, guess what!?"
Ligma here. Thinking about initiating a small long position here at these what appear to be bargain prices. Any thots from this board? Patrick seems to think this is going to $310 but I’d rather see him get some ace in Pitt. Conflicted here.Thanks In advance-LigmaAce
"just got back to even with this, thinking about getting out, seems to peak right here"
this is ridiculous. The market is clearly overreacting. This amazon craze is getting out of hand.
Nice movement over the past few days!
Can we get to 200 today? Giddy up
Amazing buying op. If you can't see it better stick with mutual funds.
It seems like every stock that hits a new high drops back.
Shorts gonna get squeeeeezedReddit Group soon to take over...............
Remember COST always bounces back...........................lower it falls the HARDER it pops.
DIVI. increased shorts better cover soon.
why cant costco be a 400 billion dollar company like walmart.
shocking the turn from yesterday to today in price. Seems any time a trade is going to be made by individual there needs to be a warning disclaimer BEWARE!
Over reaction to Virus makes another great BUY opportunity!
Told you to BUY the silly dips..............................................glad i did.
"What a nice day for us Costco stock holders day after earnings, only getting better IMO."
seeing a gap up tomorrow to 330??
Costco is the best place to shop stock price could go a little higher though :)
400 coming to a theater near you. This stock is awake with both eyes open.
New Seeking Alpha Post: https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/15663412-joe_retail/5218661-betting-earnings-pop-costco-week
Picked up some at $319.90. It does not matter whereit will be tomorrow after earning. $340 fine. $290 fine. What matters is where it will be in 2025 and beyond...
"How is special dividend a gift? If it reduces the price by exactly the same amount, effectively forcing some to pay higher tax(as a dividend on 1099div vs capital gain)"
not sure why this stock dipped below 300 business is still booming !
"Dont care about the fluctuations, this is a long term hold... what I reaalllyy want is the chocolate almond ice cream bar back... and the chocolate soft serve... and the combo pizza....? darn you Costco how can you get rid of my combo slices? /cry"
"funny went in to whole foods today, first time since amazon purchase. i asked a guy working there what big changes have occurred. He thought for a moment and then said bananas are .69 vs .99 cents. He was serious. I think what amazon did was light a fire focusing on on-line sales for brick and mortar stores like COST WMT and TGT. Glad i bought this at 151 during that time. Grocery is a tough biz,"
Should survive this bloodbath thanks to tangible revenue and actual numbers. Playing the run up to earnings as it should be good. Investors will return to value stocks sooner or later
Why is COST down over $5 today?
Stocks go down in a bear market unless the earnings and revenue beat by alot
Look for 275.00 as machine trading continues................................BUY
"Yesterday, I mentioned an event that a pike in volume; 141k was traded at 9:52 AM. Today, a bigger spike happened at 432k at the beginning of the trade session. Granted, this could be all the orders collected overnight and executed at the start of the trading day. However, this volume is over 3 times the spike I saw yesterday. This is spike is not visible unless you expand the daily chart. The cost of this spike is probably not due to retail investors. Some institutions is/are trading this stock in large quantity. The value traded first thing this morning was about $160 Million."
Nice! Nice day!
who is gambling this stock today.
"Who the Fud Duck is selling at this price??? Why? Great price, super company who is making Money! $170 in 2 weeks!"
keep selling guys. I want to buy it cheaper lol.
this stock gonna go down atleast 10-20 points tomorrow. get ready!!
Is guidance looks good?
I am so lucky to buy COST when it is down over 7 points. It is no brainer stock.
Just got in at $367 :)
Getting ready to make a move soon............................................
So crowded in Costco these weekend!
Amazon went down after earnings not for lack of revenue but due to higher costs. Usually if revenue is fine and theres a good reason for the higher costs the bad earnings wont affect much
"""Costco Wholesale (COST) PT Raised to $295 at Oppenheimer"""
"The notion that Amazon can impact Costco’s sales figures doesn’t make sense :1) Costco is a membership and not a cheap one - people have to want to be Costco members, some portion of them are large families 2) most Costco members have as well Amazon prime - no impact on sales3) Costco sales huge packages , some generic - the shipping costs from Amazon will be high Etc ..."
300 calls looking so good.
Doing some more BUYING as the shorts and weak hands continue to scare others.remember no one has made $$$ by PANIC SELLING.
special div. let’s see it go costco !
Last chance to sell close to 225.00...rebuy when it has settled down. It is still valuable just rose too fast..
"how do shrinking gas prices affect COST? Seems like it might not matter because up or down, there is always a line and they are always way cheaper than anywhere. Maybe it's beneficial?"
The continued run in COST's stock price is truly phenomenal. Congrats to all COST longs!
Love Costco to shop but there are better places to invest.
"Told you guys, one step forward two steps backwards, everyone gave me thumps down. And yes Tom, im a long term investor but thats how the stock price is moving unfortunately."
"Where are Costco consumers getting all the cash to buy supplies? This is the only place where the tab is over several hundred dollars. Even ""whole paycheck"" (Whole Foods Market) does not compare. I finally got a package of toilet paper early on Thursday. Lines were unbelievable and no IDs were checked. One downside: there were so many people in the store that it could have been an incubation chamber for Covid-19. Happy to see the regular customer greeters and cashiers. One had a 3M N95 mask, so she must have been pretty resourceful to find one in HI. Suggestion to the CEO: Let the seniors purchase masks at discount prices, assuming the gubmint is able to free up production capacity within the U.S. That will require use of national powers by the Prez."
Sell!!!! record volume.It will red for 2 more days.Buy back 190.
Hope next week is better for COST
now don't fizzle at the end of the day 
Who read it? Where did they lack? revenue? guidance? why the small drop?
this stock will be $500 after this virus is over
"Costco Defenders Come Out After Stock DowngradeCostco's debut in China was so successful that its Shanghai store had to close early because it couldn't handle the massive crowd, Cramer said, adding that the company decided within days to open a second location in the city.""That sure doesn't seem like a troubled, cannibalized business to me."" https://finance.yahoo.com/news/costco-defenders-come-stock-downgrade-155226044.html"
pe too high
"who gives a damn about amazon,,,it will not take over the world,,it will help weak companies,,thasts all,,costco is a giant and could squash amazon if it desired to,,,fools chase the amazon stock up,,,how does that 1080 price look now that 945 is the new price,,not to well is it"
"The panic is hitting my new Costco in Bradenton Florida, before store opening this morning, folks with their shopping carts to load up on food and supplies were wrapped half way around the Costco store.Costco sale/earnings are going out the roof!"
"Everyone I know are getting vaccine, seeing more people in Costco"
Panic setting in among the share holders.
"Perfect time to buy. Overreaction on the Amazon Whole Foods buyout, support at $163. Only up from here. Let's be serious Costco isn't anywhere people."
"Granted stock is not cheap but never has been. It is a premium company. WF downgrade will be very short lived, who really cares what they say"
MUTED DOCTOR_MONEY !! Math genius....tanking for him IS 1% ! LOL
85 pennies away from 270 which I have been predicting would happen since January of this year. Just view my history on this board. Easiest call I have ever made.
a good old fashioned sell off coming its friday
Love my Costco but they need to up their game on major appliances. Minimum 2 week delivery decided I couldn’t wait paid $100 more at Lowes and it was there the next morning.
Walmart breaking out before earnings report tomo!!Costco Walmart target best to own during and after pandemic
Just look for the dips thendo some BUYING.
"I haven't seen a release announcing the quarterly the dividend. It's usually announced two weeks before the x-date, which should be this week. So the announcement should have been two weeks ago. But there hasn't been one."
"Many here are looking for the huge pay out on the divvy. I might make a suggestion of buy the at the money 2023 Calls. You all know after a nice 2% pullback and a Special Divvy on the way that COST just gave you a gift of a discount as you ride to $425 by EOY. Who knows, with this pandemic shutting everything down, COST just might explode up there in a hurry."
I see a bunch of AMZN bandwagoners here. Amazon has never generated a profit. Pure hype.
COST Insiders continue to buy.
I'm in line at Costco in California. Total madhouse. buy buy buy
Is there a run on Costco steaks yet? I heard Trump steaks are sold out.
The stock just paid out 7.50 and its about down that much in price. Do you think the company which reported good April numbers will lay an egg on May 25 when it reports. Ipersonally think the earning will be good.
AMAZON = no competition for Costco !!!!!sorry shorts but you BURN again.............................Sales increase and higher margins continue with COST.
I'll renew my membership once I get vaccinated... the in-store shopping experience is not simply dead forever due to a rare pandemic occurrence.
Very frustrating day!!! Had to bit my tongue for calling for $350 on this MB 1 month early. GRRR LOL
Costco Wholesale reached an all time high at 363.67
"Grimmikins, tell us again.How many shares of COST did you short at $113?If you're gonna fib, fib big.Sailor-suited sissy............."
"“Earth to Costco, come in Costco” - Did anyone tell the CEO that Covid-19 restrictions are slowly being lifted, not more strictly being enforced? If I owned their stock I would sell, If I paid for a membership I would demand a refund. You protect your employees by requiring them to wear a mask. Customers should be able to make that decision for themselves!"
and I though costco was toast when Amazon bought Wholefoods. Right.costco is awesome
sold today..this is headed back to $300 ...over inflated stock
You can see XLP stocks weakening after a bogas pop on the open....I bought back 5 of my PUTS after cashing out on Friday.....I think XLP chart wants to roll over.
"We shop at our Costco every week, what no one has mentioned is during the height of all this, they had a limit of 125 guest at our local stores, now it’s up to 500. They did this for the protection of there members which is great. But, I have yet to hear any of the analysts mention this. Nice for a company to look out for there guests/members. Love Costco, long and strong!"
Entire Dow & Nasdaq down 9% right now. COST off 4% from Friday close currently. I'd think this holds it's head up better than most and nothing to panic over. When this virus mess gets behind us...and it will at some point... COST will continue to be a winner...too good-and strong- of a company and much needed right now....hang tough is my take.
Sales up up up..................................
glad i bought at 370!
gotta love it when someone puts so much effort into persuading a yahoo board
"$320s post earnings ... COST, WMT, AMZN, and TGT control the retail market and horde the last stimulus. The next stimulus will catapult COST to $350. Bank on it."
should have sold at 382..my gut was telling me to
mOST STOCKS IN THE xlp (WHICH cost) IS IN ARE AT THEIR LOWS NOW....THIS IS GOING down!!! AT A 33pe....IS WILL GET CRUSHED AND will TEST THE 50 DAY AVERAGE AT SOME POINT...always does!!!!!!
Kevin C Remember Obama years the feds went down to 0% and still didn't work
"COST will bounce, wait for it."
$300 coming
BUY under 200.00
how low do you think we go after earnings im thinking at this rate we see sub 300 tbh
Food courts opening. More revenue coming. Plus they invested hundreds of millions to produce their own chickens. Both will add big revenue for years for higher dividends and special payouts
Anybody know date and time that Costco will announce profits for month of December?Hoping for huge profits to move stock higher.
"COST rev +14.7%. Incredible for a company of that size, COST ecommerce sales +75.8%. Beastly! AH's pushing upward"
One reason Buffett may have sold is that Costco pays a small dividend. Buffett likes companies with wide moats and good dividend payouts to build a horde of cash to buy his next company.
"In a few days, it should be over 310 at least.Revenue numbers were great, and Costco did not tone down the guidance for next year."
Buying shares on the pullback. Hoping it goes to $215 next 6months.
at such earnings shouldn't we be at north of 200??
"yep just as planned, buy high sell low."
"BURN shorts BURN ...........................to you COST always bounces back, this is just the beginning here."
"Whether we want to admit it or not, the trade war is going to land punches on retail. Discount stores ($FIVE $TJX $GO $OLLI $DLTR $DG) can thrive in environments like this. Wholesale like $COST will likely be fine as well. You're rolling the dice on anything else though."
"$45 in less than a month. Basically a 15% pop. RSI hovering in the high 77 range. If it settles below yesterdays high, well, then we have a haircut coming IMO. Sold my options today at the $380 mark. Enjoyed a nice 45% profit for only 3/4 weeks thank you mister market. Its going to $400 by Christmas. Waiting for the breather to reenter."
Costco has order delay issues ...
Remember when the amzn touts said it would be a threat to cost.
"Expnesive, margin is very small, dividend is pretty generous"
Money managers............. loading up on COST
Looks like this stock has topped out
When giants like $INTC goes down they go down and will take time to bounce.. let it go for now - few downgrades will bring to 40s low may be and then ride back if positive forecasts available.. save money live better $WMT $COST $TGT may go up with inflation- GLTA
Time to buy more at $350.
"The report is that in Costco the lines are too huge and some items are out. Found that they cannot refill some itemsThis means people are stocking up supplies and do not want to shop in crowded areas.Some people I saw in some crowded areas are wearing masks.If this continues we will have problem.Hopefully it does not become serious Incase, just my thoughts.I am not sure how this affects cotsco supply and earnings will get affected, just Incase."
I HAVE CALLS THAT WXPIRES TOMORROW ASKHOLS!
Major buy.
Don't you just love how Wall Street uses Cramer to pump a stock so they can dump it. Good old pump and DUMP.
"I LOVE ""MY"" COSTCO SHARES!Costco is huge and will keep growing as the stock will also soon enough."
SHORTIES better cover soon.
where gonna need a bigger store
"We also see fundamental risks to the pace of COST’s US and international growth due to membership exhaustion, US saturation and international delays. In the US we see (1) new competitive pressure as they near peak club counts, members per club, and revenue per member, (2) a possible downturn catalyst big enough to cause members to reevaluate spend and membership fees, and (3) potentially more aggressive competitor offerings in Convenience or Service that draw away members in new ways."
Is this going to drop or go up after earnings?
EMH STOCK NEWS TODAY OVER 100 STUDIES IN HUMAN CLINICAL TREATMENT
"went to Costco last night, I'm not selling it was packed. looked like Christmas time with customers carts full and happy people waiting in the check out line. they had 8 registers open, I was the cheapest cart in my line at 318.00 some flat bed carts, I think over 1k. I'm hold my shares this should be going higher."
Internal rumor that special dividend is coming next month
cheers
"EPS: 2.36 (beat)Revenue: 43,414b (missed by 1 b). This is the reason why it is down."
Hate to say it but I told you cost could not be the exception to bad earnings like amzn and wmt. Eventually it will go back up but I am still not touching this untill 299.
"Hands down - the best-run company in America. If your perspective is short-term, invest in the GME's and Zoom's of the world. If your perspective is that you want a stock to help send your kids and grandkids to college, invest in COST."
"And another all-time! Do NOT sell a share! My six holdings ""don't touch it"" portfolio for the next five years: Microsoft, Shopify, Nvidia, Costco, Apple, IHI (the med equip ETF)."
Hopefully my last comment comes to reality that 338 support got a strong back and should support us
"what do you guys think..costco is expensive stock..might go up $70-80 a year if things are really good like in the pandemic..but leaning towards Walmart and target, just because I can acquire a lot more shares I can get 1000 shares of each of them, but only 1000 shares of costco, but those stocks might be close to tapping out? whadda you think"
going sideways on a green day. this has been very disappointing holding since pre-ER
DO MOST SHAREHOLDERS OUT THERE THINK MGT IS DOING A GREAT JOB ? WHY WOULD THEY BROADCAST THEIR SUPPORT FOR UPWARD AND HIGHER PAY RAISES AND NOT DO ANYTHING FOR SHAREHOLDERS. IN 3 MONTHS THE STOCK HAS DROPPED OVER 60 POINTS
quit talking about $400..geezus. just let it happen if it do
"No doubt, will be a $400 stock with continued pandemic. Money in the bank. Strong value for the pandemic era. Doing everything right for customers and employees per usual."
"Grimmikins, don't you just love that drop?Sailor-suited sissy..........how's that imaginary short at $113 working out for you, son?"
Downgraded to SELL!
And here comes the steady climb towards next ER.
"if anything.... in times of panic and outbreak, first thing everyone floods over to is FOOD to stock up on. COST is going up especially with Earnings around the corner. "
"Seeing Targets beat definitely raises my expectations for COST this Thursday. I shop at both locations and if I'm going to Target its usually for 1 or 2 specific items only. But when I go to Costco, I always end up with a cart full of things plus a hotdog and a soda I didn't know I wanted."
"Could a Costco Special Dividend Be Coming? One Analyst Thinks Yes, at $10 a Share."
Told you buy theDIPS..............................................
CNBC is reporting 16% comp sales for the last 5 weeks
"Big selloff before the bell, a lot of nervousness for no reason at all..."
"Bought some shorts for the summer, just need to find some flip flops now."
was Costco's share price adjusted down $10 for the special dividend today?
Why do these great companies wait until AFTER I buy to drop the bad news?
$202.00 to $215.00 by end of month
it was a GREAT Q buyer on weakness here.
KOREA is where to jobs will be going ..............................................bye bye CHINA............................
"YUP... COSTCO IS ON ITS WAY NOW. THE SKY IS THE LIMIT. ITS WAY WAY UNDER PRICED. CUSTOMER LOYALTY IS OFF THE CHARTS. THE WORKERS ARE THE BEST. TOILET PAPER IS ALWAYS ON HAND. THE LINES OUTSIDE STRETCH INTO THE NEXT COUNTY AND IN SOME CASES...THE NEXT STATE. THEY'RE OPEING UP NEW WAREHOUSES IN PAKISTAN, TIBET, AND SMALL ISLANDS IN THE PACIFIC WITH POPULATIONS UNDER 100. MGT IS THINKING COLONIZING MARS AND URANUS AS POTENTIAL HOT SPOTS. YUP...NOTHING TO DO FROM HERE ON OUT BUT JUST RELAX AND DREAM OF RETIREMENT AND A GOLDEN PARACHUTE AND MAYBE EVEN A GOLDEN CODOM."

any second now.. it wants to go green i know it
Dropping like a sack of potatoes.250 tomorrow.Bankruptcy by 2021.
I think COST will eventually become the winner after Krogers and Walmart banned gun sales to people aged 18 to 20.
Thank you for the 315.00 buy order
"It would be very smart for Costco to start selling diesel fuel. Not only could they fuel their own fleet after dropping shipment, along with other local commercial rigs, the personal car market is moving towards diesel to meet mileage requirements set by our ""super smart, super caring, all knowing, in our best interest government"" (lol)."
you guys should read some chinese comment about this first costco store.

Money managers Loading up ON THE DIPS.
Is COST still a good buy at $187. In May 2017 Costco paid the special dividend - so think it will again and when?
"Still good support at $180.00, but P/E will have to drop to a more normal range of 16 to 20, instead of the lofty 36."
I bet my entire 401k on Costco after the experts down graded them after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Thank you Costco.
does this just tank more when the market starts going up?
"costco is getting set up to be killed....its 3% off its all time highs....when the hoarding ends, which it will, people will be not hiding here any longer...if we go into a depression , it will lose a third off its value just due to circumstances and lowering of ppe....theres no logical way other than DOWN"
"Gordon Haskett Upgrades Costco Wholesale to Accumulate From Hold, PT Raised to $330 From $255"
This is a $150 stock at best
Long term it will be affected
If it only turns out half as successful as Taiwan has been for them it will continue to grow and be a huge success. One out of 5 families in Taiwan have Costco memberships. They loved the guaranteed quality of USDA beef versus what they were getting before Costco arrived. Their meat departments are bigger than comparable US Costcos for that reason. My guess is you will see the same thing in China if more Costcos open there.
"So what's the latest on special dividend decision, timing and likely amount, smart shopers ?"
shorts better cover.................................
Great store but their forays into social justice are troubling to me as shareholder.
"Revenues were awesome, due to one time COVID related charges, profits were a bit lower.Costco should be back to 308+ by the end of today!"
No earnings have been good enough to please the street practically. That was a fantastic quarter. Anyone with a brain is buying this dip. 400 will be here soon then onto 500.
"My 1st position here on Costo. Been wanting to buy beat myself up didn’t buy it last wk. paid more today...hold forever now. Finally, made the move feeling very BULLISH"
Costco would be 340 in less than 6 months.Just wait for the numbers. for next quarter.
Bought more this morning at $234. THANk YOU!!
Costco is king... great stock...perhaps their management should offer a special membership price to Sam Clubs members that were screwed by Walmart.... Charlie M...Marketing Exe
Really hoping Cost penetrates deep into the China market. A lot of room for growth.
I sold this after special dividend at $372.
"I challenge all you Bear trolls, swing thru a Costco on a weekend; you’ll find packed parking lots and an average cart spend of $315 vs. Sam’s club of $226. This stock is undervalued, substantially. $195 by 3/30."
"Oops. $160 Grimbelina.Now, just where did you cover that imaginary short of yours? You know the one that I mean, the one that you claimed to have made at $113.How come you won't talk about that, Grimbelina?Now, if you're gonna fib then at least make it a winner. You should have fibbed and said that you bought at $113. That way it wouldn't be such an embarrassment and you wouldn't have to hide and deny.Now, post some silliness about my wife or someone else's wife. After all, you don't have one of your own so you might as well keep up the history of fibbin'.Hey, how's that yacht in the south of France.Fibbin' l'il sailor-suited sissy.................."
220 end of week. Fundamnetals look good. This company is a well oiled machine and savvy. I went Saturday to shop.. Should have known better but wife said get us that one of a kind steak amd grill. It was PACKED.

"This stock is due to pass 200 , this should happen soon"
"The not so bad news, with today's market sell-off... Costco fairs better % wise than the rest of the retail sector. The big Amz is double down % than Costco. Glad to be holding this than another retail stock!!!"
THRERE IT IS
Buy the rumor. Sell the news.
"COST will start to move up again after next week all the fear from Jay Powell subsides. COST beats WMT everyday. Look at TGT, the earnings is still lower than COST."
BLAST OFFnext stop 432.00
Is there a reason this stock has been declining? Seems like a strong company that will fully recover after the pandemic.
COST reached an all time high at 323.14
20 new hires per year per store is $20 increase in payroll per store

Time for a huge special dividend !!!!!!!!!!
Went to Costco yesterday line wrapped around about 3/4 of the store . This is in S California . Online sales revenue will triple
Looks like tomorrow is gonna be a strong day for the market and Costco is go up with it!:) I wouldn’t be surprised if it hits $400-$450 pps in this quarter
Wow should of moved my $$$$
When is the dividend payable?
The line at my local Costco to cancel memberships is huge!
Costco in the 280 - 300 range is a steal!!
"Get out while you can! One step forward, two step backwards tomorrow! Tom is not buying enough to put a floor on the stock price."
just bought 10 shares
"Today all the big boys take profit and run. It is probably just a day or two. i wait to buy under 300, because it can not go up everyday. At this price I really like to get in for Oct 2 , call 300"
"the CEO needs to resign, or the board of directors need to oust him and the whole team"
Cost will jump to 205 by 31st
$325 by the end of next week.
"BUY PUTS of ANY KIND HERE!!! Over bought, over valued and up ELEVEN straight days and not one down day (YET) in JUNE!!!!!!!!"
Ready for some short covering soon ????
Definitely a good buying point. A solid stock for long term.
"Great volume, closed up nicely. Bottom is IN!!! Should be a nice Gap up next week."
Will open down after earnings report. EPS was adjusted. Didn't beat. EPS was in line and in this market a stock is punished unless it exceeds . Should open down 3-5 points.
"love Costco, strong company...let's go $270"
luv shopping at cosco... great store
$312 ok to buy at?
Warren not going to buy with a PE of 37and a yield less than 1%.Maybe Amazon?
slowly reachin back to $400 enjoy the ride
"Look at Costco sell off on no news, it means investors holds big chunks of money in the stock, and it has been down for nearly 2 weeks. they rather take a loss and move on to other hot stocks in EV sector to recoup some loss from Costco. Costco should announce stock 4-1 stock split to lift the stock price up and prevent it's slipping further down."
"Take a look at a 2 and 5 year chart of this stock, their is nothing unusual going on here. It will recover, they are also working very hard to improve on line salesJust my thoughts"
Theres no slight miss. Its a huge miss
All gains of last 2 days gone. No traction at all.
Lady and gentleman. Last chance to get on the $$ wagon. Earnings will be announced aftermarket on Thursday. It will jump to $260 in Friday morning.
"This Is Why 2021 Will Be Another Great Year for CostcoThe popular retailer provided essentials in 2020. But even if customers slow down their stocking up, Costco will still see growth.Jennifer SaibilJennifer Saibil(TMFanibird)Dec 30, 2020 at 10:15AMAuthor BioShopping at Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is a popular American activity, and customers kept up their bulk shopping outings throughout the pandemic. Costco had high sales increases, powered by in-store shopping and also strong digital growth. 2020 was a great year for the bulk-buy king, but 2021 will be also, even as people begin to spend on non-essentials. Here's why, and why it will continue to be good for investors.A year like no otherCostco stepped up to the plate as customers hoarded toilet paper and other essentials throughout lockdowns. But even after most lockdowns had been lifted in the 2021 first quarter, ended Nov. 22, sales grew 17%, and e-commerce increased 86%."

Hey SF- How much did you take in the shorts today? I’m thinking it was a bundle. Chuckle head....￼
Divi. increase in talks...........................................
"Has Costco been buying back stock? If not, should they have been? Also, what would be better? Going ahead with the special dividend in the summer, or using that money on an acquisition instead (assuming there is a good one available)?"
"Lots of hype in here on a good company, but all they need to say tonight is a slight, non-mention like 'while optimistic we stay alert over the threat of a slowing consumer' and all hell breaks loose on downside. I no longer play."
I sat on the fence for 3 weeks about joining (http://tradingstrategys.com) for their weekly picks. Big mistake. COST exploded and I completely missed out. Don’t make the same mistake I made. Join them today.
Great run......................look for some pullback as BUY opportunity.
Packed today. My bill was $547.
WMT TGT COST are blue light specials
"Lets put it this way as this slides I will buy! Great company with no china exposure. They buy major bulk items, low cost."
what's going on anybody knows? I got in at 166 75 on Zack's ranking it's a Rank 2 and buy
Close GREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN
Looks like China expansion is about to take off. Phase 1
Costco warehouses a madhouse. Costco stock red. Go figure.
COST is down on costs. Ironical. Maybe they should have waited before announcing the $16 wage.
COST upgraded again today.Own it don’t trade it.
"Regardless of any trade war, Costco will always remain a neutral member for both parties. Win-Win"
Finally got in 307.74/share. I feel pretty lucky. I love shopping at Costco.
COST sales up over 9%Target sales DOWN...................................
Dumped it for a loss today. Pick it back up sub 3.
We’ll probably see huge store returns in the next month
Today is a tough day for folks. The winners today have been the companies that have done very poorly throughout the year. People seem to be selling companies like Costco in an effort to chase after.. Kohl's (up 20%+). The only piece of good news is that the market is broadening out now with the companies that have been down double digits recovering a tiny bit. Stay strong all! Good luck to everyone!
Out Of Control!
It’s trading at pre covid levels.....................................way undervalued...........................REV. BEAT a positive
"Costco is a buy and hold don't worry about it stock. It will continue to outpace the S&P. Buying the stock as a trading stock is not wise. There are many stocks to trade, and Costco is not one of them. If you own it, you just sit on it and it will grow. If it drops, you buy more and continue to add to your position. I've done this for 8 years and it's served me well."
I hate it when my business only makes 12% year over year. I should probably sell my business on this model. I fully understand now that this market is out of control. Crash is just a matter of one bad day.
Love Costco 
"Costco has a Solid Business Model that defies the Metrics. Pullback to 150, then straight back to 180. Amazon and that Whole Foods thing won't deter Costco. People love going to Costco. Shop , Samples , Grab a Brat , and see Cool New Stuff. A Winner"
Costco has proven one more time on a good time and bad time to go to Costco.
Sales up on 12% and stock is down. Are you kidding me! Macy’s wouldBe happy for a 2% riseCramer says BUY here ...........................
Down $9 on Avg. Volume = NO BUYERS.
Good but not good enough.
More Politics from Pelosi= BUY opportunity here.
There is no competition with Amazon. Costco sells in bulk and food is only a percentage of their offering. Over reaction.
bought this @$352...and it dropped...will it ever make it there again?
"At this price, we are below 2017 P/E levels on one of the only companies that survived the pandemic without nosediving. This punishment is undeserved. Let's go back to $360."
"I just sold and got out.. the forward multiple is way too high compared to peers. Even if they make good numbers, stock will likely pull back. When it does, I will get back in around $150."
this is only a trading market
"The company's total revenue rose to $34.74 billion from $32.36 billion, beating estimates of $34.71 billion. COSTCO BEATS REVENUE ALSO"
The party is over. Retail sales incl. COST will fall for the next 4 quarters. TGT down 11%.
Would not be surprised if stock went up 8-10 percent in after hour due to lasttwo weeks of losses.
"Have liked COST for a long time. Sold COST around $360+ is because the stock market overall is over heated and COST carries one of the highest PE among retailers, also relative to its historical PE values. Will probably buy back some of the shares once the PE drops to between 25 to 28. Also wait for the overall market reversal from the recent routs. Good luck longs."
If you dont want to wear a mask take a hike.
Special Divi. could be coming soon..............................................
When will they declare the special dividend.It's been a long time
We might get a buying opportunity after earnings
once this gets greern..it will steamroll
few seconds to go green
COST is in talk to buy OSTK
"Here’s why I think Costco is a good investment, both short term and long term—1. Consistently good to very good financial performance 2. Great customer experience, loyalty, and trust...and hence continuing growth from existing stores3. Lots of expansion opportunities, domestic and foreign, including China (anxiously waiting for 2nd mainland store after great success with the first one and one-half years ago). After the Shanghai success, hope to see multiple stores open soon. 4. Lots of room to improve online and related delivery. Still well behind Amazon and Walmart in my view. 5. Lots of room to expand online lines of business, like travel, insurance, leisure, etc."
Got my dividend check yesterday. With 385 shares it was decent. Hoping for strong results for the 1/4. I'm a 20+ year employee and avid shopper. Love the club!!
Adding 25 shares this is a steal.

$COST Upgraded by Wells Fargo Equal Weight » Overweight USD 340 » USD 370
"Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the best companies in the United States. In its most recent quarter, it earned $1.89 per share, beating the consensus estimate of US$1.85 per share. It grew same-store sales by a whopping 7.8%. The long-term picture has been equally rosy: COST appreciated 433% over the course of the 2010s.Costco is a worthy stock for any investor to consider. With a strong Canadian dollar, buying it makes even more sense. As mentioned in the discussion of Brookfield Asset Management, you can invest more cheaply in foreign assets when your local currency is strong. Right now, the Canadian dollar is appreciating against the U.S. dollar, so you can buy COST cheaper in Canadian dollar terms. If you buy now and the Canadian dollar starts falling again, you’ll realize a higher return."

"If people stock more supplies at Costco this quarter wouldn't it just mean it's sales would slow down the next quarter? I mean, i think everyone would eat and use the same amount of toilet paper. So if they already have it in stock that means they just won't buy more later."
will see low 170s

It seems the market can absorb the bad news :) don’t go against the trend. COST TSLA AAPL can take bad news today

Thought this was an interesting take on Costco vs. The Virus...just a FYIhttps://investorplace.com/2020/03/costco-stock-is-a-safe-harbor-from-the-coronavirus-panic/
Costco lost its purpose as a business; the point is for INVESTORS to make money. These guys are paying 4B to their employees... Not a good place to hold long term
costco is opening a store in shanghai china. big boom
Market is IRRATIONAL about Virus.......................we should learn from other markets as they do not seem to PANIC like we do.
COST would rather pay employees higher wages than give a special dividend.

What time is the earnings call today?
COST and AAPL must have stocks for 2020

I told you several weeks ago to buy when this was in the 310s but many shorts attacked me insulted me and thumbs downed my comments. Now they have eaten their words big time. 400 is coming back. It’s still not too late to buy in but time is starting to run out assuming no black swans.
Strong Buy!
Someone bought 1K shares in after-hours at $375.10. That's a nice chunk of change. COST should excel nicely next week when shorts are forced to cover.
more upgrade coming.
Every December costconstocks drops a little. This year is a little more dramatic than usual. Around the January 5th or 6th it tend to start going in the upward direction . Hopefully this coming year is no different.
Costco didn’t beat SPY for past 5 years.

FILLED AT $324.75 !!! 400 shares
Only about 13k shares exchanged afterhours so far... My guess is it paints more red tomorrow. Just being par for the course isn't good enough for this kind of valuation.
"Costco raising the minimum wage to $16.00 is a very smart move. This move really does not impact the business model or earnings. First, this affects only a portion of the employees that is at the low end of the wage scale. The additional cost of wages would be easily absorbed by an adjustment of prices of goods. Even if there is a raise of prices on merchandise, Costco would still be having the cheapest prices around. I doubt customers would even notice or mind. I noticed that prices of some items do fluctuate up and down anyway. As long as I know Costco offers a Good if not the Best prices, I would keep going to shop there.The Benefits of this raise in wages are many. First, Costco got some free advertising. Costco employees are among the most helping and friendly. Local Governments all love Costco as it pulls in a lot of sale taxes. This helps when Costco wants to expand. Local Governments would band backwards to accommodate new Costco Stores to be opened in their areas. For Costco to grow and expand, a good reputation count is important. That is why, I considered that this is a smart move."
Do you ever feel like the downgrade is arbitrary? Or done to artificially lower the stock price albeit temporarily?
went to costco today. no line up in the door and hardly any wait at the till. people stocked up and arent buying anything but necessities which they have already stocked up on. groceries are low margin. I love costco but im not banking on a great quarterly earnings report
"Barron’s says earning beat, yahoo says miss!!!!!Barron: “Costco (ticker: COST) said it earned $1.89 a share on revenue of $37.3 billion. Analysts had been predicting earnings per share of $1.85 on revenue of $36.55 billion.”Yahoo says analysts were expecting 1.92!!!"
Just look for the sillyDIPS to add more.
COST is just like AAPL you mustOWN IT DONT TRADE IT !!!!!!!!
This CNBC report on Costco is a bit long but probably worth watching if you are interested in Costco. I found this interesting as I remember most if not all the names of the various old stores that were mentioned in this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzejHGniMTQ&ab_channel=CNBC
The dividend should be paid on 9/13 with a ex dividend date of 8/29. so the declare date is usually 14 to 15 days before the ex date. hope this helps everyone
"Nobody can beat Costco in retail, they's haven't even scratched the surface yet in the online world."
COST #1 pick RECESSION PROOOOOOOOOOOOOOF
Pretty sure I heard Yanny.
It will restate with ER shock.
"Costco needs to implement rations on toilet paper, hand sanitizer and other cleaning supplies that are popular. Those 30 roll toilet paper packs should be limited to one per customer per month. Maybe send a coupon to each member that they must have to purchase."
what a gift.. I'm in for 25k
We should now see a few days of positive rallying for cost. Bullish and way long.
I don't know about everyone else but I won't renew my membership if it increases! Look at the customers at Costco. Many are low income looking for a better deal. Sell Sell Sell
Why buy a stock at 36 times earnings with a 1 percent dividend ? Grossly over valued. I get a great company. Just don’t see how people can ignore some other stocks trading at 4-7 times earnings paying 5–6 percent like many financial stocks that are half price or better right now. Crazy.

I personally believe Costco will drop on earning because of the Mac D pattern on 1week and 1 month increments. When mac is in red on earning the stock seems to go down when it’s green it goes up. This earning Mac seems to be Red.

I am a long time Cost￼co investor. But I sold 75% of my position today. Costco is over leveraged in CA. 26% of the stores are there. 30% of net sales come out of CA. The WSJ’s detailed reporting on the CA power blackout’s persuaded me to sell. Let’s hope I am wrong

best long term investment there is
"COST stores provides good value and I like to shop there, but the stock has poor value as the current PE is about 36, multi-year high. I had bought some puts yesterday at $1.1 for OCT 4, $270 strike price for the long position shares I own as an insurance to hedge against the ER."

"Costco's Kirkland warehouse 8629 120TH AVE NEKIRKLAND, WA98033-5865. Its 4 miles away from Hospital"
"From analysts: They estimate that the Sam's Clubs Walmart is closing generate annual sales between $4 billion and $4.5 billion , meaning that if Costco can capture between 30% and 50% of that business, it could lift comparable sales between 50 and 100 basis points, and add as many as 600,000 new members.Can you say ""chaching"".... GLTA"

In the tank again today
"Looking at Walmart's stock chart I see it's been declining since December like Costco. So, it's not a company ( Costco) issue. What's happening is sector rotation. Money, right now, is going into cyclical stocks. Oil for example. We're touching the bottom in terms of Costco stock."
"Has Costco Execs ever heard about PLUG POWER...If Costco can't get their act together then be ready to be left behind by Amazon, Walmart and others who are moving to PLUG Power Hydrogen Fuel cell technology to make their logistic operations more efficient and cheaper..."
"Costco around my entire area are always packed.. with next lockdowns, people are loading up again!From my last experience, I have noticed that buying things from COSTCO during the lockdowns is incomparable in terms of pricing and ease..

Blows away the sales consensus numbers again today. Earnings numbers next week take it over 250.
Nothing has changed for COST.........................adding more as it goes ON SALE !
COST needed to make a base here.
"Our Costco was packed yesterday by 9:30am when I arrived. I spent $475 just on staples (meat, sundries, etc.), no big-ticket items on this trip. Staff spraying down carts, lines orderly, everyone masked, no idiots, no anti-masker morons. Every time I got to Costco, it's packed. Every time I go to Costco, I spend on average $560 (not counting gasoline).Why buy propane anywhere else when it's nearly half-price to any other provider?"
Anyone see this jump to 311.75 or am I going crazy
"for those of you not sure about the dividend..it will go down $10.70 ,on ex-dividend day...but might go back up with November earnings?..,probably not $10.70 though"
I guess this is the definition of a bad day and an unforgiving market
"less employee turnover with wage increase.. less money spent on hiring costs, and trainning., .happier employees, produce more effective work, with less effort.ask any retailer about benefits of keeping trained employees, verses having to replace experienced employees...."
Well I am speechless Hopefully it will turn around. But today sure is disappointing.
Will this bounce back monday or will there be more pain?
"Just read a story that Costco may raise their membership fees. If they do, we're done. I can barely justify going there now at $60/year. We are a family of 2 now that they children have their own lives."
"READING MATERIAL FOR INTEREST OF SHAREHOLDERS OR LOOKING TO BE.Announcement of Periodic Review: Moody's announces completion of a periodic review of ratings of Costco Wholesale Corporation04 May 2020New York, May 04, 2020 -- Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's"") has completed a periodic review of the ratings of Costco Wholesale Corporation and other ratings that are associated with the same analytical unit. The review was conducted through a portfolio review in which Moody's reassessed the appropriateness of the ratings in the context of the relevant principal methodology(ies), recent developments, and a comparison of the financial and operating profile to similarly rated peers. The review did not involve a rating committee. Since 1 January 2019, Moody's practice has been to issue a press release following each periodic review to announce its completion.This publication does not announce a credit rating action and is not an indication of whether or not a credit rating action is likely in the near future. Credit ratings and outlook/review status cannot be changed in a portfolio review and hence are not impacted by this announcement. For any credit ratings referenced in this publication, please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com for the most updated credit rating action information and rating history.Key rating considerations are summarized below.Costco's credit profile (Aa3 stable) recognizes its position as the leading warehouse club operator in North America, with a destination grocery business that drives significant store traffic, an annuity-like membership model, a solidly-performing international presence, and an innovative complementary internet business. Additional drivers of the rating include Costco's world class operating capability, its excellent liquidity profile, and a financial strategy that has become more predictable and continues to be well-balanced between shareholders and debt holders. We note as evidenced by an unqualified audit opinion that as of September 1, 2019, Costco has remediated the material weakness in its internal controls that it disclosed in its 2018 Form 10K relating to general information technology controls in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information technology systems that support its financial reporting processes. Thus far, Costco has been able to largely weather the impact of the coronavirus as its stores are considered essential and remain open, however recent steps to implement tighter social distancing, specifically limiting the number of shoppers in stores at any one time, will have a negative impact. With its formidable liquidity and strong quantitative credit profile, Costco has the financial flexibility to successfully navigate through virtually any potential scenario"
Selling all my Costco shares at market open! OMG!!
PEG is 5.37 on Fidelity. I can’t say I’m not concerned.
RISE RISE RISE RISE RISE
"I am a Costco Customer first before a Costco Investor. Costco’s business model is sound and successful. If there is anything I need, I would probably check to see if Costco carries that. Most if not all the time, I found the price is better than most retailers and beats even Amazon. I consider myself as a long-term investor so daily fluctuation of the stock prices does not bother me. Since we cannot predict the futures we tend to study the past. Personally, I really do not trust the projected numbers that much. However, the direction or the momentum of the stock are more easily projected with some confidence. Let’s look at some of the numbers. Costco closed at $376.78 today and gained $85.29 for the year. That is a 29.26% gain. Costco gained $ 221.96 in 5 years, which works out to be a 28.67% per year. This yearly gain seems to be quite consistent. Costco has been distributing special dividends every few years and this year everyone is happy to get a $10.00 special dividend. The distribution of special dividend shows that the Company is financially sound and have excess cash that it could be paid out to the shareholders. The Beta (5Y Monthly) is 0.67. Which means that the stock is quite stable. This is not really a trading stock. There are lots of other stocks that fluctuate more, much more. If you include the dividends and the special dividends, Costco stock is gaining about 30% yearly. So, if 30% sounds good, Costco stock is a safe investment. Like so many folks have been saying about Costco. Buy on Dips is a good advice on Costco. Lastly, I wish everyone a Happy New Year and let’s all have a great 2021!"
Well all the stop loss shares have been purchased and now the buying begins.
this stock has been flat ever since they announced the special dividend...wish they would have just did it
"Costco opened it's first location in France recently, after several years of red tape. Look for many more to open now that regulatory hurdles have been cleared"
Added 200 shares.
Costco dethrones Amazon. Costco #1 in customer satisfaction on ecommerce sales
Buying a share because of the superior chicken pot pies they provide me.
You guys did realize that Costco trading on Nasdaq did not go down like others today. Costco went down 6%- $20 on Monday as result of people selling ETFS that costco was one of the stock in those etfs.I took opportunity to buy more shares here. Costco did bounce up touching the 50 days Mawhich is bullish and this stock will continue going higher. By Friday or Before Costco will be Over $380.00. Lots of Options call interest in $380 and $385 play. Good luck to everyone. Buy on the Dips.
"Time to tak massive profits....the swelloff is coming and it will be SWIFT to the downside....come too far, too fast......$230 - $285 in 4 months....really??????far"
Costco to open 200 stores in China
If you are short this stock let me ask an obvious question - Why?
"added another 100 shares, good luck to all"
apparently its not good enough..hahah buying opp
"With gasoline prices going higher, COSTCO margins and profits surge to new records"
Guessing this new money is chasing the supposedly special dividend. Would rather see Costco reinvest the money in new store openings and/or maybe just raise the regular dividend.
This is still over valued by 10% needs to go down another 20 points
I don’t think costco model will success in China. Different culture. People will take a advantage of their return and membership policy. Plus. Don’t forget in North amearica there are so many DAIGOU can help you get the costco product here. Much cheap and ship directly to you home. It is a tough business for costco. Walmart in China is a good example.
good earnings only going up from here
It will close $385.
"There she blows!!!! $400 easily by end of yr., as I've been saying should be easy all yr. LOL!"
Maybe its ne but I find it difficult to think that COST would raise their minimum wage to $16 and not report stellar results on March 4th. That would definitely not sit well with investors.
Next stop 248.00
Costco's June sales will be reported today after hours?
Someone tell me 'why' a stock split would't help this stock?
Price target raised to $380
Lets not be so stingy.Give the shareholders that special dividend.It would be a great present
Greeeeeeeen please x
The Costco in my area is doing 1 million a day
only thing im buying are Puts
Where's that anonymous fool that's been posting on here about his 140 short position ....I think he went bk and lost all his money
You're Smart to Stock Up on Costcoloading...................................
"Keep in mind that it's largest shareholder, Warren Buffett left the stock before this quarter, even knowing that there was a special dividend that was going to be offered since he had a seat on the board. I think smaller gatherings around the country for the holiday seasons leads to produce traffic at Costco. Without this traffic they cannot upsell them on all the last minute things people typically purchase there when roaming the aisles. this is the reason Costco has been slow to adapt to a delivery model."
Did Costco just put out a special dividend
Look at the quick snap back from today's low! U see.... this will rocket back up in no time! People panic for nothing lol. Long term this is a guarantee bet at these levels. A sure thing!!!
"I have owned this stock for a few years and you have to love it. Good chance for another special dividend this year too. However, based on the P/E, I am starting to get scared its a little overvalued"
"COST is way undervalued here , just a screaming BUY for me, less competition is good for COST !!!!!"
"Costco is no more than 8% off its high. So, those who own this stock could get out anytime without too much problem. If one thinks there is another stock would perform better than Costco, why not cash out and invest that other stock. If you are above water, you would make a gain and if you are under, the max you would lose is 8% (if you purchased COST at its high). One could use the lost as tax write off also. While everyone can express his opinions but if one does not do anything, nothing will change. I am not advising people to get out of Costco as I am not qualified to give advice. I just want to point out that you can do something about this. Bitch and Moan about this stock will not do a thing."
See bargains everywhere bef X'masDIS and COST are winners
Just put $30k into costco stock and let it sit for the next 10 years and also too moved all $140k of my 401k into costco stock hopefully when I retire 15 years later costco will double that amount for me to pay off my house
Cramer says Costco pricing is cheap imo even though i shop rhere. for some things is this costco is usualy 30 percent more expensive than lots of stores
The most frustrating stock on my portfolio right now...this needs to be at $400 right now
I am sure Costco did not plan to open one store. This is just a pilot project and appears to have tremendous success. Many more stores will start popping in different cities in China. I doubled my investment yesterday. I think Costco growth will accelerate from now on.
Stocks goes up $10... and then pays divided....going down $10.
"typical....earnings will crash too... lets just say amzn, or tsla had close to 16% gain... their stock would be really really booming on the news"
Costco ROCKS andthat ain't no lie my friends....
"Up 45% for the FY. Solid stock in this uneasy market. Executed .15 above EPS, missed on revs according to analysts....We need a score card to rate analysts and there speculations. Buying more!"
Cost will get multiple upgrades tomorrow.
Best company in the world.
"Went to San Jose Costco today, ,as usual can't find any parking..!"
"COST reports an excellent quarterly earnings and investors immediately throw themselves over a cliff and start dumping stock as if it were toilet paper. Alt this out of fear that Amazon was going to completely swallow every brick and mortar store in existence Just unbelievable. And I used to think I was a novice investor. Not any more. Folks, I want you to keep selling. I'm ready to pick up a few more shares at bargain prices. Thank you for your help."
ABSURDLY overbought...already at some 12 month targets at $245....buy PUTS....easy money!!!!!!!
Long term COST will be in trouble...Report saying nobody under 35 go there (millennials)...
BUYERS are coming...................................
Will be green tomorrow. Very nice report 
$400 by September. Sales are accelerating.
"Some contend that Costco is overexposed to the California economy due to having so many locations there. Well, 16 new openings planned in the next six months, and only one is in California.https://www.costco.com/new-locations.html"
It’s called a mkt
"And this drop is just fear that ALL people will start buying groceries from AMZN.... lol Despite excellent earnings the drop is 6%. For me AMZN is very limited at this level so why they try to take grocery business. I think AMZN is more in bad shape than COST. I was at coscto yesterday at 7 pm - couldn't find parking, lineups to tire department, pharmacy, no empty seats at the bar. All cashiers are open, and all of them got huge lineups. Despite low stock I LOVE costco, good price, good value, good return policy, good selections (no 100 items of the same things but just 1 or 2 that are on top). At Costco you can buy blindly anything.AMZN - you never see the item, you never touch the item, you spend hours on research of what you buy - get something you don't like, hell to order (limit on this or that), hell to return the item."

"Costco announced the quarterly dividend on 8/13, payable on 9/13. But no special dividend which is typically announced with the quarterly dividend. Could they be holding it back because of the possible recession and self-inflicted trade war with China?"
I believe the other Costco’s customers think like me. We buy anything from someone else when Costco doesn’t have it.
the lines at costco is so long. 1 plus one wait. buy buy buy
"The special dividend ($10) is supposed to be paid for holders of COST today.Tomorrow, Dec 3 is ex-div date for the special dividend and not today."
tomorrow we beat the 52wk high?
COST SHOULD BE UP $8 TODAY NOT THIS LEVEL VERY CHEAP
"Just take a drive to your local Costco ,The parking lot and lines speaks for themselves"
"Sturdy E-commerce SalesConsumers’ increased shift to online purchasing owing to the coronavirus outbreak seems to have worked in favor of the company. Costco operates e-commerce sites in the United States, Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Australia.The company’s e-commerce sales have been showcasing a sharp increase owing to the rising stay-at-home trend to maintain social distance amid the pandemic. We note that e-commerce comparable sales soared 91.1% for the retail month of October, the four weeks ended Nov 1, 2020. This followed an increase of 90.3%, 101.9%, 75.3% and 85.8% in the months of September, August, July and June, respectively."

Not a concern. Revenue up year after year. Loyal customers and more stores keep this moving forward.
All analysts predict this to be at least $400. The low estimate is $343...we are trading well below that at $325 and dropping. How does this keep dropping every single day...???
"Building my positions here, nice"
S. California 12 o’clock noon two hours after they’ve been open line was still wrapped around to the back of Costco their earnings are going to be off the charts look for a special year in dividends for long-term shareholders

The comparable quarter a year ago, Costco had a profit of $1.1 billion or $2.47 a share."

Don't read too much into afterhours trading. Costco will be one of few survivors when all this is done. Think long term.
When will people learn it’s a buy and hold.

"From a blog in 2007 ""Drive one vehicle, split the cost of gas. “Costco size” inflation I say. Be efficient with the dollar, save on food and gas the Costco way, plus you get a free meal with all the delicious finger snacks they distribute. Bottom line is you do not have to shop at Costco to buy Costco if know what I am saying stock pickers."""
Adios! Had to bail out today. The bleeding just continues in a high priced stock. Too much dead money to just keep holding. Price of stock ran too high.
To management: This family is fed up with your face mask gestapo employees. Saw one Costco door woman (Plano TX) berate a family while a Costco employee pranced by without a mask. It either applies to all or no one. Double standards are for politicians. Not for someone buying eggs. Either change or we’re done shopping until you do.

"Looking at Costco stock since mid 90s, up 1700%. Great. But then compare to Amazon over same time period, it’s up over 66,000%. Makes Costco look like a flat line. And an overpriced one right now based on PE and PEG."
"So I am at my local COST at 10:30 this morning. We have an absolute monsoon occurring. The parking lot is more full than I expected given the storm. It is a location with their own liquor store and gas. I ask a middle management type what has happened since the switch to Visa, by asking first about liquor and then about gas and then about the main store. He very enthusiastically says that each part has enjoyed increased traffic and revenues. I have posted a couple of times here that I thought the increases would happen. COST has made itself one of my largest positions, and I think we will be outperforming for at least 3-5 years ahead. That is how real wealth is created."

Costco and Walmart stores are very empty of people. We went shopping yesterday and it was a big supersize because I thought we had to wait in a long line.

Buy buy buy too cheap
After gme ive been sitting on cash and looking for good opportunities. After noticing most retail is being shorted Costco is the opposite. Not to mention I believe this is currently undervalued and should bounce off resistance. I saw comments on here about a split? Is that confirmed? I was also digging and found their e-commerce grew around 70% which was much higher than Walmart. I think I will be adding to cost with my gme earnings. Pls share your thoughts and observations
No mention that the Costco website started selling Apple computers yesterday. Rolling out to all warehouses in the Spring. Should be a boost to future sales and earnings
200-206.00 a buy here.
Seriously doubt comments on a Yahoo message board move markets

perfect time to buy. been watching Costco for awhile and biggest dip it has had is like 1 to 2 bucks and it recovers quick and goes green. also earnings is coming up. this should recover nicely.
don't just buy into this for the dividend.. thats a wash... but into this for a keeper..November sales release coming up on Wednesday...Christmas sales coming up..this will be over $400 in no time...
"earnings for some reason always fail, I think wall St. expects too much"
where'd those people go that were waiting for under 200?
Earnings whisperer estimates a beat by .02
if we really are in for a economic downturn in 2019 cheap buckets of food should do well amirite
"almost impossible to find a company that can have a good earnings report, getting old actually"
"Costco (COST) remained unfazed by competition, reporting stellar sales and earnings growth in 2018. On average, Costco’s monthly comps have increased 9.2% in the first ten months of 2018—which is exceptional, given the heightened competition.We expect Costco to sustain its solid growth momentum in both sales and earnings in the coming quarters. Costco’s investment in pricing to widen its value gap with peers is likely to drive traffic and, in turn, comps. Meanwhile, expanded offerings and a high membership renewal rate should further support the comps growth rate."
"I am looking at the charts (peaks and valleys) and we had the last downside point when Amazon announced they were taking over Whole Foods. At this time, that merger has done little to threaten Costco's business as one can see the rapid rise in cost's share price following that news. I see Costco fully recovered and on track to report stellar sales in this busy retail season. I am predicting that Cost will hit $200 after Thursday's closing session. jmho"

Analyst Actions: Loop Capital Adjusts Costco Wholesale's Price Target to $425 from $415 Keeps Buy RatingBY MT Newswires— 9:19 AM ET 12/03/2020
Special dividend s historically run in the $5-$7 range
Stockguru compares Costco to dollar treePut your helmet back on and get on the short bus
"Costco has earned a stature and respect from the entire economic spectrum. That’s incredible. You can feel it when you think of it in relation to target or Walmart. They may all sell the same thing, but all folks will né comfortable buying them from Costco while some may not want to buy them from target or Walmart. But will this difference continue after Walmart I’m On my way! eta the Amazon model of annual membership free and free and fast shipping? I think lots more people will buy Walmart because of it. And that means that Costco will Jane yo compete and do the same thing. Will Costco be able to pull it off ....considering that Costco members already pay an annual membership fee? That seems like a big question that needs an answer. Any thought?"
Recent stimulus checks to individuals have been fueling demand. The impact of same was visible in the company’s January’s sales results that exceeded analysts’ expectations. Look for another stimulus package soon .
"$290.22, buy 100 more."

Cramer said todayCOST and AAPL are a must hold .
there is no special dividend. get over it
"How does it make sense that Costco is trading at the same price/Market Cap that it was pre-covid? It was a covid winner and it's reveune is up signficantly, yet it trades at the same price???"
looking for a dip
let us collect until earnings in two days.
"New all-time @ 271+!!On the special dividend - many holders would rather they didn't do that. I know that they do it because they want to control their growth, and therefore have too much cash, but I would rather thry kept the $$$, as I will get taxed, with too much of it disappearing to the Feds and the State."
Thoughts about Monday?
cost may have reached its peak..time to talk splitting
"I'm confident in us longs, but I'm afraid of a pullback due to weak hands on a red day for the market"
"COST is too cheap at this price, you will not see COST at this price on Oct 3rd."
Im concerned that Costco is starting to only stock the items that makes them biggest margins which means im seeing the quality items that are slightly pricier head out door never to appear again and the lower end take that space. For well to do that irks me it may make sense for company as a whole but im shopping in one of their highest end area stores and if trend continues will be a big problem for me. don't want this to turn into a slightly upscaled sams club that would be a disaster. other ominous clouds are their fresh products go bad super fast in my experience. also preprepared foods are awful. again I get it they are kowtowing to lowest common denominator who like huge bulk low price screw the top quality. just not good for me.

COST AMZN WMT AAPL WILL BE LAGGING FROM THE REST BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SPENDING LESS MONEY NOW AND WILL BE FOR AWHILE
COST is stillUNDERVALUED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 400+++
It’s not A store! COST e-commerce covers the entire China with 1.5 billion ppl! Membership fee business model works best in this environment! COST will fill the position which AMZN can’t reach in China!
Implied move is +/- 3.2% following earnings based on the June 1st straddle.
People who have memberships will always keep them . Amazon will not and cannot change that. Oh ! My 3 kids need milk today do I wait to get it from amazon tomorrow ? No I shop for it today  also the average house hold is bigger today and the demographics have changed to a population with more kids . Costco will do just fine . Don't be worried
Kindly clarify which date is for special dividend. PR & SEC filing shows EOD December 2nd. If you are holder on December 2nd at the closing you are entitled for the special dividend. some says the date is November 30th. how can the date be different from SEC filing? Also as many stated here the price is expected to drop by $10 after the dividend date? what are your views? please help. I am planning to buy 300 shares on Dec. 2nd and plan to close my position on 3rd December before the market close.
"Awesome, no Friday sell-off for a change! LOL"
Target increased 238.00
Costco will have tough time in coming months....This is exactly what I have said earlier in the year that Costco is relying too heavily on retail stores and not on e-commerce...though with continued pandemic more users are moving away from Costco to Amazon and Walmart...Both Amazon and Walmart have tremendous online channels and super fast delivery....Costco has lot of catch up do and the Q1 2020 uptick in sales may not last...hope for the best for it;s investor...but be cautious...https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/01/why-costco-could-be-a-loser-in-the-e-commerce-boom.aspx
Quite surprised seeing Costco stock declining as much as it has. Didn't think it would happen tbh. Is it valuation? No interest anymore? Sector rotation into more valued stocks? Maybe as some here haven't mentioned....Costco should split it's stock.
Any words on official special dividend
Option market is showing this has more downside to it. But will add more shares if it tanks more..Costco is a good company ..
The sales numbers must be good. Up 5 AH.
"When you look at earnings, COST is not cheap. When you look at sales it is quite cheap..price to sales of 0.82 and enterprise value to sales of 0.81. PE doesn't tell the whole story and is often the most useless way to value a company."

More stores will be opened there for sure.The company's total revenue rose to $37.04 billion from $35.07 billion. Analysts, on average, had expected $37.25 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."
Dividen would be Nice
"a few months ago costco could shake off a bad day, or a weak earnings report..now it will just crumble."
"Have to love this stock as well as shopping there. I've owned the stock since the early 1990s with a cost basis in the single digits, so won't sell, so my kids can get a step up basis when I die, as I am 90. I have experience one of their stock splits and I think it is time for another so normal investors can buy a 100 share lot. Costco has been one of my better investments."
Cup and handle chart formation very bullish
Worldwide wholesaler that's NOT in CHINA and is growing double digits with 7% increase in US comps. NOW that is a BUY BUY BUY.....

"Diet Ice Tea. In Feb. Costco quit carrying diet ice tea which was a big seller. Was 9.75 for 35 bottles, and was great.I think it was greed that caused this to happen. Now they offer an organic ice tea-----some concept, how can you produce ""organic"" ice tea, sounds like bs to me. Bring back the $9.75 cases of diet ice tea."
why is yahoo showing this closed up $11..is that the special dividend they speak of
BJs misses = bad news for COST
Those who bought the dip will reap the rewards rest of the way !!!
Excellent company but Costco's stock is rather boring. I got in at $303 in the first half of 2020 and will be looking to sell once the stock sell will qualify for long-term capital gains treatment.

Expect the stock to go up steadily till 310 pre earnings and 320+ post earnings
A lot of selling don’t buy yet it’s still on a downward trend wait until it stabilized I think would be around 149 or 150 ....

At least Berkshire gave it some good news yesterday.
COST is strong and will bounce back sooner than later. All the Amazon hype is clearly an over-reaction.
"It is now time to start moving 401k's out of the market. Time for the people not to get screwed over by Wall Street for once. Sell at the top and not at the bottom.

its Friday...that means costco sell off day
boyah....costco is the best... up big tommorow
no company in the world can bet Costco's return policy. I watched a guy returned an old suitcase he bought 8 years ago and got full refund. beat that Amazon.
just got back from costco in Danbury ; the lot is full crazy shopping long queues ; the workers are so fast and my favorite is the 1.50 hot dog and soda i love it

"Market is rising, lots of green. DOW up, Jobs report ok. 4 analyst upgrades. Stock is recovering from ER. 295 today"
Nonsense reaction to earnings. lol
good company. but not worth buying the stock 33 times earnings.
"Moody's article out stating amazon actually weaker than Costco, walmart even best buy. Amazon while dominant in e-commerce, e-commerce only is 10% of retail. and their growth has been at the expense of profit. a good read."

"CostcoFor RBC Capital’s Scot Ciccarelli, Costco is a top pick in the retail space. On December 14, he maintained a Buy rating as well as a $439 price target (20% upside potential).According to Ciccarelli, “Costco just keeps doing it what it does best,” which is delivering strong sales growth and good margin performance. In its most recent quarter, the company posted comp growth of 17.1%, enabling it to generate strong leverage in fiscal Q1 2021, in the analyst’s opinion. E-commerce sales surged 86% and now account for roughly 7% of total sales.Even though U.S. comps moderated, Ciccarelli argues “this modest deceleration seemed to be driven by pull forward activity and… more aggressive Black Friday promotions starting as early as late-October from some competitors.” On top of this, gross margins reached 13.3% thanks to efficiency gains, labor productivity and significantly lower product spoilage in fresh foods.What’s more, Ciccarelli points out that Costco has the strongest buying power in the retail space because it concentrates all of its scale on a small group of SKUs, while its bigger competitors spread their buying power across millions of SKUs. Additionally, he thinks it has the lowest markup in the industry.“We believe this combination creates extremely compelling value for their members. As a result, while Costco has indeed benefitted from accelerated shopping activity as more consumer dollars are directed towards goods rather than services/experiences (what we call the Retail Lift), we believe Costco is extremely well positioned regardless of broader economic trends in 2021,” Ciccarelli opined."
At least 240 tomorrow
"The stock is clearly holding the $150 resistance level, time to get back in and ride it back up to $180!!"
Costco Wholesale reached an all time high at 355.09
"I think even if they beat earnings, the stock will tank because we are in a bear market."
Yesterday we also announced a material weakness concerning some aspects of our information systems. It relates to internal (employee and contractor) user access and the way that new or revised programs get put into operation. One example: sometimes IS people who changed jobs or positions did not have their access permissions updated quickly enough. We should have done a better job and have already begun remediation efforts. These issues did not result in mistakes in our financial statements. if anyone needed clarification from costco ceo
The street is looking post virus in which shoppers back to their normal shopping behaviors and stock is too expensive.I don't buy it and see earning beating street expectations on May 28.
is this really going to break through 300?
let's get that $20 spike
Wish COST would stop teasing me and just go up to $200 already.
let's have another $20 spike

I am assuming that the contracted GDP is hurting certain sectors such as consumer staples and not others. Rotation is into growth stocks and financials. Puzzling to say the least how the market perceives.
"The timing is the issue here... even if they beat earnings, the market looks to be smack dab in the middle of a correction. Even if this goes up AH, next week is going to be bloody as hell... Any jump in share price should be sold immediately tomorrow morning."
"If Costco stock does not do well in the long term, America is in a world of hurt. Great business modeland they have what everyone needs----- food!

"Same store sales missed consensus by some 21 million. Parking lot didn’t look good last night and consumers are postponing large ticket items, buying the more necessary items and presents for families. When homebuyers don’t buy a new house they don’t buy furniture, appliances, and new things to put into the garage. It just stands to reason."

be prepared...earnings will tank too..wall street wants too much from costco...yesterdays news should have this stock flying
the DIP today allows me to add more .
Targets are now over400.00
223 now
"IMHO, from a purely technical perspective, Costco is quite oversold on the daily and weekly charts and, given Friday's price action, the stock seems to have found a bottom at $307 and it is expected to bounce to $330 in the short term. Trading in the range of $310 to $320 or so meanwhile is a natural base building action. Good luck to all."

Inflation is when a company pays their people more than the average worker which in turn makes them pay more taxes but then they increase fees to purchase their products. That's what liberal outfits do. No one wins.

Why no movement???
"CRAMER says......BBBBUUUUYYYYYYYYYYCostco has a premium valuation for a good reason. The retailer has outperformed peers with its sales and earnings growth rate. We think that Costco could sustain mid to high-single-digit comps growth during the holiday season. Holiday sales forecasts set a bullish tone. We think that Costco, Target (TGT), and Walmart (WMT) could gain the most. Costco’s high membership renewal rate, expanded offerings, and price investments will likely draw higher traffic."
"Costco reminds me of McDonald’s. McDonald’s not only profits from selling Franchises, and profiting from selling food products. It creates cash flows for the Franchisees to pay McDonald’s properties. Since McDonald’s owns the restaurants, the appreciation of the real-estates boosts the bottom line of the company. Analysts tend to compare Costco with other Big Box Retailers like Walmart. However, Costco business model is different than the others Retailers. Costco profit on products sold is very thin. It does not offer a large variety of products but it offers popular products. As a result, the products move very fast at a very large volume. The large volume helps to make up the thin margin. Costco’s profit is actually on the membership that it collects. So, when Costco sales numbers goes up, the profit that it makes is not really from the sales. It actually means that there are more new members (paying membership fees) shopping.Both companies have a niche. Costco’s business model seems to be working well. All the new Costco Store that are opening overseas are doing very well. There should be a lot of growth for Costco for expanding its footprint all over the world much like McDonald’s. While Costco is not bulletproof as it would go down if or when the market crashes but unless the world is ending, it would come back up. Personally, I am not sure I did the right thing to buy Costco. While I’ve made more than 20% from Costco, I liquidate Gold Bullion Coin to raise the cash. Gold appreciated more than 30+% after I sold. I consider Gold and Costco are both good long-term investments. Gold is more of an insurance and Costco is for growth. I have no regret buying Costco. Good luck to all the longs."
"Costco , as of May 6th is making it MANDATORY that you can only enter the store wearing a mask. That's the end of me being a share holder of Costco. I refuse to shop at a store that forces me to wear a facemask. This will hurt the business, regardless if your a Snowflake or not. God bless the United States of America!"

Can anyone shed any light on what costcos dividened will be quarterly after the special $10 payout?
EARNINGS WILL BE HUGE !!!!
"Buy any dip. They are expected to announce an increase in their dividend in April, along with JNJ."
I hope this stays around $345 all week! BIG earnings beat expected next week. E Commerce thru the roof!
Consolidation is over. You better cover shorty. See the rest of you at $270
JUST OUTCostco set to open new store in China's Suzhou cityREUTERS 7:42 AM ET 4/9/2020
New Target 210.00way undervalued here.
market is up and Costco is down...amazing how investors react to someone's analysis....it will bounce back
More bad Virus news the higher COST goes........................
bought at 166.59 holding for earnings
"Hey Hairbag and Harrigo- how do ya like the old COST now? Did you guys bail before the $14+ bump today? As the guy starring up at Dirty HARRY's .357 once said...""I just gots ta know...."""
Greeeeen
"I just left Costco (to buy toilet paper; they had been out all week) and I've never seen such lines in my life! (Kansas City, MO). I'm in today at $282!"
"A lot of people moving their money into BJ’s. Costco is of course the industry leader but from a value and growth perspective, BJ’s fairs much better especially with their expansion plans going forward and comp metrics."
Look for the dips as another BUY opportunity here.
"this is a beat just not a huge one, I think people are confusing the numbers and not accounting for the membership numbers"
Selling at the news ?
Look for breakout over316.00
buying when the market crash coming should be about 100 dollar stock
"I only come to this conversation group for entertainment as most of the people that post here have absolutely no idea what they are doing or saying and just come here to cry. Yes, the COST stock has been declining for over three months now, but I have been there with many other good quality stocks and they all have rebounded sooner or later. And so will COST. It’s just a matter of time. IMO, this is a great opportunity to make a 20% upside before the year end here. If you are not patient enough, or want bigger or quicker gains, then this stock is not for you. Cheers to all longs!"
"It is the holiday, week of Christmas. The midst of a global wide pandemic that is accelerating. The end of the year. The special dividend that all of you have been carrying on about needing has happened. Let it rest. Calm down. You should be in it for the long haul anyway....right?!"
Friday typical sell off
No special dividend this time. Costco is investing their Trump tax break on their employees!! Other companies should follow their lead. I’m still hopeful on a special dividend payout.
BREAKING ...out !!!!!with nice Volume !
Dollar general smashed earnings today and the stock took a beating. CSCO disappointed earnings so that means it will go up?
Great buying opportunity to pick up some COST shares! Good luck all!
may buy under $200 next week
COSTCO is now in a triple-bottom (bullish reversal) pattern. Not a double but a triple. Any break above resistance and it heads right back toward $230/shr..
shouldnt be a dip here...should just be a steady green day up around $10 after the nice earnings
UBS’s Michael Lasser reiterated a Buy rating and $270 price target on the shares Friday.
It’s actually opposite. Recession means more business for Costco as people look for savings. Bernstein is wrong.
unbelievable! down almost $10 in premarket...everyone was thinking we would be up at least $10...makes no sense numbers are very good
Time to buy BOX
Target upgraded !!!!!!
Oppenheimer BUYING here today !what a bunch of SCAMS !
will jump more when increasing membership fee. reasonable after mini wage increase.

"Revenues up on stockpiling, but bottom line missed. Can you just imagine how bad the following quarter will be? I’m not taking a chance. Selling here."
"Investors,Today 11/30/2020 is the last day to buy and hold until tomorrow 12/1/2020 to get $10 special dividend!"
Keep buying ...numbers are great...shows you analyst are bad at predicting.
any guess of tomorrow's earning?
"looks like it is closing below $303, I hope you longs sold when I told you"
No reason for the stock to drop. The same BS as the rest of the market going down.
Cramer saw I made $1100 profit on Costco over the last 6 months. I guess he wants his share now.
Going to 270 in a hurry and the special dividend on top of that !!!!
"Do not panic, time to add more!"
"got in at $390...then it cashed, its making a nice rebound, but im still in the red."
They are looking at considering another SPECIAL Divi........................................thanks to TAX CUTS.....................
When are the monthly sales numbers coming out?
IM LOADING UP WHILE PEOPLE SELL LOL
Costco was a little over 100 a few months ago now 160 people crying about a little dropwell the drop is justified because there is going to be a huge price war between walmart kroger aldis and amazon and costco is going to suffer from this.It is going back to 100 so you better get out as it is overpriced and overhyped retail sales fell .3% and now you have the above mentioned price wars squeezing marginsDon't liste to pumpers who want to sell their shares to you get out asao or lose your gains !
You guys all know it's gonna tank no matter what even after a huge beat.... Don't you see the pattern?
Just bought 40 shares. First time shareholder here. GLTA
"Buy the COST dip today, make some easy money this week if you do options at all. Buy 100 shares of Costco now, and sell a Jan 22nd $355 strike price covered call for an immediate $230 premium received now....plus make about another $100 to $200 if your shares sell of this Friday. Scale this up for every 100 shares you buy. You're welcome!"
Costco apparently has a company policy where they say they award their shareholders. What a FYI king joke.
makes no sense to be a long term investor in this anymore....70 cent dividend is all it can offer
KING DOLLAR rules.....................................
"Fair Value = $200, Buffett was right"
Don't see this PE Ratio (TTM) 37.46 too high?
"When I can buy gas, prescription drugs, have my tires changed, eyeglasses, cheap gift cards and get photos printed and ink cartridges refilled for cheap at the local Whole Foods store, then I will sell my COST stock and get a Prime membership. Until that happens, Amazon with Whole Foods will not put the slightest dent in COST business and member #'s."
Wow straight down day again! There is no hope for this stock...down 13% YTD all red days so far
Costco continues to be one of the dominant warehouse retailers !Buy and HOLD heretarget 340.00-350.00
All u negatives will be the first to change tune when this turns around and passes $350.
"I wonder if anyone noticed that at 9:52 am the volume spiked over 141k and the price was at $370.57 on a downtick. Price went up after this trade. So, it appears someone executed a buy order. Take a look at the chart, this is clearly visible. At about $370, 141k shares is a lot of money. Any idea or speculation on what is going on?"
"Free delivery on orders over 35.00 plus tip to the driver. Wife has avoided going shopping in public. I'm happy camper, the M&M's are on the way. Just have to stay long with COST."
COST top pick for 2021
Now that I sold At 307 this pos is moving north
Is Costco under-priced or is Amazon over-priced? Why is Costco just 10% of Amazon's value? I'm thinking it should be 25% of it at least???
"only being down .50 in this bad down day says something for cost, good buy right now, great company"
I'm seriously canceling my memberships until they can begin to show the shareholders some respect
My guestimate is July sales will equal or exceed June sales as far as %age increase.
"Costco has a HUGE brand name, it would continue to beat the competition in retail.As regards online sales, Costo hasn't scratched the surface yet. Just think how great an online and the retail combination would be a killer!!!"
CEO needs to go bye bye
"down $3.. expected better? sold earlier today to generate cash, but I'll buy back tommorrow..."
sorry shorts.......you BURNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
we need that Santa claus rally..
"I love this company, always beats!"
I guess we have to see what it going to happen Monday.
This separates the men from the boys. Who's got the balls to buy and hold long term.
"I saw somebody returning a $2000+ patio set recently, nothing visibly wrong aside from it had obviously been left out in the elements since bought. At some point, Costco will need to put a stop to that nonsense. It's one thing to have a liberal return policy, it's another to let yourself be taken advantage of."
"the market up so much today, costco should be up $10.or more..but no its slumping..numbers have been leaked..not looking forward to a bigger crash tomorrow after the Dec earnings come out"
"Common.... October 4th, great earnings report and break the all time high once again OH YEAHHH!!!!!!"
will sales from the coronavirus panic be factored into the earnings this week or not until the next one?
Remember past history..COST always BOUNCES back !great entry.
"This is a quality stock. Should double in the next decade. Imagine having $248 billion in cash, expect record sales, and real estate prices are low and interest free loans available. After this pandemic, Costco will continue to be a pristine business. Remember guys your not buying a price ticker, you are buying a business!"
"This store is jam packed 24/7, how's this drop even possible?"
"Interesting how everyone expects it to go down after earnings, however option call buyers have never been bigger and put buyer are very small. Can anyone explain this to me? Thanks."
Targets are ALL over 400+++
I sold Netflix to buy Costco. At the moment I'm not sure that was the wisest move. Personally I love Costco as a store and go there as often as I can.
"I am very pleased with my Costco shopping experience. I have taken full advantage of having an executive membership along with having and using the new CITI visa card. My wife and I send an average of about $200 a week including gas. We have, in the past have gone way above that average with big purchases of furniture, t.v.'s , vacations etc. I use the VISA everytime and pay it off each month. My executve check averages anywhere for $200 - $400 each year while my VISA check(used to be AMEX) is anywhere from $300-$900 each year depending on shopping needs. My wife and I have decided to always buy at Costco our items first, other retailers second if Costco cant meet our needs. We were a family of 4, now the kids are both in college so we have tweeked our purchases a bit. Costco is a very smart business model, their rebates on their memberships as well as their CITI Visa are outstanding. Just getting the 2% on Costco purchases is a smart way to shop. I receive 2% with executive and another 2% using the Citi Visa, then pay of the balance each month. Also 4% on gasoline at Costco as well as any other major gas retailer. Yes, you still need to be disciplined on your shopping each month, so you do not over spend, but if you manage your money well, Costco has given everybody a great way to save money on quality goods and services while giving you great cash rewards each year. Come to find out that the T.V. that I purchased also get an extended 2 additional years on top of the mfg's warranty because I charged with my Costco CITI VISA. My point about all of this is that not only has Costco been a great place to shop, its business model to the consumer has been outstanding for prices, quality, return policy, and rebates. I will receive nearly $1000 from last years shopping between the 2 checks( 1 from CITI Visa, 1 from Costco for being an executive member). And all of that doesn't even take in account all of those ""instant"" rebates off on items that I buy on a monthly basis anyway. Its just a great place to shop, and they make my shopping experience an exceptional one. Way to go Costco!! Keep up the good work!!"
"HUGE BEAT, HA HA HA"
I'll take these prices yippee
"If Target beat, COST will have blowout earnings. E-commerce is screaming. Forget Amazon."
"Nobody buying the $1500 patio dining set, keep seeing the CDC warning sign. Opex looks near $302.50 around there so no big movement, unless China sanctions are applied."
Beat on both earnings and revenue. Should be good day tomorrow
profit taking in droves is imminent .. give it 2-6 wks
Under 200 soon. MM'S will take it there. Typical Manipulation
"What is Kirkland, why Jeff Bezo what it to buy that?"
"Cowen Boost COST PT to $214, maintains Outperform rating.Source: StreetInsiderSummary: Cowen raised its price target on Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) to $214.00 (from $182.00) while maintaining a Outperform rating. Analyst Oliver Chen said they were impressed with strong digital and physical traffic & comps, and better than feared core merch. margins despite a difficult operating environment."
400 eom. Easy.
A H 299.20
Wow....this market is crazy! Wish I could’ve bought a boatload when market was 300+ down :(
"Its not COST. People are buying tech and new sectors - weed, bitcoin, EV, etc."
"Kirkland xo $46.99 aged 12 to 21 yrs, Kirkland 27 yrs blended Scotch whiskey $49.99 , cheap gas and organic food. Sorry amazon, this is the reason Costco gets 10% of my $50k salary every year."
"Long lines at the pumps, long lines at the registers, parking lots are full, food court is full, sampling stations everywhere, overall great quality merchandise at good prices, membership pays for itself. What's not to like."
One of the best run companies in the world!Just ask Charlie Munger
"I’m not knocking Costco, love them. But people are lined up to buy dry staples. Many of them are lost leaders, decent margins etc but it’s not like 60% of the other goods are flying."
Extremely undervalued. Be prepared for a squeeze up this week.
"stopped in to my local costco yesterday to go to phone kiosk, gas lines, swamped parking lots, oh my is it busy in irvine ca"
"The revenue beat is by 7% approx, that's absolutely GREAT!On the profit part, If you look at the numbers closely, 'Selling, general and administrative' expenses have gone up, which may be due to COVID issues.Overall as long as revenues are going up -WE ARE GOOD!!!!!"
"I have some LEAP calls on this. Was considering selling today on the rise but didn't, even though I figured COST would disappoint.Normally I don't want to hold options though earnings but this time I did. Why? Because this market is a casino.There are companies releasing terrible earnings and going up, companies releasing great earnings and going down.No one has any clue what is going to happen. WMT got smashed on great earnings.All you can do in this market now is roll the dice, or stay out of it completely!"
its a beat!
The gyration in the price has multiplied by 5 times on a weekly basis. It is one of the few retail stocks not taken out behind the woodshed and been slashed in half. The short interest on this stock is only 1.5% of float. Nothing to help it go up so if it doesn't hold around 220 watch out below. With this ah action I would say the chances are good this one will go the way of the others and drop 20 - 30 % within the next 2 months or so. I was actually hoping for a pop on good earnings in the morning and go short for the trip down mid morning or so. It could still happen BUT not likely now.
Giving back yesterday's $5 gain.
buying on these crazy dips.
Ya'll forget they make a large part of their revenue from their membership. I guarantee those numbers will be high
Membership numbers up 7% in the middle of a pandemic. Damn good.
Sorry to those that shorted at close
Train leaving shortly.................................
wow!! great buying opportunity..
"I think this stock is way overvalued by 23%, I did some forward earnings estimated and next year with a positive outlook the stock should trade close the 167.03"
rigged...no one is selling
COST is NOT in China! Hahahaha. BUY BUY BUY its headed to $300 only place to shop and get fresh food at cheap pricing.
If you don’t want temporary headaches stay away from Costco for now. It will probably bottom around 355.
BUFFET loves COST as well he says.
All time high today.
"Stupid People. continually post about having their fingers in their bums and make references to mano-a-mano activities. Kind of what Grimbelina does on a daily basis. Better erase it, ya l'il sissy, I know it made you pout."
Presidents don't affect the the economy. doesn't matter if the orange man Trump or dementia creepy Joe win. COSTCO will be a $500 stock by sometime in 2021.
need increase annual membership fee to boost the stock price. let announce the change after earnings report.
Love my steady climber.
YES YES PICKED UP MORE SHARES AT LOWER PRICE THANK YOU GUYS
CEO said no plans for a special dividend. I hope they raise their quarterly dividend alot.
I bought in at 352...and I thought that was a good buy..it kept dipping..not sure ill ever get even again.
rise rise rise rise rise rise rise rise
I've been investing in Costco for last 7 years. A lot. To the point of OCD. Love that company. I've seen drops like that before. Perfect time to buy. They open 10-12 stores a year. Renewal rate is 93%. Happy Holidays everyone! Special Dividend in 2019!
the Fundamental advantage Costco has over Amazon is the price of value. Amazon doesn't get that for the price of Whole Foods.
"Question: What if we buy 1000S of Costco today, just to be on record to get 1k dividends ...and cash it out 2-3 days later, do we still receive dividends?"
"This stock is way over sold. The three Costco in my area are always crowded. With the holidays just around the corner, this stock will recover and move higher."
Still haven't received the $10 special dividend in my Schwab account. Has anyone received it in their Schwab account yet?
Traders are selling on the news. Happens every ER. Have you ever been to a Costco that was slow?
"With earnings around the corner, and the BOD paying out over $4billion for this special dividend, should we not be expecting them to beat expectations?"
"All MAs go green, according to stoxline. Looking for breakout at 195.35 with a short term target of 228.17."
"The media is all in on the 'short and distort'. Where is the SEC? Oh right, freedom of press. Only it doesn't apply to anyone with a conservative bend."
Expecting a 50% drop based not only on poor performance but a dim future of a retailer who can not compete with Amazon. oh well going to dump shares but at least I bought in at 160.
Went to Costco once Never went back Don’t understand appeal
COST will surpass 400 before the upcoming ER on March 4th!
WOW sales up 11.5 percent in June !!!!!!!
"The beauty of Costco opening up in places like China is how they can just ignore Trump. Costco doesn't manufacture much - they do put the Kirkland name on a few items, but the world over loves the Costco way."
"For anyone who can't read or like to fabricate, Costco beat the street by 4 cents for what it's worth. LOLBy the way, Dollar General SMASHED the street this morning and is getting punished as stocks do at times.Costco (ticker: COST) said it earned $1.89 a share on revenue of $37.3 billion. Analysts had been predicting earnings per share of $1.85 on revenue of $36.55 billion."
I love Costco and its stockfrom South Korea.Always people are crowded and...as long as I know Costco gains +30% revenue than last year(Korea)Anyway We love to go and shop in Costco
I'm actually at Costco right now. I'm line for cheap gas. Then going in for some shopping and a hot dog! TGIF!!!
"By the end of today, COST should cross 374."
Targets are now over400.00+
COST not getting killed by Amazon Whole Foods pricing strategy?
delayed earnings is normally a missed earning and/or low guidance. Believe it!
I'm on vacation. Going to check out the Denver Costco. Such a great company that is fun to go visit different state Costco's. Not many sticks have that
Expect a large large jump up next week. Earnings are done and now all the is over. There is no need for this heading down. Would not shock me is we see a $10...$15 or even $20 up day!! Everything is factored in....whatever it was that drove this down. Even Buffett news!
11 days ago I said it’d be over 300 in less than a month. A lot of doubters.
Attention Costco shoppers: To the moon!
Cramer continues to buy the DIPS......................................look for opportunities.........................
COST...If you liked it at $393 you could really love it at $314. Really sad that a great company has just been hammered so badly.
Next stop 320..
"Don't give up on COST so easily! In addition to being a good long-term investment, its fundamentals are quite solid for this quarter, which indicates that there may still be a correction and a good appreciation in the short term (before the earnings date, March 4)."
"Costco Wholesale Corporation make high bid offer buy out U.S. milk processor Dean Foods Co. Dairy Farmers of America Inc, the biggest U.S. dairy cooperative, is in advanced talks to acquire U.S. milk processor Dean Foods Co. But other would-be buyers could emerge.While discussions are taking place between DFA and Dean, no agreement has been reached for the purchase of all or some of the Dallas-based company’s assets, Monica Massey, executive vice president and chief of staff at DFA, said in an emailed response to questions. She didn’t speculate on prospective bidders.A deal could be a lengthy process, including an antitrust review. Any transaction would require an “extensive review of Dean Foods’ assets, thorough due diligence and other conditions, including approval from the Department of Justice and the Bankruptcy Court,” Massey said. Dean intends to file bidding procedures with the court to conduct a sale."
Anyone knows when will be the special dividend to be given? Thanks

"They say, buy the stock of the products you like. I really like those $1.50 hot dogs. Going long COST."
"Is this a let it run a little more, then sell ahead of earnings type play?"
Still hasn’t hit a mill in volume and it’s down.. I ain’t selling.
Buy COST here at these levels..............................150-153.00 a STEAL !!!!!you will see in couple of months the recovery hereMARK MY WORDS !
Take some profits herejmho
"JPMorgan analysts. ""Moreover, we continue to believe a special dividend is coming ($18.5 per share in total cash on hand)."""
It’s a day to go harass your local Costco employee. I’m gonna cause chaos at the store today!
"Buy COST on weakness.......................its way undervalued here.see you in 6 months 170""s"
"I don't own any Costco stock, but I shop there regularly. Wouldn't buy a thing from Amazon. I like to touch what I am buying. People that buy from Amazon, are just to lazy to get off their dead #$%$, and go to the store."
"Down 2.07% as of 11:36 am, but compared to, BAC, GE, and many others etc which r down 4 and 5%, COST is hanging in there"
It broke the 240 support It’s next support level is 215This will tank hard tomorrow
"""Pullbacks in this high-quality wholesale - especially on forced S&P 500 selling/broader market weakness - are long-term buying opportunities,"" said Jim Cramer and the Action Alerts PLUS team, which holds Costco in its portfolio."
my biggest regret was tesla i bought it at 30 for 1000 shares 7 yrs ago.
This one just hit its 67% fib retracement levels
North of 300 will be the time to accumulate in my opinion
"clears 4B for first time, goes down anyway https://www.marketwatch.com/story/costco-clears-4-billion-in-earnings-for-first-time-amid-record-growth-but-the-stock-is-falling-11600979558?mod=mw_latestnews"
The Market will turn GreenCost will fly
"Let's hope that next week continues the rally back to all time highs. This stock has been an absolute dog, after the Amazon/Whole Foods merger. Hoping for the best for my June 2018 $168 strike calls, which are finally in the green again, up 11%"
BJ'S is another that beat analysts expectations and traded down as they didn't issue guidance. I'm seeing a definite trend here.
Was suppose to be only 4% and this is a huge beat.
"Costco is also significantly limiting the number of members (customers) allowed in their warehouses at any time,crimping sales. the future earnings will be impacted by not only a drop in sales volume but as much, if not more so, from a shift towards more low-margin items such as toilet paper, water & essential food items (milk, eggs, meat, etc..) away from higher-margin goods & services such as TVs, furniture, vacation packages, etc.."
people still think robinhood affect stocks and not institutions(which iwn 80% of all shares of everythinf)
Costco will go to 270 when Trump has his coronary. Hopefully very soon.
"Costco was $393 in December and today it’s $328?! Is this a buy point, or is it time to hit the exit?!"
Internal weakness controls ? What does that mean ?
Why down
"next.....""special dividend"",lol"
Costco is a terrific defensive stock to hold
Just love the MANIPULATION on COST................................Glad I raised some $$$ able to get Bargain prices.
"Just got back from Costco Plano (Dallas) TX. Shoppers everywhere and TVs/products flying out the door. And for a Friday night that’s pretty good. So to me, if big business would stop canceling meetings/conferences/!travel we would be just fine as the consumer hasn’t stopped yet. Jmho."
Safe haven in the covid era. Costco is taking care of business.
The Buy Back amount will be very interesting. They usually always get it right. Just wait and see. You will be impressed.
"For the record, I'm down 10% overall in Costco. Still gonna hold. Still gonna add more over time."
"Daughter teaches at a nearby international school that was evacuated during the opening rush. School cancelled tomorrow, cars lined up for miles waiting for the next show. Crazy...Chinese are just like us"
COST is no AMZN so dont expect any big moves up. It rarely happens.
"Why is this stock not fallen, I am sure sales is not going to meet estimates due to the lack of shoppers... Just a thought."
"Costco is killing the traditional supermarket industry. I worked in the supermarket industry for 30 years and have been a Costco customer since I retired 4 years ago. During snowbird season you can hardly get in the store in Naples, Florida. I look at the mix of product in the carts and about 90% of what I see was formerly sold in traditional supermarkets. The order sizes are huge. Their labor hours are much lower than traditional supermarkets. I invested in Costco in a very small way just a couple months ago. It is a long term hold for me and I am an active investor. I will trade around my small position. People like going to Costco. The clientele in stores where I shop (St. Louis area) is notches above Wal Mart (and I would assume Sam's--but I don't shop at Sam's). Supermarkets are struggling to maintain even same store sales while Costco has had pretty solid numbers. Rambling a bit, but I like the Company and my investment."
These days market is controlled by cellphone gamblers who needs immediate return..No reason for this to fall..BUY if you are long term investor.
Keep buying on every opportunity!!!
"I don't look at everyday,I look at the over all pandemic news,instead.I have feeling it will double, with in 2to 3 1/2 yrs."
"Doesn’t seem to matter when I go to Costco, there are lots of people buying. I noticed this 11 years ago and bought some stick and have held onto it. It’s been my best stock investment."
"interesting down 2 today,,,,wow,, very weak now"
why is this down?
I got in on COST at $303/share back in March 2020 but am thinking about selling for the following reasons; a) PE ratio of 36 is too high; b) the stock price goes up and down for no apparent reason; c) COST already paid out the $10/share special dividend so one cannot expect another payout in the near future. Thoughts?
Anyone know why this stock dropped from $186 today?
This isn’t going anywhere till Dec 1
BIG beat coming.
"Costco has very good management and relation with the upcoming generation(s), I expect it to continue to go up in the long run."
Can’t wait for March sales member
Kroger much better for shopping with lot more room to run. Warren buying Kroger (KR) selling Costco.
Stock will only rise as pandemic gets worse and worse over the next few months.I noted that Kleenex and paper towels had sold out again!This is Pandemic Phase Two and Costco will be a major benefactor.Past few weeks have been frustrating.
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sacs analyst give this stock a PT of $410 and higher very recently.
We will see $170 by Christmas. This company is in deep doo doo.
Hmm this company doesn't really care about shareholders.
You can't ignore the fact that almost everyone I know loves Costco. Keep the good job!
"It's always packed when I shop in costco, I don't understand why stock down, so frustrated"
Price Target $330Costco adds another bull
special dividend. who cares.It just comes out of the share price doesnt it ?
Such a resilient stock. Amazing.
Stocks going to crash if they don't fix their delivery problem with overcharges.
down $20 tomorrow
I going to take a flyer here- I'll bet a cookie that it goes to even by market open in the morning and green tomorrow...come on-who wants to bet a cookie
Big scam by Bernstein. They get the price down and then buy in. Jail all these manipulators
215 next week before 2019 225..non stop customers wish they would increase prices 10% across board. people will still shop
Entire market in free fall and this hasn't blinked. Very impressive.
Sector rotation started ...for Q2 back into COST .
Costco needs more love hopefully the market doesn't drag it down after earnings
"Since the tax rate on dividends and long term capital gains are the same (who know for how long) , I would prefer the special dividend because I can deploy the after tax proceeds into investments that potentially yield a return better than that paid on cash. What is Costco, Apple etc. making on their large cash hoards? Could their shareholders find other higher value uses for that money? If you hold it in a retirement account the tax issue becomes moot. If you have a non-retirement account, then you get a cash dividend and the money is there to pay the tax. Also, depending on your other income, you may pay no tax on the qualified dividends and capital gains (see the qualified div. and cap. gain worksheet in your 1040 instructions.) Whether you root for a special dividend or not depends on which side can deploy that money into its highest rate of return."
What a rip off when you order delivered by Insta cart from Costco. The delivery person has been told not to give you a receipt and if they miss an item you get charged for it anyway. Talked to store manager and had I picked up my order it would have been $92 but I paid $138 with Insta Cart.
BURN shorts BURN......................................no competition to COST says CEO.
watch...stock market rages today...costco loses again
"Whole Foods is another regular grocer while Costco model is much different and it is not easy to imitate.Some one tell me which of following can whole foods can do:In 2017, Costco sold1- 9.9 million tires2- 6.1 m pair of glasses3- 2.5 m dress shirt4- 584 m prints and pictures5- 43 m prescriptions5- 87 m Rotisserie chickens6- 135 m hot dog and soda7- 176000 carats of diamonds8- $1.8 Billion wine9- $1.5 Billion TVs10- $1.6 B bakery11- millions of GAS. And many other things that whole foods is not design to do or completely different to imitate.I think Costco is adding more and more stuff like furnitures, phones, appliances, books...The next is carwash."
Nobody loves this stock today. All went to tech. So sad 
The view is spectacular up here.
"At a PE of 41, I don’t think it’s a good buy yet. I’ll just keep waiting."
Wait for Costco’s earnings on May 28th. I am holding until then. We will be rewarded from their revenue boost !!!
I'm torn between buying another share or 200 hot dogs in the food court.
could see 310.00-312.00 soon
"COST ""Upgraded"" 200++++++++++++++++++++ for 2018buy while its cheap as AMAZON is in NO competition here."
"There might just be a monster option play developing with COST. If we come back to the $360's support before earnings, this could be an incredible explosion to/through $400 by next CC. IMO, COST is going to improve each month through December. The overall excitement will calm down after January."
"Great earnings, as usual, as expected..,,"
"It's St. Patrick's Day, so let's go green!"
"I am a Costco member but cannot buy because the lines are long and not managed properly.The social distancing is not maintained in the line formed at the Costco near me.Unfortunately ,The Costco website technology is not advanced and it is almost impossible to buy fresh items from Costco. The instacart that Costco uses never provide any delivery time to buy!I am wondering why I should keep my membership."
"I pick up some call today, and bet on earnings on Thursday. I know it beats the estimate but in this situation, everybody said it is too high valuation. I DON'T MINE."
Wait until Elon Musk's tweet about COST : )
230 is a support....
Earnings in 2 days.... Earnings - Dec 10 AMC. I see Costco is always full !!
Costco is the best they said. Profitable stock they said. Down thousands now from my purchase point.
$COST Target Lowered by Robert W Baird Outperform USD 410 » USD 395 Target Lowered by Oppenheimer Holdings Top Pick » Outperform USD 400 » USD 350 Target Lowered by Telsey Advisory Group Outperform USD 430 » USD 375 Target Lowered by Wells Fargo Equal Weight USD 360 » USD 340
Futures Green Anylist upgrading buy price over 400 lets hope that rubs off on costco this week i need my calll options to at least give me my money back lol
This whole situation doesn't make sense. Costco won't be affected by anything involving Amazon/WF. It is 2 different biz models. Costco's growth plans are aggressive and double-digit growth is foreseeable for the next 5 years. Tonight they post June sales. We'll see what the market thinks about that.
UP UP and away.........................................E commerce up over 5%
See 250 this week on earnings announcement that does not meet the high expectations.
"Biggest analysis change yett!!Analyst Actions: Jefferies Upgrades Costco Wholesale to Buy From Hold, Adjusts Price Target to $435 From $321"
After close today will hit 52 wks high...
With Sam's club closing...maybe this is an opportunity for Costco to pick up some locations CHEAP??
NO split just higher.
No buyers today.
Its going green.
ate earnings today in 30 mins?
way undervalued. saw that article on whole food today?
"BUY THE WAY ( hahahahahaha ) , YES I DID BUY IT TODAY AT $151.50...IM HAPPY.....WISH ME L.U.C.K.!!!!"
"Just LOADED the boat with Costco stock and Shorted AMZN. There's a reason that WHF profits have been declining over the past several quarters. Simply put, even the wealthy don't like being had when it comes to pricing and (implied) quality. Don't wait for the crowd to figure this out. Short AMZN / Long COST"
so cheap
Target310.00
if it goes sub 300 im back in..
"Up 10C AH, It's running!!!!!!!"
this stock is a sure thing. Other than a bit of a drop when Amazon bought wholefoods they alway increase in value and the dividend is not bad
Looking for more SILLY dips to add to positions.....................COST always rebounds.....................................
Bought all the adult diapers I could find today at Costco !!!
"$1,200 check for each adult will be sending out by the government in April. This means people will spend less money on everything and layoffs already start across the country"
Keep selling so I can keep buying more at a discount please 
STILL HIGH PE OVER 33. AVERAGE RETAIL IS UNDER 30. THAT MEANS ANOTHER 30 40 POINTS LOWER. 310 ANYONE ??? GREAT TIME FOR ANOTHER EMPLOYEE WAGE INCREASE. HOW ABOUT A MID YEAR BONUS ??? GENIUS MANAGEMENT. WHAT ARE THEY THINKING ?
Does anyone know whether the cost in China is open?
What is Costco’s motivation for declaring a special dividend? Why would they do it? (I know they’ve done it in the past)
some said they were selling @ $310 I think they sold to soon.
Buy under300.00
"Because of kale and avocados cost is down 5%? Or another way to look at it is,, Some very nasty hedge funds want to keep it under 160 at all means.. But Costco has a crazy good quarterly report coming..How are the going to keep it from 163? hmm"
"if anything, I thing the concern is Chinese tariffs, 99% of products."
"TRUMP starting to ""REASON"" now about trade war deals ."
"cost, HD, wmt and low have 50percent down, their price raise so high was very surprising, because their p/e too high and profit margin too low, all things price have peaked, so all things price will go down in future, plus people trending shopping online,"
When will volume pick up?
Costco is just a bulk grocery store with overpaid cashier and bag boys . I’m still not selling
Target is 238.+++++
"costco is a great stock, just heavily controlled by wall st. I joined AMC in hopes to get back at wall st. a little anyway"
The WMT opiod challange keep the sector in check. COST has no thing to worry about.
If Trump would quit the markets would stabilize
people just used this company..they bought into the $10 divvy...and sold off..putting the stock in a tailspin
"Missed by a penny an engineered loss by the analysts as revenue exceeded estimates, all the tight stop loss triggered and look who is waiting to buy at the bottom."
We ordered 4 bags of large dog food. They delivered within an hour and cheaper than Amazon.
"Another one! One of these days we'll be seeing the $400+ numbers and some!Oppenheimer Adjusts Price Target on Costco Wholesale to $425 From $400, Maintains Outperform Rating"
"A hearty congratulations, Grimmikins. You're now officially $50 per share underwater on your imaginary short at $113.The simple fact that you won't acknowledge your folly simply proves my point over and over and over........You're a fibbin', l'il sissy..........."
All uphill froM here
Costco dead after morning rush. Traffic must be down significantly!
Anyone know when the div will be declared ?
EPS actually beat.... they got taxed which they are protesting. Could have an EPS over 2.60
Why did I sell at the close??????
Wait for PANIC SELLING...............................................then do some buying ....................
$325 on Friday ! MARK IT !!!
Buy the Dip!
POSITIVE THINKING: RISE RISE RISE RISE
The lower it goes ...the HARDER it BOUNCES back !
Should be between 240-260 in the coming months. Solid company
It's not normal
"Train is leaving soon , loading up ."
"Costco is a healthy, pandemic-proof business! They grow earnings year after year, and will continue to do so. This is a good time to buy more."
After hours trading ($314) puts Costco at a 20% downfall from it's highs. Still doubt it will fall below $300 Nope!
"It's days like today with the Nas going down and Costco going up that keep reminding me how much ""I LOVE MY COSTCO SHARES""!OH, and my DG shares!"
"My average price is $41.86. But I started buying Price club shares converting to PriceCostco shares to Costco shares.  Love, Love, Love Costco"
SHORTS gonna get BURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRNED !!!!
"Anyone short this stock? 31x for a mature retailer. I love Costco, one of the best run retailers if not the best of all American history. As a takeoff on $20 is $20, 31X is 31X . I can not believe this has a chance to outperform the market the next 10 years."
Any dips here is a BUY opportunity !
Costco has dropped $60 since January 1. This 15% falloff puts us into correction territory folks.
We predicted this huge move. Strong Buy. https://cweb.com/costco-is-back-and-possible-dividend-ahead-cweb-com/
"Charlie's favouriteAn interesting side note is that Charlie Munger (Trades, Portfolio) is on the board of directors for Costco (and has been since 1997), and owns over 180,000 shares in the company. While this is not a reason to buy a stock (always do your own research and never blindly follow anyone, regardless of their track record) it makes sense that Munger would like Costco -- it is mature businesses with great customer loyalty and very sensible management."
Sold $COST and $TSLA two weeks ago to have cash in case of a dip. Doubled my position on $BABA yesterday and increased $EWY. Thanks Kim
"Did some research today. It looks like Costco will drop a little more before coming back up. At the end of the year it should be over 400. However, only God knows what will happen."
MASSIVE BEAT!!! CONGRATS
Your love keeps lifting me higher & higher than I've ever been lifted before. Costco and its new dividend increase rocks!
This will be a stock to buy during the recession
"This is all about guidance. I went through earnings with TGT. They had a beat and nice comp sales, digital sales up 141% but after the initial surge she sold off. No guidance was given in the cc and WS didn’t like it I guess. Still struggling to get back to the pre-earnings numbers."
"Costco said February comparable sales rose 11.7%, excluding the impact of fuel and currency fluctuations. The company added that concerns related to the coronavirus outbreak had boosted comparable sales by about 3%.The company has lately been seeing customers queue up at its stores, much like they do during the holiday season, to stock up on essentials, including disinfectants, paper towels and soups, as they prepare for potential coronavirus quarantines. (Reporting by Praveen Paramasivam in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri)"
its incontrovertible....2020 election for POTUS was STOLEN.
any weakness is a BUY opportunity.
Down 14% YTD. I don’t think I have ever seen it gain that much in a year’s time. Absolutely 
Pre market is red but it will turn green by 10:30 this morning. Not too worry because shortie are not too interested in this stock. It’s just a normal correction after earnings. Hang on.
It will be above 190 tomorrow.
"OK, 7 major retailers, (including 1 online only) all dropped over 1% today except Costco, sooo, any opinions singling out Costco are worthless."
$4B is not good enough for some people ..... COSTCO is making money... hello ..... there
"Start from $15 to $16, $1 raise for new hire is nothing, how many new hires Costco has?"
COST has no fear of trade wars................................................its a steal here.
"There is a huge problem w/ Costco these days. As the company explores reaching into the online business, they are having a very difficult time separating their 'ECOM' from their regular (in-store) warehouse business model. Their ECOM is far too slow to ramp-up because mgmt. (who I believe are excellent at what they do) just aren't accepting that Costco cannot have an online business model that follows their existing warehouse business model. There is no way around this, at present, the Amazon business model is the only one there is for online shopping. Costco needs to break from their mentality of selling (online) only those types of products that their members have come to expect in their warehouses. It's just not enough. They are severely lacking 'variety' of choice. Basically, you can find anything you need or want on Amazon but not so w/ Costco. Costco has already invested millions of dollars in ramping-up their ECOM but until they realize that online shopping just cannot be the same experience as their warehouse shopping, until they realize that they need to follow Amazon in order to compete w/ Amazon, mgmt. will remain stagnant w/ lost opportunities, revenues and profits from their ECOM operations."
Look like lot of Stop Loss is kicking in AH. I see no problem with earning. How many business can dream of that revenue number. It's BILLIONS not millions. IMHO
When they rare going to release this month sales number?
bouncing up the 200ma
Love this stock long term!
seems like good numbers to me compared to last year. what am I missing?
Ring that cash register baby
"I remember being young out of high-school working at Costco for a while. being in the management office seeing their total sales for the month and profit written on a whiteboard, and what they had to sell to stay positive.swore they were barley breaking even that month I want to say it was like +100,000 profit for a busy canadian costco"
"Nobody ever goes to Costco anymore, it's too crowded."
EPS beat and revenue miss. Well glass half full is OK. I put some back in here to recoup loss in run up today. Better than top and bottom miss. OK lets get 15.00 a share more now.
"Whether there's something specific causing the retailer's traffic to ""moderate,"" a trend he's been seeing in recent weeks."
Market CRASH in the works......................Happy Santa...........................................
"I think a stock split might be on the horizon, maybe 3 for 1 and of course the special div. maybe $9"
"load up at this low price, the same price a year ago, but with better revenues and more cash."
The Costco spring is wound too tight. Gonna launch well over $315 at some point sooner than later...
Will beat ER and increase guidance.....
god bless this country. thank you oh great master leader wise one trump for crashing the stock market. maga!
what is going on here??? I am toast
https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/briannasacks/more-costco-employees-test-positive-coronavirus
video stores used to charge membership fees until their world turned upside down!1
Analysts say COST is way undervalued .
No good
what time is conference call?
COST = recession proof.................................BUY here........................ its way undervalued !
Wish I had sold all of my Apple and got even more Costco last month. But I can’t complain I got a bunch of Costco averaged in at $317.00. I’m very happy with this quick run. I really didn’t think it would move like this until summer to fall. Maybe it pulls back and tests that low still. But I’m in long now.
This is the best coronavirus stock period.
"EVERYTHING GREEN...well, almost everything!!!!!!!"
Targets increased ..........................
Costco just hit $100 billion market cap!
All these positive post on earnings and its tanking??
"Talked to some friends who got furloughed. They can't even get through the unemployment website because it freezes up. Most have not received their stimulus checks yet, $1200 isn't enough anyway. Companies can get loans all day, but the consumer is broke and can't buy anything. More than 50% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Redfin and Exp Realty laid off 25% of their agents. Mortgage servicers delaying payments per Fed relief mandate will cause defaults to skyrocket, and the housing market to crash. They're painting the tape here, and if you listen to any sane institutional investor, they're not buying this rally because the worst is yet to come. This is true for COST and the market as a whole. Even Powell said the market is crippled, and that we shouldn't open it back up until July! Imagine 3 more months of this lockdown."
Monday morning any good news could rip markets higher.Their senate draft plan willPut markets put into the track?This is like hitting with hammer on good stocks Which are actually doing good in this environmentBuy all stocks and do not scared cats
Slow but steady wins race
"How COST went down over 7 points this morning? I just wonder, so I just pick up some Oct 4, call 280, just for the safe side. All I know that if COST plans to open up store in china two a month. OPP will turn around and upgrade to buy or overweight."
Earnings beat 2.55 vs. 2.44Plus rev. Also beat by 1 Bil.
Wow.. quite an expensive company.. only a single digit growth and trading at around 25 P/E multiple and low dividend payments compared to the price? I read through the earnings. How come COST is so expensive?
COST is going the way of the dodo bird. Young people don't shop there. They are one of the least digitized companies. Shopping in the store and getting in and out of their stores is pain. Their membership renewals are dropping which is the kiss of death.
What's wrong with the sales numbers. The stock should be up not down.
"They missed estimates but had a 7% increase in sales comparable to last year. Not bad, def. buying any did"
345.00-348.00Me buy ....................................................................
YEAH baby....JUST CASHED IN 1/2 FOR $1K PROFIT!!!!!!!!!! Add that to the $950 earlier this week....like I thought....nothing goes up forever. I watched the future VIX (2 months out) rising like crazy at end of the day....predicts bad news coming.
"Costco Wholesale Corporation Reports July Sales ResultsBY GlobeNewswire— 4:15 PM ET 08/05/2020ISSAQUAH, Wash., Aug. 05, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Costco Wholesale Corporation ( COST COSTCO WHOLESALE CORP (COST)339.97 0.18 (0.053%) Bid 340.00 x 10Ask 343.50 x 3Vol 2,900,354AS OF 4:00 PM ET 08/05/20Bullish7.2 Equity Summary Score Provided by StarMine Open 341.86Close 339.97(08/04/20)Market Cap. 150.03BP/E 40.19Day Range [339.97]337.59342.7352-Week Range [339.97]262.71342.73Research Trade ) (“Costco” or the “Company”) today reported net sales of $13.04 billion for the retail month of July, the four weeks ended August 2, 2020, an increase of 14.1 percent from $11.43 billion last year"

The way Costco gets my money this should be priced like Amazon.
seems weird to me that wanted buffet would sell before a $10 dividend....his 800 year old friend is on the board of directors..im sure he told him about it
"Shorted at 284, will cover around 260 before earnings. This pos is over-bloated with a PE of 35. Nothing wrong with the company stock too expensive imo"
This was not the time to hand out raises. Management needs a lobotomy.
"I have been watching COST for almost a year and waiting in line during the pandemic for the local store to open like so many others and this week I finally put some money into Costco stock. A small dividend, a subscription stream of income before subscription became a buzz word on Wall Street and a company that could still grow its market in many countries especially with 1 store in China is why. IMHO. God Bless and stay well."
2.01 vs 1.69 adj basis
Wall street need to reward companies that treat workers well. Same time earn profits higher than 1 year ago. Wall Street need to punish companies that treat workers terrible.Happy employee repeat customers turn loyal.
"has anyone sold their shares? I'm holding mine, I think cost will be just fine"
"Earnings expectations are very very low,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,gonna beat by a HUGE number!jmho"
"if ppl are getting a $10 dividend bonus...why not buy this like crazy?...or will it tank....then ppl buy,?"
Falling knife. 182 is next resistance.

LOAD THE FREAKING BOAT
I wish I bought moreAm waiting for a pullback but it’s just going up the ladder...
"Target $220--sell any strength;;When market down so hard, most stocks will follow suit, esp consumer stocks!"
RSI is way OVERSOLD........................18
Come on Costco...give me 321
"wow,,,thats a big drop from the other day on nothing,, 168.75 from 172, in a day,,"
People will not be eating out at restaurants any longer they will be going to grocery stores and warehouse is to prepare their own food too many risks wake up
There was nothing in this ER that will cause any significant selling in this minimally turbulent time. Weak retail hands will sell but big $$$ will hold and ADD.
Thank you president Trump for protecting this great country Costco loves president Trump
WOW...
"COSTCO is very busy everyday, specially on weekend. I think the sales should be higher because the gas price this quarter is higher last quarter."
"Costco stock ""will"" make $350+ a share, as future monthly and quarterly earnings provide assurance that Costco's future is very strong as has been we'll be going up up just as last yr."
will go up $14 on Monday
"Serious question....when $10 special dividend paid does the stock goes down $10 the next day? As we all know, stocks that pay dividends go down the equivalent of their dividend amount the next day but since this is a special dividend I was wondering if this is the case. Thank you."
"Costco. stagnant and staying that way for a while. I'm out, simply because I'm not complying with forced mask wearing in a store."
finally in the green after buying at 315 in March. it has been painfully frustrating to hold this far. what's the outlook from here on out? thinking it will dip to the 310 range again
"the smart people sold this after the dividend , the longs are getting shafted"
Costco > Dollar Tree... how the @#$& can you even compare the two.
I love this stock!! The earnings report today was amazing!!! I love this stock so much I'm ok being down by thousands of dollars. Wish I bought at $312 instead of $360.
"I'm sticking with Costco. Bought at $80;77/share, have made over 175% so far. This pullback is temporary. With Holiday season approaching, I expect a big bounce-back later this quarter. Costco has been good for me but for day-traders I realize it must be a tough call. Costco keeps adding services (like insurance, car sales, travel programs, etc. Costco has great management, innovative and customer service-oriented. Fairly good quarterly dividends. I'm sticking with it."
More UPGRADES............................buy here while itsCHEAP !
"Costco has risen to too high, too fast.Watch out for a mini crash, down to 220's..."
"dreamers!... this is over rated..over sold..warren buffet saw it, milked this company, got great money from it and left..should followed him"
A reporter asked sleepy Joe what he thinks about H.R.51 today.He answered He likes that model of Chevrolet
up up and away............................. forget other stocks........................just buy on the dips...............................
can't hold a gain...costco used to be up everyday..or at least 3 days a week
"Today, Dec 26, 2019, you can find this message in the Costco offer page ""NEW OFFERS BEGIN 9/4/19"", LOL! good luck for long!"
It’s still crazy to see this in red. Almost all stocks are up. Hopefully we will see a power hour return. Don’t disappoint us. Even Cramer said it’s stupid to sell or short this stock.
I LOVE MY COSTCO SHARES!!!!
"Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) just had their share rating of a ‘”Buy”‘ issued by research analysts at Citigroup, who now has a $190 target price per share on the $64.78 billion market cap company or a 20.95 % upside potential. This key information was disclosed to clients in an analyst note on Friday morning."

going green ???????
I'm not sure why I'm here...WMT is half the price...better movement...why am I stuck in costco?
"It seems to become more and more frequent that every time a company releases good earnings, the share price collapses..."
"I will happily take the $10 special dividend. As a long term holder of COST, the qualified dividend has a 0% tax rate up to I think $77000 in qualified dividends/ capital gains for married couples not in the very high income brackets. COST will recover the $10 reduction in price very quickly IMHO. We will not have to sell stocks with gains and buy them right back to reach that threshold."
As I previously stated here.....$350 is a eye wink away and the negatives are hanging their heads in shame!
"It always drops after earnings then continues its climb. Until it doesnt. The SP divvy dropped it $20. Kinda funny really. We are net $0 from the high of $390ish looking at pre market. Now with earnings front and center and the numbers are clear, one could conclude that the holiday season coupled with a vaccine roll out is going to make this stock see an adrenalin induced rise thru the end of the year. IMO, $425 is on the table by Jan 15 and possibly the end of this year."
Was in Costco Memphis this morning. Worse than Christmas Eve. Obviously not a permanent situation but talk about an unexpected boom in sales. Can't hurt the bottom line.
"I only come to this message board for entertainment as most of the people here have no idea what they are taking about. PS: I love Costco and it’s stock. I am an investor, not a day-trader. Enough said."
Just added. New high in 2 weeks.
Bought another 100 shares. honestly long term you can never lose. The Quarterly didn’t account for this week..
"In January, COST new membership numbers are increased by 800％ in China!This business model works the best now and next 5 years!what a cash cow machinery!"
Costco will report phenomenal numbers after today's market close
North of 300 I would start to accumulate
Got back in @210. Good discount.
This one is going to FLY up today. Hang on tight longs....

Great earnings. Shaking out the robinhood chickens atm and we will climb
I walked into my local Costco over the weekend here in NYC. I couldn't believe the amount of people in the store... It's the reason I bought some stock.
Special dividend drives it up 10%
"Purchased COST about 8 years ago @ 40.00.Got special Div. of 7.00 and 5.00 plus the stock closed @ 188.82 today.My thoughts are that 8 YEARS FROM NOW, this stock could go to 300.00 per share.Am in for another ride up, up, up......GLT all....."
"Costco is a company that can go up againsts Walmart. Cheap deals, everything you need and more. Going to costco personally, I see good things coming long term!"
Why the sell off with such a great report? did I miss a weak forward looking statement or something?
Bought COST while short WMT...
BJ's is not Costco's Costco it's a lot more employees and does a lot more business and is well-known
"Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom reiterated a Buy rating on Costco on Monday, and raised his price target by $30 to $380 ahead of the report. He’s expecting core same-store sales (which excludes swings from gasoline prices and foreign exchange) to be up 13.5% in August, coming out this Wednesday."
$330 today?
Just OWN IT DONT RRADE IT.........................................
Still over $300 a share and still fine by me.

"this is madness! it's just 1 warehouse in china. even if it generates millions per month in sales, it doesn't justify the billions of market capitalization it added today. also, china already has walmart selling in bulk. these valuations are insane."
"Amzn is no longer the lowest price on many items I have bought, lately. Don't be taken by the companies that are downgrading amzn. This is a typical wall st. scam, the opposite of pump and dump: cry and buy. They are pushing it lower so they can buy a good company on the cheap. They know that the amzn threat is overblown we are getting close to 52 week low. They will push it there, then buy and sing costco's praises."
Who is being punished because Costco missed by fractions and why ?
COST can easily recoverin a HURRY..........................................
"Just an observation;COST has again doled out a special dividend. They are growing at an impressive clip and have barely knocked on the door in China let alone the rest of Asia for that matter. Prices aren’t going down people. Your Sun Dried tomatoes are the cheapest price anywhere and they are 50% higher than 5 years ago. Rib Steak is $14/LB. used to be $7 just 5 years ago. Why am I saying this? Inflation. Divvy keeps rising. Stores keep opening at a break neck pace. One of the best run businesses anywhere for a B&M store let alone any store for that matter. One other thing. They are sitting at a 40X valuation. Under normal circumstances, one would run for the hills for a retail store. But COST is not your average retail store now is it? It’s middle income central for the World! It’s not going away. It pays a 2%+ divvy overall. Most sound money out there. CD? T-Bill? Nah, grab COST and take that 2% divvy for life. As long as interest rates are way down here, COST will retain the most reserved investor. $425 by EOY. $475 - 2021 EOY"
Special dividend coming? Its been a while where are the tax windfall utilized?
down at least $5 again for no reason.
"Costco Building going up in busy shopping district in North East Davenport,Iowa"
"FWIW, I just rolled up to the July $267.5 PUTs for $3.00.....8 contracts. Am getting ready to exit the $265's on a drop this afternoon."
nice
Very high or ratio for growth rate imo..
Will load up at $280. Good entry point
"TEN ANALYSTS upped their target price, up to $360-$412, after the report yesterday.Also, COSTCO did beat all estimates noticeably.But shares down strongly on report, even in today's up market - I feel this is wrong; should recover. I bought a week ago three call spreads $300/$360 for Oct; as a result I am a bit down right now.Good Luck!Emanuil"
"Wow i am very surprised that this didn't sky rocket like Nike, walmart, Target, Aapl, Kroger, Carrier, etc.... What a joke."
"I was waiting for Courtney Reagan to talk about $DLTH on CNBC today, but she decided to talk about a small cap called $COST instead. She is very hot, that is appreciated."
well i put in a sell order at 179.75 GL ALL!!!
Im not sure why the employees deserve more pay. They basically fill the shelves with a lift. There is very little customer service needed.
90% of stocks this year have had 20-30 plunge after earnings. Its costco’s and adobe’s turn. Buy puts and make money on the way down. Let the trend be ur friend
CRAMER continues to say BUY ....COST here.
Oppenheimer upgrade and raised price target to $335
"Yes, we git special devedend reel soon! You know me cousen Manuel, he work for Costo in Mexico, He tel me all workers get no more raise caus Conpany will be sending special monnies to shareholders. He say $ per share go to you, but I think that may be in pesos not dollars. But Christmas soon. $ help out! So Felix Navidad to all share holders!"
$Cost treated me well today looking at more gains during tomorrow session. Past 3-4 weeks was time to load up on cheaper shares this is one of the best stocks and companies in the entire market.
"Very bullish, the rumor mill says, a nice uptick in dividends!"
I’m out....waited for a good day to bail. Will wait for another pullback! Tx Costco! I asked cashier what’s going to happen when this turns the other way (hopefully soon!) and all the extra stuff starts coming back? She says they are already setting up for it...like Christmas but way more. GLTA
"Evrytim I go to Costco, it s crowded, waiting for long time to check out;"
Wait for PANIC SELLERS.........................................then do some buying........................
280.00 buying more !
when is the exdidvend date for the special Divdend?
Wait for price to settle a bit before opening position. P/E seems to be on the high side compared to other retailers.
Limit buy order on COST @ $215 per share
"I think everyone has a limited amount of money to invest, and Mr. Buffet is no exception.First, I'm sure, he didn't know about special divident, and secondly, he sees more upside somewhere else."
"Good , now I can get back in"
COST targets increased !!!!great entry here @ 160.00
"I see this as a zoom like earnings play ... Ecommence, (online shopping) has a big role in their upcoming earnings beat... I watched overstock soar from $20-100 over the course of the last 7 months because of their strong Ecommerce sales... Im very bullish on this stock I see 355 before market close on Thursday."
"China and even India are emerging markets. If I was the CEO of Costco, I’d be doing everything I could do establish a name there."
This is looking more and more undervalued every time I look at this.. it hasn’t hit my average price but I’m looking to add as I really like how they’re progressing towards e-commerce as well as dominating brick and motor
COST. Y’all can pound sand. And your face Burka Stazi at the doors? Or getting yelled at for sitting on a $3200 patio set. I told the specimen yelling at me that you want me to buy this without sitting on it first? It looked at me like I was speaking Esperanto. WA based company? I expected nothing less than hysterics.
Inverted head and shoulders...............better cover soon shorties.
Sep sales numbers today ?
when do they report ? is it after the bell ?
"Hey yall hope u guys/gals r doing alright... watching the kids tonight as wife is working overnight shift at the hospital so I'm stuck at home... I'm 49 but have a lot of millineals friends (Drs, RNs, respiratory therapists for example) that invest in Costco and shop in Costco... I know we make fun of the millineals sometimes (but I do it in front of their face as I'm friends with ten) but they really r into savings and investments... we make fun of their lack of knowledge but how much knowledge about trading/investing did we have at that age? Like I said I'm 48..."
Long term I'm very bullish on Costco. Just bought a Jan 2022 $400 Call option. Should be an easy double within a few months.
"I used to have cost a few years ago...it was $160's..sold it because it kept going backwards, and I invested elsewhere...came back to costco at $300...its going backwards again..is it me?"
139 000 members the first day in China thats amazing 300 here we come
"ok, I'm a new card carrying Costco member as of TODAY. I could not believe ALL the people in the store and how FULL their baskets were... Wow.... I think we have a good/safe investment with this company... I personally didn't buy very much but did ""browse"" quite a bit and did use the scanner on my phone to comparison shop and Costco was cheaper on the two items I compared against online using ""compare with google"" feature!FYI, I was in the Dallas area at the store in Plano on the tollroad... Go CostCo...They are currently building a new one in McKinney, TX that will be open in about 60 - 90 days!"

Anyone got the link to earning report for costco ?
Sonic electric toothbrush @ Costco $99.00. Amazon $169.00. Membership paid in full with 1 item. Costco rocks!
268.00 today !
"fortunate to have 1000 shares, wish I had more"
Averaging up and scooping up more shares today. Costco is an incredible company. Doing the right thing by taking care of their employees on the front line during this CV-19 environment. Customers are extremely loyal to their brand. $400+ by year end even with a market correction.
"The market makers on COST love to shake out weak hands, this is not a stock to day trade. Buy it, hold it and you'll be rewarded in the long run.."
Lets go Costco
"feel great being in Costco and not worried about tarriffs. we have nothing to do with trade wars if they come about. so glad I am back in Costco again, stress now is gone. see nothing but positive upward climb. my post retirement is secure..WHEW!!"
Any word on $10 special dividend.
"hoping this stock will take off..rough market but this is a solid stock, just worry ppl will sell because the stock is high"
"not good, at these prices and PE you have to show more, stock will tank tomorrow to the 160s for sure,"
"Costco should announce stock split this time after 20 years since the last 2:1 stock split in January, 2000. With this price, I don't think individual investors like us, who don't have much capital to buy and hold long term when buying at this price. They may buy and sell for short period instead of long. With the split announcement, I think it will hold investors who want to sell, hold back instead and attract new buyers invest into it. Otherwise, institution investors can afford for this price."
It’s official I love costco. I don’t own the stock yet but just got a membership so I’m officially a member
"Wouldn't be ""shocked"" if WAL-MART goes down 15% and Costco gain 15% from current prices."
CramerBUUUUUUUYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY the dips
ACTUAL CONVERSATION LAST VISIT: me to register person: I wasn't able to find [I named a particular high end food product] today but my friend said he just purchased it here recently. him: oh not sure I guess we don't have it then you could go stand in line at a desk over there then ask them I guess. me: uh forget it then. him: OKdo people think this is good or bad for the way Costco runs? lolz
"No one should support BLM, they are domestic terrorist."
Wait for 350's before buying more.....................
Somebody leaked this earnings info. All the big players knew in advance. I want an investigation!
why would you sell now? tax reform passed senate and earnings is in couple of weeks.
Bought more yesterday.
"I do not have a crystal ball and definitely not qualified to give any financial advice. Below what I observed and what could happen based on past numbers.On first day trading in 2021, Costco closed at $380.15. Since Costco advanced about 30% annually last year and last five years (including dividends), can we expect Costco to return the same amount this year? The combined Analyst Target in one year is $400.37. However, if we use $380.15 as the starting point, 30% advance would be $494.00+. $494.00 is a very high number. If we could advance half of that, it would still be $437.00. If I were looking for a buying point, I would go in about 10% below $380.15. That would be about $342.00. A 5% dip would be $361.00. Since my numbers are based on the first trading and the last trading days of the years, I am using $380.15 as a reference. I am long on this stock and yes, I would like to see this stock advance. However, I am not bumping this stock for a quick gain. I am just sharing some of my views."
When is the ex-Dividend date for $10 dividend?
"Millennials were never the majority of shoppers at CostCo, it's been mainly families that need to buy in bulk to feed and cloth their kids. Go look at the lines at a local CostCo and you'll understand what I'm talking about. I see many new immigrant parents with families consisting of 3-5 children, sometimes they're shopping with the grandparents also. Anyone who thinks they're relying on millennials is way off base on this companies strategy going forward, enough said.. do your own dd.. ;)"
crooks pump-price up-crooks short-price down-crooks buy back
Sold my MRNA stocks and bought COST on todays DIP. Now have 8500 shares.
doesn’t make sense for the drop. their stores have major lines are also ways packed...
"Costco rocks, both short and long term!"
As the tech stocks pop probably money would be pouring into time tested stocks like costco. Glta
Costco increased revenue and earnings year over year. They did this while supply chains are disrupted. They did this while paying employees a pandemic bonus. The stock price held up last year while other companies tanked.
WMT P/E is 20.x and COST is 40.xHow is the current price justified :)
"Tesla is worth 4 costcos. Both have parking lots full of cars, but that only benefits one of them."
"Closing at the high of the day, I’m thinking another 1-2% gap up tomorrow. Great way to end the week and begin this weekend"
"Amazon vs. CostcoRecently a study from BMO Capital Markets tried to get to the heart of another shopper debate: Is Amazon or Costco a cheaper place to shop? The results were fairly surprising: After comparing prices for 54 common items at Amazon, Costco, and Costco.com, researchers found that physical Costco stores generally had the lowest prices, followed by the retailer's own website and then Amazon. Overall, prices were 17% cheaper at Costco.com than they were at Amazon, and prices for national brand items were 19% cheaper at Costco.com compared to Amazon."
"should settle around 173-174 today and within weeks back up to 180s. those who cannot afford the fee increase should not go to cost in the first place. it is not a place for cheap products. it is a place for great products at a reasonable price. it is not easy to find great products at reasonable price anymore. that is why cost continues to have a strong niche, something even amzn cannot take away. people enjoy driving somewhere to get something. other times, they can online shop"
Great quarter! Biggest problem was Thanksgiving was a week later this year.
Increase the dividend!
quite possibly the best company on the planet..but the worst stock on the pkanet
"Who is the lucky ones who bought COST at 192s. COST deserves to be 230 again, it will."
Just bought some more - wish me luck.
a lot of games get played with costco stock...just watch on earnings day...just like the Aug. sales report..record sales..record everything...but the stock tanks...same will happen on earningss
wow!
Why such a drop today?
Thoughts and prayers to the shorts.
triple bottom
"If you at first don't succeed, try, try again. ."
$400 getting closer!!
Selling overdone....
Costco raises minimum wage to $15. What's the impact of that on profits and for share holders?
The only people making money on this stock are the overpaid employees
COST is up 4.92% to 294.97
No wonder why Costco sent out the apology letter to all shareholders for lower guidance last week.
A visit to a Costco store tells me all I need to know.
COST foot traffic is now the HIGHEST EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!look for more positive news coming.
Costco will close green tomorrow. Bet on it.
Don't Worry About Costco's Earnings Miss
"If you buy the stock BEFORE the ex-dividend date, you are entitled to the dividend. If you buy ON or AFTER the ex-dividend date, then the seller of the stock to you would receive the dividend. The seller of the stock to you on or after the ex-div. date obviously won't be in possession of the stock when the payout is made so ""possession"" isn't necessary. Ex-dividend means without dividend, so the ex-dividend date is the date without getting the declared dividend if you were to buy the stock. Remember, to get the lower tax rate for qualified dividends you have to hold the stock for about 6 months prior to the ex-div. date, otherwise it receives ordinary income tax rates. This is a type of penalty to those who buy the stock just to get a dividend. If you are in a low tax bracket or buying inside of an IRA then the tax treatment won't matter to you."
Love the sale prices here.....................
All in
COST is benefiting the biggest from surging China market! COST will be surging back from here!
More people will go to Costco this weekend for emergency supplies.
Costco makes it's money on memberships so Amazon won't be able to compete on price. Costco will prevail if price wars start.
Oh no. Membership fee will go up two rotisserie chickens 
COST is way ahead of the Virus game !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!great for investors !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! buying here on any silly weakness.
It will deep RED tomorrow. Look for support around 205-210
Costco is a gem it will thrive whether or not we have a pandemic
Well who ever has been pulling it down hopefully got the heck out all the way with that EOD 1/4 mil. share dump.Good riddins!
Looks like Yahoo! censors everyone who posts notes here. Sad.
$300 coming soon....starts today
You better cover shorty. This will see $270 before it ever sees $220.
"It will very interesting tomorrow, and after ER$400"
up $.60 one day...down $6.00 the next..up $.75...down $7..never gunna see $400
What do they expect? Great sales report.
How can they think that COST is in for more profit taking after the recent down trend... who are these crazies!? how could profit takers not be out of this stock already after that the best price added since is 150$... current value of 10.7 % on a short term basis but we should have lost a bunch of profit takers already... it made a long opportunity at value i doubt people are selling below 180 with any volume...
"with premarket rising, cost being down the last few days..maybe we are due for a break out...^$20?"
its sad to see this stock just crumbling before our eyes...once one of the best stocks anyone could own.
trade deal is imminent ....so cost in china will be a big hit
@Cost any special dividend for COST in 2020 ?
"with the earnings costco just turned..any other company..walmart,target,amazon..any major company. the stock would be flying by $20"
Once investors figure out that tweets and brexit dont affect this very strong economy we are going to see a nice run. The affects of Trumps tax cuts will manifest all next year. Its not once and done as the authors would have you believe. Also this recovery staryed in 2016 on election day. Not 09 under Obama. That was a very very weak climb on crutches and terrible policy. The economy is STRONG.
"Getting better! Might be expecting great earnings on the 27thJefferies Adjusts Price Target on Costco Wholesale to $445 From $410, Maintains Buy Rating"
How did they miss so big on 1Q earnings? I am a newer holder (again) on this stock. I feel it is worth $500. but...we'll see. What else is new with Costco?
Who’s actually thinking this will go up tommorrow.... no chance...

"Anna. 352 is a great entry point! China growth alone makes it a dirt cheap investment, they love hot dogs and pizza!"
Wish I had more funds I would buy again! Tom give me some money lol

All these big money ding dongs are pulling money out of the markets to put into fake coinage. That's our future fake coinage... SAD!
Dec. Earnings blow out. This weekend my Costco was packed. Wait for some one to leave for a parking spot. Shoppers with full carts.

Wait for pullback......................
"Higher high and higher lows for the graph, it looks like bottom has settled in for Costco, Waiting for May 28, 2020."
grabbed more 500 cost share ..my average price for all my cost share is 286....
"I've said this before, I'll say it again..this stock is a $295-305 stock..that's it...it spikes to $310... and then drops"
Associated Press is citing it as a eps miss on an adjusted basis. $1.61 adj eps vs $1.62 expectations and a slight beat on revenues! LOL dammm who to believe!
"Seriously Costco!!!! Look at HD, Lows, TGT, o well except WMT. Fix it up management!!!!"
I have a crazy feeling they will beat estimates and guidance...
earnings call..usually never good because wall st. expects impossibly things from Costco
Surprise dividend is in the works !
This stock does best when no one is talking about it.
Tomorrow 300 plus again.
Great value! Bought more today. Costco is a beast and always will be.
"sold $10 loss for all of my shares, can't wait the price to be improved..."
you can't buy gas at amazon and eat food court pizza and u can't get organic bananas at amazon or fresh baked pies and cakes. Even if you could who would want to??
If the special div. is not announced traders might sell.
Could soon be on BREAKOUT ???????
"buy, easy money"
Breakout soon ?????
COST and AAPL are considered cheap at this present level. Buffet says buy and hold.
Started my position with Costco today. Plan to buy more if it continues to dip
Foot traffic continues to rise...............................E commerce above expectations !
Riley... What r u talking about?... $183 per share.. The price goes up... And what's up with the gas price and trade war?
We are talking Costco here folks. Costco. Let that sink in.
Sams club closing stores Costco is going to boom!
"Most who post here have no clue as to what they are saying about the special dividend, I recommend selling your shares in Costco and go down to your local credit union open a savings account(rate = .0001%) and select your free toaster on the way out. Just unbelievable.!"
One of the worst ER’s I have ever seen/heard. This might hit low $200’s with the market correction in place. Bail now bag holders
Oppenheimer just raised to $355
safe to buy up to 260
It’s Oversold here...........
Costco will be a $300B+ company some day. The China growth alone will fuel this company for years.

"Does anyone know the reason for the late opening time? The warehouses in my area close at 8:30 PM which is great, but they open at 11AM. It seems odd that they continue to give up all potential sales in the early morning."
I have been Costco member for 15 years and recently also took Sam's Club membership. I am seeing some of the prices way cheaper than Costco's. Sometimes I feel Costco may be more of a hype as I myself never looked anywhere else and blindly went with what they sell at their stores. Time to switch and cut the cord!
Headed to under 100$
Fresh new highs...................better cover shorties..............

"**BREAKING NEWS COSTCO MISSED HUGE !PRICED at **32** TIMES EARNINGS Bloodbath for longs in coming days and weeks and institutions sell off !Smartest thing you can do is get out NOW ASAP it is170.79 AH I will reference this post in 30 days to show you how much you lost because you ignored common sense and cold hard facts !Earnings per share came in at $1.17, below the $1.36 expected by Wall Street analysts. Revenue came in at $29.13 billion, below expectations for $29.86 billion.Same-store sales were also a disappointment, rising 3% against expectations for a 3.5% increase. Same-store sales in the U.S. were up 3% during the quarter and were up 8% in Canada during this period, thought other international same-store sales fell 2%."
I sold @ $310..now its moving
"I'm literally in the Costco parking lot and the entire lot is full of cars, everyone sitting in their cars.. It's the calm before the storm. Lol! Idk how this stock hasn't just kaboomed."
I'm in for ER since this was Christmas quarter and very very busy. And also retail looks strong in 2019 and bonus is Target did well. Zacks predicts a nice beat. So yea I think 230.00 After ER.
has anyone else heard a rumor that costco and Amazon will merge?
earnings day is the turning point of three months dropping. need good news today. long
"Thank you Costco board for the dividend increase. I'll be reinvesting it into your great company for at least 12-14 more years and then will be getting them paid out in cash. Have a good evening, longs."
Trough is in.
You would think the dividend raise would also give some raise to the share price.
Aight guys we eating Steak or noddles tonight?
just came from costco in Canada...they only allowed to sell groceries and medicines under new sets of lockdown due to covid spread...same for walmart...
"I love Costco so much. Every time I go in it seems to be busier and busier, no sign of stopping. It's practically shoulder to shoulder when I go in even after waiting in a long line outside! Their prices are unbeatable and quality of product and services offered are excellent. I bought 10 shares yesterday and I can't wait to see where this business goes in 2-5 more years."

TRUMP is the main cause of market volatility and meltdown.

green tommorrow
near term correction imminent.. will hit $285

Costco upgrades
Earnings coming up early March. Stock will climb towards somewhere in the ballpark of $400 before earnings. Do your own research and you decide if you're going to keep it or sell before earnings.
I would have to say COST earnings is gonna shoot up because of how crazy China is. It's like black Friday busy everyday there. Buying calls at open tomorrow.
cost COULD EASILY GO OVER500.00 SAYS ANALYST !
"On the Personal level, I shop locally at COSTCO, once a moon year I shop at Amazon. The Amazon product I bought last year was a solar light, that stopped working in two weeks. Retuning cost was more expansive so I just stopped buy at Amazon. Costco is always for me."
There will no longer be a special dividend. Increases to the quarterly dividend is a likely probability.
What time do they announce their ER today ?
Selloff accelerating. What is the bad news in the CC? Unable to listen to it live
Cost and Blue Apron best plays in this environment really like APRN at 130 million market cap
Cramer says It’s BUY the NEWS.............
OWN ITdont trade it !
Who doesn’t have a Costco card? This is a gift at this price
we need a $10 break out day.
"The Wells Fargo upgrade ""Analyst Edward Kelly raised his rating on Costco (COST) to Overweight from Equal Weight and his price target to $370 from $340"". So since COST price is only $330 it should reach to $370."
woow er 1.90 more than 19 cents
"Well Grimmikins, you certainly don't disappoint when it comes to displaying your idiocy on this board.I just loved your most recent posts where you say ""Shop Rite is taking Costco's business away"".Tell me, my little sailor-suited sissy, how many Shop Rite stores are there in Canada, Australia, Mexico, Europe, Taiwan, Japan and the UK?You're not content being a ridiculous little man, but feel the need to prove it almost every day.You're doing a great job, Grimbelina."
"Great company but underwhelming stock. Now $315 after-hours, ouch."
I believe in Costco and their business model. I too shop there quite frequently especially. I admit I got roped in by the special dividend. Lesson learned. it was a painful 3 days but I'm in for the long haul. Good luck to all.
Going GREEN......................................buyers are coming !
Analysts taking about COST as real cheap here...................................400 +++++++
Big Boys ...buying .................................we go higher..............................
300 - 305 Support
BIG BUY........
what is it with cost? up one day....down the next..well never get to $300 at this point
Thumbs up for over 310 after earnings. Thumbs down for under 300 after earnings. Let the voting begin!
If you’re ever worried about your Costco stock visit a Costco.
ON SEPT 24TH EARNING DATE COSTCO WILL MORE THAN LIKELY ANNOUNCE SPECIAL DIVIDEND TO SHAREHOLDERS.
"Costco for the last 2 weeks has been selling out of toilet paper and water. The stores door counts for every morning, exceeds normal Black Friday door counts. Sales are tremendously higher. Expect Q2 to hit way beyond expectation. As a vendor inside Costco, I can confirm this happening all over the country from my fellow vendors. We text each other daily with pictures of the insane lines to just get in to Costco."
"If there is any stock in this market that will absolutely nuke next quarters earnings, it will be Costco. 100% convinced."
"Best stock in retail, Costco has over 100 million members and their every email marketing with super offers is amazing. No extra cost to advertise no spilling unbelievable business model, continues sales growth of 6-7% a month is never heard of.VERY BEST STOCK TO BUY AND HOLD"
SBUX or COST long term?
I just let a costco out and it plugged up the toilet
"Great news in the monthly sales figures! to the moon alice, to the moon... GLTA"
Earnings will surprise people. This stock will trade around $405 by EOY
GOT TO LOVE IT!!!Costco Wholesale(COST) is already planning to open a second store in Shanghai and is hoping to start construction as soon as possible
"Could have waited for $280 but very happy I bought some extra trading shares @ $295 last week.Holiday earnings were good, Earnings on Thurs. will be great and next quarter will be fantastic due to these extra sales occurring. Couldn't feel safer owning a bunch of Cost shares.!"
this stock ready to explode up
I LOVE my Costco stock!!
Such an easy buy...it will be green today. Bravo for a company that spends money worrying about their employees. They beat and now their ecommerce platform is more popular. Win- Win!
New 52 week high. Will COST close above it?
https://t.me/HAVNLife
Friday is generally sell costco day..should stay red all day dow $15 at times
"YESSSS!! For all concerned the special dividend has past.Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) is going to offer a special dividend in the near future, say analysts from Stifel and JPMorgan.""We think Costco remains a best-in-class retailer that should continue to lever solid comp growth,"" wrote Stifel analysts led by Mark Astrachan. ""We also believe it is probable the company declares a special dividend in the next one- to-two quarters.""Stifel rates Costco shares buy with a price target of $261.""Stepping back, Costco continues to take outsized share versus peers and most retailers and is a core long-term holding,"" wrote JPMorgan analysts. ""Moreover, we continue to believe a special dividend is coming ($18.5 per share in total cash on hand)."""
Costco Wholesale reached an all time high at 369.64
Break 320.
SO YOU OPTIMISTS...YOU'RE OK WITH THE CURRENT PRICE ? 320...310... 300 fine ? how about 285... tell me when to stop. Mgt is doing a fabulous job ?
"Loving this rally, but don’t think it can be sustained much longer"
"While I can see that Costco is really popular for stocking up on items, I wonder if this is really something that can set it apart from other stocks in the months ahead? So now I have extra toilet paper, water, wipes. And whether people are forced to stay out of public areas or not, you just have extra products that you're not going to have to buy later."
Earning surprise.
Shorts don't scare me.
"Been loving Costco for 30+ years.Nothing changes here, move on."
Stores are full. August sales should be above expectations
Thanks for my BUY order @ 303.00 today.
"The $10 thing is ridiculers. The stock price is down 10 point, I lost lots of money, and yet I have to pay tax for that $10 dividend!"
"NO ONE has said that a special dividend - if there is one - will be $18.50 per share! That is the cash on hand. A special would be some fraction of that. The stock price will be reduced on the open by the amount of the payout. For taxable accounts, it means more taxes for you."
"COST is Investors' Business Daily's ""Stock of the Day,"" saying that China is a ""massive opportunity"" for years to come. Thta's not news, but it's nice to see it recognized by IBD."

Why did Costco stop selling Kirkland Scotch Whisky?
buying more
"289 tomorrow, get ready to jump in"
as much as I hate saying this..I think this stock has reached its limit..it might go up a few dollars..but the days of this just randomly jumping $8-10 is over
All I'm saying is if you got a profit take it now or at least sell half your position. The way the market is now if this CFO says the least thing negative regarding FY guidance or challenging environment she'll drop just as quickly as she rose. Just my bit of advice fwiw! Every time I don't lock in a profit I get killed.
rememberCOST always BOUNCES BACK !
Time to make some easy money.
78 % of Americans have a Costco card. This stock is a buy
as a new share holder.........the $10 div was a special one time deal is that correct?? got .....$2000 is that correct ........... its a one time deal?????????
What a blood-bath but COST hung in there today compared to many. Was expecting much worse.
COST almost always goes down after earnings.
"Woo Hoo!! New all time high set at $331.15.busting ceiling of $330, up up from here, $400 this yr. easily."
COST should have a higher PE than AMZN.
why so much shorting?
P/E of 36 should be 20. COST will go back to support level at $180.00https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/COST?p=COST
Ahhh... there is nothing like a 'triple bottom' to fatten my wallet(s)!!
"In order to get the $10/share dividend u have to be an owner of the stock today!!! Stock gonna pop back up, mms trying to get cheap shares rn"
When numbers hit this will pop! People get a j to fundamentals and not worrying about amazon effect. Costco is here to stay and dividend is safe
ARE YOU READY FOR THIS KIDDIES ???? COSTCO MISSED EARNINGS 2.14 EXPECTING 2.46 GUESS WHAT THE DIFFERENCE LAY ??? HUH ? HUH ? HUH ? IN THE SALARY COVID OF THE $16 FOR EMPLOYEES. WOULD HAVE EASILY COVERED THE EXPECTING EARNINGS. FOR YOU HOPEFUL GENIUSES THIS REALLY HURT THE STOCK. THANK MANAGEMENT FOR THAT STROKE OF IDIOCY!!!!! STOCK IS NOW 314 AND SINKING. THEY BEAT REVENUES BUT NOT EARNINGS WHICH IS CRUCIAL !!! HIGHER EXPENSES WILL DO IT. THANK MANAGMENT FOR THAT !!!!
"the dow is up big, but the market is Red....I think hedge funds are draining everything because of the short squeezes at gme and amc"
Did you ever hear about (http://Pick-stocks.com)? They just covered COST this AM
J P MORGAN upgrade with a buy target 201
I love shopping here. I think it is a great place to put your money. But my advice is that when you go in their stores have a list and a budget.
Costco Will Be a Winner as the Economy Reopenshttps://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/21/costco-will-be-a-winner-as-the-economy-reopens.aspx
"I hope Costco delivers strong earnings that blows up wall street's estimates and announce 4-1 stock splits. Today market sold off heavily and Amazon dropped more than 100 points before it recovers some lost, and lost ~70 points, Costco went down more than a buck then recovered and jumped more than 3 points that signals strong buying and short covering before Wednesday. I think Costco will test or break new high this week"
"Hairbag: I'm informed that in the last few weeks retail day traders are shorting as well as going long - playing both ends of the trade, causing a lot of this volatility. The price movements have not much to do with the actual value of Costco but more to do with a quick in-and-out. It will be settling down eventually so be patient and hang in there....hurry up and wait! Lol!"
Who was the clown who said Cost traffic would be down in Q4 due to weather?
If enough people sell it will drive the cost down like any other stock. Many will get their reward and sell. That would take a lot of selling to drive it down $10 per share though. Then it might even go up.
why costco selling off after great sales and targets boost over 400. was 366 at high today.
"Costco is doing great, but I would like to know how we are all going to eat samples with our masks on. That one is a stumper for me."
"count on Costco crushing it's sales #s, and then taking a $5-$7 hit for it. Standard operating procedure."
"This is a brick and mortar store. (Being realistic very small e commerce side. They have uner 1000 stores, but let's say they added 200 more and got to 1000. At this valuation each store is worth 100 Million. Just a bit steep. Lot's of revenue, but very thing margins which makes them more susceptible to small changes in demand, or tariffs."
Costco is on fire. 200 when Nov. sales are posted.
BUY theDIPS............................................
Cramer says COST is a BUY .200+++++

Going below 300 today.
cost's PE is too high. It should be a $100 stock.
"Sellers might come, RSI Divergence"
Targets are well over400.00
Would love to buy more under 350. Doesn’t look like it’s going to break support
"Forgot to mention. In Europe anyway, there has been a consistent push by value conscious buyers to find out who the underlying manufacturers are of white labelled goods are at a fraction of the cost at eg ALDI, Lidl, Costco etc. People are finding out eg Costco batteries are Duracell etc etc etc."
I believe it will be with CEO Craig Jelnick not Jim
"Costco revenues are declining due to a slower world economy. If your up in profits, sell your shares, the hedge funds and institutions will drive the share price of Costco well below $200, probably will find support around $155. Remember, we are in a bear market, which is expected to last a few years. So, I would advise you not to listen to the pumpers or dreamers on this message board. Don't try to be a hero and say, I will not sell. You will have many sleepless nights watching Costco share price drift lower and lower.Do the right thing."
"Waiting for the big special dividend and a stock split, then the stock goes through the roof"
Dividend is coming!
300.49 and climbing !
Is the drop in after-hours because of the Fed rate cut?
this stock has done nothing for 3 months

Save some cash to do some BUYING ...................................................
LMAO we are approaching under $300 rapidly what a stock to own
My local Silicon Valley Costco had shelves half full - with nothing stacked above. I've never seen it look that way. Chinese shoppers wearing masks and loaded up with water as if their tap water must be tainted. I have to give credit to the guys loading the shelves - but will they run out? It's so hyper competitive here - even shopping gets that way.
Let’s see if it closes green today.
Upgraded today by Opp. with an increased price target of 185.
"Great sales number just came out, no reason for a sell-off that is happening today."
"As usual, COST will do a deep dive on earnings. Expectations always exceed performance. They talk about increased costs, etc. It will drop to $330 then recover over the few weeks."
Why would people sell today and miss the 7 buck special ? The stock for the special goes ex div on the 8th of MAy and the regular div goes ex on the 1o th of may.
"Load up on any SILLY DIPS.....................the Virus spike is only a bump up at areas that are still in stage 1, they have never reached peak."
lost all of last weeks gains already
Going up big
Profit will jump high in March
Stop loss triggered. Sold em all.
Costco cashiers are the best! They keep the long lines moving fast and are very friendly and happy.
"Net sales for the first quarter increased 16.9 percent, to $42.35 billion from $36.24 billion last year.amazing"
Looks like Big Boys almost done loading @ bargain prices.
Very simple folks.... Costco was shown on the evening National news with 174 employees testing positive in Yakima WA. The teaser at the beginning included Target but not mentioned during the story. The news controls every part of the stock market.
not surprised to see $1000 very soon on upgrades.
why can't costo have them $100 days like Amazon. and tesla?
There are 300 million people in the USA and Costco at 280. There are 1.3 billion people in China. Common sense this stock is going north of 500
Finally Costco is getting the attention it deserves. The first time it touched 300 was around end of August.
"planning g to sell all of my costco shares. and buy back the special dividend is a joke, and a wash..why pay you $10.... then drop the share price? makes no sense whats so special about that?"
COST = way UNDERVALUED !!!!!its a BBBUUUUUYYYYYYY
I bought a modest 50 shares for 339 today because I liked what the CEO had to say about how Costco treats its workers in front of the Senate Finance Committee.
Wow this stock went back to July levels
"this stock is consistently up then down, would make a good day trader stock, or every 2-3 days"
Good earnings won’t save this company But a website that works would it’s 2021 and it’s still imposable to renew your ownership on line with a help message that tells you to go to the store.
It looks like bouncing on the bottom.
Doesn’t make sense. Others in same sector green everyday like Walmart.
Took wife to Costco $700 poorer and no TV.
"Spending lots of money to have an employee fill my soft drink cup or grind coffee. And, giving those extra employees a $2/hr pay increase."
Costco clears $4 billion in earnings for first time amid record growth
"My final message on special dividend directly from Fidelity Inv; Thank you for your email. If you hold the stock on November 30th, 2020 then you will secure the special dividend which I see will be paid on December 11th, 2020. If you purchase that stock on December 1st it will settle after the record date and will not get the dividend. Hope that helps clarify it."
upgraded to 320 .......
"@Candyman This is a post from Stockhouse. I can only reply to it with a big smile. Cheers Debt free GRAPHITE MINEUptick is around the corner buddy, i'm guessing ""NASDAQ""...TBD? plus The house passed Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package, we're waiting on the Senate to finalize the deal. Regardless The democrats are shifthing thier attentions towards EV, and green energy. Gratomic Inc is a safe haven....The biggest piece of information (imo): TORONTO, ON / ACCESSWIRE / October 28, 2020 / Gratomic Inc. (“GRAT” or the “Company”) (TSXV:GRAT) (OTC Pink:CBULF) (FRANKFURT:CB81) (WKN:A143MR) announces that it is in the process of submitting 243 Kg of high purity graphite concentrate obtained from its pilot testing program for characterization for use as anode material in Lithium Ion battery cells. The graphite will initially be put through an Air Classification process in Toronto, Ontario and from there will be sent to Dorfner Anzaplan in Germany to undergo spherical micronization and classification.Key note: Spherical graphite is a crucial ingredient to the efficient operation of lithium ion batteries, its the key component of the anode.....China is among the largest graphite producer in the world, producing around 700,000 metric tons of the metal. what people don't realize is that China uses synthetic graphite for the most. Battery is one of the few applications, where Natural and Synthetic graphite compete with each other. The battery manfucturers are shifting their focus towards natural graphite over synthetic graphite WHY? to bring down the production $cost but more importantly beacuse of environmental issues... Cue in Gratomic Inc, low cost, processed from naturally sourced graphite material, aiming to become a cleaner graphite source.....self explanatoryTo better understand things, here's an article whereby Volkswagen appoints watchdog to ensure ethical battery supply: The German carmaker has entered a “strategic partnership” with RCS Global, an agency that specialises in supply chain analysis. The company calls itself “the proven leader in data-driven responsible sourcing of natural resources” and already has partnerships with companies including Sony and Nokia.The focus of the partnership, according to VW, is on auditing its suppliers “for conformance with human rights, safe working conditions and environmental protection along the supply chain all the way back to the mines.”VW and RCS have identified 134 “sub-suppliers” and 18 mines in the carmaker’s supply chain. The majority of these have reportedly already been audited. The expanded audit operation has also allowed VW to introduce due diligence measures for each type of raw material that VW sources.Serious audit violations will lead to disqualification from VW’s supply chain. This would apply to small-scale mining operations where “child labour cannot be ruled out”, says VW.Cheers,"
"A big thank you to the shorting hedge funds that are taking a huge blood bath.Too bad they didn't think it all out, like the Feds newest sentiment that is killing them.Most us knew someone was messing with this stock and many 100's more.Sorry shorty, don't feel your pain at all."
It just amaze me how stupid people are.Costco had total revenue of $176 Billion last year and Tesla had $25 Billion and Robinhooders think Tesla is better than Costco. They will learn lesson hard.
Amazon is actually helping COST by eliminating some of the grocery stores competition !!!!!!their store sales have already started to reflect this.
"Costco's revenue & margins are consistently solid, membership renewals above 90%; when excluding gasoline & foreign exchange, COST has growth % unheard of for businesses hitting $116B in sales. COST took a hit investing in future growth overseas that will pay off BIG. Their top $300M+ sales warehouses are in Asia, so further expansion makes perfect sense. Buy on the dip. When detailed financials are reported Sept 29th, Wall Street will appreciate the metrics. Target price $195."
cost will rise ...bcoz since previous earning it is below its highest ......and analyst r bullish about cost ......335 is target price for cost .....e commerce is little negative but better yoy and sales r 6 percent above yoy and on top china usa deal will b done and no tarrif will b applied on 15th dec
Wallstreet is so illegal
This opens green tomorrow and with market up this will go up
If the earnings are not great the management should be fired for raising the wages.
"One of the things I love about COST's financials is that they have zero debt, $13 billion in cash, and $6 billion free cash flow. Lots of cash, generating lots of cash, and zero debt. Margins are razor thin but they are in the grocery business so that's normal. FCF yield is nearly 4 percent...not great but not too shabby either. Overall I think future cash flows for COST will only grow bigger over time...that's why I remain a bull and have a price target of $500 over the next few years."
Costco's Earnings First Read: Staying The Course $COST https://seekingalpha.com/article/4294961
Has anyone have an idea to why this stock is dropping?
just bought costco at 164.70
"FOR ALL YOU PERPETUAL DREAMERS OUT THERE WHO FEEL THE CONTINUED DROP IN COSTCO IS A GREAT THING, MIGHT WE ASK YOU THINK A 4 FOR 1 STOCK SPLIT MIGHT IMPROVE THE STOCK PRICE, HOW ABOUT A RETURN DIVIDEND ? A POSSIBLE BUY BACK OF STOCK ? NO ? YOU THINK CONTINUED RISING OF HOURLY WAGES FOR EMPLOYEES WILL BENEFIT THE STOCK ? HIGHER EXPENSES ? SOUNDS PERFECT. GREAT LOGIC !"
Short squeeze???
Bought this falling knife recently at 330. Will buy more after it reaches the floor. The pandemic bubble that this stock enjoyed this past year is winding down. It was unsustainable. Much more reasonably price priced now.

"Hey Bernie, what happened ￼today too your sub 300 number ￼￼buddy boy?? The world didn’t come to an end and the stock stayed strong.even though the markets as a whole were lousy. You really got to lighten up￼"
What a sell off on a big name like Costco...where is the support? Like I haven’t seen a Green Day in over 2 weeks on this name
New ATH after earnings. Thumbs up if you agree. https://www.google.com/amp/s/news.alphastreet.com/costco-q4-earnings-preview/amp/
Who doesn’t have a Costco card? Exactly
the price will be adjusted $10 plus the regular divided of $.70
"What's possibility of COST raising or even double the Divy, sure would help PPS & build confidence in company. Thoughts?"
COST is ahead of the Virus game !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!read the conference cal.
why is this stock stuck mid 350's? I am sure the financials look awesome. why doesn't it go up?
"BERNSTEIN IS WRONG!Broad, generic comments like membership exhaustion ...is nothing more than one person’s opinion—unfortunately one who buys ink by the barrel. And Amazon’s impact is old news, not new, and we have observed the impact on all retail. If you’ve seen a Costco parking lot in the last 3,6,9,12or 24 months in any neighborhood—you’ve noticed that its always heavily filled with cars, even in stores where they’ve enlarged the parking areas. And if you’ve watched their membership, store sales and e-commerce numbers in the past 3,6,9,12 and 24 months—you’ve noticed that they’re doing a good job in each category. And if you’ve shopped inside a Costco anytime recently or had to return anything for any reason, you’ve seen what a positive experience it has been. Oh, and I should mention that opening stores in mainland China, where value and hands-on experience by customers are integral, should be promising. So, based on all of that, if one wants to argue that it will be slower going in the months and year ahead, it would be appropriate and responsible to provide quality research to support the views. Any wonder why money managers are losing business?"
COST is better than AMZN and should be trading at $1000
"Costco is cheaper than Amazon, but Amazon has the reputation of being cheap. BOYCOTT EVERYTHING AMAZON, THE COUNTRY CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE ALL THE GROCERS, ALL THE RETAILERS GO OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE OF AMAZON."
Imagine if the entire U.S. became a Delivery Oriented Country... we'd have delivery vehicles up and down our local streets constantly 7 days a week... I'd call that annoying.
"With all the angst over the election, I have to say that one encouraging sign for the country was the participation of young people. They got involved in campaigns, worked at the polls and, most importantly, voted. Regardless of how you felt about the outcome, you have to be encouraged by the fact that our young people actually participated and enabled a truly democratic election."
You long should pray hard for COST. Any miss earnings will put COST back to the $180 level. Believe it!
"PE is a little high, but it's not like this has run as far as some plays in this market. If I were long, just flipped from being short, I would not worry. Maybe we don't get a big boost, but management will certainly do something with the windfall this year. Excited for the CC."
Costco Delivers Stunning January Sales Buy here on weakness......................................... we going higher .
https://www.marketwatch.com/story/costco-board-authorizes-4-billion-buyback-plan-hikes-dividend-14-2019-04-26?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo
"13% growth with a 33 PE, any questions?"
I did say it was priced to perfection folks a few hrs back. No way it was going up AH. I'm neutral and a costco member - the stock is a diff animal.
"Look at $CHWY, it started negatively after IPO. Now it is in a coud nine . $STIC. $Bark is selling on $AMZN $COST Costco and all major Pet Stors. i.e Petco. They are going internationally. They use AI to automate its website. Think long term. Think how many pet owners, will buy anything for their dogs. They may go into pet insurance as well. Do not be miopic. Look through binoculars.  Cheers"
I sold my $300 calls today for a $15 per call profit. Then I picked up $315 straddles for about $4 each way. I have a feeling we're either going to go to 300 or 330 after the news today.
Look for Stimulus $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ going intoCOST soon.
Cramer says COST a BBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUYYYYYYYY here.
expecting so much more....what happened
Costco still selling intel computers just shows how behind the times they are!!!
Briben is making China great again!
"6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, a record high as coronavirus takes its toll https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/economy/unemployment-benefits-coronavirus/index.html"
"I bought into this stock and it tanked..thought I would never consider selling it..but am seriously considering it..one of the busiest companies in the world, and the stock drops on a day of record gsins"
"Let it come down before earrings date, then do some buyingjmho"
"What’s new. On Monday, Raymond James analyst Budd Bugatch reiterated an Outperform rating and $260 price target on Costco stock. He argues that while the shares initially traded lower following the earnings report, there was plenty to like in the results, including robust membership results, ongoing strong traffic, and a growing e-commerce business that doesn’t seem to be cannibalizing bricks-and-mortar customer visits."
The China store racked in billions and will be more in the future.
Nice uptrend with good volume .
"I will never invest in Costco until they have clear executable plan for Clean energy and sustainable solutions in their warehouses, etc.Even Walmart, Target and Amazon are doing better. They have invested in new green technologies in their warehouses with PLUG Hydrogen fuel cells, solar energy, etc. Costco looks like an old Oil company in comparison..it is matter of time they will crash with this mindset..."
last green day was in December I think..like Christmas eve.
"I love it, Costco running up again while outpacing the S & P"
Tomorrow sales number should be huge
BIDEN is a CHEERLEADER for CHINA................................if elected say good bye to American jobs !
"I believe the storm is now over and this upcoming week for Cost stock will surge up. Potentially, very high up!"
this manure can never do good at earnings..even when the numbers are good. it still drops...
Looking good!
Missed my chance to load up when I saw it dip to $189. MMs hard to please nowadays. Good luck tomorrow.
I'm ready for the day trading profits to pour into this bull with about 30 minutes to spare until close.
Should have kept the Pimento Cheese. Down $9 after hours. Americans hate virtue signaling.
Will get to 280 in a week but first it must drop
Down yesterday as news that Amazon cutting prices at Whole Foods. Great buying opportunity rebounds today nicely.
Costco Wholesale is up 4.92% to 293.62
There is no reason why this is down today. But the market is kind of flat today. Hopefully it will catch up a bit more later. It doesn’t make any sense to drop yo $338 today.
Material week ness. Will go close to $200
better cover shorties...............................
I can't help to buy more when COST is in deep red.
Sales increased again over 16%400 ++++++++++buy and hold here.
And here comes the downfall
"Maybe the Amazon deal next week. I do business on Amazon, trust me they have a long way to go on this, and they will get stiff competition. Costco is a growth story that will continue. buy on such weakness."
303.00 and moving
new 52wk high ??????????????????????????????????Targets are now over 400+
Target \330.00 +
There is NO WAY Costco is going to declare a Special Dividend of $18.50/shr.!! NO WAY. Analysts were merely stating that the company has (at its disposal) $18.50/shr. in 'cash on hand'. I suspect any Special Dividend this time 'round will be in-line w/ the previous $5 - $7/shr. range.
i feel the ongoing debates are having effect on the stocks in general and on price of Costco. I am afraid the markets would trend down towards Friday.
so much for hitting $300 by the end of the week
gees..really volatile movement today
POSITIVE THINKING: RISE RISE RISE RISE RISE RISE RISE RISE RISE
The move to $400.00 starts Tuesday.
"Market is down, COSTCO IS UP!!!!! That’s gotta tell ya something. I’ve worked for Costco for over 20 years and have seen nothing but growth. This is a great place to park your money "
"BINGO!Analyst Actions: RBC Capital Adjusts Costco Wholesale's Price Target to $439 From $419, Maintains Outperform RatingMT Newswires–8:21 AM"
Buy if you are investor. Two reasons. 1) People get really excited when a new Costco opens near them (compare that to a Walmart) and 2. Happy customers exiting the store with a huge loaded cart and a smile.
Definitely recession proof stock.$COST & $MSFT are both solid companies.IMHO
The COST parking lots are full and the carts are stacked high.
Honestly I’m just upset Costco isn’t going to give out free samples when the stores open back up. That’s the only reason I go.
Thank you! Time to build large
P/e of amazon has always been way higher than Costco’s for 15 years and would have made you rich if you invested early. P/E ratio is not a good indicator - Marc Cuban
"Amazon/ Whole Foods is a bust, Everybody is selling organic and WF is a third more expensive,"
anyone think we will have one of those Tesla earnings where we can go up $59
Most likely up or down no more than 3%.
Huge over reaction by Costco sellers. Huge opportunity for Costco buyers!
"According to current NASDAQ analyst consensus estimates, COST currently trades for a very expensive ......27x.....(19E) of 7.67. Why is this concerning ? Analysts currently have COST growing earnings by only......13%.... from (18) to (19).On the other hand.....ATRS currently trades at just 2.62/sh and has the following analyst consensus estimates on NASDAQ:ATRS 2.62/sh (19) .06. (20) .24 (21) .43COST 208.71. (19) 7.67 (20)8.20 (21)9.01As you can see above, ATRS is a 80%+ grower trading for just ...10x....(20E) and at only...6x...(21E)COST is an excellent company but unfortunately is a bad stock based on current analyst consensus estimates on NASDAQ.Finally, if ATRS just trades for 20x forward estimates, ATRS is a $8-$9/sh dollar stock 2 years out.Good luck to all "
"This is a ""V-shaped recovery"" if I've ever seen one. I had faith. 2nd biggest holding, and I'll continue to add over time and hold regardless of what happens with the price or the markets."
"To all of you who sold yesterday, you have my permission to make a double martini this evening-and then have at least two of those. Yesterday at 280ish was a chance to get back in at some reasonable number. A year ago this in the 230's and even the CornoaVirus, Oil going to hell, China a mess and the DJ falling 8000 points didn't take it down to anything close to those levels. Is 400 out of the question in the next 24 months considering all e growth, store growth, expanding to China etc. etc. etc. Just asking??"
"Cost share price up $4 more bucks pre market to $309.19, we'll see."
They announce this and there is a ten point pop. Tesla joins sP and jumps 50. Hmmm
"Costco Wholesale Q3 EPS $2.05 Beats $1.82 Estimate, Sales $34.74B Beat $34.67B Estimate, Total Comparable Sales Up 5.5% $COSTShould be going up!!"

Costco hot dog at 10am?
Food and gas sales will pickup soon. Get in today. good luck to all
Costco is building up on meat deliverys.Making sure they don't run out in case of a run on meat.
for those who don't think this is a big issue. how many share do you have? its a big paper loss for me today
"Between the Feds. very positive talk today and crude report also today stating of a glut basically has indeed fired a Santa Clause rally.Then to have Costco earnings next month.... this stock is set to go up up up. IMHOAs I'm typing we're up $10 in 2 days, oh yeah, glad I got back in @ $220 and hope to stay the long haul as lots of concerns/fears are lifting for the market, (up 540 points today) and of course Costco."
What's going on No after hour trading???
"Unless Cost splits the stock, I highly doubt it will go below $300. That would have it go more than a 20% down. Can't see that happening. This selling will be done very soon. Like earnings day."
Turned GREEN!
Added on dip today50 units in total now
COST reported great holiday numbers. I reported this early on the board and yahoo removed my post. Why is that?
COST is considered UNDERVALUED at todays prices !!!!Shorts gonna get burned..............................
"Great time to add here , before nextBREAKOUT."
Look for increased Divi soon.
310.00 next res.
Thank you for the dividend!
down .07 in after hours whats going on?
"I was at Costco today. I shop there often. Usually multiple times per week. Today was one of the busiest days I have EVER seen. This includes holidays and event shopping. I’m not sure what was going on but if Costco can have this many people literally packed in their warehouses, there certainly isn’t a need for mail-in ballots (side point). Main point being, things sure are picking up wherever you go. People are tired of being tied down. Pent up demand is starting to show. IMHO Markets are going to pop soon! Hold on tight!!!"
This stock only one worth 100$ max.
hahaha.. shorts loose again
"Virus subsides,Costco reboundsVirus escalates,People don’t dine out or travel,potentially millions of kids home from school. People will eat at home. Costco will rebound."
need some support from fund managers here. decline too long.
"Now I understand...big investors like hedge funds like short term profits and if they don’t get the earnings report to their liking, they sell. If the earnings were as investors wanted, there would be no selling. So after they sell and put their money in other stocks, Costco will go up again and then they want back in. I’m in it for the long so not a bit concerned..great time to buy Costco now."
please let me know what time ER announcement ?
costco has what the consumer needs every day . the consumer is strong and costco will roll to new highs
It's the ghost of Warren Buffet now haunting this stock since he's sold. Downtrend will soon reverse. Bank on it.
$350 by next month
Earnings are going to be great. They also made a ton of sales through e-commerce￼￼.
It’s Monday. 12 pm. At Costco. Been 15 minutes and still no parking.
Costco is too big and great to succumb to amazon. The Loyalty will always prevail. Keep buying more shares you'll keep getting rewarded. I hope the bleeding isnt too bad this upcoming week.
"Blue chip company to keep long term. People like me are just Costco addicts - it's a system that WORKS. Glad I bought it at the dip around $158 - what a bargain! Holding fast for now, may buy more if it dips under $180"
Costco loosening its policy on entry. More ppl allowed in at one time. GOOD.
Crazy market going down for no reason
It's moving with the NASDAQ today. Hopefully it breaks away and moves up.
stock market raging...costco down big again...nearly $40 down since the special dividend debacle..think about it $40...this is a broken stock.
The best stock in this and next year
"Solid stock with premium valuation, is what I can say. The big boys will buy or sell is depend on how bad the economy condition. If it slows down moderately COST will be the winner. I will buy COST around 250-260 which is I think it will be hard unless the market cracks."
Shortie got killed listening to Cramer....LOL
BUY andHold here .
I think there might be a special dividend coming next month

"Now we know that how COST gets memberships. It is very genius marketing idea which I don't expect. SAMCLUB also did it too but I don't expect SAM'S will get memberships like COST, because SAM'S service is suck, and product line on the shelf can not match COST. COST moves merchandise so fast, if it does not move well, they just put them away."
nice bullish uptrend. one of the best stocks to own in coronavirus outbreak
"can someone with true knowledge just explain why the stock price is dropping? huge day yesterday, and its red...is it because it's expensive? The business seems to be there.."
"Doesn't matter at what time I go, I always find the Costco parking lots full. So, I did what any sensible man would do. I purchased some COST shares. Good luck to longs. This should be 400+ by year end."
"Costco has always had a reason for avoiding forward splits but it's one subject they do not enjoy talking about. However, with the price nearing $300/shr. and a recession looming in the near future, they need to be seriously thinking about it. If they did decide to split, I don't think they can afford anything less than a 4-1. And, with their current future outlook, the time is ripe for a forward split. With a 4-1 right now they're still a $70/shr. stock. I can see that doubling to $140/shr. in less than one year. The value that provides to shareholders far exceeds any special dividend they could offer today. If you had 100 shrs. prior to the 4-1, after you would have 400/shrs. at $70/shr. a double in less than a year to $140/shr. would then produce an additional $28,000 value to your position. The strength of a forward split cannot (and should not) be under-estimated. It is an aggressive move and one that Costco is certainly in the right position to substantially increase shareholder's value.However, anything less than a 4-1 would really not be taking full advantage of the current (and future) position of this company. I certainly hope management takes a forward split into serious consideration. At this stage of the game, it's a win/win for all involved.Also, if they opt for a split and not a special dividend, they should at the very least increase their current dividend by a substantial number. For the purpose of this split analysis I have not considered the what this dividend should be."
"The downturn in this stock has been nothing more than year-ending profit-taking after a substantial and very successful year for COST. Traders on the Street (for the most part) are already gone (with bonuses in-hand) for the holidays and will not be back before January 7th. Until then, all conclusions based on trading are simply artificial. This occurs every year during the holidays. The triple-bottom remains in-play."
Special dividend coming soon. You better buy the stock and get in or else you will regret it
TTM sales 178 billion. Market cap 138 billion. PE ratio of ~31. Am I missing something here? I feel the need to load up on calls with this one.
@Stephen Do you have any idea what Costco employees have been thru the last year? Remember Costco?s mission statement TAKE CARE OF OUR EMPLOYEES! Thus REWARD THE SHAREHOLDERS!! The shareholders were rewarded a ten dollar dividend recently and the company is thriving. Sounds to me like you just like to #$%$ probably one of those idiots who complains about long lines in a store you?re invested in.
Guys I just got a hot dog at the local my Local Costco it tasted fantastic but caused a violent reaction in my stomach.Before I could even get home I had a explosion in my car of epic proportion all over the white seats of my tesla

Maybe the whisper number was higher. The stock is overvalued too.

With passage of the tax bill it goes through 200.
the bull market is finished
well those people all going from Costco to rite aid sure has not worked out. rite aid (RAD) just hit a new 5 year low $4.28. so Kenny is long RAD at $8 and short COST at $113. how does he do it?
technical indicators paints a bearish trend.
"A decent report but a pretax charge on Cord-19 was not liked by the Street.Sept 24 (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp ( COST ) reported a 27% jump in quarterly profit on Thursday, boosted by strong demand for foods, electronics and gardening and sporting products during the COVID-19 pandemic.Net income attributable to the company rose to $1.39 billion, or $3.13 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Aug. 30, from nearly $1.10 billion, or $2.47 per share, a year earlier.Total revenue rose to $53.38 billion from about $47.50 billion, exceeding the average expectation of $52.08 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

Take profits now. Remember what Walmart did after earnings. You’ll get it back at a lower price
What are the possible liabilities from their lawsuit?

(COST) said Thursday profit rose in the fiscal second quarter, lifted by rising sales, as the warehouse retail chain saw a boost from consumers stockpiling on items in light of coronavirus fears.Net income rose to $931 million during the quarter ended Feb. 16 from $889 million during the same period last year. On a per-share basis, Costco earned $2.10, compared with $2.01 a year earlier. Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting reported earnings of $2.05 a share."

can someone explain the drop today in COST?
"I don’t know why this is down. I am on vacation in Hawaii. People are doomsday shopping at Costco. So many people, wicked long lines with $1,000 cart full of food and water. It’s insane out here the fear! Panic shopping galore. Next quarter should be amazing"

"We are getting in overpriced overbought territory here, be careful guys"
The market cant make up its mind whether its a virus stock or not.
"Hey everyone,Costco stock was doing so well. Why did it dip so much this past week ?"
Crazy swings
Costco raises their minimum wage for all entry employees to $15 an hr. Two years in a row with a dollar raise for entry level employees.
"The puzzlement expressed on this board about why a drop in Costco's share price occurs when Costco had an extraordinary $1.5 billion sales increase in March tells you one thing, the drop is irrational. When cooler heads return, the share price will rise."
I am in profit on my shares and calls. Should I sell before tomorrow afternoon?
"The stock itself is so boring, but after video clip, it is another bull stock that breaks out the trading range. On Friday it assures that the wild break out is confirmed. The only question is how high can COST go higher. I guess 15-20% from base 280s can be done with a few more clips from China and earnings report."
Crashing hard...this will be under $300 tonight for sure
HUGE beat on the top and bottom WOW
Wed. is the last day to collect the divvy. I expect investors to pile in tomorrow and to catch the wave to $300
Good time to buy!
Costco is the perfect blend of a growth stock & dividend payer! I bought and held 300 at 73.99 in 2012 - it’s my best investment Got in and then out of amazon 189 to 1000I’ve been supremely disappointed in prime for at least two years - shipping is shoddy - mistakes galore - I keep having to email bezos to get any satisfaction - I dumped prime and get better shipping results!Love Costco- :)
"New to this board (I follow MU). Interesting situation with COST. Down a bit now, earnings this week.. Our local store (in N.E.) was a mad house over the weekend. Shelves empty, lines to the back, etc. And yes; we bought extra bread! Buying op nowish or still going lower? Will watch as I don't know this stock."
how could this go.anywhere but down?
hopefully she won't do a Kroger on us!
Don’t worry about this stock. It is a constant climber. Earnings will be good and it will continue its climb.
On the way to330.00 better cover shorties .....................
Costco is undervalued. What Costco should do is put a competing bid in for whole foods. Costco is already number 1 in organic food sales. this would beef up their exposure and crush Amazon now. 18.5 billion is so doable for this company.
"just want to share some info that most of you may not get. first of, i am long term holder since later 90s, started shopping at jeriche LI branch and bought stock then, along with HD and AMZN, all vendors that i used a lot when starting to work. live in muttontown. anyway, to say i appreciate cost is an understatement. since moved to NJ, still shopping at its plainfield branch, love the new building and gas. anyway, cost opened its first ever branch in shanghai china the past weekend. in one week, 110,000 members signed up. the first day the traffic was so intense into the lot, took 3 hours, eventually, has to close early by police because too many people. famous liquor from china Maitai was cheaper than anywhere in china. trade war affecting chinese consumer behavior? frog that!all is well, rock on."
Would appreciate your thoughts on the following... At what multiple does COST deserve to trade at and why? Full disclosure... I don't currently own shares and haven't for a few years now. I sold in the mid-$150's in 2015. Some might say that was early and I wouldn't argue (decision still made sense for me). I will consider buying again if/when it gets closer to a share price I feel is justified. Cheers!
"Wall Street concerned with Costco PE of 27 and says not a word about Amazon with a PE of 270, seems to be a disconnect. Costco is simply a buy and hold, still adding stores and customers."
"Stephen, all points well taken, some of us hold stocks for 10 to 20 years and dollar cost in, If I could tell you how much money I've made on cost since my first purchase in 1995, well you wouldn't believe me. Costco is one of the best run companies out there and i can almost assure you if you bought some today, tomorrow, or next week in 2035 you will be a happy camper"
Would you recommend to buy COST shares for short-term or long-term? I love to shop walmart and want to purchase this stock but I am worrying about that it is possible to be going up more than now in future.
Definitely closing green today. Many upgrades with target boost.
Fund managers have been BUYING .............................................load up on any dip
Nice close above $300.Go Costco!
"How come people investing in stock without knowing basic things such as Dividend, Ex- Dividend day and record day. No wonder these Robinhooders will hit hard."
Any thoughts where it’s going ? Volume low. Keeping constantly under 296
Can someone tell me how you think Costco is overvalued. A lot of people have stated that its overvalued without facts to back it. Anybody?
This would be well over $400 if Costco didn’t boost all the employees pay by $1 an hr.
I thinking it closes green today
I bought a call today did a big mistake seems like
should have bought walmart this stock is maxed out
Panic selling always works forCOST ! been investing for years.................................
Tanked. Showed no strength at all today
Why is COST down? The stores are packed like never before. It just goes to show you the stock market is irrational and is more like a casino than anything else.
"The Mad Money interview tonight was outstanding. If you are a holder, make sure you find a replay. It does not take many minutes."

Not sure why the stock is down.
You people need to do your homework look at the day after earnings last May definitely down not up
I don’t see why people are overreacting we are literally at the same support 338 we bounced off at 10:30am. We are at 338 in AH It can easily go back to the 340-345 levels we been treading all week.

COST is a BBBBBUUUUUYYYYYY here going 238-240.00
market is going to fall hard. so much debt from stock buybacks.
"NOT MY WORDS... THE ANALYSTS ""Costco Wholesale Corp. stock fell in the extended session Thursday after the retailer reported lower-than-expected EPS, saying it had incurred in more costs with wages."" GET IT ? HIGHER EXPENSES. THE INCREASE IN WAGES TO $16 / HOUR. THATS THE REASON WHY THE STOCK IS TANKING"
Just went to Costco for the deals. Oh my lord. Traffic and parking was insane. Saw two people punching each other in the parking lot. So many people. I wound up leaving. Not today.

"I can't thank management enough for instituting the mask policy They are only trying to keep everybody safe and I can't believe some people are whining about the small inconvenience. Are people really that selfish that you don't care about others and want all to be safe. We wear ours when shopping in stores to keep others safe. To the whiners, stop acting like spoiled little children. The world doesn't revolve just around you. We are all in this together and its a small sacrifice to make until this blows over to help keep everybody safe."

"Keep in mind folks, COST is not a day trading stock, it has strong fundamentals, due to recent ex-special div the day trading crowd has lost interest it in.But - it should come back roaring."
We need a stellar report cuz this ain’t cheap with PE of 35.
Costco will beat estimate by HUGE in Q3.
"can you imagine if costco could be bought by anazon?...""if you have amazon prime..free admission to costco""..sales through the roof..costco would be huge!"

I own Berkshire and Costco. I’m glad to be diversified further. I’m long on Berkshire and long on Costco.
cost needs to go thIs week..pretty flat last week
329.00-330.00 adding more
we should touch 300$+ today !
"Waiting for 280""s to add some more."
I think I heard that Jim will do a COST interview today on Mad Money.
"rise, consolidate, rise consolidate... go above $240 real soon. Just my opinion."
if Costco would only get toilet paper back in stock 
Walmart + COSTCO = competition for AMAZON !look out if that happens
"Huge beat and we get sell off. If this was amazon, google they would all be up $10+ in AH. But nope, we get dropped"
"Actual earnings are 2.55 vs expected 2.44 it’s a beat !COVID wages are only temporary.Costco reported earnings per share of $2.14, which included 41 cents in costs incurred from COVID-19 premium wages, the retailer noted. This week, Costco boosted its starting minimum wage by $1 to $16 an hour.E-commerce surged 75.8% during the quarter versus a year ago.Comparable store sales came in at 13% for the quarter, with comp sales in the U.S. growing 11.4%, while Canada and other international grew 13.4% and 21.5%, respectively."
The good news for Costco is $250 is the next support level which means you will not have to worry much.
be ready for under 200 this month
This thing is going long...without a doubt!
"Check out the videos of today’s Costco opening in Shanghai! Chaos...five mile traffic jam, schools closed. Only opened 5 hours before security shut the place down due to traffic /safety concerns! Go Coastco"
cosco is making good money.. this is only down cause estimates were wrong.. not cause performance was bad
Will COST issue a special dividend of $9/share like last year?
Even if it did great its still gonna go down
"Know what you own...from the earnings callThere were eight net new openings in Q1, so we're eight year-to-date. In the second half of the fiscal year, but this quarter, in the fourth fiscal quarter, we plan to open 13 more net new units. Five of those will be in the U.S., three will be in Canada, and five will be in overseas."

"I'm officially a Costco shareholder. Should have bought the pullback closer to $300, but got greedy thinking it might dip into the $200's. I love the store experience, products, and value it offers. There is no store better. This will be a long term hold."
"I bet that you'd ""love that drop"" even more Grimmikins, if it dropped another $30/share.That way you could cover your imaginary short that you claimed that you made at $113.Gotta keep track of your fibs, Grimmikins."
Costco is the best why cant they take it down more so i can buy some.
Virtually no selling has occurred. Only one million shs traded so far. don't let MM crooks steal your shares. Going back to $245.
As restrictions relax ... COST will soar .................................... to fresh highs.

pre market up over $5...im surprised..with the dividend new I thought it would be a lot higher
"Costco Wholesale Corp. said adjusted comparable net sales for the five weeks that ended Monday climbed almost 17% from the same period a year ago.The company logged $16.84 billion in net sales for the handful of weeks that ended Oct. 5 , it said.Comparable total company sales rose 15.5% for that five-week period, while comparable e-commerce sales rose 90.3%, Costco said. Comparable U.S. sales rose 14.5%, comparable Canada sales increased 17.5% and comparable other international sales increased 18.5%.Costco said comparable sales that don't include the effects of change in gas prices and foreign exchange were up 16.9% for the whole company and up 90.1% for e-commerce. Those sales rose 16.7% for the U.S., 18% for Canada and 17.5% for elsewhere internationally, Costco reported.The company said the shift in the Labor Day holiday in the U.S. and shift in the Moon Festival in Asia both helped results by slightly less than 100 basis points combined."
"Always funny to see COST marching along with a 31 p//e and a growth rate below 7%. Even most technology companies would die to get a PEG north of 2 and COST is at 4.5Even with pricing everything in frozen produce at $10 now and calling everything ""organic"" so they can charge more and have smaller packages, they still have a lousy growth rate.I'm sure all the cheerleaders here will pontificate about future growth and moving into China or India or wherever but is there any clear thinking person that thinks this company is not ridiculously overvalued?Even BJ's has a much higher growth rate and much lower p/e. The only logical reason I can see is that the same sheep you see lining up every Saturday afternoon to but toilet paper, paper towels, food and snacks for more than you can get them virtually anywhere (TGT,WMT, KR, etc.) without paying $60 to get in the door, are the same ones buying up the stock. Emperor's new clothes if I ever saw it. ""What do you want to do today honey?""""We'll I guess we should go spend $250 at COST since we paid $60 upfront and I'd like to somehow get that money back in tiny increments by the time we have to spend another $60 next year."""

could have sold this at the special dividend like most did...and bought back in...thats sad...investors took that special dividend and ran
"COST is overbought and will experience a short-term dip. Hop over to NLST for the weekend. It's about to pop, BIGLY."
"earlier today in pre market, this was over $6..now look at it"
"If Costco decides to issue a special dividend, it would probably come around Christmas time by providing unexpected money to boost holiday spending, or perhaps in Jan. of 2020, so people can plan and delay the need to pay tax on it until Apr. 2021."

"Wholesale delivery, huh? Good move, Costco. Great quarter. Nit's are worried about margins, huh? And competition with Amazon? Oldest trick in the book... don't be fooled. September numbers were off the charts! Nit's should probably worry about Amazon's margins, considering they've never really turned a profit for shareholders. Plenty of growth yet to be had here."
Another down day for the markets.
"Amazon is only good for buying worthless riffraff like USB cables and Cellphone Cases and textbooks that you don't need to see in person before buying. I hate the packaging. Amazon is a huge garbage generator. Costco is lot greener. They even cutup old boxes so people can carry stuff in it. Love Costco. Going there tomorrow early morning before parking lot gets full. Next to Disneyland, Costco my magic kingdom.."
Buy on dips if you're not a day-trader.
"News Fed pausing out next week, look for big bounce."
"Weak hands selling and who would be doing the buying, the same who highlight material weakness in what?"
Keep buying more. Loyalty will always prevail in the end. All I know is whenever I'm at Costco the mass crowds say it all !
"Walmart rises, Costco soars"
"I don't understand the fuss about Costco employees getting a better pay/salary. Costco employees normally buys their own company's stocks via their 401k plan selections so with their higher salary means they will also participate in purchasing their company stocks. Maybe not much to create a huge dent but surely Costco is not going to bankrupt. The end of last year they gave a generous $10 dividend/share. The employees' wage increase should not scare the weak hands to start doing selling-off chaos supporting the short-sellers. Selling your long position shares only means you're taking the realized loss, it is a done deal, damage done. But if we all hold your shares, then it's only a temporary unrealized loss, be patient. Do not sell when the price is too low. Costco stores are always busy, it means their business is doing good. Even during the pandemic lock-down, they are doing just fine. For a long term, this is a solid company to keep in our portfolio. Big institutions also hold COST shares."

probably gunna have a bunch of red days now..just like before when we hit the $365 range
"Undervalued, have you seen the growth?"
Look for the RED light sale !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!as great entry point.
Warren Buffet is buying COSTCO...
"I bought COST today. Whole Foods and COST are completely different companies with very different strategies. If AMZN wanted to become a COST it would have to totally redo and reface the entire brand and stores.... No one is leaving COST to shop at Whole Foods and the earnings today show that only more people are shopping at COST.... long story short, COST isn't going anywhere and they have a niche that maybe only Walmart competes with, buy when others are fearful."
"Berkshire just sold their entire stake of Costco. A whopping 4.3 million shares. Even after this was announced, the price hung relatively tough. Looks like tomorrow the price will spike to $390 & then just may really soar."
"Wall Street analysts questioning Costco for their $2 per hour premium to Costco workers while posting 11% ish sales gains is ALL you need to know about Wall Street and how the US economy works for owners rather than workers. Eff that analyst, I'll shop Costco more BECAUSE they take care of their employees."
Just little patience.
I guess since they increased their dividend they may not have a special dividend this year.
it reached Maximum of 350$ no further increase in the price. selling and taking profits
"$$$$ is coming back to this stock. Do not sell, hang in there. You will be rewarded! Up 3-4% today !!"
Nervous
"Time to buy COST, Oct 04 again. I am quite sure that COST number will beat the estimate, becuase of the Aug sales is so great."
I was just informed that Costco is closed today? I am BEYOND livid! I gave a lot of guests visiting for thanksgiving and I desperately need more wine. What kind is company closes ALL DAY on what would be a huge money maker? I guess I’ll take my money and business SOMEWHERE ELSE!
They report every month basically so not a surprise
"Wells Fargo downgraded this stock and said it was overpriced. Do you believe them? Heck NO! They lied to their customers, so why would you believe anything they say? Buy COST and hold it. You'll be glad you did."
Great opportunity to add here
"Costco Wholesale (COST) will report June same-store sales on Wednesday, although Gordon Haskett calls the stock a Buy today.Analyst Chuck Grom reiterated a Buy rating and $350 price target on Costco stock Monday, while also increasing his estimates for last month: He now expects the company will report core comparable sales up 7%, a 50-basis- point increase from his previous model."
sold at +$1.09 up because that's the best its gunna get.. this is headed down
"So with the Debacle that is the new Credit card ""City"" bank switch over as a Costco member for over 20 years the next quarter numbers will be lower . Costco will loose the charge back and possible customers that are being POd by the treatment of Shity Bank.If you are having the same issues as having direct payments refused by Shity Bank CALL Costco do it a lot and loud ."
keep your shares
Costco is one of the few that are surviving this corona virus outbreak
Went to Costco in Boston Hts Ohio on Saturday and it was a madhouse. I've never seen so many people there.
COST is hugely undervalued:Target $450!
Long costco!
"no Amazon, cost still too high, Amazon earnings growth too strong and make huge money, so Amazon sure be attack cost, cost profit margin too low ,so I think cost can't afford it, so buy cost is very risk."
slowly becoming my worst stock
earnings estimate anyone?
Anyone else notice that their 2020 revenue is higher than Costco’s market cap?
"Costco beat expectations on revenues. They missed expectations on earnings due to unusual increased pandemic costs, but still had better earnings than the year prior. This is a positive earnings report!"
The 7 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks To Buy  For details https://youtu.be/0KMtEGgad14
Costco will smash this earnings report and definitely next earnings. look at the volume in Costco stores now everyone is scared of this corona virus
"Here it is. COST. LONG. Slow, steady and stable .Own some."
"I for one don't see the connection in terms of Whole Foods and Costco. I have shopped in Whole Foods and its expensive. Is Amazon going to change that? Plus I buy all my paper products, eyeglasses, and other non Food stuff that I wouldn't think Whole Foods would even have..I for one think this is a total overreaction and a good opportunity to pick up some Costco to either add to ones position or start one. IMHO"
Nice move in earnings!
"299.00-301.00BUY , BUY BUY"
SPLIT already
Shop-rite much better store & u don't have to buy 2 dozen of one item.costblo is not worth the price.
"Costco will have blowout earnings and future guidance will be higher cause everyone is cleaning out the stores to prepare for virus, even my costco barely has anythin"
"Still hoping for a special dividend, right now just an increase on a quarterly dividend"
Blowout earnings numbers on Dec 13 send the stock soaring.
You should be careful walking on slippery surface. I believe Costco will trade further south.
"Immediate stock price dip following good quarterly earnings has happened repeatedly, followed by several days of price increases to sound levels for this solid company. This past quarter was glaring—declines in the few days preceding the announcement, big drop in the futures immediately following the announcing, not so big drop by the end of the first trading day, and then rebound to near new highs in the days that followed. WHY ANY SELLOFF FOLLOWING PRETTY CONSISTENT GOOD RESULTS ....the pattern makes for an obvious buying opportunity for a good company!"
its not a complete washout. just wonder why they missed on eps. costs?
"""my"" costco have self check out line now. great if you have few items (and have your own bags or box that you can place on the scale). Not so great (but still appreciated} if your items are rather bulky and you have to lift them somehow to scan. They didn't seem to have extended scanner for large items (like that one large TV - the only item in/on your cart). Still love it!!!"
"Guess this could be indirectly related to trump...he destroys economy, feds need to save it, market goes up"

It's nonsense like this makes me more likely to hold put for a higher high vs. settling. O thought $310-$325 would be great but now I may just let it roll. Amazing numbers regardless of what was expected. Don't expect this dip the last long. It may not even last until tomorrow afternoon. 12% up March YoY while others are closed and/or losing money....hilarious really. Costco Rules

I love my Costco stocks.
"everyone on here is long costso,,,what are you all in at i am long 2000 @ 155."
"sell before warren beomes dem nominee, whole market will tank 25%"
"It's a shame the SEC doesn't protect retail investors like they do hedge funds. As we are seeing today in Costco, funds can control, manipulate and steal shares from the little guy with no consequences. Let the reverse happen, like the GME run, and the SEC is going to make sure heads roll. Sad."
"For those who've been looking for the special dividend, looking like wish is coming.All in, Wall Street would be wise to look beyond the pandemic pay issue on Costco. Being generous with employee compensation has long been in the Costco DNA as a means to drive strong customer service and prevent workers from leaving for other gigs (which is a cost). Moreover, with strong sales momentum into the holidays and a looming board meeting where Costco could announce new shareholder friendly uses for all its cash — the stock does have positive catalysts on the horizon."
The financials and fundamentals have not changed in most of the companies that have sold off today. As soon as we receive some positive news on the containment of this coronavirus the ALGO's will kick in and these stocks will shoot up and again be on fire. I'll be buying small (10-20) share sizes on all dips for the next few days and if so weeks..
Under $300 for sure today
keep on running
"More companies and school close for next week, people should buy more supplies for next week in this weekend. Buy buy buy!"

"Well Grimmikins, Costco beat earnings, trimmed their credit card costs and is planning on opening another 31 stores.Not bad for a place, that according a certain sailor-suited, Mommy-mooching sissy, is always ""empty"".It's getting harder and harder to cover that ""short"" you were bragging about back at $113, isn't it Grimbelina?How come you won't talk about that? Too embarrassing?L'il French fibber.............."

Most customers were wearing mask anyway. This is just a none issue.
310.00-314.00 today
Holding up very well.
it will rise ..already high is 303 ...it is 20 usd down since september ...eps is good ...very minimal missed revenues ......rest all positive
Increased DIVI.shorts better cover soon.
"COST trying its best not to turn red, when/if it does, buy more, then profit, that easy"
"Who doesn't like a survey of 1 ?my costco was packed saturday, shelves were packed too. Price of eggs dropped, 2 dozen for $3.79, 87 octane was $2.75 but you gotta understand i am in commiefornia so that's cheap here."
My best stock by far. The only good thing about Biden is that COST maybe able to open up more stores in China.
"The so called earnings miss came from paying more to their employees, so what's wrong with that!"
I bought on dec 1st 2020Why I did not received $10.00 dividend
"will benefit from CVID-19 fiasco big time.Not a news I like, but a fact!"
"For those that say COST is an ""expensive"" stock, keep in mind that it trades at a price/sales ratio of .5 and has NO DEBT, in fact it has a net cash position and generates tons of free cash flow. This is why they were able to pay the $7 special dividend this quarter in addition to the regular dividend of $2. They will continue to pay the special dividend every year, and will likely increase the amount giving the stock a dividend yield of 5.5%, which is the highest among retailers."
320.0-324.00 ready for take off............................look for the dips......................................
have faith in $COST.. I have gut feeling it will do wonder as it is still growing..
Lots of bashers in here getting nervous it looks like. All i see is good news and they keep peddling misinformaton.
300 tomorrow
"Down grade, up grade are all BS, particularly to COST. I believe it will suppress COST down to around 290 which it is the resistance."
Blowout earnings Thurs. and special dividend announcement.
dont forget the Kirkland brand is highly regarded. there is a lot of brand loyalty there and so far no other company has been able to match it.
"Finally broke the $200 threshold, can it close over $200?"
hx of cost is drop little after er ...last 2 er drops little but gained nicely up after few days .....
40 to 200 in ten years! And there is a lot more to come. Loop Capital joined ranks today with a new buy and a 224 target. It makes my morning when guys come here and talk about their short position.
why is Costco tanking....
Sales has been increasing month over month. Special dividend paid because they made too much money. So far we are down 20% from the highs. Costco’s are jam packed every time I go there. This has to bounce on Friday...I’m predicting $350 in one week. It tends to move up after ER...slowly but surely. Way oversold...I’m betting my life savings on a rebound here soon.
This is where the hedge funds and institutional investment houses are picking away little by little so it doesn't shoot straight back up..
China reports production will be @ 90% by next week !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!we are presently running @70%
Anyone know how this stock will react to the earnings call?
what happened to the 10 a share dividend
BUY BUY BUY...PLEASE KEEP IT GOING....UP 28.00 DOLLARS IN 12 DAYS...KEEP IT GOING.....
This one is a long hold. Cannot see this stock at least being $800-$1000/ share by 2030. Not to mention an always improving dividend.
So far any body looking at a graph today.Cost. Shorts are losing every measure so far.
"Last earning red AH and big green the next day , $325-$330 tomorrow"
"Bought Costco on this nice dip/opportunity. Now, can't wait for the pandemic to end so they start having samples again, and full food court menu."
Earnings not good enoughThese hedge funds will pull everything out
Target increased again340.00
costco isn't oversold none of that crab..its being shorted.
I keep hoping for good earnings and guidance but it rarely happens.
All this fund mgrs are trying to push down COST for their quarterly investment gain. IMO
Thank you again for theSILLY DIPS........................................new highs soon !
Wait for the sellers to PANIC before adding more....................
NEW. ALL. TIME. HIGH.
This was a buy the dip imo.. time will tell. The China bs will be over withjust like Nafta. Trump is a businessman. Don’t forget that
Closed my position late yesterday at $313.25 after moving down my sell limit from $314. Would have hit that (and more in fact) so I left $1.25 per share on the table but very glad I got off this bus for now. Premarket and news looks ugly for the short term here.....
"To me still better than savings acct.And definitely not looooosing, I love shopping at Costco. But I really misses those small samples."
"a retirement choice, buy today and sleep on it, use the dividends to pay ur membership and daily purchases from it"

Costco reports earnings this week and should put an end to this selling. I call an great up week for Costco stock. Upswing!
split ....2:1
next Fibo level is 352.00
"Longtime Costco member, new shareholder since March. Doubled down this morning at $296, doubting any further dips to $280 but who knows? Dividend beats my savings account. Just hope to keep up with inflation as national debt goes through the roof."
Doubled up my CNK just now. I also got back into $LL and $COST today! Still 33% in cash looking for more opportunities! I’d happily double up on any of these 3 with any weakness!
"I,be paid $130 for the membership and o,be gotten back over $600 and plus cost rebate check for $ 150ish on my cash back , and I get a deals on my selected items, also I get a quality meat from the meat Dept and also dairy products, plus gas at a $2.00 plus what a savings in this hard times.Go Costco You,re the best."
This should be a fun week.
Look what the Toggle AI website forecasts about COST￼
Crushed earnings
Good luck those that are holding. It will be good news I promise. I was in costco the other day. It was a nightmare. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When it will hit my buy price $320!!!! :(
"Special dividends were paid 2/05/15 ($5) stock was $147 a share, 5/08/17 ($7) stock was"
"COST is a great company but it is not a great stock to own. I bought at $303 back in March and it is at $300 now despite all the hype about how people are panic buying at Costo stores. If this stock goes up to say $305, I may sell and get in on some other stock with more upside potential. Any thoughts?"
Costco is going to blow away earnings. There is always a line at the 3 costcos near me and also they are doing lots of membership promotions VIA Groupon. Definitely loading up on this dip. Earnings coming 09/24 at close of market!
strange drop. why?
250 all time high tomorrow. I am feeling shorts squeezing noise already. This baby due for a big bounce
Analysts on Yahoo Finance are stating that Forward P/E of 29 is too high. I guess they seem to conveniently ignore the astronomical P/E of FANG stocks. #DoubleStandards

Is it going down on earning day like last time?
"Institutions looking for STOP LOSS orders, so they can pickup your CHEAP SHARES !"

New analyst price target of 8 per share!!
Thanks for the dips...................................
Costco is always packed on any day of the week. On Sale items I wanted to buy online including a TV and an Espresso Machine are all sold out. This is a great sign so I look forward to add to my position.
"Net sales for the quarter increased 7.3 percent, to $36.45 billion-Mount breathers on WS guesstimate 36.55--- EPS= 1.89 on est of 1.85 (+.04 per share surprise)...the sky is not falling. Remember that April was a stinkeroo...They and shareholders will be just fine."
"Agree. Cost is not a get rich quick stock. Rather, it is stable, strong and does what needs to be done, and then some, to be competitive and advance. It has done a great job in satisfying its customers and sustaining its good brand image.￼ Anyone I’ve talked to about cost, regardless of their economic status, has had a positive attitude toward cost and no criticism, except for parking!Solid, steady and smart is how I would describe The performance of this company. In my view, that equals a good investment.￼￼"
Where’s all the negative posts now lol. Boom green
Grocery store stocks take a beating on report that Amazon will launch its own chain of supermarkets - https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/01/grocery-store-stocks-take-a-beating-on-report-that-amazon-will-launch-its-own-chain-of-supermarkets.html
Long term you can't go wrong with Costco. They're building more stores every year while others are closing and/or downsizing.
Net sales increase over 14%This is a must have core holding !
could there be a special year end dividend coming?
shorts gonna get BURNED............................
This drop might be due to stop loss investor placed and it took them all out so we'll see a bounce up tomorrow or next week
The price going down AH makes no sense at all!
"My best stock by far, keeps making new highs. Too bad no special div"
"Now that's what we should be seeing more of, Just over the wire, one analyst raised it's price target for Cost. and One Analyst Says Its High Valuation Is Justified!"
"This will run next week if markets don't crash, currently price probably is manipulated to kill last day option premiums"
COST and AAPLjut BUY and HOLD !your safest bet on this market volatility !
"After two days, shorts will cover it @$400 :)"
"Thanks to the inflation news, we could load up at this dip today! However, compared with TGT and WMT, wholesale king COST’s business and stock are both benefiting the biggest from Inflation!"
Still Overbought. Maybe a Buy at 180.
We are looking at a Cost 2-1 split on next earring report with stock hitting $185 plus.
$330 tomorrow!
Anyone know why COST is appearing in Yahoo's trending tickers today?.. any news I am missing?
My other call was that we won't see Costco go below $300.....nope. Not gonna happen lol
"It looks like everything is being manipulated in a downward trend, from stocks with strong balance sheets to precious metals. Where is the oversight? The stock market has truly become a lawless, wild west."
"I bought COST after the ""experts"" sold off because they were suggesting Amazon was going to destroy Costco's valuation.It was a nice dip to get in on. I'm a long time loyal customer and admire how they treat their employees not to mention me."
this whole week and last week has been a sell off... tomorrow is generally a sell day too
Nothing like a good panic. The sky is falling. HAHA
Apparently the CC is not good news. Selling off after being green (barely) earlier! Not a good sign.
"Back to 200, Time to buy in bulk"
"WOO HOO, and another raises PT. to $330 yes!!!!!!Analyst Actions: Loop Capital Raises Price Target for Costco Wholesale to $330 From $305, Reiterates Buy Rating"
cost losing its edge...KR is taking over
BUY orders are in !just waiting for more PANIC selling !
Don't count on Costco's success in China. No warehouse/membership type of operation has succeeded in China in the past. It has been tried many times and failed each time. The Chinese market does not support that type of model.
"Lets vote; thumbs up earnings good, thumbs down earnings bad"
Business now fighting back @ TRUMP over tariffs....................ENOUGH is ENOUGH..............................
BUY here under300.00
Hopefully stock drops on earnings. That way we can get a great company at lower prices.
Dow goes way under 20000 tomorrow with Apple massive revenue miss and terrible mfg. data in US.
Anyone in China with a Costco membership card automatically gets +1 social credit points!
"Analyst Scot Ciccarelli reiterated an Outperform rating and $381 price target on Costco on Thursday. He says the discounter should be able ""to increase its U.S. store base by more than 400 warehouses or about 75% over time which, at current expansion rates, enables nearly 20 years of incremental unit growth."""
"Costco is expected to report its March sales results, for the five weeks ending April 5, on April 8."
why is heading to 300. losing to Amazon every day. they have nothing special except at this store.
I don't know it was that said the Chinese people like being a part of a membership because it has some social status attached to it but this just a lot of hot air. There is no truth to it. I see that after just one day (1 day) people here are already jumping to wild conclusions expecting Costco to fly through the roof by expanding throughout China. You have all forgotten the lessons taught by Sam's Club who has been in China for 20 years and still only has 26 warehouses.I hope Costco does well but I'm realistic. It will be a long and slow uphill battle in China. The next frontier in about 2-3 generations will be India.
This quarter earning will break records. Maybe they will open a couple more stores paid in full with it lol
bought more AMC stock
Higher covid wages and sanitation costs killed earnings
this stock was destroyed last week for no reason other than valuation.
Costco Wholesale Corp.’s November sales rose 15.1% to 15.67 billion.
COST roars as the new national lockdown kicks in again.
Stores open usually 15 minutes early. Parking is close. Need Gas? Go on a non shopping day 1 hour or more before opening or 1/2 hour or more after store closing. NO Lines. Easy Peesey
Shorts better cover or they will be setting up a GoFundMe to cover their L
I live in Puerto Vallarta Mexico. The Costco here is packed 7 days a week.
Special dividend soon.
Love the selling prior to earnings !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
do not buy this stock right now. its going to head down to 260~280 range after the earnings report.
up 5 dollars already
"NOTICED COMMENTS THAT SHAREHOLDERS SEEM TO BE HAPPY WITH FALLING STOCK PRICE THINKING THEY CAN PICK UP SHARES EVEN CHEAPER. BETTER RE-EVALUATE THIS PREMISE. IT IS NOT....I REPEAT...NOT A BUY, WITH NARROWING PROFIT MARGINS AND GROWING EXPENSES. I HAVE A BETTER IDEA, TRY A 4 FOR 1 STOCK SPLIT, PLUS BUY BACK SHARES, RETURN DIVIDEND TO SHAREHOLDERS. THE STOCK IS TOO VOLATILE AND SHEDS 20 POINTS WITHIN DAYS AS A NORMAL FACET."
almost everything is in a nose dive today.. thought costco would be up though
when is the results date?
Trump walking ALL OVER Sleepy Joe........
"Costco Wholesale (COST) edged higher early Thursday after its March same-store sales showed another strong month for the discounter.Costco said comparable sales for the period ended April 4 rose 16%, ahead of consensus expectations, or 11.1% excluding the impact of fuel and foreign exchange. U.S. core sales climbed 11.3%, while e-commerce jumped an adjusted 54.5%.Total traffic climbed 3.3%, while order totals were up 12.3%."
"Overall, Costco's same-store sales jumped 11.5% last month, above the 7.5% forecast by Consensus Metrix. Same-store sales in the U.S. climbed 11%, beating estimates for a 7.6% gain. Those sales were up 8.4% in Canada and 18% in other international locations, also topping forecasts.Costco e-commerce same-store sales spiked 85.8%.Target $450!"
"Just remember SMART people will find a way to get around to avoid paying fee like cost sharing membership fees, one person in the family will buy the membership only and all other families and relatives go in to shop together and then pay back the other person later when they get home."
costco will 2x in few years... in good or bad time costco will always be solid.
"Costco management highlighted a strong membership renewal rate (91% for U.S. and Canada), ending the quarter with 59.7 million membership households. thats a real positive !look for stimulus $$$ to start rolling in."
Look at those beautiful numbers! Do we get to $160 today?
good numbers! will be green in few hours
This should be higher
"I see it going up today, 310 by end of the day"
294.00 and 304.00 coming
COST is an Investment NOT a day trade !
"nice er.. big time beat.. up big in the AM $$$"""
Insane drop for no reason. Inversion curve means nothing at all.
As I mentioned last week(5 days ago)when Costco was at $156 Costco will go over $160 and please feel free to check. My call for Costco this week is to close at $165-$168.Have a great week trading.
"""I like this A LOT. Smart company, smart management. I am a member, don't own the shares, but no reason not too.""My other post...Well, BRK-B owns Costco, so no need to really. But I like Costco."
Big news .. cost turned green .. lol
Lucky I also bought Anab a few weeks ago. Expect a double soon for Anab. GSK is involved with Dostarlimab.Good luck.
tomorrow costco hitting 350!
"Net sales for the quarter increased 10.5 percent, to $39.26 billion from $34.63 billion last year. Net sales for the first 24 weeks increased 8.1 percent, to $74.49 billion from $68.94 billion last year.Price will be rising in the am!!!"
Every storm ends and I'm convinced that we're very close to hitting the bottom. Nothing fundamentally wrong with this company so don't worry. It's down $50 or 12% down from its highs which Isn't much on a grand scale. Patience is a virtue.
COST should have at least the same PE as AMZN.
"Has Costco been buying back stock like everyone else? If not, should they have?"
"COST needs to open up 100 stores next month, if it can. Don't forget that China has 1.4 billion population. The thing that COST surprises me is WMT is not successful. The viral clip of the customers try to get everything from the shelf promoting COST itself, may be the Chinese tourists who come to visit the US store may spread the words that COST is the cheapest store in US., that is why we see the video clip. I bet you that clip will be seen more than 100 million times by this week. It is just so funny."
Yeah it needs to but it wont
"Reduced position in COST due to recent 10+% runup in relative short time. Shares are acquired when it hits $310 to $320 recently and it trades at a high PE multiple when compared to WMT and TGT. It should be trading at a premium due to its subscription based model, just not sure about the amount."
If market is down tomorrow COST will be down mucho.
COST is a buy here great sale price.
"Watch put for 202 tomorrow, if it crosses 202 and stay above all day that’s a bullish signal"
"SYMBOL. $COST. SHARES. GAIN/LOSSCRM. $94K. 400. ($3902 loss)SPCE. $1,075. 100. $3011 gain"
Costco is a value play with a growth story; market overreaction to minor IT issue will be corrected soon enough and it is a great buying opportunity now. Forward PE at a reasonable 26 and PEG ratio 2.5 way lower than Walmart 3.5. I would bet on Costco any given day than Walmart at this valuation and intriguing business model.
new 52wk soon
so much for that nice gain yesterday
"Within 10 days it will be at another all time high, it just happens every time there is a dip on earnings!"
Does anyone know if Costco has earnings report 5/28 before market opens or after close?
"But they don't seem to have plans to provide delivery or any other services that others such as WMT or AMZN. Yes they have ""buildings and some good locations for the limited market but the chance to be a viable against the two competitors listed will be very difficult for them.My opinion is that they have a ""Nickel & Dime"" management philosophy."
"Been holding COST for over 12 yrs , always bounces back..........................................."
"The COST is not only a great stock already, look at the growth and customer satisfaction, the Covid makes it even more attractive.And then, Costco hasn't even scratched the surface yet on online sales, when these channels take off, Costco could be Amazon Killer.Just Imagine, Online portal + stores, people would it!!"
"Best retail stock in the market, will continue to grow as it offers great prices and services providing customers complete satisfaction."
"Coming in 2021 — All stores reopening to full capacity. Supply chains returning to normal. A new store opening in Canada, and possibly opening stores in the US and Canada. Reducing wages from the pandemic boost. More customers leaving the house to shop. All of this points to increased earnings ahead."
This rocket is just getting started again. Today is the beginning of the downturn end.
$355 next week.
Wait for Cramer to pump this tomorrow morning just like he did with ZM today and made me bank
"Down $2.97/share x 440,000 shares. The cost of virtue signaling. Show me the cheese, Pimento that is."
"If you do not already own COST, you will be kicking yourself a year from now if you didn’t buy this dip. Just look at the long term chart and consider how many were made wealthy by simply holding (gratefully)."
Missed opportunity to get in as price skyrockets. Investors want the special dividend!
think this result looks good Thumbs up. Bad Thumbs down.
Guy on CNBC said COST could be a $400 stock 
"Recent shorting of this stock lowered the price. However, many would consider this a risky stock to short. Hedge funds and others can get burned and likely will."
COST: 305 this week
Worst ER out of all the retailers. Total disaster...sit tight...going to be bumpy ride down towards $200
I will hold until next Thursday when COST reports the monthly sales.
Costco is up $50 over a year ago today and paid a $10 dividend. What's not to like!
COST is great but today. Earnings will be announced this Thursday after hour. It could shoot up to 360. Don’t miss your chance.
close the stock market for 2 wks
Who is paying 3200 a share for Amazoo with a p/e of 122 And no dividends. I wish Costco had a p/e like that. Amazoo is a RETAILER that owns very little property but loves to spend money. Good Luck to the AMAZOO Fans. I use them occasionally but would never waste my money with stock.
"Trump won't be badgering Costco. Costco is selling American and other products TO the Chinese collecting Yuan and repatriating that into U.S. dollars, thus lowering the trade deficit. Trump is focusing on manufacturers in China, as they sell products and components TO the U.S. which increases our trade deficit with China, as we pay U.S. dollars for those products and components that are converted into Yuan. U.S. retail stores selling in China is a plus not a minus to the U.S., so Costco and Walmart etc are not in the crosshairs of Trump, although these retailers may be in the crosshairs of Pres. Xi. Trump is trying to get China to lower Chinese tariffs on the various items Costco, GM, etc. are selling in China so their saies will rise as lower Chinese tariffs will make the products cheaper to Chinese buyers. Past efforts and tactics over decades have failed to attain results, so Trump is changing tactics through the use of tariffs. You may disagree with this tactic, so what is your suggestion given past failures to even the tech transfers and trade deficit?"
"this is decent ...Costco: Feb. Adjusted Comparable Sales Up 4.6% Overall, 5.7% for U.S.>COST"
"20 day moving average is ~$234, COST should not move away from this level too far. It may bouncing around $235 for a few days."
"The greenhouse industry is hot and fresh produce keeps increasing in demand. I’ve been adding to my $GRF position, Greenrise Foods and $APPH. They own almost 100 acres of greenhouses in Leamington. They bought all of Mastronardi Produce (Sunset Brand) greenhouses as well as another 30 acres last month. They have Major distribution channels like $WMT & $KR . Their peers are trading around $30 while this stock is still at ground level. Time to load up!"
"Under 300.00a ""GIFT"""
"Some $COST beans made at home, never going to $SBUX unless Iam traveling. Will retire a year early."
"Crazy, I'm down $5k in less than a month!"
Anticipating $420 by 4/20
Grab'em while it's under $300!
Still over $300 a share!!
$400 is coming but still it's only 12% of Amazon. Why? Not saying they should be equal but they should be closer.
https://thefly.com/news.php?symbol=COST
New starting Costco wage= $16/hour. Will put pressure on other large retailers to follow suit.
COST will be green by the end of trading tomorrow
PELOSI taking the USA into permanent Recession !
"P/E is too high and with economic turmoil more people are putting off larger purchases. I will wait, but recommend to my wife to hold her COST shares."
You gusy realize COST is a $400 stock right? Have you guys seen the traffic at COST? They spent more money for their employee wages but they'll make up for it in sales as they continue to increase revenue. Watch the steady climb. It'll probably go to $350 by the end of March/early April.
This trades almost too funny to look at itDown every day
I bought a grip of Costco stock last week and immediately lost money. Bad purchase.
Looking pretty cheap. Buy
"Honestly, my family has been spending very minimally at Costco this month."
500k traded in the last few minutes of the regular trading hours...130k already after hours. Looks like things are about to get interesting.
"When the smoke clears, you've got one of the best run companies on the planet, a record year despite a worldwide pandemic, a business model that has proven itself year after year, reliable dividend payouts, very low debt and boat loads of CASH in the bank. Let me say it again, BOAT LOADS OF CASH. Aside from the idiot hairball and a couple others, most people with half a brain will do VERY well here if you just stay with the program. If you're that upset, sell it and move on. Just don't look at the price in 6 months or a year because you'll throw up a hairball from the money you lost. Relax....."
All my other stocks are going up 10 percent today. What is wrong with COST?
The shopping experience is uncomfortable and everyone is required to mask up. Even 5 percent declines will hurt.
Will this every break this resistance? Ping pong ball between 299-310
Quality product already selling at $wmt and $cost. Beyond meat is the only real competition. They are at $150 a share. These are bargain prices I see $40 PT easy. They are only growing.
remember those 2 minutes that we were in the green? good times.
do we hear any special divs?
this dip allows me to buy more .thank you !
"TELL ME WHY MGT DECIDED TO GO TO $16 AN HOUR ??? YOU ADD TO HEAVY EXPENSE. THE AVERAGE IS ACTUALLY CLOSER TO $25 AN HOUR. THATS OVER $50,000 A YEAR TO STOCK SHELVES. DOES THAT SOUND REASONABLE TO YOU ? GENIUS."
COST dropping because WMT earnings not up to par.
"""Analyst Actions: Argus Lifts Price Target on Costco Wholesale to $350 From $330, Reiterates Buy Rating""$350 before mid yr. is a given IMO though."
Best stock to hold
this will go back to 165 fast.
Loaded up with calls now. this selloff is way overdone. Costco is a powerhouse!
"From an investment standpoint, Costco’s won’t double for a while. BJ’s sells at less than half the multiple on a P/E scale, are growing at a much faster rate, and has much more growth in store."
"N T E C has optionsN B R V as well.when the russell 200 starts moving 250 million and lower biotechs best place to be.Sector rotation out of other areas, software, security, retail etc.if goog beats apple to a watch phone without a cell needed nearby and possibly a short range wakie talkie, you'll get more than that.wow aapl really strong lately, something is likely up we don't know...because goog bought fit I wonder if both are close to watch phones without cell needed nearby?guys snap work off of not with facebooks portal.once those last 3 market makers still not finished loading let go of their lean dows back and forth, ntec goes right over 3 dollars, market cap is insanely cheap like nbrv... push downs are over, likely two or three weeks of biotech gains in a row while both hedge funds and mutual funds accumulate the cheapest biotechs at 2015 levels.It sure feels like the right time, 5g is as fast or faster than fios fiber optic which was inanity.When baba drops it sure drops just as tsla does. 3 trading weeks still left 4 biotech gains, nowhere else for sure though on % gainers level.load on cheap biotechs for jan, feb fund accumulation."
POWELL better have something good to say about rate cuts.
will tomorrow be green?
"Maybe earnings increase $1 per year for the next 10 years. Brings todays 40 PE to about 18. Seems like a modest expectation given the current years performance and the increased credibility Costco has earned during this crisis. Plus add in China with its 1 warehouse. There are what, 600 warehouses in the US? China has 3 times the population. If Costco is all about price and quality, how is that going to fail? All I am saying is that people and institutions will trade the stock up and down but the underlying asset keeps getting better. Also, yeah maybe November's 13% sales increase was a disappointment, lol, but remember Covid 19 has gotten a lot worse, so maybe 13% is stellar."
Yup. Once again....correct!! $8 up yesterday and today up over $3 so far. $11 up in 2 trading day lol. We'll be over $350 a lot sooner than you know.
I'll never get back to even..I really thought costco was a good stock
People love Costco. End of storey.
down 20 in the morning
Chart's looking a lot better.
Special dividend time soon.
"Costco already only allows 2 shoppers per membership in my area, and the aisles are wide and accommodating. I feel comfortable there. They should sell masks though, as a way to encourage use and get people into the stores."
Where is résistance??
Americans keep buying stuff despite the pandemic — retail sales rise for a third straight month !COST traffic increased almost 30%
"Way oversold! Stay Costco strong for the long haul. This company treats its employees and customers right, and will do the same for shareholders."
this will be back to 300 soon ....seems like
"Whisper (whatever that is). Costco would not be bought by Amazoo. Revenue at Amazoo could be 10 times higher than Costco, and their p/e would go down to 80."
"Costco earnings were great despite COVID last quarter.If no bad economic news comes out, It should pop above 300 by the end of today!!"
"buying Halloween candy and Christmas lights at Costco ,soon"
Come on $300!
PE way too high great time to take profits just locked in my gains.￼
Yes!
anyone think this will ever get green again?

I dumped all mine aftermarket. Don't need to wake up in morning 8% down.
FINALLY...THE PE IS NEARLY 34 EVEN AFTER THE 60 POINT DROP. DOES ANYONE THINK THIS IS STILL CHEAP ? BJ IS AROUND 14 A MORE MODERATE PRICE PE WOULD BE SAY 25 THAT WOULD ENTAIL THE STOCK UNDER 300. DOES ANYONE THINK MGT IS DOING A GOOD JOB THEN ? YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT THE STOCK IF IT GOES TO 275 ? INQUIRING MINDS WANT TO KNOW.
This is such a sure thing and dividend to boot.
"Costco should keep going up, the best is yet to come."
When anybody figures out the stock market please let me know
"The P/E on this company is justified, so many naysayers on here"
Up $18 for the week and made it close to record high... I'll take it!
The stock is overpriced so it will take time for earnings to catch up.
we had one good day this week..yesterday....pre market opening up red..really red everything we made yesterday is gone
"Hey, I like to let you know that after special dividend is paid out, the stock price will go down as well. However, if you do the math right, dipping $10 for a $380 stock is not significant! If y'all have money to buy stocks to make quick bucks, go for those vaccine bio companies. bntx, mdrn, etc., these companies will give you quick money in matter of days! but Costco is for investment not trading."
"When you see Costco's in Japan, with the number of people that shop there, then you've won the game. Long and strong baby!"
again they beat expectations on revenue and expenses..but yet the stock tanks
geezus..were getting slammed yoday..so much for that nice day yesterday..gone
red all day except 2 minutes in the open
"If there were a Costco that was close to me, I would be a regular customer. I currently shop at WMT but I am partial to both WMT and COST. I love their deals and I believe both can compete directly without cutting each other's throats. Ultimately I have made a lot of money owning both companies and have also made a killing on TGT. These types of retailers as well as the discount retailers have a bright future, unlike the traditional retailers."
Easy easy buy here. No doubt
"What's going on with Costco stockDid I missed anything?Dividend raised? Split,s ?Special D?Amy info I ,LL appreciated."
Sheep are selling first & ask questions later.
That’s a beat fellas
Short squeeze? .98% of the shares held short? Huh?
"Nothing wrong with Costco as a business. Nothing wrong with the model. However, they have a number of lot of high profit stores in South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. Japan has just announced that their entire school system will be closing down for a month. Asians are terrified and are making every effort to minimize their public exposure to potential infection in large areas. Costco, where people sample food, hang out and are so congested that people bump into one another with shopping carts and where lineups are so tight that seniors sneeze all over one another, is probably a store that is experiencing a marked slowdown in Asian traffic.I, myself, am attempting to limit my Costco visits for a bit. The daily mail in the UK reports that 14% of infected persons with coronavirus, after getting better, maintain viral loads in their system. At least 2 confirmed cases in Japan and China are online indicating that persons got sick again after getting better. So, this ain't the ordinary flu bug in terms of its ability to stick in the human body. Costco is fine, but the current macro environment for mass market destinations is not."

Will it down after earnings today?
please increase membership fee this year.
Sales impressive!
Keep selling... I keep buying
great day on the stock market...COST decided to not play
Of corse is up when I sell lol
all i know. Strong earnings are not good enough any more. The stock market is manipulated. The game is not fair anymore. The big players are too greedy to let individuals make pennies.
I bought more Costco stocks today. At this point I am just waiting. So far this stock is a joke. However I have been only following it a couple of weeks. Most of the days it has been going down. I love Costco stor but I am not sure about the stock yet.
"Comparable-store sales, excluding the impact of fuel prices and currency changes, rose 5.6% in the third quarter ended May 12, above analysts' average estimate of a 5.48% rise, according to IBES data from Refinitive.ABOVE ANALYSTS"
"Bought a Costco hot dog for lunch today. Bought my first Costco shares four months ago at 200 hot dogs per share. Today we're up to 217 hot dogs per share. Plus the drinks. Every 100 shares is 21,700 hot dogs. I'm set for life!"
NO matter what virus you have YOU STILL NEED TO BUY GROCERIES and EAT WELL.go COST go...................................
I was following pre market..and thought things might be good...but that fell through
"this is one of them stock you just never get rid of, dont know why people were selling a few weeks ago"
Productivity -2.5 vs -5.5 was much better than expected
"Costco is the best retail stock, the growth is phenomenal."
I’ve heard nothing but good reviews from customers for this business. The employees are happy as well with a 16 an hour starting wage. A large percentage of their employees have been working there for 25 plus years which speaks multitudes about the business. Their management is honest and down to earth. Their business model is very sound with constant cash flow from membership. I think this stock will slowly climb to the top and is a reasonably safe stock.
"2 days ago when the stock was $270, I said that with one excellent monthly report this stock would paint $280."
Amazon Prime a RIPPOFFFFFFFFFFthis is the only way they can make $$$ on ...................Costco is a screaming BUY here....................
one step up...and two steps back
COST = great Re opening trade stock !buy and hold here.jmho
I SEE COST GOING GREEN !!! I have been telling you since the market open but you won't listen.
Strong Buy Love this company. Bullish. https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/764789-cweb/5170832-competition-heating-costco-walmart-target-cweb-com

I've said this before..but costco used to have them days where the stock would jump $20 in one day...the stock has been sluggish..I doubt we will ever see them $20 days again
Amazon to buy Costo ?
"Costco like Walmart, Target, and others will blow past the numbers.Post earning we should see it cross 220 easily."
"In December Costco paid a $10 per share dividend, on top of its normal $2.80 dividend. The stock is very pricey at $350-375. I think the time is right for a 4 for one stock split."
"Don't even try to figure out Costco stocks movement out, just buy, hold, and smile!"
Sales growth lower in Nov. then previous 2 months. Pandemic buying is over. Sell now as COST drops back to $300.
overvalued. should be way down. slowing growth rates
"Everyone talking about millennials not being COSTCO type shoppers. Generation before them is, and they're not dead yet. In 15-20 years that argument will matter. Love my Costco gas, Costco lunch, Costco travel, and Costco price. This is a winner"
"New here, y was this down yesterday?"
I’ll get in at $150
"Stock splits tend to dilute things although they do lower the barrier of entry for investors. Many companies have ceased stock splits as a preventative measure against dilution which in a way rewards future investors more than current investors. THe new apparent trend I have witnessed is stock buybacks and regular measured , predictable dividend increases in some large growth and many large value companies. CVX recent behavior of increasing the buy back amount from the failed APC / OXY bid serves as a primary example of rewarding current investors and as a ""pull / draw strategy"" for investors seeking to invest. I think the days of stock splits vs using supply / demand incentives are dwindling. COST's avg daily volume is 1.7 million shares - I hardly see them suffering stock price / volume wise from simply issuing a one time or boosting the dividend annually strategy vs using a split to attract new lower price point investors."
bought this at 352..will it get back there
it's the government they want their money
Blow out earnings and sales. Congrats to all the longs!
"Analyst Actions: Goldman Sachs Adjusts Price Target for Costco Wholesale to $420 From $376, Maintains Buy Rating"
What does COST have to do with Tariffs ??????????????????????????????????????

$350 within 3 months
-$10 drop today for no reason
there is not enough upside for the risk with Amazon. only 200 targets
"WMT, AMZN all hittuting all time highs..why not Cost...let's go COST"
"Cost will be fine, that place is always packed."
"Analysts are just upset because Costco didn't announce a Special Dividend when the analysts were clambering for one. One of Costco's code of ethics is to reward shareholders, which they have done in spades. But COST management will never reply or react to Analysts comments because that would simply turn COST into an analyst yoyo plaything."
$400 by end of October.
Shorties better cover............
"I knew $250 was around the corner, but before earnings!!! WHO HOO, Go Costco!What a day!! Highest high and upward!"
"Hey guys, I know that this stock’s progress makes no sense right now, but IMO, in a long run it will recover. You just have to be patient. This is not a day trading stock but an investment stock. The earnings results in 2 weeks should put this stock back on track."
"Look folks, to cry about this stock being down right now is like a spoiled rich kid complaining about getting a new Corolla instead of a Mustang on his 16th birthday. Theses are not normal times. Be happy you didn’t take a 50% haircut like so many other companies stock out there."
"Sturdy Comps Performance of Costco:Comps for five-week ended Oct 1, 2017 increased 8.9%, following an increase of 7.3% in August, 6.2% in July, 6% in June, 4.1% in May, 3% in April, 6% in March, 4% in February and 7% in January. The company generated net sales of $12.40 billion in September, up 12.1% year over year. Notably, net sales increased 10%, 8.8%, 7%, 7%, 5%, 9%, 8% and 9% in August, July, June, May, April, March, February and January, respectively. Comparable e-commerce sales for the month of September surged 30%."
Wow
"PE Ratio (TTM) 32.76, enough said. Over valued, covids over in 2 months (inflation), many other places to shop. China stores will be future growth story."
"Costco has always paid their employees better than other stores, with most above $15/hr."
this has already did a $7 turn from pre mbarjet
where are all of the $400 gang at?..never gunba see $400..never..I hope it does. but very disappointed in this stock
Now it depends on the market to decide that the number is great enough. I have confidence that the number is good because the monthly sales for the last three months exceed the estimate.
I really don't understand all of you who bought for the $10 dividend. $10 on a stock that is $380...it can move $10 a day on no news. Now all who bought and held through the ex-dividend date are dumping and you are stuck with even less than you had before even if GET the dividend. Does that make sense to you?
Costco should go back to 365 by end of next week.
it depends on whose estimate you used lol ..sounds like a small beat to me
"Higher highs each day, nice and steady. Costco's business is not only safe, it will climb back up to the ""worry"" of Amazon. About one of the only dips in the market to buy these days."
Analyst Actions: Atlantic Equities Starts Costco Wholesale at Overweight With $375 Price TargetNOW we're talking how Costco will indeed make it to $400+ this yr. Oh Yeah!
All these companies dropping 40%-60% stock price while Costco is still staying strong. As soon as the market recovers Costco is skyrocketing
I'd rather see a 2 for 1 stock split than a special dividend.
Bought in a while back. Don’t live in the US and have been watching euro plans. It’s going to take on some big boys eg Geant. I’m buying more
"The Wall St. Traders react to anything, regardless of whether it affects a particular stock or not. It is a sad state of affairs and unfortunately causes alarm and damage and consequently takes much to long for a stock to recover. Best bet is ride it out, Don't sell!!"
Great buying opportunity
can anyone explain this? 15.5B in a month..and the stock falls? what kind of expectation is needed on wall st?
Trading like a tech stock. Yesterday's gain poof.
how can one day at one Costco cause the company to be worth 10% more.. everyone knew that they were opening a store....
"people all trading on technicals these days. so I suggest every one go with the flow. short term trades only, forget abt investing or you get burned. no one cares about findamentals anymore"
everytime costco starts heading to that pistol $400 mark.. $$BAM$$ OUT GO THE LIGHTS
230 soon?
buy buy buy
"such a great company. They did this probably being one of the most responsible companies regarding the virus and at times limiting their own sales restricting customers in the store. There a machine with a moral compass, rare"
Obviously the Analyst is someone who doesn't shop at Costco. They have it nailed there and it will Boom in China.
Already 1.5 million traded. The daily average volume is 2.1 million! Awesome!!!!!!
"Talking with workers at Costco about how much labor they are using to keep as many registers open to get members in and out quickly and how much their spending on sanitation crews. znot in the 31 years I worked there did I ever see that much payroll being spent on any given day, not even on the holidays."
"did everyone sell, no one is in here"
We should see +$200 by end of the year.
Going down big time tomorrow!
Never saw an empty Costco
Why is that when Kevin is wrong (which is most of the time) he runs away and hides? He's losing money BUT he will show-up soon and tell everyone that he's made a fortune!
Beat revenues and earnings Q4 and Y/Y. Own Calls on 3/20 buyers can buy them cheap at the open market is planning.
Sold another batch of Costco stock today for a gain of $115.00
"So let's talk stock price. Honest thoughts on if this can possibly be up tomorrow since market was down so much today. OR...is logic that this Earnings Report equals down day tomorrow? If down, what's your prediction on tomorrow's open vs close for it?"
Sounds like massive special dividend time.
The best retailer in the world. No one comes close not even AMZN.
let's hsave one of them $20 up spikes today?
$10 payout Dec 10 and earnings this will double. At least.
The longer ppl shop at Costco the more they love it... the more they return... who is the competitor in this space ???
"Love the ""SALE"" price @ COST !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
COST sales soaring.......................
"PUTS, PUTS, PUTS!!!"
Amazon's prices are increasing. I compare with others and Amazon isn't competitive most of the time. I still buy Ebay and more increasingly from individual businesses online.
The covid gravey train is over.
"Look for ""on line"" sales to SURGE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"COST beat on eps 1.9 vs 1.71, but missed on revenue 37B vs 37.25B. mixed results."

"WELL IM IGNORING AFTER HOUR NOW ! FAK IT. IF GOD WANTS ME TO EARN MONEY, MY CALL WILL BE VALUEABLE TOMORROW, IF NOT JUST LET IT GO, I DONT CARE ANYMORE., ITS FRIDAY! FAK IT"
Chart is looking good
"sold 1000 shares of costco, bought 2000 shares of WMT"
"They won’t have the Thanksgiving and Christmas shopping numbers they normally would, so this will play on their earnings. Will be good but not stellar. Probably see it drop 5-7%￼"
there is no reason at all this should even open red!
Costco is one of the smartest retailers out there. International growth and e-commerce posting big gains
AMAZ should start paying 2% cash back to prime member for WFM purchases like Costco does!
CRAMER says ..just OWN IT..dont trade it !
"Congratz longs, nice move AH. Glad the last couple down days didn't deter those that held on. I reduced half my position and will hold the rest tomorrow. With the way the markets been selling off, you just never know what happens. Good luck everyone."
It will be interesting to see how many new memberships were sold so far this year. People more than ever want to buy in bulk. Canada is also running a membership promo right now. I can see membership revenues being over 3.5 billion in 2020.
COST will wash the Amazon stigma soon enough. AMZN won't hurt COST in the long run.
Last chance to sell before $250
Lol shorts are sweating!!!!!
This is a much solid company than tesla. But seems tesla gets better attention and love
"By may 1st, I see 350. Every 500 shares you own you,LL get 4 extra shares per year, genius move by costco.Costco MGMT knows how to run business, also China socialist walls been broken by Costco, then India,Vietnam,Philippine,Thailand. Up the way you go sky is the limit. IMO"

well looks like my earnings trade is becoming a long position haha
I think we've seen the bottom. Pulled the trigger at 157.
Sub $200 tomorrow
"Hang in there, will be at $170 shortly !! Costco is growing not shrinking!"
"COST is solid , has loyal customers.Prices are great, stores are full of shoppers constantly.LOOKING FORWARD STOCK PRICE COULD REACH$200.00 BY THE END OF YEAR..................................Regular dividend could be boosted up a little..............DOW down today & share price is holding steady......."
one of the biggest chains around....dow up over 500 pts....sorry..cost in the red
$350 boom ! Tom was right
an hour ago this was dipping into the green...now look at it...earnings must have leaked
Stock should be up at least $10.
Back to 200??
296 then 310
better cover shorties......................303.00 soon
let it drop more pls market!!! so we could get some at a discount
COST may not go up as much when the market is up. But it also doesn't go down as much when the market tanks. Stable and solid
This is my best stock by far. Most of my other stocks are in a bear market. It doesn't make any sense to me.
the bad thing about this is it may hurt the earnings next quarter
Cost will post April earnings this evening. I am looking for typical (for Costco recently) 10 percent increases over last year.
"EPS was $2.14 per diluted share, miss from $2.45 expected!"
"Myself, David Glass, and Sam Walton put together Sam’s clubs 35 years ago the same time Costco got started. Costco is the best retailer in the world! And was founded by the best merchant ever!"
Its time to buy this stock...
300 here we go again
This company has huge growth potential. There are only 527 Costco’s in the United States. There is so much room for growth. For instance I visited my son in Albany NY and there isn’t a Costco within 70 miles. They are a great company that picks its locations carefully and expands slowly. In 10 years the stock price can easily triple.

Divvy boost to .79/Q
Picking winning stocks is hard work when you don’t know what to do. I was losing big time until I found these guys (http://Fairstox.com). So glad I joined them.
When the markets down 1000 points this kind of reaction will happen. Its good. You can buy in cheaper with reassurance the company is doing ok
Went to Costco the other day and ate pizza . I vomited in nasty bathroom and bought pizza bagels for home . This is not worth the outrageous membership fee they charge ..
I own distributing etfs that own Costco shares. should I expect to see this 10 / share as the costco proportion of the etfs holdings? or should it be considered so special that many etfs will hold it and use it otherwise?!
Yahoo continues to virtue signal by saying we are all bad people for driving the stock down because Costco is paying their workers extra pandemic pay. I missed that meeting appointment. When did we all get together and unanimously decide to trade this 3% lower? That's some epic level cooperation right there! https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-drills-costco-stock-because-its-paying-workers-2-more-an-hour-during-covid-19-172507787.html
"This is a still a good buy, COST will do much better in 4Q due to holiday sales. Don't ever miss your chance this month. We'll see at $160+ by Jan 2017...Bet ya!!!!"
CNBC shows an earnings miss of .06 but the news release says they beat by .04 which is it?
"I like costco and want to be a shareholder, but it is hard to ignore how far behind they are in management of online sales and fulfilment; way behind Walmart, Target and of course the smiling deathstar."
"Cost is only down 8% from its peak highs. It's not really that much of a decline for long term investors ( buy and hold) . However, if you are a day trader -- gambler -- that is another story."
"All the talk of a special dividend raises interesting thoughts. I bought a few thousand shares in the mid 1990s at a single digit cost basis and have recovered all my cost basis from the dividend payments. Dividends now pay the same tax rate as capital gains. I like the dividends better than stock buybacks by the company because I can invest that money in other stocks that will now potentially produce higher returns than Costco stock would produce. Costco is now a relatively mature company so its annual rate of return is nice, but it is not a rate of return of a quality growth company. Buying back stock means that a company can't find an internal use for that money which will generate a higher return than its mature growth rate. A special dividend is a way to ""sell"" Costco stock without actually selling and using that frozen capital appreciation to redeploy into a potentially more lucrative investment. Yes, you have to pay the income tax, but hopefully using the remaining dividend money will produce returns that will compensate for the tax bill. The only way to avoid the tax on your appreciation is to die and have your heirs get a step up basis at the date of death fair market value. That is an outcome I prefer to avoid. I wish more companies would utilize special dividends rather than stock buybacks which don't always work out if the stock price falls below the buyback prices."
"People be so mad, meanwhile, I’m shopping and buying COST stock."
Below $300 is a given but how low? Will it hit $200 or less?
170% unreal!!!!!! This should fly by now
The stock will jump within 1 hour
226 after call - Easy
This VIRUS soon to be HISTORY.....................................................take ADVANTAGE OF FIRE SALE HERE............................................... people tend to PANIC...........................concentrated on only virus .......
If you have a lapse from shopping at Costco like say 3 weeks it is better if you wait 2 months before renew Costco membership you then get extra value from you membership cost. Costco structure is you will lose those 3 weeks that you have not shopped when you renew because the original anniversary stays the same. Many people use the other warehouse membership for this exact purpose. Plus you get quality brand food change instead of the same over and over again.
Costco needs to learn how to lie a bit more in their earnings reports.
Yahoo article is a joke chicken at whole food discount by $1 still $3 over Costco price lol
"how much of that $1400 is going to increase Costco revenue? I must assume a significant bump, but have no way to quantify it."
"I bought at 377, should i average down before earnings? Any suggestions"
I was at my local Costco yesterday afternoon. I couldn't believe how crowded it was. I've never seen a checkout line stretch all the way back past the frozen foods section. Almost to the pile of 30-count TP packs.
"Latest update !CostcoFor RBC Capital’s Scot Ciccarelli, Costco is a top pick in the retail space. On December 14, he maintained a Buy rating as well as a $439 price target (20% upside potential).According to Ciccarelli, “Costco just keeps doing it what it does best,” which is delivering strong sales growth and good margin performance. In its most recent quarter, the company posted comp growth of 17.1%, enabling it to generate strong leverage in fiscal Q1 2021, in the analyst’s opinion. E-commerce sales surged 86% and now account for roughly 7% of total sales.Even though U.S. comps moderated, Ciccarelli argues “this modest deceleration seemed to be driven by pull forward activity and… more aggressive Black Friday promotions starting as early as late-October from some competitors.” On top of this, gross margins reached 13.3% thanks to efficiency gains, labor productivity and significantly lower product spoilage in fresh foods.What’s more, Ciccarelli points out that Costco has the strongest buying power in the retail space because it concentrates all of its scale on a small group of SKUs, while its bigger competitors spread their buying power across millions of SKUs. Additionally, he thinks it has the lowest markup in the industry.“We believe this combination creates extremely compelling value for their members. As a result, while Costco has indeed benefitted from accelerated shopping activity as more consumer dollars are directed towards goods rather than services/experiences (what we call the Retail Lift), we believe Costco is extremely well positioned regardless of broader economic trends in 2021,” Ciccarelli opined."
guys next week going down to 187+\- $2 then the journey towards 215+ bwfore special dividend announcment any comments
time to turn .. rocket boosters.. those selling are making a mistake.. hold or buy more.

"Costco will do great in China, Chinese consumers lover Costco products.加入微信讨论群：To join the Chinese Investor Group, please add WeChat ID: ChinaInvestorGroup"
The daily morning selloff continues followed by the evening bounce back. Great trading environment.
"Breaking down 88.1 million paid members, we have 17.9 million executive members ($120/yr) and 70.2 million business/gold-star members ($60/yr). These annual membership fees total 17,900,000*120 + 70,200,000*60 = 6.36 billions/yr.Even with 2% profit margin (which brings in 2.8 billion in 2017), Costco will remain a growing, cash-printing business for many years to come."
great ER and results. still very high P/E in this environment. it needs to cool off a bet to planet earth. never forget the fundamentals
when is good time to invest in Costco
The begin of the end - comp stores sales falling.
Told you! Once step forward two steps backwards. Sorry but true
"Cramer said dont buy Costco. Remember, if we all just do the opposite of what Big Jim says, we'll be rich lol"
"Downgrade? Um, ok. Is that’s the reason I can never find a parking space and fight through the aisles in Costco? I better load up my shares at Macy’s."
Told youBUY THE SILLY DIPS........................Sales up up up.......................................
As compared to AMZN it is undervalued.
well that was a pretty good day. the only thing that could have made it better was if costco announced a special dividend coming too.
Is this just manipulation prior to earnings?
where is Kevin today
"Expected AMZN, BABA and WMT to go up after earnings. They didn’t. I don’t see many signs this will be different. But by all means take the chance. Maybe it’ll be different. Cause it’s your stock this time"
Worst E-commerce! Online order takes days or weeks. They need to fire the eCommerce Mgt and start over.
until the matter with short sellers is dealt with this will go nowhere
"Costco Private Jet - Gee, just what the doctor ordered, flying in a more restrictive, germ filled aluminum can."
"Kevin C. ""Trump is Garbage"" Sorry you shorted the stock. How was the stock market for 8 years of Obama? Please switch over to a Trump bashing website"
Hey shorty - you have been given a life line in order to cover your position. The last three trading days have seen consolidation. But when this is over you will burn. Cover now.
300 soon
Going green today
Just bought 50 shares its over done and im bearish all selling over down. short term bounce coming
"Last week was the best time to buy Costco, tomorrow it could open +4."
my local Costco's all over the city are out of stock. Las Vegas NV
"COST Holding UP like a CHAMP! Heading green soon, patience !!!"
I guarantee Costco will be over 300 in less than a month

Come on GREEN!!!! 
$300-325 coming

COST hits 300 gy year end
Is this going up tomorrow?
another 10 point drop to 310 and we're talking nearly a 30% drop (OVER 80 POINT LOSS) in the stock in 11 weeks. and everyone still feels Mgt is on top of their game ? Worth the bonus they'll get paid ?
"Costco is heading to 330 in a couple of months, of geoeconomic conditions remain stable."
COST China SOLD OUT on 90% of merchandise !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Special divi. in the works ?
BUY the dips under300.00
Released great earnings and no movement?
This things going to 400 fast with expansion into China. This is a growth stock
There she blows... past $240 while S & P and other in the red.
A downgrade a day before earnings accomplished exactly what it meant to do.
New highs today please
cost should raise the damn membership fees..and offer 1 share of stock..so the price doesn't plummet
Almost every time it ranks like that it ends up opening in the positive
is dietitian a doctor?
Good time to get in?
It might test $370. Strong support @$370.
good time to buy?
this is becoming a bad stock to own
Looks like $310 before earnings and then tomorrow we open at $290
This is a great company. Who doesn’t have a Costco card?
"After earnings, this guy will be at $325 easily :)"
I got this at $339. It will easily be in the low 340's at least today. The volatility was + or - 3%. Cost hit that on the minus side so now it easily goes up from here. It's all about growth!!
costco for life.
"COST has 45 million gold memberships,average 50,000 per store. $ 60 a pop. renew rate over 92%. China store is not record in 10K. Guesstimate 100,000 membership per store, $45 per year per member. If COST can open up 20--30 stores per year."
"Whole Food my foot, COST has recovered the damage."
PUTS will print big tomorrow morning. It will be an amazing day
"l think cost raise it's things price to boost it's sales growth , excluding it's things price raise, it's sales maybe decline, cost profit margin too low and Amazon too strong, plus retail price looks decline in April, so I think cost maybe down to $86 per share,"
"When the recession hits, the Trump supporters will ALL become Democrats, overnight."
GREAT BEAT!!!!!
I've held this stock for 20 years and still not selling
All aboard ???????Train leaving soon !
Opening day demonstrates the potential and demand of Costco in China. Dramatic growth is absolutely certain.
my bad boys i bought before earnings
Last chance to get in before $350.
Will it break 200 today??
this stock is stuck . great earnings. why doesn't it go up?
Targets maintained 342.00-348.00
as long as it stays above the 10ema I'm happy.
Keep hearing that there are big cost over runs on the broiler project in Nebraska which Costo is currently building. Seems like this may put the cost of chicken at a price disadvantage versus their competition. Has anyone else heard of this?
"Common $270, next hurdle IMO $300.The way it's going doesn't seem to be a problem.Mighty thankfully to own a nice handfull of Cosco stock"
Cramer told me to buy before earnings announcement. Wonderful.
Higher Corp Taxes...Endorsed by Yellen. Hurts Retail More Than Any Other Industry
"Ahh, duffus Bernstein just wants to get in the great run starting after Oct 4th earnings ."
that was the bottom folks!
"The overselling is a BUY opportunity !Costco does not need to even think about whole foods. Costco just needs to be Costco. Their business model works, June's earnings were fine, July's should be fine. The stock may have risen a bit too fast with the giddiness of the $7.00 special dividend payout."
"Hey COST faithfuls, I know it has been tough watching this stock fall down day after day which IMO makes no sense. We have the earnings call today and I would not be surprised if it went even lower after that despite good results. I owned a lot of ETSY stock last year and after a great earnings call in the fall, the stock plummeted 12.5% next day. Made no sense and lot of people sold. A week later it took off and never looked back. I am glad I did not sell and neither will I now on this temporary senseless dip by COST. If you can’t watch it anymore, just stop following it and come back in a month. You might be pleasantly surprised then. Have a great day everyone."
$270 by the end of the month
$10 dividends coming to town.
At this rate it's gonna close above 320.
in these markets COST GD ABBV GILD MDT to name a few
"As a current Costco employee (supply chain) I can vouch for their efficiencies, above average wages, and overall strong business model. Their moat is wide, and not as vulnerable to wage pressures as other major retailers"
New target now345.00
"Looking good @ #320.65 AH, tomorrow it will jump nicely.I sure love my Costco shares :-)"
"Not as bad as the recent stock price drop had feared. Stock price will bounce back, as usual :)."
Charlie Munger (Buffet's partner) portfolio is like 30% Costco.... good enough for him... good enough for me.
Well lost my money on puts but will make good profits on the calls. wasnt sure which way this one was going to go so did both to hedge my bet. hope this price holds until open.
The stock is overpriced so the earnings need to catch up with the stock price.
How and why does a robust company like Costco decide to split their stock? 2:1 or 4:1 or whatever?
CRAMER sounds extremely bullish on Cost and Wmt as well
"Best company in the world, its going to the moon."
"When cab drivers and waiters are saying sell Costco, it's time to buy Costco."
Just BUY and HOLD on any weakness here.
This is good news!
well over reaction from the market. A slight miss only.
"Can some one explain me the dividend! I bought yesturday 80 shares, will I get dividend and how much?"
"""Wall Street drills Costco stock because it's paying workers $2 more an hour during COVID-19"" Really?...."

More Panic Better entry pointLoad up on these temporary PANIC SellingCOT is doing better now then ever !
BUYING on this dip.... COST is a solid performer with great guidance and NO china exposure.
Look for Upgrades soon.
Why so cheap?
I lost $1500 in stock values while I was in line at Costco
Buffet is loading up
"Reports April Sales Results for Costco Wholesale Corporation is out and it shows that Costco sales for April is down -4.7%. So, despite seeing lines of people waiting to get into Costco, Costco is not immune to the effects of COVID19. Sales is still down. What is interesting is why the sales were down. Without the numbers from Gasoline sales, the sales were only down -0.5%. When excluding Gasoline, Optical, Travel, Food Court, Hearing Aids, Photo, and foreign exchange, the sales went up by 8.6%. What surprised me is that Costco Gasoline contribute this much to this Costco Sales. Costco only started selling Gasoline about 4 or 5 years ago. As, the country opens back up, sales of other departments that were lagging should pick up. I think Costco did well in April. Should the general public view this as negative, maybe the stock would drip down. If stock goes down big, this would be a buying opportunity. I will be watching like a hawk tomorrow."
I got to buy COST because I don't believe that COST will go to the toilet.
"I'm back in the red. At this point, I hope it goes down more so I can buy a lot more. Time to dollar cost average. Can I get under $320?"
Rice sold out at COSTCO locations; don't hoard..potato can be a substitute.

Walter... I thought $7 once per year and $0.5 every 3 months (quarter)... Am I wrong or it's $2 dividend per quarter?
Wells reported a downgrade with a $235 price target. This is a buy on a dip.

"Somebody knows something and it’s beyond bad, that’s why the big boys are jumping ship!!!!"
299.00-300.00Great entry point.
"COST is UNDERVALUED hereIt wasn’t long ago that shoppers were flocking to Costco (COST) to stock up on groceries as coronavirus cases first hit the Northeast ahead of state lockdowns across the country.Now, as a similar spike in cases hits Texas, Florida and Arizona, Costco might benefit from more of that — but perhaps more importantly, as one data firm points out, their membership model might benefit regardless of renewed panic buying.According to location analytics firm Placer.ai, the wholesaler was already seeing a steady rise in store visits as the pandemic situation started to improve in mid-April. Visits rose from a nearly 30% year-over-year drop in April to a 14% decline in May to only a 6.5% drop in June, according to Placer.ai data."
sold..didnt want to..but this is just broken
"Easy- Sell at open, cover at dipsUp too much too fast"

"Yeah, Trump knows what he's doing... thank God he does because if he didn't, the DOW might have really tanked today!!"
i'm ready for $300 a share.
When will they announce Sept sales numbers?
"COSTCO is a great buy because once Clorox and Lysol wipes become available to everyday folks, there will a mad rush to buy them as people will want to stock up on these and other supplies for the coming winter. Revenue can only go up in the foreseeable future."
COST and AAPLUpgraded !
Cramer said COST isCHEAP here now.
HUGE BEAT! A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!! $$$
So who didn't like the June sales numbers?
"Up over $50+ a share since March ( 1 Month ago ) lows of $306. #$%$ was the point of the lengthy sell off we had from Dec - end of Feb lol. It's not that far off now from its highs. Anyway, carry on."
COST always worth buying the silly dips...................................
I see $270 in the short term but shouldn’t hurt too much in the long run. Buy in low $270’s when they get there?
"Costco is killing it in sales have you been to a Costco this week?sold out of water, toilet paper, Lysol, alcohol pads, gloves, rubbing alcohol. And now they are limiting cases of water per person to 2 or 3"
Very small shares being traded AH. Hopingfor a mice run tomorrow. Great EPS beat! Boom!
I sure hope the market stabilizes tomorrow. It was a tough day to be an investor.
"My friend works for Costco. He says that Costco is a solid company that has a lot of upside. I am a sizable shareholder and love this company. The Y to Y percentage increases are fantastic. I predict a special dividend in September, start of FY 2019. The last 2 were $7 a share."
this thing is going to roll. major runs on the warehouse are underway for bulk supplies
added 100 shares $307.53
earnings must have just leaked..I hope the CEO will announce his resignation
"COST is in the race to become a short-term winner and is very likely to reach $ 390 before the earnings date, according to Zacks, COST is projected to report earnings of $2.37 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 12.86%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $43.53 billion, up 11.41% from the prior-year quarter. Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $9.95 per share and revenue of $184.12 billion. These totals would mark changes of +12.43% and +10.41%, respectively, from last year.It is also worth noting that COST currently has a PEG ratio of 4.17. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Retail - Discount Stores was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.53 at yesterday's closing price."
"why not email the ceo and let them know, they should have been buying back stocks..so hedge funds couldn't short this into oblivian..email them"
"what is wrong with this stock? anyone know? why does it continually spike...and out of nowhere just come crashing down,?"

Love to see $360 today!
"In the past 3 months, Costco has sold more low margin stuff that people need in Corona times, so they have been hurt in 2 ways:1. High margin stuff is not on the shelves2. COVID related expenses have hurt the margins.Despite that revenues are up nicely!!!We should be good!"

"Wow, for long, today's price is really good and a bargain. This opportunity doesn't come often. Cheaper than usual. Buy more if you have some extra $ cash to spend. I don't know #$%$ willing to let go and sell their shares today. Perhaps the squeezed short sellers had to sell their long positions (COST, etc.) to cover their losses with GME, AMC, BBBY, etc. Anyway I bought some shares today."

Look for upgrades soon !400 is considered CHEAP !
I brought-up the possibility of a COST split and all of the pseudo-geniuses here went out of their way to try and shoot the idea down. Now we see TESLA and APPLE both splitting so I guess it really must be a bad idea. Some of you need to wake-up and stop pretending.
Up or the usual down after earnings??

"A single Costco superstore stocks about 3,700 items. You are less likely to find empty shelves here compared to other places. Walmart stocks about 140,000 items and Target has around 75,000. This is good news in case virus cases continue to rise and states go on lockdown again(which will happen)."

TGT beat but didn't issue guidance. Thus its getting slammed! Mr. Market doesn't like that! I sure hope COST does issue some sort of guidance!

Getting frustrated is what they want. I am frustrated now but I know better to not let it get the bestof me. The market knows how to flush out excessive margin and that is what this maybe now because the stock is acting extremely weird! Never buy stocks on margin!
"The price is high because the performance has been strong and the outlook is bright. Same store numbers have been solid, e-commerce growth has been ample, and new market opening—i.e., China—portends great opportunity. When I read the earnings release, I was happy. When I saw the markets initial negative reaction, I disagreed and felt that the market got it wrong (but I was humble enough to wonder if I didn’t comprehend the market and analysis). I stuck to my philosophy that this is a strong company that has a price cent track record and bright prospects, and is the kind of company one should invest in if one has a long term view of things. Based on that, I expected that the price would recover in a matter of weeks, but I was proven wrong in that because it took only hours."
Record sales multiple days. Granted even at 280 the stock is fully priced or overvalued....dont get stuck on price and anchored to an high mark.
"Cotsco is doing everything right but its stock price has been frankly disappointing. I recall that the stock was trading at roughly $390 shortly prior to the $10/share special dividend. This stock closed today at $334 but until it gets above $350, I will continue to complain."

"Costco Reports Internal Control Issue, Sending Shares Lower."
Target's growth is twice Costco. That is what the market wants.
Market is pricing in an economic slowdown.
Costco is acting just like Nike did.Came out with a great quarter but lost right after earnings. Nike came back to gain 33%. I see the same with Costco. Glad I grabbed 200 shares at $339.
"None of this past week matters, games or what ever, who cares who was behind it, I don't. Come earnings beginning of Oct..... it will flying back above $300 again. Not a concern in the world!!"
380 then 400.....
Tomorrow we will know more. Might be able to pick up more shares for this great company at cheaper prices. Hoping for at least a 5% drop. It’s a win either way. I will buy on the dip or pop
YES Great earnings guys. $400
Down $9.44. What niwit lib took the cheese away?

Just bought another 100 shares
Beat or fail ?
Winner winner chicken dinner. Or it is too early?
Given WMT's quarter I expect good things for COST on earnings day.
Why not put the money towards China build out of stores? The special dividend is good but increasing store count in China will be better use of company capital.
ppl should be buying this..best place to invest
"it will be back to $370 soon, just a little year end adjusting and profit taking."
COST breaking through all time highs.
Why is there no info about guidance? Impact of tariffs and potential increase in minimum wage on margins?

I'm not worried with the pullback today. 5 Consecutive trading days in the green. It will be fine.
"I don’t understand why people would get excited with Special Dividends. It is just like paying yourselves and taking some money off the table. A stockholder is an owner. When Special Dividends are paid, it is just taking money from the business you own. This is not free money. The money is removed from the company. The net worth of the company would be reduced by the amount of the dividend distributed. Costco is a growth stock and buying it for dividends is a wrong move. Dividends are taxed as income and if a stock is held for more than a year, the gain would be taxed as Long Term Capital Gain. Long Term Capital Gain are taxed at a more favorable rate. Unless the stock is held in a tax-free account (IRA/401K), Special Dividends would increase the tax for most people."
$380 soon!
"does anyone see a split being offered at the shareholders meeting, maybe give this a boost somehow?"
This will finish green it’s a deal. Once they launch Costco delivery it will moon 
now is the time to split? tell me some reasons why a split isn't a good idea?
Buy and hold until death due us part.
Serious question. What is the last day to buy more to have the record date of dec2 so that i get the bonus!
Members will soon be spending their stimulus checks at Costco on high ticket items. Cha ching!
"How can you buy this over bj wholesale club, look at its marketcap, growth rate, better management.Long wtrh because of the june 16th meeting. Prty because of earnings next week.

"I just wonder if its the algorithm that is messing things up? dont know anyone who has sold, dont know why this stock is falling, it's one of the best"
If this closes at $160 or above then I will eat a hat
Chart indicating the low ATM; should be heading up Monday.
dare I say that there is probably no other stock better than COST from an investment perspective as of today?
why does this stock doesn't go anywhere stuck at low 300$? shouldn't it be flying like Amazon?
This is my best stock by a country mile. All of my other stocks are in a bear market.

Straight from nasdaq website last 12 Qtrs when down after hrs.... 4(events) 80% percent chance next day also down so you commentors saying up tommorow well the nasdaq info odds don’t look very good. Just historical facts folks doesn’t mean it will stay down this time . I’ve got calls myself but hey I didn’t learn from May earnings they beat also and it dropped. Might be time for put spreads instead of call spreads. Lesson learned 2 times in a row is enough for me.
Upgrades stabilize stock price pretty soon
Costco isn’t gonna make us tons of money but it’s relatively safe and steady. I have about 20% of my stocks in it and it’s in the middle of the pack and doesn’t give me a heartburn
COST to distribute Vaccines in Canada soon.
"Given Wells Fargos recent massive scandals, I'm hesitant to believe anything they say."
"Like some investors, before I make a stock buy, I would go over the research reports, the charts and the news. All the matrices are reviewed. This would include the PE ratio, PEG ratio, Dividends, Earnings, Market Cap and …. (I do my due diligence). I actually did not mention the most important metric. That is the Price of the Stock. All other matrices really do not matter as long as the Price is moving at the right direction. Take Costco for an example, people would say it is too expensive as it has a relative high PE. The problem with this statement is there is not really a relative stock that is similar to Costco’s business model. Costco makes most of the profit via the membership fee. The profit on sales is not as important. When the cost of products goes up, Costco just adjusts the sale price. It still provides the best prices as the profit margin is low. This in turns keeps the members. Comparing Costco and other retailers are not really valid. The only things that matters to me is the movement of the stock. Tracking the numbers, shows that Costco stock price has been advancing close to 30% per year (including the dividends and I use calendar year for calculation). This is true for last calendar year and for the last 5 years. My calculations actually put Costco above $450 at year end. This could be over optimistic but going over $400 should be an easy target. Unless Costco changes the business model or does something different, I expect Costco to operate just like the past which means the stock price would growth. I am holding on to my shares. BTW Costco is trading 3.82% off YTD. That means it is a discount. If one is long and plan to hold it till year end, based on past price movement, a 30% gain is not impossible."
"got 300 shares today, beautiful"
Good stock to keep in portfolio. They make more money in membership than selling products.
I love this stock because it’s solid and not that much volatility
Not loading up on the beat down to 270’s was a glorious MISTAKE
"Well now, COST needed to plunge in the opening hour yesterday then has steadily risen since. Consistent and methodical rise. Apparently Mr. Market likes COST. All the whining about COST being a .......'whatever'... Is ridiculous. Its been nothing but a beautiful investment with predictable management and a solid business model. China hasn't even opened up to speak of. Neither has any Asian country for that matter. China alone could double COST footprint. Easily. This has to be one of the most consistent value plays ever. Nit the Only, but in the Gold standard column for sure. A sound retirement investment."
Hair bag power hr looking good today
buy all stocks that dip in this market period/ Especially the ones that miss earnings
Big Boys almost done loading up....................................told youBUY the silly dips.................. COST always OUNCES BACK !
"Kirkland is great quality for affordable prices. I see loads of people buying computer stuff from Costco, Lenovo laptops due to working (gaming) from home. This week great discounts on the Lenovo laptops."
COST is KING of retail and its rapid growing food sales and annuity sales via Costco membership will propel this stock to $300 by end of year. BUYING in dips....
Looks good for tomorrow. Very small AH trades. 265 PT and they just killed earnings. Small rev miss of 30 mil.. Thats like a month of sales in ONE Store. This stock has been very resilient. It will soar tomorrow morning. 240!

"Read this and you would be crazy to hold st this price level...They may have made much less profits than they reported “Costco Slides After Earnings, 'Material Weakness' Warning”"
"Tom, tks for your encouragement while Costco was sleeping. I added more a few days ago!!"
"not enough to justify price... each ""warehouse"" worth over 100 mil... compare to all other retailers on a store value basis. too rich"
"way over valed witha 37 PE, this stock has 125 points more to drop"
"COST gas was $1.29 per gallon today. $15.00 cheaper to fill my car today vs. just several weeks ago. Closest gas stations to our Costco were 1.60. Attendant was thoroughly cleaning pump handles, screens the whole pump. Love my Costco."
Cost earnings will be great. Have you seen their stores and website lately? They are out of stock of many items all through pandemic and very recently. Above all they have lot of international growth ahead of them. And super loyal customer base who pays to shop there.
"Next stop 175.00""s"
"missed on eps due to costs related to pandemicNet income attributable to the company rose to $951 million, or $2.14 per share, in the second quarter ended Feb. 14, from $931 million, or $2.10 per share, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting a profit of $2.45 per share.Total revenue rose to $44.77 billion from $39.07, beating analysts' average estimate of $43.78 billion,"

Cramer just said buy COSTCO
Just Sitting here twiddling my thumbs
Buy the silly dips hereTargets maintained 342.00-348.00
Why is Costco stock going down today?
I belive Costco will report increased sales and earnings. I also think this will be the last time increased sales will be reported as the previous years numbers harbor the pandemic induced panic buying. Though earnings should remain strong. A lot of whiners have complained of the wage increase. At Costco (as most places) very few hourly estimates are at the base wage. If you have worked at Costco over six months you have advanced on the pay scale. Small minded individuals are complaining of the $1.00 per hour raise the vast majority of Costco workers received. since they rescinded the covid combat pay ($2.00 per hour) received for the past year it is actually a pay cut. this will undoubtedly contribute to earnings.
Sold 1000 2023 put 300 leap contracts bought 500 call 300 leaps net credit $20 per contract.
Hurrah!
Cost getting it up the ask and WMT almost untouched. Go figure.

RECESSION coming thanks to TRUMP and POWELL
Good wages ---> Good people ---> Happy employees ---> Good service ---> Happy customers ---> More business ---> Growth ---> More value to shareholders.
sellers will be so sorry when Costco opens up more stores in China and stock goes to 400
"Costco opening 1st warehouse in New Zealand in 2021, along with 20-30 others"
"I have a new theory on why COST dropped so much today (-$9.45 or -2.46%).Monday: demand for the $10 Special Dividend bid the price up +$3.29.Tuesday: opening stock price adjusted down by $10 but price was subsequently bid up +$5.79 due to widespread confusion on purchase date to be dividend eligible (see multiple posts Re: Ex-Div, Date of Record, etc).Wednesday: stock was down -$4.06, normal fluctuation or some selling after 6 consecutive days of increases.Today: most retail stocks (WMT, TGT, BBY) were down just under -1.0% due to estimates of lower than expected holiday sales, but COST was down -2.5%. This extra -1.5%, or #$%$75, could be due to Costco's November sales, which were only slightly below Sep & Oct, but I suspect most was attributable to those who unwittingly bought on Tue or Wed thinking they were eligible for the dividend and began dumping the stock.Does this sound reasonable? If so, it would explain Thursday's drop and provides a strong case for a quick and sharp recovery."
Newt Target 238.00
where's timmy at?!
We'll soon see in a single day Costco surging up 10 - 15% up. That'll be $30+ up. Then all Will be normal again.
close 318.20
"Just think if they would have missed in their earnings! Under 200 for sure. We are headingthere right now! It don't matter, America is bankrupt anyway. Just a matter of time beforewe are hauling our groceries in a wheelbarrow."
COST needs to pay out a much higher dividend.
Need good news on China deal

All time high today
"Which is why you can buy Costco, down here, on the ridiculous sell-off that has always proven to be a bargain worth shopping for every quarter the stock gets hammered on illusory concerns, of which this quarter has more than ever."
"just read that a deal in principle has been done with china. nothing signed, just in principle. this should send the markets higher tomorrow, which means COST most likely goes up with it."
"I've bought A LOT of $212.5 calls from the 28th of Dec to Jan 18th, knowing full well that this stock will rebound next week. Some might say, even today. No need to panic there."
Buffet & Cramer say COST is on a TEAR............................ way undervalued !OWN it DONT Trade it...............................
Cramer says NOW is the time to put money to work................
If I buy on Dec 1st and Sell on Dec 2nd will I get $10/share dividend?
I don't like the fact they are getting into political stuff cause of palmetto cheese owner gave an opinion on his page about the mess going on with country and Costco is going to pull it. i liked the product.
Only strong hands left here.
Fed cuts interest and the market tanks. WOW
"(Bloomberg) -- Dairy Farmers of America Inc, the biggest U.S. dairy cooperative, is in advanced talks to acquire U.S. milk processor Dean Foods Co. But other would-be buyers could emerge.While discussions are taking place between DFA and Dean, no agreement has been reached for the purchase of all or some of the Dallas-based company’s assets, Monica Massey, executive vice president and chief of staff at DFA, said in an emailed response to questions. She didn’t speculate on prospective bidders.A deal could be a lengthy process, including an antitrust review. Any transaction would require an “extensive review of Dean Foods’ assets, thorough due diligence and other conditions, including approval from the Department of Justice and the Bankruptcy Court,” Massey said. Dean intends to file bidding procedures with the court to conduct a sale.“We have been monitoring Dean Foods’ financial performance closely since the business began showing signs of distress and have been preparing for various scenarios, including a bankruptcy filing, in order to minimize the impact to DFA,” Massey said. “Our farmer leaders and management have built our cooperative to withstand a situation like this. Our members and employees will get paid, schools will get milk, and dairy products will remain on the shelves across the country.”Dean Foods is the biggest customer of the Kansas City-based cooperative, which has around 14,500 family farmer members around the country. DFA is focused on “ensuring we have secure markets for our members’ milk,” she said.While Americans may be drinking less conventional milk, 94% of U.S. households also keep it in their refrigerators, Massey said. The dairy category as a whole remains strong, with cheese and butter at all-time consumption highs. Americans ate 2.5% more dairy in August than they did the year before, and the retail market is worth over $100 billion, she said."
Purchased at $321.00 two weeks ago before the downturn...was that wrong timing?

"costco always gets screwd on earnings it never fails...this ER was not bad..with the pandemic, and other concerns it did very well in my opinion"
Just got gas at Costco and the parking lot is packed as usual
3.4 % down already today
"COST at $316 is still way cheap. Just back track and look at what all the analysts had written written when price was at 12/14/2020@ $373, OVERWEIGHT. ""Basically, if an analyst rates a stock as “overweight,” he or she thinks that the stock will perform well in the future, and believes it is worth buying—it could outperform the broader market and other stocks in its sector."" Which it has with it's earning report, 14%"
The reason other stock going up is because they are heavily shorted. Hardly anyone shorting COST.

"Ever since COST started with EBT have you noticed the clientele? And with EBT, you don’t have to pay the annual. Sunni or Sharia? Two sides of the same coin."
"To: Dave re: costco question regarding valuation,COSTCO HAS HAD THREE DOWNGRADES IN THE LAST 4 MONTHS, THE LAST ONE BY WELLS FARGO. INCOME IS OK BUT THE BIG BEAR IN THE ROOM IS AMAZON WHO JUST INCREASED ALL WORKERS INCOME TO $15 per hour AND COSTCO IS NOTORIOUSLY ""CHEAP""AND MAKES SOME REALLY ""STUPID DECISIONS"" SUCH AS REFUSING TO ACCEPT CERTAIN PAYMENT CARDS SUCH AS AMEX. CURRENT REVENUE AND INCOME AND ARE OKBUT NOT A HOME RUN. THE INTRINSIC VAUE OF ANY PUBLIC IS AFFECTED BY COMPETITOR ""IN WAITING"" SUCH AS AMAZON AND WALMART-SAMS CONNECTION WHICH IS PRETTY FORMIDABLE WITH A LOT MORE EXPERIENCE. CAN ONE QUANTIFY CURRENT PRICE TO VALUE, YES CERTAINLY BUT THE ANALYSIS I HAVE SEEN DOES NOT SEEM, AT THIS TIME, TO SUPPORT FUTURE HIGHER VALUES AND MAY GO LOWER. I DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL BUT I AM NOT COMPELLED TO BUY RETAIL FROM A WHOLESALE COMPANY.THIS MAY NOT SHED ANY LIGHT BUT YOU CAN GO TO: FINVIZ.COM (stock screener), where a lot of the number crunching and analysts opinions are included..good luck!E...ret"
COST is the best company in America if not the world.
"We probably will beat earnings, but question is will stock shooting up like nike?"

Financial irregularities = SELL
in Alberta Costco had to go to 15% capacity and now the government up the capacity to 25% of fire code . I assume many other provinces and states in the US had similar capacity restrictions. a lot of what people are saying on this board is questionable and just noise. it only makes sense that once these capacities go to full the pastures will be greener.
"Telsey Advisory Group's Joseph Feldman reiterated an Outperform rating and $330 price target. ""Costco's May sales were significantly better-than-anticipated -- a strong rebound after a soft April that reflects value and high member loyalty in a tough retail environment,"" he writes"

hey guys lets just all buy one share tm morning and get some volume into this baby what do you guys say?

Grossly overpriced. 36 p/e It should be selling for $150 a share.
"Sold for a medium loss. Tomorrow should be worse being a Friday. Win some, lose some."
"Here's the floor/strength resistance. $373. It pops up to $377 and is immediately put back in its place the next day. $373. Explodes to nearly $380 out of the gate today, systematically brought back to $373. The volume has not reignited yet. But, this weekend should be enough time for everyone to digest the news and the holiday season to become front and center with an official Vaccine approval. The rest of this month seems to be a continuation of this unprecedented climb. $400 EOY."
POSITIVE THINKING: RISE RISE RISE RISE RISE RISE RISE

"JNJ one and done vaccine will be a game changer for the USA recovery time , economic recovery time reduced by 50%"
Nice close ...being setup for fresh new highs.
"There’s no news on Costco, so that isn’t depressing the stock today, especially when the broad market is up. It must be some selling by some institutional shareholder(s), possibly even cashing in in large gains from strong performance over the past couple of years. In the absence of news, this is likely a temporary dip that will correct in a short while, assuming the overall markets aren’t changing a lot."

I have loved being a Costco member for so long because of it's superior customer service. This week I experienced rude behavior from an Costco employees when I went to redeemed my reward certificate. I could not digest the experience and decided then and there that it's not worth to shop at this store. Goodbye Costco!"

Costco is only getting g started , ok opening stores all over the world. Right now only 1 store in China, can you imagine 10Years from now they have 100 stores . So invest away in Costco for the Longterm . I originally bought 2500 shares and you can only imagine what I own now with all the dividends being reinvested . Buffet would be proud of me lol"
I wish I bought more at $352. I hope I get another chance. Was waiting for it to drop under $350 and missed my opportunity. :(

Hello $350+...as I expected. Yup
"the #s are good, it doesn't make any sense for the aftermarket crash!!!"
"A stock like GME rallying to the moon while a stock like COST sells off. Common sense has gone out the window. Anyone with a brain is buying this dip in COST. COST and GME are true opposites...COST has a solid business model, a competitive advantage, and extremely bright prospects. Vs. GME which has an obsolete business model, and a dim future. Which would you rather own for the long haul? Bottomline, the bubble in the GMEs of the world will burst and those names will come falling back to earth. Once that happens, COST will rally and take out 400. Jump in here with both feet."
"The more I shop at Costco, the more I love to shop at Costco.  Surprisingly, my kids are now asking to go to Costco. If not heading out to Costco, there's always Amazon. Two great companies to invest in. COST will no doubt hit $500 in 2021."

"Costco is the king of retail, and in that space, its growth has been phenomenal.They haven't even scratched the surface yet on the online world, when that would happen, combined with retail, Costco would do wonders."
"Costco is a great company but its stock has performed rather poorly. I purchased this stock back in March 2020 at $303 thinking that it was going to hit $400+. As of this morning (June 15, 2020), it's $296 and I am not a happy camper."
large moves coming...better cover soon .
Hey board how come there aren't option strike prices for March 8th over $225.00 and the $225.00 puts are up $2.45? That does not look bullish to me. What say you. Really more downside numbers than upside there. thats not even a 10% pop target price on ER beat.
"In order for COST to succeed, they need to increase their web presence majorly! Their website is the first place they should start."
FOR THOSE WHO THINK COSTCO IS SO *&^&%$ WONDERFUL LET ME CITE THAT THE PROFIT MARGINS ARE RAZOR THIN. NOT LIKE APPLE ETC. WE'RE TALKING 3 % AFTER EVERYTHING IS SAID AND DONE. SURE THERE'S YEARLY GROWTH BUT ITS MARGINAL. CUSTOMER BASE IS LOYAL. GRANTED. BUT AGAIN... PROFITS ARE MINISCULE. MARKET CAP IS 144 BILLION. 600 MILLION SHARES OUT THERE. NEED TO START BUYING BACK THE STOCK. THIS IS INSTITUTION OWNED. EASY TO MANIPULATE BY THE HEDGE FUNDS.
back in the good ole days when the market was red like today..Costco would be one of the only green stocks..
when are the earnings?
"If this thing doesn't start heading up, the 'management team' needs to start packing up !"
"Costco is not a short-term or day trading stock, it's destined to make you money but requires some patience."
"Guys - COST reports monthly revenues, one of the best at that. Why would anyone expect some big deviation from what they have already said?"
Fed needs to retire all the qualified FER to give VEO.

"Ex div on Aug 30, 2018."

"In Alaska, looking at the full shopping carts and long lines, you would think everyday was Armageddon."
"No, need to argue just look at the chart. 1990 $11, present time $345."
"Nice rebound by Cost and a big handful of retail stocks, go figure, so many went down and nothing has changed with tariffs but stocks are rebounding."
I don’t know who but buffet is making his whale size acquisition
What a great deal today @ COST.thank youbuy.....................
Reminder this is a COST board not a TRUMP board so hit the road.

PROVE THIS STOCK IS RECESSION-PROOF
COST will be the first to recover here....shorts better cover.
Look like COST will hit new high tomorrow.
"I love people that have probably been on unemployment or “working from home” complaining about these people getting raises. You’re right, screw the workers. It’s all about the stock . It’ll go back up. The entire market is taking a pounding. Everyone handed out raises? You people are selfish and disgusting tbh"
"Get ready for it... Trump is going to drop Pence and place Ivanka on the 2020 ticket as his VP running mate. Hopefully, the Dems will keep the House and take the Senate. With both Houses, a win by Trump in 2020 will still result in impeachment and removal. And the Dems will remove BOTH Donald and Ivanka!Nancy Pelosi then becomes America's first woman President."
"I would like to recommend, Costco to MGMT, Costco whole sales store would open to the public, but with 1 condition, non member will pay additional 10%, above marked price witn, debit card or cash only, will bring in store net revenue and profit, to additional 10% to 15% or upto 20% per store.Only until pandemic time is over, also it will increase membership easy 10% to 15%, renewal.I would see with in a years, just as what amazon did it for trial period in the begining stage."
P/E is still way too high. Costco looks fine back at $150-170. Be patient.
"Is there any body cancelling Costco membership? I,m notHow often do you shop at Costco?At least 1 or 2 times a week.How much do you save on gasoline at Costco ? I save about $7 to $10dollars per fill up.Costco make most money from the membership renewal, do not worry Costco won,t go away, sit back and watch, if you have not sold your shares.Long term invested."
Called it last week.... big snap back for this week and here it is today.... up $8. More to come in coming days. Like I said.... it's Costco.
#CNBC
Wall Street expects Costco’s adjusted EPS to grow 7.1% YoY to $1.82 in the quarter.
"WOW!! I'm slack jawed, congrats to longs!!"
"beat on eps, missed on revenue. so is it a stalemate?"
Costco sales up 4.4% for May. Slowdown from last quarter. Will slow further
if you sell this stock your betting against warren buffet. Good luck
Buffett is still piled on
Upgraded !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Should do a 3 for 1 split. Follow Apple and Tesla

"With trepidation, since i recently chastised hairbag for a bad call, i beleive the August earnings (still over a week away) will come in similar to July and I feel they will come in at a 12 - 14% increase over August a year ago."

Costco being talked about on CNBC right now. All good things! GLTA!
I'd rather they'd miss on eps than on the revenues number! Any word on 2Q guidance?
Earnings announcement will be made after hour today. Hang on long. The pandemic has triple the sales of the company within the last 6 months. We will be rewarded. It’s going to break all the records. Yeah!!!!
Been holding COST for over 17 years .........It always gives me great returns.
In today at 309. Let's see where this ends up in 5+ years.

FYI. I was in a Costco yesterday in England and was ordering something they’d run out of. The place was RAMMED with people and I asked how many the girl reckoned were in there. She showed me the entry headcount book which shows the ADDITIONAL number every 15 mins. At open 257 straight in and every 15 between 75 and 125 extra. Now read this. I’m staying looonnnggg. https://dispatcheseurope.com/attention-costco-shoppers-aggressive-american-big-box-retailer-big-plans-europe/
TRUMP will NEVER win Trade war with CHINA
gonna give back that $5.75 we made yesterday..thats how this stock works
I LOVE MY COSTCO SHARES!!! Especially at $373!!
Will beat ER
I bought back in yesterday...should have waited a day..I kinda feel like the run is over now
bought 25 shares @ 211.40.
Great numbers! So what if they spent $285 million on sanitation and enhanced wages during the pandemic quarter? Just goes to demonstrate that Costco responded to the crisis in an appropriate manner. People see this and builds confidence in how company is being run. Long Costco
2019 RECESSION is near.......................................
"lets see at 155 area i will hold for a year collect $2.00 in dividend and sell cost at 178 a share,,,who cares about the sellers today,,,this is my long term play"
"Great time to buy for a special $10/share dividend.If you have 100 shares, on Monday you make $1000."
BUY BUY BUY
I really don't see AMZN taking out costco. No reason for the selloff.
"""The big money is not in the buying or selling, but in the waiting."""
We get NEW Highs soon......................................
"I have been a Costco shareholder since the early 1990s with a single digit cost basis. This stock alone has made me wealthy. There have been many stock market fluctuations in 30 years and I rode them out. I am an investor not a trader. Asking every day why a stock goes up or down or being concerned about a week long downtrend will drive you crazy. If you want exposure to retail stocks, then Costco is a good choice in my opinion. Traders should look at momentum stocks not this type of retail stock. Having been an investor for 60 years I made my money over time, not in a week. Sometimes you get lucky and make money fast, but that doesn't happen very often. I luckily invested in the Magellan Fund in 1965 and reinvested annual payouts. So think long term and don't get fixated on short term fluctuations in a specific stock or the market as a whole. If you believe in the U.S. economy, then in the long run you will be rewarded."
It has gone down ever since the special dividend came
BUYER of theDIPS. Cramer
Brits are lame and sad. Can't control anything..
why is this ever down? this is a solid stock..buy it keep it

GREEN!!!!
Its just Tax Loss selling.............................COST has been up over 50% from year end !
Past due for a split.
"Costco Wholesale (COST) stock (COST) is ticking up Friday, helped by an upgrade from Gordon Haskett, which sees several catalysts for the discount retailer, including pending earnings that could surprise on the upside.The back story. Costco stock is up more than 41% year-to-date, while the S&P 500 has climbed around 20%. The company is expanding overseas and seeing strong sales trends, and many expect it to soon pay a special dividend.That's allowed the shares to largely sidestep the pressures facing peers, including an ongoing trade war and increasing competition from e-commerce.What's new. On Friday, Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom boosted his rating on Costco to Accumulate from Hold, raising his price target to $330 from $255."
I would think there is a good chance that this can finally go back above 230+ after earnings next Thursday.Any thoughts?
So now we know why Warren sold Costco... conflict of interest with Amazon.. he is rooting for Amazon and now they announced a pharmacy store.. Warren employed and where he has big share holding will all be directed to Amazon health ...via the newly formed health Insurance for them
Targets Increased !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'll sell at $312-$314 next time it hits that range but I feel $325 is possible. Not much risk of this falling back more than 7% so reward is greater than risk. I'm still holding my $281 average 2 week position.
"market will be up 2maro ........ stocks like wmt ,cost ,apple qualcom , all will peak"

"Visiting the store twice a week, not 'cause I love shopping there, but continuing to check on inventory. Their buyers need to scour all over the world for items like thermometers, N95 masks, flu medications, etc. For example, if they could get a hold of N95 masks, I bet they could sell a million per week. Toilet paper and cleaning paper are not the only hot items. Distribution of the paper items is uneven. A friend in Minnesota can get toilet paper, but we can't obtain it in Hawaii. Think of this as a war, Mr. Costco. Fill in the gaps."
best place to shop at costco!

Thanks AMAZON for the cheap COST shares today !we LOVE you !
what is going on? I really don't get it....
We either bottomed today or tomorrow will be a key reversal day. This is an 80/20 setup
"Their business model is top tier. Chuck Munger, Warren Buffet's partner recent article saidCostco has something that Amazon and other retail revivals don't have. Costco deliveriesenormous retail Value. That is exactly why I have been a member for years. Also, I worked there overthe Holidays(this last year) as a seasonal employee. I worked as a stocker and the volume of turnover ofproducts was staggering.I feel the stock price is acting a little weird but thats how the market works. The market wants you toget frustrated and sell off, so the more experienced investors grab your cheap shares. In the long haul,Costco stock will climb like our Federal Deficit. Fast. Majority of what they sell is food related products.We can get by without toilet paper but food is a different story. Stay patient, you wont regret it."
it is just beginning.....
Heading into close like
POWELL going to SINK markets and take us into another RECESSION.
CRAMER : BBBBUUUUUUUUYYYYYYYY
Loving the lift. Go Costco!
"I guess a great earnings report means nothing....the employees haftar wonder "" why work so hard"""
special dividend coming on 24..
Wall street is mad because Costco is paying their employees 2 dollars more during covid? At the same time making record profits. You can make this stuff up!
All aboard ?????train is leaving soonbetter cover shorties out there !
"Buy puts guys its going below 200 by end of next week, mark my words"
This stock should be at 400. What is going on?
"Sure please do buy on the 30th or now, In theory, a company's stock price will automatically fall by the special dividend amount on the ex-dividend date because the company's distribution of this cash represents a decrease in the value of the company. You also will sell at a $10 per share loss unless you get smart and hold onto this fast growing stock."
I still think they are going to crush earnings
"Costco Wholesale Corp. said Wednesday its June sales rose 11% to $16.2 billion, from $14.6 billion in June 2019. Same-store sales rose 12%, including an 11% increase in U.S. same-store sales. E-commerce sales increased 86%, the company said. Costco sales in May rose 7.5% and online sales jumped 106% that month."
This is not participating in the market euphoria today.
"consumer sentiment is all time high. unemployment all time low. people have money to spend. when consumer sentiment turns negative then the market wil truely crash. $nflx , $goog, $aapl, $amzn"
"Saw a post here claiming, ""$260 coming"" and thought it was getting a little over excited. WOW, not so out of line now, but very possible before long"
"It is time for a split, so the little guys can get in!"
Time to start buying 
No doubt to see $400 next week.
Market is over bought. Taking a breather.
Let’s go
fortunate to own 1000 shares....should be a green day no questions asked
if you trend earnings and reaction to earnings per quarter for COST Q3 is by far the best performing quarter since the beginning of time.

Costco earnings standpoint never let you down.320 tomorrow!

"I don't trade Costco at all. Actually, given the environment, I've sold off everything except for CREE. It looks like you guys are about to break out. Been keeping my eye on Costco for a while and figured you were just in an accumulating phase. It looked like I was right when you started getting higher highs. I am probably buying in tomorrow. I expect a green volume jump very soon- just hope it's not tomorrow before I buy (if I buy)."
look for the SILLY DIPS as BUY opportunity !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AMZN not doing well lately too.
Awaiting cost sales number
400 after earnings
I'm waiting for a split in stocks. mite not happen be great if it did
Costco is overdue for a split. A 4:1 split announcement on the 10th is a strong possibility.
nice! back to September 2019 levels. stock market is great.
wait for356.00-357.00
250 by Apr. 1
COST online salessoaring ! no need to travel to the store to buy groceries !
Been to HD and Low.....came away thinking blah.
Only reason to buy this is the dividend.
Amazon Wholefoods deal is not a sure thing apparently. Does that mean that if the deal does not go through everything goes back to where it was two week ago. Costco back to 180 and so on. This drop does not make sense. I think it would have made more sense for Amazon to buy costco. It is more similar to Amazon and has the groceries to boot. They can use their huge warehouses as part of their network. These people know more than I do so I imagine there is a reason they chose Wholefoods.
will jump to 375
All registers open and ringing at Costco.
Costco is such an amazing company.! Makes money in any environment!!
Targets raised again.
Just sold all COST at 183
The dividend payable in August should have been declared in July. There has been no declaration yet. What happened to the BOD are they taking an extended vacation.
"I DON'T WANT A SPECIAL DIVIDEND!!! Neither do many of the institutional holders or individual holders. All it does is create more taxes! If you hold COST in a retirement account, you can't get at it to spend. COST has China to conquer and then many other areas. You will be much better off if they continue to prosper, with the regular dividend increased nicely each year and the stock price continuing to head skyward."
You cant keep a good company down.
Blowout numbers and 5 upgrades and the stock does this...I sure hope our quarterly numbers aren't good! No telling how much it would drop if they are! Sheesh!
"Relax people, Costco had a big run up the last six months, and now corrected to a more suitable multiple"
"Costco price target raised to $200 from $185 at Stifel Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan raised his price target on Costco to $200 from $185, noting that the company's Q1 ""core-on-core"" gross margin was likely better-than-feared given concerns about the promotional environment and that its comp growth rate of 10.5% was the strongest since FY11. He maintains a Buy rating on the shares, but said he does not anticipate material movement in the shares versus the market today based on this report. In pre-market trading, Costco shares are up about 2% to $190.95.Source: TheFly"

Special dividend in August
"nice to see a little bounce, but this has been disappointing the last month. when I bought just prior to the ER, prior to Nationwide shut downs, I bet on this stock soaring to greater highs than just being traded day to day. it still cant retain the day's gain. not as hopeful... sales will not be better than it was in March."
This stock tends to bounce between a 25 PE and 30 PE on forward earnings. Right now we are at the high end of this range. Might sell off to $195 or so which would be a 25 PE on 2019 estimated earnings.
"I saw Shamus at the Costco he is referring to two posts below. He had his thumb in hisACE the entire time while he was staring at the women’s Calvin Klein sports bras. When he walked away, he started sniffing it."

It looks like I bought on a dip at the right time.
I see Costco stock did not split since 2000. Is it time?
"We,LL I,m a very bullish but tomorrow is Friday, I don't think whole lot of investees are like to leave money in the market over the couple of days off.I think may be by Monday it shoot up may,be 305 to 310 ish."

Im just hoping earnings this goes up and not down.....

Need to get rid of #$%$ Walgreens and include Costco on the DOW instead. The people in charge seriously need to update that privileged list of 30.
COST target increased .Its a BUY here today .Amazon is actually helping keep the competition OUT of Costco !
"Amzn yearly revenue is 280 billion, and Cost yearly revenue is 140 billion, Amzn has still not profit because they don't pay any tax, Cost had good revenues, and they pay lot in tax, Amzn' s PE ratio is 101 vs Cost 37 as of yesterday closing, Amzn market cap is over trillion, Cost is only a less than 150 billion, why? There are alots of hype in Amzn. Go Costco.Buy Costco, can,t go wrong.If you like my post give me a thumbs up, also I like to see some comments.Thanks."
New highs!
What is going on to cause this? We’re at $333/share right now.
They are going to crush earnings since everyone is stocking up for 3 months

no reason at all this is even down...manipulation

It will sharply up after BJ’s ER at 6:45am

just look at this junk..markets up huge...and costco in a downward spiral....the problem here is..the pandemic is pretty much over..the hoarding shopping is done..compared to Walmart this stock is way over priced..twice the price of WM..why invest here...costco stock is in trouble..
Wish I had bought days ago. But sold some for 387 last Nov can hardly believe I got it back Wed at 329.20 .
"Costco is like a cult. their customers are loyal and knows where to find value and service. Membership renewal is about 90%. (Compare that to Sams where they are giving membership free, Pay $45 and get $45 back). Employee turnover is very low. Employees are happy. Earnings is good. LOOONG."
costco is severely undervalued

"Costco reported great numbers, that's why it's up"
Went to COST today and only one check out was open and no one was waiting.
the market is up huge..why is Cost down so mucho
Trump and Powell will SINK the global markets into RECESSION
Yet another all time high reached today. Tough to find an argument against Costco
"COST P/E is 36. For comparison, TGT is 26, and WMT is 21. COST profit margin from sales is around 2-3%, so most $$ is made from memberships. As someone else noted, ""who out there doesn't have a Costco card?"" This makes it hard to grow revenue fast. I don't think they'll drop, but I see no reason to go much higher for a while.Would love to hear some _reasonable_ arguments to the contrary."
"I am above the water, large volume and big hammer formed on the bottom."
My costco store was empty today. First time ever.
NOV 30 2020...COSTCO WAS 391 ....TODAY IT CLOSED 323 3 MONTHS LATER. WOW !!! 68 POINT DROP IN 12 WEEKS. EXPLAIN THAT ONE TO ME. I KNOW....ITS A GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY. ITS A DOG.
Heart is sinking deep. Got in at $367  anyone too?
"Here is the proof, Costco traffic exceptionally much higher than WMT, TGT and Whole Foods.All 4 stores are about in 1 mile of each other in Tustin/Irvine California. This Sunday, I around 1 O'clock PM, I checked all 4 stores.1- The most crowded one was Costco with 20 cashiers serving average of over 10 customers at any minute.2- Most Whole Food customers were buying/eating lunch and some customers buying selected groceries.3- WMT and TGT were not empty either but customers were not buying big items.4- Costco was the cleanest and the most specious place to go around and enjoy shopping.5- The worst one was WMT with unorganized isles.6- Price wise, Costco was the cheapest.7- I also got GAS from Costco and paid about $0.50 less per gallon. We purse about 100 gallon of gas from Costco and save about $50 per month or $600 per year. This is nice to pay for our membership. We earn another $800 on our VISA card plus all the saving from our purchases at Costco. We are getting quality merchandises at lowest prices.8- I like some organic items at Costco. I think Costco has started to increase its organic products.9- Costco private brand, Kirkland is expending.I want to see more foods and restaurants at Costco even if the prices are higher."
"I just got back from my local Costco. It's only a Tuesday, middle of the workday when I was there. Parking lot full, aisles full of shoppers, long lines at the registers with everyone of them open. Drove past the Whole Foods just blocks away. Parking lot 1/3 full. Just saying...."
"Sell... get into the stocks that will actually rebound, not the 35 PE retailer with 3% growth"

Almost everyone here got it wrong. Own it
Boom!
"Analysts were largely pleased with the results. Oppenheimer's Rupesh Parikh reiterated an Outperform rating and $ 335 price target on Costco shares. ""Given the recent earnings per share miss out of the way, we now see a brighter shorter and longer-term outlook for Costco shares,"" he writes. The analyst slots Costco next to Dollar General(DG) as his top food retailing pick"

I understand shareholders are to receive the special dividend of $10. per share payable on the 11th of December. Could someone please explain why the shares opened up $10. lower Tuesday morning than Monday’s closing? Thank you.
unfortunately most of you longs will get burnt in the short term. Why? because 70% of their sales right now is food and food has the lowest margin of ebit of almost all sectors. I know...i own 2 food companies. The stock will drop to $170...maybe lower and will likely rocket to $500 within 5 years. But don't expect this to happen within 90 days. Do not hope trade. Caveat emptor.
"Here is my 2 cents to Costco longs. Costco cannot be simply compared to target. Being a technical guy, I compared their website values. When Costco site value is 418 M, target is 724 M. This mean target online sales is almost double of Costco . Costco ER will be mainly based on in-store sales and subscription. IMHO"
I sold. I love this company but shares will suffer as news gets worse. I start back in near 250.
Costco will be over 500 by the end of the year. E-commerce is exploding
I love the way they sandbagged with the sales report. Earnings are going to blow sky high with such a low expectation.
"Oil stocks are dropping like lead balloons. They are paying 10 to 15 % dividends. If you purchased Boeing 3 days ago, you would be up 60% today. The market has been dropping and there are bargains everywhere. Costco is holding its value very well in this down market. Most companies are not doing good in current environment. Noticing the long lines at all Costco stores recently, the next earnings report will be spectacular. I do not expect the Costco would double in price after this COVID-19 or the oil Sales are over. However, I am pretty sure that Costco would come out this COVID-19 in a good shape. People with cash are looking for bargains at the moment. Since Costco did not drop like the other stocks, it does not look like a bargain. Personally, I like Costco and I picked up 100 shares at closing 03/25/20. I am in for the long haul. When a stock goes down 50%, it would take a 100% upward move to break even. In this kind of market, I rather play it safe but most are looking for higher profits. This is probably the reason the Costco is not moving up in price as the demand is not much."
"I'm really surprised people are not buying the hell outta this..100=$1000,1,000=$10,000"
Heres a $25 off code Costco online purchase of $250 or more. Expires 2/29 AV4CWUL.
I'm screwed. And it just proves I suck when it comes to buying individual stocks. :-(
I had to buy a couple hundred shares. How could resist this discount??!!
"Welcome to the greatest show on earth, or greatest joke. THE STOCK MARKETHedge funds and banks are in the playground today, once they've made enough doe it will go up again."
Good luck to all of us
Hopefully futures will change by opening ..... they usually do.
"Everyone of you on this board, listen to me-------BOYCOTT AMAZON. The people in this country that own stocks in decent companies, need to band together and BOYCOTT AMAZON."

"ollowing the sales data, five-star analyst Rupesh Parikh at Oppenheimer ramped up the stock’s price target to $380 (12% upside potential) from $355 and maintained a Buy rating, saying that COST remains a top pick."
UP PM. I hope u shorts get burned. Still have NVDA.
people are buying a lot of products at Costco. just in case
COST to start higher cash back .sorry SHORTIES but you gonna continue to get Burned here.
macd crossover on The Daily today don't sell yet
Stock will be stuck in this range for a very long time. They are still managing covid-19 instead of their business. our store still does not have food samples and half the food they used to carry in the food court.
silence
COST goes to 250 on earnings on Dec. 13
Any shareholders concerned about recent price pull back need only to look at 52 week high and low to put fears at rest. COST remains near all time highs
COST rules the retail world.
Nice shoutout from Dr. Cramer on CNBC just now
Last chance to jump on the $$wagon.
conference call at 5 EST. Wait for it!
cost have cash 14 B. total debt is 10 B. how could it's current ratio be 0.98 according to yahoo finance? they have enough cash to cover all debt
"COST Technical:DMA 50 is sitting at $159.08 as today and has been acting as a weak resistance now. The reason it is a weak resistance is A) the DMA line is flat and it is not trending down B) COST has tried it a few days ago but it could not pass it. Usually, it is hard to pass it for the first time. Today, the price stayed close to it and since this is not the first time, it should break it today or Monday.After breaking DMA 50 around $59, there will not be any resistance until DMA 200 which is sitting at $161.79. Good luck, it is going up."
"Who Is Overvalued?Analylists claim Costco's PE is too high. Let's compare the facts:Amazon PE = 188.66; Costco PE = 26.56 (ten times is bargain territory)Amazon EPS = $5.31; Costco EPS = $5.76Amazon Dividend = 0; Costco Dividend = $2.00 (1.82%) plus surprises!Costco sells gas, prescriptions, liquor, glasses, cars, insurance, lunches, etc. It's hard to even compare the two as they are diferent companies. If anyone wanted to compare Whole Foods, Walmart, Kroger's etc. are more comparable. When a person goes to Costco it always offers some surprises that you can, touch, study or eat. When you go to Amazon it has great variety, but is purely an online experience, not a personal experience. I fail to see everyone deciding to buy groceries you cannot see in person.There is a place for Costco but it does not appear to be in an Amazon's world."
let's fill the gap at 180
If you have weakness discovered in your it systems you put policies in place to stop it.There is no reason I can think of why the ceo needed to come out publicly about it.It makes me think there is something that he knows that forced him to publicly disclose this so that later down the road when it it reported he is not charged with some sec crime.. do you disagree ?
It went down 2% last earnings (Dec) and there was no coronavirus so why everyone is so surprised baffles me. It’s called a mkt
"Worked for them 31 years. Totally awesome company. Only had 15 building's when I started, now over 750 and I think that 1000 is not unrealistic."
Sales through the ROOF !shorties are toast !
"Massive growth potential, just bought"
I am an amazon prime member but will never buy groceries online my family loves going to Costco. I never have come out of Costco with just one item. Usually spend over $100 each time. This is a golden opportunity to buy Costco and hold for dividend payouts and guarantee returns of investment as this is way oversold and reacted.
Look at Nike Stock good example when people were selling it I bought bought more and it went higher made new highs so when people sell buy add more to your position it will pay off....
250 by the end of the year! Keep it up Costco. Ready for an early retirement.
Love the sale !thanks for 289.55
I just don't see how you can justify a P/E of over 37 for a brick and mortar retail stock
Costco rumored to end selling items in their food court to non members. Great idea! Make them sign up for membership so Costco stock will be higher.
Good fundamentals. I think it will reach $390 before the earnings date...
"Yeeesh... poor me.. I have to keep raising my stop losses, since I bought at $155 several months ago ...."
"Does anyone notice when Costco goes up by 10 a.m. pacific time it goes down until closing.? Why does this happen? Been watching this for weeks and same thing. At least when they take the daily profit, they leave some for the rest of us."
"i went in and out costco stock this year , I am not an expert it was just logical to me , it is a top company I made good money"
So why the huge drop after hours?
"I think we book $350 today! If we do, I'm going down to the Costco to get gas, shop, and get a chicken bake. Who am I fooling? I'm doing that anyway...."
Profit margins of 2.7% is pretty discouraging
"Keep shaking the tree, then run!!!"
Whisper is Special Annual Dividend for buying all their TP stock
this always stalls about right here
"wow, why the big drop the last 2 weeks??"
couple more months for that special div baby
"While most retailers, Whole Foods included, are shutting down retail locations, Costco continues building profitable warehouses and signing up millions of dedicated customers with a 92% retention rate. Think about that for a moment."
quick gotta leave china they're gonna steal costco's intellectual property!
membership FEES to increase !!!!. in early 2017great news for investors !Buy while its cheap.
"Seems many are upset over the resent decline... This is not a stock to day trade or keep short term. Costco recently issued a special dividend at $10 a share which drove the price up because of those who wanted to cash in and subsequently the company would drop the sp $10 on the first day all the qualifying shares were locked in. After that, you have the people who were trying to cash in, begin to sell resulting in a drop in sp. Not only that but many companies have year end drops, that's just the way it is... But just remember this... Employees have 401K options to buy/invest in the company every paycheck. Don't have exact numbers but it'll be safe to say that the majority of employees over 3yrs employment are investing in the company. So consider all the those thousands of employees buying Costco shares every payday on a constant bases... You feel me??? Costco is solid and will continue succeed!"
Special divided coming soon .

"I LOVE that Costco on their website has stated that items that cannot be returned are Costco is not accepting returns on specific items, including: Toilet paper Bottled water Sanitizing wipes Paper towels Rice Disinfecting sprayVery very nice!!!"
Sales accelerated in August. Great news. Highest of the year.
"You would think with all the coin Costco rakes, it would improve customer service instead of making it worse. Case in point. Had a problem with a product I purchased. Six months back, Costco went to a new vendor for this product and the quality from this vendor was poor/inconsistent quality to the previous supplier. I went out to email a complaint to Costco after encountering an awful package from their new vendor only to find there was no longer a means to contact Costco via email on a consumer related issue. They're promoting an on-line chat instead. Sooooo... I fired it the chat window and after waiting over 10 minutes for a rep to respond on the other side - that never happened - I droped off an did a snail-mail letter to the company. You know what the company did? Forwarded my letter to the vendor. By doing so, Costco was telling me they chose that vendor for the bottom line and not product quality, and if I had issues with the product, I was to deal with the vendor direct and that Costco would continue to stock inferior items from cheap vendors."
"Watching pre market trading going on at $265.51, who would have thought this beauty would be headed to $270 after hoping for $240 not long ago!Got to love it!"
COST is one of my favorite dividend growth stocks. I talk about dividend growth stocks on my youtube channel. The channel is really focused on new and beginner investors looking to invest in dividend growth stocks and ETFs. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrg6IDPf4a7pUKTN90n6syg
"Earnings are just too risky nowadays, buy the rumor sell the news."
Betting on Costco at this point is pretty much a guarantee. The news is only hyping it up even more.
climbing 288 .......hop it will touch 295 today
"What should I buy COSTCO, FB or APPLE at this price?"
VXX 50 DAYS MA ABOUT GO BELOW 200 DAYS MA STOCKS ARE GOING HIGHER LOOKS LIKE TUESDAY. COST GOES OVER 253 ITS OVER ITS GOING HIGHER

Does Costco get any of it’s merchandise from China. If so what %. Anybody know?
"People who short a company that literally does nothing wrong and is fundamentally unflawed are the same people who drink from the gas pump....just like you'll die doing the latter, the former will kill your finances. Those who shorted in the lower 300s have had to eat a big loss, which will only increase as time goes on. 400 is coming back, then 500."
How about a special dividend? It’s been ages since we had one.
Cant understand why company didn't issue a special div yet.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-costco-cost-stock-makes-153819148.html
Sold my 3000 shares on a limit sell at $309/sh but believe after this short dip that COST will soar past $315!
This is a BUY BUY BUY. IT WAS SO PACKED TODAY! EVERYONE DOING CHRISTMAS SHOPPING!
King Amazon pulling everything down. I am OUT. Not worth the chance ER according to Cramer means nothing when selling is the trend.
People already have all the goods they need last 2 weeks and that is why COST and WMT stocks don’t take parts last 3 days with 16% up of the market
Pictures will go viral again this week
"for all you people that want to be on the band wagon that costco is dead and amazon will destroy them,,Well never will happen,, now if an analyst has a lowered target to 180 from 190 only tells me its a buy and hold,,,take the dividend and a year from now we will see 175"
New target increased to 241.00
is it me or is it a common thread of black attitude towards police especially when they break the law
I had 25 shares at 346 but sold very early :(
CRAMER highly recommendsCOST here now.
my long just got longer
CRAMER and BUFFET say COST is considered CHEAP here.
"these numbers should give Longs woodCostco Wholesale Corporation (“Costco” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: COST) today reported net sales of $19.14 billion for the retail month of December, the five weeks ended January 3, 2021, an increase of 12.3 percent from $17.04 billion last year.For the 18 weeks ended January 3, 2021, the Company reported net sales of $65.47 billion, an increase of 14.9 percent from $56.99 billion during the similar period last year."
"It is just momentary down, Good chances to buy the dip"
Shop-Rite takes in more customers then cosblow.
Rockets go 3 2 1 
Analyst called for 7% increase and Costco increased 8.3%Should be killer news and this should be going up up!
Usually cycles down in October. For no good reason.
Back where I started with this stock 8 months ago...Ugh! Paying people more didn't help my position...
Today was a bad day for the market. Tomorrow everything will recover and COST will jump 3 to 5%
"Due to the China brawl, the tings in stores and Costco as well are going up in prices.In restaurants, plate sizes have become smaller and prices have gone up substantially."
No worries! $375 in no time! $$$$
"Get this. I have owned Costco since the 1980's when is was Price Club. Never bet against it. I did once and sold some shares, and I have regretted it ever since. Period"
"The Illuminati will not take the pressure off of the global Covid19 hoax. They will push it as far as they can, for as long as they can. As a result, floor traffic will continue to suffer, as the elite have decreed that only “essential items” are to be purchased. No furniture, big screen 4K TVs, tables, no fire pits, no outdoor furniture, no decorator carpets or wall art.. only toilet paper, food and water. Costco depends on impulse buying of high end stuff. With restricted purchasing rules put forth by Bill Gates and the elite, and also a certain number of folks allowed in store, dudes.. profits are going to fall off a cliff."
strong hold waiting for conference call
"Great company, good stock considering the circumstances. This is an investment, not a trade. Hold it."
Wells Fargo said to buy COST today.

"I will be loading up 500 shares right before closing on Monday! Folks, if you looking for $10 Divvy. You have to buy before Market close Monday and can sell on Dec 1."
"HD/ ULTA/ ...all dropped huge today, COST may eventually follow suit..."
If AMZN is over $3000 then COST should be at least $1000.
"I had bought some originally at 151 and then again last week after the amazon news hit again around the same price. They are a healthy company and are changing some of the inventory also, furniture, etc.. They are also trying to improve e-commerce. I think it is a safe bet at this price, chart supports that alsoG"
Huge news for CostCo to beat the numbers of cars they sold compares to any other quarter. Analysts have a buy rating at $191 with the targe price of $209.
zero money to be made here

"Hey guys, in your experience , when a stock pays out a special dividend like this, you need to own it at close dec 2 to qualify, do you typically see a big sell off the next day of people who held just for the dividend? I have 50 shares in 368. My fear is there could be a mass sell off where I’ll be down on this stock after dividend"
I just entered back into COST after making some nice gains earlier. Due to the high price I started nibbling and slowly adding to the position. Avg cost basis is ~$245 by 7/1/2019. I wanted some protection against a correction because the stock became increasingly oversold. I wrote some Jan 2020 $270 calls with a $14 premium. I got the protection I wanted by the by reducing my cost basis to ~$239 but stock ran away from me right after I sold the calls I am still under my break even point by a few bucks but the stock apprars to be very strong due to recent same store monthly comps and the rumor of a one time dividend like they did a few years ago. I am a COST member and see the strength of the chain every time I go in to shop. I was looking for some guidance from anyone who is a covered call player.
during the peak of the pandemic..this was a normal earnings day
"Their sales will go over the roof. In my area people are buying paper tows, water, all kind of canned food like a crazy. Next Q will be blowout earnings..."

"With a forward PE of 36, stock is too expensive especially with recession looming"
"OMG! Costco is on fire!!! Like a idiot, I sold 1/2 my shares of Costco in June 2016 to buy a new company vehicle instead of selling my equal shares of UNDER ARMOUR stock. I thought UA was the better long term hold instead of Costco...Now look at the stocks. COSTCO is a big winner and it's a matter of time before Under Armour fades into the wind like old sneaker company Reebok..... I think Im ready to pull my shares of Starbucks and air drop them into Costco for 2018....Those special dividends that Costco hands out like candy is sweet.."
October sales after the bell. Get ready for a new high!
staff in costco are best
People go shopping at COSTCO for Christmas.
"$COST anemic volume worries some bulls, myself included. Earnings are great, but....?"
"June numbers are out. Expecting a positive opening tomorrow. (GlobeNewswire) > > Costco Wholesale Corporation (""Costco"" or the ""Company"") (Nasdaq:COST) today reported net sales of $12.17 billion for the month of June, the five weeks ended July 2, 2017, an increase of seven percent from $11.33 billion during the similar period last year.For the forty-four weeks ended July 2, 2017, the Company reported net sales of $104.28 billion, an increase of six percent from $98.51 billion during the similar period last year."
"Traders have only 2 1/2 trading days to get the dividend. Tomorrow the market is open, Thursday closed for the holiday, Friday 1/2 day of trading and Monday the 30 which is the last day."
"So a 4 to 1 split would give you 4 times your shares at a lower value thus allowing smaller investors to get in, thus increasing your value -and over and over. Take a look at microsoft in the past for an example."
"One step forward today, two steps backwards tomorrow?"
markets are green now and this dumpster fire keeps on dropping nice
"THINK POSITIVE... HANG IN THERE... ITS ONLY DOWN 80 POINTS IN 11 WEEKS. DON'T BE A MUSH... AS SOMEONE SAID EARLIER... BLAME ON CORONA... DON'T BLAME IT ON HIGHER WAGE EXPENSES. IF CEO DOESN'T INCREASE HOURLY WAGES THEY WOULD HAVE BEATEN EARNINGS ESTIMATES. BUT NOT TO WORRY, HOLD THIS STOCK FOR 5 YEARS, IT'LL HIT 340 AGAIN. ostco beat expectations on revenues. They missed expectations on earnings due to unusual increased pandemic costs, but still had better earnings than the year prior. This is a positive earnings report!"
So glad I got in at the low after the Amazon scare. believe in COST
$350 let’s go
79 % of all Americans have a Costco card....Easy buy
Don't bet against COST. Blowout numbers coming.
and I dold my john deere stock for this
Sell your fear so I can buy options in the panic. I’ve learned it’s easier to make money from the fear of retail investors than buy into good news when the move is already made.
Coming back up. Hahaha. Definitely Green
"Costco is cheap at these levels, nice momentum today. A new high is on the horizon"
"p/e of 37, single digit growth.The cost bubble will end badly. target price: $250"
That’s why COST and TGT down so much today! Another cliff down for COST tmr!
Shorts gonna get BURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRNEd soon.
"Does anyone think Costco""s stock deserved to be down 9.98? The margins were down, but earnings beat by quite a bit. Amazon hardly has profit so what is wrong with Costco actually making good money and paying a dividend which Amazon will probably never be able to pay since they hardly make money. BOYCOTT THE CANCER THAT IS AMAZON."
Closes above $335 today. Over $350 next week
down
This is crapola giving employees raises and hitting the share holder last time I buy this it will take years to come to where I bought.. I am blasting this company every day on social media... Bohyah KMA
Simple math when some company pay more to employees that mesns they earn more hold tight till ER
Special dividend ?
Only down 1.5% at this time. Perhaps the cc will deliver for us!

It should be a good day for COST as well compared with TGT.
All shoppers are going to COST to shop because they have created the only safe environment to shop.
"No hurry to buy, market so badwill fall sharply"
Positive ending for Costco is a good sign that next week should see this move much much higher.

Costco is up now due to people try to stock many stuffs due to coronavirus and they will turn after this mess. This year people will spend less money after because layoffs are happening now across the country. The site filing for unemployment benefits crashed yesterday

numbers are good or not?
Heading to $380...
"Today, I went out for an errand and stop by Costco for some smoke salmon. I ended up buying whole bunch of stuff. Head and Shoulder Shampoo is $3.50 off, Mochi ice cream is $3.00 off, King crab corn chowder is off $3.00, Garlic Shrimp is off $3.00 and Cold Pressed Green Juice is $2.00 off. Do I need all these discounted items? No. I already have plenty of Shampoo at home and the rest were just food that I could consumed but my fridge and freezer are quite full. I just could not resist stuff that are on sale at Costco. I seldom order from Costco online other than some meats. I used to buy Grass Fed Steaks from the online store. I like to walk around Costco and check if there are something that I could use as I know Costco would offer a very competitive price. I have tried so many different foods because there were on sale. While the selections in Costco is not much but the prices are always good. Last month, I ordered some items online from Costco. What triggered me to search the online store is I remembered the report that Costco’s online sales went up. I started to explore the online store. I checked items that I were going to purchase from Home Depot and Amazon. I purchased an air cleaner, a faucet and a garbage disposal. These items (the ones that I wanted) were usually not at the Costco stores. While Amazon has the most selections but Costco has the best price. Home Depot sometimes do have great prices when on sale. I do think Costco has a good potential to grow the online sales. I for one is now checking Costco online store before ordering from Amazon or popping into a Home Depot."
Buying Costco now as this price is crazy cheap. Sales are going to kill expectations for the 4th quarter and this stock will jump big.
I feeling sure 
My math shows 240 is easy to get to and hold. January 250. Even if China trade goes south this retailer has a cult like following.
cost decemebr sales is sooo great

"building my positions here, good luck to all"
"Alright,Now time to go green!"
300 today
Just thinking about pre market has my nerves wracking. Made some nice calls this morning too. GLTA
"Online shopping was up a Whopping 30% from Thanksgiving thru Cyber Monday. 30%!!! This makes me think, 'how was COST's online sales? Will we see the full effect of the shopping season create an eyepopping number come Jan 4?' I foresee a beautiful run up this month followed by a spike, then some breathing in the stock in Jan. Thoroughly enjoying my long term options position. Also have a short term that Im looking to exit on the next small run. IMO, the next 3 weeks will be a nice solid rise."
COST is benefiting the biggest from stimulus checks!
"BEFORE YOU SELL COST LOOK AT DIVIDEND AND FUTURE NOT SHORT TERM TRADERS-------And over the long term, Costco stock has been a winner. During the last 10 years, Costco's stock price is up more than 500%, clobbering the 160% return of the S&P 500 Index. The further you go back, the more impressive its outperformance becomes"
"Fund Managers are loaded with cash , COST is a buy here ."
well actually 2 bil dollar miss on revs. no wonder the selloff
goal is above $400
Most other stocks are undervalued and cost is overvalued. Institutions rebalance and buy other stocks while selling cost.
BJ miss means most of the sales went to Costco
This is just the start of COIL Spring effect !
Where is the flippin special dividend?
its almost if somebody has an endless buy in at 273 and everytime it hits 273 it just absorbs the shares and never moves. talk about manipulation
Watch this retreat back to $160 once earnings come out. Even if the earnings are good the amount this has moved up since last e/report suggests the gains have already been valued in
costco started to fight back...
Dont Sell dont sellCOST is way undervalued here.Mark my words!
Costco is down and this is one of the few stores still open. Imagine if their stores were shut like Apple and most others.
"HA HA HA HA...""COSTCO IS NOT GOING DOWN FOREVER..."" HA HA HA ... BOY THE STOCK IS GOING TO SOAR NOW. EMPLOYEES NEED ANOTHER RAISE. STOCK SHELVES FOR $52,000 A YEAR PLUS BONUSES... SIGN ME UP. I THINK IT'LL BE A REALLY GREAT BUY AT 270."
330.00 next stop
Shorts are in panic mode :)
Jim Cramer just said great quarter on all counts and its a BUY BUY BUY
Can anyone tell me what’s the purpose of earning report? Beating earning report does not always mean higher price. Why ?
The Bk death rage of this gigantic beast has just started.
Well Tuesday was quite a show of strength. wiping out the losses of Monday you can see where the sellers started in the morning and then large buy volumes stepping in. A few more sellers around noon and then the selling was over. Monday was an aberration. A blip.this thing will be over 160 by the end of this week.LD

Down again in an up market thanks to biden harris.
Stock surging and like I previously said.... $350 will present itself a lot sooner than you know.
"The store packs every day, a lot better than WMT and Sam's club. It is a long term baby."

Going green soon and then 330
Manufacturing index tanks Tariffs play a huge partTrump needs to go!

Targets are being raised...again.
Special dividend coming soon
"The quarter ends in October, so the number in November, web site down did not include in today. So, the number should be very good, according to the last monthly sales."
"Costco said its sales for the 39 weeks ending in May are up 7.7% from last year to $120.19 billion.This is what we know of Costco's typical performance, OH YEAH!"
A blog post on Option Trading mentioning DIS MU and the reasons behind a new long (call) position in Costco: https://seekingalpha.comhttps://seekingalpha.com/instablog/15663412-joe_retail/5218203-option-trading-great-way-avoid-marrying-stock/instablog/15663412-joe_retail/5218203-option-trading-great-way-avoid-marrying-stock
Middle class loves them hot dogs
"I sort of wish the Costco I go to would raise membership fees just to thin out the parking lot a bit. It's like Christmas just about anytime you go. Like the store, like the stock."
Costco needs to announce stock split in order to hold the share price keeps falling. Its stock price is so high that traders think they sell Costco stock to use the funds to invest somewhere else such as Apple or other to get higher and quicker returns.

"My opinion is that someone is fighting very desperately to hold this stock at or below the $ 190.00 level . If it gets past that , it's on it's way up ."
Buying this stock HEAVY tomorrow
Bought HSKA at 4.00 sold it at 115.00 Bought DZSI at 5.00 now its a 13.96 on its way to $75.00 Bought COST

BBBY closed stores with a decrease in sales yoy.... their price went up the next day.

what about the div. did they raise it
"They will report sales in 5/28/20There are many small business is closing down, due to cv19, Wall Street expecting too much out of Costco whole sales co.I personally think it's another chach up opputunity, for any body who missed out get on the board, COST will rise soon enough,they will not close door on us.It's war time, as soon as it's over you'll be too late, buy and for get it. Sit back and watch."

Shorts better cover soon.
Good pull back today for institution to jump back in this still has upward momentum tomorrow will see it back up to 160 level don't miss out on this dip
"Since Buffet sold out, this stock has dropped 25 points.What is happening here with Covid peaking?"
"Low margins, low customer counts and a lousy online presence is not the way a warehouse club prospers."
RED even day like today... Do something COSTCO !!
Wanna buy on a dip but it keeps going up :(
revenue missed of wall street not from last year ..yoy 6 percent revenue high ..its a good reporrt ...
If it keeps dropping I would buy. Entry point 293
"Still sticking with my previous comments here regarding a upswing in the waiting but, maybe, COST needs to split it's stock ? That isn't going to created any more value of any sort but, it might ignite some buying interest. Buying back it's shares, I don't think is the answer because on a P/E, it's still a bit lofty. My opinion anyway."
COST just HUMMMING along............................. in the GREEN
Show me another company that had to close their doors due to too many customers. Doors to the China store closed at 1pm in the afternoon on opening day due to too much demand. (No seriously tell me so I can buy that stock too)
"Costco stock has dropped a little,while their parking lots are still full and the $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ keep flowing in. How could any sane shareholder be afraid of bezos and whole foods?? There's no competition there...."
"Shopping at Whole Foods was a ripoff before and now it is less of a ripoff--but still a ripoff! Sure, shop at Whole Foods if you like the atmosphere, scenery, or just the product line. But just know you are paying extra on products for all of that."
hard to imagine just a couple months ago this was booming at unbelievable amounts anywhere from $5-$20...the hottest stock on the planet...now look at it..will never have another $20 run..and now the worst stock on the planet
"all the gains from yesterday, getting shot down today"
300.00soon
"There shouldn't be anyone here trading this stock - you put this one in an IRA or a 401(k) and forget about it while continuing to buy on a normal schedule. Stop looking at the daily movements. Investments are not day-to-day, they're year-to-year. Balance your portfolio at the end of the calendar year and make your changes (if required). Otherwise, just sit back and let it make $$$ for you."
when cost announce to increase membership? just $10 will boosts stock back to normal level.
"Bought during the dip 10 months ago at $157... obviously, wish I had purchased even more. Love Costco - even bought my car and solar roof through them. Good example of buy what you believe in. I am looking forward to one of their periodic special dividends!"
Amazon is said to be starting the process of adding pharmacies to their list of products. How will (if any) this effect COST ?
stock market not a good place right now
Costco announced $16 minimum wage yesterday....Does it equal drop in stock price or will not effect?
Bail now!!! This is going to crash below $300 tonight! You have been warned
Likely finish today in green and upward moving forward.
How many other people cannot sell before January 4 without putting themselves into a higher tax bracket? But wait too long and the new administration may put you in a higher bracket anyway.
"Costco's stores are the busiest ones in Toronto ! Always packed , gas station very long lineups every day ."
It should be close to the bottom price now. A huge buying opportunity!!!
Membership up.
"So, Interesting Warren Buffett now saying that it was a mistake exiting out Costco shares. 1) why did he sell out of his position first of all and then admit error? Is Warren all there?"
"elinek also pointed out that Costco employees receive two bonuses each year up to $4,000 combined. The average hourly wage, which includes those bonuses, at Costco is around $24, he said. TIME TO UNLOAD THIS TURKEY. NO SENSE AS TO COST CONTROLS."
I’m looking at $270 to add . . . .
costco down after hours...I guess the 16% wasn't enough
"Define miss, after accounting for .22 tax issue, they reported profits of 2.69 at the very top of analysts' expectations, in regards to revenues, pretty much in-line. Same stor sales supposedly missed, but wow, 5.1% increase, that must have been one heck of an expected number. Just saying, I know the media and analysts want a recession, but the numbers tell quite the opposite of a story. It may be down, but it sure the heck ain't out."
what a manipulated stock.... wow
Dunkin crowded again in this cold snowy weather.No one at starshits cause of the smell.
"I see this going higher. A little fat for a growth-play, but they said the same about $AMZN at $600 so hey it can happen"
COST without Tariffs will be $320 a share. Remember at least a 5% margin hit due to Tariffs
I sat on the fence for 3 weeks about joining (http://Fairstox.com) for their weekly picks. Big mistake. COST exploded and I completely missed out. Don’t make the same mistake I made. Join them today
Do we really need the special div?
"It's green, look quick! won't last very long, LOL"
Bit of a over reaction on the sell side. Sales up 10%??
long term baby.
way undervalued herebuy.
Those 74% large institutional holders are really sitting on their hands recently causing a little bit of a lock down even while the S&P is going up. Just a few hrs. from earnings... and the truth be told and they will react! Still believe we go back over $250 for good!
CCramer said BUUUUUUUUUUUUYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY COST ahead of earnings....................way overdone here................................too much negativity built into the price.
"I don't get it! When you go into Costco the atmosphere is as good as it gets. Everyone I know loves Costco! Costco has creates an atmosphere that its the place to go. As an investor and a Costco member I only see good things in the long run. Amazon, Walmart, Shi... they cannot keep up with Costco. The noise in the markets are self serving the people making the noise. Long term Costco is a screaming buy at the current stock price. Costco can increase pricing if they want to and will not decrease membership. Costco is still in a position to expand brick and mortar, online, and delivery of goods and services which will out compete the competition."
"Costco lines out the door in San Luis Obispo. Its like a new Star Wars movie, opening night"
I say bravo to Costco. Everyone wear a mask ! You dont like it you don't shop here. Period..This is not about personal freedom or civil rights. It's not about politics. It's about public Health.

"Anybody buying Costco stock up here? I see line ups in my local one, literally to the block. I also like their fundamentals. $152.7 billion in 2019 sales and 13% dividend growth annualized over the last 5 years. 0.84% dividend yield is kinda low, but the growth makes up for it.Taking the 72 rule, this dividend would double in the next 5 years if it stays at this rate of growth. Also, Costco's dividend payout ratio is just 30%, leaving lots of room for growth.It is featured as one of the best dividend stocks according to this article https://dividendscholar.com/best-dividend-stocks-to-buy-now in line with other companies like Starbucks, Sherwin-Williams Co., Nike, S&P Global Inc., Honeywell and Visa."
"It's really a shame to see people like 'Funue' who just cannot seem to learn the difference between something as simple as resistance and support, two very fundamentally basic technical indicators. Being 'slow' and 'unaware' is no way to go through life. I really feel sorry for him - trying to impress others with knowledge he does not possess. Again, he reminds me of Donald Trump.I hope everyone has a Happy and SAFE New Year in 2019!!"
Waiting for368-370.00
Where is the cheese?
"A co-worker of mine recently got hired by Costco. He got hired on Friday and was told he had to start on Monday or they would give the job to someone else. He was forced to tell his employer, who hired him 6-years ago, overlooking things in his past that would have disqualified him from most jobs, that he couldn't give 2 weeks notice. I wonder how Costco would appreciate one of their employees doing that to them? The company I work for has 6 locations throughout 2 states and we buy all our office and maintenance supplies at Costco. Actually, correction, we did buy. We'll take our business to Sam's Club now instead."
RECESSION PROOF stock.just buy and hold here.
CEO should be fired $10 dividend and wage increase is not needed. Beating earnings is much more important.
"COST is not going to go down forever. It is one of the best run companies in the world and the business model is rockstar material. The stock price will eventually reflect this again. Wall Street doesn't always reward the great companies right away, but sooner or later overdue recognition always comes. Therefore, you should be taking advantage of these prices. Several years from now your wallet will thank you."
Welllll Costco was up in after hours 1.5%. Now even. Guess a lot of folks didn’t like the results. Think this is the norm in the future for a lot of stocks
Selling volume has disappeared after the July sales report.
So Happy I passed on Costco years ago and bought WalMart
I would think that the closing of Sears and Kmart stores should be a positive for Costco. Any thoughts?
"Someone mentioned $320 is a value to but into this stock. I imagine it will grow after that which is good. But it sucks that people like him seem to create their own opportunity, and see it drop $12 to that. My timing has always lacked."
Costco looks like a good doomsday stock to own
I was getting tired of losing all my cash to the markets so I found these guys that produce one solid stock pick a week. So far their plays have been awesome. Just go to the-stockdork .
TtRUMP IS MAKING A FORTUNE ON THE MARKET
"Owning stocks like COST and WMT and TGT and DG are all about learning to roll with the punches. Buy all the dips...these companies will be around much, much longer than the traditional department stores like Macy's and Dillard's. They have major staying power, customer and brand loyalty, etc. And many of them have low prices. I use these stores in tandem with e commerce. They have made all made me wealthy over the last several years and I'm fully confident they will continue to put money in my pocket in the coming years. They don't always move quickly but I'm a patient man and patience is key when it comes to waiting for the money to roll in."
Moving very slow. Something is holding it back. Come on....
I haven’t been to Costco recently but went to Sam’s a few days ago. Gotta say it was so refreshing to see a good selection of chicken breasts at a reasonable price and steaks. The steak price was of course higher than usual but there was availability which I haven’t seen at the other grocery stores that aren’t membership ones. Plenty of foot traffic in the store.
so easy to make money on Costco
386.00 coming...........................
News is they are gonna start paying people $16 an hour what most people don’t know is people who work at Cost mostly for years and most of them make more than that anyway￼
I am a day trader and can't figure out the stock going down the last 2 days. Maybe went up too fast..my leaps are hurting but love the stock and will bare the loses. Any feedback?
Sales up up upover 9.0%
Any info on China store sales?
Will be back to $345 by end of day. Just need market rally here today
"this stock should be soring, Lines around the block literally for 2 weeks straight and are getting longer."
When the Chevy salesman ask me where’s my $$$ I’ll tell him I’ll be back tommorow after my Costco moneytrain rolls in
"This says everything about COST. Management continues to maintain a ""steadfast commitment to value and integrity"" in everything it does, from selling goods at the lowest possible price to how it treats customers and, most importantly, how the company treats its employees."
"Analyst Actions: Oppenheimer Adjusts Costco Wholesale PT to $400 From $370 on Strong March Results, Maintains Outperform RatingAnalyst Actions: Goldman Sachs Adjusts Costco Wholesale's Price Target to $415 from $377, Keeps Buy RatingAnalyst Actions: Stifel Adjusts Price Target on Costco Wholesale to $385 From $370, Maintains Buy RatingAnalyst Actions: Wells Fargo Adjusts Price Target on Costco Wholesale to $400 From $370, Maintains Overweight RatingAnalyst Actions: R5 Capital Upgrades Costco Wholesale to Buy From Hold; Price Target is $400And.. these numbers will go up more after next earnings IMO."
COST is breaking records today!!!
"As the end of Costco's fiscal 2017 is near, it is important to bear in mind, Sales should top $125 billion, and earnings are tracking to be at record levels. Membership continues to grow, renewal rates and loyalty remain strong. Costco is increasing the number of warehouses, and expanding the number of countries it operates in. Costco is increasing it's efforts in growing it's online, mobile and delivery activities. Does the future look bright? Absolutely!"
Why cant this stock hold 200?
"Every Costco store I go to has a ton of people in it. During a pandemic. During the time when a lot of businesses that buy wholesale at Costco are closed. The members in the stores have regular shopping carts - they are retail customers who will remain customers after the pandemic. As the country starts to open up and businesses start to open up, I expect to see a lot more business owners, stocking up wholesale, with piles and piles of product on those huge flat carts. I think COST is oversold and their prospects are looking up. Going to buy a few shares today and tomorrow."
Costco's going to pop on the next earnings report
"If they can stop paying this much to their employees, this stock is gonna be worth so much more.. Store clerks make more than some engineers."
lol solid
COST shorties have had the juice squeezed out of them like lemons. This behemoth is a short's worst nightmare.
this stock is definitey going to 250~260 range. sit tight
I’m also going to Costco today to spend some BIG money and push this bad boy over $320
"I went to COSTCO yesterday in California to stock up some food, guess what, I got the last bag of rice and bottled water. People is certainly in the slight panic mode. I did go to Walmart to buy more bottled water. In CA you need to prepare for the earthquake anyway, might as well stock up. Long COST, will add position when the pull back stabilized."
"Bought in today @279. Maybe not the bottom but close enough for me. I agree with KI Real, this too shall pass and Costco ain't going anywhere. Quality company with money in the bank.They say buy stock where you shop and some in my family are there 2-3 times a week even after the virus became a thing. No need to panic folks. They are strong and getting stronger. Can't imagine what their numbers will be going into 3rd and 4th qtr. with shelves being cleaned out so nicely. Hang in there......"
Look at 5 year chart and tell me what this company does? It goes UP
COST should be hitting all time highs like AMZN
does anyone else feel like cost has peaked?
"it looks like as soon as someone says China, retail investors start thinking in terms of 1.4 - 1.5 billion customers. that's not how it works. ask uber. ask million other companies that do business in china."
"Just sold my Puts for a quick $500 profit. Hope it pops on bogus FED news and will buy back in..................GOING DOWN FOLKS...over bought, over valued and economy slowing....not good!!!!!!"
If this was gonna pop post earnings it would be happening rite now
Costco stock price target raised to $320 at BMO Capital
PE getting rich...
"Why COSTCO even goes down for a day is beyond my comprehension. People still lined up to buy goods, well managed and when things get back to normal, they will have more members."
Costco has been stuck in a symmetrical triangle for a while. It's about to test resistance around $313 if it doesn't tomorrow. If it breaks through and holds that for support it could go up to a secondary resistance line which is around $320. if it breaks through that the primary resistance line is $350
A billion new members coming in China. Stock passes Amazon at $2000 per share.
I have to be honest. If I had to choose between higher pay for their workers or the five dollar rotisserie chicken I would choose the chicken.
New target 358.00
sales were good but maybe the market expected better today
hoping the board of directors will see the horrific performance this ceo has given then these past few months and will replace him
"$500,000/day in Costco 's Honolulu Store. 8-12 fuel tankers per day at their gas pumps. 8,000 hotdogs/day at Honolulu store. Boom!"
COST is up 4.92% to 302.86
I won’t shop at costco until they change there mentality ... Masks to gain entry .... Sorry .... Wrong strategy IMHO..
Just need to break even at 295 so I can buy AVGO on the low end.
No matter what happens people need food !
I have been at costco 1 time before the pandemic and I came away thinking those folks were in a frenzy and it was so busy I could hardly get through.
comp sales in U.S. was good but weakness in international
Just went to Costco today to prep for Hurricane Harvey. Took me 30 minutes to find parking. Lines were out the door and around the corner.
Hairbag do you know 99% Chinese do not speak or write English but China has most number of Billionaires! Language is just a form of a communication. I speak and write 4 different languages!
Most go to Costco for food which is VERY expensive on Amazon. I would just love to see Amazon ship me the quantity of stuff I buy for the same price I pay at COST. Not going to happen!!!! What do you think?
"If you look at the chart of Costco this is the largest percent correction in five years in excess of 15%. Each time the stock has bounced back and made new highs, it looks like late 2016 to me. This is the fourth time in two years that we have had a substancial correction not exactly uncommon. Costco like Amazon has a cult following that will not exactly abandon them overnight. They both have a base revenue stream from the membership revenue. Markets overreact all the time and I believe this is one of them The stock is a good buy at this price. This is a very high-quality company. I have been a member at Costco for a long time and the thought of the abandoning them to go shop at whole foods because Amazon bought them has not even crossed my mind. In fact whole foods got so ridiculously expensive that it will take a lot for me to even go back in that store. In addition these acquisitions will take a lot of time to close and for them to put their stamp on whatever they're going to do with Whole FoodsJust my thoughts"
COST was @ 362.00 six months ago..................NOTHING has changed ................................. other then the stock price !
"I think COST is a good buy today at this price, tomorrow monthly number comes out over 9 % again."
340 tmr! More institutions will join in dumping it tmr!
"what suddenly the PE is no longer high,,,is that what they are claiming today,,,LOL...."
I think Costco is a great buy when you shop at Costco you see what you are buying I think this is also a great take over stock
Today is the day we hit 310. Bye-bye balls.￼
"250,000 shares at $386 is nearly $100 million. Somebody just got serious. Big players aren't in the habit of being ill informed. ......1 purchase -- $100 million.... BOOM!"
i think monday sep sale report will be out and it is going to positive .. easy 300+
No special dividend? :/
be been long and strong on COST since 2005 and seen lots of ups and downs. Their cash flow future has never been brighter I can say with 100% assurance...just check out their stores. Great to remain long.
I bought some callsIt was at a discount today. If they beat earnings then it will be an easy score
2 mins for er
costco must be getting tired running uphill for the last 2 days
Probably drops under 200 even with good earnings which are irrelevant in this market.
This was at $340 just a few days ago...it just keeps dropping #$%$
numbers seem good
I like everything about COST except the stock price. Go up!
Vaccines coming to COST !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"MARGIN PROFIT IS BARELY 3 1/2 % NOT MUCH LEE WAY. TIME TO GUARD EXPENSES, NOT THIS COMPANY. THEY AVERAGE OVER $50,000 PER EMPLOYEE. PLUS BONUSES."
Costco fiscal Q1 EPS $1.45 vs. expectations $1.33
"The quarterly dividend is payable November 15, 2019, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 1, 2019."
COST BE BACK TO $347 TOMORROW
"I own 200 shares of this and I am glad to see it continue to climb, but man it is due for a correction."
Bad earnings? Are you ppl on crack? These were great earnings and the following qtr will be much better considering seasonality. Thinks pls
"just buy it! I don't believe in ratings OPP because it is all BS to press the stock price to go down, then buy all the weak hands and hand to some big funds as usual."
Seeing the lines at cosco the last 3 weeks it is amazing this is not $350 a share
Closed above $300...... again
Fantastic numbers. Let’s see what those membership numbers are at 2. $400+ happening sooner rather than later.
Costco has never been as busy as last 4 weeks
Picked up $336.90. Score!!!
Does the stock drop $10 per share when the dividend is paid? Thanks.
SLOW dying Death of the short sellers as we grind higher from here.
People still got to eat
"Costco has built such a loyal customer base - one of the best. People shorting this stock either have not been to a Costco or have no idea why people enjoy this place so much. It separates itself from other retailers due to its loyal customer base, which is why it's a complete growth stock with a continued successful future. I would like to see the stock split though, making it more appealing for the lower end investor."
Will COST go up from here?
"So, a frag becomes a gangster when everybody want to show off. Motley fool, a paid media, is trying to spin the facts about COST now that everybody is acting. Online may steal some lazy people but family shopping will be strong at Costco where the real saving is.My visa card already accumulated $600 of bonus and my Costco membership is a small fee compare to my savings."
This is my best stock by far. All of my other stocks are dead.
COST rules the WORLD.
"Tuesday, Jul 7th, stock up near 316.00-----stock split?"
Mark this comments. It will go up after 10:30. Volume look too low for shortie to short this stock. It will turn green by closing.
"Just a quick survey. Please comment what you think today's High-of-Day will be. Just out of curiosity, as we all know this is headed to $240+ next year."
"The democrats won the congress, stocks will be punished."
buy this quality stock for raining date. long.
"Thanks for adding more @ 288.0""s300.00 ++++ soon"
As long as people push the Covid Lie. Costco may HIT 355.by NOV.
bad economy and costco still goes up big..hope it continues...sign of a good stock
I love this guy who keeps saying nobody going to Costco... etc.. etc... you ever drive by a gd Costco. Always packed
"Nice to be correct once in a while, I posted that after last weeks earning ""we could be good for $30+"", YESSS!"
"If I buy Costco on December 2, will I be entitled to the dividend?"
Costco in PA today @. 2PM every register open and traffic volume like I’ve never seen. Shopping carts overflowing
IMO its a beat on eps and in-line on revs. comp sales were awesome but I'm also reading domestic growth very good but some weakness in international sales. again jmo as the reports coming out are very very mixed and confusing. seeing it pop up a bit now as we close in on the cc. Best not to get suckered by the short sellers I guess.
I went to COST yesterday and there were no lines except for members returning Father’s Day gifts.
"Forward earnings for next year could be 2.50 per quarter in a positive outlook which give a valuation of 200$ per share, so no paying a penny more for the stock"
"Average Costco memberships per store is 68,000 For just the new China store they already have 200,000 members."
Looks like the future of Costco is building bigger parking lots. Members can't get enough of this jewel.
What did Cramer said? Just now? Take profits?
"buy WHEN THERE IS panic !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!cost ALWAYS BOUNCES BACK AS USUAL !NOTHING HAS CHANGED HERE , SALES CONTINUE TO EXCEED EXPECTATIONS."
When is the special dividend date ? thanks .
welcome back....
"They never paid much of a div, and if it was higher then the stock would not have dropped so hard i'm guessing."
Analysts really in many cases don't understand the first thing about operating the businesses they cover. Thanks for the dip.
Ask Cramer if he owns any stocks himself!
the stimulus will only boost the market for 1 day....what do we have for Wednesday to boost it?
"THIS is the company that's revolutionizing the way people shop - not Amazon - not Walmart. ""Why?"" you might ask. Well, they're in business of TRULY saving the consumer money. And as a complete non sequitur, there are clear and distinct reasons as to why we see Kirkland products on display right next to the products they emulate. Kirkland's products are second to none. Still wasting money on Procter and Gamble? Okay."
"I went to costco last week and every parking spot was taken, every one. This company isn't going anywhere."
bought more to keep one year
be greedy when people are fearful
Love it when the stock price is down just before earning !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SHORTS could get burned here.
I just read they are making all customers wear a mask starting 05/04.....I guess you are safe today through then.
Sales increased 12.8%
why is the stock down today? I thought ex date was 5/10
20 years since the last stock split. 6 to 1 would be nice.
"Glad I sold, their 60 -40, Covid-19 vs business"
Going up...
Today to 297
Ill be holding Kirkland toilet paper for the next 12 years :)
"If you didn’t take profit before today, you’re fooled by institutional sellers!"
"Well, I give it a buy rating. Based upon Int'l growth in China, due to the fact there was lines around the building on opening day in Singapore. Also based on the fact I have trouble finding a good spot in the parking lot, whether it's a week day or weekend."
Costco never goes up the day after earnings. #$%$ stock
"Wrong bet again, buy it is not the end of the world"

Looks like noone want to sell in cheap. it's a good sign
"Is there such a thing as edible clocks, ask Sears, Macy’s, JC Penny and others, there clocks are being eaten. I cannot predict stock prices but I can say there is a certain attitude about shopping as Costco, maybe it is me but the members and the staff are nice respectful people. Where can you go to fill your tank and your stomach at the same time at a discount, go read my article about Costco from 2008 on the Forensic trader blog, I know, a shameless plug, Lol, on a serious note perhaps retail is dead as we know it but not wholesale with a retail flavor."
wheres that special dividend?
Not much time left for shorts to start covering.
Earnings next week
"If you don't buy a few 1000 shares of bj, there is no hope for you as a new investor. Their operating margins make tgt and cost look subpar. ADMA on 60 minutes sunday. covid 19 plasma experts and will soar as millions discover what they can do. spec play riot off bitcoin."
Costco stock going down is a good thing. We can now get a great company at cheaper prices.
Buy and hold
"I shop at Costco not everyday, but I,be been spending, most of all the shopping needs from costco, and I get 700-800 dollars in rebate, the only place I put gas in locally is Costco,because I know they have best prices with top tier gasoline.go long on costco, Costco may buy out the bj grocery chain,IMO.give me a thumbs up of you agree."

Due for dividend news this week or did I miss it? Quarterly 75 cents would get us to 1 percent annual.
"I love this company. But p/e way too high. Is there really a realistic path to tripling profit , making p/e somewhere around 10?"
"Still holding above my most recent buy at $157.00 which was a massive average up from the first time I bought COST which was decades ago when I paid $6.92 and that was before they ever paid a dividend, before Warren Buffett bought into the company.

Special dividend mentioned on conference call?
Big numbers ladies and gentlemen It’s a beat with solid guidance
Costco now requires customers to wear masks. This is un-American. Sounds like communism.

When is Costco next stock split?
just went to whole foods and prices r still out of control. Costco has nothing to worry bout.
is there hope? or is this just going to keep spiraling down
"Go Costco go , the shorts should be nervous.."
COST rarely performs well after earnings.

Analysts say it will beat on earnings.
I bought today.. if it's still down on Monday I will buy more.
the greatest companies in the world treat their people better than their revenues
For those waiting for a COST split: I have posted here and other places that splits are mostly history given the current commission structure (zero in many cases) and the additional admin cost for the company. Here's the potential answer: https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/17/the-latest-in-the-brokerage-wars-charles-schwab-will-allow-people-to-buy-fractions-of-stocks.html
Looks like all retailers are taking a hit today for no reason. That's the crazy stock market for you.
Further drop after hours. What a great opportunity to load up. I would buy at $350 and now I am seeing $312 in after hours. Definitely loading up tomorrow for long term. Huge Costco fan.
It’s a buy under 320
"Costco, it’s time for your special dividend. You’ve been making $$$ hand over fist during this pandemic; it’s been 3 ys since your last special dividend; ppl are either going to reinvest the dividend in your stock or spend it at your warehouse. Either way, win-win for you. I’ll accept $10/sh. TIA."
With earnings way up there could be a special dividend. Last time was I think $5
Market is guessing the Biden effect. Hope not. If your for Biden.... SELL now. Take any profits and RUN...... fast

"In my small Canadian town, we have a Costco and a Walmart. Costco is always super busy and Walmart is not. We have executive membership at Costco and we buy vertically everything from there. This is why I invested in Costco many years ago."

"Poll: how many investors here were shareholders before they were members? I was pretty far from a Costco, so being a member didn't make sense until some years after I bought my first shares. I have talked to several people like this."

"Hmm, can I get this at 290 tomorrow?"
A good stock I would say over the long haul
"Over the past decade, Costco has doubled their revenue, tripled free cash flow, net income and the dividend. Net margin % increased by 50%. ROA, ROE and ROIC all increased in a big way. All while keeping a pristine balance sheet, with employees treated great with highest pay in retail. And most important to shareholders, share price has increased by about 300% over the same period. A success story any way you want to look at it! Costco always trades at a premium to the market and deservedly so! However, the forward P/E of 27 is difficult to justify based on their expected growth and in this stock market environment in my opinion. Not saying you can't make money from these levels over the long term, just saying the strong buy is somewhere closer to a P/E of 20 (or in the $150's). However unpopular that opinion may be."
"Go all in to this stock. Next year, you will be a millionaire.Any prices around 290 are the buy. Don't wait too long.The longer we must deal with the corona virus issue, the better Costco stock price will be."

Costco stores are full no matter what time of the day you go!!Looks like it be a record breaking quarter
Oversold
"COST roars. $400 by year end.We expect Costco’s peers to benefit from expanding fulfillment options. However, Costco could continue to outperform its peers with its comps growth rate in the coming quarters. The company’s high membership renewal rates indicate strength in its business. Costco’s value pricing and expanded assortments will likely continue to drive its traffic."

"the facemask required policy in stores is hurting costco. been watching social media on the subject for a while now. since they started the policy, more and more people have been canceling their memberships everyday. people refusing to shop there until they end the mask policy. if folks are posting on social media about it, you know there are many more doing the same that aren't posting. its gotta effect the bottom line eventually. not sure what to think of it, but i don't think its good business."
Safe Haven? LOL
Seems like it will short squeeze on an earnings beat.
you guys wondering why the stock is dropping?..its the market makers having their way with costco..they're driving the price down to buy more before the bell
"No one is shorting $GME anymore and no one is buying $GME - so thin vol which means bagholders will be creamed in this summer.During this summer:- mortgage forbearance expires- eviction moratorium expires- federal unemployment benefit cancelled- higher oil price aka inflation- cryto getting trashed by whales/founders- corporations reducing/holding dividend payouts due to uncertainty- higher gold price aka money flow into gold only- Fed to hint a higher interest rate by Q3 or Q4 of this year, not 2023- unemployment rate starts going up again post covid-relief- $TSLA to report lower car sales than ever before- $SPAC stocks getting regulated / punished- higher taxes for everyone (sales, employment, capital gain...)- any COVID stock like $ZM, $COST get downgrades multiple times- Cathie's $ARKK getting downgradedI mean with all these risks, hedge funds / high net worth individuals are pulling their cash out of equity market since last week so don't be the last bag holder before the storm hit."
"a high percentage of people are afraid to go into stores, the media has put fear into everyone, this may be like this for a long time...I'm really hoping online orders propel the revenue..."
I have been in this company for 22 years and if anyone sells or tells you to sell they are wrong. I'm retiring a rich man because of costco so stay long investors.

did earnings release?
"Been buying Costco shares every month since 2005. This has always been a great long term investment. No, it’s not going up like crypto but it’s the kind of stock I can rely on for a retirement fund. 20 more warehouses being built this year, so I see another big climb 2-4 years from now."
CNBC says COST has the most UPSIDE here as its undervalued compared to others.

"'Funue' - Sorry for embarrassing you but you have only yourself to blame. If you're going to pretend that you can determine resistance and support and you post it on a public chat board, you need to be prepared to explain how you arrived at your claims. Actually, I knew right from the beginning that you were just pretending but I wanted to give you an opportunity to save face and redeem yourself. You decided to dance around instead of explaining it. We all know that you had no choice because you really aren't knowledgeable about T/A. You and I are opposites but we are still alike in one respect -- you try to impress others that you're an experienced equities trader and me, well, I like to expose people like you."
"Soo nice to see Cost has disconnected from following the herd mentality, not doing the large swings with the rest of the market as in Dec.. Costco should hold it's own because of it's individuality and strength.Today it would have done $5 swings rather than $1. I LIKE IT!"
COST is gapping up this week!
Good buy right now. It always goes up to $300

COST is now like a COILED SPRING
"Costco just needs to keep building bigger parking lots! Love this place and apparently so does everyone else. Sure I spend more money than I should, but I leave feeling good about it. They have a business model built for success!"
Breaking out soonshorties better cover.
Hello all. I am.looking for some information here. I am looking too purchase shares of costco. I beleive they are a sid company and it is not hard too see they are too of their class in the industry. With this non stop upward chart would this be consodered an over valued zone.Any extra information would be great as. I am looking for solid quarterly growth as what I am putting in is considered long term savings. Thanks - first time investor into costco - Justin.
well I did it...sadly I sold everything time to move on..I bought at $275 a while back..so above water...but costco my favorite...but the company needs a new CEO and they fail to see that
"costco can have great numbers, just like last qtr wall st expect so much more pandemic or not..this stock is just about where it was last qtr its had nice gains, but also gives back those gains"
Will jump high today 8 % growth that’s huge
"Costco accused of animal cruelty for rotisserie chickens - read this article today. I am a vegan and animal activist. Regardless my love for Costco, I am selling my shares and will not renew my membership. Not necessary suffering:("
"Next Thursday, COST's monthly sales number will come out, I guess that it will hit the bull eyes as usual. The stock itself is so expensive, buy I bet it will hit 300 by September."
No comments yet about closing the photo department? No more passport photos? (Got mine there in 2018 so I'm good another 7 years if travel ever becomes advisable before then.) Guess I'll have to go online for any hardcopy prints I might want of digital photos I take. Costco had very quick turnaround when I plugged my memory stick into their kiosk and made my selections. I guess this opens more floor space for other products and reduces need for printing equipment and specialized employees. Just keep those $1.50 hotdogs coming.
Ten percent correction should be enough. Market is broke. At least expected a run back to 50dma

way to go Bob
Last year went to 143 at this same time and went 185. Nothing wrong with that
"The entire market has loudly stated they feel the stock is WAY over value. They aren't relating it to Amazon, the comps speak for that. Sales are flying and Costco has entire states that they have yet to venture to. Not to mention the possibilities overseas. If Costco stops with special dividends every couple of years, and splits the stock like the past, the market will embrace the darling w renewed vigor."
Retail is just out of favor in this money rotation
They borrowed money to pay the $7 dividend. It is all smoke and mirrors. They have to pay interest on the borrowed money. That make no sense.
Did not panic and dump my shares! Will hold through earnings and hopefully the QE and pandemic buying will keep share price up!
What’s the numbers?
I'm not invested in Costco but I don't get why Amzn buying WFM affects this company negatively? I'm a costco member and it's a different shopping experience. Now is Amzn got into physical warehouse shopping game...maybe.
"From 2012, Costco has paid $19/shr for special dividends. Those special dividends have only marginally helped the stock price. If Costco just used that money to increase the regular dividend, say from 2.00 to 2.20/yr and increase stock buy back, the stock price would go up considerably.Better still, if Costco increases the dividend and announces stock split, the stock price will be over $200 within a week."
Easiest $3 profit in my trading career. I said. $160 before 154 when it was 157. Out. Next trade
collapses to 250 to get its p/e more reasonable

"President Trump will be mad about Costco opening store in ChinaAlso Chinese president XI will be mad US company CostcoSo, wait for them to restrict Costco somehow.."
I keep hearing how store traffic is down..but I'll bet online orders are more
"Price drop can only be described as reactionary and RIDICULOUS.Once the frightened sheeple and chickens stop to catch their breath, they're going to realize that the value play here is COSTCO. NOTHING can prevent Costco from going into the next day delivery business on their own or likewise with an eager partner. They already have a ""distribution center"" based network 5x the size of Wholefoods. If anything, COST management are the smart players who will let AMZN charge in and take the risks on redefining the consumers shopping behaviour and if and when successful, there's not doubt in my mind that Costco will follow suit and with a newfound success that can't be replicated by Bezos and Amazon. Blaze the trail Bezos, after you finish digging the roads , bridges and Tunnels, COSTCO will be there just in time to eat your lunch!"
typical costco stock...jumps up nice..then will crash back to $300
Costco CFO made a perfect remark about Amazon on the Earnings call. Don't see anything wrong with his remark. No idea why it was misinterpreted. Costco business seems to be doing just fine. Its Amazon that needs to worry about profitability.
"GOLD = PUTS right now....NOW AY this goes above targets of $250......in fact, after options expiration this Friday watch market selloff into midterms! tHIS IS SO overbought IT IS obscene......STOCKS always RETRACE TO THEIR MOVING AVERAGES.....AND THE 50 DAY IS $22 BELOW!!!!!!"
Anyone who bothers to waste money on an Echo has too much money to spend. The only things the only person I know that has one uses it for is a kitchen timer and to play music for the dog when they leave the house. My dogs can enjoy the quiet and be listening for me to come home and I have a cheap kitchen timer that I can walk from room to room or outside holding which I like very much. I love sitting on my front deck with a glass of wine and the timer in hand to know when dinner is ready.
"whats funny is i turned on the scam show CNBC,,they cry like the sky now is falling and everyone should sell,,,they go short and long yet never fully disclose what they have when they talk smack,,,, very funny show,,its a timeshare game they play,,,nothing they say will have any value yet someone will believe the sales poitch"
"costco has been around for a long time and so has amazon,,,both can make it quite well,,now traditional grocery stores will destroy one another to the bottom,,but costco has customers who pay a fee to shop there,,thats whats amazing"
I should of bought more. Where else are you going to stock up during a pandemic?
Bought a boat load on that$20ps down day. booyah. If you didn't buy then you need a broker.
I want an entry point so bad
28 PE too high stock should be 150
COST is up 4.99% to 297.32
er 1.90 more than 19 cents as expexted
Interesting play on the $1.9T stimulus and infrastructure spending bill Look  at Houston Wire and Cable (HWCC). Market cap around $60M. Reduced long term debt from over $90M to under $15M. Largest shareholder and activist investor Nierenberg wants company sold to unlock value.
"Dead money for a long time. I got out yesterday, wish I had a limit that would have been triggered. Didn't like the market. Now that the Amazon/whole foods news of the discounts start Monday, there is NO way to tell how it will affect them for months to come. Monthly sales, maybe, but not for a couple months. The big thing will also be memberships. You will not know this for many months. Those 2 things will keep this stock down. It's PE is also too big for a retailer. I'm glad I bailed when I did. If it gets cheap enough, I'll buy back in. It turns out I made just a tiny bit with everything factored in. Enough for a $10 pizza and a chicken bake. I'd be down all that, and then some if I held. Got nervous when it couldn't break $160. I know something was up. I may get out of Google as well. That can't get over $130, bad feeling. I will bail on that as well if it hits that number again."
"did the stocks get halted,?"
Did the earnings report tank ? Never goes down this much
Cramer.........................BBBBUUUUYYYYYYYY
Look for the silly dips as opportunity to get back in.
Sales will rise further cause people will be forced once again to stay at home... mark my words
semi-weak movement
Next step is $160.9
"dow futures down...probably gunna lose $8 ,tomorrow"

Overreaction. Costco still have one of the best prices in retail shopping. I don't see how the takeover affect the Costco Enterprise.

"THIS AMAZON MYTH.I do not own (and never have owned) shares of Costco, Amazon, Safeway, Kroger, or Ebay.This NONSENSE of how Amazon is going to reshape or change how people buy food or stuff, or how its going to hurt companies like Costo, Safeway, or other food stores---completely #$%$. The media is GETTING PAID to tell you this. Amazon, look whats happening. Their pricing is too high, and they are in cahoots with the shipping companies to make money on shipping charges. Their customer service used to be first class, now its staffed by 3rd world losers with no English skills living in BFE. No, Amazon is going to take away consumer choices. Walgrees and others will quit offering items that Amazon sells, and pretty soon you'll go into a drug store or Safeway, they won't carry the things you always bought--cheap shampoo, dental products, hand soap, bandaids, etc. Getting it from Amazon (because its ""more convenient"") will result in inflated shipping charges and 1 week to 10 days to actually receive it.No, Amazon is not going to change things for the better for the consumer. If you think differently, then you better be buying FedEx or UPS (but then, you become a Union sympathizer....)."
Looks like the MACD is turning...... finally. Lets close from here up.
"costco company has screwed everyone,,,their stock drops from 180 to 150 and they say nothing,,,so maybe the shorts have it right that they will be destroyed by amazon,,,,,, markets are up every stock is running and costco is falling everyday,,, i have to admit they suck now that they cant overcome the amazon game effect"
COST SHOULDNT BE SOLD LIKE OTHER COMPANIES THEY ARE GROWING AND SPECIAL DIV COMING
Down she goes
Why is COST down so much?
Will COST shine over $170 by end of this month?....Bet ya....
"Once again, why does any company report earnings if they go to all time highs after they miss? Costco had horrible horrible earnings and now back near all time highs. So why even have quarterly earnings?"
"Miss earnings, stock goes down, 2 months later back to all time highs. Does anyone else question this behavior?"
DONT FIGHT THE FED THEY BUYING ETFS AND PUSHING MARKET HIGHER TRUMP GOING BE PRESIDENT AGAIN
"hey Kenny, I wanted to discuss that ""nice drop"" and how it relates to your $113 short."
Parabolic nonsense at this point....SHORT 500 shares at $262!!!!!!!!!!!! Why does this trade so thinly anyway?? They can push the price wherever they want it to be!!!!!!!!!
Why the decline at close?

"Breaking News,, the scammer james Cramer of the Street,com says the bears are slowing down on costco,,he has inside information ,"
COST is down 4.90% to 290.25
I warned everyone here not to ignore the triple-bottom last October/November...
One more cliff down tmr!
"Next week I get my EBT. Then I go to Costco and load up. Drink a few brews and shots in the parking lot then holla, free food, son."
Look for COST to start Covid Vaccine shots soon.
BOYCOTTING AMAZON yet? Then keep on losing while amazon eats your lunch.
Holiday crowd has started...

Defensive $$$ coming out of COST to be deployed to tech once correction capitulates.
"I didn't think this would go down so much today because of the xtra business they have been doing, guess im wrong, went down just like every other stock today"
PPS = $90-$100
"My guess remains that the store being hurt most by this deal is Costco.I have been a happy Costco shopper for 40 years. I am a former COST stock holder. But I’m 62, my last kid finally exits the house this summer, and I no longer need to buy 42 rolls of toilet paper at once, or 10 pounds of pork shoulder, or 20 pounds of potatoes. I will soon lack the energy to drag my car 20 miles across town each month for $500 worth of stuff I don’t need, even if the prices are incredible.On the other hand, it might be nice to get a meal-kit, or a prepared meal, delivered to my door soon. Oh, and can they add some wine or a fresh baguette to the order? I’m in.There are tens of millions of baby boomers just like me, retired or on the cusp of retirement, about to face that same choice."
Costco is going full #$%$ with their mandatory mask policy. This will cost them a chunk of their membership. I don?t see anything good coming out of this.
It dropped $1 in a split second.
HEAD FAKE
9/18/20 i added $334We can't even get back to that?

Blood bath tomorrow Not safe at all guys Earnings not that good

I love Costco. Pro Trump company. It sells everything and I mean everything in plastic which destroys the earth. Trump approved environmental destruction company..
"Love their chicken bake, stock will go up"
If it hits $300 will probably drop to $275.
BOYCOTTING AMAZON yet? You deserve losing money on Costco if you are not BOYCOTTING AMAZON.
"HAW!!! Yet ANOTHER one from proboards' ""mnkdcirclejerk"" forum! Yeah!

Wow the market is up 500 and costco goes no where
"COST beats estimate by 6 cents. Sales growth is 5.7% beat estimate 5.1%, i bet you that the stock will go down tomorrow. COST needs to split the stock."
Told you always BUY the silly dips........................
Beat 0.12 cents !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This stock is hopeless
"I hope the hoarders get stuck with their merchandise, Costco should temporarily halt refund on product until this is all over, too many people are taking advantage of gouging the public on resale."
COST is cheap here !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!undervalued !
Crushed it baby!
"Amazon has a new app that will not allow a shopper to compare prices with a competitor when you are in a store, but it will direct you to Amazon's site and perhaps offer a coupon. Does that sound like a fair thing? How can they get a patent on something like that? Boycott Amazon."
wheres Tom at telling everyone to buy the silly dips?
"Options tomorrow, around 340 most will be worthless...."
Why did I dump everything at 324

Costco stock has dropped $30 in a month and its management has not said any word to defend it. Where is the leadership?
COST actually rises tomorrow by EOD. Watch for dips and buy all you can below 309
costco might get bit by th coronavirus bug today..premarket in the red
"hey abolish the fed (aka kored) that Costco short at $140 has to hurt, but don't worry Kenny ""red"" mason shorting Costco at $113 will still post that you are a smart investor."
AH price action is crazy
"COST is moving range bound for now, after the ER it will move up somewhat without major swings. COST is a long term / steady investment"
I knew the damn estimates were set to high to meet. What a joke! Now they better announce a miraculous dividend or stock buyback to get this in the green.
PMI 50.1...almost contraction territory....keep buying here (LOL)!!!!!!!!!

Shop-rites all over crowded.costco ampty & stuck with extra turkeys.
Bring 10 bucks... INTV.... wow..
"Suckers who think something is wrong with the company because if this pullback are first class fools. It's just valuation reasons and nothing more. The stock performance is just re-adjusting imho. This is Costco and by yrs end this will be well over $400! Mid $450's is my call. Forget the noise. And, as for Buffett unloading Costco? He's in a completely different realm than any of us are so he had his reasons."
waiting for $285
I have never in my life been inside a Costco. Ever. But I own several hundred shares of the stock for the dividend and couldn't be happier at the moment. Haven't felt this satisfied since buying AMZN at 650! Wish I had more of both but no serious regrets.
U WONT SEE THIS OVER 305 PROMISE U
"Costco is the worst stock to hold during earnings... unless you have sold options, then it’s really good"

PUT MASK ON TO ON IN STORE JOKE I SHORTED
I have LOVED Costco for 30 years. But I am DCA out of my position as the combination of Government regulations and horrid recent shopping experiences in store and online force me away for now. I just think a pullback is overdue.
Wonder if COST will jump into the WFM takeout game with a share deal. With it's high pe now may be a good time.
most big companies doing 10%+ today. what a dog. smh. cmon
"How we will trust the EarningsIt,s a shame"
"Jim Cramer said AMZN can take on Costco's drug business.Oh, shiat."
"As shopping continues to shift away from brick-and-mortar stores to e-commerce, the worst days for traditional American retailers are ahead. There is no membership fee, parking, time and gas. Kirkland and Costco are too expensive with lousy services."
Must be very bad on the ER
Be great to get COST in the 190's again like in mid December.
"If you don't BOYCOTT AMAZON you deserve to lose money on Amazon. If you have prime, cancel it when it is close to renewal time, otherwise, it will auto renew. This is a serious matter and if you don't take Amazon seriously, you will be losing. and it will be YOUR fault."
COST is down 4.92% to 278.71
Once Biden wins Trump tards are going to looks pretty tardy
Shorty gonna burn. Burn baby burn.
Costco Wholesale is down 4.91% to 294.21
If it is overvalued as Yahoo board say then what's a fair value?
"If it closes below 202, that’s a bearish signal."
this is the time to buy. This is the opportunity to take advantage of the over reaction that has happyend. I have bought more shares today adding to my position.
People eat even during a virus. People are irrational.

#$%$?? Crushes earnings and tanks... okkkk
Thumbs up if you ever see those losers in bright vests pushing shopping carts. Thumbs down if they seem invisible lol.
How is Costco's chicken farm doing any news?
"Eventually , the selling should be ending , there is no good reasoning why this selling is happening . These sellers must think the world is ending and amazon is going to save it and it won't happen ."
Correct...4 central
This rocket is going back to $147 this friday....Good bye forever!!!
"So, let me get this straight...Trump caught a hoax?? (The man is an idiot.)They made the whole thing up to make it appear that he's super-strong and can beat any virus. Trump 'IS' the hoax."
"As in everything, it's just the Law of Supply and Demand...As you hike membership fee, foot traffic to the stores will take a hit as more people will not renew.Same thing at baseball ballpark, if they start raising beer and hot dogs sky high, fewer people will come to the game.If Starbucks raise coffee drinks, foot traffic to the store will dwindle.same thing here at Costco. So Please go ahead and jack up membership fee to $200, $500, $750, etc. please and watch how your business will suffer"
sold @$310. geezus
Keep going down... Will buy at $90
Selling 500 shares at a loss today. This is garbage. My end of year tax loss: Costco. Trash!
Looking to add more 155-157
Come on $235!
"COST is up nicely, time to jump in"
Okay. So it's the weekend and people go to Costco . Get a slice or a dog at the food court. Kid wants a sunday.. You wheel the cart through the amusement park and pick up your stuff. Sample the food. There are many worse places to shop and sometimes people just like getting out of the house.
$120 is critical.. It has been critical.
TRUMP is out of control !!!!!!!!!as usual what he says does NOT mean what he will do ................................take advantage of the SELL OFF
All the grocer's are being hit with the Amazon/WF deal closing sooner than expected. Check KR. Same pattern.
I told you this won’t recover It’s not safe!It broke the support level We will drop to 230!
If you dont believe try going to Costco anytime always packed!
Soon we are able to get drugs at the reasonable price from Amazon. Amazon getting pharmacy licenses in multiple statesAmazon received approval for wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least 12 states after reviewing public records.

Costco is in real trouble now. I'll wait to buy around 125.
Waiting to add more 301-318.00
Monday red
"so the question is,,,what is costco running on now"
"Lol dude enough of this market, everyone else is rewarded for good earnings and im in on the one that tanks im so tired of this garbage."
There are 2 dividend ex dates. today the 8th is the $7 day. you had to buy the stock yesterday to receive the dividend today. the stock is down $7 since the $7 dividend is subtracted from the actual stock price. If you buy today down #$%$ like getting the $7 dividend either way. you need to buy to buy by tomorrow the 9th to receive the .50 dividend on the 10th. the stock will drop .50 that day too. hope this helps clarify
I’m going to Costco to cause chaos for everyone. Look out.
Boeing all the way ! Buy while it’s slow
Way to look out for the shareholders paying these losers 16.00 an hour now..thanks a lot
timmmmmmber

"Only reason this stock went down after hours is because of incorrect articles from Yahoo, Routers, MT Newswire, and PR Newswire. It started the sell-offs in the AH, and made them even seem worse during conference call."
TRUMP will be out for next election vote below please

They have had all the benefits of never closing and yet are below their 52 week high. Up year to date but happy I sold and found greener pastures.
"I don't believe AMZN has such an impact on COST, yet today's correction is well expected and justified. COST may easily recover the loss in the coming weeks, as the overall market sentiment still intact.Congrat those puts buyers."
"Don,t say investingSay GAMPLING"
"I need a whiplash climb back to $160, yep, that would be nice. Where are the big funds that need to buy?"

Hope you buying theSILLY DIPS !325.00 soon
"For decipels, this has become a target for shorts...good luck."
"Most on this board are very naive. Amazon wants all the business. BOYCOTT AMAZON NOW. The only way to hurt Amazon is deprive them of sales. BOYCOTT AMAZON. I personally wont buy anything from Amazon. I am not going to help the enemy. If you say, ""I will just buy this little old thing from Amazon"", you are part of the problem. You deserve to lose money on Costco if you support Amazon."
go green bb
Flat......nothing to see here. Red tomorrow.
"Such a dumb headline: Costco Shares Slide As Coronavirus Expenses Offset Solid Q4 EarningsOf course they are gonna have covid expenses, AMZN spent billions on covid. Ridiculous."

"Not the right forum for this and pointlessto ask again but, please, Costco, bring back the Polish dog and fire the God damned do-gooders who think it is their right to make me eat what they think is good for me. I eat a well balance, nutritious diet most of the time, exercise and keep my weight appropriate for my height. I don't need Costco nannies to tell me how to live. Damn it, when I go to Costco I want my little trat of a Polish dog."

"Costco has loyal shoppers and a lot of shoppers over lap with Amazon because they are successful people who can pay to shop at Costco and can pay for Prime, but Amazon will hurt costco---not immediately, but PLAN AHEAD. Don't just take the ""wait and see"" approach. Be proactive. BOYCOTT ALL AMAZON. Cancel Prime when it comes due. It will auto renew if you don't. Don't buy anything from Amazon to help them destroy all the retail industry from the Macy's of the world to theCVS's Amazon will do pharma once it gets physical stores. I would bet money that the first pharmacy will open within 6 months after Amazon gets Whole Foods and that will take some of Costco's business. BOYCOTT AMAZON NOW."
look for the SILLY dips.. as BUY opportunity..................................
Still drinkin’ the kool-aid in support of your toilet-tweeting President Trash after today??!!

"Order imbalance, market maker had to buy at $152.75 to settle."
Sel sel sel
very disappointment stock
1M chart looks dire. Sell.
"Grimmikins, I just knew that you'd poke your pointy little noggin out of your Mom's house today to celebrate that ""massive drop"" in COST so that you could tell one and all how ""you told us so"".Unfortunately (you won't discuss it), you been warning everyone since $113, where you claimed to have shorted it. So, simple math (don't bother undoing the Velcro to take off your shoes and socks), that leaves you $57/share underwater, even with today's drop.In short, you're a sailor-suited, Momm-moochin', Joey-infatuated Illiterate DumDum that couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with a 12ga. if you were standing inside the barn."
Great Earnings!
"Costco is indicating that some analysts and Cramer are dead wrong.Renewal rates are stagnant because of a credit card switch, and management believes these issues are short-term in nature. After all, the same thing happened in Canada, where a similar switch in fiscal 2015 caused renewal rates to drop a full percentage point. Today, renewal rates in Canada are higher than they were pre-conversion. The same thing will likely happen in the US. No red flags here.Meanwhile, the new member sign-up rate is slowing almost exclusively due to timing. Simply, the more warehouses Costco adds in new markets, the bigger its sign-up rate. The positive takeaway here is that the trend of 60,000 new members per new opening remained intact in the fourth quarter. No red flags here.Memberships per location are falling mostly due to cannibalization. The opening of a new warehouse near an existing warehouse adds to the overall membership base and adds about $80 million to $100 million of new annual sales in that market, but it also dilutes the per-location membership figures by about 10,000. That is a risk worth taking considering the incremental revenue add. Again, no red flags here.Finally, Costco is unquestionably behind in the delivery game, but it doesn’t really matter. Just look at sales and traffic trends. Comps are strongly positive and trending up. Traffic is strongly positive and trending up. Clearly, Costco hasn’t needed delivery yet to drive positive top-line trends. The value prop of an affordable and convenient all-in-one shopping destination is more than enough.Nonetheless, Costco is upping its game in the delivery market. Maybe the moves are defensive, but maybe they are just another growth opportunity for this retail behemoth. After all, it’s not like comps and earnings are falling and Costco has its back against the wall. Considering how robust the growth numbers are currently without great delivery operations, the delivery roll-out feels more like an offensive move than a defensive one"
"202 was the key and it stayed above so that’s bullish, read my posted below.Next week is key. If it pulls away from 202, then we are likely out of the down turn and 202 will now be the support. If it drops on Monday then 202 will be the resistance"
remember $358 2 wks ago
"BURN shorts BURN.....................................as I said before COST always bounces back , this is just the beginning..................."
Anyone knows any vaild stocks with good dividend givebacks?
WALMART+ to take down COST
The best ER ever in history
PE to high risky should dump more downside people don't want to be in congested places like Costco use sanitizer

i am back in 157.78
First time I've ever done this after earnings.. I'm an option trader and got burnt pretty bad this week with all my calls expiring worthless. But i doubled up and bought $445 calls for next week and am feeling very confident!
"Costco down, ...great!... buying some more, I can't see someone packing my fresh produce. Amazon is great for shopping on a wide range of products, and I will continue to use it....Costco gives me the opportunity to look/feel and in some case taste what I am buying...two different stores...I can see more smaller stores, that have carved fresh produce deliveries, lose some of their business to AMZN."
Too much shorting going on
Good morning long. I think it’s going to be a good day. Watch it. It will go back to 347 today.
There she goes
"I went to Costco on Friday. The line at the cashiers' was too long. I rushed home. On Sunday, I went back, and the lines were worse. I needed to buy a few things still. I spent $350. I thought: to hell with the Amazon story. This morning, I added shares and calls, and i'm smiling broadly. I'll sell the stocks at $170."
he he haaaa
Well that was a swift kick in the nuts today.
I see a GREEN close today.
BS downgrade. Bernstein is a moron and has no clue. He admits to missing the run up over the past few years. He’s probably loading up now.
Missed on both side

"i make a lot purchases on Amazon. But there is no way that Amazon can compete based on shipping costs the absolute efficiency of driving ones SUV and loading up a monster cart with everything you need. I didn't think I needed Costco until last month when I saved a ton of money on New mattress, in addition to my regular purchases of nitrate free Turkey bacon, chocolate covered almonds, and don't forget that independant anaslysis of fake olive oil shows Kirkland brand organic olive oil is much better quality than what whole foodies selling."

"Come on 189, I know u can get there"

COST should never be less than AMZN
"COST became a low volume trade, not sure why"
COST reached an all time high at 296.38

Need volume to be higher to confirm a bottom. Volume is way toooooo low.
"why are people buying call options for the 160 for next week,, its not running,,fools"
COST is down 6.38% to 283.00
Costco needs to limit number of people. 100+ gather in a building won’t jive!!
Costco Disappoints and pe 32 is ridiculous this needs to fall to 175..
"This is a Great company. I can not understand why this continues to drop other than a bunch of wimps, sheep who follow the herd to slaughter. If Amazon takes away any share it will be several years & I don't believe they will change COST EPS at all, any intelligent opinions?"
Did you need a Costco membership to buy Costco stock? No you just have to be a tard
COST is up 4.93% to 227.48

"Just because the margins are down, the stock is really selling off. Well, Amazon gets a pass. They don't have to make much money. If AWS didn't fund the rest of the business, they would be hard pressed to show any profit at all. BOYCOTT AMAZON FOR THE HEALTH OF THE ECONOMY."
"@ Riley, yes one day the market will go through a serious realignment but not now, interest rates are still very low, consumer confidence is high, corporation are making insane profits, The bears are in the cave, enjoy it while it last"

Look at BABYF plant based formula that will probably end up at COST at some point.
Let?s f#^%<#$%$>%#$%$ go
I like Costco but the Costco by my house has gone down in customer service a lot. It seems like all the workers are always having bad days. Anyone else notice this? Hoping it’s just an issue my local Costco is having. Almost thought about not renewing because of it
Amazon + Costco could end up as a GREAT partnership !!!positive things from here..............................
Did I miss something stock just jumped and Dow spy and Nasdaq are all down
to all the 350 call buyers ... THANK YOU !!! loved selling those to you bagholders
walmart and target stock doing much better
avoid falling knife here. more pains to come.
"Bought 6K of Costco on the cheap! The reason Whole Paycheck was half price is because the store is bloated and inventory turns are low. Costco has the best inventory turns therefore the best price. Funny how walmart, kroger, and Target are all down. Nobody mention Traders Joes. They are killing all the grocery stores except Costco. You can't make a whole foods a trader joes unless you cut the physical store in half."
Costco was empty this week. Not one car was getting new tires. People working off their hoard for the next several months.
LVXI. Heavy trading buy volume
"THANKS for the heroin FED reserve.....a junky addicted to cheap money will eventually DIE. I doubled my PUT position paying $2.5 for the July 5, $265 PUTS....up FOURTEEN straight will not hold.

It’s been red since December. Im sick of this.
"how funny is it they down grade costco,,,costco is huge and amazon will not hurt them at all"
after hours getting killed. can't find any news
down $20...this is oversold
KEEP CALM AND JUST WATCH
Looks pretty cheap but I prefer M for yield.
"Costco puts the customer first. Their return policy is the best and even gets abused but this guarantees return customers, returning to the yearly membership fee to gladly pay up. It's a club after all and people want in! Where can I get a 3 pound can of Colombian coffee for only $9.99 ..Costco."
Big line going into Costco yesterday due to them handing out sanitary wipes for your shopping cart at the entrance.
Ouch ...I’m getting killed
Even with the crowds this might be down 10
Will we see $280’s by the weekend?
"IS THERE ANY HONESTY ? I POSTED A FEW MESSAGES NEGATIVE IN NATURE SEEING THAT THE STOCK HAS LOST ABOUT 30 POINTS IN 3 WEEKS AND MY COMMENTS ARE NO WHERE TO BE FOUND. THE ONLY ONES THAT EXIST ARE THE POSITIVE COMMENTS ' GEEE...THE STOCK IS LOW, GREAT TIME TO BUY' IS THERE ANY INTEGRITY HERE ? PUBLISH THE GOOD AND THE BAD."
Look for these SILLY DIPS as another entry point.

I mean, that's only $62 in the wrong direction.Then again, when you've got an imaginary yacht, think that you live in the south of France (when in fact you live with your Mom, 'cause your adult life failed), what's one more whopper to an old fibber?Please note that I didn't mention any names.

"i would have to be on life support before I ordered groceries from Amazon. Wall Street just thinks Amazon can do no wrong. In actuality, they need to start turning a profit. The only place they make money is on the cloud and Amazon and Jeff Bezos are neither charitable. Walmart gave over 30 million to the recent disasters and I read Amazon gave 1 mil. Amazon is too busy trying to destroy every industry. I fully expect them to have a birthing room soon with a child care facility in the middle and a funeral home on the end very soon. Each day they announce getting into some new industry which takes down everything in that sector. Today it was the drugstores and yesterday it was the delivery sector. BOYCOTT AMAZON BECAUSE IT IS A CANCER AND THE WORLD CAN DO WITHOUT IT."
COST is NOT China !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!buy on weakness........................
Morning/mid day dip and back up/higher in afternoon/close. Rinse and repeat.
COST way UNDERVALUED here.Great entry.

"Costco has extremely loyal customers, and the prices beat Amzn almost across the board. The New Item offerings are fantastic, along with the research that goes behind the products they sell. Good luck trying to chizzle off any kind of meaningful customer base from them. Load up on Cost."
I guess these earnings aren't good enough for the investors so they sell!
Where are the bashers today???????
The problem with food delivery is: many stores tried that before and no one was successful. People tend to see product before buying and eating it. Delivery food... doh how come those eggs so small today.

Watch out. Cramer jinx the stocks and ask everyone to take profit. Either people will create volume for institutions to kill you when you short or the stock will drop 5% on profit take
COST usually disappoints
"They announced their special $7 divvy a week ago. It was around $176 and change. Now it is $182 and change. The reason is everybody wants that divvy and there are few sellers. So next time they announce a monster divvy, get in quick."
"the issue is the Bulls are not buying the stock because they are waiting for weak hands to sell here,, and drive it down to 149 level"
Lets see how things go. Have some calls ready for this ER

"why is everyone ARGUING how great COSTCO is,,,the stock is what matters and how many are not happy the stock has dropped from 169 to 154,,, NO ONE,,,so shorts and longs are killing it"
Amazon WILL PUT EVERYONE OUT OF BUSINESS. Costco membership doesn't even provide free delivery nor does it provide consumers streaming video.

Bought this garbage at 378 a share because I was under the impression COST couldn’t lose. What a bone head I am. Dropping this trash at a loss. Figures.
"As shopping continues to shift away from brick-and-mortar stores to e-commerce, the worst days for traditional American retailers are ahead. There is no membership fee, parking, time and gas.Kirkland and Costco are too expensive with lousy services and membership fee."
Told ya the bleeding has just begun! $290 open tomorrow
"I think most people fall in love with Costco products and services, and in return willing to pay a high stock price. But bottom line to make money in stocks, it is valuation, valuation and valuation. Looking at the company's PE, profit margin, operation margin, ROE, revenue and profit growth and compared that to other retail stores, then you will see why the COST price is bit pricey."

The run on TP and paper towels is on again. Idiots! Costco just got in pallets of both today and every cart had one of each whether they needed it or not. They ran out within 30 minutes and a whole isle was overflowing with the product. What is wrong with people? Costco will always do well. The place was packed and every checker had a back up line of customers.

"P/E of COST is 36, but it should be 16 to 20. Clearly over-valued."
"It's about margin comprehension Amazon is going to put so much pressure on everyone throughout the food supply chains to lower cost. This will be a great time for the consumers, not so much for the suppliers, distributors and retailers. including Costco. Amazon won't care for a long long time if they lose $$$$ in groceries."
"weak. so disappointing. all those that bought early March. projection was NOT to be down 10% down, it was for a big pop considering their surge in sales due to the pandemic. this was so disappointing."

why is cost dropping so much?
Trump has lost his trade war. China's economy is still growing at 5% while US manufacturing is falling. This will take down COST also.
"I think this stock is mbvaxed at $300...doednt seem to wander much from that, thasts where the big boys like it"
Anyone who buys anything on Amazon deserves to lose money on Costco stock. BECAUSE YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM.
Anyone know when the board meeting is?
Thatza bingo!!’
"darn it. I had sold covered call with 230 strike, Oct 26 expiration. 3 days later for this drop, and my call would have saved me a lot of money.oh well, just work a year longer now I guess"
"Amazon is a cancer and if you shop there, you are helping the enemy."
I love that drop.
Still out of Kirkland toilet paper and Perdue panko chicken nuggets? And so much overstocked stuff that just does not and will not sell.Come on and get your act together and re-stock the stuff that sells.
Look for the silly DIPS to add more290.00
AMAZON deal probably NOT going to go through !!!!!
Seems that Costco survived the Amazon impact
"Yes yes, the 20+ year up trend will be broken tomorrow and it will be down 50$ after crushing estimates... You shorts are not very bright are you"
another red day
"Costco will end the day 310+, if no new rTump screws the day."
"once the best stock available, been here a long time...now a low to mediocre stock..can't hold any gains...sad to see this falter"
"curious to see what happens tomorrow, shouldn't pay attention too heavily to after-hours trading in my opinion"
I buy a put it goes up I buy a call it goes down next I’ll buy both and still lose smdh
"Where's my little sailor-suited sissy Grimmikins (aka Stephen) to celebrate with his customary ""love that drop"" post?Grimmikins (aka Stephen) was the sailor-suited l'il sissy that bragged last year to all how he shorted COST at $113.C'mon, Grimbelina....step up and take your enema, ya l'il Mommy-moochin', sailor-suited sissy....."
Amazon eyeing Costco next. Bulk up.
"Costco May be out of toilet paper, bleach and water......but that’s not enough to keep this propped up. Tanking in ah’s."
Here comes 275
Down 5 bucks
There is Life after AMAZON ......................Less competition the better for COST.BBBBUUUUYYYYYYYY
Serving a $1.50 hot dog & soda is now more labor intensive.
380 soon... shorts are still not covered :)
"Costco should really be raising their prices on a few item such as their $1.50 hot dog plus large drink to say $1.75 to $2.00. This is something they sell a lot of which they've never increase the price of. There's also their $5 rotisserie chicken, they must sell tons of those a day."
Ouch
"COSTCO VS SAMS/WALMART---COSTCO IS CHEAP VS WMT. IF PRICE DROPS BUY BUY BUY BUY MORE IT WILL PAY OFF IF PEOPLE BOUGHT ON MARGIN THEY DUMB LET THEM SELL U BUY MORE MORE MORE. IF YOU GO TO COSTCO AND SEE THE CROWD AND AMOUNT OF SHOPPING ON LINE AND STORE U WOULDNT BE SELLING THIS STOCK.Wal-Mart has split its stock 11 times since going public in 1970. But there doesn't seem to be any magical share price that triggers the split. For instance, it split shares in August 1975 when the stock was $23 but also in April 1999, when the stock was $89.75."
Not cool
Short covering big time
hmm im thinking it's time to shorty overdue for a pull back
"AMZN is like EF Hutton. ""When Amazon talks, people listen,"" lol. My god look at CVS and WBA. Ouch!!"
Sell all the cost shares before it 's too late.
I sold my shares at 300 last week #$%$
MISSED! wow
dammit..after hours looks good should have stayed
How much Costco merchandise comes from China?
I am long Costco but if target beat this should also beat does not sound good logical to me?
"In doing DD for earnings Costco is unique in that they release their sales numbers monthly leading up to the 10k. Before I bought my Oct 2 call, I wanted to be sure the SP wasn't baked heading into earnings. June 30- 300 to 325. July 30-- 325 to 350. So....Wall St. guys can clown my retail investor technical analysis but after looking at their August numbers I see bar napkin math pointing me to a clean run to $375 this week. I wouldn't be surprised if it tested 400 at the peak of excitement before settling in around $380ish"
Nice spike!!
ughhh....can't sleep. worried about my calls tomorrow. gonna go down to 4th street to see if I can score me some crystal meth
"Don't worry, Costco will raise the membership to $100 for basic & $200 for Executive to make it up, then the next quarter will be even worse."
this is proof costco needs to split its getting too expensive
"Where are all those people shouting for hours, days, weeks, months that Costco would go to 330-350? Damn internet brokers."
"Missed to take profit this morning or yesterday, now back to waiting... hope it will bounce instead of going to 150"
There is some vicious shorting going on today!
About time this junk stock drops.
BUY ALL these silly dips..........................................
Yup. Red.
Crazy overvalued with 36 PE with extremely low growth and low profit margin @ 2.5%. Fair value $250 at max.
this is a crazy reaction to this great compny. Their business will continue as always. This is an opportunity to buy a great company at a very low price. A great buying opportunity. Those who buy will reap the benefits as soon as this whole thing blows over.
What kind of market let's a consumer retail company sport a pe of 30?? Its insane. This one should not be above 15pe
Short this thing big! Amzn will eventually keep this stock at bottom fishing levels for a very long time if not forever unless costo joins another giant to compete.
The reason it’s dropping is because people are seeing their 401k in the gutter and they’re selling for whatever they can so they don’t lose everything they have. Traders are manipulating this market.. recession on the horizon
can AMZN be a threat to Costco?
COST has been flirting with the 50 dma (305) for some time now. Seems like every time it tries to breakout some idiot analyst will issue a downgrade to push it back under.
Took short positions with closing eyes
Trump's will sanction China where Costco gets 90 percent of its goods that non-food. Bad news for them.
back to $300....geezus
How many of you simpletons took the bait dangled by the so called analysts who work on behalf of the short sellers and manipulators on Wall St.? Hopefully not to many. Much of today's churn was just the idiots churning the stock back and forth to each other. Better day tomorrow. Even better by the end of the week.
Where are the chumpies who predicted $325 today?
THANKS FOR 294.25
Dead Cat bounce..............................
Look for moreQ E next
"Where else can you buy a $400,000 diamond ring online!"
i think 320 is a ddcent support for Costco
futures up again after the fed pumped more money into the economy..costco down..pure msnipulstion
PE is too low. It should be at least 75.
"Hey, where's my little Mommy-moochin', sailor-suited sissy? You know the one I mean, the one that claimed to have shorted COST at $113 but won't acknowledge it, talk about it, or man up. Oh well, I guess you have to be a man to man up."
"Trump’s big mouth, no task force, took 200+ points off the Dow. Bloated moron"
COST has NO bearing on TRADE WAR........................................
Please go down to $100
Stock should be priced around 250
fake news
this makes no sense to me..last quarter excellent numbers stock tanks...today excellent numbers stock tanks...unreal
Day Traders giving you a BARGAIN here.
Costco is too expensive and customers have to pay for stupid membership. It takes time for Costco and Kirkland to follow Sears and K-Mart. Zombie stocks. Time to move to Amazon and online retailers.
"Good reasons to drop expensive COSTCO membership and never look back. As a member of Amazon Prime, you get a convenient and well-publicized perk: free two-day shipping on almost any item on Amazon. But the $99-per-year membership actually gets you a lot more than expedited shipping. In fact, signing up for Prime unlocks features like Amazon's vast digital library of music, movies, television, and books; one-hour restaurant delivery; and unlimited cloud storage for your photos. And starting soon, Prime members will get special discounts at Whole Foods, thanks to Amazon's acquisition of the grocer, which is expected to close on Monday.Here are 18 of the coolest benefits of Amazon Prime. https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200444160&tag=bisafetynet2-20"
"Costco is almost always packed full of people. It's hard to see it going down anytime soon. Great buying opportunity. Buy on fear, sell on greed."
any idea of next dividend pay date
Costco just dropped a vendor for an honest representation of Black Lives Matter (look at their web site) Thought Costco would at least not attack a supplier for an honest and heartfelt Facebook comment. SHAME on you Costco!
disappointment
how many times does Jim Cramer have to pimp Costco before it goes up again
Old stale foods makes $.
costblo stores empty as we approach Christmas.All customers shopping at shop-rite.People tired of lousy costblo.
"You can get anything at Costcos. I needed a car battery yesterday. Did not think about it twice. Went to Costco and saved over 50 dollars compared to Advance Auto parts. The same with luxury watches , TVs etc. It was Wednesday and the store was packed."
TRUMP cant BLAME POWELL now for market meltdown......................................
"COSTCO sucks,,wall street shorts own it,,, drown it at 153,,amazing how they kept it down on friday,,, same ole scam and noone goes to jail because they own the game,,get me back to 160 and i am out"
"TO: TERRENCECOSTCO, BJ, AND SAMS ARE BEING SEVERLY IMPACTED BY AMAZON. EVEN THOUGH MANY OF THE WHOLESALERS HAVE INCREASED MINIMUM WAGES TURNOVER REMAINS A VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEM.

QUITE FRANKLY, THEY MAKE SOME REAL BONEHEAD DECISIONS: NOT ACCEPTING AMEX CREDIT CARDS; ENGAGING IN SOCIO/POLITICAL ADVERTISING...A BIG NO NO FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES AND OTHER ISSUES...THIS IS A ""CHEAP"" COMPANY!

Costco sitting on the sidelines as the stock market rages

Costco is a buy next move $165
Okay earnings; they expected more apparently
wheres that special dividend
"Long term investors , take advantage of the fire sale here , as it is way overdone at these levels.COST will rebound and come back hard as usual.MARK MY WORDS here."

How much is everyone down ?
This was at $297 earlier what a joke.
"MM""s want below344.00look for the dips as a buy .........................................."
I'm stunned this is the price action after a great earnings report...hate to see what would have happend on a bad earnings report
"with $2 div only, you will get back after 25 yrs"
$15-20 haircut coming today
Or 150
Drop baby drop.
Cost packs everyday. it will fool around at 165-167 another week before earnings report. The earnings number is great which I have no doubt. The only thing is the market looks like they want to turn down a bit before it goes higher.
340.00 soon..................................
One of those orange jacket cart pushing uneducated goons hit my car with shopping carts the other day. Why do they employ such uneducated goons?
"Every Costco Employee: Hey boss, I make like $12 an hour.

Just bought some for the first time. Looks like a good time to add with the pullback.
needs to become local AMZN drop points
BUYER260.00
Looking for the SILLY DIPS305.00-310.00
my opinion why Costco took on a tremendous amt of more debt to issue special dividend dividend of $7 was to discourage someone like walmart not to submitatakeover bid of the great company that Costco is
Going red... imagine that
Save some $$$$$$$to buy the SILLY DIPS............
"I bought a giant bag of colored carrots. they were already rotten by first day at home. Costco has GOT to get a handle on their rotting produce problem, imo!!!"
Huge buying opportunity!!!
you and me both bro!!
This is for all you Robin Hood wanna be daytraders. You’re just gambling when you buy on earnings day. You’re not an investor. So sell your shares and come back in 3 months to play again when it’s at $400. Clowns
Ok ill be positive but when you have calls in play red isn’t good but hey I’ll join the positive bandwagon and go buy a Corvette tonight from all my profits that come rolling in tommorow I’m all in with you
$360 is that a buy? or more like $350? Thoughts?
"pure manipulation here..down $4 @ open, up $3...down $4....rigged"
A little too pricey here
would love to pick up some cost at around 240-250 a share.
COSTCO TANKS AFTER EVERY EARNINGS WITHOUT FAIL! LOOK IT UP
this should be up...it was up $3 earlier
"Falls hard on conf. call,"
I'm glad that everyone is off the $400 kick...never gunna see that
"If you are not BOYCOTTING AMAZON, YOU DESERVE TO LOSE MONEY ON COSTCO, BECAUSE YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM."
typical Friday...red day
Does anyone think there will be a Dec. pull back like we had last year ?
Last year I bought HD at 138 and it started going down though they did very well in sales number due to speculation..I cut the loss at 118 even though I knew it's good stock to hold.. seeing red every day created so much stress... On next day it bounced back and it is up and up every day and it crossed 138 very quickly... but loss is lossI see similar pattern here and believe it will bounce back soon but you never know
The bears have beat up costco...150 will be thete in 3 months

I worked hard for my money and I watched where I spent them"
Americans are STUPID. No wonder most of them live paycheck to paycheck and not watching where they spent money on useless annual membership fees.
The stage is set for a self-inflicted recession:https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/23/business/recession-trade-war-tax-cuts/index.html

Down 3 percent ? Amzn again ? They are eating Costco lunch ?
Complete Bull&^%$
Harbag. How are you bag holder?
"I would hope costco would split this, bring some life to this dying stock"
"Today's drop is an over-reaction to the perception of shrinking margins due to Amazon and the thought that they are taking over the world. I shop in Costco literally every weekend and can tell you that the store is packed beyond imagination. Shrinking margins or not, the volume of sales that Costco does in relation to a typical brick and mortar store is unheard of. Costco will continue to drive their business model forward with or without the fear of Amazon. I will continue to accumulate at these levels. Stock is selling at a discount and will hit $180 within 3 mos."
"lol Kenny red mason losing againnnnnnnnn! cover that 113 short son.btw, how much are you losing when that riteaid buyout goes through since the offer is less than when you bought it?"

Load up on Costco and  can’t go wrong
"My read on Costco, AH 360. Rest will depend on the idiot / stimulus hungry investors how they screw it in PM tomorrow.Sorry but fact is a fact... no heart feelings."
My bet is if Costco membership and renewal doesn’t show a dramatic increase we will see this dropping after er the sales numbers has been baked into the price already it’s all about membership tomorrow I don’t see an increase of more than 2-3% if they beat expectation....the amazon affect is still very much lingering over Costco
why such a big drop today??
The shorts are too stupid to short Costco. It will be $400 stock soon
"I hate seeing amazon news on my Costco feed ,??"
This stock usually trades down after earnings.
"In the next two weeks, there will be some boneheads come to upgrade COST to buy."
Dead stock walking
we need to break the top of that symmetrical wedge. another 2% ought to do it.

Trump deal w China-yeah right.Bloated lying fool
"My parents do purchase a Costco membership but my sister and her husband (and they do make big income working for a drug firm and could afford to pay membership card but they don't since they are too cheap). They would go in to shop along with my parents and their stuff would ring up together, then when they return home he would give my dad the money for his stuff. He said why pay? That is why is $500,000 home is paid up and all the money they now make close to $260K a year for both of them goes to savings for retirement. They are taking a cruse this week along with my parents."
I think short seller Chanos must've put out fake news! lol
Look for the SILLY DIPS as a BUY opportunity .Sales continue to soar !Cramer says its a great entry here.
How in the hell does Costco drop $16 over the weekend..
why is this not moving the earnings were incredible. Strange
4:1 split after $400?
$COST I'm in at 297.73 80 shares...$DAL short it
Targets for COST maintained as BUY.................................
The reason COSTCO is down because AMZN with the help of his friends who own the News media make it so. AMZN has to buy COSTCO to compete with Walmart. At of now AMZN is just a paper tiger. 30 billions sales in his last quarter compare to Costco 41 billions. Take out all the hypes and you will see that AMZN pose no threat to Walmart. All AMZN vendors are selling on Walmart now.
Hey Hairy -So your genius move was to sell your 6 shares at 310. You complained for the last six months about what a #$%$ stock it is but you continue to stick around even After panic selling. You?ve been wrong since you started commenting on this board and you continue to be wrong. Your impatience and shortsightedness has cost you a lot of money. Just give it up man. Your party is over.
They are way over due for a special dividend.

"Stupid to buy COST for special $10, since price went up $10 = you are buying your dividend, plus you have to pay income tax, so only $8 divy net. Distribution is only 2.6% annual before taxes. Get tax free 'distribution' by waiting for a market drop. COSTCO's appreciation is slowing if you check price curves. Better to make money on price drops or buy something else."
Dow down 1000 this week. Nice job Traitor Trump. You really showed the Chinese who’s the idiot.
Target is the one to own for the holidays.. WMT as well.
I'm sure Costco stock will be up by the end of the day ! My opinion .
"COST is close to turning into a dumpster fire. Unfortunately, it doesn't matter how profitable they are, how many people shop there, how crowded the parking lots are, or how good their deals are. Yesterday, after a precipitous drop 2 weeks ago, the market rejected the stock again, as evidenced by it's breaking strong support and its 200 day moving average on very strong selling volume. It will turn around sometime, but I have no interest in riding this down. I'll re-enter when it shows technical signs of a reversal. Till then, I'll let someone else take the hit."

"I am confused,,,everyone knew about amazon,,,,ok,, Amazon cant take over COSTCO business,will never happen, so how is it taht the PE on Cost at 26 is too high,, WRONG,, The reality is AMAZON PE is so high it can not succeed,,,but why is it everyone is scared of being in Costco at 151 level...i dont understand it,,if tahts the case we should not be in any stock out here at all"
Once I'm in at $279 (today?) it can stay above $300 where it should be 
Seriously dude; AH they are trying to keep it not run . Jokers.

Costco's $1.50 hotdog and soda deal is still the best.
Costco employees caught covid-19 and management did not communicate properly to the staff. I expect some backlash on this.
cost is worth $100 only
Ever heard of a head fake
thanks
Why the FÖK is this crashing?!
Lower groceries is actually GOOD for COST since it eliminates competition; besides COST make majority of $$$ from membership fees NOT groceries.
"Missed on revenues by 20 million and missed earnings by 2 centsthe 1.24 was a non gaap number that resulted from a 7 cents 1 time non reoccuring gain that will not happen next quarter..Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) has reported first-quarter results, with diluted earnings-per-share coming in at $1.24 on $27.47 billion in revenue. The consensus estimate based on FactSet was diluted EPS of $1.19 on $28.3 billion in revenue. In the year-ago quarter, diluted EPS came in at $1.09. The $1.24 result this quarter included a non-recurring legal settlement of $0.07 per diluted share. Revenue increased 3% on a year-over-year basis. Comparables, or same-store sales, increased 1% year-over-year, with the United States and Canada seeing 1% and 4% gains, respectively. So-called ""Other International"" same-store sales came in flat. Excluding foreign exchange and the impact of changes"

"COST is a strong company, buy its share at a deep discount. Amazone can not sell gasoline on line, Costco can. Costco collects its annual membership fee (a billion dollar annual revenue) from the members around the world, Amazon can not. These are the facts that not so many people can think about them.Wall Street traders and hedge fund managers used the opportunity (AMZN buys Whole Foods) to drag the COST share price down so they can buy more shares. That is it."

"Costco Sales growth slowing down made the news and the stock took a breather. However, an article from Motley Fool pointed out that could be due to the accounting weeks of 12 vs 13 weeks. This would make sense as I have not detected any less traffic while going to Costco. I wonder if the Gee-whiz kids from Financial Services have adjusted the accounting weeks when reporting the Sales. Now people are aware of this difference in accounting weeks, the Earning Reports that is coming, hopefully would be adjusted. If Sales growth are increasing not decreasing, Earnings should follow suit. For those who are not into this stock, this could be an opportunity to get it. Another good Earning Report could push the stock higher. https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/05/costcos-sales-stayed-hot-in-most-of-november/"

"There is a news article under Costco that shows someone has an optiontrade on that cost over 2million betting that costco will go to 115 by Jan. That is a long way down from the current price. I hope that doesn't happen, but anyone on this board who shops at Amazon is helping to cause it. BOYCOTT AMAZON"
Bloated orange blob
Lol Trump. Leave China. I order you to leave China!
No green day.. so sad...so sad.
To many puts !!! Will be at 330
costblow sells outdated food.
Soon opening ... 'Cost-So' by Mr So... a complete knockoff of Costco
"I agree that B is a great company, but Amazon usually hurts everyone, so BOYCOTT AMAZON. If you have Prime, give it up when it is time for renewal. It will auto renew if you don't. Buying anything on Amazon helps the enemy."
Up and down ....no Bueno
"""material weakness"" and guidance.???"
This pony is heading to 160..only speculation
Look for theSILLY DIPS....................................as another buy opportunity.way undervalued here.
"Dead money, should fall back to $260 in the coming weeks."
COST almost always BOUNCES back up..buy on any weakness here.
I'll be darned. What happened 
What a wasted trade. Sold for a loss..
"thru out the entire covid, costco did so well. why is this stock not going anywhere? stuck in low 300's for almost a year now."

How's everyone doing.....cashed out my PUTS....made over $k in th e last week on COST....made even More with XLP PUTS!
Who upgraded Costco today
Putin laughing at us - says US no longer a superpower. China and Germany are the new superpowers. A moron in the oval office can do a lot of damage in 4 short years (which seemed like an eternity).
regarding costco travel... be warned if you book a hilton vacation through costco you WILL NOT receive the points or the nights to your hilton account. first hand very poor experience
"You have to admit, if Amazon is getting into food, it is going to take some of Costco's business. That is a fact that you can't deny. I would say most Costco customers are Prime members because if they are willing to pay a membership fee, they are willing to pay for Prime. So losing any business to Amazon is too much. Don't just ignore the problem, when your Prime comes up for renewal, don't let it auto renew, cancel it. We have got to keep Amazon at bay. When a company loses business, the stock will drop---Now that is a fact of life. Amazon will hurt Costco. I didn't say they would drive them out of business, but they will cause the stock price to drop because of lost sales. Don't be naive."
time to find a stock that worthy. Back to $150 or lower...
how do you see if p/e ratio is to high
"Tomorrow up $5.00 - $10.00, short gets fried!"
SHORT U WONT SEE 305
I wish Cramer would shut up already about Costco!! At least there was an upgrade.
"Held up nicely, just wait until Monday when store numbers are being discussed"
A $20 per share hit today?? What was that all about?
"Riyadh (AFP) - A Saudi financial newspaper Sunday retracted an article it published the previous day saying that Riyadh planned to sell a 49 percent stake in state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco within a decade.""Al-Eqtisadiah apologises for the information published on Aramco,"" said the paper, which like most media in Saudi Arabia is close to the authorities.Saturday's edition quoted an unnamed senior official as saying that the kingdom would sell nearly half of its sole oil producer within 10 years.""The shares for sale and the timeframe are different to those mentioned in the article,"" the paper said on Sunday.The kingdom is looking to diversify its oil-dependent economy and has already announced cutbacks after its 2015 deficit snowballed to $97 billion (93 billion euros).The IPO for state-owned Aramco could take place in 2018 and an initial sale of a five percent share is expected to form the basis for the fund holding around $2 trillion in assets.The firm will next year begin publishing quarterly results in a bid to attract potential investors, Aramco chief Amin Nasser has said."
"walmart, target, better investment"
Costco should partnered with Shopify and Shopify should introduce cloud services .

After the numbers are inspected, that's what the consensus will be and the line at the exit doors will be crowded let alone what Amazon will do to them imo https://finance.yahoo.com/news/costcos-quarterly-comp-sales-miss-202431174.htmlShrinking margins cloud Costco's profit beat, shares fall"
"The bull market giveth, the bear market taketh away"
"Holding up well here, look for buy opportunities."
costco doesnt have much room to grow.

Why Costco can’t go higher since last July.
Costco is one of the best company you ever seen the services company is variant very good
"The fee increase will work out for cost because currently it already is a huge rev maker. for members, it is really nothing comparing with the savings. If you use the gasoline from costco, you get your money back with several fills. It is a no brainer move and once the street digested the missed numbers, they will focus on the fee windfall. they drop the price, load up and then hike the PT!"
why is this not going up?
More and more AR products will be sold in Costco. $WIMI
"Global war could hurt! But then we will all become homeless. Watch some videos on homeless and learn to livewith buckets to #$%$ in while living under tents. I am 74, so I will escape by death! Meanwhile Costco is going to $220."

Look at NAT making a comeback! Oil coming back folks...

"I fully expect Amazon to be going into the dental business tomorrow. They will send a dentist to your house to extract teeth. Today they announced a geek squad to take away Best Buys business. If you don't BOYCOTT AMAZON, I hope everyone who shops there loses money in their brokerage account. If you own any retailers, grocers, auto supply places, food companies, pharma companies, etc. The list grows daily. They will be selling insurance probably next week."
300 by tomorrow?
People will spend less and much less now than 2 weeks ago when they tried to stock up everything

EVERYONE IS EXPECTING COSTCO TO HAVE BLOW OUT NUMBERS BECAUSE....'GEEEE..EVERY TIME I DRIVE BY THERE'S ALWAYS A LINE OUTSIDE' INTERESTING. MAYBE THEYRE JUST BUYING TOILET PAPER. IN ANY EVENT, THE STOCK IS DOWN SOME 60 POINTS IN11 WEEKS. WHAT IF...AND I'M JUST SPECULATING HERE.... WHAT IF, THEY MISS TOMORROWS NUMBERS ? CAN YOU IMAGINE THE HIT ON THE STOCK THEN ? FOR YOU EDITORS UT THERE, WHO WANT TO POST ONLY POSITIVE COMMENTS, TRY TO RETAIN THIS LONGER THAN 20 SECONDS. HAVE SOME INTEGRITY."

Credit Card Boomdoggle. I know someone real smart at Costco thought they could save all this money by going to VISA. See what you get? To me it cheapens the Costco brand. It makes it more like the B&I down in Tacoma.
Should fall to at least $280 until support is found over the next few weeks.
Look for the dumb people who sell off
"cant get ahesd...this stock is at a stalemate...up $8 yesterday, down $4 today, will lose $4 ,tomorrow. $300 max price for this stock"

"Wanting to sell my Facebook shares and put it into discount retail. Have spent way too much time over the last few months researching EVERY store.in that sector. Without question, the four best are COST - Dollar General/DG - Ross Stores/ROST - Burlington Stores/BURL. I'm driving myself crazy trying to decide which of the four to go with, while in the meantime the share prices keep going up. They're all excellent, solid companies. Can't decide which to choose. Informed opinions would be appreciated.. Thanks."

"If you are not BOYCOTTING AMAZON, you deserve to have costco going down. Costco is a great company and AMAZON is taking down everyone that competes with them. I won't buy a thing from them. Amazon announced wanting to get into food service so today those stocks are down. The next thing you know they will have a brokerage firm with trades costing a few cents. BOYCOTT AMAZON"

"Hey Awesome, how did that short you placed yesterday work for ya.... idiot."

"can you say ""irrational exhuberance"" ????"
Holding through earnings! Good luck to everyone.

"I guess it right, no matter how good COST is, earnings top estimate, growth is also top estimate, but they keep AMZN in the future. I will wait for COST to come down 150 again. I think COST should think about the split, so the price does not look expensive. 3-1 is a good one, raise the dividends is another way. i will not touch COST until I HEAR COST SAY SPLIT."

"looks like when you drop $8 in day and a company is a powerhouse it tells you it was weak at 155-160 level,,wait for 145,"
Costco doesn't want to be above $300 for long.

It's a disaster. Missed estimates plus a lawsuit.
"After the initial rush, Costco is eventually one of the biggest loser among all this as online sales are surging and Costco does not have the scale and warehousing/DC efficiencies that Walmart and Amazon posses..Costco is toooo old school, they don't have tech such as Robotics, IOT, Hydrogen fuel cells, AI in their warehouse/DC chains to make online sales efficient and fast...Retail stores will not cut it and they stand to lose a lot of their customers who will be converted to online sales forever after recent experiences..."
"What a disaster, over the course of a year, it did nothing. So much for costco, it's a bum stock now."
Going green quick shorts are going to be hurting badly very soon
Man those people who work at Costco are stupid. The cashiers are brain dead drones and the cart pushers outside are utter morons. They have legions of idiots working for them for a paltry $14 an hr. That is why I am an investor.
Why is Costco down?
Look for BLOW OUT numbers soon !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Buy 158.00-159.0000000000000000Cramer said its a BBBUUUUYYYYYYway too cheap here.
the whole market is over valued now... small trigger will bring it down 5-10% in a few days... Be very careful here...
PELOSI having breathing issues with her speech.
"Has anyone ever had food shipped? Not all products show up nicely packed, only light items ship well."
Road to $250 Continues.
"Stock should be up $5 not down $1.2, it just goes to show how phony this market is."
Crushed it
"bend over. in 5-10 years, AMZN will put COST out of business. Everything COST offers you will get delivered to your doorstep in an hour by AMZN. Cheaper too."
Target dropping hard on mixed performance. Costco is next.
"Amazon thrives = Costco dies think Macy's, Kroger, Sears and all big box"
TRUMP TARD and POWELL is a perfect combination for RECESSION
The govt cannot track down every individual that has the virus because it takes a lot of time and money so it will definitely spread throughout the US.
Chinese smarter than Trump-again
Jeff Bezos is laughing about Costco stock falling and the next thing he will announce will be used cars with no haggle. He is already doing that in Europe.
choo choooo tran! I mean train!
COST takes it to the chin today. I think it is no respect at all for the stock. Big chunk of the call Dec 16 makes me nervous why not Dec 9.
Still can’t believe I dumped all my shares at $290 when the pandemic started rolling.. I’m an idiot. Feel free to tar and feather.
COST & AAPL just buy and hold here.............................
Punk faces thinking the stock may drop. no wonder ur poor
Bonehead OPP downgraded COST but upped the price to 300. Why investors still listen to this bonehead.
bad report not good
Hairbag. I am here to make money.
"let's push thru that 52-week high...come on ""preppers""!! i'm a prepper, you're a prepper, wouldn't ya like to be a prepper too!"
Most overvalued retail stock. Should be trading at a PE of not more than 18. I'll be a buyer at around 100
Recollect Costco was run by an elderly Sr citizen as CEO. Doesn't look like any more. Called them & found out they have reserved JUST TWO hrs per week for elderly to go there & shop. Tuesdays & Thursdays from 8 - 9.00 Am! Very thoughtful & Considerate? JUST DISGUSTING!
"I think COST's fair value should be around $135. I come up with this number based on comparing both forward P/E of WMT versus COST. COST is 23.92 and WMT is 16.6. Therefore, based on this matrix COST should be around $135*16.6/23.92=$106.16. However, COST has a better profitability than WMT. Therefore, a premium should be paid for the stock based on its profitability advantage which can be calculated from Return of Equity (ttm). COST's ROE is 23.41% while that for WMT is 18.49% which means COST is about 26.6% better based on profitability. Therefore, COST price with profitability premium should be $"
Needs to drop another 75-100 points before reaching fair value.
Was there a downgrade?
GAMES being played to drive this down..... But it won't stay there
tom..quit pumping this stock
oh no..Mr. Bill
This hasn't collapsed in 20 years
Was hoping it keeps dropping so i can add more
Dump it from this peak!
"Unbelievable, I got COST Oct 04, call 300 so cheap. I bet that COST will beat the estimate again."
waiting for pullback into 190s
dividend goes into effect dec. 2..people are gunna buy like crazy until the
"With a PE over 30 for a glorified grocery store, no thanks."
This just makes no sense..
Buying on weakness.......................................let the manipulation begin!
Obesity in America is caused by Costco. Massive packages of food that people struggle to eat before it is rancid.
Where my 10 dollar special divident.
This thing moves like molasses
GET OUT $165 tomorrow
typical Monday..stocks crashing
guys! e w l l deal has been signed! theoretical stock price floor is .25 buy it up!
"I tried telling everyone here a LONG TIME AGO that everything under Donald Trump is 'artificial' and that means this market has been artificially inflated now for 3 years! There was never anything of substance underneath to prop it up. So, now we see 3 years worth of Trump #$%$ wiped-out and back to square one. The man is a LOSER in everything he does in life. He knows absolutely nothing about business, how to develop it, how to run it or how to profit from it. He is mentally ill and is in dire need of professional help. His claim to fame is 'pretending'.For those of you who believe he is a 'billionaire', guess again. If he has (on paper) $2 billion, then he OWES others $4 billion. That is not a billionaire. He's a fake and everything that flows from him is also fake."
And we're off to the races!!
thank you for298.00
https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/13/a-morgan-stanley-reading-on-the-economy-collapses-by-the-most-ever.htmlNice spike into close....weird action in ALL the XLP stocks.........I still say retail sales are weak tomorrow!! I have July 260 PUTS.....so I have time....and NO RATE CUT NEXT WEEK.....that should get rid of the crazy safety plays.
Who moved my Pimento Cheese?
"costco,,,,wow,,how weak of a company stock can it suddenly be,,whats going on,,amazon is not the reason,, who is really shorting this and trying to get everyone out"
"this stock trades in a manipulated weird way,,,,,,,not really normal the pattern,,seems to just and fall on nothing,,,tells me MM are manipulating trades"
TOMORROW PREMARKET WILL OPEN NORTH OF $17
Nice close !
$135 is critical.
this stock dropped $7 today
"I used to brag about costco, how great it was...to be honest..im embarrassed now, this has been the greatest disappointment...never saw this coming"

costblo sells old stale products.
Costco Christmas sales FTW!
I love my Cost and my DZSI. Two huge winners

Man... RH really costing me some $COST!
$358 two weeks ago
INSTITUTIONS are back buying..........................
question...are there certain days shorts can short a stock? it seems some days are worse then others..shorting should be illegal in my opinion
"Ballsack/hairbag on mute, :-) , too much nonsense daily from it."
"Any person or entity or analyst send out negative news, if they are shorting the stock, anyone broadcast bad news and short/buying the stocks , or tell the friends to buy/ short - Should be prosecuted especially someone is paying them to do so! It's hard to prove but the SEC should monitor them!"
"It is beat but not enough ,, only 3% surprise on EPS and 1.5% surprise on REV= Mediocre beat"
Hope Costco puts signs up for all those people buying push carts full of water and bleach and toilet paper that those are unreturnable
"BOYCOTT AMAZON. NOW WITH A PHYSICAL STORE THEY CAN START DOING PHARMA, ETC. BOYCOTT THEM."
Look for the CYBER dips here ...............................................................buyer under 292.00
"Grimbelina, get your finger out of your bum,. get the other hand out of your pocket and you just might be able to spell and type to cobble together a coherent sentence.I don't hate stupid people, Grimbelina, in fact I find you mildly amusing.Now, erase this post. Good boy."
don't mind competition. But I can remember when Walmart was the evil behemoth. Amazon is becoming the new job killer. I own Amazon but ...I love Costco. cant see why it's dropping like this.I'll buy some more
Still searching for income producing stocks? I have found a site that gives stock picks every week and some of them are pretty darn good. Check them out at the*stock-dork .
Back to 180 next week! Let the bears go running 
Don't understand at all why COST down this big even though PE is high.
"If it breaks 189, I shorting more because the next stop will be 173"
To me. Due to intensive competition between AMZN and other retailers. They should all go down. Even AMZN should go down..But that is just me.
"bullish uptrend, buy on any dips here..........................."
why the premarket panic?
Overreacting to vaccine ..... And Kramer’s annoying mouth
Costco is for old people. All young people and families buy everything from Amazon for convenience - they don't have to battle traffic and waste time.
AMAZON go baby go.
Parking must be a nightmare
Buy today .
COST will be back! Check out these stocks.....PCTL.....ATDS.....IQST.....VRUS.....BBRW
LakeErieMonster..why do you think you're cool? Who told you and why did you believe them
Yes keep going down! Gonna buy at 142
We all saw how STZ reacted today. Up ^ Up ^ Up ^
BUYING AS MANY SHARES THIS LEVEL AS POSSIBLE THIS WILL GO TO $390 AND HIGHER
Anyone know why the last minute dump? Weekend beer money?
150 closing...
I love how idiots are selling this off 
Hey Jeff Bezo! You have to save the real Amazon that bears your company name! Do it yesterday already! Have some conscience!
This always happens when Costco reports. It goes down a little then up significantly.
timmmmmber................................200.00
Costco announced that it can withstand a trade war. And I am feel good about $COST 's sales and expansion strategies. I think its stock price is still undervalued. https://www.finstead.com/posts/COST-buy-or-sell
COST buying time for me!
"Orange man should be tweeting something soon, like China talks very promising, then all stocks jump back up n Orange man boiler room friends make mucho $$$$"
What? Who sold at $305.65 in the AH?
I have been investor in MKC since 2019. what do you guys think about Corona virus effecting the stock?
I heard COSTO is opening in China. How does all this trade war tarriffs effect this company?
"Still short, cover at 260 or less"
What happen after hour?Did I miss anything?
pre market crash
"I love Costco and have been long the stock. But they are tripping over themselves day after day. Low levels of important products and no sourcing. There's no selection of computers, sanitizing wipes or other PPE. Manager are hogging the sanitizing wipes for their own stores. Totally fumbling the ball in many ways. Incompetency blamed on the corona virus. I blame the CEO who could have had a plan to increase sales during the pandemic, instead hundreds of millions in sales were lost which explains why Costco if underperforming nearly every other front line retailer. Amazon, Walmart and Target are killing it, costco is fumbling. Sad, very sad."
SELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL now buy back under 200.00
"Good riddens, and don't let the door kick you in the tush Warren. Now Costco can keep going up and well above $400 after your charades of selling over past months leaving share holders confused by your mistakable leave. Suck it up ol boy, you lost out.."
Traders are playing with you....trying to draw you in.
This is typical...it runs up before earnings....we get a great report....idiots sell on the news...firms upgrade the stock...we go up until next earnings report. Repeat.
Was hitting $300 then the orange traitor opened his lying mouth
I see the Wall Street Shemales are dumping for profits. Some things never change.
I really really love that drop.
"obviously this is a stock that is severely over rated, and oversold..clearly"
Huge miss
Way Overbought. Will visit 200 this year
The Trumpanzees are up early today. Dow down 1400 in a week. Mass murder body count almost 40 last week. Now the orange pedo announces a Toledo mass shooting that never happened. He’s done!
"seems this stock gets to 160,,,gets shorted very hard back to 150 then they slowly go back to 160,,,well i am out now,,waiting to see if its shorted back to 150 then i will buy again"
Stock is acting poorly.
I hope it goes down because I'd like to get in at lower levels
"Come on Costco !!! 4 billion dollars in profit? No wonder your stock is down. No one wants profits. Call yourself a tech company, post financial losses on hardly no sales, and make ridiculous promises, and have the hedge funds manipulate your stock up on misleading headlines and control trades. 4 billion dollars in record profit. THIS IS A SCREAMING SHORT !!!!"
g - exactly! We have been had!
Still selloff with huge volume. Likely more selloff ahead. Looks like not reaching a short term bottom yet.
sooooo whats the ex date for special div???
stock sux lately
BOYCOTT AMAZON
people are so quick to freak out. it is possible that both COST and AMZN can thrive together. COST caters to different needs than AMZN. go visit a Costco and see for yourself.
Where are you hooya??????
Red to Green! Go green baby!
Short sellers trying to scare retails.
People already stocked their stuff and won’t buy anything for awhile so COST WMT AMZN are not doing anything today
Crashing at the close - another down day.
Why is it down lol
sold 244.73
Alibaba may buy out Costco Wholesale for $200 a share! Baba wants to be competitive with Amazon!
Must be selling some good dope.
"a predatory amazon strategy is still in effect. AMZN sells goods cheaper than anyone else do not making any profit but slowly swallowing the whole industry. Some ""investors"" behind AMZN back are paying for everything. Those ""investors' are super-deep pocket players, likely connected to the highest financial elite (otherwise you are unable to understand AMZN valuation that exceeds any reasonable digits in a factor of x25-30). According to fundamentals AMZN right price is $30."
"I can see Amazon hurting Grocers butWhy is Whole Food acquisition such a threat to Costco?Is Amazon planning to do any of the following ?Change TiresSell Cheap GasSell ClothesSell Electronics and PhonesSell FurnitureSell Toilet PaperSell wines Sell Appliances.,,"
this right where I bought in at in Feb....so in 4 months I've gone nowhere
"ST will be anywhere between $130 to $180 by Eoy, guaranteed...bet accordingly."
Its a STEAL HERE folks..........................................
With all that's going on I would say they hit it out of the park. The W.$ Gansters at it again!
Swinging
Why in the world would anybody short a 154+ stock in a prime best of breed company? I sold high today and bought back more. Amazon is not the one I want buying my food and sending it to my home. Amazon pays slave wages and would you like someone making 10-12 bucks an hour buying and properly taking care of your food that you feed your kids or yourself. I go to Publix or Costco to buy my own food.
lets see i got 100 comtract puts 152.5 for average 0.10if it tanks to 155 my puts worth 3K
"I would like to see company buy back shares,"
I told you it will tank today and no one believe me
"Been holding COST for over 19 yrs, always bounces back..........................................."
Costco's customers have been shopping side by side with Wholefoods for YEARS and Costco has remained profitable. Amazon won't be changing that anytime soon. Costco's customer base is solid and they actually ENJOY their shopping trips. FANTASTIC BUYING OPPORTUNITY!! 167.40 and I'm IN BIG!
Membership numbers all that matter
Anyone know the guidance
"Bought some today. Look at 5 year chart and sentiment is too negative. may go a little lower, may buy a little more but Im comfortable here starting a psn"
Shorts covering?? Feel free to short again at 180
"FredMeyer (KR)' parking lot are full, too. It don matta. stock going down anyway..KR is cheaper than COST.. COST is in low margin business. One slip in competition, COST is going down big.PE of 27 still too expensive."
LONG NOW
"This overreaction to cost is a huge buying opportunity. Costco buyers are not going away. Their shares will rebound and if you have bought, during this craziness, you will be way ahead. Markets behave like this from time to time. Costco is a fabulous investment and will reap great benefits in price when this craziness is over."
no rate cut ...thanx ..all market low bcoz of fomc today ....
Paying extra 2.00 hour to employees hurts bottom line...ridiculous
If Costco is down like that you know what rest of market will do?
Costco has warned shoppers that prices will go up due to China trade. Is this something to be concerned about? Serious comments please.
ONLY 900K SHARES TRADED STILL GOT OVER 1 MILLION MORE TO GO MIGHT BE BUYING LAST 1 MILLION SHARES
ONCEE ABOVE $348 HIGHER U GO MAKE NEW HIGHS
Unbelievable. Watching Costco stock for the last week has me thinking now it may just go to 0.
Look for the SILLY dips as a BUY here...................................
cant get ahead in this stock!..a few weeks ago it had some nice spukes..only to crash back down...wmt is the better but
CRAMER said to BUY before earnings ....................................what a CLOWN.....................thanks for the tip...............................
Thoughts on price for EoY
"Cash-out your gain and run! Giant UK Tesco supermarket did that before and failed miserably after rent, tax and running cost with empty shop. The Asians always like to ry new thing-especially America products- regardless the cost, then walking down the street the next day to find the same Made in China things for half the price and they stop going to Costco."
Sold into the close for a gain of $45 dollars.
BUY BUY MORE AS IT DROPS MORE OPPORTUNITY TO ADD HELL YEAH
Costco ouch
"What Costco really needs to do to re-ignite its growth engine is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for Costo (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if Costo just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

Awesome price. I might be able to get back into Costco!
What happens now?
People are taking profit today from COST AMZN AAPL NFLX BABA NDVA ???
is the earnings better or not better than expected?
Poor performance after buyback and dividend increase. Stock looks like its topping.
"People who are selling COST are morons, period."
35.40 vs 35.67B on revs
Hold above 296
"COSTCO is dying! I just came from my local Costco and I only had 2 people ahead of me at the register, on a Saturday afternoon?! IMO I am following Jim Cramers idea of physically going to places and see if FOOT traffic still exists for that particular company."
LB was a great company too.. Stock is now half of the price.. Yes cheaper than COST>
Like I said.....red.
"QUALITY (TOP GRADE). Pull back is on the NORMAL TREND........Back & Fill ..................HIGH SHARE PRICE 183.00, PULL BACK NORMAL............"
A down day and there is a bunch of bearishness. They will fix any computer glitches.
"Anybody else getting impatient with this stock? I really thought $170 would be here by now. I'm not particularly a ""Trader"" but I see other opportunities out there where my money would do more work."
goin back to $300 after earnings collapse
"its Friday, are we having a sell off? like usual,?"
COST successfully erased all gains today for an entire calendar year. And you Kirkland junkies say it’s great! Wake up!!!!
COST is down 5.78% to 280.23
Special div is probably holding the stock up.
Good guys keep it up. keep the selling values above 298
SHORT COSTCO
Buy BJ !
"big , that is one good post . keeping them up to date with honest information ."
I told you
wait for 165.00
Looking for some of the best stock picks on the market? You need to go https://shr.link/Beststockalerts right now then!
"Costco ,makes billions on their membership fees and will do so forever,, Amazon will not take them down at all,, but the analyst can make a stock zero because they all are shorting it and telling no one to buy now,, so this is wall streets scam"
stock needs to be cut in half
have my buy order 165.00
"take advdantageto buy Csostco while others are selling a great company. Their profits will continue. People buy in bult at Costco. When this nonsense blows over, the buying oppportuniy will disappear."
SHould I sell or buy more
She’s going down
Costco up ah that's all the help of coronavirus... umhh... I wonder if costco has anything to do with corona... I personally saw corona at costco today.
"Over 320,000 shares sold at close for 291.90."
SHORTS gonna get Burned ...........................
$155 is critical.
"wow,,,235 to 192 in 2 weeks,,,amazing how this world of stocks has ended"
I'm agreeing with hairbag..$300 here we come
When do their monthly sales figures come out?
LOOK for theDIPS.
Looks like $142 is on the way. That was the low set back on Nov 4th of 2016. I will add if it gets to $145.
nothing to sell with no goods coming out of China
Here come theBUYERS....................................
The lines started at 4:00am at my local Wholefoods so that they could get their kale and avocados.
This is getting crushed today.
good bad?
Even good numbers and guidance won’t shoot this up today. A lot of their numbers are baked in. I’m a buyer at $290 tomorrow.
Anyone invested in COST between now and ER will have a smile on his / her face
I guess they ran out of toilet paper￼
"Wow, I guess you can't fight the tape. I am out. I will wait until the funds get done dumping and then I will be back."
Its on SALE.....................its a steal..........................................
"I'm amazed at the idiots that posted here about not wearing a mask. The mask is not to protect you, it is to protect others , including the employees, from the idiots!"
I have to wonder if the orange guy has a big interest in a market boiler room!
China
China costs going to hurt. I think trading down to 180-190 soon
Order dominos stay away from the breeding grounds of stores! Governors tell you stay away from groups of 10 but when you enter any store theirs 50 deep in each isle.
I knew it..WMT IS A BETTER BUY
HAHAHAHAH
any chance of splits?
$200-$220 by December - Smart money will be rotating to consumer defensive stocks till the end of the year like Costco to protect their gains without being completely on the sidelines.
one of the most overpriced stocks given growth rates
if Walmart buys Costco I'll quit being a Costco customer I wouldn't go into Walmart for all the tea in China
Alibaba Venture Capitalists are buying COST shares aggressively now! The shorts better cover positions asap!
"We will end up today in my opinion I see a lot of growth still in costco , people might think they are late to the game when it comes to the cloud and technology but guess again. If you are a member that have everything about you, if by chance they have a recall on a food product they know you purchased that product and will call you and send you an e mail . Folks Costco is legit !!"
How the heck does target and walmart beat and not costco??? hahah
"Expect a technical bounce back to 212 some times next week, that will be a good opportunity to get out because the fall from there will not be pretty"
Sucks the market is rolling over. PANW did the same thing. Crushed earnings & slowly bled out the next day. See the same thing happening here.
does it really pay to be a long in a stock anymore..doednt seem like it
"I am appalled at the naive people on this board. Costco is a great company but Amazon as already taken down some great companies like Nordstrom and Macy's and Borders. Amazon cuts prices and they won't care if they make money on food or not, because the part of their business which subsidizes the rest is the cloud (AWS). Actually, Amazon loses $11 on average per Prime member--just to get their business and loyalty and the AWS part makes up the loss. If you don't BOYCOTT AMAZON, YOU ABSOLUTLELY DESERVE TO LOSE MONEY ON COSTCO STOCK."
Indicators showing a market correction is on the way!
"MM""s setting up for357.00-358.00"
I believe the basics are changing I'm now looking for the fire escape.
"This drop represent only 1% of outstanding shares after removing traders who are playing with the stock. So, it is meaningless and the stock will be over $165 by next few days."
Earnings blew the doors of the Analyst who give them high grades already! AH is some kind of big dogs jerking around because it will be going much much higher!Possibly a shaking by large firm wanting lots more shares?
305 support
this action is ridiculous...
The Fix was in. Cramer and MM'S knew.
"costco,,,weak again in a huge bull market,,,stop shopping and buy stock"
"These after hours trades are done by scared traders and shorts. Those who buy now, they see a nice profit."
"LOL!!! Funue is just pretending and Bert decided to just run away! (Clearly, Bert was the smart one!)[Amazing - the world of chat board pretend stock traders. Every board has 'em.]"
sad weekend for COSTLY. I predict 140 by Friday..........7/8.............99 year end
You shorts are greedy man... company is still showing growth and you guys think it should take because a little miss? You might win some $ but it won't be much
bye bye costblow.
waiting on guidance
20K SHORTED
"Rocktober sale's were ""ok"" 10.2 Billion a 10.1% increase from similar period last year First 8 weeks of fiscal 2018 an increase of 11.3% from first 8 weeks fiscal 2017. e-commerce sales up nearly a third."
"This is not affected by the riots/looting, but how come it is not rising?"
You guys should be buying instead of whining.
I want to hear Nathan on mad money talk about how he bought put at like 186 saying it was over extended haha lose that money kidddd
Ruh Roh
for is Trading 25 below buyout price
"I will sell all of my shares today.This is turning to a garbage stock. With all the major index up, cost has been down 2 weeks in a row. I am out."
"Tomorrow the monthly sales number will be better than last month. May be it is the time to pay back. The Whole Food deal is overblown, may be the big boys just scare traders so they can get COST cheap."
"If you are not BOYCOTTING AMAZON, you (unfortunatley) deserve the pain costco stock is going through. I don't want anyone losing money in this world. It is better if everyone does well for the health of the individual ad the country,, but don't be naive about Amazon. They are out to kill everyone. Costco will be in the crosshairs."
A great day at Costco. They are limiting purchases and store racks are well stocked. Lines were only 8 people deep today. Great supply chain efforts! Proud to see what they have done to meet demand.
"Amazon is nothing more than the brick and mortar ""Five and Dime"" I used to visit as a child. Sorry, most of the stuff on Amazon is somebody else's unwanted garbage and oh let's talk about the generous less than 30 day return policy."
Pompouspeo milking his position for all it's worth - going on the grand international tour on taxpayer's dime before getting his fat #$%$ thrown out of the State Department. But we can all take comfort knowing that Jerkimus Orange contributed a grand total of $750 to the trip.
Must be those damn gas stations! Cheers to Costco!
the sell off was a GOLDEN opportunity to BBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUYYYYYYY
this will go away
"Getting my EBT check in a couple of days. Then after I overfill my shopping cart, I’m gonna demand I get boxes from those loser cashiers."

GOD DAMNIT! PRINTING AT $285 RIGHT NOW! MY FNNNKING CALLS ARE WORTHLESS!
"Blow thru $152 and go to $153....fast, no change for shorts to cover....then straight to $155 close at high of the day"
Time to buy puts!!! Loading up.
Ridiculous. giving the divident is like a communist gov is giving people rations but takes twice more in tax from you.
Just muted Tom. Who else?
Covid expenses again

Price is too high for a wholesale retail.
TA broken. Fvckamentally too expensive ..
Headed back to $250

Ridiculous price action today
Pay $15 more to 'buy' a $10 dividend = JUST NUTS
COST is at 163 it looks like the real deal

This pig is going to drop- it ain’t amzn and it I el dropping because cost will be done 30
Can this price go down some more?
"Take advantage of the SILLY dips........................370""sssssssssssssssssssssssssss"
"Go Costco, you're 220 by the end of the day!!!"
The home delivery  service so called contributed to the stock being downward .
"WHAT A JOKE THIS STOCK IS NOW BECOMING,,,NO STABILITY TO COSTCO ANYMORE AT ALL,,ITS BECOMING A SHORTS FAVORITE STOCK TO TAKE DOWN SINCE NO SUPPORT IS HERE ANYMORE, market up again and COST falls big,, down from 162 to 156 in a day on a positive market,,,tells you no buyers yet all shorts and sellers"
up nice today...tomorrow down big..
"From the Motley Fool article on Costco's purchase of delivery service ""Costco relayed on Monday that it will fund the acquisition using existing cash on hand, which at last count stood at roughly $8 billion."" Sounds like it is time for a special dividend with all that cash!"
TRUMP better change his TUNE ON TRADE....................................market meltdown.......................... RECESSION
Thanks for the silly dips yesterday299.80
"unreal how manipulated costco shares are ,,these MM are hyping the runs then dropping it on 300 share volume,,,major scam by these MM,,"
"Yahoo is censoring the story about how Costco dropped a vendor for saying anything REAL about the truth about BLM, such liars all"
This is where they start to cover...buy it up
SALES are AMAZINGLY HIGH.........................................says CEO..................................... BUFFET a buyer !
Any long term holders have an opinion on upcoming earnings? Too late to buy? GLTA
Back in the REDNO special Divi.
Rsi under 30 way over sold here buy it up fellas
Yes we are in a recession and everything will go down. If you think increased sales from the past 3 weeks due to panic buying you shouldn’t be giving predictions to buy. Short term observations of lines at the store does not translate into this stock will break 300. WE ARE IN A RECESSION people. Don’t be a fool and buy at this price.
"I think a big correction in the stock market is around the corner and a 10% will hurt a lot of investors, I sold this morning because the market is at it final stage of falling. ....So be very careful in dealing with this casino....."
up $10..sell today
"You did it again Ronald Duck/orange man, tweets the concern of China 70 BD and need to hold of on tariffs, ain't that nice!Now the boiler room can push the market again, nice tweet, and America is good again and the boiler room too."
Market gets break as Cost punishment for a penny off from earnings stays.What #$%$!!!!
Giving Costco one more day to get it together....I have way to much money invested here and there is money to be made out there
"this is why for the most part i trade...they manipulate price too much,,, but am holding this one till we see 165"
government is panicking about coronavirus and cut rates. they know it's going to get bad

"First there is Costco, a discount food store and then there is Whole food a high end food store that doesn't carry regular flour. These two stores don't even carry the same products!!! How in the world is Costco affected by Amazons purchase of Whole Food. Good chance there will be interference and the buy out might not happen. Not done till the Fat Lady Sings!!!"
I would like a 2-1 split or a 3-1 split but idk if they would do it anytime soon
"""84 million card-carrying members""? how does that compare to Sam's? https://finance.yahoo.com/m/865db24b-1fcc-3003-8149-14ab63f70988/12-secrets-costco-shoppers.html"
worst stock on the planet right now...bleeding endlessly
"Motley fools , Jim cramer, they both put buy and hold rating on costco, most trusted recession proof company."
"Any company that sells with the quality of Costco, and also treats their employees decently compared to most other on-line and brick-and-mortar retailers, will thrive."
The recession has already begun... those of you who keep saying 'no recession' are simply in denial.
looks like down tomorrow again
Its a cruel world in retail these days. Shoot and ask questions later
180's possible bottom
No reason to panic but us shareholders appreciate it.
This negative reaction in after hours is beyond my comprehension. I thought the earnings call went very well. I just don't understand these haters saying that the beat wasn't good enough. A beat is a win in my book and a very positive thing.
not much of a beat but red just bc of profit takers for now
"just accumulated more. whenever happens, Costco is there"
HUGE BEAT! Congratulations to all longs!!!
Adding more to my positions on these unrelated dips.
"This security on it's way down to fill gap at 270.92 --- 272.70 from August 15th 2019, will be very swift getting to that price, most likely in the next 5 days."
insane how much Costco is crushing...

Hairbag is right unless it pulls a Nike and has big beat I doubt it
I just bought 2 crumb cakes for $1.97 each. Where can you get that at AMZN.
Love this stock!!!
I hope U guys know that a vote for Biden is REALLY a vote for Kamala Harris. Biden will be forced out because he has Dementia. Then Kamala comesin and the country is DONE. She's a communist.
"my wish is where is costco to defend its company when its drops from 180 to 150... i am concerned that no one says anything,,,"
WHEN YOU INCREASE MEMBERSHIP FEE...THIS IS A STARK FEE. BETTER TO REFLECT IT IN THE INVENTORY BY .50 CENTS OR SO.... MEMBERSHIP IS GLARING. IF THATS HOW THIS COMPANY IS SURVIVING THEN WE'RE IN TROUBLE.
$300 here we come
Short now
Bag holders stock
Costco price target slashed from JP Morgan. This is going back to 200$.
"Grimmikins, old sock, old shoe.......you still ""loving that drop"" what with the $7 special dividend and the $3 rise today? C'mon, Grimmikins, if you're man enough to ""do my wife"", ""do Fonz's wife"" and who know how many more imaginary conquests, don't you think you'd be able to man up and let us know all about the $113 short of COST you claimed to have made but absolutely refuse to talk about? Nah, didn't think so. Sailor-suited, Mommy-moochin' sissy.............."
"Stupid people sell, Smart people buy!"
"Why would any1 sell COST is beyond me, this will bounce back to $180 by next week ."
adobe is swinging
bet these guys have trump dolls and sleep with them at night
It may looks like eke iut of gain today.
DO NOT LISTEN to Markets !just buy on the DIPS..........................................
another corrupt big corporation giving money to terrorist groups
"Shorts gonna get BURNED ,as usual."
this was at $170 last month! what a crazy market.
"The last time an analyst criticized Costco for paying their employees too much was in May 2007 so I sold all my stock in the company that day and bought a boat. My reasoning was that the analyst was a 20 something that couldn't find his butt with both hands and if a company is letting people that ignorant run important things, that company wouldn't be around long. Eighteen months later that company sold itself for almost nothing to Bank of America in a government brokered deal. Yep, that was Merrill Lynch's Costco analyst. The moral of the story is the analyst has an ulterior motive and could also be intellectually challenged and understands nothing except what the Harvard airline case study told him. Which will you do better with, Costco stock or a 25 year old analyst's opinion, that's the decision. I have no vested interest in Costco stock."
The costco stores smell disgusting like used tires and auto mechanics when you walk out from the register. It's very unhealthy to breathe it.
Sigh. Going down slowly again.../
Expect a pop and drop
"AMZN has no affect on COST's sales. AMZN only hurts the small grocery store like KR, SFM,Trader's Joe. Let's how the traders will react to the number. COST will need to spice up by raising payout or split stock."
Glad I don't own this #$%$.ha haha kevinb69.
"the COST will come down some, maybe 5 bucks after Dec 2, but not $10."
s call started? whats going on ? Dividend boost ? buyback ? anything??
"IMO algos jumped on $COST as soon as the words ""Material Weakness"" hit the wire."
Trump to sanction China tomorrow over Hong Kong. Bad news for COST.
COST reached an all time high at 274.27
haha the games they play in after hours... up big tommorow...!!!!!

Down again; GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"The market makers surprisingly control the gap-up nicely, I admire them, because I thought this morning when I see the monthly sales number it should gap up at least 2 points. the number is very impressive even one day sales less."
SHORTED 20K SHARES HELL YEAH
"BJ ten times better investment, the way AMC us undervalued compared to overvalued netflixozark seas 3 not ready yet, altered carbon seas 2 not ready yet, you season 2 not ready yet, what are they doing over at netflix? A lot of money burning for those top three not done. breaking bad movie sucked, the irishmen was depressing etc."
Lackluster jump
it looks like AMZN hit 1000 again...
cant get ahead on this stock..it loses as much as it gasins
do you guys not remember what happened last time
Why up $9 after hours
Keep your eyes on uxin the china vrm and solo electomannica because soon both get a wkhs pop out of nowhere and valuation.
"If costco has PE of 15 like other retailer/stores,, that is $75"
BUFFET says COST real cheap here........................
"costco is throwing people out that refuse to wear face masks. not sure of this will be good for business. its good policy for the virus but not for business. I havent been to costco, walmart or a mall in 1.5 months. Im sure im not the only do the road trips outta town. plus people are buying necessities and not clothes or electronics. food is low margin. I like costco but i dont think it will be a bang out quarter coming up"
Shop-rite has been and is cutting into costblo profits.Shop-rite sell fresh groceries while costblo sell old stale groceries.
too bad ole Warren Buffet gunna miss it
BOYCOTT AMAZON FOR THE HEALTH OF THE NATION.
Wait 199.000000000000000000000000
"COST is not s sexy investment because the management is low profile however the bottom line speaks for itself, opening in China will give the stock a nice bounce"
People still got Thanksgiving hangover! Wait until 12 PM ET to see real action!
Look for silly dips as great entry point.
Why this is down
Shorts with deep pockets controlling this stock since last one week.
"Costco's P/E is 34.xx, FORE!!!"
"Watch, Amazon will come out with some stupid news and drop Costco back down to 150."
This is totally being manipulated by the market makers this morning
$155 good entry point today!
Boycottng Amazon yet?
I don't think the China numbers are included in this report.
this is just manure...
Amazon latest news = OVER Hyped !!!!!
Did they raise the guidance?
didn't see this coming
The market sure seems to like Costco at $300/share
Reckon investors will be happy with 8% earnings growth next year?  $COST https://simplywall.st/NasdaqGS:COST/costco-wholesale
We could close in theGREEN.
"Gotta say....I have NEVER seen strength like this....just INSANE!!!! Even watching PG, WMT and MDLZ.....all just like COST................who in their right mind would pay the extremely valuations here with minimal yields is beyond me? Hope this BS about a trade deal crushes them next week!!!!!!!!."
$100M+
COST is falling like a rock this morning. New downgrades out this AM. Amazon Prime day will have their stores empty this week.
303.00 my nextBUY order..........................................................
PE still too high ..
"ER should be good. My fear is a lot of people will seek off after hours, but I hope not."
slap my test icles!
COST + WALMART = a great way to kill these shorts.
Price should be cut in half unable to deliver timely small parcel deliveries.
Costco can't grow...if you can't grow over time... there is a high risk you get outgrew by someone else
"Tug of War, between BULLs and bear."
Under 250 coming. For no Good reason.
COST targets increased !!!!!!180.00
Monthly Sales will be over 6-8% again. Let's see that how the market will react. I just bet COST only tomorrow both monthly sales and earnings report. I BELIEVE IN COST.

DTRAIN: I’m long into earnings .  oh boy
SELL AND SHORT TILL IT GETS TO 324
"Time to load more shares. The drop is just temporarily as profit taking or funds reallocated by the money managers. As the dirt settles, the rain stops and the sky will be blue again. Costco businesses are amazing as customers continue to go there."
US economy continues toEXPAND !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! COST is considered cheap here.jmho

Sell people sell so I can buy your shares cheap.

"not sure why guys like Tom think this is a great stock? it's really not, I think it's at its peak..it has its spikes..but the very next day the spike is given back..were stuck @$295-300...and that's it"
It behaved like somebody either have hold put option or sold calls and needs this to stay low. Interesting to observe to see how long he can do this.

I keep reading about a special dividend...its not going to happen ok
"No food court, no samples, get in, get out feeling won't help store sales. Used to love Costco, Time will tell."

"amazon entering the pharmacy area,,bye bye pharmacy business in stores in the future,,"
STOCK HAS DROPPED 40 POINTS IN 3 WEEKS. I'M PSYCHED !
"I’m an amazon shopper all the way. But the experience is different when shopping at Costco. There is room for both. Costco is a great company, and now being sold at a discount :) And it’s based on overreaction, not fundamentals."
"which is it,,,is costco too high or too low,,,,, they claim in the stupid article its over valued"
I have Costco membebship. but I found myself shopping more at FredMeier (part of KR) If KR pe is only 12..I don't see why COST deserves PE of 27
"TOLD YA,....SELL it NOW!!!!!!!"
"BUY THIS DIP FOLKS , GO LONG !!!!"
Brandon Fletcher = BAD MAN

"easy money, just buy at 280"

Headed to 200 at the close.
Who actually sell this stock lol some dumb people out there
Time to raise the price of hot dogs...
"Costco is a great company. If you like your portfolio of great companies, BOYCOTT AMAZON. Prime is automatically renewed if you don't stop it. Amazon gets away without having to show much of a profit because they are a growth company. Lots of companies will be hurt with Amazon getting into groceries---the food stocks--because Amazon will eventually have store brands, drug stores because they will have a pharmacy which Whole Foods doesn't have now, grocery stores, retail stores and in Europe, Amazon has checked out getting into used cars. It is time to BOYCOTT AMAZON. i WON'T BE BUYING ANYTHING FROM THEM."
Where's the bottom? When is everyone jumping back on?
Loading up on this dump...
"Up $2 yesterday down $2 today, wupdeedo."
So like is $201 still game?
Going green now
Costco will go down some more... Around $90-100 per share.... May be lower...
BUY these silly dips here................... COST has a great balance sheet with cash to take on this virus !
GOD DAMNIT I AM NVER LISTWNING TO THOSE PAMPERS ON SROCJRWITS!
Trump looking at removing TARIFFS for now.
Jump back in at 215This is over valued and it will tank hard
I don't understand how the heck Costco stock keep dropping when every Costco everythings are sold.istock should go up.
Will it go down to $100 per share?
"Say what you want but I just got back from my local Costco and it was packed as usual...yeah Amazon cuts into some things but produce,meats, fish, bakery etc most people want to see it before they buy it ...and at Costco they have great items at a good price...so my own feeling is that Costco will be just fine going forward...this is a good change to get more shares."
They got rid of Polish hotdog at food court...and customers are cancelling their memberships like crazy! Sell sell sell!
sams just discontinued the only item that kept me going there.. now i will only shop at Costco....
TRUMP taking the USA into RECESSION with his trade wars.................................
Might get to $90? I see that is stopped growing ... esp. membership
"With all the profits Costco is making, a special dividend is due. The curent yield is .99% very low"
this stock is sick. money would be better off put into a tech stock for a rallying ride today.

I TOLD YOU SO. COST CAN NOT BE THAT CHEAP!
Tekashi 6ix9ine loves Costco!
Good or bad earnings it’ll still tank

I think them days of $10-$20 a day spikes are history
COST reached an all time high at 291.61
Why its down today?
"Well, well, well, my little sailor-suited, mommy-moochin', Dunkin'-slurpin', tough-talkin', ShopRite-greetin', south of France-dwellin', bathtub ""yacht""-commandin' illiterate DumDum is still going on about how he's ""doing"" everyone's wives. How nouveau, how novel, how original.This coming from a failed little fella who's last date was with his Momma last Mother's Day on their annual outing to Dunkin' for the Grimmikins to get his chocolate milk and his sparkle donut, courtesy of Mom's pension check so that Grimmikins can ogle the hunters.Hey Grimmikins, how come you don't talk about your grand plan, your ""it all came together"" imaginary short of COST at $113? How come you're so happy and ""love that drop"" yesterday from $182 to $180? You do realize how short position works, right?Nah. You've got about as much knowledge of shorting as you do about Mediterranean yacht dwelling and carnal activities with others wives.Stick to your rest stop route, Grimmikins, at least that's real.Sailor-suited Sissy..................."
Covid-19 has a big impact on these retail businesses.

"Mike,Thanks for the reply. It is up more than 25 cents NOW. LOL"
I wish Costco would come to the villages. 150k senior citizens would pack the place
BIDEN was raised inside a closet !
"Whole foods products seem overpriced to me. Not sure their customer service is worth the extra cost. COST on the other hand has fantastic customer service, great prices, full parking lots, and is in the middle of building a new store. I'm sticking with Costco"

"i am buying everything at Costco, none in Amazon, Costco Gas also cheap the other gas station $ .40 a gallon"
Save some CASH buy the dips280'ssssssssssssssssssssss
Why are they paying out anything when their Current Ratio (mrq) is 0.93. For people that don't follow that measure it means their #$%$ liabilities are larger than their current assets. And that is before the dividend. That is a very strange move.
I dont see any hope to this stock
DPW +5% happy trading guys

Bought some @ 157.50next buy 152.10

"whoever sells their shares oh, I'm buying them because I'm in it for the long run and I'll be a freaking billionaire"
"This is really getting hilarious!! Now our mentally ill Dear Leader who says the economy is the strongest it's ever been wants taxes cut again because it didn't work the first time!! According to the Trump School of Economics, it's when the economy is really BAD that you actually increase taxes!! But good or bad, either way it's always someone else's fault... this time it's the FED's fault. He's got to stop making me laugh some much!!But seriously, he is mentally ill. He's just not bright enough to realize it."
"chase it people,,,chase it,,, more buyers needed,,,i need my 170 calls to become worth a ton by friday,,,get buying"

"Road to $250 in a quarter begins, COST bubble is exploding."
How about the Lofty price and p/E of Amazoo?
I should have stayed at DE
Wall Street dummies didn’t even know how to value the stock after Earnings smh
lol shorted 307 thanks UBS/JPmorgan
"Sales flat as Costco is raising prices and fees across the board. As shoppers we are finding better bargains AND cheaper elsewhere, especially vegetables and berries. Breads are as expensive or more so than Safeway. I've had it! Fees, rising prices, have to buy n gross, shtye....."
"Guess Costco fans didn’t want to see Beyond Meat in stores. Tastes like dog food, so hopefully it will stocked in that section. Btw- don’t waste your money on the Dunkin Donuts fake sausage sandwich either, unless you are buying it for your pet!"
this stock will never be much over $300....I think its gunna always linger in the $295-305 dollar range
Sell this garage and buy FCO.V

"Just leaving Costco in Modesto. Judging by overstaffing and zealous checkout (even more than normal) I would say CA Props essentially legalizing theft are taking their toll. I asked Security in passing about levels of theft and they said ""absurdly high"". Which surprised me since they are usually tight lipped. Anyway, I thought I'd blow off steam here. CA sucks, Costco is great but cost of doing biz here is elevated."
"If I'm correct, you can't buy today and get the special dividend, but you can still buy and get the regular dividend, correct?"
THEY TRICK TO SELL COSTCO VERY STRONG
BIDEN having his diaper changed because TRUMP is coming back to White House !

Love that drop.

COST is one of 3 of my worst losing positions.
SHORT THIS U MAKE SOME MONEY
Why is Costco up 1.5% ? Is there a reason or another pump and dump ?
We should thank Buffet for selling. Costco flexing and showing that there's nothing to worry about.
Any thoughts on stock price after earnings are released ?
"I AM ABOUT TO LOSE $40K IF THIS DOESNT GO ABOVE $290 TOMORROW. I HATE YOU ALL!!!…………………./´¯/)………………..,/¯../………………./…./…………./´¯/’…’/´¯¯`·¸………./’/…/…./……./¨¯\……..(‘(…´…´…. ¯~/’…’)………\……………..’…../……….”…\………. _.·´…………\…………..(…………..\………….\"
