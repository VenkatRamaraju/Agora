Recent headlines and conversations for COST
I'm waiting for Trump to call Marshal Law to interrupt the Democratic Primary's forestalling the elections.
Hey shorts - It must be tough to be you right now. But if you think COST will get a one day haircut like NFLX got today FORGET ABOUT IT.
"They beat, earnings was great! This will climb!!"
going down tomorrow. to much bad news in the world. buy in tomorrow
looks like this one's just going sideways for a while
"This is the most losing crowd around. Wenesday you could’ve pick this dog up under 300 and sold today for 308, learn the market."

"I guess a great earnings report means nothing....the employees haftar wonder "" why work so hard"""
I was getting tired of losing all my cash to the markets so I found these guys that produce one solid stock pick a week. So far their plays have been awesome. Just go to the-stockdork .
Dead cat bounce and back below $300

"#$%$,,,everyday this stock drops in the after market,, #$%$ is going on,,,is costco that bad of a company stock now and worthless"
COST & AAPLJust OWN it dont TRADE it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Costco is the perfect blend of a growth stock & dividend payer! I bought and held 300 at 73.99 in 2012 - it’s my best investment Got in and then out of amazon 189 to 1000I’ve been supremely disappointed in prime for at least two years - shipping is shoddy - mistakes galore - I keep having to email bezos to get any satisfaction - I dumped prime and get better shipping results!Love Costco- :)
BUY before you miss out
"I've said this before, I'll say it again..this stock is a $295-305 stock..that's it...it spikes to $310... and then drops"
Up 34 cents . Yippee
"I remember being young out of high-school working at Costco for a while. being in the management office seeing their total sales for the month and profit written on a whiteboard, and what they had to sell to stay positive.swore they were barley breaking even that month I want to say it was like +100,000 profit for a busy canadian costco"
COST is in talk to buy OSTK
I wish I bought more at $352. I hope I get another chance. Was waiting for it to drop under $350 and missed my opportunity. :(
COST is rocketing higher in pre-market to 181. If it had Amazon's P/E ratio it would be selling for over $1500 per share.
"a few months ago costco could shake off a bad day, or a weak earnings report..now it will just crumble."
PUTS will print big tomorrow morning. It will be an amazing day
"as a costco share holder, I am furious of they silly policies allowing certain items to be return. Recently they let a woman returned a Christmas tree well after Christmas. https://www.yahoo.com/news/man-irate-costco-lets-woman-214209983.html"
"easy money, QE buys cost"
"SFIO poised to move 2500% or more. It was taken over for it's stock symbol by a much larger corporation. It's basically a soft IPO and at the price, taking advantage is a no brainier. It's easily a $5.00 stock within the next year."
Going GREEN......................................buyers are coming !
Gonna be a slow recovery
FKFKFKKFFKFK OPTIONS!
"Costco is a terrific company, but CoronaVirus panic buying is the wrong reason to buy COST. This will likely lead to a sales/profit beat in the coming quarter, but will also create a target that can't be best next year."
"ENOUGH WITH THESE HOPEFUL WISHES...'STOCK UP, THANK GOD ITS AT THIS RATE ETC ' OH BROTHER. IF COSTCO HAD MEET EARNINGS"
No special dividend this time. Costco is investing their Trump tax break on their employees!! Other companies should follow their lead. I’m still hopeful on a special dividend payout.
"But they don't seem to have plans to provide delivery or any other services that others such as WMT or AMZN. Yes they have ""buildings and some good locations for the limited market but the chance to be a viable against the two competitors listed will be very difficult for them.My opinion is that they have a ""Nickel & Dime"" management philosophy."
ACTUAL CONVERSATION LAST VISIT: me to register person: I wasn't able to find [I named a particular high end food product] today but my friend said he just purchased it here recently. him: oh not sure I guess we don't have it then you could go stand in line at a desk over there then ask them I guess. me: uh forget it then. him: OKdo people think this is good or bad for the way Costco runs? lolz

$300...Friday sell off day
"A decent report but a pretax charge on Cord-19 was not liked by the Street.Sept 24 (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp ( COST ) reported a 27% jump in quarterly profit on Thursday, boosted by strong demand for foods, electronics and gardening and sporting products during the COVID-19 pandemic.Net income attributable to the company rose to $1.39 billion, or $3.13 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Aug. 30, from nearly $1.10 billion, or $2.47 per share, a year earlier.Total revenue rose to $53.38 billion from about $47.50 billion, exceeding the average expectation of $52.08 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."
If you dont want to wear a mask take a hike.
"#$%$ COSTCO! I LITERALLY DROVE DOWN TO MY CLOSEST COSTCO, TOOK A MASSIVE NUMBER 2 AND DID NOT FLUSH!!!!!!!"
"Do not panic, time to add more!"
Trump haters are socialist who should not own any stocks.
Nonsense reaction to earnings. lol

Middle class loves them hot dogs
"five-star analyst Rupesh Parikh at Oppenheimer ramped up the stock’s price target to $355 (12% upside potential) from $335 and maintained a Buy rating, saying that shares have lagged since the March market lows, but that he sees the potential for a catch up trade from here."
Hair bag power hr looking good today
It's not normal
Under 200 soon. MM'S will take it there. Typical Manipulation
China sold out! America 80% stores sold out great company don’t fool yourself the market will take a dive and Costco will be skyrocketing
TTM sales 178 billion. Market cap 138 billion. PE ratio of ~31. Am I missing something here? I feel the need to load up on calls with this one.
"60K shares at a $cost avg of $1.52... If I pick up another 15K at $1.25, then avg drops to $1.47. 75K is probably the max shares i'm looking to own. I feel pretty confident in that position..."
ty for the cheap shares chumps lol
I hate seeing an annoy voicing their opinion. Costco stock is doing good. Kirkwood brand very good.
"WHY ARE ALMOST THE COMMENTS THEY SAVE IN THE LISTING ALL FAIRLY POSSITIVE ? ""THE STOCK IS A GREAT BUY NOW ETC."" IT'LL BE A GREATER BUY AT 270 TO. BRILLIANT LOGIC. MGT IS NOTDOING ITS PART. SPLIT THE STOCK 4:1 GIVE BACK DIVIDEND. BUY BACK SHARES... FOR STARTERS. THIS STOCK SHOULT BE AT 350 NOT HEADING TOWARDS 300"
Have BUY orders ready........................................
Told you BUY THE SILLY DIPS...................................
"Time to break one way or the other, below 387 and see ya, above 341 and we are money..."
I am selling all shares tomorrow ahead of earnings. Sell on the news is always a trigger for this stock. Will buy back in after the crash
Dont get hopes up. It went flat last time
"clobbered? The whole market was clobbered, lol."
Hmm this company doesn't really care about shareholders.
need some support from fund managers here. decline too long.
I heard late August for the special dividend.
Surprised that there hasn't been a bigger gain since earnings beat.
Come on Costco...give me 321
"does anybody think the dems politicos got the message from the American People: open border, free health care , housing , college , vaccine shots and checks for illegals ( like 30 million of them )"
"Like I said, support is at 189, I’ll keep buying puts till then"
bought 1000 shares
No wonder why Costco sent out the apology letter to all shareholders for lower guidance last week.
should be a good ER
"whats funny,,,,,no ,atter what the stock does someone is always buying and selling,,so it plunges,,,some one scoops it up,,it runs,,,someone chases it"
I like the idea that it has pulled back prior to earnings.
way to go Bob
What does COST have to do with TRUMP tariffs ??????NOTHING absolutely nothing.................................
Last year went to 143 at this same time and went 185. Nothing wrong with that
"The entire market has loudly stated they feel the stock is WAY over value. They aren't relating it to Amazon, the comps speak for that. Sales are flying and Costco has entire states that they have yet to venture to. Not to mention the possibilities overseas. If Costco stops with special dividends every couple of years, and splits the stock like the past, the market will embrace the darling w renewed vigor."
"On the Personal level, I shop locally at COSTCO, once a moon year I shop at Amazon. The Amazon product I bought last year was a solar light, that stopped working in two weeks. Retuning cost was more expansive so I just stopped buy at Amazon. Costco is always for me."
Retail is just out of favor in this money rotation
"Well Grimmikins, you certainly don't disappoint when it comes to displaying your idiocy on this board.I just loved your most recent posts where you say ""Shop Rite is taking Costco's business away"".Tell me, my little sailor-suited sissy, how many Shop Rite stores are there in Canada, Australia, Mexico, Europe, Taiwan, Japan and the UK?You're not content being a ridiculous little man, but feel the need to prove it almost every day.You're doing a great job, Grimbelina."
Slow but steady wins race
Membership numbers up 7% in the middle of a pandemic. Damn good.
They borrowed money to pay the $7 dividend. It is all smoke and mirrors. They have to pay interest on the borrowed money. That make no sense.
"Costco shoppers like myself, are a totally different breed of shopper than WFM shoppers. This merger will not hurt Costco at all in the long run. As for the stock, I bought in bulk on Thursday, and expect it to rise after all the fuss dies down. Nothing to see here..."
"Expert on CNBC news says COSTCO ""is recession proof""! Hmm another reason to own this baby. My grandchildren will thank me."
Great value! Bought more today. Costco is a beast and always will be.
"Costco will have blowout earnings and future guidance will be higher cause everyone is cleaning out the stores to prepare for virus, even my costco barely has anythin"
Did not panic and dump my shares! Will hold through earnings and hopefully the QE and pandemic buying will keep share price up!
What’s the numbers?
I'm not invested in Costco but I don't get why Amzn buying WFM affects this company negatively? I'm a costco member and it's a different shopping experience. Now is Amzn got into physical warehouse shopping game...maybe.
DIVI. increased shorts better cover soon.
Trump walking ALL OVER Sleepy Joe........
Easy easy buy here. No doubt
"Big selloff before the bell, a lot of nervousness for no reason at all..."
300 at open
"From 2012, Costco has paid $19/shr for special dividends. Those special dividends have only marginally helped the stock price. If Costco just used that money to increase the regular dividend, say from 2.00 to 2.20/yr and increase stock buy back, the stock price would go up considerably.Better still, if Costco increases the dividend and announces stock split, the stock price will be over $200 within a week."
Cramerlook for fresh new highs...........................
"listen to Chicken, Cost will pass $300 next week"
"I was waiting for cost to go under 300, the day it did I overslept and missed it. Never smoking that stuff at night anymore!"
only thing im buying are Puts
"Nothing wrong with Costco as a business. Nothing wrong with the model. However, they have a number of lot of high profit stores in South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. Japan has just announced that their entire school system will be closing down for a month. Asians are terrified and are making every effort to minimize their public exposure to potential infection in large areas. Costco, where people sample food, hang out and are so congested that people bump into one another with shopping carts and where lineups are so tight that seniors sneeze all over one another, is probably a store that is experiencing a marked slowdown in Asian traffic.I, myself, am attempting to limit my Costco visits for a bit. The daily mail in the UK reports that 14% of infected persons with coronavirus, after getting better, maintain viral loads in their system. At least 2 confirmed cases in Japan and China are online indicating that persons got sick again after getting better. So, this ain't the ordinary flu bug in terms of its ability to stick in the human body. Costco is fine, but the current macro environment for mass market destinations is not."
Easiest $3 profit in my trading career. I said. $160 before 154 when it was 157. Out. Next trade
collapses to 250 to get its p/e more reasonable
One more minute.
buy costco for raining day
Im concerned that Costco is starting to only stock the items that makes them biggest margins which means im seeing the quality items that are slightly pricier head out door never to appear again and the lower end take that space. For well to do that irks me it may make sense for company as a whole but im shopping in one of their highest end area stores and if trend continues will be a big problem for me. don't want this to turn into a slightly upscaled sams club that would be a disaster. other ominous clouds are their fresh products go bad super fast in my experience. also preprepared foods are awful. again I get it they are kowtowing to lowest common denominator who like huge bulk low price screw the top quality. just not good for me.
Retailers up up up..............................................COST is cheap at these levels.
"President Trump will be mad about Costco opening store in ChinaAlso Chinese president XI will be mad US company CostcoSo, wait for them to restrict Costco somehow.."
What times the report
what is going on here??? I am toast
I keep hearing how store traffic is down..but I'll bet online orders are more
new 52wk soon
Very Bullish on Costco. https://cweb.com/2018/03/16/costco-is-back-and-possible-dividend-ahead-cweb-com/
Look at the quick snap back from today's low! U see.... this will rocket back up in no time! People panic for nothing lol. Long term this is a guarantee bet at these levels. A sure thing!!!
"Undervalued, have you seen the growth?"
"Price drop can only be described as reactionary and RIDICULOUS.Once the frightened sheeple and chickens stop to catch their breath, they're going to realize that the value play here is COSTCO. NOTHING can prevent Costco from going into the next day delivery business on their own or likewise with an eager partner. They already have a ""distribution center"" based network 5x the size of Wholefoods. If anything, COST management are the smart players who will let AMZN charge in and take the risks on redefining the consumers shopping behaviour and if and when successful, there's not doubt in my mind that Costco will follow suit and with a newfound success that can't be replicated by Bezos and Amazon. Blaze the trail Bezos, after you finish digging the roads , bridges and Tunnels, COSTCO will be there just in time to eat your lunch!"
typical costco stock...jumps up nice..then will crash back to $300
"Glad I sold, their 60 -40, Covid-19 vs business"
Getting near 52week high
what a manipulated stock.... wow
"Does the share price drop $10 per share after the Special Dividend is paid, just as a normal quarterly dividend?"
Costco Will Be a Winner as the Economy Reopenshttps://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/21/costco-will-be-a-winner-as-the-economy-reopens.aspx
Looks good for tomorrow. Very small AH trades. 265 PT and they just killed earnings. Small rev miss of 30 mil.. Thats like a month of sales in ONE Store. This stock has been very resilient. It will soar tomorrow morning. 240!
Nike saw a 13% boost after earnings today. I expect at least 10% from costco
Costco CFO made a perfect remark about Amazon on the Earnings call. Don't see anything wrong with his remark. No idea why it was misinterpreted. Costco business seems to be doing just fine. Its Amazon that needs to worry about profitability.
"When you see Costco's in Japan, with the number of people that shop there, then you've won the game. Long and strong baby!"
"A hearty congratulations, Grimmikins. You're now officially $50 per share underwater on your imaginary short at $113.The simple fact that you won't acknowledge your folly simply proves my point over and over and over........You're a fibbin', l'il sissy..........."
"GOLD = PUTS right now....NOW AY this goes above targets of $250......in fact, after options expiration this Friday watch market selloff into midterms! tHIS IS SO overbought IT IS obscene......STOCKS always RETRACE TO THEIR MOVING AVERAGES.....AND THE 50 DAY IS $22 BELOW!!!!!!"
"WOO HOO, and another raises PT. to $330 yes!!!!!!Analyst Actions: Loop Capital Raises Price Target for Costco Wholesale to $330 From $305, Reiterates Buy Rating"
Only about 13k shares exchanged afterhours so far... My guess is it paints more red tomorrow. Just being par for the course isn't good enough for this kind of valuation.
Do you guys know if they are before or After the market on Thursday? Thank you
Markets will TANK with Biden.
look for dips as BUY opp.
"Wall Street concerned with Costco PE of 27 and says not a word about Amazon with a PE of 270, seems to be a disconnect. Costco is simply a buy and hold, still adding stores and customers."
Anyone who bothers to waste money on an Echo has too much money to spend. The only things the only person I know that has one uses it for is a kitchen timer and to play music for the dog when they leave the house. My dogs can enjoy the quiet and be listening for me to come home and I have a cheap kitchen timer that I can walk from room to room or outside holding which I like very much. I love sitting on my front deck with a glass of wine and the timer in hand to know when dinner is ready.
"a few months ago when costco was doing good I remember a guy buying in at $321...and then the stock started to tank..he was worried about getting his money back....I told him not to worry, he would have gains in no time...that poor guy may never get his money back"
It will sharply up after BJ’s ER at 6:45am
"whats funny is i turned on the scam show CNBC,,they cry like the sky now is falling and everyone should sell,,,they go short and long yet never fully disclose what they have when they talk smack,,,, very funny show,,its a timeshare game they play,,,nothing they say will have any value yet someone will believe the sales poitch"
"FAUCI getting paid $$$ under the table from DEMOCRAPS , to make Trump look bad."
"To me it looks like this share is trading in a sideways 290 USD - 315 USD trading range. I guess it could be nice for peolpe who don't like fluctuation and dividends. I'm neutral on it, I don't hold COST and I think for me to invest in this company there has to be a major discount. - Do your own research -"

Listening to people at work complain about Monday morning & lousy starshits coffee.

Nothing but Bernstein helping weekly Options Mafia for this Friday.
Bought a boat load on that$20ps down day. booyah. If you didn't buy then you need a broker.
"From analysts: They estimate that the Sam's Clubs Walmart is closing generate annual sales between $4 billion and $4.5 billion , meaning that if Costco can capture between 30% and 50% of that business, it could lift comparable sales between 50 and 100 basis points, and add as many as 600,000 new members.Can you say ""chaching"".... GLTA"
You can't ignore the fact that almost everyone I know loves Costco. Keep the good job!
Past due for a split.
I want an entry point so bad
Just a wholesome good bang for your buck company. Shoppers all smiling when they check out. My happy place. Shop every two weeks. Often over bought then give to food bank. Why not? Giving more bless than receiving
No increase in Corporate tax rates while the GOP controls the senate.
28 PE too high stock should be 150
"look a the looooooogg lines at Costco, it definitely benefitting from COVID-19."
"this stock should be soring, Lines around the block literally for 2 weeks straight and are getting longer."
shouldnt be a dip here...should just be a steady green day up around $10 after the nice earnings
costco has what the consumer needs every day . the consumer is strong and costco will roll to new highs
Would appreciate your thoughts on the following... At what multiple does COST deserve to trade at and why? Full disclosure... I don't currently own shares and haven't for a few years now. I sold in the mid-$150's in 2015. Some might say that was early and I wouldn't argue (decision still made sense for me). I will consider buying again if/when it gets closer to a share price I feel is justified. Cheers!
Steady climber as I said
"UP, up she goes !"
"Costco will be 250-255 sometime in January, 2019."
"Finally broke the $200 threshold, can it close over $200?"
COST is up 4.99% to 297.32
er 1.90 more than 19 cents as expexted
Interesting play on the $1.9T stimulus and infrastructure spending bill Look  at Houston Wire and Cable (HWCC). Market cap around $60M. Reduced long term debt from over $90M to under $15M. Largest shareholder and activist investor Nierenberg wants company sold to unlock value.

Costco to open 200 stores in China
I think this has been red for 2 months straight now. What is the bottom? $250? $200? Lower?
Up almost $20 in just 3 days. Who cares about pensions. Cost is the best stock for retirement lol.
"Dead money for a long time. I got out yesterday, wish I had a limit that would have been triggered. Didn't like the market. Now that the Amazon/whole foods news of the discounts start Monday, there is NO way to tell how it will affect them for months to come. Monthly sales, maybe, but not for a couple months. The big thing will also be memberships. You will not know this for many months. Those 2 things will keep this stock down. It's PE is also too big for a retailer. I'm glad I bailed when I did. If it gets cheap enough, I'll buy back in. It turns out I made just a tiny bit with everything factored in. Enough for a $10 pizza and a chicken bake. I'd be down all that, and then some if I held. Got nervous when it couldn't break $160. I know something was up. I may get out of Google as well. That can't get over $130, bad feeling. I will bail on that as well if it hits that number again."
Inverted head and shoulders...............better cover soon shorties.
"did the stocks get halted,?"
Did the earnings report tank ? Never goes down this much
Cramer.........................BBBBUUUUYYYYYYYY
Look for the silly dips as opportunity to get back in.
once this gets greern..it will steamroll
down from here. to 113 ha...........................
"One of the only one open , and making money and it’s not moving up much? I don’t get it ."
"let me tell you one case where i find very impressive. long term buyer and long term stock holder.rarely shop in supermarkets anymore .one time i had a problem with a food item (i leave that one out to be generic because i suspect they will know who i am). i find the quality in the bag of these things not consistent. even took pics to show them. the store folks give me the expected usual reception. not happy about it. asked for manager, not happy about the way it went. called corporate, got in contact with a group that deals with this item specifically. they listened extremely carefully and within one week a team of 2 flew into another city where the food was harvested and processed. they end up learning more about the process and came away better educated. they followed up with me on their findings. all in all, i am very impressed that the corp folks really take pride in their work and sourcing. Don't get me wrong, the local store guys are very pro all the time already. awesome american success story, like amzn, like apple, ummm, help me out guys lol"
Sales will rise further cause people will be forced once again to stay at home... mark my words
semi-weak movement
"I really worry about America. If this kind of virus every few years comes a time, economy will be failed so terrible, so harmful. it brings unstable stock market. Many people waste in here is really unwisely. For good economy, we should consider a better system without getting harm from any tangible or intangible. Take down this stock market for ever."
"There were 3 lines from the check-out all the way back to the meat department at Waterfront Costco near Pittsburgh, PA, this morning just after the store opened at 10 AM. The lines moved quickly and I'm guessing they probably broke their one-day record sales at that store. Costco is clearly a top-notch operation with strong demand...plus they have pharmacies on site...adding to their status as an ""essential"" business."
Next step is $160.9
If there was going to be a big drop it would’ve happened after hours. Fb dropped 20% in after hours last year
"The greenhouse industry is hot and fresh produce keeps increasing in demand. I’ve been adding to my $GRF position, Greenrise Foods and $APPH. They own almost 100 acres of greenhouses in Leamington. They bought all of Mastronardi Produce (Sunset Brand) greenhouses as well as another 30 acres last month. They have Major distribution channels like $WMT & $KR . Their peers are trading around $30 while this stock is still at ground level. Time to load up!"
"People I bought this so called POS for $15.00 in 1990 and participated in the DRIP . So what I am saying is don’t listen to the haters know what you own and invest away . Costco is only getting g started , ok opening stores all over the world. Right now only 1 store in China, can you imagine 10Years from now they have 100 stores . So invest away in Costco for the Longterm . I originally bought 2500 shares and you can only imagine what I own now with all the dividends being reinvested . Buffet would be proud of me lol"
What does COST have to do with Trump trade wars?
"dow futures down...probably gunna lose $8 ,tomorrow"
"Can some one explain me the dividend! I bought yesturday 80 shares, will I get dividend and how much?"
Profit margins of 2.7% is pretty discouraging

"Here it is. COST. LONG. Slow, steady and stable .Own some."
"Still Overbought, Overpriced. Worth about 190 at best."
Overreaction. Costco still have one of the best prices in retail shopping. I don't see how the takeover affect the Costco Enterprise.
"Oh man, what is going on? Upgrade and target raised 2 days in a row yet COST goes red."
This is my best stock by a country mile. All of my other stocks are in a bear market.
"Visiting Costco store later, it will bounce back no probs. These investors are chickening out too bad."
"My best stock by far, keeps making new highs. Too bad no special div"
Trump does it again!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/costco-misses-2q-profit-forecasts-212518528.html
"should settle around 173-174 today and within weeks back up to 180s. those who cannot afford the fee increase should not go to cost in the first place. it is not a place for cheap products. it is a place for great products at a reasonable price. it is not easy to find great products at reasonable price anymore. that is why cost continues to have a strong niche, something even amzn cannot take away. people enjoy driving somewhere to get something. other times, they can online shop"
TGT went down too.so sad...
Both costco near me have been packed even in between flyers sale cycles. Parking lot filled and has been this way for months now. Im a buyer at 295.
Tanks for the 303.00 buy order
"Whoa, what just happened? I don't see any news?"
"Overall, Costco's same-store sales jumped 11.5% last month, above the 7.5% forecast by Consensus Metrix. Same-store sales in the U.S. climbed 11%, beating estimates for a 7.6% gain. Those sales were up 8.4% in Canada and 18% in other international locations, also topping forecasts.Costco e-commerce same-store sales spiked 85.8%.Target $450!"
"wow,,,a 6% drop,,,,,,or 10 bucks a share,,,,,,,really,,,what happened BULLS,,,did you all get scared,,,so the bears have crushed all you longs by getting you to sell as they shorted ,,,,,weak longs ,,,where is the so called run,,, 160 wlll be the best for 2017,,"

Look at Nike Stock good example when people were selling it I bought bought more and it went higher made new highs so when people sell buy add more to your position it will pay off....
Just need to break even at 295 so I can buy AVGO on the low end.

The market cant make up its mind whether its a virus stock or not.
LOW LOW Volume on this pullback !positive ..............................290.00 I start buying
"Costco is expected to report its March sales results, for the five weeks ending April 5, on April 8."
did earnings release?
"Today, I went out for an errand and stop by Costco for some smoke salmon. I ended up buying whole bunch of stuff. Head and Shoulder Shampoo is $3.50 off, Mochi ice cream is $3.00 off, King crab corn chowder is off $3.00, Garlic Shrimp is off $3.00 and Cold Pressed Green Juice is $2.00 off. Do I need all these discounted items? No. I already have plenty of Shampoo at home and the rest were just food that I could consumed but my fridge and freezer are quite full. I just could not resist stuff that are on sale at Costco. I seldom order from Costco online other than some meats. I used to buy Grass Fed Steaks from the online store. I like to walk around Costco and check if there are something that I could use as I know Costco would offer a very competitive price. I have tried so many different foods because there were on sale. While the selections in Costco is not much but the prices are always good. Last month, I ordered some items online from Costco. What triggered me to search the online store is I remembered the report that Costco’s online sales went up. I started to explore the online store. I checked items that I were going to purchase from Home Depot and Amazon. I purchased an air cleaner, a faucet and a garbage disposal. These items (the ones that I wanted) were usually not at the Costco stores. While Amazon has the most selections but Costco has the best price. Home Depot sometimes do have great prices when on sale. I do think Costco has a good potential to grow the online sales. I for one is now checking Costco online store before ordering from Amazon or popping into a Home Depot."
i hear COST may spilt
THRERE IT IS
Why is WMT and AMZN up but COST down? It should be the other way around.
"EVERYTHING GREEN...well, almost everything!!!!!!!"
I get 1b10 number on my calculator when I tried to figure the math out on the loss of value today can’t get number it’s to big for my calculator
Inflation is when a company pays their people more than the average worker which in turn makes them pay more taxes but then they increase fees to purchase their products. That's what liberal outfits do. No one wins.
loading up ..........................low 150.000 will NOT last for long.............................

Beat or fail ?
"Hey, Hair Lip! How's that Hair Cut treating ya? Dont worry peach fuzz, it wont drop much, but it will breathe a bit. Enjoy the run to $400 by EOY."
still need foods whenever. keep it
"Looking at Walmart's stock chart I see it's been declining since December like Costco. So, it's not a company ( Costco) issue. What's happening is sector rotation. Money, right now, is going into cyclical stocks. Oil for example. We're touching the bottom in terms of Costco stock."
cant wait to buy more
How can they think that COST is in for more profit taking after the recent down trend... who are these crazies!? how could profit takers not be out of this stock already after that the best price added since is 150$... current value of 10.7 % on a short term basis but we should have lost a bunch of profit takers already... it made a long opportunity at value i doubt people are selling below 180 with any volume...
"Here’s why I think Costco is a good investment, both short term and long term—1. Consistently good to very good financial performance 2. Great customer experience, loyalty, and trust...and hence continuing growth from existing stores3. Lots of expansion opportunities, domestic and foreign, including China (anxiously waiting for 2nd mainland store after great success with the first one and one-half years ago). After the Shanghai success, hope to see multiple stores open soon. 4. Lots of room to improve online and related delivery. Still well behind Amazon and Walmart in my view. 5. Lots of room to expand online lines of business, like travel, insurance, leisure, etc."
It's a Buy under 150
everytime costco starts heading to that pistol $400 mark.. $$BAM$$ OUT GO THE LIGHTS
Have the feeling stock will drop a bit before it pops. Same looking pattern Jan 15 2018. Hopefully I'm wrong.
This should be a fun week.
"It would be very smart for Costco to start selling diesel fuel. Not only could they fuel their own fleet after dropping shipment, along with other local commercial rigs, the personal car market is moving towards diesel to meet mileage requirements set by our ""super smart, super caring, all knowing, in our best interest government"" (lol)."
200 soon. needs to correct like all other stocks.stores packed but thin margin
Gone up daily for a week now...I see no problems ahead. Also agree with the parking lots always filled which only means good news for investors. Stop by sometimes just for the rotisserie chicken..Best Buy anywhere.
All u negatives will be the first to change tune when this turns around and passes $350.
Last chance to get in before $350.
"Grimmikins, tell us again.How many shares of COST did you short at $113?If you're gonna fib, fib big.Sailor-suited sissy............."
green
As restrictions relax ... COST will soar .................................... to fresh highs.
Target raised !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!375-378.00
COST & TSLA are so safe at all time!! :)
"Ok so basically because it didn’t spike in AH, it’s only going to tank"
"THIS AMAZON MYTH.I do not own (and never have owned) shares of Costco, Amazon, Safeway, Kroger, or Ebay.This NONSENSE of how Amazon is going to reshape or change how people buy food or stuff, or how its going to hurt companies like Costo, Safeway, or other food stores---completely #$%$. The media is GETTING PAID to tell you this. Amazon, look whats happening. Their pricing is too high, and they are in cahoots with the shipping companies to make money on shipping charges. Their customer service used to be first class, now its staffed by 3rd world losers with no English skills living in BFE. No, Amazon is going to take away consumer choices. Walgrees and others will quit offering items that Amazon sells, and pretty soon you'll go into a drug store or Safeway, they won't carry the things you always bought--cheap shampoo, dental products, hand soap, bandaids, etc. Getting it from Amazon (because its ""more convenient"") will result in inflated shipping charges and 1 week to 10 days to actually receive it.No, Amazon is not going to change things for the better for the consumer. If you think differently, then you better be buying FedEx or UPS (but then, you become a Union sympathizer....)."
"If Costco stock does not do well in the long term, America is in a world of hurt. Great business modeland they have what everyone needs----- food! I truly believe in this company and will stay the course.I have to say the stock is acting very strange in the last couple of weeks. See what earnings say. Shouldbe an outstanding quarter even with Covid!"
I LOVE MY COSTCO stocks!
going to 199.00
"This stock will set all time highs after earnings,its the Holiday season that will push it up."
"Costco has always paid their employees better than other stores, with most above $15/hr."
Sold another batch of Costco stock today for a gain of $115.00
Looks like the MACD is turning...... finally. Lets close from here up.
"Last earning red AH and big green the next day , $325-$330 tomorrow"
Market is IRRATIONAL about Virus.......................we should learn from other markets as they do not seem to PANIC like we do.
"Hi fellow Costco investors,I am a mid-20’s investor looking for solid companies to invest in for 5-10 years. How do you all feel about Costco’s growth prospects? Does it still have enough untapped growth/market share to justify holding long? Or has its incredible run probably already included it’s best days?I’d appreciate your thoughts.Thank you!"
"costco company has screwed everyone,,,their stock drops from 180 to 150 and they say nothing,,,so maybe the shorts have it right that they will be destroyed by amazon,,,,,, markets are up every stock is running and costco is falling everyday,,, i have to admit they suck now that they cant overcome the amazon game effect"
CCramer said BUUUUUUUUUUUUYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY COST ahead of earnings....................way overdone here................................too much negativity built into the price.
Got back in @210. Good discount.
Seeing the lines at cosco the last 3 weeks it is amazing this is not $350 a share
Somebody leaked this earnings info. All the big players knew in advance. I want an investigation!
Cramer saw I made $1100 profit on Costco over the last 6 months. I guess he wants his share now.
costco is severely undervalued
COST SHOULDNT BE SOLD LIKE OTHER COMPANIES THEY ARE GROWING AND SPECIAL DIV COMING
Going down big time tomorrow!
Down she goes
Why is COST down so much?
Will COST shine over $170 by end of this month?....Bet ya....
I bought on dec 1st 2020Why I did not received $10.00 dividend
"There is a huge problem w/ Costco these days. As the company explores reaching into the online business, they are having a very difficult time separating their 'ECOM' from their regular (in-store) warehouse business model. Their ECOM is far too slow to ramp-up because mgmt. (who I believe are excellent at what they do) just aren't accepting that Costco cannot have an online business model that follows their existing warehouse business model. There is no way around this, at present, the Amazon business model is the only one there is for online shopping. Costco needs to break from their mentality of selling (online) only those types of products that their members have come to expect in their warehouses. It's just not enough. They are severely lacking 'variety' of choice. Basically, you can find anything you need or want on Amazon but not so w/ Costco. Costco has already invested millions of dollars in ramping-up their ECOM but until they realize that online shopping just cannot be the same experience as their warehouse shopping, until they realize that they need to follow Amazon in order to compete w/ Amazon, mgmt. will remain stagnant w/ lost opportunities, revenues and profits from their ECOM operations."
Special dividend coming soon
Would love to see stock split
"If they didnt pay the $10 dividend, Im sure the earnings would have exceeded consensus."
"Once again, why does any company report earnings if they go to all time highs after they miss? Costco had horrible horrible earnings and now back near all time highs. So why even have quarterly earnings?"
"Miss earnings, stock goes down, 2 months later back to all time highs. Does anyone else question this behavior?"
DONT FIGHT THE FED THEY BUYING ETFS AND PUSHING MARKET HIGHER TRUMP GOING BE PRESIDENT AGAIN
"hey Kenny, I wanted to discuss that ""nice drop"" and how it relates to your $113 short."
Love COST. My best stock by far. Too bad my other stocks don't even come close.
bought more of this dip. long term core holding.
Parabolic nonsense at this point....SHORT 500 shares at $262!!!!!!!!!!!! Why does this trade so thinly anyway?? They can push the price wherever they want it to be!!!!!!!!!
Hooya is so nervous about to lose his money
Why the decline at close?
When is the ex-Dividend date for $10 dividend?
Usually cycles down in October. For no good reason.
cant comment
"Breaking News,, the scammer james Cramer of the Street,com says the bears are slowing down on costco,,he has inside information ,"
it reached Maximum of 350$ no further increase in the price. selling and taking profits
COST is down 4.90% to 290.25
TRUMP wants lower oil ???????Markets CRASH............................................
I warned everyone here not to ignore the triple-bottom last October/November...
the bad thing about this is it may hurt the earnings next quarter
"buy Costco now. I've been following buffet in 2020. whenever he sells his position in a company, I go buy, because it goes up after he sells."
One more cliff down tmr!
J P MORGAN upgrade with a buy target 201
"Next week I get my EBT. Then I go to Costco and load up. Drink a few brews and shots in the parking lot then holla, free food, son."
COST is an Investment NOT a day trade !
Look for COST to start Covid Vaccine shots soon.
BOYCOTTING AMAZON yet? Then keep on losing while amazon eats your lunch.
Holiday crowd has started...
up up and away..................BUY while its cheap ! way undervalued......................
Will add 4k shares today. Great opportunity to average down!
why is this ever down? this is a solid stock..buy it keep it
how could this be? wow
If the earnings are not great the management should be fired for raising the wages.
It is time to step in.
"Wait for 358.00 or lower............... before buyingMM""s are set up............................"
CHINA. Even in the US the Chinese are spending a lot of money in COST.
Sales accelerated in August. Great news. Highest of the year.
when is the earning date?
Good stock to keep in portfolio. They make more money in membership than selling products.
"TELL ME WHY MGT DECIDED TO GO TO $16 AN HOUR ??? YOU ADD TO HEAVY EXPENSE. THE AVERAGE IS ACTUALLY CLOSER TO $25 AN HOUR. THATS OVER $50,000 A YEAR TO STOCK SHELVES. DOES THAT SOUND REASONABLE TO YOU ? GENIUS."
COST is down on costs. Ironical. Maybe they should have waited before announcing the $16 wage.
"HUGE BEAT, HA HA HA"
Up 101.9 % e-commerce business in August basically doubled from last year
"not enough to justify price... each ""warehouse"" worth over 100 mil... compare to all other retailers on a store value basis. too rich"
Ya'll forget they make a large part of their revenue from their membership. I guarantee those numbers will be high
COST almost always goes down after earnings.
Costco rumored to end selling items in their food court to non members. Great idea! Make them sign up for membership so Costco stock will be higher.
it's the government they want their money
Why such a drop today?
"My average price is $41.86. But I started buying Price club shares converting to PriceCostco shares to Costco shares.  Love, Love, Love Costco"
"this stock is consistently up then down, would make a good day trader stock, or every 2-3 days"
"Always funny to see COST marching along with a 31 p//e and a growth rate below 7%. Even most technology companies would die to get a PEG north of 2 and COST is at 4.5Even with pricing everything in frozen produce at $10 now and calling everything ""organic"" so they can charge more and have smaller packages, they still have a lousy growth rate.I'm sure all the cheerleaders here will pontificate about future growth and moving into China or India or wherever but is there any clear thinking person that thinks this company is not ridiculously overvalued?Even BJ's has a much higher growth rate and much lower p/e. The only logical reason I can see is that the same sheep you see lining up every Saturday afternoon to but toilet paper, paper towels, food and snacks for more than you can get them virtually anywhere (TGT,WMT, KR, etc.) without paying $60 to get in the door, are the same ones buying up the stock. Emperor's new clothes if I ever saw it. ""What do you want to do today honey?""""We'll I guess we should go spend $250 at COST since we paid $60 upfront and I'd like to somehow get that money back in tiny increments by the time we have to spend another $60 next year."""
Should survive this bloodbath thanks to tangible revenue and actual numbers. Playing the run up to earnings as it should be good. Investors will return to value stocks sooner or later
Hey guys im thinking of shorting this what are your thoughts?
It will be up soon
Buy back 235.00 area
"nice to see a little bounce, but this has been disappointing the last month. when I bought just prior to the ER, prior to Nationwide shut downs, I bet on this stock soaring to greater highs than just being traded day to day. it still cant retain the day's gain. not as hopeful... sales will not be better than it was in March."
COST is down 4.91% to 294.21
SHORTIES better cover soon.
this is a good one to hold. put my money in conns inc. will be back to this in a few weeks
Love that drop. Shop-Rite cutting into costblo profits againnnnn!
Someone tell me 'why' a stock split would't help this stock?
Would not expect a killer quarter with all of the bad weather around the country people were not out shopping as much
great way to wake up on a Friday 
Defensive $$$ coming out of COST to be deployed to tech once correction capitulates.
CEO says digital and work-from-home will fuel grocery sales even after pandemic.
Would love to buy more under 350. Doesn’t look like it’s going to break support
"I didn't think this would go down so much today because of the xtra business they have been doing, guess im wrong, went down just like every other stock today"
PPS = $90-$100
"Poster child for a great buy-and-hold stock. Member since 1990 (Price Club days) and shareholder since 2005. It's nearly a 5-bagger for me, working out to a 12.5% annual return, not counting dividends. Slow and steady wins the race...."
"My guess remains that the store being hurt most by this deal is Costco.I have been a happy Costco shopper for 40 years. I am a former COST stock holder. But I’m 62, my last kid finally exits the house this summer, and I no longer need to buy 42 rolls of toilet paper at once, or 10 pounds of pork shoulder, or 20 pounds of potatoes. I will soon lack the energy to drag my car 20 miles across town each month for $500 worth of stuff I don’t need, even if the prices are incredible.On the other hand, it might be nice to get a meal-kit, or a prepared meal, delivered to my door soon. Oh, and can they add some wine or a fresh baguette to the order? I’m in.There are tens of millions of baby boomers just like me, retired or on the cusp of retirement, about to face that same choice."
Costco is going full #$%$ with their mandatory mask policy. This will cost them a chunk of their membership. I don?t see anything good coming out of this.
Long line ups outside with shopping buggies discourages many shoppers; limits on who comes in; low volume in the warehouses. This is all priced in already.
Membership fees to increase soon ......................................
It dropped $1 in a split second.
HEAD FAKE
9/18/20 i added $334We can't even get back to that?
2.10/share....
Good earnings won’t save this company But a website that works would it’s 2021 and it’s still imposable to renew your ownership on line with a help message that tells you to go to the store.
Those employees getting $2.00 extra/hr kept yours and my family supplied with food and yes toilet paper when they could have stayed home an collected unemployment making more money! You should thank everyone of them daily!
Blood bath tomorrow Not safe at all guys Earnings not that good
even if earnings are great...after today it will seem like no earnings
Nice rebound!!
"COST gives special dividend every 2-3 years, the last one was in 2017, so they are already overdue."
I love Costco. Pro Trump company. It sells everything and I mean everything in plastic which destroys the earth. Trump approved environmental destruction company..
on target for $200.
"Time to tak massive profits....the swelloff is coming and it will be SWIFT to the downside....come too far, too fast......$230 - $285 in 4 months....really??????far"
Good fundamentals. I think it will reach $390 before the earnings date...
Sell your fear so I can buy options in the panic. I’ve learned it’s easier to make money from the fear of retail investors than buy into good news when the move is already made.
"Now we know how in the world the price was taking a hit after good news last months/quaters, the big boy has been dumping it all. Bye Warren."
$330 on earnings
"As usual, COST will do a deep dive on earnings. Expectations always exceed performance. They talk about increased costs, etc. It will drop to $330 then recover over the few weeks."
"Analyst Actions: Telsey Advisory Lifts Costco Wholesale's Price Target to $350 From $330, Keeps Outperform Rating.$350, A no-brainer IMO. $400 analyst action before too long."
"Costco management highlighted a strong membership renewal rate (91% for U.S. and Canada), ending the quarter with 59.7 million membership households. thats a real positive !look for stimulus $$$ to start rolling in."
I love this stock!! The earnings report today was amazing!!! I love this stock so much I'm ok being down by thousands of dollars. Wish I bought at $312 instead of $360.
Like if you think COST is overdue for a special dividend :)
P/E of 36 should be 20. COST will go back to support level at $180.00https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/COST?p=COST
Definitely a good buying point. A solid stock for long term.
That’s a beat fellas
Costco raises their minimum wage for all entry employees to $15 an hr. Two years in a row with a dollar raise for entry level employees.
I live in Puerto Vallarta Mexico. The Costco here is packed 7 days a week.
"Love their chicken bake, stock will go up"
stock is going up..you want in. get in now..over $300 next week
YEAH baby....JUST CASHED IN 1/2 FOR $1K PROFIT!!!!!!!!!! Add that to the $950 earlier this week....like I thought....nothing goes up forever. I watched the future VIX (2 months out) rising like crazy at end of the day....predicts bad news coming.
If it hits $300 will probably drop to $275.
"Back to 200, Time to buy in bulk"
Glad I didn’t buy fedex.
BOYCOTTING AMAZON yet? You deserve losing money on Costco if you are not BOYCOTTING AMAZON.
"HAW!!! Yet ANOTHER one from proboards' ""mnkdcirclejerk"" forum! Yeah! ""Sellhighdrinklow"" posted:""I am told that Mannkind reps will no longer be leaving sample packs with doctors but instead will send the samples directly to patients via a coupon. I am told this is because of $cost. Does anybody have further thoughts/information on this? TYIA""Baloney! IF that's what MNKD is starting to do, it's because none of the docs WANT the sample paks, and THAT is BECAUSE they don't INTEND to ever PRESCRIBE afrezza."
It's the ghost of Warren Buffet now haunting this stock since he's sold. Downtrend will soon reverse. Bank on it.
Coming back up. Hahaha. Definitely Green
COST goes to 250 on earnings on Dec. 13
next Fibo level is 352.00
COST is a buy here great sale price.
"Today prove what I said. BJ and Costco need to improve their service. Treat customers in good attitude. Employees are not care about customers. You buy or not buy, they will not get fire!!"
Bought COST while short WMT...
"Big guys and short sellers are playing the market, then they will jump in when it's low enough for them and start pumping up the price."
Does the stock drop $10 per share when the dividend is paid? Thanks.
SEPT 24TH REPORT DAY-------ONCE THIS IS ABOVE $353 IT WILL GO TO $380 BEFORE EARNING
COST upgraded again today.Own it don’t trade it.
"I love this company, always beats!"
"I just came back from Costco, parking lot was full, lines were long but cahiers worked very efficiently. Customers carts were full and everything always runs smoothly. Employees are paid well, customer returns are always in favor of the consumer, firing on all cylinders looking for a beat next Thursday."
nice! back to September 2019 levels. stock market is great.
Costco lost its purpose as a business; the point is for INVESTORS to make money. These guys are paying 4B to their employees... Not a good place to hold long term
Nothing has changed for COST.........................adding more as it goes ON SALE !
Down she goes. Like always. I love burning money.
Come on 289.000000000000000000000000000000
Lots of bashers in here getting nervous it looks like. All i see is good news and they keep peddling misinformaton.
After gme ive been sitting on cash and looking for good opportunities. After noticing most retail is being shorted Costco is the opposite. Not to mention I believe this is currently undervalued and should bounce off resistance. I saw comments on here about a split? Is that confirmed? I was also digging and found their e-commerce grew around 70% which was much higher than Walmart. I think I will be adding to cost with my gme earnings. Pls share your thoughts and observations
again they beat expectations on revenue and expenses..but yet the stock tanks
"The one and only thing that Tweety Bird is right about, is that Wall Street is the most protected corrupt place on earth."
"A co-worker of mine recently got hired by Costco. He got hired on Friday and was told he had to start on Monday or they would give the job to someone else. He was forced to tell his employer, who hired him 6-years ago, overlooking things in his past that would have disqualified him from most jobs, that he couldn't give 2 weeks notice. I wonder how Costco would appreciate one of their employees doing that to them? The company I work for has 6 locations throughout 2 states and we buy all our office and maintenance supplies at Costco. Actually, correction, we did buy. We'll take our business to Sam's Club now instead."
"So I am at my local COST at 10:30 this morning. We have an absolute monsoon occurring. The parking lot is more full than I expected given the storm. It is a location with their own liquor store and gas. I ask a middle management type what has happened since the switch to Visa, by asking first about liquor and then about gas and then about the main store. He very enthusiastically says that each part has enjoyed increased traffic and revenues. I have posted a couple of times here that I thought the increases would happen. COST has made itself one of my largest positions, and I think we will be outperforming for at least 3-5 years ahead. That is how real wealth is created."
COST hits 300 gy year end
COST got resistance by 50dma should drop to 208 by friday
BUY under 200.00
Business now fighting back @ TRUMP over tariffs....................ENOUGH is ENOUGH..............................
I own Berkshire and Costco. I’m glad to be diversified further. I’m long on Berkshire and long on Costco.
the bull market is finished
membership FEES to increase !!!!. in early 2017great news for investors !Buy while its cheap.

See 250 this week on earnings announcement that does not meet the high expectations.
nice bounce off the 20
Could soon be on BREAKOUT ???????
Brandon Fletcher man bad!!!
"The market was crushing me, sucking my cash and I was about to give up. Everything changed for me when I discovered (http://Fairstox.com). Join them now and count winners!"
This is just a day traders dream.
I guess since they increased their dividend they may not have a special dividend this year.
Is COST still a good buy at $187. In May 2017 Costco paid the special dividend - so think it will again and when?
11 days ago I said it’d be over 300 in less than a month. A lot of doubters.
"NOT MY WORDS... THE ANALYSTS ""Costco Wholesale Corp. stock fell in the extended session Thursday after the retailer reported lower-than-expected EPS, saying it had incurred in more costs with wages."" GET IT ? HIGHER EXPENSES. THE INCREASE IN WAGES TO $16 / HOUR. THATS THE REASON WHY THE STOCK IS TANKING"
"If you at first don't succeed, try, try again. ."
"And this drop is just fear that ALL people will start buying groceries from AMZN.... lol Despite excellent earnings the drop is 6%. For me AMZN is very limited at this level so why they try to take grocery business. I think AMZN is more in bad shape than COST. I was at coscto yesterday at 7 pm - couldn't find parking, lineups to tire department, pharmacy, no empty seats at the bar. All cashiers are open, and all of them got huge lineups. Despite low stock I LOVE costco, good price, good value, good return policy, good selections (no 100 items of the same things but just 1 or 2 that are on top). At Costco you can buy blindly anything.AMZN - you never see the item, you never touch the item, you spend hours on research of what you buy - get something you don't like, hell to order (limit on this or that), hell to return the item."
Very frustrating day!!! Had to bit my tongue for calling for $350 on this MB 1 month early. GRRR LOL
Hey shorty - you have been given a life line in order to cover your position. The last three trading days have seen consolidation. But when this is over you will burn. Cover now.
Wow the market is up 500 and costco goes no where
"COST beats estimate by 6 cents. Sales growth is 5.7% beat estimate 5.1%, i bet you that the stock will go down tomorrow. COST needs to split the stock."

NO matter what virus you have YOU STILL NEED TO BUY GROCERIES and EAT WELL.go COST go...................................
Told you always BUY the silly dips........................
At this rate it's gonna close above 320.
Beat 0.12 cents !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This stock is hopeless
keep loadin on dip days till next earnings u wont be dissapointed
When the Chevy salesman ask me where’s my $$$ I’ll tell him I’ll be back tommorow after my Costco moneytrain rolls in
"I hope the hoarders get stuck with their merchandise, Costco should temporarily halt refund on product until this is all over, too many people are taking advantage of gouging the public on resale."
COST is cheap here !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!undervalued !
Crushed it baby!
SO YOU OPTIMISTS...YOU'RE OK WITH THE CURRENT PRICE ? 320...310... 300 fine ? how about 285... tell me when to stop. Mgt is doing a fabulous job ?
"If it can pass $344 today. It’s safe to say that it can only rise up from there. Good rating and upgrade. It can’t hurt the share price that much. I am surprised with good market today, it hasn’t turn Green yet."
What are the possible liabilities from their lawsuit?
That’s why COST and TGT down so much today! Another cliff down for COST tmr!
COST is benefiting the biggest from stimulus checks!
I think we've seen the bottom. Pulled the trigger at 157.
"Amazon has a new app that will not allow a shopper to compare prices with a competitor when you are in a store, but it will direct you to Amazon's site and perhaps offer a coupon. Does that sound like a fair thing? How can they get a patent on something like that? Boycott Amazon."
More bad Virus news the higher COST goes........................
wheres Tom at telling everyone to buy the silly dips?
"Options tomorrow, around 340 most will be worthless...."
large moves coming...better cover soon .
"Has Costco been buying back stock? If not, should they have been? Also, what would be better? Going ahead with the special dividend in the summer, or using that money on an acquisition instead (assuming there is a good one available)?"
Shorties better cover............
up up and away.......................................300 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++
E commerce up 75%%%
"While I can see that Costco is really popular for stocking up on items, I wonder if this is really something that can set it apart from other stocks in the months ahead? So now I have extra toilet paper, water, wipes. And whether people are forced to stay out of public areas or not, you just have extra products that you're not going to have to buy later."
Apple stores closed world wide however Apple phone still available at Costco. . 90 days refund policy here
Why did I dump everything at 324
Read my leap after ER it will 400 (average analysts estimate)
"ok, I'm a new card carrying Costco member as of TODAY. I could not believe ALL the people in the store and how FULL their baskets were... Wow.... I think we have a good/safe investment with this company... I personally didn't buy very much but did ""browse"" quite a bit and did use the scanner on my phone to comparison shop and Costco was cheaper on the two items I compared against online using ""compare with google"" feature!FYI, I was in the Dallas area at the store in Plano on the tollroad... Go CostCo...They are currently building a new one in McKinney, TX that will be open in about 60 - 90 days!"
$COST Maintains Morgan Stanley Overweight USD 360 » USD 400
I bought in at 352...and I thought that was a good buy..it kept dipping..not sure ill ever get even again.
There have been shares shorted LOL. must be some covering for sure with continued great numbers coming out from Costco.
COST BE BACK TO $347 TOMORROW
"Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the best companies in the United States. In its most recent quarter, it earned $1.89 per share, beating the consensus estimate of US$1.85 per share. It grew same-store sales by a whopping 7.8%. The long-term picture has been equally rosy: COST appreciated 433% over the course of the 2010s.Costco is a worthy stock for any investor to consider. With a strong Canadian dollar, buying it makes even more sense. As mentioned in the discussion of Brookfield Asset Management, you can invest more cheaply in foreign assets when your local currency is strong. Right now, the Canadian dollar is appreciating against the U.S. dollar, so you can buy COST cheaper in Canadian dollar terms. If you buy now and the Canadian dollar starts falling again, you’ll realize a higher return."
gl longs
"Same store sales missed consensus by some 21 million. Parking lot didn’t look good last night and consumers are postponing large ticket items, buying the more necessary items and presents for families. When homebuyers don’t buy a new house they don’t buy furniture, appliances, and new things to put into the garage. It just stands to reason."
What the .....
almost everything is in a nose dive today.. thought costco would be up though
going to $300
no special dividend - cash is going to associate wages which are higher than UAW wages
"Breaking down 88.1 million paid members, we have 17.9 million executive members ($120/yr) and 70.2 million business/gold-star members ($60/yr). These annual membership fees total 17,900,000*120 + 70,200,000*60 = 6.36 billions/yr.Even with 2% profit margin (which brings in 2.8 billion in 2017), Costco will remain a growing, cash-printing business for many years to come."
My 352.5 calls good?
Way OVERDONE.....................what a sale ...................................... grab all you can here.
"so much weakness in costco in the greatest bull run in the index market...so how is it costco is so weak ...its a weak $158 stock,,,it shows no commanding power in price,,"
has anyone else heard a rumor that costco and Amazon will merge?
"COST stores provides good value and I like to shop there, but the stock has poor value as the current PE is about 36, multi-year high. I had bought some puts yesterday at $1.1 for OCT 4, $270 strike price for the long position shares I own as an insurance to hedge against the ER."
Costco stock has dropped $30 in a month and its management has not said any word to defend it. Where is the leadership?
COST actually rises tomorrow by EOD. Watch for dips and buy all you can below 309
costco might get bit by th coronavirus bug today..premarket in the red
"hey abolish the fed (aka kored) that Costco short at $140 has to hurt, but don't worry Kenny ""red"" mason shorting Costco at $113 will still post that you are a smart investor."
AH price action is crazy
"COST is moving range bound for now, after the ER it will move up somewhat without major swings. COST is a long term / steady investment"
It’s going up
what happened? It is stock price dropped like cliff
"Did a lot of reading about Costco, sounds like a solid company. I personally buy 90% of my stuff at Costco."
I knew the damn estimates were set to high to meet. What a joke! Now they better announce a miraculous dividend or stock buyback to get this in the green.
Opening tomorrow 390
Tomorrow sales number should be huge
I'm in line at Costco in California. Total madhouse. buy buy buy
The stock is up 27% YTD. I don’t understand why you all are complaining...
"Nearly 1% of the float is short. Shares Short (Feb 26, 2021) = 4.21 million. It's not Gamestop, but we should continue to see decent moves up for a little while."
No good
This stock continues to flounder. Over priced and no where to go even when it exceeds expectations.
PMI 50.1...almost contraction territory....keep buying here (LOL)!!!!!!!!!
"Lets vote; thumbs up earnings good, thumbs down earnings bad"
"Why COSTCO even goes down for a day is beyond my comprehension. People still lined up to buy goods, well managed and when things get back to normal, they will have more members."
Great opportunity to add here
Yesterday we also announced a material weakness concerning some aspects of our information systems. It relates to internal (employee and contractor) user access and the way that new or revised programs get put into operation. One example: sometimes IS people who changed jobs or positions did not have their access permissions updated quickly enough. We should have done a better job and have already begun remediation efforts. These issues did not result in mistakes in our financial statements. if anyone needed clarification from costco ceo
power hour..lets go over $5..we need it
Need good news on China deal
"This Is Why 2021 Will Be Another Great Year for CostcoThe popular retailer provided essentials in 2020. But even if customers slow down their stocking up, Costco will still see growth.Jennifer SaibilJennifer Saibil(TMFanibird)Dec 30, 2020 at 10:15AMAuthor BioShopping at Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is a popular American activity, and customers kept up their bulk shopping outings throughout the pandemic. Costco had high sales increases, powered by in-store shopping and also strong digital growth. 2020 was a great year for the bulk-buy king, but 2021 will be also, even as people begin to spend on non-essentials. Here's why, and why it will continue to be good for investors.A year like no otherCostco stepped up to the plate as customers hoarded toilet paper and other essentials throughout lockdowns. But even after most lockdowns had been lifted in the 2021 first quarter, ended Nov. 22, sales grew 17%, and e-commerce increased 86%."
tomorrow will be green 100% they're going to have a phenomenal earnings report probably 5 to $6 earnings because Costco where I'm at is all sold out of toilet paper water Clorox wipes I even went to Fred Meyers sold out of Clorox wipes people are buying so much stuff stocking up on the coronavirus it's going to be a phenomenal report
When is Costco next stock split?
Costco is a terrific defensive stock to hold
COST used to grow 20% a year. It stopped 2 years ago..

Be an INVESTOR NOT DAY TRADER !
"so much for those ""so call"" analyst.. what are they really analyzing?! Look beyond the numbers!!"
buying on these crazy dips.
Oooooh I hear Costco is getting bought out!
"FEMA will roll soon, hard martial law, strict stay at home orders coming with heavy fines. Nobody will be shopping."
Only down 1.5% at this time. Perhaps the cc will deliver for us!
"Poll: how many investors here were shareholders before they were members? I was pretty far from a Costco, so being a member didn't make sense until some years after I bought my first shares. I have talked to several people like this."
what happened in AH?

bloodbath
What is their guidance for Q2.. You didnt say anything
"YUP... COSTCO IS ON ITS WAY NOW. THE SKY IS THE LIMIT. ITS WAY WAY UNDER PRICED. CUSTOMER LOYALTY IS OFF THE CHARTS. THE WORKERS ARE THE BEST. TOILET PAPER IS ALWAYS ON HAND. THE LINES OUTSIDE STRETCH INTO THE NEXT COUNTY AND IN SOME CASES...THE NEXT STATE. THEY'RE OPEING UP NEW WAREHOUSES IN PAKISTAN, TIBET, AND SMALL ISLANDS IN THE PACIFIC WITH POPULATIONS UNDER 100. MGT IS THINKING COLONIZING MARS AND URANUS AS POTENTIAL HOT SPOTS. YUP...NOTHING TO DO FROM HERE ON OUT BUT JUST RELAX AND DREAM OF RETIREMENT AND A GOLDEN PARACHUTE AND MAYBE EVEN A GOLDEN CODOM."
The WMT opiod challange keep the sector in check. COST has no thing to worry about.
Do you ever feel like the downgrade is arbitrary? Or done to artificially lower the stock price albeit temporarily?
Come on GREEN!!!! 
"Myself, and a few people I know.... tried to buy several items at Costco yesterday. basics, milk, bread, cheese, veggies, fruit, I also needed bottled water as i am out of it, and paper towels and toilet paper. First of all, there was NO paper goods available and NO bottled water available. Why? As was reported elsewhere as well as a store employee, people panicked and bought it all OUT with unlimited purchases. leaving many people unable to get what they needed, even like me, just enough for my household near term. Of course, Costco wants to have HIGH sales volume. But as I was able to get most everything else I needed, I proceeded to the cashiers and this was about 2pm Monday. The lines were insame, it was a panic atmosphere, some lady was actually bragging that she got the last 5 cases of bottled water. I felt like teaching her a lesson but I kept my cool. However, I wasn't about to WAIT an hour to get through the line (Henderson NV) and I was so irate about it all that I just left my cart right there, walked away. FGas station was also like it was the end of the world. So, i went to WALMART. They had EVERYTHING I needed, thanks Walmart. Makes me think twice about remaining a member. What should Costco have done when people are hoarding? LIMIT purchases....there will be plenty of customers to share the products. But NO, they are not smart enough to make such a wise and fair decision. Boo hiss on Costco."
"No, need to argue just look at the chart. 1990 $11, present time $345."
VOLUME extremely heavy early on....already 600k shares traded...I smell a top!!!!
Holidays are creeping up! 400 isn’t far off!!
seems weird to me that wanted buffet would sell before a $10 dividend....his 800 year old friend is on the board of directors..im sure he told him about it
Targets raised again.
sold at +$1.09 up because that's the best its gunna get.. this is headed down
Speaking of @RealDopey and his $3.14 Sunday brunch with wifey...I have $COST in my 401k going back to 2002.. somewhere around $30 that year...They crushed earnings!!
Cramer said todayCOST and AAPL are a must hold .
JUMP! Costco. JUMP!
"Maybe the Amazon deal next week. I do business on Amazon, trust me they have a long way to go on this, and they will get stiff competition. Costco is a growth story that will continue. buy on such weakness."
Shop-rites all over crowded.costco ampty & stuck with extra turkeys.
Doesn’t make sense. Others in same sector green everyday like Walmart.
wow
Thanks for357.00 again !
Bring 10 bucks... INTV.... wow..
"Sturdy E-commerce SalesConsumers’ increased shift to online purchasing owing to the coronavirus outbreak seems to have worked in favor of the company. Costco operates e-commerce sites in the United States, Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Australia.The company’s e-commerce sales have been showcasing a sharp increase owing to the rising stay-at-home trend to maintain social distance amid the pandemic. We note that e-commerce comparable sales soared 91.1% for the retail month of October, the four weeks ended Nov 1, 2020. This followed an increase of 90.3%, 101.9%, 75.3% and 85.8% in the months of September, August, July and June, respectively."
"Suckers who think something is wrong with the company because if this pullback are first class fools. It's just valuation reasons and nothing more. The stock performance is just re-adjusting imho. This is Costco and by yrs end this will be well over $400! Mid $450's is my call. Forget the noise. And, as for Buffett unloading Costco? He's in a completely different realm than any of us are so he had his reasons."
Grocery store stocks take a beating on report that Amazon will launch its own chain of supermarkets - https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/01/grocery-store-stocks-take-a-beating-on-report-that-amazon-will-launch-its-own-chain-of-supermarkets.html
Associated Press is citing it as a eps miss on an adjusted basis. $1.61 adj eps vs $1.62 expectations and a slight beat on revenues! LOL dammm who to believe!
Wait for FIRE SALE.........................then start some buying.
I was just informed that Costco is closed today? I am BEYOND livid! I gave a lot of guests visiting for thanksgiving and I desperately need more wine. What kind is company closes ALL DAY on what would be a huge money maker? I guess I’ll take my money and business SOMEWHERE ELSE!
"I saw somebody returning a $2000+ patio set recently, nothing visibly wrong aside from it had obviously been left out in the elements since bought. At some point, Costco will need to put a stop to that nonsense. It's one thing to have a liberal return policy, it's another to let yourself be taken advantage of."
AMAZON going to need a LOT of monkies to buy bananas to make $$$$$ on the price reduction.
waiting for $285
Entire Dow & Nasdaq down 9% right now. COST off 4% from Friday close currently. I'd think this holds it's head up better than most and nothing to panic over. When this virus mess gets behind us...and it will at some point... COST will continue to be a winner...too good-and strong- of a company and much needed right now....hang tough is my take.
I have a crazy feeling they will beat estimates and guidance...
I have never in my life been inside a Costco. Ever. But I own several hundred shares of the stock for the dividend and couldn't be happier at the moment. Haven't felt this satisfied since buying AMZN at 650! Wish I had more of both but no serious regrets.
U WONT SEE THIS OVER 305 PROMISE U
well looks like my earnings trade is becoming a long position haha
"Costco is the worst stock to hold during earnings... unless you have sold options, then it’s really good"
"for all you people that believe in low PE go look at WYNN ,,that PE is insane but the stock is up 4 today,,, again,,, so PE is useful in your finance 101 class only"
"what suddenly the PE is no longer high,,,is that what they are claiming today,,,LOL...."
Told you to BUY the silly dips..............................................glad i did.
the earnings call is at 5 Eastern. anyone saying they know the earnings is a lying short
Earnings out.
GOD DAMNIT I CLOSED MY CALLS OUT FOR A $38K LOSS AND OF COURSE IT BOUNCES BACK! FKKKNKNLNLKN!!!!!
"the costco shareholders,can not see the true picture what is about to happen to thier stock prices..amazon, will be the master."
say goodbye to the last 2 days of nice earnings...tomorrow the dividend will get swallowed up
Fresh new highs...................better cover shorties..............
COST now offers free SAMPLING.............................................
where is red? loving that short at 113 still?
Amzn might offer 1 for 4 of cost
340 tmr! More institutions will join in dumping it tmr!
300.00-302.00come on down...........................................get BUY orders ready !
Line started outside my Costco at 7am again
"All good, all loyal, all good outlook = nothing when the entire market is getting creamed. If you're a 6-12 month + holder, wait for the near term dust to settle then load up."
And down she goes. 239 and falling like a knife. Cheerleaders are a little quiet today.
"After all, this will trade above $160 by next week."
earnings call..usually never good because wall st. expects impossibly things from Costco
COST and AAPL are considered cheap at this present level. Buffet says buy and hold.
BUY signal for COST on my end !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!300.00-306.00
Awesome earnings. Growing 15+% with brick mortar heavy model in thick of pandemic. Stellar.
Nervous
BUY orders are in !just waiting for more PANIC selling !
becoming a garbage stock
Love the smell of SHORTS BURNING............................
"@Anna in this 100% sure higher inflationary environment, COST business model is going to get boosted the biggest compared with WMT and TGT! Ppl reselling products from COST wholesale are accelerating worldwide, not just in the US! COST Chinese official website is empowered to satisfy customers throughout the entire country! In January, their new membership numbers are increased by 800%! If 2020 is an unexpected surprise for COST business, ️️️️ is an even huger boom for COST to surge to the next level on schedule!COST is going to announce the increase of their membership fee!"
"The report is that in Costco the lines are too huge and some items are out. Found that they cannot refill some itemsThis means people are stocking up supplies and do not want to shop in crowded areas.Some people I saw in some crowded areas are wearing masks.If this continues we will have problem.Hopefully it does not become serious Incase, just my thoughts.I am not sure how this affects cotsco supply and earnings will get affected, just Incase."
Look for the silly dips as a BUY opportunity.
FINALLY...THE PE IS NEARLY 34 EVEN AFTER THE 60 POINT DROP. DOES ANYONE THINK THIS IS STILL CHEAP ? BJ IS AROUND 14 A MORE MODERATE PRICE PE WOULD BE SAY 25 THAT WOULD ENTAIL THE STOCK UNDER 300. DOES ANYONE THINK MGT IS DOING A GOOD JOB THEN ? YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT THE STOCK IF IT GOES TO 275 ? INQUIRING MINDS WANT TO KNOW.
stock isnt what I thought
How much will this dog tank by end of day?
Packed today. My bill was $547.
OMG ITS A DISASTER.GET OUT NOW BECAUSE THIS WILL BE UNDER 200 TOMORROW
$10 plus today?
New target for COST238.00
GREAT BEAT!!!!!
"For the four-week reporting month of February, ended February 28, 2021, the Company reported net sales of $14.05 billion, an increase of 15.2 percent from $12.20 billion last year. For the twenty-six week period ended February 28, 2021, net sales were $93.16 billion, an increase of 15.4 percent from $80.76 billion last year."
My bright idea: Costco should be acquired by Amazon. I think the Whole Foods addition to Amazon was favorable and made sense. Adding Costco to the family would be a great advance!
GREEN
All aboard ?????train is leaving soonbetter cover shorties out there !
I think I heard that Jim will do a COST interview today on Mad Money.
"This will pull a CSX VERRRRRY SOON!! No sure what the trigger will be, but I have NEVER seen a stock this over bought in 25 years of trading."
Looks red
cost will rise ...bcoz since previous earning it is below its highest ......and analyst r bullish about cost ......335 is target price for cost .....e commerce is little negative but better yoy and sales r 6 percent above yoy and on top china usa deal will b done and no tarrif will b applied on 15th dec
$400 is coming but still it's only 12% of Amazon. Why? Not saying they should be equal but they should be closer.
315.00 next boys...........................
Will COST issue a special dividend of $9/share like last year?
so easy to make money on Costco
299.00-300.00Great entry point.
"If Target beat, COST will have blowout earnings. E-commerce is screaming. Forget Amazon."
PUT MASK ON TO ON IN STORE JOKE I SHORTED
BREAKOUT .......................330.00++++++
"Can I get ""COST"" shares at a discount if I buy then in bulk?"
299.00buyer
Sub $300 tomorrow.
COST sales and traffic are way down now. It will take months for people work off the hoard pile.
Blowout earnings numbers on Dec 13 send the stock soaring.
"Merry Christmas everyone! Regardless of if you are a day trader or long-term stockholder, I wish everyone safe and hope we would all come out of this COVID-19 intact. We have way too much conflicts and extremes; we all need to step back and work together. Let me take this opportunity and wish everyone Peace and Happiness. Stay Safe!"
I have LOVED Costco for 30 years. But I am DCA out of my position as the combination of Government regulations and horrid recent shopping experiences in store and online force me away for now. I just think a pullback is overdue.
You can see XLP stocks weakening after a bogas pop on the open....I bought back 5 of my PUTS after cashing out on Friday.....I think XLP chart wants to roll over.
"Great time to buy for a special $10/share dividend.If you have 100 shares, on Monday you make $1000."
Wonder if COST will jump into the WFM takeout game with a share deal. With it's high pe now may be a good time.
Costco continues to be one of the dominant warehouse retailers !Buy and HOLD heretarget 340.00-350.00
YES YES PICKED UP MORE SHARES AT LOWER PRICE THANK YOU GUYS
Dumped it for a loss today. Pick it back up sub 3.
"costco is a great stock, just heavily controlled by wall st. I joined AMC in hopes to get back at wall st. a little anyway"
most big companies doing 10%+ today. what a dog. smh. cmon
"How we will trust the EarningsIt,s a shame"
"Jim Cramer said AMZN can take on Costco's drug business.Oh, shiat."
"As shopping continues to shift away from brick-and-mortar stores to e-commerce, the worst days for traditional American retailers are ahead. There is no membership fee, parking, time and gas. Kirkland and Costco are too expensive with lousy services."
"all of the stimulus talk is over, nothing left to boost the market..back to reality now"
"here we go ...Costco's earnings hit by extra expenses from wages, cleaning amid coronavirus pandemic."
"We are getting in overpriced overbought territory here, be careful guys"
"To all of you who sold yesterday, you have my permission to make a double martini this evening-and then have at least two of those. Yesterday at 280ish was a chance to get back in at some reasonable number. A year ago this in the 230's and even the CornoaVirus, Oil going to hell, China a mess and the DJ falling 8000 points didn't take it down to anything close to those levels. Is 400 out of the question in the next 24 months considering all e growth, store growth, expanding to China etc. etc. etc. Just asking??"
It should be a good day for COST as well compared with TGT.
"FOR ALL YOU PERPETUAL DREAMERS OUT THERE WHO FEEL THE CONTINUED DROP IN COSTCO IS A GREAT THING, MIGHT WE ASK YOU THINK A 4 FOR 1 STOCK SPLIT MIGHT IMPROVE THE STOCK PRICE, HOW ABOUT A RETURN DIVIDEND ? A POSSIBLE BUY BACK OF STOCK ? NO ? YOU THINK CONTINUED RISING OF HOURLY WAGES FOR EMPLOYEES WILL BENEFIT THE STOCK ? HIGHER EXPENSES ? SOUNDS PERFECT. GREAT LOGIC !"
Market is pricing in an economic slowdown.
"To, The Leadership & Management Team of Costco, I will now on stop my membership and purchase in Costco until I see visible and noticeable Green initiatives from Costco that it has been so lagging as compared to Amazon and Walmart. Examples1) EV Charging points at Costco location do not exist and no plans for it announced. Walmart and Whole Foods already have many stores that offer EV charging.2) Warehousing and supply chain in Walmart and Amazon are going green with Electrification of delivery vans, Hydrogen forklifts, etc ramping up at a fast pace. Costco seems to be following old polluting energy technologies and no new plans announced yet.3) There is no clear public announcements on dollar amounts spend on green initiatives. Costco's website mentions few initiatives but seem more like a check mark and essay on procedural improvements with no clear definition on scale of projects. In contrast Amazon and Walmart have announced multiple projects in excess of billions of dollar for green initiatives.4) Costco does not have a published net zero carbon plan. Period.I request every users of Costco who believe in green and sustainable future for our kids and generations, please question, challenge and put pressure on Costco to wake up and show initiative. I will be watching and waiting to see before I resume purchase in Costco again.PS: I never owned Costco stock and neither have any plans in future to own it."
Must be very bad on the ER
Costco credit/debit machines were down for 30 minutes nationwide at peak time......that will hurt.
A grocery store with 42 PE ? What in the world is going on?
Why did I sell at the close??????
"Wells Fargo downgraded this stock and said it was overpriced. Do you believe them? Heck NO! They lied to their customers, so why would you believe anything they say? Buy COST and hold it. You'll be glad you did."
"why not email the ceo and let them know, they should have been buying back stocks..so hedge funds couldn't short this into oblivian..email them"
"Good ER in bad market, it will not go up for weeks"
Buying Costco now as this price is crazy cheap. Sales are going to kill expectations for the 4th quarter and this stock will jump big.
Be great to get COST in the 190's again like in mid December.
Crushed it. 330+ in a week.
"COST Technical:DMA 50 is sitting at $159.08 as today and has been acting as a weak resistance now. The reason it is a weak resistance is A) the DMA line is flat and it is not trending down B) COST has tried it a few days ago but it could not pass it. Usually, it is hard to pass it for the first time. Today, the price stayed close to it and since this is not the first time, it should break it today or Monday.After breaking DMA 50 around $59, there will not be any resistance until DMA 200 which is sitting at $161.79. Good luck, it is going up."
A lot of selling don’t buy yet it’s still on a downward trend wait until it stabilized I think would be around 149 or 150 ....
Straight from nasdaq website last 12 Qtrs when down after hrs.... 4(events) 80% percent chance next day also down so you commentors saying up tommorow well the nasdaq info odds don’t look very good. Just historical facts folks doesn’t mean it will stay down this time . I’ve got calls myself but hey I didn’t learn from May earnings they beat also and it dropped. Might be time for put spreads instead of call spreads. Lesson learned 2 times in a row is enough for me.
"If you don't BOYCOTT AMAZON you deserve to lose money on Amazon. If you have prime, cancel it when it is close to renewal time, otherwise, it will auto renew. This is a serious matter and if you don't take Amazon seriously, you will be losing. and it will be YOUR fault."
Costco reports after market close today. Should be welcome news
COST is down 4.92% to 278.71
"390.00""s coming up........................................"
Those who bought the dip will reap the rewards rest of the way !!!
back when the pandemic hit i panicked and sold a bunch of great stocks i owned...I sold 2000 shares of DE..only to buy 1000 shares of cost...look at DE it has doubled..Cost..has stayed stagnate...my biggest stock market blunder
Will get to 280 in a week but first it must drop
Once Biden wins Trump tards are going to looks pretty tardy
Costco is gonna shoot up! Special Dividend probably as well. Jump on board the Costco train folks
"Costco Wholesale Corporation make high bid offer buy out U.S. milk processor Dean Foods Co. Dairy Farmers of America Inc, the biggest U.S. dairy cooperative, is in advanced talks to acquire U.S. milk processor Dean Foods Co. But other would-be buyers could emerge.While discussions are taking place between DFA and Dean, no agreement has been reached for the purchase of all or some of the Dallas-based company’s assets, Monica Massey, executive vice president and chief of staff at DFA, said in an emailed response to questions. She didn’t speculate on prospective bidders.A deal could be a lengthy process, including an antitrust review. Any transaction would require an “extensive review of Dean Foods’ assets, thorough due diligence and other conditions, including approval from the Department of Justice and the Bankruptcy Court,” Massey said. Dean intends to file bidding procedures with the court to conduct a sale."
cost should raise the damn membership fees..and offer 1 share of stock..so the price doesn't plummet
The stock is overpriced so the earnings need to catch up with the stock price.
Shorty gonna burn. Burn baby burn.
Costco Wholesale is down 4.91% to 294.21
Tomorrow 300 plus again.
wait 2.08 on 2.02 estimate its a beat
If it is overvalued as Yahoo board say then what's a fair value?
wheres that special dividend?
can someone explain the drop today in COST?
Patience. Buy good quality!
A billion new members coming in China. Stock passes Amazon at $2000 per share.
ISS - EVA upgrades COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION from HOLD to OVERWEIGHT.BY Investars Analyst Actions - public— 3:10 AM ET 05/29/2020
"If it closes below 202, that’s a bearish signal."
this is the time to buy. This is the opportunity to take advantage of the over reaction that has happyend. I have bought more shares today adding to my position.
This is going up from here ($293)
People eat even during a virus. People are irrational.
Upgraded today by Opp. with an increased price target of 185.
I personally believe Costco will drop on earning because of the Mac D pattern on 1week and 1 month increments. When mac is in red on earning the stock seems to go down when it’s green it goes up. This earning Mac seems to be Red.
"still cant get the miss , can anyone tell me how its a miss !!!!!"
"COST , top pick for 2021Buy on any weakness here."
Earnings coming up early March. Stock will climb towards somewhere in the ballpark of $400 before earnings. Do your own research and you decide if you're going to keep it or sell before earnings.
Closed my position late yesterday at $313.25 after moving down my sell limit from $314. Would have hit that (and more in fact) so I left $1.25 per share on the table but very glad I got off this bus for now. Premarket and news looks ugly for the short term here.....
Waiting for340.00 to add
any thoughts on a split?
"Traffic at Costco is busy, so the monthly sales should be good,but I don't know how much good the market wants to see."
Market CRASH in the works......................Happy Santa...........................................
amazon effect is history. not that it ever made sense
COST is way Undervalued here ...............................look for any dips............... as buy opportunity.
all aboard !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!TRUMP Rule s!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DemoCRAPS fail.
Bought more yesterday.
not sure why this stock dipped below 300 business is still booming !
#$%$?? Crushes earnings and tanks... okkkk
Thumbs up if you ever see those losers in bright vests pushing shopping carts. Thumbs down if they seem invisible lol.
"Let's go to $340 this week, shall we? It's time for the rebound."
"Why I hold cost? Simple, just because it is the company who want to share their profit with their shareholders. So I invest in it, not speculate."
It’s actually opposite. Recession means more business for Costco as people look for savings. Bernstein is wrong.
Why did Costco stop selling Kirkland Scotch Whisky?
If you have weakness discovered in your it systems you put policies in place to stop it.There is no reason I can think of why the ceo needed to come out publicly about it.It makes me think there is something that he knows that forced him to publicly disclose this so that later down the road when it it reported he is not charged with some sec crime.. do you disagree ?
Buy buy buy
How is Costco's chicken farm doing any news?
"Eventually , the selling should be ending , there is no good reasoning why this selling is happening . These sellers must think the world is ending and amazon is going to save it and it won't happen ."
Correct...4 central

"So, let me get this straight...Trump caught a hoax?? (The man is an idiot.)They made the whole thing up to make it appear that he's super-strong and can beat any virus. Trump 'IS' the hoax."
We either bottomed today or tomorrow will be a key reversal day. This is an 80/20 setup
"As in everything, it's just the Law of Supply and Demand...As you hike membership fee, foot traffic to the stores will take a hit as more people will not renew.Same thing at baseball ballpark, if they start raising beer and hot dogs sky high, fewer people will come to the game.If Starbucks raise coffee drinks, foot traffic to the store will dwindle.same thing here at Costco. So Please go ahead and jack up membership fee to $200, $500, $750, etc. please and watch how your business will suffer"
At least 240 tomorrow

"COST is up nicely, time to jump in"
"Yeah, Trump knows what he's doing... thank God he does because if he didn't, the DOW might have really tanked today!!"
Okay. So it's the weekend and people go to Costco . Get a slice or a dog at the food court. Kid wants a sunday.. You wheel the cart through the amusement park and pick up your stuff. Sample the food. There are many worse places to shop and sometimes people just like getting out of the house.
Traders are selling on the news. Happens every ER. Have you ever been to a Costco that was slow?
this stock gonna go down atleast 10-20 points tomorrow. get ready!!
"Sell... get into the stocks that will actually rebound, not the 35 PE retailer with 3% growth"

"Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom reiterated a Buy rating on Costco on Monday, and raised his price target by $30 to $380 ahead of the report. He’s expecting core same-store sales (which excludes swings from gasoline prices and foreign exchange) to be up 13.5% in August, coming out this Wednesday."
I have been waiting to get in on this for a while. Do we think this will continue to decline with the recent news?
CRAMER says ..just OWN IT..dont trade it !
$120 is critical.. It has been critical.
Costco Wholesale reached an all time high at 373.46
I love my Costco stocks.
How about a 4 to 1 split so the small guy can buy some shares?
Special dividend ?
I think the retail market panicked because of the large drop resulting from the dividend. We'll see a lift soon. Probably tomorrow.
when did this become the presidential debate forum?
did we beat earnings ?
Well said

what's going on with cost stock? why is this going down?!!!
I agree with warren Buffett! AMZN will kill COST!
Looks like tomorrow is gonna be a strong day for the market and Costco is go up with it!:) I wouldn’t be surprised if it hits $400-$450 pps in this quarter
I expect a climb after call
COST breaking through all time highs.
$159 close
My 9000 shares @ $37 are safe. 3 special dividends paid off my house. HD @ 25$ has been a cash cow . AA @ 2$ has been great. Bought after 9/11. Will go higher unless sleepy J is elected.Buy stocks for the Long Term. You can sleep at night.
wait for 200.00 ??????
Keep dropping.
I have been in this company for 22 years and if anyone sells or tells you to sell they are wrong. I'm retiring a rich man because of costco so stay long investors.
Most customers were wearing mask anyway. This is just a none issue.
I HAVE CALLS THAT WXPIRES TOMORROW ASKHOLS!
GS still have price target of $176 for COST?
"Look for the silly dips, as buy opportunity here."
"Stock splits tend to dilute things although they do lower the barrier of entry for investors. Many companies have ceased stock splits as a preventative measure against dilution which in a way rewards future investors more than current investors. THe new apparent trend I have witnessed is stock buybacks and regular measured , predictable dividend increases in some large growth and many large value companies. CVX recent behavior of increasing the buy back amount from the failed APC / OXY bid serves as a primary example of rewarding current investors and as a ""pull / draw strategy"" for investors seeking to invest. I think the days of stock splits vs using supply / demand incentives are dwindling. COST's avg daily volume is 1.7 million shares - I hardly see them suffering stock price / volume wise from simply issuing a one time or boosting the dividend annually strategy vs using a split to attract new lower price point investors."
I sold this after special dividend at $372.
GREAT COMPANY GLAD I CAN BUY INTO IT SO CHEAP!NO WAY IT SHOULD GO DOWN AS MUCH AS A NASDAQ HI TECH STOCK!GO COSTCO!
People go shopping at COSTCO for Christmas.
I never thought I would agree with Cramer but...https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/19/jim-cramer-bernsteins-downgrade-of-costco-is-a-buying-opportunity.html
No reason for the stock to drop. The same BS as the rest of the market going down.
"I bet that you'd ""love that drop"" even more Grimmikins, if it dropped another $30/share.That way you could cover your imaginary short that you claimed that you made at $113.Gotta keep track of your fibs, Grimmikins."
Costco is up $50 over a year ago today and paid a $10 dividend. What's not to like!
"COST Holding UP like a CHAMP! Heading green soon, patience !!!"
anyone hear costco buy out DF?
Walmart has a better commitment to health and safety via than does Costco. Walmart and other retailers in my area have curb side pickup. Costco has not adjusted its physical plant to covid. Imam done with them.
I still think they are going to crush earnings
sooo... i was in a coatco in northern vermont yesterday and they had a steady stream of all booths in use to check people oit while i was there on a wed. i take that as a good sign ot was like 7pm
Just bought another 100 shares
Good news for Costco: https://www.yahoo.com/finance/news/chinas-retaliatory-tariffs-u-goods-161217354.html
Higher covid wages and sanitation costs killed earnings
Up over $15.00 if you add on after hours
Volume already over 6 month average and its only been 1 HR.
Should be between 240-260 in the coming months. Solid company
Don't let your shares be stolen. Big things coming. https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/us-retailer-costco-to-base-fifth-china-mall-in-shenzhen
"You wait to get in, you wait to check you, clean, great management, and they have great prices. What more do you want from a retail store!"
"Costco was $393 in December and today it’s $328?! Is this a buy point, or is it time to hit the exit?!"
"The Illuminati will not take the pressure off of the global Covid19 hoax. They will push it as far as they can, for as long as they can. As a result, floor traffic will continue to suffer, as the elite have decreed that only “essential items” are to be purchased. No furniture, big screen 4K TVs, tables, no fire pits, no outdoor furniture, no decorator carpets or wall art.. only toilet paper, food and water. Costco depends on impulse buying of high end stuff. With restricted purchasing rules put forth by Bill Gates and the elite, and also a certain number of folks allowed in store, dudes.. profits are going to fall off a cliff."
A visit to a Costco store tells me all I need to know.
As long as people push the Covid Lie. Costco may HIT 355.by NOV.
Hoping for $300 before the weekend. We can do it!
The dividend payable in August should have been declared in July. There has been no declaration yet. What happened to the BOD are they taking an extended vacation.
"I saw Shamus at the Costco he is referring to two posts below. He had his thumb in hisACE the entire time while he was staring at the women’s Calvin Klein sports bras. When he walked away, he started sniffing it."
Costco is in real trouble now. I'll wait to buy around 125.
"Costco should keep going up, the best is yet to come."
Waiting to add more 301-318.00
FILLED AT $324.75 !!! 400 shares
Costco is such an amazing company.! Makes money in any environment!!
"Coming in 2021 — All stores reopening to full capacity. Supply chains returning to normal. A new store opening in Canada, and possibly opening stores in the US and Canada. Reducing wages from the pandemic boost. More customers leaving the house to shop. All of this points to increased earnings ahead."
why is this stock down
Monday red
"so the question is,,,what is costco running on now"
The money I save on beer and gas pays for my membership at costco
The way Costco gets my money this should be priced like Amazon.
great day on the stock market...COST decided to not play
Nice shoutout from Dr. Cramer on CNBC just now
"Lol dude enough of this market, everyone else is rewarded for good earnings and im in on the one that tanks im so tired of this garbage."
was Costco's share price adjusted down $10 for the special dividend today?
COST is now like a COILED SPRING
bought more AMC stock
There are 2 dividend ex dates. today the 8th is the $7 day. you had to buy the stock yesterday to receive the dividend today. the stock is down $7 since the $7 dividend is subtracted from the actual stock price. If you buy today down #$%$ like getting the $7 dividend either way. you need to buy to buy by tomorrow the 9th to receive the .50 dividend on the 10th. the stock will drop .50 that day too. hope this helps clarify
"I'm confident in us longs, but I'm afraid of a pullback due to weak hands on a red day for the market"
"COST being held back by Institutions , waiting till they are done loading here @ cheap prices."
I’m going to Costco to cause chaos for everyone. Look out.
"Costco Wholesale Corp. said Wednesday its June sales rose 11% to $16.2 billion, from $14.6 billion in June 2019. Same-store sales rose 12%, including an 11% increase in U.S. same-store sales. E-commerce sales increased 86%, the company said. Costco sales in May rose 7.5% and online sales jumped 106% that month."
New all-time high today! Everyone snoozoing post-election?
cosco... great er when every one else is struggling... 400 on the horizon.
Boeing all the way ! Buy while it’s slow
Yeah it needs to but it wont
Way to look out for the shareholders paying these losers 16.00 an hour now..thanks a lot
I think COST will eventually become the winner after Krogers and Walmart banned gun sales to people aged 18 to 20.
COST China SOLD OUT on 90% of merchandise !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Special divi. in the works ?
A poor performing stock despite full parking lots. Every shopper buying low end products like toilet paper and paper towels.
"This one is tough to call, but I'm LONG for a small play."
"Compare total debt/equity ratio with Walmart,Costco."
COST and AAPLjut BUY and HOLD !your safest bet on this market volatility !
this stock has been flat ever since they announced the special dividend...wish they would have just did it
the Fundamental advantage Costco has over Amazon is the price of value. Amazon doesn't get that for the price of Whole Foods.
timmmmmmber
Who's ready for the annual earnings dumpster fire sell off?
When Buffett sold i realized I needed to get out and thankfully did. Love Costco as a store but sold on the premise you should never fall in love with your stocks. Costco is overpriced when you look at it's earnings. I'm doing great in Under Armour and you would think with all the sales Costco has done during the pandemic it wouldn't be falling off the cliff. I'll look to buy again when it drops to a more reasonable 200 to 260
Down another $4.42. High cost for virtue signaling.
All I'm saying is if you got a profit take it now or at least sell half your position. The way the market is now if this CFO says the least thing negative regarding FY guidance or challenging environment she'll drop just as quickly as she rose. Just my bit of advice fwiw! Every time I don't lock in a profit I get killed.
"Just got back from Costco, my happy place. Saving $45 from 280 total. Lunch , dinner is spoken for! Seldom see a grumpy shopper there. Been holding the stock at 151. The best store bang for the buck."
Who read it? Where did they lack? revenue? guidance? why the small drop?
UP UP and away.........................................E commerce up over 5%
"The sell-off of Costco is accelerating.......not a good sign at all. Brokerages will be out with downgrades in a few days, which will push Costco to at least $155 per share....Do the right thing, you do not want to have a sleepless weekend."
up up up andAWAY.............................. Target 348.00-365.00
A downgrade a day before earnings accomplished exactly what it meant to do.
"Unfortunately big margin items are still scarce in stores, Wine and Cheese. I will be a buyer at $275."
COST almost always a BUY on the silly dips.
Amazon went down after earnings not for lack of revenue but due to higher costs. Usually if revenue is fine and theres a good reason for the higher costs the bad earnings wont affect much
COST reached an all time high at 310.43
Thanks for the296.80look for silly dips...................... as opportunity.
"Ok, so are we at a bottom? The deal makers on the whlefoods deal have shorted costco and then they downgrade it. Something is wrong with that picture"
Used to love Costco but it has been range bound for weeks.
Looking good!
non essential items ban in alot of stores.
"Costco makes the majority of its money from membership fees. They barely skim profits off from goods sold, and thus customers are likely able to realize ROI from their membership fees in just a few trips. Even if they bump up the price by a few bucks for the first time in several years, that won’t change.Their renewal rate is 90%. With that kind of loyalty, I doubt such a move would be dangerous at all.Honestly, as both a member and an investor, I kind of hope they go through with the increase."
Looks like the future of Costco is building bigger parking lots. Members can't get enough of this jewel.
Why down? Any concerns. Long at 310
Tanking
welcome back....
why drop everyday?
2$ more an hour lololol
"What's going on with Costco stockDid I missed anything?Dividend raised? Split,s ?Special D?Amy info I ,LL appreciated."
Should do a 3 for 1 split. Follow Apple and Tesla
Relax....
$325 by the end of next week.
With earnings way up there could be a special dividend. Last time was I think $5
Still waiting this mass selloff all the bashers promised was coming. This is not a propped up stock. It’s trading at pre covid levels. I hope you all get burned bad. Tbh.
looks solid at this level
"Look at the volume Volume 3,868,020Avg. Volume 2,597,675It will be pop up."
"12/26/18 Costco stock took to big upward gains after being suppressed a bit, (like this yr.) Like to see that repeated next Thur. 26th of Dec. again."
COST IS WAY OVERSOLD ....RECOVERY IS BEGINNING AT THE END OF THE DAY LONGS WILL BE REWARDED HANDSOMELY
The sales numbers must be good. Up 5 AH.
"Rock solid numbers expected. Seems like it was years ago, not just months, there was chatter about a special dividend this year. Whether luckily, wisely or both, looks like COSTCO Management played it perfectly. Long COST"
"I guess since neither 'Funue' (Mr. Death) and 'Bert' cannot explain how they arrived at their 'two' different areas of support, we can all just disregard what they post.Pity, too. I was looking forward to learning from them both!"
"MM""s walking it down lower, let them bring it ON SALE for you ..then BBBUUUUYYYYYYY"
Amazon NO competition for COSTCO..................................live and learn shorts............................
I hope someone bought E W L L on my notification...
"called ,^$20 earlier today...let's go buy buy"
This company will continue to grow into its valuation as it might be the best manage company out there. I have watched it for far to long and right now is as good as it gets for buying.
Love the sale prices here.....................
2% cash back on Executive Membership just about pays for itself for us
"Large call options were bought , should be up couple of $ today"
this has to dump tomorrow..its been too good this week
Sold today at a loss.. >:(
strange drop. why?
Costco employee from head office in Seattle died from COVID-19 on Sunday. RIP.
The Market will turn GreenCost will fly
"The downturn in this stock has been nothing more than year-ending profit-taking after a substantial and very successful year for COST. Traders on the Street (for the most part) are already gone (with bonuses in-hand) for the holidays and will not be back before January 7th. Until then, all conclusions based on trading are simply artificial. This occurs every year during the holidays. The triple-bottom remains in-play."
"All the talk of a special dividend raises interesting thoughts. I bought a few thousand shares in the mid 1990s at a single digit cost basis and have recovered all my cost basis from the dividend payments. Dividends now pay the same tax rate as capital gains. I like the dividends better than stock buybacks by the company because I can invest that money in other stocks that will now potentially produce higher returns than Costco stock would produce. Costco is now a relatively mature company so its annual rate of return is nice, but it is not a rate of return of a quality growth company. Buying back stock means that a company can't find an internal use for that money which will generate a higher return than its mature growth rate. A special dividend is a way to ""sell"" Costco stock without actually selling and using that frozen capital appreciation to redeploy into a potentially more lucrative investment. Yes, you have to pay the income tax, but hopefully using the remaining dividend money will produce returns that will compensate for the tax bill. The only way to avoid the tax on your appreciation is to die and have your heirs get a step up basis at the date of death fair market value. That is an outcome I prefer to avoid. I wish more companies would utilize special dividends rather than stock buybacks which don't always work out if the stock price falls below the buyback prices."
$312 ok to buy at?
MUTED DOCTOR_MONEY !! Math genius....tanking for him IS 1% ! LOL
Will earnings make $COST jump??
I would have to say COST earnings is gonna shoot up because of how crazy China is. It's like black Friday busy everyday there. Buying calls at open tomorrow.
I sold this at 320!right before th pandemic and thought I was a genius a month later. Then I felt like a moron when it hit close to 400. Buying back in too good to pass up.
Nothing happening in the AH so far
Who's minding the algorithms shop? This is just flipping amazing.
Why the huge price drop ... Is it just earnings related or ? Seems like a good value opportunity right now?
drum roll !!!
this stock is only a $295-305 stock..that's it..it goes up nice...and the just dumps
climbing 288 .......hop it will touch 295 today
economy killed it. red today. green Monday. load up
375-378.0 time to do some BUYING......................................
All time high today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
costco is on sale you guys should buy
well i put in a sell order at 179.75 GL ALL!!!
back to new highs soon.
I don't know it was that said the Chinese people like being a part of a membership because it has some social status attached to it but this just a lot of hot air. There is no truth to it. I see that after just one day (1 day) people here are already jumping to wild conclusions expecting Costco to fly through the roof by expanding throughout China. You have all forgotten the lessons taught by Sam's Club who has been in China for 20 years and still only has 26 warehouses.I hope Costco does well but I'm realistic. It will be a long and slow uphill battle in China. The next frontier in about 2-3 generations will be India.
$300 coming soon...this stock is not the hype you think it is
I Wish Trump Would Purchase The Denver Bronco's And Make Them Great Again!
"I love people that have probably been on unemployment or “working from home” complaining about these people getting raises. You’re right, screw the workers. It’s all about the stock . It’ll go back up. The entire market is taking a pounding. Everyone handed out raises? You people are selfish and disgusting tbh"
Crashing hard...this will be under $300 tonight for sure
"THIS is the company that's revolutionizing the way people shop - not Amazon - not Walmart. ""Why?"" you might ask. Well, they're in business of TRULY saving the consumer money. And as a complete non sequitur, there are clear and distinct reasons as to why we see Kirkland products on display right next to the products they emulate. Kirkland's products are second to none. Still wasting money on Procter and Gamble? Okay."
"The rout is on, finishes under 215"
"Did some research today. It looks like Costco will drop a little more before coming back up. At the end of the year it should be over 400. However, only God knows what will happen."
Stock ripping .Where is BallSack ha ha ha ha !
Down $9 on Avg. Volume = NO BUYERS.
Will be green tomorrow. Very nice report 
315.00-318.00hope you loaded on the dips.............
"Trading above $390 pre-market. Getting expensive for those wanting special $10 dividend, opportunity missed."
seems like target is the only stock in this sector doing good
I was wrong... I predicted $150 before $170 when it was around $165 a while back. Congrats to those who disagreed with me.
In Costco store today. Very thin shoppers. Mask requirement cutting into business sharply. Gone is any high end shopping as people are buying basics. Still holding some shares after selling most a couple months ago. Deli and 5 dollar chicken is not bringing them in.
"Only reason this stock went down after hours is because of incorrect articles from Yahoo, Routers, MT Newswire, and PR Newswire. It started the sell-offs in the AH, and made them even seem worse during conference call."
TRUMP will be out for next election vote below please
stock market not a good place right now
"Looking good @ #320.65 AH, tomorrow it will jump nicely.I sure love my Costco shares :-)"
I bought this DIS and CONN
this stocks it’s very interesting. If are careful you can consistently easily make 1% per day.
not a good time to own costco stock
"According to current NASDAQ analyst consensus estimates, COST currently trades for a very expensive ......27x.....(19E) of 7.67. Why is this concerning ? Analysts currently have COST growing earnings by only......13%.... from (18) to (19).On the other hand.....ATRS currently trades at just 2.62/sh and has the following analyst consensus estimates on NASDAQ:ATRS 2.62/sh (19) .06. (20) .24 (21) .43COST 208.71. (19) 7.67 (20)8.20 (21)9.01As you can see above, ATRS is a 80%+ grower trading for just ...10x....(20E) and at only...6x...(21E)COST is an excellent company but unfortunately is a bad stock based on current analyst consensus estimates on NASDAQ.Finally, if ATRS just trades for 20x forward estimates, ATRS is a $8-$9/sh dollar stock 2 years out.Good luck to all "
"amazing and consistent stock. Yet, I feel that its value has ballooned a little bit too much. Last year's 3rd quarter was where COST experienced a earnings miss and I feel the same here. That being said, although I would rate shares a hold short term I see this as a great long term growth company. It's a genius business model starting especially paying employees higher wages to experience very low turnover. This combined with future growth in the recent Chinese market makes it a truly unique growth stock."

"Look at the nudges selling off the stock after a good report. I hate the fake rigged stock market or the people who ""play"" it. I do not like what I have become either!"
"Costco has always had a reason for avoiding forward splits but it's one subject they do not enjoy talking about. However, with the price nearing $300/shr. and a recession looming in the near future, they need to be seriously thinking about it. If they did decide to split, I don't think they can afford anything less than a 4-1. And, with their current future outlook, the time is ripe for a forward split. With a 4-1 right now they're still a $70/shr. stock. I can see that doubling to $140/shr. in less than one year. The value that provides to shareholders far exceeds any special dividend they could offer today. If you had 100 shrs. prior to the 4-1, after you would have 400/shrs. at $70/shr. a double in less than a year to $140/shr. would then produce an additional $28,000 value to your position. The strength of a forward split cannot (and should not) be under-estimated. It is an aggressive move and one that Costco is certainly in the right position to substantially increase shareholder's value.However, anything less than a 4-1 would really not be taking full advantage of the current (and future) position of this company. I certainly hope management takes a forward split into serious consideration. At this stage of the game, it's a win/win for all involved.Also, if they opt for a split and not a special dividend, they should at the very least increase their current dividend by a substantial number. For the purpose of this split analysis I have not considered the what this dividend should be."

if only i got Puts before earnings Godamit
"My opinion is that someone is fighting very desperately to hold this stock at or below the $ 190.00 level . If it gets past that , it's on it's way up ."
New highs!
Bail now!!! This is going to crash below $300 tonight! You have been warned
Don’t worry about this stock. It is a constant climber. Earnings will be good and it will continue its climb.
Time to make some easy money.

tomorrow will touch 300 plus
gonna give back that $5.75 we made yesterday..thats how this stock works
COST is in a great place to have a great quarter. haven't seen a COSTCO empty and the sales have grown higher in the pandemic with people stocking and getting the right value from these stores.Looking forward to a great Q results
250 by Apr. 1
North of 300 will be the time to accumulate in my opinion
"At a PE of 41, I don’t think it’s a good buy yet. I’ll just keep waiting."
They have had all the benefits of never closing and yet are below their 52 week high. Up year to date but happy I sold and found greener pastures.
"I don't believe AMZN has such an impact on COST, yet today's correction is well expected and justified. COST may easily recover the loss in the coming weeks, as the overall market sentiment still intact.Congrat those puts buyers."
what happened to the 10 a share dividend

"COST needs to open up 100 stores next month, if it can. Don't forget that China has 1.4 billion population. The thing that COST surprises me is WMT is not successful. The viral clip of the customers try to get everything from the shelf promoting COST itself, may be the Chinese tourists who come to visit the US store may spread the words that COST is the cheapest store in US., that is why we see the video clip. I bet you that clip will be seen more than 100 million times by this week. It is just so funny."
"I bought at 377, should i average down before earnings? Any suggestions"

Money managers............. loading up on COST
st look for the silly DIPS....................to add here.
Nice close ...being setup for fresh new highs.
they have been open the entire time of covid-19 Evan with relaxation and they still can't get back to their 52-week high. spending too much time and resources on covid-19
why is it dropping?
Very simple folks.... Costco was shown on the evening National news with 174 employees testing positive in Yakima WA. The teaser at the beginning included Target but not mentioned during the story. The news controls every part of the stock market.
"Well, my cash register keeps ringing....cashed out again this morning and am PRAYING it pops back to $268............looking to target PG now....that bloated pig trades at a PE of 24 and is UP from $70....what a joke THAT IS!!!!! Bought XLP PUTS where PG is the largest % holding."
Cost earnings will be great. Have you seen their stores and website lately? They are out of stock of many items all through pandemic and very recently. Above all they have lot of international growth ahead of them. And super loyal customer base who pays to shop there.
Trump's trade war will kill them next qtr. So much of their stuff is from China that is being 25% tarriffed.
Buy and hold
Hope you buying theSILLY DIPS !325.00 soon
"For decipels, this has become a target for shorts...good luck."
Cant understand why company didn't issue a special div yet.
Sorry without 20%+ growth this does not deserve a 30 pe crazy how high the market metrics are these days.
Up or down after earnings and what price are y'all estimating?
Buying more!
Sales doubled passed three months and stimulus and unemployment will be factor in this quarter
"I went to COSTCO yesterday in California to stock up some food, guess what, I got the last bag of rice and bottled water. People is certainly in the slight panic mode. I did go to Walmart to buy more bottled water. In CA you need to prepare for the earthquake anyway, might as well stock up. Long COST, will add position when the pull back stabilized."
"Most on this board are very naive. Amazon wants all the business. BOYCOTT AMAZON NOW. The only way to hurt Amazon is deprive them of sales. BOYCOTT AMAZON. I personally wont buy anything from Amazon. I am not going to help the enemy. If you say, ""I will just buy this little old thing from Amazon"", you are part of the problem. You deserve to lose money on Costco if you support Amazon."

Flat......nothing to see here. Red tomorrow.
"I love Costco so much. Every time I go in it seems to be busier and busier, no sign of stopping. It's practically shoulder to shoulder when I go in even after waiting in a long line outside! Their prices are unbeatable and quality of product and services offered are excellent. I bought 10 shares yesterday and I can't wait to see where this business goes in 2-5 more years."
"Such a dumb headline: Costco Shares Slide As Coronavirus Expenses Offset Solid Q4 EarningsOf course they are gonna have covid expenses, AMZN spent billions on covid. Ridiculous."

Why no movement???
"If tomorrow isn't down a lot, will definitely buy put options strike price $270 again for 1 to 3 months out to hedge for the long positions in COST."
"if they are out, then post the results"
Come on $300!
A major downgrade yesterday for Costco. The bleeding will extend way further.
This is where the hedge funds and institutional investment houses are picking away little by little so it doesn't shoot straight back up..

stock market up nicely today..disgraceful stimulus checks on the way...and costco sinking again...
when will COST release its ER ? 4th or 5th? AH?
"Hairbag: I'm informed that in the last few weeks retail day traders are shorting as well as going long - playing both ends of the trade, causing a lot of this volatility. The price movements have not much to do with the actual value of Costco but more to do with a quick in-and-out. It will be settling down eventually so be patient and hang in there....hurry up and wait! Lol!"
went to costco today. no line up in the door and hardly any wait at the till. people stocked up and arent buying anything but necessities which they have already stocked up on. groceries are low margin. I love costco but im not banking on a great quarterly earnings report

COST should not be down under any circumstances

"James,You seems little nervous. Go ahead and sell your 20 shares and deposit into Local Bank CD account."
COST introduces Apple Pay. Big deal towards lowering average age of shoppers.
Is there a reason this stock has been declining? Seems like a strong company that will fully recover after the pandemic.
"Not the right forum for this and pointlessto ask again but, please, Costco, bring back the Polish dog and fire the God damned do-gooders who think it is their right to make me eat what they think is good for me. I eat a well balance, nutritious diet most of the time, exercise and keep my weight appropriate for my height. I don't need Costco nannies to tell me how to live. Damn it, when I go to Costco I want my little trat of a Polish dog."

"Costco has loyal shoppers and a lot of shoppers over lap with Amazon because they are successful people who can pay to shop at Costco and can pay for Prime, but Amazon will hurt costco---not immediately, but PLAN AHEAD. Don't just take the ""wait and see"" approach. Be proactive. BOYCOTT ALL AMAZON. Cancel Prime when it comes due. It will auto renew if you don't. Don't buy anything from Amazon to help them destroy all the retail industry from the Macy's of the world to theCVS's Amazon will do pharma once it gets physical stores. I would bet money that the first pharmacy will open within 6 months after Amazon gets Whole Foods and that will take some of Costco's business. BOYCOTT AMAZON NOW."
"Costco has built such a loyal customer base - one of the best. People shorting this stock either have not been to a Costco or have no idea why people enjoy this place so much. It separates itself from other retailers due to its loyal customer base, which is why it's a complete growth stock with a continued successful future. I would like to see the stock split though, making it more appealing for the lower end investor."
safe to buy up to 260
look for the SILLY dips.. as BUY opportunity..................................

Mark this comments. It will go up after 10:30. Volume look too low for shortie to short this stock. It will turn green by closing.
$320 Close tomorrow guys... :(
All time high today. It is on its way to 300 this year plus the special dividend. GO COST
"I think after AMZN , Costco is a brand company with brand like kirkland ."
"Go all in to this stock. Next year, you will be a millionaire.Any prices around 290 are the buy. Don't wait too long.The longer we must deal with the corona virus issue, the better Costco stock price will be."
This stock will become a safe haven for many investors in light of trade wars. Give it another week and watch it go up....
"Every Costco store I go to has a ton of people in it. During a pandemic. During the time when a lot of businesses that buy wholesale at Costco are closed. The members in the stores have regular shopping carts - they are retail customers who will remain customers after the pandemic. As the country starts to open up and businesses start to open up, I expect to see a lot more business owners, stocking up wholesale, with piles and piles of product on those huge flat carts. I think COST is oversold and their prospects are looking up. Going to buy a few shares today and tomorrow."
any comment on the $4b offering?
Buyer220.00
Someone bought 1K shares in after-hours at $375.10. That's a nice chunk of change. COST should excel nicely next week when shorts are forced to cover.
There will no longer be a special

great ER and results. still very high P/E in this environment. it needs to cool off a bet to planet earth. never forget the fundamentals
"can someone with true knowledge just explain why the stock price is dropping? huge day yesterday, and its red...is it because it's expensive? The business seems to be there.."
numbers are good or not?
"If you look at the chart of Costco this is the largest percent correction in five years in excess of 15%. Each time the stock has bounced back and made new highs, it looks like late 2016 to me. This is the fourth time in two years that we have had a substancial correction not exactly uncommon. Costco like Amazon has a cult following that will not exactly abandon them overnight. They both have a base revenue stream from the membership revenue. Markets overreact all the time and I believe this is one of them The stock is a good buy at this price. This is a very high-quality company. I have been a member at Costco for a long time and the thought of the abandoning them to go shop at whole foods because Amazon bought them has not even crossed my mind. In fact whole foods got so ridiculously expensive that it will take a lot for me to even go back in that store. In addition these acquisitions will take a lot of time to close and for them to put their stamp on whatever they're going to do with Whole FoodsJust my thoughts"
Hi
As I mentioned last week(5 days ago)when Costco was at $156 Costco will go over $160 and please feel free to check. My call for Costco this week is to close at $165-$168.Have a great week trading.
Costco....get curbside pickup going!
COST and AAPL just own it dont trade it.
"I think COST is a good buy today at this price, tomorrow monthly number comes out over 9 % again."
"Question: What if we buy 1000S of Costco today, just to be on record to get 1k dividends ...and cash it out 2-3 days later, do we still receive dividends?"
biggest day in a long long time..expecting costco to shine...but no another let down..how did this ever make it to $325
Will buy some shares today. ..well managed company
Sell for Frsh now because you are overspending on this stock
why cant costco be a 400 billion dollar company like walmart.
I read that some people think Costco will go below $300. lol...not gonna happen. We're touching the final bottom and this selling is an eye blink away from reversing upward.
News is they are gonna start paying people $16 an hour what most people don’t know is people who work at Cost mostly for years and most of them make more than that anyway￼
may buy under $200 next week
Falling into earnings means we will pop to $230. Bet
"COST at $316 is still way cheap. Just back track and look at what all the analysts had written written when price was at 12/14/2020@ $373, OVERWEIGHT. ""Basically, if an analyst rates a stock as “overweight,” he or she thinks that the stock will perform well in the future, and believes it is worth buying—it could outperform the broader market and other stocks in its sector."" Which it has with it's earning report, 14%"
Weak hands getting flushed out and stop limits hit by MM. Back to $305-$310 VERY soon...
"Seeing Targets beat definitely raises my expectations for COST this Thursday. I shop at both locations and if I'm going to Target its usually for 1 or 2 specific items only. But when I go to Costco, I always end up with a cart full of things plus a hotdog and a soda I didn't know I wanted."
Barron's ran a Pump but check your charts. Best buyin is late October yearly.
"hey red, I like this rite aid call, 5.01 LOLOL try 4.73 today LOLOLOLBut Rite Aid stock slid 4.2% to 5.01, the lowest since October 2014 and extending a sharp recent sell-off."
"Order imbalance, market maker had to buy at $152.75 to settle."
"If the US has only just started a recession that could last for a year or more, Costco could see a noticeable increase in membership cancellations. Confirmation when the company reports their next quarter earnings & guidance on June 4th."
"Here is the proof, Costco traffic exceptionally much higher than WMT, TGT and Whole Foods.All 4 stores are about in 1 mile of each other in Tustin/Irvine California. This Sunday, I around 1 O'clock PM, I checked all 4 stores.1- The most crowded one was Costco with 20 cashiers serving average of over 10 customers at any minute.2- Most Whole Food customers were buying/eating lunch and some customers buying selected groceries.3- WMT and TGT were not empty either but customers were not buying big items.4- Costco was the cleanest and the most specious place to go around and enjoy shopping.5- The worst one was WMT with unorganized isles.6- Price wise, Costco was the cheapest.7- I also got GAS from Costco and paid about $0.50 less per gallon. We purse about 100 gallon of gas from Costco and save about $50 per month or $600 per year. This is nice to pay for our membership. We earn another $800 on our VISA card plus all the saving from our purchases at Costco. We are getting quality merchandises at lowest prices.8- I like some organic items at Costco. I think Costco has started to increase its organic products.9- Costco private brand, Kirkland is expending.I want to see more foods and restaurants at Costco even if the prices are higher."
Sel sel sel
Anyone know how this stock will react to the earnings call?
Low Volume = manipulation in price.look for DIPS as another opportunity here.
very disappointment stock
"I LOVE that Costco on their website has stated that items that cannot be returned are Costco is not accepting returns on specific items, including: Toilet paper Bottled water Sanitizing wipes Paper towels Rice Disinfecting sprayVery very nice!!!"
"I think everyone has a limited amount of money to invest, and Mr. Buffet is no exception.First, I'm sure, he didn't know about special divident, and secondly, he sees more upside somewhere else."
"""Pullbacks in this high-quality wholesale - especially on forced S&P 500 selling/broader market weakness - are long-term buying opportunities,"" said Jim Cramer and the Action Alerts PLUS team, which holds Costco in its portfolio."
short. does anyone agree?
Blowout earnings Thurs. and special dividend announcement.
1M chart looks dire. Sell.
Bought this falling knife recently at 330. Will buy more after it reaches the floor. The pandemic bubble that this stock enjoyed this past year is winding down. It was unsustainable. Much more reasonably price priced now.
Probably drops under 200 even with good earnings which are irrelevant in this market.
"Grimmikins, I just knew that you'd poke your pointy little noggin out of your Mom's house today to celebrate that ""massive drop"" in COST so that you could tell one and all how ""you told us so"".Unfortunately (you won't discuss it), you been warning everyone since $113, where you claimed to have shorted it. So, simple math (don't bother undoing the Velcro to take off your shoes and socks), that leaves you $57/share underwater, even with today's drop.In short, you're a sailor-suited, Momm-moochin', Joey-infatuated Illiterate DumDum that couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with a 12ga. if you were standing inside the barn."
it was a GREAT Q buyer on weakness here.
Great Earnings!
"Amazon vs. CostcoRecently a study from BMO Capital Markets tried to get to the heart of another shopper debate: Is Amazon or Costco a cheaper place to shop? The results were fairly surprising: After comparing prices for 54 common items at Amazon, Costco, and Costco.com, researchers found that physical Costco stores generally had the lowest prices, followed by the retailer's own website and then Amazon. Overall, prices were 17% cheaper at Costco.com than they were at Amazon, and prices for national brand items were 19% cheaper at Costco.com compared to Amazon."
"Costco is indicating that some analysts and Cramer are dead wrong.Renewal rates are stagnant because of a credit card switch, and management believes these issues are short-term in nature. After all, the same thing happened in Canada, where a similar switch in fiscal 2015 caused renewal rates to drop a full percentage point. Today, renewal rates in Canada are higher than they were pre-conversion. The same thing will likely happen in the US. No red flags here.Meanwhile, the new member sign-up rate is slowing almost exclusively due to timing. Simply, the more warehouses Costco adds in new markets, the bigger its sign-up rate. The positive takeaway here is that the trend of 60,000 new members per new opening remained intact in the fourth quarter. No red flags here.Memberships per location are falling mostly due to cannibalization. The opening of a new warehouse near an existing warehouse adds to the overall membership base and adds about $80 million to $100 million of new annual sales in that market, but it also dilutes the per-location membership figures by about 10,000. That is a risk worth taking considering the incremental revenue add. Again, no red flags here.Finally, Costco is unquestionably behind in the delivery game, but it doesn’t really matter. Just look at sales and traffic trends. Comps are strongly positive and trending up. Traffic is strongly positive and trending up. Clearly, Costco hasn’t needed delivery yet to drive positive top-line trends. The value prop of an affordable and convenient all-in-one shopping destination is more than enough.Nonetheless, Costco is upping its game in the delivery market. Maybe the moves are defensive, but maybe they are just another growth opportunity for this retail behemoth. After all, it’s not like comps and earnings are falling and Costco has its back against the wall. Considering how robust the growth numbers are currently without great delivery operations, the delivery roll-out feels more like an offensive move than a defensive one"
"202 was the key and it stayed above so that’s bullish, read my posted below.Next week is key. If it pulls away from 202, then we are likely out of the down turn and 202 will now be the support. If it drops on Monday then 202 will be the resistance"
remember $358 2 wks ago
The only people making money on this stock are the overpaid employees

King Amazon pulling everything down. I am OUT. Not worth the chance ER according to Cramer means nothing when selling is the trend.
it will go up ..as we r already down more then 6 percent from previous high
best long term investment there is
Bought another 100 shares. honestly long term you can never lose. The Quarterly didn’t account for this week..
When will volume pick up?
"Keep in mind that it's largest shareholder, Warren Buffett left the stock before this quarter, even knowing that there was a special dividend that was going to be offered since he had a seat on the board. I think smaller gatherings around the country for the holiday seasons leads to produce traffic at Costco. Without this traffic they cannot upsell them on all the last minute things people typically purchase there when roaming the aisles. this is the reason Costco has been slow to adapt to a delivery model."

First time I've ever done this after earnings.. I'm an option trader and got burnt pretty bad this week with all my calls expiring worthless. But i doubled up and bought $445 calls for next week and am feeling very confident!
"Costco down, ...great!... buying some more, I can't see someone packing my fresh produce. Amazon is great for shopping on a wide range of products, and I will continue to use it....Costco gives me the opportunity to look/feel and in some case taste what I am buying...two different stores...I can see more smaller stores, that have carved fresh produce deliveries, lose some of their business to AMZN."
"Amzn is no longer the lowest price on many items I have bought, lately. Don't be taken by the companies that are downgrading amzn. This is a typical wall st. scam, the opposite of pump and dump: cry and buy. They are pushing it lower so they can buy a good company on the cheap. They know that the amzn threat is overblown we are getting close to 52 week low. They will push it there, then buy and sing costco's praises."
Moving past 400 soon

"I went to Costco on Friday. The line at the cashiers' was too long. I rushed home. On Sunday, I went back, and the lines were worse. I needed to buy a few things still. I spent $350. I thought: to hell with the Amazon story. This morning, I added shares and calls, and i'm smiling broadly. I'll sell the stocks at $170."

The Costco spring is wound too tight. Gonna launch well over $315 at some point sooner than later...
Well that was a swift kick in the nuts today.

BS downgrade. Bernstein is a moron and has no clue. He admits to missing the run up over the past few years. He’s probably loading up now.

I have never heard from such an informed message board. Dividend is payable tomorrow. How many times must that be repeated over and over. How could those who are informed invest in this market!

"Costco on line is open for non-essential items, also we can shop online for produce and grocery's Costco best deal on the glove, did I hear they're opening a second Costco in China?Oh oh! I hope they'll do social distancing."
Finally Up
"Once consumers have enough toilet paper and canned tuna (Kirkland is the best) they will stop shopping. They are not buying a tv, camera, prepared foods, or other luxury items. Sales will slump."
"Costco announced the quarterly dividend on 8/13, payable on 9/13. But no special dividend which is typically announced with the quarterly dividend. Could they be holding it back because of the possible recession and self-inflicted trade war with China?"
let's get that ^$20

PE getting rich...
Costco Wholesale is down 4.92% to 366.70
I belive Costco will report increased sales and earnings. I also think this will be the last time increased sales will be reported as the previous years numbers harbor the pandemic induced panic buying. Though earnings should remain strong. A lot of whiners have complained of the wage increase. At Costco (as most places) very few hourly estimates are at the base wage. If you have worked at Costco over six months you have advanced on the pay scale. Small minded individuals are complaining of the $1.00 per hour raise the vast majority of Costco workers received. since they rescinded the covid combat pay ($2.00 per hour) received for the past year it is actually a pay cut. this will undoubtedly contribute to earnings.
COMPS UP 7% !!! Earnings BEAT. BUY BUY BUY
what is wrong with our stock?
"Free delivery on orders over 35.00 plus tip to the driver. Wife has avoided going shopping in public. I'm happy camper, the M&M's are on the way. Just have to stay long with COST."
Every storm ends and I'm convinced that we're very close to hitting the bottom. Nothing fundamentally wrong with this company so don't worry. It's down $50 or 12% down from its highs which Isn't much on a grand scale. Patience is a virtue.
if Costco would only get toilet paper back in stock 
"Wow i am very surprised that this didn't sky rocket like Nike, walmart, Target, Aapl, Kroger, Carrier, etc.... What a joke."
"Masks ok but why not gloves too? Touching all that stuff in there then get in your car, take your mask off and touch all over your car. Head scratcher."
Told youBUY THE SILLY DIPS..................................
"It seems to become more and more frequent that every time a company releases good earnings, the share price collapses..."
Costco stock falls on sales miss; retailer says it found 'material weakness'
wow. whats up with COST? WMT or BABA planning to buy COST ? What explains this sudden interest ?Never thought would break even in one day! Loving it.
Lots of BIG BOYS buying today
"The special dividend ($10) is supposed to be paid for holders of COST today.Tomorrow, Dec 3 is ex-div date for the special dividend and not today."
This stock is going up $6 minimum after Q4 earnings report.
"Costco Building going up in busy shopping district in North East Davenport,Iowa"
Dead Stock on a day w a 600 point rise
cosco is making good money.. this is only down cause estimates were wrong.. not cause performance was bad
I bet my entire 401k on Costco after the experts down graded them after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Thank you Costco.
"i make a lot purchases on Amazon. But there is no way that Amazon can compete based on shipping costs the absolute efficiency of driving ones SUV and loading up a monster cart with everything you need. I didn't think I needed Costco until last month when I saved a ton of money on New mattress, in addition to my regular purchases of nitrate free Turkey bacon, chocolate covered almonds, and don't forget that independant anaslysis of fake olive oil shows Kirkland brand organic olive oil is much better quality than what whole foodies selling."
"Moody's article out stating amazon actually weaker than Costco, walmart even best buy. Amazon while dominant in e-commerce, e-commerce only is 10% of retail. and their growth has been at the expense of profit. a good read."
Costco stores are full no matter what time of the day you go!!Looks like it be a record breaking quarter
I lost $1500 in stock values while I was in line at Costco
Falling knife. 182 is next resistance.
"Don't give up on COST so easily! In addition to being a good long-term investment, its fundamentals are quite solid for this quarter, which indicates that there may still be a correction and a good appreciation in the short term (before the earnings date, March 4)."
"Who the Fud Duck is selling at this price??? Why? Great price, super company who is making Money! $170 in 2 weeks!"
Just put $30k into costco stock and let it sit for the next 10 years and also too moved all $140k of my 401k into costco stock hopefully when I retire 15 years later costco will double that amount for me to pay off my house

well I did it...sadly I sold everything time to move on..I bought at $275 a while back..so above water...but costco my favorite...but the company needs a new CEO and they fail to see that
What time is the earning report?
Ill be holding Kirkland toilet paper for the next 12 years :)
"Believe yourself and hold, you can't loss more. 400 coming after ER"
"I have a new theory on why COST dropped so much today (-$9.45 or -2.46%).Monday: demand for the $10 Special Dividend bid the price up +$3.29.Tuesday: opening stock price adjusted down by $10 but price was subsequently bid up +$5.79 due to widespread confusion on purchase date to be dividend eligible (see multiple posts Re: Ex-Div, Date of Record, etc).Wednesday: stock was down -$4.06, normal fluctuation or some selling after 6 consecutive days of increases.Today: most retail stocks (WMT, TGT, BBY) were down just under -1.0% due to estimates of lower than expected holiday sales, but COST was down -2.5%. This extra -1.5%, or #$%$75, could be due to Costco's November sales, which were only slightly below Sep & Oct, but I suspect most was attributable to those who unwittingly bought on Tue or Wed thinking they were eligible for the dividend and began dumping the stock.Does this sound reasonable? If so, it would explain Thursday's drop and provides a strong case for a quick and sharp recovery."
hello emperor nice to see you on board getting ready for the run

"Looking at Costco stock since mid 90s, up 1700%. Great. But then compare to Amazon over same time period, it’s up over 66,000%. Makes Costco look like a flat line. And an overpriced one right now based on PE and PEG."

Love Costco to shop but there are better places to invest.
congrats to all who bought
The suspense is killing me....Any whisper numbers?
"Massive growth potential, just bought"
AH drop..figures we can't start driving this back up..geezus I decent day..10 more red days coming.
Costco declares a .70 cent dividend for next quarter. Keep up the good work
This is why Costco is so successful. Customers who shop there are smart. You won't see this type of behavior at Wal*Mart....
"Costco gives awards for ceo and other on 13 September almost 120 thousands shares as bonus, but on this way they reduced the shares value More shares and 0.00 cost and they can sale it next day It’s some thing wrong with that"

every single stock I own was green today...except manure costco
we just might have a $20 down day the way its looking
What sort of swing do you think a real good beat would create?+10.....+20....+30?
It’s not A store! COST e-commerce covers the entire China with 1.5 billion ppl! Membership fee business model works best in this environment! COST will fill the position which AMZN can’t reach in China!
i'm ready for $300 a share.
I am going to be in at 100$
Looking for more SILLY dips to add to positions.....................COST always rebounds.....................................
"this should be up huge in after hours, nothing but good in the report"
Getting frustrated is what they want. I am frustrated now but I know better to not let it get the bestof me. The market knows how to flush out excessive margin and that is what this maybe now because the stock is acting extremely weird! Never buy stocks on margin!
Costco goes to $300 by July.
Ughhhhh....looks like I’m losing $40k tomorrow. Lucky my back up retirement plan is 9mm to the head.

COST Sampling coming back !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!look for the SILLY DIPS as buy opportunity.
"I would like to recommend, Costco to MGMT, Costco whole sales store would open to the public, but with 1 condition, non member will pay additional 10%, above marked price witn, debit card or cash only, will bring in store net revenue and profit, to additional 10% to 15% or upto 20% per store.Only until pandemic time is over, also it will increase membership easy 10% to 15%, renewal.I would see with in a years, just as what amazon did it for trial period in the begining stage."
"I bought Costco at $150. a share a number of years ago. I bought because I could never find a time when there weren’t line ups. I liked the products and they pay their employees fairly with benefits. I liked the idea of the dividend, too. All those things remain the same. This is a great stock to have and to hold..."
295.00FILLED !
"Shorted at 284, will cover around 260 before earnings. This pos is over-bloated with a PE of 35. Nothing wrong with the company stock too expensive imo"
"The stock itself is so boring, but after video clip, it is another bull stock that breaks out the trading range. On Friday it assures that the wild break out is confirmed. The only question is how high can COST go higher. I guess 15-20% from base 280s can be done with a few more clips from China and earnings report."
Futures up slightly!
No mask for me. It is not an enjoyable place to shop anymore. Sold my shares.
If Costco announces that they're going to focus on improving their ecommerce can you imagine how quickly this stock will rise
"PEOPLE ITS A GIFT HERE , it’s not a 1 time purchase people will continue to shop and hoard , wether it’s CV, earthquake, hurricane etc all over the WORLD ."
COST rules the world
When is the ER?
2 mins for er
Awful day! Who could have guesses?!
this is going down on er date
3 cents WOWWWW ha ha ha aha hah
"I have been a Costco shareholder since the early 1990s with a single digit cost basis. This stock alone has made me wealthy. There have been many stock market fluctuations in 30 years and I rode them out. I am an investor not a trader. Asking every day why a stock goes up or down or being concerned about a week long downtrend will drive you crazy. If you want exposure to retail stocks, then Costco is a good choice in my opinion. Traders should look at momentum stocks not this type of retail stock. Having been an investor for 60 years I made my money over time, not in a week. Sometimes you get lucky and make money fast, but that doesn't happen very often. I luckily invested in the Magellan Fund in 1965 and reinvested annual payouts. So think long term and don't get fixated on short term fluctuations in a specific stock or the market as a whole. If you believe in the U.S. economy, then in the long run you will be rewarded."
Best stock to hold
"From a blog in 2007 ""Drive one vehicle, split the cost of gas. “Costco size” inflation I say. Be efficient with the dollar, save on food and gas the Costco way, plus you get a free meal with all the delicious finger snacks they distribute. Bottom line is you do not have to shop at Costco to buy Costco if know what I am saying stock pickers."""
"KEEP THAT POSITIVE ATTITUDE. NEVER QUESTION MGT AS TO WHY THEY DID WHAT THEY DO. KEEP QUIET AFTER ALL AS SOMEONE NOTED EARLIER...COST is not going to go down forever. It is one of the best run companies in the world and the business model is rockstar material. The stock price will eventually reflect this again. Wall Street doesn't always reward the etc... "" I PERSONALLY LIKE THIS PRICE. 300 AND LOWER IS THE GOAL. TO LOOSE %25 OF ITS VALUE IN LESS THAN 3 MONTHS...WHAT DO YOU THINK ? I THINK WE CAN MAKE IT."
Hopefully this makes up for kroger
all. all. hey. . . can we do
"Costco needs to implement rations on toilet paper, hand sanitizer and other cleaning supplies that are popular. Those 30 roll toilet paper packs should be limited to one per customer per month. Maybe send a coupon to each member that they must have to purchase."
Cramer says COST is a BUY .200+++++
If people breaking doors to enter makes you sell then I wish you the best of luck.

When will this year's special divined payout?
what's the chance this drops to 225-230 so I can get in long? heheh
Added on dip today50 units in total now
"Define miss, after accounting for .22 tax issue, they reported profits of 2.69 at the very top of analysts' expectations, in regards to revenues, pretty much in-line. Same stor sales supposedly missed, but wow, 5.1% increase, that must have been one heck of an expected number. Just saying, I know the media and analysts want a recession, but the numbers tell quite the opposite of a story. It may be down, but it sure the heck ain't out."
This VIRUS will be defeated !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Research making huge moves !
Costco would be 340 in less than 6 months.Just wait for the numbers. for next quarter.
Do you think cost will give out special bonus dividend this year?

Nothing in CNBC
Shop-rite much better store & u don't have to buy 2 dozen of one item.costblo is not worth the price.
unfortunately most of you longs will get burnt in the short term. Why? because 70% of their sales right now is food and food has the lowest margin of ebit of almost all sectors. I know...i own 2 food companies. The stock will drop to $170...maybe lower and will likely rocket to $500 within 5 years. But don't expect this to happen within 90 days. Do not hope trade. Caveat emptor.

Looks like all retailers are taking a hit today for no reason. That's the crazy stock market for you.
Finally some real movement since the China news.

COST does what it does best ...........RECOVERS..................Its a Buy and HOLD here.nothing has changed .shorts soon to cover.
awesome!
Bought Costco stocks @151 yesterday. I love this company. My family and I always buy foods and gas here. We save money. We also get double cash back from our membership and Citi card. I should've invested in this company when the stock was only $39 nine years ago
If it only turns out half as successful as Taiwan has been for them it will continue to grow and be a huge success. One out of 5 families in Taiwan have Costco memberships. They loved the guaranteed quality of USDA beef versus what they were getting before Costco arrived. Their meat departments are bigger than comparable US Costcos for that reason. My guess is you will see the same thing in China if more Costcos open there.
Definitely closing green today. Many upgrades with target boost.
"hey Kenny mason, besides dunkin being down big again today, I couldn't find any more stocks that were negative"
"cost needs to just quit announcing monthly sales, if you know anything about costco sales and earnings, they are always great numbers..but never good enough for wall st."
Glued to screen all morning. Finally go in and avg $320ish after watching all morning.....all morning. Thinking I didn’t buy it at $324. Yippee! Then it promptly drops. You’re welcome.
AMZN not doing well lately too.
"Bought Costco on this nice dip/opportunity. Now, can't wait for the pandemic to end so they start having samples again, and full food court menu."
Its going green.
Great stock! I would start to accumulate under 350. Still has room to fall
"just read that a deal in principle has been done with china. nothing signed, just in principle. this should send the markets higher tomorrow, which means COST most likely goes up with it."

The price going down AH makes no sense at all!

break 230
Is it on ?
Love to say Costco the only up and up today but this too is a dream that will pull back a little hopefully not too much
biggest problem with this company is having enough cashiers and parking for the daily onslaught of happy shoppers.I love shopping there as much as I love the stock. win win.
Do you suppose Costco directors forgot the div meeting?
Down 14% YTD. I don’t think I have ever seen it gain that much in a year’s time. Absolutely 
The stock is overpriced so it will take time for earnings to catch up.
Sup yall... probably a stupid question but will there b a CC w/guidance? Had heard that costco doesn't offer guidance... true?
Is this true that COST doesn't give forward guidance? I'm new to COST and I have never knew anyone else to do this.
hoping the board of directors will see the horrific performance this ceo has given then these past few months and will replace him
COST is the one to HOOOOOOOLD here !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

WHY SO FLAT THEY BEAT ON EARNINGS

Costco reports earnings this week and should put an end to this selling. I call an great up week for Costco stock. Upswing!
"Does anyone think Costco""s stock deserved to be down 9.98? The margins were down, but earnings beat by quite a bit. Amazon hardly has profit so what is wrong with Costco actually making good money and paying a dividend which Amazon will probably never be able to pay since they hardly make money. BOYCOTT THE CANCER THAT IS AMAZON."
"COST is in the race to become a short-term winner and is very likely to reach $ 390 before the earnings date, according to Zacks, COST is projected to report earnings of $2.37 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 12.86%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $43.53 billion, up 11.41% from the prior-year quarter. Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $9.95 per share and revenue of $184.12 billion. These totals would mark changes of +12.43% and +10.41%, respectively, from last year.It is also worth noting that COST currently has a PEG ratio of 4.17. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Retail - Discount Stores was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.53 at yesterday's closing price."

"Blue chip company to keep long term. People like me are just Costco addicts - it's a system that WORKS. Glad I bought it at the dip around $158 - what a bargain! Holding fast for now, may buy more if it dips under $180"
Anyone knows when will be the special dividend to be given? Thanks
COST should have at least the same PE as AMZN.
where gonna need a bigger store
I've been investing in Costco for last 7 years. A lot. To the point of OCD. Love that company. I've seen drops like that before. Perfect time to buy. They open 10-12 stores a year. Renewal rate is 93%. Happy Holidays everyone! Special Dividend in 2019!
Save some cash to do some BUYING ...................................................
any guess of tomorrow's earning?
"damn,,,come on costco,,,170 is needed by tomorrow early on,,, lets run ,,,i am long tons of Calls,,made my money by selling half of them already but want the other half to be real big returns,,,,bought stock today at 168,,lets run it"

"I'm literally in the Costco parking lot and the entire lot is full of cars, everyone sitting in their cars.. It's the calm before the storm. Lol! Idk how this stock hasn't just kaboomed."
"I bought COST after the ""experts"" sold off because they were suggesting Amazon was going to destroy Costco's valuation.It was a nice dip to get in on. I'm a long time loyal customer and admire how they treat their employees not to mention me."
COST...If you liked it at $393 you could really love it at $314. Really sad that a great company has just been hammered so badly.
"Great news in the monthly sales figures! to the moon alice, to the moon... GLTA"
COST. Y’all can pound sand. And your face Burka Stazi at the doors? Or getting yelled at for sitting on a $3200 patio set. I told the specimen yelling at me that you want me to buy this without sitting on it first? It looked at me like I was speaking Esperanto. WA based company? I expected nothing less than hysterics.
"Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) said Thursday profit rose in the fiscal second quarter, lifted by rising sales, as the warehouse retail chain saw a boost from consumers stockpiling on items in light of coronavirus fears.Net income rose to $931 million during the quarter ended Feb. 16 from $889 million during the same period last year. On a per-share basis, Costco earned $2.10, compared with $2.01 a year earlier. Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting reported earnings of $2.05 a share."

"Charlie's favouriteAn interesting side note is that Charlie Munger (Trades, Portfolio) is on the board of directors for Costco (and has been since 1997), and owns over 180,000 shares in the company. While this is not a reason to buy a stock (always do your own research and never blindly follow anyone, regardless of their track record) it makes sense that Munger would like Costco -- it is mature businesses with great customer loyalty and very sensible management."
"IMHO, from a purely technical perspective, Costco is quite oversold on the daily and weekly charts and, given Friday's price action, the stock seems to have found a bottom at $307 and it is expected to bounce to $330 in the short term. Trading in the range of $310 to $320 or so meanwhile is a natural base building action. Good luck to all."
Can’t stop this juggernaut. Costco. 4 life
COST reached an all time high at 287.16
"Costco is the king of retail, and in that space, its growth has been phenomenal.They haven't even scratched the surface yet on the online world, when that would happen, combined with retail, Costco would do wonders."

"Know what you own...from the earnings callThere were eight net new openings in Q1, so we're eight year-to-date. In the second half of the fiscal year, but this quarter, in the fourth fiscal quarter, we plan to open 13 more net new units. Five of those will be in the U.S., three will be in Canada, and five will be in overseas."

COST is hugely undervalued:Target $450!
"Amazon is only good for buying worthless riffraff like USB cables and Cellphone Cases and textbooks that you don't need to see in person before buying. I hate the packaging. Amazon is a huge garbage generator. Costco is lot greener. They even cutup old boxes so people can carry stuff in it. Love Costco. Going there tomorrow early morning before parking lot gets full. Next to Disneyland, Costco my magic kingdom.."
how could this go.anywhere but down?
The price needs to drop so I can buy deeps.
"Anybody buying Costco stock up here? I see line ups in my local one, literally to the block. I also like their fundamentals. $152.7 billion in 2019 sales and 13% dividend growth annualized over the last 5 years. 0.84% dividend yield is kinda low, but the growth makes up for it.Taking the 72 rule, this dividend would double in the next 5 years if it stays at this rate of growth. Also, Costco's dividend payout ratio is just 30%, leaving lots of room for growth.It is featured as one of the best dividend stocks according to this article https://dividendscholar.com/best-dividend-stocks-to-buy-now in line with other companies like Starbucks, Sherwin-Williams Co., Nike, S&P Global Inc., Honeywell and Visa."

"Costco Wholesale (COST) stock (COST) is ticking up Friday, helped by an upgrade from Gordon Haskett, which sees several catalysts for the discount retailer, including pending earnings that could surprise on the upside.The back story. Costco stock is up more than 41% year-to-date, while the S&P 500 has climbed around 20%. The company is expanding overseas and seeing strong sales trends, and many expect it to soon pay a special dividend.That's allowed the shares to largely sidestep the pressures facing peers, including an ongoing trade war and increasing competition from e-commerce.What's new. On Friday, Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom boosted his rating on Costco to Accumulate from Hold, raising his price target to $330 from $255."

It will be above 190 tomorrow.

Pre market is red but it will turn green by 10:30 this morning. Not too worry because shortie are not too interested in this stock. It’s just a normal correction after earnings. Hang on.
This one is a long hold. Cannot see this stock at least being $800-$1000/ share by 2030. Not to mention an always improving dividend.

"What’s new. On Monday, Raymond James analyst Budd Bugatch reiterated an Outperform rating and $260 price target on Costco stock. He argues that while the shares initially traded lower following the earnings report, there was plenty to like in the results, including robust membership results, ongoing strong traffic, and a growing e-commerce business that doesn’t seem to be cannibalizing bricks-and-mortar customer visits."

Doing some more BUYING as the shorts and weak hands continue to scare others.remember no one has made $$$ by PANIC SELLING.
"CostcoFor RBC Capital’s Scot Ciccarelli, Costco is a top pick in the retail space. On December 14, he maintained a Buy rating as well as a $439 price target (20% upside potential).According to Ciccarelli, “Costco just keeps doing it what it does best,” which is delivering strong sales growth and good margin performance. In its most recent quarter, the company posted comp growth of 17.1%, enabling it to generate strong leverage in fiscal Q1 2021, in the analyst’s opinion. E-commerce sales surged 86% and now account for roughly 7% of total sales.Even though U.S. comps moderated, Ciccarelli argues “this modest deceleration seemed to be driven by pull forward activity and… more aggressive Black Friday promotions starting as early as late-October from some competitors.” On top of this, gross margins reached 13.3% thanks to efficiency gains, labor productivity and significantly lower product spoilage in fresh foods.What’s more, Ciccarelli points out that Costco has the strongest buying power in the retail space because it concentrates all of its scale on a small group of SKUs, while its bigger competitors spread their buying power across millions of SKUs. Additionally, he thinks it has the lowest markup in the industry.“We believe this combination creates extremely compelling value for their members. As a result, while Costco has indeed benefitted from accelerated shopping activity as more consumer dollars are directed towards goods rather than services/experiences (what we call the Retail Lift), we believe Costco is extremely well positioned regardless of broader economic trends in 2021,” Ciccarelli opined."
Will it down after earnings today?
"@ Riley, yes one day the market will go through a serious realignment but not now, interest rates are still very low, consumer confidence is high, corporation are making insane profits, The bears are in the cave, enjoy it while it last"

Sounds like 3 foreign stores on the agenda! Sales increased by 25% in Canada and even more internationally.
"Next stop 175.00""s"
"Wholesale delivery, huh? Good move, Costco. Great quarter. Nit's are worried about margins, huh? And competition with Amazon? Oldest trick in the book... don't be fooled. September numbers were off the charts! Nit's should probably worry about Amazon's margins, considering they've never really turned a profit for shareholders. Plenty of growth yet to be had here."
"COST is UNDERVALUED hereIt wasn’t long ago that shoppers were flocking to Costco (COST) to stock up on groceries as coronavirus cases first hit the Northeast ahead of state lockdowns across the country.Now, as a similar spike in cases hits Texas, Florida and Arizona, Costco might benefit from more of that — but perhaps more importantly, as one data firm points out, their membership model might benefit regardless of renewed panic buying.According to location analytics firm Placer.ai, the wholesaler was already seeing a steady rise in store visits as the pandemic situation started to improve in mid-April. Visits rose from a nearly 30% year-over-year drop in April to a 14% decline in May to only a 6.5% drop in June, according to Placer.ai data."
The party is over. Retail sales incl. COST will fall for the next 4 quarters. TGT down 11%.
Shorts and their fake news! The preliminary financials look terrific. Maintaining growth extremely well! Can't wait for the CC at 2pm pacific

Costco is going to blow away earnings. There is always a line at the 3 costcos near me and also they are doing lots of membership promotions VIA Groupon. Definitely loading up on this dip. Earnings coming 09/24 at close of market!
Undervalued !! Time to start accumulating !!
Look for the sillllllly dipsthen pull trigger.......................................
Costco is a value play with a growth story; market overreaction to minor IT issue will be corrected soon enough and it is a great buying opportunity now. Forward PE at a reasonable 26 and PEG ratio 2.5 way lower than Walmart 3.5. I would bet on Costco any given day than Walmart at this valuation and intriguing business model.
doesn’t make sense for the drop. their stores have major lines are also ways packed...
this stock ready to explode up
Going below 300 today.

"Bought a Costco hot dog for lunch today. Bought my first Costco shares four months ago at 200 hot dogs per share. Today we're up to 217 hot dogs per share. Plus the drinks. Every 100 shares is 21,700 hot dogs. I'm set for life!"
"Bought 6K of Costco on the cheap! The reason Whole Paycheck was half price is because the store is bloated and inventory turns are low. Costco has the best inventory turns therefore the best price. Funny how walmart, kroger, and Target are all down. Nobody mention Traders Joes. They are killing all the grocery stores except Costco. You can't make a whole foods a trader joes unless you cut the physical store in half."
"Crazy, I'm down $5k in less than a month!"
Costco was empty this week. Not one car was getting new tires. People working off their hoard for the next several months.

It seems like every stock that hits a new high drops back.
20 years since the last stock split. 6 to 1 would be nice.

Is Costco stock going to split soon?
bought more to get even. a solid company
"Adding to the SILLY DIPS............................................300-305""s"
Target is now 278.00
"Costco shares currently @ Costco discount pricing... Get them quick, Time Limited Offer!"
With passage of the tax bill it goes through 200.
"look at the call options,,,the show no premium,,,so the stock is dead money for a long time,,"
BUY in increments ALL WAY DOWN.....................................been with COST for over 12 years now.
The PE needs to go back to $25. Overvalued!!!
"The more I shop at Costco, the more I love to shop at Costco.  Surprisingly, my kids are now asking to go to Costco. If not heading out to Costco, there's always Amazon. Two great companies to invest in. COST will no doubt hit $500 in 2021."
All time high today
"Costco is a buy till it exceeds the PE of Amazon around 150, lots of room to grow as every new location flooded with customers from the time it opens till closing time."
"Costco's Kirkland warehouse 8629 120TH AVE NEKIRKLAND, WA98033-5865. Its 4 miles away from Hospital"
Hairbag do you know 99% Chinese do not speak or write English but China has most number of Billionaires! Language is just a form of a communication. I speak and write 4 different languages!
President Trash is GARBAGE!! He has negatively affected our nation and our 401k’s !! Costco’s management team has done great to increase the value of our stock despite the stupid President and his stupid tariffs!!
ha ha costblo.
It’s been red since December. Im sick of this.
My local Costco was packed yesterday
buy buy buy
Waiting to add more under300
"how funny is it they down grade costco,,,costco is huge and amazon will not hurt them at all"
I LOVE my Costco stock!!
Short squeeze? .98% of the shares held short? Huh?
when cost announce to increase membership? just $10 will boosts stock back to normal level.
Boom!
time for$$$
after hours getting killed. can't find any news

Doesn’t lower rates on new financing save money retiring existing notes?
RSI is way OVERSOLD........................18
KEEP CALM AND JUST WATCH
"330 next week, woohoo"
"wallstreet does not want costco to invest in their employees. Evil, just pure evil."
318.00-322.00better load up........................................
Nice drop. ha hah a ha aah
moment of truth!
Looks pretty cheap but I prefer M for yield.
Good earnings
what is it with cost? up one day....down the next..well never get to $300 at this point
New starting Costco wage= $16/hour. Will put pressure on other large retailers to follow suit.
Quite surprised seeing Costco stock declining as much as it has. Didn't think it would happen tbh. Is it valuation? No interest anymore? Sector rotation into more valued stocks? Maybe as some here haven't mentioned....Costco should split it's stock.
In at $296 for 1k shares also GD and MDT RECESSION PROOF
sellers will be so sorry when Costco opens up more stores in China and stock goes to 400
Wait for PANIC SELLING...............................................then do some buying ....................
"Costco puts the customer first. Their return policy is the best and even gets abused but this guarantees return customers, returning to the yearly membership fee to gladly pay up. It's a club after all and people want in! Where can I get a 3 pound can of Colombian coffee for only $9.99 ..Costco."
"I can't thank management enough for instituting the mask policy They are only trying to keep everybody safe and I can't believe some people are whining about the small inconvenience. Are people really that selfish that you don't care about others and want all to be safe. We wear ours when shopping in stores to keep others safe. To the whiners, stop acting like spoiled little children. The world doesn't revolve just around you. We are all in this together and its a small sacrifice to make until this blows over to help keep everybody safe."
300.00 coming....................
"feel great being in Costco and not worried about tarriffs. we have nothing to do with trade wars if they come about. so glad I am back in Costco again, stress now is gone. see nothing but positive upward climb. my post retirement is secure..WHEW!!"
Heading now to 297.5
Big line going into Costco yesterday due to them handing out sanitary wipes for your shopping cart at the entrance.
Ouch ...I’m getting killed
SO FAR... Week hands loosing to the strong and smart! Recovering from fear selling now.
This should be higher
"The store packs every day, a lot better than WMT and Sam's club. It is a long term baby."
If the market is green tomorrow it will be green.
Even with the crowds this might be down 10
COST is above 400 next month! We’ll see 360 today!
"I see it going up today, 310 by end of the day"
why can't costo have them $100 days like Amazon. and tesla?
Will we see $280’s by the weekend?
"IS THERE ANY HONESTY ? I POSTED A FEW MESSAGES NEGATIVE IN NATURE SEEING THAT THE STOCK HAS LOST ABOUT 30 POINTS IN 3 WEEKS AND MY COMMENTS ARE NO WHERE TO BE FOUND. THE ONLY ONES THAT EXIST ARE THE POSITIVE COMMENTS ' GEEE...THE STOCK IS LOW, GREAT TIME TO BUY' IS THERE ANY INTEGRITY HERE ? PUBLISH THE GOOD AND THE BAD."
Loaded up with calls now. this selloff is way overdone. Costco is a powerhouse!
Look for these SILLY DIPS as another entry point.
2019 RECESSION is near.......................................
BUFFET says COST is considered CHEAP here..a BUY !
Selling share to stop the bleeding.
Last chance to jump on the $$wagon.
Very bearishNot worth 238Maybe 210
"who gives a damn about amazon,,,it will not take over the world,,it will help weak companies,,thasts all,,costco is a giant and could squash amazon if it desired to,,,fools chase the amazon stock up,,,how does that 1080 price look now that 945 is the new price,,not to well is it"
Targets maintained for COST343.00-352.00

COST AMZN WMT AAPL WILL BE LAGGING FROM THE REST BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SPENDING LESS MONEY NOW AND WILL BE FOR AWHILE
anyone know why AH is down?
"Costco is not a short-term or day trading stock, it's destined to make you money but requires some patience."
I like to see 318 Before earning
Taking advantage of the PANIC selling today.................let the lower prices come to you!I am a BUYER ...............
"I bought COST today. Whole Foods and COST are completely different companies with very different strategies. If AMZN wanted to become a COST it would have to totally redo and reface the entire brand and stores.... No one is leaving COST to shop at Whole Foods and the earnings today show that only more people are shopping at COST.... long story short, COST isn't going anywhere and they have a niche that maybe only Walmart competes with, buy when others are fearful."
"Reason for today's drop:Analyst Actions: Nomura Initiates Coverage on Costco Wholesale With Neutral Rating, $300 Price Target."
Walmart is up over 8% and Costco 4. Crazy. Costco stores are wild.
Tomorrow’s the special day. Are we going to see a special divi?
I just bought a lot today. I still believe Costco continue to be successful for long time.
at such earnings shouldn't we be at north of 200??
Costco got rid of Kirkland $12.99 jeans. Time to try BJ warehouse. I will not be renewing my membership.
What time is earning call?
solid qtr by Costco - did they give some grim future outlook? why is this stock selling off after hours?
why is this dropping so much??
Trump has NO intentions on a DEAL with China.its all B. S.
3/01/21 Costco Wholesale Corporation raises it's starting wage to $16/hour.#leadnotfollow
Is this just manipulation prior to earnings?
"Whether there's something specific causing the retailer's traffic to ""moderate,"" a trend he's been seeing in recent weeks."
AMZN is nothing compared to COST.
will dip another $7 dollars before going back up
ouch..
I went to COST yesterday and there were no lines except for members returning Father’s Day gifts.
If this was AMZN figures it would be up $100.
Just went to Costco today to prep for Hurricane Harvey. Took me 30 minutes to find parking. Lines were out the door and around the corner.
"THIS TURKEY IS HEADED FOR THE ""LAST ROUNDUP""...GOOD RIDDANCE!"
It should be close to the bottom price now. A huge buying opportunity!!!
Great run......................look for some pullback as BUY opportunity.
Most go to Costco for food which is VERY expensive on Amazon. I would just love to see Amazon ship me the quantity of stuff I buy for the same price I pay at COST. Not going to happen!!!! What do you think?
What do these clowns really sell.
"Net sales for the first quarter increased 16.9 percent, to $42.35 billion from $36.24 billion last year.amazing"
"this is why PE ratio is meaningless,,,why would the stock rebound if its too highly valued,,it would not,,,"
Good luck those that are holding. It will be good news I promise. I was in costco the other day. It was a nightmare. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Virus subsides,Costco reboundsVirus escalates,People don’t dine out or travel,potentially millions of kids home from school. People will eat at home. Costco will rebound."
"How come people investing in stock without knowing basic things such as Dividend, Ex- Dividend day and record day. No wonder these Robinhooders will hit hard."
Friday typical sell off
look for the SILLY DIPS as BUY opportunity !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Im a COSTCO holder. Just a question. If death rates due to COVID spikes next week, will it make the price to drop also?"
What the ?!
How big is China VS USA?How many population China VS USA?How Big is COST VS AMZN? in the Future?AMZN wanted to Buy Kirkland Brand.?Give 10 YRS You will be rewarded.IMO
"Costco is just killing it. Check out the last 5 minutes of trading on 3/17, 960K buy ins...Noice! Spring is here and everyone is flocking costco. long lines and no parking??!! that's a great thing! Let's go Costco! Let's go Costco!I think gauging demand for costco is determined by seeing how many buy ins there were at the last 5 minutes of trading."
This isn’t going anywhere till Dec 1
COST will be up BIG tomorrow on any morning DIP as MM's love this growth and no CHINA exposure.
costco is opening a store in shanghai china. big boom
Imagine if they missed
Has anyone heard when the second costco is opening in China? Last few articles I have seen said late 2020 or beginning 2021
Big scam by Bernstein. They get the price down and then buy in. Jail all these manipulators
Costco will close green tomorrow. Bet on it.
300 today
"$300 ,coming"
Called it last week.... big snap back for this week and here it is today.... up $8. More to come in coming days. Like I said.... it's Costco.
"YOU THINK THE MISS ON EARNINGS WAS DUE SOLEY TO...'INCREASED PANDEMIC COSTS ?"" REALLY ? THATS WHAT A VIEWER SAID..Costco beat expectations on revenues. They missed expectations on earnings due to unusual increased pandemic costs, but still had better earnings than the year prior. This is a positive earnings report! THIS IS A POSITIVE REPORT. INCREASED EARNINGS. HMMM AND DREADFUL EARNINGS. WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ? IS IT ALL ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE VIRUS ? REALLY ? AND WHAT CAN THEY DO IN THE FUTURE TO FIX THIS ? SALARY COSTS ARE STILL GOING FORWARD. I THINK CHANGE IN MANAGEMENT WOULD BE A GREAT SUGGESTION. HOW ABOUT SKIPPING ANY BONUSES ? BUY BACK STOCK, ANNOUNCE EFFORT TO FIGHT SHORT SELLERS BY HAVING SUPPORT FOR STOCK. STOCK SPLIT WOULD BE NICE. ETC."
$150's soon....
Dec. Earnings blow out. This weekend my Costco was packed. Wait for some one to leave for a parking spot. Shoppers with full carts.
Anybody know date and time that Costco will announce profits for month of December?Hoping for huge profits to move stock higher.
I thinking it closes green today
this thing is going to roll. major runs on the warehouse are underway for bulk supplies
We are at April 2020 level !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!way OVERSOLD.................................save dry powder.............................................
"sold everything, I really think this stock is going to drop...going to wslMNart and target"
Hey Balls- just sell the GD stock and be done with it already. These are unprecedented times we’ve gone through in the last four months so either sell it or take an extra pill.￼
Overvalued at 30 times
"count on Costco crushing it's sales #s, and then taking a $5-$7 hit for it. Standard operating procedure."
why is this stock stuck mid 350's? I am sure the financials look awesome. why doesn't it go up?
RECESSION PROOF stock.just buy and hold here.
Back to high $160's and low $170's.....peeps have had plenty of time to buy.
cost may have reached its peak..time to talk splitting
Pump and dump
let's have another ^$20 days
Target upgraded !!!!!!
Today was a bad day for the market. Tomorrow everything will recover and COST will jump 3 to 5%
no reason at all this is even down...manipulation
WAS UP $3 NOW DOWN $8 LOL
"Could a Costco Special Dividend Be Coming? One Analyst Thinks Yes, at $10 a Share."
this will tank 215 today!.... it's done... bear market plus accounting issues... not so good day for COST...
BJ stock jumped 37 percent in May. Let's see COST jump 37 percent in June.
Cover shorts... it's getting ready to rock tomorrow as future is up once again...
"CRAMER says......BBBBUUUUYYYYYYYYYYCostco has a premium valuation for a good reason. The retailer has outperformed peers with its sales and earnings growth rate. We think that Costco could sustain mid to high-single-digit comps growth during the holiday season. Holiday sales forecasts set a bullish tone. We think that Costco, Target (TGT), and Walmart (WMT) could gain the most. Costco’s high membership renewal rate, expanded offerings, and price investments will likely draw higher traffic."
Its just Tax Loss selling.............................COST has been up over 50% from year end !
"Dirtbag,Enough posts. Get out Now and go collect beer cans."
$350 let’s go
market is up and Costco is down...amazing how investors react to someone's analysis....it will bounce back
Who’s actually thinking this will go up tommorrow.... no chance...
Crushed earnings
Great store but their forays into social justice are troubling to me as shareholder.
took profits 178.00waiting for pull back to get back in.
"Way oversold! Stay Costco strong for the long haul. This company treats its employees and customers right, and will do the same for shareholders."
"$SVOK will merge with BOXED, which is like Costco but online. E-commerce Costco, better than Costco. Buy $SVOK"
ON SEPT 24TH EARNING DATE COSTCO WILL MORE THAN LIKELY ANNOUNCE SPECIAL DIVIDEND TO SHAREHOLDERS.
"Costco is doing great, but I would like to know how we are all going to eat samples with our masks on. That one is a stumper for me."
Best retailer missed Wall Streets consensus numbers...crazy
STILL HIGH PE OVER 33. AVERAGE RETAIL IS UNDER 30. THAT MEANS ANOTHER 30 40 POINTS LOWER. 310 ANYONE ??? GREAT TIME FOR ANOTHER EMPLOYEE WAGE INCREASE. HOW ABOUT A MID YEAR BONUS ??? GENIUS MANAGEMENT. WHAT ARE THEY THINKING ?
"To: Dave re: costco question regarding valuation,COSTCO HAS HAD THREE DOWNGRADES IN THE LAST 4 MONTHS, THE LAST ONE BY WELLS FARGO. INCOME IS OK BUT THE BIG BEAR IN THE ROOM IS AMAZON WHO JUST INCREASED ALL WORKERS INCOME TO $15 per hour AND COSTCO IS NOTORIOUSLY ""CHEAP""AND MAKES SOME REALLY ""STUPID DECISIONS"" SUCH AS REFUSING TO ACCEPT CERTAIN PAYMENT CARDS SUCH AS AMEX. CURRENT REVENUE AND INCOME AND ARE OKBUT NOT A HOME RUN. THE INTRINSIC VAUE OF ANY PUBLIC IS AFFECTED BY COMPETITOR ""IN WAITING"" SUCH AS AMAZON AND WALMART-SAMS CONNECTION WHICH IS PRETTY FORMIDABLE WITH A LOT MORE EXPERIENCE. CAN ONE QUANTIFY CURRENT PRICE TO VALUE, YES CERTAINLY BUT THE ANALYSIS I HAVE SEEN DOES NOT SEEM, AT THIS TIME, TO SUPPORT FUTURE HIGHER VALUES AND MAY GO LOWER. I DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL BUT I AM NOT COMPELLED TO BUY RETAIL FROM A WHOLESALE COMPANY.THIS MAY NOT SHED ANY LIGHT BUT YOU CAN GO TO: FINVIZ.COM (stock screener), where a lot of the number crunching and analysts opinions are included..good luck!E...ret"
its friday....might as well sell off your costco stock
SHORTING MORE

"COST's earnings will blow up the lid this afternoon, this is my prediction. I think COST will pass 300 again for good this time."
It's going up. They LIKE IT!Costco rules!
Costco Wholesale Corp.’s November sales rose 15.1% to 15.67 billion.
The orange fuehrer can't keep his mouth shut. 1 1/2% drop from high point today.
"Can you imagine being a Mommy-moochin', geographically-challenged, unemployed, unmarried, childless, mouth-breathing, knuckle-draggin' l'il Sterile Sissy King with an imagination bigger than his teenie-tiny weenie, and having shorted Costco at $113 and then refusing to talk about it? I mean, that's only $62 in the wrong direction.Then again, when you've got an imaginary yacht, think that you live in the south of France (when in fact you live with your Mom, 'cause your adult life failed), what's one more whopper to an old fibber?Please note that I didn't mention any names. I await the usual imaginative reply of how he's ""doing my wife"" as I post. That'll deflect from his obvious failure and his inability to confront it."
Save some cash...do some buying as it goes lower..........................................
All my other stocks are going up 10 percent today. What is wrong with COST?

a good time to buy
It will be interesting to see how many new memberships were sold so far this year. People more than ever want to buy in bulk. Canada is also running a membership promo right now. I can see membership revenues being over 3.5 billion in 2020.
COST getting attention from big investors.Targets could be set too low here.
"$300 ,,here we come MM WANT THIS DOWN before earnings"
"Bought during the dip 10 months ago at $157... obviously, wish I had purchased even more. Love Costco - even bought my car and solar roof through them. Good example of buy what you believe in. I am looking forward to one of their periodic special dividends!"
COST not getting killed by Amazon Whole Foods pricing strategy?
Costco stock going down is a good thing. We can now get a great company at cheaper prices.
"There is no way Amazon food business is going to work for me, I prefer to go out in the store and pick my own fruits , veggies........ fresh !"
Dividend is coming!
"Look for the ""Silly Dips"" as another BUY opportunity."
90.9% membership renewal rate in the US. That's Apple-grade customer loyalty.
"my question is where is the bull market,,,i am seeing costco fall from 180 to 156 now,,where is the bull"
dividend payout is in their pockets. (dividend shoppers) and the selling pressure has slowed as expected.
"Seriously Costco!!!! Look at HD, Lows, TGT, o well except WMT. Fix it up management!!!!"
This bad boy is about to soar.

"I will never invest in Costco until they have clear executable plan for Clean energy and sustainable solutions in their warehouses, etc.Even Walmart, Target and Amazon are doing better. They have invested in new green technologies in their warehouses with PLUG Hydrogen fuel cells, solar energy, etc. Costco looks like an old Oil company in comparison..it is matter of time they will crash with this mindset..."
"Interesting how everyone expects it to go down after earnings, however option call buyers have never been bigger and put buyer are very small. Can anyone explain this to me? Thanks."
Wish I had bought days ago. But sold some for 387 last Nov can hardly believe I got it back Wed at 329.20 .
is the guidance weak?
"I have owned this stock for a few years and you have to love it. Good chance for another special dividend this year too. However, based on the P/E, I am starting to get scared its a little overvalued"

Time to enter the trade again.
Bought back my PUTS again!!! I KNEW the FED would jack the markets....but watch it fade.
seeing a gap up tomorrow to 330??
"I have said this for years and I am 100% right. Costco is led by a team equivalent to dumb and dumber, and have always made money despite their inept stupidity. simple as simple gets!!"
Wait to buy back 237.00 -238.00
Huge over reaction by Costco sellers. Huge opportunity for Costco buyers!
Finally got in 307.74/share. I feel pretty lucky. I love shopping at Costco.
I think Hairbag just jumped off the cliff.
Costco increased revenue and earnings year over year. They did this while supply chains are disrupted. They did this while paying employees a pandemic bonus. The stock price held up last year while other companies tanked.
Looks like Cramer was wrong about Costco earnings. People cared. LOL
"you all need jesus. #$%$, thanks. enjoy the rest of your lousy day"
"“Earth to Costco, come in Costco” - Did anyone tell the CEO that Covid-19 restrictions are slowly being lifted, not more strictly being enforced? If I owned their stock I would sell, If I paid for a membership I would demand a refund. You protect your employees by requiring them to wear a mask. Customers should be able to make that decision for themselves!"
you guys wondering why the stock is dropping?..its the market makers having their way with costco..they're driving the price down to buy more before the bell
120 or lower may be in cards!!!
Shorts gonna get squeeeeezedReddit Group soon to take over...............
CRAMER ......................its a Buy and hooooooold.

"Doubters, Doubt.....Costco is strong"

I'd hate to miss Costco under $300.
300 soon
Today to 297
Nice pullback just prior to Earnings !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!shorts gonna get BURNED as usual !
Wow.. quite an expensive company.. only a single digit growth and trading at around 25 P/E multiple and low dividend payments compared to the price? I read through the earnings. How come COST is so expensive?
There she blows... past $240 while S & P and other in the red.
Look for318.00-322.00
Strong Buy!
one of the biggest chains around....dow up over 500 pts....sorry..cost in the red

"consumer sentiment is all time high. unemployment all time low. people have money to spend. when consumer sentiment turns negative then the market wil truely crash. $nflx , $goog, $aapl, $amzn"
"will have the same fate as HD, will drop hard the next 6-8 weeks"
Amazon may hurt a lot of competitors of Costco more than Costco. End result less Costco competitors which will end up being better for Costco.
"Costco is no more than 8% off its high. So, those who own this stock could get out anytime without too much problem. If one thinks there is another stock would perform better than Costco, why not cash out and invest that other stock. If you are above water, you would make a gain and if you are under, the max you would lose is 8% (if you purchased COST at its high). One could use the lost as tax write off also. While everyone can express his opinions but if one does not do anything, nothing will change. I am not advising people to get out of Costco as I am not qualified to give advice. I just want to point out that you can do something about this. Bitch and Moan about this stock will not do a thing."
when are the earnings?
We get the $10 bucks + stock appreciation. No brainer Costco is a winner!
"You people bemoaning the 16/hour wages are idiots. You #$%$ if the government mandates a minimum wage because ?socialism,? and then you #$%$ if a company does it of their own accord.Guess what? Costco decided to invest in their employees, just like they?ve already been doing. It?s paid off in terms of a workforce that feels valued. And Costco customers keep renewing and loading flatbed carts with hundreds of dollars every trip.Let me know when you run a company that has people waiting for hours to find a parking spot the moment you open a location in China. ?"
Yahoo article is a joke chicken at whole food discount by $1 still $3 over Costco price lol
"easy money on slow trading holiday black Friday,,just short for the day,,everything is falling since buyers are gone shopping,,,"
along with COST I'm looking into WM if they dip
we might see green today
"Costco Wholesale CorporationWed., December 2, 2020, 4:15 p.m. ESTISSAQUAH, Wash., Dec. 02, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Costco Wholesale Corporation (“Costco” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: COST) today reported net sales of $15.67 billion for the retail month of November, the four weeks ended November 29, 2020, an increase of 15.1 percent from $13.62 billion last year.For the twelve-week first quarter ended November 22, 2020, the Company reported net sales of $42.35 billion, an increase of 16.9 percent from $36.24 billion last year.For the thirteen weeks ended November 29, 2020, the Company reported net sales of $46.33 billion, an increase of 16.0 percent from $39.95 billion during the similar period last year.look for SILLY dips as great entry here."
People tend to focus the SHORT TERM....................................CORONAVIRUS will be defeated folks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!soon as we have a proven treatment / vaccine the market will come back like you never seen before !

"Funds are moving in, they take it up and down all day like a wave....this is the bottom"
Bought more this morning at $234. THANk YOU!!
Down again in an up market
Costco will go up this week
280.00 buying more !
Nice drop.
People already have all the goods they need last 2 weeks and that is why COST and WMT stocks don’t take parts last 3 days with 16% up of the market
Why are we in Yahoo finance trending ticker list?... Because of the announced covid-19 test sale??
What do they expect? Great sales report.
dividend ex date tomorrow. bullish today and tomorrow.
Guidance will kill it. Only $ they make is on high prices stuff from China
please go down more.....hahahaha.....thanks for all the fake news I made the right bet.
Way Overbought.
"Target $220--sell any strength;;When market down so hard, most stocks will follow suit, esp consumer stocks!"
Cramer continues to buy the DIPS......................................look for opportunities.........................
"Costco is also significantly limiting the number of members (customers) allowed in their warehouses at any time,crimping sales. the future earnings will be impacted by not only a drop in sales volume but as much, if not more so, from a shift towards more low-margin items such as toilet paper, water & essential food items (milk, eggs, meat, etc..) away from higher-margin goods & services such as TVs, furniture, vacation packages, etc.."
"it will be back to $370 soon, just a little year end adjusting and profit taking."
This is outrageous. COST down another $4 after last friday's descent. Is this really warranted? I cannot even see how Whole foods/Amazon competes much with COST?
Buy back 218.00

COST is great but today. Earnings will be announced this Thursday after hour. It could shoot up to 360. Don’t miss your chance.
Get out now imo
"I see this as a zoom like earnings play ... Ecommence, (online shopping) has a big role in their upcoming earnings beat... I watched overstock soar from $20-100 over the course of the last 7 months because of their strong Ecommerce sales... Im very bullish on this stock I see 355 before market close on Thursday."
This garbage has managed to shed $10 per share since I picked it up. Wow! Sell now. Don’t believe the hype.

wimps gunna sell off Costco at the power hour
Quarter report pre or AH?
better cover shorties...............................
Buy if you are investor. Two reasons. 1) People get really excited when a new Costco opens near them (compare that to a Walmart) and 2. Happy customers exiting the store with a huge loaded cart and a smile.
shorts better cover.................................
IF ANYONE ELSE IS UNHAPPY WITH COSTCO'S PERFORMANCE I URGE YOU TO DRIVE TO YOUR NEAREST COSTCO AND DROP A DEUCE AND DON'T FLUSH! THIS IS A WAY TO PEACEFULLY PROTEST....
"A lot of people moving their money into BJ’s. Costco is of course the industry leader but from a value and growth perspective, BJ’s fairs much better especially with their expansion plans going forward and comp metrics."
No momentum againSinking like a rock
354.77 today. Last time I bought was 352. $355 is also a great deal. In the long run a few dollars would not make a big dif.
Cost will drift down to 250 level Pantry sticking over

"I challenge all you Bear trolls, swing thru a Costco on a weekend; you’ll find packed parking lots and an average cart spend of $315 vs. Sam’s club of $226. This stock is undervalued, substantially. $195 by 3/30."
This is what is going to happen to COSTCO if they miss...Remember this company sells a lot of stuff that costco sells outside of foodthe magnitude of the miss males it unlikely costco will make it;s numbersthe runup was huge it was 110 a few months ago is this the time to lock in gains while it is hardly down from it's overpriced high ?Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.

Kramer says buy
why is Costco tanking....
Healthy pullback !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!nothing has changed here for COST
why is this down?
Costco posts strong November sales because AMAZON ISN'T ALL ITS MADE UP TO BE. IT'S ALL FAKE NEWS ADVERTISEMENT TO BOOST THE STOCK PRICE AND MANIPULATE INVESTORS. Costco isn't going anywhere.
"clears 4B for first time, goes down anyway https://www.marketwatch.com/story/costco-clears-4-billion-in-earnings-for-first-time-amid-record-growth-but-the-stock-is-falling-11600979558?mod=mw_latestnews"
"Saw a post here claiming, ""$260 coming"" and thought it was getting a little over excited. WOW, not so out of line now, but very possible before long"
Due to the coronavirus we shop at Costco about every 3-4 weeks. Last trip my wife and I each filled a cart with foot and toilet paper. Nothing extra. $821 worth. Have never spent anything like that before. If that's not bullish I don't know what is.Bob
BOOOOMMMM!!
it depends on whose estimate you used lol ..sounds like a small beat to me
DONT REACT TO AFTERHOURS
lemme guess...buy the silly dips?
Investment firm D A Davidson new rating has COST as neutral. Says its membership has top out.
sold today..this is headed back to $300 ...over inflated stock
"It looks so bad, monthly sales beats last month, but stock just moves less than 1 point. I thought it will pop up 3-4 pts. like last month."
My best stock by far. The only good thing about Biden is that COST maybe able to open up more stores in China.
earnings must have just leaked..I hope the CEO will announce his resignation
Hey guys - Lumberg here -- Wasss Happening? I'm not sure this whole internet thing is going to work out -- M'Kay? But gotta an idea -- Warehouse + Groceries + Goods at ...wait for it.... wholesale prices. It's gonna be BIG.

is this a corona stock?
Targets are raised ...again ......................400+
COST should be $500 better than $1770 AMZN.
UP PM. I hope u shorts get burned. Still have NVDA.
Cal Cunningham N.C. Senator is another Bill Clinton. Gets caught texting girlfriend and then boohoos!!!
"i would have to be on life support before I ordered groceries from Amazon. Wall Street just thinks Amazon can do no wrong. In actuality, they need to start turning a profit. The only place they make money is on the cloud and Amazon and Jeff Bezos are neither charitable. Walmart gave over 30 million to the recent disasters and I read Amazon gave 1 mil. Amazon is too busy trying to destroy every industry. I fully expect them to have a birthing room soon with a child care facility in the middle and a funeral home on the end very soon. Each day they announce getting into some new industry which takes down everything in that sector. Today it was the drugstores and yesterday it was the delivery sector. BOYCOTT AMAZON BECAUSE IT IS A CANCER AND THE WORLD CAN DO WITHOUT IT."
this dip allows me to buy more .thank you !
"Costco Reports Internal Control Issue, Sending Shares Lower."
I bought today.. if it's still down on Monday I will buy more.
technical indicators paints a bearish trend.
"Fly like an eagle, up, up to the sky."
COST is NOT China !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!buy on weakness........................
Morning/mid day dip and back up/higher in afternoon/close. Rinse and repeat.
COST way UNDERVALUED here.Great entry.
It's nonsense like this makes me more likely to hold put for a higher high vs. settling. O thought $310-$325 would be great but now I may just let it roll. Amazing numbers regardless of what was expected. Don't expect this dip the last long. It may not even last until tomorrow afternoon. 12% up March YoY while others are closed and/or losing money....hilarious really. Costco Rules
i feel the ongoing debates are having effect on the stocks in general and on price of Costco. I am afraid the markets would trend down towards Friday.
We may be at a bottom in the 206 area.
Beat earnings by 3 cents. Prepare for green at market open tomorrow. Ignore any idiots and market manipulators bringing price down after and pre-mkt.
as a new share holder.........the $10 div was a special one time deal is that correct?? got .....$2000 is that correct ........... its a one time deal?????????
Brace yourselves and expect that the sp might go down tomorrow. Its not because of earnings its because of the trade war. If it goes down just add more because sooner or later it will go back up and beyond $250. Not a matter of if but a matter of when.
"Nobody can beat Costco in retail, they's haven't even scratched the surface yet in the online world."
This drop might be due to stop loss investor placed and it took them all out so we'll see a bounce up tomorrow or next week
"Yup I’m giving up on the stock market. It’s a beat, why the massive loss??! Lmao smh"
Blow out earnings and sales. Congrats to all the longs!
I’ll get in at $150
I hope it goes even lower. Awesome buying opportunity!!
Huge BIG BLOCK BUYS came in early and one of them was mine. Will head into the green $$$
"market will be up 2maro ........ stocks like wmt ,cost ,apple qualcom , all will peak"
Stock will only rise as pandemic gets worse and worse over the next few months.I noted that Kleenex and paper towels had sold out again!This is Pandemic Phase Two and Costco will be a major benefactor.Past few weeks have been frustrating.
"over 37 PE now, way overpriced"
CramerBUUUUUUUYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY the dips
Why so cheap?
"(Bloomberg) -- Dairy Farmers of America Inc, the biggest U.S. dairy cooperative, is in advanced talks to acquire U.S. milk processor Dean Foods Co. But other would-be buyers could emerge.While discussions are taking place between DFA and Dean, no agreement has been reached for the purchase of all or some of the Dallas-based company’s assets, Monica Massey, executive vice president and chief of staff at DFA, said in an emailed response to questions. She didn’t speculate on prospective bidders.A deal could be a lengthy process, including an antitrust review. Any transaction would require an “extensive review of Dean Foods’ assets, thorough due diligence and other conditions, including approval from the Department of Justice and the Bankruptcy Court,” Massey said. Dean intends to file bidding procedures with the court to conduct a sale.“We have been monitoring Dean Foods’ financial performance closely since the business began showing signs of distress and have been preparing for various scenarios, including a bankruptcy filing, in order to minimize the impact to DFA,” Massey said. “Our farmer leaders and management have built our cooperative to withstand a situation like this. Our members and employees will get paid, schools will get milk, and dairy products will remain on the shelves across the country.”Dean Foods is the biggest customer of the Kansas City-based cooperative, which has around 14,500 family farmer members around the country. DFA is focused on “ensuring we have secure markets for our members’ milk,” she said.While Americans may be drinking less conventional milk, 94% of U.S. households also keep it in their refrigerators, Massey said. The dairy category as a whole remains strong, with cheese and butter at all-time consumption highs. Americans ate 2.5% more dairy in August than they did the year before, and the retail market is worth over $100 billion, she said."
$325-$330 tomorrow
"Road to $250 Begins, Very Bearish outlook ahead."
$300-325 coming
"no one wants this stock, too expensive"
Good time to get in?
$157 is the bottom and $162 will be here Monday.
this stock all of a sudden sux...was so happy to have it..not so much anymore
"Costco has extremely loyal customers, and the prices beat Amzn almost across the board. The New Item offerings are fantastic, along with the research that goes behind the products they sell. Good luck trying to chizzle off any kind of meaningful customer base from them. Load up on Cost."
Earnings will surprise people. This stock will trade around $405 by EOY
"Costco is a company that can go up againsts Walmart. Cheap deals, everything you need and more. Going to costco personally, I see good things coming long term!"
Lower margin but higher profit was because of GAS which has lower margin. cost sold a lot of it. As long as profit goes higher then lower margin is ok.
There was nothing in this ER that will cause any significant selling in this minimally turbulent time. Weak retail hands will sell but big $$$ will hold and ADD.
"We probably will beat earnings, but question is will stock shooting up like nike?"
COST can easily recoverin a HURRY..........................................
I guess these earnings aren't good enough for the investors so they sell!
The financials and fundamentals have not changed in most of the companies that have sold off today. As soon as we receive some positive news on the containment of this coronavirus the ALGO's will kick in and these stocks will shoot up and again be on fire. I'll be buying small (10-20) share sizes on all dips for the next few days and if so weeks..
I sold my $300 calls today for a $15 per call profit. Then I picked up $315 straddles for about $4 each way. I have a feeling we're either going to go to 300 or 330 after the news today.
Where are the bashers today???????
The problem with food delivery is: many stores tried that before and no one was successful. People tend to see product before buying and eating it. Delivery food... doh how come those eggs so small today.
Already 1.5 million traded. The daily average volume is 2.1 million! Awesome!!!!!!
sell offcontinues.
guys next week going down to 187+\- $2 then the journey towards 215+ bwfore special dividend announcment any comments
"buy WHEN THERE IS panic !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!cost ALWAYS BOUNCES BACK AS USUAL !NOTHING HAS CHANGED HERE , SALES CONTINUE TO EXCEED EXPECTATIONS."
I am a day trader and can't figure out the stock going down the last 2 days. Maybe went up too fast..my leaps are hurting but love the stock and will bare the loses. Any feedback?
Thumbs up for over 310 after earnings. Thumbs down for under 300 after earnings. Let the voting begin!
a good old fashioned sell off coming its friday
global meltdown.........................CRAMER says get out NOW.....................................................
who is selling?
Who was the clown who said Cost traffic would be down in Q4 due to weather?
You can tell the haters! But you can’t tell them much!When you live your life on the negative you are miserable! Lose money all you want but give the rest of us a break from your hatred for all things America!
"people all trading on technicals these days. so I suggest every one go with the flow. short term trades only, forget abt investing or you get burned. no one cares about findamentals anymore"
Increase the dividend!
anyone think we will have one of those Tesla earnings where we can go up $59
"I'm happy that Funue says he has 'muted' me... however, we all know that he isn't capable of actually doing it. That would require self-discipline.I guess he was really embarrassed by his own posts. The truth is a very powerful thing."
You better cover shorty. This will see $270 before it ever sees $220.
COST is down 5.21% to 295.11
Wow. Bit of an overreaction. Earnings beat. Good guidance and I guess its bots and stop loss. Nice.
"Expnesive, margin is very small, dividend is pretty generous"
"AMZN's P/E ratio is 245, COST's P/E ratio is 28.6. Who's over valued?"
"Walmart rises, Costco soars"
Big numbers ladies and gentlemen It’s a beat with solid guidance
"earnings for some reason always fail, I think wall St. expects too much"
"Does appear that Buffet had it correct. Stock is is overvalued at this point in time. Had be down for past three months despite good numbers. Great company, great products. But stock has gotten over valued."
GLTA tomorrow. keep an eye on that cc though.
This stock is a joke...... Never again
Donald Trump is mentally ill. Lying is one thing but this sick individual lies to his own supporters - he cannot help himself.He needs professional help.
"Ahh, duffus Bernstein just wants to get in the great run starting after Oct 4th earnings ."
"I've been looking for a good entry point for Costco, but keep missing it because this company just keeps getting better and better. Costco is here to stay. Good luck to all!"
Last quarter dropped $5 after hours only to be $5 higher next day
not surprised to see $1000 very soon on upgrades.
$276 limit orders
"starting to come down, sell and lock in your profits. Don't be greedy!"
"Going right back to $250 and up after great earnings tomorrow!!!Gordon Caskett has a dingo in his back door, why pull this act 1 day before earnings? No brainier is the Duche has an alternative agenda for sure."
CNBCCOST is way too cheap here compared to others.looking for dips.. if any.
All gains of last 2 days gone. No traction at all.
BOOM!
clean up in aisle 5 in corona store......
"I will be loading up 500 shares right before closing on Monday! Folks, if you looking for $10 Divvy. You have to buy before Market close Monday and can sell on Dec 1."
Waiting for shorts to bring it back down.........................then BBUUUYYYYY
COST is breaking records today!!!
Watch out. Cramer jinx the stocks and ask everyone to take profit. Either people will create volume for institutions to kill you when you short or the stock will drop 5% on profit take
The daily morning selloff continues followed by the evening bounce back. Great trading environment.
COST usually disappoints
its almost if somebody has an endless buy in at 273 and everytime it hits 273 it just absorbs the shares and never moves. talk about manipulation
"They announced their special $7 divvy a week ago. It was around $176 and change. Now it is $182 and change. The reason is everybody wants that divvy and there are few sellers. So next time they announce a monster divvy, get in quick."
"Up 45% for the FY. Solid stock in this uneasy market. Executed .15 above EPS, missed on revs according to analysts....We need a score card to rate analysts and there speculations. Buying more!"
Time to buy BOX
There is no competition with Amazon. Costco sells in bulk and food is only a percentage of their offering. Over reaction.
could have sold this at the special dividend like most did...and bought back in...thats sad...investors took that special dividend and ran
"the issue is the Bulls are not buying the stock because they are waiting for weak hands to sell here,, and drive it down to 149 level"
Lets see how things go. Have some calls ready for this ER
I just saw the guy walk by to change the computer BOT'S to the buy side :)No kidding. Elevator up?
selling over bounce coming
"Best stock in retail, Costco has over 100 million members and their every email marketing with super offers is amazing. No extra cost to advertise no spilling unbelievable business model, continues sales growth of 6-7% a month is never heard of.VERY BEST STOCK TO BUY AND HOLD"
"why is everyone ARGUING how great COSTCO is,,,the stock is what matters and how many are not happy the stock has dropped from 169 to 154,,, NO ONE,,,so shorts and longs are killing it"
Amazon WILL PUT EVERYONE OUT OF BUSINESS. Costco membership doesn't even provide free delivery nor does it provide consumers streaming video.
"IMO, this has to retest 341 support. Overbought for now. I am not buyer, but seller."
"elinek also pointed out that Costco employees receive two bonuses each year up to $4,000 combined. The average hourly wage, which includes those bonuses, at Costco is around $24, he said. TIME TO UNLOAD THIS TURKEY. NO SENSE AS TO COST CONTROLS."
wow big drop
just went to Costco's - cant find a spot to park and waited 20 minutes to checkout ; every register was going full tilt ; seems like a no brainer to me!
What does COST have to do with China deal ??????????????????????????????????NOTHING.............................
Amazon is actually helping COST by eliminating some of the grocery stores competition !!!!!!their store sales have already started to reflect this.
"The way people have been stocking up on supplies, I expect March sales numbers to be way up. Just driving past our local Costcos the last few weeks, they have full lots. I'm hoping and expecting for a stock price jump this evening, but I am staying short on it."
"I was at Costco today. I shop there often. Usually multiple times per week. Today was one of the busiest days I have EVER seen. This includes holidays and event shopping. I’m not sure what was going on but if Costco can have this many people literally packed in their warehouses, there certainly isn’t a need for mail-in ballots (side point). Main point being, things sure are picking up wherever you go. People are tired of being tied down. Pent up demand is starting to show. IMHO Markets are going to pop soon! Hold on tight!!!"
I think its going to 175 soon
"Immediate stock price dip following good quarterly earnings has happened repeatedly, followed by several days of price increases to sound levels for this solid company. This past quarter was glaring—declines in the few days preceding the announcement, big drop in the futures immediately following the announcing, not so big drop by the end of the first trading day, and then rebound to near new highs in the days that followed. WHY ANY SELLOFF FOLLOWING PRETTY CONSISTENT GOOD RESULTS ....the pattern makes for an obvious buying opportunity for a good company!"
Bull Traps all day.
Close 348.00??
3 upgrades already !!! Go Costco Go !!
Analyst Actions: Atlantic Equities Starts Costco Wholesale at Overweight With $375 Price TargetNOW we're talking how Costco will indeed make it to $400+ this yr. Oh Yeah!
"The Wall St. Traders react to anything, regardless of whether it affects a particular stock or not. It is a sad state of affairs and unfortunately causes alarm and damage and consequently takes much to long for a stock to recover. Best bet is ride it out, Don't sell!!"
goingGREEN soon...............................
Special dividen announced of. 65 cents Stock is up after hours.
Under 300.00 a steal !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fantastic news !
"Why down today: (I see this as a buying opportunity)Costco's March sales slowdown due to social distancing likely hit other retailers too, analysts sayBY MarketWatch— 1:02 PM ET 04/09/2020Costco stock slipped 2% in Thursday trading after March sales results"
Best prices and quality just at COSCO.
Just loaded another 2000sh at $150.35 this morning. I will certainly gain a double next month...Good price for today!!!
300 by eoy.
"Amazing, all those non-regular nonsense posters are all gone and we're headed back over $300+ for good!"
Away we go................................................COST is a no brainier here .................... look for more UPGRADES soon.
This wants to close at 325 going into earning call at 4 but market downdraft is pulling it hard
The Buy Back amount will be very interesting. They usually always get it right. Just wait and see. You will be impressed.
310.00-315.00 soon
325 tomorrow？
report decent but 'investors' are selling. Why? Because with the AMAZON effect people realize this stock is just too expensive. The market is changing and those in this stock will NOT see the appreciation going forward vs. the past. With margins weak at best this stock will have pricing pressure. There are just other retail companies to explore with reasonable pe's and expectations.
"Soon as Virus treatment is found , you will see COST pop to 335.00-345.00"
Why falling with good ER?????
holds ok could be much lower today
"COST beat on eps 1.9 vs 1.71, but missed on revenue 37B vs 37.25B. mixed results."
"the economy is so good its over for stocks,"
Thanks for thoseSILLY DIPS.......................
"Doesn't matter at what time I go, I always find the Costco parking lots full. So, I did what any sensible man would do. I purchased some COST shares. Good luck to longs. This should be 400+ by year end."
Hopefully my last comment comes to reality that 338 support got a strong back and should support us
#2 testing
I predict COST will announce a 3 for 1 split which is pushing the stock up this week. Word has slipped out causing inside information buying.
"INTERESTING HOW LAST 12 MINUTES COSTCO DROPS NEARLY 3 POINTS. THATS 1 % TOTAL VALUE....GONE.... IN LESS THAN 12 MINUTES !!! THATS WHAT THE SHARKS SEE IN THIS COMPANY. WEAK. LOW PROFIT MARGINS. TIME FOR ANOTHER EMPLOYEE RAISE. YEAH, FORGET ABOUT TRYING TO CURB EXPENSES."
Its all machine trading now...................................CAPITULATION needed.
Not sure why the stock is down.
"Costco has earned a stature and respect from the entire economic spectrum. That’s incredible. You can feel it when you think of it in relation to target or Walmart. They may all sell the same thing, but all folks will né comfortable buying them from Costco while some may not want to buy them from target or Walmart. But will this difference continue after Walmart I’m On my way! eta the Amazon model of annual membership free and free and fast shipping? I think lots more people will buy Walmart because of it. And that means that Costco will Jane yo compete and do the same thing. Will Costco be able to pull it off ....considering that Costco members already pay an annual membership fee? That seems like a big question that needs an answer. Any thought?"
Walmart + COSTCO = competition for AMAZON !look out if that happens
This quarter earning will break records. Maybe they will open a couple more stores paid in full with it lol
"And just like that......in just 2 trading days, Cost is up over $8 lol. Gotta love that lol"
Turned GREEN!
4:15 earnings
People don't return things they will eventually use Judge. That is a wholey insane assumption.
Wait for pullback......................
Lock down again? Time to buy 6 gallon of mayonnaise
Costco was a little over 100 a few months ago now 160 people crying about a little dropwell the drop is justified because there is going to be a huge price war between walmart kroger aldis and amazon and costco is going to suffer from this.It is going back to 100 so you better get out as it is overpriced and overhyped retail sales fell .3% and now you have the above mentioned price wars squeezing marginsDon't liste to pumpers who want to sell their shares to you get out asao or lose your gains !
400 coming to a theater near you. This stock is awake with both eyes open.

usa needs deal more than china ....so deal will.b done at sooonest ....no tariff on sunday ..market will rise 5 percent
Typical market overreaction. Don't get fooled into selling.
just look at this junk..markets up huge...and costco in a downward spiral....the problem here is..the pandemic is pretty much over..the hoarding shopping is done..compared to Walmart this stock is way over priced..twice the price of WM..why invest here...costco stock is in trouble..
"The market is reacting to the fact that that the Democrats are taking the house in January. Every body is absolutely terrified. They are going to raise taxes ON EVERYBODY. They are going destroy all the progress that has been with this administration. Just look at the economy now compared to the last disaster on ""president """
I'm ready for the day trading profits to pour into this bull with about 30 minutes to spare until close.
I COVERED YESTERDAY////PEOPLE PUT STOP LOSS AND BROKERS CAN SEE AND BRING DOWN TO TAKE SHARES THEN NEXT DAY THEY TAKE IT UP
"Where are Costco consumers getting all the cash to buy supplies? This is the only place where the tab is over several hundred dollars. Even ""whole paycheck"" (Whole Foods Market) does not compare. I finally got a package of toilet paper early on Thursday. Lines were unbelievable and no IDs were checked. One downside: there were so many people in the store that it could have been an incubation chamber for Covid-19. Happy to see the regular customer greeters and cashiers. One had a 3M N95 mask, so she must have been pretty resourceful to find one in HI. Suggestion to the CEO: Let the seniors purchase masks at discount prices, assuming the gubmint is able to free up production capacity within the U.S. That will require use of national powers by the Prez."
"It is time for a split, so the little guys can get in!"
"WMT, AMZN all hittuting all time highs..why not Cost...let's go COST"
Bought this garbage at 378 a share because I was under the impression COST couldn’t lose. What a bone head I am. Dropping this trash at a loss. Figures.
"As shopping continues to shift away from brick-and-mortar stores to e-commerce, the worst days for traditional American retailers are ahead. There is no membership fee, parking, time and gas.Kirkland and Costco are too expensive with lousy services and membership fee."
A stock split at these levels would be nice...thoughts?
Great buying opportunity to pick up some COST shares! Good luck all!
Super beatRev +14.7%.e-Commerce sales +75.8%.
Told ya the bleeding has just begun! $290 open tomorrow
"I just wonder if its the algorithm that is messing things up? dont know anyone who has sold, dont know why this stock is falling, it's one of the best"
It's moving with the NASDAQ today. Hopefully it breaks away and moves up.
Whisper is Special Annual Dividend for buying all their TP stock
AMAZON = no competition for Costco !!!!!sorry shorts but you BURN again.............................Sales increase and higher margins continue with COST.
"...love my Costco stock, owned it since 2012 and hung on to 300 shares and I’ll be here when they lay the next (special dividend) golden egg"
"I think most people fall in love with Costco products and services, and in return willing to pay a high stock price. But bottom line to make money in stocks, it is valuation, valuation and valuation. Looking at the company's PE, profit margin, operation margin, ROE, revenue and profit growth and compared that to other retail stores, then you will see why the COST price is bit pricey."
Costco needs to announce stock split in order to hold the share price keeps falling. Its stock price is so high that traders think they sell Costco stock to use the funds to invest somewhere else such as Apple or other to get higher and quicker returns.
costblo must sell some good dope.
"No hurry to buy, market so badwill fall sharply"
COST forming a bottom...........................last chance to load on cheap shares............watch for upgrades !jmho

Selling old stale products doesn't work.Told ya so.
New target increased to 241.00
the days of Costco ramping up $15-20 increases are done
its sad to see this stock just crumbling before our eyes...once one of the best stocks anyone could own.
Costco Wholesale is down 6.38% to 283.00
Needs a haircut of 10-20%....to justify the valuation.
what time is conference call?
Well there goes the dividend. 
Costco is the best they said. Profitable stock they said. Down thousands now from my purchase point.
"Most who post here have no clue as to what they are saying about the special dividend, I recommend selling your shares in Costco and go down to your local credit union open a savings account(rate = .0001%) and select your free toaster on the way out. Just unbelievable.!"
POSITIVE THINKING: RISE RISE RISE RISE RISE
Costco is king... great stock...perhaps their management should offer a special membership price to Sam Clubs members that were screwed by Walmart.... Charlie M...Marketing Exe
"N T E C has optionsN B R V as well.when the russell 200 starts moving 250 million and lower biotechs best place to be.Sector rotation out of other areas, software, security, retail etc.if goog beats apple to a watch phone without a cell needed nearby and possibly a short range wakie talkie, you'll get more than that.wow aapl really strong lately, something is likely up we don't know...because goog bought fit I wonder if both are close to watch phones without cell needed nearby?guys snap work off of not with facebooks portal.once those last 3 market makers still not finished loading let go of their lean dows back and forth, ntec goes right over 3 dollars, market cap is insanely cheap like nbrv... push downs are over, likely two or three weeks of biotech gains in a row while both hedge funds and mutual funds accumulate the cheapest biotechs at 2015 levels.It sure feels like the right time, 5g is as fast or faster than fios fiber optic which was inanity.When baba drops it sure drops just as tsla does. 3 trading weeks still left 4 biotech gains, nowhere else for sure though on % gainers level.load on cheap biotechs for jan, feb fund accumulation."
Worst ER out of all the retailers. Total disaster...sit tight...going to be bumpy ride down towards $200
Costco Wholesale reached an all time high at 334.85
"Costco has very good management and relation with the upcoming generation(s), I expect it to continue to go up in the long run."
Nice bounce 
We'll soon see in a single day Costco surging up 10 - 15% up. That'll be $30+ up. Then all Will be normal again.
Seriously looking for a green close today. Will eat a hat if it happens
Such a resilient stock. Amazing.
"""I like this A LOT. Smart company, smart management. I am a member, don't own the shares, but no reason not too.""My other post...Well, BRK-B owns Costco, so no need to really. But I like Costco."

"**BREAKING NEWS COSTCO MISSED HUGE !PRICED at **32** TIMES EARNINGS Bloodbath for longs in coming days and weeks and institutions sell off !Smartest thing you can do is get out NOW ASAP it is170.79 AH I will reference this post in 30 days to show you how much you lost because you ignored common sense and cold hard facts !Earnings per share came in at $1.17, below the $1.36 expected by Wall Street analysts. Revenue came in at $29.13 billion, below expectations for $29.86 billion.Same-store sales were also a disappointment, rising 3% against expectations for a 3.5% increase. Same-store sales in the U.S. were up 3% during the quarter and were up 8% in Canada during this period, thought other international same-store sales fell 2%."

"I haven't seen a release announcing the quarterly the dividend. It's usually announced two weeks before the x-date, which should be this week. So the announcement should have been two weeks ago. But there hasn't been one."
Downward trend must mean people know earnings will be horrific? Really?
the manipulation is insane lol. i feel sorry for people who sell
i added more. 295. thank you
"Bravo to Costco. Costco allowed members over 60 years of age to enter their stores at 8 AM this morning. Costco pays their employees a living wage, they have the best quality products at the best prices. And today they allowed senior citizens who are most vulnerable to the Coronavirus to shop an hour before the rest of their customers. Costco is a socially responsible company!Bravo Costco!!!"

Y down
It’s Monday. 12 pm. At Costco. Been 15 minutes and still no parking.
I'd rather see a 2 for 1 stock split than a special dividend.
Any info on China store sales?
Anyone know when the div will be declared ?

BERNSTEIN IS GETTING PAID for silly unjustified Downgrade !!!!
well those people all going from Costco to rite aid sure has not worked out. rite aid (RAD) just hit a new 5 year low $4.28. so Kenny is long RAD at $8 and short COST at $113. how does he do it?
You long should pray hard for COST. Any miss earnings will put COST back to the $180 level. Believe it!
Can someone tell me how you think Costco is overvalued. A lot of people have stated that its overvalued without facts to back it. Anybody?
"With a forward PE of 36, stock is too expensive especially with recession looming"
"EPS was $2.14 per diluted share, miss from $2.45 expected!"
Godamit man I should of resaerched how this ticker reacts to earnings before i got call options #$%$ i just got burned
I do not believe COST will go down 5 bucks tomorrow. If it does I will buy more. Sad state of affairs when Americans are to lazy to shop at a local supermarket. I was at Costco this weekend and it was packed. Do you really want someone else buying your food? I have never bought anything from AMZN and never will.
“Costco wins big in China”
The run on TP and paper towels is on again. Idiots! Costco just got in pallets of both today and every cart had one of each whether they needed it or not. They ran out within 30 minutes and a whole isle was overflowing with the product. What is wrong with people? Costco will always do well. The place was packed and every checker had a back up line of customers.
"It likes to bounce off the 50dma. A bit surprising that this stock keeps destroying previous sales records and then freefalls 4%+, and a divvy to boot."
COST to administer Vaccines soon !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!look for silly dips as BUY here.............................
most members demand more value! wholesale options? less parity with retail values
Quality product already selling at $wmt and $cost. Beyond meat is the only real competition. They are at $150 a share. These are bargain prices I see $40 PT easy. They are only growing.
we are almost there........................................get $$$$ ready..................................
Excellent company but Costco's stock is rather boring. I got in at $303 in the first half of 2020 and will be looking to sell once the stock sell will qualify for long-term capital gains treatment.
Timberrrrrrrrrrrr
this manure can never do good at earnings..even when the numbers are good. it still drops...
"P/E of COST is 36, but it should be 16 to 20. Clearly over-valued."
be ready for under 200 this month
"The price is high because the performance has been strong and the outlook is bright. Same store numbers have been solid, e-commerce growth has been ample, and new market opening—i.e., China—portends great opportunity. When I read the earnings release, I was happy. When I saw the markets initial negative reaction, I disagreed and felt that the market got it wrong (but I was humble enough to wonder if I didn’t comprehend the market and analysis). I stuck to my philosophy that this is a strong company that has a price cent track record and bright prospects, and is the kind of company one should invest in if one has a long term view of things. Based on that, I expected that the price would recover in a matter of weeks, but I was proven wrong in that because it took only hours."
"It's about margin comprehension Amazon is going to put so much pressure on everyone throughout the food supply chains to lower cost. This will be a great time for the consumers, not so much for the suppliers, distributors and retailers. including Costco. Amazon won't care for a long long time if they lose $$$$ in groceries."
"weak. so disappointing. all those that bought early March. projection was NOT to be down 10% down, it was for a big pop considering their surge in sales due to the pandemic. this was so disappointing."
"I purchase huge at Amazon, and had not been at costco lately. But just went to costco 5 times in the last two months. Really enjoyed the experience of loading up on chocolate almonds, organic produce, wild smoked salmon, the best socks you can buy, the best authentic kirkland brand true organic olive oil better than whole foods brand. I also bought a cal king mattress that I love and they helped me load it in the store and in the parking lot. Amazon biggest problem is the shipping, and Costco does not have that problem. I am long Costco."
now what
Big Boys almost done loading up....................................told youBUY the silly dips.................. COST always OUNCES BACK !
gotta love it when someone puts so much effort into persuading a yahoo board

HD just went down hard.. HD PE of 22.. COSTCO pe of 25 still.

"What a nice day for us Costco stock holders day after earnings, only getting better IMO."
"Costco said February comparable sales rose 11.7%, excluding the impact of fuel and currency fluctuations. The company added that concerns related to the coronavirus outbreak had boosted comparable sales by about 3%.The company has lately been seeing customers queue up at its stores, much like they do during the holiday season, to stock up on essentials, including disinfectants, paper towels and soups, as they prepare for potential coronavirus quarantines. (Reporting by Praveen Paramasivam in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri)"
Costco is a gem it will thrive whether or not we have a pandemic
"you can buy anything cheaper from amazon now, shipped to your home. Why bother?"
such easy money. no other stocks like this one easily make you money
COST traffic increases by 28%
Tradergirl learn how to read charts and see a trend in stocks. Until u do that I’ll advise you to stop wasting your hard earned money investing.
Trough is in.
Crammmmer is saying it is time to buy COST. We will see if he is right. He said that starting on Tuesday might be a good time to buy
"you can see the negative trading on costco,, each day they are shorting it down,, looks like costco up days are done with,,,not the company the stock,,"
America is now in a recession - who will this idiot of a president blame for his incompetence??
Looking to add more320.00-330.00
every time i go to costco it is packed and people spend an a barrage of 300 dollars. someone is working hard to keep this stock down.
This whole situation doesn't make sense. Costco won't be affected by anything involving Amazon/WF. It is 2 different biz models. Costco's growth plans are aggressive and double-digit growth is foreseeable for the next 5 years. Tonight they post June sales. We'll see what the market thinks about that.
"Look folks, to cry about this stock being down right now is like a spoiled rich kid complaining about getting a new Corolla instead of a Mustang on his 16th birthday. Theses are not normal times. Be happy you didn’t take a 50% haircut like so many other companies stock out there."

"this is madness! it's just 1 warehouse in china. even if it generates millions per month in sales, it doesn't justify the billions of market capitalization it added today. also, china already has walmart selling in bulk. these valuations are insane."
"At this price, we are below 2017 P/E levels on one of the only companies that survived the pandemic without nosediving. This punishment is undeserved. Let's go back to $360."
My thoughts on COST http://www.shortmetina.com/hot-stock-picks.html
Buy the SQQQ options !!! this has broken an important trendline to the upside with a objective of 16.
couple more months for that special div baby
"In order for COST to succeed, they need to increase their web presence majorly! Their website is the first place they should start."
Costco packed today
Either way this one is a winner
"Analysts were largely pleased with the results. Oppenheimer's Rupesh Parikh reiterated an Outperform rating and $ 335 price target on Costco shares. ""Given the recent earnings per share miss out of the way, we now see a brighter shorter and longer-term outlook for Costco shares,"" he writes. The analyst slots Costco next to Dollar General(DG) as his top food retailing pick"
See you in the new year.

COST is one of my favorite dividend growth stocks. I talk about dividend growth stocks on my youtube channel. The channel is really focused on new and beginner investors looking to invest in dividend growth stocks and ETFs. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrg6IDPf4a7pUKTN90n6syg
Buying more today!
some said they were selling @ $310 I think they sold to soon.
Reversal
COST reported great holiday numbers. I reported this early on the board and yahoo removed my post. Why is that?
Costco apparently has a company policy where they say they award their shareholders. What a FYI king joke.
does anyone else feel like cost has peaked?
"as an outsider looking in, Costco is on one of my watchlists, I have never seen costco with red numbers over the last 4 months. Its always green. Quite amazing"
New Target 210.00way undervalued here.
COST and AAPLMust own.................... dont trade !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"This is crazy. Almost a 33 PE ratio for a retail stock. I love this stock, but it is getting stretched too faar and its time for a pullback"
COST=$$$
Hitting ATH today
"What the hell, I guess I'll renew my membership for the 31st time in February. Only a shareholder since 2005, but that $6000 special dividend just received helps soften the blow of the $120 executive membership..."
WE ABOVE OUR 50 DA MA AND 200 DA MA PRETTY GOOD SO THIS IS BULLISH SPECIAL DIV ON SEPT 24TH AND HIGHER THIS WILL GO
Online digital sales grew by 99%! I will take Costco anyway heading into a 2nd wave of COVID-19. Q4 and next Q1 will be huge ! BUY the dip!!

thanks 341.60
COST China news looks very very positive so far.
"I wonder if I am the only one who does not care for a special dividend. I rather the company uses the dividend to repurchase the stock. For tax purposes, a dividend is taxed as ordinary income. As long as I held on to the stock over a year, all the gains are taxed at long term gain. Unless the stock is being held in an IRA or 401K, there is tax consequence receiving dividend. If one is a long, would you rather get some of your money back and pay tax now or rather have the stock appreciates and take the gain when you sell later. Opinions are welcome!"

Costco Wholesale is down 5.78% to 280.23
"Costco said its sales for the 39 weeks ending in May are up 7.7% from last year to $120.19 billion.This is what we know of Costco's typical performance, OH YEAH!"
Warren not going to buy with a PE of 37and a yield less than 1%.Maybe Amazon?
This is stuck in a super tight range. Guess I’ll sell and move along...
"Why is the stock price languishing when Covid sales are booming and the special Dividend is a plus?Since Buffet sold out, stock price flat to negative."
People will not be eating out at restaurants any longer they will be going to grocery stores and warehouse is to prepare their own food too many risks wake up
"NOTICED COMMENTS THAT SHAREHOLDERS SEEM TO BE HAPPY WITH FALLING STOCK PRICE THINKING THEY CAN PICK UP SHARES EVEN CHEAPER. BETTER RE-EVALUATE THIS PREMISE. IT IS NOT....I REPEAT...NOT A BUY, WITH NARROWING PROFIT MARGINS AND GROWING EXPENSES. I HAVE A BETTER IDEA, TRY A 4 FOR 1 STOCK SPLIT, PLUS BUY BACK SHARES, RETURN DIVIDEND TO SHAREHOLDERS. THE STOCK IS TOO VOLATILE AND SHEDS 20 POINTS WITHIN DAYS AS A NORMAL FACET."
I'll never get back to even..I really thought costco was a good stock
"Costco , as of May 6th is making it MANDATORY that you can only enter the store wearing a mask. That's the end of me being a share holder of Costco. I refuse to shop at a store that forces me to wear a facemask. This will hurt the business, regardless if your a Snowflake or not. God bless the United States of America!"
costco to replenish all hurricane areas!
PRICE HAS NOT MOVED THE PAST 30 DAYS.
this stock will be $500 after this virus is over
remember those 2 minutes that we were in the green? good times.
I guarantee Costco will be over 300 in less than a month
"Earnings are just too risky nowadays, buy the rumor sell the news."
There will no longer be a special dividend. Increases to the quarterly dividend is a likely probability.
What time do they announce their ER today ?
"Forgot to mention. In Europe anyway, there has been a consistent push by value conscious buyers to find out who the underlying manufacturers are of white labelled goods are at a fraction of the cost at eg ALDI, Lidl, Costco etc. People are finding out eg Costco batteries are Duracell etc etc etc."
wait for 199.0000000000000000000000000000
Stock should be up at least $10.
why is cost dropping so much?
UPS had a huge day up almost $18...waiting for costco to break out
so lovely to see green.
Trump has lost his trade war. China's economy is still growing at 5% while US manufacturing is falling. This will take down COST also.
When the market goes back up then COST WMT don’t do well because they didn’t go down much last 4 weeks
if china stores succeeds then this will be 400+ by in another yr.
Cost will get multiple upgrades tomorrow.
"Keep bashing. Bloodbath market day. Earnings out, missed eps. Yet no major sellof#$%$rself why is that."
Great buying opportunity
Hello $350 tomorrow.
I'm not sure why I'm here...WMT is half the price...better movement...why am I stuck in costco?
We ordered 4 bags of large dog food. They delivered within an hour and cheaper than Amazon.
I have to be honest. If I had to choose between higher pay for their workers or the five dollar rotisserie chicken I would choose the chicken.
Bad earnings? Are you ppl on crack? These were great earnings and the following qtr will be much better considering seasonality. Thinks pls
No special dividend!
"Costco Defenders Come Out After Stock DowngradeCostco's debut in China was so successful that its Shanghai store had to close early because it couldn't handle the massive crowd, Cramer said, adding that the company decided within days to open a second location in the city.""That sure doesn't seem like a troubled, cannibalized business to me."" https://finance.yahoo.com/news/costco-defenders-come-stock-downgrade-155226044.html"
I’m out....waited for a good day to bail. Will wait for another pullback! Tx Costco! I asked cashier what’s going to happen when this turns the other way (hopefully soon!) and all the extra stuff starts coming back? She says they are already setting up for it...like Christmas but way more. GLTA
Will Meade @realwillmeade Hearing rumors that $COST #Costco could buy $APRN @blueapron1:29 PM - 10 Jul 2018
it will rise ..already high is 303 ...it is 20 usd down since september ...eps is good ...very minimal missed revenues ......rest all positive
"I think this stock is mbvaxed at $300...doednt seem to wander much from that, thasts where the big boys like it"
Average analyst target now at $332.
Don't read too much into afterhours trading. Costco will be one of few survivors when all this is done. Think long term.
why does this stock doesn't go anywhere stuck at low 300$? shouldn't it be flying like Amazon?
Keep selling... I keep buying
Anyone who buys anything on Amazon deserves to lose money on Costco stock. BECAUSE YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM.
"Next Thursday, COST's monthly sales number will come out, I guess that it will hit the bull eyes as usual. The stock itself is so expensive, buy I bet it will hit 300 by September."
tomorrow costco hitting 350!
COST needs a bailout. Then it will be up $40 today. This market is a joke. It rewards failing Companies.
Anyone know when the board meeting is?
139 000 members the first day in China thats amazing 300 here we come
Thatza bingo!!’
"I am above the water, large volume and big hammer formed on the bottom."
There are 300 million people in the USA and Costco at 280. There are 1.3 billion people in China. Common sense this stock is going north of 500
Last chance to BUY here310-312.00
"A millionaire through Costco stock, that is! I retired from Costco after 37 years!! Great company!!!"
Shorts better cover or they will be setting up a GoFundMe to cover their L
"Doesn’t seem to matter when I go to Costco, there are lots of people buying. I noticed this 11 years ago and bought some stick and have held onto it. It’s been my best stock investment."
"darn it. I had sold covered call with 230 strike, Oct 26 expiration. 3 days later for this drop, and my call would have saved me a lot of money.oh well, just work a year longer now I guess"
"Amazon is a cancer and if you shop there, you are helping the enemy."
"Oil stocks are dropping like lead balloons. They are paying 10 to 15 % dividends. If you purchased Boeing 3 days ago, you would be up 60% today. The market has been dropping and there are bargains everywhere. Costco is holding its value very well in this down market. Most companies are not doing good in current environment. Noticing the long lines at all Costco stores recently, the next earnings report will be spectacular. I do not expect the Costco would double in price after this COVID-19 or the oil Sales are over. However, I am pretty sure that Costco would come out this COVID-19 in a good shape. People with cash are looking for bargains at the moment. Since Costco did not drop like the other stocks, it does not look like a bargain. Personally, I like Costco and I picked up 100 shares at closing 03/25/20. I am in for the long haul. When a stock goes down 50%, it would take a 100% upward move to break even. In this kind of market, I rather play it safe but most are looking for higher profits. This is probably the reason the Costco is not moving up in price as the demand is not much."
AH manipulation!...the stock should go up tomorrow!
I love that drop.
COST and AAPLUpgraded !
I’ll be buying at $275 next week
325.00-330.00looking to add more.
Still out of Kirkland toilet paper and Perdue panko chicken nuggets? And so much overstocked stuff that just does not and will not sell.Come on and get your act together and re-stock the stuff that sells.
Look for the silly DIPS to add more290.00
sold..didnt want to..but this is just broken
Now that I sold At 307 this pos is moving north
AMAZON deal probably NOT going to go through !!!!!
Build Costcos they will come.
Buy the dip. The 350s are now cheap for COST. 400 will be here soon.
Seems that Costco survived the Amazon impact
Did the sales numbers come out. AH is up $4.
"Yes yes, the 20+ year up trend will be broken tomorrow and it will be down 50$ after crushing estimates... You shorts are not very bright are you"
Great quater! just hold tight!
I'm not worried with the pullback today. 5 Consecutive trading days in the green. It will be fine.
going green ???????
"Seems many are upset over the resent decline... This is not a stock to day trade or keep short term. Costco recently issued a special dividend at $10 a share which drove the price up because of those who wanted to cash in and subsequently the company would drop the sp $10 on the first day all the qualifying shares were locked in. After that, you have the people who were trying to cash in, begin to sell resulting in a drop in sp. Not only that but many companies have year end drops, that's just the way it is... But just remember this... Employees have 401K options to buy/invest in the company every paycheck. Don't have exact numbers but it'll be safe to say that the majority of employees over 3yrs employment are investing in the company. So consider all the those thousands of employees buying Costco shares every payday on a constant bases... You feel me??? Costco is solid and will continue succeed!"
another red day
"One of the things I love about COST's financials is that they have zero debt, $13 billion in cash, and $6 billion free cash flow. Lots of cash, generating lots of cash, and zero debt. Margins are razor thin but they are in the grocery business so that's normal. FCF yield is nearly 4 percent...not great but not too shabby either. Overall I think future cash flows for COST will only grow bigger over time...that's why I remain a bull and have a price target of $500 over the next few years."
"buy, easy money"
Someone tar and feather me for buying ACB at $7 last year when I could have bought COST instead..
"Costco will end the day 310+, if no new rTump screws the day."
Special dividend mentioned on conference call?
UPGRADED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!buy and hold here.................................................
Buffet is loading up
If you don’t want temporary headaches stay away from Costco for now. It will probably bottom around 355.
"WELL IM IGNORING AFTER HOUR NOW ! FAK IT. IF GOD WANTS ME TO EARN MONEY, MY CALL WILL BE VALUEABLE TOMORROW, IF NOT JUST LET IT GO, I DONT CARE ANYMORE., ITS FRIDAY! FAK IT"
I sat on the fence for 3 weeks about joining (http://Fairstox.com) for their weekly picks. Big mistake. COST exploded and I completely missed out. Don’t make the same mistake I made. Join them today
"once the best stock available, been here a long time...now a low to mediocre stock..can't hold any gains...sad to see this falter"
"In regards to this stock, I think we'll see a turnaround to the upside a lot sooner than we think. Something is being factored in, I think. Could it be the see senate race too?"
the irony couldn't be funnier....i can't stop laughing.
"curious to see what happens tomorrow, shouldn't pay attention too heavily to after-hours trading in my opinion"
bad economy and costco still goes up big..hope it continues...sign of a good stock
will see low 170s
We are maintaining our BUY rating on Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) and raising our target price to $330 from $315

"I am curious, how many who post on this board have Prime? I assume everyone who posts here own Costco stock, but I am curious how many shop on Prime."
"Everyone talking about millennials not being COSTCO type shoppers. Generation before them is, and they're not dead yet. In 15-20 years that argument will matter. Love my Costco gas, Costco lunch, Costco travel, and Costco price. This is a winner"

Who cares about EPS beat during covid times honestly XD I don't get investors*Traders*

"Where's my little sailor-suited sissy Grimmikins (aka Stephen) to celebrate with his customary ""love that drop"" post?Grimmikins (aka Stephen) was the sailor-suited l'il sissy that bragged last year to all how he shorted COST at $113.C'mon, Grimbelina....step up and take your enema, ya l'il Mommy-moochin', sailor-suited sissy....."
Nice movement over the past few days!
Amazon eyeing Costco next. Bulk up.
"Costco May be out of toilet paper, bleach and water......but that’s not enough to keep this propped up. Tanking in ah’s."
It broke the 240 support It’s next support level is 215This will tank hard tomorrow
"Just sold my Puts for a quick $500 profit. Hope it pops on bogus FED news and will buy back in..................GOING DOWN FOLKS...over bought, over valued and economy slowing....not good!!!!!!"
Here comes 275
Down 5 bucks
"COST management has done a great job keeping the experience and brand and offerings at very high levels. This is a reliable company with a focused and strong management. Regarding e-commerce: I think that fast, inexpensive or free delivery are critical. If COST can connect with—get the message to— consumers in this regard, the e-commerce business will jump!!!! The confidence and trust in the company already exist; what’s needed is that delivery, returns, etc with the -commerce business is just as fast, easy and inexpensive as amazon."
"cost, the one of only several real good value stocks without bubbles in market now"
There is Life after AMAZON ......................Less competition the better for COST.BBBBUUUUYYYYYYYY
"p/e of 37, single digit growth.The cost bubble will end badly. target price: $250"
The stock market is rampaging. Up 35% in past month. Where is the volume though?
Serving a $1.50 hot dog & soda is now more labor intensive.
380 soon... shorts are still not covered :)
"Costco should really be raising their prices on a few item such as their $1.50 hot dog plus large drink to say $1.75 to $2.00. This is something they sell a lot of which they've never increase the price of. There's also their $5 rotisserie chicken, they must sell tons of those a day."
opening over the next years in China will bring this stock to huge numbers.
I understand shareholders are to receive the special dividend of $10. per share payable on the 11th of December. Could someone please explain why the shares opened up $10. lower Tuesday morning than Monday’s closing? Thank you.
Ouch
"Nice to be correct once in a while, I posted that after last weeks earning ""we could be good for $30+"", YESSS!"
400 after earnings
The lower it goes ...the HARDER it BOUNCES back !
"COSTCO VS SAMS/WALMART---COSTCO IS CHEAP VS WMT. IF PRICE DROPS BUY BUY BUY BUY MORE IT WILL PAY OFF IF PEOPLE BOUGHT ON MARGIN THEY DUMB LET THEM SELL U BUY MORE MORE MORE. IF YOU GO TO COSTCO AND SEE THE CROWD AND AMOUNT OF SHOPPING ON LINE AND STORE U WOULDNT BE SELLING THIS STOCK.Wal-Mart has split its stock 11 times since going public in 1970. But there doesn't seem to be any magical share price that triggers the split. For instance, it split shares in August 1975 when the stock was $23 but also in April 1999, when the stock was $89.75."
two back to back green days a rarity here
Love my Costco but they need to up their game on major appliances. Minimum 2 week delivery decided I couldn’t wait paid $100 more at Lowes and it was there the next morning.
This is looking more and more undervalued every time I look at this.. it hasn’t hit my average price but I’m looking to add as I really like how they’re progressing towards e-commerce as well as dominating brick and motor
Not cool
Short covering big time
COST is down because people no longer to spend like they have been 4 weeks ago.

"AMZN is like EF Hutton. ""When Amazon talks, people listen,"" lol. My god look at CVS and WBA. Ouch!!"
Picked up 500. This will be up $3.00+ tomorrow.
"wow, red...."
Sell all the cost shares before it 's too late.
I sold my shares at 300 last week #$%$
Charlie Munger (Buffet's partner) portfolio is like 30% Costco.... good enough for him... good enough for me.
Took wife to Costco $700 poorer and no TV.
MISSED! wow
dammit..after hours looks good should have stayed
"COST is Investors' Business Daily's ""Stock of the Day,"" saying that China is a ""massive opportunity"" for years to come. Thta's not news, but it's nice to see it recognized by IBD."
Went to Costco today. Took me 10 minutes just to find a parking spot. Long Costco
How much Costco merchandise comes from China?
"In Alaska, looking at the full shopping carts and long lines, you would think everyday was Armageddon."
I am long Costco but if target beat this should also beat does not sound good logical to me?
"In doing DD for earnings Costco is unique in that they release their sales numbers monthly leading up to the 10k. Before I bought my Oct 2 call, I wanted to be sure the SP wasn't baked heading into earnings. June 30- 300 to 325. July 30-- 325 to 350. So....Wall St. guys can clown my retail investor technical analysis but after looking at their August numbers I see bar napkin math pointing me to a clean run to $375 this week. I wouldn't be surprised if it tested 400 at the peak of excitement before settling in around $380ish"
Will COST go up from here?
Costco has crushed the expectations qtr after qtr for the last decade. Anyone who doubts them is not too bright. Every single time I go to Costco they have 15 check out stands with a line of 4-6 full carts at all times....
"Evrytim I go to Costco, it s crowded, waiting for long time to check out;"
Nice spike!!
This stock only one worth 100$ max.
Dollar general smashed earnings today and the stock took a beating. CSCO disappointed earnings so that means it will go up?
COST is up 4.92% to 302.86
Costco now requires customers to wear masks. This is un-American. Sounds like communism.
ughhh....can't sleep. worried about my calls tomorrow. gonna go down to 4th street to see if I can score me some crystal meth
"wow, half the board says 150 half say over 200... im gonna go with down on open and up a little later."
Dropping like a sack of potatoes.250 tomorrow.Bankruptcy by 2021.
Heading into close like
Costco will never see one hundreds again after earnings
"I don’t know why this is down. I am on vacation in Hawaii. People are doomsday shopping at Costco. So many people, wicked long lines with $1,000 cart full of food and water. It’s insane out here the fear! Panic shopping galore. Next quarter should be amazing"
300++++ coming................................
hopefully she won't do a Kroger on us!
I will hold. It's a great time to buy more.
quick gotta leave china they're gonna steal costco's intellectual property!
think we will see 300??
another day for this pos stock. going under 160
don't just buy into this for the dividend.. thats a wash... but into this for a keeper..November sales release coming up on Wednesday...Christmas sales coming up..this will be over $400 in no time...
BLAST OFFnext stop 432.00
"Market is rising, lots of green. DOW up, Jobs report ok. 4 analyst upgrades. Stock is recovering from ER. 295 today"
"Don't worry, Costco will raise the membership to $100 for basic & $200 for Executive to make it up, then the next quarter will be even worse."
this is proof costco needs to split its getting too expensive
"BERNSTEIN IS WRONG!Broad, generic comments like membership exhaustion ...is nothing more than one person’s opinion—unfortunately one who buys ink by the barrel. And Amazon’s impact is old news, not new, and we have observed the impact on all retail. If you’ve seen a Costco parking lot in the last 3,6,9,12or 24 months in any neighborhood—you’ve noticed that its always heavily filled with cars, even in stores where they’ve enlarged the parking areas. And if you’ve watched their membership, store sales and e-commerce numbers in the past 3,6,9,12 and 24 months—you’ve noticed that they’re doing a good job in each category. And if you’ve shopped inside a Costco anytime recently or had to return anything for any reason, you’ve seen what a positive experience it has been. Oh, and I should mention that opening stores in mainland China, where value and hands-on experience by customers are integral, should be promising. So, based on all of that, if one wants to argue that it will be slower going in the months and year ahead, it would be appropriate and responsible to provide quality research to support the views. Any wonder why money managers are losing business?"
be been long and strong on COST since 2005 and seen lots of ups and downs. Their cash flow future has never been brighter I can say with 100% assurance...just check out their stores. Great to remain long.
Hate to say it but I told you cost could not be the exception to bad earnings like amzn and wmt. Eventually it will go back up but I am still not touching this untill 299.
"Where are all those people shouting for hours, days, weeks, months that Costco would go to 330-350? Damn internet brokers."
"Costco earnings were great despite COVID last quarter.If no bad economic news comes out, It should pop above 300 by the end of today!!"
COST is one of the weatherproof stock (pandemic or no pandemic) and it will reflect in its earnings
"Missed to take profit this morning or yesterday, now back to waiting... hope it will bounce instead of going to 150"
There is some vicious shorting going on today!
Target stock drops pulling down Walmart and Costco
Cup and handle chart formation very bullish
Is Costco under-priced or is Amazon over-priced? Why is Costco just 10% of Amazon's value? I'm thinking it should be 25% of it at least???
About time this junk stock drops.
Well all the stop loss shares have been purchased and now the buying begins.
BUY ALL these silly dips..........................................
"In January, COST new membership numbers are increased by 800％ in China!This business model works the best now and next 5 years!what a cash cow machinery!"
Yup. Red.
Good pull back today for institution to jump back in this still has upward momentum tomorrow will see it back up to 160 level don't miss out on this dip
Crazy overvalued with 36 PE with extremely low growth and low profit margin @ 2.5%. Fair value $250 at max.
Wow....this market is crazy! Wish I could’ve bought a boatload when market was 300+ down :(
$4B is not good enough for some people ..... COSTCO is making money... hello ..... there
Missed my chance to load up when I saw it dip to $189. MMs hard to please nowadays. Good luck tomorrow.
COST is better than AMZN and should be trading at $1000
I going to take a flyer here- I'll bet a cookie that it goes to even by market open in the morning and green tomorrow...come on-who wants to bet a cookie
"Buying on weakness...........................Great entry here, targets are all in to 170+++++"
this is a crazy reaction to this great compny. Their business will continue as always. This is an opportunity to buy a great company at a very low price. A great buying opportunity. Those who buy will reap the benefits as soon as this whole thing blows over.
"lets see at 155 area i will hold for a year collect $2.00 in dividend and sell cost at 178 a share,,,who cares about the sellers today,,,this is my long term play"
What kind of market let's a consumer retail company sport a pe of 30?? Its insane. This one should not be above 15pe
I walked into my local Costco over the weekend here in NYC. I couldn't believe the amount of people in the store... It's the reason I bought some stock.
Short this thing big! Amzn will eventually keep this stock at bottom fishing levels for a very long time if not forever unless costo joins another giant to compete.
"l think cost raise it's things price to boost it's sales growth , excluding it's things price raise, it's sales maybe decline, cost profit margin too low and Amazon too strong, plus retail price looks decline in April, so I think cost maybe down to $86 per share,"
The best company in the world. All other businesses have a lot to learn from them.
"not bad earnings but I would not buy at this price, pe of 25 seems great -> 260$"
This stock almost always sells off after earnings.
The reason it’s dropping is because people are seeing their 401k in the gutter and they’re selling for whatever they can so they don’t lose everything they have. Traders are manipulating this market.. recession on the horizon
can AMZN be a threat to Costco?
I think that 4B offering is showing up
"Hey everyone,Costco stock was doing so well. Why did it dip so much this past week ?"
Market is guessing the Biden effect. Hope not. If your for Biden.... SELL now. Take any profits and RUN...... fast
COST has been flirting with the 50 dma (305) for some time now. Seems like every time it tries to breakout some idiot analyst will issue a downgrade to push it back under.
Took short positions with closing eyes
BURN shorts BURN......................................no competition to COST says CEO.
"What is the percentage of Costco members that has Executive membership?Since we know Costco makes money on collecting membership fees and it has two type of memberships. The regular Gold Star cost $60.00, the Executive cost $120.00. The Executive membership fee is twice the Gold membership fee. There are reports of how many Costco memberships and the fee is always listed as $60.00. However, this could be underestimating the fees collected. I searched and could not find the percentages of Executive membership against the Gold Star membership. I have the Executive membership. Just for curiosity's sake, I would like to do a survey on this board. If you are a Costco member, which type of membership do you have?"
Trump's will sanction China where Costco gets 90 percent of its goods that non-food. Bad news for them.
Waiting for short sellers to take it lower so I can add more with Special divi.
"got 300 shares today, beautiful"
"Nice rebound by Cost and a big handful of retail stocks, go figure, so many went down and nothing has changed with tariffs but stocks are rebounding."
Just put Tom the clown on mute!1 on every MB
today we begin the decent....MM gunna bring this down before earnings
back to $300....geezus
How many of you simpletons took the bait dangled by the so called analysts who work on behalf of the short sellers and manipulators on Wall St.? Hopefully not to many. Much of today's churn was just the idiots churning the stock back and forth to each other. Better day tomorrow. Even better by the end of the week.
Special dividend s historically run in the $5-$7 range
There is NO WAY Costco is going to declare a Special Dividend of $18.50/shr.!! NO WAY. Analysts were merely stating that the company has (at its disposal) $18.50/shr. in 'cash on hand'. I suspect any Special Dividend this time 'round will be in-line w/ the previous $5 - $7/shr. range.
Where are the chumpies who predicted $325 today?
THANKS FOR 294.25
keep on running
"If Costco had 1/2 of the Amazon p/E, what would the stock price be?"
there is no special dividend. get over it
Dead Cat bounce..............................
Pictures will go viral again this week
Huge news for CostCo to beat the numbers of cars they sold compares to any other quarter. Analysts have a buy rating at $191 with the targe price of $209.
Look for moreQ E next
Did Costco just put out a special dividend
"$320s post earnings ... COST, WMT, AMZN, and TGT control the retail market and horde the last stimulus. The next stimulus will catapult COST to $350. Bank on it."
"Where else can you buy a $400,000 diamond ring online!"
Special dividend coming? Its been a while where are the tax windfall utilized?
This VIRUS soon to be HISTORY.....................................................take ADVANTAGE OF FIRE SALE HERE............................................... people tend to PANIC...........................concentrated on only virus .......
Why Costco is the ultimate coronavirus pandemic stock to ownhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/costco-is-the-ultimate-moneymaking-coronavirus-pandemic-stock-to-own-162204689.html
"PE Ratio (TTM) 32.76, enough said. Over valued, covids over in 2 months (inflation), many other places to shop. China stores will be future growth story."
"COST is overbought and will experience a short-term dip. Hop over to NLST for the weekend. It's about to pop, BIGLY."
i think 320 is a ddcent support for Costco
Earnings beat 2.55 vs. 2.44Plus rev. Also beat by 1 Bil.
bought more to keep one year
They report every month basically so not a surprise
Still over $300 a share!!
so cheap
VXX 50 DAYS MA ABOUT GO BELOW 200 DAYS MA STOCKS ARE GOING HIGHER LOOKS LIKE TUESDAY. COST GOES OVER 253 ITS OVER ITS GOING HIGHER
futures up again after the fed pumped more money into the economy..costco down..pure msnipulstion
this should be way up..people nervous
dont forget the Kirkland brand is highly regarded. there is a lot of brand loyalty there and so far no other company has been able to match it.
PE is too low. It should be at least 75.
"THIS STOCK PRESENTLY HAS A P.E. OVER 33. MANY SEE IT AS HAS TO FALL FURTHER DOWN BELOW 30, WHICH WOULD MEAN ANOTHER 30 POINTS SHED. AVERAGE PE IS APPROX 18.STILL THINK ITS A GREAT BUY AND GOING TO 400 ?"
SELLING and Virus news areOVERDONE !
to 250 when earnings are announced that don't meet the lofty expectations
Lets go Costco
Costco just breached the 200-day moving average with lower high and lower lows.
"Hey, where's my little Mommy-moochin', sailor-suited sissy? You know the one I mean, the one that claimed to have shorted COST at $113 but won't acknowledge it, talk about it, or man up. Oh well, I guess you have to be a man to man up."
Material week ness. Will go close to $200
"Look for the SILLY dips as buy opportunities , Institutions are loading here, 400+ soon."
"Trump’s big mouth, no task force, took 200+ points off the Dow. Bloated moron"
"Hands down - the best-run company in America. If your perspective is short-term, invest in the GME's and Zoom's of the world. If your perspective is that you want a stock to help send your kids and grandkids to college, invest in COST."
costco isn't oversold none of that crab..its being shorted.
Going green soon
COST has NO bearing on TRADE WAR........................................
Please go down to $100
Stock should be priced around 250
fake news
"11:53 AM EST, 02/19/2020 (MT Newswires) -- Costco Wholesale(COST) was reportedly planning to open its second store in China after opening its first store in Shanghai last August, Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday, citing the retail giant's confirmation."
"I don't understand the fuss about Costco employees getting a better pay/salary. Costco employees normally buys their own company's stocks via their 401k plan selections so with their higher salary means they will also participate in purchasing their company stocks. Maybe not much to create a huge dent but surely Costco is not going to bankrupt. The end of last year they gave a generous $10 dividend/share. The employees' wage increase should not scare the weak hands to start doing selling-off chaos supporting the short-sellers. Selling your long position shares only means you're taking the realized loss, it is a done deal, damage done. But if we all hold your shares, then it's only a temporary unrealized loss, be patient. Do not sell when the price is too low. Costco stores are always busy, it means their business is doing good. Even during the pandemic lock-down, they are doing just fine. For a long term, this is a solid company to keep in our portfolio. Big institutions also hold COST shares."
this makes no sense to me..last quarter excellent numbers stock tanks...today excellent numbers stock tanks...unreal
"When the smoke clears, you've got one of the best run companies on the planet, a record year despite a worldwide pandemic, a business model that has proven itself year after year, reliable dividend payouts, very low debt and boat loads of CASH in the bank. Let me say it again, BOAT LOADS OF CASH. Aside from the idiot hairball and a couple others, most people with half a brain will do VERY well here if you just stay with the program. If you're that upset, sell it and move on. Just don't look at the price in 6 months or a year because you'll throw up a hairball from the money you lost. Relax....."
Debt to Tangible Worth of 2:1. Solid cash position All customers love Costco. Always busy with large dollar checkouts. Bought a logistics company last year. Online sales improving. Buymore with next downtick?
"I only come to this conversation group for entertainment as most of the people that post here have absolutely no idea what they are doing or saying and just come here to cry. Yes, the COST stock has been declining for over three months now, but I have been there with many other good quality stocks and they all have rebounded sooner or later. And so will COST. It’s just a matter of time. IMO, this is a great opportunity to make a 20% upside before the year end here. If you are not patient enough, or want bigger or quicker gains, then this stock is not for you. Cheers to all longs!"
"They never paid much of a div, and if it was higher then the stock would not have dropped so hard i'm guessing."
I was following pre market..and thought things might be good...but that fell through
WOW...
Day Traders giving you a BARGAIN here.
Costco is too expensive and customers have to pay for stupid membership. It takes time for Costco and Kirkland to follow Sears and K-Mart. Zombie stocks. Time to move to Amazon and online retailers.
Expect a large large jump up next week. Earnings are done and now all the is over. There is no need for this heading down. Would not shock me is we see a $10...$15 or even $20 up day!! Everything is factored in....whatever it was that drove this down. Even Buffett news!
"cover your short position, this stock will run up bigly towards earnings release. Costco parking lots are crowded and many happy customers."
"Sure please do buy on the 30th or now, In theory, a company's stock price will automatically fall by the special dividend amount on the ex-dividend date because the company's distribution of this cash represents a decrease in the value of the company. You also will sell at a $10 per share loss unless you get smart and hold onto this fast growing stock."
"I am a Costco Customer first before a Costco Investor. Costco’s business model is sound and successful. If there is anything I need, I would probably check to see if Costco carries that. Most if not all the time, I found the price is better than most retailers and beats even Amazon. I consider myself as a long-term investor so daily fluctuation of the stock prices does not bother me. Since we cannot predict the futures we tend to study the past. Personally, I really do not trust the projected numbers that much. However, the direction or the momentum of the stock are more easily projected with some confidence. Let’s look at some of the numbers. Costco closed at $376.78 today and gained $85.29 for the year. That is a 29.26% gain. Costco gained $ 221.96 in 5 years, which works out to be a 28.67% per year. This yearly gain seems to be quite consistent. Costco has been distributing special dividends every few years and this year everyone is happy to get a $10.00 special dividend. The distribution of special dividend shows that the Company is financially sound and have excess cash that it could be paid out to the shareholders. The Beta (5Y Monthly) is 0.67. Which means that the stock is quite stable. This is not really a trading stock. There are lots of other stocks that fluctuate more, much more. If you include the dividends and the special dividends, Costco stock is gaining about 30% yearly. So, if 30% sounds good, Costco stock is a safe investment. Like so many folks have been saying about Costco. Buy on Dips is a good advice on Costco. Lastly, I wish everyone a Happy New Year and let’s all have a great 2021!"
"Good reasons to drop expensive COSTCO membership and never look back. As a member of Amazon Prime, you get a convenient and well-publicized perk: free two-day shipping on almost any item on Amazon.

In fact, signing up for Prime unlocks features like Amazon's vast digital library of music, movies, television, and books; one-hour restaurant delivery; and unlimited cloud storage for your photos.

"THINK POSITIVE... HANG IN THERE... ITS ONLY DOWN 80 POINTS IN 11 WEEKS. DON'T BE A MUSH... AS SOMEONE SAID EARLIER... BLAME ON CORONA... DON'T BLAME IT ON HIGHER WAGE EXPENSES. IF CEO DOESN'T INCREASE HOURLY WAGES THEY WOULD HAVE BEATEN EARNINGS ESTIMATES. BUT NOT TO WORRY, HOLD THIS STOCK FOR 5 YEARS, IT'LL HIT 340 AGAIN. ostco beat expectations on revenues. They missed expectations on earnings due to unusual increased pandemic costs, but still had better earnings than the year prior. This is a positive earnings report!"
"Hey Bernie, what happened ￼today too your sub 300 number ￼￼buddy boy?? The world didn’t come to an end and the stock stayed strong.even though the markets as a whole were lousy. You really got to lighten up￼"
"Costco is almost always packed full of people. It's hard to see it going down anytime soon. Great buying opportunity. Buy on fear, sell on greed."
any idea of next dividend pay date
Costco just dropped a vendor for an honest representation of Black Lives Matter (look at their web site) Thought Costco would at least not attack a supplier for an honest and heartfelt Facebook comment. SHAME on you Costco!
Big news .. cost turned green .. lol
"Wow $GRF Greenrise Foods greenhouse stock owns 70 acres of greenhouses in Leamington, ties with Sunset Brand who sells produce to $COST. $GRF actually owns and operates 30 acres of Sunset greenhouses (grows, sells to them and they sell to Costco)"

"You can get anything at Costcos. I needed a car battery yesterday. Did not think about it twice. Went to Costco and saved over 50 dollars compared to Advance Auto parts. The same with luxury watches , TVs etc. It was Wednesday and the store was packed."
All that government stimulus money is going to Costco.
TRUMP cant BLAME POWELL now for market meltdown......................................
Look like COST will hit new high tomorrow.
"These type of crisis like the 2000 internet crash, 9-11 and the 2008 financial crash usually takes the general market down 50% or more so we still have a way to go."

Costco sitting on the sidelines as the stock market rages

Costco still selling intel computers just shows how behind the times they are!!!
"Thanks for adding more @ 288.0""s300.00 ++++ soon"
AMAZ should start paying 2% cash back to prime member for WFM purchases like Costco does!
You should be careful walking on slippery surface. I believe Costco will trade further south.
Costco has dropped $60 since January 1. This 15% falloff puts us into correction territory folks.
Costco had a $420 price target in the past. I stil believe we will hit and pass $420 by early summer
All registers open and ringing at Costco.
There is no reason why this is down today. But the market is kind of flat today. Hopefully it will catch up a bit more later. It doesn’t make any sense to drop yo $338 today.
If you didn’t buy today you are a dummy
COST may not go up as much when the market is up. But it also doesn't go down as much when the market tanks. Stable and solid
"Today, Dec 26, 2019, you can find this message in the Costco offer page ""NEW OFFERS BEGIN 9/4/19"", LOL! good luck for long!"
I'm in for ER since this was Christmas quarter and very very busy. And also retail looks strong in 2019 and bonus is Target did well. Zacks predicts a nice beat. So yea I think 230.00 After ER.
Does Costco get any of it’s merchandise from China. If so what %. Anybody know?
just went to whole foods and prices r still out of control. Costco has nothing to worry bout.
boom.. up it goes
Mark this post. $10.50 special divi will be announced
Ready for takeoff ?????
Heart is sinking deep. Got in at $367  anyone too?
I bought a grip of Costco stock last week and immediately lost money. Bad purchase.
Now that the Amazon killing Costco nonsense is history this stock will soon claw back to 180
finally in the green after buying at 315 in March. it has been painfully frustrating to hold this far. what's the outlook from here on out? thinking it will dip to the 310 range again
GREAT Growth here.positive for investors.
EARNINGS REFLECT PLEASE!!!!
Earnings are out
Saw a guy freak and I mean freak out today because they now require membership cards to use the food court. He was LIVID. Go Costco.
"i am getting in again here 163,78"
any second now.. it wants to go green i know it
"COSTCO'S going to smoke tomorrow.101% up e-commerce besides all other great numbers!!!Costco’s (COST) net sales for the month of August rose 15% to $13.56 billion.Total comparable sales (excluding the impacts from change in gasoline prices and foreign exchange) increased 14.5%, beating analyst expectations.US comparable sales grew 14.3% compared to the same month last year.A standout was e-commerce sales, which grew 101.6% in August compared to the same month last year."
good company. but not worth buying the stock 33 times earnings.
Yup. Once again....correct!! $8 up yesterday and today up over $3 so far. $11 up in 2 trading day lol. We'll be over $350 a lot sooner than you know.
Back to 180 by next week 
Costco is a buy next move $165
Any events coming up?
Okay earnings; they expected more apparently
cost nov sales up 6 percent ....below 293 is good price to buy
"Cowen rates Costco shares outperform and, in a rare move these days, raised its price target to $360 from $350."
wheres that special dividend
Costco is on fire. 200 when Nov. sales are posted.
Glad I sold a little ahead of the release but still sitting on 400 shares! They were priced for perfection unfortunately!
quite possibly the best company on the planet..but the worst stock on the pkanet
"Long term investors , take advantage of the fire sale here , as it is way overdone at these levels.COST will rebound and come back hard as usual.MARK MY WORDS here."
COST is the most inflated stock on the Nasdaq. FORE!!!
"I am looking at the charts (peaks and valleys) and we had the last downside point when Amazon announced they were taking over Whole Foods. At this time, that merger has done little to threaten Costco's business as one can see the rapid rise in cost's share price following that news. I see Costco fully recovered and on track to report stellar sales in this busy retail season. I am predicting that Cost will hit $200 after Thursday's closing session. jmho"
this stock is stuck . great earnings. why doesn't it go up?
If you are short this stock let me ask an obvious question - Why?
How much is everyone down ?
"I am a business Costco member over 30 years. I just don't understand why a wholesale club has a limited buying items? It is a wholesale, not a retailer. Limited 2 per customers!!?? It is a joke! And they really needs to improve employees' attitude, we are customers, please be polite. I pay over $100 membership a year and spend a lot of money every year in the club."
"You know you need a new CEO when you miss earnings by 20%! No excuses...you screwed up and need to be replaced ASAP! The S&P gained 25% in a year and this is down for the past year! Total embarrassment to the management, you can talk about giving your employee more...what about your shareholders? You gave us a lousy $10 dividend but took $70 of the stock price so go suck it"
This was at $297 earlier what a joke.
"MM""s want below344.00look for the dips as a buy .........................................."
I'm stunned this is the price action after a great earnings report...hate to see what would have happend on a bad earnings report
one step up...and two steps back
"with $2 div only, you will get back after 25 yrs"
"Look for ""on line"" sales to SURGE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
You guys all know it's gonna tank no matter what even after a huge beat.... Don't you see the pattern?
Every Costco is jammed. Wells Fargo is the most corrupt major bank. Stick it out
"Visit your local Costco to decide for yourself if Costco is making money. Packed store this past Friday morning before noon in Orlando area. Unbelievable! People love Costco. Not sure if any of you see that in your area but ours is always busy with filled carts, including mine."
$15-20 haircut coming today
Bought all the adult diapers I could find today at Costco !!!
Or 150
I sat on the fence for 3 weeks about joining (http://tradingstrategys.com) for their weekly picks. Big mistake. COST exploded and I completely missed out. Don’t make the same mistake I made. Join them today.
Drop baby drop.
Cost packs everyday. it will fool around at 165-167 another week before earnings report. The earnings number is great which I have no doubt. The only thing is the market looks like they want to turn down a bit before it goes higher.
340.00 soon..................................
I don't know about everyone else but I won't renew my membership if it increases! Look at the customers at Costco. Many are low income looking for a better deal. Sell Sell Sell
Good earnings after market
One of those orange jacket cart pushing uneducated goons hit my car with shopping carts the other day. Why do they employ such uneducated goons?
"Every Costco Employee: Hey boss, I make like $12 an hour. That's around like $480 before taxes.Costco Employee: But my buddy accross the street is making like $400-600 from the CARES ACT + UI 50% of his wages a week...Can you fire me so I can stop stocking shelves, go to college, and focus on bettering my mental and physical health?Costco CEO: lol no, get rekt skrub, get back to work swine!"
"COST is showing some weaknesses here, probably buyers are waiting to see how far it will drop before start to accumulate again. It seems that day traders reduced their activities too since the volume is very thin. This is a cycle that COST goes thru and next leg up will be strong which will push it up to $162 areas."
330.00 next stop
"The overselling is a BUY opportunity !Costco does not need to even think about whole foods. Costco just needs to be Costco. Their business model works, June's earnings were fine, July's should be fine. The stock may have risen a bit too fast with the giddiness of the $7.00 special dividend payout."
"Great volume, closed up nicely. Bottom is IN!!! Should be a nice Gap up next week."
Just bought some for the first time. Looks like a good time to add with the pullback.
for those who don't think this is a big issue. how many share do you have? its a big paper loss for me today
time to turn .. rocket boosters.. those selling are making a mistake.. hold or buy more.
CostCo shares jump 2.7% after strong November sales numbersBUY and HOLD easy 200 plus....................
All this fund mgrs are trying to push down COST for their quarterly investment gain. IMO
Why the bump today ? News?
Friday sell off..never fails
Well Tuesday was quite a show of strength. wiping out the losses of Monday you can see where the sellers started in the morning and then large buy volumes stepping in. A few more sellers around noon and then the selling was over. Monday was an aberration. A blip.this thing will be over 160 by the end of this week.LD
Safe haven in the covid era. Costco is taking care of business.
More people will go to Costco this weekend for emergency supplies.
Option market is showing this has more downside to it. But will add more shares if it tanks more..Costco is a good company ..
deal 1 done ...phase 2 immediate ....do not sell cost will rise to 330 plus
needs to become local AMZN drop points
COST reached a new All Time High at 197.31
"If they are not doing good, they wont pay $16 min wage. It will fly to $400 tomorrow."
"So a 4 to 1 split would give you 4 times your shares at a lower value thus allowing smaller investors to get in, thus increasing your value -and over and over. Take a look at microsoft in the past for an example."
BUYER260.00
Thank you again for theSILLY DIPS........................................new highs soon !
next stop330.00+
The worst the Virus news getsThe BETTER COST will do.............. Ever mind the noise justBuy on weakness here people.........Be glad you did in 6 months from now.
"Costco is great!! the only issue is that its way too expensive for me, Augmented Reality is the future and IPNFF is a Gem, it'll keep popping and end up like NEXCF because they're the only two companies in the market that sell AR as a product, GLTA know what you own."
12 Years holding and buying the silly DIPS.
Costco hot dog at 10am?
We predicted this huge move. Strong Buy. https://cweb.com/costco-is-back-and-possible-dividend-ahead-cweb-com/
Looking for the SILLY DIPS305.00-310.00
Buy or regret
my opinion why Costco took on a tremendous amt of more debt to issue special dividend dividend of $7 was to discourage someone like walmart not to submitatakeover bid of the great company that Costco is
Going red... imagine that
Why is that when Kevin is wrong (which is most of the time) he runs away and hides? He's losing money BUT he will show-up soon and tell everyone that he's made a fortune!
@Cost any special dividend for COST in 2020 ?
Save some $$$$$$$to buy the SILLY DIPS............
Fantastic numbers. Let’s see what those membership numbers are at 2. $400+ happening sooner rather than later.
"I bought a giant bag of colored carrots. they were already rotten by first day at home. Costco has GOT to get a handle on their rotting produce problem, imo!!!"
I'd rather they'd miss on eps than on the revenues number! Any word on 2Q guidance?
Huge buying opportunity!!!
if it wasn't for Xi the US would be wrecked. Xi 2020 MAGA
Scooped a few shares today
you and me both bro!!
Thanks for the301.00 buy order
Page is filled with shorts
"Not as bad as the recent stock price drop had feared. Stock price will bounce back, as usual :)."
Its time to buy this stock...
"$310 - $312 would make Cost 20% off it's highs. 20% would be considered a bear market. In terms of a "" bear "" term....Costco is far far from being in bear scenario. I've said it before. Highly doubt Cost will dip 20% or more. Doubt it evens reaches $310. It's close to bottom and the sling shot up will be Swift."
SLOW dying Death of the short sellers as we grind higher from here.
until the matter with short sellers is dealt with this will go nowhere
This is for all you Robin Hood wanna be daytraders. You’re just gambling when you buy on earnings day. You’re not an investor. So sell your shares and come back in 3 months to play again when it’s at $400. Clowns
"Finally trading at 300, where it should be. Fundamentals have not changed post virus. Also looking forward to later this week when they announce March sales. The lines were crazy worldwide."
Ok ill be positive but when you have calls in play red isn’t good but hey I’ll join the positive bandwagon and go buy a Corvette tonight from all my profits that come rolling in tommorow I’m all in with you
Costco Earnings tomorrow. Easy +$20/share
"The timing is the issue here... even if they beat earnings, the market looks to be smack dab in the middle of a correction. Even if this goes up AH, next week is going to be bloody as hell... Any jump in share price should be sold immediately tomorrow morning."
TARGETS 380.00-410.00
"Let's hope that next week continues the rally back to all time highs. This stock has been an absolute dog, after the Amazon/Whole Foods merger. Hoping for the best for my June 2018 $168 strike calls, which are finally in the green again, up 11%"
its incontrovertible....2020 election for POTUS was STOLEN.
$360 is that a buy? or more like $350? Thoughts?
"pure manipulation here..down $4 @ open, up $3...down $4....rigged"
"We also see fundamental risks to the pace of COST’s US and international growth due to membership exhaustion, US saturation and international delays. In the US we see (1) new competitive pressure as they near peak club counts, members per club, and revenue per member, (2) a possible downturn catalyst big enough to cause members to reevaluate spend and membership fees, and (3) potentially more aggressive competitor offerings in Convenience or Service that draw away members in new ways."
the stimulus will only boost the market for 1 day....what do we have for Wednesday to boost it?
A little too pricey here
"All this Shorts are in trouble, crying..Current Short Volume ------------------- 4,330,000 sharesPrevious Short Volume ------------------ 3,630,000 sharesChange Vs. Previous Month: ----------- +19.28%Dollar Volume Sold Short --------------- $1.43 billionShort Interest Ratio / Days to Cover - 1.8"
$315 by year end.
"Has Costco been buying back stock like everyone else? If not, should they have?"
would love to pick up some cost at around 240-250 a share.
Tomorrow we will know more. Might be able to pick up more shares for this great company at cheaper prices. Hoping for at least a 5% drop. It’s a win either way. I will buy on the dip or pop
COSTCO TANKS AFTER EVERY EARNINGS WITHOUT FAIL! LOOK IT UP
what a gift.. I'm in for 25k
this should be up...it was up $3 earlier
When the markets down 1000 points this kind of reaction will happen. Its good. You can buy in cheaper with reassurance the company is doing ok
If you’re ever worried about your Costco stock visit a Costco.
"I'm officially a Costco shareholder. Should have bought the pullback closer to $300, but got greedy thinking it might dip into the $200's. I love the store experience, products, and value it offers. There is no store better. This will be a long term hold."
About to breakout
"Falls hard on conf. call,"
"So rumor saids, they may pay special dividend in 2019??.Go longs"
I'm glad that everyone is off the $400 kick...never gunna see that
Keep selling so I can keep buying more at a discount please 
Why COSTCo went down in the first place defies logic. The markets are not perfect. Can't even get into the parking lot in Boca Raton. Can only mean an increase in sales. Market duhhhh. Stock should be back at 325 + yesterday
What is going on to cause this? We’re at $333/share right now.
"If you are not BOYCOTTING AMAZON, YOU DESERVE TO LOSE MONEY ON COSTCO, BECAUSE YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM."

"Next week Costco would cross 295.And when the quarterly numbers come out., it will be 330 plus."
"@ Ben, totally agree, last time at Costco spent $300 - just the average these days"
Extremely undervalued. Be prepared for a squeeze up this week.

"Stupid People. continually post about having their fingers in their bums and make references to mano-a-mano activities. Kind of what Grimbelina does on a daily basis. Better erase it, ya l'il sissy, I know it made you pout."

Targets maintained 342.00-348.00
"When's management gonna address the ""T"" word?"
310.00-314.00 today
Last year I bought HD at 138 and it started going down though they did very well in sales number due to speculation..I cut the loss at 118 even though I knew it's good stock to hold.. seeing red every day created so much stress... On next day it bounced back and it is up and up every day and it crossed 138 very quickly... but loss is lossI see similar pattern here and believe it will bounce back soon but you never know
I knew it would drop with good earnings because the market is a SHAM.
Sales impressive!
"Costco, it’s time for your special dividend. You’ve been making $$$ hand over fist during this pandemic; it’s been 3 ys since your last special dividend; ppl are either going to reinvest the dividend in your stock or spend it at your warehouse. Either way, win-win for you. I’ll accept $10/sh. TIA."

when is good time to invest in Costco
"Trump won't be badgering Costco. Costco is selling American and other products TO the Chinese collecting Yuan and repatriating that into U.S. dollars, thus lowering the trade deficit. Trump is focusing on manufacturers in China, as they sell products and components TO the U.S. which increases our trade deficit with China, as we pay U.S. dollars for those products and components that are converted into Yuan. U.S. retail stores selling in China is a plus not a minus to the U.S., so Costco and Walmart etc are not in the crosshairs of Trump, although these retailers may be in the crosshairs of Pres. Xi. Trump is trying to get China to lower Chinese tariffs on the various items Costco, GM, etc. are selling in China so their saies will rise as lower Chinese tariffs will make the products cheaper to Chinese buyers. Past efforts and tactics over decades have failed to attain results, so Trump is changing tactics through the use of tariffs. You may disagree with this tactic, so what is your suggestion given past failures to even the tech transfers and trade deficit?"
"I believe the storm is now over and this upcoming week for Cost stock will surge up. Potentially, very high up!"
if you trend earnings and reaction to earnings per quarter for COST Q3 is by far the best performing quarter since the beginning of time.
CNBC says Costco comp sales are lower than expected. Probably due to people already stocked up.
staff in costco are best
Selling is accelerating into the close .Goes out below 190.
have faith in $COST.. I have gut feeling it will do wonder as it is still growing..
the communist mask will cause memberships to drop
We will be Greeeeeeen

"Latest update !CostcoFor RBC Capital’s Scot Ciccarelli, Costco is a top pick in the retail space. On December 14, he maintained a Buy rating as well as a $439 price target (20% upside potential).According to Ciccarelli, “Costco just keeps doing it what it does best,” which is delivering strong sales growth and good margin performance. In its most recent quarter, the company posted comp growth of 17.1%, enabling it to generate strong leverage in fiscal Q1 2021, in the analyst’s opinion. E-commerce sales surged 86% and now account for roughly 7% of total sales.Even though U.S. comps moderated, Ciccarelli argues “this modest deceleration seemed to be driven by pull forward activity and… more aggressive Black Friday promotions starting as early as late-October from some competitors.” On top of this, gross margins reached 13.3% thanks to efficiency gains, labor productivity and significantly lower product spoilage in fresh foods.What’s more, Ciccarelli points out that Costco has the strongest buying power in the retail space because it concentrates all of its scale on a small group of SKUs, while its bigger competitors spread their buying power across millions of SKUs. Additionally, he thinks it has the lowest markup in the industry.“We believe this combination creates extremely compelling value for their members. As a result, while Costco has indeed benefitted from accelerated shopping activity as more consumer dollars are directed towards goods rather than services/experiences (what we call the Retail Lift), we believe Costco is extremely well positioned regardless of broader economic trends in 2021,” Ciccarelli opined."
in these markets COST GD ABBV GILD MDT to name a few
Long term you can't go wrong with Costco. They're building more stores every year while others are closing and/or downsizing.
COST: 305 this week
"Amazon gives a new location for returned and people go crazy happy! What you as an investor should know is amazon doesn't tell you how many billions are returned a year. , obviously it's not a good thing for any company to have returned . . Some investors are playing with emotions and not logic."
going under 200.00 by earnings date...............................selllllllllllllllllllllllbuy back later............................
watch...stock market rages today...costco loses again
TTM PE Ratio is currently at 35.26. FORE!!!
"Costco can hike Membership fee as high as they want, I am NOT buying or coming in to shop there.There is plenty of retailers that don't charge membership fee like Walmart, Target, etc...let the stupid people that have excess money waste them on unnecessary fees and hand them over to Costco. I worked hard for my money and I watched where I spent them"
Makes no sense...
Americans are STUPID. No wonder most of them live paycheck to paycheck and not watching where they spent money on useless annual membership fees.
It’s official I love costco. I don’t own the stock yet but just got a membership so I’m officially a member
"This says everything about COST. Management continues to maintain a ""steadfast commitment to value and integrity"" in everything it does, from selling goods at the lowest possible price to how it treats customers and, most importantly, how the company treats its employees."

How many other people cannot sell before January 4 without putting themselves into a higher tax bracket? But wait too long and the new administration may put you in a higher bracket anyway.

"I would hope costco would split this, bring some life to this dying stock"
"Today's drop is an over-reaction to the perception of shrinking margins due to Amazon and the thought that they are taking over the world. I shop in Costco literally every weekend and can tell you that the store is packed beyond imagination. Shrinking margins or not, the volume of sales that Costco does in relation to a typical brick and mortar store is unheard of. Costco will continue to drive their business model forward with or without the fear of Amazon. I will continue to accumulate at these levels. Stock is selling at a discount and will hit $180 within 3 mos."
happily sold everything...should have sold long ago but I thought it would turn around..never did..I might go back to DE
where'd those people go that were waiting for under 200?

Costco will rebound and all the haters will go into hiding. Costco is not going anywhere. Costco will be around 100 years from now.
Load up on Costco and  can’t go wrong
Good post by R a few hours ago. Spot on information!

"My read on Costco, AH 360. Rest will depend on the idiot / stimulus hungry investors how they screw it in PM tomorrow.Sorry but fact is a fact... no heart feelings."
Anyone know why COST is appearing in Yahoo's trending tickers today?.. any news I am missing?
Earnings not good enoughThese hedge funds will pull everything out
My bet is if Costco membership and renewal doesn’t show a dramatic increase we will see this dropping after er the sales numbers has been baked into the price already it’s all about membership tomorrow I don’t see an increase of more than 2-3% if they beat expectation....the amazon affect is still very much lingering over Costco
"2 days ago when the stock was $270, I said that with one excellent monthly report this stock would paint $280."
If market is down tomorrow COST will be down mucho.
Net income grew 22%
why such a big drop today??
The shorts are too stupid to short Costco. It will be $400 stock soon
"Funny..... Some of these posts are ludicrous and I find myself chuckling.I mentioned earlier today that COST was most likely going to bounce off the 50. Came real close. In fact close enough. Each time its bounced off the 50 over the last few months, it has made new highs. Nothing has changed. COST check out lines are long. People are spending $hundreds each sale. Parking spot is ridiculous to find when I go there. Nothing has changed. In fact, more sales month over month and year over year with new stores opening every quarter. The narrative is still extraordinarily bullish. And not just because of pandemic. The outbreak only gave a tail wind to the business model. Thats why we received SP divvy. China hasn't even begun to be exploited as well as the rest of Asia. The U.S. Hasn't even reached 1/3 of projected stores!!! People people people. This stock is almost as sure as the sun coming up each day. Dip on the monthly numbers, dip on the quarterly numbers, new highs following with days to 2 weeks. Rinse and repeat.I personally bought options down here today. I will sleep just fine. Jan strike and 2022 strike. Yeah, I'll be just fine."
Cost stock has been least down compares to any other tech stock
One reason Buffett may have sold is that Costco pays a small dividend. Buffett likes companies with wide moats and good dividend payouts to build a horde of cash to buy his next company.
"I hate seeing amazon news on my Costco feed ,??"
Painted $270. You shorts going to fold. I know this. One excellent monthly report coming up and $280 in the bag. Could be soon too.
$350 within 3 months
Does anyone long COST have an exit strategy? If so what? I'm thinking there is a pull back coming with the tariff news. Plus their PE is higher than comps and I'm not seeing much expansion.
This stock usually trades down after earnings.
Where's that anonymous fool that's been posting on here about his 140 short position ....I think he went bk and lost all his money
Targets soon raised !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Walmart breaking out before earnings report tomo!!Costco Walmart target best to own during and after pandemic
CNBCsays COST is a BUY hereundervalued !
"lots of time, it is il-logic, but peer pressure and global geopolitical make the anxious people to sell. however, the long term, it is a great stock. not a short term buy or sell, but long term to have."
"I’m not knocking Costco, love them. But people are lined up to buy dry staples. Many of them are lost leaders, decent margins etc but it’s not like 60% of the other goods are flying."
"In the next two weeks, there will be some boneheads come to upgrade COST to buy."
Dead stock walking
Wall Street expects Costco’s adjusted EPS to grow 7.1% YoY to $1.82 in the quarter.
we need to break the top of that symmetrical wedge. another 2% ought to do it.
"Is this a let it run a little more, then sell ahead of earnings type play?"
Praying that it opens flat tomorrow so I can load up on puts to ride it to 270 by next Friday
Is this going to drop or go up after earnings?
Strong Buy Love this company. Bullish. https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/764789-cweb/5170832-competition-heating-costco-walmart-target-cweb-com
"ollowing the sales data, five-star analyst Rupesh Parikh at Oppenheimer ramped up the stock’s price target to $380 (12% upside potential) from $355 and maintained a Buy rating, saying that COST remains a top pick."
Why cant this stock hold 200?
"From past events, could be as long as 8 days for a shake out and also could be 5 days.....today is day 6"
Big miss I think
What’s causing today’s bump in Costco?
Maybe there was a lot of options @370 expiring today 
"with premarket rising, cost being down the last few days..maybe we are due for a break out...^$20?"
Costco > Dollar Tree... how the @#$& can you even compare the two.
How was guidance
Just OWN IT DONT RRADE IT.........................................
IM GOING MAKE PROFIT BY END OF DAY
1 month chart looks like it’s time to SELLLLLL
down to $300
"Here's the floor/strength resistance. $373. It pops up to $377 and is immediately put back in its place the next day. $373. Explodes to nearly $380 out of the gate today, systematically brought back to $373. The volume has not reignited yet. But, this weekend should be enough time for everyone to digest the news and the holiday season to become front and center with an official Vaccine approval. The rest of this month seems to be a continuation of this unprecedented climb. $400 EOY."
COST to distribute Vaccines in Canada soon.
"Reports April Sales Results for Costco Wholesale Corporation is out and it shows that Costco sales for April is down -4.7%. So, despite seeing lines of people waiting to get into Costco, Costco is not immune to the effects of COVID19. Sales is still down. What is interesting is why the sales were down. Without the numbers from Gasoline sales, the sales were only down -0.5%. When excluding Gasoline, Optical, Travel, Food Court, Hearing Aids, Photo, and foreign exchange, the sales went up by 8.6%. What surprised me is that Costco Gasoline contribute this much to this Costco Sales. Costco only started selling Gasoline about 4 or 5 years ago. As, the country opens back up, sales of other departments that were lagging should pick up. I think Costco did well in April. Should the general public view this as negative, maybe the stock would drip down. If stock goes down big, this would be a buying opportunity. I will be watching like a hawk tomorrow."
"Online sales soaring , memberships are up huge and sales are through the roof $$$Buy buy buy"
"Yes, we git special devedend reel soon! You know me cousen Manuel, he work for Costo in Mexico, He tel me all workers get no more raise caus Conpany will be sending special monnies to shareholders.

any news on the Mar 8th earnings
No comments yet about closing the photo department? No more passport photos? (Got mine there in 2018 so I'm good another 7 years if travel ever becomes advisable before then.) Guess I'll have to go online for any hardcopy prints I might want of digital photos I take. Costco had very quick turnaround when I plugged my memory stick into their kiosk and made my selections. I guess this opens more floor space for other products and reduces need for printing equipment and specialized employees. Just keep those $1.50 hotdogs coming.
$325 on Friday ! MARK IT !!!
SELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL stay in cash.....................................
I think this is it .. it will consolidate here and back on track to where it was ... $180+ ... longs - stay tuned - don't panic and buy more if you have cash .. this is the time when you add to your position and not to sell!! Good luck to you all!!
My only good stock. The rest of the market isn't that good.
Trump deal w China-yeah right.Bloated lying fool
Just thinking about pre market has my nerves wracking. Made some nice calls this morning too. GLTA
"My parents do purchase a Costco membership but my sister and her husband (and they do make big income working for a drug firm and could afford to pay membership card but they don't since they are too cheap). They would go in to shop along with my parents and their stuff would ring up together, then when they return home he would give my dad the money for his stuff. He said why pay? That is why is $500,000 home is paid up and all the money they now make close to $260K a year for both of them goes to savings for retirement. They are taking a cruse this week along with my parents."

I think short seller Chanos must've put out fake news! lol
Look for the SILLY DIPS as a BUY opportunity .Sales continue to soar !Cramer says its a great entry here.
"Wouldn't be ""shocked"" if WAL-MART goes down 15% and Costco gain 15% from current prices."
"I think Amazon prime memberships will continue to eat away at Costco Renewals. Probably have a good QTR but memberships will be down, $175 after earnings."
How in the hell does Costco drop $16 over the weekend..
why is this not moving the earnings were incredible. Strange

who is gambling this stock today.
more upgrade coming.
Targets for COST maintained as BUY.................................
The reason COSTCO is down because AMZN with the help of his friends who own the News media make it so. AMZN has to buy COSTCO to compete with Walmart. At of now AMZN is just a paper tiger. 30 billions sales in his last quarter compare to Costco 41 billions. Take out all the hypes and you will see that AMZN pose no threat to Walmart. All AMZN vendors are selling on Walmart now.

"Best company in the world, its going to the moon."

Costco makes it's money on memberships so Amazon won't be able to compete on price. Costco will prevail if price wars start.

Hey Hairy -So your genius move was to sell your 6 shares at 310. You complained for the last six months about what a #$%$ stock it is but you continue to stick around even After panic selling. You?ve been wrong since you started commenting on this board and you continue to be wrong. Your impatience and shortsightedness has cost you a lot of money. Just give it up man. Your party is over.
unbelievable! down almost $10 in premarket...everyone was thinking we would be up at least $10...makes no sense numbers are very good
Down again in an up market thanks to biden harris.
They are way over due for a special dividend.
TRUMP better change is TRADE POLICIES fast....................................
"I DON'T WANT A SPECIAL DIVIDEND!!! Neither do many of the institutional holders or individual holders. All it does is create more taxes! If you hold COST in a retirement account, you can't get at it to spend. COST has China to conquer and then many other areas. You will be much better off if they continue to prosper, with the regular dividend increased nicely each year and the stock price continuing to head skyward."
220.00 next
COULD A SPECIAL DIVIDEND BE COMING

"Stupid to buy COST for special $10, since price went up $10 = you are buying your dividend, plus you have to pay income tax, so only $8 divy net. Distribution is only 2.6% annual before taxes. Get tax free 'distribution' by waiting for a market drop. COSTCO's appreciation is slowing if you check price curves. Better to make money on price drops or buy something else."

Costco Wholesale is up 4.92% to 293.62
Dow down 1000 this week. Nice job Traitor Trump. You really showed the Chinese who’s the idiot.
Crazy market going down for no reason
300.49 and climbing !
Target is the one to own for the holidays.. WMT as well.
I'm sure Costco stock will be up by the end of the day ! My opinion .
"Special dividend?? I don't think so....Costco is all about looking out for employees, members, suppliers, and shareholders. This year it already raised wages for all employees substantially, and already raised the regular dividend, plus committed to plow $4 Billion into it's own stock, so don't think they will tack on a special div this year!"
cost have cash 14 B. total debt is 10 B. how could it's current ratio be 0.98 according to yahoo finance? they have enough cash to cover all debt
green by days end
COST a steal here............................
"COST is close to turning into a dumpster fire. Unfortunately, it doesn't matter how profitable they are, how many people shop there, how crowded the parking lots are, or how good their deals are. Yesterday, after a precipitous drop 2 weeks ago, the market rejected the stock again, as evidenced by it's breaking strong support and its 200 day moving average on very strong selling volume. It will turn around sometime, but I have no interest in riding this down. I'll re-enter when it shows technical signs of a reversal. Till then, I'll let someone else take the hit."
Recent stimulus checks to individuals have been fueling demand. The impact of same was visible in the company’s January’s sales results that exceeded analysts’ expectations. Look for another stimulus package soon .
hey guys lets just all buy one share tm morning and get some volume into this baby what do you guys say?
"Waiting for the big special dividend and a stock split, then the stock goes through the roof"

"Ridiculous depressed, add more after early dip this morning"
"Buy puts guys its going below 200 by end of next week, mark my words"
Keep buying more. Loyalty will always prevail in the end. All I know is whenever I'm at Costco the mass crowds say it all !
"I am confused,,,everyone knew about amazon,,,,ok,, Amazon cant take over COSTCO business,will never happen, so how is it taht the PE on Cost at 26 is too high,, WRONG,, The reality is AMAZON PE is so high it can not succeed,,,but why is it everyone is scared of being in Costco at 151 level...i dont understand it,,if tahts the case we should not be in any stock out here at all"
I think Costco is a great buy when you shop at Costco you see what you are buying I think this is also a great take over stock
Once I'm in at $279 (today?) it can stay above $300 where it should be 
Below $300 is a given but how low? Will it hit $200 or less?

Lower groceries is actually GOOD for COST since it eliminates competition; besides COST make majority of $$$ from membership fees NOT groceries.
"Missed on revenues by 20 million and missed earnings by 2 centsthe 1.24 was a non gaap number that resulted from a 7 cents 1 time non reoccuring gain that will not happen next quarter..Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) has reported first-quarter results, with diluted earnings-per-share coming in at $1.24 on $27.47 billion in revenue. The consensus estimate based on FactSet was diluted EPS of $1.19 on $28.3 billion in revenue. In the year-ago quarter, diluted EPS came in at $1.09. The $1.24 result this quarter included a non-recurring legal settlement of $0.07 per diluted share. Revenue increased 3% on a year-over-year basis. Comparables, or same-store sales, increased 1% year-over-year, with the United States and Canada seeing 1% and 4% gains, respectively. So-called ""Other International"" same-store sales came in flat. Excluding foreign exchange and the impact of changes"

"#$%$ almost 2% down ridiculous. a great company with great sales = no, we rather invest in risky and not proved companies just for the sake of money."
Shouldn't have gambled on earnings. Smh down again for nothing!
"There might just be a monster option play developing with COST. If we come back to the $360's support before earnings, this could be an incredible explosion to/through $400 by next CC. IMO, COST is going to improve each month through December. The overall excitement will calm down after January."
Any good news for this move??
Bernstein is telling everyone what they already know. AMZN is also overpriced by much more than COST so what. People are willing to pay up for the best.

Just bought 40 shares. First time shareholder here. GLTA
"It's interesting Wells came out with this ""downgrade"" yesterday. It was the dividend pay date. So maybe they and their customers own COST, and with the DRIP, this was a way to buy those shares at a 2+% discount. With a price target of $235, they didn't want to drag it that far down. It could easily recover back into the 240s."
imagine if the earnings were bad....always surprised good earnings driving the stock down...
Costco's supplies are shortage leads to low guidance...
"COST is a strong company, buy its share at a deep discount. Amazone can not sell gasoline on line, Costco can. Costco collects its annual membership fee (a billion dollar annual revenue) from the members around the world, Amazon can not. These are the facts that not so many people can think about them.Wall Street traders and hedge fund managers used the opportunity (AMZN buys Whole Foods) to drag the COST share price down so they can buy more shares. That is it."
So far any body looking at a graph today.Cost. Shorts are losing every measure so far.

Another 10% drop likely
"Costco Wholesale (COST) will report June same-store sales on Wednesday, although Gordon Haskett calls the stock a Buy today.Analyst Chuck Grom reiterated a Buy rating and $350 price target on Costco stock Monday, while also increasing his estimates for last month: He now expects the company will report core comparable sales up 7%, a 50-basis- point increase from his previous model."
"Serious question....when $10 special dividend paid does the stock goes down $10 the next day? As we all know, stocks that pay dividends go down the equivalent of their dividend amount the next day but since this is a special dividend I was wondering if this is the case. Thank you."
"Down grade, up grade are all BS, particularly to COST. I believe it will suppress COST down to around 290 which it is the resistance."
COST and AAPL must have stocks for 2020
good time to buy?
I think it will touch 330 after earning:) shorts cover now asap before they post earnings
Only $1 more to drop to find the 50dma.
You gusy realize COST is a $400 stock right? Have you guys seen the traffic at COST? They spent more money for their employee wages but they'll make up for it in sales as they continue to increase revenue. Watch the steady climb. It'll probably go to $350 by the end of March/early April.

Started working for Costco this year. Met the CEO last month. Great company. Very well run . Our most is wide.
"Unless Cost splits the stock, I highly doubt it will go below $300. That would have it go more than a 20% down. Can't see that happening. This selling will be done very soon. Like earnings day."
It’s funny how people trade this stock. It’s meant to be bought and held...

GOT TO LOVE IT!!!Costco Wholesale(COST) is already planning to open a second store in Shanghai and is hoping to start construction as soon as possible
Why is COST down? The stores are packed like never before. It just goes to show you the stock market is irrational and is more like a casino than anything else.
Why not put the money towards China build out of stores? The special dividend is good but increasing store count in China will be better use of company capital.
a lot of games get played with costco stock...just watch on earnings day...just like the Aug. sales report..record sales..record everything...but the stock tanks...same will happen on earningss

This company has huge growth potential. There are only 527 Costco’s in the United States. There is so much room for growth. For instance I visited my son in Albany NY and there isn’t a Costco within 70 miles. They are a great company that picks its locations carefully and expands slowly. In 10 years the stock price can easily triple.
"Costco Sales growth slowing down made the news and the stock took a breather. However, an article from Motley Fool pointed out that could be due to the accounting weeks of 12 vs 13 weeks. This would make sense as I have not detected any less traffic while going to Costco. I wonder if the Gee-whiz kids from Financial Services have adjusted the accounting weeks when reporting the Sales. Now people are aware of this difference in accounting weeks, the Earning Reports that is coming, hopefully would be adjusted. If Sales growth are increasing not decreasing, Earnings should follow suit. For those who are not into this stock, this could be an opportunity to get it. Another good Earning Report could push the stock higher. https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/05/costcos-sales-stayed-hot-in-most-of-november/"

"I became a millionaire during the Obama years...wonderful years for my 401k and the nation! Now, every day, because of the IDIOT now in office, I have to wonder if the next stupid presidential tweet will send my stock plummeting! Never had to worry with President Obama! When the President!s tweets affect my 401k, my livelihood, I WILL COMMENT! You don’t have to read ‘em!"
Looking like a lot of worthless options expiring tomorrow if it continues to stay flat!
"I have some LEAP calls on this. Was considering selling today on the rise but didn't, even though I figured COST would disappoint.Normally I don't want to hold options though earnings but this time I did. Why? Because this market is a casino.There are companies releasing terrible earnings and going up, companies releasing great earnings and going down.No one has any clue what is going to happen. WMT got smashed on great earnings.All you can do in this market now is roll the dice, or stay out of it completely!"
This is crapola giving employees raises and hitting the share holder last time I buy this it will take years to come to where I bought.. I am blasting this company every day on social media... Bohyah KMA
"There is a news article under Costco that shows someone has an optiontrade on that cost over 2million betting that costco will go to 115 by Jan. That is a long way down from the current price.

Costco sales up 4.4% for May. Slowdown from last quarter. Will slow further

COST is going to beat. People were rushing to Costco because they thought it was going to be the end of the world.
It just amaze me how stupid people are.Costco had total revenue of $176 Billion last year and Tesla had $25 Billion and Robinhooders think Tesla is better than Costco. They will learn lesson hard.

I believe in Costco and their business model. I too shop there quite frequently especially. I admit I got roped in by the special dividend. Lesson learned. it was a painful 3 days but I'm in for the long haul. Good luck to all.
What a wasted trade. Sold for a loss..
"thru out the entire covid, costco did so well. why is this stock not going anywhere? stuck in low 300's for almost a year now."
COST would rather pay employees higher wages than give a special dividend.
"COST is way undervalued here , just a screaming BUY for me, less competition is good for COST !!!!!"
Sold my 3000 shares on a limit sell at $309/sh but believe after this short dip that COST will soar past $315!
lemme out! lemme out! lemme ouuuuuut!!!
never sell this gem.
I am long COSTbut this bear hug is pretty strong!!

Costco Wholesale reached an all time high at 328.52
Anyone else notice the large blocks of 10/16 call options bought at a $460 strike price?? It’s at $345 pre earnings.. Am I crazy or is that real?

"Still sticking with my previous comments here regarding a upswing in the waiting but, maybe, COST needs to split it's stock ? That isn't going to created any more value of any sort but, it might ignite some buying interest. Buying back it's shares, I don't think is the answer because on a P/E, it's still a bit lofty. My opinion anyway."
this stock was destroyed last week for no reason other than valuation.
They just talked about how having a workforce that feels valued has paid off. So to all you people complaining about the wage increase...
"Suddenly, this is falling apart."
"Costco Wholesale (COST) PT Raised to $230 at BofA/Merrill Lynch on Q1 Report; 'Accelerating Traffic, Comps & Membership Growth' Source: streetinsider dot com"
should have sold at 382..my gut was telling me to
there is no reason at all this should even open red!
"1% down is not a sell off people ! May be green tomorrow , earning not bad at all ."
Might go down to 150 sadly.
down .07 in after hours whats going on?
what about the div. did they raise it
Wow straight down day again! There is no hope for this stock...down 13% YTD all red days so far
Americans keep buying stuff despite the pandemic — retail sales rise for a third straight month !COST traffic increased almost 30%

How's everyone doing.....cashed out my PUTS....made over $k in th e last week on COST....made even More with XLP PUTS!
"I pick up some call today, and bet on earnings on Thursday. I know it beats the estimate but in this situation, everybody said it is too high valuation. I DON'T MINE."
"""Costco May sales rise 7.5% to nearly $13 billion, online sales double""Here we go... this is a shot Costco stock needed. A little reassurance that they are flying high. OH, lets here those naysayer's say something about negative Costco's online sales now , LOL. Can you looses say ""DOUBLE IN SALES ONLINE""?""Costco May sales rise 7.5% to nearly $13 billion, online sales double"""
Should have kept the Pimento Cheese. Down $9 after hours. Americans hate virtue signaling.
earnings estimate anyone?
CC link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/gov88uus
"Maybe earnings increase $1 per year for the next 10 years. Brings todays 40 PE to about 18. Seems like a modest expectation given the current years performance and the increased credibility Costco has earned during this crisis. Plus add in China with its 1 warehouse. There are what, 600 warehouses in the US? China has 3 times the population. If Costco is all about price and quality, how is that going to fail? All I am saying is that people and institutions will trade the stock up and down but the underlying asset keeps getting better. Also, yeah maybe November's 13% sales increase was a disappointment, lol, but remember Covid 19 has gotten a lot worse, so maybe 13% is stellar."
$300 coming soon....starts today
Market cap is under annual revenue why is PE ratio so high in comparison to this?? Can anyone explain?
Who upgraded Costco today
215 next week before 2019 225..non stop customers wish they would increase prices 10% across board. people will still shop
"We,LL I,m a very bullish but tomorrow is Friday, I don't think whole lot of investees are like to leave money in the market over the couple of days off.I think may be by Monday it shoot up may,be 305 to 310 ish."
I bought a call today did a big mistake seems like
Putin laughing at us - says US no longer a superpower. China and Germany are the new superpowers. A moron in the oval office can do a lot of damage in 4 short years (which seemed like an eternity).
Costco is not a Boeing stock. up 15 down 10 up 12. Not for day traders. Long Term investment only.
regarding costco travel... be warned if you book a hilton vacation through costco you WILL NOT receive the points or the nights to your hilton account. first hand very poor experience
"You have to admit, if Amazon is getting into food, it is going to take some of Costco's business. That is a fact that you can't deny. I would say most Costco customers are Prime members because if they are willing to pay a membership fee, they are willing to pay for Prime. So losing any business to Amazon is too much. Don't just ignore the problem, when your Prime comes up for renewal, don't let it auto renew, cancel it. We have got to keep Amazon at bay. When a company loses business, the stock will drop---Now that is a fact of life. Amazon will hurt Costco. I didn't say they would drive them out of business, but they will cause the stock price to drop because of lost sales. Don't be naive."
"No position....so envious of the (regular!) special dividends that Costco gives! Congrats, longs!"
time to find a stock that worthy. Back to $150 or lower...
how do you see if p/e ratio is to high
In the tank again today
Look for the dips..............BBUUUUUUUYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
"Costco reminds me of McDonald’s. McDonald’s not only profits from selling Franchises, and profiting from selling food products. It creates cash flows for the Franchisees to pay McDonald’s properties. Since McDonald’s owns the restaurants, the appreciation of the real-estates boosts the bottom line of the company. Analysts tend to compare Costco with other Big Box Retailers like Walmart. However, Costco business model is different than the others Retailers. Costco profit on products sold is very thin. It does not offer a large variety of products but it offers popular products. As a result, the products move very fast at a very large volume. The large volume helps to make up the thin margin. Costco’s profit is actually on the membership that it collects. So, when Costco sales numbers goes up, the profit that it makes is not really from the sales. It actually means that there are more new members (paying membership fees) shopping.Both companies have a niche. Costco’s business model seems to be working well. All the new Costco Store that are opening overseas are doing very well. There should be a lot of growth for Costco for expanding its footprint all over the world much like McDonald’s. While Costco is not bulletproof as it would go down if or when the market crashes but unless the world is ending, it would come back up. Personally, I am not sure I did the right thing to buy Costco. While I’ve made more than 20% from Costco, I liquidate Gold Bullion Coin to raise the cash. Gold appreciated more than 30+% after I sold. I consider Gold and Costco are both good long-term investments. Gold is more of an insurance and Costco is for growth. I have no regret buying Costco. Good luck to all the longs."
"Tomorrow up $5.00 - $10.00, short gets fried!"
Grab'em while it's under $300!
"Traders have only 2 1/2 trading days to get the dividend. Tomorrow the market is open, Thursday closed for the holiday, Friday 1/2 day of trading and Monday the 30 which is the last day."
Finally Costco is getting the attention it deserves. The first time it touched 300 was around end of August.
Such an easy buy...it will be green today. Bravo for a company that spends money worrying about their employees. They beat and now their ecommerce platform is more popular. Win- Win!
You cant keep a good company down.
SHORT U WONT SEE 305
It looks like bouncing on the bottom.
glad i bought at 370!
I wish Cramer would shut up already about Costco!! At least there was an upgrade.
Special divided coming soon .
"I for one don't see the connection in terms of Whole Foods and Costco. I have shopped in Whole Foods and its expensive. Is Amazon going to change that? Plus I buy all my paper products, eyeglasses, and other non Food stuff that I wouldn't think Whole Foods would even have..I for one think this is a total overreaction and a good opportunity to pick up some Costco to either add to ones position or start one. IMHO"
"I think after AMZN , COST is a brand and experience company."
It is a solid earning -https://www.nasdaq.com/article/costco-wholesale-corporation-q1-profit-climbs-20181213-01019

A $20 per share hit today?? What was that all about?
"With earnings around the corner, and the BOD paying out over $4billion for this special dividend, should we not be expecting them to beat expectations?"
"Riyadh (AFP) - A Saudi financial newspaper Sunday retracted an article it published the previous day saying that Riyadh planned to sell a 49 percent stake in state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco within a decade.""Al-Eqtisadiah apologises for the information published on Aramco,"" said the paper, which like most media in Saudi Arabia is close to the authorities.Saturday's edition quoted an unnamed senior official as saying that the kingdom would sell nearly half of its sole oil producer within 10 years.""The shares for sale and the timeframe are different to those mentioned in the article,"" the paper said on Sunday.The kingdom is looking to diversify its oil-dependent economy and has already announced cutbacks after its 2015 deficit snowballed to $97 billion (93 billion euros).The IPO for state-owned Aramco could take place in 2018 and an initial sale of a five percent share is expected to form the basis for the fund holding around $2 trillion in assets.The firm will next year begin publishing quarterly results in a bid to attract potential investors, Aramco chief Amin Nasser has said."

"Trump is a crrok , carefull what you read as there seems to be no truth."
What are the numbers?.....
"the facemask required policy in stores is hurting costco. been watching social media on the subject for a while now. since they started the policy, more and more people have been canceling their memberships everyday. people refusing to shop there until they end the mask policy. if folks are posting on social media about it, you know there are many more doing the same that aren't posting. its gotta effect the bottom line eventually. not sure what to think of it, but i don't think its good business."
typical Friday sell off
I'm not going back to Costco until they get rid of that ridiculous mask rule.
thank you for the special dividend !!!
October sales after the bell. Get ready for a new high!
"Inflation just around the corner, and that will be great for Costco"

This stock does best when no one is talking about it.
Costco is up now due to people try to stock many stuffs due to coronavirus and they will turn after this mess. This year people will spend less money after because layoffs are happening now across the country. The site filing for unemployment benefits crashed yesterday
"COST will start to move up again after next week all the fear from Jay Powell subsides. COST beats WMT everyday. Look at TGT, the earnings is still lower than COST."
is this really going to break through 300?

380 then 400.....
"The bull market giveth, the bear market taketh away"
"Holding up well here, look for buy opportunities."
"There’s no news on Costco, so that isn’t depressing the stock today, especially when the broad market is up. It must be some selling by some institutional shareholder(s), possibly even cashing in in large gains from strong performance over the past couple of years. In the absence of news, this is likely a temporary dip that will correct in a short while, assuming the overall markets aren’t changing a lot."
"costco can have great numbers, just like last qtr wall st expect so much more pandemic or not..this stock is just about where it was last qtr its had nice gains, but also gives back those gains"
Does anyone think AMZN will buy COST?
Let's get to 260 today

Not so great (but still appreciated} if your items are rather bulky and you have to lift them somehow to scan.

"TEN ANALYSTS upped their target price, up to $360-$412, after the report yesterday.Also, COSTCO did beat all estimates noticeably.But shares down strongly on report, even in today's up market - I feel this is wrong; should recover. I bought a week ago three call spreads $300/$360 for Oct; as a result I am a bit down right now.Good Luck!Emanuil"
It Won’t recover Amazon and Walmart is attacking Costco Er
If you have a lapse from shopping at Costco like say 3 weeks it is better if you wait 2 months before renew Costco membership you then get extra value from you membership cost. Costco structure is you will lose those 3 weeks that you have not shopped when you renew because the original anniversary stays the same. Many people use the other warehouse membership for this exact purpose. Plus you get quality brand food change instead of the same over and over again.
Well now! ..... We made the 50dma today. Let the rise resume.
up and away for the close.
COST is a good place to pickup the virus.

Imagine if the entire U.S. became a Delivery Oriented Country... we'd have delivery vehicles up and down our local streets constantly 7 days a week... I'd call that annoying.
My only stock that came out in the green today.
How much loss will we suffer today?
if you sell this stock your betting against warren buffet. Good luck

Why Costco can’t go higher since last July.
This was a buy the dip imo.. time will tell. The China bs will be over withjust like Nafta. Trump is a businessman. Don’t forget that
Costco is one of the best company you ever seen the services company is variant very good
Targets Increased !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"The beauty of Costco opening up in places like China is how they can just ignore Trump. Costco doesn't manufacture much - they do put the Kirkland name on a few items, but the world over loves the Costco way."
"COST P/E is 36. For comparison, TGT is 26, and WMT is 21. COST profit margin from sales is around 2-3%, so most $$ is made from memberships. As someone else noted, ""who out there doesn't have a Costco card?"" This makes it hard to grow revenue fast. I don't think they'll drop, but I see no reason to go much higher for a while.Would love to hear some _reasonable_ arguments to the contrary."
"I am getting frustrated with COST which I had bought for $303 back in March 2020 and the stock is now only $307. This appears to be a great company with lackluster stock. Next time COST hits $310, I will likely sale and put my money in stocks with more upside potential."
COST needed to make a base here.
"The fee increase will work out for cost because currently it already is a huge rev maker. for members, it is really nothing comparing with the savings. If you use the gasoline from costco, you get your money back with several fills. It is a no brainer move and once the street digested the missed numbers, they will focus on the fee windfall. they drop the price, load up and then hike the PT!"
"This company is the Amazon of retail warehouse shopping. Will continue to prosper regardless of socio-economic conditions - pre or post Covid. They earn the majority of revenue from memberships, not product margin. Nobody is going to cancel their membership just because there's an approved vaccine. Today is just an excuse for some to take profits."
"Today is a good example how Costco does it's own thing, the Nasdaq has leveled off while Costco keeps going higher. Love it. Might be time for you few wieners to just get off here then to worry daily."
why is this not going up?
OppenheimerXYZ RATES THIS Outperform CitiXZZ Neutral Target $36007.02JEFFREY DAHMER GREAT PLACE TO MEET PEOPLE NICKS LUNCHEON SPECIAL Equal Weight $8999340
"Nobody buying the $1500 patio dining set, keep seeing the CDC warning sign. Opex looks near $302.50 around there so no big movement, unless China sanctions are applied."
Presidents don't affect the the economy. doesn't matter if the orange man Trump or dementia creepy Joe win. COSTCO will be a $500 stock by sometime in 2021.
"Walmart is already off 15% from its 52-week high, Target is 26% off, Amazon is 19% off while Costco is only 7.5 % off. Costco needs to drop to $210 to get closer to those three. It's doable, market is bloody tomorrow."
Costco didn’t beat SPY for past 5 years.
market is going to fall hard. so much debt from stock buybacks.

Got my dividend check yesterday. With 385 shares it was decent. Hoping for strong results for the 1/4. I'm a 20+ year employee and avid shopper. Love the club!!
More and more AR products will be sold in Costco. $WIMI
Special dividend drives it up 10%
"Global war could hurt! But then we will all become homeless. Watch some videos on homeless and learn to livewith buckets to #$%$ in while living under tents. I am 74, so I will escape by death! Meanwhile Costco is going to $220."
YES Great earnings guys. $400
costco down after hours...I guess the 16% wasn't enough
stock market on fire..costco red?
Look at NAT making a comeback! Oil coming back folks...
When is the dividend payable?
Take that AMZN
"For those who've been looking for the special dividend, looking like wish is coming.All in, Wall Street would be wise to look beyond the pandemic pay issue on Costco. Being generous with employee compensation has long been in the Costco DNA as a means to drive strong customer service and prevent workers from leaving for other gigs (which is a cost). Moreover, with strong sales momentum into the holidays and a looming board meeting where Costco could announce new shareholder friendly uses for all its cash — the stock does have positive catalysts on the horizon."
"Costco delivering what was promised by Amazon, still no love from Wall Street."
315-320 pleaseeeeee
Wall street need to reward companies that treat workers well. Same time earn profits higher than 1 year ago. Wall Street need to punish companies that treat workers terrible.Happy employee repeat customers turn loyal.
"Visiting the store twice a week, not 'cause I love shopping there, but continuing to check on inventory. Their buyers need to scour all over the world for items like thermometers, N95 masks, flu medications, etc. For example, if they could get a hold of N95 masks, I bet they could sell a million per week. Toilet paper and cleaning paper are not the only hot items. Distribution of the paper items is uneven. A friend in Minnesota can get toilet paper, but we can't obtain it in Hawaii. Think of this as a war, Mr. Costco. Fill in the gaps."
Going under 335?....
Take profits now. Remember what Walmart did after earnings. You’ll get it back at a lower price
this might bull flag
in Alberta Costco had to go to 15% capacity and now the government up the capacity to 25% of fire code . I assume many other provinces and states in the US had similar capacity restrictions. a lot of what people are saying on this board is questionable and just noise. it only makes sense that once these capacities go to full the pastures will be greener.
"I fully expect Amazon to be going into the dental business tomorrow. They will send a dentist to your house to extract teeth. Today they announced a geek squad to take away Best Buys business. If you don't BOYCOTT AMAZON, I hope everyone who shops there loses money in their brokerage account. If you own any retailers, grocers, auto supply places, food companies, pharma companies, etc. The list grows daily. They will be selling insurance probably next week."
china conference on trade talk 11pm china time ....few minutes to go
"If one has any money, Costco has the holiday season coming up, they still have excellent growth and the economy is very good. Bottom line now is the chance to buy Costco under $330."
+4.39 today....stagnant? Just not seeing what you’re seeing. I’ll take it
300 by tomorrow?
People will spend less and much less now than 2 weeks ago when they tried to stock up everything
Going up!
"Congratz longs, nice move AH. Glad the last couple down days didn't deter those that held on. I reduced half my position and will hold the rest tomorrow. With the way the markets been selling off, you just never know what happens. Good luck everyone."
great quarter..no worries
Going to 270 in a hurry and the special dividend on top of that !!!!
230 is a support....
"I JUST LOVE HOW THIS SITE IS EDITED. THEY ERASE THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS AND RETAIN THE OPTIMISTIC. WHAT B---S---- NO, THERE'S NO MANIPULATION. SURE, EVERYTHING IS FAIR. ABOVE BOARD. EVERYONES HONEST HERE. LET ME ASK THIS FOR YOU ETERNAL OPTIMISTS. EVERYONE IS EXPECTING COSTCO TO HAVE BLOW OUT NUMBERS BECAUSE....'GEEEE..EVERY TIME I DRIVE BY THERE'S ALWAYS A LINE OUTSIDE' INTERESTING. MAYBE THEYRE JUST BUYING TOILET PAPER. IN ANY EVENT, THE STOCK IS DOWN SOME 60 POINTS IN11 WEEKS. WHAT IF...AND I'M JUST SPECULATING HERE.... WHAT IF, THEY MISS TOMORROWS NUMBERS ? CAN YOU IMAGINE THE HIT ON THE STOCK THEN ? FOR YOU EDITORS UT THERE, WHO WANT TO POST ONLY POSITIVE COMMENTS, TRY TO RETAIN THIS LONGER THAN 20 SECONDS. HAVE SOME INTEGRITY."
"If Costco decides to issue a special dividend, it would probably come around Christmas time by providing unexpected money to boost holiday spending, or perhaps in Jan. of 2020, so people can plan and delay the need to pay tax on it until Apr. 2021."
Buy this crazy panic sell off or wait until the next leg down?
I smell a tank once earnings come out
Terrific quarterly earnings report yesterday! Red day on the market due to tariff battles with Mexico and China. No bigee
"You would think with all the coin Costco rakes, it would improve customer service instead of making it worse. Case in point. Had a problem with a product I purchased. Six months back, Costco went to a new vendor for this product and the quality from this vendor was poor/inconsistent quality to the previous supplier. I went out to email a complaint to Costco after encountering an awful package from their new vendor only to find there was no longer a means to contact Costco via email on a consumer related issue. They're promoting an on-line chat instead. Sooooo... I fired it the chat window and after waiting over 10 minutes for a rep to respond on the other side - that never happened - I droped off an did a snail-mail letter to the company. You know what the company did? Forwarded my letter to the vendor. By doing so, Costco was telling me they chose that vendor for the bottom line and not product quality, and if I had issues with the product, I was to deal with the vendor direct and that Costco would continue to stock inferior items from cheap vendors."
I sure hope the market stabilizes tomorrow. It was a tough day to be an investor.
Why is Costco taking a hit today?
back in the good ole days when the market was red like today..Costco would be one of the only green stocks..
Major buy.

"If they can stop paying this much to their employees, this stock is gonna be worth so much more.. Store clerks make more than some engineers."

"how much of that $1400 is going to increase Costco revenue? I must assume a significant bump, but have no way to quantify it."
people keep comparing this stock to Amazon..not even close
"Earnings will be good, I bet ya the stock will go down initially though, it seems to be the trend this quarter"
"Costco price target raised to $200 from $185 at Stifel Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan raised his price target on Costco to $200 from $185, noting that the company's Q1 ""core-on-core"" gross margin was likely better-than-feared given concerns about the promotional environment and that its comp growth rate of 10.5% was the strongest since FY11. He maintains a Buy rating on the shares, but said he does not anticipate material movement in the shares versus the market today based on this report. In pre-market trading, Costco shares are up about 2% to $190.95.Source: TheFly"
"Which is why you can buy Costco, down here, on the ridiculous sell-off that has always proven to be a bargain worth shopping for every quarter the stock gets hammered on illusory concerns, of which this quarter has more than ever."
"Lets put it this way as this slides I will buy! Great company with no china exposure. They buy major bulk items, low cost."
Don't see this PE Ratio (TTM) 37.46 too high?
"When you compare BJ’s earnings with Costco’s, it becomes clear that Costco has hit a limit. Bj’s has seen exponential growth that is not yet reflected in their stock price. With a P/E of 14, revenue of $15 billion on the 2020 fiscal year, yet a $5 billion market cap, its evident that Bj’s is a better buy. Costco has more market share, yes, but you can’t expect significant gains from a company that doesn’t have rapid growth in their future when compared to their competitors. BJ’s growth rate in both earnings and revenue is significant and yet that is not reflected in their current valuation. They posted earnings today too, they beat, and marked significant growth q/q and y/y."
"Like to shop COST and would like to own more shares except at current valuation, COST is trading at about 35 this year projected earning which is a bit stiff compared to other retail giants. Will wait for pull back to build more positions."
"Tom, tks for your encouragement while Costco was sleeping. I added more a few days ago!!"
I sold when it was down that day $8 and change..now look at it
"less employee turnover with wage increase.. less money spent on hiring costs, and trainning., .happier employees, produce more effective work, with less effort.ask any retailer about benefits of keeping trained employees, verses having to replace experienced employees...."

I expected it down on great earnings. Membership is key. Maybe that is why it is up.

"Read this and you would be crazy to hold st this price level...They may have made much less profits than they reported “Costco Slides After Earnings, 'Material Weakness' Warning”"
Costco stock price target raised to $255 from $225 at UBS
Costco never goes up the day after earnings. #$%$ stock
gawd...what happened?...this is going down $20 tomorrow
pre market stock down $5...MM doing their thing..told ya so
Costco PE still way over high compared to other retailers.
"Higher highs each day, nice and steady. Costco's business is not only safe, it will climb back up to the ""worry"" of Amazon. About one of the only dips in the market to buy these days."
When is the $10 dividend and what date do u have to be a shareholder to receive it
I just don't see how you can justify a P/E of over 37 for a brick and mortar retail stock
"Over the past decade, Costco has doubled their revenue, tripled free cash flow, net income and the dividend. Net margin % increased by 50%. ROA, ROE and ROIC all increased in a big way. All while keeping a pristine balance sheet, with employees treated great with highest pay in retail. And most important to shareholders, share price has increased by about 300% over the same period. A success story any way you want to look at it! Costco always trades at a premium to the market and deservedly so! However, the forward P/E of 27 is difficult to justify based on their expected growth and in this stock market environment in my opinion. Not saying you can't make money from these levels over the long term, just saying the strong buy is somewhere closer to a P/E of 20 (or in the $150's). However unpopular that opinion may be."
"After earnings, this guy will be at $325 easily :)"
"wow down a lot for an up day in the market. I knew it was due for a drop, I guess I sold my puts a little too soon."
Heres a $25 off code Costco online purchase of $250 or more. Expires 2/29 AV4CWUL.
PEG is 5.37 on Fidelity. I can’t say I’m not concerned.
Credit Card Boomdoggle. I know someone real smart at Costco thought they could save all this money by going to VISA. See what you get? To me it cheapens the Costco brand. It makes it more like the B&I down in Tacoma.
Shorts better cover......................170-180.00 next.
Should fall to at least $280 until support is found over the next few weeks.
Look for the dumb people who sell off
Why has it been declining from $360 when there’s no bad news?
Started my position with Costco today. Plan to buy more if it continues to dip
let's hsave one of them $20 up spikes today?
"Analyst Scot Ciccarelli reiterated an Outperform rating and $381 price target on Costco on Thursday. He says the discounter should be able ""to increase its U.S. store base by more than 400 warehouses or about 75% over time which, at current expansion rates, enables nearly 20 years of incremental unit growth."""
"cant get ahesd...this stock is at a stalemate...up $8 yesterday, down $4 today, will lose $4 ,tomorrow. $300 max price for this stock"
I really don't understand all of you who bought for the $10 dividend. $10 on a stock that is $380...it can move $10 a day on no news. Now all who bought and held through the ex-dividend date are dumping and you are stuck with even less than you had before even if GET the dividend. Does that make sense to you?

i found a feather in my baby spinach from Costco yesterday! do they not check their food before selling it to families?
"A company has a great earnings report, good cash flow, and people still sell this. Only madness is left in these markets."
"Yesterday, I mentioned an event that a pike in volume; 141k was traded at 9:52 AM. Today, a bigger spike happened at 432k at the beginning of the trade session. Granted, this could be all the orders collected overnight and executed at the start of the trading day. However, this volume is over 3 times the spike I saw yesterday. This is spike is not visible unless you expand the daily chart. The cost of this spike is probably not due to retail investors. Some institutions is/are trading this stock in large quantity. The value traded first thing this morning was about $160 Million."

this is one of those stocks you just dont sell....I had AMZN stock a few years ago..only 100 shares..sold it at $600...wishing now I would have kept it
My local Silicon Valley Costco had shelves half full - with nothing stacked above. I've never seen it look that way. Chinese shoppers wearing masks and loaded up with water as if their tap water must be tainted. I have to give credit to the guys loading the shelves - but will they run out? It's so hyper competitive here - even shopping gets that way.
"Fight all you want, lose all your money it will go up"
"just bought costco,, 160.68,,,, 1000 shares,,lets see a quick run up"
"I am very pleased with my Costco shopping experience. I have taken full advantage of having an executive membership along with having and using the new CITI visa card. My wife and I send an average of about $200 a week including gas. We have, in the past have gone way above that average with big purchases of furniture, t.v.'s , vacations etc. I use the VISA everytime and pay it off each month. My executve check averages anywhere for $200 - $400 each year while my VISA check(used to be AMEX) is anywhere from $300-$900 each year depending on shopping needs. My wife and I have decided to always buy at Costco our items first, other retailers second if Costco cant meet our needs. We were a family of 4, now the kids are both in college so we have tweeked our purchases a bit. Costco is a very smart business model, their rebates on their memberships as well as their CITI Visa are outstanding. Just getting the 2% on Costco purchases is a smart way to shop. I receive 2% with executive and another 2% using the Citi Visa, then pay of the balance each month. Also 4% on gasoline at Costco as well as any other major gas retailer. Yes, you still need to be disciplined on your shopping each month, so you do not over spend, but if you manage your money well, Costco has given everybody a great way to save money on quality goods and services while giving you great cash rewards each year. Come to find out that the T.V. that I purchased also get an extended 2 additional years on top of the mfg's warranty because I charged with my Costco CITI VISA. My point about all of this is that not only has Costco been a great place to shop, its business model to the consumer has been outstanding for prices, quality, return policy, and rebates. I will receive nearly $1000 from last years shopping between the 2 checks( 1 from CITI Visa, 1 from Costco for being an executive member). And all of that doesn't even take in account all of those ""instant"" rebates off on items that I buy on a monthly basis anyway. Its just a great place to shop, and they make my shopping experience an exceptional one. Way to go Costco!! Keep up the good work!!"

Without question, the four best are COST - Dollar General/DG - Ross Stores/ROST - Burlington Stores/BURL. I'm driving myself crazy trying to decide which of the four to go with, while in the meantime the share prices keep going up. They're all excellent, solid companies. Can't decide which to choose. Informed opinions would be appreciated.. Thanks."
After hours trading ($314) puts Costco at a 20% downfall from it's highs. Still doubt it will fall below $300 Nope!
In today at 309. Let's see where this ends up in 5+ years.
TRUMP made global slowdown..............................RECESSION next
"load up at this low price, the same price a year ago, but with better revenues and more cash."
I would think that the closing of Sears and Kmart stores should be a positive for Costco. Any thoughts?
You all wonder why Costco shares are not recovering? It is the chicken s**t traders that react to any rumor be it real or false. It has nothing to do with the company itself. Costco is a very solid company--stay for the long haul you won't be disappointed.
the price will be adjusted $10 plus the regular divided of $.70
"No one should support BLM, they are domestic terrorist."
"costco always gets screwd on earnings it never fails...this ER was not bad..with the pandemic, and other concerns it did very well in my opinion"
"Just an observation;COST has again doled out a special dividend. They are growing at an impressive clip and have barely knocked on the door in China let alone the rest of Asia for that matter. Prices aren’t going down people. Your Sun Dried tomatoes are the cheapest price anywhere and they are 50% higher than 5 years ago. Rib Steak is $14/LB. used to be $7 just 5 years ago. Why am I saying this? Inflation. Divvy keeps rising. Stores keep opening at a break neck pace. One of the best run businesses anywhere for a B&M store let alone any store for that matter. One other thing. They are sitting at a 40X valuation. Under normal circumstances, one would run for the hills for a retail store. But COST is not your average retail store now is it? It’s middle income central for the World! It’s not going away. It pays a 2%+ divvy overall. Most sound money out there. CD? T-Bill? Nah, grab COST and take that 2% divvy for life. As long as interest rates are way down here, COST will retain the most reserved investor. $425 by EOY. $475 - 2021 EOY"
Headed to 189 wait for it
"Regardless of any trade war, Costco will always remain a neutral member for both parties. Win-Win"

"Talked to some friends who got furloughed. They can't even get through the unemployment website because it freezes up. Most have not received their stimulus checks yet, $1200 isn't enough anyway. Companies can get loans all day, but the consumer is broke and can't buy anything. More than 50% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Redfin and Exp Realty laid off 25% of their agents. Mortgage servicers delaying payments per Fed relief mandate will cause defaults to skyrocket, and the housing market to crash. They're painting the tape here, and if you listen to any sane institutional investor, they're not buying this rally because the worst is yet to come. This is true for COST and the market as a whole. Even Powell said the market is crippled, and that we shouldn't open it back up until July! Imagine 3 more months of this lockdown."

"It's a shame the SEC doesn't protect retail investors like they do hedge funds. As we are seeing today in Costco, funds can control, manipulate and steal shares from the little guy with no consequences. Let the reverse happen, like the GME run, and the SEC is going to make sure heads roll. Sad."
"@Candyman This is a post from Stockhouse. I can only reply to it with a big smile. Cheers Debt free GRAPHITE MINEUptick is around the corner buddy, i'm guessing ""NASDAQ""...TBD? plus The house passed Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package, we're waiting on the Senate to finalize the deal. Regardless The democrats are shifthing thier attentions towards EV, and green energy. Gratomic Inc is a safe haven....The biggest piece of information (imo): TORONTO, ON / ACCESSWIRE / October 28, 2020 / Gratomic Inc. (“GRAT” or the “Company”) (TSXV:GRAT) (OTC Pink:CBULF) (FRANKFURT:CB81) (WKN:A143MR) announces that it is in the process of submitting 243 Kg of high purity graphite concentrate obtained from its pilot testing program for characterization for use as anode material in Lithium Ion battery cells. The graphite will initially be put through an Air Classification process in Toronto, Ontario and from there will be sent to Dorfner Anzaplan in Germany to undergo spherical micronization and classification.Key note: Spherical graphite is a crucial ingredient to the efficient operation of lithium ion batteries, its the key component of the anode.....China is among the largest graphite producer in the world, producing around 700,000 metric tons of the metal. what people don't realize is that China uses synthetic graphite for the most. Battery is one of the few applications, where Natural and Synthetic graphite compete with each other. The battery manfucturers are shifting their focus towards natural graphite over synthetic graphite WHY? to bring down the production $cost but more importantly beacuse of environmental issues... Cue in Gratomic Inc, low cost, processed from naturally sourced graphite material, aiming to become a cleaner graphite source.....self explanatoryTo better understand things, here's an article whereby Volkswagen appoints watchdog to ensure ethical battery supply: The German carmaker has entered a “strategic partnership” with RCS Global, an agency that specialises in supply chain analysis. The company calls itself “the proven leader in data-driven responsible sourcing of natural resources” and already has partnerships with companies including Sony and Nokia.The focus of the partnership, according to VW, is on auditing its suppliers “for conformance with human rights, safe working conditions and environmental protection along the supply chain all the way back to the mines.”VW and RCS have identified 134 “sub-suppliers” and 18 mines in the carmaker’s supply chain. The majority of these have reportedly already been audited. The expanded audit operation has also allowed VW to introduce due diligence measures for each type of raw material that VW sources.Serious audit violations will lead to disqualification from VW’s supply chain. This would apply to small-scale mining operations where “child labour cannot be ruled out”, says VW.Cheers,"
Nothing like a good panic. The sky is falling. HAHA
Just went to Costco for the deals. Oh my lord. Traffic and parking was insane. Saw two people punching each other in the parking lot. So many people. I wound up leaving. Not today.
To management: This family is fed up with your face mask gestapo employees. Saw one Costco door woman (Plano TX) berate a family while a Costco employee pranced by without a mask. It either applies to all or no one. Double standards are for politicians. Not for someone buying eggs. Either change or we’re done shopping until you do.
I am on the Bullish Side for this Earnings Play. Costco getting pumped after earnings. Earnings plays are a Gamble tho we will see
"Hey Hairbag and Harrigo- how do ya like the old COST now? Did you guys bail before the $14+ bump today? As the guy starring up at Dirty HARRY's .357 once said...""I just gots ta know...."""
ROFL $WMT gets a whopping $77 price target and its trading at $80... wonder what it will do in near term sell off??? $COST is probably a better buy as there isn't much up here this thing will trade sideways if your lucky.
Costco needs to learn how to lie a bit more in their earnings reports.
"seems like the only good stock lately is tesla...might have to dump the costco junk, and move to tesla"
come on....280.00 and 278.00
Selling overdone....
"More reasons to believe $400 is coming, the analyst action targeting $400 and more have been piling up! Analyst Actions: Loop Capital Adjusts Costco Wholesale's Price Target to $405 From $395, Reiterates Buy Rating"
costco closes above 250.
"hate to sound like a broken record, but costco really does need to split the stock...its going nowhere..because its expensive..2:1 split would light this on "
After market close. Here we go! Hopefully we see. 5 percent rise on good news but lately in this market if they guide lower we are gonna be toast.
EPS beat and revenue miss. Well glass half full is OK. I put some back in here to recoup loss in run up today. Better than top and bottom miss. OK lets get 15.00 a share more now.
Look for the silly dips to do some buying302.00-315.00

Costco has in California $3.05 !!! Great price In California
"I hope Costco delivers strong earnings that blows up wall street's estimates and announce 4-1 stock splits. Today market sold off heavily and Amazon dropped more than 100 points before it recovers some lost, and lost ~70 points, Costco went down more than a buck then recovered and jumped more than 3 points that signals strong buying and short covering before Wednesday. I think Costco will test or break new high this week"
woow er 1.90 more than 19 cents
Is it possible we see green today?
"dreamers!... this is over rated..over sold..warren buffet saw it, milked this company, got great money from it and left..should followed him"
"Imagine next year with no tax cuts? This stock will be trading around 120. Can’t imagine even after today’s tumble, the PE is still 27. That’s ridiculous, expect another 7-10% drop next week"
Blows away the sales consensus numbers again today. Earnings numbers next week take it over 250.
"If you are not BOYCOTTING AMAZON, you deserve to have costco going down. Costco is a great company and AMAZON is taking down everyone that competes with them. I won't buy a thing from them. Amazon announced wanting to get into food service so today those stocks are down. The next thing you know they will have a brokerage firm with trades costing a few cents. BOYCOTT AMAZON"
Food and gas sales will pickup soon. Get in today. good luck to all
BJ'S is another that beat analysts expectations and traded down as they didn't issue guidance. I'm seeing a definite trend here.
Analysts on Yahoo Finance are stating that Forward P/E of 29 is too high. I guess they seem to conveniently ignore the astronomical P/E of FANG stocks. #DoubleStandards

"Walmart, Amazon and now Target have one thing in common...they all have introduced hydrogen fuel cell technology to improve supply chain and warehousing effeciency...

"Same old story, drops day after earnings and then will head above $300. Rinse and repeat."
Disappointed 
Great numbers! So what if they spent $285 million on sanitation and enhanced wages during the pandemic quarter? Just goes to demonstrate that Costco responded to the crisis in an appropriate manner. People see this and builds confidence in how company is being run. Long Costco
Amazon can be lot more profitable if they bought from Costco and sold online. Just saying..

FYI. I was in a Costco yesterday in England and was ordering something they’d run out of. The place was RAMMED with people and I asked how many the girl reckoned were in there. She showed me the entry headcount book which shows the ADDITIONAL number every 15 mins. At open 257 straight in and every 15 between 75 and 125 extra. Now read this. I’m staying looonnnggg. https://dispatcheseurope.com/attention-costco-shoppers-aggressive-american-big-box-retailer-big-plans-europe/
it never fails..earnings will suck...something will happen..wall st. expects too much from costco...every other company gets great earnings their stock soars..costco will dive
For those waiting for a COST split: I have posted here and other places that splits are mostly history given the current commission structure (zero in many cases) and the additional admin cost for the company. Here's the potential answer: https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/17/the-latest-in-the-brokerage-wars-charles-schwab-will-allow-people-to-buy-fractions-of-stocks.html

"WHAT A WAY TO INCREASE SHAREHOLDER VALUE, RAISE EXPENSES VERSUS WALMART COMPETITIVE GROWTH. GENIUS. THEY HAVE A LOW MARGIN PROFITABILITY OF UNDER 3% AND THIS GENIUS CEO DECIDES TO INCREASE COSTS AND OVER HEAD EVEN FURTHER."
COSTCO IS NOT LIKE ZOOM OR OTHER COMPANIES
"Hey Costco, I see yahoo finance/Verizon, has given people 4 reasons not to renew their Costco membership.I believe its a planted story, esp given that earnings is out in about a month.WHy not let them know you feel about being targeted, and maybe suggest to your fellow wholesalers to drop their relationship with Verizon, and look for a telecom supplier that isn't doing hatchet jobs on companies, and isn't tryin to undo the tax cuts, and march to the agenda."
COST and CLX.... a winning combination
Not a rousing Rally. 150 still possible.
Missed opportunity to get in as price skyrockets. Investors want the special dividend!
"Nobody ever goes to Costco anymore, it's too crowded."
"Definitely looking to fall under $300, the $270-$280 is interesting to see if it holds."
"Like many of you, I've gotten so accustomed to Costco's soaring stock price, that the decrease over the past 2 days (-4.5%) has been concerning. So I wanted to pass along some info that should restore your confidence.First of all, bigger drops occurred in late Oct (-6.3%) and early Nov (-5.4%), but quickly recovered each time. There is no fundamental reason why it shouldn't do so again.Secondly, today's weakness was due to November's sales report (+13.4% comp) which slightly lagged Sep (+15.5%) and Oct (+14.4%). However, November still surpassed all other months in 2020 - and Aug YTD comp was only +8.4%. Since December's ER covers 1Q of FY21, it will be the best quarterly sales gain of any previous fiscal quarter.Finally, a quick review of financials shows Costco's FY20 margins (Gross Margin/Oper Inc/Pretax Inc) were about 10bp better than FY19 or FY18. With the highest-ever quarterly sales, plus improved margins, Costco will report their best earnings in history, by far!Oh, and I also noticed that Costco's increase in paid members has almost doubled in 2020 (+7.8%) from the 2 previous years (+4.5%)."
jim Cramer recommended this stock a few days ago..that's why it's not doing so good
"I can't believe how up and down this stock is, it was just 290, now 278 just like that very quickly"

here is your chance to get back in @ lower prices.Headed to 330.00-340.00
The best timing to load up more!Institutions are accumulating...COST is going to surge back!
FOR THOSE WHO THINK COSTCO IS SO *&^&%$ WONDERFUL LET ME CITE THAT THE PROFIT MARGINS ARE RAZOR THIN. NOT LIKE APPLE ETC. WE'RE TALKING 3 % AFTER EVERYTHING IS SAID AND DONE. SURE THERE'S YEARLY GROWTH BUT ITS MARGINAL. CUSTOMER BASE IS LOYAL. GRANTED. BUT AGAIN... PROFITS ARE MINISCULE. MARKET CAP IS 144 BILLION. 600 MILLION SHARES OUT THERE. NEED TO START BUYING BACK THE STOCK. THIS IS INSTITUTION OWNED. EASY TO MANIPULATE BY THE HEDGE FUNDS.
Another down day for the markets.
PROVE THIS STOCK IS RECESSION-PROOF
"unreal,,,costco has no value anymore,,,,,,,shorts win,,,damn it"
Stores are full. August sales should be above expectations
"MARGIN PROFIT IS BARELY 3 1/2 % NOT MUCH LEE WAY. TIME TO GUARD EXPENSES, NOT THIS COMPANY. THEY AVERAGE OVER $50,000 PER EMPLOYEE. PLUS BONUSES."

Buffett sold all Costco holdings.... better get out now!
With Sam's club closing...maybe this is an opportunity for Costco to pick up some locations CHEAP??
Been trading between 280 - 320 last few months.
What's wrong with the sales numbers. The stock should be up not down.
Out Of Control!

Why down!!!
"In my small Canadian town, we have a Costco and a Walmart. Costco is always super busy and Walmart is not. We have executive membership at Costco and we buy vertically everything from there. This is why I invested in Costco many years ago."
No one goes into Costco after 11am!
"Of course earnings are upThey are charging MORE for their products, duh.. Just like starbucks, charging more for a cup of coffee while icing cold drinks, duh."
Look for COST to offer Covid19 Vaccinations soon at their drugstores !!!!!!!!!!!!!!this will be a HUGE plus on top of the increased sales !
Buy on dips if you're not a day-trader.
"COST will bounce, wait for it."
seriously. great earnings and down about 20 dollars?..

"can you imagine if costco could be bought by anazon?...""if you have amazon prime..free admission to costco""..sales through the roof..costco would be huge!"
"I don’t understand why people would get excited with Special Dividends. It is just like paying yourselves and taking some money off the table. A stockholder is an owner. When Special Dividends are paid, it is just taking money from the business you own. This is not free money. The money is removed from the company. The net worth of the company would be reduced by the amount of the dividend distributed. Costco is a growth stock and buying it for dividends is a wrong move. Dividends are taxed as income and if a stock is held for more than a year, the gain would be taxed as Long Term Capital Gain. Long Term Capital Gain are taxed at a more favorable rate. Unless the stock is held in a tax-free account (IRA/401K), Special Dividends would increase the tax for most people."
its wayOVERSOLD................................
no company in the world can bet Costco's return policy. I watched a guy returned an old suitcase he bought 8 years ago and got full refund. beat that Amazon.
Costco would be a huge beneficiary of $2000 checks which look very likely after GA senate results.Republican senate was blocking it vehemently..
a good cost er report ..and rise is coming ...hold tight

"Today all the big boys take profit and run. It is probably just a day or two. i wait to buy under 300, because it can not go up everyday. At this price I really like to get in for Oct 2 , call 300"
I go to CC every other week and they still don’t have any Arrowhead Water - NO disinfectants for 6 weeks straight. Lines are just as long if not longer than before the crisis - this is a 150bn company.
Costco is undervalued. What Costco should do is put a competing bid in for whole foods. Costco is already number 1 in organic food sales. this would beef up their exposure and crush Amazon now. 18.5 billion is so doable for this company.
"Stephen, all points well taken, some of us hold stocks for 10 to 20 years and dollar cost in, If I could tell you how much money I've made on cost since my first purchase in 1995, well you wouldn't believe me. Costco is one of the best run companies out there and i can almost assure you if you bought some today, tomorrow, or next week in 2035 you will be a happy camper"
earnings is upon us. Analyst expectations went up a tad. I see some selling by nervous hands right now. but i'm willing to bet this quarter is going to be good. I'm holding.
perfect timing to take profits and exit. the fundamentals just dont justify the current price level of Costco!
"Hey Awesome, how did that short you placed yesterday work for ya.... idiot."
People don't trust Trump's regime and their lies.They are hoarding and Costco is the place to do it.
Shorts better cover soon.
costco makes most of the money from membership fees. the money i saved at their gas station along already pays the membership. long live costco.
Well i guess she should sit around $300 in this market correction

Holding through earnings! Good luck to everyone.

""We also believe it is probable the company declares a special dividend in the next one- to-two quarters.""Stifel rates Costco shares buy with a price target of $261.""Stepping back, Costco continues to take outsized share versus peers and most retailers and is a core long-term holding,"" wrote JPMorgan analysts. ""Moreover, we continue to believe a special dividend is coming ($18.5 per share in total cash on hand)."""

"just want to share some info that most of you may not get. first of, i am long term holder since later 90s, started shopping at jeriche LI branch and bought stock then, along with HD and AMZN, all vendors that i used a lot when starting to work. live in muttontown. anyway, to say i appreciate cost is an understatement. since moved to NJ, still shopping at its plainfield branch, love the new building and gas. anyway, cost opened its first ever branch in shanghai china the past weekend. in one week, 110,000 members signed up. the first day the traffic was so intense into the lot, took 3 hours, eventually, has to close early by police because too many people. famous liquor from china Maitai was cheaper than anywhere in china. trade war affecting chinese consumer behavior? frog that!all is well, rock on."

When is the special dividend being paid ?
Monday and friday..usually not good days for Cost stock
UBS’s Michael Lasser reiterated a Buy rating and $270 price target on the shares Friday.
COST will wash the Amazon stigma soon enough. AMZN won't hurt COST in the long run.

"My final message on special dividend directly from Fidelity Inv; Thank you for your email. If you hold the stock on November 30th, 2020 then you will secure the special dividend which I see will be paid on December 11th, 2020. If you purchase that stock on December 1st it will settle after the record date and will not get the dividend. Hope that helps clarify it."
Are you kidding me? It falls after good earnings
JUST GOT KEEP BAD BOY DOWN NEEDS STAY DOWN
"big boys selling, no one buying....I think thats going to tell you how this ER will be"
The dividend should be paid on 9/13 with a ex dividend date of 8/29. so the declare date is usually 14 to 15 days before the ex date. hope this helps everyone
buffet sold costco but where is the $$$ going?
I guess this is the definition of a bad day and an unforgiving market

All shoppers are going to COST to shop because they have created the only safe environment to shop.
under 300 in am
Anyone got the link to earning report for costco ?
One of the best run companies in the world!Just ask Charlie Munger
shocking the turn from yesterday to today in price. Seems any time a trade is going to be made by individual there needs to be a warning disclaimer BEWARE!
Stocks going to crash if they don't fix their delivery problem with overcharges.
Sonic electric toothbrush @ Costco $99.00. Amazon $169.00. Membership paid in full with 1 item. Costco rocks!
Wait for price to settle a bit before opening position. P/E seems to be on the high side compared to other retailers.
Slowly buying this dip. It’ll continue towards 400 after the selling ends
Possibly the best retailer on the planet
"SHORT HERE...over valued, over bought and a FOOD FIGHT with WMT coming!!!!!!!"
Dow up 600 $300 stock cannot even bounce $1
"Been loving Costco for 30+ years.Nothing changes here, move on."
Costco will smash this earnings report and definitely next earnings. look at the volume in Costco stores now everyone is scared of this corona virus
"Very bullish, the rumor mill says, a nice uptick in dividends!"
"Who is the lucky ones who bought COST at 192s. COST deserves to be 230 again, it will."
"Tomorrow there will be at least 5 articles about COST, 5 will be upgrades, 5 will be BUY THE DIP !"
"Our location in Phoenix, Az was/is out of essentials plus all.....yes, all rice and flour.Hmmmmm"
COSTCO HAS DROPPED 20 POINTS IN 2 WEEKS AND THEY RAISE THE MINIMUM TO $16 ???
wow they crushed the earningsI am so happy
Serious question. What is the last day to buy more to have the record date of dec2 so that i get the bonus!
$10 payout Dec 10 and earnings this will double. At least.
The best of times for COST was not good enough. Only down hill from here.
"Had 34 stocks. Juste bought 12 more in the dip. Go long for Cost, you'll be reward!!"
BUY the silly DIPS306.00-310.00

slowly becoming my worst stock
The best stock in this and next year
going sideways on a green day. this has been very disappointing holding since pre-ER
Costco 40% overvalued article in Jeff Millers weekly newsletter.
"In the past 3 months, Costco has sold more low margin stuff that people need in Corona times, so they have been hurt in 2 ways:1. High margin stuff is not on the shelves2. COVID related expenses have hurt the margins.Despite that revenues are up nicely!!!We should be good!"
I was stubborn..and should have listened...instead I sold
shorts gonna get BURNED............................
"Watching pre market trading going on at $265.51, who would have thought this beauty would be headed to $270 after hoping for $240 not long ago!Got to love it!"
"according to everyone on these liberal finance shows,,,AMZN beats everyone and Costco is finished,, I think Amzn willl flop tonight,,how much #$%$ can one buy,,,or be able to pay for,,,"
Hello all. I am.looking for some information here. I am looking too purchase shares of costco. I beleive they are a sid company and it is not hard too see they are too of their class in the industry. With this non stop upward chart would this be consodered an over valued zone.Any extra information would be great as. I am looking for solid quarterly growth as what I am putting in is considered long term savings. Thanks - first time investor into costco - Justin.
does this just tank more when the market starts going up?
lemme guess..buy the silly dips
356.00 me buyMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE
"I just shorted cost,,,, seems the stock is going no place and this is short covering,,,"
I haven’t been to Costco recently but went to Sam’s a few days ago. Gotta say it was so refreshing to see a good selection of chicken breasts at a reasonable price and steaks. The steak price was of course higher than usual but there was availability which I haven’t seen at the other grocery stores that aren’t membership ones. Plenty of foot traffic in the store.
"Common $270, next hurdle IMO $300.The way it's going doesn't seem to be a problem.Mighty thankfully to own a nice handfull of Cosco stock"
its a beat!
cant hold ......what a scam wall street MM play

Buy buy buy too cheap
"Costco (COST) remained unfazed by competition, reporting stellar sales and earnings growth in 2018. On average, Costco’s monthly comps have increased 9.2% in the first ten months of 2018—which is exceptional, given the heightened competition.We expect Costco to sustain its solid growth momentum in both sales and earnings in the coming quarters. Costco’s investment in pricing to widen its value gap with peers is likely to drive traffic and, in turn, comps. Meanwhile, expanded offerings and a high membership renewal rate should further support the comps growth rate."
earnings out at 5pm. ignore short trolls

Analysts were expecting a profit of $2.45 per share.Total revenue rose to $44.77 billion from $39.07, beating analysts' average estimate of $43.78 billion,"
"I don't trade Costco at all. Actually, given the environment, I've sold off everything except for CREE. It looks like you guys are about to break out. Been keeping my eye on Costco for a while and figured you were just in an accumulating phase. It looked like I was right when you started getting higher highs. I am probably buying in tomorrow. I expect a green volume jump very soon- just hope it's not tomorrow before I buy (if I buy)."
How you gonna even let this go under 345?????? lmfao let me guess tesla back to 500 first though.

Does anyone know if Costco has earnings report 5/28 before market opens or after close?

Keep buying ...numbers are great...shows you analyst are bad at predicting.
Went to Costco in Boston Hts Ohio on Saturday and it was a madhouse. I've never seen so many people there.
Don't you just love how Wall Street uses Cramer to pump a stock so they can dump it. Good old pump and DUMP.
Costco is HUGELY overpriced for their growth rate growing at 5% or 6% pe ratio is 27 if growth slows to 2% due to Amazon and Aldis and LIDL this stock will be back under 100 as it should be..
LMAO we are approaching under $300 rapidly what a stock to own

Back where I started with this stock 8 months ago...Ugh! Paying people more didn't help my position...
Costco will have tough time in coming months....This is exactly what I have said earlier in the year that Costco is relying too heavily on retail stores and not on e-commerce...though with continued pandemic more users are moving away from Costco to Amazon and Walmart...Both Amazon and Walmart have tremendous online channels and super fast delivery....Costco has lot of catch up do and the Q1 2020 uptick in sales may not last...hope for the best for it;s investor...but be cautious...https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/01/why-costco-could-be-a-loser-in-the-e-commerce-boom.aspx

Just OWN itDont Trade it !
Good numbers I wonder why it’s falling. Is it the covid costs to keep store operating?
"No of covid cases in europe: 5000, European stocks=-0.7%No of cases in usa: 100,American stocks=-5000%"
"The quarterly dividend is payable November 15, 2019, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 1, 2019."
Banda's post is spot on! Super beat coming soon!
This stock is as dead as this board.
The covid gravey train is over.
"When I can buy gas, prescription drugs, have my tires changed, eyeglasses, cheap gift cards and get photos printed and ink cartridges refilled for cheap at the local Whole Foods store, then I will sell my COST stock and get a Prime membership. Until that happens, Amazon with Whole Foods will not put the slightest dent in COST business and member #'s."
"Like I said, resistance was at 189. It hit 189 and bounced. Watch out what happens if it gets to 202. If it clears 202, that’s a bullish signal. If not, then it will likely head down to 173"
I am glad I sold my costco. shares and got ARKK. :)
I have been at costco 1 time before the pandemic and I came away thinking those folks were in a frenzy and it was so busy I could hardly get through.
Almost every time it ranks like that it ends up opening in the positive

"What I find most interesting is the ignorance from many people about having to ""pay"" for a membership to shop at Costco, and how they simply refuse to do so. Well, I would like to inform all of these ignorant people that between my Executive membership and using my Citi Visa card, Costco and Citi combined have been paying me anywhere from $500 to $1000 each year with rebate checks. They pay me to shop. I use my Citi Visa for purchases that i have the money for. Gas is a 4% rebate at Costco gas or any major gas station and 2% rebate on Costco purchases. The Citi card has other perks as well 3% on travel and eating out, 1% on everything else and also extends warranties on T.V. 'S and other electronics. I pay my cars off each month because my monthly shopping is part of my budget. THIS IS A NO-BRAINER WAY TO SHOP AND SAVE !!!!"
Anyone seen Jim Cramer lately? He doesn't look well.
Almost everyone here got it wrong. Own it
"Seems like a slow and steady stock... not appropriate for my trading style, but it's a solid company!"
well actually 2 bil dollar miss on revs. no wonder the selloff
"Yes, COST is good. But statisfically in 5% upper percentile area. No big earnings surprise, and I think extra dividend is later.I recommend selling. I already did!"
"Costco already only allows 2 shoppers per membership in my area, and the aisles are wide and accommodating. I feel comfortable there. They should sell masks though, as a way to encourage use and get people into the stores."
"Pretty steady for such a horrible miss. They are waiting for conference call. If CAT can go for the same price of 8 months ago even though they have 20% less revenue and 40% less profits with o guideline, Costco may be able to be green tomorrow if the CEO uses the magic words. In this market where people pay 2019 for 2013 revenue all you have to say are the words reopening and vaccine. That's it. The CEO needs to say we are seeing great numbers with the reopening and that the vaccine will take them to the moon."
"funny longs on this site. had you sold on October 22nd 2015 you've made killing ! since then - break even? got it? did you read news about Visa's inability to serve?

"COSTCO is an elitist store. Looks at: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/insights/061516/whats-average-costco-consumer-cost.asp They will be the choice for future COSTCO stores (just go to a Walmart and see huge numbers of almost derelict customers). No offense intended! But where will anyone shop and get an electric car charged (not now, but soon). Who do wealthy customers want there kids to see? COSTCO represents the upscale America."

There are alots of hype in Amzn. Go Costco.Buy Costco, can,t go wrong.If you like my post give me a thumbs up, also I like to see some comments.Thanks."
Would COST benefit by buying ZI?
Internal weakness controls ? What does that mean ?
"Thursday morning monthly sales will come out, I have no doubt that the number will be good. For short term I guess COST should rebound back to 170, because I don't think WFM can do any harm to COST."

Costco opening first location in China next year and e-commerce sales almost doubling YOY. Decent membership fee increase now hitting bottom line. Buy

Guessing this new money is chasing the supposedly special dividend. Would rather see Costco reinvest the money in new store openings and/or maybe just raise the regular dividend.
"What should I buy COSTCO, FB or APPLE at this price?"
"funny went in to whole foods today, first time since amazon purchase. i asked a guy working there what big changes have occurred. He thought for a moment and then said bananas are .69 vs .99 cents.

Grocery is a tough biz,"
good numbers! will be green in few hours
I’d rather be invested in a company that cares about there employees. But I guess I’m just built different. Stock go up and down. These people worked everyday as did I. Yet I make a lot more $ then them. They deserved a raise!

Thank you! Time to build large
In $297! Hope it hits $305 in a week!
The Bk death rage of this gigantic beast has just started.
Will earnings be before or after market on Thursday?
$400 by end of October.
I have been Costco member for 15 years and recently also took Sam's Club membership. I am seeing some of the prices way cheaper than Costco's. Sometimes I feel Costco may be more of a hype as I myself never looked anywhere else and blindly went with what they sell at their stores. Time to switch and cut the cord!
Really hoping Cost penetrates deep into the China market. A lot of room for growth.
$350. As I said Hairbag or Emptybag!
"What will guidance be? Thats ALL that matters in this sham market...not what you actually do, rather what you say you will do next, lol! What a joke!"
"Look at Costco sell off on no news, it means investors holds big chunks of money in the stock, and it has been down for nearly 2 weeks. they rather take a loss and move on to other hot stocks in EV sector to recoup some loss from Costco. Costco should announce stock 4-1 stock split to lift the stock price up and prevent it's slipping further down."
I sold all my costco and bought nano dimension

Special dividend time soon.
"People, do not expect a surge in the markets any time soon. If you do, you're only fooling yourself. If you want to be 'smart', really smart, you will use this time to increase your position in this particular company. Right now, dollar-cost-averaging is king. You will be glad you did because eventually, normalcy will return... just not any time soon.Be smart."
330 tomorrow.
"20 day moving average is ~$234, COST should not move away from this level too far. It may bouncing around $235 for a few days."
"I guess it right, no matter how good COST is, earnings top estimate, growth is also top estimate, but they keep AMZN in the future. I will wait for COST to come down 150 again. I think COST should think about the split, so the price does not look expensive. 3-1 is a good one, raise the dividends is another way. i will not touch COST until I HEAR COST SAY SPLIT."

"Millennials were never the majority of shoppers at CostCo, it's been mainly families that need to buy in bulk to feed and cloth their kids. Go look at the lines at a local CostCo and you'll understand what I'm talking about. I see many new immigrant parents with families consisting of 3-5 children, sometimes they're shopping with the grandparents also. Anyone who thinks they're relying on millennials is way off base on this companies strategy going forward, enough said.. do your own dd.. ;)"
It has gone down ever since the special dividend came
"Check out the videos of today’s Costco opening in Shanghai! Chaos...five mile traffic jam, schools closed. Only opened 5 hours before security shut the place down due to traffic /safety concerns! Go Coastco"

I don’t see why people are overreacting we are literally at the same support 338 we bounced off at 10:30am. We are at 338 in AH It can easily go back to the 340-345 levels we been treading all week.
I told all you guys this would go down after er
CRAMER and BUFFET say COST is considered CHEAP here.
"Online shopping was up a Whopping 30% from Thanksgiving thru Cyber Monday. 30%!!! This makes me think, 'how was COST's online sales? Will we see the full effect of the shopping season create an eyepopping number come Jan 4?' I foresee a beautiful run up this month followed by a spike, then some breathing in the stock in Jan. Thoroughly enjoying my long term options position. Also have a short term that Im looking to exit on the next small run. IMO, the next 3 weeks will be a nice solid rise."
down in the AH...will this keep rolling tomorrow?
Welllll Costco was up in after hours 1.5%. Now even. Guess a lot of folks didn’t like the results. Think this is the norm in the future for a lot of stocks
might end up red the way its dropping
We are looking at a Cost 2-1 split on next earring report with stock hitting $185 plus.
Analysts say Walmart is interested in buying Costco at $90/sh.
Loving the lift. Go Costco!
sold 246.40
Could we see a new 52 week high before the end of this year ??????Any thoughts !!!!!!!!
No worries! $375 in no time! $$$$
people still think robinhood affect stocks and not institutions(which iwn 80% of all shares of everythinf)
this is so disappointing..  and this disappointment is expensive 
they are accrediting much of profit on membership fees
Keep hearing that there are big cost over runs on the broiler project in Nebraska which Costo is currently building. Seems like this may put the cost of chicken at a price disadvantage versus their competition. Has anyone else heard of this?
"There shouldn't be anyone here trading this stock - you put this one in an IRA or a 401(k) and forget about it while continuing to buy on a normal schedule. Stop looking at the daily movements. Investments are not day-to-day, they're year-to-year. Balance your portfolio at the end of the calendar year and make your changes (if required). Otherwise, just sit back and let it make $$$ for you."
Cramer says It’s BUY the NEWS.............
"Well now, COST needed to plunge in the opening hour yesterday then has steadily risen since. Consistent and methodical rise. Apparently Mr. Market likes COST. All the whining about COST being a .......'whatever'... Is ridiculous. Its been nothing but a beautiful investment with predictable management and a solid business model. China hasn't even opened up to speak of. Neither has any Asian country for that matter. China alone could double COST footprint. Easily. This has to be one of the most consistent value plays ever. Nit the Only, but in the Gold standard column for sure. A sound retirement investment."
Costco dead after morning rush. Traffic must be down significantly!
"Tesla is worth 4 costcos. Both have parking lots full of cars, but that only benefits one of them."
Costco's drop is linked to the friction with China and the political posturing associated with that. That will be resolved in short order and this stock will rebound above the 20ma of 344.70 and then up to the pt's that were announced recently.
"well clearly 300$ is too much and is a tough barrier mentally for now, if it hits 300 again and drops I short for a scalp."
"For those that say COST is an ""expensive"" stock, keep in mind that it trades at a price/sales ratio of .5 and has NO DEBT, in fact it has a net cash position and generates tons of free cash flow. This is why they were able to pay the $7 special dividend this quarter in addition to the regular dividend of $2. They will continue to pay the special dividend every year, and will likely increase the amount giving the stock a dividend yield of 5.5%, which is the highest among retailers."
"looks like when you drop $8 in day and a company is a powerhouse it tells you it was weak at 155-160 level,,wait for 145,"
what happened?
It’s a day to go harass your local Costco employee. I’m gonna cause chaos at the store today!
Costco doesn't want to be above $300 for long.
Costco's Earnings First Read: Staying The Course $COST https://seekingalpha.com/article/4294961
No special dividend? :/
I guess we have to see what it going to happen Monday.
Hedge funds are dumping COST and going into beaten down stocks where their money will triple in 3 months.
Wait for Costco’s earnings on May 28th. I am holding until then. We will be rewarded from their revenue boost !!!
"Normal nervousness before the quarterly report due on 28th.Everyone, including Walmart, Home depot, target, has reported solid numbers.Costco will do even better, a great time to buy a bunch!!"
"this is all computer trading,,,,no reason for the value anymore"
Up today
down it goes fast
"my biggest blunder in the stock market was selling my john deere stock at the beginning of the pandemic, and buying costco..although Costco was doing well during the pandemic, john deere has doubled, costco shrunk from 393 dollars my dilemma was not getting out of this, I dint see me here much longer"
going red again soon

Aight guys we eating Steak or noddles tonight?
COST is the best company in America if not the world.
"AND ANOTHER ANALYST RAISES PTCostco Stock Rises as Sales Show Retail Dominance, Analyst Says -- Barrons.comCostco Wholesale (COST) announced better-than-expected same-store sales for the month of August, sending shares up 2.1%.Same-store-sales climbed 5.5%, beating Wall Street's consensus estimate for 3% growth. Traffic growth was 4.8% worldwide and 4.9% in the U.S. The company recently opened its first store in China, which is seen as another area where Costsco can expand. Shares were at $303.37 at 12:21 p.m. on Friday.Here's what Wall Street had to say about Costco's prospects.Cowen's Oliver Chen wrote in a note Thursday that Costco ""continues to show its retail dominance as physical and digital momentum was again on display.""He said he was encouraged by the company's ability to ""demonstrate executional excellence in an increasingly difficult operating environment.""He noted digital momentum as comparable sales grew by 23.9% in August, though the company can continue to improve things like search, check-out, returns, and work toward faster and more reliable shipping times and tracking.Costco also is in ""a relatively better position to handle dislocation from rising tariffs and will be better able to maintain relevancy with shoppers,"" he added.He has an Outperform rating with a $325 price target"
hopefully see 230 b4 drop dwn
"When I see these high frequency computer trades of 300K-400K shares dropping the share price down $5-$6 in literally 2 seconds, in my mind a big up move is not far off."

Wait for 350's before buying more.....................
I got this at $339. It will easily be in the low 340's at least today. The volatility was + or - 3%. Cost hit that on the minus side so now it easily goes up from here. It's all about growth!!
"Good , now I can get back in"
uggh..as soon as I sell
"How can you not invest in this stock before earnings? Special dividend is coming, wait and see."
COST will be the first to recover here....shorts better cover.
Just love the MANIPULATION on COST................................Glad I raised some $$$ able to get Bargain prices.
"what do you guys think..costco is expensive stock..might go up $70-80 a year if things are really good like in the pandemic..but leaning towards Walmart and target, just because I can acquire a lot more shares I can get 1000 shares of each of them, but only 1000 shares of costco, but those stocks might be close to tapping out? whadda you think"
"For anyone who can't read or like to fabricate, Costco beat the street by 4 cents for what it's worth. LOLBy the way, Dollar General SMASHED the street this morning and is getting punished as stocks do at times.Costco (ticker: COST) said it earned $1.89 a share on revenue of $37.3 billion. Analysts had been predicting earnings per share of $1.85 on revenue of $36.55 billion."
When will we have the numbers for monthly sales?
Any news yet
Any words on official special dividend
I make more on unemployment than I did by having a job. For real! I’m going to feed off that cash cow for as long as I can.
thinking of buying back in...d@mmit sold at 310
perfect time to buy. been watching Costco for awhile and biggest dip it has had is like 1 to 2 bucks and it recovers quick and goes green. also earnings is coming up. this should recover nicely.
COST target price is listed at $400 on yahoo finance based on the average estimate of 26 professional analysts. I would go by that before I went by an estimate by anyone on this message board!
"People be so mad, meanwhile, I’m shopping and buying COST stock."
"After two days, shorts will cover it @$400 :)"
Up she goes

"Costco raising the minimum wage to $16.00 is a very smart move. This move really does not impact the business model or earnings. First, this affects only a portion of the employees that is at the low end of the wage scale. The additional cost of wages would be easily absorbed by an adjustment of prices of goods. Even if there is a raise of prices on merchandise, Costco would still be having the cheapest prices around. I doubt customers would even notice or mind. I noticed that prices of some items do fluctuate up and down anyway. As long as I know Costco offers a Good if not the Best prices, I would keep going to shop there.The Benefits of this raise in wages are many. First, Costco got some free advertising. Costco employees are among the most helping and friendly. Local Governments all love Costco as it pulls in a lot of sale taxes. This helps when Costco wants to expand. Local Governments would band backwards to accommodate new Costco Stores to be opened in their areas. For Costco to grow and expand, a good reputation count is important. That is why, I considered that this is a smart move."
"If there’s one company that warrants the dealmaker’s attention, it may be Costco Wholesale Corp., a retailer in which Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. already owns a stake.- Bloomberg"
Cramer says COST is way OVERDONE......................its a BBBBUUUUUYYYYY here.
"I think I'm on the verge of selling out this stock is stuck in reverse..it had a couple nice days, but doesn't make up for the horrible ones...the dividend id good but thats about it. I can get that at wmt too"
Huge upside for $NR. Worth a check
It’s hanging on $338 for over 2 hours now. At least it did not continue to drop. Solid at $338 . In no time it will turn back to 350
Costco is dead now
If someone researches it . I can’t find it but it was either last earnings or the one before it did exact same thing a pretty good next day drop. I could be wrong but that’s the way I remember it
the greatest companies in the world treat their people better than their revenues
"If there is any stock in this market that will absolutely nuke next quarters earnings, it will be Costco. 100% convinced."
if costco cant turn prifits..no one can
LOAD THE FREAKING BOAT
It went through the 300 mark like butter.Perhaps a 3 for 1 split is coming and a nice payout?
It will close $385.
So why the huge drop after hours?
"By the end of today, COST should cross 374."
40 to 200 in ten years! And there is a lot more to come. Loop Capital joined ranks today with a new buy and a 224 target. It makes my morning when guys come here and talk about their short position.
if you put your stimmy check in here..hedge funds took it
"Special dividends were paid 2/05/15 ($5) stock was $147 a share, 5/08/17 ($7) stock was"
hard to imagine just a couple months ago this was booming at unbelievable amounts anywhere from $5-$20...the hottest stock on the planet...now look at it..will never have another $20 run..and now the worst stock on the planet
Betting on Costco at this point is pretty much a guarantee. The news is only hyping it up even more.
management is spending too much time working on covid-19 rather than managing the business until the stores are enjoyable again it will be flat at best. sold my shares over a month ago and have no plans to repurchase.
Where’s all the negative posts now lol. Boom green
Idiots in Costco shopping with masks on. If you are that paranoid why would you come In to a place with wall to wall shoppers?
Costco is a buy and hold. Not a trading stock. See you at 400
All targets have been RAISED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!a steal under 300.00

"this stock is weak,,what are you all happy about,,, the 52 week area was 181,,its at 157- 158 area,,nothing to be happy about if you bought at the high so where is the big strength"
Can you imagine if we had a real emergency like nuclear war. This virus is absolutely nothing but fear.
"Why did it drop 2 points in 5 mins, anyone?"
companies that take care of employee do command respect..
Trump and Powell will SINK the global markets into RECESSION
if i sell today i will get the dividend right? Does anyone know for sure?
It's a disaster. Missed estimates plus a lawsuit.
"After the initial rush, Costco is eventually one of the biggest loser among all this as online sales are surging and Costco does not have the scale and warehousing/DC efficiencies that Walmart and Amazon posses..Costco is toooo old school, they don't have tech such as Robotics, IOT, Hydrogen fuel cells, AI in their warehouse/DC chains to make online sales efficient and fast...Retail stores will not cut it and they stand to lose a lot of their customers who will be converted to online sales forever after recent experiences..."
"What a disaster, over the course of a year, it did nothing. So much for costco, it's a bum stock now."
Going green quick shorts are going to be hurting badly very soon
"no reason at all for this to dump today, pure #$%$.sold all of my 2500 shares and rolled it into tesla.."
"As far as for my book, it is a great earning report. I am buying more after hour.Waited fir this discount sale for a while.People, please read carefully- Earnings: expected $1.61 per share, actual $1.73 per share! Beat !!!!Revenue: expected 34.6 bil, actual 34.31 bil (0.8% difference, almost round error)."
makes no sense to be a long term investor in this anymore....70 cent dividend is all it can offer
Look for the SILLY dips as anotherBUY opportunity!nothing has changed with COST.
blowout earnings and higher guidance tomorrow ez money!
"Hey yall hope u guys/gals r doing alright... watching the kids tonight as wife is working overnight shift at the hospital so I'm stuck at home... I'm 49 but have a lot of millineals friends (Drs, RNs, respiratory therapists for example) that invest in Costco and shop in Costco... I know we make fun of the millineals sometimes (but I do it in front of their face as I'm friends with ten) but they really r into savings and investments... we make fun of their lack of knowledge but how much knowledge about trading/investing did we have at that age? Like I said I'm 48..."
with incredible earnings why did it go down
"Great company, good stock considering the circumstances. This is an investment, not a trade. Hold it."
costco like a really old man..cant keep it up
delayed earnings is normally a missed earning and/or low guidance. Believe it!
"Peter Lynch:""Stocks aren't lottery tickets. Behind every stock is a company. If the company does well, over time the stocks do well, and vice versa. You have to look at the company—that's what you research.""Sooner or later we'll get there!"
choo choo
I sold @ $310..now its moving
Man those people who work at Costco are stupid. The cashiers are brain dead drones and the cart pushers outside are utter morons. They have legions of idiots working for them for a paltry $14 an hr. That is why I am an investor.
"BURN shorts BURN ...........................to you COST always bounces back, this is just the beginning here."
Why is Costco down?
"Costco is a healthy, pandemic-proof business! They grow earnings year after year, and will continue to do so. This is a good time to buy more."
"Great sales number just came out, no reason for a sell-off that is happening today."
"""Wall Street drills Costco stock because it's paying workers $2 more an hour during COVID-19"" Really?...."

the whole market is over valued now... small trigger will bring it down 5-10% in a few days... Be very careful here...
"None of this past week matters, games or what ever, who cares who was behind it, I don't. Come earnings beginning of Oct..... it will flying back above $300 again. Not a concern in the world!!"
Looking pretty cheap. Buy

The most frustrating stock on my portfolio right now...this needs to be at $400 right now
"Well, I give it a buy rating. Based upon Int'l growth in China, due to the fact there was lines around the building on opening day in Singapore. Also based on the fact I have trouble finding a good spot in the parking lot, whether it's a week day or weekend."
"Has anyone ever had food shipped? Not all products show up nicely packed, only light items ship well."
Road to $250 Continues.
"Stock should be up $5 not down $1.2, it just goes to show how phony this market is."
"Watch.. Stock is going to go up days before earnings, they'll have a good earnings report and everyone's going to sell right after... At least that's what I'm thinking, then I'll load up... I've been burned too many times buying before a earnings call."

NEW REPORTS INDICATE CUSTOMER LOYALTY IS 102% THAT MEANS SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY PAY TWICE FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING MEMBERS. REVENUE WAS 14 BILLION LAST QUARTER BUT THEY EXPECT TO TOP 108 BILLION NEXT MONTH WHEN THE ILLEGALS FLOOD THE COUNTRY. SHOPPING AT COSTCO IS SUCH A JOY. I'M TAKING MY VACATION AND SPENDING IT THERE IN THE PARKING LOT BECAUSE ITS SUCH A GREAT EXPERIENCE. EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION IS 108 % THAT MEANS THEY'LL NEEVR LEAVE AND HAVE IT IN THE WILL TO BE BURIED IN AISLE 6 NEXT TO TIRES AND DELI SECTION. YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE TAG ON THIS. THATS WHY THE STOCK IS DROPPING. NO ONE ELSE CAN EITHER.
Crushed it

Selling at the news ?
"bend over. in 5-10 years, AMZN will put COST out of business. Everything COST offers you will get delivered to your doorstep in an hour by AMZN. Cheaper too."
Costco should go back to 365 by end of next week.
Special dividend in August
It’s going up this Time
"COST rev +14.7%. Incredible for a company of that size, COST ecommerce sales +75.8%. Beastly! AH's pushing upward"
"COST roars. $400 by year end.We expect Costco’s peers to benefit from expanding fulfillment options. However, Costco could continue to outperform its peers with its comps growth rate in the coming quarters. The company’s high membership renewal rates indicate strength in its business. Costco’s value pricing and expanded assortments will likely continue to drive its traffic."
"Purchased COST about 8 years ago @ 40.00.Got special Div. of 7.00 and 5.00 plus the stock closed @ 188.82 today.My thoughts are that 8 YEARS FROM NOW, this stock could go to 300.00 per share.Am in for another ride up, up, up......GLT all....."
Will open down after earnings report. EPS was adjusted. Didn't beat. EPS was in line and in this market a stock is punished unless it exceeds . Should open down 3-5 points.
Target dropping hard on mixed performance. Costco is next.
"Amazon thrives = Costco dies think Macy's, Kroger, Sears and all big box"
I believe the other Costco’s customers think like me. We buy anything from someone else when Costco doesn’t have it.
TRUMP TARD and POWELL is a perfect combination for RECESSION
The govt cannot track down every individual that has the virus because it takes a lot of time and money so it will definitely spread throughout the US.
Costco needs to change the air flow in each building pull the air up not blow it down. This would put filtered air where people are and filter the air around them. It would be good PR also.
Chinese smarter than Trump-again
"They won’t have the Thanksgiving and Christmas shopping numbers they normally would, so this will play on their earnings. Will be good but not stellar. Probably see it drop 5-7%￼"
Cramer says COST a BBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUYYYYYYYY here.
The gyration in the price has multiplied by 5 times on a weekly basis. It is one of the few retail stocks not taken out behind the woodshed and been slashed in half. The short interest on this stock is only 1.5% of float. Nothing to help it go up so if it doesn't hold around 220 watch out below. With this ah action I would say the chances are good this one will go the way of the others and drop 20 - 30 % within the next 2 months or so. I was actually hoping for a pop on good earnings in the morning and go short for the trip down mid morning or so. It could still happen BUT not likely now.
324.00 next resistance.
"the company really needs to look at buying back shares, hedge funds and shorts have destroyed this, once a beautiful solid stock to be a part of..now just liquid manure"
Beat on both earnings and revenue. Should be good day tomorrow
mOST STOCKS IN THE xlp (WHICH cost) IS IN ARE AT THEIR LOWS NOW....THIS IS GOING down!!! AT A 33pe....IS WILL GET CRUSHED AND will TEST THE 50 DAY AVERAGE AT SOME POINT...always does!!!!!!
Jeff Bezos is laughing about Costco stock falling and the next thing he will announce will be used cars with no haggle. He is already doing that in Europe.
I got in at 389...now its the bottom to load back
Costco has been selling off because the billionaires are going to step in whrn the 4th of March happens then 400 will HAPPEN!
Panic setting in among the share holders.
choo choooo tran! I mean train!
"Just back from Costco. Holy Traffic Jam, Batman! The lot is full and an aux. lot is full. Every register humming. Gas lines six deep waiting. No wonder the stock is ripping. Big upgrade from Citi today. Very important, but I wonder where the analyst was 15 point lower on the dip. New high coming."
The shopping experience is uncomfortable and everyone is required to mask up. Even 5 percent declines will hurt.
I hope their monthly sales figures tomorrow will be good.
blowout earnings next week! they will hit it out of the ballpark.
COST takes it to the chin today. I think it is no respect at all for the stock. Big chunk of the call Dec 16 makes me nervous why not Dec 9.
"will benefit from CVID-19 fiasco big time.Not a news I like, but a fact!"
Still can’t believe I dumped all my shares at $290 when the pandemic started rolling.. I’m an idiot. Feel free to tar and feather.
COST & AAPL just buy and hold here.............................
Costco chairman Tony James says no plans to split stock.
Punk faces thinking the stock may drop. no wonder ur poor
Bonehead OPP downgraded COST but upped the price to 300. Why investors still listen to this bonehead.
bad report not good

can anyone explain this? 15.5B in a month..and the stock falls? what kind of expectation is needed on wall st?
Hairbag. I am here to make money.
short into earns; priced for perfection. under 300 AH
RED even day like today... Do something COSTCO !!
Selloff accelerating. What is the bad news in the CC? Unable to listen to it live
"let's push thru that 52-week high...come on ""preppers""!! i'm a prepper, you're a prepper, wouldn't ya like to be a prepper too!"
Most overvalued retail stock. Should be trading at a PE of not more than 18. I'll be a buyer at around 100
Recollect Costco was run by an elderly Sr citizen as CEO. Doesn't look like any more. Called them & found out they have reserved JUST TWO hrs per week for elderly to go there & shop. Tuesdays & Thursdays from 8 - 9.00 Am! Very thoughtful & Considerate? JUST DISGUSTING!
"I think COST's fair value should be around $135. I come up with this number based on comparing both forward P/E of WMT versus COST. COST is 23.92 and WMT is 16.6. Therefore, based on this matrix COST should be around $135*16.6/23.92=$106.16. However, COST has a better profitability than WMT. Therefore, a premium should be paid for the stock based on its profitability advantage which can be calculated from Return of Equity (ttm). COST's ROE is 23.41% while that for WMT is 18.49% which means COST is about 26.6% better based on profitability. Therefore, COST price with profitability premium should be $"
Amazing buying op. If you can't see it better stick with mutual funds.
COST is better than AMZN. It gets no respect.
"Hey guys, in your experience , when a stock pays out a special dividend like this, you need to own it at close dec 2 to qualify, do you typically see a big sell off the next day of people who held just for the dividend? I have 50 shares in 368. My fear is there could be a mass sell off where I’ll be down on this stock after dividend"
"Amzn + whole foods = winning formula? Somehow I feel it is delusional. Sure Amazon killed a lot of businesses in the past but not everyone. One of them is Best Buy. Especially Amazon is now charging sales tax, and now Best buy can match Amazon's price. So Amazon lost advantage totally there. On whole foods side, it is well-known its price is ridiculous high. In the meantime everybody else are introducing organic foods --- costco, walmart and sams club to name a few. So in a way whole foods is already circumvented by these companies . Don't see how Amazon can change that."
rise rise rise rise rise rise rise rise
Needs to drop another 75-100 points before reaching fair value.
"Incredible business, but no retailer is worth 35 times fwd earnings. Those saying 400 by year end will likely have to go through a pullback before COST gets there..."
"I am just baffled by some of the posts. Quite a few complimented Costco stock does not move or hardly moved. However, does anyone read that Costco stock has a Beta (5Y Monthly) of 0.92? The Beta is lower than the average. It is supposed to be stable. Costco has held up well despite that the DOW30 jumping up and down. Being long on Costco stock means you hold on to the stock preferably more than one year. This way, you would not be hit by short term gain. Almost 72% of the stocks are held by institutions. It is even held by Berkshire Hathaway. If you are looking for a quick gain, look somewhere else. Look for a high Beta Stock not Costco."
Was there a downgrade?
IMO its a beat on eps and in-line on revs. comp sales were awesome but I'm also reading domestic growth very good but some weakness in international sales. again jmo as the reports coming out are very very mixed and confusing. seeing it pop up a bit now as we close in on the cc. Best not to get suckered by the short sellers I guess.
"Well there you have it, Costco just surpassed Disney as the ""Happiest Place on Earth""."
Last chance to buy in. $300 tomorrow morning.
GAMES being played to drive this down..... But it won't stay there
Don't forget the employee 401k most buy Costco sto k each pay period.
"Glad I sold yesterday. It's usually ""sell on the news"". I'll buy back when I can. I got damned lucky.It'll be back over 160 in no time.LD"
"This ""Amazon Effect"" is so over blown... correct me if I am wrong but they said the same thing about Best Buy a couple years ago.... yet they are near all time highs... This is just the next bs story that the sheep buy into. Do you really think that these multi billion dollar companies are going to disappear in a few years? As many people have eluded below, the lines for Costco are at all time highs, they beat earnings, they have a niche only Sam's club competes with.... and most important the people that shop at Costco are loyal and like that store out of all the other options out there, Amazon is not some god that is going to come in and clean everyone out, eventually the government will limit what sectors and businesses they own to prevent monopolies. Use common sense people, dont be a sheep like how much of this country has become."
how low do you think we go after earnings im thinking at this rate we see sub 300 tbh
tom..quit pumping this stock
oh no..Mr. Bill
This hasn't collapsed in 20 years
"As of today the 6 month & 1 year return is over 22%. Can't complain about that. At some point in 2021, Cost will surpass well above $400."
"A stock like GME rallying to the moon while a stock like COST sells off. Common sense has gone out the window. Anyone with a brain is buying this dip in COST. COST and GME are true opposites...COST has a solid business model, a competitive advantage, and extremely bright prospects. Vs. GME which has an obsolete business model, and a dim future. Which would you rather own for the long haul? Bottomline, the bubble in the GMEs of the world will burst and those names will come falling back to earth. Once that happens, COST will rally and take out 400. Jump in here with both feet."
The street is looking post virus in which shoppers back to their normal shopping behaviors and stock is too expensive.I don't buy it and see earning beating street expectations on May 28.
"First of all, a split? Why.Second, seems like over reaction to 1 store opening in Shanghai . How many China stores does Costco plan to open there? I’m a buyer back at $160, but it took them over 5 years to open a planned store here just north of Charlotte."
Thanks for my BUY order @ 303.00 today.
Was hoping it keeps dropping so i can add more
"COST stock has been very good to me for the last 7 or 8 years.Purchased the stock @ 40.00 and got a special Div. of 7.00 & 5.00.....For long term investing, my thoughts are 300.00 in 8 years.Trading is not for me, just buy and HOLD....."
"Will jump back in when it’s about $180. Still not a bargain. If you want 10% in short-term, jump in now. Wait is the only way to make money."
I say bravo to Costco. Everyone wear a mask ! You dont like it you don't shop here. Period..This is not about personal freedom or civil rights. It's not about politics. It's about public Health.
Will be green by 10 PM ET.
"Up 10C AH, It's running!!!!!!!"
"It's days like today with the Nas going down and Costco going up that keep reminding me how much ""I LOVE MY COSTCO SHARES""!OH, and my DG shares!"
Dump it from this peak!
"Unbelievable, I got COST Oct 04, call 300 so cheap. I bet that COST will beat the estimate again."
"COST is too cheap at this price, you will not see COST at this price on Oct 3rd."
waiting for pullback into 190s
dividend goes into effect dec. 2..people are gunna buy like crazy until the
costco is safe stock best place to buy your food and other consumer goods
"COST successfully maintained earnings through the pandemic, and they will continue to have excellent earnings ahead. The world's Covid recovery will present Costco with more business opportunity. It's a leader."
Why is Costco always trending during the weekend?
COST is the best retailer in the world. If you don't agree go to Sams or BJ's.
BUYER on the SILLY DIPS.................................what does COST have to do with TRADE WARS ???????nothing !
"Have liked COST for a long time. Sold COST around $360+ is because the stock market overall is over heated and COST carries one of the highest PE among retailers, also relative to its historical PE values. Will probably buy back some of the shares once the PE drops to between 25 to 28. Also wait for the overall market reversal from the recent routs. Good luck longs."
"With a PE over 30 for a glorified grocery store, no thanks."
This just makes no sense..
Went to COST today and only one check out was open and no one was waiting.
Deep down we all known how sustainable Costco is. Having China in the picture just points to exponential growth.
"Costco like Walmart, Target, and others will blow past the numbers.Post earning we should see it cross 220 easily."
"Within 10 days it will be at another all time high, it just happens every time there is a dip on earnings!"
Buying on weakness.......................................let the manipulation begin!
"My friend works for Costco. He says that Costco is a solid company that has a lot of upside. I am a sizable shareholder and love this company. The Y to Y percentage increases are fantastic. I predict a special dividend in September, start of FY 2019. The last 2 were $7 a share."
Obesity in America is caused by Costco. Massive packages of food that people struggle to eat before it is rancid.
Take advantage of the Garden variety SELL OFF.................COST a buy here........................
will go up $14 on Monday
Do the numbers include online sales?
This opens green tomorrow and with market up this will go up
Will beat ER
Sheep are selling first & ask questions later.
"This is a still a good buy, COST will do much better in 4Q due to holiday sales. Don't ever miss your chance this month. We'll see at $160+ by Jan 2017...Bet ya!!!!"
Where my 10 dollar special divident.
stock is going to $250. sit tight
Last chance to sell before $250
This thing moves like molasses

"Come to Japan Costco is always so packed Every single day , it’s hard to enter cause there is a long queue"
Looking to add to my current (small) position; best to wait or buy now? My first and only purchase was back in 2018. :)
COST is way ahead of the Virus game !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!great for investors !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! buying here on any silly weakness.
i think monday sep sale report will be out and it is going to positive .. easy 300+
Ughhhh what a bad day. Gonna go get my taint waxed and see if I can convince the girl to give me a happy ending.
"I tried telling everyone here a LONG TIME AGO that everything under Donald Trump is 'artificial' and that means this market has been artificially inflated now for 3 years! There was never anything of substance underneath to prop it up. So, now we see 3 years worth of Trump #$%$ wiped-out and back to square one. The man is a LOSER in everything he does in life. He knows absolutely nothing about business, how to develop it, how to run it or how to profit from it. He is mentally ill and is in dire need of professional help. His claim to fame is 'pretending'.For those of you who believe he is a 'billionaire', guess again. If he has (on paper) $2 billion, then he OWES others $4 billion. That is not a billionaire. He's a fake and everything that flows from him is also fake."
Of corse is up when I sell lol
And we're off to the races!!
I’m looking at $270 to add . . . .
thank you for298.00
Just sold all COST at 183
Did COST crash a plane?

"Costco has risen to too high, too fast.Watch out for a mini crash, down to 220's..."
POSITIVE THINKING: RISE RISE RISE RISE
https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/13/a-morgan-stanley-reading-on-the-economy-collapses-by-the-most-ever.htmlNice spike into close....weird action in ALL the XLP stocks.........I still say retail sales are weak tomorrow!! I have July 260 PUTS.....so I have time....and NO RATE CUT NEXT WEEK.....that should get rid of the crazy safety plays.
Up four bucks today. Down four bucks tomorrow
The government in Japan might announce a state of emergency this month. It means people gather in Costco to get daily necessities;)
"cost got ahead of itself way too rich, priced even above perfection, good company/business modeldecent entry point ~$170"
500k traded in the last few minutes of the regular trading hours...130k already after hours. Looks like things are about to get interesting.
sfix DROPS 30% AFTER HOUR: COST stock is very vulnerable for big drop !Target $200!
"This stock is due to pass 200 , this should happen soon"
Sales numbers are good up 5.6% from last year
Well who ever has been pulling it down hopefully got the heck out all the way with that EOD 1/4 mil. share dump.Good riddins!
Who moved my Pimento Cheese?
S. California 12 o’clock noon two hours after they’ve been open line was still wrapped around to the back of Costco their earnings are going to be off the charts look for a special year in dividends for long-term shareholders
EPS actually beat.... they got taxed which they are protesting. Could have an EPS over 2.60
when is the exdidvend date for the special Divdend?
"Guys - COST reports monthly revenues, one of the best at that. Why would anyone expect some big deviation from what they have already said?"
They drive it down all day... later they bring it back to the green...........................look for dips as buy opp.
CRAMER continues to say BUY ....COST here.
"It's really a shame to see people like 'Funue' who just cannot seem to learn the difference between something as simple as resistance and support, two very fundamentally basic technical indicators. Being 'slow' and 'unaware' is no way to go through life. I really feel sorry for him - trying to impress others with knowledge he does not possess. Again, he reminds me of Donald Trump.I hope everyone has a Happy and SAFE New Year in 2019!!"
"costco,,,,wow,,how weak of a company stock can it suddenly be,,whats going on,,amazon is not the reason,, who is really shorting this and trying to get everyone out"
"this stock trades in a manipulated weird way,,,,,,,not really normal the pattern,,seems to just and fall on nothing,,,tells me MM are manipulating trades"
"The only real question here is when we bottom out, so we can start growing back to $400. IMHO it’s now."
TOMORROW PREMARKET WILL OPEN NORTH OF $17
Nice close !
Target increased again340.00
$135 is critical.

Can anyone foresee this going past 350?
Massive drop expected in cost with all the panic buying of stopped
Earnings announcement will be made after hour today. Hang on long. The pandemic has triple the sales of the company within the last 6 months. We will be rewarded. It’s going to break all the records. Yeah!!!!
close $7 up...$10 Up after earnings
"While most retailers, Whole Foods included, are shutting down retail locations, Costco continues building profitable warehouses and signing up millions of dedicated customers with a 92% retention rate. Think about that for a moment."
"Thanks to the inflation news, we could load up at this dip today! However, compared with TGT and WMT, wholesale king COST’s business and stock are both benefiting the biggest from Inflation!"
"Berkshire just sold their entire stake of Costco. A whopping 4.3 million shares. Even after this was announced, the price hung relatively tough. Looks like tomorrow the price will spike to $390 & then just may really soar."
Sales through the ROOF !shorties are toast !
this stock dropped $7 today
"I used to brag about costco, how great it was...to be honest..im embarrassed now, this has been the greatest disappointment...never saw this coming"
"I just sold and got out.. the forward multiple is way too high compared to peers. Even if they make good numbers, stock will likely pull back. When it does, I will get back in around $150."
COST is a BBBBBUUUUUYYYYYY here going 238-240.00
have my 292.00 - 305.00 Buy Order if Markets Break down today !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Costco Wholesale Q3 EPS $2.05 Beats $1.82 Estimate, Sales $34.74B Beat $34.67B Estimate, Total Comparable Sales Up 5.5% $COST."
"what is wrong with this stock? anyone know? why does it continually spike...and out of nowhere just come crashing down,?"
I think they are about to declare the special dividend
Further drop after hours. What a great opportunity to load up. I would buy at $350 and now I am seeing $312 in after hours. Definitely loading up tomorrow for long term. Huge Costco fan.
Costco's going to pop on the next earnings report
"SORRY FOR THE WEAK HAND WHO DROPS THE BALL, RUN FROM THE FACT THAT OPP IS THE #$%$, BIG #$%$ THAT MAKE MONEY BY SCARING INVESTORS TO SELL LOW."
start some buying soon.350
this will be back to 300 soon ....seems like
Amazon to buy Costo ?
"Costco stock ""will"" make $350+ a share, as future monthly and quarterly earnings provide assurance that Costco's future is very strong as has been we'll be going up up just as last yr."
"AMAZON PRIME ""sucks"" enrolled in it with just one click by accident and they automatically add to your credit card without you being aware of it!careful shoppers......."
"Kroger up big, much lower P/E ratio than costco"
Back down again he he hewww.
"Just think if they would have missed in their earnings! Under 200 for sure. We are headingthere right now! It don't matter, America is bankrupt anyway. Just a matter of time beforewe are hauling our groceries in a wheelbarrow."
OWN ITdont trade it !
hey all you geniuses. you got Costco' s. go buy some toilet paper to wipe the puke up off the floor. I will buy this for 310.00 or less.

Buy Now goin up next monday.Big move
I expect a bounce from $361.72.
"Net sales for the quarter increased 7.3 percent, to $36.45 billion-Mount breathers on WS guesstimate 36.55--- EPS= 1.89 on est of 1.85 (+.04 per share surprise)...the sky is not falling. Remember that April was a stinkeroo...They and shareholders will be just fine."
Just bought some more - wish me luck.
red all day except 2 minutes in the open
Looking like this will go to $260 before $300 again...
costblo sells old stale products.
Costco Christmas sales FTW!
last green day was in December I think..like Christmas eve.
I love my Cost and my DZSI. Two huge winners
watch for upgrades on the way
maybe we can get one of those nice $20 spikes
Costco has been stuck in a symmetrical triangle for a while. It's about to test resistance around $313 if it doesn't tomorrow. If it breaks through and holds that for support it could go up to a secondary resistance line which is around $320. if it breaks through that the primary resistance line is $350
Profit will jump high in March
Has anyone have an idea to why this stock is dropping?
The numbers are still really good just had the estimates set a little high. I think this still goes up to 295 by end of trading tomorrow.
Man... RH really costing me some $COST!
$358 two weeks ago
INSTITUTIONS are back buying..........................
question...are there certain days shorts can short a stock? it seems some days are worse then others..shorting should be illegal in my opinion
"Costco Private Jet - Gee, just what the doctor ordered, flying in a more restrictive, germ filled aluminum can."
Upgraded !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Costco options imply 7.5% move in share price post-earnings (TheFlyOnTheWall) Hmmm, that would be $340, can the fly be trusted?THE FLY 2:49 PM"
"Ballsack/hairbag on mute, :-) , too much nonsense daily from it."
"Institutions looking for STOP LOSS orders, so they can pickup your CHEAP SHARES !"
"Any person or entity or analyst send out negative news, if they are shorting the stock, anyone broadcast bad news and short/buying the stocks , or tell the friends to buy/ short - Should be prosecuted especially someone is paying them to do so! It's hard to prove but the SEC should monitor them!"
"It is beat but not enough ,, only 3% surprise on EPS and 1.5% surprise on REV= Mediocre beat"
"New to this board (I follow MU). Interesting situation with COST. Down a bit now, earnings this week.. Our local store (in N.E.) was a mad house over the weekend. Shelves empty, lines to the back, etc. And yes; we bought extra bread! Buying op nowish or still going lower? Will watch as I don't know this stock."
If I buy tomorrow will I get the special dividend
Hope Costco puts signs up for all those people buying push carts full of water and bleach and toilet paper that those are unreturnable
"After the initial rush to Costco...eventually people are stopping to going in to Costco stores....Costco will loose more and more business to Amazon and Walmart due to these two giants having better online , warehousing and distribution centers...this is the toughest time for Costco and not going in to online strategy and improving distribution centers and supply chain with too much focus on retail stores will cost now...i can;t see Costco coming out without a scar from this..I had warned this few months back and was trashed on this board..."
Targets raisedagain.................................
Oversold.
"June numbers are out. Expecting a positive opening tomorrow. (GlobeNewswire) > > Costco Wholesale Corporation (""Costco"" or the ""Company"") (Nasdaq:COST) today reported net sales of $12.17 billion for the month of June, the five weeks ended July 2, 2017, an increase of seven percent from $11.33 billion during the similar period last year.For the forty-four weeks ended July 2, 2017, the Company reported net sales of $104.28 billion, an increase of six percent from $98.51 billion during the similar period last year."
"I didn't feel comfortable holding my TD Ameritrade position (short term = day trading) after the earnings, so I sold at $290 today.However, I held on to my larger position in Fidelity which I think will be fine long term. I'm eyeing TGT as well with a 2.7% yield."
"Watch put for 202 tomorrow, if it crosses 202 and stay above all day that’s a bullish signal"
"How is it that we have strong earnings albeit at a slight slower month to month level yet beating expectations and now for the last 3 days more than $10 have been wiped off share price. So much for the $10 ""special"" dividend. It should be renamed Special Stick Price Eraser. we announce $10 and it cost shareholders $20."
"BOYCOTT AMAZON. NOW WITH A PHYSICAL STORE THEY CAN START DOING PHARMA, ETC. BOYCOTT THEM."
It’s a buy under 320
Went to Costco once Never went back Don’t understand appeal
"Somebody knows something and it’s beyond bad, that’s why the big boys are jumping ship!!!!"
Look for the CYBER dips here ...............................................................buyer under 292.00
All aboard ???????Train leaving soon !
Only reason to buy this is the dividend.
"How is special dividend a gift? If it reduces the price by exactly the same amount, effectively forcing some to pay higher tax(as a dividend on 1099div vs capital gain)"
Costco and Walmart stores are very empty of people. We went shopping yesterday and it was a big supersize because I thought we had to wait in a long line.
372.00 soon
"Grimbelina, get your finger out of your bum,. get the other hand out of your pocket and you just might be able to spell and type to cobble together a coherent sentence.I don't hate stupid people, Grimbelina, in fact I find you mildly amusing.Now, erase this post. Good boy."
"Stocks dont just keep going up, they take a pause."
Costco just hit $100 billion market cap!
don't mind competition. But I can remember when Walmart was the evil behemoth. Amazon is becoming the new job killer. I own Amazon but ...I love Costco. cant see why it's dropping like this.I'll buy some more
"With earnings this Thur, it blows through 200."

Back to 180 next week! Let the bears go running 
When is the special dividend date ? thanks .
Don't understand at all why COST down this big even though PE is high.
"If it breaks 189, I shorting more because the next stop will be 173"
BJ's is not Costco's Costco it's a lot more employees and does a lot more business and is well-known
Just look for the dips thendo some BUYING.
To me. Due to intensive competition between AMZN and other retailers. They should all go down. Even AMZN should go down..But that is just me.
"Missed by a penny an engineered loss by the analysts as revenue exceeded estimates, all the tight stop loss triggered and look who is waiting to buy at the bottom."
"bullish uptrend, buy on any dips here..........................."
"I own 200 shares of this and I am glad to see it continue to climb, but man it is due for a correction."
cost COULD EASILY GO OVER500.00 SAYS ANALYST !
Costco is always packed on any day of the week. On Sale items I wanted to buy online including a TV and an Espresso Machine are all sold out. This is a great sign so I look forward to add to my position.

how can one day at one Costco cause the company to be worth 10% more.. everyone knew that they were opening a store....
"Dear Little Stevie- please explain to us exactly what you do to make a living, your last grade completed and how much you make a year. This should be good...."
The best retailer in the world. No one comes close not even AMZN.
Wait for 10:00 am before buyingbig boys taking it lower....................................
Stores open usually 15 minutes early. Parking is close. Need Gas? Go on a non shopping day 1 hour or more before opening or 1/2 hour or more after store closing. NO Lines. Easy Peesey
why the premarket panic?
the DIP today allows me to add more .
Overreacting to vaccine ..... And Kramer’s annoying mouth
Selling volume has disappeared after the July sales report.
Costco is for old people. All young people and families buy everything from Amazon for convenience - they don't have to battle traffic and waste time.
tomorrow we beat the 52wk high?
I just entered back into COST after making some nice gains earlier. Due to the high price I started nibbling and slowly adding to the position. Avg cost basis is ~$245 by 7/1/2019. I wanted some protection against a correction because the stock became increasingly oversold. I wrote some Jan 2020 $270 calls with a $14 premium. I got the protection I wanted by the by reducing my cost basis to ~$239 but stock ran away from me right after I sold the calls I am still under my break even point by a few bucks but the stock apprars to be very strong due to recent same store monthly comps and the rumor of a one time dividend like they did a few years ago. I am a COST member and see the strength of the chain every time I go in to shop. I was looking for some guidance from anyone who is a covered call player.
COSTCO (COST) is the FUTUREhttps://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/23/better-buy-costco-vs-coca-cola.aspx
AMAZON go baby go.
"Bottom line is pe is too high, FOR THE FUNDS, and they are trimming positions. Until they are done, then the stock is dead money. I like COST, but my love just cost me 10k"
Parking must be a nightmare
earning out
What a rip off when you order delivered by Insta cart from Costco. The delivery person has been told not to give you a receipt and if they miss an item you get charged for it anyway. Talked to store manager and had I picked up my order it would have been $92 but I paid $138 with Insta Cart.
170% unreal!!!!!! This should fly by now
Do your thing Costco - I'm in decent and have my safety harness engaged. Let's GOOOOooooo!!!!
What is Costco’s motivation for declaring a special dividend? Why would they do it? (I know they’ve done it in the past)
Pretty scary 6 month chart
Buy today .
300 tomorrow
guidance?
"Watch Cost go up next week as investors pile in ahead of earnings. I say $290 area before earnings, $300 or higher after, don't forget that special divvy is still on the table"
When is ER
COST will be back! Check out these stocks.....PCTL.....ATDS.....IQST.....VRUS.....BBRW
LakeErieMonster..why do you think you're cool? Who told you and why did you believe them
"It is the holiday, week of Christmas. The midst of a global wide pandemic that is accelerating. The end of the year. The special dividend that all of you have been carrying on about needing has happened. Let it rest. Calm down. You should be in it for the long haul anyway....right?!"
Dividend declared today
the lines at costco is so long. 1 plus one wait. buy buy buy
Yes keep going down! Gonna buy at 142
We all saw how STZ reacted today. Up ^ Up ^ Up ^
BUYING AS MANY SHARES THIS LEVEL AS POSSIBLE THIS WILL GO TO $390 AND HIGHER
Costco is international and whole food is limited to the US plus their prices are ridiculous. Wall street exuberance . Buying opportunity
"Tom Hanks, has asked Battle Weary Doyenne, Nancy Pelosi,to have sleepy Joe Biden, replaced by Andrew Cuomo,in presidential race."
"added another 100 shares, good luck to all"
costco for life.
"Go Costco go , the shorts should be nervous.."
Anyone know why the last minute dump? Weekend beer money?
150 closing...
I love how idiots are selling this off 
Hey Jeff Bezo! You have to save the real Amazon that bears your company name! Do it yesterday already! Have some conscience!
"I'm sticking with Costco. Bought at $80;77/share, have made over 175% so far. This pullback is temporary. With Holiday season approaching, I expect a big bounce-back later this quarter. Costco has been good for me but for day-traders I realize it must be a tough call. Costco keeps adding services (like insurance, car sales, travel programs, etc. Costco has great management, innovative and customer service-oriented. Fairly good quarterly dividends. I'm sticking with it."
This always happens when Costco reports. It goes down a little then up significantly.
timmmmmber................................200.00
LOOK AT NKE MAKING NEW 52 WKS HIGH COSTCO BE NEXT
Costco announced that it can withstand a trade war. And I am feel good about $COST 's sales and expansion strategies. I think its stock price is still undervalued. https://www.finstead.com/posts/COST-buy-or-sell
"Woo Hoo!! New all time high set at $331.15.busting ceiling of $330, up up from here, $400 this yr. easily."
COST buying time for me!
"For diversification, should I also incorporate some Pricesmart in my portfolio alongside Costco? They are loose cousins, after all."
Picked up some at $319.90. It does not matter whereit will be tomorrow after earning. $340 fine. $290 fine. What matters is where it will be in 2025 and beyond...
"Orange man should be tweeting something soon, like China talks very promising, then all stocks jump back up n Orange man boiler room friends make mucho $$$$"
Consider Costco as Cloud based subscription model. Stock is way undervalued.
What? Who sold at $305.65 in the AH?
Where is résistance??
I have been investor in MKC since 2019. what do you guys think about Corona virus effecting the stock?
85 pennies away from 270 which I have been predicting would happen since January of this year. Just view my history on this board. Easiest call I have ever made.
COST rules the retail world.
I heard COSTO is opening in China. How does all this trade war tarriffs effect this company?
"What is so wrong with having an improving economy with low rates??????rates were this level in 2020, no one complained then........."
Consolidation is over. You better cover shorty. See the rest of you at $270
I don’t think costco model will success in China. Different culture. People will take a advantage of their return and membership policy. Plus. Don’t forget in North amearica there are so many DAIGOU can help you get the costco product here. Much cheap and ship directly to you home. It is a tough business for costco. Walmart in China is a good example.
"Thank you for the280.0""s"
"Still short, cover at 260 or less"
What happen after hour?Did I miss anything?
Cramer likes COST. Probably wont help the stock much. When he first started his show people followed his advice.
"The Mad Money interview tonight was outstanding. If you are a holder, make sure you find a replay. It does not take many minutes."
pre market crash
Briben is making China great again!
Buy COST as its low risk on tariffs......................................
There's a rumour about a stock split. What do you guys think?
Any shareholders concerned about recent price pull back need only to look at 52 week high and low to put fears at rest. COST remains near all time highs
"estimate 2.84 eps, came in 3.13 eps"
"Anna. 352 is a great entry point! China growth alone makes it a dirt cheap investment, they love hot dogs and pizza!"
"How COST went down over 7 points this morning? I just wonder, so I just pick up some Oct 4, call 280, just for the safe side. All I know that if COST plans to open up store in china two a month. OPP will turn around and upgrade to buy or overweight."
CHINA markets doing well !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!production is back to near NORMAL.
why did this thing flop around today?
"I love Costco and have been long the stock. But they are tripping over themselves day after day. Low levels of important products and no sourcing. There's no selection of computers, sanitizing wipes or other PPE. Manager are hogging the sanitizing wipes for their own stores. Totally fumbling the ball in many ways. Incompetency blamed on the corona virus. I blame the CEO who could have had a plan to increase sales during the pandemic, instead hundreds of millions in sales were lost which explains why Costco if underperforming nearly every other front line retailer. Amazon, Walmart and Target are killing it, costco is fumbling. Sad, very sad."
SELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL now buy back under 200.00
"Good riddens, and don't let the door kick you in the tush Warren. Now Costco can keep going up and well above $400 after your charades of selling over past months leaving share holders confused by your mistakable leave. Suck it up ol boy, you lost out.."
Traders are playing with you....trying to draw you in.
This is typical...it runs up before earnings....we get a great report....idiots sell on the news...firms upgrade the stock...we go up until next earnings report. Repeat.
Was hitting $300 then the orange traitor opened his lying mouth
I see the Wall Street Shemales are dumping for profits. Some things never change.
COST #1 pick RECESSION PROOOOOOOOOOOOOOF
EARNINGS WILL BE HUGE !!!!
"Just got back from Costco Plano (Dallas) TX. Shoppers everywhere and TVs/products flying out the door. And for a Friday night that’s pretty good. So to me, if big business would stop canceling meetings/conferences/!travel we would be just fine as the consumer hasn’t stopped yet. Jmho."
I really really love that drop.
Honestly I’m just upset Costco isn’t going to give out free samples when the stores open back up. That’s the only reason I go.
"obviously this is a stock that is severely over rated, and oversold..clearly"
Still Overbought. Maybe a Buy at 180.
Huge miss

You're Smart to Stock Up on Costcoloading...................................
"Perfect time to buy. Overreaction on the Amazon Whole Foods buyout, support at $163. Only up from here. Let's be serious Costco isn't anywhere people."
"seems this stock gets to 160,,,gets shorted very hard back to 150 then they slowly go back to 160,,,well i am out now,,waiting to see if its shorted back to 150 then i will buy again"
Stock is acting poorly.
I hope it goes down because I'd like to get in at lower levels
"READING MATERIAL FOR INTEREST OF SHAREHOLDERS OR LOOKING TO BE.Announcement of Periodic Review: Moody's announces completion of a periodic review of ratings of Costco Wholesale Corporation04 May 2020New York, May 04, 2020 -- Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's"") has completed a periodic review of the ratings of Costco Wholesale Corporation and other ratings that are associated with the same analytical unit. The review was conducted through a portfolio review in which Moody's reassessed the appropriateness of the ratings in the context of the relevant principal methodology(ies), recent developments, and a comparison of the financial and operating profile to similarly rated peers. The review did not involve a rating committee. Since 1 January 2019, Moody's practice has been to issue a press release following each periodic review to announce its completion.This publication does not announce a credit rating action and is not an indication of whether or not a credit rating action is likely in the near future. Credit ratings and outlook/review status cannot be changed in a portfolio review and hence are not impacted by this announcement. For any credit ratings referenced in this publication, please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com for the most updated credit rating action information and rating history.Key rating considerations are summarized below.Costco's credit profile (Aa3 stable) recognizes its position as the leading warehouse club operator in North America, with a destination grocery business that drives significant store traffic, an annuity-like membership model, a solidly-performing international presence, and an innovative complementary internet business. Additional drivers of the rating include Costco's world class operating capability, its excellent liquidity profile, and a financial strategy that has become more predictable and continues to be well-balanced between shareholders and debt holders. We note as evidenced by an unqualified audit opinion that as of September 1, 2019, Costco has remediated the material weakness in its internal controls that it disclosed in its 2018 Form 10K relating to general information technology controls in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information technology systems that support its financial reporting processes. Thus far, Costco has been able to largely weather the impact of the coronavirus as its stores are considered essential and remain open, however recent steps to implement tighter social distancing, specifically limiting the number of shoppers in stores at any one time, will have a negative impact. With its formidable liquidity and strong quantitative credit profile, Costco has the financial flexibility to successfully navigate through virtually any potential scenario"
"no Amazon, cost still too high, Amazon earnings growth too strong and make huge money, so Amazon sure be attack cost, cost profit margin too low ,so I think cost can't afford it, so buy cost is very risk."
COST shorties have had the juice squeezed out of them like lemons. This behemoth is a short's worst nightmare.
"Come on Costco !!! 4 billion dollars in profit? No wonder your stock is down. No one wants profits. Call yourself a tech company, post financial losses on hardly no sales, and make ridiculous promises, and have the hedge funds manipulate your stock up on misleading headlines and control trades. 4 billion dollars in record profit. THIS IS A SCREAMING SHORT !!!!"
"Last week was the best time to buy Costco, tomorrow it could open +4."
"What is Kirkland, why Jeff Bezo what it to buy that?"
If I buy on Dec 1st and Sell on Dec 2nd will I get $10/share dividend?

If AMZN is over $3000 then COST should be at least $1000.

this stock is a sure thing. Other than a bit of a drop when Amazon bought wholefoods they alway increase in value and the dividend is not bad
what happened? beat it went up and then back down
Kindly clarify which date is for special dividend. PR & SEC filing shows EOD December 2nd. If you are holder on December 2nd at the closing you are entitled for the special dividend. some says the date is November 30th. how can the date be different from SEC filing? Also as many stated here the price is expected to drop by $10 after the dividend date? what are your views? please help. I am planning to buy 300 shares on Dec. 2nd and plan to close my position on 3rd December before the market close.
"On $10 dividend news, stock only rose, $2+plus.rest of t, about $8 is still on the table for people to grab on to."
Still selloff with huge volume. Likely more selloff ahead. Looks like not reaching a short term bottom yet.
"Still good support at $180.00, but P/E will have to drop to a more normal range of 16 to 20, instead of the lofty 36."
"If you don't buy then hold for huge gain after ER, blowing ER coming."
sooooo whats the ex date for special div???
"Me think the speceal dividend is close. Me Cousin, Jose, he know from haircut man who cuts CEO hairs, that a special dividend will happen soon and he say something bout a stock split, also, Me not sure about the split, maybe soon at christmas when we party."
stock sux lately
Shorts better run its coming for you
BOYCOTT AMAZON
people are so quick to freak out. it is possible that both COST and AMZN can thrive together. COST caters to different needs than AMZN. go visit a Costco and see for yourself.
I just read they are making all customers wear a mask starting 05/04.....I guess you are safe today through then.
This stock is a dog. I am buying 100 more shares.
"Ex div on Aug 30, 2018."
Buy COST here at these levels..............................150-153.00 a STEAL !!!!!you will see in couple of months the recovery hereMARK MY WORDS !
I think there might be a special dividend coming next month

"Talking with workers at Costco about how much labor they are using to keep as many registers open to get members in and out quickly and how much their spending on sanitation crews. znot in the 31 years I worked there did I ever see that much payroll being spent on any given day, not even on the holidays."
Open tomorrow looks big time up
Special divvy coming ! Woohoo!

"We shop at our Costco every week, what no one has mentioned is during the height of all this, they had a limit of 125 guest at our local stores, now it’s up to 500. They did this for the protection of there members which is great. But, I have yet to hear any of the analysts mention this. Nice for a company to look out for there guests/members. Love Costco, long and strong!"

Who is paying 3200 a share for Amazoo with a p/e of 122 And no dividends. I wish Costco had a p/e like that. Amazoo is a RETAILER that owns very little property but loves to spend money. Good Luck to the AMAZOO Fans. I use them occasionally but would never waste my money with stock.
"a predatory amazon strategy is still in effect. AMZN sells goods cheaper than anyone else do not making any profit but slowly swallowing the whole industry. Some ""investors"" behind AMZN back are paying for everything. Those ""investors' are super-deep pocket players, likely connected to the highest financial elite (otherwise you are unable to understand AMZN valuation that exceeds any reasonable digits in a factor of x25-30). According to fundamentals AMZN right price is $30."
take off to fresh HIGHS soon.
"Here's to all you COST shorts, thanks for the pop. Now get back to buying."

"Revenues up on stockpiling, but bottom line missed. Can you just imagine how bad the following quarter will be? I’m not taking a chance. Selling here."
"NO ONE has said that a special dividend - if there is one - will be $18.50 per share! That is the cash on hand. A special would be some fraction of that. The stock price will be reduced on the open by the amount of the payout. For taxable accounts, it means more taxes for you."
"It's always packed when I shop in costco, I don't understand why stock down, so frustrated"
18% over a year ago and 107% on lineamazing
"Approximately $18/share increase since exactly a year ago only. Kind of low for such a strong company, especially through COVID, people stocked up their supplies. Wondering why? "
Why in the world would anybody short a 154+ stock in a prime best of breed company? I sold high today and bought back more. Amazon is not the one I want buying my food and sending it to my home. Amazon pays slave wages and would you like someone making 10-12 bucks an hour buying and properly taking care of your food that you feed your kids or yourself. I go to Publix or Costco to buy my own food.
lets see i got 100 comtract puts 152.5 for average 0.10if it tanks to 155 my puts worth 3K

"went to 30 percent cash on this rally and just put a third of that in costco this morning. i still want to be in the market. its too fun, and costco lets me watch something low risk while i pass the time stuck instead. I guess I need a hobby."
More UPGRADES............................buy here while itsCHEAP !
"Relax people, Costco had a big run up the last six months, and now corrected to a more suitable multiple"
$330 in the am like stated early this afternoon. With a 36 pe it is a rich evaluation
"So, a frag becomes a gangster when everybody want to show off. Motley fool, a paid media, is trying to spin the facts about COST now that everybody is acting. Online may steal some lazy people but family shopping will be strong at Costco where the real saving is.My visa card already accumulated $600 of bonus and my Costco membership is a small fee compare to my savings."
You guys ready for the +$20/share Aftermarket/Premarket after earnings drop?
"I would like to see company buy back shares,"
I told you it will tank today and no one believe me
"Costco revenues are declining due to a slower world economy. If your up in profits, sell your shares, the hedge funds and institutions will drive the share price of Costco well below $200, probably will find support around $155. Remember, we are in a bear market, which is expected to last a few years. So, I would advise you not to listen to the pumpers or dreamers on this message board. Don't try to be a hero and say, I will not sell. You will have many sleepless nights watching Costco share price drift lower and lower.Do the right thing."
I am assuming that the contracted GDP is hurting certain sectors such as consumer staples and not others. Rotation is into growth stocks and financials. Puzzling to say the least how the market perceives.

"Been holding COST for over 19 yrs, always bounces back..........................................."
Costco's customers have been shopping side by side with Wholefoods for YEARS and Costco has remained profitable. Amazon won't be changing that anytime soon. Costco's customer base is solid and they actually ENJOY their shopping trips. FANTASTIC BUYING OPPORTUNITY!! 167.40 and I'm IN BIG!
Winner winner chicken dinner. Or it is too early?
TRUMP is the main cause of market volatility and meltdown.
"Just LOADED the boat with Costco stock and Shorted AMZN. There's a reason that WHF profits have been declining over the past several quarters. Simply put, even the wealthy don't like being had when it comes to pricing and (implied) quality. Don't wait for the crowd to figure this out. Short AMZN / Long COST"
Downgraded to SELL!

"I have been watching COST for almost a year and waiting in line during the pandemic for the local store to open like so many others and this week I finally put some money into Costco stock. A small dividend, a subscription stream of income before subscription became a buzz word on Wall Street and a company that could still grow its market in many countries especially with 1 store in China is why. IMHO. God Bless and stay well."
"So with the Debacle that is the new Credit card ""City"" bank switch over as a Costco member for over 20 years the next quarter numbers will be lower . Costco will loose the charge back and possible customers that are being POd by the treatment of Shity Bank.If you are having the same issues as having direct payments refused by Shity Bank CALL Costco do it a lot and loud ."
New highs today please
Anyone know the guidance
im scared

I LOVE MY COSTCO SHARES!!!!
Shorts covering?? Feel free to short again at 180
"FredMeyer (KR)' parking lot are full, too. It don matta. stock going down anyway..KR is cheaper than COST.. COST is in low margin business. One slip in competition, COST is going down big.PE of 27 still too expensive."
LONG NOW
still.cost is 6 percent lower than previous high ...so buy and see magic
P/E is still way too high. Costco looks fine back at $150-170. Be patient.
"Costco's revenue & margins are consistently solid, membership renewals above 90%; when excluding gasoline & foreign exchange, COST has growth % unheard of for businesses hitting $116B in sales. COST took a hit investing in future growth overseas that will pay off BIG. Their top $300M+ sales warehouses are in Asia, so further expansion makes perfect sense. Buy on the dip. When detailed financials are reported Sept 29th, Wall Street will appreciate the metrics. Target price $195."
should have bought walmart this stock is maxed out
"This overreaction to cost is a huge buying opportunity. Costco buyers are not going away. Their shares will rebound and if you have bought, during this craziness, you will be way ahead. Markets behave like this from time to time. Costco is a fabulous investment and will reap great benefits in price when this craziness is over."
"$10 special dividend received this upcoming Friday the 11th. JUST DRIP, DRIP, DRIP into my IRA accounts!"
"If people stock more supplies at Costco this quarter wouldn't it just mean it's sales would slow down the next quarter? I mean, i think everyone would eat and use the same amount of toilet paper. So if they already have it in stock that means they just won't buy more later."
Waiting for some sale price291.00 area
no rate cut ...thanx ..all market low bcoz of fomc today ....
"Fair Value = $200, Buffett was right"
Paying extra 2.00 hour to employees hurts bottom line...ridiculous
"Costco is like a cult. their customers are loyal and knows where to find value and service. Membership renewal is about 90%. (Compare that to Sams where they are giving membership free, Pay $45 and get $45 back). Employee turnover is very low. Employees are happy. Earnings is good. LOOONG."
If Costco is down like that you know what rest of market will do?
And here comes the steady climb towards next ER.
329.00-330.00 adding more
$Cost treated me well today looking at more gains during tomorrow session. Past 3-4 weeks was time to load up on cheaper shares this is one of the best stocks and companies in the entire market.
COST rarely performs well after earnings.
COST should have a higher PE than AMZN.
"The not so bad news, with today's market sell-off... Costco fairs better % wise than the rest of the retail sector. The big Amz is double down % than Costco. Glad to be holding this than another retail stock!!!"
profit taking in droves is imminent .. give it 2-6 wks
Costco has warned shoppers that prices will go up due to China trade. Is this something to be concerned about? Serious comments please.
"a high percentage of people are afraid to go into stores, the media has put fear into everyone, this may be like this for a long time...I'm really hoping online orders propel the revenue..."

Unbelievable. Watching Costco stock for the last week has me thinking now it may just go to 0.
Love the selling prior to earnings !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They killed it while everyone else is dead in the water
Look for the SILLY dips as a BUY here...................................
"Just a penny missed. The trade war tomorrow will bring it home. The Chinese loved Costco there! More stores will be opened there for sure.The company's total revenue rose to $37.04 billion from $35.07 billion. Analysts, on average, had expected $37.25 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."
COST and AAPL just hold it ..dont trade it !jmho
"Just read a story that Costco may raise their membership fees. If they do, we're done. I can barely justify going there now at $60/year. We are a family of 2 now that they children have their own lives."
cant get ahead in this stock!..a few weeks ago it had some nice spukes..only to crash back down...wmt is the better but
TGT beat but didn't issue guidance. Thus its getting slammed! Mr. Market doesn't like that! I sure hope COST does issue some sort of guidance!

this stock is definitey going to 250~260 range. sit tight
"Cash-out your gain and run! Giant UK Tesco supermarket did that before and failed miserably after rent, tax and running cost with empty shop. The Asians always like to ry new thing-especially America products- regardless the cost, then walking down the street the next day to find the same Made in China things for half the price and they stop going to Costco."
"HA HA HA HA...""COSTCO IS NOT GOING DOWN FOREVER..."" HA HA HA ... BOY THE STOCK IS GOING TO SOAR NOW. EMPLOYEES NEED ANOTHER RAISE. STOCK SHELVES FOR $52,000 A YEAR PLUS BONUSES... SIGN ME UP. I THINK IT'LL BE A REALLY GREAT BUY AT 270."

"What Costco really needs to do to re-ignite its growth engine is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for Costo (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if Costo just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

is the earnings better or not better than expected?
buying now
Poor performance after buyback and dividend increase. Stock looks like its topping.
Virus or no virus people still need FOOD !
Is guidance looks good?
If enough people sell it will drive the cost down like any other stock. Many will get their reward and sell. That would take a lot of selling to drive it down $10 per share though. Then it might even go up.
there goes the $5 day
I did say it was priced to perfection folks a few hrs back. No way it was going up AH. I'm neutral and a costco member - the stock is a diff animal.

After this pandemic, Costco will continue to be a pristine business. Remember guys your not buying a price ticker, you are buying a business!"
2.01 vs 1.69 adj basis
"COSTCO is dying! I just came from my local Costco and I only had 2 people ahead of me at the register, on a Saturday afternoon?! IMO I am following Jim Cramers idea of physically going to places and see if FOOT traffic still exists for that particular company."
LB was a great company too.. Stock is now half of the price.. Yes cheaper than COST>
Like I said.....red.
"Costco = fun to shop and walk through store. While Sam’s Club has similar layout, why doesn’t it feel the same?"
"planning g to sell all of my costco shares. and buy back the special dividend is a joke, and a wash..why pay you $10.... then drop the share price? makes no sense whats so special about that?"
"QUALITY (TOP GRADE). Pull back is on the NORMAL TREND........Back & Fill ..................HIGH SHARE PRICE 183.00, PULL BACK NORMAL............"
Upgrades stabilize stock price pretty soon
called it yesterday...cost been doing too good this week..gunna be down today
"The notion that Amazon can impact Costco’s sales figures doesn’t make sense :1) Costco is a membership and not a cheap one - people have to want to be Costco members, some portion of them are large families 2) most Costco members have as well Amazon prime - no impact on sales3) Costco sales huge packages , some generic - the shipping costs from Amazon will be high Etc ..."
macd crossover on The Daily today don't sell yet
COST just HUMMMING along............................. in the GREEN
Market is over bought. Taking a breather.
Anyone else notice that their 2020 revenue is higher than Costco’s market cap?
"I don't get it! When you go into Costco the atmosphere is as good as it gets. Everyone I know loves Costco! Costco has creates an atmosphere that its the place to go. As an investor and a Costco member I only see good things in the long run. Amazon, Walmart, Shi... they cannot keep up with Costco. The noise in the markets are self serving the people making the noise. Long term Costco is a screaming buy at the current stock price. Costco can increase pricing if they want to and will not decrease membership. Costco is still in a position to expand brick and mortar, online, and delivery of goods and services which will out compete the competition."
Chart indicating the low ATM; should be heading up Monday.
I don't like the fact they are getting into political stuff cause of palmetto cheese owner gave an opinion on his page about the mess going on with country and Costco is going to pull it. i liked the product.
"TRUMP starting to ""REASON"" now about trade war deals ."
SPLIT already
"Costco is a great company but its stock has performed rather poorly. I purchased this stock back in March 2020 at $303 thinking that it was going to hit $400+. As of this morning (June 15, 2020), it's $296 and I am not a happy camper."
A down day and there is a bunch of bearishness. They will fix any computer glitches.
Buyer233.08
This stock tends to bounce between a 25 PE and 30 PE on forward earnings. Right now we are at the high end of this range. Might sell off to $195 or so which would be a 25 PE on 2019 estimated earnings.
"Under 300.00 aBARGAIN.....................................COST always recovers faster then others, mark my word."
china deal will push it more also ..correct time of er
Opening day demonstrates the potential and demand of Costco in China. Dramatic growth is absolutely certain.
This will finish green it’s a deal. Once they launch Costco delivery it will moon 
Once investors figure out that tweets and brexit dont affect this very strong economy we are going to see a nice run. The affects of Trumps tax cuts will manifest all next year. Its not once and done as the authors would have you believe. Also this recovery staryed in 2016 on election day. Not 09 under Obama. That was a very very weak climb on crutches and terrible policy. The economy is STRONG.
"Anybody else getting impatient with this stock? I really thought $170 would be here by now. I'm not particularly a ""Trader"" but I see other opportunities out there where my money would do more work."
goin back to $300 after earnings collapse
Surprise dividend is in the works !
"Expansion in China alone will need over 200 to 300 stores to open just to start to handle their demand. This stock will, will continue to keep doing well and eventually reach 400 or higher in the future"
Next stop298.00
Most other stocks are undervalued and cost is overvalued. Institutions rebalance and buy other stocks while selling cost.
What did Cramer said? Just now? Take profits?
"its Friday, are we having a sell off? like usual,?"
Telsey Advisory Group’s Joseph Feldman expects that pattern to hold for this month as well: He reiterated an Outperform rating on the shares and raised his price target to $430 from $390 on Monday.
POSITIVE THINKING: RISE RISE RISE RISE RISE RISE RISE RISE RISE
COST successfully erased all gains today for an entire calendar year. And you Kirkland junkies say it’s great! Wake up!!!!
COST is down 5.78% to 280.23
"Yippie, an up day for a change! Keep the Yule time spirit flowing."
Special div is probably holding the stock up.
Good guys keep it up. keep the selling values above 298
Costco announced $16 minimum wage yesterday....Does it equal drop in stock price or will not effect?
SHORT COSTCO
"Under 290.00 is a ""GIFT"" .........................wont last long ."
Buy BJ !
"big , that is one good post . keeping them up to date with honest information ."
Buying shares on the pullback. Hoping it goes to $215 next 6months.
Time for a huge special dividend !!!!!!!!!!
Train is leaving soon....................................BUUUUUUUUUYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Attention Costco shoppers: To the moon!
"Viral video clip in China, drove the stock to hit 300. Another great month sales number ensures that Cost will hit 320 before Oct 3rd. Picture is worth 1000 words, If COST's PR goes get a few more clips from China, sends it out the few network. If Oct 3rd, COST has any plan to open up store in China, jus2 a month. I bet you that COST will hit 350 by year end,."
"Now I understand...big investors like hedge funds like short term profits and if they don’t get the earnings report to their liking, they sell. If the earnings were as investors wanted, there would be no selling. So after they sell and put their money in other stocks, Costco will go up again and then they want back in. I’m in it for the long so not a bit concerned..great time to buy Costco now."
I brought-up the possibility of a COST split and all of the pseudo-geniuses here went out of their way to try and shoot the idea down. Now we see TESLA and APPLE both splitting so I guess it really must be a bad idea. Some of you need to wake-up and stop pretending.
I told you
$400 by September. Sales are accelerating.
COST is NOT in China! Hahahaha. BUY BUY BUY its headed to $300 only place to shop and get fresh food at cheap pricing.
Every December costconstocks drops a little. This year is a little more dramatic than usual. Around the January 5th or 6th it tend to start going in the upward direction . Hopefully this coming year is no different.
do we hear any special divs?
"Gordon Haskett Upgrades Costco Wholesale to Accumulate From Hold, PT Raised to $330 From $255"
COST is strong and will bounce back sooner than later. All the Amazon hype is clearly an over-reaction.

"COST can pump up membership to 60-70 million memberships within a 5 years. The number that I assume is very possible. COST makes profit around 14 %, I guess COST will beat WMT in a few years."
She’s going down
Costco up ah that's all the help of coronavirus... umhh... I wonder if costco has anything to do with corona... I personally saw corona at costco today.
I hate it when my business only makes 12% year over year. I should probably sell my business on this model. I fully understand now that this market is out of control. Crash is just a matter of one bad day.

"I don't own any Costco stock, but I shop there regularly. Wouldn't buy a thing from Amazon. I like to touch what I am buying. People that buy from Amazon, are just to lazy to get off their dead #$%$, and go to the store."
"Anyone short this stock? 31x for a mature retailer. I love Costco, one of the best run retailers if not the best of all American history. As a takeoff on $20 is $20, 31X is 31X . I can not believe this has a chance to outperform the market the next 10 years."
Just got gas at Costco and the parking lot is packed as usual
I'm agreeing with hairbag..$300 here we come
COST without Tariffs will be $320 a share. Remember at least a 5% margin hit due to Tariffs
"""Telsey Advisory Group Raises Target Costco Wholesale (COST) $305.00 ➝ $315.00 Outperform"" If you don't know Dana Telsey, she is an excellent analyst."

When do their monthly sales figures come out?
LOOK for theDIPS.
Cramer says Costco pricing is cheap imo even though i shop rhere. for some things is this costco is usualy 30 percent more expensive than lots of stores
I've held this stock for 20 years and still not selling
Looks like $142 is on the way. That was the low set back on Nov 4th of 2016. I will add if it gets to $145.
Love Costco 
AWWW... I'll pay lunch for all longies tomorrow. Sweet!
Well I am speechless Hopefully it will turn around. But today sure is disappointing.
why is this sinking?
This things going to 400 fast with expansion into China. This is a growth stock
"Start a small position at $280. Every where you look, it's like a post Christmas sales for stocks. That's the best time to build positions, small positions at a time since it's always difficult to find the bottom."
"Costco beat expectations on revenues. They missed expectations on earnings due to unusual increased pandemic costs, but still had better earnings than the year prior. This is a positive earnings report!"
nothing to sell with no goods coming out of China
Here come theBUYERS....................................
"Closing at the high of the day, I’m thinking another 1-2% gap up tomorrow. Great way to end the week and begin this weekend"
keep holding boys&girls!!!:)
"this is a beat just not a huge one, I think people are confusing the numbers and not accounting for the membership numbers"
The lines started at 4:00am at my local Wholefoods so that they could get their kale and avocados.
This is getting crushed today.
20 new hires per year per store is $20 increase in payroll per store
"Between the Feds. very positive talk today and crude report also today stating of a glut basically has indeed fired a Santa Clause rally.Then to have Costco earnings next month.... this stock is set to go up up up. IMHOAs I'm typing we're up $10 in 2 days, oh yeah, glad I got back in @ $220 and hope to stay the long haul as lots of concerns/fears are lifting for the market, (up 540 points today) and of course Costco."
This CNBC report on Costco is a bit long but probably worth watching if you are interested in Costco. I found this interesting as I remember most if not all the names of the various old stores that were mentioned in this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzejHGniMTQ&ab_channel=CNBC
What will happen now? Is it gonna go up or down!?
Wish I had more funds I would buy again! Tom give me some money lol
Frak Frak Frak! Stellar earnings... And this fickle flu¢king market reacts like this?!?
Who doesn’t have a Costco card? This is a gift at this price
This is not participating in the market euphoria today.
"You mean BUY HOLD and reinvest the dividends , you’ll be a millionaire x 3-4"
Going green today
Stockguru compares Costco to dollar treePut your helmet back on and get on the short bus
good bad?
Headed to 204.50
Even good numbers and guidance won’t shoot this up today. A lot of their numbers are baked in. I’m a buyer at $290 tomorrow.
Anyone invested in COST between now and ER will have a smile on his / her face
June sales are up big- verified
I guess they ran out of toilet paper￼
Costco is acting just like Nike did.Came out with a great quarter but lost right after earnings. Nike came back to gain 33%. I see the same with Costco. Glad I grabbed 200 shares at $339.
"Costco just happens to be in a bleeding market. Regardless of how well it is doing on sales, the effect of heavy selling throughout the market will temporarily overwhelm the amount of sales."
Ready for some short covering soon ????
"Is there any body cancelling Costco membership? I,m notHow often do you shop at Costco?At least 1 or 2 times a week.How much do you save on gasoline at Costco ? I save about $7 to $10dollars per fill up.Costco make most money from the membership renewal, do not worry Costco won,t go away, sit back and watch, if you have not sold your shares.Long term invested."
I like everything about COST except the stock price. Go up!
"Wow, I guess you can't fight the tape. I am out. I will wait until the funds get done dumping and then I will be back."
If they open more stores in China it will zoom.
See bargains everywhere bef X'masDIS and COST are winners
Its on SALE.....................its a steal..........................................
"I'm amazed at the idiots that posted here about not wearing a mask. The mask is not to protect you, it is to protect others , including the employees, from the idiots!"
I see a bunch of AMZN bandwagoners here. Amazon has never generated a profit. Pure hype.
I have to wonder if the orange guy has a big interest in a market boiler room!
I am sure Costco did not plan to open one store. This is just a pilot project and appears to have tremendous success. Many more stores will start popping in different cities in China. I doubled my investment yesterday. I think Costco growth will accelerate from now on.
China
Speacial dividend 
when do they report ? is it after the bell ?
Memberships up huge.good sign.
"Comparable-store sales, excluding the impact of fuel prices and currency changes, rose 5.6% in the third quarter ended May 12, above analysts' average estimate of a 5.48% rise, according to IBES data from Refinitive.ABOVE ANALYSTS"
think this result looks good Thumbs up. Bad Thumbs down.
China costs going to hurt. I think trading down to 180-190 soon
"sell before warren beomes dem nominee, whole market will tank 25%"
Order dominos stay away from the breeding grounds of stores! Governors tell you stay away from groups of 10 but when you enter any store theirs 50 deep in each isle.
I knew it..WMT IS A BETTER BUY
HAHAHAHAH
any chance of splits?
160 tomorrow.
Simply shows the intellect of trading in the current market place these days. With such crisp ER and a stock which mostly has average Vol and solid trading should not be falling this much AH. This is a sign of newbies investing with stimulus money and don’t know where to be at what time.Shameful and disrespectful to the stock this..
"Cost will be fine, that place is always packed."
Hey board how come there aren't option strike prices for March 8th over $225.00 and the $225.00 puts are up $2.45? That does not look bullish to me. What say you. Really more downside numbers than upside there. thats not even a 10% pop target price on ER beat.
$200-$220 by December - Smart money will be rotating to consumer defensive stocks till the end of the year like Costco to protect their gains without being completely on the sidelines.
one of the most overpriced stocks given growth rates
"Great time to add here , before nextBREAKOUT."
Why down
if Walmart buys Costco I'll quit being a Costco customer I wouldn't go into Walmart for all the tea in China
Implied move is +/- 3.2% following earnings based on the June 1st straddle.
Alibaba Venture Capitalists are buying COST shares aggressively now! The shorts better cover positions asap!
"We will end up today in my opinion I see a lot of growth still in costco , people might think they are late to the game when it comes to the cloud and technology but guess again. If you are a member that have everything about you, if by chance they have a recall on a food product they know you purchased that product and will call you and send you an e mail . Folks Costco is legit !!"
How the heck does target and walmart beat and not costco??? hahah
Yahoo continues to virtue signal by saying we are all bad people for driving the stock down because Costco is paying their workers extra pandemic pay. I missed that meeting appointment. When did we all get together and unanimously decide to trade this 3% lower? That's some epic level cooperation right there! https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-drills-costco-stock-because-its-paying-workers-2-more-an-hour-during-covid-19-172507787.html
Anyone hear rumors about COST being considered an acquisition by Berkshire? I saw Bloomberg article suggesting it.
"Expect a technical bounce back to 212 some times next week, that will be a good opportunity to get out because the fall from there will not be pretty"
This is such a sure thing and dividend to boot.
New target365.00
"Wall Street analysts questioning Costco for their $2 per hour premium to Costco workers while posting 11% ish sales gains is ALL you need to know about Wall Street and how the US economy works for owners rather than workers. Eff that analyst, I'll shop Costco more BECAUSE they take care of their employees."
COSTCO has been doing some IT upgrades it is just a correction. Chill
Sucks the market is rolling over. PANW did the same thing. Crushed earnings & slowly bled out the next day. See the same thing happening here.
does it really pay to be a long in a stock anymore..doednt seem like it
I love this guy who keeps saying nobody going to Costco... etc.. etc... you ever drive by a gd Costco. Always packed
"I am appalled at the naive people on this board. Costco is a great company but Amazon as already taken down some great companies like Nordstrom and Macy's and Borders. Amazon cuts prices and they won't care if they make money on food or not, because the part of their business which subsidizes the rest is the cloud (AWS). Actually, Amazon loses $11 on average per Prime member--just to get their business and loyalty and the AWS part makes up the loss. If you don't BOYCOTT AMAZON, YOU ABSOLUTLELY DESERVE TO LOSE MONEY ON COSTCO STOCK."
Indicators showing a market correction is on the way!
go baby go
"MM""s setting up for357.00-358.00"
Dan Nathan biggest losing investment advice on CNBC. Now he says to sell Costco. When are they going fire that guy?
Walmart is a better play. Online grocery is here to stay. Walmart beat amazon in online grocery over the past few months with 53% of all sales. Online sales have already doubled. Better PE ratio as well
Buffet & Cramer say COST is on a TEAR............................ way undervalued !OWN it DONT Trade it...............................
people are buying a lot of products at Costco. just in case
No doubt to see $400 next week.
This is MACHINE TRADING NOT INVESTING........................AAPL and COST= Just Own it do not trade it !
Notice how patient everyone is standing in line.
It went down 2% last earnings (Dec) and there was no coronavirus so why everyone is so surprised baffles me. It’s called a mkt
I believe the basics are changing I'm now looking for the fire escape.
"The market makers on COST love to shake out weak hands, this is not a stock to day trade. Buy it, hold it and you'll be rewarded in the long run.."
"This drop represent only 1% of outstanding shares after removing traders who are playing with the stock. So, it is meaningless and the stock will be over $165 by next few days."
Nice technical is forming. Higher lows and higher highs.$150.44 *** 07/24/17 ****************** $161.28 *** 08/217$151.33 *** 08/24/17 ****************** $167.07 *** 10/517$154.61 *** 10/09/17 ****************** $175.00 *** 11/20/17 (estimate) Good luck.

"When the recession hits, the Trump supporters will ALL become Democrats, overnight."
They are looking at considering another SPECIAL Divi........................................thanks to TAX CUTS.....................
Earnings blew the doors of the Analyst who give them high grades already! AH is some kind of big dogs jerking around because it will be going much much higher!Possibly a shaking by large firm wanting lots more shares?
Look for Stimulus $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ going intoCOST soon.

"Get this. I have owned Costco since the 1980's when is was Price Club. Never bet against it. I did once and sold some shares, and I have regretted it ever since. Period"

Kroger much better for shopping with lot more room to run. Warren buying Kroger (KR) selling Costco.
305 support
"All MAs go green, according to stoxline. Looking for breakout at 195.35 with a short term target of 228.17."
Dropping like a rock this afternoon. No more panic buying of 50 pound bags of rice and convenience foods.
the way the market is reacting you would have thought costco reported a loss ...
this action is ridiculous...
The Fix was in. Cramer and MM'S knew.
"costco,,,weak again in a huge bull market,,,stop shopping and buy stock"
"the Costco's are so crowded, huge sales numbers and many new folks."
"Expected AMZN, BABA and WMT to go up after earnings. They didn’t. I don’t see many signs this will be different. But by all means take the chance. Maybe it’ll be different. Cause it’s your stock this time"
Plenty of growth yet internationally
"looks like it is closing below $303, I hope you longs sold when I told you"
good earnings only going up from here
Special Divi. could be coming soon..............................................
They are going to crush earnings since everyone is stocking up for 3 months
"These after hours trades are done by scared traders and shorts. Those who buy now, they see a nice profit."
"wow,,,thats a big drop from the other day on nothing,, 168.75 from 172, in a day,,"
"Hey, I like to let you know that after special dividend is paid out, the stock price will go down as well. However, if you do the math right, dipping $10 for a $380 stock is not significant! If y'all have money to buy stocks to make quick bucks, go for those vaccine bio companies. bntx, mdrn, etc., these companies will give you quick money in matter of days! but Costco is for investment not trading."
"LOL!!! Funue is just pretending and Bert decided to just run away! (Clearly, Bert was the smart one!)[Amazing - the world of chat board pretend stock traders. Every board has 'em.]"
Wells Fargo said to buy COST today.
I SEE COST GOING GREEN !!! I have been telling you since the market open but you won't listen.
Why is COST down over $5 today?
sad weekend for COSTLY. I predict 140 by Friday..........7/8.............99 year end
You shorts are greedy man... company is still showing growth and you guys think it should take because a little miss? You might win some $ but it won't be much
Buy the Dip!
Still pretty high hopes that COST is going to rise. Anyways the price/sale number looking nice :)https://wallmine.com/screener?d=d&e=NYSE%2CNASDAQ%2CNYSEMKT&o=m&r=v&s=COST%2C
"Their business model is top tier. Chuck Munger, Warren Buffet's partner recent article saidCostco has something that Amazon and other retail revivals don't have. Costco deliveriesenormous retail Value. That is exactly why I have been a member for years. Also, I worked there overthe Holidays(this last year) as a seasonal employee. I worked as a stocker and the volume of turnover ofproducts was staggering.I feel the stock price is acting a little weird but thats how the market works. The market wants you toget frustrated and sell off, so the more experienced investors grab your cheap shares. In the long haul,Costco stock will climb like our Federal Deficit. Fast. Majority of what they sell is food related products.We can get by without toilet paper but food is a different story. Stay patient, you wont regret it."
bye bye costblow.
waiting on guidance
Thank you president Trump for protecting this great country Costco loves president Trump
"Never again investing my money in this even though I made some money today , better off buying target"

HUGE MISS ON EARNINGS. SUB $200 TOMORROW!
sold my 170’s total and all 20contracts for Jan 19/2018 for a profit of 98.70 good year folks.COST is likely to run to 200 by march or april thats my guess and that will happen inn feb if the tax bill passes
"This is not affected by the riots/looting, but how come it is not rising?"
Virtually no selling has occurred. Only one million shs traded so far. don't let MM crooks steal your shares. Going back to $245.
Due for dividend news this week or did I miss it? Quarterly 75 cents would get us to 1 percent annual.
NOV 30 2020...COSTCO WAS 391 ....TODAY IT CLOSED 323 3 MONTHS LATER. WOW !!! 68 POINT DROP IN 12 WEEKS. EXPLAIN THAT ONE TO ME. I KNOW....ITS A GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY. ITS A DOG.
Year-end profit taking is creating great opportunities to get into Costco!Do not miss it.
"I do not have a crystal ball and definitely not qualified to give any financial advice. Below what I observed and what could happen based on past numbers.On first day trading in 2021, Costco closed at $380.15. Since Costco advanced about 30% annually last year and last five years (including dividends), can we expect Costco to return the same amount this year? The combined Analyst Target in one year is $400.37. However, if we use $380.15 as the starting point, 30% advance would be $494.00+. $494.00 is a very high number. If we could advance half of that, it would still be $437.00. If I were looking for a buying point, I would go in about 10% below $380.15. That would be about $342.00. A 5% dip would be $361.00. Since my numbers are based on the first trading and the last trading days of the years, I am using $380.15 as a reference. I am long on this stock and yes, I would like to see this stock advance. However, I am not bumping this stock for a quick gain. I am just sharing some of my views."
You guys should be buying instead of whining.
"Option pinning, youd be crazy not to get in for calls for next week going right back to 350."
Nice DIP....... for buy opportunity.
I want to hear Nathan on mad money talk about how he bought put at like 186 saying it was over extended haha lose that money kidddd
COSTCO CEO----NEEDS TO GO AHEAD AND PUT OUT THE SPECIAL DIVIDEND SO GET THIS STOCK FLY UP ABOVE $400. HOPE HE IS PLANNING TO DO THIS MONTH OF NOV OR FIRST PART OF DEC TO MAKE THE INVESTORS HAPPY SO THEY CAN BUY MORE SHARES.
Ruh Roh
$305 today
for is Trading 25 below buyout price
"I will sell all of my shares today.This is turning to a garbage stock. With all the major index up, cost has been down 2 weeks in a row. I am out."
"Costco is not Cocoa Cola, but good for longer term. Too big as a takeover candidate. A pullback from here is likely, but it could run to $220 (where you will buy it just as it reverses to $180 to $190."
If it keeps dropping I would buy. Entry point 293
"Tomorrow the monthly sales number will be better than last month. May be it is the time to pay back. The Whole Food deal is overblown, may be the big boys just scare traders so they can get COST cheap."
Zacks really likes Costco
This will soon rocket up as u all sell lol.
I am getting tired of this flea called the Costco stock which I purchased for $303 at the onset of the lockdown and it has not made any substantive move. Now there is an earnings miss. I think it is time to get rid of this flea and invest in stocks which look more promising.
god bless this country. thank you oh great master leader wise one trump for crashing the stock market. maga!
This is still over valued by 10% needs to go down another 20 points
"They will report sales in 5/28/20There are many small business is closing down, due to cv19, Wall Street expecting too much out of Costco whole sales co.I personally think it's another chach up opputunity, for any body who missed out get on the board, COST will rise soon enough,they will not close door on us.It's war time, as soon as it's over you'll be too late, buy and for get it. Sit back and watch."
why is heading to 300. losing to Amazon every day. they have nothing special except at this store.
Definitive a BUY before earnings today. Plus Special Dividend coming soon!
"If you are not BOYCOTTING AMAZON, you (unfortunatley) deserve the pain costco stock is going through. I don't want anyone losing money in this world. It is better if everyone does well for the health of the individual ad the country,, but don't be naive about Amazon. They are out to kill everyone. Costco will be in the crosshairs."
A great day at Costco. They are limiting purchases and store racks are well stocked. Lines were only 8 people deep today. Great supply chain efforts! Proud to see what they have done to meet demand.
What just happened for the sudden drop?
upgraded to 320 .......
"With tax cut, earning disappoint? Heading to $180. Really bad."
"Worked for them 31 years. Totally awesome company. Only had 15 building's when I started, now over 750 and I think that 1000 is not unrealistic."
"Costco should announce stock split this time after 20 years since the last 2:1 stock split in January, 2000. With this price, I don't think individual investors like us, who don't have much capital to buy and hold long term when buying at this price. They may buy and sell for short period instead of long. With the split announcement, I think it will hold investors who want to sell, hold back instead and attract new buyers invest into it. Otherwise, institution investors can afford for this price."
"In the real world, I shop there. Went today. I still buy from other stores. Bulk size does not work for everyone. I buy quarts of milk, not 2 gallons. 5 gallon bucket of soy sauce is too much. Tire shop pricing is way too high."
a great time to buy
"Amazon is nothing more than the brick and mortar ""Five and Dime"" I used to visit as a child. Sorry, most of the stuff on Amazon is somebody else's unwanted garbage and oh let's talk about the generous less than 30 day return policy."
Pompouspeo milking his position for all it's worth - going on the grand international tour on taxpayer's dime before getting his fat #$%$ thrown out of the State Department. But we can all take comfort knowing that Jerkimus Orange contributed a grand total of $750 to the trip.
Costco Wholesale Corporation Reports August Sales Results. Results looks Good!https://investor.costco.com/node/22236/pdf
Told youBUY THE SILLY DIPS........................Sales up up up.......................................
few seconds to go green
550 shares! Let’s go!!!!
I have repeatedly told shorts that this isn't the time. I warned you that it was consolidating but ready to explode upwards again to $270. You better cover shorty.
Alright... I ve had a lot good feedback how Costco stock is overvalued. So my next question is...Where does the stock go after earnings?
Must be those damn gas stations! Cheers to Costco!
the sell off was a GOLDEN opportunity to BBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUYYYYYYY
Reviewed Costco's balance sheet after quarterly report. Reduced LT debt by $2 billion with cash on hand. Smart move from a we'll run company
"Same store sales beat, membership increase, eps beat, great prospects w opening in China.. don’t let te BS scare you out of your shares"
great er..high flyer tommorow... lots of green
"As the old saying goes, once you discover Costco - you don't shop anywhere else!!!Just look at the lines... Coscot is 340 under 6 months!!"
Getting ready to make a move soon............................................
Was going to load up if this sunk again. Missed the boat
this will go away
Sales has been increasing month over month. Special dividend paid because they made too much money. So far we are down 20% from the highs. Costco’s are jam packed every time I go there. This has to bounce on Friday...I’m predicting $350 in one week. It tends to move up after ER...slowly but surely. Way oversold...I’m betting my life savings on a rebound here soon.
This rocket is just getting started again. Today is the beginning of the downturn end.
Target increased 238.00
This is the best panic stock out there.
You guys did realize that Costco trading on Nasdaq did not go down like others today. Costco went down 6%- $20 on Monday as result of people selling ETFS that costco was one of the stock in those etfs.I took opportunity to buy more shares here. Costco did bounce up touching the 50 days Mawhich is bullish and this stock will continue going higher. By Friday or Before Costco will be Over $380.00. Lots of Options call interest in $380 and $385 play. Good luck to everyone. Buy on the Dips.
Amazon is turning workers into mindless data /AI driven minions Amazon is screwing the Planet big time by shipping millions of boxes with packing material.Costco is much better for workers and good humanity. Low prices and convenience is not everything.
"Costco for the last 2 weeks has been selling out of toilet paper and water. The stores door counts for every morning, exceeds normal Black Friday door counts. Sales are tremendously higher. Expect Q2 to hit way beyond expectation. As a vendor inside Costco, I can confirm this happening all over the country from my fellow vendors. We text each other daily with pictures of the insane lines to just get in to Costco."
Wait for the sellers to PANIC before adding more....................
"Getting my EBT check in a couple of days. Then after I overfill my shopping cart, I’m gonna demand I get boxes from those loser cashiers."
Barron's piece stated Costco Earnings Beat may not boost share price. Stated adjustment iminent.
"I wonder if anyone noticed that at 9:52 am the volume spiked over 141k and the price was at $370.57 on a downtick. Price went up after this trade. So, it appears someone executed a buy order. Take a look at the chart, this is clearly visible. At about $370, 141k shares is a lot of money. Any idea or speculation on what is going on?"
New 52 weeks low coming...
"Get out while you can! One step forward, two step backwards tomorrow! Tom is not buying enough to put a floor on the stock price."
This separates the men from the boys. Who's got the balls to buy and hold long term.
"common Warren, get the last bunch of your share out of the way finally will ya!"
I'm actually at Costco right now. I'm line for cheap gas. Then going in for some shopping and a hot dog! TGIF!!!
as long as it stays above the 10ema I'm happy.
"Judging from all the bullish sentiments on this board, this stock is sure to fall. Costco is overpriced!"

"for those of you not sure about the dividend..it will go down $10.70 ,on ex-dividend day...but might go back up with November earnings?..,probably not $10.70 though"
Way Overbought
Very disappointment with cost price. It seems never get back on anymore.
Gas - 2.09 in Central New Jersey! Boom baby!
Costco in the 280 - 300 range is a steal!!
is there hope? or is this just going to keep spiraling down
I heard that COST makes most of there money from memberships. Can anyone give me some color on that???
Positive ending for Costco is a good sign that next week should see this move much much higher.
"putting some more money im costco. Feel like market might correct, but not costco. also holding cash is not my favorite thing to do. costco is pretty safe. might drop 10%max."
I keep hoping for good earnings and guidance but it rarely happens.
"The bigger story is that they grew revenue DURING the pandemic AND paid workers more money. Still a higher EPS year over year. An EPS by a suit means little if they don't hit it. Higher sales, higher revenue is what counts. IMO"
"Wow, for long, today's price is really good and a bargain. This opportunity doesn't come often. Cheaper than usual. Buy more if you have some extra $ cash to spend. I don't know #$%$ willing to let go and sell their shares today. Perhaps the squeezed short sellers had to sell their long positions (COST, etc.) to cover their losses with GME, AMC, BBBY, etc. Anyway I bought some shares today."
300 calls looking so good.
Why is Costco down so much on the back of great July sales numbers? Can’t find anything on a reason . . . .
"the CEO needs to resign, or the board of directors need to oust him and the whole team"
"As the end of Costco's fiscal 2017 is near, it is important to bear in mind, Sales should top $125 billion, and earnings are tracking to be at record levels. Membership continues to grow, renewal rates and loyalty remain strong. Costco is increasing the number of warehouses, and expanding the number of countries it operates in. Costco is increasing it's efforts in growing it's online, mobile and delivery activities. Does the future look bright? Absolutely!"
Trump better keep his big mouth shut about COST. Its none of his business.
TA broken.. Straight to 120..
"Bought in today @279. Maybe not the bottom but close enough for me. I agree with KI Real, this too shall pass and Costco ain't going anywhere. Quality company with money in the bank.They say buy stock where you shop and some in my family are there 2-3 times a week even after the virus became a thing. No need to panic folks. They are strong and getting stronger. Can't imagine what their numbers will be going into 3rd and 4th qtr. with shelves being cleaned out so nicely. Hang in there......"
LOVE SEEING MY DZSI AND COST RUNNING
North of 300 I would start to accumulate
next to anc and gme this must be the hedge funds next toy
Costco is my most favorite organization. I have been holding their stock since 2008/2009 recession. There is no doubt if an investor considers further investing with more stocks at this price for LT.
Costco isn’t gonna make us tons of money but it’s relatively safe and steady. I have about 20% of my stocks in it and it’s in the middle of the pack and doesn’t give me a heartburn
"289 tomorrow, get ready to jump in"
Still haven't received the $10 special dividend in my Schwab account. Has anyone received it in their Schwab account yet?
It’s Oversold here...........
"Many here are looking for the huge pay out on the divvy. I might make a suggestion of buy the at the money 2023 Calls. You all know after a nice 2% pullback and a Special Divvy on the way that COST just gave you a gift of a discount as you ride to $425 by EOY. Who knows, with this pandemic shutting everything down, COST just might explode up there in a hurry."
Quick question - i have purchased stocks on Nov 30 and sold today in premarket. will I get the dividend?
this chat sux...no information at all
why is this flaming pös crashing after hours?!
Thank you China you deserve every bad event coming to you.
Going down
This is a serious joke where is the ER ?
$COST $JAGX bears losing strength
How can they increase wages when they cant beat earnings?
All stocks doing business during the darkest hour are punished today! After the stimulus and the feds run out of bullets this stock will soar!
Even if it did great its still gonna go down
The reason other stock going up is because they are heavily shorted. Hardly anyone shorting COST.
earnings out in 11 days..gunna hurt
looks like Costco going down again on tuesday already
"this was the talk of the town a few months ago..""recession proof"".pffffth this stock has suck the whole pandemic.."
"This is all about guidance. I went through earnings with TGT. They had a beat and nice comp sales, digital sales up 141% but after the initial surge she sold off. No guidance was given in the cc and WS didn’t like it I guess. Still struggling to get back to the pre-earnings numbers."
Amazon is not in competition with Costco................
This virus goes to show that people are generally irrational and basically scared little rabbits.
Why is it down ?
More photos going viral over the weekend
Will it break 200 today??
I lost so much money in this trash stock.. I’m taking everything back to return that I’ve purchased for the last 3 years
"Well Grimmikins, Costco beat earnings, trimmed their credit card costs and is planning on opening another 31 stores.Not bad for a place, that according a certain sailor-suited, Mommy-mooching sissy, is always ""empty"".It's getting harder and harder to cover that ""short"" you were bragging about back at $113, isn't it Grimbelina?How come you won't talk about that? Too embarrassing?L'il French fibber.............."
COST reached a new All Time High at 216.32
long term baby.
is there anyone knows when is the earning report
Bogle Investment Management L P DE Invests $12.86 Million in Costco
"thesedays, strong earnings are not good enough.. and i swear i can make any stock go down. :)"
"I was waiting for Courtney Reagan to talk about $DLTH on CNBC today, but she decided to talk about a small cap called $COST instead. She is very hot, that is appreciated."
in free fall
"Diet Ice Tea. In Feb. Costco quit carrying diet ice tea which was a big seller. Was 9.75 for 35 bottles, and was great.I think it was greed that caused this to happen. Now they offer an organic ice tea-----some concept, how can you produce ""organic"" ice tea, sounds like bs to me. Bring back the $9.75 cases of diet ice tea."
Finally some signs of life  
Nothing is wrong with $320. WS needs to be shorted.
300 - 305 Support
#$%$ !
Look for the SILLY DIPS here as BUY opportunity.....................................
Any word on $10 special dividend.
Doubled up my CNK just now. I also got back into $LL and $COST today! Still 33% in cash looking for more opportunities! I’d happily double up on any of these 3 with any weakness!
Wish I saved some dry powder for this.
Can we get to 200 today? Giddy up
"Still holding above my most recent buy at $157.00 which was a massive average up from the first time I bought COST which was decades ago when I paid $6.92 and that was before they ever paid a dividend, before Warren Buffett bought into the company. Not to worry boys and girls, even this too shall pass."
bought 25 shares @ 211.40.
Costco will report phenomenal numbers after today's market close
GOD DAMNIT! PRINTING AT $285 RIGHT NOW! MY FNNNKING CALLS ARE WORTHLESS!
Thank youfor my BUY order 288.70
"Blow thru $152 and go to $153....fast, no change for shorts to cover....then straight to $155 close at high of the day"
Time to buy puts!!! Loading up.
Ridiculous. giving the divident is like a communist gov is giving people rations but takes twice more in tax from you.
Just muted Tom. Who else?
I see $270 in the short term but shouldn’t hurt too much in the long run. Buy in low $270’s when they get there?
"BEFORE YOU SELL COST LOOK AT DIVIDEND AND FUTURE NOT SHORT TERM TRADERS-------And over the long term, Costco stock has been a winner. During the last 10 years, Costco's stock price is up more than 500%, clobbering the 160% return of the S&P 500 Index. The further you go back, the more impressive its outperformance becomes"

Price is too high for a wholesale retail.
TA broken. Fvckamentally too expensive ..
Headed back to $250
Costco has shifted from a value stock to growth stock!
Expect the stock to go up steadily till 310 pre earnings and 320+ post earnings
"Costco lines out the door in San Luis Obispo. Its like a new Star Wars movie, opening night"
I can see $286 in the near future
The return policy is out of control ...I think people are taking advantage...They need to shut that down.
COST is benefiting the biggest from surging China market! COST will be surging back from here!
earnings day is the turning point of three months dropping. need good news today. long
cheers
Would you recommend to buy COST shares for short-term or long-term? I love to shop walmart and want to purchase this stock but I am worrying about that it is possible to be going up more than now in future.
Costco is overdue for a split. A 4:1 split announcement on the 10th is a strong possibility.
next week when earnings come out Costco will be over 200 easily
COST gas sales way down. Large revenue is from sale of gasoline
Ridiculous price action today
Love my steady climber.
Pay $15 more to 'buy' a $10 dividend = JUST NUTS
looking for a dip
"if anything, I thing the concern is Chinese tariffs, 99% of products."
Definitely recession proof stock.$COST & $MSFT are both solid companies.IMHO
COST is at 163 it looks like the real deal
"Might need some sleep medication to put me out tonight, otherwise i'll be up all night. GLTA"
Industry leading growth. More cash on hand than debt. Wide competitive moat. Solid company and investment

"one of those days, market has no clue which way to go"
Can this price go down some more?
Costco will fare a lot better than most retailers during this virus event.
"How can you buy this over bj wholesale club, look at its marketcap, growth rate, better management.Long wtrh because of the june 16th meeting. Prty because of earnings next week. Dkng and Igt because both up 12 to 15 points next week once baseball deal approved early next week. They just got nba. The stock rocks monday off nba news setting in over the weekend from friday."
"so let's just imagine the rumors come true, and amazon buys Costco...what happens to the costco shareholders?"
Good luck to all of us

This stock will be $195 soon!!!
"WHAT A JOKE THIS STOCK IS NOW BECOMING,,,NO STABILITY TO COSTCO ANYMORE AT ALL,,ITS BECOMING A SHORTS FAVORITE STOCK TO TAKE DOWN SINCE NO SUPPORT IS HERE ANYMORE, market up again and COST falls big,, down from 162 to 156 in a day on a positive market,,,tells you no buyers yet all shorts and sellers"
"Cost is only down 8% from its peak highs. It's not really that much of a decline for long term investors ( buy and hold) . However, if you are a day trader -- gambler -- that is another story."
Costco is the best why cant they take it down more so i can buy some.
need increase annual membership fee to boost the stock price. let announce the change after earnings report.
I am in profit on my shares and calls. Should I sell before tomorrow afternoon?
I bought near $297; surprised by this move so started my 1st position in Cost ever; already own Amazon

Love to see $360 today!
"From the Motley Fool article on Costco's purchase of delivery service ""Costco relayed on Monday that it will fund the acquisition using existing cash on hand, which at last count stood at roughly $8 billion."" Sounds like it is time for a special dividend with all that cash!"
Members will soon be spending their stimulus checks at Costco on high ticket items. Cha ching!
Look for Upgrades soon.

TRUMP better change his TUNE ON TRADE....................................market meltdown.......................... RECESSION

"Costco around my entire area are always packed.. with next lockdowns, people are loading up again!From my last experience, I have noticed that buying things from COSTCO during the lockdowns is incomparable in terms of pricing and ease..

Yes we are in a recession and everything will go down. If you think increased sales from the past 3 weeks due to panic buying you shouldn’t be giving predictions to buy. Short term observations of lines at the store does not translate into this stock will break 300. WE ARE IN A RECESSION people. Don’t be a fool and buy at this price.
COST targets increased !!!!great entry here @ 160.00
Looks like this stock is hitting $300 very soon
COST is considered UNDERVALUED at todays prices !!!!Shorts gonna get burned..............................
"Last few weeks, you saw many people lining up to buy COST products because of panic on CoronaVirus. This will happen for another week, then by April, you will see people falling in line to return products that they don't really need. Expect a long line in the RETURN section."
"I think a big correction in the stock market is around the corner and a 10% will hurt a lot of investors, I sold this morning because the market is at it final stage of falling. ....So be very careful in dealing with this casino....."
Why COST keeps falling after earnings? It’s dropped 10 dollars plus since. Does this ever going to turn around? Why keep on shorting this?
"Costco is a great place to shop, such bargins and above average clientele that make the experience even better. Sample days are the best too, they don't scrimp like Sams club giving a cracker or nuts out. Costco is the best value and offers the best products to customers and they are always willing to make the customer happy."
up $10..sell today
Shop-Rite takes in more customers then cosblow.
COST target increased .Its a BUY here today .Amazon is actually helping keep the competition OUT of Costco !

Did anyone complaining on this board actually consider the SP had the good news already priced in? Great stock and company but SP has to be reflective of the business or it's just another Robinhood day traded stock going nowhere or shorted to death. Be happy for the growth and stop whining!
"what can I say? I added more to my long time position earlier this morning because this is one of the easiest buys. In my town, we can hardly find a parking spot at Costco. On the other hand our local Walmart looks like a quiet convenience store."
Blup blup blup down she goes. All u 2 bit hoes get out now.ha ha ha haha ha
"First there is Costco, a discount food store and then there is Whole food a high end food store that doesn't carry regular flour. These two stores don't even carry the same products!!! How in the world is Costco affected by Amazons purchase of Whole Food. Good chance there will be interference and the buy out might not happen. Not done till the Fat Lady Sings!!!"
We should see +$200 by end of the year.
"has anyone sold their shares? I'm holding mine, I think cost will be just fine"
Why would people sell today and miss the 7 buck special ? The stock for the special goes ex div on the 8th of MAy and the regular div goes ex on the 1o th of may.

"Motley fools , Jim cramer, they both put buy and hold rating on costco, most trusted recession proof company."
"Any company that sells with the quality of Costco, and also treats their employees decently compared to most other on-line and brick-and-mortar retailers, will thrive."
The recession has already begun... those of you who keep saying 'no recession' are simply in denial.
Money managers Loading up ON THE DIPS.
Ten percent correction should be enough. Market is broke. At least expected a run back to 50dma
Have people already received special dividend in their account ?

Take advantage of the SILLY DIPS.................. COST always pops back up !
"Kirkland is great quality for affordable prices. I see loads of people buying computer stuff from Costco, Lenovo laptops due to working (gaming) from home. This week great discounts on the Lenovo laptops."
Retail sales drop will take Costco down to 250. They are not selling anything that give them any margin. They don't make money on toilet paper.
SHORTS gonna get BURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRNED !!!!!
Break 320.
Its a cruel world in retail these days. Shoot and ask questions later
180's possible bottom
Now it depends on the market to decide that the number is great enough. I have confidence that the number is good because the monthly sales for the last three months exceed the estimate.
We’ll probably see huge store returns in the next month
No reason to panic but us shareholders appreciate it.
90% of stocks this year have had 20-30 plunge after earnings. Its costco’s and adobe’s turn. Buy puts and make money on the way down. Let the trend be ur friend
"New all-time @ 271+!!On the special dividend - many holders would rather they didn't do that. I know that they do it because they want to control their growth, and therefore have too much cash, but I would rather thry kept the $$$, as I will get taxed, with too much of it disappearing to the Feds and the State."
Hope next week is better for COST
"If you buy the stock BEFORE the ex-dividend date, you are entitled to the dividend. If you buy ON or AFTER the ex-dividend date, then the seller of the stock to you would receive the dividend. The seller of the stock to you on or after the ex-div. date obviously won't be in possession of the stock when the payout is made so ""possession"" isn't necessary. Ex-dividend means without dividend, so the ex-dividend date is the date without getting the declared dividend if you were to buy the stock. Remember, to get the lower tax rate for qualified dividends you have to hold the stock for about 6 months prior to the ex-div. date, otherwise it receives ordinary income tax rates. This is a type of penalty to those who buy the stock just to get a dividend. If you are in a low tax bracket or buying inside of an IRA then the tax treatment won't matter to you."
This negative reaction in after hours is beyond my comprehension. I thought the earnings call went very well. I just don't understand these haters saying that the beat wasn't good enough. A beat is a win in my book and a very positive thing.
"2 months ago this same stock was $393...,let that sink in"
SBUX or COST long term?
"back over $370 today, then settle in for a slow grind higher"
You can only keep a good company down so much... Wait for the rebound!
"Costco opened it's first location in France recently, after several years of red tape. Look for many more to open now that regulatory hurdles have been cleared"
"Went to San Jose Costco today, ,as usual can't find any parking..!"
"down $3.. expected better? sold earlier today to generate cash, but I'll buy back tommorrow..."
not much of a beat but red just bc of profit takers for now
I'm torn between buying another share or 200 hot dogs in the food court.
"COST ""upgraded"" again.see u230.00""ssssssssssssss"
If the special div. is not announced traders might sell.
"this is gonna keep flying, Costco in China a huge success with hopes to add more.....how can you go wrong with Costco"
"just accumulated more. whenever happens, Costco is there"
"Just to put in perspective, COSTCO has only one store in China and those folks are crazy about Costco - the growth prospects for this company is phenomenal"
"'Funue' - Sorry for embarrassing you but you have only yourself to blame. If you're going to pretend that you can determine resistance and support and you post it on a public chat board, you need to be prepared to explain how you arrived at your claims. Actually, I knew right from the beginning that you were just pretending but I wanted to give you an opportunity to save face and redeem yourself. You decided to dance around instead of explaining it. We all know that you had no choice because you really aren't knowledgeable about T/A. You and I are opposites but we are still alike in one respect -- you try to impress others that you're an experienced equities trader and me, well, I like to expose people like you."
HUGE BEAT! Congratulations to all longs!!!
Adding more to my positions on these unrelated dips.
"This security on it's way down to fill gap at 270.92 --- 272.70 from August 15th 2019, will be very swift getting to that price, most likely in the next 5 days."
insane how much Costco is crushing...
"I increased my position on the great news of their first China store opening. However, I haven't heard of any other China news lately. Any comments?"
Looking forward to $250 by the end of the year
never understanded membership shopping
"COSTCO is charging the sales tax based on regular price , not the sale price of all items it puts on sale for ONLINE PURCHASES.So if Costco has something on sale from $120 , to sale price of $100, it is still charging SALES TAX for online purchases based on $120.Costco is collecting this tax, is it paying this sales tax or profiting from it?Costco was INFORMED OF THIS OVER 6 months ago and continues to RIP OFF Customers online."
I wish I bought moreAm waiting for a pullback but it’s just going up the ladder...
willing to buy this over AMZN

I should own Costco
This is a blue chip stock. Everyone that shops there loves it.
Just got in at $367 :)
"costco probably isnt as busy as normal but at least they are making some revenue. maintaining, I cant say the same for other businesses"
PELOSI taking the USA into permanent Recession !
NO split just higher.
I think Larry finally truly blacked out. Or shot himself. We will see if he comes back...
Great entry here to put some $$$ to work !
"$400 soon, loading up"
"The $10 thing is ridiculers. The stock price is down 10 point, I lost lots of money, and yet I have to pay tax for that $10 dividend!"
Taking the 10.00 Special divi we are now @ 379.60
Hairbag is right unless it pulls a Nike and has big beat I doubt it
Crammer is a moron manipulator.
pre market up over $5...im surprised..with the dividend new I thought it would be a lot higher
"Brandon Fletcher, the analyst from Bernstein firm Downgraded TGT five months ago to hold at $75....the stock is at $108Upgraded KR to a buy at $24.13.....the stock went down to $20.99 a month laterLook at his track record. He's full of it!!!!!https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/brandon-fletcher"
Buy under300.00
I just bought 2 crumb cakes for $1.97 each. Where can you get that at AMZN.
$400 by year end.
amazing its holding up in this sorry market
"Costco is a buy and hold don't worry about it stock. It will continue to outpace the S&P. Buying the stock as a trading stock is not wise. There are many stocks to trade, and Costco is not one of them. If you own it, you just sit on it and it will grow. If it drops, you buy more and continue to add to your position. I've done this for 8 years and it's served me well."
"Been holding COST for over 12 yrs , always bounces back..........................................."
Would not be surprised if stock went up 8-10 percent in after hour due to lasttwo weeks of losses.
hx of cost is drop little after er ...last 2 er drops little but gained nicely up after few days .....
i would rather have cosco just increase their dividends a little
"In order to get the $10/share dividend u have to be an owner of the stock today!!! Stock gonna pop back up, mms trying to get cheap shares rn"
Love this stock long term!
Most likely up or down no more than 3%.
Love this stock!!!
"AHHHH THE ETERNAL OPTIMISTS !!! Everyone appears to be happy the stock is nearing 300, as it presents another 'great ' opportunity to buy. interesting logic. would imagine if it went to 200 you'd be estactic. let me ask this, you think Mgt is doing a wonderful job ? is there ANYTHING you might suggest they do to improve performance ? I mean, they went crazy over raising employee wages. is there anything you might suggest that they could influence the price of the stock ? say, oh, i don't know, maybe purchase back shares ? stock split ? dividend grant ? is there anything they could do to curtail the selling short that seems to be wrecking havoc on this stock. i mean, thats a 70 point drop in less than 11 weeks ANY SUGGESTIONS ?"
"$290.22, buy 100 more."
I hope U guys know that a vote for Biden is REALLY a vote for Kamala Harris. Biden will be forced out because he has Dementia. Then Kamala comesin and the country is DONE. She's a communist.
"my wish is where is costco to defend its company when its drops from 180 to 150... i am concerned that no one says anything,,,"
Cost getting it up the ask and WMT almost untouched. Go figure.
"if anything.... in times of panic and outbreak, first thing everyone floods over to is FOOD to stock up on. COST is going up especially with Earnings around the corner. "
WHEN YOU INCREASE MEMBERSHIP FEE...THIS IS A STARK FEE. BETTER TO REFLECT IT IN THE INVENTORY BY .50 CENTS OR SO.... MEMBERSHIP IS GLARING. IF THATS HOW THIS COMPANY IS SURVIVING THEN WE'RE IN TROUBLE.
Looks like $310 before earnings and then tomorrow we open at $290
$300 here we come
This is going to beat so nicely haha
COST is gapping up this week!
heading for green now!!!
Another buy op...add a little.
International markets are waiting on Costco.
THERE IS A REASON WHY THIS STOCK NEVER GETS SOLD OFF
Short now
"for all you people that want to be on the band wagon that costco is dead and amazon will destroy them,,Well never will happen,, now if an analyst has a lowered target to 180 from 190 only tells me its a buy and hold,,,take the dividend and a year from now we will see 175"
Bag holders stock
shopping at Costco is still the top choice for most people.
Any thoughts where it’s going ? Volume low. Keeping constantly under 296
"Buy the COST dip today, make some easy money this week if you do options at all. Buy 100 shares of Costco now, and sell a Jan 22nd $355 strike price covered call for an immediate $230 premium received now....plus make about another $100 to $200 if your shares sell of this Friday. Scale this up for every 100 shares you buy. You're welcome!"
Costco price target slashed from JP Morgan. This is going back to 200$.
"Grimmikins, old sock, old shoe.......you still ""loving that drop"" what with the $7 special dividend and the $3 rise today? C'mon, Grimmikins, if you're man enough to ""do my wife"", ""do Fonz's wife"" and who know how many more imaginary conquests, don't you think you'd be able to man up and let us know all about the $113 short of COST you claimed to have made but absolutely refuse to talk about? Nah, didn't think so. Sailor-suited, Mommy-moochin' sissy.............."
"Stupid people sell, Smart people buy!"
Adios! Had to bail out today. The bleeding just continues in a high priced stock. Too much dead money to just keep holding. Price of stock ran too high.
Costco clears $4 billion in earnings for first time amid record growth
"Why would any1 sell COST is beyond me, this will bounce back to $180 by next week ."
adobe is swinging
Over reaction to Virus makes another great BUY opportunity!
Told you! Once step forward two steps backwards. Sorry but true
bet these guys have trump dolls and sleep with them at night
It may looks like eke iut of gain today.
"If there were a Costco that was close to me, I would be a regular customer. I currently shop at WMT but I am partial to both WMT and COST. I love their deals and I believe both can compete directly without cutting each other's throats. Ultimately I have made a lot of money owning both companies and have also made a killing on TGT. These types of retailers as well as the discount retailers have a bright future, unlike the traditional retailers."
Bought Costco at low 40's I'm still not selling
DO NOT LISTEN to Markets !just buy on the DIPS..........................................
Oppenheimer just raised to $355
another corrupt big corporation giving money to terrorist groups
"Shorts gonna get BURNED ,as usual."
Just little patience.
this was at $170 last month! what a crazy market.
"The last time an analyst criticized Costco for paying their employees too much was in May 2007 so I sold all my stock in the company that day and bought a boat. My reasoning was that the analyst was a 20 something that couldn't find his butt with both hands and if a company is letting people that ignorant run important things, that company wouldn't be around long. Eighteen months later that company sold itself for almost nothing to Bank of America in a government brokered deal. Yep, that was Merrill Lynch's Costco analyst. The moral of the story is the analyst has an ulterior motive and could also be intellectually challenged and understands nothing except what the Harvard airline case study told him. Which will you do better with, Costco stock or a 25 year old analyst's opinion, that's the decision. I have no vested interest in Costco stock."
"Costco accused of animal cruelty for rotisserie chickens - read this article today. I am a vegan and animal activist. Regardless my love for Costco, I am selling my shares and will not renew my membership. Not necessary suffering:("
The costco stores smell disgusting like used tires and auto mechanics when you walk out from the register. It's very unhealthy to breathe it.
wall st expects too much
bought at 166.59 holding for earnings
Growing over 15% WOW.................... what more does wall street expect???????
Welcome to the retail panic party. Please leave your shares at the door while we watch FOMO kick in
Long term COST will be in trouble...Report saying nobody under 35 go there (millennials)...
What are you guys complaining about...........It's UP 10% for the year...........and that is what stocks bring usually.
"I had bought some originally at 151 and then again last week after the amazon news hit again around the same price. They are a healthy company and are changing some of the inventory also, furniture, etc.. They are also trying to improve e-commerce. I think it is a safe bet at this price, chart supports that alsoG"
Sigh. Going down slowly again.../
Expect a pop and drop
Price to book is 9.5ish.... PE 42ish.... Am I missing something? Seems awfully expensive still. Fair price in my eyes would be around $175 per share but that’s miles away.... Might have to put this stock on hold for now
"This is a brick and mortar store. (Being realistic very small e commerce side. They have uner 1000 stores, but let's say they added 200 more and got to 1000. At this valuation each store is worth 100 Million. Just a bit steep. Lot's of revenue, but very thing margins which makes them more susceptible to small changes in demand, or tariffs."
will jump to 375
"AMZN has no affect on COST's sales. AMZN only hurts the small grocery store like KR, SFM,Trader's Joe. Let's how the traders will react to the number. COST will need to spice up by raising payout or split stock."
"So... yesterday was too early to call for ""new 52 week high""? A little!"
Costco will be a $300B+ company some day. The China growth alone will fuel this company for years.
"In December Costco paid a $10 per share dividend, on top of its normal $2.80 dividend. The stock is very pricey at $350-375. I think the time is right for a 4 for one stock split."
"Huge beat and we get sell off. If this was amazon, google they would all be up $10+ in AH. But nope, we get dropped"
"It's green, look quick! won't last very long, LOL"
Costco fiscal Q1 EPS $1.45 vs. expectations $1.33.
"Low risk, moderate reward. A can’t lose stock. You just need patience."
No more stock splits coming Just up and up ...Buy Now or get priced OUT...Life lesson.
Continue buying on ANY DIPS here........................................
come on 246.00
Lets not be so stingy.Give the shareholders that special dividend.It would be a great present
Glad I don't own this #$%$.ha haha kevinb69.
Analysts say it will beat on earnings.
trump tweets...there is a deal
Im happy with 300 or more. Not too greedy.
COST roars as the new national lockdown kicks in again.
"the COST will come down some, maybe 5 bucks after Dec 2, but not $10."
s call started? whats going on ? Dividend boost ? buyback ? anything??
"IMO algos jumped on $COST as soon as the words ""Material Weakness"" hit the wire."
Trump to sanction China tomorrow over Hong Kong. Bad news for COST.
"Hey Grimmikins, at what price did you cover your $113 short? You're strangely (yet predictably) quiet on the subject.Sailor-suited sissy................"
Buying opportunity as it always falls post earnings then recovers in the next few trading days.Congrats to those who added at the $335 range as you will be rewarded.
"Costco is allowing people in line outside to be one on top of another ! Unlike Trader Joes, they spread out 6 feet apart with lines. Nobody wears a mask inside and out. The Virus is spreading throughout these stores. Just a matter of time the governor mandates a mask for entry or else, you get the boot ! I refuse to shop at any Costco until they regulate this rule."
COST reached an all time high at 274.27
"Due to the China brawl, the tings in stores and Costco as well are going up in prices.In restaurants, plate sizes have become smaller and prices have gone up substantially."
As compared to AMZN it is undervalued.
haha the games they play in after hours... up big tommorow...!!!!!

The markets should be green today after four days of beating and weekly options expiry. So we could see full swing .
Last chance to sell close to 225.00...rebuy when it has settled down. It is still valuable just rose too fast..
Costco is the place always packed with shoppers. The stock COST is the stock fit in as buy-and-hold forever. Don’t trust Wells Fargo. Buying more with today’s hiccup.
"the smart people sold this after the dividend , the longs are getting shafted"
why does this keep.going down??
Dividen would be Nice
Cooking  the books  ?
Down again; GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"The market makers surprisingly control the gap-up nicely, I admire them, because I thought this morning when I see the monthly sales number it should gap up at least 2 points. the number is very impressive even one day sales less."
buy all stocks that dip in this market period/ Especially the ones that miss earnings
"I am glad Costco is doing as well to pay their big dogs with the amounts of shares, they earned it, as I'm reaping the profits too."
Why is COSTCO going down at all. Makes no sense.
SHORTED 20K SHARES HELL YEAH
"BJ ten times better investment, the way AMC us undervalued compared to overvalued netflixozark seas 3 not ready yet, altered carbon seas 2 not ready yet, you season 2 not ready yet, what are they doing over at netflix? A lot of money burning for those top three not done. breaking bad movie sucked, the irishmen was depressing etc."
Why isn't this down more?
Walter... I thought $7 once per year and $0.5 every 3 months (quarter)... Am I wrong or it's $2 dividend per quarter?
Lackluster jump
e-commerce biz is on fire! the stock is oversold. I just don't get it!
When will they declare the special dividend.It's been a long time
Costco has proven one more time on a good time and bad time to go to Costco.
it looks like AMZN hit 1000 again...
Grossly overpriced. 36 p/e It should be selling for $150 a share.
COSTCO needs coffee. It is not moving
The begin of the end - comp stores sales falling.
cant get ahead on this stock..it loses as much as it gasins
do you guys not remember what happened last time
EARNINGS WILL BE A NON EVENT
"Here is my 2 cents to Costco longs. Costco cannot be simply compared to target. Being a technical guy, I compared their website values. When Costco site value is 418 M, target is 724 M. This mean target online sales is almost double of Costco . Costco ER will be mainly based on in-store sales and subscription. IMHO"
Why up $9 after hours
Was suppose to be only 4% and this is a huge beat.
Keep your eyes on uxin the china vrm and solo electomannica because soon both get a wkhs pop out of nowhere and valuation.
"If costco has PE of 15 like other retailer/stores,, that is $75"
Take advantage of this PANIC sell off COST is doing better the expected.....Loading up on any weaknesses............Target are 340.00-348.00
BUFFET says COST real cheap here........................
"costco is throwing people out that refuse to wear face masks. not sure of this will be good for business. its good policy for the virus but not for business. I havent been to costco, walmart or a mall in 1.5 months. Im sure im not the only do the road trips outta town. plus people are buying necessities and not clothes or electronics. food is low margin. I like costco but i dont think it will be a bang out quarter coming up"
Shop-rite has been and is cutting into costblo profits.Shop-rite sell fresh groceries while costblo sell old stale groceries.
The longer ppl shop at Costco the more they love it... the more they return... who is the competitor in this space ???
"Our beloved Costco, finally wakes up from hibernation."
revenue missed of wall street not from last year ..yoy 6 percent revenue high ..its a good reporrt ...
"Great company but disappointing stock. As the economy opens back up and the money flows into recovery stocks, COST may suffer more declines unfortunately."
"Loading up on ""weakness"" as the next leg up !"
"Analyst Actions: Oppenheimer Lifts Costco Wholesale PT to $400 From $380, Maintains Outperform Rating Awesome, most analysis see $400 coming, oh yeah!Next week new stimulus package, bucks in Americans pockets and all will be back up and well."
"Again :-( New SEF filling on Director.But I'm still bullish, wonder why toughhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000120919121003496/xslF345X03/doc4.xml"
Strong BUY from Cramer today.
too bad ole Warren Buffet gunna miss it
BOYCOTT AMAZON FOR THE HEALTH OF THE NATION.

Costco Q1 Earnings Preview: Comp sales growth lifts expectationshttps://www.google.com/amp/s/news.alphastreet.com/costco-wholesale-cost-q1-2019-earnings-preview-quarterly/amp/
Maybe its ne but I find it difficult to think that COST would raise their minimum wage to $16 and not report stellar results on March 4th. That would definitely not sit well with investors.
Wait 199.000000000000000000000000
"COST is not s sexy investment because the management is low profile however the bottom line speaks for itself, opening in China will give the stock a nice bounce"
300.000 is here............................
People still got Thanksgiving hangover! Wait until 12 PM ET to see real action!
It’s still crazy to see this in red. Almost all stocks are up. Hopefully we will see a power hour return. Don’t disappoint us. Even Cramer said it’s stupid to sell or short this stock.
"Costco is heading to 330 in a couple of months, of geoeconomic conditions remain stable."
Look for silly dips as great entry point.
Good but not good enough.
Remember COST always BOUNCES back !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!mark my words !
Targets are now over400.00
Come on SHORTS...................better cover soon............... told you the bounce back really hurts.....................
Why this is down
I had 25 shares at 346 but sold very early :(
COST is no AMZN so dont expect any big moves up. It rarely happens.
Shorts with deep pockets controlling this stock since last one week.
"I thought the March earning is outstanding, but no mercy."
Well lost my money on puts but will make good profits on the calls. wasnt sure which way this one was going to go so did both to hedge my bet. hope this price holds until open.
Simple math when some company pay more to employees that mesns they earn more hold tight till ER
Costco cashiers are the best! They keep the long lines moving fast and are very friendly and happy.
we r at 3 month lower ...god willing it will rise to new big high ..... iam seeing it pass 330 ..lets hope
"Costco's P/E is 34.xx, FORE!!!"
"Watch, Amazon will come out with some stupid news and drop Costco back down to 150."
Ughhh....I just woke up. What did I miss?
"Some contend that Costco is overexposed to the California economy due to having so many locations there. Well, 16 new openings planned in the next six months, and only one is in California.https://www.costco.com/new-locations.html"
grabbed more 500 cost share ..my average price for all my cost share is 286....
This is totally being manipulated by the market makers this morning
$155 good entry point today!
I feeling sure 
Boycottng Amazon yet?
I don't think the China numbers are included in this report.
"$45 in less than a month. Basically a 15% pop. RSI hovering in the high 77 range. If it settles below yesterdays high, well, then we have a haircut coming IMO. Sold my options today at the $380 mark. Enjoyed a nice 45% profit for only 3/4 weeks thank you mister market. Its going to $400 by Christmas. Waiting for the breather to reenter."
a lot of talk about a special dividend that will never happen but if it did..coctco should award it to the people that didn't sell st earniings
CNBC BUUUUUUUUUUYYYYYYYYYYYYY
"just buy it! I don't believe in ratings OPP because it is all BS to press the stock price to go down, then buy all the weak hands and hand to some big funds as usual."
Not much time left for shorts to start covering.
Target just offered same day delivery for $9.99.....competition is getting fierce!!!!!!
"Costco is cheaper than Amazon, but Amazon has the reputation of being cheap. BOYCOTT EVERYTHING AMAZON, THE COUNTRY CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE ALL THE GROCERS, ALL THE RETAILERS GO OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE OF AMAZON."
Wow should of moved my $$$$
Stock price turns on a dime. Why so turbulent?
this is just manure...
nice
COST = recession proof.................................BUY here........................ its way undervalued !
this has already did a $7 turn from pre mbarjet
"Wouldn't you feel like an absolute moron if you had shorted this back when it was $113? Nope, not if you're a geographically-challenged, rubber duck-sailing man-child that's failed at adulthood and had to move back in with your Mom and brag about a ""yacht"" in the south of France.Particularly when the ""yacht"" is a four and a half-inch yellow quacker and the Med is an American Standard, right Grimmikins?"
Sub $200 tomorrow
"Costco reported great numbers, that's why it's up"
Targets raised !!!!!!!210.00
learned my lesson from $KR not to hold thru earnings or buy options in anticipation of earnings
I dumped all mine aftermarket. Don't need to wake up in morning 8% down.
well that was a pretty good day. the only thing that could have made it better was if costco announced a special dividend coming too.
It’s not normal
Amazon latest news = OVER Hyped !!!!!
Did they raise the guidance?
"Could have waited for $280 but very happy I bought some extra trading shares @ $295 last week.Holiday earnings were good, Earnings on Thurs. will be great and next quarter will be fantastic due to these extra sales occurring. Couldn't feel safer owning a bunch of Cost shares.!"
Mostly trading inline with others in the sector. Short it or dump it but..... 'show us'.
"Shares will remain relatively static until November sales are reported and whether sales growth and net earnings exceeds expectations, is in line with expectations or fails to meet analysts expectations. Any thing else is pure speculation."
didn't see this coming
Sams club closing stores Costco is going to boom!
The market sure seems to like Costco at $300/share
My guestimate is July sales will equal or exceed June sales as far as %age increase.
Sales up up up..................................
Costco upgrades
Reckon investors will be happy with 8% earnings growth next year?  $COST https://simplywall.st/NasdaqGS:COST/costco-wholesale
Will traffic in the stores be down over this holiday season due to less large gatherings?
356.00-370.00 range..................wait for short sellers to bring it ON SALE......................................
"Time to buy COST, Oct 04 again. I am quite sure that COST number will beat the estimate, becuase of the Aug sales is so great."
I'm anti businesses donating my actions. We were great Costco fans. Out until the mask order is lifted. They make decisions and so do customers. If only 10 percent of customers are liked us they will see serious declines.
We could close in theGREEN.
"COST is not going to go down forever. It is one of the best run companies in the world and the business model is rockstar material. The stock price will eventually reflect this again. Wall Street doesn't always reward the great companies right away, but sooner or later overdue recognition always comes. Therefore, you should be taking advantage of these prices. Several years from now your wallet will thank you."
Stock will be stuck in this range for a very long time. They are still managing covid-19 instead of their business. our store still does not have food samples and half the food they used to carry in the food court.
BUY on these dips.........................................
"you think I'm joking, but if Biden wins..$300 coming"
BUYING on this dip.... COST is a solid performer with great guidance and NO china exposure.
"Gotta say....I have NEVER seen strength like this....just INSANE!!!! Even watching PG, WMT and MDLZ.....all just like COST................who in their right mind would pay the extremely valuations here with minimal yields is beyond me? Hope this BS about a trade deal crushes them next week!!!!!!!!."
Thanks AMAZON for the cheap COST shares today !we LOVE you !
$100M+
"I sort of wish the Costco I go to would raise membership fees just to thin out the parking lot a bit. It's like Christmas just about anytime you go. Like the store, like the stock."
COST is falling like a rock this morning. New downgrades out this AM. Amazon Prime day will have their stores empty this week.
303.00 my nextBUY order..........................................................
Bit of a over reaction on the sell side. Sales up 10%??
CNBC shows an earnings miss of .06 but the news release says they beat by .04 which is it?
PE still too high ..
"Barron’s says earning beat, yahoo says miss!!!!!Barron: “Costco (ticker: COST) said it earned $1.89 a share on revenue of $37.3 billion. Analysts had been predicting earnings per share of $1.85 on revenue of $36.55 billion.”Yahoo says analysts were expecting 1.92!!!"
"I will happily take the $10 special dividend. As a long term holder of COST, the qualified dividend has a 0% tax rate up to I think $77000 in qualified dividends/ capital gains for married couples not in the very high income brackets. COST will recover the $10 reduction in price very quickly IMHO. We will not have to sell stocks with gains and buy them right back to reach that threshold."
"Analyst Actions: Cowen Lifts Price Target on Costco Wholesale to Street-High $410 From $370, Keeps Outperform Rating'$400 is coming for sure."
I love the way they sandbagged with the sales report. Earnings are going to blow sky high with such a low expectation.
Is the drop in after-hours because of the Fed rate cut?
"ER should be good. My fear is a lot of people will seek off after hours, but I hope not."
Trump will outlive all of you.
slap my test icles!
I am a long time Cost￼co investor. But I sold 75% of my position today. Costco is over leveraged in CA. 26% of the stores are there. 30% of net sales come out of CA. The WSJ’s detailed reporting on the CA power blackout’s persuaded me to sell. Let’s hope I am wrong
COST + WALMART = a great way to kill these shorts.
Thank you for the dividend!
"This stock is way over sold. The three Costco in my area are always crowded. With the holidays just around the corner, this stock will recover and move higher."
Take some profits herejmho
BUYERS are coming...................................
Price should be cut in half unable to deliver timely small parcel deliveries.
Costco can't grow...if you can't grow over time... there is a high risk you get outgrew by someone else
HUGE BEAT! A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!! $$$
No matter what happens people need food !
"Low margins, low customer counts and a lousy online presence is not the way a warehouse club prospers."
"Tug of War, between BULLs and bear."
Under 250 coming. For no Good reason.
Those 74% large institutional holders are really sitting on their hands recently causing a little bit of a lock down even while the S&P is going up. Just a few hrs. from earnings... and the truth be told and they will react! Still believe we go back over $250 for good!
So now we know why Warren sold Costco... conflict of interest with Amazon.. he is rooting for Amazon and now they announced a pharmacy store.. Warren employed and where he has big share holding will all be directed to Amazon health ...via the newly formed health Insurance for them
Time to reorganize upper management.....
Can anyone shed any light on what costcos dividened will be quarterly after the special $10 payout?
"This is the time to jump in, not out!!! It has over 15% correction already. Don't expect more."
"It is now time to start moving 401k's out of the market. Time for the people not to get screwed over by Wall Street for once. Sell at the top and not at the bottom. My recession checks are showing all the signs of people stating to hoard money. Move your 401k's to safety Sell at the top for once , If things change you can always move back in but you can not always sell at the top"
COST will be green by the end of trading tomorrow
COST targets increased !!!!!!180.00
Monthly Sales will be over 6-8% again. Let's see that how the market will react. I just bet COST only tomorrow both monthly sales and earnings report. I BELIEVE IN COST.

Costco just keeps rolling along because everybody who shops there loves it. Right now in the 350 price area be patient 400 easily.
let it drop more pls market!!! so we could get some at a discount
"Costco rocks, both short and long term!"
I lost 1400 dollars on this pig. Bought 232.5 calls just before earnings for 2.8 dollars each. Sold them at 2 cents today morning. What a horrible !
Remember COST always bounces back...........................lower it falls the HARDER it pops.
Who says COST isn't poised for potentially massive upward movement? Not sure how awesomeSTO-CKS finds all these incredible trade ideas but im happy.
DTRAIN: I’m long into earnings .  oh boy
up 5 dollars already
Costco break out happening. 420 by 4/20
SELL AND SHORT TILL IT GETS TO 324
"Costco just needs to keep building bigger parking lots! Love this place and apparently so does everyone else. Sure I spend more money than I should, but I leave feeling good about it. They have a business model built for success!"
Wall street head hunting retail. COST is now on radar for a scalping. This is a bear market and all stocks get mauled. COST will be taken under $200. Going to buy back in then.
Just a blip. Monthly sales were a bit under someone's spread sheet number. The stock has run from 10 to 220. Don't be upset when large holders sell a bit because the dollar amount of their shares has hit their limit. I have trimmed three times for that reason. Lots more gains to come.
Who is being punished because Costco missed by fractions and why ?
the cheaper it goes. the more I buy.
"Time to load more shares. The drop is just temporarily as profit taking or funds reallocated by the money managers. As the dirt settles, the rain stops and the sky will be blue again. Costco businesses are amazing as customers continue to go there."
"Actual earnings are 2.55 vs expected 2.44 it’s a beat !COVID wages are only temporary.Costco reported earnings per share of $2.14, which included 41 cents in costs incurred from COVID-19 premium wages, the retailer noted. This week, Costco boosted its starting minimum wage by $1 to $16 an hour.E-commerce surged 75.8% during the quarter versus a year ago.Comparable store sales came in at 13% for the quarter, with comp sales in the U.S. growing 11.4%, while Canada and other international grew 13.4% and 21.5%, respectively."
US economy continues toEXPAND !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! COST is considered cheap here.jmho
Shorties better start to cover.........................told you COST and AAPL are a must to own !
Initiated position in COSTco. I shop there. Strongest Brick and Mortar brand around. Will buy more on drops.
no green even possible
This will be $230 by Friday open
"Higher high and higher lows for the graph, it looks like bottom has settled in for Costco, Waiting for May 28, 2020."
I’ll buy at $120
Sell people sell so I can buy your shares cheap.
Warren Buffet is buying COSTCO...
"Soo nice to see Cost has disconnected from following the herd mentality, not doing the large swings with the rest of the market as in Dec.. Costco should hold it's own because of it's individuality and strength.Today it would have done $5 swings rather than $1. I LIKE IT!"
Costco will be at 300 easily by the end of the year
"did everyone sell, no one is in here"
The fear factor has just started. The virus is spreading in the US. There is nothing that the govt can do but shutdown cities and since this is not China it wont happen.

"I love it, Costco running up again while outpacing the S & P"
"Still hoping for a special dividend, right now just an increase on a quarterly dividend"
choo choo!
Up $15 in just 2 trading days!! Soon all will wonder what was behind the past 3 month long sell off that occurred ? Laughable!!!
Averaging up and scooping up more shares today. Costco is an incredible company. Doing the right thing by taking care of their employees on the front line during this CV-19 environment. Customers are extremely loyal to their brand. $400+ by year end even with a market correction.
“what looked like a massive earnings beat was actually an earnings miss as the results included a 17 cent a share lift from the new tax reform plan.”
"all dfodq milk sold out in costco. dfodq going to shoot up $5. every super market out of milk, covid-19 just start in usa"

"not sure why guys like Tom think this is a great stock? it's really not, I think it's at its peak..it has its spikes..but the very next day the spike is given back..were stuck @$295-300...and that's it"
It behaved like somebody either have hold put option or sold calls and needs this to stay low. Interesting to observe to see how long he can do this.
"My 1st position here on Costo. Been wanting to buy beat myself up didn’t buy it last wk. paid more today...hold forever now. Finally, made the move feeling very BULLISH"
Im not sure why the employees deserve more pay. They basically fill the shelves with a lift. There is very little customer service needed.
COST always Bounces back................................buy the dips here..............................................
I will hold until next Thursday when COST reports the monthly sales.
COST online salessoaring ! no need to travel to the store to buy groceries !
connsinc earnings call 11am. get in this stock fast
Best company in the world.
I keep reading about a special dividend...its not going to happen ok
Hopefully stock drops on earnings. That way we can get a great company at lower prices.
"An increase of 6.9% for August, 7.0% for the fourth quarter, and 7.9% for the fiscal 2019 year in sales over 2018."
"No food court, no samples, get in, get out feeling won't help store sales. Used to love Costco, Time will tell."
Analyst Karen Short boosted her rating on Costco to Overweight from Equal Weight and her price target to $400 from $330.
I would think there is a good chance that this can finally go back above 230+ after earnings next Thursday.Any thoughts?
"As a current Costco employee (supply chain) I can vouch for their efficiencies, above average wages, and overall strong business model. Their moat is wide, and not as vulnerable to wage pressures as other major retailers"
during the peak of the pandemic..this was a normal earnings day
"Costco is cheap at these levels, nice momentum today. A new high is on the horizon"
Sales up up upover 9.0%
Hairbag. How many shares you own? 0.67 share?

So crowded in Costco these weekend!
"selling is way OVERDONE !!!!!Costco is in NO competition with Amazon or Whole foods, they make their $$$ from memberships not groceries.........."

"Get ready for it... Trump is going to drop Pence and place Ivanka on the 2020 ticket as his VP running mate. Hopefully, the Dems will keep the House and take the Senate. With both Houses, a win by Trump in 2020 will still result in impeachment and removal. And the Dems will remove BOTH Donald and Ivanka!Nancy Pelosi then becomes America's first woman President."
"Beat by $0.29 on earnings even with covid costs of some $200M. If it dips, I'm definitely buying more."
"Analysts are just upset because Costco didn't announce a Special Dividend when the analysts were clambering for one. One of Costco's code of ethics is to reward shareholders, which they have done in spades. But COST management will never reply or react to Analysts comments because that would simply turn COST into an analyst yoyo plaything."
Will keep buying more from the WEAK HANDS. Thanks for the 500 shares today :)

I really don't see AMZN taking out costco. No reason for the selloff.
STOCK HAS DROPPED 40 POINTS IN 3 WEEKS. I'M PSYCHED !
"I’m an amazon shopper all the way. But the experience is different when shopping at Costco. There is room for both. Costco is a great company, and now being sold at a discount :) And it’s based on overreaction, not fundamentals."
Full steam ahead.
"which is it,,,is costco too high or too low,,,,, they claim in the stupid article its over valued"
Costco looks like a good doomsday stock to own
I'll sell at $312-$314 next time it hits that range but I feel $325 is possible. Not much risk of this falling back more than 7% so reward is greater than risk. I'm still holding my $281 average 2 week position.
I have Costco membebship. but I found myself shopping more at FredMeier (part of KR) If KR pe is only 12..I don't see why COST deserves PE of 27

Costco needs more love hopefully the market doesn't drag it down after earnings
BUY the silly dips.........................................
Wed. is the last day to collect the divvy. I expect investors to pile in tomorrow and to catch the wave to $300
Wall street is mad because Costco is paying their employees 2 dollars more during covid? At the same time making record profits. You can make this stuff up!
COST: may clowly inching to 300$ for option expire today
I’m concerned with less gas sales and more payroll for sanitizing. But hopefully Costco surprised me
Maybe the whisper number was higher. The stock is overvalued too.

How about a special dividend? It’s been ages since we had one.
MASSIVE BEAT!!! CONGRATS
"Common.... October 4th, great earnings report and break the all time high once again OH YEAHHH!!!!!!"
"Hey COST faithfuls, I know it has been tough watching this stock fall down day after day which IMO makes no sense. We have the earnings call today and I would not be surprised if it went even lower after that despite good results. I owned a lot of ETSY stock last year and after a great earnings call in the fall, the stock plummeted 12.5% next day. Made no sense and lot of people sold. A week later it took off and never looked back. I am glad I did not sell and neither will I now on this temporary senseless dip by COST. If you can’t watch it anymore, just stop following it and come back in a month. You might be pleasantly surprised then. Have a great day everyone."
I guess we’re still paying for their holiday website glitch. Very impressed with their new application...assuming it’s new. But this down everyday is getting annoying
268.00 today !
Long term I'm very bullish on Costco. Just bought a Jan 2022 $400 Call option. Should be an easy double within a few months.
I see Costco stock did not split since 2000. Is it time?
Earnings in 2 days.... Earnings - Dec 10 AMC. I see Costco is always full !!

"I'm not sure this can be called investing anymore, its more like getting slaughtered..doesn't seem like anyone is interested in this stock anymore..once the best stock to have in your portfolio"
Headed to 200 at the close.
Who actually sell this stock lol some dumb people out there
Time to raise the price of hot dogs...
"Costco is a great company. If you like your portfolio of great companies, BOYCOTT AMAZON. Prime is automatically renewed if you don't stop it. Amazon gets away without having to show much of a profit because they are a growth company. Lots of companies will be hurt with Amazon getting into groceries---the food stocks--because Amazon will eventually have store brands, drug stores because they will have a pharmacy which Whole Foods doesn't have now, grocery stores, retail stores and in Europe, Amazon has checked out getting into used cars. It is time to BOYCOTT AMAZON. i WON'T BE BUYING ANYTHING FROM THEM."
Where's the bottom? When is everyone jumping back on?
"This might be the only thing Buffett has got right in the last year, lol. wow, dumping this was smart."

3% growth for February
"this will never ever hit $380-400..it gains $7..then loses $6.,gains $3..loses $2..special dividend won't happen"
Not loading up on the beat down to 270’s was a glorious MISTAKE
I wonder if they are still going to issue a special dividend?
"Hmm, can I get this at 290 tomorrow?"
"The so called earnings miss came from paying more to their employees, so what's wrong with that!"
So like is $201 still game?
"Its not COST. People are buying tech and new sectors - weed, bitcoin, EV, etc."

Love the SALE price here..................................
Oh gosh! Sold too early yesterday and totally forgot about the dividend day is coming. What a dummy I am!!

I sold Netflix to buy Costco. At the moment I'm not sure that was the wisest move. Personally I love Costco as a store and go there as often as I can.
I don't understand how the heck Costco stock keep dropping when every Costco everythings are sold.istock should go up.
its Friday...that means costco sell off day
"Downgrade? Um, ok. Is that’s the reason I can never find a parking space and fight through the aisles in Costco? I better load up my shares at Macy’s."
Will it go down to $100 per share?
"Our Costco was packed yesterday by 9:30am when I arrived. I spent $475 just on staples (meat, sundries, etc.), no big-ticket items on this trip. Staff spraying down carts, lines orderly, everyone masked, no idiots, no anti-masker morons. Every time I got to Costco, it's packed. Every time I go to Costco, I spend on average $560 (not counting gasoline).Why buy propane anywhere else when it's nearly half-price to any other provider?"
"just looking at premarket, it's another good time to buy"
"Say what you want but I just got back from my local Costco and it was packed as usual...yeah Amazon cuts into some things but produce,meats, fish, bakery etc most people want to see it before they buy it ...and at Costco they have great items at a good price...so my own feeling is that Costco will be just fine going forward...this is a good change to get more shares."
They got rid of Polish hotdog at food court...and customers are cancelling their memberships like crazy! Sell sell sell!

"OMG! Costco is on fire!!! Like a idiot, I sold 1/2 my shares of Costco in June 2016 to buy a new company vehicle instead of selling my equal shares of UNDER ARMOUR stock. I thought UA was the better long term hold instead of Costco...Now look at the stocks. COSTCO is a big winner and it's a matter of time before Under Armour fades into the wind like old sneaker company Reebok..... I think Im ready to pull my shares of Starbucks and air drop them into Costco for 2018....Those special dividends that Costco hands out like candy is sweet.."
I bought more Costco stocks today. At this point I am just waiting. So far this stock is a joke. However I have been only following it a couple of weeks. Most of the days it has been going down. I love Costco stor but I am not sure about the stock yet.
buybuybuybuybuybuybyub stonk stonk stonkington
Costco is too big and great to succumb to amazon. The Loyalty will always prevail. Keep buying more shares you'll keep getting rewarded. I hope the bleeding isnt too bad this upcoming week.
Why buy a stock at 36 times earnings with a 1 percent dividend ? Grossly over valued. I get a great company. Just don’t see how people can ignore some other stocks trading at 4-7 times earnings paying 5–6 percent like many financial stocks that are half price or better right now. Crazy.
"You know why it's going back up? Because I sold and cut my loses. Always happens like this. I should have read the charts and kept emotions out of it. Sucks...This was my first loss in 2 weeks of trade -_-. Stings quite bit. It just shows you no matter how long you've been trading, you can still panic."
this stock is sick. money would be better off put into a tech stock for a rallying ride today.
Buy and hold until death due us part.
"We are almost there, green please"
"If you do not already own COST, you will be kicking yourself a year from now if you didn’t buy this dip. Just look at the long term chart and consider how many were made wealthy by simply holding (gratefully)."

"Agree. Cost is not a get rich quick stock. Rather, it is stable, strong and does what needs to be done, and then some, to be competitive and advance. It has done a great job in satisfying its customers and sustaining its good brand image.￼ Anyone I’ve talked to about cost, regardless of their economic status, has had a positive attitude toward cost and no criticism, except for parking!Solid, steady and smart is how I would describe The performance of this company. In my view, that equals a good investment.￼￼"

Don't count on Costco's success in China. No warehouse/membership type of operation has succeeded in China in the past. It has been tried many times and failed each time. The Chinese market does not support that type of model.
I am gonna hang onto costco co. for awhile and sell them all. losing all the dividends -10 plus extra -10!!! RIDICULOUS!

"costco shares are not to be compared to what the company does,,,fools chase price of stock,,the company has no give a damn about the stock because they sold it already to you a long time ago"
This stock is still up over 6% YTD. So don't be surprised to see go down further
"COST reports an excellent quarterly earnings and investors immediately throw themselves over a cliff and start dumping stock as if it were toilet paper. Alt this out of fear that Amazon was going to completely swallow every brick and mortar store in existence Just unbelievable. And I used to think I was a novice investor. Not any more. Folks, I want you to keep selling. I'm ready to pick up a few more shares at bargain prices. Thank you for your help."

"I LOVE ""MY"" COSTCO SHARES!Costco is huge and will keep growing as the stock will also soon enough."
"Sellers might come, RSI Divergence"
Earnings are going to be great. They also made a ton of sales through e-commerce￼￼.
this stock is about to get annihilated tomorrow. i expect at least 10-20 point drop tomorrow after earnings.
I wish Costco would come to the villages. 150k senior citizens would pack the place
"I shop at Costco not everyday, but I,be been spending, most of all the shopping needs from costco, and I get 700-800 dollars in rebate, the only place I put gas in locally is Costco,because I know they have best prices with top tier gasoline.go long on costco, Costco may buy out the bj grocery chain,IMO.give me a thumbs up of you agree."
"Who Is Overvalued?Analylists claim Costco's PE is too high. Let's compare the facts:Amazon PE = 188.66; Costco PE = 26.56 (ten times is bargain territory)Amazon EPS = $5.31; Costco EPS = $5.76Amazon Dividend = 0; Costco Dividend = $2.00 (1.82%) plus surprises!Costco sells gas, prescriptions, liquor, glasses, cars, insurance, lunches, etc. It's hard to even compare the two as they are diferent companies. If anyone wanted to compare Whole Foods, Walmart, Kroger's etc. are more comparable. When a person goes to Costco it always offers some surprises that you can, touch, study or eat. When you go to Amazon it has great variety, but is purely an online experience, not a personal experience. I fail to see everyone deciding to buy groceries you cannot see in person.There is a place for Costco but it does not appear to be in an Amazon's world."
BIDEN was raised inside a closet !
"Whole foods products seem overpriced to me. Not sure their customer service is worth the extra cost. COST on the other hand has fantastic customer service, great prices, full parking lots, and is in the middle of building a new store. I'm sticking with Costco"
I had to buy a couple hundred shares. How could resist this discount??!!
Trump and Powell are both CLUELESS..................................................destroying global markets !jmho
"pandemic is finished, COST is finished- everybody is cancelling their membership, - the only way they make $"
Sales are doing GREAT !
"There goes my kid's education fund, guess he'll be working at Costco soon, good thing they pay well."
You can see COST weakening...it cannot get back above $267.20....I think the top is in....just waiting for over valued PG to finally give it up.
COST sales up over 9%Target sales DOWN...................................
only thing left are bag holders...
"THEIR SOLUTION APPEARS TO BE INCREASING THE YEARLY FEE. THIS IS TOO GLARING. BETTER TO INCREMENT CHANGES IN PRICING SAY, 3 % RATHER THAN ANNOUNCE $35 INCREASE IN YEARLY SUBSCRIPTION. ONE IS ABSORBED, ALMOST HIDDEN, THE OTHER IS JUST TOO OVERT. TOO GLARING. THEY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO COMBAT THE SHORTS. BUY BACKS OF STOCK WOULD BE A START. DON'T JUST LET THE STOCK FREE FALL."
"COST is a great company but it is not a great stock to own. I bought at $303 back in March and it is at $300 now despite all the hype about how people are panic buying at Costo stores. If this stock goes up to say $305, I may sell and get in on some other stock with more upside potential. Any thoughts?"
this should be opening $10 up with the great numbers that were put up
Sell
I own distributing etfs that own Costco shares. should I expect to see this 10 / share as the costco proportion of the etfs holdings? or should it be considered so special that many etfs will hold it and use it otherwise?!
DO MOST SHAREHOLDERS OUT THERE THINK MGT IS DOING A GREAT JOB ? WHY WOULD THEY BROADCAST THEIR SUPPORT FOR UPWARD AND HIGHER PAY RAISES AND NOT DO ANYTHING FOR SHAREHOLDERS. IN 3 MONTHS THE STOCK HAS DROPPED OVER 60 POINTS
Let’s go

Everyone should own these 3 stocks going forward:Costco amazon Walmart
COSTCO is now in a triple-bottom (bullish reversal) pattern. Not a double but a triple. Any break above resistance and it heads right back toward $230/shr..
Watch this retreat back to $160 once earnings come out. Even if the earnings are good the amount this has moved up since last e/report suggests the gains have already been valued in
"""Hey, Mom, what’s for dinner? ShopRite has the answer!""That was ShopRite's slogan way back in the day, Grimmikins, and it sure holds true today (seeing as you had to move back in with your Mom after having failed in life trying to wear big-boy pants).Hey, you lovin' that drop today Grimmikins?

Remember past history..COST always BOUNCES back !great entry.
Save some CASH buy the dips280'ssssssssssssssssssssss
Why are they paying out anything when their Current Ratio (mrq) is 0.93. For people that don't follow that measure it means their #$%$ liabilities are larger than their current assets. And that is before the dividend. That is a very strange move.
Dropping because ?????
Today is a tough day for folks. The winners today have been the companies that have done very poorly throughout the year. People seem to be selling companies like Costco in an effort to chase after.. Kohl's (up 20%+). The only piece of good news is that the market is broadening out now with the companies that have been down double digits recovering a tiny bit. Stay strong all! Good luck to everyone!
I dont see any hope to this stock
Cost may turning into good old medonald farm?
"A single Costco superstore stocks about 3,700 items. You are less likely to find empty shelves here compared to other places. Walmart stocks about 140,000 items and Target has around 75,000. This is good news in case virus cases continue to rise and states go on lockdown again(which will happen)."
Does anyone know whether the cost in China is open?
BIG BOYS are almost done loading...................................
This was not the time to hand out raises. Management needs a lobotomy.
I LOVE MY COSTCO SHARES!!! Especially at $373!!
DPW +5% happy trading guys
no one wants to sell this for cheap.
Higher Corp Taxes...Endorsed by Yellen. Hurts Retail More Than Any Other Industry
"Whole Foods is another regular grocer while Costco model is much different and it is not easy to imitate.Some one tell me which of following can whole foods can do:In 2017, Costco sold1- 9.9 million tires2- 6.1 m pair of glasses3- 2.5 m dress shirt4- 584 m prints and pictures5- 43 m prescriptions5- 87 m Rotisserie chickens6- 135 m hot dog and soda7- 176000 carats of diamonds8- $1.8 Billion wine9- $1.5 Billion TVs10- $1.6 B bakery11- millions of GAS. And many other things that whole foods is not design to do or completely different to imitate.I think Costco is adding more and more stuff like furnitures, phones, appliances, books...The next is carwash."
its another ws ploy to pick up shares and test high's at eoy sales. Costco going to $240 again
way undervalued. saw that article on whole food today?
Stocks goes up $10... and then pays divided....going down $10.
Down yesterday as news that Amazon cutting prices at Whole Foods. Great buying opportunity rebounds today nicely.
"Costco's stores are the busiest ones in Toronto ! Always packed , gas station very long lineups every day ."
almost new 52 wk high. its like watching fireworks
They announce this and there is a ten point pop. Tesla joins sP and jumps 50. Hmmm
Bought some @ 157.50next buy 152.10
This stock is so easy to make money
sales report up 15% and the stock tanks..what kinda crab is that?
"JUST BUY IT, I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT COST WILL NOT GO DOWN TO THE TOILET."
"Costco is the best retail stock, the growth is phenomenal."
This is a much solid company than tesla. But seems tesla gets better attention and love
See you guys at 280

"whoever sells their shares oh, I'm buying them because I'm in it for the long run and I'll be a freaking billionaire"
Costco Wholesale reached an all time high at 363.67
"This is really getting hilarious!! Now our mentally ill Dear Leader who says the economy is the strongest it's ever been wants taxes cut again because it didn't work the first time!! According to the Trump School of Economics, it's when the economy is really BAD that you actually increase taxes!! But good or bad, either way it's always someone else's fault... this time it's the FED's fault. He's got to stop making me laugh some much!!But seriously, he is mentally ill. He's just not bright enough to realize it."
This one crushed earnings. We should see a 52 week high tomorrow. Strong growth opportunities remain with this one domestically and abroad. Would be nice to see a dividend increase.
"Backed up the truck and loaded the bed with more COST shares. Will back the truck up again if there is an earnings selloff. COST is dirt cheap in the lower 300s. TGT and WMT are also at bargain levels right now. Own all 3 and the big e commerce names and discount retailers. These sections of commerce are what will last long into the future, unlike traditional brick and mortar retailers that aren't discount places or are traditional shopping centers like department stores. I have been taking full advantage of the rates temper tantrum and loading the coffers on every dip. Long term COST will go back to 400 and then take out 500. These bargain prices won't last forever folks so take advantage while you have time."
"chase it people,,,chase it,,, more buyers needed,,,i need my 170 calls to become worth a ton by friday,,,get buying"
Released great earnings and no movement?
"it's funny how costco is saying trump is dragging them down, but people here are praising trump...can't fix stupid"
goal is above $400
"What's the matter, Alvie?Nobody paying attention to you?"
Good buy right now. It always goes up to $300
New HIGHS coming............................................better cover shorties...............
Is this going up tomorrow?
"Costco is killing the traditional supermarket industry. I worked in the supermarket industry for 30 years and have been a Costco customer since I retired 4 years ago. During snowbird season you can hardly get in the store in Naples, Florida. I look at the mix of product in the carts and about 90% of what I see was formerly sold in traditional supermarkets. The order sizes are huge. Their labor hours are much lower than traditional supermarkets. I invested in Costco in a very small way just a couple months ago. It is a long term hold for me and I am an active investor. I will trade around my small position. People like going to Costco. The clientele in stores where I shop (St. Louis area) is notches above Wal Mart (and I would assume Sam's--but I don't shop at Sam's). Supermarkets are struggling to maintain even same store sales while Costco has had pretty solid numbers. Rambling a bit, but I like the Company and my investment."
"today, it would be nice to have one of them $20 spikes"
"Read the reasons companies DONT split stocks anymore..you can whistle Dixie before any well known company will split stocks...just look at chipholti restaurant stock at over $800 they have no reason to split and neither does Costco. If that’s what your waiting for, your in for a rude awakening my friend. Just be grateful for Costco going up with good dividends and collect your $$..look back and see when ANY big company split? Not happening buddy!,,"
Costco Wholesale reached an all time high at 363.61
I sold out this morning at 162. feel sorry for longs
I guess next week hit the 100dollar bellows
We should now see a few days of positive rallying for cost. Bullish and way long.
this stock is just no good anymore
The fundamental is good but there is no good news to boost this giant.
"Nice, another analyst raises price target after numbers came out yesterday.Analyst Actions: Wells Fargo Lifts Costco Wholesale's Price Target, Maintains Market Perform Rating"
what does COST have to do with Trump trade wars......NOTHING !
up 18%?? Amazing!! I think we can count on being down $10 a share if history repeats.
"So, let me get this straight...Costco makes a ton of money compared to the year prior, misses the outsiders estimate by one penny and is now down by $15? This is absolute insanity."
I have a feeling it’s going to miss on earnings
People will regret why they sold Costco rn in just about 7hrs...
I believe it will be with CEO Craig Jelnick not Jim
Like this comment if $Cost gets above 310.00 this week. Downvote if you think I will get some niceAce this weekend while I’m in Pittsburgh visiting some friends.

Boy the selling just keeps crashing for this stock.. capitulation is at hand!!!
Must be some good dope inside.
COSTCO Membership continues to grow well over expectations !thats what really matters.
Walmart and amazon taking so much business away from them. Major problem. They won’t meet expectations. Tanking to 200
I hope this is either a misunderstanding or this gets fixed very quickly.http://www.breitbart.com/california/2018/05/15/report-costco-stores-reject-gun-stores-donation-childrens-miracle-network/
"Costco is #1 and the best in the sector""[Costco] offers an unquestioned value prop with the best pricing, curated assortment, strong private label offering, and treasure hunt atmosphere,"" JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers wrote in a note to clients, as reported by CNBC.Costco also proved the least expensive option for perishable groceries, dry goods and household items when compared to Whole Foods, Wal-Mart, Target and Aldi, JPMorgan found.""Where are you Crammer, read and learn instead of misleading investors."
"Does anyone know the reason for the late opening time? The warehouses in my area close at 8:30 PM which is great, but they open at 11AM. It seems odd that they continue to give up all potential sales in the early morning."
Bought in a while back. Don’t live in the US and have been watching euro plans. It’s going to take on some big boys eg Geant. I’m buying more
"hey all you geniuses, buy more , this is a barking dog.."
"Yeeesh... poor me.. I have to keep raising my stop losses, since I bought at $155 several months ago ...."
cost stock must be tired running up all day
What a blood-bath but COST hung in there today compared to many. Was expecting much worse.
"Shorted at 284, still waiting to cover half my position at 260 and ride the remainder till 240"
"I used to have cost a few years ago...it was $160's..sold it because it kept going backwards, and I invested elsewhere...came back to costco at $300...its going backwards again..is it me?"
recently I got interested in this stock. Is it importing any goods from China?
"Since the tax rate on dividends and long term capital gains are the same (who know for how long) , I would prefer the special dividend because I can deploy the after tax proceeds into investments that potentially yield a return better than that paid on cash. What is Costco, Apple etc. making on their large cash hoards? Could their shareholders find other higher value uses for that money? If you hold it in a retirement account the tax issue becomes moot. If you have a non-retirement account, then you get a cash dividend and the money is there to pay the tax. Also, depending on your other income, you may pay no tax on the qualified dividends and capital gains (see the qualified div. and cap. gain worksheet in your 1040 instructions.) Whether you root for a special dividend or not depends on which side can deploy that money into its highest rate of return."
Save some $$$$ to buy theSILLY DIPS...............................
This trades almost too funny to look at itDown every day
This has turned into an idiot board.
people are afraid to buy this because of the recent crash
"Road to $250 in a quarter begins, COST bubble is exploding."
How about the Lofty price and p/E of Amazoo?
I should have stayed at DE
Wall Street dummies didn’t even know how to value the stock after Earnings smh
Yahoo FinanceCostco may be 'poised' to increase membership feesbuy here at bargain prices.
I am bullish of Costco due to covid pushing more and more people to the car friendly suburban. Before covid many of the carfree people in NYC and San Francisco wouldn’t able to shop there. Now they can.
"$500,000/day in Costco 's Honolulu Store. 8-12 fuel tankers per day at their gas pumps. 8,000 hotdogs/day at Honolulu store. Boom!"
lol shorted 307 thanks UBS/JPmorgan
This was at $340 just a few days ago...it just keeps dropping #$%$
"Sales flat as Costco is raising prices and fees across the board. As shoppers we are finding better bargains AND cheaper elsewhere, especially vegetables and berries. Breads are as expensive or more so than Safeway. I've had it! Fees, rising prices, have to buy n gross, shtye....."
We need a stellar report cuz this ain’t cheap with PE of 35.
"The panic is hitting my new Costco in Bradenton Florida, before store opening this morning, folks with their shopping carts to load up on food and supplies were wrapped half way around the Costco store.Costco sale/earnings are going out the roof!"
"I am a Costco member but cannot buy because the lines are long and not managed properly.The social distancing is not maintained in the line formed at the Costco near me.Unfortunately ,The Costco website technology is not advanced and it is almost impossible to buy fresh items from Costco. The instacart that Costco uses never provide any delivery time to buy!I am wondering why I should keep my membership."
Looks like this stock has topped out
When will people learn it’s a buy and hold.
Great defensive stock. Long term holding in portfolio. Only regret not getting in before 213.
Im just hoping earnings this goes up and not down.....
if it goes sub 300 im back in..
"299.00-301.00BUY , BUY BUY"
Show me another company that had to close their doors due to too many customers. Doors to the China store closed at 1pm in the afternoon on opening day due to too much demand. (No seriously tell me so I can buy that stock too)
Not a lot but added 15 more. Great numbers coming in Jan.
Lol shorts are sweating!!!!!
Yet another all time high reached today. Tough to find an argument against Costco
Breaking out soonshorties better cover.
Going up...
"Hey guys, I know that this stock’s progress makes no sense right now, but IMO, in a long run it will recover. You just have to be patient. This is not a day trading stock but an investment stock. The earnings results in 2 weeks should put this stock back on track."
Look for the dips as another BUY opportunity here.
No special dividend this year? Was looking forward to it.
this is ridiculous. The market is clearly overreacting. This amazon craze is getting out of hand.
we are in the green already !
$20 special dividend coming.
"Guess Costco fans didn’t want to see Beyond Meat in stores. Tastes like dog food, so hopefully it will stocked in that section. Btw- don’t waste your money on the Dunkin Donuts fake sausage sandwich either, unless you are buying it for your pet!"
this stock will never be much over $300....I think its gunna always linger in the $295-305 dollar range
Look for 275.00 as machine trading continues................................BUY
Costco is one of the smartest retailers out there. International growth and e-commerce posting big gains
If Trump would quit the markets would stabilize
Sell this garage and buy FCO.V
The stimulus is gonna go into retails A LOT
Strong earnings met with a #$%$ sandwich. Welcome to 2020.
"does anyone see a split being offered at the shareholders meeting, maybe give this a boost somehow?"
"COST is very undervalued at these levels. I’ve been buying hand over fist. Been doing the same for WMT and TGT. These retailers are not in trouble unlike traditional retailers such as Macy’s and Dillard’s. The first 3 I named have strong customer loyalty, excellent organizational culture, stellar management, etc. The way COST treats their employees is beyond exceptional. For both moral reasons as well as financial ones I am proud to be a COST shareholder."
going green....let's run costco
"costco needs to drop 75 points,,,the PE is too high looking forward"
"Targets raised , again358.00-365.00"
"Hey everyone,Pimento here. Just wanting to get back on the shelf as I am delicious and customers love me, I also support los of good families in SC.Hope to see you soon.Bye,Pimento"
"Just leaving Costco in Modesto. Judging by overstaffing and zealous checkout (even more than normal) I would say CA Props essentially legalizing theft are taking their toll. I asked Security in passing about levels of theft and they said ""absurdly high"". Which surprised me since they are usually tight lipped. Anyway, I thought I'd blow off steam here. CA sucks, Costco is great but cost of doing biz here is elevated."
"If I'm correct, you can't buy today and get the special dividend, but you can still buy and get the regular dividend, correct?"
THEY TRICK TO SELL COSTCO VERY STRONG
special dividend. who cares.It just comes out of the share price doesnt it ?
costco might be doing everything right so they say...but their stock will never be the same...you saw yesterday..it was up $4.50...and at one time towards the close only up $.29...people were just waiting for s good day to dump this stock
BIDEN having his diaper changed because TRUMP is coming back to White House !
Lol Lary on tilt. Looks like old man doesn’t know 80% of options expire worthless
I got to buy COST because I don't believe that COST will go to the toilet.
"Costco Stock Looks Like a Bargain in This Pricey Market. Here's How to Play It. -- Barrons.comBY Dow Jones & Company, Inc.— 6:59 AM ET 01/23/2020On Tuesday, Oppenheimer upgraded Costco's investment rating to Outperform from Perform, and said that the stock was one of the firm's top picks. It increased its target price to $335 from $300.Rupesh Parikh, who follows Costco for Oppenheimer, advised clients in a note that the retailer's ""more accommodative relative valuation"" creates an attractive entry point.Moreover, Parikh noted that speculation has lingered for several quarters that Costco would declare a special dividend, which Parikh estimates at about $10 per shar"
"I am shocked—3 weeks about I posted a survey question— or  on COST. 60 people replied ...it was almost a tie, with  winning by a little."
COST reached an all time high at 302.97
expecting so much more....what happened
282.00-285.00 was aGIFT .
Sales continue toSOAR..............................
numbers still not out yet
"It always drops after earnings then continues its climb. Until it doesnt. The SP divvy dropped it $20. Kinda funny really. We are net $0 from the high of $390ish looking at pre market. Now with earnings front and center and the numbers are clear, one could conclude that the holiday season coupled with a vaccine roll out is going to make this stock see an adrenalin induced rise thru the end of the year. IMO, $425 is on the table by Jan 15 and possibly the end of this year."
Theres no slight miss. Its a huge miss
320.0-324.00 ready for take off............................look for the dips......................................
e-commerce sales rose 64.5%
When numbers hit this will pop! People get a j to fundamentals and not worrying about amazon effect. Costco is here to stay and dividend is safe
Train leaving soon............................look for dips as a BUY.........................
I can't help to buy more when COST is in deep red.
"I wonder if the membership fee is $60 in Yuan at 110,000 members in the first week. Having lived in China for a short time, I know the Chinese like concept of being members of a club. It connotes exclusivity similar to buying high end designer products. They need to put a store in the major coastal cities and Hong Kong. I would be interested to know the types of items they sell in China as opposed to the U.S. I suspect it is similar to the ones in Taiwan that I visited. Costco in Taiwan is quite popular as well. Go Costco!!!"
Friday is generally sell costco day..should stay red all day dow $15 at times
It’s trading at pre covid levels.....................................way undervalued...........................REV. BEAT a positive

Costco sold out of amenities in CA and pharmacies like RAD sale skyrocketing and stocks are down?
"'Comparable-store sales, excluding the impact of fuel and currency changes, rose 7.5 percent for the first quarter ended Nov. 25, well above analysts' average estimate of 5.8 percent'...this is the best news! Earnings in-line, rev up, but positive comps...the big news!"
"costco stock sucks,,,,its dropped from 180 to 50 and now its #$%$,,, what am i missing,,amazon will not hurt this giant,,,it can hurt Walmart and every other retailer but Costco people are willing to pay to shop there so profits are guaranteed,, but i am dumb the stock could go to ZERO"
Love that drop.
People who have memberships will always keep them . Amazon will not and cannot change that. Oh ! My 3 kids need milk today do I wait to get it from amazon tomorrow ? No I shop for it today  also the average house hold is bigger today and the demographics have changed to a population with more kids . Costco will do just fine . Don't be worried
"Don't even try to figure out Costco stocks movement out, just buy, hold, and smile!"
I read on here several times that costco is a recession proof company..not looking like it lately
Triple bottoms are not to be ignored... (you should all mark this note and refer back to it in 10-12 months.)
"buying Halloween candy and Christmas lights at Costco ,soon"
"I only come to this message board for entertainment as most of the people here have no idea what they are taking about. PS: I love Costco and it’s stock. I am an investor, not a day-trader. Enough said."
Analysts taking about COST as real cheap here...................................400 +++++++
Next stop220.00
love costco but the stock needs more loving
We might get a buying opportunity after earnings
I knew it..stock hasn't done nothing for 3 months
I am an amazon prime member but will never buy groceries online my family loves going to Costco. I never have come out of Costco with just one item. Usually spend over $100 each time. This is a golden opportunity to buy Costco and hold for dividend payouts and guarantee returns of investment as this is way oversold and reacted.
250 all time high tomorrow. I am feeling shorts squeezing noise already. This baby due for a big bounce
I SHORTED MORE
rev missed274 support

Bought @ 222 and order filled. Very happy and will dump AH today.
near term correction imminent.. will hit $285
Nobody cares that ER is coming?
"building my positions here, good luck to all"
"I am not happy about Costco taking advantage of consumers during this crisis. They allow business owners to line up early every morning before regular shoppers, and they work in teams to snap up as much as they can buy as quickly as possible, it is a race every day. There are videos showing how this is going, and it is every day as they buy as much as Costco will allow them to buy and they come back every day. Then those small business owners turn around and re-sell those items in their little stores for outrageous prices. I have been trying to buy toilet paper for 3 weeks now, and online, again, shame on Costco, NO toilet paper can be purchased for delivery at least in my near-Las Vegas zip code, per their website. I am losing faith quickly in Costco and this is enough to make me reconsider remaining a member, there seems little value in being a member when they give small business owners this advantage. Also, as much as they have been able to sell these pig merchants, my own purchases are way down because nothing that I truly need can be purchased anymore."
"people who were to stuck up to eat kraft heinze products before are now eating kraft dinnerlol haha. millenials fill your organic guts up with kraft dinner. kraft cant keep up with demand, kraft dinner factories are running 24/7 to keep up with demand"
Kevin covered at $267.50 and lost it all... don't be fooled by this pretend stock trader.
my bad boys i bought before earnings
Costco has never been as busy as last 4 weeks
I'm seriously canceling my memberships until they can begin to show the shareholders some respect
I won’t shop at costco until they change there mentality ... Masks to gain entry .... Sorry .... Wrong strategy IMHO..
The stock just paid out 7.50 and its about down that much in price. Do you think the company which reported good April numbers will lay an egg on May 25 when it reports. Ipersonally think the earning will be good.
wait till Costco opens up it's first location in China later this year
scared by amazon earnings?
Expecting a 50% drop based not only on poor performance but a dim future of a retailer who can not compete with Amazon. oh well going to dump shares but at least I bought in at 160.
COST is one of 3 of my worst losing positions.
SHORT THIS U MAKE SOME MONEY
Why is Costco up 1.5% ? Is there a reason or another pump and dump ?
earning before or after guys?
We should thank Buffet for selling. Costco flexing and showing that there's nothing to worry about.
"But but, the retails need instant gratification. They can not conceive of holding a stock for a month."

Paid dividends today!! Money in the bank. $0.70 a share.

As we indicated six(6) days agol that Cost will close this week above $165.85 and here we are voila.Next leg up $168.30 by end of this week.Have a great week trading.
I'll say it again..this stock isnt all its cracked up to be
@Stephen Do you have any idea what Costco employees have been thru the last year? Remember Costco?s mission statement TAKE CARE OF OUR EMPLOYEES! Thus REWARD THE SHAREHOLDERS!! The shareholders were rewarded a ten dollar dividend recently and the company is thriving. Sounds to me like you just like to #$%$ probably one of those idiots who complains about long lines in a store you?re invested in.
The view is spectacular up here.
"2012, 2015 and 2017 special dividends of either $5 per share or $7 per share. Maybe an early 2019 re-occurence ??"
COST is going the way of the dodo bird. Young people don't shop there. They are one of the least digitized companies. Shopping in the store and getting in and out of their stores is pain. Their membership renewals are dropping which is the kiss of death.
"Have to love this stock as well as shopping there. I've owned the stock since the early 1990s with a cost basis in the single digits, so won't sell, so my kids can get a step up basis when I die, as I am 90. I have experience one of their stock splits and I think it is time for another so normal investors can buy a 100 share lot. Costco has been one of my better investments."
will tomorrow be green?

"gotta feel bad for the employees, that have a 401k...and were banking on retiring...BAM...you lost thousands...sorry our stock sux"

"Just remember SMART people will find a way to get around to avoid paying fee like cost sharing membership fees, one person in the family will buy the membership only and all other families and relatives go in to shop together and then pay back the other person later when they get home."
Just started my position at $342 today. I’m so late in the game! Hopefully this goes up. You think it will pop a bit after close from July sales ?
Rockets go 3 2 1 
Great earnings. Shaking out the robinhood chickens atm and we will climb
