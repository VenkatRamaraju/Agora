"Sold everything (kept 1 share ) at 14.31, March 8th, cost base 7.627. then bought everything back at 13.46. So far so good but Panicked last Thursday, and sold some at 12.28. Regretted it immediately and bought back it at 12.52. Would like to have friends here who are willing to exchange information, experience and teach me. Will provide email address to anyone interested"
Support is too strong on this stock. Basement is $13. Load up before the market takes off in value stocks soon
Look at the day's waterfall chart! Shorts in total control.Get out with whatever profit there is.. Trading below the 50 DMA now.. Not good.
"What can we learn from today’s trading pattern? It traded between $13.5x to $14 and closed at $13.57. It is a fierce fight between bulls and bears. The volume is close to 100 million shares traded. It seems the bears are still not persuaded by the positive outlook of GE. Thus, it will not be an easy road ahead if GE just only releases mediocre earning. GE needs releases a good surprise earnings. I see it is coming, but not sure it will be this quarter or not. I trust GE’s outlook is bright. Be patient."
conversation open. has anyone ever seen a positive result from reverse stock splits. honestly I would say under 10%. bad move on their part I believe they will lose institutional ownership
Biggest Economic Boom is coming ..Aviation is roaring back GE is on the offensive to benefit from huge opportunitiesBuy and Hold Long & Strong GE
"Hey, Zacks...GE beating the market today.... anything you have to say? Though so,"
GE is not your growth company that does stock splits to keep it available to retail investors and then splits again when the price keeps rising. GE went into the declining stage after years of obscene opulence and gross mismanagement. Culp has been a positive influence and I even put some money down for $5.60 a share after adding at $10. I figured to ride it as far as it would go before selling but this talk of a RS caused me to sell.
wow..... just checked in for the day.....powerful day up recouping 13+.wonder what the 12.93 short and the 12.53 short are thinking tonight...YIPEE YIPEE HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEH
"GE’s Stock moves slow, no denying that, just look at the chart for the entire history. When GE hits its bottom it takes years to reach its top. We’re heading in the right direction from the bottom it just left. Moving averages are starting to cross which indicates investors are moving in. We got this!"
"It is the unknown of covid-19. I got the one shot vaccine. All 3 vaccines do not guarantee you will not get the virus. There is not going to be much travel to europe. There is going to be a lot of aircraft that will remain idle, delayed maintenance & delayed orders as well"
PFE holders still have your VTRS?
"What’s your take, will the reverse split happen? I voted against it"
"If this gains momentum and volume it could be a really nice recoveryI was really excited the last week and a half leading up to TuesdayIf it returns to a run Ike that, based on fundamentals, we could see how ridiculous the reaction was by the shorts and people who jumped"
What Tusa position on the reverse split? he must be in favor of it. Why GE would do ANY business with JPM is a mystery to me
Of course you will be provoked with $15 by friday posts again. LOL
What is going on?
"Dow up 200, GE down..."
Rs will keep short out and day trader like jj
"GE's Board and Culp could come to their sense and the shareholder meeting May 4th could reverse this downtrend. I'd say chance are slim to none, but still, it's possible. Most of all remember, It's only money, there is many other positives in life to focus on.Have a great weekend everyone!!"
Pre-determined algo trading most days.. Option sellers are making good $$ every week... GE has been stuck in this mud since the R/S plan announcement a couple of months ago..
"I am a ""baggie"", and as Maxwell Smart would say......""and loving it"" !. I needed a good laugh this morning so I started reading the shorts posts. LMAO !!. They said GE was dead money when GE was 1/2 its price, LMAO !!!!."
"Am I the only person that thinks this is a complete overreaction to the reverse split?Yes reverse splits generally go down but that is because most of them are reverse splitting to avoid being delisted. That is not the case here.This seems to be more of a play toward institutional investors but I think today’s drop is not based on fundamentals of the companyIf it was, the only thing that has changed is a deal adding 30 billion to the positive and a new partnership."
farmer = dewd = jj = chickens
Overwhelming debtUnion profit drainChina offering to buy Jet engine division and all facilities for debt forgiveness. China moves their assemblymen into facilities to reduce high labor cost. Wind turbines of all types fail....batteries fail in cold weatherTHANK Goodness Capital is gone...but left a trail of Debt and tears that shareholders are stuck with. The only other mammoth business with more debt is the 43 trillion in government debt and adding daily. Im afraid. When does this Madoff scheme go kapow?? Some say April...some say never. I say maybe Gov. Bonds for a while. Yikes
GE looking good on this mmeh day
Buying this dog muted.
"Will turn green, loading up on this. This is a strong manage company and will have a great turnaround story."
This will be a $20+ stock by the end of the year. Hop on now. Only a matter of time.
Beautiful GE chart from September 2020 till today says it all....Baggies= Shorts ! :) :) :)
bottom line is talk of RS indicates weakness and incompetence. Make no sense for shareholder. Only help GE adversaries. Bad move market is taking no prisoners today
Southwest Airlines about to order over 300 airplanes......with GE engines. :-)
"Inside monkey named GE as 7th long term safest stock to invest. Here is what the article said: 7. General Electric Company (NYSE: GE)General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) is a Boston-based multinational company operating in aviation, healthcare, electronics, power, and other industries. The products that the company offers include gas turbines, independent power producers, boilers, generators, steam turbines, and air quality control systems; as well as advanced reactor technologies solutions. It has a renewable energy division working on wind, blades, hydro, storage, solar, and grid solutions.. The company is seventh on our list of 10 safe stocks to invest in for the long term.It has a market cap of more than $119 billion and posted an annual revenue of close to $80 billion in December 2020. Last month, Bank of America retained a Buy rating on General Electric stock with a price target of $15. Analysts at the bank projected a positive outlook for the firm in 2021 predicted the investor base of the firm to broaden in the coming years. A few weeks before the Bank of America maintained the GE rating, Deutsche Bank raised the price target of the firm to $14 from $13."
"what we learned from 1st qtr. results is that green energy and wind energy produces ZERO to GE bottom line again despite the 40 news releases on agreements with Vietnam, and other economic power houses. GE is going nowhere and see bottom on $9.25 soon."
"ges 30 b dealallows ge a 46% retaining ownership and consequently enables ge to participate in the expected rebound in commercial aero finance, and at ges discretion includes options for a staged exit retaining"
"$13.15 floor set by insiders, be carful its a trap! Lots of Market indicators out tomorrow this will open below in the $12's Monday. Last trading day!"
"$GE makes light bulbs, and jet engines. I have no issue with a company that makes el primo, high quality, electronics such as iPhones, also manufacturing electric vehicles."
I closed my GE positions as soon as market opened. I am not sure if I want to get in again. I will wait
we add tomorrow pre market
Every reverse split I received in 40 years has been bad for the stock price in the long run.
"As one that bought in defiance of Tusa at $6.23, I can say that GE's businesses are now firmly in an uptrend. If Culp and the board want fewer shares through a reverse stock split, be my guest. It means nothing other than general house keeping. Buy."
"Ever wonder how people get 25 thumbs up after saying the same thing over and over? Why is it always the same people on the top reaction list? Are they colluding with each other? The pump team hasn't changed anything for 4 years in here. Just the names are changed. BEWARE the pump dogs. Maxgain? uh huh. For these short sellers. Anonymous? Again?, Baseball and Brent, Bryce? LOL whatever. Cap ties Larry's shoes for him. How is the air down there cappy?"
We are down over $2 since the reverse split was announced. I hope most people vote NO. We were doing okay all along. What are they not telling us?
The great re-opening has begun!
"GE AVIATION Owns 60% of World Market.. TESLA EV 2021 Owns less than 18%. GOOG 60% Search Market.. GE Renewable Growing, HEALTHCARE GROWING, Aviation Engine Revenue headed back to $30 BILLION per covid, Profits GE Aviation alone $10 BILLION pre covid..GE IS SEVERELY UNDERVALUED.. Humbly wait, I cant buy and sell listening to headlines, Buy SEVERELY UNDERVALUED Proven stocks and hold tight no matter what. I can not play with big market players, I hv no power at all, only power I have is BUY AND HOLD, NOOOT TIME THAT MARKETS..And Thank dear JPM. Iam only human"
So is all of the good news out now?
...and that's the end of the clown news. Have a wonderful night.
No chips. Everyone needs chips
I won't surprise it goes green after lunch.
It's noon on Monday. GE stock up $.25 (1.9%) on good volume. May the force be with GE and Luke Skywalker.
"Revers split is meaningless for GE, only the brokers lose . Lower trading volume , lower fees for brokers and all the Wall street scam !"
I say $26-$27 by and of year.
Bears will try to attack GE again based on Friday’s trading patterns. I am putting more limited order to buy at $13.25 and $13. Let’s see how low they can push GE down.
"This is why you don't say a stock price can't happen, like 12s. When the market wants to take a dump, your 'pumping' won't help your claimed support levels."
ge basically is moving up with the Dow. short term traders bought am & selling last hour of trading!
"After the reverse split for some companies, long term holders lost most of their investment - So why GE wants to do that, it is not a good idea."
GE rises a measly $.15; HON rises $4.57. Who is the real winner?
I put on my noise suppressors and blinders today to block all the noise and antics of the shorts and added to my holdings. I think today is a good day to add now that the weak hands have fallen by the wayside.
"Wow, this stock is not doing anything, it went down with the market but not going up."
"Just for all of you BAGGIES, especially Marabound."
Now I know why Culp never defended GE from JPM/tusa attacks
Nice to see a run below that 12.77 mark today but....
"GE Renewable Energy has won a 110MW order to supply 42 onshore wind turbines to CleanMax across three projects in India. The 2.7-132 wind turbine has been chosen due to its efficiency in capitalising on India’s low wind speeds, according to GE.These projects will leverage GE’s significant local footprint in India..."
anyone hear from Oh Danny Boy?....think I may have seen his act over on BA board..
"Holding and buying, original purchase from $6 sold some at $10.50 & 14.20 .Now replenishing to 6k shares."
Good to see all the news about CEO compensation and 1 for 8 Reverse split putting a floor in
"Why the fighting, either buy or sell your choice, but I would Buy Buy Buy GE....!!!"
"blk, top share owner of ge ........... given the misalignment of pay and performancevoted against payment plan"
"Somebody needs some money!General Electric Co. disclosed Friday that it sold off more of the Baker Hughes Co. shares it owned, and likely raised nearly $1 billion."
"Nice move GE board. Dow up 300, GE down 80 cents. 15 billion drop in market cap equates to 50% drop of selling GECAS at 30 billion. Once again GE screwed up. You want to reduce float? How about buying back 25% of the shares with the sale of GECAS. This reduces float to around 6 billion shares. then do a 2 or 3 to 1 reverse split to reduce float to 2 or 3 billion shares. The 8 to 1 is a joke, driving share price to about 100 per share. Nobody will want to invest in GE at that price. And an 8 cent dividend is not an enticement. 1 cent now, 8 to 1 reverse split should yield an 8 cent dividend. The market is reacting to your news, and it is not good."
I see the meeting is 5/4 for the reverse stock split...I haven't received anything but the notice...
GE April weekly 13.50 straddle priced for a move of 6.5% into the expected release of quarter results before the bell on April 27.
"Once the Float has been reduced from 8 to just over 1 billion, GE Management will start to issue billions of new shares! Like taking candy from babies!!"
"If you have to invest and expect people to say nice things to you and the stock, then there is something wrong."
"JPM/Tusa current recommendation is hold. It was sell for a very long time. Question: how can you sell your shares and then hold? or does it mean hold, if you did not sell when I said sell? UBS/Markus current recommendation is buy. Has always been buy. I like this guy. Very optimistic."

GE Clean Energy.. Big push.. Big Upside 
Dow up 450 in 2 days and this is down nice If the dow was down 450 where would this be?
"Just saw this - Analyst Actions: Deutsche Bank Adjusts General Electric's Price Target to $14 From $13, Reiterates Hold RatingBY MT Newswires— 11:14 AM ET 03/11/2021A reverse split isn't always a bad thing. At least not like it's being portrayed here. My opinion, it creates somewhat of a facade. EPS will LOOK better because there will be less shares. The market cap will remain the same. Dividends will be greater on shares held, only the investor will have less shares, so the end result (yield) will remain the same. The stock price will be more in line with other company's in the sector. I'm not understanding the motivation for the big sell off."
"First up, GE announced it would be combining its aircraft leasing business, GECAS, with AerCap (NYSE:AER). The deal involves GE receiving $24 billion in cash, a 46% share in the combined company that currently has a combined market value of $6 billion, and an additional $1 billion in AerCap notes or cash upon closing. As part of the deal, GE will transfer $34 billion of GECAS' net assets to AerCap."
How do you miss by 66%?
"Clearly aviation is slow to bounce back. Not at all a surprise, but it will. The question is whether you buy GE before it does while you can get in cheap, or later when the price is high? Buy now imo."
I see where there are going to. My guess is a secondary offering after the RS. Then a reinstatement of higher dividends. I get it. But the problem is that average people cannot buy at $104. They are doing this for their rich investors where money really is not an issue.
When you sell off part of the business reverse splitting allows for a more reasonable amount of shares. People are looking way to much into this.
GE stood strong against the bearish attack again today. The bears pushed it to $13.03 for a short time in the morning. It is nice to see GE will close right above 50 DMA today!
"I look at John Ink talk about 3% PRE CASH YIELD which is just ""babble"".Ditto for Tuda lambasting GE debt.Think of buying a house. All you can see is the debt. You are blind of the asset being worth more than the debt.The same logic for Inch's babble.It is true GE lacks the massive profit before it but you are investing on the ""belief"" and NOT the actual ""today profit"".Think of it as a hunch or the potential or your intuition.If people did not think the future held promise - nobody would open a new business.My wife is similar to Inch and Tusa. She sees the debt and forgets the valuable assets that far exceed the debt."
Shorters aren't happy the past week for sure. Hope they at least have a nice weekend. This turbulence will happen for awhile but GE takes off from here for sure.
No movement in stock price till the earnings on April 27. Till then typical day of up 25 cents AM and lose most of it by PM will continue. It’s been like this for over 3 months
"Over last 6 months, GE is up 120.72%...we are good for a little rest now before the next leg up...no worries. "
"In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s bottom line for 2021 has gone down from 36 cents to 24 cents, due to seven downward estimate revisions versus one upward.much speculation trying to establish culps intent how to further reduce debtcombined with a reverse splitputs me in the corner of caution.trading seems safer and more profitable"
Just a matter of time. :-)
"Some people on this board are trying to convince you, with wrong information, to unload your shares at this low price so they can scoop them. I welcome the R/S by Mr. Culp and the board. I believe they are doing it for the benefit of the co. and share holders. My asset allocation for this co. will give me 400 share @1-8 split. I went through a 1-3 with Duk and 1-10 with ETFC (E-trade) and they worked out very well for me. If you want to give away your shares at a low price to liars and shysters, it's you decision. I WILL NOT!"
Larry Culp is the Chuck Norris of CEOs
"REVERSE SPLIT IS A GREAT IDEA!!!Culp is crazy like a fox.At $12 he can't increase the dividend by a penny (100%) as the share count would make it very expensive. After the the RS, he can afford to raise the dividend by a penny, 12.5% increase at 1/8th the cost.A 12.5% increase in the dividend will show strength and investors will drive the stock price up.This is just an old man's opinion. Lol"
"Alcoa is a $9 billion company that was in the $30 range two years ago and sunk to $6 and has reached back to $30 with little more up directionMining is not my style. Look at Mgm or Penm and you can see the same curves and I own both.Neither remotely compares with GE where I bought at a bottom price. The last time Ge was at $5.98 was 1996 and last year it was selling at the absolute bottom - never to be there againupward pricing for GE is huge going forward and I think their position in Renewables will rival Aviation in market share, potential, and profits and that is their hidden valuable asset. It could match Aviation in profit potential and sales volume."
"gene, i don't care what you think. You are just another bag holder in a long line of them. I have successfully traded GE for over 3 years now. Mostly on the short side. I see you have been posting on only GE and with your new nick for only 3 months. Your posting scroll is offensive to others that would like to have a say. From what i can see, you have never posted anything negative about GE. I have posted fact after fact in here but you don't want to hear it. shrugs. Quit spamming the board with your endless posts that say nothing new. You aren't that important. Now go get a life beyond your GE obsession."
"I am most concerned about the rs, but I think we should wait until proxy is published this week. If shareholders have to vote, then they will need a better ""selling point"". I am guessing that the rs will give Culp options for purchasing critical businesses or for spinning off other businesses, that maybe good for creating value for stockholders, but could make the stock price go down after the businessis spun off. Whatever is the purpose, I think we need to reserve judgement on Culp. I bought more today."
"The weak handed speculators sold today. The stock held due to the support that was built, then recovered nicely. I'll say it again $20's this year for $GE!"
"This is comical that people think the roof is falling in. Shorts are trying to shake the tree of the new investors. This company is solid and will only keep getting better. The reverse split will have positive effects, it will cut down some of these day traders that play on people’s emotions. Look at the history of RI nothing but negative comments that go way back. He is a short and will only offer bad advice that will put money in his pocket. So hold firm and you will be rewarded with great gains."
"Just observed a lot of options bid at $12.5,$13, $13.5,$14 this Friday, a triple witching day. The concentration bids are at $13.5 with more than 80000 call contracts. The maximum gain for the market makers to profit is the price close at $13. It will be very versatile next few days. Using this opportunity to get some more shares when it traded under $13 and sell some trading shares when it reached $13.75"
$30B coming into the cash register. This CEO isn’t playing games. Thank goodness we don’t have the old ceo anymore. Let’s go!
"market overall opened green for tech stocks today, red for alot reopening sectors. Yummy dip and chips before earnings later this month"
"I hope the reverse stock split does not happen. I own 22,000 shares"
Could tag the lower band today if it rolls off some more.
"scenario 1: After the RS is approved but before it is enacted GE will raise approximately $10,000,000,000 via a secondary offering of about 1,000,000,000 shares. Then they follow that with the RS."
I sold most off portfolio today to buy into this and I’m in GE 67.80 percent now of complete portfolio I’m on risk for the biscuit mode and have faith
This stock wants to be in the lower $12's so bad!
"Do you see the hyping of debt reduction over reverse split? They know reverse split is bad bad bad. The real question is, what happens after the reverse split? 1. Borrow more money?2. Issue new shares and dilute?3. or what?Tusa said the share don't worth over $5. Keep that in mind."
Thanks GE
Insiders are not buying. They are getting free shares. Expect share count to balloon before the split. Then after the split new shares will be issued to pay down debt in the next 3 years. Share count will stabilize around 4B. Meaning that about 3B new shares will be added. Or 24B presplit shares

"Check the commercial flights per day numbers, flights are increasing steadily, wait until the mask mandates and summer travel effect kicks in.

Have a great weekend everyone."
All I see is good news on GE... everyday... makes you wonder how long the steaming kettle will hold before moving up...
"Ha, Ha, Ha,... What a joke! Couldn't gain a cent on a big up day,.. But, keep pumping longs. See you in tomorrow in the $12's."

Shorts once again in full control
"Reverse Split Advantages for GEThe move wouldn’t directly change the value of the company or an investor’s position, but it would shrink the number of shares outstanding to about 1.1 billion.In theory, a company’s share price in and of itself doesn’t matter—its total value can be divided by any number of shares.But some investors avoid shares below certain thresholds, and some stock exchanges require companies to keep share prices above certain levels: $1 on the Nasdaq, for example. Some institutional investors won’t invest in companies with stock prices below certain levels.Practically speaking, investors often seem to see higher-priced shares as more attractive—and companies with prices below certain thresholds, like $10 or $1, as shakier. In the market, of course, perception matters."
SHAKA
with market reaction to split I don't think it will happen but if it did say at $15 ×8 =$120 per share it will be like AAPL .The other option is to increase dividend by 100% and let the share price go up.
"Want to see how GE Stock is doing as an investment? Just look at GE one year chart. GE is up an astounding 116% ! That is in spite of challenges due to Covid-19. In my book that makes GE in the""Hall of Great"". GLTA GE Investors. "

Good Morning to All GE Investors!!! 
There it goes red inc soon lol
"Haven't looked at GE for 6 months and I see it has risen to nosebleed altitude.With the National debt now at 108% of GDP, it can never be paid off , because if you even took 10% of the GDP out of the economy per year to pay it off over 10 years, the economy would implode. In fact they have been borrowing more to support the economy. The inexorable rise in the debt is shown here:https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/government-debt-to-gdpThe only solution is to inflate it away which means letting the buying power of the dollar tank.By contrast the debt to GDP ratios of most countries is far lower: Russia 14% ; Sweden 35% Germany 49% etc. France is 116% so forget that! Japan 237% forget that!You need to not hold dollars or yen but be invested in productive capacity that will hold its value. Also, a significant part of your investment should be outside the US and I have liked Sweden and done well in Swedish stocks traded in the Nasdaq Stockholm for the last 30 years precisely due to their low national debt. The whole large cap amd mid cap sector is worth a look. Www.privataaffarer.se"

SOLD GE AT 7 TO BUY GME AT 275. HOLD THE LINE on gme. ONLY KIDDING.
MONEY FLOW Is picking up...so that is positive and just now MACD went positive.
ant bets on the stock holding above $13 today. $13.23 going down quickly no confidence in this renewable energy hype so complicated explained poorly at best by a French CEO who speaks #$%$ poor English for 5 minutes during a yahoo news story. understood nothing which seems to fit well with this turkey.
The pumpers didn't earn their keep today..... Only up .29 cents. One day soon this stock will close at above $106.Happiness is a reverse split coming. Bank on it.
Does GE have plans for higher dividends?
Looks like another buying opportunity this morning.
Bullish again $1
"Just because a stock is up for 1 day, 1 month, 3 months, YTD, 6 months, and 1 year doesn't really mean anything! lol"
"The comments from Dragos are the best I have received on the board. I was thinking of just leaving this board - too many hecklers and uninformed postings. But it is refreshing to have a serious discussion, so here is my answer...Nelson Peltz, head of T Rowe Price and a very shrew and ruthless investor, was Larry Culp's roommate in College (my memory). He knew Culp well and had admired the Danaher progress and turn around for 15 years starting around 2000. Nelson Peltz's fund T Rowe Price has the largest GE Position today at 7.6% with 9 billion shares. The next largest GE stockholder is Vangard at 6.94 % and then Fidelity at 4.3% and finally Blackrock at 4%.Not one of these three funds would touch GE with a stick if they were not rock hard solid in support. All are the best shrewdist investors in the stock market.The story is that when times at GE were so bad - Peltz locked himself into a room for a weekend and thought long and hard about GE. He decided to gamble and increase his GE investment, adding to the extremely higher quantity one owned now. Ed Gardner on the GE Board is the second top person at T Rowe Price. Your comments on Culp refusing at first and then coming on the GE Board and only agreeing when he had full support is the same one I know. They had to pay Culp a lot of money to intice him ($240 million challenge he will meet), since he was retired from Danafer and teaching business at Harvard and enjoying the less pressured life. Culp was admired in 2015 and well acknowledged and certainly had lots od Danafer money (stocks, options, and pay) over 15 years.He saw something clearly in the GE future and he is playing it out. I think the Biopharma sale was incredibly clever. The GECAS will also be incredibly clever. The reverse 8:1 split will clean up a real price problem. Do not expect dividends soon, and the mergers will be smaller and slower and better thought out with some of the finest minds looking at them.I have watched GE since 1970's and never bought. It was way overpriced for me and not run well under Jack Welch. Reminded me of Rudy Gulianti. I never bought GE but I watched for ""someday"" maybe....But when I saw the $5.98 price last August-September I could not resist. At first it was a struggle but I bought a very large position and knew the vaccine would change everything. It has. I did not know that much abut Culp except his gamble for $16.64 stock price to get his $240 million bonus - but once I watched him and looked back at his history, I knew very few could do what he is doing. It is remarkable. I admire a CEO that can drive up stock prices by achievements.It is offensive to see posters on this board shooting off what they know little about. Anti comments like reverse stock splits and Culp's large payment and all that junk is just demeaning. I won't go into that part but I can tell you if they knew the deep roots GE has worldwide they would also stand in awe. They are everywhere and in everything. They built 37% general aviation engines and 27% military engines and produced 66% of all jet engines on this planet. Incredible position. Amazing....Like you I am wondering on why GE was factoring because they should have been cash strong by now. I am totally in favor of stopping factoring and it is my take that the financial numbers coming out are way undervalued while Culp and team go deeper into the restructuring of General Electric.I am not a cheerleader. I am simply a realist that has a lot at stake. One click and I could sell all my position (stock and call options) and be retired for life over their progress so far. So I watch them carefully every day to see if they are headed wrong."
i am not a regular here just grabbed a bunch of calls for the week can this blast thru 13 by friday ?
"What a beautiful GE chart today. Are we at $12 yet? Didn't think so...Please try harder Baggies. Even after Market down over 1000 points, last Friday's Shorts are STILL in the RED!   So I see they are making lots of noise that they have lost a little less today than they did yesterday.BTW- Don't Forget: BAGGIES= GE Shorts "
"Wow, lucky I dumped my shares yesterday. Will likely buy in again, at some time."
Good Morning to All GE Investors!!!
"when it hits 5 a share will look at it, maybe !"
"If you don't already see it, as GE returns to health, you will realize the genius of Larry Culp!"
"The day they announced Culp was taking over, I said the first thing he should do is RS the stock. That was the time to do it. Get it over with. For the size of this company it has WAY too many shares for sure. Doing it into a big run up was the worst way to do it. He basically killed your investment and has done several other deals that were NOT share holder friendly at all. All in the name of saving GE. His compensation pkg says different. So, i will ask the same thing after every ""deal"". How much of the BKR sale today goes to debt. Not refinancing the debt but PAYING IT OFF. That is what he needs to do instead of claiming to and NOT paying it off. This guy is no better then the last few. smh at this company."
Take it easy guys this is not GME is harder to be manipulated or played . This will go up now.
"Although i am not sold on having fewer shares, i am hoping it does stabilize the share prices from the shorting, etc. GE is well positioned and should benefit from the balance of this year and going forward."
"OMG, Rick says GE tanks, GE down 6 cents, OMG, the world is coming to an end, OMG I better sell now !."
"DOW up over 100, this pig down 1%. This stock had numerous upgrades, but they did not help the stock price. Us shorts control how GE is trading. Hey BAGGIES, Who's your daddy."
How are you voting on this reverse stock split???
"GE’s proposed reverse split would effectively multiply the stock price by eight, while reducing the number of shares outstanding to about 1.1 billion. The shareholders approved the split, the split will go into effect at the discretion of GE’s board, at any time before the first anniversary of the May 4, 2021 annual meeting."
GE has something going on Japan. Do you know the dollar amount this deal is?
The momentum is so huge. We don't know where it will stop. It could go up to 5% today. Keep it on the radar!
If Culp doubles sh in a year what wrong with doubling it again in the next year. The rs tossed GE right on it's ear was a very bad move
Management has dug GE grave. double in 6 mo was either not good enough or too good. Stock will do nothing at best.
GE stock been stagnant for the past 3 months and ever since the news of RS. Basically the management chocked the stock price and blocked it from advancing. Very sad that it can’t even hold on to a 20 cents gain every single day despite more than a dozen of good news.

why is this red so long ???? this was a top stock a week ago
They cut the dividend few years ago so its been dead money for me and now reverse stock spit. Why stay invested in this company?What is easier a share of stock going from 10 to 20 or 100 to 200?You want to lower the number of share ge . Buy back your stock.
"Couple of wrong moves yesterday, sold 'X at $22..30and bought GE at 12.05 .today X is up to $24."
This is a great entry price. Gotta love a deal
"Why are there so many people on this board don’t like GE? There are so many overvalued stocks in this overvalued market. Yes, GE had a bad performance last few years because of poor management, but the management has changed and GE is becoming leaner and thinner. GE is still a big company with $80 billion revenue and GE is a market leader almost in each business sector. GE’s business is affected by COVID-19 and some business are cyclical. These business will recover over time. I really don’t understand why these bear people’s thinking. Are your bears shorting GE? Can you enlighten me why you are bearish on GE? So people dislike GE, but why? There are many better shorts out there, why choose GE? Honestly opinions please."
We can see $14 tomorrow 
"This morning's sellers scalped, hard. Up we go!"
Half of the daily average volume traded in 24 minutes.
This happens almost every time......GE has allergy to GREEN and UP BEAT MARKET DAY......and does not hold to its 20 cents morning gain letting it fade away by the closing time.....and today is no exception even when earning is only 2 days away......very disappointing if you ask me......................................though I am still bullish for the long but near term it has been disappointing......
Goldman and Morgan margin calls friday. Everything will be fine. Keep buying.
"Like I've said before at this current price per share $GE is dirt bottom cheap, buy as many shares as you can afford meaning money that won't be needed to pay bills, put food on the table, etc. Yes there will be pull backs on share prices and advancements also. Even if the stock were to get approved for the reverse split, the every common blue collar worker can still purchase fractional shares and that's done with Tesla, Berkshire, Amazon, Priceline, Zoom etc, you name it and you can own a piece of America."
"If we get any more good news about GE, this bag holder is going to get a biggie bag at Wendy's. If we get that 8 for 1 stock split and GE share price hit's Tusa's target----5.00 bucks. It's just enough for that Biggie bag. Thank God."

Will there come a time when GE pays a 5% dividend again? I think so. I believe it’s part of the plan.
just go ahead & put GE back in the DOW industrial average & be done with it!!!
I feel bad for whoever sold yesterday. Scared money makes no money!!!
I have had GE shares for a long time. Had a few thousands shares at average cost of $25 per share when the pandemic news pushed the share price way down. I was patient and lucky and bought several thousands mire shares at $6.50 per share . Thus brought my dollar cost average to $9 p/s. Patient pays off. Now I am siting on a Hugh capital gains. I will continue to hold on my GE shares till it reaches to $30 again. Then I will sell and pay my capital gains taxes .
"Told you BAGGIES, 12s are coming. Huge 1Q miss coming in 2 weeks. Great stock to short."
watch this gem close green. bears and shorts about to scatter
GE is a company that wants to give the CEO hundreds of millions of dollars and reduce shareholder count by 80% it is a recipe for disaster nothing else.
$14 this week
"CULP makes small acquisition in medical area, at Danaher he acquired companies at the rate of one a month, many more too come ,stock on the way to $25, have fun ""SHORTS"" you all will be a buyer with the rest of us ""LONGS"" I'm buying more and more every day"
I got a secret for CEO culp. Nothing moves market more than ppl buying it
FYI- Since September 2020.... GE baggies = Shorts! :)
RS plan holding Ge head under 14.00 Plus it is loaded with depth and cannot make money. Is the rs a done deal?
"they are doing story after story of positive spin all day long on MSNBC about GE. of course GE owns NBC, so....... gimme a break"
RS leads to despondency. Don't forget that. Anyone with 1000 shares will suddenly look and see 125 shares.
Is Tsinoy Texas Boy real? It's like if it was at $15 he would be begging for it to go down to 14.50. Maybe he should buy :)

How pathetically disfunctional the stock market is GE is priced, and is still priced lower than ZEROO Revenue stocks, tinny tinny rev stocks, stocks that have rev fall off the cliff, stocks that are burning cash like paper on gasoline..Amazing what GE is held against for no good reason or explanation, other than FALSE NEGATIVE NARRATIVES.."
All this negative reaction to GE makes me more confident that a large uptick is in the foreseeable future. Im holding on.
New analysis indicated that GE is a buy at current levels. GE may surprise investors with its up beat earnings this month. Dividends may return as well. Hope to hear that RS is postponed for now due to outcry of investors if not canceled all together. Good luck.
Maybe a 1 for 8 reverse split isn't such a good idea? See you all post earnings at $11.50.
I'm glad I got on board...
GE - still very much undervalued given the strong likelihood of a booming reopening economy.
"I don't like the idea of a reverse split 8 to 1, but then investors have no choice but to resign to that change. The number of shares will be reduced to 8.74/8 = 1.0925 billion shares. The new share price will be $14x8=$112. The value of GE in your portfolio remains the same except for the number of shares you have will be divided by 8. Unfortunately, some investors will only look at the number of shares, and when they see their 800 shares are now 100 they freak out. Selling your shares is the least wise thing to do. Just hang in there and the share price could easily double within a year. Culb knows what he is doing."
"CULP needs to step up,and show the world what's going to be done with the massive cash in terms of M&A like he did at DANAHER, maybe bet his own fortune and BUY 5illlion shares"
"So, GE grew 100% since September. Then it gave back 20% (on a supposed, potential, hypothetical RS). Now back on track for its next leg up...In detail:First established a floor at $6.75.Then established a floor at $11 Next established floor will be $18 in May.Simple math. Trust GuillermoStay greedy my friends"
Up up
Here is my prediction after the 8:1. GE will be heavily shorted. From 100$ to 10$ is a golden road for hedgies. They will never let this opportunity let go
"Based on technical analysis and RSI, GE is very bullish going into earnings. If overall market holds then X can reach 15 in this cycle if they beat both top and bottom line."
"they play the price game now, sell 10 shares as low as possible price, then buy back 10k, ..... because GE will fly soon."
"GE dropped under $13 and tested $12.8. It bounced back above $13 now. There is a great support under $13. Thus, GE is a great buy when it drop under $13! My projected trading range for this week was $12.75 to $13.8 and close around $13.5 based on the option contracts. So far, the low end trading range of my projection has been full filled. Will it test $13.8 before Friday? I still think it will. It should rise above $13.5 at least and close near $13.5 this Friday."
now is the time to jump in big move coming
"Low Li Fe Nasir, Lisa, Dan and Cap. Bottom feeders for sure."

Ge working on app for Iphone to detect viruses in two years? If that's true it would be pretty interesting!
"Folks do not panic, RS will not happen specially a 1 to 8 split. There is no need for that and management have not made any decision yet. It is to be debated and voted on in MAY. Most likely shareholders will oppose and block it... Very disappoint myself of the timing of its announcement, it totally ruined the good news of all the upgrade and the $31B deal...............I am sitting tight and keep accumulating as much as I can"
"Barclay's just today raised its price target from $15 to $16 - Wednesday, 19th."
"I suspect the rejection of the CEO compensation package is due to recent memories of Immelt's golden parachute of $250M after he almost bankrupted the company. Mr. Culp is off to a great start but still has a lot to prove, even for a $230M bonus when his employees are lucky to get 3% annual raises."
If there is no bounce back by close look out 11.35-11.50 tomorrow.

overly intelligent people are not good at stocks..... or we would live in a different world... just because you can buy something doesnt mean you're making a good deal 
There are a few more days left in March and so everybody is wrapping up their financial positions for the month and get ready for new positions in April. Money has been moved to retails the last 3-4 weeks. Will it be moved to Industrial sector in the next 3-4 weeks? That's the question.
So Barons is still quoting Tusa who has been downgrading the company from it low of 5.48. The stock has gained over $60 billion in market in sync with his downgrading. And to think he is making a 6 figures income with bonuses for spewing out his BS. One wonders if his firm bought shares every time he launched into his downgrading.
"If RS is so bad , when will we see a drop in share price and how low will it go"
"I'll give you 8 dollars and you give me 1, thank you!. Said, no one, ever!"
"Understanding GE stock price on April 1st 2021 is easy to understandUntil GE reports results April 27th- it cannot move much either wayIf 64% of the stock is now owned by 1740 hedge funds and they are not tradingAnd if there is a vote going on for an 8:1 reverse stock split that obviously will passAnd if you believe the CFO of GE that they will have a narrow miss on profits for Q1Then it is obvious that any serious investor will simply wait 3-1/2 weeks to see the next cards.So the stock is stock in a range between $12 and $13-1/2How about bit of prophecy (imagining)Suppose that all the good news at GE gives them an actual slim profit in Q1, andSuppose that they give an upward FCF (really just plain profit) of perhaps $6.5-$8.5 billion for 2021And suppose that they have completely understated the Renewables potential and it really turns the cornerAnd what if GE Capital actually has surprise reducing liabilities and surprise increasing in value assetsAnd who knows what is happening and is running forward in all the GE Research labs and plants worldwide?Then GE stock will reasonably price at 23 times earnings or potentially around $20.Now it may not be a case that the stock rockets right up to the $20 price in 4 weeks.It may take Q2 results or even Q3 results to get that motion. But by the Q4 results you can bank on it that GE stock will definitely be far higher than it is todayFor the Q1 pricing I thing $15 a share is extremely likely….But here is what you need to think about going forward….if you believe all the GE News of breakthrough medical scanning devices (MRI, sonic, kidney detectors, etc)If you believe all the news that GE is rebuilding power plants using much more environmentally sensitive equipment (Pueblo, Nepal, Rocky Reach Dam, Washington State) and other places If you believe that GE has lead US new renewables for the past 2 years and is the winner in Oklahoma, Martha’s Vineyard, New Jersey, Dogger Bank, Spain, Turkey, Viet Nam) and other placesIf you believe that GE Offshore is leading and Vestas and Siemens are only announcing but GE is actually installing large Offshore Wind turbines in many places (Dogger, Martha’s Vineyard, New Jersey, Denmark), andIf you believe that GE will get a decent part of the new Biden environmental energy money to enlarge their future profits, andIf you believe that the US licensing Wind turbines will now be expedited and fossil fuels will be de-emphasized, andIf you believe aviation is rapidly coming back fast and toward past numbers and is now at least at 60% of normal - but headed to maybe 80% of normal by the end of this year, andIf you believe that the airlines are buyig new planed using the new GE 9X engines (Max, Southwest Airlines 100 plane order, Alaska Airlines 23 plane order) and more, andIf you thing divesting GE Capital of GECAS to AerCap was a smart deal, and If you think reducing the GE payroll in 2 years from 330,000 to 150,000 employees, andIf you think taking debt over the past 2 years from $120 billion headed to $25 billion by another year or so, andIf you think funding the GE Pension from 70% two years ago to at least 82% presently, andIf you think energizing the remaining work force with new enthusiasm and better work results will make a difference …. And lastlyIf you believe Larry Culp holds his cards close to the vest and traditionally announces better results than they predicted This is an exercise in patience – which most people have little of todayWhat is important is you look at the almost daily announcements on new contracts, technology, changers in the actual company for the better, and all that.You must see clearly that there is no logical reason that GE will not advance this year. And next year, and the following year.Speculating on a $20 a share price or a $30 a share price, or even a $40 a share price in the next couple of years is total"
I honestly don't see GE going to $4 anytime soon.
Hopefully tomorrow Culp delivers the final blow to JP Morgan's bear vitriol. Good riddance.
At closing today:RTX - $82.81 per share.GE - $107.92 per share (on after split basis) Will you invest GE or RTX and why?
"THE “BOARD SHOULD BE SHOT”: LARRY CULP’S PANDEMIC-YEAR STOCK DEAL IS PUTTING GE IN THE HOT SEATWhen Equilar, the executive compensation experts, published its annual list in April of CEOs of public companies with the highest compensation for 2020, there was a surprising name at the top of the list: Larry Culp, the chairman and CEO of GE. Equilar listed Culp’s compensation at about $72.7 million, up 208% from the year before. Equilar’s calculation appeared to include the value of $57.1 million for a contingent stock grant that the GE board of directors awarded Culp last August. That stock grant has turned out to be worth a lot more than $57.1 million. Four months later, in December, the GE stock price rose sufficiently from August for Culp to get an award of about 4.65 million shares, now worth about $60.5 million. Then, on May 7, as a result of a further rise in GE’s stock, Culp received an additional approximately 4.65 million GE shares, worth another roughly $60.5 million. For those keeping score, that’s some $120 million worth of GE stock for Culp since August. What’s more, the stock has barely budged since Culp took over GE in October 2018, when it was around $12.40 per share. Nowadays, the stock is around $13 a share, or up about 5%, at a time when the Dow Jones Industrial Average, of which GE was once the longest-tenured component, has risen some 28%.

What’s the driver for the US Market going forward. Guess that’s my question which is much broader than GE. What comes after this stimulus bill? Is the Market in general due for a correction?
Reverse splits are usually a last ditch effort to save a company. Wonder what the underlying issue here is???
It's not going to go down anymore. Positive sentiment is too high and the fact is the reverse stock split isn't a negative in the long run. Travel Surge on the way!
it ain't over til it's over
GE. 
"So much negativity surrounding this news. The company isn't failing, but actually getting better. Retail investors will have a harder time to buy but day traders and shorts will most likely get swept away. Institutional buying will increase, that's what moves the share price. I'm holding."
"It was physiological. The stock ran non-stop from $6 to $14. Over 100% in 3 months, one of the best runs in 40+ years! Temporarily losing 20% was NORMAL. The company is in its best shape it has been and everyone now wants in. Even Tusa has a HOLD rating, LAUGHABLE!Conspiracy theorist would see last slump as a way for big banks to jump on the train before it reaches the $20 station in the next weeks. Believe what you want to believe. Just remember to stay greedy with your GE shares, you won't regret it!"
"GE is behaving as it expected, preparing to test $13.8 and $14 by this Friday. Yesterday Bears analyst John Inch had a bearish interview show before the market open yesterday. Bears tried to push GE stock down, but only to $13.26. It shows underlying strength of buying waiting ￼at $13.25. Traders see failed attempt, quickly reverse the trend and now bulls are taking in charge and trying to push GE higher to test $13.8 and $14 this week. Next two weeks, GE will test $14.46 to prepare a big breakout. If the earnings and outlook is good, GE will breakout and trading at $16 to $17. GE’s time is coming. Stay tuned!"

Ok... First-Stage of Lift-Off today has been completed...
"Lots of uncertainty this morning. Wall street doesn't want to appear to frightening to all of those new investors that will be receiving a large cash infusion via stimulus. Other than big cap tech seems generally a down day. GE will hover lower, might test $12's and should close fairly flat to slightly down."
"jj, tell us how much you lost on $GE, $SRRA and $NKLA so far? We'll wait."
This will probably end up being $40 - $50 a share after the reverse split.
This stock is back under $13.00 where it belongs! Only going down from here! All the liberals that preach the Green New Deal should get their facts straight.... Within the first year of owning an electric car 20% of all electric vehicle owners switch back to gasoline vehicles. THAT'S A FACT!
Jimmy failed ENG 101 at University of Phoenix.
I am close to bailing. This has to be the most fiduciarily irresponsible and lack of situational awareness decision I've ever seen from a company's top brass that was riding HUGE momentum literally hours before said announcement. This is like losing a set on nothing but double fault services and unforced errors.
OH Happy Day!
"GE is holding the $ 14 level nicely. If the market pulls back, keeping $ 14 will be difficult. On the other hand, high tech money may come in here.P / E is still attractive, prospects are great, management is very good. Strengths only."
Time for Larry to cut back on his massive pay -- shareholders have been ripped for years and GE has been stagnant for a year. Boolean
14.5 jump soon.
"Even though I cant stand GE's managements decisions regarding the RS, This current drop is just BS by insiders designed to scare off the little guys before a run up at the close. Don't let them take your profits this easily."
Is it possible that after a 1-8 RS GE will buy back its shares at a much higher price? Any insightful thoughts on this?
How the hell does a company with negative cash flow per share have a stock price of $53 and is rising today while this stock which has positive cash flow per share is tanking simply on the news of a reverse split. Maybe it's the merging with a company that has that negative cash flow. Who eff knows really. This stock has been taking a beating since 2017 and it's unrelenting. The numbers aren't making sense.
GE withstood another day of short attack. The bears likes to bring down GE under $13 to form bearish pattern. It failed again. Prepare for GE gain momentum and raise to $13.5 to $14 next week.
GE is on the way to $15.00.
"ANYONE who knows ANYTHING about stocks is that the trend is your friend !. GE is constantly bouncing off the 50 DMA, just look at the chart. The trend is your friend !. GE has bounced off the lows after the RS announcement. That means institutions and mutual funds don't take this as negative, but that GE is reducing the # of outstanding shares and reducing volatility. Good move without having to buy back shares. Good move, thinking outside of the box, I love it. Bought more yesterday and looking forward to continuing the 50 DMA UP !."
Drop incoming...
Glad i did not sell last week after reverse split news ...i still dont like the split and will vote against it ...

Cutting debt by selling off the company to survive was necessary, but he needs to show that what is left at GE can generate a lot of FCF and the dividend will be increased soon. While modesty is good, too much makes a company look weak and ready for retirement. GE is not taking advantage of the move to EV's - why isn't GE developing fast charge networks along with its renewable power portfolio?"
Super R Squad.GE world domination!
Gotta love the BA Max 737 jet orders. The way the competitions engines have been experiencing issues as of late they would be silly not to opt for the GE made engines. RollsRoyce trying to fix its turban blade issues.GLTA especially the longs.
As I posted yesterday AM - blowoff bottom then up - and here we are. Life goes on GE goes up
Anybody adding shares to compensate for the odd 1 for 8 ratio?
Good Morning
"Nothing but range trading.Peaks - $14, $13.61, $13.30valleys - $12.27, $12.50, ????Call me after the RS."
"I LOVE this ""garbage"" stock (per JJ, J J, and other shorts). I am up 15% on my June 13 CALLS, and up 55% on my Jan 10 CALLS. Plus up nicely on the stock itself. I LOVE GE and Culp !. I love the RS and apparently so do the institutions."
"Good morning BAGGIES, 6 days to 1Q earnings then timber. GE to miss, then stock drops like a rock. Great short opportunity."
"GE stock will close over $14.25 this week, maybe a few DIRECTORS start insider buying"
"$20/share when air travel gets close to normal, $25- $30/share when GECAS debt is paid early next year."
Larry Culp is No Elon Musk Shorts used to dog him he solved the problem to the delight of shareholders. Culp is a punk for even worrying about the SP. He has lost my confidence sorry
Q2 2021 to Q1 2021 GE will do Magic. We will be in the lower 20s. Acquired 30k yesterday in lower avg $13.10 ... Easy money. Thanks to Larry Culp the best CEO in industrials right at this moment.
Morgan Stanley just put on a very bullish call on GE
"The war between the bull and the bear has always been there. For GE, the bull has been so strong at this time if you check the chart. It is an uptrend chart. You have less than 2 weeks to decide before the earnings release."
GE will be closed over 14 today.
"Exactly what I thought... They plan on selling their 46% interest in the combined entity, later down the road. Likely after the industry has recovered. This will be more revenue to pay off debt and continue to get them back to being a core industrial company... This is going to be a VERY good long term move for GE."
"At 11:30 am on May 21, 2021 GE stock is slightly ahead of last Friday's stock closing price."
25 cent down on earnings day? That is a clear as day signal to load up. Buy.
Stock market to remain low for few more days since it was advanced quite a bit now it needs to breathe. Not helping GE
"If you invest in GE, you will not go wrong. Look at our market cap"
Anyone checked Ford Motors share price lately? Next is GE's turn ?
"GE too big and inefficient. Work force structure is innundated with middle managers. Middle managers below other middle managers. Very difficult to stay profitable in competitive markets. I do like some of their products in imaging, but if I had to sit on the phone and try to get info out of one more 2 bit middle manager. They all running around: I middle managa, I middle managa."
"GE doesn’t have money to buyback shares, the reverse split for them is the best option. Don’t agree or disagree. But this is a great company that is cleaning out it’s debt and becoming a powerhouse again. Invest or don’t. NO ONE CARES"
"GE owned 377,427,884 shares of BKRGE have sold off 109,680,947 shares of BKRGE's average sale price was $18.95 (based on BKR's volume weighted average)GE currently owns 25% of BKR shares, down from 36.5%"
Trading below the 50 DMA ...Watch out below...
Look ate the 6month chart looks good. What makes me think is doubling the stock price of today very soon. Let’s watch it
GE is the kind of stock you just buy and forget it. It will be in the $20s soon enough. I used to work for them at Power Systems in Atlanta. If they get that turned around --- watch out. We will go to the $40s. Culp just may be the best CEO in the world right now.
"trustco bank, another Schenectady ny institution just proposed the same thing--interesting--the one thing I will say--a single digit stock is easily manipulated 10% at a time , and risk tolerant funds wont buy into that"
How much more tomorrow?
Less shares for the shorts to manipulate the stock
"If I had a nickel, for every time someone said that GE would be $14, or $17, or $20 by next week, I’d have more money than if I was long the stock!"
"If you have 10,000 shares like me and I'm dreaming this will hit a newer high let's say I paid 6.00 I'm at better than a double up in profit now .but I wait for the split well my shares go down and I'll never see these numbers again so for me I'll step out and play another day ,take my money and run cause I don't marry stocks especially doing a reverse,,go the other way I'm all in .shows weakness to me !!!!!"
"GE is not racing to $17 per Markus or dropping to $5 per Tusa. I wonder why? If you buy 8 shares right now, GE will take 7 of it."
The board should be looking at clawing back Immelt’s pay for the mismanagement and malfeasance during his tenure. He nearly ruined GE for good. Still sticks in my craw he was flying around with not one but two GE jets in case one broke down. Made millions and lost $150B in shareholder value and nearly drove GE out of business.
"If GE can break 14.14 today, it should make a huge runTomorrow the house will approve stimulus and Wednesday GE will discuss their outlookThis week is looking up"
Culps solution to lack of earning is to cast dark cloud over the stock with reverse split. He has no trouble taking hundreds of millions for himself instead of adding it to the bottom line
"""The numbers for GE weren't pretty. Revenue was down 12% year over year, with total orders falling a slightly steeper 13%. General Electric was just barely able to earn an adjusted profit of $0.03 per share, overcoming a drop of 20% in adjusted profit from the GE Industrial business.Looking more closely at GE's business units, the renewable energy segment stood out for its ongoing progress. Revenue inched higher by 2%, but orders jumped 15%, and segment losses narrowed by 28%. By contrast, the power segment saw a 3% drop in sales on a 12% order decline, and the aviation segment bore the brunt of the pressure, with a 28% revenue decline sending segment profit down by 36% year over year. Healthcare also performed poorly."""

"U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said this week that the Federal Reserve may have to raise interest rates in the future to cool off an economy moving too fast.“It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy,” Yellen said in a taped interview with The Atlantic, which aired Tuesday."
"$$GE to $50, most SEVERELY UNDERVALUED, CASH $$130 Bn & Liqdt..GEAS Rev $5 Billion, Sold for $$30 BILLION CASH and 46% Ownership of the new joint entity.. EXCELENT SUPER FINANCIALLY BENEFICIAL TRANSACTION..BioPharma Rev $4 Billion, Sold for $$22 BILLION CASH.. Should hv been $$60 BILLION price.

BKR Balance Sheet is STRONGEST of all in oil and oil-service technology, even tech stocks. Please look at BKR Balance Sheet..Either way, I think Wallatreet has huge big plans for GE FUTURE DIRECTION, therefore the changes and repositioning of GE, to move it direction of GROWTH acquisitions, that would explain why GE keeps piling on mountain of $$$CASH $$130 BILLION and LIQUIDITY ($45bn in USA+ $30bn abroad China Asia EU etc,+ $30 bn sale of GEAS finance, + $25bn Line of credit).."
close green ?
"Reverse stock splits almost never work out short term at least. So GE will most likely start trading around $100 a share. Really? Why price the stock so high when many investors still remember all the nonsense GE engaged in during the previous years. I think the fact that the stock was priced very reasonably that the average investor was willing to take a chance. At around $100 a share, I think GE just priced it out of the average retail investor's price range."
Another worthless day owning GE
The RS plan will most likely be cancelled .....the management team would have known by now how damaging it is to the share price .....just wait for it to be announced
Lots of censoring here today. totalitarianism Rocks!
"One of the best turn around companies out there is BAC and the CEO is a lawyer. Imagine that. Ford and GE have MBA CEOs and they are stuck in perpetual turnaround, continually playing hanky-panky with investors. And they always have some praise singers telling everyone to wait, tomorrow you will be very rich."
$30B plus 46% ownership with the combined company? That’s a great news
"The reason given by GE for the RS is that GE wants to be like its peers in terms of share count and share price. Basically, it sounds to me like GE wants to fix the books after asset sales and dividend cuts and prepare the grounds for more borrowing. I like a company that will work hard to improve revenue and buyback shares. I don't like companies that execute reverse splits."
"I LOVE GE !. Chart continues upward. If the RS will be negative it would already have crashed the stock. Institutions and mutual funds are not stupid, if they thought it would have a negative effect on the stock they would have already baied and it would already have had a major effect on the stock price. Market down today GE up, this is not indictivate of a stock that is doomed. Contrary, it is a sign that there is major support and not from traders on Yahoo that own a few thousand shares or even 10K shares. holders like me mean nothing. Follow the strength not weaklings like JJ or J J or Mike."
"Awww, what happened? Did u think GE would go down some more?"
Algo selling erroneously hitched to GE. Buy.
Shorts are quiet today because they all passed out on news of upgrade from Citibank this morning.
$14 plus today 
Looks like another up day for the DOW. GE red premarket. Thank you GE board for destroying GEs market cap. The GECAS transaction has been wiped out due to market cap loss. Brilliant idea.
"I sold everything b/c of the albatros reverse split hanging over the stock (they completely ruined the investment with that). Good luck to all who stick it thru. I'll be buying in again after the RS Cloud disappears. I guess that'll be the next ""bottom-feeder"" price.... and that's my game. Can't risk it 'til then."
If you keep listening to the shorts like the one at JP Morgan you'll end up like the poor guy in the GIF below. $GE is set to double this year alone based on chart price movement.
Don't Worry...Be Happy! :)
"Benzinga-LogoGeneral Electric's Stock Is Tightening For A MoveMelanie SchafferMay 21, 2021General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE) announced on Wednesday its partnership with Ares Management Corporation (NYSE:ARES) has been updated to include a 302MW agreement with Lincoln Land Wind. The deal, which will be completed by year-end 2021, includes 107 GE 2.82-127 turbines and a 20-year full-service agreement.Over the past 12 months, General Electric and Ares Management have announced over 800MW together as the companies work to transition toward sustainable and renewable energy.Also on Wednesday, Barclays raised its price target on General Electric to $16 and maintained an overweight rating.General Electric’s stock had a 136% meteoric rise between October 2020 and March 2021 and has since traded sideways in consolidation. General Electric’s daily trading range is tightening, however, and could be getting ready for another big move.The GE Chart: Over the course of the last two months, General Electric’s daily trading range has become smaller and on Thursday GE only fluctuated 19 cents – between $12.92 and $13.11. GE has been trading in a sideways channel above a support level at $12.90 and below a resistance level at $13.79GE's stock is being held down by both the eight-day exponential moving average (EMA) and the 21-day EMA. The eight-day EMA is also trending slightly below the 21-day EMA which is bearish. GE is trading well above the 200-day simple moving average, however, which indicates overall sentiment in the stock is bullish.Bulls want to see GE's stock regain the eight-day and 21-day EMAs as support. If GE can pop over its EMAs, it has room to move back up to the $13.80 level. If it could regain that level as support it could move toward the $15 mark which is resistance from back in 2018.Bears want to see the eight-day and 21-day EMAs continue to push GE's stock down until it loses support at $12.90. If the stock falls below that it could fall to $12.23 before finding another support level.GE Price Action: Shares of GE were trading up 1% at $13.19.Benzinga"
"If GE beats earnings, I will transition into a non-binary person..."
"Pumped up on Wednesday to sell Call Options for next week, dribbling down the next couple of days to pocket the premium for this week's $13 call options and next week's $13.5 call options.. Rinse , Repeat!"

"Just 25% increase from current price, Culp wins 232 million. Let us do some pumping guys. Where are the analyst? Let's push it."
I'm not a biden guy but GE is a biden pick.
"Hmmm...looks like bets are being placed on May 7th, 13.50 calls and June 18th, 15 calls."
Cheapest stock in the sp 500. 
green day coming for GE.too many positive fundamentals in the market.early red is stop loss take out.
looks like a clean up to $13. 
@Dan (the other Dan) check your past posts. farmer had a cow because we both told him to look at the charts. Lol
I think your money are more safety in Dogecoin than GE.
20 to 25 is coming 
"It may not be evident this early to everyone, but GE is getting ready to rejoin the DOW...once every one realizes this, the stampede will begin...but it will be to late to catch most of the gains by that point...JMHO."
all the good news on Friday yet only 63m shares traded? Ge used to easily trade over 100m shares a day. Monday will have interesting opening
"Reverse split does not change market value, FCF,, profitability and does not change the operations in any way. The run up is based on fundamentals...the drop premarket is based on nonsense. Robinhood investors buying 2 shares at a time are not what is driving the stock up when there are 8.6 billion shares. So forcing investors to buy 8 shares at a time only excludes guys like JJ that can only afford to buy or short one share. Lol. The deal that he did does functionally change cash and value.I’m holding on...one day bump is not shaking me"
"ANOTHER TYPICAL DAY FOR GE... up 30 cents at the open, down by the closing time....................................not much excitement about the tomorrow...."
Bear Market started in Jan '21...
We’ve got the powerWatch it now
"Where is 5.00 baggies, or the bankruptcy, extra large baggies."
"If the reverse is a great idea why is GE getting clobbered on a big up day ? Just when it had started gaining traction and upgrades . How does a reverse make any sense ?The one poster talks about decreased volumes from day trading like GME . What ? When GME and AMC were under 5 voulumes were low , when they ended up 65, 75,100 plus volumes were insanely high from the day traders .Hardly think lowervolume is a reason. Last I recalled Apple is 119 and trades a bit heavy lol ."
CEO picked a very bad time to mess with the shares.
"JJ......A better question........How is your short of approx 628,000 shares (your numbers) doing? After your good fortune to ride 1,100,000 shares from the 6 area to 14, making approx 8,000,000..........and another trade making a little over 3,000,000...........with all of your millions why do you still bash?We are enjoying your humor immensely but get a few new lines.........kinda getting boring."
Maybe the board will give Me Culp a reverse compensation package
"Baggies keep pumping!! LOL,LOL,LOL,... Only down a little on a 200+ market day!"
Does anyone know when reverse split is happening
What's the real reason for the reverse split that GE is not telling us?
Some big HFT caught flatfooted on the UBS upgrade pre-market. Now trying to keep its thumb in the dike from drowning. Buy.
The dust yet to settle...downgrades will start pouring in....big buyers will cash out and wait for the stock to dive further after the split...new buyers will be scared off and more and more.....One of the most badly and untimed announcement...........
Prior to earnings GE was averaging 114 Mil volumeI am hoping today is the start of a return to that trend
Thank you Larry Culp!
"Something the market seems to be overlooking is that GE was expected to sell the leasing unit for about $30 billion with terms unknown (maybe deferred). So, an okay to moderate deal was priced into the stock. However, what was announced this morning was a significantly better deal. The leasing unit was sold at around $50 billion in value -- $26 billion in cash, upfront (which is a lot better than $30 on ""terms""), and the rest in stock in the new company.GE stock should be up by at least a dollar a share based on that news, maybe $1.50 at least during the day, with a close at $15. This drop has all to do with the reverse split which demonstrates how retail investors don't like that move. I think it's wrong but it's not $1.80 per current share wrong. Institutions are smart enough to know this and I suspect they are buying and will continue to buy because this is a short term opportunity to get the shares on sale. Plus, the leasing co sale was far better than expected.I'm going out on a limb here and calling the stock to rally back and close the week at $15 or better.Go, GE!Good luck, longs."
Like I said before this CEO picked a Very bad time to play shenanigans with people stock
Adding around 10. This will go back to 15 soon
There must be some really bad news heading our way.
I like General Electric...eom
Say goodnight bears. Back to hibernation
The next 12 months will set new records for air travel. GE will be a prime beneficiary.
"What's the bull case for GE? I was in before because the P/E was so low, and I was positive about GE's connection to wind turbines. I got out when the price came up to a satisfactory level. I somewhat regret getting out, but I'm hesitant about buying back in. I love the enthusiasm that I see here, but P/E is now 24.5. There's still some room, but other profitable companies I'm in are getting killed right now for having higher multiples. If anyone has an argument for a higher price, I'd love to hear it. I like that people are happy about the new CEO."
Time to cover the faucet just keeps opening with pent up demand.
Even though management is saying they doing the reverse stock split for business reasons is anybody else worried this a bad sign?
Strategically it is the right thing to do for the company and leads to long-term success. The problem is that it cuts out the little guy. Simply put the average investor cannot afford to accumulate a $104 stock the way they can a $10 stock. The leasing deal actually was BETTER than expected for GE.
"Selling none core business to lower debt is a good strategy,BUT not enough.....Culp has to increase core business results....Revenue and earnings....Then,share will climb strong...."
show me 14.40 where it traded the day RS was announced and I WILL STOP COMPLAING
Let's see what happens into the close today. 
Market ready to crash GE leading the way
"If it wasn’t the RS bomb shell, with a good day market saw today, And the $31B deal, we would have most likely cross over to $15. Sadly it was ruined. Not expected such a news on such a nice day. But I guess Culp had to say it since it was talked about among the board members. If big cheese shareholders oppose it, it could be canceled. Let’s vote and SAY NEY to RS."
Wow look at yesterday TSA check point numbers 1.6 million highest since pandemic started Very good new for Ge Aviation Bad news for short jj chicken and miss F
FORCES are keeping GE down....makes no sense why it is down today.....
Today chart looks like a landslide. It was triggered by talk of reverse split and hundreds of millions of dollars for CEO
"Ever since TUSA blabbed about how bad & corrupt GE is, we have been having issues with SP. What surprises me is that why GE management did not come out to say anything and are yet to collaborate about it....That's why most investor are skeptical about the company and are not taking firm step to invest in it....I hope tomorrow management will mention about all the accusation lingering around the company to get things straighten up once for ever"
Another pie in the face for jj and Clown Zero. LMAO.
That's one way to make GE shares worth $100. Shareholders don't seem to appreciate it though.
Here come the Renewable Wind orders....every scrambling to get in line before it gets too long!
"Everyday after GE Closing price, JPM T0!L3T Makers Takes away $0.01--$0.03 from GE Closing price.. Nearly everyday, same R!GG!NG MANIPULATION..."
"Guillermo recommends writing to investors relations (just go to the website and find their email address) and ask for the proposal to be tossed ASAP.Remember it is just a proposal.Also with all the positive catalysts and the price per share surging, there is a conspiracy theory this was done to create a lower entry point for new hedgefunds.Stay greedy my friends!"
Should GE distribute the remaining BKR shares to GE investors? They sold over 2B shares at about $18 or so. BKR is now $26.
Back down to sigle digits; good going GE!
Why is BKR up over $1 this morning. The only good news I saw is that GE owns about 25% of BKR down from 36%. GE sold shares at about $18.95. BKR jumped to $21 after the disclosure.
Ge investment style buy high sell low. Baker Huges up %8 yesterday.
fast money think they will cancel their decision to do that reverse split
The second half US economy will be throwing high fastballs to GE.......and GE will begin hitting them into the center field seats. You want to own GE through Spring of 2022 for a 100% gain.
CEO is full of gheet he can't even earn a nickel a share. Now resorting to smoke and mirrors. Wall Street is not fooled. He had his chance and did some good. That has all changed
They say it’s going to be like the lights go on all over the world at the same time this summer!
"Such good news over the last few months and then they go and announce they want a 1:8 reverse stock split. These never end well. Short term, it's going to hurt GE's valuation. Long term, it will probably shake it off as air travel comes back and GE Aviation starts ramping up production again."
$GE needs to build it's support traders on both side of the fence can make money during this time. You're in a better position loading up for a long position during the process.
Great buying opportunity right now.
lol bears/shorts never seem to learn their lesson. This stock likely won't see the $12's again. $14's either this week or next and up from there.
"read my last post. Like it or not, Culp isyour only and best hope to make any money in GE.1760 funds own 62% of GE and all of them will vote for the 8:1 reverse and follow Culp who has doubled the stock in8 months."
"A REVERSE SPLIT = A REVERSAL OF FORTUNEA reverse split is a sign of a shrinking company. Eight to nine billion shares is way to much for the much smaller GE of the future. It has been my experience that in the vast majority of cases where the company has instituted a reverse split the stock declined before the reverse split and for some time after the reverse split. In many cases, the post reverse split shares declined by as much as 70% to 80%. Also, companies that declared reverse splits often register shelf offering to raise capital at the new higher price thus diluting the effect of the reverse split . GE HAS MASSIVE DEBT AND IS MOST LIKELY THE REASON FOR THE REVERSE SPLIT! Many companies that declare reverse splits declare chapter 11 because of the onerous pressures that required management to declare a reverse split in the first place. It is my experience that at the very best it takes a company many years to recover from a reverse split. A reverse split company is more likely to file chapter 11 than it is to survive and in my view GE is no exception.IN MY OPINION A REVERSE SPLIT IS ""NEVER"" A GOOD THING FOR SHAREHOLDERS!!!"
Guy's I think It's safe to say that GE's only going down to flat for the next year. Only thing that might bring back life to this is if Management revises the RS decision and announced a buyback.
Ford took a beating (10%) yesterday.. Was wondering if GE is being set up for a similar hit!
"LOL... for the last month this is the ONLY stock I own that has gone up, and yesterday I was finally able to buy more shares.The stock almost immediately lost value.And now a reverse split.Unbelievable."
"This is a story about GE, That doesn't talk about shr. price ,dividend,or earnings.this is the story about GE ENGINES.Part 1From the turbosupercharger to the world's most powerful commercial jet engine, GE's history of powering the world's aircraft features more than 100 years of innovation.GE Aviation: Powering a Century of FlightWhen the United States entered World War I in 1917, the U.S. government searched for a company to develop the first airplane engine ""booster"" for the fledgling U.S. aviation industry. This booster, or turbosupercharger, installed on a piston engine, used the engine's exhaust gases to drive an air compressor to boost power at higher altitude.GE accepted the challenge first, but another team also requested the chance to develop the turbosupercharger. Contracts were awarded in what was the first military aircraft engine competition in the U.S. Under wartime secrecy, both companies tested and developed various designs until the Army called for a test demonstration.In the bitter atmosphere of Pikes Peak, 14,000 feet above sea level, GE demonstrated a 350-horsepower, turbosupercharged Liberty aircraft engine and entered the business of making airplanes fly higher, faster and with more efficiency than ever before. That mountaintop test of the first turbosupercharger landed GE's first aviation-related government contract and paved the way for GE to become a world leader in jet engines.For more than two decades, GE produced turbosuperchargers that enabled aircraft, including many in service during World War II, to fly higher, with heavier payloads. The company's expertise in turbines and turbosuperchargers figured into the U.S. Army Air Force's decision to select GE to develop the nation's first jet engine.Since then, the aircraft engines division of GE Aviation has scored many firsts. Among them: America's first jet engine, the first turbojet engines to power flights at two and three times the speed of sound, and the world's first high bypass turbofan engine to enter service.Today, GE Aviation is a global provider of engines, systems, and services, with revenues exceeding $30 billion. As a leader in aviation technology, GE Aviation continues to design, develop and manufacture jet engines, components and integrated systems for military, commercial and business and general aircraft as well as aero-derivative gas turbines for marine applications. In addition, GE Aviation is the world's leading integrated engine maintenance resource.GE Builds America's First Jet EngineBecause principles and challenges in turbosuperchargers apply to gas turbines as well, GE was a logical choice to build America's first jet engine.In 1941, the U.S. Army Air Corps picked GE's Lynn, Massachusetts, plant to build a jet engine based on the design of Britain's Sir Frank Whittle. Six months later, on April 18, 1942, GE engineers successfully ran the I-A engine.In October 1942, at Muroc Dry Lake, California, two I-A engines powered the historic first flight of a Bell XP-59A Airacomet aircraft, launching the United States into the Jet Age. The thrust rating of the I-A was 1,250 pounds; the thrust rating of the GE90-115B is more than 90 times as great at 115,000 pounds.The I-A engine incorporated a centrifugal-flow compressor, as did the increasingly more powerful engines developed by GE during the next two years, culminating in the J33 engine, which was rated at 4,000 pounds of thrust. The J33 powered the U.S. Army Air Corps' first operational jet fighter, the P-80 Shooting Star, to a world's speed record of 620 miles per hour in 1947. Before the end of that year, a GE J35 engine powered a Douglas D-558-1 Skystreak to a record-breaking 650 miles per hour. The J35 was the first GE turbojet engine to incorporate an axial-flow compressor--the type of compressor used in all GE engines since then.However, the Air Corps, concerned about disrupting supplies of turbosuperchargers, placed production of GE's jet engines with other manufacturers. GE then set about designing another. The resulting J47 put GE back in the business of building jet engines. But demand for the J47 to power almost all the new front-line military aircraft, particularly the F-86 Sabre Jet, meant the Lynn plant could not keep up. GE needed a second factory.GE selected a federally owned plant near Cincinnati, Ohio, where Wright Aeronautical piston engines had been produced during World War II. GE formally opened the plant on February 28, 1949, with the second J47 production line, to complement the original line at Lynn. Later, the plant would be known as Evendale and would become GE Aviation's world headquarters.With the Korean War boosting demand, the J47 became the world's most produced gas turbine. More than 35,000 J47 engines were delivered by the end of the 1950s. That engine scored two major firsts: it was the first turbojet certified for civil use by the U.S. Civil Aeronautics Administration- and the first to use an elec"

A self inflicted wound. Unintended consequence or intended?
Over the past week very low volume. Everyone is waiting for the Q1 earnings announcement. Aviation will provide a positive surprise for Q1 and the balance of the year. We'll see.
"Free Cash flow trending positive YoYTotal Net Deb going drastically down from 140b in 2017 The rating outlook remains negative. It was already negative, but I'd prefer to have an negative outlook on a deb of 30B instead of 140b !!"
Culp bashers: GE is up 80% since Culp took over 2 1/2 years ago.
"Unless a company has a monster beat across the board & guides strong, the streets looking for any reason to take profits. This round of earning will be messy. Stay liquid and be patient before diving in."
GE is barely out of ICU Now hot shot CEO wants to test the stock of a company that earned 3 cents a share. Good luck with it
"General electric Today went from a number 4 sell for many weeks- to a number 3 hold from Zack’s, I guess it was the new infrastructure bill and some new contracts that improved the rating￼?"
"What we have here is a total disregard for the changes implemented by a superstar CEO....the sentiment was so bad that even good news was greeted with a yawn. No one wanted to own GE....but, then the tide began to change ever so slowly......green shoots appeared....analysts begrudgingly acknowledged that progress was being made....even in the face of a pandemic. Then, it happened....the perma BEAR from JPMorgan changed his tune....not his price target mind you....because that would mean he had made a mistake. No, he just switched from SELL to HOLD.....IMO that's as good as ringing a bell. So, for those of you who held your nose and bought shares during 2020, I say ""well done"". Now, enjoy the ride....and let the hamster run!!"
GE need a big run and not a small walk soon. Otherwise with the bubble forming burst is imminent in the close future which will take GE down as well. GE is lagging the market big time with its small steps forward. I am still long and bullish. Good luck to all
up up and away.....
I rec'd the shareholder voting form today and one of the items to vote on was for a Reverse Split on the stock. Why on Earth would GE want to do a reverse split? Stock has been on a tear...
"let me see, 100 new jets from Southwest times how many engines? Buy."
to All GE Investors!
My decision day is today: I can sell my GE and buy F for the same price. Which one will do better over the next year? They’ve both been down and out and recovered from pandemic lows.
Congratulations to all GE Investors! Great base building today. More project approvals and announcements will keep moving stock higher. Sorry Baggies...GE still not at $12.BTW- Baggies still= GE Shorts! 
"The reverse split does not show confidence on part of management,they do not see the price moving higher without financial engineering.it seems the new CEO has no idea how to turn around the business except through a financial trick called reverse split. GE still depends on old ideas of running businesses if you fail resort to financial engineering, innovation and quality control and new ideas too much for their small brains"
Investors waiting for a few pennies less to buy will regret this on Monday when they will pay more.
they're covering 
Halfway through the trading day we are up $.19. We need a $.14 increase to breakeven for the week. More than $.14 we make money.
If GE is doing so great why is stock lower than it was 9 weeks ago when reverse split was announced. If everyone is so happy about it stock should do more than languish.
"If I understand everything correctly, GE will receive 30 bln USD cash from AERC and will have 49 per cent ownership of the new entity...AERC has a market cap of 8 bln right now. Quite sure that the new entity will have some debts after the deal is finished (but have also plenty of assets)...think it’s a hell of a deal. Culp is smart....At the same time GECAS had 700 m losses last year. So profit of segments will boost, if Aviation will achieve only 40 per cent of the 2019 result. It’s a shame that there was more emotions about RS than real business related matters. Anyhow, don’t know what this guy Tusa is smoking..."
LAKA !! 
"Here's to the hope that shareholders have the common sense to reject the reverse split. The justification that they want to reduce share count to be in line with other blue chip conglomerates, down to 1B shares does nothing. You really want to impress shareholders, achieve the same goal by BUYING back outstanding shares until you hit 1B. That actually would be beneficial."
"More than 150k call option and 100k put options outstanding bid at $13, $13.5 and $14. People who bought $13 and $13.5 call this morning has double and triple their money, but $13.5 call option could expire worthless if you don’t cash out soon since the time value will decrease to 0 in three days. The bears who bought $12.5 and $13 put will loss all. There will be no chance to gain back unless the market crashed. $14 call will expire worthless unless a big good news lifts the price.Good luck to all."
Just looked at the PPS down again? I don't believe it. It was an eyebrow raising experience.
This will be the first reverse stock split that actually turns out favorably. Culp breaks the mold again? Buy.
"Ever notice that Zacks runs these ridiculous articles on GE?""General Electric (GE) Dips More Than Broader Markets: What You Should Know"" These are worthless and yet they run them.. Today if it beats the run of the market... I wonder if the will run one of those "" Its great but BLAH BLAH BLAH... pieces"" Makes you wonder if the are really unbiased? Or caught on the wrong side of a hedge,,,"
"GE looks great , airlines coming back, market up early, "
"We knew when Culp first took on the CEO job that he was the man for the job. The question now is when does he offload Baker Hughes in total. Soon, imo. Buy."
The grass is always greener on the side who most waters it.Keep up the good work Mr. Culp...
Reverse splits rarely work. Stock price usually drops down again.
Wow! 40 Million shares in less than 30 minutes of trading!
can someone tell me which news make this stock going uo........ noting chance from yesterday???????????????
"Like clockwork, GE bouncing off the 50 day moving average. I LOVE GE !!."
GE is going to close up.
JP Morgan started GE himself. Remember that when you decide you know more about this then the JPM analyst. YOU don't.
"GE dipping into red on a price point upgrade, classic!"
Adding to my position in GE.Also adding to my GPK position.
The selling of GECAS reduces debt by $30 Billion. A massive debt off the books. Yet everyone is fixated on the RevSplit.
Any news about the RS split?
Reverse splits don't do a thing to improve shareprice earnings do
"San Francisco issues one CCW license a year, Ohio is a menace to world security."
"Notice every time GE starts moving it stock price upwards through good decision making and Larry Culp, Tusa comes out with negative media coverage. I think JPMorgan and Culp should be investigated on this action. Tusa obviously has an alleged axe to grind with GE. Fortunately the investors are ignoring Tusa and his alleged axe to grind comments."
set to resume another day of stockholders selling into ZERO volume to set another bad day at the office.
Stock split will not mean anything. It is better for big investors. Some cannot buy cheaper stocks. You will have less stocks but the same money.
105 too expensive. 20-30 is the right price for GE.
16 this week! Why? 220 million bonus for Culp
Reverse stock split and the PPS is over $12? What a way to screw investors! Most only do this when a company is in trouble.
$45 billion in net debt in the next few years? Can you say buy?
"Some more good news this morning. General Electric Gains as Citigroup Resumes Coverage With 'Buy' RatingCitigroup analyst Andrew Kaplowitz sees a ""gradual but likely"" recovery in GE's struggling aviation business as the bank resumes coverage with a 'buy' rating on the stock.General Electric (GE) - Get Report shares moved higher Friday after analysts at Citigroup reinstated their coverage of the industrial group with a 'buy' rating, citing a gradual recovery in its aviation business.Citigroup analyst Andrew Kaplowitz pegged a $17 price target on GE, alongside the reinstated 'buy' rating, amid evidence of improvements across the whole of its business portfolio under CEO Larry' Culp's turnaround plans that could trigger ""material upside"" in GE shares. Kaplowitz also cited a ""gradual but likely"" recovery in GE's struggling aviation business, which posted an overall decline in first quarter profits of 36%, but should get a boost from the Federal Aviation Administration's approval of Boeing's (BA) - Get Report fix for an electrical issue that had grounded around 100 of its 737 MAX jets. Boeing engines are made by GE in partnership with France's Safran SA (SAFRY) .General Electric shares were marked 1.25% higher in pre-market trading Friday to indicate an opening bell price of $13.13 each, a move that would extend the stock's year-to-date gain to around 21.5%.Late last month, GE posted stronger-than-expected first quarter earnings of 3 cents per share, as revenues jumped 16.6% to $17.1 billion."
Oh you want to talk about analysts? Let's talk about all of the people that followed bullish analysts right off the GE cliff for 20 YEARS. Tusa? Inch? LOL. They are the only ones that have been right all along. No your 401k's aren't going to improve much at all.
Go to ATT and see what happens when a company is not playing hanky-panky with shareholders. GE takes and don't give back to shareholders. All hats and no cattle except for the CEO.
GE - the perfect Lucy stock. Just when you think GE is going to be not so inept & maybe score........ Mgmt pulls the football away.
"EVERYONE, the reverse split is a PROPOSAL. Just write to GE investor relationship and say NO.There will be NO VOTING, NO PROPOSAL, NO SCENARIO.It's wild fantasy. GE going to $30 without a RS. The will start buying stock and move to $50. AS EASY AS THAT."
"""The company said the timing of the reverse split will take place, at the board's discretion, before the one-year anniversary of its 2021 annual shareholder meeting scheduled for May 4."" Wow, that's a convoluted way of saying the reverse split will happen anytime between now and May 4, 2022. I've seen how a stock price can tank after a reverse split. Just get it over with, so we can buy afterwards. This impending negative catalyst is going to cause the stock price to stagnate!"
"I’m really surprised people are not jumping in on this now before tomorrow morning (before the bell) earnings report. Guaranteed to be a beat guys. Pops up a dollar tomorrow, well above 14$. Solid future guidance may cause this to leg up to 16$"
GE has had a string of  (Green) Fridays... will tomorrow be another one?... We find out tomorrow. 
"Don't think anybody can understand this reverse split,it just makes no sense to take out so many future share holders with $110.000 plus per share price ?GE was a blue collar stock, not sure what they are trying to do now by cutting so many blue collar workers out from buying it."
dnot sell let's pass the 13.17 lock.......Dnot sell and buy more if you can.
$15 $20 $30 by this Friday!!!
We could hit $14 by eod. Fed is not increasing rates
All GE purchasers now get Dividend if they hold till Ex-Dividend date... could explain some of the added interest in purchase/demand today. Especially Bad timing for shorts over next few days.
"is here anybody, who believes explanation ,why Rs is necessary?"
1:8 reverse split will shrink the number of GE shares outstanding to about 1.1 billion.
I'm still loading up on $GE because the focus is still on the technicals and once the support is finally built then we should see $GE finally start moving back up.

"IMHO, all the stockholders should vote down the reverse split. I am going to vote down for the reverse split.Larry Culp is doing right things but this reverse split is just bad idea and wasted effort at this time. It is bad optics from shareholders point of view. I understand over longer term, it would not make much of a difference as EPS and other metrics will not change but in general, reverse split is done by companies which are struggling. Let's hope voters vote it down and Larry and the board see shareholders point of view."
And I LOVE JPM as I do GE. But how would JPM & SHAREHOLDERS FEEL if someone did to JPM what damage they been doing to GE & SHAREHOLDERS for the longest ??Remember JPM IMMIDIATELY REMOVED REPLACE JPM Stock market Makers for failing to prevent JPM Stock crash along with HFT FLASH CRASH few years back.. GOIGLE IT..
"Reverse splits are not good. They make current stockholders pay for the sins of the past. Regular stock splits indicate momentum. Reverse splits are for businesses cleaning up problems which GE had plenty thus the reason for Culp, cash flow improvement, sale of assets, reduction/restructuring of debt, etc. I hope it works since I bought at $31 so I will need GE to hit $248 to get my money back. And I suffered the reduction of dividend to .01 per quarter. To say this reverse split will be good progress for current long-term shareholders in the red (probably most) is delusional. But the reverse split is a done deal. Culp would not let the item be on the docket for voting if it was not already pre-approved by the Institutional holders (the majority). I am fairly confident that I will write off my GE losses prior to full recovery from post-split stock appreciation, but such is the world of investment. For new shareholders GE has a lot going for it pre-split or post-split so I am not negative on GE just po'ed at the ghosts of GE past which have haunted me for 4+ years now. Good luck!"
"Did anybody conduct research on the investment green energy portfolio of last 10 years by NextEra Energy? If you did, you could get one step close to love GE. That is how I feel after I did the research. Look at NextEra's Wind Energy portfolio, it is about 24% of its total energy. NextEra Energy's wind turbines are 100% from GE. If you are still not sure GE is a clear winner in wind turbines, the installation base report by GE should win your heart.According to a wind turbine analysis report for 2020, GE jump from 4th rank to 1st: ""GE carved out the largest market share in 2020 in a record-breaking year for global wind capacity additions, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF).Developers commissioned 96.3GW of wind turbines globally in 2020, compared with 60.7GW the previous year, most of which (94%) were on land.The latest data from BNEF shows that GE emerged as the global number one spot in terms of capacity installed, with Goldwind in second place, Vestas in third and Envision in fourth place...."""
I see the conference call works as good as the stock price.
Still up 16% past 30 days and 120% past year. Stocks have their ups and downs pay more attention to fundamentals Not the daily close.
"Don’t forget July 4th. This Independence Day is being threatened with an growing oppressive federal government. We have a incredible constitution that ensures Civil Liberties. Not the government, nor anyone can force another into a healthcare choice they do not want. Your Body, Your Choice. People should question, even more so after the speech last night, the science behind this push to vaccinate every American. Employing “Vacinators.” Frightening prospect when he said, “I need you.” That’s the Army’s old marketing slogan. Be careful folks, your liberty is at stake."
Will be green at end of day imo
going on yesterday's run and common sense of basic indicators GE will be up at the end of the day....... maybe around $13.65;
"Who here listened to the meeting this week? It's over 2 hours long GE is not going anywhere but up! Long is the only way to play this! If Charlie Munger opinion is that Culp is the best thing to happen to GE, that's good enough for me"
Stock is dead CEO out to lunch with reverse split. Shares could easily gain $13 to double. Never will it ever gain 100 to do the same Never

"Initially I was disappointed with RS, after some thought I have decided it will be a positive moving forward. A reverse split with improving fundamentals translates to increasing demand for less supply. Tell my why I am wrong."
Today's drop got nothing to do with GE or RS or anything caused by GE. All the reopening stocks are down at least 4% or more. CAT is down. BA is down.... List goes on. Covid scares from the increase infection rate will likely not last too long.
Lets see if there is some rumble with 13 + options in the next 3 hours....
Come on BAGGIES admit it. GE revenue was a huge miss. 12s here we come.
"Culp: BUY BACK $20 BILLION Shares. You are sitting on $$110+ BILLION CASH & LIQUIDITY ($30bn cash abroad).. Culp, stop playing the shareholders to benefit your Banker buddies, we know you are their agent. Although, ai have to admit Culp is a very strong fundamental Admin, CEO. And Wllst Banks repositioning GE for GROWTH. But why did they have to sell GE BIOPHARMA, Crown-Jewel of Futuristic Medicine equipment tools maker.. And sold it for dirt cheap to his former boss.."
"hey guys, how I should vote to elect the board of directors and the rest of the voting optionos?Any good ideas, thank you."
"Majority of GE’s technical indicators have formed bullish signals:1. The closing price are above 21, 50, 200 day-moving average. These are short term, middle term and long term bullish signals.2. By connecting the low prices of last 6 months using a straight line, you can see GE is in upper trend. Last 6 month it tested low several times, such as two weeks ago tested $12, but it didn’t break down the upper trend line. This is a long term movement term indicate which is very bullish.3. Last three week price shape, since tested year high of $14.46, has formed a triangle upper trend shape. This is a very bullish sign. This a pre breakout signal.4. Accumulation and distribution signals indicates accumulation underneath.These bullish signals are detected by professional and serious investors. Thus, it would not surprise me GE will breakout some time next two weeks. Before it happens, the market dynamics will try to shake out some weak investors to push it lower. Remember, there are many option outstanding next week to be expired. The versatility will be big. Stay tuned!"

"Most board readers do not know the GE's past mistakes.One of the biggest was the Baker Hughes 2017 purchase.GE paid BH stockholders $17.50 a share which cost them up front $7.4 billion cash.The total deal was recorded as worth $32 billion - a total fabrication.GE merged its failing Oil and Gas Division selling about $$6 billion a year and losing $800k. The new Wrong. GE owned 66% - BH stockholders owned 34% The BHGE benefits went down severely and quickly. BHGE company was a wild bet that oil would go up to $60 a barrel and all would be good.The deal was severely criticized at that time by many. The BH stock was $33 on October 2016. GE stock was at $22.3. John Flaherty came in replacing Jeff Immelt. Immelt had been there for 15 years doing 2-3 deals mergers per year - many losers.Frankly no serious stockholder would have stuck it out. Things went south. Lots of problems in 2018 and 2019. Flaherty got fired in the fall of 2018. Culp was hired. In Q4 2019 GE reported a $2.2 billion loss on just the Baker Hughes deal. The declining 25 cents per quarter rich dividend went to 1 cent a share. GE sold in Q2 2019 more Baker stock. That sale added another $7 billion loss. So far a total loss of $9.2 billion on the BHGE deal. Another problem was the GE recorded wildly wrong goodwill on their statement. In 2018 they claimed $52 billion goodwill, 47% of which was the BHGE ownership. Wrong again. GE was desperate and faced collapse.The Baker deal was just the last of many failed deals. Culp has changed that and under-reported his successes. He is seriously reducing and removing all the bad parts of GE. The AERCAP deal was exceptional and sharply contrasted the failed GEBH 2017 deal. Culp should take the company back to its past successes if: 1) the ECONOMY rebounds (air travel mostly)2) the DOUBTERS JUST EVAPORATE (a lot of them playing on this board)3) TIME heals GE and all its worth returns.4) RENEWABLES contribute mightedly as it now seems to be unstoppable5) most optimistic things happen like renewing the GRID (GE has 1/3rd of the Grid using their equipment)6) Culp is LEFT ALONE to make sensible, strategic deals. (like the 8:1 reverse, no dividend, covering pension, closing GE Capital, reducing overhead a lot, and paying down debt)"
Money seems to be moving from Tech to commodities. Industrials may have to wait. Hopefully GE doesn't sell the industrial components before the market turns to industrials. I won't be surprised.
"Owned PINS for while. Went from $11 to $85 in less than a year primarily due to COVId. PINS last week went from mid 80s to lower 60s. First time I’ve seen a swing like that in the stock for the past year. Indicates that money is moving out of social media stocks due to the opening up of society post COVId. I think Now is the time for the GE run. My biggest concern in January was the COVId variant but that seems to be overblown and a nonfactor. The US is opening back up and that’s going to change. With that will come more travel and a boost to GEs aviation. GE has a lot of potential to be a very big winner this year. Proven CEO, Name recognition, still attractive stock price for the retail investor. Not many companies out there that are this large with an entry price below just above $10/share. Two things that will very much propel GE to the next level are increase in dividend and stock buy back regardless of amount. One if not both of those actions would solidify the confidence that GE is back."
"Obviously bears didn’t give up pushing down GE using all effort since they know 50 DMA is an important indicator for short and middle term trends. Many short term traders might sell if it breakdown 50 dma. For long term investors, it is a good time to buy if it breakdowns since long term is still strong from both technical and fundamental.They pushed GE down under 50 dma even Dow John Index up 200 points. It seems the market makers are with bears. There is only one single news on GE: Purchased a small biomarker company. The money spent on the acquisition shouldn’t be more than $100 million since the acquired company is only a tiny 24 people company. The news should be neutral to GE stock. I strong believe GE will bounce back quickly after it breakdown. Thus, prepare to buy some shares using the opportunity."
Wouldn't be surprised to se us bounce over $13 today.
"GECAS made 700 m USD losses in 2020, so receiving 30 bn USD and 49 percent of the the AERC Company: Good deal by all means. Hope that the 99.9 per Cent emotional reaction will stop soon. Looking to GEs cost base of 2020 and the business picking up, I recommend to have a look at GEs annual report of 2020 before being negative in Culp. He is knowing what he is doing. GLTA"
"J.P. Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa doesn't think eliminating GE Capital as a reporting entity fixes underlying issues. That's a big reason why he's a GE bear, because GE Capital is what he calls ""an ignored overhang on value."" He's still concerned with the debt at GE Capital, and problems such as long-term care insurance contracts, are significant. He believes investors are too focused on the industrial recovery and not focused enough on what's left in GE Capital after GECAS is gone."
Richard must be working the drive thru this afternoon.
A much smaller but potentially profitable company just can't have 8 billion shares outstanding in their books.

Reverse Split = Reverse SP it very easy. CEO know that
"GE will not purchase Safran to supplement it's Aviation portfolio. Safran is a French company which was not taken onto consideration in Tusa's delusional analysis. It's not what Tusa said, it's what he didn't say."
"When the effect of the stimulus money wears off, the market and this stock will be struck by a wave of selling."
"MMs selling call options every week, and preventing the stock price from moving up...Milking the Call Option buyers every week!"
"Amazing of these GE bears, this morning even all indexes are up, but they are continually selling GE stocks. They didn’t give up their bears attempt because they know GE will raise above $14 trade range forever if they didn’t try hard to cap GE under $13. Longs on GE needs to learn from their consistent efforts.There are so many overvalued stocks out there. I still didn’t understand why they (Tusa’s trading group) chose GE to be bearish and continue to push down GE."
Pass out the party poppers and confetti....GE will open up 5 cents.
This news just in: Chickens Coming Home To Roost is a dead road pizza.
"GE is not a momentum stock. Has never been. Without dividend payout, what is your reason for investing? Retirees who amassed GE shares for dividend were decimated. The thinly held hope that share price will reach $31 under Culp has been destroyed. The best you will ever see is $16.68 if ever."
"The significance of the reverse split is being blown out of proportion by retail investors. It has no impact on valuation only the size of the float. And it has no impact on stock options. The strike price on the options will be adjusted after the split. There is so much misinformation on this board the past couple days it's hard to read. When selling is exhausted, the stock will rebound based on fundamentals."
"Good afternoon BAGGIES and PUMPERS. The pig is squealing loudly today. DOW up over 125, this pig is sinking in the mud."
It's too late to undo the split announcement. Damage is done. Telegraphed profit troubles ahead and stock needs downside room.
"You will be held ""Culpable"" if you short this stock.Happy trails..."
Adding to my position.Buying more CRLBF too.
Buy the dip
Short sellers look like they own this stock. Am I reading the volume trend correctly?
"Almost all negative posts here should be prefaced with; ‘I wish, etc’, or ‘I want, etc.’ because they contain no factual data or empirical evidence to support their opinions, therefore they are simply wishful posters of b.s."

"When a sports team has a great head coach, it keeps winning for decades. It is the same for a great CEO with a company. Wall Street loves great CEO. Larry Culp is everything Wall Street is looking for. If next week or a few weeks from now, GE annouces it wins a big contract, then you will regret that you didn't look into the valuation instead of looking into RS."
Or wet their pants watching the pop up at the end today!
The only place to hide this morning is on the short side of stocks.
"Serious question: is what happened today referred to as a ""Bear Trap??"" Thanks in advance!!"
GE to $15 soon.....
"The question asked by many is: ""how in the world would a reverse stock split help a stockholder""? Simple. Having one ten dollar bill or ten one dollar bills is exactly the same thing - ten dollars... A reverse split lessens the shares available, but they become 8 times more valuable in price..When GE cuts the outstanding shares to 1/8th - there will only be 1.1 billion shares out now. It gets rid of a lot of dollar stock buyers who now have to spend $100 instead of $12.50 buying GE.That moves the kind of people who buy General Electric into a much higher class of investor who have serious money with serious commitments. There will be a lot less day trading and far lower volume daily. That is terrific because 5-6% stock price moves are a real ouch. Today the stock moved almost 3% and nothing was actually happening. We really need to wait 2 weeks for Q1 earnings.People spending $100 a share on GE have more money to spend. It eliminates the one or two or three shares buyer at $12.50 a share.I voted for the RS gladly. All the bigger investors will definitely support the reverse split - so nothing on this board can really change the obvious outlook.In a year look back and if GE was headed to $20 - it will be $160 instead. It does not change the direction of the stock - just the amount of shares out.Reverse splits DO NOT CHANGE THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUE of the company.Performance does - not stock price.It is simply a cleaning up of the stock.I believe it actually will move the GE stock price up - just like Apple at $20 (now $126) has done or Costco at $40 (now $350) has done over the years."
"The market correction is here. Today GE traded with high volume. It first went up because of the upgrade and quickly dropped to $13.2x in the early of the morning because of the market correction. Then, it recovered after bulls and bears fight. It is not bad that GE close at $13.57 at the close even the indexes dropped badly.Technically, the market indexes are in very bad shape. GE might drift down as the market indexes go lower in near future. Hopefully, GE can stay above $13. If bears push it under $12.5, I will thank the bears to give me another opportunity to add my position. Keep in mind that GE will be the best stock to own next few years."
"Major announcement tomorrow for GE, and the NASDAQ will be higher on our last business day, so GE should hit 14.00+++ Buy SooooooooN even after hours...!!!"
"I've counted 3 massive pumps by institutional buyers to keep GE above $13.00 today, they're setting the trap, expect one more pump, then the massive sell towards the close."
GE is power
What are the chances GE reinstates some kind of dividend at some point?
JPM/Tusa says $5UBS/Markus says $17Does it mean that GE will trade in the range $5 - $17 (or $40 - $136 post split). Sounds good to me.
Guillermo bought more discounted shares. They are 30% off!!!Guillermo left a message AGAINST the RS at 617 443 3400. It took him 35 seconds.Stay greedy my friends
Basic math education for some folks here. A Twenty Dollar Bill have the same monetary value as Twenty Single Dollar Bills.
I can see GE will use half of the $30B to buy back 2B shares of their stock. Trimming down 20% of outstanding shares to match the new GE.
"This isn't that hard. Just don't get caught long GE stock. Simple rule, easy to follow. Hit the sell button first. Then the buy button later. There you have it. What is so hard about that?"
"What amazes me about GE is what I DO NOT know - not what I do know.Every week I read something new I never knew before.I think it actually was too large to control in the past.So it will take new management to market and profit from the following:like CREATING A NEW hand held hospital scanners by GE that will change the medical field.Or now just now a brand new offering of a new power generator which is much less environmentally sensitive than in the past.Or just having created and certified the 9X new jet airplane engine that is 10% more environmentally friendly. Or that GE has its hands in 50% of all the power on this planet!O that the Martin Marietta F35 state of the art military airplane relies on the GE advanced engines for huge design advances.Or that we have GE generator power plants in submarines and helicopters.Or that only Seimens and GE are the only serious competitors considered by the bigger hospitals when buying an MRI scanner.Or that I learned GE made made a zillion ventilators during the pandemic.Or that GE sells to every airline on this planet and is located in over 130 countries.GE is probably also is in touch with the same 130 countries on their power and electricity uses.These same 130 countries are buying wind and will be going to GE when it comes to offshore wine turbines.And even more astonishing to me is the 80 countries GE has manufacturing plants located in and it has offices here too. In many ways GE reminds me of the US Government. It is there a lot of places and it is more free from local politics. hey cannot afford to be taking sides on anything except to get the sales. But those countries also cannot afford to ignore GE. This is not a Nike Shoe or an AMC Movie Chain or a Disney - all companies that are in your life but none offering environment and health solutions.So when I hear a Stephen Tusa, or a John Inch, or a Chuck Watkins passing off as analysts - I am in awe of their complete stupidity. They bash GE. They say the stock is way too much. They are waiting for a ""hail Mary"" pass.GE is the 17th largest US Industrial company. The top 8 are all car companies. Three are electronics firms like Apple. The remaining 6 are Industrial companies and GE is the largest of these. GE is not broke. It has $45 BILLION in cash.. It could raise bushels of money if it wanted. And sure it has debt.. Sure in the past It has used its assets foolishly. Sure It has used factoring as a financial crutch.Sure it supported a GE Capital division that still has usefulness - but it is unwinding.General Electric is cutting overhead. It has shed 150,000 employees. They are closing redundant plants.And what does big mean. A $20 billion company is considered huge. The stock market has thousands of these companies for buying stock in. GE is 5 times larger. Any company with just RENEWABLES ($20 billion) or MEDICAL ($20 billion) or AVIATION ($32 billion and it will be back to $400 billion), or POWER ($20 billion) would by itself be vastly important. GE So I do not think it is a risky buy. We all know where it is going....I think it is a place to park your money as a patient investor in an incredibly well positioned company.You will be richly rewarded...."
"GE STOCK does not do well when the market is up and in GREEN ...why not ???? with all the noise surrounding the company, it should be flying today....it's barely managing to stay positive...zack rating has changed to #4 meaning sell...negative sentiment pushing it down perhaps......shorts best know that GE will caught them off guard one of these days....."
"In stead of bashers who want instant money you have to be a veteran investor to realize that borrowing for short periods gets you nowhere. This is a great comeback American stock so take it or leave it. No money to buy who cares, go haunt another post. GE is a long term buy 20.00+++ in the Fall so buy in and shut up."
"DONT believe these shorts saying you will lose shares. They are trying to SCARE you into believing that for every 8 shares you have, you will only get one ""at the same stock price"". They are trying to scare you into selling. The FACT is that you get 1 share for every 8 shares you have, but the stock price will be 8 times higher. These shorts cannot win because the short ""interest"" is VERY VERY low, they cannot affect the stock price. They are weak."
"Hey BAGGIES, once again the shorts are right, and you are left holding the bag. 12s are coming whether you like it or not."
"many reactions by financial teams trying to come up with responses to culps latest conference call.using earnings producing assets to pay off debt results in what?even speculations what culp may sell next.my reaction, again waiting for april, when culp will offer clarification"
"Congratulations to all GE Longs...GE held up well today. IMHO it is building a strong new base to launch from. So well in fact that even with todays closing price, The Shorts from last Friday at $12.95 are still in the Red! ... They couldn't even get to even on a market down day like today! And for that reason- Baggies= GE Shorts "
What happened to the $17 raises baggies?
"why would Culp want to do areverse split at the beginning of a turnaround? Makes no sense, most young investors will not jump into this as it wont appear cheap. and 8-1?? Culp... what are you thinking?"
"Boeing 737 Max flights, March 4, 2021. - Alaska's Max 9 entered service this week.- 11 United Max 9s entered service today (21 total)- Southwest restarts Max service on March 11$BA $GE $SPY"
"It’s like this, the split needed to happen Culp or no Culp, he just took a larger chunk then they should. 4 maybe 5 not 8 times. Remember this the larger the number the longer for GE to recover. He also wants to restore a higher dividend to keep the wealthiest stockholders happy, including himself.Like always more shares more money on the dividend side.So buy more after smoke clears."
"My guess is corporate bonuses were just handed out and they want 20 percent more shares for their buck. Ive been a trader since the 90's and have never seen a stock reverse for no reason at all. I'm not buying the we want to look like the others gig. Only other option I can think of is they want to look handsome with an 8 cent dividend, post reverse. Which in essence is no increase to the dividend whatsoever. Anyone else have 2 cents to put in er uh 1 cent."
$SUNW $HYSR $DNN $FCEL $GE >>> 2024.
Well this dip was/is a gift!
"This stock, pricing now, should be at $25.00 in 8 months or less."
"No dividends, RS, still working on debt exposure, world economy stalled. Wind turbines will be in fashion. Democrats will prob'ly spend lots of money on them. Air travel will pick up. Long term care coverage will be expensive. It will be more than a year before GE even thinks about tossing another penny or two into the dividend and ROI is going to relatively flat compared to the market."
The Culp-Climb continues .. GE to $16 before end of June.
"EVERYDAY JPM taking off $0.01--$0.02 off closing settling price. I noticed this EVERYDAY.. Yesterday, day before, day before that and so on... Pay attention.. This another sign of SEVERE MANIPULATION on GE Price"
"04:02 AM EST, 03/08/2021 (MT Newswires) -- General Electric (GE) is reportedly close to entering a deal to merge its aircraft-leasing business with Ireland's AerCap (AER) and create a new company valued at more than $30 billion, The Wall Street Journal said Sunday, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter.GE Capital Aviation Services has more than 1,600 aircraft owned or on order and had $35.86 billion in assets as of Dec. 31.If I read that right, GE leasing has nearly $36B in assets and the merged company will have a $30B value? Is this another great GE deal? lol"
closing green
"GE stock becoming boring some No matter how much good news comes out from the company and how hot green the market gets, GE doesn’t make any moves bigger than 25 cents which itself fades away by the closing time. Past 3 months been nothing but boring. It needs to bust to move"
I buy at 9 2000 and I buy more and more I sell it by 14 14.....and buy back at 12.45 a lot now I have 13000 for 13.1 
"You will all be unhappy when you did not buy GE at the current price. Complain all you want, But GE will be a 20.00+++ stock. Buy Buy Buy GE...!!!"
"THE BOARD SHOULD BE FIREDThis is truly one of the Worst Ideas that I have ever seen a major corporation make. If you are going to thin the ranks of hard working GE employees ...Then Fire the Board. These ""Brilliant Minded"" individuals concocted and promoted this idea. The stock will eventually Tank at least 30% form recent highs."
"$GE to $100+, most SEVERELY UNDERVALUED, CASH $$130 Bn & Liqdt..GEAS Rev $5 Billion, Sold for $$30 BILLION CASH and 46% Ownership of the new joint entity.. EXCELENT SUPER FINANCIALLY BENEFICIAL TRANSACTION..BioPharma Rev $4 Billion, Sold for $$22 BILLION CASH.. Should hv been $$80 BILLION price. Biopharmas trading 300% times what GE sold Bio for, is the future of med..BKR Ownership sold for $12 per share, sold at the LOWEST price. Should hv held it for $30--$40. BKR Balance Sheet is STRONGEST of all in oil and oil-service technology, even tech stocks. Please look at BKR Balance Sheet..Either way, I think Wallatreet has huge big plans for GE FUTURE DIRECTION, therefore the changes and repositioning of GE, to move it in the direction of GROWTH acquisitions, that would explain why GE keeps piling on mountain of $$$CASH $$130 BILLION and LIQUIDITY ($45bn in USA+ $30bn abroad China Asia EU etc,+ $30 bn sale of GEAS finance, + $25bn Line of credit). Could GE be set up like $DHR Danaher run/gain of 1,200% ??"
"what I just ""heard"" from that CNBC interview is this reverse split will happen."
I give up and selling this tomorrow and buy msft and goog instead. Dunno why I waited so long. Bought ge at 13 years ago.
"That didn't work either, Senior Clown jj. You need some new material."
"Clown Zero, why change your name so often?"
"The stock will split any day after May 4, 2022. Which is a year from now. They may do it after 3rd quarter results of next year. The tree will be shaken. The support is holding strong, the r/s result was priced in. Be ready for that breakout coming soon. Buy the dip, $GE to the 20's this year!"
Need to somehow push through the 13.60s
"Sell covered call options on Fridays/,Mondays to skim whatever $$ you can get from the Manipulators. They are playing yoyo with GE, destroying shareholders faith in the management . It is a rigged game. Culp is complicit in this scam."
"I can't wait for the RS to happen. I love it !. then instead of 80 million shares traded daily, there will be 8 million shares traded. And FYI the short interest is so LOW that they don't even make a difference."
"General Electric's GE Healthcare Subsidiary Buys Zionexa For Undisclosed Sum. Is this a good news or bad news? Consolidation didn’t finish yet, expansion is started. The money saved in consolidation can easily be spent in acquisitions. Two small acquisitions so far since Culp joined the company. Hopefully, the two acquisitions didn’t cost more than $100 million.Zionexa has only 24 employees and the company makes biomarker agent to detect bread cancer. GE develop detection equipment. Customers can buy detection equipment and detection agents separately. Looks like GE is getting into non core business again."
GE is a safe haven stock.
"OH Boy look at her run.... JEEEEEZ no, not JEEZ, GE! Sorry for all those who sold... but you do know you followed the wrong advice.... GE is a BUY BUY BUY!"
"For those who are Dyscalculia. Just a reminder, the percentage of $0.01 of $15 & $0.08 of $120 are the same."

"Baker Hughes sales for cash$$$$ a very big deal, what was done in the past is behind GE/CULP, now selling is getting them cash for new ideas and debt pay down, GE is about ready to jump with air travel, stock reaches $25 very soon"
15 soon.
The management in mahogany row are considering an 8-1 reverse split to reduce outstanding shares. Well I just dumped my full position at a nice profit...so now now you are at least down 1200 shares.
20 by the end of the year. Look at TSA Data
"ge still needs to address some of the open questions to move forward,"
"On 3-17-21, I have to laugh #$%$ Tusa ""maintained"" a price target of $5.....i think at this point, it is spite vs. any substance. All of the indicators for GE point to an ever growing business, especially as our planet slowly recovers from COVID-19. Hey, as they say, even a clock is right twice a day meaning....""a person who is considered to be unreliable can still be right about something every once in a while, even if it is by accident"".Keep at it Tusa....at some point (soon), people will shake their head and move on, and start to believe someone reliable - lol."
"As simple as it can be - if you have $230 million of your own money on the line, will you not give a most bright outcome?"
just like we thought.... up $13.23. soon green
"if they split into 3 companies, at $15, if roughly equal value, remaining company would be under $5 possibly forcing institutional sales.... only reason for reverse....added here."
Wall Street applauds Culp decision to split the stock
"General Electric is selling off its aircraft leasing business, closing the books on its once mighty GE Capital unit, the financial arm of the company that had been its largest business and one of the world's most dominant financial institutions.GE is selling the aircraft leasing business known as GECAS to rival AerCap (AER), an Ireland-based company that will become by far the largest company in that industry with an estimated 25% to 30% share of the market. GE will receive $24 billion in cash and stock that will give it about a 46% stake in the combined company.The company plans to use proceeds to reduce its debt load by about $30 billion, part of a multi-year effort to slash $70 billion of debt from its balance sheet. It is the latest and among the most dramatic steps GE is taking to reshape and slim down the now struggling company.GECAS, which buys aircraft and leases them to airlines and other operators, had been providing most of the revenue for the GE Capital unit. But sales fell about 20% last year as the Covid-19 pandemic caused a plunge in air travel and massive losses across the airline industry. GECAS' cash-starved airline customers paid only about 84% of the unit's invoices in 2020. It resulted in a $786 million loss for 2020 after a $1 billion profit in 2019."
"Anyone know if GE has business in any power infrastructure? Power lines, electricity generation, ect?"
Another day in RED. Shorts pushing it all the way.
Are we Zero yet? Didn't think so....Sorry Baggies ....BTW: Baggies= GE Shorts!
When is the CFO speaking today? And is there a way to access it?
What a beautiful chart today...straight up since 12:30pm... anyone know what accumulation looks like?...Look at today's chart!
I added more shares when price dropped. company value has not change in my view. In a month time GE will be back to where it was.
"FORWARD statement BY CULP pushes stock over $15, then a march upward into the $24 area as CULP starts to use the $80 billion cash. GE stock to pick up mutual fund buying today. remember the year of the CULP"
The true value of GE is yet to be see... GE Stock is undervalued at current PPS Below Fair Value: GE ($13.55) is trading below our estimate of fair value ($17.07)Significantly Below Fair Value: GE is trading below fair value by more than 20%. Can;t wait for Super Tuesday!! Cheers to Longs
"Darn, GE is coming back now....I wanted to buy it at much lower prices at the open. Well we will see.....if it's down more than 25 cents at the open I am a buyer."
IF GE was such a GOOD Company they would never do a REVERSE SPLIT...FACT: GOOD well run companies NEVER do REVERSE SPLITS...i.e...AAPL..MSFT..SHOP..CAT.
Baker Hughes will return to $80 as soon as GE sells remaining stake.
"barry , I Agree , On Our Way To $15.00 , To $16.00 , A Share Very Soon , G E , Is Worth A Lot More And People Are Slowly Waking Up , And Their Waking Up , That , Ford , Is Worth More , Their Stock Should Be $18.00 To $20.00 , And AT&T , Stock Should Be Worth More Than $35.00 To $38.00 ,, Paying A Safe Great 7% Dividend's , GLTA ,"
Nice little bear trap! lol
"RS is nothing but noise designed to shake of weakies and remain with long term shareholders, that is why W Buffet never split and retains life long shareholders at over $300,000/sharealso has nothing to with ""RS always end up in bankruptcy, see HOV in the last 5 years with a RS of 1:25"
"GEs proposed 1 for 8 stock split stinks. 1 for 3 should be more like it. They should also use the 30 billion in the GECAS deal to buy back shares, while they are still cheap. This in turn helps shareholders and the company. A 1 for 8 reverse split will hurt shareholders. Time for GE to do the right things for shareholders who own a piece of this business."
"Congrats to those who bought at the open and held....I took my 5 cents and ran, didn't see it coming."
logical just tell the truth...do In fact baggies = shorts or not?
"Looks like a good tech day. Saw Cathie Woods cheerleading on Bloomberg yesterday. My 200 shares of Roku at $42 are looking good but I love my 1,000 shares of GE at $6.25 just as much!!"
like I have always said in my posts; the 35 stories on all the renewable energy deals omit any financial implications to the company or bottom line. the renewable energy stories are window dressings or total BS!! Companies love to brag about great giant deals apparently not the case with renewable energy because as we have just learned revenue was down in this sector again which indicates to me a bunch of hot air. by the way the CEO needs to beef up in the area of public speaking a real nerd with zero personality or one would say your typical bean counter.
"Did you ever notice how Larry Culp is buying things that will actually make money, were Jeff Immelt bought things that lost massive amounts of money. And most important Larry is telling the truth, while Jeff Immelt told some massive lies. Two very different CEO'S"
Nobody understands this move . Something is very fishy . No way does GE plummet what 15 % last two days without this announcment.
"NBC Universal, CNBC ST0LEN from GE for $16Bn..

"If you are holding 80000 shares today, soon it becomes 10000 shares. Sound good. But if you are holding 100 shares, you will soon own only 12 shares. This is why retail investors are selling."
"Wake up people, before the the possible reverse split next year this stock is projected to trading around $30 per share after the reverse split it will be $200 to $240 and in 2023 close to $340 to $400 per share. Invest in $GE to help build your wealth the value is right in front of you the CEO Larry Culp is trying to show you!"
"I am amazed at how many ""key board c.e.o's"" there are on this board telling Culp and the board of directors how to run General Electric, when in fact they would not know how to run even a newspaper stand. I am of the opinion that Culp should run this company the way he see fit, and I am sure he means the best for the share holders. A R/S in this case is not an indication of serious financial difficulties."
As always the 15 cents gain at the open turn RED when day is over. Typical trading day for GE specially when you step on CEO tail to cause anger and pain
Chugging along like a diesel engine...
Voted against reverse stock split and in favor of independent board members
Bashers here be like
uhhh..excuse me Rick the bear....just checked in and we are over 13.......just sayin..short baggie...hahah
$GE - Co lands ‘largest combined onshore wind project’ in its history. Should move to $15 plus
Besides selling parts of the company what has Mr. Culp done? Maybe we should have kept Flanigan and avoided the generous comp package.

what about the reverse stock split?? Did it pass?
Just remember we are getting back to normal 
Selling for roughly 1x sales with FCF of prob $4 to $5B!! So undervalued!!! Once the consolidation period is done we will start our climb again...company need to abandon RS idea!! Email investor relations!
what a great stock
When is the reverse split?
Culp has been on board for 2 yrs now?How has GE stocks performed since he took over as the CEO (during the past 2 yrs that is) ?
GE big red inverted hammer today.
"Things are turning around for the better. Just Google “COVID Update UK”, then USA, France, Spain, Italy...even Brazil. Cases are coming down. Cases. Not even talking about deaths and hospitalization. The elderly are no longer the majority going to hospitals anymore. So, cases coming down, with J&J being lifted today, AeroMexico ordering 28 Boeing 737 planes, and earnings on the Tues 27th, those that haven’t jumped on GE yet have until Mon 26th to decide...after that you’ll look back in a few weeks and wish you did when you read this..."
Sold shares this morning will be scooped up in short order. Buy.
"Don't feel so bad GE longs, Wall street has been built on other peoples money. They gotta pay for those lavish offices and thousand dollar lunches somehow."
I think what we're seeing is Accumulation... it's rising into the close again! 
Great Day to All GE Investors!!! PS- Baggies= Shorts 
I had to go on reddit to mobilize the troops. $GE $20's this year!

Tomorrow we will see $16. I am very confident on this.
"Culp (from now on known as Braindead) is now thinking to R/S the stock to sabotage it even further, for the sole reason it doesn't look like the other 100+ PPS stocks in the sectors associated with. What Braindead doesn't realize is that after the R/S it will look similar to what it does now. Maybe it will have support around 50 who knows. However the enormous salary he claimed he would forfeit, lied, and then didn't would have raised guidance by a cent or 2. As a top shareholder old Braindead would realize getting his stock to double would give him and us a lot more money. Maybe Braindead should consider THAT before sinking this thing to a Pre stock split price of 6.50, just so it looks pretty. He cant seem to raise its PPS any other way."
It won't be long GE stock price will go up in a couple of years to revisit its glory days' stock price . I am loading up at today's bargain price
amazed sweet
Chart I'm looking at shows steady climbing right to the close today...Looks beautiful... Green  ...on a FRIDAY too!!!
I am all in if you slash debt by growing revenue rather than by selling assets.
"GE still reaching at close. Thanks Mr. Culp , we want you. "
"Paid $27,000 for my hot rod, Legacy 2.5 GT. The timing belt replacement was a noose. RSM, works his own car, runs tops.I like Hampshire."
"Hey BAGGIES, it's going to hit this number today. Nice short for me, but you will keep on holding back to single digits. GE post reverse split will be a 60 to 70 dollar stock. This equates to a current value of $4.80 to $5.60 per share. Right in line with Tusas numbers."
12 months target 14 / 15 maybe 16 is reasonable. what you are reading here. over the edge.trading ge is an option to raise your returnsdreaming wont work long-term. culp has more work ahead to push ge much higher
GE 8 for 1 reverse split
"Down 2.5% in pre market,..yup GE Board of Directors have their answer to the Reverse stock split,....much better to grow your way into market capitalization then try to manipulate the statistic's of the fundamentals.Yes I know the value does'nt change I know this however perception does."
"@gene, Pardon my confusion, Is the RS going to happen after the pps hits $25.12 or $31.34? When is the RS supposed to take place in relation to Culps price goals? Thanks."
"I want to share my overall thoughts on a GE investment:1. Stocksplit: Will only be beneficary for long term holders. There wont be no surprise or dip bc of the RS- its priced in whatsoever.2. Business modell: Massive tailwinds in my opinion for GE Renewable Energy (Green Deal) and GE Healthcare (Covid19 crisis clearly showed what advantage a domestic production can have). GE Power will have a lot of backlog at GE power conversion and energy consulting as EV infrastructre will pick up. Its even imaginable for me that GE nuclear energy could play an important role for countries that cant afford ""real"" clean energy, especially India and alikes (Michael Burry already wrote about that matter). GE Aviation will pick up as soon as we get out of this COVID crisis. 3. Very talented CEO, with an excellent track of record (look at Danaher)4. Last insider bought a while ago not too far from todays price (12,50 USD) Whats the key take away then ?It will take years and years until this investment will pay off. Larry Culp Jr. needed more than one decade to get Danaher to the point where it is now. So what makes you guys think this invest will work over night ? Give me a break."
Reverse split slammed the brakes on SP then threw it in reverse
Go watch the Harry Makapolis' (forensic accountant) videos and read his research on GE....He claims GE is like Enron and Worldcom combined!
Good luck longs

"So farmer has concerns on waiting two years and tying up his money.This becomes a risk vs reward issue.I am willing to wait for my idea of a ""sure thing"" with really unlimited upside For a person buying stocks just to make quick returns (and quick losses possibly) then buy Tesla or Apple stock where you can see the volume, buy or sell, and in and out quickly.Tesla has moved 25% in a few months and Apple has bounced between $134 and $108 which is a 26 point move.I am investing and reward over two years or even more over four years appeals to me.I can sleep at night and not go bezerk if GE stock dives over some daily news.That is because I see so much unlimited upside in Renewables and the 10 year push for environment that I feel safe.It is just a matter of risk vs reward."
"Ford use to own a lot of assets like GE, including Volvo, Jaguar, Mazda, Aston Martin, etc. Stock price jumped to $30 when the CEO was out shopping. Then, just like GE, they began to sell assists and share priced dropped to $1. Do you see why they are both trading at $12?"
"jjthat last post was inteded to be an answer to you.you have never given me one fact about ge. all you do is hourly trash opinions adding nothing to anyone' factual knowledge of ge.for example, can you tell me which countries ge has manufacturing in.. what they make where? if so, I could learn more from you. this not a game board. reddit and other places a better for bantering.I am self made. I have no 401k. I have not worked for anyone since many years ago when I worked for pfizer in my 20's. I have been on my own ever since."
Happy Easter everyone!
"Reverse split not necessary as GE's stock was recovering organically and the consequent rise in stock price keeps many small investors from getting into the shares. Buying shares at 14 is much better than trying to buy shares at 112 (assuming yesterdays close). Once the reverse has occurred, the shorts will have plenty fuel to short term attack GE and drive the price down for at least a while. I don't understand, this makes no sense and is very un Culp characteristic as it will (for a little while) simply cause un-do pressure on the share price by giving the shorts more fodder. I'm still long GE, but I may (for at least a while) regret it. Longs expect pressure on the stock for a while; bummer!!!"
"I said more good news and more upgrades .. Morgan today, other financial institutions today .. i upgraded GE and forecasted cashflow improvement, raised my target and pushed against JPM .. I don’t work for Wallstreet but I have this board and few longs who I share my opinions and we are winning .. I am holding to GE until Jan 2023 before I say my goodbyes to all .. I have double and tripled my investment in GE buying calls .. I am holding huge Leap positions and I will win .. GE is still cheap .. buy and hold you will be rewarded .. my favorite is still GE 15 expiry Jan 15 2022 and 17&20 expiry Jan 2023 .. Sit back relax and enjoy the ride.. The GE ride !"
"I VOTED AGAINST, OPPOSIT OF WHAT Mgmt RECOMMENDED... I always do that with every company. Only with S.Jobs, E.Musk, L.Elisson I will trust they are strong and loyal to their Company, they created them, do not get Interest of outsiders, above their own companies. I can not say the same for Culp, even though he is one of the best administrators. In GE case, he is intentionally undermining GE EARNINGS, share price... Sorry"
I guess 52 week high was enough to divert CEOs attention to things that really matter like raiding the treasury. They along with all shareholders will regret for rest of time the decision stuff reverse split down shareholders throats
Ge has reduced the dividend payout by 800% due to reverse split . For big players it is a big deal .
GE= 15$ by the end of this week
BOOM SHAKA LAKA! 
"What he should have said, (opps gave away gender, of the 7 total now accepted), “GE has an internal security problem, yes it has been known to be a dangerous place to work, and let’s talk about resolving the security problem”."
Thank GOD they are building Millions of Brand new gasoline powered Jet engines and new Diesel Tractor Trailers and gasoline powered cars and trucks all over the world Today and they will be with us along time.
Can we assume shareholders voted in favor of the stock split?
"No legal binding on the shareholder’s rejected Culp’s 2020 bonus pay plan. Since 2020 plan has been legally signed, Culp will get his 9.3 million free shares. When GE reaches $16.68, he will get 14 million free shares! No meaning on this. Shareholders should just accept and move on."
"I believe if anything can go wrong; it will. Ge uses a lot of semiconductors in tracking equipment, sensors yet no one seems to think this could become an issue for GE?"
"If you compare GE with its competitors on the basis of cashflow per share in 2021.GE has a 12 ratio while Siemens and Honeywell are going with 30-40 ratios!Yes GE has more debt (which is enormously shrinking), but if competitors get 30 ratio, let's penalize GE by a 30-40% factor due to debt and give it a 20 ratio, FAIR! That translates to a $20 a share for GE. Not 12 not 13, not 14, $20 TODAY.If that is the case, clearly if the BOD really wants a reverse split, it could be 1/5 or even 1/4. Once that is clarified and communicated to investors, I expect the price per share to skyrocket.If this is the master plan then OK, Guillermo will start applauding right now. Bravo!Stay greedy my friends!"
Who knows where SP would be today had CEO not dropped reverse split bomb
Look at call 15 someone knows something
"Another 'General' CEO announced earnings today. Mary Barra, CEO of GM, said EPS more than doubled estimates. Ms. Barra's total compensation in 2020 was $23.7 million."
"VESTAS Wind Renewable $$250 BILLION Mkt Value, Revnue $14Bn. But GE Wind-Renw $$20 BILLION around, shouldn't it ALONE Add $$40 per share using Vestas multiples, GE Wind Renewable alone should be $$300+ BILLION Mkt value...."
"Stock holder revolt needed ! Just when things were looking up. Culp pulls a fast one. Not sure what his game is , but it is not for shareholders."
@C i have provided facts all day. You just don't want to listen. Get out from underneath Larry's desk and see the light. 1 out of every 1000RS's moves higher after the split. This was pout out to take everyone's attention to their dismal number projections going forward. Look at the projections and argue that. Go scam someone else. I have traded GE for nearly 4 years now. Where did you come from?
Green close... all the wussies sold.... buying from here on out... 14 this week... 15 in May.... who needs GameStonk?...
"analysts rarely agree, still the investors decision what to believe,or more likely what the investor wants to believe.my analyst has been and continues to be culp"
"What price will GE trade next week? If the market indexes don’t have a correction, GE will close above $13.5 to $14 next Friday. when GE tests $14 few times and breakout $14, GE will become very bullish. The traders will jump in to play. When that happens, the real game will start; the stock price will move higher very fast due to momentum. $16*8 is reachable by this summer and $20*8 by the year end. Why? Because the pandemic will go away and the aviation will come back. Thus, GE is the stock which will enjoy the recovery. Time will tell."
Where's the Zacks article about GE beating the market 27X today? They printed nothing... but when GE is down they have diarrhea of the mouth! Zacks is a BS news letter of zero substance. You will actually lose intelligence by reading into a Zacks article. News flash... Zacks is not worth the stuff that you wipe into toilet paper! Zacks = lost brain matter.
It wants to climb higher OMG. I am just smiling seeing this happen. $15 soon
today it was announced that Netjet is building 300 AS2 supersonic jets in the next decadeGE has just completed the designs for the engines that will be used to power this aircraft.Netjets is a Brerkshire Hathaway company.
"NetJets, has obtained purchase rights for 20 of its AS2 business jets.The AS2 will be powered by engineered synthetic fuel and can reach supersonic speeds of up to Mach 1.4, or about 1,000 miles (1,610 km) per hour, which is 150% faster than conventional business jets, Aerion said.Production of the jets will begin in 2023 at the firm's Aerion Park facility in Melbourne, Florida, with the first 300 AS2 aircraft planned for the first decade of production, the company said.Aerion's global order backlog for the AS2 is now valued at more than $10 billion.The company said it will also develop a supersonic flight training academy for civil, commercial and military supersonic aircraft in collaboration with Berkshire's professional aviation training provider, FlightSafety International.U.S. startups Aerion, Boom Supersonic and Spike Aerospace are working to reintroduce supersonic passenger travel for the first time since the Anglo-French Concorde retired in 2003.General Electric Co's GE Aviation unit has said it completed initial designs for the new Affinity turbofan engine, which will be used in Aerion's AS2 jet."
"Check the GE chart from April 1st, 2010 - January 1st, 2011. You’ll see GE went on a big $6.00 -$7.00 run. Not saying you should make decisions based on past charts, but the pattern looks very similar to what we have here. Also, the financial crisis almost bankrupted GE. Does that story sound familiar?"
"jj doesn't realize that if GE does a reverse split, he will have to buy 8x Monopoly board games to keep track of his fake trades."
Reverse Split slammed the brake on SP look @ 6 month chart. It hit 52 week high the day it was announced and then it died
"Start Joining the Group We will vote ""NO"""
"Instead of getting the aborshun like I wanted, my girlfriend invested the $600 into GE stock...I'm so mad right now!"
"This is still a beat - pandemic overshadows and grossly impacts the yoy - and yet in this environment - its a beat. Well done GE! Now, reverse split it and lets move forward."
"As expected, ranging trading $12 to $13 until reverse split. Then who knows. RS stocks usually drop because of loss of confidence and despondency, and range trade again. Citi is still ranging trading $4 to $7 since 12 years ago."
$14.00 plus today watch no worries
Looks like GE stock dead until next year or 2023. Too much damage was done by immelt.
Is GE not at this market cap a target for acquisition?
"GE will be selling and getting paid for a lot of engines, and engine hours. The next report will show...The institutional investors are simply trying to shake shares and fees from loose hands. GE will show higher percentage performance than BA over the next two years. Plus they makes the F-15EX engines...And have been talking to Airbus, there’s a paradigm shift... it’s been 14-years since they put engines (or talked with) on an Airbus. I heard."
What do they achieve from doing a reverse split? The share price was already going up to 20 plus
Maybe tusa and BOD are on the same page
"In a reverse stock split, companies trade a fixed number of existing shares for a smaller number of new shares—keeping the value of each investor’s holdings the same. The result doesn’t affect the value of the company, just the number of shares outstanding and the price of each one.Think of it as exchanging 10 dollar bills for one $10 bill. The total value of your investment is unchanged, but you have fewer bills in your pocketSTILL, I WILL VOTE ""NO"""
Wouldn't be surprised if Buffett starts adding. GE is right smack at an inflection point. He could see it as a better way to play aviation. Buy.
Loading up on these dips. No worries here. I can hold as long as I need too.
Buyout by $GE very possible at $5billion
Most alt energy stocks rose today too.
"The Board of Directors has their answer to the reverse Split proposal. This was Culp's first major blunder, by reverse splitting it's shares 8/1 they increase the price 8 fold sounds right so far ? Well, these financial engineers with their computerized algorithm trading can now drive the price down from a 112 were it will be to 60 then once people get washed out ,the tree shaken they can drive it back up. Since these Wall street firms have access to who owns shares and how much,they can by passed so called owned in street name and have access to direct ownership of shares. Point is they will be free to Manipulate the share with less effort. And who really suffers in the end the mom and pop retail investor who invests in GE in believe the company is a good investment, not a trading vehicle. Vote No to the RS of shares. The BOD should have left the share structure alone, and grow the company into it over time, NOT give opportunity to the institutional investors who only want to manipulate the trade."
It was nice to see how much resistance GE had to the market sell-off. I see it as a good sign that this will snap back hard.
What's funnier than jj day trading off of monthly charts? LOL
"What is the plan GE, privatize a sinking ship!"
$15 pps by this Friday!!!
"Pretty sure my $14 calls for 4/30 are blown. If there is no run up for earnings, I will be S.O.L... Bought these calls a month ago when it stayed above 13.50 for several days. Decided to hold, it seemed fool proof yet here I a, down over $100. Is there hope at this point? Minimal positive PR, massive manipulation, futures are down. YOLO."
Stock spilit may not get enough vote in MAY due to many investors being opposed. CULP will hear and do what’s best for company and investors. I believe and trust him
$Interest rate will be going up.
"Closed all my call today, gain 20 cents/contractHave a nice weekend to all."
"It has been my experience that corporations that are in good shape DO NOT DO REVERSE STOCKS SPLITS! (I find 8 to 1 particularly nasty and I hope that y' all will remember this when it's time for proxy voting for board members.)(Keep in mind that a major increase in share prices will tend to drive away small investors and leave GE to the big corporations and funds. This is a really mean thing to do and builds huge negative karma. If the stock price isn't up significantly in a year after this reverse stock split, the board needs to go.)"

"great post and many thanks for itwhatever you decide just dont leave this boardneed help with one last puzzle i haveafter spending time and money to install Culp, Ed Garden and Nelson Pelz sold $200 mil of GE at about $6 and then little time later again ED sold $60 mil at little above $10 and all that while they know at least as much as we do about GE potential (did not know Nelson had GE in T Row Price as i only know him for running Trian Fund together with Ed Garden)just like you sometimes i think i am a dreamer but Lary with his under promising and over delivering style keeps reminding me that his GE today is a reality of super achieving storygo GEPS. i dont pay attention to huge past mistakes including french Alston, today GE is Culp's company and common sense tells me that older and wiser Culp can do with GE even better than he did with DHRagaingo GE"

A lot of hootin' & hollerin' today by the Shorts. The screams at the eod were deafening! Expect more as GE continues onward & upward... 
"I've been investing in GE for over 20 years and have accumulated many shares. I still do not understand how the RS will help me recover, with a share average of $22.00."
GE will be $14 tomorrow.
green soon
Most reverses are usually done to avoid delisting. It looks like they are trying to reduce outstanding shares here. I wish they would do it by stock buyback instead. I also think this will make their meager dividend look more insulting. I still like GE but I don't think others perceive it as a $100 stock. Maybe the shareholders will vote it down. I think overall the reverse will cause a lot of short term pain for shareholders

I guess some news this morning connecting GE to RTX is giving GE some boost. We see how far that goes.
What’s the debt level on this company now that they sold the leasing business? What’s the play here? Whats GE’s biggest money makers now?

remember apron stock? the meal kit delivery company. they did a reverse split to get to $5 now it is worth a few pennies!

"Have to say I never considered this. Tim Seymour from CNBC brought up yesterday that GE’s pension obligations, that have totaled $18 billion until recently, will further drop if US bond rates continue going up. He stated that a 2% 10 year rate would cut pension liabilities by almost half down to $10 billion, further stabilizing their balance sheet.This stock is starting to look like a (turnaround from poor management + turnaround from Covid + growth stock + hedge against rising rates)."

I am not jumping ship just before the rescue boats arrive... this is like expiring from Corona virus while the vaccine is here... carbon offset must be completed with wind generation and NG turbines.... boy this is active today.... my word on the split... it will make it more appealing to the street and thus good for PPS. High value stocks and the growth here spell higher PPS for GE... the rescue boat is here... GE will do fine... split will be sometime between 14 months. That is a long time for the current PPS to move.... Sorry for those who sold and jumped... you missed the boat
"That is the way is should work for ALL CEO Poor Performance.........The pay package was rejected by 58% of shareholder votes in the non-binding vote at today's annual meeting, emphasizing growing unease over GE's decision last August to essentially cut in half the stock price targets needed for Culp to qualify for equity-based compensation valued at as much as $232M."

"When I first saw the share price dip after earnings this morning, I honestly did not know if we were about to go into an extended selloff. Lol, especially when it went under $13, but I reminded myself (hoping) it will recover.All in all, I am very encouraged by what happened today. The trend (according to some CNBC analyst) this year is that there is a bit of a sell of after earnings if you don't post gargantuan numbers. By everything I have read, GE's numbers were mixed.Globally, we still have some work to do to see the kind of reopening we all want. We need to get the proper aid to India (its the right thing to do) (sorry it can't be all about the money), and we will see travel at the beginning of the summer explode across Europe, internationally, & of course here at home. Once travel booms, IMO the orders will roll in & GE Aviation will gain altitude that will yield an SP bounce into the 2nd, 3rd, & 4 qtrs. & beyond.What will the reopen look like? Well we already see signs of it if you go outside and see folks moving about your city. Let's look back to post WWI, post Spanish Flu, & granted post prohibition: what followed ?The roaring 20's !!Now granted comparing the 1920's to the 2020's is not an apples to apples comparison but there are comparable trends & circumstances that may give us some guidance as to what is about to happen. BTW, if you get rich in these 20's, save your money for the 30's !The volume today was 148 million plus. A clear sign investors & traders are paying close attention to GE. Volume alone is not a sign of a turnaround but w/GE I do think it is a bullish signal.All things being considered, after today, I am more convinced GE was a smart investment. GE's turnaround could not happen quickly. Baby steps........... Soon GE will be walk'in. Later this year IMO, GE will be runn'in !!Take care."
Any idea?????? $14 today?
I don't know one company that did a RS and the outcome was positive for its shareholders in the short or long run.
"Good Morning to All GE Investors!!!...From Longleaf Partners Fund yesterday:""General Electric (GE) (22%, 1.50%), the revitalized Aviation, Healthcare and Power conglomerate, was a top contributor following on its strong 4Q 2020 performance. Fourth-quarter Healthcare results were excellent, with revenues up 6% year-over-year (YoY), operating margins up 3% to 20% and strong FCF conversion. The Power and Renewables segment improved margins due to strength from gas plant services. With flight traffic increasing, Aviation appears likely to begin a multi-year recovery in the second half of this year. GE also swapped its aircraft leasing operations to AerCap for a 46% stake in the combined company, intelligently wrapping up its previously troubled GE Capital financing operations and further decreasing overall leverage. We continue to be impressed by the turnaround work of CEO Larry Culp, and the stock remains discounted against the quality of the three core business segments.""Best to all GE Investors! ￼"
I think Mr Culp will figure out a way to get GE a nice portion of the infrastructure $$. He's a money-making machine. I'm positive he will get the share price up to the point where he gets his massive and well-deserved bonus. Without him GE would have been toast by now.
Thanks GE workers and Mr. Culp for what you do..... sweet day $$$_
As the airline industry rebounds and they look to return to profits they will buy more fuel efficient jets that utilize GE engines. Great for GE!

Number one manufacturer of JET engines GE Renewables under a democratic liberal government GE Power - Nuclear and Hydrogen (necessary for EV transition) GE Healthcare on the rebound Management would like to get back into the DJIA. Too many positive catalysts 
"Daniel, you said to meCFM does not make more engines than GE.wrong but great you are seeking answers.CFM is a joint venture between GE and Saffron of France and basically all CFM jet engines are GE engines.GE holds numerous patents and 50 years of experience.GE manufactures 66% of all the jet engines existing on this planet.Even though you were wrong saying CFM makes more jet engines than GE - it is good you are looking.you can just Google to get these sort of facts instead of saying things that are totally wrong.GE is so entrenched in making jet turbine engines that even the Chinese national aircraft manufacture cannot copy GE so they work warmly together."
Great close! Next week will be excellent!
now its will be back up see you soon at 15
"Ever since the investor day, we have been heading down despite the fact that it was a productive day. All because of bad timing of the RS announcement...The news basically scared many buyers pushing them to the sidelines waiting for more news and announcement. RS though never a good news, it could work well for GE in the long run. In the short term it killed the acceleration the stock was about to have. At least till the end of 1st quarter we probably going to see nothing of importance as far as stock movement. It seems the sentiment is less BULISH for now."
"Fundamentally nothing have changed with that pending stock split, besides it will be voted in May so this reverse stock split is not a sure thing it will happen. Buying more GE at this price"
"This week could be the greatest opportunity of the year to buy GE under $13 before it climbs higher. The stage is set for the institutions to show retail investors how it's done. I expect them to load up at these prices, scooping up the volume dumped by retail investors.Go, GE!Good luck, longs."
"GE does not belong in the $10-$20 stock price range. This is for small to mid size companies.GE should be in a league with other global conglomerates like HON, ZBRA, MMM, BA, AAPL, CATThis split will achieve this."
This is unbelievable. Thanks GE
dead money till after rs. I am waiting for rs and then a 20% drop. Market condition in 3 Quarter will not help gr price
I told this board GE is DEAD CEO has checked out with hundreds of million$. He can sit on his reverse split ok with me
BOOM! GE IS GOING UP UP! 30b debt reduction...

There are is a key bit of information out about this company that should add around a $100- to $200 dollars to General Electric's stock price pre- split. The info is in the link from $GE's own website and it has to do renewable combined with battery energy storage. They don't even advertise it and that kills me. The CEO Larry Culp needs one of those twit accounts to unvale all of the deep value within $GE instead of waiting months for a damn earnings call. The fool that works for JP Morgan is causing a lot of people to miss out on a lot of wealth that could be made investing in $GE. Here's the link and pass it on: https://www.ge.com/renewableenergy/hybrid/battery-energy-storage
"Comparing GE‘s expenses 2019 and 2020 including interest but without Cost of Goods Sold, they should run operations with 4 billion USD less in 2021 (which is already good for 0.5 USD per share). If there is halfway momentum for Aviation and Renewables, EPS should go closer to 1 USD per share.

"Another day of movement blockage.....GE stock despite all sorts of upgrades, market sentiments, new contracts, good management, debt reduction, etc. etc. etc. can not manage to move upward and stay up....Evil manipulation blocking it......Investigation is needed to find the source of the problem...."
If RS happens and the stock dives let’s see 20%. Then for sure big investors will start buying millions of share making it go back way higher. Perhaps 3 days after the split.
Four stages of Reverse Split.1) Denial - It's good for the company and shareholders.2) Anger - Why didn't I sell when I had a chance.3) Depression - It's going to take many years just to break-even.4) Acceptance - I got screw by this company.
"GE current share count is 8.7B, up about 60M since 2018? After split, share count will be 1.02B. Does anyone here really think GE will run with just 1.02B shares? Be realistic guys. My prediction is that share count will increase by about 3B in the next 3 to 4 years. Shares will be issues to reduce debt. Other than that, core assets will be sold. You cannot have it both ways."
I am some what new to options trading.. How would the reverse split affect the my options contract?
I expect a good - not great Q1. GE is a 3rd Q 21 and beyond story.
"we saw $13.85 last week this week could easily hit $14. We know renewable energy is the future. Good earnings report send ge up another dollar, bad report will drop maybe . 25 cents."

"When GE reports in 4 days, what is more likely; $15 or $12  Thanks for your input!!"
CEO picked a very bad time to mess with people's shares
"Interestingly, ARK started a new SPACE fund recently. People from wall street questioned why the space fund contains less than 50% companies from air/space industry. People called it a fake Space fund, I.e., Hang sheep’s head but selling dog meat. GE is one of largest aviation companies, but ARK fund didn’t own any shares of GE. When GE is at $20, ARK space fund will buy GE. Then, everyone from the street will be recommended to buy. This is the street’s logic because they feel it is too risky when it is at low price. It will become less risky when GE is at $20."
50 DMA being challenged... Once broken all bets are off ...
"if you really want to go back in time -GE was $160 a share in 2000 and split 3:1. Their free cash flow hit all time high of $16.8 billion.ironically with their 4 divisions they still have if Aviation hit $7 billion, medical hit $3 billion, the other two divisions are each at $20 billion sales and could reach 12% to-14% net going forward or $3 billion each.so it is mathematically possible to imagine GE approaching $16 billion fcf in the reasonable future.perhaps I am just dreaming. perhaps I am simply looking further ahead than most others.time will tell."

"Today shows just how weird the GE stock is movingBiden just announced a multi billion dollar new wind zone to be located between New York and New Jersey and GE is the obvious winner.After all, GE leads in US wind turbines and is headquartered in the northeast.GE also had news today that Southwest Airlines had orders 100 Max planes and that means 250 new 9X engines for GE.We also had a major energy upgrade in Nepal for GE to perform.And all day there is top GE news like the $3 billion environmental federal package which is dedicated to climate crises and renewable energy.Do you ever wonder why GE stock would be down on a day like this?It is clearly because of the day traders, the short players, the in and out stock buyers, and not one of them cares a damn about GE.When the stock reprices at 8:1, I hope a lot of these fuzzy characters will disappear.The good news is that GE is performing regardless of the stock players.Long term it is as solid as you can hope for."
"One thing for sure, Larry Culp is has positioned GE for growth. 2021 will be about growth with power in the lead. I surmise their fielding turbine orders the best seen in a decade."

"I can't believe no GE spokesman has presented one word of rational for a reverse stock split. Arguments exist either for or against. We shareholders have a right to know. Their reasoning for doing this should come prior to the announcement. Did I miss something?At this point, I have to believe it's a deliberate attempt to shock the share price down for buy in purposes. If so isn't that illegal coming from an internal source?"

"“Today’s historic agreement paves the way for a standard SF6-free solution for high-voltage equipment in the coming years. This would enable utilities and industries to accelerate their reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, while facilitating their ability to plan, as well as operate and maintain their networks thanks to standardized services and the use of the same auxiliary equipment. For almost half a century, SF6 gas has been the norm in the electrical power transmission and distribution industry due to its unique physical properties. It is, however a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming if leaked. For this reason, GE and Hitachi ABB Power Grids have been investing in the development of better alternatives to SF6. ""Utilities are becoming increasingly aware of their environmental footprint and the impact it has on their communities and the world around them. Today’s landmark agreement reinforces our commitment to help our customers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions,"" said Heiner Markhoff, CEO of GE’s Grid Solutions. ""GE pioneered this fluoronitrile-based gas which we named g3 and subsequently developed a broad SF6-free product range. Our g3 SF6-free products have been commercially available since 2015 and feature the same compactness and performance as traditional SF6 equipment,"" he added."
"Just read from simply Wallstreet that GE is trading at 21% discount. If it ever gets to $16.68, . . . ."
I would be very shocked if the RS passes...I think the institutionals voted against n there was too much push back...The RS will not go through and GE will be in mid $20s by year end!! Just my opinion.
"If you file for rental assistance, you have a ton of paperwork to do. Your landlord also have a ton of paperwork to show including ledgers, bank statements, W2s, etc. Some landlords may not like the scrutiny. So be careful if you are a tenant. And don't let anyone make you believe government is giving money away."
Who are GE long term holders? These are people who have been here so long that they own GE shares for free. Think 10 years and more. They are not to excited about buying GE at $6 and think they are rich.
Always remember UBS recommendations to time your sell/buy...
looks like it's going to range around 13.5 today unless someone makes a big move to either direction.I am looking to hear your opinion on the upcoming RS decision and want to know ur thoughts. Me personally ain't much of a fan but I am not sure if there is a way to stop it as the institution is the majority holder.
It’s still not too late to hop on JJ....
i wonder how many BOD people have made a lot of money in the past 2 days ...this seems pretty fishy to me..
Wonder how the institutions that were hellbent on liquidating at the open no matter what are feeling now.
"I read the GE stories by analysts.They all give the same tired story.GE is fragile, on a very complicated rebound, not out of the woods yet, and Culp is the pied pipperl leading the company to the mecca in the very distant horizon.Nothing could be false than this daily repeated doom and and gloom scenario.The real challenge was most of 2020 when the comic tore the world apart and also the GE recovery plans.I may be the ""fool"" In paradise - but I think the worst is behind GE.For example, GE did not have the steep decline in engines suffered by Rools Royce in $4.6 billion bailout. It was not a disaster like Pratt Whitney. They are emerging in Aviation fully whole and to be feared by rivals.They did incredible progress in wind and totally upset Vesres and Siemens. Both are now playing catch-up.They still have 50% of the world power generators and they are the firm. Allen to build war torn Iraque.They are incredible in body monitor equipment like MRI, sonic tracking g, body function monitors in hospitals, and a whole lot more in medical.All we hear is too much debt. I do not think they have too much debt and they are handling it well and reducingb debt as quick as possible.We keep being jabbed with lack of profits, but everyone with a shred of common sense can clearly see that is coming in the next 24 months.Pensions, dividends, and GE Capital have been hammered to death.All of these are being handled well and reduced systematically.Talk like $5 a share is babble- PURE AND SIMPLE BY ANALYSTS THAT ARE RIDICULOUS.So if you look today at GE compared to a year ago in April, it has come so far.What is now needed is patience.The risk that GE won't go back to a much more profitable worldwide essential manufacturing company is a foregone c I nclusion.Shaking the lingering doubters will take time to heal - but heal it will."
dragonMarch 10th on TV Ed Gardner said the 200 million ge sale was because t row price had deadline to fund a previous deal and sadly cashed very small amount of ge.Ed Gardner said his $60 million sale of ge stock was a preplan for his estate and routine transaction - not any reflection on ge forward proce declining.he still has large holding in ge.
"If share holders approve reverse split come May 2021 then the board of directors will decide when to implement the reverse split, ""it can only be done on any day after May 2022"". If it was to get approved by share holders it would result in total devistation to anyone holding a short position in the stock the day the stock reverse split, eqal to instant margin call.

"Vote or no vote, reverse split is coming for sure. Your 10 shares will become 1 share plus some pennies. If you can afford to add 6 shares now, you get 2 shares for your 16 shares. Just saying."
I see 20 and then RS and then 160 and will soon to 200
Reverse split for GE? or I read wrong?
The decision to RS/ 1 for 8 will leave way to much room for GE to fall. GE is to financially too frail to proceed with the RS at this point.

"Worlds Largest Offshore Wind Farm to Power 4.8 Million Homes Bakker Magnetics is starting the production and assembly of magnetic modules which will power GE Renewable Energy turbines for the worlds largest offshore wind farm.SME finance specialist Caple has facilitated 3.9m/3.4m in funding for this Dutch company. The loan for the North Sea project was provided by BNP PARIBAS Asset Management.The magnetic modules are for GEs Haliade X wind turbines. These are the largest available and will be placed in three wind parks off the North Eastern coast of England on the Dogger Bank.When fully operational, these wind parks will generate 3.6 gigawatts of electricity which is enough to power 4.8 million homes in England. The parks are expected to become operational in the course of 2023.Michiel Slinkert, managing partner at Caple, said: This type of financing requires a bespoke solution and cannot be provided by the main clearing banks.As an alternative financing specialist we were able, together with our corporate finance partner De Beemt Corporate Finance, to tailor an attractive financing structure.Jointly we managed to create significant added value to the funding. We are proud to have been able to contribute to this important sustainable energy project with a large impact.The contract with GE Renewable Energy represents an important increase in production for Bakker Magnetics.The company is a global technical leader in design and assembly of magnets for wind turbines.The magnetic modules are collared between the blades of the turbines and the casing and create a magnetic field which on movement generates electricity. The principle is identical to that of a bicycle dynamo but on a far larger scale.Geert-Jan Bakker, CEO at Bakker Magnetics, said: The main challenge lies in the assembly of the modules.Each module contains 147 magnets in different shapes and forms and North and South polarities. It is a substantial and challenging project for us but it is also an international recognition that we have been involved in the realisation of the largest offshore wind park in the world.The Haliade X is a direct drive wind turbine. With 12 MW capacity it is one of the largest on earth.Haliades blades measure 107 meters and its 600 ton turbine assembly is positioned at a height of approximately 135 meters more than a 30 to 35 storey building. 2021 Global Data Point."

"Double to $26.20, you will see this brier 2022."
Down a few cents and the bears come out like they won the gold medal. How much have the shorts lost since $5?
"On second thoughts, the timing for the RS is fair. A reverse split at $13 will place the share price at $100+. At this price level, 1. daily flippers will be gone quickly. 2. shorts cannot short all the way to $6 again3. price drop will be limited if and when new shares are issued"
"With all the negative comments, I have to admit I regret I did not buy more at 7. Don’t know how the RS will turn out therefore would not buy more now, but the deal makes GE more and more what I want it to see and why I bought it... It’s an industrial conglomerate, more and more focused on its core"

Good Day to All GE Investors!!!
GE already act like stock that was reverese split
"Reverse split is completely overcooked, looking at Siemens without Health and without Energy: they have 850 m shares outstanding with a market cap more or less comparable with GE. So what’s the point ? Looking at AVGO / AMZN/GOOGLE etc.: is the shares price in absolute terms a reason for private retailers not to buy these shares ? Share price drop only gives opportunity for institutional buyers to enter the boat. Im more convinced than ever that GEs next move will be to spin off some segments, like Siemens did. It’s a pity that the main news are muddled under: good deal for GE and business is picking up !!!GLTA"
What time does Larry Culp speak tomor confirming Aviation deal?
S&P should hold the lower band today. Might get a decent bounce off it.
Think about it. The stock has been rising steadily and the banks and huge fund managers missed the first train. Now with all there power absent a Redit rush they are able to back up that first train and get on. This is going up up up.
"“I’m aggressive. I work with homeless in the county,” said Swan, who is 64. But she said she worried about the more passive and trusting neighbors in her senior living complex. She later discovered that many had been persuaded to take the tests and divulge their family medical histories.To seniors curious about these DNA tests, Richmond of the inspector general’s office has this advice: “If anyone calls you, or sends you an unsolicited request for your Medicare number or to convince you or scare you into taking a genetic test, either hang up the phone or say no.”Seniors interested in the tests should call their primary care provider, he said: “Don’t give into the manipulation or the scare tactics to get this health care test from someone you don’t know.”"

"GE is going to end up like C (Citigroup) after the RSIn early 2009, C was the most actively traded stock. It had risen from $1 to just over $5 when they announced a reverse split. I had made a bundle trading it and selling option premium. When I heard about the RS, I sold my entire position. The RS ruined the stock. The stock has barely risen above my sell price of 5.30 (53.00 adjusted for the split) after all of these years."

How many believe as I do that after the R/S announcement this week will come the offering of shiny new shares. After almost every R/S I've seen that's what they do. DRYS was the great master. With 1.1B outstanding shares they can issue 1B more. Dilution at it's finest.
A few years ago the PG board had a few downers - there was one in particular named Snowcats - we figured his father was fired and as a result spent all his time blasting the company and Sr management. Then peltz got involved and the CEO got religion and company stock has more than doubled. What happened to the “downers” - why they disappeared. I suspect by this time next year we will be free from the incessant idiot posts as well.

"Electric vehicles use our highway infrastructure just like gasoline cars. Every gallon of gasoline purchased at the pump has a road tax included in the price - around 50 cents or so.

"Its about time the West and other countries sharply cut imports from China. Time to shift supply chains away from China and not fund the CCP and its aggressive policies. China has grown powerful because the world naively believed that by opening up China with trade, that they would see China develop away from communist hegemony. Sadly its been shown to be a farce. Millions of job losses, huge technology theft, predatory pricing, massive pollution, corruption, fake goods and human rights abuses have followed. And now COVID. China belligerant attitudes need to be confronted. Time to cut off ALL trade, ban travel and migration from China, cut off access to dollars, cut off access to World Bank and IMF. The CCP are an unelected brutal mob. Time to stop funding them."

"I suppose GE may go up a bit based on sentiments. But I believe the fair price of GE stock at this time is between $8 - $9. If I have to pay above that for a GE share then there needs be a strong reason that EPS forecast will be a beat going forward. I don’t see any sign of that, in fact EPS for this year was revised down to 15-20 cents. With the sale of leasing business it will affect potential earnings next year. I sold all my positions in GE, 30h shares last week. I will get in if it get back to $8"

"Don't do a reverse split which will only result in GE's share fire falling back down to the level prior to the reverse split (The Wall Street Crooks will work in tandem, their analytical teams will issue upgrades to the stock after the reverse split, while their trading arm sells the stock short, and then surprise, surprise, the share price will tank).Instead of a reverse split, GE should cancel all stock options, buy back stock, and increase the dividend.What is the point of a reverse split if GE still issues stock options which continues to dilute the share count?Reverse splits are a disaster, they rarely work (few examples such as Booking Holdings). Usually what happens is the stock price falls back lower than it was prior to the reverse split."
There's an increase in short positions of $GE.
Stay long!
Now that the reverse split has been approved it would be a good time to have a secondary offering to raise a lot of money. After you do the secondary offering you then do the reverse split.

Help me get this right. CEO and Board of directors want to help the shares by destroying them. Am I missing something. I guess 100% gain in less than 6 months was not good enough. Maybe it was TOO good.
"Wow look at them calls being traded: eg the March 19 15 strike over 20,500 volume."

Be nice if a trading firm were looking to buy a big block of GEE!
Good morning BAGGIES. Looks like another fine day for us shorts. GE will be red all day. 12s are coming soon. Time for you to purchase some calls.
What if GE announces a dividend increase and a change to the stock reversal (1:4 vs. 1:8)...also increase the FCF guidance to $3.0-$5.5B? That will bring good things to life for a lot us tomorrow. We’ll forget it’s Tuesday and get hammered before the day even begins

The vote will be yes for the reverse split...
Sad case
Do any of you really have faith in GE or their management? Their decisions to date don't instill confidence in me. Any and all comments or opinions welcomed.
"you should know by now, the rosy pictures painted here are not representative of reality. for that you have to do your own research. and look at the negative, guidelines here are just as important for the investor."
Reverse split makes sense and a great idea. F should do the same this year.
BAGGIES after today's earnings announcement.
"Today is ridiculous! GE stock is selling for peanuts....Nothing could please me with the reverse stock split.It will get rid of the 175 million share swings like today. A higher stock will stop the incredible up and down ""bouncing"" - as much as 8% in a day.and it will definitely get rid of the pranksters like JJ on this board who are NOT investing since none of them will buy stock over $100.How could a company that has paid over $75 billion in reducing debt and almost extinguished long term debt over the past 36 months be in a dive like today.We are like a banana republic. Small minded and with no idea what they want. Our public unskilled stock buying crowd is in a temper tantrum. Don't get your way - scream.Don't like higher priced stocks - take the stock into a dive.This is totally irrational behavior.... Today I agree this should have been a win-win day. All the GE conference news was positive.The stock should have shot through the roof - but it is in a funk.Longer term nothing has changed and any serious investor will make out.Short sellers may be suffering today but the regular investor is ok.About the split. It is appropriate to take the stock in the $104 price range (8x$13). It still is much lower than Honeywell, 3m, Caterpillar, and a lot of others. At $104 there is plenty for room to double and triple - much like Microsoft, Boeing, and Raytheon to name a few.With the stock higher priced it may allow a return to a modest dividend going forward in a year. ."

Unbelievable news.. reverse splits only help struggling companies. Never help existing shareholders. Imagine trying to find buyers @ 95.00 per share.. the shorts will drive it down 50% easily. It goes to shoe GE could care less about their shareholders.

This will take stock price to $111 which would be less attractive to an average investor..no one would want GE to be so expensive, $40 to $50 might be ok and not by RS but by gaining investor confidence and planning as CULP has been doing so far..The board need wake up and see facts.I am pretty sure after more research and thinking they will vote against it in MAY specially if stock keeps gaining value. It was not smart to talk about it today at all, since it is not even decided to do so...... RS will harm GE as well as the investors.......we say NEY to RS......"

"Oh man, even the value plays like GE and GM are getting slammed for no good reason today. Tough times to be long, but I still feel more secure holding this rather than 90% of ARK’s portfolio. There is no way we are at these levels in 12 months."

I am not a big potatoes investor and while I am bullish on GE, I don't see the reverse split paying back in driving up share price to a corresponding level and beyond. I've never held a stock at that level of reverse split that panned out in my favor."
Black Cat is correct about options. Time to minimize these games with reverse split !!
Obviously asset sales in a depressed economy is not going to save GE. So GE has three options to survive.1. Execute an RS and issue new shares to raise cash/reduce debt2. Declare bankruptcy and start afresh like GM3. Delist and go privateGE management will do whatever it takes to keep GE as a source of income for themselves primarily. It is your duty as an investor to weigh all the options and decide what you want to do. Do not just see what you want to see or what they present in front of you. There is a process.
"jj, tell us (again) why you tried to pump $SRRA during a reverse split, which continued to go down even more?"
I don't care what Culp makes. Just keep the stock price moving Northbound buddy... 
"PaulineI have a massive position in GE.When they hit a 30 year low in September, I bought all I could afford at $5.98 and never regretted it.I have watched GE since 1970 but never bought because it was run by arrogant people and always seemed over priced.When I saw it crater Q2 2020 - I knew it had hit bottom.I never doubted their strengths. Just their poor leadershipCulp is exactly the right person to pull GR to great new levels and I can wait until the stock hits a real high price level.It is way far from its potentialI own a large corporation and can see the really great decisions being made.And I also think Culp is totally entitle to the large bonus package because he is succeedingIf he succeeds. we all suceed."
testing to post
jj's posts have been especially low-IQ this past week. Might have to demote him.

"GE today massacred clowns and mannequins who last week tried to ""teach"" the CEO how to run a business like this."
Have to imagine there's a lot of investors that sold now wondering what they did lol. Buy.
"8:1 reverse split, not shareholder friendly. I will put money on they are raising their share price to do an offering six months or so after they do their reverse split. I have been through several reverse splits and have studied the matter continuously for 40 years. The reverse split never goes to the percentage, but always under the percentage, in this case 1 for 8 proposed. Shareholders get spooked and so do investment friends and retirement funds when a stock is shaken up by a reverse split. If they can’t entice the street to upgrade their share price, they do it manually. Red flag.￼￼"
Looks like jj will be shorting fractional shares after the split. LOL
"In my opinion, Mr. Culp is doing a terrific job turning GE around and establishing a future path for the company's success. However, we need a cheerleader and I sense he is weak at that. The share price will eventually trend up, as it already has, but he needs to appoint or hire someone who can shout our products and services to the world. We no longer have the best appliances, light bulbs etc. for them to see!That's how to rocket the share price up."
GE = F = 100+ years old = bad management = heavy debt= disappointment = unhappy investors = manipulated = and many more

My 1000 shares of GE cost $6250. My 200 shares of Roku cost $8400. Today the GE is worth about $14200 and the Roku is worth $72000. I am happy with both.
"Retail selling, big boys buying."
"Wonder the agenda, sinister, if any, behind the UBS upgrade just week before the 3 month option expiration ( April 16th) !"
Why do they want you to focus on debt reduction while GE has been issuing shares since 2018 while offloading assets? This is the same game played by Economou of DRYS which resulted in about 8 reverse splits before he took the company private.
"the year of the CULP and his deployment of $$$$45 billion into new profit centers, easy $40 stock in a couple years ,alot more health care and Space m&a announcements coming"

what are the chances of the split amount changing from 8 to 5 or 4?
"ge engines part 420 percent longer life and as much as 65 percent more power to weight.GE Aviation invests more than $1 billion each year in research and development, positioning the company to lead advancements in military propulsion for generations to come.GE Becomes Leading Commercial Engine SupplierBuilding on the technology of the TF39 military engine, GE moved aggressively into the civil market in 1971 with a derivative engine, the CF6-6 high bypass turbofan engine, on the Douglas DC-10. The CF6 family grew to include the CF6-50, CF6-80A, CF6-80C2 and CF6-80E1. In the 1980s, the CF6 family of engines emerged as the most popular engines powering wide-body aircraft, including the Boeing 747 and 767, the Airbus A300, A310, A330 and the McDonnell Douglas MD-11.The CF6, in service since 1971, continues to add to its impressive record of flight hours, more than any other commercial aircraft engine ever accumulated. To put that in perspective, it is the equivalent of one engine running 24 hours a day, 365 days a year for more than 26,000 years.The CF6-80C2 engine, which entered service in 1985, has set new standards of reliability in commercial service and has been instrumental in the rise of GE as a leading supplier of large commercial engines.Perhaps the greatest compliment afforded the CF6-80C2 was the U.S. government's selecting the engine to power the U.S. president's 747 aircraft, Air Force One.The CF6 engine family, in service since 1971, continues to add to its impressive record of flight hours, more than any other high-thrust commercial jet engine ever accumulated. To put that in perspective, it is the equivalent of one engine running 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, for more than 28,000 years."
Hey everyone. JJ just shorted 10k at $14.34! 
Looking to break out - descending triangle pattern - let’s go!
"The big guys can handle a $14 stock just as well as a $112 stock and they must have done all they wanted (or could) with the stock, the thing they cannot handle is the large number (38% of float) of small potatoes messing up or taking advantages of their game plan going forward in the stock movement. This is the real reason for the RS, to make it much harder for the small potatoes to get into the play. Management has to cooperate with those so-called analysts/institution investors (they need, benefit and help each other all the times) as long as the RS does not hurt the company in any ways, it practically does nothing to the value of the company.If you have couple of years of patience with the stock, you will certainly not regret it, go with the big guys but you have to be able to read their movements like a chess player."
Holey Moley!!! Does anyone think this will hit $14 this year???
The break at 13 was huge. Now at another resist point...could see $18 if strong breakout
"GE A VIATION Eng Dominating 60% Mkt Share, Like GOOGLE search.. But GE Renewable will surpass that in 5--8 yrs. GE Renewable alone, already near $$20 BILLION Revenue and GROWING, just got started.."
Sold all my shares with a loss. Things are not looking good for retail investors with the RS.
GE saved 230 million today but the stock did not reflect it. Or is there a loop hole somewhere?
"Why didn't Culp buy back GE shares when we were trading below $6. The US Govt offered billions to businesses during the 1st Pandemic wave, Culp refused to make use of the opportunity to help the shareholders? Whose advice is he taking?"
"Guess who was the smart guy who bought a ton of options thinking the 30 billion deal was gonna make the stock jump ? Yep... story of my life. Bought nikola it dropped $50 a day laterBought kodak, it dropped 75% 3 days later. Been holding workhorse for a year hoping the usps contract would go through, lost 25 a share on that dealBought tesla and apple when they did their splits...lost money for the next 2 months after that. If you ever wanna know when to place a put just ask what im buying and your put will skyrocket!GE ... ya let me down"

"Credit Suisse is caught in the HF fiasco too.A little known hedge fund that blew up last week has sent shockwaves through the world of investment banking.Shares in Credit Suisse (CSGN.SW) and Nomura (8604.T) sunk over 10% on Monday after both warned they faced potentially billions in losses linked to hedge fund Archegos Capital.Banks that worked with Archegos and lent it money to buy shares were scrambling to offload Archegos' investments after a handful of risky bets made by the hedge fund went bad. The rush to exit these positions hit public shares prices, leaving banks with huge losses."
21$ by August
So people like money so do we. It's not greed it's need. 
"Will GE close above $13.5 this Friday? Last Week, GE tested $13 low and it started turning to bullish sign last Friday. The bullish sign is confirmed today with higher volume and tested $13.5 this morning. Because the Dow John indexes dropped, GE retreated from $13.5 to $13.35. The bullish sign has formed. I believe GE will retest $13.5 and close above $13.5 next few days and $14 by next Friday. If that happens, GE will breakout the $14.5 and moves to $16 range. GE looks very bullish. Prepare for the breakout."
My hat off to Larry Culp. His job through the lock-downs were nothing short of incredible. Buy.
buying opportunity shorts will cover in big numbers real soon and then it's up up and away
BOOM
Cannot believe GE is only a few big companies are down today when the indexes are up big. The bears attack GE badly. They tried to create a technical bearish pattern so that the short term traders to dump their shares. Unbelievable!
GE showing improvement in all divisions...looking anxiously toward next earnings report... We should all be Happy!
SOLD 30K AT 13.26!
Everyone doing alright today?
"closes the day over $14, eps beat,s forward statement coming out ,now watch year of the CULP use $80 billion in cash for M&A deals"
Hold your shares. The momentum has just started. I’m very happy to invest in GE because they care 200% for the business. Bright days ahead of us
"Analysts predict 3% sales growth in next 5 years....Ford analysts predict 48% same time frame. Ford is cheaper at 11.41. Ford isn't gonna R/S. Ford has been around almost as long. Just bought me some Ford, I was gonna spend the money here. Nextera just had a 5/1 split and is at almost 80 already. Nextera pays 38 times GE pathetic dividend they wouldn't raise. Nextera will have 3 times their growth in the next 5 years. WAB was GE's. Now it is ding well and predicts 10% growth in just this quarter. WAB pays 12 times GE's dividend. WAB has 4 strong buys 2 buys and 7 hold ratings, went up 6% since GE sold it and made almost 4 dollars a share last 4 quarters. WAB is doing very well NOT under Culp. Anyone catching my drift about now. No please tell me pumpers why we should be paying our money to buy this 25 years and still the same price garbage."
"What is really going on? Aggressive accounting at GE is an understatement. They are BROKE. When rates rise on their debt, they will have to sell off more business or declare bankruptcy. I think new mgmt is doing the right thing by coming clean. It will send this stock down below 5 and maybe $2 bucks so they need reverse split before it hits the fan... optics are worse if they do a RS at 2 bucks... now they can spin it in a favorable way."
"I suggest voting for RS so we get it over with quickly. But if you are short and want to continue to trade the range, vote no to drag it out. I bet you won't get enough no votes."
On Monday Ford stock was near $11.2 when Ge was trading at $13.25...today ford is above $13 passing GE stock price and in race to get to $14 despite all kinds of bad news about chip shortage and supply problem......GE has got dozens of upgrades and good news still struggling to keep its $13 pants on.... Management ruined it by dumb idea of RS......................
Good thing they want to split the stock and give CEO hundreds of millions of dollars. This could be 16 or 17$ by now
If they are splitting the stock to try and boost mkt cap I got bad news. It will have opposite effect. Could it be that jpm is having their way with the wonder boy?
Looks Like CEO Culp won't be collecting his 250 Million dollar bonus. Did he think Wall Street would embrace his reverse split plan? Shareholders lost at least that much from his ill advised announcement.
Do share holders get to vote on the reverse split? Would institutional investorsvote it down?
"It took 20days+ to get to its peak at $14+ and took just 2days to drop back to $12.19. Sad me, was at %50+ profit but will continue to long."
"Ge please reverse split 1 for 8 ...so the cheapskate gambler can not play around with their weekly pay check, that way they can not buy then sell with 10 penny gain."
Just looked it up....GE is the same price it was in 1996. The dollar was worth 1.70 compared to today. Just imagine with a company match in your 401k you still have less money after 25 years in your 401k than you would if you through cash under your mattress.....of course I am taking into consideration that the money was taxed at 20% before you got it. Glad I didn't work all my life for that group.
GE Logo on Electric/Hydrogen aviation engines! 
The BKR move post GE sale is typical of a companies stock price response after losing more of the GE hex influence. Amazing the influence GE has on other companies stock. When they get away from it.
"Another fine sale by Culpable. Baker Hughes up over 10% since GE unloaded about 1 billion dollars in shares. That equates to 100 million dollars. GE has the touch of death. Look at companies that GE unloaded and how they are doing. Synchrony need I say more. Up over 100% plus. How about Wabtec, or Healthcare spinoff? They are doing great after getting away from GE. BAGGIES don't understand that this company is a disgrace and Culprit has done nothing but sell businesses for less than what they are worth. But he is a good old boy and his cronies on the board will take care of him. How's the 1 cent dividend going? The way this company run, they should be making and selling the Edsel. Corruption at its finest."
JPM/Tusa - 146 GE ratings with 77% success rateUBS/Markus - 11 GE ratings with 75% success rateWe see what happens.
Remember....New Baggies= Shorts! 
Looks like a 200M volume day deep in the red. Know what that means?
GE is Wild today
Still a fan of GE at this price. I would buy more if I could. Buy GE...!!! 20.00+++ SoooooN
BAC CEO plans to raise dividend and increase share buyback. Says investors should benefit. Unlike GE.
Cover!!! lol
"many, many, many more Acquisitions on the way,CULP will make GE another DANAHER stock closes near $15 this week, then straight to $25 as GRASSO said"
"after eps 4/27 stock moves over $16, the year of the CULP about to take off, forward statement later this month, TUSA with a rec. coming soon"
GECAS deal is excellent; reverse split means nothing but simplification.
Culps list to benefit shareholders.
According to daily TSA Air Traveler volume statistics the number of travelers last week exceeded 60% of 2019 volume and 800% of 2020 volume. Do jet engines still require maintenance?
"I used to be an buyer and long GE,.. Then on ""Investors"" day they let me know that my business was no longer welcomed. Now, I'm no longer a GE investor, I'm a GE trader and I play them both ways. That's the only way to make money with this pig for now."
Reverse split worse thing that can happen every company that does this retracts even more
Looking Good! 
Vote against GE Reverse split 1- 8!!!!!
"Investment 101: you need to invest to make that money grow.1. Dividend was cut from 23 cents to 1 cent2. Assets were given away at garage sell prices3. 8 for 1 reverse split was announced, potential making way for future dilution of shares4. CEO wants 200+ million dollars for his effortsWhich of these actions do you think will make your money grow?"
Mead2014 They are selling their assets to pay their bills. Ever wonder what the interest on the 50B dollars they owe is? I am sure the 2 cents for last years EBIDTA isn't gonna cover it.
"All posts forecast dropping stock price re; r/s. Yet to read why? Why would mgmt / bod do anything that would automatically translate to long-term price decline? Price decline hurts Institutional as well as Retail investors, not to mention bod stock holdings. Can someone explain or interpret this paradox???"
GE was unstoppable today
Congratulations to all GE Investors this week! Have a great weekend and see you all on Monday!And let's not forget...who are the Baggies? 
Yes my PLUG or SPWR stocks are better performers but there will always be a place for a GE in my portfolio!
PRICELINE Reverse Split was 1:6 back $1+ in 2003.. UP nearly 3000%
"It is wrong to say GE raised 1 Billion by selling BKR shares. The fact is that GE recouped about 50% of what it invested. GE lost money - investors money. GE and all the cheerleaders need to play fair with investors. We are not stupid. The cheerleaders what you to think that the only person who is important for GE turnaround is Culp. That is total braindead believe. GE need to come out clear with investors, own up to it's mistakes and lay out a plan for rewarding investors when turn around happens. If only Culp can do it and leap all the rewards, then not with my money. When he is done, I will pour cash in. We all love GE."
no more sellers
"Finally SHAREHOLDERS see/exposed Culp SNAKE/Betrayer.. Culp is good admin, but he instead decides to serve the interest of short term BOSS MASTERS OUTSIDERS.. VERY SAD AND UNFORTUNATE.."
Up ahead of earnings
"I think GE’s timing could have been better with regard to the reverse split announcement, it made me question the strategy. Although it may be a good business move for not only the company, but in the long run the regular investor as well, they should have rode the GREAT news of the AerCap Deal at least until next earnings report. In my opinion, GE share price would have at least rose to 17-18$ by then, no? I’ve been with GE since 2012 and have bought shares at 30$ and as low as 6.50$. I believe in this Company and I am very excited what Culp is doing to simplify GE’s model, lower its debt, and look after their employees and their customers. Future earnings and revenue should greatly sharpen as time transpires. We just need to be patient and it will happen, especially with energy efficiency talks growing rapidly and GE leading the way with wind turbines off shore in the U.K., no? Until public opinion grows extremely bullish (another 3-4 mo or so), the share price will gradually climb until it finally explodes to what it should be worth with their prevailing winds. I estimate that to be $27.80 in the short term and $38.50 in the long run.I’m an average, novice, amateur investor and not a financial advisor. Trade and invest at your own risk. This was simply a conversational post. Take care everyone and whether you are bearish or bullish, I wish all future prosperity."
Reverse split: much ado about nothing.
13 is undervalued. Alive money. Rick kills me. These shorts have been saying the same thing for months and will keep saying it all the way to 20+.
Day to day price movement is small talk around the water cooler.Long haul boys will discuss their GE at a nice restaurant with a med-rare ribeye and a glass of wine.Looooong...Bon appetite 
Pretty strong sell-off this morning. Over what? Culp masterfully turning us around? Buy.
"For 2-3 months I have been slowly closing my position in technology companies and switching to shares related to the aviation industry and airline companies. GE, Boeing, Airbus, Lufhansa, Delta.There are already nice earnings, but the best is probably still ahead."
"You know something good is about to happen when all the shorties start posting anxious messages on the board. :-) JJ, Niklas, have fun tonight/tomorrow!"
I think that in the and they will not make a reverse split.... but what are you saying is ge came out in sad for sure that they will do it?????
2.2% drop on No News?
GE will definitely close over $13. great preformer today... 
This merger is going to be crazy. A month ago I said $14 by March 15 April.... looks like it’s going that way. I thought it was going to go sideways after $16.. but now I see $17-18 by the spring summer... hopefully $20 by the end of the year or next year $30
if you have Tesla you had a good day. GE no worries. see you Monday. GE
GE to 25$ I read
YEAR of the CULT!
GE_to_$14
Still undervalued should be 25.00 see glory days return soon.
"Wow, I can buy General Electric stock for 13 dollars a share!"
This stock will still double. Pent-up travel demand will be the hottest news in a couple of months.
"Ask any long why GE will move toward 20 a share and they will answer you very sincerely....""just because!!!"""
Did they mention the reverse split yet?
"Your money will have to work much hard after a R/S to make a profit. Typically stock prices fall about 20% after a R/S. Then, you have 1/8th the amount shares. If you are a shareholder, vote against this."
Unusual heavy volume trading of $14 Call Options..
Accumulating 500 shares at $13.41 this morning. 500 more shares limited orders to buy at $13.35. There are still 7500 contracts call@13.5 outstanding. This is the reason who the market makers tried to push GE below $13.5 before the market close so that these options to expire worthless. This is an opportunity to accumulate some shares.
"For anyone thinking dividend will come back - it is a bad guess.when Culp ran Danahrr for 17 years they have always been dividend stingyThis year it is $ .72 cents on a $235 stock - 1/3rd of 1%.Any extra money will pay down debt or buy another company.That has been the Culp game plan for years and expect it going forward.The success of truly good management is to stay Lazer focused on bottom line reducing costs, spending wisely, and maximizing profits.With a sprawling giant worldwide company - unlimited opportunities to do all of these things.Going forward even if GE did not have tremendous opportunities like RENEWABLES, they still could have been immensely profitable going forward.with RENEWABLES - LOOK OUT!And remember that the CFO on March 10th said they would have Q1 just miss profit-but all the rest of the year it would be pue profit quarters.Patience is now the real test. Not IF, just WHEN."
"Two dour analysts - John Inch and Steve TusaBoth are not being fair.I look at John Inch talk about GE not having a 3% PRE CASH YIELD.This is just plain ""babble"". (incoherent talk)Ditto for Steve Tusa who still is on the ""too much debt"" kick or ""GE Power is their ""achilles heel"" talk.Think of buying a house. If all you can see is the debt, you are blind of the asset being worth more than the debt.The same logic hold for John Inch's babble. GE is a painting and the picture is not nearly finished yet. But people buy it because they can see where it is heading...It is true GE lacks the massive profit. But you are investing on the ""belief"" and NOT the actual ""today profit"".Think of it as a""hunch"" or the ""potential"" or your ""intuition"".They are all well founded ideas that will pay off.If people did not think the future held promise - nobody would open a new business or take any risk.My wife is similar to John Inch and Steve Tusa in her thinking.She sees the debt but forgets the assets.General Electric has a lot of hidden wealth that normally would take it to the top of the list for investors.It suffers from 20 years of bad leadership and destroyed hope for investors (and Inch and Tusa).So GE has to show them it can perform - which is will do this year.."
Larry C has to start making money for shareholders or get out....he is at the top of the pay scale and so far has fallen flat for shareholders after his initial recovery. Should move on to a new CEO who is more capable in moving the company forward....enough already.... Boolean

why suggest a reverse split with the stock trading at $14 when the normal thing would have been to reverse it when it was 3 or 4 bucks ?

If they can keep the news about RS quiet this could move up to $15 by early summer. IMO
overreaction. Nothing changes for the company itself. GE is on a good way to recover. RS makes no impact.
It’s taken me 4 tries to United toll free to have a wait of less than 60 minutes to book a flight (couldn’t do online because of travel specifics).People are traveling!! GE Aviation will do blockbuster numbers in the next 12-24 months. Mark it.
I don't buy the reason to do a reverse split. I don't recall a case where a reverse split meant well.
General Electric is up 5.37% to 14.33
"GE picks up 300MW German onshore wind order GE Renewable Energy has picked up a 300MW order from EPH-owned EP New Energies.The 50 6MW wind turbines will be installed at onshore farms being developed by EP New Energies in Germany, including the 100MW project Forst-Briesnig 2 in the Federal State of Brandenburg, owned by LEAG.The approval procedures for the projects will start as early as this year with the first construction to start in 2023.This step is part of EPH groups renewable energy strategy to transform real estate capabilities and former open-cast mining areas by implementing onshore wind energy and photovoltaics.EPH senior executive Tom David said: ""EPH is taking an active role in transforming the energy system.""We seek real solutions of transition towards sustainable power generation, this is one of them.""EPH currently operates both directly and via its equity participations 1,500MW (1.5GW) of renewables and almost 1000MW of energy storage capacities.EP New Energies managing director Dominique Guillou added: ""We are quite enthusiastic about being among the first to deploy the General Electric 6MW Cypress wind turbines, one of the most modern turbine technologies on the market.""More so, as this deal is remarkable in its size in Germany.""It puts us in the Premier League of wind project developers.

dow went up 500 poits thurs and Friday and this is down 20 cents. in heavens name why.
it will go up today lol on good news
Stock buy back is better than reverse split. Chinese companies offer many shares for shareholders so many people can invest in the company. Reverse split is not good for very large companies like GE. Stock buy back is better. GE will go back to $100 if they just keep doing the right things.
there's that elusive $13.... up . 20 cents from the last dip .... sweet... 
Shareholders vote: Fire the CEO.General Electric shareholders reject CEO Culp's pay deal.
"much of successful investing depends on personal research, and that includes reading negative comments.ges outlook should improve over time, updated info would give clues."
"The way people post, you'd think that this company just makes aircraft engines. Aviation is the largest division by revenue, but the next three divisions are nearly as large."
"Shareholders rejected Culp’s pay compensation, but no binding affect. In other words. Culp will still get his modified bonus plans since that is a legal binding.Based on the modified plans, Culp has already achieved 100% of his target goal since GE’s stock price has above $13.34 for 30 days. He will get 9.3 million shares of GE stock. When GE’s stock price rise above $16.68 for 30 days, he will get almost 14 million shares of Ge stock. These are not options, it is really stock. In other words, Culp will get $280 million when GE’s price reaches $20."
If Culp is so smart why is stock trading no higher than it did 3 mo ago?
"2035 is like, six months from now! Up Up and Away!!!"
"GE will bounce back, not to worry !"
huge finish.
The 1 for 8 reverse plit will send the day traders to another place. Can't happen soon enough.
"Did you notice that us citizens making under $100,000 have received substantial tax cuts which why the economy is booming again? Nice."
"If the RS is canceled tonight, GE will jump to $16 on Monday. That is how you know it is not good."
free tip short Bitcoin
"BA has exploded due to nearing deal with Southwest for 737MAX which would be beneficial for GE as well. If it wasn’t for the RS announcement, we could have crossed higher than $15 for sure. Though too early to say what happens in MAY but we should let the board realize that RS is bad and it already wiped off $20B in market cap in just couple of days and there could be more shedding if Culp doesn’t gain investors confidence. I say NEY to RS and instead please concentrate in growth of the company by getting more business contract."
"Call me sentimental, but as a long time small retail investor who recently sold all of my GE holdings yesterday at $13.10. I just purchased 8 shares right now at $12.20, This will be the last time I spend even a dollar on GE or a GE product unless they reverse their decision to do a reverse split."
The only reason for the RS is to issue more shares after the split. Issue 1billion shares at $100 and whala $100 billion dollars. And then ge is at 200 billion shares outstanding and price drops to $50. Then price drops to $40 then price drops to $30. Am I right?
"Institutions and mutual funds are acquiring shares today. They know the RS is a good move, will reduce volatility. Unfortunately for Mark, JJ and J J, then will then have 1/8 of one share to play with, hahaha."
"GE Renewable ALONE should be valued $$290 BILLION. $33 a share. or 15 times revenue, other Renewables are valued 30-60 times revenue. Even if you give half that value to GE Renewalble near $20 BILLION REVENUE, That is easily $$300+ BILLION or $40 share price just Renewable alone. Then add AVIATION crown-jewel, near monopoly, best most RELIABLE, generational most complex engendering technological advancement, makes skyscrapers fly, AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, MSFT, FB NFLX Can do that.. Then there is HEALTHCARE CT-Scan, MRI, X-Ray, etc TECHNOLOGIES... GE EASILY $$$100+ STOCK before R.Split. GE could also start charging higher price margins on AVIATION ENGINES.. AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, Charging high margine why not GE.."
"Mr. CEO Culp, #1..WHY DID YOU NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GOV/FED FREE HELP and dump Pension on Gov.. Wllst Darlings AAPL, GOOG, FB, MSFT, NFLX, TSLA Netc do not provide Pension, why GE only.. All the Aviation, BOAING Companies took massive help from Gov.. So it would be fair for Culp to approach Gov to take over Pension..#2..WHY DID YOU SELL GE BIOPHARMA for $20Bn, fraction of its value, 4 times Revenue, growing l, Futuristic med, cure to decease, Cell Gen Therapy??. Biopharma, Cell Genome Techs are valued at 30--60 times Revenue, he'll most of them do not even have Revenue, has burning cash/loss business. GE BIOPHARMA GROWING Revenue was around $$5 BILLION, GROWING, CASH FLOW $$BILLION+... WHY Mr Culp, did you sell GE BIOPHARMA FOR FRACTION OF ITS TRUE VALUE..??Sad sad, UNFORTUNATE"
"GE will run up most of the day towards upper $13's may test $14 just before close, Lots of speculation regarding RS decision. Once reality sets in Tomorrow at the Shareholders Meeting and retail investors realize that every 8 shares they own, will become ""1"",.. Look out below!"
"I'm adding in pre market if GE is green, and I believe it will be. my guess is $ 14.50 by weeks end. people know this company is coming back."
Buy Baker at the height of oil then take your name off it at the bottom. SMH. Halve the WAB deal to shareholders. GE Healthcare was supposed to be sold off and distributed to shareholders completely. Culp killed that too. Bio Pharm sold to his old company at Corona time. Not sure how these guys think they are getting a deal with this nightmare. LOL. The dividend at 1c? Remember all in the name of the old debt. Pay up lifers.
When is GE reverse splitting?
jj & farmer checking every profile to see if they post on other stocks. LOL
"If people do a better job holding their shares, place higher limit orders when selling, and stop using “stop limits” the craziness like yesterday will subside. It’s just they love to sweep the price for cheap shares, before moving higher. You can’t blame them, it’s like taking candy... from babes..."
"$20 will happen within few months, book it."
GE will bounce right back and be over $15 within 2 weeks. Mark this post.
BKR = $26. Look in your portfolio and count how many BKR shares you see. I bet you see only GE.
Good job on earning Culp. The reverse split really iced the cake for shareholder what a punk
"All I can say is great job GE board and Culp. How to lose 20 billion in market cap within 3 days. The market speaks, and the reverse split is not good."
With travel demand increasing every day we could see $20 a share in the near future.
5 years ago a share of Microsoft cost $53 and paid a dividend of over $1.50. Today you can purchase Microsoft for $255 a share. GE seems to be on the same path of a 5 fold increase in 5 years.
Look like banks declare pandemic to be over...good for GE !! Will be interesting until Quarterly and beyond!! GLTA
"At least with your GE holding, you don't have to worry about capital gains."
"CNBC reporters lying right now about GE, saying that its down because investors wanted a better price on partnership deal. Not because of the 1 share for 8 reverse split. Complete Frauds and manipulation!"
great I buy more 10000 stocks. see you soon at 15 it's can also be today..................
HFT algo Sell Program at work... chip away a penny every 15-20 minutes...
don't believe the confessed shorts from this board.... Boeing is up green and usually GE follows..... also on our opinion the reverse split matter not let the CEO give the guidance..... 
Back to the $15 arena soon......
Love You GE!
"Come in guys i told you ... this is not a meme stock, can't go to fast up. of course will retreat..but is good for buying the dip. tomorrow morning."
JPM and GS already have the earning result. Longs are always the last to know
Great News for GE and those jet engines

CFM engines. Does anyone know what CFM is? smh at you pumpers.
I have been reading that AER management specifically the CEO is very good and skilled at making deals. The same is true of Culp. I’m interested in seeing the final product. I’m betting it’s good deal for both companies
"Long term were good, but will MM take it down like they usually do? With the market struggling, that's my guess, but for long term investors an opportunity"
"i never heard of a company with 116 billion market cap, 23.6 p/e ratio selling at 13 bucks. Something is not right here."

Culp came from Danaher. Pull a 5 year chart on Danaher. pull a 10 year chart. Why would anyone sell GE?

We will go back to $14
"watch the savvy investor buying up these cheap shares as the little, week investors dump for no reason. It’s dollar for dollar it means nothing and only people that know that are savvy investors. So what’s happening is exactly what GE wanted to happen. Add some more if interested and continue the ride up over the next few years."
GE will not see $14 till the earnings day. On that day it will forcefully cross it. Too many calls options been bought. Manipulation wants those calls to expire and be worthless as it have for the pass few weeks.
I am GE positive. $16 tomorrow????
Up we go 
this is going to go up sharply soon

"I dumped it. Not so much for the reverse split but if you value GE at 112 based on earnings projections I don't really see it going anywhere and there are better buys in the Space. Culp didn't wow anyone today and he probably #$%$ off a few. Reverse splits are like drinking Castor oil supposed to be good for you but yuck. I saw no reason to add to this, so goodbye for now. Maybe it sells off post split , I would take it at 80."
"GE is getting leaner and stronger due to reduction of its debt, and simpilifing businesses and accounting and getting rid of their health coverage. In doing so it could attract big investors like mr Buffet and more of the institutional investors......RS was badly announced, however, due to strong future and fundamentals GE will rise to new levels soon.....I am LONG and will stay invested for sometime....by the end of MAY when everyone is vaccinated and air traffic is high again...GE will be flying high as well...."
"Look at Culps compensation for last year. General Electric (NYSE:GE) CEO Larry Culp waived most of his salary and all of his bonus last year, but his total compensation still hit $73.2M, triple the prior year.But how is the stock performing now after investors day. How about giving back most of it since the stock price is barely changed since he took over. Culp is lining his pockets on the backs of GE shareholders. Retail investors are getting screwed by GEs current management. 8 for 1 reverse stock split, way to go."
Lidar going to be the play today. If you like making money that is.
Is GE a tech company ?
Options owners shake-out...
Good numbers still down
Breaking the 50 DMA convincingly.. Going much lower.. IMO..
got in around 6 as a long term investment. is it time to sell?
Any news on when the reverse split might take place?
"The YEAR of CULP, will jump stock over $20 after eps and forward statement ,of yah $75 billion in cash 1 week eps and statement"
I think you buy the dip here. GE could double over the next 12 months.
I just voted against the reverse split in my proxy vote. How are you voting? Long term holder here of GE and would like to protect my investment. Hope I am right.

TUSA and GE board 2 enemies of the company stock price.
@lewis; you go get em! What you are doing now is exactly how I created my substantial portfolio during the 80's.
This will double in no time.
"Some remarks to Tusa and his somewhat foggy remarks: GECAS had 2020 32 Ben USD external debt, which are eliminated by Culps deal. GECAS made 700 m losses in 2020. Insurance has no debt and made 160 m profits in 2020. The segment profits of 2021 could easily double, if Healthcare continues to be stable (which it almost was in 2020 to my surprise), Aviation catches 40% if 2019 business after a very difficult year 2020 and power/renewables improves (and GECAS losses disappear). All figures from GE 10k filing, which everybody can access. Tulsa’s language make things more unclear...if something is to criticize why to hide it with cloudy remarks which nobody understands ? GLTA"
I think they just proposed it so that the stock will crash and they can buy cheap. They probably aren’t going to do it
"BKNG did a 1:6, 17 years ago at $3.50.Guess what it is trading at today?"

"GE is shrinking everything. Selling business, Shrinking debt with sale of business, Shrinking shares with R/S the question is will the new GE emerge as a stronger more profitable and transparent company from all of this?"

$14 tomorrow
Tough day todayStill up from yesterday but would like to see a nice bounce tomorrow
I got out of GE right before the crash & massive cut of dividends. I lost money but it could of been worse. I've been eyeing it for some time to possibly go back in to it on a smaller scale. At the present price I'm wondering if it's to high at this time. When I was thinking about getting back in it was around $8+/- a share. For every positive article there seems to be two negative ones. The biggest problem is still it's debt.
march 10 ge goes to $15...buyers are waiting for good news and i think Wed. meeting will be just the thing needed to keep things going..$15 wed and $20 by sept
Boeing monthly aircraft orders outpace cancellations for first time since 2019. Good news for GE.
"GE is not even up 100% from March Virus lows, 2008 Crash lows. EVERYTHING, EVEN ALL G@RBAGES ARE UP 200%--500% to even 1000%.. Just remember the $5.48 lows was after virus March low $6.66, which was also 2008 lows $6.66.. Just reminding you guys.Thanks to JPM, Toosa for the opportunity to buy GE.. I have to open JPM account at some point for this opportunity and show my gratitude.."
nice close no drop last few mins....... GE 
"Actually, the ER doesn't concern me as much as that reverse stock split. I wonder how the vote went on that."
Forget the noise. Keep holding. Debt reduction is good. Look at other growth company. Their revenue is 1/10 - 1/20 and yet their market cap is over GE.
if boeing closes strong GE will close green
"Get Ready Baggies...to get even deeper in the RED than you already are from yesterday's closing price. Yes, as we all know- Baggies= GE Shorts. "
on the hedge funds list is GE the 7 it's real bullish.....all the ppl who are in the stock right now need to understand that we finish with Corona and earnings......s other stock is in a long sattle..because of that it's a red market..GE was today at 12.88 so now when it's by 13.12 in a time when the stock settle is a real bullish sign...whatever I believe that the next time this stock will goo over 14 is in one week next Friday......but only if its not come out really bad news or good....if you want to do a favor for you and for your wife/husband buy this stock...because it will go up
"The idea of ""Reverse Split Short Squeeze"" is terrifying to short sellers, so they spread as many lies and misinformation as possible to scare emotionally weak investors into selling."
Hour and half into the trading session and a 50 cent loss is the best Tusa can do lol? Can you say green by the close?
Tomorrow GE will be green and closes at more than 13.20
"The shorts are going to get their tail singed today. I wonder, how many of them actually believed what they wrote on this board? With Culp's credentials there's no doubt in my mind that this company is heading in the right direction. If he and the board believe the R/S will help do it, I'll go along and hang on to my shares."

"Goldman Sach and Morgan Stanley sold billions of dollars in stocks of Viacom, Discovery, Bidu, Tencent, and a few more last Friday. If we see GE rise this coming week, that could be a result of fund transfer from those companies to GE."
"What’s the talk on the stock reversal.Let me tell you this.8 to 1 is not a good number. Maybe 3 or max 4. And let’s see what happens from there. Larry need to take a pay cut and use the money to buy back some stocks.That is he doing that deserves or justifies that huge salary. GE is certainly not making money on profits, but making money on downsizing."
"Nice that the analysts are recognizing the strength of this dealBut on Monday, bullish analysts from UBS, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America came to the company's defense, extolling the merits of the Gecas deal and GE's cash position."
Let’s see $14 this week
"Assuming we rev split on today's price (not going to happen of course), the stock would trade at $112In order to short that, you'd need to have deep pockets to do so.Can happen. But would have been different if the stock was teetering around $5 and it rev splits to $40...Retail investors who short could drive it back down.At a higher price and multiples of 100, you've got to have quite a bit of cash.Things are definitely looking up for GE"
"If you think $14.00 is high, you can never get in again when it pops to above $15 tomorrow."
GE will “skyrocket” and close above $16 today!!! I hope and think it will so therefore it has to be true.
There are is a key bit of information out about this company that should add around a $100- to $200 dollars to General Electric's stock price pre- split. The info is in the link from $GE's own website and it has to do renewable combined with battery energy storage. They don't even advertise it and that kills me. The CEO Larry Culp needs one of those twit accounts to unvale all of the deep value within $GE instead of waiting months for a damn earnings call. The fool that works for JP Morgan is causing a lot of people to miss out on a lot of wealth that could be made investing in $GE. Here's the link and pass it on:https://www.ge.com/renewableenergy/hybrid/battery-energy-storage
Of course Tusa reiterated $5 . Is anyone listening ? Haha .. I am ready to buy more this morning !!
"one more time appreciate your comments on the annual meeting, agree with Culp and You 100%dont pay attention to weaklings comments even if they act under your namethe ones who can not separate your comments from their comments are the losers but they are allowed to exist and leave their life in the darkkeep up the great work, we need you"
"I am a BAGGIE, and LOVING IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!OMG !!!!, GE is down 3 cents......OMG, this is so terrible !!!!. Rick, were is 5.00 per share ?. HAHAHAHAHHA."
Told you Market was behaving in strange way today. Then reporting said Putin ordered troops back from Ukraine and the market tanked. BKR dropped GE.
SID has moved from $1 to $9 in one year. No RS contemplated.
"the problem with all big corporations, they setup what agenda to rewards the human(s) who are in charge. Not always benefits the company or investors (outside that circle) GE and CISCO used to be the love of US Congress and do well for decades. If anyone give you 600 million(s) to sell your thumb, I think many will."
"The drop in price is an overreaction and therefore a buying opportunity. The leasing company sale was a good move and should have taken the stock up a dollar per share. The reverse split is a bonehead move and should have cost about $.75 a share. It makes no sense to me. But, overall, the stock still should have rallied a bit on a net basis. The selling, this morning, is a knee jerk panic move by retail investors. Institutions should be buying hand over fist, now. I expect the stock to trade even by the end of the day or tomorrow.Good luck, longs."
RS is doing what it is supposed to do - stop the growth of GE stock until further notice.
Be careful of pump to 13.50 then dump. Wait till 13.65 as buy point IMHO.
I can see GE in $50 stage soon. I am hopeful and so excited. Forget about the bashers. Today is a successful day
"There are three kinds of pillars GE is relying on in forward performance and profits.First is the most likely to happen which includes getting Aviation FCF back to to $6.4 billion and $2.6 billion FCF for Medical.These two will at some time going forward give a combined of $9billion FCF.Second are the unknown 2 divisions of Recycleables and Power. Both have offered little FCF so far. At some point they have to turn into profit centers.Third are shedding the losing parts of GE. A lot of this is done like selling coal, shedding overhead, paying down debt, funding pension, and getting rid of GECAS and much of GE Capital.What the bet is Tuesday is how much of this has happened and the rest on how much and when it will happenAll eyes are on the Q1 results and the forward words from Culp's mouth.It is not a matter of ""if"".It is a matter of ""when""."
"I just voted my 2200 shares - AGAINST the reverse stock split as well. I agree with Albetross below; this will not influence the outcome. The reverse split will likely happen; however, maybe it sends some sort of message to Culp when the vast majority of retail investors vote against the board. Remember, historically speaking, reverse splits are a last act of desperation and I don't think GE is in its last act. a reverse split is like squashing a fly with a baseball bat."
$14 tomorow
"So glad I can watch now, w/o the stress of being invested."
Anyone know what price JJ shorted at today?

"This company has to be tied with Ford as the most mismanaged company's in the last 40 years. And they pay themselves hundreds of millions of dollars. It's a crime, and the government allows in the name of capitalism."
"Gene said 2hrs ago:Culp was crystal clear today4) all 4 divisions showing good steady growth in sales and in margins.5) says correctly rebuilding is a slow, slow careful process.6) the free cash flow for Renewables will be at least $3 billion by 20237) all GE parts are coming back - the company is showing nice progress8) as the pandemic gets reduced - Aviation is fast recovering9) worldwide pandemic vaccines are far from were it needs to be for full normalcy10) all the GE plants worked for the past 12 months daily during the pandemic11) his projections are minimums. They could go up significantly as time passes this year12) he is not focused on stock price - he is watching GE profits and progressCompare with my report 5 days ago: Revenue downTotal orders downEarning barely increasedEarnings from Industrials downRenewable energy segment barely performedPower segment performed poorlyAviation segment performed poorlyHealthcare performed poorly"
"Culp Good Admin, but is a dirty Agent of Bank trading desk, undermining GE Share price, helping MANIPULATE it. Since he came. Some of the steps he took clearly, mysteriously helped stop GE Price rise.. 1) Mysterious earnings change to hold back GE price rise.. 2) GE Biopharma ($4+bn revenue, $1+bn cash flow) sold for TOO CHEAP $22 Bn, similar co trading at $$100 BILLION or 20 to 50 times revenue.. 3) BKR Strongest, solid balance sheet, Oil serv business steady, sold for dirt cheap, at the Lowest dirt cheap, just keep it, don't need the $$100 BILLION CASH LIQUIDITY Sitting on.. 4) REVERSE SPLIT COMPLETLY UNNECESSARY. I do not mind either way, it market value, stock value still same rev split or not, price adj reflects same value of revenue earnings multiples, more importantly GE is turning a GROWTH STOCK with RENEWABLE.. 5) Why GE SITTING ON MOUNTAIN OF $$110+ BILLION CASH LIQUIDITY (around $30 billion cash abroad), and dif not buy back 2 billion shares when GE was below $10 ??.."
Getting in under $12 could be my best knife grab of the year
How do you like GE NOW...!!! SooooooooN 20.00+++ Buy GE...!!!

Sling free money out to those that will spend it ( hire people to dig holes and fill them again if necessary)Economics Professor Paul Krugman prefers No. three & I do also. Governments, with some exceptions, have finally started doing this. Wars and cold wars certainly exist but No. 3 is coming up strong and it's working. Can GE take advantage of all that money flying thru the air?"
My two limited orders at $13 and $13.25 got filled this morning. GE should be able withstand the bearish attacks. I am putting another limit order at $12.75 to buy. Good luck to all.
"The company said the timing of the reverse split will take place, at the board's discretion, before the one-year anniversary of its 2021 annual shareholder meeting scheduled for May 4. the board also announced earlier a ge share value of 31 to be achieved by culp,, only to be reduced dramatically later.so lets see."
Well it’s Friday and still the pps is below the high set a month ago on Analyst day when the RS was announced. Coincidence? I think not. Enjoy the weekend and your stagnant $13 pps
When is the split
CEO is on full tilt he is showing his hand
MANIPULATION
For those of you that bought more under $13 - smart. for those of you who sold calls at 14 or above into earning awesome- to bashers trying to make a dime on their out of the money puts - you lose 
Hundreds of millions for the CEO but company can't even earn a nickel a share
I would hate to be a short this week! Two catalysts at play. GECAS AerCap merger and COVID-19 relief bill.

I am losing over $7000 in stock value in the last 2 weeks. I am not happy about that. I am sure Larry culp isn't happy about his value losses either.
"$GE is a vital company for US economy and strategic national security. My lightbulbs are GE, my appliances are GE, the turbines in the local power plant are made by GE, the wind mills on every mountain wind tunnel are made by GE, the plains that fly in the sky have GE engines, the MRI machines and CT scan machines and other vital medical equipment are made by GE. Bottom line GE is a company that will not be allowed to fail. The RS may have been a bad idea that sucked the wind out of the stock momentum. But the company is vital and is her to stay."

Tusa was right. $4-5 is being generous. I have replaced 14 of 18 GE LED bulbs that only lasted approx 1 year. I'm sure the other 4 will fail any day now. Replaced with Phillips. NEVER BUYING another GE product EVER AGAIN.
Very little came over from growth tech to buy this. Volume shows that. What happens once this rotates back to tech growth? And it will of course. Think baby and bath water. buh bye
A more than 6 percent drop on big up day shows what investors think of this split. What are they thinking?
looks good GE
GE returned to middle term bullish pattern today. Tomorrow GE has shareholder meeting. Does Anybody expect any good news?
"And remember folks, .. Those of you who currently hold or purchase GE, every penny this company drops is actually eight cents lost post reverse split. Not a good look for your portfolio, be very cautious with this stock the risk reward ratio doesn't justify current price levels."
All the noise this morning about the sky falling... hope those that did happy dance for GE to go down didn't lose all their money today. .... ....
"From what I've read, this is a ""proposed"" RS. Based on the stock action, it doesn't look like current shareholders are very keen on the idea. I wonder if this will be factored into the ultimate decision. I hope so."
"The Real Growth Potential In General Electric is Wind Power Wind Power – The Real Secret is that General Electric leads the field.In 2020 the three wind turbine manufacturers ONLY generated 1/3rd of what the world will absolutely need added every year through 2030. Wind cost is now down to 4 cents per KW and that is very competitive.Or simply said: If General Electric sold $15 billion of RENEWABLES in 2020 – it will have to sell $45 billion of RENEWABLES by 2030 just to supply it’s 1/3rd of the demand (upcoming needs).It is not unreasonable to view the RENEWABLE division of GE as possibly selling $60 billion per year by 2030.Looking clearly at scale - It is more likely that General Electric will grow far faster than Vestas or Siemans. GE is 5 times larger in sales, has contacts in over 130 countries, manufactures and employs in numerous countries, has total access to unlimited working capital and can easily finance unlimited sales. It has incredible research and technology, and GE leads the field in OFFSHORE wind with its monster Haliade 13GW turbine. They are installing hundreds of them right now in New Jersey, Massachusettes, Turkey, England, Netherlands, Maryland and other places. The other two firms are projecting competitive turbines in 24 to 36 months - but so far it is all hype - not real. + + +WHO CAN SUPPLY?There are only 3 players - General Electric, Vestas, and Seimens.In 2020 the three companies installed ONLY 34GW (gigawatts) of wind power worldwide..General Electric – 13.5GW; Vestas 12.4GW; Siemens – 7.65GW Total of the three was 33.24GW But in 10 years the demand for wind will be for 200GW (gigawatts) TOTAL WIND POWER EACH YEAR ....The three firms must definitely add a cumulative total of 125GW NEW WIND POWER generated each year - triple or even quadruple what they are doing now.And profits will definitely follow. If there is a scarcity of manufacturing, the prices charged will move up.The profit spread will increase for all three firms. And it will be far above the 9% Vestas tried to produce in 2020. Think a lot more like 15%.+ + +So I know a lot of people are living for the Q1 2021 results in 2 weeks – but the real picture is Culp is playing a much longer game plan that just a quarter of numbers. His plan has to be to take RENEWABLES to a larger size than Aviation is in normal times. And as I showed you earlier, scarce products makes for higher returns. Don't think just of 9% or 15% net. It can be a lot more.And don’t forget the 20 year maintenance contracts with an additional 20% of built in net profits.That isn’t even figured into this."
"You know, thanks to GE lately, I think green might be my new favorite color. "
OMG People are flying again just checked TSA Data. almost 75% of the people are flying again. GE will Skyrocket by the end of the year.
Yes... Baggies= GE Shorts. Just look at GE chart from September 2020 to today for confirmation.
"Regarding RS...my initial thought was not good...but after reflection, I wonder now if it is actually a good move. If GE is doing this to get back into the DOW, won't funds/indexes that track the DOW have to buy GE stock? That would by HUGE buying pressure to get it into their portfolios. Am I missing something?"
I’m just here to see if JJ has made enough money so he can move out of his mothers basement. 
"Looks like the reverse stock split isn't catching on. Understandably so. Trying to make GE a $100 stock just doesn't make sense. Retail investors will be frightened away and priced out. Looks like GE just undid much of the good, it seemed to regain."
Buy GE going higher and higher
"DRYS in the making? The ceo economou sold the business part by part to somebody named economou, RS all investors out, then buy back the shell of the company. And it is all legal."
GE is a great stock makes money... it's going to pop up bigly.... any day .... meanwhile there's plenty of stocks to feast on..... GE. renewables
If they split the stock it will no longer be GE they may as well change the name too
See Boeing news
Stock will be $12 by EOW split that 8 times.
Tuesday morning GE will release earning. What price range will GE trade on Monday? I think it will trade between $13.4 to $13.85. It will be very bullish if it is able to trade above $13.85.Any thoughts?
I would appreciate some serious input from any T/A guys out there ... the 2 year chart has nowcompleted a C&H .... within that was low retesting a number of times and the whole thing looks very bullish ... garce
"Yep, GE is king of value with debt being cut drastically and the company's focus on core strengths over the past year. Now, every municipality in the world saw in Texas that more gas turbines are needed. Buy."
"The Year of the CULP, look for large M&A soon,Health growing rapidly"
"JJ SAYS ""i wish i could afford 2 shares of GE"". BUT he cant! Lets have a hardy HA HA HA TE HE! at JJ'S EXPENSE. AS I SAID BEFORE, he cant afford a real bideo game or used palm pilot, so this is how he passes his time."
More upgrades next week 14.00++ today if premature news surfaces...Buy GE... !!!
Share price manipulation as blatant as it comes.
"jj, tell us about how you blew your trading account 3 times with picks like $SRRA, $NKLA, short $GE."
"futures green,...."
"Ok, in the face of this late-day selloff, I just bought a lottery ticket. 25 $15 calls expiring Friday for 10 cents/optionshare."
Just hold guys. Slow and steady wins the race.
Let’s see when it breaks 14 again
Starting to heat up! $16 here we come!
"No matter how much upgrades and good news are coming out of GE. Its stock will not move for now. 2 reasons, first it’s been manipulated and 2nd it is intentionally being pushed down to convince investors of RS. I say NO to RS"
Just voted against reverse split.
first fib on todays move 13.33.
Question: Has GE sold all BKR shares? BKR was up over $1.20 and GE was in the red.
The worst is out no systemic issues with the businesses .. up from here
GE lots of good news
"VESTAS Wind Renewable $$250 BILLION Mkt Value, with $14.5 Billion Revenue. GE Wind Renewable ALONE $$20 BILLION REVENUE, Shouldnt GE RENEWABLE ALONE Add $$40 per share or $$300+ BILLION Mkt value, using same multiples as VESTAS Wind Renewable???Then there is GE AVIATION $30 BILLION REVENUE back on the way, then there is GE HEALTHCARE $20 BILLION REVENUE, then there is BKR $20 BILLION Rev ownership, then there is AERCAP $11 BILLION Revenue GE OWNES 46%."
Rite Aid did a 20-1 reverse split. Before split it would move 0.25 or 0.50 in a day. Now it moves at most $1 per day which is 0.05! At $20 Rite Aid looks expensive until you see that it is $ 1 pre split. It will take forever for it to get to some reasonable level. Dont like reverse splits.
"I suppose with GE being much higher from its 52WK low, that the shorts feel obligated to scream and shout as reality enters their thoughts.This turnaround is happening... "
"No April Fools joke here...""We have greater confidence in General Electric's path to recovery, and the company's deleveraging efforts have progressed further than we initially expected,"" Morningstar analyst Joshua Aguilar wrote April 1."""
"My clown activity indicator works well. For example, it pegged the two bottoms the past few years, when clown activity was at an ATH."
These insane compensation packages have ruined many companies.
AND AGAIN!!! Where's the Zacks article about GE beating the market 11.2X today? They printed nothing... but when GE is down they have diarrhea of the mouth! Zacks is a BS news letter of zero substance. You will actually lose intelligence by reading into a Zacks article. News flash... Zacks is not worth the stuff that you wipe into toilet paper! Zacks = lost brain matter.
You guys wanna great reverse split? Check out RAD 1.37 billion market cap with 23 billion in revenue. They shorted to Bk levels and was actually turning around before covid. Rite Aide will be $ 40.00 by the years end if not by earnings.
This isn't going to make one bit of difference in what the the company is actually worth. But it's killing the price of the stock.
"PPS now looks like an options battle for the rest of the week IMO. Boeing earnings, orders, forward guidance in the morning could make a difference in which direction. I’m guessing the battle will be more so with the 13.5’s & 14’s as opposed to the 13’s & 13.5’s. Plenty of open interest for a fireworks show. GLTA"
jj I do watch moc. today it caught my eye via my brokerage. I should be watching it closer. Heck institutions trade a lot on moc.
culp has over 15 mill shares he's down 30 mill plus in 2 days...
How much GE will save on interest by reducing its debt by 30 Billions ? Now they can increase the dividends .
"under 13.75 will only last for maybe a day, even todays close and after hours will find Buyers"
"In my opinion, getting in under $20 is good now. I see this hitting $30 by EOY"
"yahoo another increase by 8 cents 14.50 current target. lol still in the right direction.for patient investors ge should be moving higher as commercial travel picks up, so far gaining slowly.culp has a chance on the 4th to share with investors what he is working on to give ge a boost."
Don't Worry... Be Happy!And remember: GE Shorts= Baggies! 
Chart pattern looks great! We’re still going to 18
"If you cant hold a GE stock and sleep well long term, stock market is not for you"
That was a quote. She said it. We must spread wealth more than pinnacle it if America is to succeed.
For 8 shares GE = $106.40 up 0.72Seems about right until revenue growth.
"I see the logic of GE selling AerCap the GECAS portfolio for $26 billion in cash to pay down debt - but perhaps the $24billion debt is really all or most of of GECAS and GE Capital debt ..Then all the deal would be worth is the 46% of the AerCap ownership. That would be a lot more similar to a 50-50 merger with AerCap being the survivor.Or perhaps the deal includes GE feeding AerCap new business when GE needs to finance an airplane engine.If Culp really sold Biopharma for $21 billion with no strings attached, and if Culp sold GECAS for $24 billion and retained 46 % ownership with no strings attached - then he sold a $3 billion Biopharma yearly sales and a $5 billion GECAS yearly sales for only a total of around $8 billion yearly sales for a payment of about $45 billion (21 + 24 billion = $45 bilion) .and the rest of the empire (airplane, renewables, health, power) is still whole.That would be a very swift deal in my opinion.The only problem is we do not know what was included in the deal and GE may have some strings attached to take the sweetener out of the actual deal."
When do we see the reverse split?
Strong companies do forward splits $TSLA and bad companies do R/S GECatching on
when the reverse split takes placeearnings per share increases 8xdividend increases 8xthese are just two of the automatic increases
"1 share for every 8 RS is not good, its bad! The reason its so bad, is because after GE reduces the float to just over a billion, they will then begin to issue new shares to company execs and employees exercising stock options, or by issuance or conversion of convertible bonds, preferred shares or warrants into stock. This Dilutes the company value for all that held before after the RS, but creates great wealth for insiders."
looks good ... wind power GE... key word electric.... air travel engines.... what's not to like......
"Unless you have your head buried in the sand, you know this will range trade until RS happens. All those upgrades? Hopefully they are not meant to be after RS. But you never know, do you? Tusa and I agree on the $5 target, which translates to $40 after RS."
"I’ve never met this Tusa guy. I’ve never seen this Tusa character, however his constant bashing of GE is getting on my nerves. I propose a charity boxing event. Me vs this Tusa jerk. Oh, and I never lose. Who would like to see that?"
"Dow up .10% GE up .27% ...almost 3X... GE looking very good! Sorry Baggies no $0 or even $12 today. Please try harder, your not getting it down.BTW... Don't forget, Baggies= GE Shorts. "
"Exactly how i predicted, now tomorrow and Monday first part of the day are growth day"
that dip was a sale price back up ten cents . 
"Just stumped at 13.14-13.20...any uptick, will trigger exit sells?...or investors still trying to figure out this aviation merger.BASICALLY, we gave up the revenue from aviation recovery in the next several years for $26 billion to paydown current debt."
If only you who sold last week listened. Congrats to all longs. Double your investment this year
Remember to vote no on reverse 1 - 8 split.
Will the stock price be okay tomorrow?
"Travel surged this week, 1,850,00 Sunday and 1,734,000 yesterday. It is only a matter of time before the market catches on.Buy now, because GE is going up with or without the worst leader in history."
Now I know why they raised the share price target....or was it lowered after the R/S? In any case.....
"$GE stock is getting stronger, it will be one of the greatest comebacks in the history of the US stock market. Leaner, stronger, more efficient and more profitable! $GE to the $20's this!"
"Does anyone know if GE is still planning to do the reverse split? If so, when?"
"JPM, Culp swipped around $$100 BILLION from GE SHAREHOLDERS: GE BIOPHARMA SOLD (4 times Rev) FOR $$70+ BILLION CHEAPER/Discount to its competitors in Cell Gean, Genomic field. Similar stocks selling for 30-60 times Revenue, and they are losing huge money. GE PHARMA Was already $$BILLION CASH FLOW POSITIVE.. GE.BKR Sold for so cheap at $12+, amounting to around $15Bn discount, more as time goes.. Then approximately $$30 BILLION of $$45 BILLION GE BUY BACK 2016-2017.. All total, JPM Culp swiped out GE Shareholders Asseta values, money that cleans up assets divisions to clearly making profits. Then comes Wllst Banks Tricks, false NEGATIVE narratives through all media mouthpieces to shake and swipe $$$BILLIONS from GE. This time it amounted to near $$$120 some BILLIONS.. These benefits could hv been paid to Shareholders as Spin offs, Dividends etc... This is how Banks make $$$BILLIONS out of GE instead of SHAREHOLDERS getting it. This cycle repeats as GE AGAIN BUILDS VALUES, CLEAN ASSETS, AND Wllst Banks JPM repeats T00sa drama all over again every 10 to 20 years.."
GE I believe will stay at a solid $14 and above from this day going forward. This company has no place to go but UP as long as MR. Culp is navigating this company. Just about anyone can fly a plane (GE) but not everyone can navigate. I've seen too many people that can do one but not the latter and at this point in time GE has one who can do both. So sit down strap in and all you nay sayers be quite and watch us looooongs ride this diamond to the moon and beyond. IMHO of course. GLTA especially the loooongs.
"what vote did was create a degree of uncertainty to stock. it's a nonbinding vote. We still do not know about reverse split, or the dividend."

Feel lucky the nasdaq is up 255 points so far. If it was in the red this stock would be below 10 easy.
Big Mouth CEO don't have much to say this week
"serious investors pay no heed to the suggested RS ..... that kind of clouded some other points of interest in the health of GE .... from Barrons :General Electric asked investors to do some difficult math last week about its balance sheet and accounting, and the investors balked. Shares fell as shareholders digested a lot of news related to complicated debt actions, asset sales, and accounting consolidations. In the end, the outcome—less debt is a good thing, but the one thing that investors hate is confusion.The only problem anyone had with GE back in Welch days was the structure and accounting , too baffling for most analysts and they only looked at what Welch wanted them to see bigger revs andbigger earnings ... while camoflaging liabilities .. garce"
"I repeat the idea of ""Reverse Split Short Squeeze"" is terrifying to the shorts, so they spread as much misinformation as possible to scare uniformed investors into selling. $BKNG is an example of a reverse split that has been successful. $GE will be successful also."

GE doesn’t want to be another AT&T.......GE wants to be another Danaher. You should be buying this dip.
How disappointing this has become...Things were looking really bright just a few days ago.
MMs took it down today. The news lets them back in at a better price.
Big news: south west airlines is going to make a big purchase 737 max which uses GE engines. The news released after hours.
Come on 73 million. Mr. Culp you should be ashamed at yourself for even taking that kind of money. No person is worth that much per year. This is the very problem we have in the good old USA - Greed. GE certainly is not performing at that kind of compensation.If you want to delete my comment you are with this kind of behavior.Also this entire board should be fired to let this happen.Proof of scratch my back and I’ll reword you all.

"GE will release earnings next week. The first quarter normally is the weakest quarter of a year, however I predict it will be better than Expected due to the conservative outlook of the management. I am buying more shares this week. This week could be last week for GE to trade under $13. Thus, it might be the last chance to accumulate under $13. I have placed another limited order to buy under $12.75 to see it will be filled this week."
hahahahahaha GE is going to shrink shares that mean you lose shares. Value could be drop over time. Thanks God I got out this crabs when I bought it $6 a shares
JJ...Thanks for your valued post...great humor....you state that you shorted an add'l 330680 shares today. Keep up your valued humor

"After reading and analyzing, here is my take on earnings:Revenue downTotal orders downEarning barely increased Earnings from Industrials downRenewable energy segment barely performedPower segment performed poorly Aviation segment performed poorlyHealthcare performed poorly"
Let Culp support the stock and all his good friends @ JPM
"Nice climb after hours tooI would love to see a steady climb next week to above 14 based on FUNDAMENTALS and positive improvements in debt, new deals, more jets being sold."
dragonthe 2015 Alston buy cost ge $15 billion under Jeff immelt leadership.ironically part of Alstom was some wind turbine manufacturing that in the end may actually be huge plus for ge going forward.I think it was lm winds in that deal making the wind turbines blades.now lm winds is hidden gem owned by ge and critical to their newer design and increased production needs of next generation wind turbines fiberglass blades.
Is GE currently trading at 20.6% discounted value as some analysis indicates? I strongly believe so.
Imagine what the shorts will do to a GE stock of 105.00 with a major market correction... smart move Culp.. lmao

"Historically reverse splits do not end well. GE a $100 stock? I do not see any basis for it. There would certainly be so, so many stocks that would be a better investment at that price. They are selling off everything of value. What's next? Aircraft engine is still vastly effected by COVID and who knows how long before people will be comfortable flying even if they get this virus under control. GE Power is still not turning a profit. The Renewables face stiff competition. And Medical doesn't make a lot of money for the company. Barron's had a article on four reasons why the stock is down and said ""None of them are Good"". S&P may lower their credit rating. And cash flow though somewhat improved is still seems to be an issue. The glimmer of hope that occurred as the stock rose from the five dollar range to a little over 14 dollars, I think has lost it shine. Sad for a company that once was such an icon."
8bn shares on float??????? Not bad
I smell shorts burning 
closing over $14
"I LOVE GE !. why are the shorts even here > I dont get it, there are plenty of stocks for JJ to short other that this BULL GE, JJ is losing money, hahahaha"
2.5% drop with a quarter of the daily trading volume!HFT algo controlled Casino!
GE is negative again because of reverse split. Remember to vote against the Reverse 1 - 8 split!!!!
jj how are you
"Stop bashing and buy GE you know you want to, so move to another stock to bash. When was the last time you built something either transport, medical or power, so think about moving on....Buy GE...!!!"
"I'm so smart. Bought in months ago at $6.90...sold at $9. Nice return, for an idiot. GE will make steady progress under Culp's leadership for the next several years. Nothing spectacular, but a resurrection none the less for a company most everyone thought was dead (yeah, me too)."
Chart today looking great...solidly rising since 11:00 am...at this rate we may get green  soon.
"Why to buy GE? I completely agree what said in the Q1 2021 investor letter of Longleaf Partners Fund. The letter highlighted a few stocks and General Electric Co (NYSE:GE) is one of them. Here is what the fund said:""General Electric (GE) (22%, 1.50%), the revitalized Aviation, Healthcare and Power conglomerate, was a top contributor following on its strong 4Q 2020 performance. Fourth-quarter Healthcare results were excellent, with revenues up 6% year-over-year (YoY), operating margins up 3% to 20% and strong FCF conversion. The Power and Renewables segment improved margins due to strength from gas plant services. With flight traffic increasing, Aviation appears likely to begin a multi-year recovery in the second half of this year. GE also swapped its aircraft leasing operations to AerCap for a 46% stake in the combined company, intelligently wrapping up its previously troubled GE Capital financing operations and further decreasing overall leverage. We continue to be impressed by the turnaround work of CEO Larry Culp, and the stock remains discounted against the quality of the three core business segments.”"
"BUYING OPPORTUNITY! Nothing has changed with respect to this company's prospects. At the end of the day, you either believe what management is doing or you don't. If not, get lost. We don't need ya! I think it was good timing from a momentum perspective to announce - right after many upgrades from Wall Street and the GECAS deal which will help reduce their debt and put them in a better position. This is a strategic move to keep the company in more stable hands. I'm in."
"gene, why is GE the only stock you comment on? Is it the only one you own? What is your relationship with GE?"
Beware the dead cat bounce. Those 13 call options look sweet once again!
"GE may be trading at discount at its current share price.I am not against foreign companies but I certainly appreciate American companies that have the potential to impact our lives here at home in a good way.IMO we need a more diversified, efficient power grid that incorporates renewable energy such as WIND & SOLAR. This is GE, a world leader in renewable energy that combines wind, blades, hydro, storage, utility-scale solar, and grid solutions as well as hybrid renewable energy and digital services offerings.Not only do I think GE is a viable monetary investment but GE is an investment in our collective future that will help secure our energy needs for our grandchildren.The world is hyper competitive and we need to solidify our place in the energy ecosystem. GE is ready for that challenge. We have to be forward thinking.Also, GE puts people to work w/over 200 thousand jobs worldwide in 170 countries. GE partners with thousands of other American businesses. In short, the cumulative positive effect of a company like GE on the American economy is enormous.I am behind GE because I think it is deserving and in the midst of an exciting turnaround story due to reduced debt, a more streamlined business model, & strong management.Hopefully, GE's earnings news is indicative of good things to come long term, and GE shareholders can make be rewarded.Best to all."
"Free cash flow for the first quarter was $845 million, shy of the $1.5 billion Street forecast."

I guess GE no longer wants retail stock holders. Reverse split of 8 to 1 is very bad for retail stock holders! Bad news !
I'm out in all my accounts. I bought this stock when it was $25 something (2013) I added to average down when it was $6 got out of one account with profit and a lost on the other. If I would of sold everything yesterday I would of been even in that account. Good luck everybody I didn't want to wait to see what happens after the split. Sad for such an iconic company. Will buy back in after the dust settles. I like the CEO. He has a good track record. GE is just too broken created by Immelt?
"Very sad day for GE. Yes a correction is coming. Stock split too steep.Could have been a better number. It’s going to take years for GE to recover at this rate. Big money players will win out leaving the small guy out.I’m hoping you all get what you wanted, being compared to other companies is not a good thing. GE has so much to offer. Talk to me in 5 years, maybe it will rebound."
Write in proxy vote for Immelt. He is at least better than any current BODs.
I don't expect a thing out of GE going forward but pain
$14 by Thursday if not sooner!! So all the LONGS climb aboard the GE (Party) Express. IMHO :-)
"My prediction. JJ will say he shorted at today's high, currently 13.44 (or whatever the high will be), and then he will say he covered at the low, currently 13.17 (or whatever the low will be). Hahahaha, he is so funny any predictable."
Bought 58000 more total amount 720000. Nothing wrong with the company it will go up in a week.
GE must have shocked the market with the RS announcement. Investors are taking a little bit of the top and waiting on the side line like me to see what CEOs are up to. I like companies that forward split.
I just bought some more for the marathon race.Sorry you sprinters are short and don't have the stamina for this one...
I just purchase $100 worth of GE at 13.45 and for around 7 and a half shares but I’m kinda worried about it it was my first big purchase what do you guys think
Point is GE supplies or will supply industrial equipment either directly or through all the new Electric/Renewable companies and all the legacy companies transitioning to these new business models. Who would not want to own a company in that position? ...
BAGGIES right now being defeated. Shorts win again. I can't wait for Tusas comments and the big boys unloading. 11s?
"Everyone vote against the reverse split. Reverse splits rarely work. This is what will happen if the reverse split happened tomorrow for example. GE will open at around 96 per share. Then a down day in the market will see GE drop to around 89 per share. Then GE will issue stock options offering increasing their share count and rewarding mgmt and their board and GE will drop to 79 per share. Then you will see the crooked hedge funds come in to short GE. The crooks will issue fake stories and eventually you will see GE back to 12 per share. Vote against any reverse split. Contact the SEC and report the board and mgt. GE had momentum, there is absolutely no reason for a reverse split."
With the good news just announced I feel a nice Green Day for GE and if market cooperates too we should see a min $2 move upward. Good luck to all
"GE RENEWABLE WIND Revenue $19 BILLION, Will surpass GE AVIATION CROWN-JEWELs $$30 BILLION Rev, and $10 BILLION Profit projected before pandemic"

"While the reverse split announcement was a surprise, I understand the logic. This will likely result in less day trading (eg. less volatility) of GE shares and likely less shareholders over time as well. In the end, splits are nothing but noise long term and company will be valued on the company's fundamentals. As for the Aercap deal, rock solid in my opinion. GE gets $26B in cash while continuing to own 46% of the combined company. I like it the deal. All told, I'll be holding my shares."
Can't think of many risk free energy/clean tech stocks covering so many sectors with a non-rich valuation. Buying while it's still relatively cheap.
Things are looking up for GE. All you have to do is look at the chart upside down.
Ge 15 coming
"How many longs can answer when the last reverse split of GE was, and the ratio. Just curious how many out there actually know what they are talking about."
Ed Garden is one of 11 members of GE board. He is also chief investment officer for Trian fund management that in 2015 had majority of their investments in GE. Think about that for a bit. Yikes!

Reverse Split will solve all GE problems but 1. Earning money
"I heard in this conversation GE want to spilt reverse is to pump up the stock price - it make sense that give bonus to the CEO and alike, and at the same time, knocked down the small investors and HOPEFULL go big for the big investors like AMAZON, Warren Buffet alike. As far as GE long term and cash flow - I think is very positive, it is just not for the folks here to mess with, soon if GE did, you will not hear anything from the SHORT to f the LONG, and the LONG F at the SHORT, because whether you are LONG or SHORT, you are not going to the hole."

I don't care. I made some nice money off the lows on this stock and will now find something that offers a better upside and/or a nice yield. GE is a long way off from that now.
Street now ignoring Tusa. Lone fire crier at this point. Buy.
"About to adventure in Montana, sailing 10 days on my boat."
"Two people asked me clarification questions:Daniel, Washington Air Brake (WAB )sales were 3.9 billion and GE Locomotive sales were $4.2 billion in 2018 when John Flaherty made a snap decision to sell them. Profit was ok and GE got $2.9 billion. Not a bad deal and certainly in hindsight maybe good or maybe it could or should have been averted since these were two very good performers.That sale was not done under Jeff Immelt's prior management and frankly in 2018 General Electric was in intensive care and anything to help their disasterous losses would have been better.I try not to say ALL OR NONE because there are exceptions. The above was a profitable GE division - but very small."
If you buy today at 13.18 in the year 2037 it will be worth 13.18
"this reminds me of bsx years ago. stock was a dog for quite a while and bottomed out around 5 until they could get themselves straightened out. these turnarounds have their ups and downs as management tries to clean up the past. the company has cut lots of costs out of the system, paid down a chunk of debt and parts of the business, i.e. aviation, should start to see better numbers going forward as air travel continues to improve. any growth will drop to the bottom line. look what culp did for danaher and if he can keep ge going in the right direction, especially if they start to roll in any acquisitions or continue to cut out certain areas, this stock should continue to move up over the next few years."
It's feeding time for us longs again...
I want another double!! Thinking Mr Culp will get his massive bonus at about $16.75 so I guess $8.50 would be the next buy for me.

"RS ...........GE is seeking shareholder approval for the move at its coming annual meeting on May 4.

Gotta admit I feel great owning an iconic company like GE
"Actually GE didn't tank, actually thought midday it would stay at $13., certainly a little disappointed. Buy windfarms, air travel, etc. we bought in the many dips, still love GE.  And if you shorted today congrats enjoy the profits."
The GE reverse split will reduce day trading and stabilize the the stock price so any change will be company financial performance driven. This has been a long time coming.
"This guy ""Ed Garden"" is not giving investors what they want to hear. He's double talking and dogging the only subject that retail investors want to know about. And the reporter on CNBC is just soft balling him easy questions. Total bull!! Reverse your decision to a 1 for 8 reverse split!!!"

"Guillermo here: the reverse split is RECOMMENDED by the board, it is NOT a DONE DEAL, it must be voted. Guillermo asks everyone to write to GE investors relations/CEO advising AGAINST the reverse split. It will not happen. Conspiracy theory?

Thumbs up this post and let's get to $20 before June 1st.Stay greedy my friends!"

Reverse split sends GE to 105.00. Shorts drive it down to 70.00. Market collapse drives it to 40.00. Good luck Dopes....

we don't think the reverse split matters. people are buying GE.

I have been praying for years for something good to happen to GE. Now all chatter is about hundreds of millions of dollars for the CEO and il-advised stock split. This won't end well
Big example of the future. GE had no big sell off .... probably a good indicator that earnings will be good.. especially nice to close with an up swing.... more tomorrow 
I have waited for two weeks now for just 1 soul to come up with a single reason why GE should be higher PPS than it is now.

"Reverse stock split doesn’t change anything really, just like exchanging 10 one dollar bills for a $10 bill. Much ado about nothing. GE is doing great things in aerospace and energy and we are all making money with this company as it motors on."

"I expect GE to run up a bite till Mondays close in anticipation of Tuesday the 4th Shareholders meeting. The future of the price of this stock hinges on the ""Reverse Split"" decision. This could close today just below $14 hard ceiling. Profit taking across the board in the overall markets, and ""Powell"" could hold GE down. I'm positioned accordingly, do your research and invest wisely! -Cheers"
"Barron’s: The reverse stock split might be the fourth reason. GE announced plans to give investors one new share for every eight they hold. Reverse splits can make investors nervous by signaling the business outlook isn’t good. That doesn’t appear to be the case, though.“One of the things I came to appreciate at GE is we have a share count that puts us out of reach of any peer or competitor,” CEO Larry Culp tells Barron’s. “It’s nothing more than cleaning up an excessively large share count.”"
Ok for CEO to squeeze something extra out for himself while standing on shareholders neck
Would love to see Ge rally into positive territoryDisappointing considering the market is up so high

"Last Year Q2 earnings were ( .15 ). That was right after Covid started, so the number is no doubt heavily influenced by that event. Looks like they are hoping for 4 cents a share this year. If the R/S is sooner than later it will appear to be 32 cents a share. I can only imagine it would be sooner or they wouldn't have dreamed up this magnificent plan. With the 440M uninstitutionalized shares out there post R/S, and a 13M short, this may have some swings similar to TSLA where it goes up or down 20-30 a day. By declaring seemingly high earnings(8 times what we are used to), or losses with the same correlation the next few month can get very interestong."

EBITDA 2019 was close to 15 billion USD, whilst in 2020 it was close to 8 billion USD. In other words: EBITDA in 2021 will be more than double the EBITDA of 2020.Think, EPS of 1 USD is in sight (before RS obviously) or 8 USD per share (after the RS). With a multiple of 20, we will see share price of 20 USD rather sooner than later !!"

"shorts are trying their hardest to paint a negative picture....sure sign of panic as they need to cover their positions....i have time and can wait, they can't - sorry shorts. Good luck next time."
Tusa true to color lol. Buy the dipper. Going higher.
"This will be the last time to sell in the $13's until after the RS! This is going down to pre-recovery levels the retail investor isn't as gullible as GE Management thinks, they're not going to be left holding the bag any longer. As for the big institutional investors the RS is designed to attract, they will wait to accumulate share at a much lower valuation."
"Had there not been a reverse split announcement, we would have just done a deal that erases a massive amount of debt, and still allows for upside as aviation recovers. And it sounded like there is already an agreement in place for GE to exit.We would have another massive deal of 737’s being sold, and two huge upside days in the market. GE would likely be trading over 15 a shareAs irrational as I think it is, the RS has essentially erased 20%. Frustrating because even positive news is having zero impact Boeing sells a bunch of jets, their stock increases and GE slides on the RS.Brutal."

"All the pumpers say is it's going to the moon and it will be 20 by years end and all that. But they never say how or why. Has anyone else noticed? It leaves me with the same puzzled look on my face that the German Field Marshalls and Generals in Hitler's headquarters had in late 1944 when he told them the war would certainly be won. Like the pumpers here, the divisions supposedly needed to win simply didn't exist anymore, as do pumpers explanations how and why when you ask them. They simply do not exist."
"All eyes now on the earnings. If not satisfactory, all small investors should say good bye and find themselves another yet better investment than GE. The only way RS may be stopped is first through shareholders opposition and second if GE stock advances over $20 by Next month when the board meets to decide. If RS happens most likely the short interest will spike causing further problems for GE."
"Good morning Jimmy! Just a correction concerning your claim yesterday that GE owns CNBC. In 2009, Comcast purchased a 51% stake in NBC which is the parent company of CNBC. In 2013 they purchased they remaining 49% and are still the sole owner."

"Recently Daniel told me CFM made more jet engines than GE. Not true....I thought it would be helpful to give him and others the actual background.In 1970 representatives of Safron (France) visited GE in Boston and had drinks at the Ritz Carlton.They said 'Lets get together and develop a new turbofan engine in the 20,000 pound thrust class to compete in the new developing jet liner industry.""GE had the technology and manufacturing in the deal. The production was set up in Cincinatti.It took 4 years, a lot of France and US government involvement for and against the partnership - but the deal finalized in 1974.By 1985 the fully developed engine had become so powerful that the engine was the best in the industry -powering over time the McDonald Douglas DC-8, Boeing KC135, Boeing 737, and Airbus A320. The very successful partnership lasted for the next 36 years. The deal was set to expire in 2012.In 2008 the partnership was extended until 2040. Pratt and Whitney was the main competitor. Rolls was a distant third. Neither could really compete. Pratt had 23% market share and Rolls 12%. GE had and still has 66% market share. I think it will actually grow more with the new GE 9X engine. The newest GE 9X engine has just been certified worldwide in December. It will be even more efficient (at least 10% less fuel and better design) and is coming on production soon. That is not a CFM product - just GE.The CFM partnership developed the LEAP engine, which originally had no users yet. Over time it became a very successful engine. CFM has delivered 30,700 engines to 570 different operators. For example, in 209 CFM delivered 2127 engines, of which 1736 were LEAP. 123 engines were CFM56's. The LEAP engine is recognized as the most reliable in the industry. The service turn around time between flights is 25 minutes. The engine reliability is 99.98% safe. The LEAP engine is the backbone of both the Boeing and Airbus fleets. The only serious attempt to copy was China, but they gave up and buy from CFM engines now. The demand is so strong that, for example, in February Scandinavian Airways bought 35 Airbus A320's with all the engines being LEAP. That order was for $2.9 billion, and a goodly part of that was for the jet engines. (I have heard it can be 1/3rd of the plane price - not sure).This is part of why I say on the board that GE is an ESSENTIAL SUPPLIER to the airlines. Lacking GE the airlines would have to fall back on Pratt and Pratt has less thrust (under 20,000 ponds today for GE, less reliability, and is losing market share (GE has made serious inroads to Airbus this past year)."

"@daniel, good ready. I do believe Culp will RS split dividend & to make it on par with current dividend making Mr Culp look like a hero."
We will know by the May 4 meeting if the board makes the spilt or not. The spilt can occur at anytime until may 4.
Renewable sector is the most promising regarding GE' growth.US off shore wind + developed & developing countries needs for joint venture or turbine demand is growing rapidly. The hydrogen made from renewable power supply will massively bring on energy transition.

"A corporation can decrease the number of its publicly held shares through a reverse split. The board of directors does not need to get stockholder approval to authorize a reverse split. The board selects the reverse split ratio, such as issuing one share for every 10 shares owned, and announces the date the split takes effect. Whether this helps or hurts your stock portfolio depends on the company’s reason behind the split.TipA reverse stock split may result in a loss of shares for minority shareholders. Unfortunately, these individuals have little legal recourse if such an act occurs."
"A reverse split is good for GE, and will erase bad memories of short sales trying to tank this stock. I see 15.00+++ before the split.....Buy Buy Buy GE......!!!"

"Right after short interest increased on $GE's stock, the short employed by JP Morgan comes out with disinformation on $GE. To me it's just a pathetic attempt to drag down the stock. What I see is actually good information that I didn't know about the company, especially with aviation recovering."
GE has had dozens of good news being released and has got a half dozen of upgrades. On top of that the market has been exploding and keep climbing as we speak however our 120 year old baby been struggling to pass beyond $13. A pattern of 25 cents gain at the open and fade away by the closing bell has dominated for the past 4 months to where it’s been boring for most investors. The news of RS has pushed most investors interest away and on hold. No matter what type of good news this baby will not go forward in price till the RS dust settles. Bottom line no short term gains expected. Think Long terms with a hope the inflation and explosion of the stock market bubble does not happen. Good luck to you all longs
This obviously will not be a day for rebound...stuck around low $13....any uptick will trigger selling
Always thought an investor's day would be a positive outlook on the company. Never have seen an investor's day result in a 10% decline in the stock price. But again it is GE.
"Larry may be correct about the number of shares float. Looking at similar companies most have less than a billion shares float. Boeing as an example has only 583 million shares. By doing an RS 8:1 reduces the number of shares in GE to 1.1 billion and the share price will be around $100. On the other hand, Microsoft has 8 billion shares and that has not increased volatility nor has it stopped the rise in the share price. In other words, there is a strong argument for either the pro or anti RS action. I am against a reverse split and will vote no. The market has the same sentiment."
"Did anybody check US government released TSA travel numbers? It has reached almost 80% prior COVID-19 number, 15 times better than the same time of last year.

"I now think GE truley has a smart CEO, pay off debts, reverse spilt stock so mature investors will invest to avoid robinhood and game store, right now the stocks is too low, until the shre become more expensive to buy and manulipate 1-8, the CEO smart, leaseing aircraft make cash but pandemic will make travel less likely to get quick cash fast. Good move."
Oh no! Don’t tell me that GE will be $15 on Friday! Can it really move up 10% in 5 trading days?
Many here post with good information and JJ posts what he dreams about with zero information. Just an observation from a happy GE holder that has more then a double going.
The GE share price needs to gain $.33 today to close where it was last Friday COB. Good start so far.
"One more thing, before a reverse split the stock will be 15.00+++++ and the company knows this will happen to make GE back to the DOW again. Buy Buy Buy GE.....!!!!!"
GE - Embarrassing right. Larry is over rated. He needs to GO. Don't get caught up in rationalizing why it is down....he is failing....maybe he needs to mine crypto or something like Elon to add value to the company but for now he is failing and at 72 million he is not worth it. Boolean
"RAD is another example of reverse split failure. On 4/22/19 RAD had a 20:1 at a price of about $.54 resulting in a post-split price of $10.80. Today RAD is at $20.30. Most pre-split stockholders cost-basis was well over $.54, so over 2 years later pre-split stockholders have recovered about $.50 for a $10 increase in RAD stock price. Once again, new post-split stock owners have done fairly well, but pre-split stockholders will wait a long time, perhaps many years to recover assuming one stays with the stock."
Stock doubled in like 5 months. I guess CEO work is done. reverse split will ensure it never gain a dollar EVER

"Read the just released Global Wind Report 2021 and think of GE Renewables:Here is the summary of their findings:""The global wind industry installed a record 93 GW of new capacity in 2020 – a 53% year-on-year increase, showing strong resilience in the face of COVID-19.""""Total global wind power capacity is now up to 743 GW, helping the world to avoid over 1.1 billion tonnes of CO2 annually – equivalent to the annual carbon emissions of South America.""""The world needs to be installing a minimum of 180 GW of new wind energy every single year to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, meaning that the industry and policymakers need to act fast to accelerate deployment.""""Governments across the world must take a 'climate emergency' approach to eliminate red tape and planning delays and expand grid infrastructure to further scale-up wind power at the pace required.""""Wind power is a cornerstone of achieving net zero and powering a green recovery as a cost-competitive, resilient power source with the most decarbonisation potential per MW.

"From the trading pattern today, we can see bears and bulls are fighting very hard. It is good to see the bears was not able to breakdown the $13. Thus, GE’s technical bullish pattern is still intact. GE will trade between $13 and $13.5 near future. Be patient."
"Despite the occasional success story, reverse splits aren't usually a good sign for a stock. Still, they don't have to be a death knell, either. Because reverse stock splits have no fundamental impact on a company, it's more important to look at the financial health of a stock to assess whether a reverse split is likely to work in the long run."
when will be the reverse split 1:8 split ? any mention during the earning call ? thanks. The reason is that I need to add 200 shares more in case it splits.

GE has tested $12.5 two times recently and it is consolidating around $13.5. If I am right, it will test $13.8 in one week from now. When it breakout, it will stay above $14 which will lead short term traders to get in GE for momentum play. Stay tuned for the time to come."

I can spend $10 going to IMAX and seeing the same thing. NASA should NOT waste public money propping up these ""commercial"" space jaunts.

held my breath & bought back in on 3/11 2000 shares @ 12.23 on margin
Here is a fact. Easily proved. GE is down from $60 per share over the last 20 years. Trading at $13 and in a very long term down trend. For anyone to see.
This too shall pass...reasons we original bought GE are still there and even better now than last year...new buyers coming in now will not sell until it moves higher than current price. PS...if board reverses and decides against the RS...we could see the opposite of what just happened pretty dramatically...just MHO.Best to all GE Investors.
GE is a broken company owned it for decades+ this er was touted as something important. It not

Guillermo thinks investors will realize it in the next couple of years. As they did in 2009 when the stock tripled in three years. So without a reverse split we would see $30-$40. After the RS probably $250-$300. The RS will delay things a little because a bunch of idiots will try to short down GE after the RS. But then there will a short squeeze to triple the price. Guillermo has seen this movie few times already. Happy ending for long time holders.Stay greedy with your shares...

It owns, services or has on order about 1,650 aircraft, according to its website.""Cheers..."
CEO picked a very bad time for his change in strategy or maybe it was a good idea for a few billionaires
"On March 10th GE gave forward guidance, announced AerCap deal, said they would write off $3 billion in GE Capital merger with GE, and do 8:1 reverse stock split.They also slipped in 1 cent loss estimate for Q1 and revenue drop of about $1 billion.I reread this and am wondering why the low predictions 20 days before Q1 ended?If GE is truly reducing all labor costs and getting unnecessary plants closing, wouldn't you think the profit would go up?Add to that the many positive developments like new wind contracts, restoring Aviation to at least a 60% level, and the huge crushing debt reduction. Wouldn't you think all this would drastically change their 2021 outlook which is a 1 cent loss Q1, a 3 cent profit Q2, a 5 cent profit Q3, and a total 2021 year of 25 to 55 cents per share profit?Rational thinking says there is contradiction with what they said 40 days ago and all they feed us as optimistic news.I am on the side believing the earnings will be a surprise to better results than they predict.It would be totally contradictory to have a penny loss and at the same time claim reduced overhead and increased sales.So like everyone - I wait and wonder.Earni m gs are exactly seven days from this hour.Someone is either dealing off the bottom of the deck or bluffing as they raise expectations.The results are known anid all that is left is waiting a week."

Is the reverse split still happening? I’m jumping ship if it does.
"They are manipulating the comments on the board at the moment to try and spin this reverse split as a positive thing. 1 share for every 8 you buy is not a good thing people, wake up!"
"Reverse stock split's regardless of the corporate reason more times than not are sign's of management desperation, usually to avoid delisting, but in GE's case it's cloudy why you would do it. Have been a GE investor for decades, but won't stay through a reverse stock split. Personally have never seen a reverse split benefit Investor's. To be voted on in early May, Vote the Split down, along with no management confidence."

"Earnings beat, lower expenses, Aviation still hasn't picked up, FCF still on track.The U.S. industrial conglomerate reported a cash outflow of $845 million compared with an outflow of $2.2 billion last year. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv, on average, expected a cash outflow of $1.3 billion.The first quarter tends to be GE's slowest period of the year. However, improved earnings at all its industrial businesses except aviation and better working capital helped slow the cash burn.Free-cash flow is closely watched by investors as a sign of the health of GE's operations and ability to pay down debt."
board of directors meet Tuesday May 4th to decide. it is their call.they should tell us the 8:1 vote results.they then have for 1 minute to one year after decision to enact the actual split.nobody knows results yet but 5.5 billion shares of the 8.8 billion shares owned by funds.if it was controversial you would hear a lot of press. nothing said so you can assume the results are obvious. it will be all over and the small stock owners really have little to say on the issue of 8:1 split.

powell spoke and now the bond market did too-- no rate hike for 2 years---well the bond market just shoved it up his _____ yield just spiked to 1.72 on the 10-- wonder who is boss !!!!!!!-- now powell can't do anything --panic time
Thank goodness I sold out as soon as I heard that GE was planning a reverse stock split . Most Reverse stock splits NEVER work out in the short term and cause the small investors to buy micro shares. It still remains to be seen if the board of directors shoots this down.
GE got a contract and it only went up .35....meh!

Anyone sold yesterday should stop trading - GE is same shape this week as last week. Back at support level and up from here. Should get back to 14 before earnings on 4/27.
RS is a bad thing! Not too many buyers at 13. Who is going to buck up at 100?

"What do the company leaders expect. They cut a 30 year deal for Haier (and others) to build products (Washers, driers, Light bulbs etc., etc. , etc.) and keep the GE name on them. These products are Junk. If the latest washers can clean wet poop off the clothes we are lucky. How about having the Aircraft engines made over seas, or the life saving Med products also.Wake up GE management!!"
"why would they sell aircraft leasing unit when airline business goingto boom seriuosly i think management team dont know what they doing,they lost in thier thinking and ideas ,see a scary scary crashbacknelow$7 coming week to month, double whammy of bad bad bad news coming years when the corona crissis almosst over andwhy do areverse stock split that show that yourcompanyis in troubblean desparte"
Most people want GE to reach $15 and then jump off. I get that. Some averaged down to under $10. I get that too. Some bought under $10. I also get that. But RS is not good for GE's reputation.
"Why all the hype on the reverse split. GE will continue to have a higher stock price no matter what, so Buy Buy Buy GE....!!!"
If the stock went to 16 when split was announced I would feel differently. Was over $14 It didn't. It went to $12 or 11.99
"Culp will soon strike a deal to sell its remaining stake in Baker Hughes, putting to rest GE's debt past. This will shock Tusa into rating us as a strong buy. Buy now."

"The stock will move up and down (churning) until the earnings in a week.Also there is uncertainly on a 8:1 reverse vote which will lend in a few weeks.There is nervousness hon the vaccines and how long everyone will be still careful (not going places)Lastly, the stock is in a constant short by traders and that is also a real issue. All this will be history in a couple of months. Serious investors always ignore these constant distractions. Keep you eye on the ball and watch for new deals, profits, and improvement. It is coming.As for the quality of the stock and company, each quarter the stock should rise about 2 points based on improved numbers and as they get profits reported. By the end of the year looking back to today - you will be amazed at the price rise."
"""S&P placed GE’s BBB+ credit rating on CreditWatch with negative implications, as GE’s debt leverage will be higher than previously expected after the GECAS deal. The credit rating agency expects GE’s rating to be cut one notch to BBB, which is two notches above speculative grade, or “junk” status, in about 10 to 12 months.As the remain assets and debt of GE Capital will be consolidated into GE’s balance sheet, S&P expects GE’s debt leverage will increase to about 6.0x, or six times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda).S&P had previously treated GE Capital as a separate, captive finance unit."""

"What will happen immediately after the 8:1 split takes place? Will the sharks create an artificial drop in price, or will the stock be unaffected? My guess is the sharks will manipulate the price to create an artificial opportunity for some quick profit, which is standard.That being said, if the reverse split happens at $14, it will obviously mean shares will go to $112, what is the guess at where that $112 will go?"
GE is holding well with vigor in today's bear market! we will see 14 at end of this month.

I hope leadership reconsiders the 1 for 8 reverse split and tones it down to maybe a 1 for 4 split or or 1 for 3. 1 for 8 just seems like overkill
look for the 12 level it can't be stopped
"OK. Let us talk about FCF,BAC predicted that GE will jump about 20% based on improving FCF. That 20% jump will place the pps at $15. Based on the 10 year historical data showing a sawtooth trajectory, expect a 20% drop after the jump. BTW, BAC's projection was made before the RS was reveal. Would like to see an update from BAC soon."
"The smartest thing Culp did was to announce the RS at $14. So, if you want one share of GE after the split, you have to buy 8 shares now. As of today, you have t0 invest at least $108.80 to own 1 share after the split split. Really smart."
"Call 617 443 3400, it takes 30 seconds. Leave a message that you and your family oppose 100% to the PROPOSAL of a reverse split. PERIOD.30 seconds of your time to move this stock to $20 in 2021.And buy more share before your message, because we are going GREEN very soon.Stay greedy my friends."
They have one year from vote to do the reverse - they won’t pull the trigger until big move to the upside - so it’s coming ..
When is reverse split?
Bond market selling off on inflation fears and Fed meeting today. Sector rotation trade is back on. Tech is dumping and money flowing into defensive positions like GE that benefit from a recovering economy. It's just crazy seeing all the posts this morning from short sellers. The entire Nasdaq is red! There are so many better short candidates. I think GE will re-test levels above $14 soon.
Tomorrow’s information should be interesting. I am hoping for more positive news!!
Oh no 1 more up round. Let’s go GE
"closing green today. sorry shorts, yet again"
so many puts and calls at 13 big money is going to keep it at 13 thru tomorrow close
Per Barron’s: The CPPIB nearly quintupled its investment in GE stock by buying 6 million more shares of the conglomerate to end the fourth quarter with 7.6 million shares.
"I am NOT invested here at the moment but....A R/S during momentum is often actually seen as bullish - reduction of shares (they have 8 BILLION outstanding right now!!), market cap will become more aligned with peers, and consolidate / expand into their money makers. If you like the current GE head then your confidence/trust shouldn't be shaken here. He's righted the ship thus far and he is thinking 10 steps ahead of everyone. Very intriguing....."
GE NOW WHAT TIME IS IT.
Some time this week it is going to be over $14 again . Let’s hope 
still got 3 hours of trading day to go lower another #$%$ day for GE. Absolutely unable to hold any morning momentum into afternoon trading. At current level in about 2 weeks should be back down to $10.00 level so the next set of manipulators can start entire process over and over again. whata mess!!

We will recover positively today. I will not be surprised either if we go back to $14 per share. GE is GE.
sweet. GE = $$$
"I worked at GE for many years, and know of the potential that the company has with a good manager like Larry. I hate their decision to a posible reverse split, but we dont know yet if the total share holders vote would be a yes on that, that is still over a month away before something is decided. In the mean time GE has the potential to keep moving up if the environment in reference to the covid virus improves, GE will definitely ripe big benefits from that. In my opinion in the event of a reverse split on the near future, the share prize would be around 14 to 16 per share, A RS for GE would work definitely a great choice for the company since that would allow only just over 1 billion total shares to be available to share holders, which in turn would give GE a much better control and when they start paying dividends again would be a much smaller crowd. I believe Larry is aligning everything up for GE success with all the current and future decisions to cut down on debt and liabilities to position the company as strong or more with its competitors."

Please remember - profit is an accounting calculation - free cash flow is money in the bank if positive. So if cash flow negative means the business is draining cash while losing money . GE is generating cash at a rate of 2-5 billion a year. Keep your eye on what matters - I doubt any of us can figure out all the accounting for all their business / depreciation is a non cash expense for example so it’s possible to report accounting wise while cash wise making money. Culp has his eye on the ball ... and going to make us a 2x-3x within 12-24 months - I’m okay with that
I was watching cnbc; 2 analyst 1 pro vs 1 con & interviewer. All 3 never mentioned the 8-1 stock split in their interview. I thought it was remarkable the subject never came up

Time to buy GE
No reason for GE to be down again despite new upgrades after upgrades and all other positivity. Manipulation in work.
this is just part of the SPX basket it moves up and down with the index-- the longs think there is something special here-- it is only moving up or down with buy and sell programs from machine trades-- as the SPX goes so goes GE-- on a weekly close there is a +.96 correlation with the SPX- you are trading the SPX here nothing more
"GE Shares are currently under Valued with Upgrades coming in faster than Bill Clinton can take off his pants for an Intern...Morgan Stanley analyst Joshua Pokrzywinski lifted his price target on GE by $4, to $17 per share -- well ahead of the Wall Street average of around $12.30 -- while maintaining his overweight rating on the industrial group as GE prepares for its March 10 investor day presentation.

If management was trying to torpedo the stock I think news of a reverse split and insane CEO compensation would do the job nicely.
Look @ 3 and 6 month chart you can see the exact day the reverse split was announced. I was the end of a pretty nice run that was almost 2 months ago. GE could be trading 15-16 easy but now it's crippled. And it is
Thank you for the cheap shares to average up. Nice blurb in Barron's too. The days of Jeff Immelt are finally receding. Only by the steady hands of Larry Culp are we now positioned for growth. Buy as much as you want below $15 imo.
I told you to buy the dip. This is not a meme stock. Is solid company.

DHR dividend rate was 0.10% under Culp. Currently 0.33% after Culp.GE dividend rate 0.30% under Culp. BKR dividend rate 3.59% and GE is selling BKR sharesGE is currently not dividend friendly. Expect a cut to 0.10% after the split.
How come Duestsche bank raising target from $13 to $14? They are seeing a better future.
Will their dividend remain the same after the proposed reverse split?

Volume has been very low this past couple of weeks. It sounds there are not much interest in buying before the earnings which sounds bearish to me. As usual it could not hold to its 25 cents gain today. Very disappointed but Monday is another day. Hopefully it will be a better day

Fake news said GE stock fall.
"Almost all reverse splits are done by failing companies trying to avoid being delisted. That is not the case with GE. It’s neutral news. The stock decline is retail investors not understanding that it’s neutral news over reacting. GE is doing exceptionally well. The board wants the stock to be reflective of its peers, and make it more difficult for guys like Tusa to push the price down with nonsense news. But to say “in my experience” means you are most likely comparing apples to oranges."

"Another factor that no one is discussing here: The trade war could potentially end under the new administration. If that happens, lookout. The trade war was a headwind for GE in 2018-2019. The market is already starting to put COVID in the rearview mirror. If interest rates don’t rise too much, and the trade war with China comes to an end, I think GE will be/one of the top performing large cap stocks."

Oh Danny boy. Oh Danny boyLet’s hope Ge turns down so you can post your research generated hypotheses dribble drek again
Don't forget your earplugs...
another GREEN day for GE....it's driving the shorts crazy.
"If people were pricing GE on manifest fundamentals, the price would be lower. $13+ represents very high confidence that GE will recover to fundamentals deserving $13 and unwillingness to miss out by attempting to time that recovery. Further price appreciation will be slow because any good results just bring fundamentals more in line with current pricing."
Good Day to All GE Investors!!! 
"Here is my takeaway from the GE Earnings Call Transcript.I and any serious person doing analysis came away confused with the contradictory comments.I am waiting for the 10K report filed with the SEC to see the actual numbers.But here is my take after reading and re-reading a printed cop of the Transcript.1) The Transcript certainly optimistic going forward.The obvious tone is that the long time frame you look forward - the better the numbers.That is great. I also think the longer term is very positive and I see a lot of 2021, 2022, and 2023 upside.2) The discussion was heavy on ""factoring"". I own a good size corporation and have for decades. We are profitable and have not factored in decades. We self-finance from our past and current profits. That means the firm appears to be hungry for immediate cash. You wouldn't think a company claiming they have access to $45 billion in cash assets would need to factor and pay a middleman - so this is confusing and contradictory information.What is true, however, is the company is presently selling $80 billion a year. They now say they were spending $4 billion to $5 billion a year factoring. That would mean over 2.3% of all the money they take in is spent on interest every month. If you sell $6 billion for a month and pay $260 million ($800 million for the quarter) to factor - It certainly looks to me like they spending 2.3% of their profits were used paying lenders to factor. (probably selling commercial paper short term)Factoring is a new issue. It is so muddy that no serious analysis can be made. They are now claiming eliminating factoring will save $4 billion to $5 billion a year. It was not showing in the past 10k reports so I cannot know what they spent last year on factoring.The good news is this elimination of factoring has to flow to the bottom line.2) On the first few comments they made they restated correctly that they are booking a ""one time lost"" from the GECAS deal of $3 billion. That was announced previously on March 10th. Yesterday on slide 8 they said the amount was a $2.8 billion write-off. This write-off has to show up in the 10K filing for Q1. If that is correct, they just took and immediate write-off. That is a deduct from profits as an offset loss. That $2.8 billion in this Q1 write-off means the real Free Cash Flow for all of 2021 should have been an adjusted $5.5 to $7.5 billion. That would explain their only projecting the $2.5 to $4.5 billion profit for 2021. Not one analyst jumped on this very large offset against profits. But that is HUGE. Steven Tusa did touch it and I suspect this will be his next big thing. But if it is done- it is of no importance after this year.That write-off would really explain all the optimistic comments of reduced factor costs, reduced payroll, reduced overhead, increased margins, and more. It still isn't enough offset being projected because if they are doing all that saving. That means the numbers are too low. I think they are understating things considerably to have better results in a future quarter. It is ""fudging"" their comments - waiting to later announce better results.Lastly, I believe the entire disruption to Aviation and the world over Covid is rapidly evaporating and by the end of this year. Normalcy will be returning. Anything that returns the world to what it was in the start of 2020 will be positive.Final summation is that after the Q1 results were announced - I am sure management is understating the benefits from environment positioning. GE will obviously garner lot of benefits from the planet focusing on reducing environmental pollution. Every single area of General Electric is razor focused and positioned to benefit from adding to reducing climate change."
Stock is DEAD. Reverse split IS THE REASON
"GE is going to be traded between high 12th and 13th, and I will be surprised it is going to be under 12 , ever. It is going to be breaking 14 again sooner than later. 15? May/June. 16-18 within the year . Buy in at low 12th"

Ge has been a part of this country for a long time. I do believe Mt Culp will right the ship. Ge is not a small player in anything it does. Even if drops in price I do not believe the US government would ever let them fail. GE is strategic company.

"I refuse to try the tactics of some on this page. Truth is, GE is a solid company with transformational leadership currently in place. I've owned the stock for years and yes, I see it trending higher. New aircrafts need new engines, one of GE's mainstays. They build some of the most efficient power equipment in the world. I look for them to increase their dividend sometime down the road. So, I'm long GE."
A reverse split is never good for a company’s stock. Stocks only needs to stay above $2 to be comfortably safe from delisting. The fact that GE is announcing this now suggests that they think the stock will go below $2 soon if they don’t do a reverse split.... This could continue to go down.

The real shame is that a lot of new investors are being misled by a few crackpots who risk nothing and have big mouths.Onto another similar thing that happened today. Culp had his $240 million bonus goal raised from $16.64 a share to $31.28 a share.I am excited because that means Larry Culp will have the get the price up to $31.28 a share for a month in the next 3 years.He said today - but nobody really heard it - that in 2023 Renewables is on tract to have $3 billion free cash flow. As I said in an earlier post, it is mathematically possible for GE to move to that $31 price in the next 2 years.I am even more sure it will happen now!written by:Gene (not the G who is also posting under the same sign)"
"GE is flying high, way above the clouds again. Absolutely stunning"
More buyers than sellers today! Go GE!
I own stock in lots of loser companies. Ones that are more concerned with showering management with wealth than earning a nickel
Buy and buy .....
"Doesn't the dividend per share increase along with the price with a reverse split, since the investors now has less shares? That in itself would be a draw. Also wouldn't the EPS increase since there are less available shares."
GE would go up more if GE would cancel the proposed reverse split!

In GE better days are coming. Congrats Longs
"OH happy Day..""General Electric (GE) (22%, 1.50%), the revitalized Aviation, Healthcare and Power conglomerate, was a top contributor following on its strong 4Q 2020 performance. Fourth-quarter Healthcare results were excellent, with revenues up 6% year-over-year (YoY), operating margins up 3% to 20% and strong FCF conversion. The Power and Renewables segment improved margins due to strength from gas plant services. With flight traffic increasing, Aviation appears likely to begin a multi-year recovery in the second half of this year. GE also swapped its aircraft leasing operations to AerCap for a 46% stake in the combined company, intelligently wrapping up its previously troubled GE Capital financing operations and further decreasing overall leverage. We continue to be impressed by the turnaround work of CEO Larry Culp, and the stock remains discounted against the quality of the three core business segments."""
The reverse split will remove the stigma surrounding GE just like C Citi Bank...Buy GE !!!!!
After the R/S now comes the cheery news of an offering of new shares. Only way sorry boy Culp can get money.
Early trades smell of a reverse split coming.
another low volume day. This dog wants to break out. Volume has been too low for several days!
"The reverse split is a done deal, send in your votes if you want, but it's already set up with institutional investors. I'd ask Culp one thing "" how do you plan to make more money with the RS other than without the RS?"
I wonder if this goes back to 11.45 level. Too bad I thought GE was a good buy. I don't see any reason to pick it up now. RS has to kick in and settle before any real interest in holding GE.
Green new deal.... Do some research.... Batteries contain magnesium. Magnesium burns white hot. Last three electric vehicle crashes... rescue personnel let the vehicles burn out before a recovery was made. FACT.
"GE, F, RKT, PLTR. Buy and hold for happiness in coming weeks."
"Expect the AERCAP deal details to be part of the Wednesday conference call being held by General Electric.GECAS may merge wih AERCAP and together they may spin off the two companies into a new company with part ownership by each firm in proportion to their parts. That might make sense....I doubt that this is a straight $30 billion sale of GECAs to AERCAP. I t has too much debt for AERCAP and AERCAP is too small for that sort of deal in the middle of a pandemic and a slow-down aircraft leasing industry. Their sales in 2020 were under-performing and poor..More importantly, someone on this thread said that the GECAS-AERCAP dela would erase $25 billion or 1/4th of the GE Capitalization. Totally wrong.GECAS may be valued at $30 to $40 billion, but it only generates $5 billion per year at GE Capital and it doesn't seem to make money. It is also about 1/2 of the total GE Capital holdings of around $10 billion.And another analyst (CFRA Research) falsely said that by selling GECAS and BIOPHRMA - General Electric was getting rid of the crown jewels. They said the RENEWABLES AND POWER divisions were losers.Wrong. RENEWABLES AND POWER are the new horizon for General Electric. Both have a ton of growth and promise. While they have not made a lot of profit in the past - they can make a lot of profit going forward.GECAS at $5 billion yearly sales and BIOPHARMA t $3 billion yearly sales are just 8% sales of the $100 billion General Electric was recording in 2018. And the large growth of RENEWABLES from $8 billion sales in 2018 to $15 billion sales in 2020 and probably approaching $20 billion sales in 2021 more that offset the GECAS AND BIOPHARMA loss of sales volume.I think GE RENEWABLES will soon be clocking 8% bottom line of $1.6 billion Free Cash Flow in 2021. And remember - GE has not said it was selling GECAS. It is entering into a strengthening deal to change the GE Balance sheet. That is magic in the account industry of how giant industrial companies wring out the best numbers.Look for Larry Culp to squeeze every drop of profit and balance sheet readjustment that is possible going forward while keeping the four crown jewels of the present General Electric.And for serious investors and stockholder - what could be better for the stock than profits going forward, debt erased, and improve balance sheet in the near future ...."
And now bounce back

"Still wondering why RS. Let us take a peek at BAC and GE shares outstanding.2014 BAC (10516M) GE (10119M)2016 BAC (11059M) GE (9187M)2018 BAC (10237M) GE (8691M)2020 BAC (8797M) GE (8753M)There you see for yourself. BAC is growing revenue and buying back shares. Share price is now shy of $40 from below $14 in 2014. Oh, I can remember when BAC was $5. I couldn't buy enough because that was2009 and 2011. Couldn't find the money to load up like crazy.On the other hand, GE has been reducing shares by selling assets. Looks like assets to sell are running out and outstanding shares are creeping back up. Hence the proposed RS to hide the facts. No reason to pay $13 for a share."

Good Morning to All GE Investors!!! :):):)And BTW...Don't forget... Baggies = GE Shorts! ;)

Try harder Baggies!!!...After all this you still have not broken $13 pps!. OH BTW- Baggies= GE Shorts!
"First Major Blunder by Culp,....by reverse splitting they remove the retail investor, someone who has supported GE while the institutions bailed on them. It was these so called financial engineers that got GE into trouble with the DERIVATIVE delusion of the early 2000's. The board should have left the share restructure ALONE."
ge is -1 in pre market...now the big one will come see you soon at 15
"Come on Mr. Tusa, even Mr. Inch has raised his price target to $11 now. You really think $5 is right with the strong aviation recovery coming over the next year? Makes no sense."
Larry Culp needs to come out NOW and say the reverse split idea was a mistake and they misjudged investor sediment about it and decided to no longer consider it and save our investment in GE.. be genuine and do it!!! Please!! To much at stake for something that does nothing to change good fundamentals!
1.7% higher on opening bell very much like a broken record and surprise surprise surprise stock actually falling. biggest manipulated stock traded out there.
Danaher up $9.00 today. Culp came from Danaher.
yahoo being sold
Now I got it. The vote against the 230 million was nonbinding. He can still get. No wonder no one is biting until the board makes a move.
Upgrade this am
"Q2, 3, and 4 will get progressively stronger. The shareprice will reflect this strength. Culp is another Tim Cook."
GE= $$$
"As an investor who has been following GE since early 2000's and having bought/sold several times, it seems GE under Culp is doing fine and this selling phase will look like a lost buying opportunity next week onwards. In any case, it is getting too late to sell on Reverse split news now. At a higher level, RS does not change anything fundamentally and GE will do fine and in longer term, so will share price but RS is bad optics and it seems not convincing enough. Maybe they will change it but otherwise, unless GE comes up with a better plan, we should just vote no. And yes, shareholders will be voting on the proposal. I think it would help to send a note to IR or call at (1)617 443 3400 expressing disapproval. Any number of reasons as expressed in other conversations can be used. I can't post the IR email as Yahoo removes the post but is easily available on GE site."
Tomorrow GE will go up again
"Yahoo is blocking GE research on DNA vaccines. Blocked me twice from sharing GE link and this news link. It’s news! WTH is Y up to....“Aiming to enable vaccine production on-demand, anywhere in the world in just days, GE Research and a multi-disciplinary team that includes the Broad Institute, DNA Script, MEDInstill, Molecular Assemblies, and the University of Washington, have been awarded a five-year, up to $41 million project through a new program from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) called NOW (Nucleic Acids On-Demand Worldwide). Such a rapidly scalable and deployable production process could dramatically increase the speed at which new vaccines, such as the recently approved COVID-19 vaccines, could be deployed to people in need.”"
"GE may end up canceling the reverse split idea, that is due to some mutual fund investors opposed to it"
Those that not aware that R/S is coming...Don't buy as you will get trap..
14 soon ??
best stock to own right now and for the next one year: GE
Why isn’t the CEO saying anything about the adverse reaction to the RS??!
Buy $13 PUT Options ....
I don’t have a problem with reverse splits. After 128 years a company is gonna find itself over diluted and it takes too much volume to move 8.7 billion shares..Same problem Nokia has.There are too many other stocks vying for investors attention for GE to generate the several hundred millions shares traded daily needed to move such a large float
Did you buy OTLY?
"People , two days ago GE was a great company ! What could possibly change to the opposite , revers split is just meaningless . RS event is just being used to steal your shares ,lol."
"GE Announced Tons Wednesday. This Was the Real Bombshell General Electric (ticker: GE) is proposing to give investors one share for every eight they now hold. That will take its share price to about $112, based on recent levels, reducing the shares outstanding to about 1.1 billion fromI do not have full access to the article , but other than the few here who think it was not a bid deal , everyone else thinks so"
"Executives at both GE and AT&T received special stock awards in 2020 that made them among the highest-paid business leaders last year, a difficult period when the pandemic disrupted business, tested managers and cost millions of Americans their jobs. The median CEO received compensation of $13.7 million in 2020, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis in April. Larry Culp , GE's chairman and CEO, received compensation valued by the company at $73.2 million , according to securities filings. Over the summer, the GE board revised the CEO's contract, extending it until 2024 and awarding him the special stock grant that was valued at more than $100 million at the end of 2020. Mr. Culp voluntarily gave up his salary after Covid-19 struck and also declined his cash bonus. His salary for the year was $653,409 .Gave up his salary? LOL. okay"
GOOD quarterly report next week
"The sale of the jet lease biz frees up a whopping $30 billion (billion!) Off their books, essentially ending the massive headache known as GE Capital. Now, the other headache, their legacy insurance division, still exists, hopefully CEO Culp will wind that down too. Won't happen overnight, but a major hurdle is gone. 2021 has already been a great turnaround year for GE. Keep the faith, longs!"
News Flash.... Baggies= Shorts! 
GE back to $15 soon.
"PRICELINE Reverse Split 1:6 back in 2003 at $1+, UP3,000%.. $100 BILLION Mkt Value, TINNY Revenue $6bn down 80%, Rev Profits WIPPED OUT.. No CASH FLOW NARRATIVE THERE ?? Only in GEs Case constant Headline False, Shifting Narratives..."
"Indexes dropped significantly, but our GE looks very strong. This is a very good sign. More people are turning bullish now which can be seen very the option call number. Next week should be a very interesting week. Stay tuned."
I'm guessing that GE will trend down to $12.50/share and will begin trading at $100/share after reverse split. Who knows where it will go from there.
BIGGER TOMORROW to $15
At what price on GE does Tusa's psychiatrist tell him to let go of his anger?

Whoever came up with reverse split idea is drunk on shareholder money.
reverse split makes EPS and PE ratios look a lot better.After selling some of business you need to shrink shares too

Check 90 day chart. Since nov 2020 steady gains with a few reasonable gap ups.Now in 2 days 2 big red candles that gap down indicating institutional selling. at this rate $10 by end of next week is likely as near term put options indicate. The fund managers are driving this down and mid April & June call options indicate they will drive it back up by then. Looks like the biggest GE manipulators are Culp and the board with the RS.
"The General Electric-Vehicle Future Is Nearly Here. This Overlooked Components Giant Is Ready.For all the hard-charging talk about electric cars, you might think that they were taking over the U.S. market. Electric cars there are suddenly 14% of the market, or 23% if we count plug-in hybrids that burn fossil fuel for backup. In the U.S., meanwhile, a $7,500 credit for every electric vehicle phases out after companies sell 200,000 of them, so (TSLA) (ticker: TSLA) and (GM) (GM), the biggest EV players, no longer benefit."
Annual report asks for vote on 1/8 reverse split - any thoughts?
"GE doing a reverse stock split to give the image of being profitable is like the 25 handicap golfer telling you he wants to play the tips. Just laughable to know GE wants to give the impression of a $100 stock when, even in its best days until Welch, it maxed out in the 50s. The only thing GE will do at that price is cause average investors to avoid it due to it's price and make it a lot more volatile to big down swings. Yes, I know the valuation is the same after the split, but we all know, thanks to Game Stop and other overly bought stocks, people don't play stocks based on facts, it's about perception and hitting the home run. To think GE will ever be a $400 stock ($50 at current non split levels) is just crazy talk. GE is much more likely to go to $50 from here than $400 after the split. If they insisted on a split, 1-3 would have been much better and kept them in the realm of reality for a GE price."
"Aviation was down considerably dur to Pandemic...however. look at the trend in Aviation...people r starting to come back to flying, travel to Europe is now being allowed, companies r seeing the value of face to face meetings n total people flying per day is increasing at an.alarming rate since mid March!! This is an opportunity to purchase shares at a discount because people aren't smart enough to do their Homework...I just did it for u so take advantage! Just my opinion!"
"GE is just itching to Break Out... IMHO this is ready to go. Shorts are playing with fire here... please be careful. GLTA GE Investors and have a great weekend! And Remember: If they don't cover soon, Baggies= GE Shorts."
The slow GE crawl back to the 12s.
GE is one of BA’s main suppliers...You know those round things under the wings that make the planes fly? Those are made by GE. ;-)

BAGGIES after today's earnings report.
How do you like that potential RS now? Just a way for the guys to steal your shares
"50 days moving average is still active. Will go up in the next 3 weeks before quarterly. I agree with many contributors about the timing of the RS (they should have done it at quarterly in a careful way instead hammering it out). Fundamentally nothing has changed, they are on track."
Did Larry Step DOWN YET...call me when he does. Thank. Boolean
Climb baby climb
"Hey longs, plot the max chart for GE and you will see it is making lower highs and lower lows on the overall cycle, yup next wave going to zero."
Culp train continues... ...
"I AM VOTING YES ON RS. Here is why: They are thinking outside of the box, why not do something different. They don't have to RS, they want to, The sell off is all psychological because we have all been taught that RS's are when companies risk being delisted. GE doesn't even come close to that. I believe that GE and institutions are smarter than me so I will trust their vote. They are the ones that will decide, not retailer like your and me. There is nothing for anyone to gain or lose ""immediately"" upon an RS, it's simply a different number of shares with the same overall value. What is their exact reason for an RS, I don't know, could be to reduce volatility, maybe they buy back stock after frightening holders into selling driving the price down. I don't know, but everyone (except a small # of shorts) want the stock to go up, so why do a RS ?. There has got to be a hidden, underlying reason somewhere. NOTHING has changed recently except the recent aerospace sale announcement. FCF and revenue forecasts look good, if interest rates rise, that will help with pension obligations, and they don't need to borrow money. Personally, I think they are on their way to nice growth and a nice dividend increase."
Where is the 14 you promised yesterday ?
ge to the moon let's go now before every one is waking up!!!15 easy

"This has been a great shakeout - 5% of the float exchanged in 2 days.

"230 million is way way way too much and everyone knows it. Absurdity must be checked eventually. Culp very good and very smart for GE; however, let's get reasonable here."
"The turnaround at GE is starting to take hold and the reverse split is a part of a plan that will bring back investors (maybe institutions) and put them into a position of slowly start increasing the dividend (this will take time but it's gonna happen).The goal is to reduce the number of outstanding shares to bring the total shares more in line with other conglomerates in the industry....There are two ways to reduce the outstanding shares....1) Buy back stock (the way most larger companies do it) or 2) Reverse stock split.....GE got to this bloated share count through years of mismanagement of the finances by Welch and Immelt. This stock was split several times over the years (traditional split) without giving any real thought to the bloated share count it was creating. The financial crisis required more dilution and the shares count grew terribly out of control.We know the goal of improving cash flow and the need to raise cash. So buying back shares is not anything that could be considered. Reverse stock split is the only way to bring this back in line.I know many have the reaction (myself included) to paint reverse splits as a negative and desperate move by a company. That is the more traditional use of a reverse split. That is not what this is looking to do. I see this as a strategic move that accomplishes a big big objective without having an impact on the balance sheet.The 8 or 9 to 1 reverse split with take the company from 8.8 billion shares outstanding to .9 to 1.1 billion shares....Without doing the math for you, let me suggest doing this to see the impact... I took a look at Honeywell focusing on these three areas...Shares Outstanding695.5MEPS (TTM, GAAP)6.71P/E Ratio (TTM, GAAP)31.65xSource is TD Ameritrade Summary Page for HoneywellDo the 8 or 9 to 1 reverse split on GE's data to get these numbers....Then extrapolate GE's stock price from there....you will be pleasantly surprised at what you see....Now go look at Honeywells stock price. Now this isn't going to happen overnight...We might see a split adjusted price to $100 or so and then drop before improved EPS are attained....With improved cash flow (happening now) and the turnaround well underway, growth will start to take hold and we will significant improvement in the stock price...Look for growth deals to be made in the renewable energy sector to get the company growing again..... Larry Culp is doing a brilliant job and seems to have his board on board with the vision.....In two years this will be a $200 stock (25-30 by todays share count). If we get those numbers we will then start to see a slow increase in the dividend....Patience....he knows what he is doing.....reducing share count without spending cash.....Hope this makes sense to those concerned with the reverse split"
note there are two Ricks on this board. I'm bullish... Boeing is up ... good sign... GE should close above $13.65 today ...
GE 100 day RS rating above 80. That’s extremely bullish and most likely means big gains ahead.

"reverse split will drive most of retail investors away. How can retail investors sell covered call for a passive income ? with 30B cash in hand, why not build EV battery factory which is very hot right now, or buy back shares or invest in AI and 5G technology. There is thousand things to do with 30B and this company chose the path to F everything."
Ge won't go any higher until they change their dividend policy and if they do the reverse split it is going to tank.
Hundreds of Millions for CEO but not even $13 to buy back a single share of stock
"The massive drag on GE was GE Capital. 30 billion of debt slashed. Wow! But the legacy business of the insurance division remains a burden. Hopefully they wind that down, too. Rejoice, GE longs, a major, major weight has been lifted!"

"inclined to vote no on the reverse split of 1:8 it achieves nothing for the shareholder.If they want to reduce shafe count, buy back shares. That way the shareholders get an incremental increase of profits."
"Glad I exited with a profit .I would consider buying again after the split & a decline to the teens again .Until then , I will move on to greener pastures"
"I don't understand all the panic over the RS. Wouldn't a retail/small investor want to gobble up shares now -- not sell them -- before they cost an arm and a leg? They're obviously doing this to get back on the Good Boy List for institutional investors and be relisted on the DOW. The only difference between before and after an RS is perception, so why would everyone start freaking out and selling? Also it seams like an RS would totally wipe out a huge swath of Shorties -- a huge plus. I'm asking seriously and as a buy and hold basic investor. No option/put talk please, none of that is on my radar, just an old-time investor here. I'm up 75-133% depending on the account. I bought to hold this for like 5 years and get the Danaher-like 400% pay off."

Considering 1st qtr the worst for the entire year and the fact they beat estimates by 50% is a good news in my view. That tells me going forward this year things will get much better.
"Can someone (shorts) explain to me that if the RS is such a bad idea, then why is the stock in an uptrend ?. If you look at the charts, GE is slowly but surely going up. Why is it not going down if the RS is so bad ?. Come on you short geniuses , explain ?."
"Hopefully, GE can employ some of the many thousands who are crossing the border each day."

"The Barron’s article today made several great points.One of which is that most reverse stock splits are done by failing companies with poor fundamentals. Also, reverse splits rarely happen. So the data for reverse splits will skew the numbers towards lower values.But GE has solid fundamentals and is not doing the split to keep their stock from being delisted. My take away is that today’s move down is a huge over reaction to the reverse split by people looking at skewed data sets.I am getting my teeth kicked in today...but I’m holding on"

"Long term holders are more interested in protecting their nest egg. If you have accumulated, let say, 1000 shares of GE with $0 per share and see your dividend drop to $10, will you stay and watch your free shares drop to 125, and risk even more dilution? A smart investor will take the 1000 free shares and run."

"Two points(RS and CEO revised bonus) are really concerned by everybody. I fully understand the concerns. I feel the two points does affect the short term views of GE. This has led recent consolidation from $14.42 to $13.5. However, These two negative points don’t change the long term view. The following is my reasonand understanding of the two concerning points:The first point: the reverse split. I personally view: GE Doesn’t need to do reverse split. Historical data shows only the companies in bad shape did reverse split to boost price to avoid delisting or sugar coding to attract institutional investors. No institutions buy a stock because of high stock prices. They buy because the company is good, not because of high price. All companies having high stock price have never because of reverse split. Not sure which wall street consultant provided the idea. GE should fire the consultant. Sugar coding only means the management didn’t have confidence to take the company to much higher price so that it requires the reverse split. Talking about institutional investors, GE has never short of institutional investors. GE is a stock always having high institutional conviction. It has 63% institutional investors right now. Thus, the reason for attracting institutional investors really doesn’t hold. It clearly the reverse split has created a bad impression in short term which led more than one month of price consolidation. If without the news, GE’s price could reach $16 because of the momentum building up in March. The damage has already done. That being said, After the investors are getting use to it and understand the reverse split only affected short term perceptions, GE is still the same GE; i.e, the outlook and earnings are the key of the future for every company. The second point: is the board revised the bonus of CEO from the option price of $31 to $16. $31 was reasonable price target for the CEO to achieve since GE’s price was at $18 range when he joined the company. Board lowered the price target from $31 to $16 is really too easy to achieve. The $16 is lower than the time when he joined GE. If GE’s price reach $16, he would get $230 million and $31 would get almost $.5 billion to $1 billion. This is not fair to employees and shareholders. After ceo joint GE the stock price dropped from $18 to $6 because of COVID-1, that should not be an excuse to lower his goal to from $31 to $16. He deserves the bonus of $230 million if he can Bring back the stock price to $31 which was $13 higher than the price when joined the company. $31 is a reason target which requires the CEO to work hard to make the company better. GE’s union has raised up the concern also. But it will be hard to unwind the signed contract since the board was behind it.The two points do worry the investors a little bit and raise some red light. Why the board of GE didn’t raise up the concerns?These points upset many shareholders, including me. But these don’t change the positive outlook of the company. The question remains is do you believe the GE positive outlook? I do. With COVID-19 situation is getting better, the GE’s business will get better. This is a large probability. In today’s overvalued market, GE is the fewer undervalued companies in future’s market. This is the reason I like GE."

if you think ge is worth 12.50 then 1/100 or 100/1 split or reverse split is meaningless. people shouldn't be investing if they think any kind of split has effects the value of the stock. if you dont think it's worth 12.50 then dont buy it.
"Gene said 2hrs ago:Culp was crystal clear today1) no dividend planned or contemplated going forward2) vote was 97% to reverse split 8:0 per management request3) no mergers or very small mergers for the next couple of years.My comments: 1. Past history shows Culp is not dividend friendly. Expect a cut after the split.2. Do you mean 8:0 or 8:13. Sell, merger or no merger, notice he is silent on issuing new shares after the split"

"General Electric asked investors to do some difficult math last week about its balance sheet and accounting, and the investors balked. Shares fell as shareholders digested a lot of news related to complicated debt actions, asset sales, and accounting consolidations. In the end, the outcome—less debt is a good thing, but the one thing that investors hate is confusion.But on Wednesday, General Electric (ticker: GE) CFO Carolina Dybeck Happe offered clarity on the company’s debt plans, telling investors exactly how the conglomerate will manage its debt between now and 2023. The good news: More debt reduction is on the way, and GE is taking a conservative and transparent approach toward its debt management. Investors are breathing a sigh of relief, and the stock is up."

"GE Facts check: 1. profited $.03, better than expected. 2. revenue $17.1 billion. Lower than expected. Revenue is a kind disappointing. Except renewable energy having higher revenue than last year. All other business such as aviation, health care, power and capital all having lower revenue. No sure why healthcare have also disappointing results. 3. Cash flow: negative $860 million which better than last year. The outflow was mainly from aviation. 4. Outlook for 2021: profit $.15 to $.25 and cash flow to be positive between $2.5 to $4.5 billion. If aviation will recover better than expected, the earnings and cash flow will be at the high end side. 5. Discontinue to use Facting accounting next quarter.GE is still in very early stage of recovery. What the management did was to make the company leaner and thinner and straightening accounting report. They did it. Can they grow the company? Nobody can answer the question. But one thing is clear and sure: GE is the market leader in each of its business sectors. Their business were affected by COVID-19. It will return to normal in near future. This will be sure thing. As the ceo said: “It is not if, it is when.”Some investors are thinking GE will increase dividend and buy back stock. Don’t expect They will do this until 2023 when GE is fully recovered. Remember they just cut the cost and still have negative cash flow. There are a lot debt to be paid. As the management said, the debt will be cut to $40 billion by the year end of 2021.￼With knowing these facts, it is important to set our expectation and don’t over hype as a shareholder or trader. Be patient and try to accumulate more shares when bears pushed it down such as this morning; i.e., lower the cost."

"Here is General Electric's real potential to grow incredibly large.Wind power will continue to deliver record growth of new installations over the next five years.Ask yourself the question: Would you like to be Tesla with 30 car companies breathing down your neck or would you rather be GE with a exploding environmental future wind market?The answer is clear....The most promising is the OFFSHORE Wind for dramatic growth worldwide.A new analysis by the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) shows that wind can power 3.3 million jobs over the next five years. Last year OFFSHORE installed 5 GW, mostly General Electric. Going forward the need will triple yearly.With 751 GW of wind power capacity ONSHORE and OFFSHORE already installed, the wind industry has generated nearly 1.2 million jobs globally to date. (International Renewable Energy Agency)As of 2020, there were approximately 550,000 wind energy workers in China, 260,00 in Brazil, 115,000 in the US and 63,000 in India, according to a global survey by GWEC Market Intelligence. The additional 470 GW forecasted wind capacity will create more than 3.3 million direct jobs worldwide.On TV this morning Exxon said there is no way they can move into Wind or Solar. That is great news because it announces the manufacturers already in Wind are all that will be there 5 years from now.So GE has limited competition going forward in a rapidly expanding market and is excellently positioned to dominate the wind turbine industry."
Not sure what the problem with the reverse split is. No effect on the company. Sure it's a bad signal if the motive is to hide a continuing deterioration in price. But that's not the case here. Seems this is just another example of solving bad financial engineering decisions of the past and brings the shares outstanding to a sensible level.

"Hope Berkshire Hathaway adds GE to their investments. Buffet and Munger should support American companies that make real products. Munger was right to trash Bitcoin. He may be old and rich, but he spoke commonsense. Crypto currency is the vehicle to launder money, a tax avoidance scam. He is right that its mostly bad actors who would want total anonymity in what businesses they run. I get Bitcoin value derives from its scarcity, and that means it can be traded amongst parties. Like art dealers trading art but monetizing it for real currency. I think if Governments decided to shutdown Bitcoin and other crypto operations due to their huge power consumption, the party will be over real fast. Or they could add a levy onto crypto for the electricity it consumes and carbon dioxide emissions generated. lets say the levy is 100% of the daily price of crypto. That would see the end of it."

Reverse split needs shareholder approval and it will take some time. I am sitting tight and buying back what I sold at $14.20
tomorow 
"TTD, 10 for 1 split, ex-date 6/17/2021. Yep, you heard correctly ""10 shares"" for every ""1 share"", that's a management team that has shareholders best interests at heart."
Does anyone understand that shareholders must approve the reverse split and so far it sounds like they will vote against it. I think everyone is overlooking this very important fact.
"What ever it is, it's probably an over reaction. It seems we are in an over react to everything culture."

"GE executives are paying themselves massive bonuses, yet, offer the retail investor 1 share for every 8 reverse split for their loyalty!!!"
"When Elon Musk says that MBAs are over rated, you might wonder what he means. Compare these two company :1. CLF was $3 in 2020, GE was $6 in 2020. 2. CLF made deals and acquired companies, GE made deals and sold off assets3. CLF is head to $20 with no reverse split, GE was heading to $20 but wants to reach $100 by reverse split4. CLF CEO earned a Master of Science degree in Metallurgical Engineering5. GE CEO earned an MBA from Harvard Business SchoolThe reverse split seems like what an MBA will do to boost ego, and be like Honeywell. I have said it before, MBAs should not run engineering companies."
"The highest for GE was $30 in 2016. It was a giant big hype that got GE there and investors were promised a bigger windfall. Then Tusa warned that nothing adds up and Buffer dumped his shares. That was the first windfall. Then GE started selling assets and cutting dividend resulting in a really fast windfall from $30 to $6. The only way GE will see $30 again is by reverse split. And GE is going in big. A big fat 8 for 1 reverse split. That is another big fat windfall. Then new shares will be issued. Another big fat windfall. Then who knows what will happen next but rest assured, more wind will fall."
This afternoon rally is meaningless. It will selloff again tomorrow morning.
Smart money knows where to go. The company's potential is huge. It's sad what previous CEOs have done to this company. Now it seems that this company is on the way to shine again.$ 20 by mid-year.
"buy . Ge was $14 a few days ago. This price won't last.... target price being raised by many sources . Aviation will get back what it lost to the coronavirus, great day tomorrow may hit $13.65."
I would love to see a 1 dollar up day. I do not remember GE going up a dollar in recent history.
I see the wisdom in Culp’s latest move. Long term it will be healthy. I saw posts of those who would prefer buybacks over a reverse split but the effect long term should be the same. If the 30b is used to pay down debt especially those long term care debts while removing the number of outstanding shares will have a positive effect on EPS relatively soon after the reverse split happens. Sure a dip in the share price and it will probably trade sideways for a few months but long term it is healthy for GE.
"GE has just been awarded $500K to build COVID-19 detecting microchip.....I believe their Global Research Centre (GRC) can accomplish this. If canines can accomplish it, it is simply a matter of replicating this ability. COVID-19 must have a air-borne signature and thus be detectable...just like a carbon monoxide detector, etc.Given they isolate the signature and then build a detector, this could be a real game changer for GE and for the all people.https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/national-institute-of-health-awards-500k-grant-to-general-electric-to-build-covid-detecting-microchip"

is GE will reverse stock ?.
Guess next announcement they are going to cut 20% of their work force.
"GE is up 22% since Tusa reinstated his $5 price target and up 283% off that target. How does one look investors in the face when he is so far off the mark. It like a bad gambler that keep betting thinking he is going to win it all back. Once Aviation picks up, it could be lights out for Tusa."
"I was gay in High School 1980, hardest thing ever in my life."

"Tusa no longer GE's overlord, apparently...obviously. Buy low today!"
I voted against the proposed reverse stock split 8-fold. Does anyone know what the the final vote was.
"This is just an idea and not sure how good or probables is but what Culp spends the $40B they got to pay down $25B of debt and the rest buying back shares. In doing so they may not need to do RS which will boost stock price both ways. Reducing shares and increasing demands while cleaning the balance sheet and saving on interest. From other hand if economy goes forward and aviation picks up, GE will be in great position with stock price likely above $30"
"With this sinking ship the SS General electric. We are taking on water Captain Culp, Our pumps are barely able to keep up. Culp.."" O.K. men we have to lighten the weight of the ship, throw the pumps over the side"""

now back at start... and up soon to 15$ like I said
"Blocked from posting the press release, but it says the reverse stock split will be proxy voted on at the Annual Meeting on May 4th, and may take place anytime in the one year following that."
"Been on the GE train for 22 years, buying the dips all the way down to bring the cost of share average to around 23 / share. With the reverse split, I am reading that 7 of 8 shares I now own will be taken away. Yes the value at the time of split will not change, but am still in the red. Now with less shares, it will be a longer time to get up to even. Why would I as an individual investor approve this? I'm sure there are many others like me, who loaded up in order to get to even sooner. I have been waiting for this turnaround for a long time, enjoying this current share price and company strength improving. Any thoughts to share here, or am I missing something. All I see is items that include institutional investors, not individual investors."

BIOPHARMA SELL was a clear evidence Culp was STE@LING FROM GE SHAREHOLDERS, HELPING T00SA CAUSE.. Sold BKR STRONGEST Balance sheet in Oil service, for dirt cheap when oil was negative for few days in history.. Other small places sold.. Why DOLD ASSETS, Combined those assets were PROFFITTING F.CASH.FLOW $$4#$%$ BILLION, WHY SELL.. Debt, Assets are meant to make money, these Debts and Assets of GE WAS NAKING UP TO $$5 BILLION, SOO WHY SOLD, because Culp CEO, CFO outsiders came in to serve outsiders the JPM T00sa cause.. I really love JPM, but Me as a GE SHAREHOLDER HAVE TO CARE ABOUT GE SHAREHOLDERS, and speak up.They first took from GE, NBC UNIVERSAL, CNBC, so GE would have no defending media mouth, against FALSE NEGATIVE ATTACKS... Its all a RIGGED GAME, and little guys hv no chance.."

Surging jobs will sweep investors into GE this week. Watch and learn!
I am long on ge happy to see the upgrades it was matter of time the best company in the history got into troubles but now the rise from the ashes 30 dollars in three years buy today
amused by all of the new money coming in. Belly up and buy some GE boys. woo hoo
"GE is a company who intentionally mislead the shareholders. While Larry is doing the best to right the ship, when he leave will the company go back to their evil accounting system? I just do not trust GE"
should've known when the stock dropped yesterday from14 that that was a sign people in the know knew earning were bad. if they knew they would be good G.E would have been up big time yesterday
I like what I'm seeing. This support above $13 means we'll see a slow climb into the $14s in anticipation of better Q2 results.
If this company could earn money there would be no reason for a reverse split. It is the WORST idea and it effectively killed the stock
"BA is up over 5%. GE should follow. Plus, GE should rebound another 5% from this week's crazy selling. Let's see GE close up over 10% today.Ready and set for launch.Go, GE!Good luck, longs."

"Two very important things just happened....Reverse Split - 97 % or 8,536,000,000 shareholders want the reverse split.Me too.the last 264,000 shares or 3% of the outstanding stock voted against the reverse split. The reverse split definitely makes perfect sense to almost everyone. Everyone got it . Onto another even more interesting thought....Culp had two goals. The Board granted him a bonus to be paid in stock in 2024 if he stayed and the stock hit certain prices.If the stock hit $25.12 a share - he would get 9,872,611 shares (worth $248 million)If the stock hit $33.34 a share - he would get 13,797240 shares (worth $460 million)Then they dropped the goal down to half, but kept the shares awarded the same. So it mostly is the price he has to reach - not the amount of shares awarded which would remain constant.I am excited because that means Larry Culp will have the get the price up to either $25.12 or $33.34 a share lasting for a month in the next 34 months.He said today - but nobody really heard it - that in 2023 Renewables is on track to have $3 billion free cash flow. As I said in an earlier post, it is mathematically possible for GE to move to that $31 price in the next 2 years. Aviation $6.8 billion FCF, Medical 3 billion FCF, Renewables $3 billion FCF, and Power $3 billion FCF = $16 billion FCF. $16 billion x 23 times = $36.80 stok price.I am even more sure since yesterday that it will happen now!written by:Gene (not the ""G"", ""GE to 0"" or ""Gregg"" who is also posting under the same sign)"
I was planning to buy more GE as soon as I could raise more cash. Now I'll wait till after the reverse-split for the inevitable dip. Same thing happened to me with SCR recently. It's all psychological.
"we all back in office 5/15/2021, I will fly back to my office.... same as my collegues .."
actually my neighbor's kids lemonade stand made more money last year than GE. and they aren't asking for 333 million
relax J J
Price drop from $107 to $105 . GE is adjusting for the split. My guess is $80 at split.
I once purchased a stock that went up everyday...Then the alarm clock went off and I awoke from my dream...
Going to be some great deals for folks that have some - wait for it - dry powder!
"With the ambitious electric vehicle momentum going forward, there is also going to going to be great demand for megawatts of clean energy. One key player that will be able to provide clean and carbon neutral energy will be $GE. Unlimited Megawatts of Power from wind turbines!"

"Institutions day trade this thing EVERYDAY! Where do you thin all of the volume comes from? 1000 shares traders? LOL Quit acting like this RS is nothing but a way to limit the little guy. It is a last ditch effort from a dying company to save itself. It is NO surprise this was put together after all of the upgrades and supposed ""good"" news. Including the lame merger news that only extends the pain for a while longer. Too many pikers in here that think they know how markets work."
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A majority of shareholders at the General Electric Co annual general meeting rejected the pay packages for named executive officers, including CEO Larry Culp, whose compensation for 2020 tallied $73.2 million.According to preliminary results, 57.7% of shareholders rejected General Electric's pay packages, a strong rebuke to executives of the industrial company, which is in the middle of a challenging turnaround.""While we are disappointed with the preliminary results of the vote, we value and respect the views of the shareholders,"" the company said after the vote. ""The board will take those views into the consideration as we evaluate executive compensation.""The shareholders' vote is advisory, not binding.Later in the meeting, Culp said the company has no plans to increase the dividend at this time in response to shareholder questions.(Reporting by Jessica DiNapoli in New York and Rajesh Kumar Singh in Chicago; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)"
Morgan Stanley just raised the price target on GE to $17 ahead of investor day on March 10th. Tony Balooga suggested today on the Apple board that he may raise his price target on GE to $20 by August. Yikes!
Did the reverse split of shares get approved by shareholder vote?
"I haven't heard any logic or mental reasoning from GE on why the Reverse Split is a good thing to do now. I have picked up a little perception from this MB and other readings. Some speculative info is out there but where is the story from corporate. As shareholders, we own this company and deserve to know what it's all about when someone is messing around with our property."
Looks like my $12.08 may be a success.

Honestly I approve of the deal with Aercap but the reverse stock split feel like its the opposite approach of what you want now. Short term its going to see more volatility and long term less investors going into the stock

"Did any longs actually read the earnings report? GE burned Hundreds of Millions in Q1, yet they've increased compensation packages for Exec's by the nearly the same amount. And to top it off, There going to follow up with a 1 for 8 reverse split so they can then immediately dilute the float by allocating new shares to themselves as additional compensation.. Just sick and Criminal!"
"Inflation is the result of the government printing money it doesn't have. To curb inflation, the Fed will be forced to raise interest rates. As interest rates increase GE's pension program will benefit by $2,000,000,000.00 for every .25% increase in rates. A 1% increase in interest rates produces $8,000,000,000.00 per year for the GE pension program."
"Posting Boards are suppose to be informational and bring up different ideas and views.It gets old to see posters say ""GE to O"".That is juvenile and belongs in a game room.So do over 2/3rds of what is said on this board....the facts: GE has $115 billion strong assets and the breakup price would be far higher than the $115 billion.Because of their market share - they are totally essential. If they were broken up, the government would step in and monitor or control any asset sale.Just their military activity is about $15 billion for the Department of Defense. It is irreplaceable.So I just cracked today. I am tired of the heckling and playing on a serious board.I had decided to either get off the board or say what I have thought for the past 6 months.For the first time I received a very informative reply this morning to one of my postings and thought ""there is a real investor out there with real information"". WOW!If the lousy kid conduct keeps up, I will leave the board.Everyone can keep doing what is happening in Washington DC- distortion and be-littling.People on this board have money at risk. They want information, not junk comments by ""kids"" and hecklers"". These hecklers don't sound like they have a dime invested in GE.Get the ""children"" off the board or make them support why they feel the way they do.Quoting Steven Tuss is nothing credible.So give me facts and I will read and evaluate.But the pac-man games just needs to end."
"Looks like bears are trying hard to create a technical bearish pattern for GE. Last Friday bears pushed GE touched 50 days moving average. Monday bulls moved GE above the average, but Today GE pushed down under the price again even Dow index bounced back to be positive. Looks like a bearish force are trying to cap GE under the price. It is important for GE to stay above 50 days moving average in near term. GE needs to stay above $13.18 next few days and move back to $13.5 areas to maintain bullish pattern.That being said, GE’s long term bullish pattern still looks great and fundamental also supports the long term bullish pattern.Thus, we, as long term investors, can try to accumulate more shares when the short term bears pushed the price lower.I just opened several limited orders @$13, $12.75 and $12.5 to buy. Let’s see whether my order will be filled or not. Good luck to all."
If the RSS is approved GE will tank again. They crushed this stock 2 months ago when RSS was first announced. Wrote call options. Hope it’s called away.
"Hey BAGGIES, how many millions of dollars did Culprit get while you are left holding the bag? You all don't get it. Culprit is lining his pockets on the backs of GE shareholders."
GE should have 1 for 4 reverse split. Not 1 for 8 reverse split.
GE recovering from the recent plunge. I'm guessing the at the reverse split the stock will be around $120 per share. Stock will most likely drop after the split. What's the guess on what it drops to after that? $112? And then the surge back up again.
"Lots of bullpucky going on with the ""EXPERTS""Motley Fools Lee Samaha took a spin on GE using a terrible comparisonWho cares about comparing market cap plus debt (EV formulas) to get a comparison figure looking at competitors in the four areas GE is excelling on. All of the competitors do NOT CLOSELY have comparable size or scale.... Kind of like turning a power boat around compared to turning the Queen Mary. Completely different things! And counting the tires on the car and adding them us is about as foolish as adding capitalization to debt to get a EV figure. Who cares????The facts are:GE is a work in progress. Added to that change in the General Electric fundamental direction we have just passed through the eye of the needle as 12 months on corona lock down should pulverize most businesses.It did not pulverize General Electric. How much strength they show....But here is the real comparison....Use free Cash Flow. Everyone seems to thing dollars in pockets matters and planning, investment, research, and future are drags on the basic company. Do not believe that FCF is the real test - but lets look at FCF....Aviation will return to the 2019 FCFof $6.8 billion and not too long from now.Healthcare will maintain their 2020 FCF of $3 billion.Renewables is the question mark. If you take a potential 5% profit on $15 billion sales you get $750 million.That number could be larger if they reach 8% profit like Vestas has on perhaps a $20 billion sales this year which is possible with GE sales pouring in. That number of 8% x $20 billion would then be FCF $1.6 billion. Renewables are the real wildcard.Power is the next wild card. GE has a lot of customers all over the world not abandoning their existing power grid. GE in 2017 had FCF of 1.95 billion. A loss in 2018 and a modest FCF $386 million in 2019 were not good things. Last year after selling off coal, power division was only able to squeeze out FCF of $274 million. Lets see if Culp with his newer energy efficient products can push GE Power to new heights.So the second huge question mark on where power will land in 2021. Because I have total faith - I place my money on a really solid GE turnaround. GE has larger sales in all segments. GE has deeper pockets. GE has more talent. GE is better situated worldwide to reach key buyers in all segments. GE is in a rebuilding phase coming out of the pandemic.What that all translates to is a 2021 FCF that may reach $1 a share or a $20 a share stock price. That is calculated at 20 times earning. For the more speculative crowd, that number could reasonably reach 25 times earnings or $25 a share.Watch out!!2022 will be a bombshell. It isn't too far off for serious investors. GE could easily return to FCF over $13 billion and $1.50 a share. That would make the $30 price very believeable. And the stock price can possibly much higher. I wonder how 2023 will look? beyond awesome?GE is headed right and all the experts with all their figures cannot tell you more.Using oddball formulas like EV (market cap plus debt) is a real distraction from real actual and potential numbers. Either you believe in GE and the chances made to get them to reach new levels - or you are speculating the best is now and the future is much slower.I prefer the glass half full - not half empty."
"Apparently Tusa agrees with me. He maintains his target of $5, say that $12 is unsustainable and has to cut in half. At $5, a reverse split makes sense.mead20146 hours ago$GE conversationReverse split puts share price at over $100 at current price. Too high in my opinion. One way or another, price will drop. That is why I sold. If it drops to $50-$60 post split or $6 -$8 presplit, I am back in. Otherwise I move on to other opportunities. GE has never been investor friendly."
"The announcement of the RS proposal was absolutely created to destract investors from GE’s biggest achievement of the last 20 years. Worth at least $2+ dollars a share could have generated a panic short squeeze which short holders like Chase would not have been able to handle. Solution? Come out with with this fictitious announcement, let the short covering happen in order and once Chase and friends join the party move the $20. This, again, is the last boat for short covering below $20.Stay greedy my friends"
Why do so many disagree with the reverse split? Serious question.
"insider buying just the beginning, The Year of the CULP and $75 billion buying power for M&A will bring a $30 stock price"
"For those who have truly invested/traded their hard earned money in General Electric Bull or Bear, please entertain this thought: Currently, the best dialogue about this company is not here. The best source is currently available on GE's website free of charge. Listen to Culp, the vice president, and the CFO discuss: the core businesses (Renewables + Power + Aviation + Health), headwinds, tailwinds, guidance, revenue, profit, orders, factoring, debt, goals, inflation, losses, timetables, concerns, the pandemic, the reopening, positive cash flow, so good I say it twice, positive cash flow, expectations, possibility of future deals with great specificity & visual aids. Moreover, you can hear tough questions from leading analyst from credible financials ( i.e. I heard the infamous Tusa for the 1st time) challenge the BIG 3 from GE. As an investor who is long, it was very insightful and informative.No disrespect to anyone here; but no post, (certainly not mine), can express the true state of affairs for GE as well as that call. So I will not attempt to parrot snippets of the call or insult those who do: bear or bull. I just want to encourage folks to get the proper information and decide for yourselves.Thats my 2 cents and I still like the company.Best to all."

1-8 reverse split is what bankrupt companies do to consolidate when their stock price is penny's. It's as if GE decided to come up with the only thing that could have brought their stock down to below $10.00.

Want to look at what a RS does — then take a look at the one week chart. And this is only the beginning. Just can’t figure out who or why anyone one or entity would now invest in GE ? Puzzling.

Folks get ready GE will sky rocket to 3 digit figure soon.
"GE will close around $13.5 this Friday and $14 in one month. GE is still in the early stage of recovery. Using any weakness to accumulate the shares if you are a long term investor. GE’s aviation business will recover after pandemic. With the recent consolidation, GE is becoming leaner and thinner. Surely, GE’s future is bright. Thus, using any weakness to buy.

I bought the ETF JETS early and it is up huge yet GE is dead on the runway....who is CULPable....Larry Is. Boolean
"According to preliminary results, 57.7% of shareholders rejected General Electric's pay packages, a strong rebuke to executives of the industrial company, which is in the middle of a challenging turnaround."
"@jj....20 YEARS EXPERIENCE, EVERY TIME I SOLD, PRICE NEVER CAME DOWN FOR ME TO BUY BACK... Your instruction to sell is a TRICK TO SHAKE LITTLE GUYS.. YOU AND LIKE BASHERS A PAID TO DO THIS JOB.."
"pullbacks, correction whatever offer opportunities,"
Reverse split of 0 shares equal 0 shares. Just saying.
Anybody on this board been here a few years? Only long term veterans please answer.....has this stock ever had an UP day?
Stock prices go up and down. GE is still the same company I bought 6 months ago. The reasons why I bought GE remain as true today as they were 6 months ago. I see the drop as a buying opportunity. The possibility of a reverse split might be a bookkeeping trick but long-term it doesn't change the potential of GE growing in the very near future. Market Mentality is a strange beast.
"Wow actually having a good day.. bought the $14 June calls 9 days ago.. if GE hits $15, looking at a solid double up, maybe more depending on time value"
"Reverse stock split, horrible for long term investors. Would you pay $104 per share?"
steveby the stock exchange definition GE is not a tech company.it is grouped in the industrial class of manufactures.having said that - GE is deeply involved using tech for everything they do and tech is part of every device they manufacture like MRI scanners for hospitals.great question
I case of reverse split dividends are calculated proportionally to split ratio - no gain there - all and all its bad idea for shareholders. Also the company issue a new shares after rs - it a way to wipe out shareholders.
"And by the way, news is relevant to the discussions here. ;-)"
When is going the reverse split in affect?
It came down to 12.91 this morning and bounced back right away same as last week. It seems the bottom at that price. The earnings day is always a big trading day and the price swing is normal. I don't believe it will close in red today. The earnings is as good and expected. Have no double will be above $14 this week.
Maybe Tesla should buy GE to power their cars with Renewable Energy! 
"Sold my 5,000 shares of GE this morning....."
The green deal is a big deal. Culp's leadership will be the engine
"THANK YOU JPM, I AM ONLY HUMAN, Sometimes reacted for being constantly hurt last 21 years investing in Wlkst Market only, ONLY DEPOSITING, POURING IN, NEVER TOOK OUT ANY MONEY, NO Privileges, simply being a target the whole 21 yrs, entire investing history.. So as a human it effects, so I react. THANK YOU JPM AND MARKET.."

Another breakout is just around the corner. $GE to the $20's this year!
"Volume fell on the last day by -7 million shares and in total, 45 million shares were bought and sold for approximately $611.10 million. You should take into consideration that falling volume on higher prices causes divergence and may be an early warning about possible changes over the next couple of days."
Culp's reverse split just bought him a lot of animosity

ge goes up 3 cents when dow up over 300 but down 10 times that on bad days and its doing great. lol
35 cent drop on a bad day. Keep shorting and you will get what you deserve. Pay your bills before shorting GE at this price. You are going to need money for not being long...
"yahoos averaged 12 months price target for ge now raised to 14.04'ge is expected to confirm 2 cents earnings / share by the end of april.and continuing improvement later this yearas with every quarter, next quarter will be a good indicator of ges performance and progress"

GE is not overpriced when you consider how off the chart the rest of the stockmarket is. Go GEE!
"Best thing that ever happens is double whammyreverse split takes the stock to perhaps $104 a sharethe AerCap deal reduces debt 24 million more and gives Culp 111 million shares to sell.If AerCap doesn't go broke - GE has a big great deal. Culp plans to sell part or all of the 111 million AerCap shares.Couldn't wait for the small 100 share investor to evaporate. That is causing a 5%-10% swingin the daily stock moves - up and down. Just look at today with 135 million shares sold in 90 minutes and a 94 point downward market swing. Pure FEAR.For real investors all the above could not matter less.Fundamental GE business is firmly rooted on the 4 divisions (Aviation, Renewables, Health, Power).All of these divisions have great market position. Each division exceeds $20 billion in sales (Aviation closer to $35 billion). Each could really contribute to FCF going forward if you do not measure in 202 quarters and instead measure in a couple of years. Most of these divisions if they were standing alone would dwarf most other companies on the stock exchange in pure sales volume.... Profits will follow. Obviously measured in days as a person owning GE is a ridiculously poor bet. Long term - awesome!Once again you are seeing analysts shout obvious sightly thought out opinions. They continue to show poor judgement. Some say better place to invest exists (bitcoin, Tesla, AMC, Gamestock for example). Wouldn't trade one GE share for any of these outright gambles. Some say GE is in trouble. Ridiculous! At $70 billion gross 2021 sales and $45 billion in the bank for use any way they seek to use it - GE is in exceptional condition to take a severe upward trek!Some analysts say too G has too much debt but ignore the $70 billion paid back against the earlier total. Culp is delivering and the company has managed lots of serious debt replacement in the past 24 months.Some say the firm (GE) is selling off the parts and there will be nothing left. Any serious fool can see that there will be 4 firmly exceptional divisions going forward. All will be future profitable divisions of GE. Any and all will dominate in their markets - including Power which owns 50% of the world market and has new low pollution generators to replace older models.....And some analysts cannot understand that taking the stock up 8 clicks(8-1 Reverse split) comes closer to $104 a share - joining other important stocks. A stock rolling in the mud at $6 to $13 is not very exciting for serious investors. And has anyone thought about FCF of $10 billion (totally possible in just Aviation and Health not counting Renewable and Power results) )with only 1 billion in outstanding stock makes earnings much more exciting going forward. At 20 times earnings- the stock would be trading at $200. At 25 times earnings the stock would be trading at $250. Doesn't that excite anyone or are we in a sea of fools?So let the stock tank today and recover tomorrow. At 135 million shares traded in 90 minutes - there is genuine panic in the market. Fear today - greed tomorrow.It scares the bejesus out of small investors and short buyers - and rightfully so. That leaves it to the rest of the serious long termed buyers.."
"Hey BAGGIES listen up, GE is trading at 56x and 26x this year and next year's earnings. Is that cheap to you? It is not to me. GE is NOT a value play and has no earnings momentum. It's the worst of both worlds, so buy some puts on GE here and protect the gains that you have in your other winners. 1Q earnings will be a miss."

"One of the BOD (Trian) was just on CNBC ... the 5 minute interview was poorly done and focused on usual/mundane balance sheet stuff we already know ... literally gave 20 seconds to the RS and the explanation was simply that they wanted a float that was more reflective of the business size ... he gave no sense that the decision was going to be reversed, so I just sold ... I think the SP was heading to $18 by the end of May, sad"
"New Jersey’s first utility-scale offshore wind farm powered by General Electric’s 12 MW turbine.Utilities rapidly expanding renewable assets. Wind projects totaling 34,757 MW were under construction or in advanced development at the end 2020."
"Two excellent questions are posted today on the GE Board.The first is about the reverse stock split.Generally, when the number of outstanding shares changes - it signals a way to pay down debt.Think of the United States Treasury. They are broke but they keep issuing bonds to pay debt. At that pace they will never catch up.Looking back to 2010 General Electric in 2010 had 11 issued million issued shares. In 2016 General Electric had just 10 million outstanding shares.In 2018 as Culp came in. Flaherty had been buying back stock and he spent a fortune (probably spent $20 billion to buy back 1.4 billion shares) reducing outstanding shares to 8.6 million outstanding shares.In order to pay some kind of dividend, in 2018 General Electric gave a weird stock split. For every 100 shares you could now have 104 shares - a sort of dividend.The stock price during these last eleven years is even more up and down. Dec 2010 - $13.40; Dec 2012 - $16.50; Dec 2014 - $21.53; Dec 2016 - $28.24; Dec 2018 - $6.82; Dec 2019 - $10.96; and Dec 2020 - $11.08.And along came the virus/pandemic and it was a real game changer for General Electric. Gone was the $6.6 billion profit cash cow in their Aviation that kept the price around supported at around $12. The rest of the company was bleeding to death, except medical. By 2018 GE Management knew they were in deep trouble. The 2010 stock was at $13.40 and had sunk to $6.82. It was precariously low. That was the time EVERY GENERAL ELECTRIC STOCKHOLDER should not have slept nights.The 2018 really low earnings (loss, not profit) could NEVER keep supporting a generous dividend, a pension fund, over $130 billion interest paying off debt, 330,000 employees on the payroll, and way too many outstanding shares at 8.8 billion.Talk of breaking up the company was a real possibility.To do a turnaround of such a giant company - the first and most important thing is to change the Board of Directors. They did that and the new Board fired Flanerty and brought in Larry Culp. That was a full size gamble. Other than Culp's 15 years excellent performance at Danafar - he was jumping into a 5 times bigger world wide very scattered and diversified company in a total mess. Few would accept such a challenge. Culp did NOT do this for the money. He saw something others could not see.... A path to righting the ship.It took Culps first 18 months to just stop the company from crashing up and down. We now know in hindsight the decisions he made were excellent Forget the Steve Tusa and John Inch and the Chuck Watkins or any other analyst. All they want to do is look bacwards and criticize. They simply have it all wrong. The past nine months Culp has started a very solid recovery plan. I doubt we will ever see anything as bad as the past 10 years. I expect to see the going forward to be so much progress that it will be written up in years future as a study on what not to do and what to do.Now for the 8:1 Reverse Stock Split.Culp and the Board agree the best thing to stabilize the stock is to reduce the outstanding stock shares. It has zero to do with a failing company.They know this huge stock overhang is dangerous. Any good manager knows that taking an 8 times stock reduction will better match the upcoming price. It allows the company to look wealthier at $100 a share instead of $13 a share. It gets rid of a lot of small investors and even halts the many short sellers. GE is #16 in size as an industrial company. You wouldn't know it by the stock price. GE going forward will join the ranks of many other giant industrial firms like Honeywell, 3 M, Raytheon, Catapillar, and Boeing. As long as they are not diluting the existing stockholder base - it is a very clean and clever plan.A lot of the today GE investors keep saying the 8:1 Reverse Split show weakness and announces GE is a loser. Nothing could be further from the truth. You don't see the 1,740 funds holding 60% of the stock selling off. They know that the reverse split will be better going forward. The higher the stock price is - the more prestige there is. Think of Berkshire Hathaway where most people could only buy a share or possibly two.On to the second point that the $230 million bonus is unfair. Fact: Culp will not collect it until he leaves the company and then after 2025 and then only will it be in treasury stock which will not affect any stockholder. The reduction from $32 to $16.64 is fine with me. I have no concern on rewarding him since $220 million compared to the many $billions coming up is going to look like ""chump change"" in the rear-view mirror.The many hecklers on the Board are simply treating this as a PlayStation fun arcade game and they goad and they cajole and they tell dumb jokes and they ridicule. They mean nothing. They certainly contribute even less. But it is a free country. Anyone can be up there polluting this serious informative Board ...."
Stock trade dn 7% from Monday high Why am I not surprised?
JPM STEALING MANIPULATION UNDERWAY...
All take a breath...relax and take a look at GE 1 month chart. What do you see? I see a step ladder of higher lows and higher highs. Today does not break the pattern...we are at the low point of the next highest low...next move is next higher high...everyone just chill AND...be Happy!
This stock will be in much better shape in the next year or two.
I'll bet anyone 25 pushups this closes red today!

Waterfall Algo at work...
GOOOOOOOOOOOD Morning to All GE Investors!!! :) :) :)Fever has broken and we start fresh with new stronger hands now holding all the shares that were just purchased over the last 2 days...Love it !!!
"I am new to all this. But if there isna reverse split, if you had 8 shares you will have 1, but what happens if you have 1? Could someone please explain it to me?"
Buy more GE is on sale going higher
Who Shorted at $12.95 last Friday? News Flash...your are still in the Red ! 
This stock will be 16$ by end of this week!
"Looking at the 6 month chart, GE stock has basically gone nowhere since early March, from what I can tell, about the same time the RS was announced."
"First Quarter is traditionally GE's weakest and we just passed it. Next up are it's strong Quarters 2, 3 and 4. Expect heavy buying from institutions as we head into these quarters earnings reports. Just MHO. GLTA to all GE Investors. And Remember, who are the Baggies? Correct, GE Shorts!"
"I just read the following, unfortunately the shareholder vote is not binding and still up to the discretion of the BOD.https://www.reuters.com/business/general-electric-shareholders-reject-ceo-larry-culps-pay-2021-05-04/"
"Tusa has spent the last 6 months traveling the globe to dig up dirt on GE, and all he found was 1 line item in the balance sheet of a parter that GE has an ownership stake in . That's the news."
"Hope this 3 year fiasco is NOT to sell off GE's crown Jewel, the Aviation Business, to some PE backed investors...Rolls Royce , once a crown Jewel of a high end luxury auto name and Aircraft Engine design is no longer a company by itself!If Culp decides to leave because of the compensation package issue, GE will crash big from this level.."
"Culp is really not worth the price GE pays him, My 4 yr old son could do better. The fact this Stock isn't at $10 or lower right now is a testament to how gullible some investors are."
I don't like the overall market action the last couple days. GE is holding up pretty well all things considered but it would not surprise me to see us close right around 13.00 today given the number of open calls and puts that were sold at that level and expire today.
$13.75 at open!
Imagine now when the DOW drops 400 pts. Bad decision.
Hey Shorts... I've decided to listen to CEO Culp concerning GE. When your cable bill is overdue it has a tendency to cloud your judgment... 
Who (FAA or Boeing) will inspect the airplanes is meaningless to operation.
"If you are long term investors, this is a great opportunity to accumulate. What caused this wave of dropped? 1. Bears use the reverse split as excuse to make the first push, shorted the stock.2. Short term traders who bought GE last week saw the short term up trend momentum damaged, sold their shares to take profits.3. Technical program traders saw the pattern breaking down 10-moving average also joined to short the stock.If you listen to the conference call, all are positive news. I am gain more confidence after I saw the GE’s price movement quickly moved from $12 to $14.5 last week. It made me believe GE is alive again. GE could reach $16 due to the trend momentum if the company didn’t announce the reverse split. This has temporarily caused the up trend to trade sideways in short term. With GE’s recovery is in progress, the up trend momentum will come back. When that comes, nothing will stop it go higher. GE will be best stock which positions for next few year’s recovery. Thus, accumulate some cheap shares during this wave of drop."
"dip buy. renewables, jet engines, green soon."
"I noticed that a few of the ""Nostradamuses"" who kept shouting and predicting that GE would drop to $4.00 or @5.00 are absent today. I never listened to them because I never took advice from message boards. Message boards are for entertainment only."
"I think the big boys want to keep the GE Reverse split share price in the 80 to 100 dollar range. That seems to be a good stock value where big buyers like to kick in for growth. Check ITT, Xylem, Apple, JP Morgan, and many others. Even Tesla took off in this range in spite of no profits.Management may have a point if this is true, plus thought of rejoining the Dow Jones."
It is a trecherously rigged market. Only way to stay on top is to sell Covered Call Options every week..
"Yesterday the dip at $12.80 now GE is , $13.16 glad I bought some then. Still long term great price now, two weeks ago it was $14. GE. we love being called baggies"
"All told if GE hits its debt-reduction plans, $13.2 billion to $14.8 billion in EBITDA, and its stated aim of high-single-digit FCF margin in 2023, it will be a company with investment-grade debt trading at around 17 times FCF in 2023. That's attractive for a company with a multi-year growth opportunity. That's the key takeaway from the recent investor meetings."
TSA numbers climbing. Cmon vaccine rollout. Let’s do this.
In 2019 GE had a 35% correction from June to Sept ... Being Cautious here.. With the impending RS decisions...
S/o to the guy who posted “just closed my eyes and bought 10k shares” back when we were below 7
How much do you think this stock will drop the morning of the 8/1 reverse stock split?
The push to $16.68 is ferocious. Getting there before RS will make way for new shares issue to raise cash. Nice plan.
"Now everybody is a Culp hater, but before he was the GE savior. Get a life people, and pick a side. He is a good CEO and will bring GE back to 20.00+++ before the split. Wait for some positive news....Buy GE...!!!"
"Please remember that Larry Culp has lost over $31,000,000 in the last 2 weeks. He can't be a happy camper."
Vote No on Reverse Stock Split
This will soon be at $80. Then back down from there.
Yesterday (Saturday) Elon Musk tweeted...”Doge day afternoon”Speculation is that he placed an “e” on the end of dog as a way of telling us to buy GE
Why is there a vote and recommendation FOR a reverse split???
"Volume slows down, institutions sucked up the cheapies. Now a traders paradise for a little while. Then everybody will understand the substance of the deal whilst business picks up. Institutions to enjoy both effects...."
"General Electric (GE) – GE shares gained 2.2% in the premarket after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock to a Street-high of $17 per share from $13 a share, based in part on a possibly significant recovery in GE’s aviation segment."
What's the date of stock reverse split? Can someone post a reply?
No pop means big drop to me
right back where it opened!
Out of this stock or holding? Which is bettet option?
"GE still has some big problems, but what if China places a 20 billion dollar MAX-order and Southwest Places a 20 billion MAX -order. That's what i'm talking about. It's gold Jerry gold. Food for thought."
"As long as it is a gain, I'll take. at the end of the month it will look nice."
"@HARVEY... You can bet there is 1+ BILLION Short OFF THE BOOK. There is no way GE Stays down this far this long without 10--20% short.. 1% short what is shown, that's like AAPL, AMZN, GOOG.."
"Theory behind Revese Split No Fundamental changes, they just want to reduce float , giving more credibility to company based o share price. It has nothing but to Go up Now and even after Reverse split."
"GE’s price raise to $13.5 range. It turns to technical very bullish in mid-term. If it stays around $13.5 for few days, GE will test $13.85. If that is the case, GE has a chance to raise above $14 next week."
"GE’s wind turbines in 2020 jumped to number one installations. It was 4th rank in 2019. Here is a quoted rom a wind turbines analysis report: ""GE carved out the largest market share in 2020 in a record-breaking year for global wind capacity additions, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF).Developers commissioned 96.3GW of wind turbines globally in 2020, compared with 60.7GW the previous year, most of which (94%) were on land.The latest data from BNEF shows that GE emerged as the global number one spot in terms of capacity installed, with Goldwind in second place, Vestas in third and Envision in fourth place....""Green energy is one of current government policy. GE is positioned to have a lot of win next 4 years."
I will consider buying after reverse split at 20 to 25% below reverse split price of 106.00 at current price. RS always drop.
"Best words and phrases used on this message board: hope, I believe, if only, maybe, I trust, promises, could be, if only, what if. Most used numbers: 14 15 16 17 20 25 30 35. Most recent pps $13 - $13.50. Good luck. You’ll need it."
General Electric in its detailed 2021 outlook statement expects to produce serious free cash flow during 2021. It will use to pay down debt and improve its balance sheet. thats what investors and analysts are looking for.opinions mixed until further notice.culp needs to prove he will deliver.
"I have no fear of a RS, I had one with Duk, 1-2 and one with E-Trade, 1-10, and both worked out for the better. I cut my pizza in 6 slices instead of 8 and still have the same amount. NYUK NYUK NYUK!"
"With careful evaluation, I like the idea of the Reverse Split. After thinking longer, a Regular Split 2 or 3 for 1 might do even better. Depends on one's time frame, and it's a psychological issue."
In less than thirty days GE stock will be nine dollars.
Before the reverse split

"The long-term earnings potential for this company are dramatically higher,"" said Dan Babkes, a partner at Pzena Investment Management that has a substantial holding in GE.Analysts at William Blair expect GE's valuation to double over the next three to four years.

Ok folks today party is over. Manipulators in charge now.

Unscientific poll. What stock will end 2021 higher?? GE  or Ford  Thanks for your input and best wishes!
sell GE and buy Ford
1 for 8 Reverse? Whiskey-Tango-Fox...Guess the BOD didn't realize it was the retail investor that brought this stock from $6 to $14?
"GE is down again on a nice green day...This has become a pattern for GE that is goes down when the market is up...with all the good news out there, it should be up today but it is not........no reason for this..."
"GE should layoff any employees who have been there 15+ years, and backfill those positions with newly acquired, undocumented American workers."
GE sold off more Baker Hughes shares. Company getting smaller. Not the GE you once knew. Great stock to continue shorting.
I told you. Green day
"congratulation to all longs, blockbuster deal for GE.(Reuters) - General Electric Co said on Wednesday Ireland's AerCap Holdings NV would acquire its aircraft-leasing business in a deal that will help reduce the company's debt by $30 billion.The deal is valued at more than $30 billion, including about $24 billion in cash, an about 46% stake in the combined company and $1 billion paid in AerCap notes and/or cash upon closing.The business, known as GE Capital Aviation Services, or GECAS, is one of the world's biggest jet-leasing companies and leases passenger aircraft made by companies including Boeing Co and Airbus SE."

"Does it not make sense that if one lowers the goal threshold from $31 for a $232,000,000 performance award down 46% to $16.68, shouldn't the award be reduced 46% also?"
And remember: Baggies= GE Shorts! 
"You want to know how I know that GE isn't closing above $12.52 or below $12.48 today? Because, There is still over 30k contracts of the $12.50 call @.04cents and 12k of the $12.50 puts @.09cents open that expire worthless at market close today.These greedy MM's aren't giving up a dime they don't have to!"
So one analyst can just say he has a target price for GE and stock goes down to $6? Is that how stock market works?
Nothing new here. GE beat on top line. Speculators just looking for any excuse to sell.
"GE spokesman talking on CNBC right now, only thing anyone wants to hear this guy say is that they will not do a 1 for 8 share reverse split! That's all investors want to hear!"
Will be down $0.80 or more today..
"Rumors, Ge will turn around to $34.00 a share."
Could be a nice pop due to the CFO's presentation tomorrow.
"Culp was crystal clear today1) no dividend planned or contemplated going forward2) vote was 97% to reverse split 8:0 per management request3) no mergers or very small mergers for the next couple of years.4) all 4 divisions showing good steady growth in sales and in margins.5) says correctly rebuilding is a slow, slow careful process.6) the free cash flow for Renewables will be at least $3 billion by 20237) all GE parts are coming back - the company is showing nice progress8) as the pandemic gets reduced - Aviation is fast recovering9) worldwide pandemic vaccines are far from were it needs to be for full normalcy10) all the GE plants worked for the past 12 months daily during the pandemic11) his projections are minimums. They could go up significantly as time passes this year12) he is not focused on stock price - he is watching GE profits and progressposted by ""Gene"", not ""G"" or ""GE to Zero"" or ""Gregg"" or any other imposter"
"Assets make the difference! GE has assets that are rich and underutilized.....Culp is finding ways to maximize them. Over time, you will see the company have greater and greater performance. Energy will eventually be their primary focus after they IPO medical(which I believe is on the way soon)....then you will see them focus on power....powering planes, powering neighborhoods, transmitting power, protecting power through technology and software, developing new power sources, developing their mini-reactors, etc."
Ghosts of Immelt/Welch back.
CEO highest paid in 2020 - over 72 MILLION while shareholders just go no where. Now GE burning more cash...sure...look at Larry's pay. EXCESSIVE. Boolean
"Long on GE but don't like action into the close. Hopefully, the big boys didn't get a sneak peek!! If so, cash is on the sidelines to take advantage. My gut feel says, have EPS of .04, beating consensus, fcf raised to $4B to $6B, dividend doubled, bought back more shares than anticipated n very bullish remarks on Aviation n Renewable...lets see what happens!!"
Definition of denial: The act of failing to recognize the return of the aviation industry to 2019 levels and above.
Do you want to buy on acquisition news or wait until integration happens and growth begins? Seems like history is about to repeat.
"current ge action is what i expect, no shooting to the moon but a ge performance somewhat in line with improving aviation"
Wait for tomorrow guys
Imagine the Covid all but erased GE's long term disability issue. Little said about this. Wonder if Harry will issue an apology?
"The desperation, dishonesty, and despair on this comment board is making me greedy for more $GE stock, and I'm loading up. $20's this year alone!"
Lot of buying has happened in big lots today by funds

CEO AND BOD made bad move to split the stock it frozen now 12 weeks
Is there any doubt that GE is the leader to bring good things to life at any age and time?Did RS scared you out of your shares?
"GE stock volume has been steadily decreasing with the price trending steady to the down side. Why? Because, on ""Investors"" day GE Management announced a 1 for 8 reverse split, indicating they were no longer interested in the retail ""Investors"" business."

"The year of the CULP!!!!! breaks $20 this month, especially after 4-27 eps ,then forward statement,oh yah the $75 billion in cash might help"
GE will be green soon.
add GE short 1/3 13.50
Buy Ge be happy 20 coming
Cull always is conservative with his numbers on earnings. I say we beat by at least a penny. Guidance will be adjusted to outperform for quarters 2 and 3.
"20000 call at $13.5 were closed yesterday. There are still 30000 call and 8000 put option at struck price $13.5. Looks like GE will close near $13.5 today due to option expiration. From next week option premium, we can predict GE will be very volatile next week."
Mondays have been down days for the market... $13.20 should be good entry point for a short term trade..
That's pretty impressive that General Electric had insider buys Friday
All I want is getting my money back
"Houston, we have launch!"
"You can't see me Texas Turd, I am doing my happy dance right now because the sell off not only let me buy some good options, add to my long position and make some money... it shook out the stock from day traders into long value holders. Mark my words... by August 31st 2021 GE will be at 25.00 PPS..... about a 2X gain from where it is today.... BOOYAH!!!!"
"I tell you what...if GE drops below $6 today, I'll buy everybody pizza!"
Going to $13.50 soon???? Are you kidding me??? It might; however you'll only get your $.01 dividend per share. Whoopppie.... $.01
Two days all small investors bailed out and shares mostly with Big holders. They will not sell and will squeeze it hard. And after reverse split will jump even more as leaps of 10 plus points will be easy with less float as co.pay fundaments are still.sme and infact improved incomes and reduced debt. Shorts after reverse split will be gasping for more oxygen and will eventually sell at way higher prices and book lpsses
Look at the history of the Ford Escape and the history of GE stock.Of which I'd never own either!
GE WILL CLOSE AT 13.12
Chance to buy more shares. It always goes super low before it jumps to the next level. Been watching this for the past 9months.
"Two contracts, Vietnam and Malaysia, will add more dollars to both top and bottom lines in the coming quarters depending on how the accounting is done. If they continue to win more contracts with more countries in Asia down the road, that would bring a lot of good news to GE and investors, especially institutional investors."
all Boeing orders have an out clause-- there are still hundreds of already built planes sitting in storage that need to be moved --Boeing's first priority is to sell the already built planes at a steep discount -- airlines have every incentive to cancel future orders buy the deep discounted already built ones -- the airlines are in no hurry to take delivery on full priced planes yet to be built -- my wife works for American and they are not going to take delivery on any significant number of planes--our fiends oak for United same story there-- watch for the unsold inventory figures as a true tell of GE's operations
I've been through 3 reverse splits. Not one turned out good. Look at ACB. It's still only 1/3 the pre-reverse split price and that happened a long time ago.
"Lol, they're buying as much as you want to sell! Go ahead, sell more lol."
Honestly why I’m posting stuff like this is because I don’t have that much down on it. Only like 1000$. If it goes down a lot I can get cheap shares and really load up on this. Either way. I don’t care where it goes.
Zack turns positive on GE ?
Barclays upgrade GE to Overweight and boost price target.
"Is GE really a safe stock? Look at the chart and believe your eyes, and then laugh at the experts. You will see a roller coaster that finally made $30 over years of a rickety ride and the wheels fell off. That is not what you call a safe stock. Right now it looks like a pay-for-play stock. You pay me $232 million, I will pump it to $16.68."
"There are no pumpers only buyers knowing that the days of GE at 13.00 is over, and soon 20.00+++"
GE harnesses solar to power US
No gain in GE share price for the last 15 months ..Only Traders can make some $$$ from owning GE shares..
Look @ 6 month chart. The day reverse split was announced is very easy to see. It was @ 52 week high when management torpedoed it

Short squeeeeeze...GE closing green today. Shorty baggies running out of diapers.
Look at that beautiful GE chart today!GE Shorts from last Friday are even more in the Red  today.GE Shorts love it DEEP...in the RED  that is! 
"General Electric is a worthless note in my desk drawer. Just a paper that decreases in value day by day. Since 1996 its the same price but is it? The dollar was worth 1.70 in 1996, so this heap of trash is only worth 7.75 in todays money compared to what you bought it then. Crackle in the furnace Immelt and Culp. It is easier for a camel to go through the needles eye.....You focus on YOU, and noone else you sorry piece of ...."
Tesla P/E = 1051 (as of today)...LOL

This is exactly the TOXIC MEN Women have been complaining and fighting against..So, @McGruber, please dont make it worse convoluted by flipping the script and blame the victim, at least not in this case.."
Ge is going back down to $9 per share...that is where the support line.
Bot trading flatline for the rest of the day.. 13.00 -13.01 - 13.02
Thank you GE investors
Shorts own this stock...no money to be made holding long
The giant wakes up. Go GE
20 bucks around the corner
GE s a GOLDMINE!
first questionable move by Culp ...stock will sell a bit
I think you pull the plug on this here and sell. It's going back to 6.00 again. I don't see how it even doubled off that price to begin with aside for some con job by a pump and dump analyst.
"Short at the open dribble down the sp for the rest of the day , cover at the close for a $0.20 to $0.30 profit ..The con game goes on!"
"They offered all of those billions of shares and investors bought them. So why are you trying to erase those shares instead of buying them back? Once the rs/good? news comes out, they will offer shares."
"Almost 2 hours away before market close, Can GE close near $13.5 today?"
"Garabge Electric is at it again!! Business as usual, noting to see here, folks, pass thru"
I think GE is in a great phase right now. Looking ready to run and CEO looks great. BTW I work for GE and am confident this CEO is focused on the balance sheet and creating cash flow for the future. I scooped up 20k more Friday thinking this will hit $16 soon
"I'm currently attending the GE Shareholder Meeting and its not looking good for the Longs, a proposal to cancel the RS was shot down by the Board. Looks like they are going to move forward with their plans to give the retail investors that saved them from Bankruptcy 1 share for every 8 they own."
"J J please stop posting this worthless nonsense. A) Culp will get his bonus B) His contract was just extended C) In the boards mind the shooting down of his bonus was a ""recommendation"" ."
Larry Clup Thanks for doubling the SP in last year. Now go away as to not destroy the progress. Your usefulness has outlived itself
"Pete Najarian stated the RS would be good for the stock and draw in higher end investors that won't buy companies with low share prices of $12 - that is, if it does happen"
"Its scary to think GE RENEWABLE, WIND ENERGY WILL BE BIGGER THAN GE AVIATION CROWN-JEWEL (GE Aviation 2019 responsible for near $$30 BILLION Rev. $$10 BILLION PROFIT).."
"What division will GE sell next? Down to three to choose from, Aviation, Power or Healthcare?Lawrence Culp and GE management want their bonuses."
RECOMMENDATION: The chart is looking awful so don't bite on this unless you are trading. Allow three days to pass for the market to digest this poor result and then look to add and hope that Larry C is fired. Boolean
"Here are the summary of upgrades after the earnings release. Overall all analysts raised price target except Tusa:1. RBC raised from $15 to $162.Argus research raised from $14 to $163. credit Suisse raised from $13 to $144. Deutche Bank raised from $14 to $15Thus, overall are positive. The consensus is GE’s long term outlook is very positive!"
up graded to 17 like that will make it so-- up grades are amateurs pablum
Boeing needs to consider safety and quality as primary focus not share price
$GE has split at least five to six times since 1975 that's the reason for 8.1 billion shares outstanding. With so many shares it takes weeks for it to move up a dollar or two at it' current share price. If number of shares were to reverse split back to the 1975 share price you would be looking at a 30 to 1 reverse split. So in reality the 8 to one reverse split makes GE stock share price still cheap. One more perk is that the stock price after the possible reverse split would take a few days to move up $10 instead of weeks.
Why didn't they split the stock @ $6? it doubled . Gigantic scam taking place here
Yep! Kill the keystone pipeline but help Russia complete their pipeline. Where's the logic in this?
"My dad worked for GE for 30 years, passed away away at 97 last year. He was GE all the way...everything we owned was GE. He was part of the Greatest generation.....saved saved saved....talk about being long on GE! Gifted my sister, brother and I 300 shares each back in 2000. At that time stock had already split 3 times, and stood at $60 per share. I am patient and I know GE will continue to rise. Leadership and vision still great."
"It's a sad reality, but the large numbers of nursing home and assisted living deaths due to Covid infections will be of financial benefit to GE. Also, the reluctance of the aged to move to such places will also benefit GE. All due to GE's residual insurance guarantees (a financial risk they took several years ago when those insurance units were sold) that will eventually expire. GE will be able to take that risk factor (set asides) off the books, which will be another plus for the balance sheet.Go, GE!Good luck, longs."
Excuses for pumpers being wrong after promising GE will be up today in 3.....2.....1.....
Any comment about the reverse stock split?
"Not to get too cocky but... Opps you fell for it again... you sold your position and it climbing back up becuase Oh OPPS you did it again... and now the recovery way back above 14....""Analysts are growing more optimistic about the industrial titan as its turnaround strategy progresses."""
Who is Loading up this morning! Futures are GREEN so it must be going to trade above $15! 
I'm pretty sure back in the 1800's when this was an IPO the share price opened at 13.12.
All my GE Shares purchased yesterday are GREEN! . I want to thank all the Shorts that borrowed the GE shares that they sold to me yesterday. Sorry but you will need to look elsewhere to cover your short since my shares are not for sale.PS: Shorts= Baggies

More to follow...One airline wants to buy 737-7s I think it was, because they only need 4-flight attendants... yes it’s true, and no matter the size they come with two GE blow hards, one under each wing... Funny how the circus dumps on Thursday to get people out of the options. It must be easier to trash a stocks imagine than it is to pump."
I just saw jj carrying the Easter Chicken across the road.
Huge short interest here....we need some fire power to come in and RIP THIS HIGHER. After Good Friday is just fine. Boolean
"Rick = Short Baggie !. He is up 3 whole cents now, hahahaha"
wow GE up a whopping 12 cents with dow up 500pt. At this rate it would take the Dow moving up 500pts for 9 days straight for GE to get back to 14!
"Now that GE stock has started to roll, it will not slow for awhile till it reaches a meaningful level of at least high TEENS..my guess is $18..... all sorts of good news from the GE itself and other national news will keep stock going higher and higher......Thanks to the hard working CEO and all LONGS.... go GE go"

I TOLD YOU FLANNERY WAS NEUTRALIZING JPM T00sa attacks by SHAREHOLDERS FRIENDLY MOVES (bad for JPM off the book shorts). So, Wllst Promptly, overnight removed FLANNERY, gave him $$200+MM pay so he keeps mouth shut... SAD SAD SAD Anerica.. Brought in Culp outsider SNAKE, TH!EF to help PREVENT GE NATURAL RISE.. Every time GE PRICE FUNDAMENTALLY, STRONGLY MOVES UP, JPM uses Culp to make moves to create FALSE NEGATIVE NEUTRAL NARRATIVE.... JUST SADAND I LOVE JPM JUST AS I DO GE, BOTH ARE AMERICAN COMPANIES.."
bought in dip .... good rally... now Dow goes up and GE follows 
"Where is jj , chicken and missF"
good News today 
"GE’s earnings are as expected. It is ok, better on cash flow and earnings, but lower on revenue. Remember this is the weakest quarter. GE will be better in future. Using the weakness to accumulate more shares and be patient."
"If the profit takers and panic sellers didn’t sell last week, we’d already be at 16+. Once we cross $15, look out. Could be a quick jump to $20. "
Stock fell 14% in couple days after split was announced in march. Even if it does not tank further it will prevent ANY capitol appreciation going forward PPL will see.
5 year chart is one big CUP and HANDLE. Very bullish sign. This is a millionaire maker.
"Culp you TH!EF, you are a SNAKE BACKST@BBED GE & SHAREHOLDERS. Its sooo obvious, didnt even try to hide. BIOPHARMA Cell Therapy, Genomics are the FITURE of Med, 10,000 times more growth than EVs. This TH!EF SWIPPED OUR GE BIOPHARMA, ST0LE IT for 4 times Revenue. Meanwhile Every Biopharma, Genomic stock, even with ZEROOO Revenue, huge debt, huge losses are valued at 30--60 times Revenue.. GE BIOPHARMA had nearly $5 BILLION Rev, GROWING, $$$BILLION+ Cash Flow Positove yearly, sold for cheap 4 times Revenue. GE DOES NOT EVEN NEED THE CASH.. GE Debt is small comparing to others. The GE Debts paid off was generating around $$12 BILLION CASH FLOW (BKR $1+Bn Dividend, Aviation Leasing financing unit generated $$BILLION+ Cash Flow, BIOPHARMA $$BILLION+ Cash Flow, Other smaller units sold also cash flow Positove..That equaled the $0.50 Dividend or $$11 Billion, 3 yrs div).. WHY SOLD THE ASSETS, Debts that was combined generating $$12 BILLION CASH FLOW, 3yrs??COULD HAVE SPUN OUT THE UNITS WITH DEBT, TO SHAREHOLDERS.. Because its R0BBING SHAREHOLDERS, MILLIONS OF BABY BOOMERS, Who built this greatest nation in the world...SAD SAD, VERY UNFORTUNATE..I LOVE JPM, HOPE THESE GUYS REWARDS US FOR R0BBING US SHORT TERM... Really SAD SAD"
Let's review yesterday's outrageous predictions on GE. Did YOU fall for it?
Sometimes you have to cut and run. I did so today. I only keep stocks that pay dividend. GE tried my patience. No regrets. Good luck to you all.

nice late day comeback - that must really pizz off all the negative people on this board. So it is just one more stress inducing item for those folks. So one more piece of good news.
Chickens made fun of me for recommending Tesla a couple of years ago. LOL. Chickens is now a road pizza.
Just added to position will buy more don't care about rs GE will be a 125.00 stock!!!
If Culp is done working for the shareholder adios to him.
Almost....next stop is Green !
"Thanks to the last financial changes GE is now worth $20 a share today. They only way to stop the stock price surge was to invent this ""reverse split PROPOSAL"" which will be NEVER voted upon or even less MATERIALIZE.Guillermo owns clean energy CLNE. The stock stuck has been stuck at $2 for five years. CLNE board kept a PROPOSED REVERSE SPLIT on their agenda for 5 years without EVER asking shareholders to vote on it. Now the stock is at $14. No need of a reverse split. With GE at $14 a reverse split? All it needs to do is starting buying shares that it can next year with the PPS moving to $30.Stay greedy my friends"
"My Rule No. 7 - If any analyst raises or downgrades a Stock on 2nd and 4th Friday , DO NOT Buy or Sell that stock."
"BUY, BUY, BUY."
"I expect GE to close between 12-15 dollars today, because some people say i am a very stable Genius."
Book value of 4.06. I don’t think it is the right time to get In. Overvalued in my opinion. Thoughts?
I bet the CEO never heard of buying shares on the street to boost SP. He probably buys them on dark pools like everyone else
"Wind Power – The Real Secret is that General Electric leads the fieldIn 2020 wind turbine manufacturers generated 1/3rd of what the world will absolutely need in 2030.That means that all three firms need to triple their manufacturing production during the next 10 years.We need to add 1,250GW over the 10 years or 125GW added every year.Therefore worldwide wind manufacturers need to go from 60GW in 2020 to $125GW new wind power in 10 years (2030).That means we need to triple the wind power generated.+ + +Or simply said, if General Electric sold $15 billion of RENEWABLES in 2020 – it will have to sell $45 billion of RENEWABLES by 2020 just to supply it’s 1/3rd of the upcoming needs.In 2020 the three companies installed 34GW of wind power worldwide (gigawatts).General Electric – 13.5GW; Vestas 12.4GW; Siemens – 7.65GW Total 33.24GW Simply on scale - It is more likely that General Electric will grow far faster than Ventas or Siemans.So the RENEWABLE part of GE could top $60 billion per year or $600 billion in the 10 years upcoming.And if there is a scarcity of manufacturing, the prices charge will move up and the profit spread will increase.Who can supply??The hard reality is that outside China, there are only 3 wind turbine manufactures. (excludes Goldsmith Envision, Ming Yang, Shanghai Electric, all only in and supplying China) + + +Here are some boring but essential figures to look at:To support these present and future wind needs taken from leading Renewable sources – they stateTotal existing ONSHORE wind is 650GW.Total ONSHORE wind in 2030 needs to be 1,787GW.That is an ONSHORE wind increase of 117GW a year or 1,170GW needed in the next 10 years + + +Total OFFSHORE wind in 2020 is 35GWTotal OFFSHORE wind in 2030 needs to be 213GWThat is an OFFSORE wind increase of 117GW a year or 1,170GW needed in the next 10 years + + +The combined OFFSHORE and ONSHORE wind increase by 2030 is200GW a year or 2,000GW more wind needed.So I know a lot of people are living for the Q1 2021 results in 2 weeks – but the real picture is that Culp is playing a much longer game plan that just a quarter of numbers. His plan has to be to take RENEWABLES to a larger size than Aviation is in normal times. And as I showed you earlier, scarce products makes for higher returns.And don’t forget the 20 year maintenance contracts with a 20% net profits. That isn’t even figured into this."
Go up a nickel or dime a day then hammered 5% + GE went into deep freeze the day split was announced 10 week ago
"GE installs 1st Cypress turbines for 153-MW wind project in Brazil First Cypress wind turbines from GE Renewable Energy at Serra da Babilonia wind farm April 19 (Renewables Now) - GE Renewable Energy has completed the installation of the first turbines for a 153-MW expansion of the Serra da Babilonia wind power complex in the state of Bahia.The renewable energy arm of General Electric (NYSE:GE) is implementing a 30-turbine extension of the current 223.25-MW complex. The company is utilizing its Cypress model, a wind turbine with an operating range of 4.8 MW-5.1 MW.This is the first time GE erects Cypress turbines in the Americas, it said, adding that over 60% of the machine's components are being produced in Brazil.The agreement with Brazilian energy company Rio Energy also includes 10 years of operation and maintenance (O&M) services for all equipment supplied by the company at Serra da Babilonia, GE noted."
"GE has to stand on it's own, compete, increase revenue and respect investors."
Before reverse split
"20 billion in market cap lost in 30 hours. Brilliant. Some store managers like to just cut hours and cut hours and cut hours, not realizing they're destroying customer service and satisfaction, thus reducing sales even further. Other managers look for ways to increase sales, which covers the labor, creates job satisfaction, providing good service. Both ways end up with the same EBITA. But hey, GE balance sheet looks pretty. The lost value in 2 days could have paid 2/3 of the aviation leasing company. And these people went to the finest schools our country has to offer?"

"JAMES SAYs * Ge doing down. * poor, poor james. Bought at 14.12 and sold at 12.21. Good trade ."
At what average price did GE buy BKR shares at?
I bet CEO never heard of buying stock to boost price
"Boeing (40% 0f DJI) up $5 pre-market. Southwest confirms buying 100 Max Jets, GE Engines."
Long term holders like me are worried about the RS and the subsequent dilution. Most of you are concerned with making a few bucks before the split and then you are either gone willingly or zeroed out.
"The first large-scale offshore wind project in the United States has gotten the green light from government officials. The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) announced yesterday that the Vineyard Wind 1 project set to be constructed off the coast of Massachusetts will create 3,600 jobs and provide enough power for 400,000 homes and businesses.Approval was for up to 84 turbines about 12 nautical miles offshore from Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. But according to the Vineyard Wind team, the facility will use the General Electric (NYSE:GE) Renewable Energy segment's large Haliade-X turbines, which will allow it to use only 62 turbines. The project is another win for GE's renewable energy group. In its first-quarter 2021 earnings release, GE said the renewably energy segment grew orders 15% year over year, though revenue was up only slightly at 2%. Just yesterday, GE separately announced a strategic agreement with Toshiba Energy Systems."
two Ricks on board.. don't see a panic sell off just a little dip ... people love GE ...
Again move on you creations and buy or sell else where .......GE a BUY!!!!!
J J... time for you're diaper to be changed...
why little change AH? If RS is bad everyone should be selling. Fewer shares keeps short away . This will hold well no matter how many criticize it.
"When it comes to psychology of share prices: Dow Jones is a price weighted index, so share prices with a higher price have a bigger impact than shares with a lower share price. I think Culp wants GE back to Dow Jones, as many investors are not considering companies not listed in major indexes. If I’m correct with my assumptions, that Segment profitability will increase this year and debts come to a healthy proportion (together with listing to Dow Jones), I’m quite sure what impact that all will have ! There are no clear rules to get listed again, but I’m quite sure a share price of 12 to 20 USD per share is contraproductive due to the a.m. reasons. Private retailers also will benefit once it’s done ! The communication around the RS should definitely improve ! So the underlying facts and motivation for the RS are understandable...GLTA"
What are the known results of share price historically after a reverse split? Just because you own GE shares doesn't mean a reverse split is good for your investment. It has to be one of the worst things that could happen to shareholders. Lessen short selling? roflmao. Ya right. Short sellers are salivating over a GE $80-100 short. Me included. Bring it little Larry
below 13 in the short term. Maybe retest of 12.5 but not much more below that. eventually it will rise back to 14 this year
Reverse split announcement was 10 weeks ago. Stock still off 10%
"most of the shareholders here are making money or soon will be. recent yahoo article states GE in top ten best robotic companies, renewable energy company, arguably the best jet engines, for example. so if you can produce a better investment for $14 a share please tell us, otherwise no one cares. "
1/2 one percent stock traded equals 4% drop in stock and $5B loss in market cap. please do a 25-1 reverse stock tomorrow..
I vote yes for RS only to get rid off jj and day traders
BTW... Baggies= GE Shorts. 
Anything lower than 12:99 is worth buying. Bought in some at 12:98 and waiting for 14
"Analysts at CNBC are bullish on GE.Will see $15 soon, hold on to your shares."
Come on day traders. Get that volume up. Investors are falling asleep.
Talk of reverse split slammed the brakes on P was climbing steadily over time. Who knows where it would be today had culp not stepped in it
"I am asked how GE stock could get $30 or $40 a shareIt is simply tied to profit x 23 times - give or take.I think Aviation will return quickly to the $6.5 billion FCF. 17% is already assured with military existing sales and not a worry for GE in volume and profits.I know Medical is hovering at $2.6 billion FCF and should rise to $3 billion in the near future.The secret sauce is Renewables. Barrons just projected in 2024 a $3 billion FCF General Electric Renewables - but I think there is a lot of wiggle room on this area.The one area GE is new in and has an unlimited ability to expand and is also totally dominant is wind power. That market is exploding and there are only 3 real companies to supply. Vestas and Siemens are smaller and restricted by resources - money, manufacturing plants, people, and marketing contacts.GE is the really only firm worldwide ready to take on the wind turbine offshore scale coming up in the next 24 months and profits will obviously follow. Not just the 8% net profit talked about by Vestas last winter in their results - but with the 20 year service contracts that GE is collecting, net profits should climb to at least a 15% profit. Remember GE has lead in wind turbines the USA for the past 2 years, installing more ONSHORE wind farms than anyone. Siemens is simply not selling anything in the USA. All those General Electric wind turbine sales have contracts for 20 year service attached. In aircraft that add-on represents is a 20% profit, but to be reasonable I have used a 15% markup.In many ways wind is a lot like aviation. Sell the razors cheap and then profit mightily on the refill blades.Also the selling to a very established wind farm operator builds future sales bridges going forward. More wind farm sales, more relationships in the future.Lastly we have not added the $1 billion FCF for Power that is coming. That is more uncertain but has a lot of possibilities. We did not mention digital or GE Capital - each supposed to move to profits in 2021.So if you add Aviation $6.5 billion, and Medical $3 billion, and Renewables $3 billion and Power $1 billion you get a total of $13.5 billion profit in the near future once things normalize.A conservative 23 times $13.5 billion makes a stock price of $31.50 a share.But that ratio may be low, or the profits may be low, or time will just allow that number to grow.So I am not hallucogenic when I say that General Electric stock price more likely than not will reach a price of $30 or $40 as share in the next couple of years. I certainly am not a cheerleader. I am a REALIST.The upside is terrific and the downside is nil."
"What happens if reverse split goes thru, which it totally will? Let's say GE gets to $16 by then, which it totally won't. What happens? I was convinced to sell my killer holdings (sub-$6) by literally every source indicating that the RS -- even when it makes sense, as in GE's case -- will inevitably lead to a significant sell off after it. So buy now at $13.50. Gets to $16 (which seems extremely unlikely). RS, plunges 15% (likely much more over weeks?). We're back at equivalent to 13.50 (but actually $108). Seems like a ton of risk to go nowhere -- and then to own it at $108, which, while I am a HUGE fan of GE, it is absolutely not even close to worth $108/share! Am I thinking about this all wrong? Anyone?"
"GREAT NEWS, now straight to $20 then1x8 stock exchange and$160 ,then CULP starts buying profitable l=companies with all the cash buying every share possible this week"
Not sure why people aren't all over this stock . Will be $40-$50 next year .
"Clowns detected by AI routine. List of new clown aliases connected to jj and Clown Zero from other stock message boards imminent. Avoid scamming clowns! I repeat, Avoid Scamming Clowns!"
"All in. I've bought GE last year around $7 and I still think it's one of the most undervalued stocks. Another good one is Panasonic $PCRFY. Like GE, they are positioning themselves to take a big junk of the future of technology in EV's, green energy and much more."
Can someone please share with me if there is something positive with the 1 for 8 reverse split? Trying to understand why they would do that. Please don't be sarcastic. Just trying to understand management's reasoning.
"GE's stock was valued in the single Digits for a reason. We lived through the Reign of two CEOs that Window Dressed this company to a higher valuation. But as we all say it was a highly undeserved valuation. Now GE's CEO and Board of Directors is trying to tell us that a Reverse Split of 1 for 8 will put us back in the stratosphere of $100 to $114 a share. Plenty of people lost their shirts and more on this company and now they want to take away their monetary leverage of regaining some of their losses. Yes GE has jettisoned some of its losing divisions, but it is still a risky company, but we were their Cheer Leaders. But at $100 a share GE will lose a lot of its following. The enthusiasm for holding the stock will mostly be gone. Mutual Funds and Hedges will have to support it. But GE won't stay at $100 -$114 a share. Its not just a Mathematical Equation. There is a large Psychological component. And that will be Lost. GE will sink to $70 and maybe even drift into the $60s.GE will become a Short Sellers Picnic.(Maybe the Yahoo Sensor won't Delete this Post this Time)"
Do any of you think GE will test 13.09 in next few days?
"Can I please get a ""What, What!!"" for GE bouncing 58 cents off the bottom??? ANYBODY? That's over 4%!!"
"If I had loads of Monopoly money like jj, I could make a lot more Monopoly money."

"I did not learn anything new from analyst, Cramer or this message board. I would not be surprised if stock closes at same price it opened."
It is surprising that 97% of investors voted for RS and then vote against the $230 million bonus. Is it to give the CEO the finger for the poor judgment?
JPM MMs are enjoying the show!Shorting call options every week!
Looks like all the panic sellers got out! Now back to normal!
Nice trend for GE in 5 day chart. Down over 10%. LOL
good news coming
Reverse split watch: GE at $102.80 down $1.92
Alot of cash on the side ready to buy. Just waiting for green light from the meeting tomorrow. Billions to pour in.
and green
logical......did you know that BAGGIES = Shorts?
The r/s doesn’t work at all. GE is the same old troubled company. The price will split but then fall back down.The only time a r/s split has ever worked is when a company is currently performing well with a good outlook for the future.BEWARE of this R/S
Wait to Tusa comes out n.goes positive on this!! There Balance Sheet is in great shape n by mid to latter part of next year will b looking to do strategic acquisitions!! Mr Culp is the best CEO in America!!!
buy.buy.buy.... you may not see it this low again
"ProShares stocks do a lot reverse and forward splits. It is the nature of proshares to split, whether short, ultra short, etc. Can we say the GE stock is a proshares stock?"
"General Electric Company holds about 349,439,701 BKR's( Baker Hughes) shares Dec 30, 2020 47.94% of total shares. That is about 11 Billions value ."

"When GE was $6 I told my neighbors to purchase some, but they all scoffed! Now they all want to ride on my boot so I make the wive's show their ( . )( . ) to come. This boat will never sink I tell ya!"
OVER REACTION TO THE NEWS OF REVERSE SPLIT caused stock downhill; other wise selling the leasing jet unit was welcomed specially with $25B in cash and 111M share of the Aercap company was a great deal you ask me............reducing debt and having a cleaner balance sheet will have GE save millions on interest alone putting Ge in better position to pay dividend and attract investor..........
The stock is in freefall right now. You may want to cut your losses now while you still have a chance to live to fight another day. Tomorrow this will be sub $10 & I think everyone already knows that.
16 lets go GE!
Nice large green candle just like expected... you shorts never learn do you?
"Make some moolah with options. Yes, options are the way to go imho. GLTA"
ge was on a good recovery..i don't know why they would go for a reverse split??????
"@rj Wow, what did I say 2 months ago. I guess you won't be complaining about the share price anymore...Sudo2 months agoReplied to a reaction$GE conversationShare price doesn't mean anything. They could do a reverse split tomorrow and have $100 share price if they wanted to."
GE to $20 this year guys!
I think the RS will also be great because of what is happening right now. What’s your opinion?

Notice how ALL of the pumpers are gone. Their job is done for now. There is a crew of them in here. Employees/retirees. Just like last time. Where is gene?
"After several weeks of consolidation and bearish attack, strong bottom base has formed. GE will be back above $13.5 next few days and test $13.8 next week. Looking for breakout $14.5 near future. Bullish pattern has gradually formed. Be patient."
bought in pre market @ $12.19. keep going up...BA up $ 18. today
Well look what we have here today...Short Baggies who added today are already in the Red . Shorts got played today. The smart Shorts had opportunity to cover with less Red  this morning...hope they took it. And Remember: Baggies=GE Shorts! 
Can I see the opening price tomorrow? I am excited for GE

Gapping up at the open tomorrow. News out:Southwest is reportedly close to a deal with Boeing for a potentially huge 737 Max order as the carrier looks to refresh its fleet.
actually it's at it high for the day... about to go green... indication that earnings are good ... 
"GE doing so well. As I said a year ago, buy and hold for the next 5 years and GE will reward you thanks to CULP. So glad I bought at $8! Look forward to $20 over the next year!"
I believe in Larry. That's the bottom line. I'll hold this for a LONG time.
"well thats a surprise.....last couple days the children were not to be found...a day GE is down the Notradomis's are out in force posting every couple of minutes with their cutsey gif's, dribble drek and LOL YIPEE HEHEHEHEcant wait for nappy time"
GE fair price is 25-35 bucks. Don't fear the split. I got it from a very stable Genius.
interesting 1M shares+ traded post-close to drive up the price.
"Short sellers are calling the shots, just look at the volume trend."
"There are exceptions, but generally reverse stock splits lead to further underperformance:Researchers at the Stern School of Business at NYU and Emory University looked at more than 40 years of data, from 1962 to 2001, and found that of the 1,600 reverse stock splits, shares underperformed their non-split peers by 15.6% in the first year following the split, 36% in the second year and 54% in the third year."
ge is green with 4c
green
correct. Everyone has lost sight of the reduced overhead that HAS TO improve the 2021 GE bottom line (profits).
Get ready for the squeeze. It’s coming later this week. GE will be $17 by EOW
"If they can manipulate the markets (stock price) , what makes people think , the EVMs can't rig the vote counts?"
Voted against reverse stock split. Never good when it goes that way.
All the bears are the ones that got scared yesterday and sold and regret it
"Above 400 Million Shares in 2 days and GE is Above $12. Basically, institutions are buying and retails investor is losing. Tusa comes out after so many days that means JPM is also buying. Culp is a legend look at Danaher. I am buying because I buy based on the CEO."
Decent volume today.
"Institutional ownership of GE is increased almost 1% recently to 64.7% now. Top four holdings are T.Rowe, Vanguard, Fidelity, and Black Rock. Interestingly, high flyer growth ETF fund ARK group also build a position on GE with about 417k shares. This is a very good news. These institutions are accumulating GE. GE should rise above $13.5 and retest $13.8 this week. Good luck to all."
The market is playing 52-Card Pickup right now and it is likely that Industrials will be picked up first over Tech. Tech has seen its brightest days over the course of covid and will fade in value over post-covid. Now it is time for the industrials to rebuild this country.
Reverse split will drop stock by at least 30% and then the high share price post split will case it to go down more.Culp and the board are not interested in shareholder value for YOU...only for their future minted options.
"If the 8 for 1 reverse is bad, how about full-year earnings per share lowered to $0.15 – $0.20 compared to its previous guidance of $0.15 – $0.25. Something smells rotten at GE, and imagine Culprit made 73 million in compensation last year. GE still the good old boys network. Executives lining their pockets on the backs of GE shareholders."
Can GE share price reach $15.00 leading to next week's earning announcement? It's possible considering the TSA flyer metrics for the past 6 weeks.
"I muted JJ and J J and GE_to_0$ and man oh man what a difference it makes on this board. No more garbage posts from them, I love it. Now I can focus on real posts from those that want to talk about GE with a reasonable conversation."
"Hi fellow shareholders, I think it may help to write to investor relations and expressing the fact we do not think reverse split makes sense at this point of recovery. You can list a myriad of reasons available from the chats here. I sent an email to IR. email address is on GE website. My hope is that the message will get to the board and in any case, will not hurt. What do you think?"
"Can we get a just kidding on the reverse today? Seriously, this is shaping up to be my only holding in the red this am."
Them 13.50 calls have been selling like hot cakes....hmmm.
The bears are loosing big money shorting $GE so they get on here and start spewing lies and spread disinformation. $GE's heading to the $20's this year folks regardless!
Shareholders of GE have been screwed in every possible way.NOW a 1 for 8 reverse stock split ?? That way when they increase the dividend .01 there will be fewer shareholders.Culp ‘s outrageous pay package was rejected—-thankfully !
"Long time bear analyst Tusa attacked GE again yesterday by releasing a bearish note Published by BARRON. He has tried to find GE irregularities years ago but failed. He now desperately tried to find it by looking at SAFRAN’s recent financial reports. By Looking his analysis, He claimed GE overbooked the engine service revenue based SAFRAN’s number. Stupidly, he didn’t realize the lump sum number GE $13 billion including GE’s military and other revenue, which pointed out by GE in BARRIN’s interview. After took out the number, the service number was $3.1 billion which even slightly smaller than SAFRAN’s $3.3 billion. This fact really embarrassed Stupid Tusa’s naive research! You can see how low Tusa’s research is. This gives me another reason why GE is bullish since the bearish desperately using nonsense to accuse and attack GE. He will be fired by JP Morgan soon."
back in again & again 3000@13.25
Sell your GE ahead of a $4 Trillion Infrastructure Bill? Really? This is the Robinhood Mentality?
Just can’t believe why GE stock isn’t moving despite all the business and new contracts pouring in and the market is highest point. There must be some kind of manipulation going on since GE seems to be over bought. Evil forces and hands keeping the stock down otherwise there’s no natural reason for it.
Don't Worry... Be Happy!
Baker Hughes stock up1.60 after GE sold hahahahah Culp is the BEST CEO. hahahahah
Why did GE ‘s earnings date change today?
I would love to see this run back up to 14 todayThat would make a great start to the week
"So let me get this right, GE has most of the debt under control and a 400 billion dollar backlog of business and Tusa is worried about 21 billion in debt left on GE capital."
"didnt the board complain, too many shares.culp heard you lol"
Talk of reverse split sent GE shares into a deep freeze I don;t care what anybody says
That's my little GE engine.... and going to blow away earnings next week.... BOOYAH!
"13,50 $ today"
sweet GE
GE IS UP X IS DOWN: The market giveth and takenth
Culp is doing a great job of reviving GE. Where were all these institutional investors voted against Culp's pay when Immelt was in charge destroying GE? Claw back Immelt's bogus bonuses now.
Time to buy more Jan 22- 15 calls

"How to MUTE JJ and J J. It's simple, click on the three dots upper right of one of his/her messages. I did it and love not seeing his/her spam."
"lol the panic sellers are going to be highly upset with themselves. They bought in for the right reasons - fundamentals and ever-strengthening balance sheet driven the highly respected Larry Culp. They bought in at a highly discounted price due to the fact that GE's bread and butter AVIATION sector had been pummelled by the coronavirus. Yet in spite of the aviation hit, Culp still made move after move to increase the value of this company, to right the ship. lol and now aviation is about to explode in growth and people sold . Dont let these shorts fool you out of your money and scare you with their ""short and distort"" fairy tales about how a reverse-split is going to allow the actual MARKET CAPITALIZATION to become a small fraction of what it was when you bought it. Use logic, not your emotions. but until then I'll keep buying more at these discounted prices before the real fun starts. GLTA"
Using the dip to add more. Remember GE is the early recovery stage. Accumulating while it’s stock strength is at weak. This provides long term investors another opportunity. It will go back above $14 in one month!
"Before a reverse split GE will be a 15.00+++ stock, and make no mistake about it!!! Buy Buy Buy GE...!!! The NASDAQ will boom tomorrow so buy sooooon...!!!"
The last 4 quarters GE reported an amazing 2 cents in earnings. In the prior 4 quarters they reported 57 cents a share in earnings. And this pile of #$%$ wants shareholders to give them raises. They should all be fired. For all you thumbs down idiots out there its on Nasdaq's data. This is your good friend and buddy the stupidest CEO that ever led a 1B and up market cap company. What on earth would give you the slightest inkling that this 3.83 book share value stock could EVER go up. What are you basing your opinions on??? Sure isn't the profits I hope. Better not be company value. NO DARN HOPE. What do you think they want a R/S for. Shove your thumbs down where the sun wont shine and come up with an explanation that I will love to hear. You and Culp and all the other stupid as sheep m f cannot wish it into a higher pps. Get it? Only PERFORMANCE repeat PERFORMANCE will get this anything like 20 a share. Data says it's going the complete opposite direction Prove me wrong.
"$$GE TO $50..GEAS Rev $5 Billion, Sold for $$30 BILLION CASH and 46% Ownership of the new joint entity..

BKR Balance Sheet is STRONGEST of all in oil and oil-service technology, even tech stocks. Please look at BKR Balance Sheet..Either way, I think Wallatreet has huge big plans for GE FUTURE DIRECTION, therefore the changes and repositioning of GE, to move it direction of GROWTH acquisitions, that would explain why GE keeps piling on mountain of $$$CASH and LIQUIDITY.."

"Reverse splits are not good for current stockholders! Sure, initially your post-split financial position is the same but if you are at a current loss which many current stockholders are, it takes huge upticks in stock price to recover those losses (ie. $8 to recover $1). A case in point is C which reversed split about 15 years ago at about $4.50 (10 for 1). Today C is at $72 or $7.20 pre-split price. So not even a double after 15 years. Maybe GE could participate in a GME-like rally but consider that a GE pre-split cost-basis of $30 to today's market price of $13ish means GE must go up $136 from $104 post-split in order to break-even. Psychologically and financially it is much harder for a stock to rise $136 versus $17. GE is not going under and will easily survive but the post-stock split will only benefit new investors."
GE seems to have reach the top of the range. Next move? Maybe low $12 or below. We will see.
20T:12.68?reverse spilt?
Let’s go
GE is proposing a 1 for 8 reverse stock split. Not sure I like that...it means we will each own 1/8 the amount of shares at a correspondingly 8x higher price...from my experience stock in companies with reverse stock splits don't fare as well as if the stock were left alone. Anyone have a different view of this?
"GE paid $32 billion for Baker Hughes in 2017.377,425 shares foe $32 billion was around $85 a share.That is part of the bad decisions in the past that increased debt, added losses because stock overpaid 4 times today's price.Culp has his work cut out for him but the good news is he is unwinding the past mistakes."
JJ......why did you delete your own posts? You got a little carried away with your millions of profit from $6-$14........but your stated short is costing you millions?
"With the 1.9T trickling into the markets from every nook and cranny, and all the upside in aviation and wind power/turbine green energy generation, this GE play is absolutely a no brainier.The market cool-off from yesterdays record high, is healthy, and will serve to let investors take a breath, and then jump back in.If you like to buy low and sell high, now is the time to buy, as its not likely that this market will stop it's continuous climb for long (GE included)."
More GE execs abandoning the ship.
Broke resistance intra day..... you know what that means!
Four stages of Reverse Split.1) Denial - It's good for the company and shareholders.2) Anger - Why didn't I sell when I had a chance.3) Depression - It's going to take many years just to break-even.4) Acceptance - I got screw by this company
"I will tell you, very sad and disappointed at the board's recommendation of reverse split. That will definitely benefit the company but not share holders."
This Reverse Split is part of The strategy to get GE back into the Dow Jones group. I wish they would level with shareholders the details of how that strategy would work and why it's important for the company. Hope that transparency will be forthcoming soon.
why do they want to do a reverse split with GE shares?
No worries about the reverse split because it was priced in 6 weeks ago when the news was annouced.
This stock defys all common sense... frustrating as hell!
"Here’s a serious question unlike most useless trash on this board. From. The article on May12th “The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) announced yesterday that the Vineyard Wind 1 project set to be constructed off the coast of Massachusetts will create 3,600 jobs and provide enough power for 400,000 homes and businesses.” Ok so here’s my question. The 400k homes and businesses are they all converting from natural gas to electric to heat their homes in the Massachusetts winters? You’re telling me all the ultra rich in Nantucket are going to convert their homes from gas heat to electric heat? Really. If not what’s the use of windmills? I would be more impressed if they were doing this in hotter region like off the coast of Florida or In the gulf for New Orleans where you actually do use electric to COOL your homes down. This seems like a huge waste of money but what else would you expect from the government."
"a bunch of hens, squawk, squawk,squawk. no useful info here @ all"
Making it easier for Culp to collect the hundreds of millions is the ultimate insult to shareholder. The RS is stake thru heart. You will see now that GE move higher is done
"This will be my day BAGGIES. Huge earnings miss coming. Back to the 12s, great short."

Reverse split and CEO compensation has put a dark cloud over these shares. Shareholders are going to get krewed
I Follow ADT stock and it's a rocks it's going only up is falling down today Over 22 cent and now is it green Run and buy it It's don't need to have millions Value every single day One million........ I promise you Ran and buy it
"GE is trading at 56x and 26x this year and next year's earnings. Is that cheap to you? It is not to me. GE is NOT a value play and has no earnings momentum. It's the worst of both worlds, so buy some puts on GE here and protect the gains that you have in your other winners. A win win situation for us shorts."
cheap way to short the SPX-- traders going to torment the longs -- get out
"Those call options...run up to earnings, sweet! :)"
"Take a very serious look at Larry Culp and DanaherMost posters on this board know little about investing and even less on who is running GE.Larry Culp was elevated to CEO of Danaher in 2003 when it was a very small $3 billion company.Its claim to fame was mostly making craftsman tools for Sears and a few other things.The stock was an $11 price in 2003 and profits were not that impressive.Over the next 15 years Larry Culp has set the company on fire with:a 2017 price of $181 a share (15 times bigger) that today in 2021 Danaher is now selling for $232 a share.Danaher is now recognized and admired s a totally integrated worldwide conglomerate.It has its hands into dozens of very sophisticated worldwide businesses.From a few thousand employees in the early years, Danaher now has 71,000 very motivated employees.The company has always had a profit which it plowed back into growing the company.Culp's style is to keep headquarter small nd delegate to each division.He traditionally works with only around 50 people at headquarters. He is a practitioner ""lean and mean"".Over the years Culp has engineered at least 20 acquisitions successfully. All have turned out profitably....He has also sold a number of divisions - each time profitably.He developed special systems for motivating and getting the most from his employees.That system was patterned after the Japanese work style.It was so successful in steamlining the company, that EVERY acquisition turned profitable and successful.After he left Danaher in 2015, he went on to teach at Harvard.He ws one of the most sought after speakers and sought after classes on campus.In 2018 he joined the GE Board. He was recruited to take GE to an entirely new plateau.GE is 5 times larger than Danaher but it is the same puzzle - just bigger and far more complex.There is no doubt where GE is headed. It is on a trajectory to soar.For any serious INVESTOR wanting to make ten to fifteen times their investment over the next years - it is a brain dead decision to buy GE. What is happening is obvious. GE is simply following the very successful Culp playbook."
"Yawn!! Another week, another $360. Have a nice weekend everyone!!"

opinions on hydrogen fuel use in aviation
"I do not think the GE management and its advisors are surprised at all today with the GE stock move down.And I agree with many posts saying about the same already:Reverse split would discourage retail investors looking for a higher quantity of ""affordable"" stock price entree and also of holding of the reversed split stock. It would also discourage day traders participation by loosing more of emotional retail investors and related stock volatility. The Retail fleeing will make room for lower stock price and ""noise free"" entree of additional institutional interest - this remains to be seen over time.I do not think Larry Culp would consider reverse split unless better days are coming up and unless he was advised to do so by institutional investors and analysts.I like the overall GE turnaround based on adaptability and futuristic plans. I also trust Larry and his flexibility. So I am going to hold the GE, likely for few more years. I will sell only if there would be a substantial, material reason(s) to do so, including GE and its stock going no where.Good luck to all!"
"I TOLD YOU 1+ yr ago, Culp was A SNAKE, A TH!EF, can be quality CEO, but an AGENT FOR OUTSIDER (JPM T00sa) CAUSE, came in for UNDERMINING GE SHAREHOLDERS..My English might not be good, but my analysis is accurate, see thing way before anyone sees, connect the dots way before in the beginning days.. ITS SAD, BECAUSE I HOLD PLENTY OF GE SHARES, PLENTY.. I LOVE GE, ITS A MUST HAVE, ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL FOR CIVILIZATION, GDP ECONOMICAL ACTIVITIES.. I ALSO LOVE JPM, but how would JPM feel if anyone did to JPM what JPM has been doing to GE AND SHAREHOLDERS???"
rising US interest rates will allow GE to re-allocate a boat load of money allowing for a faster recovery as they can divert from pension funding requirements - sure to hear more about this from Larry on March 10
"I thought about selling my position in GE after the recent news, but decided to hold. The market can be so irrational, especially at these times. I would not be surprised if GE ends the month with a new 52 week high."

"Im not so good in open contracts in respect of options. When does a high number of open contracts mean. I understand perfectly the ratio of call vs. put options, but when it comes to open contracts I’m struggling. If somebody has a link would be appreciated....thank you in advance !"

"gene 2 questions. Do you work or have you ever worked for GE? Why are you blowing this board up on the weekend with the same info you have already posted several times. Oh, one more. What was your nick last time? If you want to write a book about GE then maybe go ahead and give the scroll a break. I think everyone knows who you are. This is a blog, not your playground. How far are you behind in your 401k?"
GE I’m getting more bullish on. ET is a great stock with a good dividend. 15-20 short term for both.
I would like to see the BoD release an explanation of *why* they think a rev-split is needed. So far they've said the rev-split is being considered. What they haven't said is why this move is even being considered.
"Put your energy into increasing the profitability GE to increase the share price, not a reverse split. Giving me a dollar bill for 10 dimes does nothing."
"I don't exactly know what to make of this, we are being bombarded by positive news over and over again three business days in a roll which spikes the stock, but when no news shows up, we go into a free fall.is that really a good thing?."
YEAR OF THE CULP< stock breaks $14 this week
Option Sellers ( MMs & Hedge Funds) are in total control of GE's trading (price movement)..
"On the matter of praise singing, do not forget that1. GE dividend was cut down to 4 cents (0.30%) by Culp. It was 45 cents or 3.45%.2. DHR dividend is currently 84 cents (0.33%). It was 30 cents or 0.10% under Culp3. BKR dividend is currently 72 cents (3.59%). BKR has a history of steadily increasing dividend.Do not expect GE dividend to increase soon, even after the split. You can see that Culp does not reward shareholders. Do you own analysis. do not listen to cheerleaders."
buy the dip
Do shareholders have to approve this split?
Thanks for the freebie GE!
"Alot of news today. But, i think this is the time to add to the position."
Stock hit 52 week high the day before split was announced. That was 60 days ago. Looks @ 6 mo chart . Split killed the stock appreciation. It is not needed or desirable. As it stands would only take $13 to double. Stock will never double from 100. BAD IDEA Management created lot of animosity doing this.
"GE has been trading sidelines for almost 2 months between $12 and $14. It’s daily trading range is tightening, however, and could be getting ready for another big move.Recently, most of GE Analysts have raised Their Earnings, Cash Flow Forecasts, but the price of GE stays at $13 to $13.5.The GE Chart: Over the course of the last two months, General Electric’s daily trading range has become smaller recently. The bears tried to push it under $13 several times, but failed. GE has been trading in a sideways channel above a support level at $12.90 and below a resistance level at $13.79Currently, GE's stock is still being held down by both the eight-day exponential moving average (EMA) and the 21-day EMA. The eight-day EMA is also trending slightly below the 21-day EMA which is bearish. This is the reason why the bears tried to push GE lower. They hope GE lose support if they can bring it down under $12.8. They didn’t remember GE is trading well above the 200-day simple moving average, however, which indicates overall sentiment in the stock is bullish. Longs realize the long term bright side so they use temporary￼ bearish pattern created by the bears as an opportunity to accumulate GE stock. Thus, the bears failed to take down GE price since great underline buying are waiting to buy for the desired limited price. Unfortunately, GE was in the trading range $12.8 to $13.6.￼ ￼Bulls want to see GE's stock regain the eight-day and 21-day EMAs as support. If GE can pop over its EMAs, it has room to move back up to the $13.80 level. If it could regain that level as support it could move toward the $15 mark which is resistance from back in 2018.Bears want to see the eight-day and 21-day EMAs continue to push GE's stock down until it loses support at $12.90. If the stock falls below that they hope GE will fall to $12.23. The chance for that happen is slim unless indexes crashed. Thus, I placed limited order to buy at $12.98, $12.83 and $12.75. Could GE breakout the trading range between $12.9 and $13.6 next week? I personally think it is over due for the breakout. If not next week, maybe the week after!"
"The only reason you want a reverse split is because you want to issue new shares. Technically it is called dilution. First, you reduce 8 billion shares to 1 billion by 8 for 1 split. Then you issue new shares say 1 billion. in other words, you have just issued 8 billion new shares resulting in 16 billion new shares before the split. This is a more gentle way of handling a bankruptcy."
Baker Hughes moving up nicely!! Could help propel our undervalued gem!! Slow and steady!!
Lots of desperate shorts on here. Could see a nice squeeze by EOW. Target of $17
"After RS, share price will be around $100 and GE can begin to negotiate better deals to offload the so called core assets. I think. Cannot see any other good reason for RS. Eventually, GE becomes a holding company. Holding GE shares will then be like buying into a mutual fund, less the fees."
Still plenty of time to load up .
Looks like all GE need to do to boost shares is split the stock 8 times. They better hurry

Back above $14 or down to $11 U-Pick
We've been in a tight 50 cent range for over a week. I think we'll break out up into the 14s and then in a range down to $13.50 at times.
Yes it was. The Toshiba/GE deal is bigger than the market is pricing in.After Fukashima Japan will spend a large amount to get their wind turbines up to speed
Is this you Marabound?
"Back to 13.07? if so, I load it again ...."
A lot of good news for GE. Ge has a lot of room to move up.Keep going up GE go go go!
somebody inside GE.. please send Culp the link to the conversations here.11.75 today?
It would be nice if GE closes at 13.5 on this Friday 05/21/2021.
Is this going to be the 7th Friday that GE closes in the Green?!...What is happening?!!!! :) :) :)
can someone explain me why this stock is now going down nothing chance from 19 min ago?????
I was gone all day and just checked in now. This morning before I left I posted that it would be a hoot if GE finished green but I was doubtful  Starting to think I sold too early 2 weeks ago at $13.40!!
jj just got a banana cream pie facial.
new resistance intra day 13.43
It never fails: As soon as things starts getting better a bad decision and move ruins it all. BAD move Mr Culp. Don’t mess up all your good work. STOP playing with share price and just concentrate on your core business of getting profitable. Stock price will automatically get higher. No need to artificially get it done. Thank you
There is absolutely no this stock goes back to the single digits in the foreseeable future. Little to no risk buying now. Upside is huge! $20 here we come.
"I say 50% Upside, This year.... Cheers"
"GE Aims to Slash Debt by 35% by 2023The company says it has a lot of options to cut borrowings once its deal with AerCap closes.Lou Whiteman(TMFeldoubleu)Mar 17, 2021 at 12:00PMGeneral Electric's (NYSE:GE) $30 billion deal to sell its GECAS aircraft financing arm to AerCap Holdings (NYSE:AER) is a key milestone in the industrial conglomerate's effort to get its balance sheet under control, the company's chief financial officer said on Wednesday, giving GE ""multiple paths"" to bring down its debt.Speaking at a Bank of America conference, GE chief financial officer Carolina Dybeck Happe said the company expects to have gross debt of about $70 billion once the GECAS deal closes, down from $104 billion at year's end. The company wants to bring that $70 billion figure down by about 35% to $45 billion by 2023, largely by cutting its roughly $43 billion in borrowings nearly in half.If the company is successful, that should bring its net debt down to about 2.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), compared to net debt of about 6 times EBITDA today.Happe said the company has ""multiple paths"" to reach its goal, including proceeds from its many divestitures and expected growth in free cash flow. GE will also own about 46% of AerCap after the deal closes, subject to a lockup of up to 15 months. Happe said that the company is likely to monetize that stake ""when the cycle recovers"" for airlines post-pandemic.General Electric is in the middle of a multiyear turnaround. The company is currently worth about one-sixth of its $600 billion market cap at the turn of the century, weighed down by its massive debt load and some market-topping acquisitions.The new GE will be smaller and more focused on aviation, healthcare, power, and renewables, with most of its financing and debt tied to those industrial businesses.Happe said that she expects current-quarter cash flow for GE to be ""meaningfully improved"" from the first quarter of 2020, a key metric analysts have been following in tracking the turnaround."
This may be the start of the run up leading to earnings report next week.
Reverse splits have never and will never benefit existing investors... end of story
"lower price will only benefits the professional and LONG for big funds holding, after few years, it will worth more. and GE may suddenly RS and buy back and consolidate shares and give dividends, kicked out those penny share holders, sorry it sound unfair, but this is a wealthy humans casino. Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, they do not buy those shares that are 14 dollars. it is you who think 10 to 14 dollars and died for it.Long live GE - that is why they say LONG live the King - LONG"
"After split, GE might increase dividend from 8 cents to 10 cents. That would be 25% increase."
"GE Renewalble ALONE should be valued $$290 BILLION. $33 a share. or 15 times revenue, other Renewables are valued 30 times revenue. Even if you give half that value to GE Renewalble near $20 BILLION REVENUE, That is easily $$290 BILLION or $32 share price just Renewable alone. Then add AVIATION crown-jewel, near monopoly, best most RELIABLE, generational most complex engendering technological advancement.. Then there is HEALTHCARE CT-Scan, MRI, X-Ray, etc TECHNOLOGIES... GE EASILY $$$100 STOCK. GE could also start charging higher price margins on AVIATION ENGINES.. AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, Chatging high margine why not GE..."

"@everyoneneedshealthcare --Just so you know, this MB software is designed to accept multiple lines per post. Also lot's of people don't need health care.

Except for a small few, employees are all hard working, honest folks who give their all to make the company prosper by providing goods and services for society.

"Just wait till 1Q earnings comes out. Then timber, a shorters dream."
Culp is just asking for trouble Who knows where SP would be today without RS announcement?
Why did outstanding shares increase by over 60M since 2018 when every other reputable company is buying back shares?
Seems to be clawing its way back up. 20 by year end?
I'm Taking a poll to reach 40 thumbs up. Please put a thumbs up if you think Rick is a long.
"$GE CEO Larry Culp knows what he's doing. Buy the dip and as many shares as you can afford. This stock is set to double this year alone at it's current price and double at it's possible R/S price. The new deal is a multi billion dollar cash infusion that will be used to knock down debt while still maintaining a 47% stake. Increased positive cash flow, reduced debt, and now potentially less shares outstanding to be manipulated. I know that there are a lot of other positives that were left out. Hopefully other bullish $GE investors on the board can pick up where I left off."
1 billion shares still a lot of shares. GE wants to make huge profits for strong holders instead of weak traders. This is why the reverse split. I’m holding long for this reason. Valuations will also go up much higher after the reverse merger.
Don’t give in to these rhetoric bss. Just stay long! Next $20plus!I’m holding onto thousands of my shares. Stay long !
So are we still $15 by friday? Just want to be clear on it.
"GE $20 by year-end, my call!! Also like $BA recovery underway!!!! Also, 500% upside based on the these recent Price Targets, NOTE: way OVER SOLD, again WAY OVER SOLD: ACRXJanuary 12, 2021 (Cantor Fitzgerald FOUNDED in 1945)In line with his bullish stance, Folkes rates ACRX a Buy, and his $9 price target implies room for a stunning 552% upside potential in the next 12 months.ACELRX (ACRX) GETS A BUY RATING FROM H.C.

The company’s shares closed last Tuesday at $1.92."
$13.50 at close would be nice!!
"For those saying this is a good idea, just remember that the average investor won't buy GE at over $100 a share and the market knows it by the -5% today. I understand the reasoning, as they are about to gain millions of shares and it will further increase their market shares, but it will make GE look like a better stock than it is at this point and it will likely fall a lot more after the split. Reverse splits are a sign of a company struggling to stay afloat by making their stock look more expensive. All I know is they better adjust the dividend to .32 as well and once healthy, better get it up to $2 a share or more (per year)."
What a Carnage of the broad market! 4 -6% drop on most stocks. The Dow should be down 1000 points or more for this carnage!4 more years of Socialism?
"Well it’s Saturday and GE pps is still trading below $14. You know the price pps the stock was trading the day of the analyst meeting when the RS was announced. It’s funny to me to think that people think think this stock is going to $16, $25, $30 this year. I guess we’ll see. There’s not going to be any additional new news when they report 2Q results. That has already been baked in."
Perhaps Citigroup analyst saw some similarities between Citigroup and GE. Citigroup had a 10 for 1 over 10 years ago and have range traded between $4 and $7. This might explain the 30% upside the analyst is expecting for GE. That would nice but JPM sees it differently. JPM did not reverse split and share price has grown from $25 to $160.
If you don't like GE get your eyes checked 
"So, how does the reverse split sound?"
Seems to have met resistance but buying anyway still look for 20 a share pre split.
Good morning BAGGIES. Yes its coming.
"Culp is chiseling a lean and fundamentally sound juggernaut. I believe he wants this bad boy listed on the Dow again. The whales are much more attracted to higher-priced stocks. The panic over the r/s was absolutely absurd and fueled by short-selling misinformation artists. GE is on an ever-growing trajectory, take a look at its 1-year chart. This thing is really going to take off, get on and relax. Invest with your brain and not your emotions"
Opening over $14 tomorrow
More selling towards the end of the day. Short for another $0.15 profit today...
It was CNBC everyone gave it a buy with price target between 18-21 in 2021
The Fed injected 270 billion dollars to the market yesterday. You will see the market rise this coming week. GE will fly above $14 and could be $15.
Sold 6000 at 13.24
"remember... 1st q for GE is historically soft. Second, 1st Q we were still deep deep in Covid. Europe will open for travel this Q, so a plus. The march towards renewable energy is relentless. Covid is reducing here, another plus. One 2nd q worry is India. Q2 will be better than Q1 and Q3 will be better than Q2."
I love that GE is putting some Gee! In GE.Good luck...
"After doing some research it is apparent that all the big institutional holders, and mutual fund holders have increased their positions substantially."
Investors having unclarity of this RS proposal obviously...will take time to digest...hear Culp talk soon.
Volume was low....
GE is going green! What a trooper.
"$GE is a long term investment. This stock is massive and it moves slowly and very technically. The msnbc news recommendations pushed the price up too quickly, and that forced profit taking to remove weak handed speculators. The ""dip"" allowed a discount for real investors and institutions to get in or increase their position, I also increased my position during this time. If you are uber bullish you can also add on January 2022 $15 & $25 calls."
"GE packed your money at Baker Hughes and is slowing drawing it down. Share holders relationship with GE is very abusive. What have you gotten since GE was $30 per share and a promise of windfall? A reverse split, assets given away are basement prices, and 1 cent dividend."
Is GE heading higher?
Whoooaaa Newt!!
Everything going green. The whole market is starting to rip now.
"All Aviations UP nearly 300%, GE not even up 100% from March Lows $6.66, Mother of all Lows of 2008 World DESTRUCTION Financial crash $6.66... Yet GE has stronger profits, huge mounts of CASH LIQUIDITY $$100 BILLION+ $30 BILLION CASH from Leasing financing sell.. GE PAID off around $$100 BILLION debt, Pension, LTC money set aside and other.."
Expecting Booster-Stage to kick in midday...
"3 hrs ago I posted asking ‘why’ is the r/s such a horrible move and cannot get a response. Can anyone here explain why board of dir would vote for a move that inevitably moves their stock price lower?? R/s forgot priced stocks obviously is a move to avoid delisting, but this is not the case here so I must believe th they are acting in best interest of share price.....let’s not forget they own many more shares than anyone complaining on this board. Again, can I have a logical reason for this outrage??"
"Way too much misinformation on via the short sellers. ""Must get approval first from share holders in May 2021"""
"someone has posted me - Gene - and they are an imposter.Thus has been going on for a week. I cannot get anyone at Yahoo to get it stopped.....The illegal post said""That is the way is should work for ALL CEO Poor Performance.........The pay package was rejected by 58% of shareholder votes in the non-binding vote at today's annual meeting, emphasizing growing unease over GE's decision last August to essentially cut in half the stock price targets needed for Culp to qualify for equity-based compensation valued at as much as $232M.""Neutral"
"One of these will likely happen. Which do you prefer:1. GE splits at $5 and quickly move from $40 to $1002. GE splits at $13+ and slowly drops from $100+ to $40Thumbs up for 1, Thumbs down for 2"
That's a lovely shade of green you have on this morning darling...
getting full over here
Look like Culp spends most of his time now manipulating the stock for personal gain. I say adios to him
I bought GE when it was over $30 a share. I believe it will get there next year with the help of improving economy
At what point this is a buy?
They need to do share buyback.
"JJ is doing everything he can to try to convince GE longs that they should sell. He has NOT been successful. He also lies and does not provide links to what he states. OMG !!!!, I just noticed GE is down a WOPPING 10 cents in pre market, OMG, sell everything you have, your house, your wife and kids, and your cars, and then follow JJ's lead and go short with GE stock, OMG, the world is coming to an end for the longs. (I'm holding my 1000's of shares by the way, and my CALL options are way up)."
"what i see, an initial approval of ge 30 billion deal raising outlook followed by a more cautious evaluation listening to culps conference call.a first step, how did the funds vote looking at a rs."
GE is a great short. How are the BAGGIES doing today?
"GE pushing a burden on its share holders again. Wants less shares but cant afford a buy back, so lay it in our laps. how anyone thinks this is just noise is insane. Their is no reason to do this right now. but shares are up and CEO got his bonus and we get a reverse split cuz they dont like the share count. then buy back, but they cant afford it. That is bad news. in since 7, out at 13.20. still a good return but GE lost a long because this is not to a investors advantage."
As Market climbs GE declines as if it’s allergic.
Prepare to accumulate when it dropped under $13. The bears are trying to push it lower. It gave us long term investors to accumulate at different levels. Good luck to all.
Larry Culp is one of the most admired CEO's in the world and we have him leading GE back to sustainable health! I am so glad the board promoted him to this demanding role.
I see mid 20’s
"year of the CULP starts this week with forward guidance ,Stock trades over $15 before friday, ""shorts"" rush to cover, maybe Culp comes forward with what he'' do with $80 billion in cash,buying every share I can"
Sure looks like GE’s Wind Turbine business is taking off. That’s very nice to see.
"If GE announces cancellation of RS, there will be many huge lawsuits like no one have ever seen before. Everyone who bought GE shares before the announcement and sold after the announcement will be in line for a huge compensation. The only way to avoid the RS and avoid lawsuits is if it is voted down by shareholders."
"GE with $$45 billion in cash, and the dice controlled by CULP, very quick $20 coming"
UBS raises price target from 15 to 17. Sees turnaround plan moving right along.
"Jimmy Carter, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Stewart, Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Page, Jimmy Buffet, Jimmy Cracked Corn,.. The list is endless... No matter, GE's is still a very bad investment and has proven they are not interested in the retail investors business."
Voted against the R/S ...Good luck on Tuesday !
"Good to hedge with some put options for next week, in case the R/S approval tanks the share price to $12 or lower..."
I agree with Gene 
A Repeat of DANAHER is just beginning GE the best Buy on NYSE. fast move to $20
"This is why GE was stuck.... This overseas Hedge Fund Doofus...Hwang and his private investment firm, Archegos Capital Management, are now at the center of one of the biggest margin calls of all time -- a multibillion-dollar fiasco involving secretive market bets that were dangerously leveraged and unwound in a blink. His illegal tradings was holding GE in a headlock... Well, in all my dealings with them... you can never trust this that country to deal fair..."
"The reverse split does not work well for any company. The 8 for 1 r/s will make the share price at 104.00. 8 x 13 ..it will only benefit Larry culprit and other key officers in GE to receive their huge bonus’s. I have own lots of reverse splits and it did not end well. If Larry culprit and the board cancels the R/S we shareholders have a chance. Look at Citicorp and SunMicro shuck is no longer around the went know where for years. L. Culp will receive his 240 million bonus, because he got the share price over 100.00 not because the parts of the company are doing fabulous it’s because of the R/S. Larry Clup is a smart man , but he will drain the company dry."
"hello there genemuch appreciate your comments on Culp coming to GE and on RSsecond one first, i 100% agree with RSabout L. Culp he was brought in as member of GE board by Nelson Peltz who invested over 2B in GE at about $27 and rode that down all the way to $6, ED Garden from GE board is Peltz's partner and after 6 months on the board Culp was asked to take over as CEO and his answer was a flat NO and reminded them that he is not interested in any additional work and they came back to him with that offer of roughly $45 M if he takes the shares up 50% and almost $300M for taking the shares up to $30, either one by Sep 2024, from a base of about $12then covid comes in early 2020 after GE shares being up 50% for the year 2019 and now shares tank to $6 and puts milestones out of rich and Aug 2020 they renegociate his contract lowering the base to little over $6 which i totally agree withback to your comment of bringing Culp for CEO being a full size gamble i can tell you that i was not in the stock market but did follow Wall Street all my life, especially turn-around opportunities and i came across the story of L. Culp becoming CEO of GE after the fantastic performance at Danaher, you missed a funny and real part of that story :when he took over DHR at 39 he took over a so called mini-GE at the time as DHR was a small conglomerate with a Market cap of 20B while GE Market cap was 400B ... and by 2018 DHR was close to 200B and GE down to under 100B and decided GE and Culp was the most promising of all i ever new and luckily as real estate was a sellers market i sold two homes and averages down buying GE 2022 options striking as 7, 10, 12 and 15 starting when GE was at 11 on the way down to 6, but i never wavered as my family recommended i see a head doctorall and all Culp so far did a lot more than i ever dreamed at GE just to mention a few :- cut dividend- sold bio-pharma for a price over WS valuation- cut employees numbers by half by getting rid of BKR- refinanced all debt due '21 - '25 to '23 and over- waved salary 2020 and asked all management to take a 50% cut (great management example)- etc, etcthe only thing to worry me is agreeing with your concern about fuzzy Q1 2021 report especially selling receivables and cutting earnings by about 2%, are they desperate for cash ? if you get any more details about this issue please post it, i am learning a lot from you (i did only one thing all my life, designed nuclear power plants, so i am intensively learning about stocks and follow you closely)much appreciate any comments about above"

"Need to see some big move this year from Culp! Selling of GECAS is fine, but not transormational. Maybe a healthcare acquisition ? Or bolt on deals on IOT? But doe something or this stock will wither."
"NO gas, NO chips!"
GE is heavily manipulated currently and will not advance much till the day earnings is announced. Of course if the results would be good after all forcing it go up . This 20 cents back and forth is just cat and mouse game.
GE management made a very bad decision at the worst possible time. This stock could drop 20%
Tomorrow $14+
"I guess I got tricked by this annoying Reverse Split? Doesn't seem like Big Money actually cares? I'm super annoyed getting 100%, as GE has been extremely high risk, as ya'll know, and I held through all of it, even the Markopolous Disaster, so I could get the 400% that will be coming (if RS doesn't ruin it). Buy at 6 sell at 13 buy at 13? Not too excited about that! So ya'll don't worry about that RS? (I know it's actually a plus for the company -- I'm not worried about that. I'm worried about Traders, who are irrational nutjob panickers for the most part. If the RS will make all these babies sell, well, then, that ain't good for us Longs)."

When is the reverse split supposed to happen?
Onward and upward. Haters gonna hate...
The supposed need for a reverse split indicates GE has some kind of problem. It slammed the brakes on any capitol appreciation the stock was making.

Bears in GE have to be fatigued with the obvious righting of the ship that is regularly occurring with these reports. Buy the dips until $20 per share.

CEO pay and reverse split dramatically changed this equity and the way Wall Street treats it. The announcement slammed the brakes on a very vice run. I no longer have ANY confidence in management

I'm bullish on this stock in the long term. probably 15 or 16 by end of the summer but I am anticipating 12.5 or even 12 within the next 2 to 4 weeks. Just my opinion. Hopefully the pain gets out of the way soon so we can vertical north sooner rather than later.

Question from my friend. He only has five(5) GE shares. After the split wants to know if he will no longer be known as a GE share holder?
"Once GE finalizes the split, share delusion will begin and my guess is a year or two past the split they will have dumped an additional billion shares or more into the float.. This will make those shares bought and held into and past the RS diluted in price of up to 50% of original value. This can all accrue by issuance new shares and still maintain or slightly increase market cap. Good for insiders, bad for current holders."
"What shock, an early pre-prmarket selloff despite the futures being up. Institutions are liquidating at the open for the first 3 hours everyday."

"Think about if the earnings is not that great, then GE might drop to $12.50 and will take a few weeks to go back to the current price $13.60 because of the good long term. But if the earnings is good with good guidance, GE could be $20-$30 this year. The risk of short cash is now over. Nothing else can stop GE from going back to the throne."

On 4/26/2021 GE will pay a paltry dividend of 1 cent per share. It is unlikely that GE will continue to pay a quarterly dividend which will be 8 cents per share after the reverse split. It is most likely that the quarterly dividend will be cancelled entirely to save about $80 million per 1 billion new shares that will be issued to pay down debt.

Some money managers have a policy not to buy a stock under $10. No doubt that's the main reason for the reverse split.
"Much worse was expected from GE, i added more at $13.05. Aviation clearly has seen the bottom and outlook for TY is good. You can play safe with GE for 20-50% profit or loose your hair with other risky stocks. I’m in for a long haul. Always do your dd. GL"
They are pinning the strike on the 12.50 call options that expire today. With 10 year bond yields spiking again today the sector rotation trade is back on. GE is oversold. Watch it pop to the upside next week.
"Usually when a dog like this makes changes at the top and begins focusing on what’s worthwhile and selling off what doesn’t make sense the rebound in the stock can be significant. GE has been a basement dweller for so long and now they are actually in the sweet spot of what the rebounding economy wants. Comps for GE are pitiful, the valuation even to its peers is way discounted. This really has potential to trade to $35-$40 range this year, which seems ludicrous but turnaround stories like this generally way overshoot what the market expects."
"I think GE suffers from poor communication during these calls. The answers to questions are convoluted. Some of the questions show that analysts are confused by the accounting and commentary. There is always a sense that GE is continually shifting targets and benchmarks. The whole discussion on factoring and cash flow comparisons highligh GE problem. I usually ignore Tusa, but he was right to suggest that GE issue an 8K to clarify."

Autopilots are dangerous and most Governments wont allow its use anyway, and neither will insurance companies pay for coverage. Who is liable when an autodrive system is engaged and the car crashes? The ""driver""? Musk is a genious at getting the Government and Investors to pay for his adventures. No one needs SpaceX, yet NASA is spending our money outsourcing stuff it could do itself. I would rather have critical space technology in a Government program than a private one. Just look at all the stuff ups with COVID vaccines. Millions have died because drug manufactureres were competing rather than cooperating. They under invested in capacity because they did not see $$ in making vaccines. Time for Governments around the world to bring vaccine production and research ""in-house"" again, as it used to be. The privatisation of healthcare has failed miserabley."

"Just sold 5,092 shares going to invest into the strong leadership of China "
jj knows reverse splits. Remember SRRA? LOL
CEO picked a VERY bad time to mess with the stock
"A reverse split will only happen if the big money funds vote yes. Since they almost always vote management way. I think it is a done deal. i also think the stock will take a price hit. alot of shares are going to be sold out into the market. every investor with less than 8 shares is being sold into cash on the 8 for 1. also alot of people will see it as a small number of shares in there account and sell to get rid of odd lots in there account. GE truly has to many shares outstanding, and to many small investors. It cost alot of money to handle millions of small share accounts. Yes, Yes, Yes i know the value is the same money after the reverse split, but to many investors it is a mental thing that throws them when they see there share count drop. They sell, which put pressure on the stock. stock price drops other people sell to protect the value in there accounts. I personally will not sell my cost base is 6.50 per share, and i will buy more after the reverse split and the stock takes a temporary price hit."
"The media keep talking about leaner, stronger GE. But this is what I see,1. Asset sell off 2. Dividend cut 3. Reverse split at $14?4. $200 give away5. price goal drop of $30 to $16 until 2022 (at least)Leaner and stronger? For someone who has tried lean cuisine, I tell you, I will always go for a big mac. Nothing wrong with that."
"GE behaved as it expected recently. Market makers and traders fighting each other heavily because of the option expiration today. Looks both side wins ; i.e, It trades between $13 to $13.7. It allows both sides to have opportunities to exit. Not like before, one side was in control. This is a good sign. This means GE will consolidate here and prepare for next up trend in near future. If you are waiting to get on the train, it would be great opportunity to load some shares when it traded under $13 temporarily such as this morning. Good luck to all."

"GE has finally turned back into a boring, lame stock that barely moves. 6 months it's range is 12.50 - 14. I think it's safe to say, all the pumpers that said ""mark my words"" it will be at $15 or $16 or higher were wrong, as expected."
"30k (25k call, 5k put) contracts option strike price at $13.5, it looks GE will close at $13.5. Next week, it will be much more volatile since there are large number of outstanding option contracts. From the number, I think bears will try to push it down under $13 and bulls could push it up to $14 next week. Thus, buy if it dropped under $13 and unload some trading shares if it reaches $14."
"While you are here talking up GE and Culp instead of facing the reality of a reverse split and the subsequent dilution, Ally Financial has jumped from $19 to $48 and still rising. Now how great is JJ Brown?"

"More false news by analysts that cant read the GE financials....It gets tiring to look at FAKE NEWS. All that untrue reporting gets old.It is wearying to see a financial person stripping all the footnotes from a financial report and claiming it changes the results by $7.6 billion less profit for General Electric.. That accounting method reminds me of my wife. She can remember the current debt we have but she never counts the stock I own. She never counts our paid up house value. She discounts all the property I own. She never counts any of my assets. Using that formula she has me always broke. That is a ridiculous way to count.... The 3 credit bureaus use the exact same logic. They tell me when I charge a card- not what I have behind that charge as assets. To them I am always overspent - but it is untrue.In corporate America I have seen the footnote used dozens of times. It is a necessary thing to explain why something was done and why it was legal and fair.Today the GE headline news was written by a Forbes using a thing called Robo-Analyst by Hunter Anderson.He claims he read all 110 pages of the GE 10k filing for end of 2020 and he says the footnotes are hiding real losses of 7.8 billion.I also have read and studied all the 110 pages of the 2020 GE 10-k. I completely disagree with the Anderson conclusion....A footnote in their most recent 10k only EXPLAINS any CHARGE .... The final numbers are what is reported to all OF US and they are what you would rely on....Their auditors would never allow ""sham"" charges because that would be illegal and be fraud....In corporate financials I want to see what they spent on so I can see if it will reoccur again. MOST OF THE FOOTNOTES ARE ONE TIME EXPENSES. They re there to tell me times will be better going ahead. I gladly read them and wish they were even more detailed - but they never are. What I do know is the real profits. The future going forward is found in the actual income statement numbers under income, expenses, and profit (most people love to call it free cash flow). The footnotes depress the FCF and the actual profit to REDUCE INCOME TXES among other reasons. So the take away is you just have to watch carefully what you read. I am only interested in the results that will continue over the next 3 years and could care less on the write offs last year. 2020 was a dog year for GE and a lot of others....In most of Anderson's statements he claims GE deducted costs which depresses earnings. Businesses does that to reduce taxes. It is smart and legal. Deducting more costs does not raise earnings. It simply explains why GE would have had more profit.Reading footnotes lets me decide if that expense will actually reduce earnings and increase your costs. It is totally judgement call. What I like about it is that it tells me the worse scenario and I can decide for myself what an ""impairment charge"" or ""restructure charge"" will be. In all cases it is a deduction - not an overstated profit of income.Things like closing plants, paying severance pays to ex employees, research, paying into the pension fund, paying off some of the GE Capital debt, changing the upcoming tax charges to meet the new expected results, paying off the SEC Wells settlement - all legitimate EXPENSES THAT REDUCE PROFITS -not add to them.As I said months ago, if I was Larry Culp I would put as much old garbage on the financial statements I could to get rid of the past and get ready for the future. It is old garbage. All of 2020 was a write off year to gt ready for an awesome upcoming 24 months. Here is just one glaring excellent example of a write off was in 2020. GE wrote off the $500 million GE spent on developing the offshore wind turbine they installed in Rotherdam. That 13gw wind turbine required lots of research. GE reported all the development costs for offshore wind turbines in 2020 against the 2020 Renewables income. They reported a division loss that year. If they had not spent the research money - they would have come close to even.I prefer the expense because it catapulted GE Wind into the lead. Nobody has touched them and I doubt they ever will. The real clincher is the demand for wind is so great and growing so fast that all three companies are in huge demand. So look carefully at what is real and close your eyes on what is untrue. I have zero trust in any analyst reporting on facts. They really just have ""hunches"" and nothing behind their hunches...."

"I bought into this company because of Larry Culp. A smart, hands on CEO. One of the few CEOs that didn't slip away from the Board Room to become a milk toast CEO. Larry, the company should earn becoming a Higher Priced Company. It should be Earned. GE has been demolished over many years of two very poorly run, window dressed CEOs. Companies that are about to be Delisted Reverse Stock Split. GE should earn their oats and you should earn your stripes. This is a Horrendous Idea. Your too anxious for your accolades and your position with Tech ""Elites"". Your shares should be bought back with the company proceeds.You don't get to grab the trophy the easy way by crushing the folks that put you in this position."

"just voted my GE stock all for the 8:1 reverse splitCouldn't be a better thing happening to the stock.Nobody loses a dime and we get rid of the day traders causing vast volume and way too much up nd down.You saw Thursday and Friday that the stock traveled all over the place and it was between $12.23 and $13.10. That vast movement is just a large problem.Shorts lose, longs lose, day traders lose, and only long term serious investors win.I am a long term serious investor - but it is not good for my peace of mind when I see GE drop 7% in a day or to and then rush back up the 7% in another day or two.There also are many false statements made by everyone about GE."
What a finish!!! looking at today's chart just tells it all. Great day for GE longs...just can't keep GE down anymore.Congratulations to all GE longs that held their shares today!
"What a coincidence....Culp earned almost the exact same money this year as GE earned this quarter. If he made less to 160 million he could have doubled the dividend this quarter. Shoot, I could torpedo this company at least as well as him for the 160M. Who wants to double their dividend and hire ME then."
Bull run from 6 wasn't good enough for CEO triangulating sp price with other people money will not work out well

"Funny , nobody was complaining about day traders when the stock hit 14 ? Now all the posts try to rationlize the RS as stopping day traders . That is absurd. It was instituional selling the last few days . Super high volumes. Always the same MANTRA nonsense. Day traders holding the stock back. But when the stock is soaring , nary a word on the trades. I recall the same thing when DAL was falling because of n Covid of course . As it went back and forth it was the day traders. From 29 to 34 it was day traders, day traders . Once it began the climb from 35 to 49 never a mention .Yes, for every seller there is a buyer. But again the posters leave out that when a stock declines that means more sellers than buyers."
"GE to be one of the companies to benefit the most from post pandemic, due to its positive core businesses strengthening and majority market share, balance sheet strengthening, liabilities exposure reduction. it has not been an easy story for the conglomerate and its share holders for a couple of years, but definitely under the current leadership is showing the right direction. have to be patience, and buy at this discounted prizes. Most analysts have a positive and outperform buy rating on the stock. I am long with the stock to see what evolves and benefit from it, do your own research and understand volatility and the game of market trading manipulation, believe on what you invest in, after educating yourself deeply on your investment. I personally look at all the fundamentals and technicals and all the different analyst points of view to base my decisions. good luck to all longs."

"GE will ""pop"" within hours after the Fed announces an interest rate increase. Bottom line improvement for pension related investments. $2,000,000,000 annual improvement for every .25% increase in interest rates. It's coming within the next 3 6 months. The US can't stop or slow down spending."
"I'd like to better understand this AerCap deal so please help me out if I describe this incorrectly. It seems that GE is selling off an unprofitable subsidiary. I'm not sure why some articles describe this as a merger when it's a sale to another entity. This is good for GE because they are cutting a loser. This hopefully will be good for the buyer, but GE investors only care about GE. GE will get cash. Adding cash and reducing losses is good. Noone is really talking about whether GE is getting a fair price, but considering it's a loser anything seems good. Does that about sum it up? Not really groundbreaking, but positive. Is this a good summary?"

GE did not overpay. Right now BKR is holding up GE and GE is dragging BKR down. BKR was trading down to $12 when GE gave up control and BKR become independent. Remember it was BHGE. Then it became BKR and share price jumped to $20.

GE doubled in 6 months off some very troubling historical low. I guess that was too quick for the CEO and BOD. What other reason could there be for this insane reverse split idea. It slammed the brakes on a decent run. Little is what it appears to be.
"General Electric Gains as Citigroup Resumes Coverage With 'Buy' RatingCitigroup analyst Andrew Kaplowitz sees a ""gradual but likely"" recovery in GE's struggling aviation business as the bank resumes coverage with a 'buy' rating on the stock.MARTIN BACCARDAXUPDATED:MAY 14, 2021 7:39 AM EDTORIGINAL:MAY 14, 2021General Electric (GE) - Get Report shares moved higher Friday after analysts at Citigroup reinstated their coverage of the industrial group with a 'buy' rating, citing a gradual recovery in its aviation business.Citigroup analyst Andrew Kaplowitz pegged a $17 price target on GE, alongside the reinstated 'buy' rating, amid evidence of improvements across the whole of its business portfolio under CEO Larry' Culp's turnaround plans that could trigger ""material upside"" in GE shares. Kaplowitz also cited a ""gradual but likely"" recovery in GE's struggling aviation business, which posted an overall decline in first quarter profits of 36%, but should get a boost from the Federal Aviation Administration's approval of Boeing's (BA) - Get Report fix for an electrical issue that had grounded around 100 of its 737 MAX jets. Boeing engines are made by GE in partnership with France's Safran SA (SAFRY) .General Electric shares were marked 1.25% higher in pre-market trading Friday to indicate an opening bell price of $13.13 each, a move that would extend the stock's year-to-date gain to around 21.5%.Late last month, GE posted stronger-than-expected first quarter earnings of 3 cents per share, as revenues jumped 16.6% to $17.1 billion, but held off on boosting its full-year profit forecast amid the ongoing hit to its aviation business from the global coronavirus pandemic."
"Group revenues, General Electric said, fell 16.6% to $17.1 billion, coming in shy of analysts' estimates of a $17.52 billion tally. Industrial free cash flow for the first quarter was $845 million, GE said, notably shy of the $1.5 billion Street forecast."
Maybe GE should not do the reverse stock since this will cause the stock to drop down to $6 again. Cancel such a deal. Let small investors able to invest with lower prices. This way more people can invest in GE
Will shareholders request to not increase pay for executives be ignored? This is the real GE. Nothing has changed. King Larry? lol

Culp thats it buddy...set up a Grammer school lemonade stand at your company sites. at least then you have a shot at beating earnings next E/R.
GE throwing a bone to institutions looking to buy. Buy the dip.
I guess another crappie day for GE. Never misses. Any day market is green GE is RED even despite good news out there. As I have said many times “it’s being manipulated “. As simple as that. TUSA pushing stock down to support his shorty and hedge funds clients. GE is leaner and meaner today and in its best position in the past 3 years and there is no reason for it to be down and kept down except for MAniPUlation folks.
"GE seems to have settled at a solid floor of $13.00, with a ceiling of $14.00. Not much to do with this stock until the final decision regarding the RS split decision May 4th. This may see a slight run towards $14 just before Shareholders meeting with hopes the Split will get a no vote. If they approve the ""1 share for every 8"" RS, watch out below this will be in single digits before Summer. I'll be positioning for the downward trend late Monday. Be Very Careful GE Longs invest wisely. -Regards-"
"Wow, the DOW closed green, but this P0S as usual red. A shorters dream."
"Same pattern about 6 monrhs ago..Big spike up, given back and more the next day and continued downwards for a few weeks after that.."
"The 1 for 8 Reverse Spit is one of the most ill conceived ideas that I have ever heard of. Culp might have gotten away with a 1 for 2, but this 1 for 8 RS is just a short players dream. If approved, the stock will open over $100 and slowly drift down to $60 to $70. The desirability of GE as a come back stock without the leverage of significant growth and stock price will be lost."
Buyers will regret not getting GE shares today trying to save few more pennies on price... tomorrow they will pay more.

GE will execute a 1 for 8 reverse split. What else do you want to know about earnings report?

"Freight Of The World: Global Cargo Airline Picks GE Engines To Power New Boeing 747 Jetsby The GE Aviation BlogThe global freight carrier Atlas Air Worldwide said on Tuesday a quartet of new Boeing 747-8 freighters it ordered from Boeing in January will be powered by GE jet engines. The deal, which includes engines and overhaul services, is valued at $800 million at list price over the life of the 20-year maintenance contract.“The 747-8F powered with GEnx engines gives us the best and most versatile widebody freighter in the market,” said John W. Dietrich, Atlas Air Worldwide president and chief executive officer. “Our partnership with GE Aviation supports our longstanding focus on leading edge technology. We look forward to continuing to provide world-class service to our customers.”Atlas is the world’s largest operator of Boeing 747 freighter aircraft, with 53 of them in its fleet. The Boeing 747-8 is the latest and the most advanced version of the Boeing 747, also known as the Jumbo Jet, which helped redefine air travel over the last half-century.Above: A GEnx-2B engine at GE Aviation's test center in Peebles, Ohio. Image credit: GE Aviation. Top image: An Atlas Air Boeing 747-8. A new deal between GE and Atlas Air includes engines and overhaul services, is valued at $800 million at list price over the life of the 20-year maintenance contract. Image credit: Atlas Air.Each of the new planes carries four GEnx-2B jet engines, a close relative of the efficient engines that power another advanced Boeing jet, the 787 Dreamliner. Atlas said its new planes will have 20% higher payload capacity and 16% lower fuel consumption than the previous version, the 747-400.Airlines and other GE customers have ordered more than 2,500 GEnx engines since they entered service early in the last decade, making it the fastest-selling, high-thrust engine in GE’s history.The engine owes its popularity, in part, to advanced technologies and materials that helped it achieve the highest reliability and utilization, lowest fuel burn and longest range capable of any engine in its thrust class, according to GE. For example, the GEnx is the world’s first commercial engine with both a carbon fiber composite front fan case and fan blades. The material — which GE first used for fan blades on the GE90 engine — helps make the fan module lighter and corrosion-resistant, simplify maintenance, and improve reliability. GE Aviation has also developed a 3D-printed component for the engine that helps to further reduce its weight. The GEnx is also the quietest engine GE produces.“The GEnx-2B engines have proven their reliability and durability since entering service almost a decade ago, and GE Aviation is committed to providing full support for these engines long into the future,” said Jason Tonich, vice president and general manager of global sales and marketing at GE Aviation."

"General Electric Revenue Slides in First Quarter as Aviation Weighs But Earnings Top Street Expectations9:41 AM ET, 04/27/2021 - MT Newswires09:41 AM EDT, 04/27/2021 (MT Newswires) -- General Electric (GE) reported mixed results for the first quarter, with revenue sliding from a year earlier to miss analysts' views as the company's aviation business struggled, while earnings for the conglomerate unexpectedly advanced.In a statement Tuesday, the Boston-based firm said adjusted earnings rose to $0.03 a share from $0.02 in the same period of 2020, while analysts polled by Capital IQ were expecting a decrease to $0.01 a share on a normalized basis. Revenue slid 12% to $17.12 billion, while the Street was looking for $17.48 billion.""We are improving our cash performance and profitability with Industrial free cash flow growth of $1.7 billion year-over-year, excluding biopharma, and organic margin expansion across all segments, except aviation,"" said Chief Executive H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. ""This continued progress sets us up well to deliver on our 2021 commitments.""Aviation segment revenue dropped 28% from a year ago to $4.99 billion, as orders fell amid ""ongoing pandemic-related challenges,"" the company said. Revenue in healthcare fell 9% to $4.31 billion, although the company said the segment rose 7% organically with some medical procedures returning to pre-pandemic levels.GE's power segment saw revenue slide 3% to $3.92 billion while orders were down 12% amid declines in the gas power and power portfolios businesses, although gas turbine orders were up by nine year-on-year to 18. Revenue in renewable energy rose 2% to $3.25 billion as onshore and offshore wind orders increased.Culp said the deal to combine its GE Capital Aviation Services plane-leasing business to AerCap, announced in the March quarter, will give it cash and a ""meaningful equity stake for further upside and flexibility as the aviation industry recovers."" When the deal was announced last month, GE said it would get about $24 billion in cash and shares that represent about 46% ownership in the joint company.""We are shifting more toward offense and capturing opportunities in the energy transition, precision health, and future of flight,"" Culp said Tuesday. ""I am confident we are well positioned to drive profitable growth, achieving high single digit free cash flow margins over time and creating long-term value for shareholders.""GE reiterated guidance for adjusted EPS of $0.15 to $0.25 for 2021 and industrial revenue growth in the low single-digit range on an organic basis. The Street is looking for EPS of $0.24."

"The good news is after the initial drop in price, it held the line for the most part for the rest of the day. The RS is only a possibility at this point. It has to be approved by shareholders and it is months away. I think a 4 for 1 RS is better than an 8 to 1. But overall, whether one gets a wallet of 10 five dollar bills or a wallets with a 50 dollar bill, its the same amount of money."

"I acquired my GE position in the early 1980s. Multiple splits since then cumulate at 48-1. My cost basis is a few pennies more than $1. Dividends have totalled many times the original purchase price. Because my number of shares was not evenly divisible by 8, the reverse split would mean having to pay capital gains on the cash equivalent for the leftover fraction. So, I just bought enough shares to get me to 3600, which will be 450 post split. And I'll hold that until I die, let my kids inherit with a new cost basis. Is this a great country, or what?"

So at least share holders are not sleepingBut here is my q. Finally did they approve the reverse split or defeat it?I bought at 3.90 roughly 10,000 shares. And I feel like they need to leave it alone. GE management almost wrecked this company they need to pull their boot straps up and climb back to the 20-30'sAny thoughts? Or does the 8/1 reverse get rid of a lot of riff raff?"
"It might close to 100,000,000 volume"
Bears couldn’t bring down GE under $13 last week. I don’t think bulls will let them success this week either.
Possibly closed at 13.05
CRAMER SAYS BUY GE . NOT ME.
Treacherous markets.. Be careful with your stock picks..
Renewable Wind orders rolling in.... Power orders for gas turbines rolling in.... Aviation engine orders rolling in.... Health now has breakthrough portable color scanners for orders.... All cylinders are kicking in.... market will catch on and then all will be Great for GE Investors! ....
I really like GE. however the stock has been going up for 6 months why try to fix something that's not broken.
A close above $14 by the end of the week would be great. It’s nice to see some decent volume lately as well
What a very successful day. Congratulations everybody.
"Rick = Short Baggie !. He kept shorting from 6 all the way up to 14 and is losing his shorts, hahahaha."
"GE expects a ""pronounced"" aviation services recovery in 2021. Looking good ahead.Show me the money..."
WOW!! The 1 year chart makes me want to have a vessel full of some beverage 
"$15 real soon ,plus a CULP announcement"
I don't like it. I've seen too many stocks dip after a reverse split. Sitting this one out.
Up .25 already and it’s a bad day in markets only because UBS upgraded to 15
Incredible set up here - significant news probably a week or two away just prior to earnings.
I personally like the news. Nothing has changed with the company. Why buy back stock when you don't have to spend money to reduce float? I'm a long term holder here. Most people can't see past 2 days. Bash away because I'm not selling!
Ge doing a reverse stock split ?
No valid case for the shorts here. GE is rocking.
Holding strong in a very red market. Momentum is still strong. Culp is getting GE back to glory. Will be over $20 by summer
"At $30 per share, GE promise windfall to investors. The only thing the fell was the stock price. Even the little wind drip called dividend was taken away. Lots of assets were divested and the money drifted away with the wind. Check your wallet, do you see any GE penny? nope."
"Hey jj Dewd, how did you like playing each other's skin flute last night?"
"Long time holders frustrated. Good news I’m here now, been buying an accumulating. ;) $1.2m. This puppy easy hits $20. Shorts don’t be haters, you had a great run from 2017-2020. Don’t marry your position."
I knew I should have sold above 12.00 for a tiny profit... greed
At what price should I take the bait?
"Analysts say, that new President will increase corporate income tax, which will be a burden for GE. Will check losses carried forward from GE...can not believe that this will have any short or mid term impact. But I wait for budget for renewables. This will have impact !!"
So Barons is still quoting Tusa who has been downgrading the company from it low of 5.48. The stock has gained $50 billion in market in sync with his downgrading. And to think he is making a 6 figures income with bonuses.
microsoft was split many times and the stock went up. . the board of ge is doing the opposite. i think it is better to kick the face of the members of the board who proposed reverses split.
this has to be manipulation.
RS will knock jj out and chicken  for ever
Great if Berkshire added GE after Munger endorse
Reddit could make GE $200. IN ONE DAY.
Will break $10 next month...
"GE share holders this is your Captain speaking. First I would like to take time to thank all those Long's for Holden we just been cleared from the holding pattern we will be clearing from our present altitude of $13 to $13.5 and then we are cleared by ATC to expect further clearance around $14. Once again my crew and I thank you again for believing in GE products. IMHO, GLTA the Looooongs."
GE management is just like Lucy
Uptick in Clown activity detected.
It is time for the dividend to be increased!
"You can tell by the volume that Wall Street wants GE collared. Be patient, the street is living in the past. Buy."
GE’s pentup demand is huge. Buy any dips. This is a gift.
Can't wait for tomorrow! 
"GE Renewable Energy said Monday it has signed contracts with Orsted North America to provide its Ocean Wind offshore wind farm off Atlantic City with its 12 MW turbines and to service and warranty them for five years. They are the largest and most powerful turbines in the world, and will first be deployed by Orsted at its Skipjack farm off Maryland..."
"OH GOD 50,000 SHARES WANT TO GET OUT AT 12.57 LAST MINUTE SELLING HARD"
Looks like the board has no faith in GEs turnaround. Pricing GE with other companies at about 110 billion in market cap. What a joke!
"Big Pension Bought Up Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, and GE Stock"
Should close back up
Steady climb to upwards of around $12 seems highly likely.
"low volume - I think the ;ow volume is a good sign because GE has lost a lot of short sellers. Any rational person knows we are speeding to the end of the pandemic. Today on the tv Scott Gottleib, on Pfizer board said pfizer has doubled the shots they are producing.A lot of the shots will be give to most people wanting them by April 1st after which there will be an oversupply of the pfizer, madera, etc immunization for all the others left.The stock is moving 20% last week up from 2 weeks ago showing a int struggle between two camps one betting long and the other betting short.The reduced volume tells me the bets downward re softening and it is just plain hesitancy now keeping the optimism from the stock rocketing to unsupportable levels.Better t wait for the obvious good upcoming news.What fool would be down on GE at this stage.On the other hand, there is nothing concrete until the 1st quarter results are announce in April.So thestock may move into the $12-$13 range but not for any real news.If any good news like a giant new wind contract comes out - the stock will shoot upward.Lackin news - the stock will keep trading sideways.."
Share holders get SCREWED again. I bought GE at $50.00 my wife and I got out heads handed to us. The just gets worse and worse with every passing year.
stock could be very close to a surge above $20
what is up with the announcement of a $.01 dividend? Is $.01 better than no sense?
GE management’s turnaround strategy...
GE crash stock thx culp
"Wave coming ? Who sold 6-7% below last closing this morning unless you have to ? GLTA, we will make it !!!"
Here comes the friday sell offSour hour is gonna be PAAAAAAAAINful
go ge! 13
this drop at the end of the day is not meanigful tomorrow at 11 to 12 that is the likely run down until late monday.
Tusa of JPM is no better thanThese hedge funds shorting and destroying companies. Tusa is still trying to bring GE down
The Georgia runoffs should be the Green light for GE to buy EOSE......and become a huge player in Green Energy. GE needs to do this before Tesla gobbles them up. Electricity Storage will be a multi-trillion dollar market.

GE GE GE GE GE GE THAT'S ALL I EVER HEAR
"Watch the selling increase as the ""West coast"" retail investors wake up and begin to realize how GE is cutting them out with a 1-8 reverse split. Give it another hour or so and we'll see this in the low $12.00's."
I see you’re slipping down in price over here a little bit some of y’all gonna be sad in the morning
"I might be wrong and hate to say it. The funds that bought in are slowly taking Ge down. I hope I'm wrong but this slow declining drip could go on for a couple of months if not longer. if market tanks, who knows when it will bottom out!!!!"
"General Electric (NYSE:GE).Binger said that as the company gets smaller the market is going to love it more. He is worried about the stock price because it has doubled from the bottom and the company has given an EPS guidance that was slightly below the consensus. He would not be a buyer at the current price level and he would wait for lower prices.Tatro is also not a buyer because there are too many other options out there. The company is shedding businesses in segments that are finally starting to turnaround, said Tatro. Even though it looks cheap on many metrics, investors should stay away, added Tatro."
Sorry to all who panicked and sold. I’m sure you guys will get an opportunity next time
"For a man like Culp, I do not ever believe he makes this amateur mistake on a good news day to announce RS. There has to be other motives. Either way, retail investors got giant up the hole without lube. I hope shorts will take this thing back to 7. (I do not do short game)."
"Buy GE, Ford!! god bless america"
Rocketing to $12............
Here we go!
Bought this beeatch at $6.75. Measly 4000 shares. But damn! It’s become my best performing stock in a while now. Don’t see a let up either. $20 a share by Easter. $50 by Christmas
I am out. I don't like reverse split.
"Quite sure that GE will Spinn Off business units, like Siemens did. GE Energy & GE Healthcare would be the result, whilst Finance and Aviation would remain.Don’t see GE buying lookalikes like FuelCell...EPS are (still) lousy and share price simply too high. Also here -hydrogen world- I see cooperations to happen like Siemens Energy will cooperate with AirLiquide for a new generation of electrolyzers. So it will be very interesting...."

"Tusa, who has always been right about GE, knows what time it is and maintains his $5 price target on GE."
The retail investor need to send a message to GE Management to Reverse Their decision on the reverse split!! This move cannot happen!! Its will bankrupt them!!!
Breaking the 12 barrier will happen very quickly. Everybody loves a comeback story. Lots of press on GE
GE long-term call options cheap and attractive; look @ 1/21/22--$20 Call options!

"ge speaking up adds some excitement,expected earnings for this quarter 2 cents per share,what does culp see going forward is the determining factor here"
If you people think a reverse split is good news you have no business investing..
a 1 for 8 reverse split ......... wow especially at this point of the gamedividend upped or staying at 1 penny \ sharea game changer for many and reevaluating our reasoning why we are hereseems culp is looking out for geinvestors need to look out for investor returns
"With all the emotions about GE, what about GM ?Both Americana history!"
"hedge funds trading, all are 10k plus order. dang it."
"Someone posted yesterday they were disappointed in the transaction with AER as GE was giving up GECAS. That is simply not the case. The amazing thing about the transaction is it pretty much leaves GECAS and GEs ability to generate cash flow from it the same. GE is getting 46% of a company, AER, that earns right now roughly $1 Billion per year. I tried to do some research on GECAS and the last thing I found was from 2018 when they said they earned roughly 1 billion. Assume that 1 billion carries to the new entity which would get AERs profit to 2 billion so GE will still be earning roughly 1 billion from it's 46% stake in AER and will have reduced its debt by $24 billion. This appears to be a rather ingenious transaction for GE.Also, Tusa is a liar. He said this adds 21 billion of debt to industrial GE. As the GE board member said yesterday GE Capital has 10 billion in cash which also comes over so the net debt is already down to 11 billion and then they will also own half of a company with a 15 billion market cap. Tusa must have known this when he reiterated his $5 price targe."
"i do not see the spy hoing much higher than 383, in fact i see a problem above 381. But, GE I can see going up to 12.29"

"Mr. Larry Culp has done an admirable job of bringing General Electric out of the pits. At this time, I believe our company is no longer in danger of demise. His expertise, business acumen, and educational background has enabled him to deliver this to us.As a shareholder, I would like for him to add one more thing to his impressive resume. I believe doing this would add the pizzazz which would accelerate GE's rise to stardom again. In my opinion, the addition of PHD in Engineering or Physics to his list of Business accomplishments would be appropriate. He's still a young man, very smart and we would certainly be happy, as his colleagues, to see this. Pick his school MIT, Purdue, Cornell many others."
Has Tusa made any comments today?

so GE hide their intention for the 1-8rev split in a big deal announcement
Hard to comprehend that GE was $6 6 months ago. We had a nice run.
Seems Bill Gates is under GE!
"What GE really needs to do to re-ignite its growth engine is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for GE (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if GE just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

GE’s major competitor in Wind Turbines gets a PE of 300 from the market. Maybe spinning off this business to shareholders would unlock value.

"hey guys, go ahead and sell. And buy tomorrow morning, today is not a good day for Ge. the market is not on our side"
"How much did GE pay for the BKR shares? Just like a GE investor wanting to ""cash out"" for another massive loss. Has anyone actually figured out what this company does anyhow? Oh right, it rips investors off and gives big bonuses to upper management. Just like it always has."

Thanks a lot Mr. CULP. It sure was not expected from you....The hell with the board suggestion. Don't you guys have financial advisers to check things out before coming out and announcing something that's not even thought about ? VERY VERY VERY BAD MOVE.....hopefully you have an explanation for this and hopefully you make an announcement ASAP before whipping out more of GE market cap.....we have already dropped from $130B to near $100B and going down further if you delay.... Who ever on the board made such suggestions need to be investigated for his intent....totally ridiculous idea and suggestion and on top of all announcement at such a crucial point..................STUPIDITY HAS NO LIMIT...analysts have already started to downgrade ...Thanks a lot for ignoring your faithful share holders
"if you buy GE at 5/6 dollars - you already make yourself a billionaire in just a year - it has doubled - it may go back to 9 dollars, if so sell at 11.20 buy it back at 9 - what can be wrong ??if you buy GE with 1 billion, you now have 2 billion (5 dollars to 11 dollars)if you buy GE and pay 1 dollar, you now have 2 dollars.what is that you do not understand ? - should you be here day trade with your hard earned money ???"

One way to get a 12.20 stock to 100 and make bad earnings numbers look better with less shares.
Expect Industrial free cash flow to be at least $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. The earnings will be released in 1/26/2021. GE will deliver positive cash flow and profit in 2021.
"Culp, in discussing the RS, in passing said that the current float ""puts it out of reach of peers and competitors"" or words very similar to that. I definitely heard ""out of reach."" If he was not just making a verbal typo for ""out of line with,"" or the equivalent, this could be an indication that he and the board are thinking about the practical use of GE stock in structuring M&A transactions. If that's true, the RS may have more to do with preparing to ""play offense"" in the future than I've heard discussed so far, and not as much to do with window dressing. Thoughts?"
will see $12 next week

Existing shareholders will be chasing GE only to break even until they die. Only problem is they never will... This is an unbelievable move by Culp that has destroyed existing shareholders.
"Tusa still on $5 target. He has given Culp no credit whatsoever. This guy is just so painfully short on GE; pressure on GE is going to be bad for a while - he will never see the light. However, Culp did screw up on the RS I think."

"There is no reason for a RS now that GE is starting to climb out of its hole.

If you trying to go long and strong this is the time to buy
"""Fundamental hasn't changed!"" is what everyone here says.Yes, a speculative fundamental that it will go up just because Boeing is going up.

Looks like GE will reduce more workers to make GE leaner but more nimble going forward. Cutting more fat will help one move quicker and stronger.
could have a short squeeze on GE to 18......at least this is a real company
"All right all you BAGGIES, I'm going to repeat myself. How do you read GE's announcement of its improving cash flow from 26 January 2021? Since a firm's ability to pay dividends depends both on its earnings and cash flow, the rise of GE's cash flow during 2020-Q4 marks a potential turnaround for the long-troubled company. If sustained, GE will be able to afford a dividend rise.Is that what's going on here? Because if it isn't, the argument that shares of GE are becoming overvalued and its nearing time to sell becomes stronger if its shares are really trading within the vertical range they have since 2018. No dividend increase, is a sell signal. Shorts once again will win while BAGGIES are left holding the bag Any cash this business generates will be applied to GEs huge debt, and undeserved bonuses for Culp. Wake up and smell the Rose's, oh I mean the stench this company is reeking."

"A first for GE’s 9HA.01 in China - Feb 1, 2021(www.dieselgasturbine.com/news/A-first-for-GE-s-9HA.01-in-China/8010017.article)GE announced the start of commercial operation of the 661 MW Junliangcheng Power Plant in Tianjin City, China.GE provided the power generation equipment for the new combined heat and power (CHP) gas power plant that replaced the existing coal-fired power plant.A GE9HA.01 gas turbine.The new plant, owned by China Huadian Tianjin Junliangcheng Power Generation Co., features the first commercially operating GE 9HA.01 technology in China. In addition to the 9HA.01 gas turbine, GE supplied the Mark* VIe Distributed Control Solution, for full combined cycle plant control and operation, while GE’s local partner on this project, Harbin Electric, provided the steam turbine, generator and balance-of-plant equipment for Juliangcheng."
"why attack GE, which company in USA or the world is not corrupt ? you pay more taxes than the weathy and coporations.if you do not like corruptions, why Amazon is 5000 per share.you are here because you alone would affort buying a stock that is under 12 dollars per share.if we do it right, all USA stocks should be around 4 dollars, and the one who do not pay diideneds, should be around 1.50 cents."
Me and GE. Will be here for awhile. I don’t care.
"Proposing a reverse split is a ploy to tank the stock and make it attractive to institutional buyers, its a slap in the face to every small retail investor plane and simple! This is the worst thing GE could have done to their loyal investors, pure evil play."
"A) GE is not going bankrupt so just stop with that nonsense.B) Reverse splits will result in deteriorated value.C) Average people will not be able to buy at $104D) Once it gets that high, it will be shorted down to $50E) It is a lot harder to grow $104 to $208 than it is $13 to $26F) They may not ultimately do this because they do not have to."
What a disgraceful rigged and manulipated con game. All of the analyst upped their price rating to 14.00 to 17.00. The the reverse split news came after the Deal with Ireland Aircraft leasing co for 30 billion. What kind of CFO & Board will do that after the reverse split. It does not make sense..unless they have cheap options . Larry Culp will now get his 25 million cause the share price will be over 25.00.....He is a #$%$.. Vote NO NO on the R/S...it does not fix anything...
"Netwood I agree with you. this a good price to buy GE from 10 to 11, back ip the truck. As long as you are not making 500,000 dolkars a year taxing the tich does not apply if and when this tax laws are pass. . I still like other stocks to, LMT 333, KO 48 FDX 243, even VZ at 56."
Really another day down 3%+?
GE will be a beautiful story of 2021. Balance sheet continues to get better every quarter.Not many stocks currently offer low risk high reward like GE in my opinion....do your own dd.
"a reverse split means only more room to short it down, which the market will do..."
As long as the Feds keep rates low the higher the stock market will continue to rise. The day they make a rate change to the upside look out below!!

"LOL, jj took the day off Thursday to stand in line at the Cash Advance office. It must suck not having a bank account."
"Mike T, with the correction on the market taking place, I do not think it will be like the one about 10 month ago in March. The VIX Is at 31 right now and frankly GE is holding up pretty good. If things get worth and they will before the market realize that the USA will be in track for a great recovery. GE does not appear to go to $9.5 to $10. I am loading up in the way down. have 3500 shares and prepared to sell 10 a 10.5 put to buy up to 8500 more shares."
no volume again. the talking heads keep praising the industrials!
"So far I am right on my first upgrade to buy with price target of $13 .. and Tusa is definitely wrong.. I had predicted $13 before end of Feb..Tusa is still $5 . Tusa is wrong again, and I am upgrading GE again to Strong Buy with 16 price target before end of June.Slow and Steady for big wins Long and Strong GE . Loser-Tusa is Short and weak .. Be Long or Be Wrong !!GE to $16 !!!!!!"
OH NO!!!! Reverse Stk Split....1 for 8
There is FEAR among shorts. Lots of FEAR.Shorts got Guillermo's 100% truthful catalyst post removed.EXTREME SHORT FEAR.Stay greedy my friends
SQUEEZE COMING...
Never forget people this is GE! A company that has burned its stock holders for decades and decades.That does not go away easily. How long did it take for people to forget the great depression of the 1930s?For generations no one wanted to buy stock. Same with GE. Investor sentiment is at all time lows with regard to GE. It takes time to fix that. GE results are no where close to changing our attitude.
"Typical move for GE after earnings. Up, then down, then up - will likely finish up. May move up or down tomorrow and then the following days will be a net UP! The upward trend is certain to be up near term."
bought at $11.50... looking to hold for 6 months or more... what ya think???
OH GOD GE GOING UP TO 11.55 NOW GO GO GO REDDIT ARMY BRING ON SHORT SQUEEZE
For those that are comparing reverse splits how many stocks only went down 5% on the day they announced it. Ive seen GE drop 5% on no news.
"there has been a lot of accounting f#ckery at ge over the last few years with all sorts of this and that charges, impairments etc..i would expect restatements down the road..."
"GE keeping strong the last month, 6 months, great to see. 15 by year end? Holding 12k+ @13.25"
giddy up
Should close that 12.6 gap today.
What’s up Doc? Not GE.
alot of call options being sold
"You have to give this company some respect. It has been around since beginning of time. Even though it is not a component of the DOW, it sure trades right along with it. GE is a legacy company with a hell of a lot history."
GE is on a roll. Their Renewable Energy Division will do well under The Harris Administration. Going to 15 before Memorial Day.
"$57 to $22 to $40 to $8 to $31 to $6 to ??? maybe as high as $20? ehhhh, maybe not but that is a very long term downtrend that isn't going away because of Larry, Darrell and Darrell. Or anyone else. I am pretty sure if it gets anywhere near $20 that some of these lifetime bag holders will cut and run. Without them, who will care about this loser stock? GE has been sold off piece by piece and is still suffering from a conglomerate discount. Which piece of GE is next to get the ax? That is all the hatchet man at the helm knows."
"The lead up to this announcement should be what T's people off. All of the so called ""bullish"" news was a setup to shareholders. He knew exactly what he was doing. The bad merger news was the icing on the cake. Trapping existing shareholders in their trades and slapping them down. I do know all of aviation is having a hard time getting more funding from traditional sources. A 1c dividend was never going to lure institutions into this. GE is in trouble still. Even if the bulls in here disagree. Look at the people that have unabashedly pumped this no matter what and ignore them. They are employees or retirees and pumping GE is their job. They are still pumping this as a positive. It isn't."
"I know not a big contract, but very important application if successful! GE wins $14 million to make water out of air - Times Union Scientists at General Electric's research lab in Niskayuna are working on new technology that would allow U.S. soldiers to brew drinking water on the battlefield out of nothing but the air they breathe."
$2 drop in 24 hours? Obviously the algos run through JPM. Buy the dipper with impunity. Going much higher!

How many CEOs come on CNBC to announce rev-splits? The average CNBC view who is just a viewer has probably never even heard of a reverse split. I mean the momentum FANG stocks that they talk about the entire day never even have to think about doing reverse splits. That term is never uttered on CNBC.
"Why is the market going down now? We ignored a global pandemic and an attempted coup, record federal debt and deficits!!"
We will empty out bottle of whiskey thru out tonight. ready to cheer up tomorrow. hahahhhahahahaa
"Whenever there is M&A, the buyer usually goes down and the seller goes up. Occasionally, when the market thinks it's a good deal, both sides can go up. Here both sides are going DOWN. That says it all. GE made a sale on decent terms and is still going down because of this rev-split. My guess is Larry Culp tried to pair the supposed good news of this leasing sale with the bad news of the rev-split that he wanted to do all along."
GOOD NEWS -- BYE BYE $5 TUSA :) LOL : US federal government is betting $20.3 million that General Electric Co. can turn an MRI machine used in hospitals into a renewable energy powerhouse.The Department of Energy's Wind Technologies Office recently awarded the grant to a team of engineers and scientists at GE Research in Niskayuna in hopes that they can take superconducting magnet technology from MRI machines and use it in the generators that create electricity in large industrial wind turbines that GE makes.
HEHEHE U SEE 13.04 HEHEHE COMING DOWN BIG TIME $12.50 AM GOING TO MAKE MONEY AGAIN ON MY SHORTEE POSITION.. THANK YOU LORD FOR THE BLESSINGS
"Will GE issue shares after the reverse split? If so, at what rate?"
GE is still the same.
You ALL going to wish you sold here. See you at $4
"No Vote RequiredDo Stockholders need to approve a reverse split?The board of directors does not need to get stockholder approval to authorize a reverse split. The board selects the reverse split ratio, such as issuing one share for every 10 shares owned, and announces the date the split takes effect. Whether this helps or hurts your stock portfolio depends on the company’s reason behind the split."
"Shorts are burning, loving it Don’t blame us told you, Pre market is not fluke Look at Frankfurt it up same amount in live trading"

"In a few years you'll be able to fill a whole shelf for a $1 with all the books of failed former GE execs: Jeff Immelt, Beth Comstock....."
Now that everyone knows there’s going to be a reverse split there is simply no support level here at all. Pure psychological trade here. Once the RV split is done it’ll continue to tank￼￼￼. It may hold 20 after the split if lucky.￼
Will be in the low 12's quick today. Shorts get to make more money.
Great news no one is hurt...Terrible news for Pratt & Whitney !!!! GE makes the best engines.. Aviation revenue will double... GE to $20 dollars soon !!!!
"Copper futures(HG) $4.30. Yikes! Ya, lets do infrastructure since nearly EVERY raw material is pushing new highs. What could go wrong? When do the tax hikes go through?"
"GE’s competition in Wind Turbines is Vesta......they get a 300 PE. Their stock trades for $1,300 per share. Come on, GE.......Spin of Wind to shareholders. Release the perceived value. I want the 300 PE. That’s a mega high Flyer!"
No thanks to the reverse split. I'm out.
"Hello Wendy, it's me, Stagflation!"

Thoughts on upcoming earnings?
life a hit knife thru butter... way to go GE... maybe you can announce some other 'idea' and take this to $5!!
What was left of jj's $600 stimulus went up in smoke this morning.
Yesterday morning pre-market this was a $14.40+ a share. Then the announcement. BOOM! Stock plunges over 15%. A lot of pundits on CNBC really pushing this stock prior to that news. Looking like FOOLS!This is a stock to avoid. Too much baggage.
Last chance to load up if there is going to be another $0.40-$0.50 pull back...

"For folks that still do not understand. Hedges can still ""borrow"" (steal) your shares to continue to short a stock. You can formally direct your brokerage that you do not consent to having your stocks ""borrowed"" (stolen) though in most likely hood your brokerage will tell you that you consented to this when you signed your agreements. Therefore the best way to stop your stocks from being ""borrowed"" (stolen interest free to you) set a sell limit for all your shares at 2.5x higher then the current price. And keep doing so.. If your current item doubles, simply cancel the current sell limit order and set a new one @ 2.5x the new current price.

GE deal to add 1 GWe in South Korea
haha GE is inverse of the greater market the last couple of weeks. when the market was tanking it was shooting up. now the market as a whole is rising and GE is tanking. go figure
patience is rewarded
And the selling continues after hours. Great stock to short. Thank you GE BOD.
"After over 100 years on the index, General Electric was booted from the Dow in 2018. The company was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance. GE shares are down 12% over the last 12 months. However, the company’s transformation plans seem to be working. The company ended the fourth quarter with $4.4 billion in industrial free cash flow. In 2021, the company expects to generate FCF of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion. In the fourth quarter, GE posted a non-GAAP EPS of $0.08, missing the consensus estimate by $0.01.A total of 45 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in General Electric at the end of the third quarter, down from 57 funds a quarter earlier."
"reverse stock split the death of a stock worst thing to hppen to investor ,we all know thepattern in ars it crashback down 65 to 85 percent.rs is when company probably in finacial trouble , they sound desparte like they need money ,probably new offering to raise money after rs that is usual pattern"
Still cheap.. Buy before big run up...
I have GE written down as a 100% gainer in 2021.
Broke through 12.22 next resistance at 13.24 then 15.01 going to be an interesting week. Looks like someone is taking a position.
A reverse split would be idiotic especially 1 for 8. This usually occurs when the stock is under $5.00 which GE is not. All it will to is turn away future investors as they will perceive the stock price as being too high.
timberrrrr....
no matter how you bashing but look at the balance sheet from year to year. analyists real logic to say it is beginning of recover. it was befor covid but you all knew that covid had caused stopping or worsing but GE is growing.
GE need to stop building jet fuel engines and go green.

Anyone have thoughts on what will happen when GE Quadruples their Dividend BACK to 4 Cents a share?Mr. Culp is not the only one who is getting a reward for performance.
What are the margins on Ge engine sales? Anyone?
Does ANYBODY still think GE is going back to $4??
"here we go again up up and away...,."
"a day for the longsge closing in on earnings,analysts turned quite positive, investors seem to follow.but then most of the market did well"
What happened to $12.25
does tusa officially hold a short position? or does he just advocate it?
"This will go all the way down to $1.50 by end of April. They can have 1 to 8 RS on May 1st, and the price will be exactly $12.00. Nothing will change except for the number of shares that you own."
"I am now a believer of the split. Just look at ba the last 2 days. Ge should be moving in lock step with ba. everyone of these orders ba is getting, also gets a ge engine. He is so manipulated it’s sickening. The split will prevent this in most cases. I’m voting yes."
I find it amusing that the dow is up 600 today and GE stinks. Crazy market we live with each day.
JJ likes to lose money. GE BREAKING OUT !!!.
"Doesn't appear there are too many more of these ""cheap"" pullback days ahead. I still won't purchase any more till they are confident enough to bring back the dividend n a meaningful way."
"wow, down 12% in 24 hours with no sign of stopping... way to go GE.... RS my #$%$"
Maybe 20 EOW? What do you guys think?
Stock moving back up
As I said yesterday $6.00 before the reverse split is a good buy. See you there.
Thanks for the profits. I al buying Anab now at 19.5Could double within 2 year...Good luck guys.
Did I buy the falling knife?
"Shorts made some when stock was between 6 and 8, now again between 10 and 12. No worries, the obvious news will keep pushing things up. Shorts can eat, but they wont feast forever on this company. Culp is better than you."
It will come back up.
I’m in. I can see $20 coming real soon.
Jack Welcho ruined this company. All of the competive management systems that HE set-up will eventually destroy the management of this company.
"awwww, did you buy the dip?"
"C’mon Culp, don’t let us down in the morning. Go GE."
5 billion cash....can we buy some shares back or something jeezzz
under 13 is the trap door anyone who bough this week is under water

"GE is trading above it resistance level of 11.55 which is great. If it can hold, we will see GE at 12.50 and 13+ just around the corner."

"No Country, NOT even Russia, China can make GE Aviation Engines. So GE VALUE WORTH shouldn't be $700 BILLION to $1 TRILLION?? China can make AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, Copy JPM products services, but not GE Aviation ENGINES (only a rare 2 or 3 companies can, even they FAIL in reliability. ONE and ONLY GE ENGINES BIGGEST, MOST RELIABLE, BIGGEST MARKET SHARE.. So, how much is GE WORTH?? China can not make AVIATION ENGINES. They trying very hard. But not yet. China, even Russia is DEPENDENT on GE ENGINES. China/Russia ordered GE Engines worth $20 BILLION.. AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, LOL NFLX can not say that.. Now tell me what that says about GE VALUE, HOW MUCH IS GE WORTH to USA and the world. Do study GE Assets, it's products and services.. PROUD TO OWN A TRUE Heart of American dream, whose assets, products and services spread across so many VITAL, CAN'T DO WITHOUT Technologies of USA WORLD GDP Economy.. I am Humbled by JPM to own GE..If NFLX trades between $200 BILLION and $130 BILLION, Shouldn't GE TRADE AT $900 BILLION and $1,000 BILLION ($1 TRILLION)??..."
GE is up over 12% so far in 2021 for those of you scoring at home.
Volume has been the same today as all of the othersLooks like we might slowly go down until TuesdayBrutal
Do you think GE could get to $20 in 2021? To $30 in 2022?
"Get you Nok shares, great time to start ling position, still under 5 some how."

"Top holders, Institutional Investors and BOD will bring down to approx $10. There might be some buy backs with lower price and then reverse split - who knows."
"What GE really needs to do to accelerate its growth rate and strengthen its technology leadership in the entire tech sector is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for GE (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if GE just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

"Looks like we will have a big down day today and this could pull down GE ... great time to accumulate GE shares. GE is no longer in a conversation that of if it will survive in a down market, but the conversation how its bound back will looks like. The market sentiment of GE has changed most due to many signs emerged showing that it is turning around not a matter of if but when. We might see 10 before the end of Jan 2019 and if Jan is good, so is the yr. If the market has a good yr, GE will have a handsome return. Happy trading and good luck to all. looks like i am going to add a few shares today."

Announcing RS at $14 could only point to some bad things coming that will drop the price. Dropping from $100+ is better than dropping from $14. No one wants to be delisted before selling off to a venture capitalist.

16 Million shares traded for a 1% drop in share price during 2 hrs of trickle down HFT algo/ bot trading!
"The companies GE competes with are generally smaller and less funded.You could never buy a stock for around $10 that has the same value going forward that GE has.In the past the stock was once over $50 a share. Then $40. Then $30, Then 20. Then $13 last year. Then $6 where i bought in at $5.98 after following the stock for over 40 years and hoping it would ever get that cheap.Not much has changed except far less employees,a lot lower pension needs and funded now over 82% - up from 70% just a couple of years ago.They now have less debt, smarter management, greater market position, they do command dominant industry products, and GE as access to every county in the world that need their advice, money, products, and partnership.So this continual bashing of General Electric is jut plain foolish.The stock is down because of the ""Robinhood Effect"" All the cutting costs and reducing debt and positioning themselves in the environment and buying innovation and developing new products. They are the real hidden messages for the company going ahead the next year.I can easily see the stock rising to $20, or $30, or even $40 for a patient investor over the next 2 or 3 years.There are a lot of poorly informed newer investors.All you have to do is look at the volume to see the last week that the really big money already is in the stock with patience waiting for forward results."
They are chopping away 2-3% every day!
When you have over 8 billion shares a couple wind turbine jobs does not mean squat!
"Let look at real facts for GEnothing can touch them on their Aviation. They own the market at 66% of all engines for airplane made.Their engines are also the most powerful and headed to the best fuel efficient with their new 10X model.They have 17% in military and also about 20% in service contracting their engines. It matters little on how fast that aviation market rebounds because the virus is being vaccinated and the forward look is all positive.Ad to that the Rolls Royce almost bankrupt picture and the Pratt & Whitney also propped up by Raytheon new ownership now - and Aviation is a very strong recovery for GE profits and volume The jewel in the crown is their renewable wind power division that is sweeping the offshore wind market and skunking Seimens and Vestes. Both are surprised with GE's powerful new Halaide 13MW turbines and this sweep will become the next leg for GE to incredible profits.Then their is the health care division. It just bought a new diagnostic small company and that makes their scanners are so far advanced that they will also rise to dominate the market in the next year or so. Every 3 seconds somewhere in this world they are using GE product like a scanner, monitors, etc in health facilities.An GE Capital has finally shrunk to just $10 billion, removed most of the bad debt, paid back a lot of the borrowed 5% funding, and is mostly offering new finding to the actual GE products like airplanes and engines and MRI scanners, and Halaide 13MW wind turbines.Their power division is also in better shape having ditch their coal, and now dominates about 25% of that market and is all over the world with their products."

"Can GE become the firm with a permanent solution solving overweight?They think they are on to something big they found in their Japanese research lab.Three days ago there was a story in a medical journal that GE labs in Japan had made a breakthrough using sound waves. It appears they found that when they targeted ultra sound waves directly focused on the liver, even the over fed laboratory rats ate far less than ever and the nerve package stimulating hunger reacted totally differently.The unsubstantiated findings that are being followed up on going forward are that this may be a major breakthrough to cure obesity and some other related issues to do with heart, diabitis, and stroke.Google GE Tokyo and GE weight loss or something like that and you should get the whole story.m"

The BS went from one of the worse in the business to very very solid n one of the best..he sold off non core assets n is now laser focused on their core businesses...the airline industry is coming back quicker, huge new orders expected, Renewable energy is ready to explode, etc..this company is so undervalued!! They will b generating prob $4 to $5B of FCF n this will grow exponentially over the next few years...they will start buying back stock n this will take off...dont be surprised if u see this in the high $20s to low $30s by the end of the year, honestly that's conservative!!!"

"GE is for long, if you keep saying PIG, it will turn into a PG, if you invest in GE when they are 5 dollars , it is more than double now, so invest 5 Billion, you have 10 billion now. This company has a lot of debts, but also has a lot of revenue, you cannot do it like Black Jack. Stocks according to Warren Buffet Long always win, Walmart used to be 12 dollars, Amazon used to be 8 dollars, if you hold long buy low sell high, you won't be here wasting time."
holding for a year once seemed like a good idea.
"Reverse split is very disappointing to me, though it makes no difference. Probably 1 for 3 would have been appreciated along with slow repurchase over a period time. It is known fact that lower prices appreciate faster and is more affordable to general public. In 2009 crisis I accumulated shares in financials, and industrials at a very low prices with the intent of accumulating dividends once they start raising them. I did same with GE (at 5-10 range)and I like to to hold as many shares as possible. Hmm."
Slow sell off into highly anticipated earnings. Interesting. I wonder what that could mean. Taking a wild guess and averaging down (Sad) on my March $12s. This dog likes to get kicked around
I have had stocks that did a stock reversal and lost even more money after the reversal. GE is not looking after the small investors with a reversal split. They want to look good for the big institutions. This is about us the small guys and we need to sale off all shares ASAP. First they took away our dividend know they want to screw us small investors. Let me say this to all small investors out there. Get out ASAP before you loose everything. I really thought Culp was making a difference but he is just like all the rest a F.
Low life @Nasir.
Pete Najarian is new GE bag holder. LOL @ Pete and anyone that follows him.

Anybody know how Baker Hughes price may help GE?
GE is up 19% so far this year. To the and setting up there for quiet a while. Goldman increased the target to $15.00 after talking with investor relations. This is the closest thing to insider information I can think of. They said they felt solid on FCF being on the improved side over last year. The Pratt & Whitney failures will drive the service revenue for GE on their engines and push sales upwards.

There’s BIG news coming in the next 3, 6, 9, 12 months.The uptrend will be growing steeper, and you want to be happy when GE cracks $100 after they allow commercial travel to resume normal flow. There will be a pop, as shorts get squeezed, and the masses run to catch the train...Take your shares out of the float with high limit orders, $30, $60, $90, ... which helps encourage a squeeze!"

there has to be some news coming out before market opens Wednesday. The stock up .50 on low volume& 8.5 billion shares outstanding. The Wednesday opening will be interesting. go go go GEEEE!!!!!!
"Low volume a lot of wait a seeing going on, will test 12's should close slightly down."
"Once all this is done, I'll be back on May when reverse split gets approved with sheer number of share hold percentage and drop another 50%, then I will be back again on the day of reverse split and short it again.Until then, you guys make sure to buy more!"
"The move also speeds up GE's turnaround, allowing it to slash its debt by $30 billion. It's also one of the biggest deals in GE's multiyear restructuring, following sales of the biotech unit, light bulb business, and a majority stake in its oil field services segment.Under the terms of the GECAS sale, GE will receive $24 billion in cash and 111.5 million shares, or the equivalent of a 46% stake in the combined entity. GE will also get another $1 billion from when the transaction closes in about nine to 12 months.Separately, GE's board also recommended a 1-for-8 reverse stock split and a ""corresponding proportionate reduction in the number of authorized shares.""Those actions are meant to adjust the number of outstanding shares in line to be more in line with companies that have comparable market caps, GE said."
With zero news...why would this drop so sharply? Seems like I am missing somethimg
"ge cfo more or less confirmed what we already know.not addressed a possible rs, and intended divvy"

CALLING THE TOP. MARKET REVERSAL COMING.
"Not only is being in GE good because of everything it currently has going for it under the leadership of Culp, but it is probably one of the most realistically price stocks right now. Solid value!!"
"Just when they thought I was out, they pull me back in. Now maybe we get some money from newly crowned Robinhoodies."
"Nice stock reaction to investors day. Way to go Culp and his cronies. Let's trim off some more market cap. The GECAS deal will become a wash, or no value after this price tumble."
I bailed out at 1365 After the RS news￼. Was planning on holding till at least 18. Which bozo had the idea of announcing a reverse split Just when the company was starting to get traction and investor confidence? Who’s the idiot that caused GE to dive bomb during ￼these record stock market highs?￼￼
Am in guy sold the Gze 10.5 p naked at .21 could gotten. 22 easy. Covered rate of return 90.76% how sweet.
"Amazing drop Thursday, tip of the dip, our uptrend will cross $14...Buy what you can at the open, just like last week. This is all planned to try to scare people. GE is a train, and it’s just getting started!!! Good luck to all"

Guys relax....GE had too many shares over 8 billion...reducing the number of shares will now make the stock fly up dollars instead of cents per day. Next stop increase dividends. Then u guys will buy back lol...hold on tight don’t sell trust in Culp
"GE once again is taking shareholders for a ride. Retail investors and some big boys bailing out after the investor day news. Great for us shorts. Short this pig back to single digits up until the reverse split. At 9 dollars a share, GE will be 72 dollars after reverse split. Also a 72 billion market cap company losing over 50 billion in market cap during this process. The GECAS sale will be a loss. Sell to make 30 billion, lose 50 billion in market cap and then some. Nice dlick move by the Harvard graduate dummies on the board."
smaller float will make this a more volatile stock to the upside and downside.
institutions are going to start selling - then you will see how bad it can get
Lord have mercy!
I think that person that has been calling for GE to go to $4 may be wrong.
Spinning off health care and 80% of that will be given to ge shareholders.. very positive for ge shareholders.

Wow! The sellers are running for the exits. My screens don' t lie.
Selling off due to split is nonsense.. I’m more concerned about them selling the aircraft leasing business
There is a reason why GE is 11.00 in a 12 year bull market with most all quality companies trading in the 200.00 range... when this market finally crashes all bets are off.

will it hold 13 or breakout?
Come on $14.00!!!!
very mixed opinion on reverse split announcement hitting the wires...
"How do you spell disappointing? GE, of course!"
Something is wrong. Every reverse split I was involved in went bankrupt. Many people pushed it saying what a great deal it was and I wound up holding the bag. Why didn't they discuss this when he was on CNBC. They just talked about the 30 billion? Vote NO.
"GE 4Qrt Free CASH FLOW near $$$5,000,000,000(BILLION), nearly equal to TSLA ENTIRE Qrt REVENUE, ABNB Whole year Entire REVENUE, NFLX Entire Qrt REVENUE.. LET THAT SINK IN..

Bout to break 200mil sell off with hours to go!! GE Management Failing big!!
I’m reading a LOT of hoping on this board. A lot of I’m hoping GE will beat tomorrow. I hope this goes to $20. Ect.... The thing is there’s a big difference between hoping for something and the reality. GE will go higher but it won’t be tomorrow. What’s going to drive this stock up is AVIATION!! Not healthcare and certainly not the hopey changey thing about Windmills and the “green” deal. That’s pure pipe dream. Unless aviation moves higher and more IMPORTANTLY that the outlook for aviation improves this year this stock is dead in the water. I just don’t see aviation making a comeback in 2021. Look at Alcoa they mine aluminum and they see that being down this year. That’s an important driver as airplane structures are mainly aluminum. Don’t believe me yet? Look at Arconic. They specialize in making airline parts and they are getting hammered too after a big run up last year. As I’ve said before almost every company that has reported so far has gotten hammered. GE will be no different. Will GE survive? Yes! But that doesn’t mean that this stock is moving north anytime soon. If you didn’t have the China Virus last year I would bet this would be trading in the 17 - 22 range. But here we are. HOPING to get above $11 again.

You Dope rookie investors will soon watch and learn what reverse splits are all about.. lol

"Ok so for all you folks that use terms like HOPE, IF, GUESS ect.... here are some cold hard facts: Cost of gas is going up, unemployment is going up, National debt is going up and a bill to pass $15 minimum wage is going to cripple small businesses and drive unemployment up higher. These are FACTS! More importantly, COVId is not going away anytime soon. The new mutation of the virus is going to only add to the uncertainty and hysteria of the government to justify more shut downs. It’s going to happen. Ask yourself what is that going to do to the overall market? Not just GE. Folks I said it before and I’ll say it again. The only way this stock goes higher is airline travel. If that’s dead in the water or any additional National or international shutdowns it’s going HAMMER stocks which are flirting at all time highs. I’m telling you now is the time to get in cash. Buy back later this year when things stabilize. Good luck to all."
Their clean energy division is doing great my question why not make EV batteries the EV battery business will see the fastest growth of any other business.GE has the technology and capacity to start right away

I'm kind of getting the impression that this company is on the cusp of turning a real profit for its investors. So let's just sit back and see what happens.
well Im hoping that the price goes upAnd STAYES up
Short please short more Ready for short squeeze
I thought the reverse split supposed to hype this stock up????
What a fricken nightmare
"this is the year for GE shareholders, and new buyers, everything is going for CULP/GE, plus Robin HOOD traders that want to squeeze holders that are short!!!, watch the forward statement Culp will give, this guy may see the value and throw in a $billion dollar buyback just to push eps along STOCK $25+ year end"
Carl Icahn should bring that $600 million over here to GE. We could use the volume.
"The MAX GE Stock chart shows a long downtrend, with three bottoms, and 5-year uptrends. Of course this could be the broader market, but it looks like GE is getting ready to rock the next 5-years"
We need to break $11.70...if we do could b a nice run set with little resistence to $13 or higher
will see $16 in place
Who is buying so fast?As soon as weak hands are out it will resume ascending flight .
who is buying a $7-8 stock after a 8-1 R/S proposed LOL
looks like the drop is accelerating.
here we go go..
down down DOWN DOWN GE BOY CLOSE IN THE RED PLEASE LORD THANK YOU GE FOR CLOSING RED ON FRIDAY ...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BIG BOYS PLEASE SELL IT HARD TO DEFEAT THIS UNBELIEVER TO THE LORD
20 year GE shareholder failure and you expect anything different now?
GE is trending on Reddit. Roll the dice shorts. JPM must have billions in there.
First fib 9.65
Whoever's at the J.P. Morgan cartel spewing that nonsense needs to put down the crack pipe and go to rehab.
$18.50-$19.00 before the hummingbirds are in your backyard.
Shorts be like
Heading to oversold territory. I built a position at 7.19 so this is just noise right now. If we hit sub 10 I’m loading up. Culp trimmed the fat and the RS is getting way too far overblown. If you were here before Culp you know he has only facilitated raising GE from the dead after what he inherited.
"On Feb 2020, GE was trading at around 13 a share. A year later, GE is in much better shape. If January earnings are in line, GE should be in the $13 range."
"can bet bt the time 3/31/2021 rolls around, every mutual fund in America will own GE. Buy."
Likely to give back half of Friday's gain on Monday?
"GE is SEVERELY UNDERVALUED, EXTREMELY UNDERVALUED.. BA, SPR, all aviation up 200%--400%, not GE, not even 100%. GE was already SEVERELY UNDERVALUED at $13, below $20, before Pandemic hit.. GE did not take part in the longest Bull Market.. Yet GE HEALTHCARE BOOMING, GE Renewal Growing, GE Aviation Growing, headed back to $$10 BILLION Profit.. GE sitting on Mountain of CASH & LIQUIDITY $$100 BILLION here and abroad. GE paid off $$70 BILLION debt/pension, and paid/set aside, money around $70 BILLION for ltc etc and bought back shares in 20016--2017.. Still GE sitting on MOUNTAIN of CASH $100 BILLION and liquidity.. GE IS SEVERELY UNDERVALUED, EXTREMELY UNDERVALUED.."
I’m buying
"Latest 13F from Berkshire Hathaway shows that 77,597 shares of GE were purchased. This represents a 143% increase from the last reporting period."
Do not vote for the reverse split; your vote will count.
smart money getting out
"crazy market, for those who want to know Robinhood, said Thursday it was restricting trading in certain stocks that have also been targeted by Reddit to only allow users to close out positions."
10K shares at 6 an change.... GE is my Stimulus check! BOOYAH!!!
Love to see thirteen today!
So some of us are buying GE because BA is going higher. Interesting logic indeed. Why not buy BA?
$15 coming
Just sell it short and come back next month to collect. Easy trade
Go GElets settle around 16
GE getting it’s mojo back?
What is the SP for a 1 for 8 RS at $8 ?
This surprise news will catch the shorts off guard. Could be an interesting day.

watching the 11.98 & 11.99 tennis matchGO 12! GO GE!
I own 120k shares. I don't want it cut down to few shares. Larry keep up the good work you're doing but leave the share price where it is for now. You bring the sp above $25 and you'll see how fast it shoots up.
And the financial engineering has begun
"Two things important for GE stock and volume1) the earlier people shorting the stock from last June to around the end of January are not playing that game now.They have lost a lot of money as the stock moved mostly upward fro m$6 to - $13 and their cash position has been decimated.A lot of the volume in the past month was people ""churning"" in and out of the market. That is not the case now.But there are still short trades with computer programs making lightening in and out minute by minute decisions.These are different because the bet is huge, the risk is low, and they are fairly safe bets on small changes. These will not really affect the GE stock moves if you look at it long term.2) The GE stock has heated up over the past 3 weeks moving from a low around $10.50 to $13. This move is really not supported by earnings or earnings rumor. It is based on the long term belief in Larry Culp, the effect the vaccine is making on the pandemic, the belief that within 6 months things will return to a better place, and the obvious new energy GE has shown on Renewables,improved carbon emmiting generator products in power, their new super sensitive scanning MRI and monitoring equipment (supposedly a game changer)the new 9X turbo jet engine that has passed government certification and approval All these and more giving GE dominance in the very environmental sensitive energy market.and you can add a 3rd thing3) GE has taken all the fat out of their game.Reduced employment from over 330,00 to 160,000 closed numerous redundant manufacturing plantsreduced the pension obligation to under 20% and around only $20 billion unfunded - possibly lowerreduced the GE Capital portfolio from a bloated $5 billion a while ago to around $10 billionimproved the GE Capital portfolio financing only top quality things they mostly make and sellgetting the long term life insurance annuity portfolio under control and reducing exposurereducing the overall corporate debt to a very manageable $20 billion or near thatLeaving the $8 billion in Baker Tool 33% ownership as an unused equitybeing savvy enough to keep the dividend a one centbeing also intelligent not to go out on a buying spree or spending their cash on stock buybackSo a long term investment in GE is a bet on old fashioned common sense.General Electric has made all the right moves to move back to a very high price based on a much better Free Cash Flow.It is mostly a matter of time - not if but whenAs an investor, I have the patience to wait for the results."
"There is no way Larry Clup can get his sign-on bonus unless the stock goes over 25.00. So now he cons the board to approve a 1-8 revers split to he collects the 25 million bonus. We have 8,7 billion shre outstanding with the R/S we'll have 6.9 billion outstanding 1.8 billion decrease in shares out. Nothing changes, but the share price goes to 104 if it stays at 13. 13 X 8 = 104. but our CFO collects a 25 million bonus cause the share price went over 25.00 .....VOTE NO ......What a con-man... Where is Elizabeth Warren on this one..."
"something to chew on concerning the RS proposal * stock price is sinking* stock price may fall farther if the shareholders vote for it In other words , the mention of the RS will take off a chunk of the price .. NOW .... Guess what can be done if the sp drops back to say 8 or 7 or less ..... BUYBACKS ON THE CHEAP !!!!!!"
well Jimbo Cramer just gave us absolutely no useful info on GE
Set-up on 5 year chart is sick after $14.50 area - straight shot to $30 - haven't seen a set-up like this in a while. NIO was close and we know what that did.
Earnings per share at $.58. Dividend should be raised to $.16. This will raise the price per share and compensate we long term investors.
Our stimulus just came. News of G selling Aircraft leasing unit will pump value into my GE share more than $1400!
get out before the institutions start the rush for the door
That's all folks
"GE IS THE ONLY MAJOR, MAJOR EV ELECTRIC STORY THEY ARE KEEPING UNDER THE RADAR, QUIET.. You do not hear a single noise attention to GE's name is ELECTRIC, GE Technology is ELECTRIC POWER. The Power generators, Electrical Equipments, Parts, the God knows switches and mains, many millions of ELECTRICAL components, are all GE.. All EV roads must go through GE.. Yet, GE NAME IS KEPT SECRETLY, SO MYSTERIOUSLY SILENT..*AVIATION ALONE ON ITS WAY BACK TO $$30 BILLION REVENUE, WITH $$$10 BILLION PROFITS, and was growing revenue at 10% 2019..*Then there is GE RENEWABLE IN JUST THE RIGHT SPOT AT THE RIGHT TIME, GROWTH AREA. GE HEALTHCARE always was growing, and is high margin life saving, millions of Hospital's Emergency Rooms only hope.. Yet NFLX, TSLA, NIO, ABNB, DASH are combined $$$$TRILLION+ DOLLAR Value, Yet their combined revenues are HALF that of GE..God bless Wallstreet"
institutional holders not happy -- looking for the sell
"Hold on to GE. I made the mistake of selling some Apple (aapl) in 1995 when the news was all negative. Big mistake on my part. GE is climbing steadily from some bad times. If a company can re-invent themselves (as Apple and others have, maybe GE too), then there will be a comeback. Not always, Kodak was not able to."
todays ge move could be related to texas disaster Larry Culp said at a conference that he expected GE to be part of the solution following Texas outages.
"With NASDAQ fading hard, GE will soar. Buy."
We need to break 13.06 if it is going to make a bigger run
This is an easy $20 if market plays nice.
"analyses supposedly ................ based on facts and individual assumptions as seen by the analysts , recently upped by many based on culps performance and forecast for 2021now tusas record for last year hasnt been great, his target 5$his belated upping to 7 then the pandemic hit and back to .....again ges latest er outperformed.tusa the sceptic in this game no longer calls ge a sell , short or underperform. his earlier ratings didnt quite work , my belief he is waiting to see more"
shorts are babies. This is long for the mature investor.
Moving in the right direction again. Nice :)
Volume moves a million per minute...look forward for the rest of the day and tomorrow ! Shorties: sleep well !!!
11.15 first fib.
will see $11.30 this closing bell
Does anyone know that GE makes the jet engines for Chinese fighters ? and now China wants to BUY General Electric.
RS are the last ditch effort to increase share price. That's not worth $40 dollar bonus let alone $40million.Why didn't board buy back shares when stock price was $6-8 dollars?
Classic Bear trap
Over 17 million shares premarketLast few weeks it was lucky to break 500kToday should be fun
"I’m getting my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine today. I have already booked 10 round trip plane flights for the rest of 2021. I have spent $0 on Travel over the last 14 months.......but will spend about $28,000 over the next 8 months. There are 150 Million Americans just like me. It’s going to be a boom. Book your travel now."
HEHEHE rever split down draft again next week hehehehe will we see $10 soon hehehehe newly minted bear LOL
Welcome all leaving tech for GE. Buy.
"done with it folks, got to run"
"Is GE working on ""better"" electric motor technology....applicable to EV and other applications. Also, are they involved in battery or other electric storage or distribution technology research and development.Thanks for any information regarding the above."
"Yahoo has 2 red arrows pointing downwards. In my opinion. it is fair to have 3 red arrows pointing down until GE starts to grow revenue. Sorry if you invested at $30 and they begin to sell off the house, cutting dividend and splitting. No reason to be trading above $5."
Shareholders: Do NOT vote in favor of the reverse split.I will vote NOT to reverse split.
"This is a shocking move. And caught everyone by surprize. It still has to be voted on. There appears to be no rational reasoning for it . Especially as well as things were going . As Jimmy pointed out , are never good. .These things if they do end well , take years to play out. I recall 3 I owned way back when , on stocks trading around what GE was the other day."
is this company a sick joke? did anyone else see the volume yesterday? absolutely no reason to be this down today
seeing that this happened on a green market day... the pull back coming tomorrow and next week will drive this to $10 and below....
People selling...... its going higher people
Dreams come true ge
When is going to be the split
Jeeez.... people are still buying loads of March 19th CALLS even after this run up... what could they possibly know that we don't?
JJ...you thereHello???JJAll the shorts that were so loud on Monday...anything???
Earnings may be a surprise ?
When was the last time Ge was up 5.88% in a single day?Nice movementBut it is interesting that the volume still seems to be low compared to when it was running 114 million average per day
"March 2 (Reuters) -* GE RESEARCH AND COLLABORATORS AWARDED DARPA PROJECT TO IMPROVE SPEED OF NUCLEIC ACID-BASED VACCINE MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION - STATEMENT* GE RESEARCH- GE’S DNA-BASED APPROACH COULD BE COMPATIBLE WITH NEW, RECENTLY APPROVED RNA-BASED COVID-19 VACCINES* GE RESEARCH - AWARDED FIVE-YEAR, UP TO $41 MILLION PROJECT THROUGH NEW PROGRAM FROM DARPA CALLED NUCLEIC ACIDS ON-DEMAND WORLDWIDE* GE RESEARCH-IN FINAL STAGES OF PROJECT WITH U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE’S DEFENSE THREAT REDUCTION AGENCY TO DEVELOP FASTER METHOD FOR MAKING DOSES OF DNA-BASED VACCINES"
Slow and steady advance is good for building support levels.
This is one of the very few bargains you can buy in today's market. Buy the dip.
Out of the 48 stocks on my watch list $GE is the only one on fire after hours. $GE to 24 dollars by years end!
wonder how many institutional investors are balling out.?
My guess is Tusa finally comes around tomorrow or Thursday...give accolades to Culp n puts a $25 price tag...he steals the show because now he has the highest target n knows if he becomes bullish the stock will exceed that target within six months!!! Lets see what happens!
"GE is on a bullish trend, especially with renewable energy being at the forefront of the democrats plan. There wind turbines are rated the ""world's most efficient wind turbine""."
305M share on market today... So ...
"You know why China controls 95% of rare metals crucial to Apple phones, U.S infrastructure, U.S aeronautics and the U.S nuclear defenses? Because the U.S Congress and banks would rather put all their money into useless Facebook buildings full of computer harddrives."
back to $10
Crazy to think that with one dumb idea Culp went from being one of the most loved CEO of GE to just another name on the list of hated corrupt CEOs of the past.
Headed back to single digits. Example of how a mismanaged company can totally destroy existing shareholders
I will dance naked in the street if GE hits $20 this year...
"Is tomorrow a ""sell the news"" event?"
"Guess what would help prevent power outages..... GE Gas Turbines and GE Steam Turbines. they don't freeze up, Just saying."
bottom has reached...only but up from here imo.
Will. GE be part of the DOW again.
Don't hold it over the weekend.
High demand to buy GE. Turn around play for 2021
"Chickens Coming Home To Roost report to the main office, Chicken to the main office please!"
"Twelve Dollars! Beautiful, absolutely beautiful. A really good start for 2021. Go GE."
VOTE NO FOR REVERSE SPLIT....
$12 very soon........momentum feels right.
reverse split
See ya at $15 soon
So literally put my meager life savings into GE at $6.15 a share. Unfortunately had to sell before year end but nearly doubled so I’m thrilled. Took a piece and put it on IQST. Currently flying management looking to up-list to NASDAQ have look.
Did Tusa get Viurs scan McAfee? hahahhahahhaha
MAX IS FLYING AGAIN... SO IS GE!!!
"SAFE SAFE SAFE! WE ARE SAFE! Texans no longer wearing a mask and I'm one of them. Texas economy is booming and so is GE! GE to $50.00 by year end! Time to go out bar hopping and celebrate! Live life to the fullest!Dow will be 45,000 by 2024. Don't believe negative jj; don't pay attention to 10-year treasury yield rates. Inflation will never increase. Go take a second mortgage on the house and place it all in GE. You will not go wrong. TRUST ME! The interest rate will never go up with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Saunders at the helm."
Jeff immelt ruined general electric. thank God he's gone. wherever he goes he will leave a path of destruction. Larry culp has picked up the pieces and will return GE to half of what it was. should be good enough for investors at this point to double their money within 2 years.
"In 2017-2018, this company was steered right into a giant brick wall doing 100 miles per hour. needless to say it has been down and out ever since. However, don't sell now just when it is wobbling back onto its feet again. I see a real light at the other end of the tunnel and it is flashing a green $15/share sign. I see GE at $15 sometime this year."
GE mgmt
"GE was about to break out from it's spinoffs like SYF, BKR and Wabtec and the dropped right back into the pile after the RS announcement. Sorry if you own GE and the spinoffs."
GE? This is the next mover?

Morgan ups target to 17 then this news . What in the world is GE scamming ?
Sold!
GE is into setting statics and metrics. Now all they measure is free cash flow. And Longs fall for this very bad metric. Legal corruption.
"Wow, 2 days since we closed at 12 and 13 is already in sight!"
"Some of us are rejoicing that GE is selling off parts and pieces and disappearing the money. My question to you is ""what do you own if you own the stock at all?"" You think the value of your stock in appreciating by selling off the businesses know as GE? It is like watching your neighbor sell off your land and you are happy do not have to mow the lawn anymore. Scratching my head."
4.4B FCF!! That's enough to be positive for the year!
we need T Rowe Price to dump entire holdings and then watch this turkey fall below $3.00
"GE Q1 Revenue 20.52B, 6.2B earnings. Last year's FCF was negative and Culp says it will improve this year. Still sounds pretty good to me. Culp always underpromises and over-delivers."
BREAK THE WALL
"Listen up, GE is next GME. I am telling. I have done my research, loaded my shares and ready to go. BUY BUY BUY"
This is the reason GE remains an 11.00 stock in a 12 year bull market.... it simply has no buying power. It’s nothing more than a computer driven day trade
The short squeeze should be at GE not GME.
Could we see 12 today?
Bought more GE today.Added to my position in GPK!
Selling out. Im sure thats what china wants. time to dump it - Lets see thief in chief sells out to china profits collapse. and engines are made cheaper over sees. Great job Dems. I forgot to mention the layoffs. Also now its free $$ for ileagls. But if your a hard working usa american than forget it. WOW
Hold or Sell to buy another stock that does move??
"Anyone saying anything other than tomorrow is a Green Day MOST likely. Well those people legit don’t understand charting, or level 2 this will most likely be above 13 at one point tomorrow"
I BELIEVE SUSPECT MUTUAL FUNDS DO NOT LIKE REVERSE SPLIT ... THEY GOING TO SELL I THINK
Gotta get this volume north of 100 mil - actually 150 mil - 50 mil ain't gonna cut it. Wait for HUGE news - it's coming.
NOT GOOD
Covid infections dropping quickly due to Americans finally wearing masks. It took a long time to get Americans to wear masks and took covid 19 seriously. Probably helped by a few dead Republican politicians.
I must agree with the bears today something definitely wrong
"Huge momentum coming from small retail buyers... Big boys Big money are still assessing but ready to make some moves...I am thinking old school investors are stepping back in pushing $15 in March.. it's coming !!GE longs can relax, good times are just starting !!"
I know where I'm going with my dividend money BONNIE LEE'S FRYED CHICKEN
I AGREE G E on the way up have sell order in @ 15. but will sell @ 14 .
Larry is taking this thing back to the Dow people
Jump on the next GME. GE
Let's join hands and celebrate the $12 achievement.
"meh. last year 8n march when it went red everyone was saying in wish I bought it in march. well this is it. time to load up on all the the stocks. mines in nvax, $nio and $ge. let's get it. when people are scared buy."
covered 1/5 GE short +$1.79
moving up on low volume?
shaking out the stoplosses
Tusa just informed me the new target is $8.02. Does that make some happy?
Guys these are not FOOLs to just wkeup nand announce they would like to Reverse Split. Its well thought and planned out ... They will definitely not let anything go wrong with the company footed so strong after the 20008 turmoil and Pandemic .I am guessing they want the give Company and prestigious status and to be High Flier which you small guys will not be able to catch.
"The Fed finishing up their meetings regarding interest rates tomorrow, along with lots of key economic indicating numbers regarding employment, GDP, CPI, Housing and many more, sets the market up for a potentially very volatile day. Also, with Powell speaking live on Thursday with all eyes and ears fixed on his every word, I plan on sitting on the sidelines with as little exposure as possible.Good luck, invest wisely."
way to go thanks alot
"I was long on GE, but took profits. This move will exclude most of retail. After all, it is easier to take a stock from $13 to $26 than it is to take it from $113 to $226. I think this may slide some more tomorrow. The entire market is too high and we have an incompetent administration that yesterday held a press conference to tout maternity suits for fighter pilots. I don't know about you, but I do not trust an administration that wants to send pregnant women into combat."
Weak hands need to relax. Try holding the stock for more than a days or weeks? Company fundamentals has not changed.
You think institutions didn't know this was coming as they...again...pumped those upgrades to you? Nothing has changed.
Masks are more important than shorts these days. Wear them properly now.
"I bought 300 contacts, 11 dollars call for $5300 and sold 100 contacts for 6000.00. Still holding 200 contacts and hoping for $12.00 tomorrow or day after."

"Ge sits on billions in cash, makes a deal for Billions, yet,... Offers a 1 share for 8 reverse split to its investors. No buyback witch could have easily been done and would have increased shareholder value. No increase of dividend, witch would have given the investors who bailed them out a small positive compensation for their efforts. GE is sinking and they DESERVE it. $5.00 range coming soon!!"
GE to the moon!
GE is on the road to recovery.
GE is a junk stock stay away.
"Just based on the mean price alone on the five year chart this stock should be trading at between the $25 to $30 dollar range; with ample volume this stock can get to those price levels. To many folks out there looking for the next jumping on board the next ""Pump and Dump"" and loosing there shirts. $GE stock has strong technicals and financials without extreme price pull backs. It's a smart stock pick."

I’ve never seen a reverse split make a good looking baby. GE is on the path of joining the ranks of former powerhouse Westinghouse. Sad.
"they go south so short make some cash and they go up so the long will make some cash and at the end the long make more, I do not see why GE can not be 15 to 17 down the LONG, long mean few more inches, take time."
"Now we're talking . ,ok, the 11 dollar threshold has been surpassed. Now the rest of 2021 gets interesting.Hold longs. Don't listen to any shorty. They want you to believe this stock is going to tank.It is not going to tank. It's going to $20.00 or higher. Good luck all."
NO STOP SIGN!
"Who,in their right mind,would buy GE at over $100 after the sick idea of a reserve split 1 for 8.Culp is no better than Immelt.Keep selling off assets and screw retail shareholders ."
Hey Boys! Just got notification that 10 directors acquired around 4-8K shares a at 12/31 close @ 10.87 a pop!
"Fellow share holders currently GE has 84,250,000 million shares short VS 75,750,000 million short, lets dangle the worm for awhile before we put the squeeze on,CULP will be making announcements along the way,winning the lawsuit friday after hours a big deal, 50 years on wall street tells me we've hooked a big one"
Bottom today
Looting process.
I bought another 1000 at 12.70 to add to my long calls jan 21 strike 17. Confidence in this old boy.:)
"Wow, reached $13.61. GE is strong!"
we will be going higher i can see $13 today
this will really pop on earnings!
"I am long GE and will continue to add at between 10 and 10.5. I new the market would shoot up before friday. It is surpricing that the thing that motivate me here is that at the end and biginnig of the month money comes into the market. But I could really use another sell off before the close and maybe buying in agai at the close on Friday. why! take a look at GE how is tolling back the last 30 minutes, and the adv- declines are extended or ST overbought. No something will ither top at about 11:00 to to 12:45 and dive into the close all the way to Friday to see a rally about the close tomorrow and up until the first few day of traiding on Feb! This is my opinion, and is base on all this swinging and experiencing as of late the vix, adv-decline. out of the 500 sp and 100 nasdaq there are about 500 stock moving higher, it usually sell of after a few hours."
"5-for-1 reverse split might have looked far better than its massive 8-for-1 deal. (The latter signals that GE has all but given up on growth). The firm has also lagged in pushing wind power to replace its declining coal and gas turbine business. The AerCap deal brings in cash, but not much else.To succeed, Culp will need far more than smart asset sales – he needs a plan on growing the businesses he has left."
people working 9-5 are just getting home & checking their brokerage & finding out about this snafu!
"After reading GE ,CEO conference call, I predict $20 a share years end for GE"
GE RSI: 66.67
post the margins for engine sales and renewable sales please.
GE will soar when oil services is sold. Seems the price per barrel will make it happen. Buy.
"GE will benefit greatly from the worldwide move to renewable energy. The company will supply 190 Haliade-X 13 MW turbines for Dogger Bank A and Dogger Bank B, the first two phases of what will be the world’s largestoffshore wind farm located in the North Sea. These things are monstrous! The blade diameter is over 600 feet and a single one is capable of generating 288 megawatts in a single day. With the new administration high on renewables, GE will have a good run over the next four years."
"We end another week and no word from Flannery or Miller. We are now at 2 months without a word. GE ""leadership"" does zero in communicating with investors. No reason to suggest the stock is a good value. Of course no buyers. There are some good things happening at GE but not being communicated by the company. Immelt used this management approach and Flannery has continued the practice. Apparently Crotonville doesn't have a course that teaches if your head hurts when you hit it a hammer, stop hitting it with a hammer."
Look at the volume. That's a beauty.GE momentum is tough to push against...
Volume on lower price yesterday was 1/2 the normal volume; volume on the steep drop this morning was hardly much...again trending towards a 1/2 volume maybe 60% avg volume day
"The long weekend and political uncertainty is over, now the money is pouring back into market. Enjoy the ride to $30."
route only getting started. GE just seems to always slow itself down and get in the way. this will give back all gains after reaching a high only two days ago at $13.32. Every time momentum gets busted probably going to ground all GE90 engines. also gota ask yourself the timing of an ex CEO what the heck is that about? Like I said GE is the biggest obstacle in its own way...
"Before flooding this message board, flood the ge investor relation email with complaints re:the RS!!!Let's get Culp announce a ""Oopsie I was misunderstood. The way GE is moving, the RS is not needed. We will reach $45 price per share next year. Why a reverse split? Moronic"".Stay greedy my friends"
"Whoever the ""Pezzo Novanta"" that proposed this Reverse Split needs to be jettisoned. He or she has a serious thinking disorder. Proposing something like this is a sign as to how far removed from reality these stuffed shirts really are!"
Is GE getting into batteries for EV? Or trying to buy an existing company like PLUG or FCEL? Anyone with info please share.
"Holding up pretty well... GE turnaround is around the corner :),,,"
"Stop looking back. Look forward. Culp came from Danaher. Pull a chart on Danaher. Culp re-negotiated his contract with GE last Summer to make it much more SharePrice heavy. He knows GE is headed to $24. With a V shaped recovery and massive infrastructure spending, GE is going to do extremely well over the next 2 years."
Reverse Split = F'd again. Thx Jack Welch Thx Jeff Imelt Thx Board of Directors 
GE engines may replace pw ones.. as GE engine has record of great performance
Pre market is green. I hope the day will also close to green.
Pump team needs new pom poms. Next Nasir will come out with some real wisdom.
There is know reason to watch or write comments about GE until the last 3 weeks of any given quarter. It’s like a swirling rapid going know where until the final 15 days of a quarter go back and fact check it
"Heads up folks, call options in the next two weeks and earnings call will push stock price past $13 dollars. Ge fundamentals and technicals are great, very well undervalued company, positioning itself strong midterm to long term. Good luck longs."
New 52 week high... cant go against the trend...the trend is you friend!
larry would never cut his hair today.. his 3 year CEO work contract is coming up..have faith.
"GE stock breaks through $11.50 this week,followed by a CULP announcement"
"ge - it comes down to performance and prospectsi left ge for 1 year when i saw neither, what i did see a deterioration of management and co. performance now most importantly i follow culp, his business acumen, and sometimes share what i see.coming back for me paid off, so did my interpretation of stock behavior"
"Well it?s Saturday afternoon and let?s just recap this past weeks events. GE reported really strong numbers considering the current state of affairs. And just like I said, there would be a pop and then the HAMMER. Well wouldn?t you know how right I was. There were those that were HOPING that it was clear sailing to 18+. There were those saying only IF the Reddit people would short squeeze GE. But at the end of the week the pps shows no signs of life. Ask yourself what?s going to drive the stock price up over the next two months before the next earnings call? COVId vaccine you say? Well here?s something for you.....that?s already baked in. On the contrary any delay in vaccinations will only hurt this stock more. Oh the 747Max is now allowed to fly again! Cheers you say? GE is bound to go up now! Right?! Let me ask. How many orders does Boeing have? I?ll wait for that answer. But the new administration! The Green New Deal! Yes yes yes that?s the ticket you say! All the off shore windmills oh yes that?s going to drive GE to new heights! Let?s just see how fast ANY of that gets done. If there?s one thing Democrats and Republicans can agree on is that the Federal government is as quick to change as the Private sector.....NOT! Now don?t get me wrong, GE isn?t going to file for BK protection nor is it going to $4 like #$%$ says. But we?re sitting pretty high in the market right now and the policy changes being implemented are going to have a ripple effect theough the economy. Wait till this time next year when it?s $4 for a gallon of gas. How many people will be flying then? In short it?s a pull back to 8-9 range and then another run to $13-15 in November. Anyway, back to my Saturday afternoon!"
Any chance this goes green today?
"Tradings after the reverse split will be much less from the small retail investors, the big guys can then set their moods on the price they want to come in much easier...Good or bad for GE price-wise in one to two years out, you yourself be the judge... Think hard why BOD wants to do it..."
"Do not trust someone who has been banned!!! He says retired but the settlement with the SEC tells otherwise, read it!!!!"
I'm thinking about 50 million volume in the 1st hour!

Happy to hear the CEO gave up his salary last year. Very Brave!
heavy option buying this am.
Anonymous muted
my bet: 20$ by the end of 2021
I’ll buy the drop on Monday
Just got in at $11.00 see what happens tomorrow hopefully
Any predictions for the 26th post call?I think Culp has some momentum and will beat again...which should bring volume and a fairly decent sized jump upwards. I would think a beat would push it close to 13
looks like GE is growing despite what the Dow does
"I don't own this stock like I said. But I have before and would seriously research before dumping now. That division they are getting rid of seems to be pain to manage. Good idea to slim down and get cash out of that paperwork, managerial monster. I will be buying in at best point."
What will happen to GE price if and when it is removed from the Dow and certain fund managers are required to sell it from their funds?
"Wth, that reverse stock split makes no sense."
Might GE experience a short squeeze like GME? What could trigger such a thing?
"If GE chooses to help resolve a national crisis how about assistance for the unspoken disabled military veterans who are homeless or living in homes that do not support their special needs. Let's see, we have plenty of money for Hector from Guatemala at the expense of G. I. Joe."
Here comes the demand !
If market holds up over the weekend.....gap up Monday!!!

2 Pratt & Whitney engine failures over the weekend. Could help GE get more market share.
Must read NY Times article on GE disrupting the Offshore Wind industry
Tusa was just praising GE in Feb on 4.4B of FCF in Q4 beating expectations of 2.5B. He's hated GE for years and continues to as the businesses of GE are improving.
GE to $20 ... !!!
 best people and culture on earth!!! We run the world.
"21.00!!!!!!! Target WOOOOOT WOOOOOT!!!! Is that 15.00 peeking around the corner!Mittermaier raised his price target to $15 from $14, while reiterating the buy rating he’s had on the stock since December 2019. The new target would make Mittermaier the second-most bullish on GE of the 21 analysts surveyed by FactSet, behind just Global Equities Research’s $21 target."
WooHoo $15 $16 $17 by tomorrow!!! Not! Hoping and praying. Hope and Pray!
longs about to be schooled on how technicals work this thing is going down
buy buy buy buy
of shorting this a few months ago
Oh as I read through all these posts on thing is consistent words like HOPE and IF and MAYBE. If you are using these words you have no reason to be investing. Hoping that this gets traded like GME? Really?! What most don’t realize or acknowledge is that this stock is not moving until aviation comes back. I am soooo tired of saying the same thing. It’s all about the airline engines. Nothing more. Once air travel comes back the stock will move up. It’s really that simple.
Just when we thought we had a right stock when mkt was down last few sessions Ge out performing but just in one day giving it all back
26B look at the positive side
"Sorry Yahoo. I should have read the guidelines and I would have known that posting a link to an article is not permitted. My comment is still relevant. I became bullish on GE yesterday for two reasons: the NYT article on $GE development of A Monster Wind Turbine, and second, the reawakening of $BA that should help $GE."
GE is bidding on contract for engines on B52 bomber. 75 planes with 8 engines each.keep your fingers crossed.
"Now that Larry Culp has saved GE, sell Baker Hughes use the proceeds to buy back GE shares. $4B can alot GE."
hello GE freinds. i remember the GE bears on this post laughing at me in October when GE was around 5$ and i was telling them it will double!!! hahahah look where it is today.. GE is gold!!
why is GE going down as the market goes up????
Shorts will try to scare you but don’t be.
I sure wouldn't want to be stuck in large cap stocks when the liquidity freeze finally rears its head because the day is coming when no matter what the Fed does liquidity will stay frozen.
Be real guys. GE share price will not skyrocket soon. It will at most thread water until the vote which will be yes. Then most likely drop towards Tusa's $5 until the split happens. Then fund managers will short and drop further to $50 range which Tusa's price target.
Pump and dump before closing bell...that's all it is.
I use etrade no charge on stock. now options I do not know?
"Respectfully, with the rising 10 year bond yield and possible inflation...In this climate, GE showed today it is safe harbor."
"All else being equal, maintaining the same dividend level would mean 8 cents a share after the proposed reverse split.""Although the board reserves the right to change the company's dividend policy in the future, we currently anticipate that the per share dividend paid will be proportionately adjusted,"" a GE spokeswoman said in a statement.................uh huh"
Reverse stock splits are equity killers
GE should sell it's stake in BKR and focus on renewable.
guess buy once it is down 8%?
$15 by year end
Riddle me this Batman...why is the $17 Leap giving a 38% upside including the premium received to GE’s current share price? I mean it will be available this morning at the open?
"the year of the CULP, $15 soon, and Tusa finding his brain"
WHEN will GE pay their dividend ??? still 1 cent???
GREEN PRE MARKET. SOMEBODY KNOWS SOMETHING!
Don't Worry...Be Happy !!!
"Bought 3,000 shares at 6.04. Thank you analyst for push this gold mine down so I could buy so cheap. I see $16 coming by July. Just as soon as 2 more of my holdings gets everyone vaccinated (PFE and MRNA).Hope VXRT will get their pill form vaccine out there by April also. TSLA is a dog. Bought F at 4.40 and riding it back to $20. No way TSLA who would not make a profit without the Govt. handout EV credits is worth more than GM, TM, GE, F, VW, HMC, and NSANY combined. Bubble on TSLA about to pop."
Some people are buying this if current holders are dumping! Volume is going to be a lot more than yday
"Now Tusa beats down GE when analyzing MMM....this guy has a love affair with GE Zand as much as he pushes GE down, I'm surprised there hasn't been any investigation into his comments regarding GE. Despite being wrong on almost every level. He was right on the stock one time, and he just cannot let go"
I was hoping it would get back above 12
At the end of the day / Ge is going to perform the same - however investment managers just got their transaction charges reduced to 1/8th of current !!
Shorts are like deer  in headlights
"Retest 11.62, then 12.20 then 13.24. Possible new uptrend beginning @ 11.40. I think we see 13.00 - 14.00 over the next few weeks. LC has pulled this Rig from going into the ditch to back on the road and the BILLION dollar deals to support it World Wide. Would not be shocked to see LC pull a rabbit out of his hat and surprise everyone."
It’s now a “contrarian” stock. Bet on it to go up when the market goes down.
Next earnings report starts the FOMO move - downside is virtually nil!
"It is hard to understand the rationale for the reverse split, especially since the company is doing so well. I suspect there is more to the story."
"Thanks to GE, I now have a short term capital gain problem. Thanks GE! "
GE’s engines don’t explode. That’s a very good thing. GE can supply Boeing with engines the flying public will feel better about.
.13 away from the 52 week highI would love to see GE move through 13.50 this week and see the volume go back to the 110-120 million per day
Nice close
GE deserves to be a $5.00!!!
Next they will increase the dividend to 4c or pre split 1/2c. You will be grateful as you are fooled again. The same GE no matter who is running it............into the ground
Buy. They're not reversing on a down note. Senor mkt. on the wrong side.
"all you people talking up a short squeeze on GE need to understand the GME/AMC game and do some simple DD (avail right here on yahoo). GE has only about 1% of the float short - unlike AMC's 30+% and GME way over subscribed 260% both on very low floats. GE has 8Bn+ in the float and can cover in about a day's volume. Sure, millions of redditers can line up to buy GE but the last impact on a short squeeze would be minor. GE is a long play. Culp is doing amazing. Do some DD."
This deal is a great thing. Get in before it hits 14!
"Wow, Crazy Sale, back the trucks up!"
6 month chart is a work of art.
I feel lucky today. I'm thinking we breach 14. Aint that something?
Why all the negative reaction to the reverse split. GE is getting stronger financially so it obviously has nothing to do with that. Naive investors will sell to longs advantage!
"Jack Welch came to me and a dream last night, and he told me to buy "
GE in a steady but sure upward trend!
one reason is decreased dividend.. it will not be 8 c/q but 5c
"This closes below $13.00 today, below $12.00 Tomorrow. Worst investors day ever!"
Reverse split is a bad sign for GE.
"GE is a joke, instead of focus on boost the earning, it focuses on psychologically boost per share stock prices"
"GE is not even up 100% from March Virus lows, 2008 Crash lows. EVERYTHING, EVEN ALL G@RBAGES ARE UP 200%--500% to even 1000%.. Just remember the $5.48 lows was after virus March low $6.66, which was also 2008 lows $6.66.. Just reminding you guys. Thanks to JPM, Toosa for the opportunity to buy GE.. I have to open JPM account at some point for this opportunity and show my gratitude.."
"Manipulation is so obvious. Any normal ""real"" stock that is established and generates revenue (unlike a quarter of the speculative #$%$ being trading today), upon good news like this, would be up at least 3% to 5%, or maybe more. No problem, the longer it stays down now, the more it will go up later."
"GE provides power solutions to over 1/3 of the world's power grid. EV's are on fire! Tesla, Nio, GM, Ford, and many more electric vehicles all need to charge up. Who do you think benefits from the electrical grid buildout? GE!"
Just a temporary dip. Money is going out of stocks into the big money lotteries. GE investors particularly understand this maneuver!
Everyone vote NO on reverse split
"I suppose retail with losses has two options: one is sell a Leap now if you believe. Second is sell if you don’t believe in GE anymore. Perhaps the unspoken reason for RS by Culp was, we expect GE to be doing better by most metrics, and the 8+ billion shares will prevent our share price from adequately moving upward in response to those improved metrics. They have to get Institutions on board to pass the RS. How are they going to do that?Why is it that I can sell a $17 Leap for a $1.05 or so? So, let’s say the RS goes through (they have to bank on the institutions voting yes), the price at $13 will be $104; and at $14 would be $112. The $17 Leap if achieved is $136. So, I’m getting $8.40 on the leap. The real question here is do you think GE will be North of $18 on a pre-split basis.The other option is sell, take the tax loss and find a better equity."
Is that all you've got?
I don't do reverse splits. That's why I sold my shares after hours. I suggest you learn as much as you can and decide if you want to ride that wave or not. I will respect whatever you do...!
what time are earnings out?
"opinions dont matterwhat was culp able to accomplish, whats his outlookcrucial for ge pricing moving forward"
Oh boy going to $4. Get ready.
"@what-the-faith You insist the GE share price will drop to $4, and you mentioned in an earlier post this is based on your analysis of material issued by Steven Tusa and Markopolis(sp?). They have not been able to cause this to happen. Only Jack Welch PHD (bless his soul) got the price at $4 early in his CEO tenure. I'm a buyer at 4$, but when is that coming again?"
"Heads up folks, Something to notice, analysts at zacks updated to a strong buy of GE stock, after a long hold rating."
Sell puts against your position.
yahoo average target raised again 11.50 now.continuing to move in the right direction
What are the chances GE buys Bloom Energy?
RS designed to shake out retail investors... guess what? it's working.. it'll drop to $11 or $10 and change on lower and lower volume........ no more climb to $20.. no more momentum...thanks a lot GE... Retail investors took the chance and risk on your stock when in was $6.... typical...

GE BAGGIES dropping like flies
I think GE wont raise dividends until rs.That way they dont have payout as much.what do you think?
Analysts say GE stock a top long pick for 2021!! Covid recovery play. Are they right?
Renewable source of energy is the next big thing..GE is well positioned in that msrket.
Over 200m served down 5+%
Please stop whining on rs. It just a proposal to test the market responses and bring down the price. I think they they want to buy back the shares at a cheaper price
Six months ago GE was a little over $6. Those looking to buy the dip are to late. Growth should be steady though.
R/S are never good for existing shareholders ; only done for companies with debt issues that need cash.. GL and get out..
Not interested in GE because I am not interested in a RS.
Well they got the price back down maybe they should buy back shares now
Just hold tight and buy any dips. Culp is doing a great job and this time next year he will have the dividend reinstated and this will really take off. Wouldn’t be surprised to see $20 in a year
GE should be well over a 100.00 stock in this bull market.. but it’s not and it never will be... there is a reason why it’s 11.00
"Good morning, Clowns, especially jj. Did you wake up screaming a few times last night?"
GE is my favorite
What happens to your options when they split?
anyone have a good discord
"Free cash flow by the end of this year is $3.5-$4.5 BILLION. Culp, would you please have my children?"
All these half baked companies up over 200% in last weeks tells you something big is going to happen in the market.. and it won’t be good
$30 and higher this year
Bid being held up as someone big exits this.
Never should have cut the Dividend...Was a huge mistake!!!
Anyone notice GE debt is now less than ---LLY. LLY DEBT OVER 350 per cent.
You got to be a very stable Genius to take a 600 billion dollar company and turn it into a 100 billion dollar company. Hard to believe they let Immelt keep all that money they paid him.
Two companies worth investing in GE and NOK. They are both turn around stories and have a bright future! Back companies that are worth and desire to be backed!!!

"Welcome all newcomers to my page. As one who bought heavily at $6.23, I can say legitimately welcome. The issue was that no one foresaw GE’s component co.s turning around. Algos steppes in and rubbed it in our faces hence the drop to $6.23 where I bought. It’s not fully cooked. I see $30 over the next 6-12 months. Algos will take us their at the end."
Come on GE get the gas turbines to Texas NOW!
"Debt reduction, Revenue, Profit................SP up. The numbers will tell the story for sure. I don't see much risk here.....just need a little more patience/time."
GE 11.5C 1/29 has massive volume & a huge whale just came through. Check the volume. Earnings beat coming?

Smart to trade this and buy some put options? What y’all think?
Guaranteed that the only positive reactions regarding a 1 for 8 reverse spit on this board today are being made by planted frauds. Research companies that have done them and see for yourself.. This is a stock price killer!Reverse splits are for bankrupt companies!
GE big play will be wind turbines....
My gains are slowly creeping up .... lmao

"@Terrence my outmost respect goes to you. Because of your beautifully put posts, I will never respond or let @Nasir - low life - posts bother me. As far as $4 or $20 for GE, only time will tell. I am betting much lower if GE is to survive. Since it never made money during the best market ever, how can they make money in a bad economy. Regards."
THANK YOU LORD I SHORTED AGAIN AT $12.52
ge for me at this price without news a hold.better opportunities out there if you follow the market for trading / investing
"Reverse split? Are you kidding me? They announce a reverse split AND slightly lower than expected guidance at the same time? It as if they’re purposely manufacturing a selloff. ￼Reverse split rarely lead to positive movement and SP. Just when I thought GE was going to move strong into positive territory, They pull this stunt. ￼I’m out.￼"

"GE Board wants to limit the number of ppl that have 100 or more round lot shares that can be borrowed against in brokerage houses for shorters. I'm assuming this was their intention and thinking a $30B sale would absorb any optics problems of a 1:8 reverse split.

Meanwhile UBS raises price target from $12.00 to $14.00
GE just announced it will supply 137 Cypress land based turbines in Sweden. A huge 753 MW. Will be largest land based wind farm in Europe. 753 MW is about as much power that is generated by a nuclear reactor.
Unscientific poll: Will GE be above $18  or below $18  on December 31st 2021? Thanks for playing!
Can it also go higher as shares at this price are accumulated to increase numbers before the RS?
"GE trading nearly $4 over it's 200 sma. As mentioned, MONTHLY rsi = 87. Upgrades sold into. You got the picture yet?"
Reasonable price prediction for the week ahead?
"In feb Tusa cut his price target to 14.00 see quote https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/02/12/jp-morgan-cuts-general-electric-price-target-to-14.html................. So now after the company is in MUCH better shape the price target is lower? C'mon. Oil higher , cost cutting almost at 20 BL. pension better with rate increases. Just say'n."
"I am new , can someone tell me how GE went from billions in free cash flow last earnings and more projected to come and now projecting negative cash flow for next quarter?"
This will be in the news. More investors coming in.
RUN SHORTS RUN!!!!
After RS seems price will hit 125 and year end 220
The indicators will need to be reset before going lower. Should get a decent bounce here but it is only an opp to short or get out of your long
GE is going up slowly but surely. So I decided to stop this stock from going higher.I bought 500 shares. This way when I have the stock. It won t go higher anymore
Double-down.
thank goodness I got out yesterday. wait until after split happens. every stock I have ever bought re; stock split went to zero. or very near it!

"If you can't see how blatant this intraday manipulation is by institutions (upgrades, massive deals, improving balance sheet... and short pressure every day) I feel sorry for you.. sure there may be better plays out there, and GE is a dog with such a huge float, but there is no way the US admin achieves their climate goals without GE. I'm expecting $12 after earnings in late January."

Ge is dead. Market will crash GE go back to $5.00 again. May be $3.00 a share.
Shareholder accounting lawsuit against GE was dismissed. This could be bullish news.
DO NOT VOTE for the reverse split!You have the right to object this reverse split stupid idea by the CEO.
"I should have known , was so close to exit GE at 14.78 my cost less dividend , covered call income . Who knows now 3k shares . And my call income will decrease with this split. Barrons just ran a negative article but I do not have full access . Not sure why when things were finally turning that this idea pops up ."
Keep this in mind . GE at $40 to $50 is a very possibility price target in the next few years. If GE is considered the answer for a green environment stock then $50 is within reach not imaginary anymore.
"GE is ready for a break out. Might not be soon, but look promising!!"
"i would not consider ge included herehowever for many stocks, Warren Buffett's favorite indicator hints that stocks are significantly overvaluedtaking profits again"
"Who Is ACTUALLY Running The U.S. Of A.?? Rumor Is B.H.O.???? I Think The Two Stents Joe Has In His Head Are Effecting Is Ability To Think, Walk, Remember And Talk... So Sad. B.H.O. Is In His Third Term Now??"
"As a valuation investor, I feel I am a fool when I see so many stocks (such as MVIS,TLRY,GME,AMC,...) are up 10 to 100% everyday. These high flyers without much revenue and earnings,but the stock valuation of them are extremely high. No wonder when I told my friend about GE. Nobody pays any attention since they could have better return with buying any stocks. What type of crazy market we have now? GE keeps trading between $10.5 to $11.8 range. When will GE breakout? March?"
218 million shares traded...what the heck is going on?
If you follow Tusa price you would fail miserably in the past months. Remember He is making money out of YOU.
"Wow, reverse stock split... That's a good sign. LOL"
thoughts on this 1 for 8 reverse split idea GE leadership is floating in the news?
"I just found out something very interesting. I am a GE long, and own GE stock individually and in my managed brokerage account. I just checked my brokerage account this morning, and shares of GE are no longer in my account. It seems that the person who manages my account, unloaded GE yesterday. My sons account through another firm, did the same, but on Monday. I am wondering If this 1 for 8 reverse split news was leaked early to Wall Street, but retail investors. like me did not receive this information until yesterday. Seems like some big boys got the news early, and bailed out prior to the news."
"Clamor to get into GE a brew pre-market. Not getting my shares, no way Jose."
Their go’s a nice run up. What is ge going to save 4 cent a share on div after revers split. I do not get it
"GE NOT EVEN UP 100% from March Lows, 2008 Lows, but every Aviation BA, SPR, DAL, Travel, even brick mortar, total shutdown businesses are up 200% -- 500%..Yet GE still barely above 2008 lows, March Lows.. GE was already SEVERELY UNDERVALUED at $13 below $20, down from $30, did not take part in the longest running Bull-Market.. GE sitting on MOUNTAIN OF CASH AND LIQUIDITY $$100 BILLION in the USA and abroad..*GE is an EV Story, GE Aviation growth Story, GE Renewable is a growth story, GE Healthcare is a growth and life saving story..Even FORD UP 200%"
It's mindboggling to see Tesla increase in market capitalization by $100 billion today!!
Investor day is a joke the news is already out what they are going to announce -- late comers tomorrow are going to jump in on the news-- smart money will sell right in to it
I can imagine if CEO gets millions so will the Board of Directors. They are in it together.
Bully GE!
GE is rising high above the clouds; absolutely stunning!!
You can vote on the RS in May.
so when is the best time to jump in? After the reverse.
If u panic don’t buy..
My company doesn’t celebrate Easter but it does MLK... This actually used to be a great country..

GE at best has never been much more than a 30.00 stock.. and you actually think investors will pay 105.00? The short sellers will absolutely destroy this.
What else can GE do for us???
Resistance!!!
You bet your sweet bippy!
"This is so sad, GE reports almost 5 Billion free cash flow, with Billions in revenue , and it fights to get above 12 dollars, and companies like Blink 60 bucks a share, plug and power 72 a share and pot stocks with no profit all 20 to 60 a share. go figure, Maybe GE should buy some shares back or raise the dividend, this is crazy....."
I reiterate $GE to $24 plus this year alone! I told you about the breakout that was coming and that was more than enough time for the shorts to cover their positions.
Reverse stock split.... GE heading down to $6.....
So negative cash flow for 2021 Q1 and the stock moves up today?Let's have more news like this!
"Has anyone heard from Tusa? more orders are coming .. UAE and Saudi just added more planes, Qatar Airline is next.. The biggest order is coming from China, some needs to help Tusa do THE MATH and count the money. GE-Boeing partnership is stronger than ever !!! wait for more good news ... I am the first to upgrade GE to Strong Buy with Target price of $20, GE will hit it before December. Go long Or Be Wrong !!!"
"Have my suspicions, tomorrow is a insider buy for sure"
Next level of support is at $11.81 if that breaks then door to hell opens.

He trimmed stakes in Wells Fargo and Apple, and exited positions in JPMorgan and PNC Financial.I don't see GE on that list anywhere. Do you? Pumpers?"
"just a quick comparison, ge share value 1 month ago same as today, as is dow value, .today same as one month ago.assuming ge 12 months target is 14 $, is that enough to hold a stock 1 year. i said it before, i use trading to up my returns"

One and only GE.. If NFLX was valued at $200 BLLION Mkt with $12 Bn revenue, giant compitition in streaming AAPL, GOOG YOUTUBE, DISNEY, COMCAST, HULU, FOX, Countless others, then, GE CROWN-JEWEL surely worth $2 TRILLION Mkt cap.."

"Dow up 300, GE down 29 cents. Another great day for shorts. Once again BAGGIES left holding the bag."
Fundamental picture only brightening. R/S is a ruse to steal your shares. Resist and buy more. Going much higher. Tusa bound to lose his job over his resistance.
I am new to the market. What price would you all recommend I purchase at?
Shorts you better check yourselves......quickly!!

"SHOOTER16 hours agoI have owned GE many times over the past 4 decades and for the majority time done including this last disposal upon the notice of a reverse stock split. I have NEVER seen anything good come from a reverse stock split NEVER!!!! I hope I am because I am planning on re entering GE at a lower price, MAYBE!!!!I think this latest sale for/of leasing operation is a good move and think a few more have to go as well.I held GE back in Jack Welch days, excellent CEO!!!But those days are gone and if anyone can bring GE back it is Larry Culp, yet I don't like a reverse stock split of this magnitude. Maybe a 1 for 2 but not much more than that. JMHO from experience.LessReply62MarkMark16 hours agoMany longs have bought to average down price. to get a bigger multiplayer as shares rose. so a reverse split does kill the time it takes to recover. your losses from higher purchases. stock will recover much slower at 90 to 100 share price. Let's face it they are poor competitors and operators. recent gains had more to do with a low share price compared to market. rs is is bad and should be a much lower rd like a 1 for 5. that would reduce 4 billion shares and I would of not sold my 1k shares."

we trust culp up tomorrow over a buck in my opinion
"Air travel will boom early July, once majority of Americans can get vaccinated. GE Aviation will then will drive earnings to 45 to 60 cents 3rd quarter and generate $8-10bln industrial FCF. We're probably headed near 20 coming this July."
"Totally agree with you bandit, I’m an airline pilot and long on GE! $20 end of 2021!"
"Anybody know what the share price needs to be for Mr Culps huge, and well deserved payday??"
"Fewer shares keeps short away. those who are nervous sell now. All these negative comments and GE Is down 20 cents, no seller and shorts are in hiding."
"great conf call - upbeat but realistic. Order and Margin improvements already materializing.2021 should be a great year for GE with 2H21 ramping up as Aviation comes back online. Culp stated they are already getting airlines to queue up for engine maintenance in advance of the return to the air, so service revenue will improve dramatically as capacity to service is fixed."
"I said yesterday it would be in the low 12's, now it looks like it will head south of that. So the news wiped out billions. Nice job Culp. I am long ang will buy more below 12. GLTA"
ge already has the largest offshore wind turbine operating near nordic country. A single blade is longer than a football field. This thing is a monster!
..when the Reverse Split again??...
"I'm holding for the long haul because GE is transforming into a lean powerhouse that's set to benefit immensely from the reopening of the economy. The r/s was an incredibly unnecessary announcement. Culp just opened the floodgates for all the haters and shorts that he had previously silenced. Regardless, this r/s hysteria will die down by next week. This stock is set to hit $20 this year, because it is built on fundamentals and a ever-improving balance sheet. finally, dont believe any of the clowns that say Culp's bonus share-price target wont also be altered by a reverse split. If he receives a bonus at achieving $25/share and we do the 1-to-8 split, then his new bonus target is $200/share. Do not listen to these clowns on this board. They've been getting their teeth kicked in the last 4 months. Unfortunately Culp did this garbage to wake them back up"
bought 600 shares more yesterday and nervous.
day traders are sensing they are trapped that buy at 13 isn't working --when they bail the water fall decline starts
This is a short candidate
"Shorts now getting burned. Tusa has lost his credibility. GE finally in the teens, could we see 20s within a year."
"More brownouts, blackouts, and Pratt & Whitney jet engine burn-ups please! Buy."
With democrats at the helm we are heading for a liquidity crisis and stagflation. Luckily during the Great Depression microcap stocks outperformed because they don't need much liquidity.
"When Culp goes out to dinner with other CEOs they are bragging how their stock price is in the 100s while GE is/was $14.00. Culp said to himself, I need to get GE's stock price up fast."
"About to breakout here, should push nicely past $15 in near term. Air travel about to explode, covid dying off fast now."
At least they are savings 10's of millions of dollars every month on the pension funds that almost killed the company. Due to the age of the covid deaths that do not have to receice a pension anymore (that was underfunded). Big relief for GE.................................
"incredible, the market maker move predicted .29 cent move today. GE did just that. Yet we got good news going foward, I take the 2.73% any day."
"...........when ""they"" MM's let this thing blow up (just a little).......it will be a fun day."
"Sell Covered or Naked Call Options every week for strike price 0.5 - 1.00 above the Monday's opening price ...Milk the system, the MMs are doing this every week .."
"Bad news for Pratt, good news for GE. I expected .50 up for GE today"
it for a market correction which should get around 15% correction fairly soon .
15 today
The problem with reverse splits is that they most always result in a decline in share price over time unless the company does really well post split. That ain't GE. Psychologically much easier to short a $90 stock than a $13 stock. Maybe GE is worried about being Gamestopped at the current share price. I'm out.
10 tomorrow.
"if you are newbies, please check how an army of law firms were suing $GE for misleading investors (it happened 2-3 years ago). Look where GE is today and will be tomorrow. If you are convinced of $UAVS technology and its future, then this is the best time to get in or lower your average cost. $NIO went from ~$10 to $1.19 within few months when bad news were circulated and recirculated. I spent months reading on $nio and got on board at $1.6 back on Oct 2019, when everybody was crying bankruptcy. Hope $uavs will be another million maker like $nio. These treasury bond triggered panic selling was a simple shake moving money from small to big pockets. More such events may occur...only the patient ones who can read will be rewarded in full."

"GE was supposed to sell healthcare off and give ALL of the proceeds to shareholders. Culp killed it. Ge's WAB deal was halved to shareholders by Culp. Culp cut the dividend from 12c to 1c. BKR was purchased at the top of the oil market and then they sold a portion at the bottom by Culp. Guess how much Culp gave shareholders. Culp is getting big bonuses for hitting price targets near term. Guess what the RS does for him? You know, King Larry? EPS projections for 2021 have just been slashed below ALL expectations. What is it going to take for you to realize this isn't a recovery but another CEO C suiter that is taking YOUR money?"
first crack in the 50 DMA since October -- first recuse normal next time the stock is finished -next real test of the 50 is next week -- no trading on Monday so it is 4 days to the 50---hell is coming
"yep I was one of the fortunate ones to invest in GE at 6 bucks. but I didn't invest enough. I accumulated over 25,000 shares between 6:00 and 10 bucks and I will not sell so long as Larry culp is the CEO. Larry knows what he is doing plain and simple. I have a theory and it's totally one thing always invest in a CEO don't invest in a company. if you follow good smart executive CEOs just follow them and you will never lose a dime in the stock market. another CEO I'm following is Sue Nabi. she is the best in the industry hands down nobody better. she also took the helm of a company that was dragged into the ground by four CEOs in 6 years. I won't mention the company for those of you that do your own research look her up and see what company she is running now it's absolutely a great opportunity to get in. she'll turn this company around and 1 to 2 years and triple your money in a #$%$ market. and it's a recession proof market. good luck everybody"
Culp will shuffle the deck......unleash shareholder value. That’s what great CEOs do. Culp is a great CEO.
"There are actually fundamental benefits to the reverse split. While of course many companies that perform a reverse split continue to be dismal investments, some that turned out to work out very well were Priceline, Laboratory Corp. of America, Corrections Corp. of America, Titanium Metals, Raytheon, and Intuitive Surgical."
reverse split news have bigger effect than any future good ge news
"Who foretold on here that the share price would hit $100?? Kudos man, you’re a genius!"
Waking up to a reverse split on any stock you own.
"My 2 cents for $GE. they need to jump in to structural composite business targeting EV makers, $TSLA, $F, $GM. GE has a lot of composite know-how, from aviation and wind turbine businesses, that will be a perfect match for making EV lighter enabling more battery mileage. Any such partnership with an EV maker will sky rocket GE value."
"In 4 years, GE’s giant wind turbines will be everywhere. Hundreds of thousands of them. Bringing good things to life."
GE was very good to me this year. Happy New Year everyone! See you at $14
But what about the precious Six Sigma strategy? They told me it was a winner for sure.
We back to 5T:13.06
The RS is a smoke screen. Look at their projections for EPS. They are still struggling bigly. NOT growing but shrinking the business.

GE has been doing all the right things to provide a better business plan that includes strengthening the company for the future and to provide a solid escalating share price to retain and attract future share holders. I feel very positive about their 5 Year Plan.
GE will go back near $13 by this Friday and >=$13.5 by next Friday. Accumulate more if the bears pushed it under $12.5 again ( I don’t believe it will)
No RS announced by GE. This news was leaked to see how the market react. Now they know and will not do a RS. it is a great buying opportunity for investors and GE's shares buy back.

Finally getting the volume necessary for large % moves - 200 mil per day target. Look for news pre-earnings week and then post earnings week - get the big bang for the buck. Chart is outstanding - first major resistance was $11.50 level - then it's a fight to the annual high at $13.26. We all know what happens after $13.26 is breached.
Think about it. The handful of companies that make up 90% of the market count have a handful of buildings jam-packed with computer hard-drives but don't literally produce anything tangible worldwide that drives societies. Its no wonder Apple is trying to get into the EV market. Meanwhile companies like GE literally power and move the world.
I am down 1.4% of my portafolio and am 79% in cash. ready for buy more GE under 10.5.
Be Happy !

Biden will push wind very hard over next two years and it will be great for GE; patience grasshoppers. I'm just a little sorry that it doesn't appear GE will get too involved (if any) on all the great EV charging stations that will soon be dotting the landscape. I'm used to seeing the GE symbol on anything electrical; it's a name I trust very much. I hope they square the whole charging station deficiency in the near future. We'll see. Hey see what the Reddit people are doing to all those hedge fund short sellers in AMC? Very cool; IMHO hedge fund short sellers are an abomination anyway.

"20 holdings, GE is only one down today (3/10), apparently due to news about 1-8 reverse split. Just as an increase in share price in response to an announced forward split is irrational, this fall in price in response to announced reverse split is irrational. A modest buying opportunity."

When you pass it to your heirs (spouse not included) as Gomer Pyle would say; ""Surprise, surprise, surprise"", this too is a done deal.

"GE is a powerful company.In the top 11 industrial companies in the USoffices and manufacturing plants located in 80 countries.At least 200,000 employees actively doing things that are always adding value to the company.Over 100 years old and still going strong.Exceptional leadership in Lawrence Culp.Culp traditionally understates earnings and will do so this time.The stock market is ""forward looking"" and only a fool would think that in 12 months GE will not have impressive free cash flow approaching $1 a share (around $8.8 billion) and that translates to 20 times earnings or $20 a share at the end of this year.You would have to be an idiot not to see this for what it is - a terrific opportunity on an under priced stock.A little patience starting with waiting until Tuesday for the earning would pa off handsomely.."

Now, GE is crucial to America. Makes over $100 billion. Yet, it is trading at $12. This world is absolutely messed up."

I’m out till the dust settles
Ge wants to close over $12. So effing let it!
JJ did you take my advice and cover? Don't be greedy and regret. (your words)
Low volume and still going up. nice. More buyers than sellers
When you sell off 65% of gains on earnings days that basically tells you investors have little interest or faith in owning this long..
Calling all volume police - come on man - need 150 mil plus here to get this moving - bring on the earnings already!
"We expect GE’s financial engineering house of cards to collapse, massive interest obligations, declining revenue, scale deleveraging and margin deterioration all will continue to drive lower free cash flow. Multiples will have to come in to match cash flow declines, our 24 month price target is $3.19 implying a 400% decline from current Share price"
You couldn't get away from this train wreck fast enough....sell sell sell....
"day trading is okay. otherwise, it's no hope for investment in long. not worth it. stay away. Larry Sculp may trick you."
Am very disappointed at the way Larry Culp handles the RS
How long Culp has been at the helm? GE is down 20% during the past one year (Jan '20 - Jan '21)..
How is this stock pps manipulated within one penny.??
"Along with the RS, GE is getting a new trading symbol: #$%$"

SHORT SELLERS are here to stay..............take your profits herejmho
GE needs major news to get this freighter moving - the CEO salary issue will be put to bed quick once $15 level hits.
Bone head decision by board....look at value destroyed with announcement of reverse split. Shame Shame Shame

"""Former General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt, the scandal-plagued leader who was ousted after years at the helm of the company, is responsible for destroying the sprawling, multinational conglomerate, according to Home Depot co-founder Ken Langone.""“He had a big steel ball on a crane and he destroyed it as if he was tearing down an old building,” Langone said on Friday during an interview with FOX Business’ Maria Bartiromo."""
"I am in. I bought 1000 shares at 11.59. I think this stock will move up. Of course i also believe in Santa Clause, Easter bunny, and the tooth fairy. So one of them have to be real. I think its GE!"
Tomorrow morning... SQUEEZE!!
GE’s competitor in Wind Turbines trades at a 300 PE. Maybe GE should spin this business off to shareholders.
I can promise $15 for end of 2021 and thats great in my book!
SQUEEZE COMING TO GE STOCK. $50/share would be no surprise!
"humans who know stock market, hopefully they make some cash to go to McDonald and get some snacks, those do not undertsnad the market and talks like they know, will be just talkings and talks and talks -- you are here because it is still a big compnay and you would buy and sell options, if you want safety buy Amazon, buy Walmart, buy Coke, buy IBM, buy Microsoft - pay yourself to buy."

"Oh Warren, where are you???? GE is another perfect buyout opportunity for BRK. Long term prospects getting better than anything over last 5 years; now is the time to strike BRK; when you can still get a great deal.

"Oh the good ideas coming forth;1. $50,000 student loan forgiveness.2. Fed meeting on interest rates. (Take baby steps so as not to excite people. A good round figure would be 4%.)3. It's about time for someone to bring up the $15.00 per hour once more.4. GAS RATIONING - Yep! Will be here before you know it."
i wonder if they will make a statement saying they're no longer considering the RS. i don't think it's out of the question. and the stock would pop back hard...
It is nice to see GE retested $11.95 area. GE’s stock is building momentum here. I expect the price will rise above $12 in 10 days. Bears will last struggle and try to push it down $11.5. We might be able to accumulate some more shares around $11.5. This will be the last chance to see GE around $11.5
Does any one know why or have there posts get stuffed or deleted?. This is the second time i've posted. This is honest information and it is my opinion.
We are all shareholders (maybe small ones) but still have a vote on this reverse split nonsense. Artificially raising the share price from a psychological standpoint is a bad move in my opinion. Let the company keep competing and winning with Culp and the share price will move up on its own. GE should buy back shares if they want to reduce shares outstanding. I feel like GE is making a bad move here. I was a long-term holder but not sure any more.
After this 12 year bull market finally crashes.. GE will follow back to 5.00. Thank your democratic liberal race baiters

"The travel industry will be on a tear in another few months and by summer the world will be flying.By fall and Thanksgiving and Christmas everyone will be beyond the virus scare.By year end 2021 General Electric will be way up in stock price in the teens .At the 4th quarter 2021 the stock will report FCF of around $8 billion for the year 202.The stock price by year end or in January 2022 will be passing through $20.I can only imagine the 2022 stock price as the FCF goes up. Perhaps approaching $30So if you are on the fence on what to do - it is obvious....Culp always understates and he is doing that now. His results will be a lot better than he is admitting to the world today.I have owned a extremely large GE position since I bought in August at $5.98 and have multiplied since then.Ignore the ignoramousouses that only recommend s stock AFTER IT EXPLODES and not before it advances.That is a lousy way to invest.Use your own common sense and you will prosper.And tune out the JP Morgan Stephen Tusas, and the $5 depression stock price kooks, and the ridiculous GE shorts, and all the other doom and gloomer stock dabblers..It will happen in spite of these deranged people who are definitely not investors with a long term horizon ahead."

"GE STRONG BUY, 1% short same as AAPL, AMZN, GOOG..#1..So many Institutions ADDED around 2 BILLION share-counts to their GE positions, ie, Fidelity added around 400 million, Vanguard Group added 400 million, T.Rowe Price Group added 450+ MILLION share counts, StateStreet, Virginia Pension, and many more institutions, pension and sovereign funds added MILLIONS too. Don't forget the little mom & pop, us little retail investors who are adding MILLIONS of shares to our humble investments.. Toosa is putting JPM or their clients on the hook to deliver $$30+ BILLION worth of shares, perhaps that is why Toosa aka Markapolos desperately threw the whole kitchen sink at GE multiple times. All said and done, when dust settles, someone, collective group are on the hook to deliver those HUGE number of shares. I believe Toosa's unprecedented foolish ego put our dear JPM's & Clients' huge amount of resources on the hook, in danger, and it's many times BIGGER disaster than the ""JPM London Whale $6 BILLION LOSS"", GOOGLE about it.. I LOVE JPM as I LOVE GE, both are American, contributing in very important matters. But GE stands tall over JPM as the PRICELESS CROWN-JEWEL of America, none can fill GE shoes, hardly competition ever existed. JPM, AAPL, GOOG, AMZN etc can NOOT claim this, because they have 1000s of copy cats, GE near monopoly.. I humbly suggested our dear JPM to replace Toosa before he and his buddies cause further damage to HUGE RESOURCES of JPM & Clients, and their reputation..#2 PRICELESS GE CROWN-JEWEL of America. For USA/World, it is absolutely imperative, absolutely must to have GE PRODUCTS & SERVICES, FED-$DOLLAR to function and grow World Commerce/Economy GDP. Not even AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, lol NFLX, JPM, WMT, none can claim that enviable position except GE, and US Gov-FED $$DOLLAR.. Even AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, JPM, WMT, OIL & Gas have MILLIONS of copy cats, lessor quality, but others can do the job AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, JPM, WMT doing.. Just think, study GE products and you will quickly know what I am referring to. Aviation-Engines, GE Healthcare chips, softwares, critical emergency-room machines, from big MRI, X-Ray, CT-Scanners to tinny hand held devises that count your heart-beats, pulses, while you or your dearest ones clinging to last ray of hope to be alive and saved. These GE products & services, machines & equipments, Intellectual Properties are PRICELESS TREASURE-TROVEs.. GE Intellectual property Assets in Healthcare is Microfluidics which makes Healthcare Bio-Chips and Bio-sensors work by Emergency bedside diagnostics, also diagnostics in Bio-Chips.. Same goes with GE Aviation, same goes with GE Military Marines Systems, Growth in surface Vessels & Submarines propulsion, 10-15 years Growth areas.. GE has some compelling innovation portfolio in this area, none talks about it.. That is the GE CROWN-JEWEL I am referring to...."

"This is nuts. Why not buy back shares. You cut dividend, then sell assets and then reverse split so that you will be like you competitors. wow!“The reverse stock split would decrease the number of shares outstanding to a number more typical of companies with comparable market capitalization,” GE said in a statement."
GE will be one of the best performing stocks in 2021. Tony Balooga picked GE as his bottom fishing stock of the year last August. He’s never wrong. Tony thinks $24 is where GE is headed with a V shaped recovery.
Please sell your shares on the this reverse split news. I will be buying the dip and HODL!
Greek banks and shipping companies used reverse split to eliminate retail investors and scam money into CEOs pocket. Citi bank reverse split at $5 and has stay at $5 for the past 10 years or more. How will this work out? We will see. Remember that GE promised us a windfall at $30. That has put a new meaning into wind fall. More like turd fall.

Overall GE $30 a share sounds good?

"Reverse split good strategic initiative to reduce shares outstanding to 1.1B and line up with industry peers. This is what CFO just stated , that’s it . PERIOD.quit whining......CulpHas the wheel , he is 100% behind every strategic move , this will play out well."
Going red.
Even if GE is at 10.30 friday next week the 10.5p would be at around .20 cents.
"So, to all the whiners whining about being ""kicked out of owning GE"", why not do this: It goes to $10 (maybe, I doubt it actually, but I hope so). Load up. It goes back up to $14 if not $15 before split, IF it even happens. You just KNOW it's going back up, and you also KNOW Culp will be announcing more huge things before then -- he's the master of timing, if you haven't noticed yet. Every single announcement comes with great news to set off horrible news. The thing is, post-split it's going to be great news after great news. So, yeah, load up now, you're up 20-30% before split. If it goes down 20%, no big deal. You got all your shares and don't have to pay $100 per. Then you're not ""excluded"". I guess everyone here is an annoying day trader and that's why you guys cry b/c it's harded to buy/sell 50 times a day at $100. That must be it."
Thanks a lot TODD for clarifying and yesI did hear the reverse split usually is sign of negativity....

It’s turning the corner. 2 more years and it’s flying again

The GE 10.5 seven day put option is selling for .17 cents. That is 10.33 before commision. before the bell that put could be sold necked for more if ge goes lower a d is doing itvnow. I am a biver that we will have before the close or AN HOUR AFTER mondays secion the first of Feb
I have been holding on my GE shares for a decade. The dollar average is $29.. I will buy more to bring mire dollar cost average to around $25. Hopefully I will break even by the end of the year.
GE's 3 year recovery is paying off at the same time that the pandemic is winding down. How high will the stock go this year?
"EV has a bigger CO2 footprint than ICE. $GE has a better EPS than TSLA. If it weren't for government money TSLA would be negative EPS. yet look at the volumes and price difference.

What are you nuts doing by selling this stock. It amazes me that people are worried about a reverse split. This stock has mega potential and it’s not in any financial trouble. If it happens so be. Have faith in the management team. They have done an amazing job bring this company back. Stop the selling and enjoy the profits.

"Daily pattern for GE: up early in the morning by 25 cents and close either flat or in Red. Even on the best of the best days GE struggles to stay positive. Despite all sorts of good news and upgrades, it just has hard time moving up. Very boring for the past few weeks."

They have been the leader for 2 decades before GE came swooping to their area.Also does about the same sales volume as Siemens.Both Siemens and Vests have lost solid loyal customers in the last 0 days to GE and that is because GE has lower cost, better equipment, nd more muscle to deliver timely.Ironically the wind market is so large and growing so fast that all three will approach the 8% Vests has enjoyed. Possibly more.The World Wind Wind industry report says the industry needs 30% more turbines in the next 8 years and only 3 firms to supply them."

"Longs, give GE some more time. It re tested $11.95 area last two days. The longer it stays >=$11.5 area, the more underline strength it builds. My strategy is to buy and accumulate more GE if it drop under $11.5. This is an long term investment. Time is at at our Longs hand. GE will get better since aviation sector will get better!"
GE stuck back at 1995 level. Remember only 5 stocks gave 80% gain in the S&P 500 in 2020. Most did fantastic last year. Take profits. Rotation into low priced value stocks very soon. IMHO.
"GE shares are reiterated with a Buy rating and $11 price target by Bank of America's Andrew Obin, saying GECAS has a strong and resilient business model with ""manageable"" writedowns.GECAS could average free cash flows of $1.5B/year during 2020-22, according to BofA."

"Motley Fool report is spot on. Just read it. I've been saying this for some time. OK, why I say $3-$5 this year. Btw, I am not an expert and I have no short positions. Sorry for long note but hopefully this will help those who are on the fence. I worked at GE back in the 90s as a young lad and learned so much about management from the great Jack. Great company to work for back then. My division got sold off for pennies because we were not #1 or #2 in the industry and holy cow he threw us out like trash but he meant what he said, no BS. Tons of integrity and self empowerment. Some of the smartest people I ever worked with at GE. Enough of background so u know I am not pulling this out of my butt. GE under crushing debt and if rates rise it will be hammer time. Larry is a great turnaround CEO only if he can monetize the existing business. No doubt he will make the company leaner and more efficient but that won't be enough. He has to raise revenue. Ok, can he raise revenue in jet engines, healthcare and power. 3 core business. Jet Engines: business travel, core part of airlines is not coming back ever as virtual tech improves, unless u believe ecommerce will slow down and more malls will pop up.Healthcare: Very possible but only if they innovate. They stop innovating long time ago... e.g., MRI is dying tech. I can't believe we still use that old tech... We put a man on the moon and that's the best we can do? when was the last time u got an MRI and doctor said, wow that was helpful. every time I get it, the doctor doesn't even look at it. u get the point... lots of old tech at GE. Power: This could be a possibility. As demand for electricity increases via EVs and bitcoin mining (j/k) they can supply electricity via nuclear power plant unless Tesla innovates faster via solar renewables. We had nuclear power and the liberals said no. very expensive... nothing like natural gas. Bottom Line. The turn around of this company is not just about ""cleaning up the mess"". It is about competing with their disrupters. This is where Cathie Wood is right (I don't own a single share of her ETF). GE could be obsolete in 10 years. Can Larry turn GE into an innovation company like it once was, remember this was the company of Edison... OMG. I am gonna say NO because all the young bright minds don't want to work for GE. I love GE, that's my generation Apple. But to young kids they would rather work for amazon or tesla etc... GE doesn't have the same pop like it once did so it will lose out on talent acquisition and there lies the death of this company. Btw, this applies to all legacy companies but they just don't have a mountain of debt like GE so they will last another 30 years vs GE only 5 years and then done. I am making broad statements here with some exaggeration to make the point... u can hopefully piece this together. I've lost lots of money listening to the ""suits"" do your own research, don't believe what you see or hear on MSM."
"As I stated 3-4 months ago.. GE steady climb to $16 with ""No major short squeeze"" .. short-covering is still continuing, accumulation started and continuing. Smart money is still rotating out of expensive Covid-Related tech stocks and unloading speculative positions in EV stocks (NIO, LI, XPEV, etc..), cashing out profit from FAANG stocks and pushing into more stable industrial giants like GE is currently happening.. We will see more serious GE upgrades and good news, and ultimately higher target to $16-$18-$20 bucks before year-end... Buy GE or buy the calls for June to Jan. My favorite is GE $15 Jan 2021 !!!"
"Yo can't spell ""garbaGE"" without GE being in itBreathe in deeply, think a little, let it settle down a bit"
Buying on this dip for long term. Reduce shares available in the future is good.
Imagine this fictitious scenario -Tusa got his walking paper from his employer. Tusa turns against his employer by telling the story how he was pressured to keep GE down for as long as possible. He actually thinks GE turn-around was 2 quarters ago but could not say so. Thus he thinks GE should be trading around ~20.The scenario would make Tusa's career. Could it happen? Anything can happen. Would be fun to watch if real.
"I have had two buys on GE, I am a small investor who bought and it fell. When GE was low 7-8, I decided to sell at 10.71, my cost basis is 11.71 per share, my 10.05 purchase is a winner, my 13.37 is not, should I take the money an run at a loss or continue to hold? I am 62, and have other stocks that are profitable to cover the loss! Rob"
It seems money is rotating out of techs into industrials. GE will benefit from this trend.
I always listen to Jim Cramer’s recommendations and do the opposite . It’s working 8/10 times .

They might want to take some loans that's why they are doing the reverse split. It wouldn't be attractive to dilute the stock if the outstanding shares are enormous.

Gulp had to know this would happen. What was he thinking? Even if they reverse the r/s the damage is done. I for one will no longer trust gulp.
I guess the scary thing about GE as market has rebounded 200 points GE has not
"Nice to see GE closing in on on 9 per share. Culp needs to deliver a strong turn around in addition to timing of asset disposal. Culp needs to smooge Tusa, because Tusa was the only analyst spot on for GEs demise. Tusa has slightly changed his tune, and Culp will need positive reviews from Tusa going forward. 2018 is behind us, GE kitchen sinking 2 years in a row, and probably have significant tax right offs for the year. Culp needs to deliver a clear message on his plans going forward, or else the stock will once again start to tank. Hopefully he learned from last years earnings report mistakes and starts delivering this year. At least get the stock price back to same level"

"Now that GE Industrial is FCF positive (Q4 2020 $2.5B+ and 2021) look for GE to redeem its $5.8 billion 5% Pref Stock on Jan 21, 2021 (i.e. Wednesday) using a portion of GE Industrial's $24 billion existing cash balances This will still provide GE Industrial with $20 billion, including Q4 2020 FCF of $2.5B+. More than enough cash cushion. The redemption will improve GECC's profit by $444 million annually. Historically, 5% Pref Stock payments have been recorded on GECC's income statement within a line item called ""Other Continuing Operations"". The redemption also makes it very possible GECC breaks even / profitable in 2021, meaning GECC no longer is a negative value, but its $13.5B equity contributes to GE's enterprise value as LTC liabilities have been contained / funded over past 24 months and GECC's cash balances of $15B are sizeable and separate from GE Industrial's $20B cash balance post 5% Pref redemption. Finally, the 5% Pref Stock redemption improves GE Industrial's Debt to Ebitda ratio by 0.5 point to , much closer to the 2.5-to-1.0 target, which should be 3.0-to-1.0 this year and achieved mid-2022."
Did not see this jump coming. Hmmm. Maybe my jan 12 calls will be worth a bit next week.

Question for everyone. Do any of you believe these Johnny come latelys have the smarts to pull off this stunt? My opinion is the brokerage companies loaned out more shares than they actually owned.

It looks like the 1.9T stimulus is pouring into the markets.
GE stock knocked back to 1995. Wow. 25 years. Many folks entire working career. Kiddies great time to invest.
I'm thinking of dumping my GE at a 49% loss and moving into BAC or WFC. I expect the recovery will go down the toilet in 2021. Intelligent thoughts?

"WILMERDING, Pa. and BOSTON, (Jan. 14, 2019) – Wabtec Corporation (NYSE: WAB) and General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) announced today that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has closed its review of the pending merger of Wabtec and GE Transportation, a business unit of GE. The merger is expected to create a stronger, more diversified transportation and logistics company.Raymond T. Betler, president and CEO of Wabtec, said: “The DOJ’s decision to close its review of the pending merger marks a significant milestone for our customers, employees, and shareholders. By bringing together GE Transportation, a global digital industrial leader and supplier to the rail, mining, marine, stationary power and drilling industries, with Wabtec’s broad range of freight, transit and electronics solutions, we will have the capability and expertise to invent smarter ways to move and improve the world.”The transaction, which will position Wabtec as a Fortune 500 company with operations in more than 50 countries, is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2019, subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions. Once the transaction is completed, the combined company is expected to have significantly expanded margins, a highly attractive profile based on an improved business mix, expanded global reach, and faster innovation in key growth areas."
"Selling at about 1 times sales...with their various growing segments after diversification of assets, this should be selling at least 2 to 3 times sales...this could be one if the most undervalued stocks in the market...examine their businesses, energy, Healthcare, power. etc...all businesses in demand n Mr Culp at the helm!! Perfect combination!!!"
"I am a bit disappointed it didn’t jump higher today. Positive upgrades, a jump in the market, earnings coming up...I am hoping for 12 this week."
"Bank of America analyst Andrew Obin reiterated his Buy rating for GE and raised his price target from $13 to $14. Cant wait for LC to release a news announcement. With 1% of the float short on GE, just one good news announcement could easily pop the stock to 14 - 16 dollar range."
Repeat of 2020. See you at $4
"Sorry everyone but I want to see GE drop, even if it's for just a few hours. I had a bunch of shares in the $9's and a personal price target of $13. My wife talked me into selling everything at $13.20. Now I have sellers remorse. I'd like to see low $13s just one more time so I can rebuy my shares. Oh, after convincing me into selling at $13.20; my wife turns around and buys shares at $13.35."
"GE, thank you for the alpha"
Btw. close to 12 billion attributable losses in GE‘s equity position. So it will take a time to pay taxes. Equity as such looks ok...
Boy Tesla really screwed the pooch when the did a 5:1 reverse split in Aug of last year. NOT!
Do you think the GE going to 4 bucks nutjob has moved on??
In order for stocks to break new barriers they have to hit support a down trend was triggered the other day. It has been rising for 5 straight months pullback should be here by the end of the week. Jp from the fed going to speak on Wednesday you know what that means.

"I worked at GE for 20 years and left back in 1998 just before Jack Welch left. Welch was brutal and he did turn GE into a profit machine that kept delivering for years despite the toll on it's workforce. When Immelt took over, he ran the company into the ground especially with GE Capital. The new CEO is competent and has a track record of being a winner. I see GE slowly rising back with Culp. The products are still great and he is addressed the debt. GE stock should do well."

Can GE get back to $30 like in 2017? EPS then were 0.48.
THE BOARD IS PROPOSING TO REVERSE SPLIT . why dont you tell those board to stop it right now. and make a news right away until people sell and sue them
SEC needs to look at this one. Culp explained nothing gave very flimsy explanations leading to stock dive during 4th qtr financials. have said for a long time that this is a manipulated stock probably from within GE follow last 3 minutes of each trading day since 12 January. unable to hold or sustain any momentum even after good relative cash flow position. look for bottom to fall out tomorrow after analysts look hard at this one and begin to question where the stock trades are coming from. it is not the option side or shorts very small percentages. these are good questions for Culp whom you all love. has faked you all out.
"Day traded this for several months with 10-20,000 shares at a time when it was stuck between $6-7 a share. Made a lot of money but obviously in hindsight was upset I didn't hold long after $7. After we established a clear upward trend I went long at $9 with a few thousand shares but just sold everything before market open today. This stock does not react well to bad news and I expect it to slide for several months. It's certainly feels like management is purposely trying to destroy this stock."
"GE to $13 before earning is very likely with good momentum.. more upgrades and higher targets, the good news is just starting !!"

Sorry for those who shorted in the single digits...but you can stop the bleeding...just cover it and move forward.
i own c which did a 1:10 reverse stock split sure didn't affect its stock value beside me buying more. $3 to $30 and look at the price now.
Don't Worry.. Be Happy!
Is there a way to look up how much of a short position JP Morgan is holding? Or any individual or organization?
GE is the third most traded stock on Robinhood.Apple is the top and Tesla is second. So with GE in third place a lot of the activity in GE is from Robinhood investors.That ccount for some of the froth u nd down in the stock.There is little on the Reddit Board on GE so it is a pure investment ply on the part of the public.
I just took a put. I am sure it will go green tomorrow.
This is a sad American story.

U have screwed GE shareholders for years...just my opinion...do your own DD!!!"
reverse splits are like lipstick on a pig the only thing that's going to make this stock go up is cleaning up the balance sheet

The federal government is betting $20.3 million that General Electric Co. can turn an MRI machine used in hospitals into a renewable energy powerhouse.The Department of Energy's Wind Technologies Office recently awarded the grant to a team of engineers and scientists at GE Research in Niskayuna in hopes that they can take superconducting magnet technology from MRI machines and use it in the generators that create electricity in large industrial wind turbines that GE makes.

"I cleaned house shorting GME, and AMC. Only small positions, but made close to 9K. I still have short positions in GE of 10.50 and 9.75. I hit and closed a 10.75 position last week. I will probably cover my 9.75 position and lose about 5K, but will still hold on to my 10.50 position. I am not ready to go long on GE till about 3Q"
What or who is this Tusa?
here we go
Write a complaint letter to GE investor relations (just google the email address) asking to throw away the reverse split. Not even propose it for vote. DONE. Back to $20 by June.
A reverse split never works out well. There was no need for a reverse split. I would say if the stock was under $2 then he might consider it.
I wish this had happened today. Let’s hope mondays volume supports and increase this
"any chance we will still hit $13 many of you predicted? How about getting back to $12? One day, maybe, message boards will realize that pumping doesn't actually work."
"Tusa will upgrade today, but below market to save face."
need a stock buy back to get this up
"So true: GE union boss outraged. Mr Culp’s $47m bonus “is absolutely outrageous”, said Carl Kennebrew, who heads a union representing GE workers under the AFL-CIO, the largest US union federation.“How can GE justify this type of enormous bonus for its CEO, while workers, their families, and communities are suffering?” Mr Kennebrew said in a statement to the Financial Times. Culp made over 29 million in 2019. SAME GOOD OLD BOYS CLUB AT GE. The executive's get huge salaries and bonuses, the workers get screwed, and shareholders are left holding the bag. Share price is lower than when Culp took over, and he gets a 47 million dollar bonus. PRICELESS"

Waiting to see what Larry has to say on Bloomberg at noon.
how is he ever been destroyed .... currently it's doing great.... renewable ever heard of it..... Boeing went up $18 yesterday did the shorts destroy that too...
Hold on tight!!! Higher prices coming. The last weak hands are finally gone for good. Great time ahead. You don’t weak hands around.
"Does not make any sense to buy shares now. news of an impending reverse split will put pressure on the shares for the foreseeable future. Longs just hang on for a not so fun ride for next 6-10 months. As a GE shareholder, i'm used to getting hamstrung by the GE board. ""Meet the new boss; same as the old boss."" The WHO. We did get fooled again!!!!!!"
DOWN DOWN DOWN GE GE REVERSE SPLIT HORRORRRRRR LOL
As expected. The Culprit continues to dismantle GE.
Does anyone like a reverse split? It seems as though the market doesn't- down 5%.
All the above plus any good news we will see $20
With shorter U.S. life expectancy due to COVID. Won't the projected cost model for the memory care insurance policies that G.E. sold decline significantly? Isn't there a lag in how these lower costs make it into earnings in US GAAP accounting ....like the time lag it took for increased costs to make it into GE's accounting?
THIS is just following SPY
"Investors beware, The Yahoo message police are deleting negative posts for some reason, very sketchy."

Happy to see ge growing its a safe bet at this price.
.14 from the 52 week high.I would love to see it break that today and continue up this week
Didn't have many and now I have NONE. R/S rarely work out for the little guy so Thanks for profit and good luck to anyone holding on.Make sure you have some kleenex handy....
Another dreadful year of stock performance. Last 12 months SP down over 10% as market it’s ALL TIME HIGH. Just amazing and the management and directors continue to draw incredible salaries.

"I have had this stock for a long time. It never use to disappoint me, it was always in the red. I was really hoping for a change. I decided to sell today at a small loss. I first bought it at 19, 14, 12, and then 6. I finally thought things were turning around, but with the businesses selling off I cannot understand how this company can be anymore profitable, but I kept hope. I am done. I kept a 100 shares in case I am wrong. at a cost basis of 7.78 dollars. I cannot fathom where their cash flow is coming from, and I damn sure do not understand what this reverse split is about, even them thinking it is a good idea. I rarely ever sell my stocks, but I am not going down the RO again. With the other 100 shares I am willing to go down with the ship."
"After the close, downgrades will come, and bad news will be released."
"Culp is making a smart move with 8:1 and it still needs to be approved by stockholders. Even if GE gets to 20 then 8:1 would be $160 a share, well below what Danaher and Honeywell trade at $218 and $214 at today's stock prices. RS makes sense and doesn't do anything to shareholder value it's just dividing the pie into bigger slices."
Who is selling???
In other words there is no place for the Retail investor in GE's future!!! That's just bull!!
The split is for institutional investors. It’s actually a wise move. You’ll see.
another day another loss. will be low volume and bet goes down 2% today meaning all gains given back in 3 trading days this week on a total of 1 normal day trading. manipulated stock like none other.
I added more to my already large position. it will turn around soon.
Very bullish
One more week until earnings report...
"Repent people, 75% drop is coming"
"GE bringing to market a large-scale offshore wind turbine that can compete with Vestas and Siemens Gamesa gives me a lot of hopes in $GE. GE is a reliable American manufacturing company and the new president is willing to invest in renewable energy, especially in offshore wind. $GE is a must-have in every portfolio right now."
I wonder what GE has planned for news post earnings? Ya know it's going to be huge.
"Tusa acknowledged strong 4QFCF and is asking about capital reporting changes. Carolina answered that pushing the accountability back to biz is to be more clear and reflect in external reporting for transparency. Tusa - growing assets in GE Capital? No, keeping flat. Relatively benign line of questioning."
Financial rating set to be downgraded after this deal to a couple of notches above junk. So who cares ?
"I think we are on track to see a DROP, down to the $9.70 - $9.15 range. GLTA"
I love this action but it seems like a little too much too fast. That's the way this Mkt works I guess.
No volume again! 
Buying opportunity
I only have 3 holdings now. 2 of the 3 are reverse splits. Lmao! The other one is RAD up on both.
Sunny Skies ahead for GE shareholders.
pre-market pretty bullish hahahaaa!!! where are all the GE investors dump now...
"I encourage all shareholders to contact GE investor relations, check the GE website, to express your displeasure with Larry Culp's proposed reverse stock split accounting gimmick."
Think RAD
"Toosa LOW iQ admitted, GE IS TOO COMPLICATED FOR HIM.. Well, get a job at MCDONALDS, Flipping burger all day, repeatedly it everyday for 365 days.. Is that simple enough for you Toosa Girl or She-M@le ?? Mr. Buffet's sprawled conglomerate is not too complex, JPM's complex balance-sheet with all kinds of bad toxic loans, liabilities, investment toxic packages, toxic sh#@#TY derivatives are not too complex.. ?? JPM is balance-sheet is 100 times more complex, it's just Wllst politics, current negative targeting against GE. Therefore, throwing the kitchen sink at GE, over and over again, multiple times is justified, even if this narrative is all 90% false, lies, twisted facts, manipulative narrative"
I'd be getting involved in these stocks now... we all know clean energy is a big focus in the next 10 years.... GE wants be a dominant company in the industry.. don't miss out

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GE/holders?p=GEGE at this price is a defensive play . Look at the number of institutional holders that invested in this company . A great play for the new technology for renewable energy.
"The message John Flannery failed to deliver last week. GE ended Q3 with significant Aviation above Q3 plan. GE along with our joint venture partner will meet our 2018 commitment by December. The Fed interest rate increase so far in 2018 reduces the GE pension risk by $6,600,000,000. If the planned rate increase in December is implemented that will reduce the pension risk by another $2,200,000,000 or $8,800,000,000 total for 2018. The Turbine blade issue disclosed last week has a fix and corrective action has started. (Note: all of this statement has been previously disclosed but not consolidated or spoken from the lips of Flannery)"
Vote against the reverse split and fire the entire BOD as soon as possible!
"I sold out today. I expect the price to drop a bit. However, I do not think they need to go this route and in the end, they may not. I will be watching closely. I am a small fish though. There are people with millions of shares. That is why WSB is actually a good thing. It is also why the hedgefunds and brokers colluded to bring down those stocks. Rigged game for the rich."

"If 500 million shares sold in last 2 days by losers (retail) , then500 million shares were bought by clever buyers (institutions).Just watching this board react over the past 48 hours clearly shows these posters have n clueabout the terrific benefits of the GECA - AERCAP deal or the reverse stock split.And Steve Tusa is the head Indian who is totally blind. There is nothing he said that is right. Any new GE Capital Liabilities on the GE balance sheet are exactly offset by an equal asset and this was confirmed by Ed Gardner on the GE Board.The real cap rate of $115 billion is offset by a total loan net of only $5 billion and will be whittled down to around $15 billion in the next year or so.A lot of idiots buying stock and all will rush back to re-buy as they see their on the wrong side of the deal."
"last years market pullbacks started just about now, but were short-lived nervous market or ready for another pullback"
"My man Tusa is coming through remaining with his 5.00 price target, 40.00 after reverse split. Keep on holding BAGGIES, a 50 plus percent drop is coming. Nice short once again, while you BAGGIES are again left holding the bag. Screw me once, shame on you. Screw me twice, shame on me. BAGGIES must love getting screwed multiple times from this corrupt company."
"No way that GE doesn't come out with press release TODAY, to reverse their decision to do a 1 for 8 reverse split!!"

"The rally started folks we are moving. Monday it will continue. Go GE.hopefully I wil see GE today at 11.10 Yes my opino base on were the stock was few hours ago, not like it was there 6 month ago."
What would market reaction be if $GE was to pull back its proposal for RS
"Higher high and lower lows....patience folks. I agree with many that Aviation is the driving factor behind GE and it will not be until Q3/Q4 that we see this driven up with the return of flights, and that will only happen with the global vaccination. The USA, Israel, UAE, and others are leading the way. Daily ups and downs like this will happen, but once the movement starts to take hold, it will look like the 2000 stock market and i pity those that will get caught short at that point...they will surely lose everything. I have also invested in ""Green"" hydrogen (HYSR) - thinking this will also take off - a green planet is surely needed. would by nice to see GE get involved in this - renewables is their area of expertise as well.GLTA!!"
"This article says GE regularly installs wind turbines with cold weather packages installed. I don’t know if that means it’s priced in to a basic installation, or optional equipment. This article summarizes Texas as more of a carbon issue... frozen pipes, but the fakestream is simply trying to redirect criticism on the dynamics of Arctic Air blasting the middle of a continent. This will happen more regularly as the magnetic pole is flipping, and the suns output increases.https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottcarpenter/2021/02/16/why-wind-turbines-in-cold-climates-dont-freeze-de-icing-and-carbon-fiber/?sh=4cf5dd5f1f59"
trending about 4% while Nasdaq is -2%. Very strong trend upward in my opinion. GE will be a strong factor in rebuilding the US infrastructure starting with Texas. It is a great gem.
dont be silly. there's no squeeze here. take a look at the share structure.
"Oh no rates are still down 92 percent over the last 20 years. No one wants treasuries, until they hit 2 percent yield, then Japan will buy, China, and grandma."
The US market indexes are too high. The market may have a big correction any time soon. GE is a long term play. Hold tight GE stock. Don’t be shaken out and prepare to buy more during the market correction.
Really hope they turn earnings around. The monthly chart is looking better and better.
AMC was only up +301% today..
Hard to believe that management thinks after the reverse split that anyone in their right mind would buy GE at $ 100.Another screwing for individual shareholders from GE.How come they never came up with this when the stock was $5 ?
With over 8.7 billion shares out there that is enough to give EVERY PERSON ON EARTH 1 share and still have 1 billion shares left over!
"Long account getting slapped around. Almost time to refresh some of those holdings. NO, GE is not involved as poser stocks aren't allowed."
"Reverse Split is bad bad bad! Nothing good will come of it. The best for a company to take shares off the table is to buy them back. Granted GE is not in position to do this today. With things moving in the right direction I could see it happing in the years to come. Reverse Split is the kiss of death! Also, forget about a dividend. That will never come back! The only people that win on this is the Board and upper management! Everyone else will take it up the pie hole!"
General Electric stock price target raised to $13 from $12 at OppenheimerMany more upgrades coming. Great BUYING opportunity!!Outstanding CEO doing a great job and moving the company very quickly in the right direction.!
Now down 17% from its recent high.
Analyst rating of 13$ not bad!
"GE is not going anywhere soon. If you are a day trader, you can play buy yesterday and sell today game. If you are long, you can either stay long or sell now, go make money somewhere else, come back one year later, you will still but it cheap. The range trading is set until the vote happens in may. Just like all reverse splits, it will trend down until the split happens."
Ladies and gentlemen...FOMO has left the building......
Tusa is the best. Markopolos is the best. GE has a Culprit at the helm. And Energy will be gone soon. To $4
I’m diamond handing GE
ge needs to go back 30/share
Who bought 11.16 million shares at the close?
cscrew this I SOLD will take my 10% to the bank know i'll be sorry but getting into travel stock
Should $ABB and $GE merge ?
"I hear ""The Jefferson's"" show theme song playing, starting now...""Movin' on up!""GE is a great company. The thrashing is overdone and it's time for reason to take hold. The price should start to rise, soon. The current price is nuts when taking into account the progress the company has made, the return of air travel and airplane sales, the great deal on the financing company, etc. ""Movin' on up!""...Go, GE!Good luck, longs."
Does this open over $13 on Monday?
Nobody made a dime by panicking.GE reduced debt and is accelerating their turn around.￼
Just when you think things are finally working... along comes a RS.
Does anyone know if GE got pension liability extended in the stimulus pkg?
I believe we will see a double from here this year! $25 or higher by 4Q.
Slow and steady wins the race pace yourself with a good solid stock￼
How many more times can it test the same price point without a breakout!? Everyone push!
"Yahoo/Google cut my post also, no bad language or anything, just making a negative comment about the RS.Yahoo/Google, is part of the WOKE / CANCEL CULTURE crowd.A disgrace, this country has a lot of missable, sorry people that think they know it all and want to tell you how to live and control your life.I praise the people who fought to protect that right."
GE Power! Push it to $12.
Took my profit at the peak. Will get back in after this goes back to $9.00
"This is exactly why I am a longer term investor. Yesterday Wall Street was gushing about GE. Today they are moaning.My question is not these two days....but what might be two years hence and, perhaps, beyond."
To all my longs... mute those shorts... we'll be eating good this year 
"over 12.00 plus, good price to get in at.....................loading up, good price for volume buying"
going super critical -melting-up into earnings
"While I don't agree with what happened last night, it was expected. The left has been given free reign to protest, riot, loot, assault, and do whatever they want, while being supported by the media. Every time the right tried to protest, always started peaceful until antifa stepped in, they were labeled as far right wing. The Liberal run media is trying to squash or silence the right and have been for years, I expected nothing less from the right, they were fed up with being silenced."
"it won't take any longer in theory shares shrink, share price increases, eps should also increase! if you have held for 22 yrs give it some time and you will be rewarded, culp is actually doing the right thing. ge in the past has made some stupid decisions and that are now being delt with, i added shares at yesterdays open in fact doubling my position in ge another 12 to 18 months will be in tall cotton"
"I think someone is trying to take a position. They let the price fall then buy the dip, example big run up at the close yesterday. The way the chart looks now, it seems poised to pop back up to 12.00 and change. I still think LC drops a monster news announcement to get the stock to rally higher!!!"
"Come on GE need my 11.50 call in the money by Friday, preferably 12 bucks or more.:)"
Dont forget the large portion of healthcare GE has going for them. With the change in office this stock will continue to go up.
"Share structure of GE is almost identical to share structure of NOK. Difference is, that GE can hardly loose with renewables and healthcare not to forget aviation, once the virus is controlled."
Someone must have turned off the price regulator switch.
The most important item of the stimulus package! Your $1400.00 check can be garnished.
GE and BA will be flying to the moon next week.
all you haters that talk bad about GE one day you wish you owned it so keep talking bad about it that's a good luck charm
"I am a GE bull, but I am only cautiously optimistic over the next few months due to market conditions. However, just before they erase the kitchen sink quarter from Q2 2020, around 2nd week of July, I will likely “back up the truck” and load it with GE."
Wow !
this message board is nothing but bs. A boat load of clowns talk as if they have insider information. nothing but jibber jabber!
I shorted 14.30 this morning before the bell. !!! The gift of GE keeps on giving. Thanks King Larry
Next run (provided market doesn't tank) should hopefully put this over $12.
"Solid numbers all around, with vaccinations rolled out globally, flights will resume and this can only be good, going forward."
"yes I'm sure ge to 0 is a real person (sarcastic btw). It's been mooning for months it's not just going to stop because of a tiny correction (or manipulation, take your pick)"
Shareholder you have the option NOT to approve the reverse split. DO NOT VOTE in favor of it.I will vote NOT to do the reverse split.
High pps doesnt limit day trading......TSLA...hello? A blindrobin is a salted fishDont be a blind robin or....thank you for the cheap cheap shares.
I think it’s safe to say the reverse split will not pass.
RS announced? major bargains here at $7 pre split.
14 for sure today; 15 probably by tomorrow
"Investing is being threatened by investing games that young people are playing these days. Young people day don't want to put there money in a stock and walk away, they want to turn $50 into $1000 in a few hours or a day. The generation of impatience is taking over the market and we are in for a lot of massive swings on whatever stocks they decide to play games with. The whole platform is changing."
Don't worry. Back to 14 by Friday.
the dreaded reverse split
is reverse spilt means 100 share become 800 or the 100 become 12.5
The news is getting more bullish. I think this year is our year boys and girls. Don’t have a lot down on it. Once I get other plays open. Dump some more money on this.
jump jump.
We really need some positive press releases to bolster this stock back up
The stock will jump further when President will announce renewable energy program. It will further jump once 100 million American citizens will be vaccinated. More a question when then if....doubling is in the cards this year.
"GE's Earnings Release is next Tuesday, January 26 th.Let start the run up!"
"GE is a lot cheaper near the end of the day...It has been a pattern for awhile now, starting by 20 or 30 cents gain and letting it fade away as the day gets near the closing time. Unable to hold on to its gain Even on the best days for the market...... with the current rate we might see GE around $15 by 2023"
"in spite of all. yahoo ge average inching up , now at 11.75"
Analysts raised the GE target as they had bought it a lower price before and now they want to sell it higher price. Beware.
10 DOLLAR NEXT WEEK FOR GE
"Some people are shorting Ge in habit, do not realize power of GE producing of FCFSmart up jj"
GE breaking out because I bought some puts this morning. You're welcome.
they never recovered from the 3-1 split issued years ago--just look at a chart
5 million Americans got on airplanes in the last 5 days. Air travel will return with a vengeance. GE will pop.
"With all the new BA plane contracts coming and the US/UK looking for new energy infrastructure, I would be afraid to go short over any weekend as news of new contracts imminent."
A 20% correction from the recent 52 WK high will be time to buy/ add. Don't expect GE to sink below $11.
"Fraudsters on the pretense that ""investors don't understand"" !"
come on GE should ignore the market and go straight up to $12.29 i hope so. forget the market come on! if not i will wait untill next week but it will go up!
It was looking so good. Why put a reverse split out there now?Maybe this is a good time to get more.
12.76 -0.49 (-3.70%)Pre-Market: 8:42AM ESTIDIOTS ARE SELLING AT A LOSEMORONS
Shorting shares will be history soon...we see how they will cover!!
Culprit got his 47 million. He is now taking the money and run.
Tax selling finally over. All my holdings are green
"What happened, does anyone know?"
It still likes $12
Someone on Bloomberg just said the 777 engine is GE. Why can’t we get accurate news?
"With the $43,000,000 bonus Larry made about $65,000,000 in 2020. Underestimate this guy at your own peril. If the stock gets to $17 IN THE NEXT 5 YEARS he will get the full $230,000,000 bonus."
"Think about it. There are so many bloated stocks out there and everyone is nervous and wondering when to get out before most come crashing down. This is why investors are coming back to GE. They are growing, innovative, and safe. There is very little chance they'll go back down now. The safe bet is that GE will continue to go up and touch $20 soon, while all the bloated stocks, like Tesla, other EV plays, and many covid stocks will come crashing back down to earth. I'm not saying Tesla isn't a good company, although for reliability they are rated close to the bottom. Their stock isn't worth what it's at and when investors start getting nervous, they'll slowly get out and then create a snowball effect where everyone will race for the exits.Buy GE and stay safe my friends!"
"Seeing that huge buy into the close was a good sign. We all know what happened today. The most institutionally owned and strongest stocks took a beating to salvage and cover these ridiculous squeezes. GE, GM, semiconductors (heck probably every blue chip with a p/e under 40) should rally back hard this week."
"Reverse stock split, another way to destroy value !"
Hahaha
stock will close around $11 after surging over $12. tells me even with good news with cash flow stock still slides. never seems to maintain any highs or momentum. why? still a lot of big guys pulling this stock down.
"Faux sell off burning out as fast as it swept in. HFT's are to blame. Nothing more, nothing less."
Congratulations to all longtime GE longs --. It hasn't always been easy. Today was the one we've been waiting for!
REVERSE SPLIT IS THE TERMITE OF WALL STREET :) HAHAHAA
"culp got his $42 million for just getting the stock over $10. Now, he screws the shareholders and 1000s of GE retirees who saw their futures ruined by CEOs and the board. These CEOs and Directors i.e. Immelt all walk into the sunset rich regardless of their poor decisions."
"These figures were taken straight from the 10K just filed1) receivable factoring is being reduced from 3.2 billion to to $400 million - savings will be 2.8 billion going to Free Cash Flow2) General Electric has an unused asset of $7.3 billion ownership in Baker Hughes that is available to pay down debt. There are $1.3 billion non recurring charges last year now going to the GE bottom line.3) pensions: every 1/4% (quarter point) upward inflation interest improves GE pension fund by 2.4 billion. GE is now vested at 81% in their pension fund which is above the 80% normal for industry standards. Since we see interest rates moving upward - every point would benefit GE $10 billion or about another 10% in their pension obligation. That is a real eye opener for improving value and reducing their debt.employment and plant closingsNot mentioned in this story are the fact that GE has reduced their payroll 15% last year and reduced by 50% from 334,000 employees to about 170,000 employees. That 15% represented a savings of about $12 billion payroll plus taxes. also they closed a lot of US plants moving from about 140 manufacturing facilities in the US to bout 70 plans now."
Upgrade! $16 PT Amazing Call
General Electric Earnings: Revenue: $21.9B (est $21.83B)Power Revenue: $5.38B (est $5.34B)Healthcare Revenue: $4.82B (est $4.77B)Aviation Revenue: $5.85B (est $5.64B)Adj EPS: $0.08 (est $0.09)
Does anyone want to apologize to GE_to_$4? lol
This is like a kick in the face by GE. GE stock will now most likely drift lower for weeks if not months if not years. RS’s are just not well tolerated.
Smart money jumping in 
"all is well, 11.35! a good price to move higher from here. keep your eye on LMT, KO, PEP, PG AND VRSN THESE SHOUL MOVE HIGHER temporarely."
"OH ok. (I'm sorry, I know the shorts missed me all day, I had an important meeting with some major players...the opposite of the shorts on this board) but alas I am here.Soooo... I see what made this pop, a stimulus bill for RENEWABLE ENERGY in which GE is a beneficiary.Well well well. ...Like I said, I had to keep reminding myself that I bought his for 2021 because we all knew this was coming.Looks like all the stars are NOW ALIGNED for GE.Get ready longs...the future is BRIGHT!"
"We’re at a resistance level from 2018, and experiencing some manipulation. In the news, feeling, and sweepings...Will we be up or down tomorrow?If down Thursday, up Friday!If up Thursday, up Friday!I’m just watching, looking for patterns. But the pattern changes... this carnival is more unstable than normal. The new normal, crazy people are in charge, and they lie about everything outside GE. Inside GE we have a good company with good leadership..."
reverse split and even the mention of it just sucked all the momentum out of this stock... thanks a lot GE....
Congratulations to all the survivors!!
Kudos to Tusa. He got this one right.
"Remember John Najarian last week talking about GE bullish call options? To 11.50? first week in January? well, he’ll be holding next to nothing when his options expire￼. January 8th"
"GE is on the road to recovery. Vaccinate Me, Bro.......I’ll fly all over the world."
"Well, when the trading system is set up to be able to make money on a stock trading it up, down, and six ways to Sunday, this is what you get, until the true value of the stock catches up with itself be black or red."
ITS ONLY GE CLOSE THE GAP BUY BUY NOW
How dare you not be green.
Thank the Democrats for this sell off. 100% the worst platform in modern American politics. The party is nothing that it used to be. 10% correction comming if both Democrats win GA. that speaks volumes
IPV merger with AEVA just approved. If you are looking for a better play.
Amazing volume. Amazing green GE on a down day
I wounded if the GE Honeywell merger will happen. Ow that GE has sold off its air craft leasing arm
"I warned you bagholders, nothing but cost cutting, no growth. keep cutting till nothing. all smoke and mirrors"
"GE is a great potential stock to be the next GME. Too many shorts and manipulators for such a fundamentally strong company. 1/3 of the world’s electricity from GE turbines, 1/2 of every plane takes off with GE Jet Engines and 1/2 of every MRI is with GE machines!!️hope they will notice this."
Just sold April. .35 calls
two quarters in good earnings should upside higher and higher.
GE GOOD!
"If you were worried about short sellers - worry no more.GE stock has moved about $2 in the past week or so and anyone of the people holding the $80 billion in short positions lost a lot of money and are now sidelined for good.Someone or someones big are now buying into General Electric.. Buffet? Ackerman? Paulson? Add all the good things happening (see below) that Goldman Sacks upgraded today to $15 the March 10th investors meeting which will definitely move the stock The 1st quarter FCF being at the least down from $2.2 billion a year ago in 1st quarter. which was disaster but got rid af skeletons in their closetAnd a projected FCF of $-.2 to $-.6 billion this 1st quarter, the purchase rush all over the world to move into wind power.GE Haliade is the dominant offshore turbine wind choice, and in wind power GE is getting better situated to make this their 2nd most important dominant industry, The pairing up with Toshiba for the Asian market and especially Japan.The recovery of aviation as the vaccines are injected worldwide The loss of Pratt and Whitney and also Rolls Royce aircraft engines as serious competitors to GE engines (GE is the major 747 engine supplier as of now) Their new found place dominating the industry with their certified new GE9x engine, and the stability of their healthcare profit center. That along with Baker Hughes stock worth more every week and GE having at least that $8 billion asset paid for the serious reduction of all their overall debtthe minimizing of their pension funding necessity that now exceeds the 80% needed (now at lest t 81%the return to inflation and every 1/2 point adds to the pension fund income $0 billion, the reduction of their exposure and borrowing at GE capital the the return to a better power generation and far more friendly equipment offering - all this and more is a rel reason to look at a $20 stock coming up.I personally can see them moving the over $10 billion free cash flow for 2022 and a $30 price coming up in the nearer and not the far future and there is little to stop it from happening.All good nes for Genersl Electric."
A lot of long time holders broke even or made a profit when they got in at $6.00.. So this is expected.. More sellers will come when the price goes up and more people break even.. Overall though looking pretty good
20 coming by the end of the year. 15 by next earning. Tusa's pants on fire.
Dow over 300 today. Look out below when Dow drops tomorrow. Tomorrow looks like profit taking day.
"Do you remember when NoYB said GE ain't gonna get to $8, LOL"
"All, like any stock, it moves with the market - it has its up days and down days, but what i do see is higher highs and higher lows. A lot of fundamentals behind that, not hype: stronger aviation, stronger renewables, stronger healthcare, positive FCF predicted for 2021, and on-going stable management with steady progress. All of this provides credibility, and confidence with institutional investors who are looking to provide their clients a decent return. This is not GME because it is has a real business behind it. I still believe we will be in mid to high teen's by year-end. Shorts will have their day from time to time, but they may lose it all as they risk betting when it will go down, and find out it has risen again $1.00 or more.....hold until Q4 and you will be rewarded, IMHO - GLTA!!"
$ 20 on April.
"the year of the CULP, next m&a any day, $14 any day"
What GE should do is announce a 10 for 1 stock split. Bring the total outstanding shares to 88 billion. That will send this mother up to Pluto.
"Could this be the"" handle"" forming on the ""Cup"" seen on the monthly chart?"
$GE is a bargain. PE will be dropping as revenue continues to go up. Still believe it will close above 10% today and another 10% before the end of the week. Shorts are going to get sqeezed.
General Electric is down 4.91% to 12.60
Sell the news
market cap 120bill.... ge stock under 14...dirt cheap!!!
General Electric is definitely BACK!!
"GE is to back the Engineering Design Center in Poland, one of the largest centers for turbine technology development in Europe for another 15 years.The Engineering Design Center (EDC) in Warsaw houses more than 1,300 engineers, with around 600 in the Łukasiewicz – Institute of Aviation working on R&D for aviation programs, as well as Gas Power and Renewable Energy."
Who is laughing now.
This stock will beat tesla but Im currently trying to pump dodge with my group we are heavily buying this dipp Lets GO GE AND DOGE
I do not like reverse splits. Stock will tank after splitting. Getting out.
Shorts are getting desperate. JJ you need to calm down and just admit defeat your short position is done
Money is rotating from tech to industrial. That's another catalyst for GE!
RS followed by dilution...
13.50 today?
"Someone here should start an online seminar called --- Shorting for Pennies To Afford Low Grade Vodka, Quickest Way to Be a Homeless.Hey if you make money, I want a piece of it because it's my idea."
I have missed so many opportunities to make serious money during this 12 year bull market. Owning GE was another mistake.
Where's Chickens and dewd? Still working for the Chicago Sanitation department?
Shorts will write in their will Do not bet against king Larry
Larry is full of surprises
THANK YOU LORD SHORTED MORE AT $13.30 PER SHARE YEAH BABY
"Wow look at yesterday TSA numbers, summer looks really goodVery positive for GE Aviation"
Picked a great day to start a very nice position in GE. Great to be up a nice chunk on a terrible day! Go GE!!
Jiffy Jeff went on to bigger things...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFgFUudn9Vw
A) Boycott Coke since they do not like white people and literally have said as much yesterday.B) Hold GE because it is going back to $30 and probably a lot higher.
$50 by 2022. $20 by May.
Tough being a GE hater when you get your head handed to you every day. But these folks spend their lives in their mothers basements being wrong so oh well.
"They are bending the shareholders over, just like they did to the pension folks."
"I'm with you on this unethical company. They do not call them ""Wolves of Wall Street"" for nothing!"
"I am thinking easy $12 this week with one more upgrade .... and I am still expecting BIG NEWS any day !!!Good longs .... One trading tip, Buy and roll March $12 calls in 2 weeks to June $15 calls, Hold and Roll into Jan $17 calls in 6-8 weeks.. cool strategy to double on the double for the triple !!!"
Should we see more downward movement now that the stock lost 20%. It probably goes sideways for awhile before finding its true direction. We should demand an explanation about the RS from the management. Losing $20B of its market cap is unacceptable and more losses will happen if RS actually happens.
500 shares at $8. looking good so far
"The 9 cent a share would represent 8.7 billion shares multiplied by 9 cents a share = $783,000 million profit.Culp said this quarter he would deliver $2.5 (Free Cash Flow) profit.That profit he expectes is 3.2 time greater than all the ""experts"" predictions.Now either Lawrence Culp has it wrong or the ""experts"" cant do the math...Culp is a professional. He understates.He veers to giving clear and honest statements.The ""experts"" are selling themselves as ""experts"".They shoot with hardly any facts That is because they can not be called out.Neither you or I can reach them so they can hide ad after say they were wrong or surprised or even worse - claim they knew.I think Culp knows a lot more than the ""experts"". I project he will get closer to $3 billion profit in the 4th quarter 2020.If that was just $3 billion FCF for the 4th quarter - it would be no news.But Culp also told us the 2021 year they would be profitable all quarters.Simple math would take the FCF for 2021 to around $10 billion .At 20 times per share or a multiplier of $1.10 per share profit for 2021- the stock would be least at a $20 price.It is fashionable to under-estimate the number and then act surprised when the company exceeds the 9 cents a share on Tuesday.In this case the public already knows what the number will be ($2.5 billion) or maybe even more.So Tuesday either General Electric matches the estimated $783,000 profit predicted by ""experts"", and we find Culp is a basket case and does not know what the numbers he promised are actually supposed to be.Or Culp told us the profit was going to be at least $2.5 billionMy money is on Culp. The fact is that he is shrewd.If GE has 4th quarter profits of $2.5 billion, expect the stock to rocket upward Tuesday.I think $13 a share that day is totally logical."
The Giant GE has been awakened. Time to celebrate.
It takes a year's patient to be back!
How is your sentiment regarding GE today? Mine is PUTRID.
Out at 13.30 before this #$%$ goes down more. Was going to hold before but reverse splits don't usually end well.
Priceline 1:6 in 2003 Stock up 10x since then.BKNG
hard pressed to find a more pumped stock on CNBC--they mention it multiple times withe the same story line --like you can keep getting people to buy on thee same news-- nothing new here and investors day will find a reason to sell-- add to it the market is wildly over bought - target price 12.61
GE need to do something to get back the retiree investors. Those dividend cuts should never have happened.
bad time to even think about reverse split...bad move on BOARD members...I hope it would be cancelled in MAY when they vote.......EVERY ONE to say NEY.....NEY NEY
Do shorts cover now...like right now...or wait till $11.50 ?
Can someone please post a link to a press release about a reverse split announcement.￼
They want GE to go down to 5.x - if so I want GE CEO pay me back what I pay him
"Any idiot knows technically it is a zero sum game. So don't give me your MBA hogwash. All this reverse stock split does is eliminate a small guy who buys a couple of thousand shares at current price and the stock goes up a half of point & he makes $1000. Great percentage gain. This knocks this player right out of the game.Institutional investors, mutual funds, etf etc. They do not care because they have blocks of funds to invest unlike a nichol& dime trader Will you buy shares of GE @$13 x2000=$26000 or will you buy 2000 @ $80=$160000? How many of you are willing to invest that amount of money in GE?"
Any one has an idea why GE is opening low???. It had a superb run yesterday
The entire world knows that GE closed over $12.00 per share today. Bells are ringing.
"THIS JUST IN Jan 9th 2021 ANOTHER BOEING 737 ACCIDENT?Sriwijaya Air flight 182, operatING with a Boeing 737, maximum departure took off from Jakarta at about 1:56 p.m. local time and lost contact with the control tower at 2:40 p.m., said Indonesian Transportation Ministry spokesperson Adita Irawati.The incident comes a day after the one-year anniversary of the shooting down of a Ukraine International Airlines flight in Iran with 176 people aboard, one of two major airline crashes in 2020. And it comes just over two years after a Boeing 737 Max crashed in Indonesia, killing 189.What is going on.... they just cleared this for flight how will this newest 737 accident affect GE stock?"
"compare ba chart with ge, it tells the story. past year or past 6 months"
Do you think GE can reach 30 or above? What will be the time frame even if it happens?
GE makes class leading products. To bad the company is so miss managed.

Short FANG go long GE? Seems a great short/long idea. Buy.
"Moody's sees risk to GE's nuclear business - MarketWatchhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/moodys-sees-risk-to-ges-nuclear...""Even if GE has no legal liability related to the Fukushima reactors, its energy business will face risks if there is a meaningful slowdown in the global expansion of nuclear power,"" Moody's said in a note to clients. GE's Nuclear Plants and Instrumentation division accounts for about 1% of GE's annual revenue of $100 billion, Moody's said."

"Here s the psychology of buying stocksHave you ever looked into the fresh shallow water in a clear pool or stream and seen a school of fish swimming in mass.The second one fish senses anything wrong - the whole school swims as fast A POSSIBLE AWAY FROM THE DANGER.After 10 minutes pass and the school of fish feel safer, they will return and go on with their own world.So this pattern is exactly how stock trades. All stock sales (buying or selling) are motivated by either greed or fear.Like the fish, the moment a group hears something to fear- they dump stock and head to a safe place like money on the sidelines.But it is always inevitable that after a short while, perhaps after a few trading sessions, the greed takes over and a lot of people buy stocks. The reason the above is so important is the understanding on how stocks move up and down.Nhat no stock can keep moving in an upward direction. At some point it becomes overpriced and people start to sell. The real result is the stock moves up and down dozens of cycles each day.It takes time to get accustomed to a higher price for any stock. A buyer is weighing the price against the higher greed price. As the stock drops, the buyer is consumed with greed and buys. But the stock also moves the other way.So when I hear someone want a stock to move a point in a day for a $13 stock - that is very unusual. I thing a 5% move in any stock in any day is far more that I want to see. And it is mostly true that few stocks can support 4 or 5 upward sessions without dropping back to a lower level before they move u again.GE hs risen in the past 26 weeks from $6 to $13. That is more than doubled ans there is not actual higher earnings to support the move.There is a lot of buzz that the stock is moving up to at last $20 a share so the last couple of dollars stock price movement is mostly the belief that better times are coming up.Nothing wrong with hope as long as you don't get consumed that GE will be $13.50 next week, $14 the following week, and then be at $15 by the mid April.It takes time and a balance emotional investor to ride a rising stock and ""know when to hold and when to fold"".For now GE is a ""hold"" - but t some time in the distant future it will reach a point where it will be a ""fold them"".Greed and fear always dictate the situation."
OH MY GOD! NOOOOOOO!!!! WHAT IS HAPPENING????
"The stock is not oversold yet, its in free fall"
I'm sitting on 139% profit and holding
reditt investors should put money in ge
Not gonna happen I guess but : does anyone remember GE going up 1 dollar in one day ? :)
last 30 minutes of trading oh what a surprise its falling again..
Classic head fake going into earnings to shake out the weak and get in at a better price. Good time to load up if you have some dry powder.
Oh man @marabound low life is losing his retirement savings.
Of the 1600 Pratt powered 777's in service. 59 were already grounded due to being old and the pandemic. The recurring issue is with their hallow blade design wearing out. This should mean that the planes taken out of service going forward will be theirs and not GE. GE engines will still be used and serviced. Further GE sales and market share are likely to improve having not only the most reliable but also the most fuel efficient options.
Just watched Larry for 15 minutes on Bloomberg. He spoke well but had numerous occasions where he appeared to have trouble swallowing! Also NO MENTION of a reverse split!
"Ge double my money, waiting for triple..."
Motley Fool estimates the value of just GE’s Wind Turbine Renewable Energy business to be worth $36 Billion. Something to think about.

Anyone remember the Citi Group split 10 to 1 ?
"I'm long ge, but dang 8.5billion shares is a lot! Culp better deliver on share buy back & soon. With new administration, a couple of upgrades will help along with pension fund buys of late. Ge will need to sell a heck of a lot of turbines to move this beast! The stock has already moved from 50billion to 100 billion in no time!"

"""GE stock won't go anywhere 2021"" -- Tusa""GE call volume above normal and directionally bullish"" -- FlyOnTheWallWill be interesting to see investors rightly put Tusa in his coffin (figuratively) for his personal vendetta against GE once and for all.

Just looked and GE has MOVED BACK to the same price level as a month ago - around February 15th.Not so bad. All that is missing so far is the past 20 trading sessions and that can come back....
"This is horrible....what a s...t show. The deal is fair , but when the REVERSE SPLIT comes it knocks out the small guys. Its good for Larry Clup because the share price after the reverse split will be $112.00 per share. 8 x 14.....Its good for Larry Culp because he will get a huge bonus cause the share price goes way over 25.00. Its in his contract when he sign on as CFO....he will receive 25,000 million ...What a smart #$%$.....the small guys get the shaft....always vote no on the reverse split if your vote counts anyway.....Sad SAD ....Rigged and manipulated."

"Over the past few decades, Stock Markets have become a blatantly Rigged Casino...It is becoming more & more perverse, these days.."
someone keeps can not handle the truth. keep killing my post. I have never seen a reverse split that benefited an existing stockholder!
Most people here don’t have a clue what a target price with no binding time mean. The clueless people are actually right because it doesn’t mean anything besides the bashing effort everybody can see. Stay put.
Where's that GE to $4 genius??
The fundamentals has not changed! lol
I see $12 sooner :D GL to all longs!
Buy on the dip!
"My advisor called my 2 weeks ago with the following message: ' Buy GE...at this price it is a bargain and expected to be $28.00 in one year, recommended as a buy by the company ( one of the big banks )! So I followed his advise and once again fall in the same trap....those advisors don't know anything."
Let’s at least see a 6% day today !!!! Power hour is coming
This is 20 by Sep relax.
I imagine GE gas turbines are being ordered frantically across the South as I write. Buy.
"GE was the 1st stock i traded many moons ago. I loaded back up when it was trading at $6 a few months ago. With Larry Culp as CEO i really think this will be worth a fortune one day (long term). Lets not forget what Larry Culp did for Danaher and that he also has an huge contract bonus incentive if this stock reaches $18. But for now, $12 is the new hump to get over. Lets Go!!!"
They have a 46% stake in the newly formed company plus the 30 plus billion. Great deal but the reverse split is at 1-8 is not a good deal. If they approve get ready for another long snail climb in sp.
Pretty interesting article on the clean energy boom.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clean-energy-stocks-bearish-164813905.html
"I bought a heavy position at $5.98 and have made a lot of money,"
This is truly one of the Most Moronic Ideas that I have ever heard a large industrial company ever propose.GE should use half of its proceeds to buy back shares instead. Truly Moronic!
Really great to see GE start to come back I worked there 3 times My Father and Brother both retired from there
"The very definition of insanity,... Doing the same thing over and over, expecting a different outcome. GE no longer wants the retail investors business. You have lived out your usefulness to them."
"Wow, sounds like we've achieved partial capitulation. Blood is flowing but might have not hit the streets yet"
Any one thinking a reverse split is a good thing better research reverse splits to see just how it worked out for other companies.......nuff said.......(:
I would suspect GE is involved with the development of nuclear engines Said to be considered for interplanetary travel.GE is an exciting company.always moving the technology along to new heights
Within striking distance of $11 ...... :)
Again Yahoo takes down my free speech post.. welcome to socialism
so what will the stock price be after the split
"Logic. If a RS sends the stock down, than a stock split will send the stock up. So if they do a 8-1 stock split, we can expect shares to go up to 16 by the end of Friday."
Get out of the market this week. A major collapse is coming soon.
"No Country, NOT even Russia, China can make GE Aviation Engines. So GE VALUE WORTH shouldn't be $700 BILLION to $1 TRILLION?? China can make AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, Copy JPM products services, but not GE Aviation ENGINES (only a rare 2 or 3 companies can, even they FAIL in reliability. ONE and ONLY GE ENGINES BIGGEST, MOST RELIABLE, BIGGEST MARKET SHARE.. So, how much is GE WORTH??China can not make AVIATION ENGINES. They trying very hard. But not yet. China, even Russia is DEPENDENT on GE ENGINES. China/Russia ordered GE Engines worth $20 BILLION.. AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, LOL NFLX can not say that..

Don't let a stupid RS mess up all the good work you've done!

I am so sorry about the lower cap for the $1400.00 stimulus check; however most of you that claim you make so much money via Wall Street will most likely sit this stimulus check out.
guess close to 13.00
WOW....GAINED $1.25 AT OPEN ..AN HOUR LATER LOST ALMOST ALL OF ITS GAIN.......SADLY DISAPPOINTING.........
Down 6% on a stick reverse split.....that tells you its a bad idea.
I’m in favor of the stock split. Why would you want 8 billion shares outstanding? Do you want to be like AT&T? No.....you don’t. You want to be like Amazon......a big boy.
"reverse splits are bad news for any company out there, especially one with a hugh debt."
GE will pop back to 11.50 next week. Today was just a knee-jerk reaction to the bad J&J results. We still got Pfizer and Moderna pumping out billions of doses. People will get vaccinated and air travel will boom. GE profit will skyrocket. Don't listen to these lowlife naysayers.
Take a bite out of that Goldman carrot. Go ahead. They have lots of shares to sell you.
Chicago the Windy City you put some wind in the sales of this GE ️ ￼
"The Export-Import Bank of the United States has agreed to guarantee two financing deals that will provide $125 million to support aerospace work at GE Aviation and Spirit AeroSystems.One of the deals is intended to inject liquidity into the struggling US aerospace supply chain, while the other will help Australian airline Qantas purchase seven GE engines, says the bank."
"The company continues to reduce debt in a very difficult environment.General Electric's Debt Industrial Debt GE Capital DebtAt Year End 2019 $32.9 billion $59 billionYear end 2020 plan in March $23 billion $55 billionCurrent year end 2020 plan $23.3 billion $54.1 billionThe bottom line is there is more debt, so what will the sell next the office chairs or private jets?"
Filling the gap. GE will be going up next week.
HEHEHE DOWN DOWN DOWN LAST FEW SECONDS
Now that GE grows up into teen-age years. Most difficult time. Let's hurry up into adulthood.
Another day without Apple making an offer to buy GE. What’s taking them so long? This is how Apple missed buying Netflix. I hope they don’t make the same mistake with GE.

(ADOM) 0.55 /CHEAPEST electric vehicle stock out there =2000%++UPSIDE BOOOOOOOOOM
weak hands - disperse now. great day for the company. this reverse split will pass shareholder muster even though it might not be unanimous. glad to see it. unexpected.
anyone else holding any of the January 15 calls
"in the middle of a great turn around ,, the management seems to be stabbing shareholders in the back i thought jeffery was gone"
"With the J&J vaccine out and 1 billion doses already made - you can expect a lot of vaccinations.60 days ago at Thanksgiving we had Pfizer announce their vaccine followed a week later by Modera.Now 60 days later it is J&J's announcement.Where do you think another 60 days in the Pandemic scare will be?I predict that by May 1st the airlines will start to fly full force and be starting to fill up.I predict the public will be moving a lot more in the summer and by the fall we will be on to other things.I predict summer tourism to Europe will again be popular.I predict kids will go back to college full force in September.I predict by Halloween the kids will be trick and treating.I predict Thanksgiving will once again be reunion times.I predict a fun and fulfilled holiday with all the things we are used to.And by January when the q4 2021 report on General Electric comes out for the quarter and the year, I predict the stock will have crossed at least 16 and be much closer to the 20 that is probable.I have a dream...."
3.3M Shares bought in one minute pushed it over $13.
12's today. Maybe 11's. All softball questions on CNBC. Not impressed.
JJ tell us your position. You say you took a larger short position at 11.64. For how many sharesEveryone wants to know so we can all make fun of you as GE blows past 12. Lol
Every time it moves up somebody dumps so I'm now short GE
"JP MORGAN is the number 1 enemy of GE and its shareholders and its agent TUSA keep back stabbing the company since they no longer make money on GE..........all GE investor please raise your price target to $50...If GE ever goes down to $5, be sure that would be the end of American industry as a whole and not just GE alone and that also would be the end of JP MORGAN as well......my price target just got raised to $ 50 with additional investment"
this is the best renewable wind turbine co
"Bought Ge from $6.5-$7.5, keep long"
GE share price is about as fair and balanced as Fox News.
"When $13 becomes the new floor, our long term uptrend will begin! This month or next, buy and hold!More MAX deliveries, F-15EX orders, and potential AirBus engine sales will give GE aerospace a big kick... "
GE can barely generate 0.50/share free cash flow. Why the run up? Current stock market action and GE stock is laughable.
Ive never seen a reverse split cause positive in the short term. GE is a long term hold but theyve just put a bullet hole in their own collective feet. Im bidding 6. For now and 48 pps after ReVERSE split in May....May. With a variety of Pundits claiming a major pullback in April this might get dicey. Taking 50% profit. Thanks GE...see you later when the smoke and mirrors clear.
Buy and hold then forget it and come back in 6 months or a year. You will be happy! Sure beats a CD rate of return!
4Q Conf Call starting in 3 min
hahaahahahahahahahaha
"Ya but Culp will get his bonus....right? Go King Larry, Darryl and other brother Darryl"

Margin calls will hurt
stop selling!! its will go up to 1280 but stop selling
Shor Sellers taking control......................
$GE Partnership coming Your welcome !!! I’d still SELL and BUY $FFNTF and $RWBYF
reverse split is the best decision the management made to eliminate excessive trading. Ge will become a buy and hold stock with stable future. this is a buying opportunity. long and strong
The market index went up too much today. Prepare for market correction. GE might drift down with market. Prepare to load up if it dropped down to $12.5. The price $12.5 is becoming a support level for GE. It was a resistance level a week ago.
I HATE the financial gimmickery of reverse splits. Get back to making stuff even if it is lightbulbs.
"I am buying again under $12.5 here. It is amazing that I have an opportunity to buy under $12.5. In March 10, GE will be back above $13.5! Remember GE is a stock for long term. GE’s for business sectors (aviation, health, energy and finance) will benefit from pandemic recovery. Moreover, GE pension will gain from interest raising. GE will be $16 to $22 by the year end. Thus, buy when GE stock price’s in weakness."
whats up with the aftermarket red? is this a glitch or real? $10???
"As expected, once they paid $200MM for unethical behaviors, more lawsuits will be filled. GE to $4. Too much mud in their system, no clarity to financial accounting. They deserve to go to the dust."
This has politics written all over the script.
Scandinavian Airline SAS Signs Multi-Billion Engine Deal With GE
Tesla lost 90 billion in market cap THIS WEEK. That is about 76% of GE's current value.
I’m kinda confused why would GE do a reverse stock split. If they are going to do well this year. I’m just wondering? It seems like they got some nice deals in and can really do well without one.
The days going back to $7 is over. They’re a much better company than they were then. Adding on any weakness. GE is going to $30+
I like GE and RAD in the new year.
Premarket makes it look like it will make another run upwards today.Would love to see 12 in the next week
every time reverse split never good... For that reason I'm out....

I would think that $VRAY would be an acquisition target from $ISRG or $GE Medical or some other company. They have a large back order and a bigger company could really get production and installation going at a faster pace. Maybe they don't see the value that I do.
187 mamaMILLiON shares traded. After huge earnings beat. And this is barely up? Lol
Close over 13?
"The MMs pumped up the sp during the last hour to short (sell) 11.50 Call Options for next week..They do this every week , either on Fridays or Mondays!"
Oh My!!! To the moon Alice!
Today we can say it again....Great Day to All GE Investors!!! 
It would be cool if GE selling new jet engines were relevant but its not because TPTB are just going to move onto the next plandemic since everybody knows what Covid is. Ebola is the next scare factor.
"Looking for others to sell, the idea that the CEO has no core is fluttering"
GE: 20.00 pps by March. You'll see.
GE is a $30 stock. Just set it and forget it. Thank me in the future.
Pushing 60mill shares now.
"GECAS ""deal"" has to pass regulators. GL with that. Especially EU regulators. More smoke screen. $36B asset division merging to make a $30B company? Uh huh"
"After analyst day our friend Tusa still has a $5 target for GE stock price, this guy never gives up and is harming his customers, if there are still any listening to him. All other analysts gave a price target ranging from $13 to $15. You can read analysts comments on the analysts day at the following link:https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ge-stock-suffering-biggest-drop-in-9-months-as-analyst-day-disappoints-investors-with-high-expectations-11615487717?siteid=yhoof2"
"jeebus 8 for one reverse split? Let's do the math. I own 100 shares ... 1337 *7/8 = $1170 loss. Welp, take a capital loss on 2021 tax return."
Out of the 500 S&P and the 100 NASDAQ Composite = 600 only 77 shares are up. If no but when there us going to be a huge rally tomorrow or by the end of the week.
If had a dollar for all the Good news about GE
This is what GE is now!
"They should crush earnings next week. Stock might not move much, because this dog is so manipulated, but I’m still holding my $12 March calls.. a month from now it will not be trading under $12."
"Prodigal sons and daughters, you are always welcome back home to GE. We're not going anywhere we've been around over a hundred years and a hundred plus years to go to all the GE long investors out there!"
52-week high! let's hold $12
"Seems there is a lot of guessing about GE's future path and rate of recovery. However, in 16 days GE reports 2018 Q4 earnings and Larry Culp presents his turnaround plan containing how GE will deliver on the $420,000,000,000 order backlog ($94,000,000,000 for Power segment), the pension risk reduction of over $7,200,000,000 due to the Fed tax rate increases, the schedule for completing the Transportation sale to Wabtec and shares delivered to current GE share holders, the schedule for spinning off GE Healthcare and the shares delivered to current shareholders, the value of the recent Iraq Power deal ($15,000,000,000), and too many more positives to mention. The future is bright for GE"
What a hot steamy dump ge has become
We can not get any upward movementI would be happy with a .05 increase todayThis week has been rough. I am still holding strong through earnings
Tusa of JPM is not giving up on destroying GE...
shorted this this morning will be a mega good trade
my texts are respectable you Yahoo should let us write we need to express ourselves it's more damaging to censor our thoughts ....
"Technically, where is the bottom?"
I think it would help if Management explains why they think they need a reverse split otherwise everyone just assumes it is bad. Besides they need to convince shareholders otherwise more selling will happen and will not get approved.
"The Reverse Split Short Squeeze.If you are caught holding a short position on the day the stock reverse splits, it will turn into a GME situation. Shares being bought back frantically, margin call after margin call and $GE will sky rocket. That's what the shorts want to avoid and will spread as much disinformation and lies as possible in order to make you jump ship. Less shares means the price can move up faster and less short manipulation because the share price movement could easily bankrupt a short."
Suddenly my $12 puts are looking a LOT better.
"Bottom line: The reverse split hurts the little guy. Period. If you think it doesn't, you do not know basic math."
It's gone up hundreds of percents recently and I believe it will do that again with or without a RS (which is just rumor anyway)
"To all the GE longs, Congrats!!"
"Your money will have to work much hard after a R/S to make a profit. Typically stock prices fall about 20% after a R/S. Then, you have 1/8th the amount shares. If you are a shareholder, vote against this. On top of this, the market is EXTREMELY HIGH and we have fools in office. It is going to correct so that $104 split price will likely fall about 20-30%. Your money is going to have to work a lot harder. The rich won't have a problem because they will just buy in after R/S."
Not just Texas need to rebuild their electric infrastructure but the whole nation and perhaps the whole world. Climate change finally creating problems for humanity. Soon Venice the small city in Europe will be under water. More ice melting into the sea means heavier rain and flood everywhere plus higher wind. Hurricanes will cause havoc everywhere. It’s coming true. Just logical science. The melted ice water creates more water vapor going up into the clouds creating super storms. You don’t need to be a scientist to see this logically.
General Electric is up 5.38% to 13.22

"JJ doesn't know what he is talking about. Texas turbines are made by Mitsubishi, Not GE. He is trying to scare GE holders because he knows GE is going up steadily. Also, read this. ALL turbines are capable of withstanding cold temps, if they are ordered with automatic deicing. If GE were to be blame for ""some"" turbines freezing, then the stock would have gone down a lot.The claim that frozen wind turbines are to blame for blackouts in Texas is MISSING CONTEXT. While some wind production is offline in the state, it is losing far more generation from thermal sources that produce the majority of power in Texas. Some wind turbines are frozen, but that is because turbines in Texas aren’t built to withstand unusually cold temperatures, as are turbines in colder climates where wind production is used."

"Where did JJ's short position post go ?. I read it last night, he shorted 5000 shares GE at 11.92, and another 5000 at 11.95. But that post disappeared. What's up with that ?. I guess he does not anyone to see that. Here is my prediction......if GE were to go down, he will post that he shorted at higher prices. If GE goes up, he will post he bought lower. Typical."
reverse split probably to increase valuation for the company and take out most short term traders.The stock price will rise much faster after the split. This is the case for GE. Good for long term holders. Weak hands should buy more and hold long term instead.
Tusa still holding at $5?
Buying here.
YAY for me! Just stole 900 $GE at $13.40 Fly the friendly GE jet engines.
"A miss for 1cent , but still make a profit of 8cents. Profit is profit."
GO King Larry!
"Reverse split is a deal breaker, I'm out"
Now that’s a return to take to the bank. Market tripled and GE down 90 %. 20 years of losses. And still being led by a Culprit at the helm.
"Get ready friends. GE stock prediction is $ 30 + by Dec.31, 2021!Contracts, greatly improved revenue flow, strengthening the GE machine! Jg"
You will not be able to get out fast enough. They really trapped the hopeful longs.
$15 before Jan '22 ...
Watching these other stocks up another 91% such as GME simply makes you sick owning GE
Im waiting for a short squeeze.
So many buy orders. Someone knows something we don’t...
The turnaround is happening...GE will be an epic comeback story.
"Sorry...meant they ""used"" GE Trade secret info to win 100's of millions...."
Somebody bought $12 calls expiring in April n invested over $2.1M!! Bought at around$.75...
the drop has started better get out
$11.53 @ 11:53C time.
$20 is definitely coming
GE is a safe haven in a down market aka...stock bubble burst. If I had a choice of where my money is during a crash it would be GE. It will not go down at an equivalent rate of other inflated companies that are oversold and expensive.
"GE IS THE ONLY MAJOR, MAJORE EV ELECTRIC STORY THEY ARE KEEPING UNDER THE RADAR, QUIET.. You do not hear a single noise attention to GE's name is ELECTRIC, GE Technology is ELECTRIC POWER. The Power generators, Electrical Equipments, Parts, the God knows switches and mains, many millions of ELECTRICAL components, are all GE.. All EV roads must go through GE.. Yet, GE NAME IS KEPT SECRETLY, SO MYSTERIOUSLY SILENT.. *AVIATION ALONE ON ITS WAY BACK TO $$30 BILLION REVENUE, WITH $$$10 BILLION PROFITS, and was growing revenue at 10% 2019..*Then there is GE RENEWABLE IN JUST THE RIGHT SPOT AT THE RIGHT TIME, GROWTH AREA. GE HEALTHCARE always was growing, and is high margin life saving, millions of Hospital's Emergency Rooms only hope.. Yet NFLX, TSLA, NIO, ABNB, DASH are combined $$$$TRILLION+ DOLLAR Value, Yet their combined revenues are HALF that of GE..God bless Wallstreet.."
How nice our dividends all went to the top peoples bonuses nice
"We lose 1/2 of aviation business for $24 billion.More than likely, this affected GE valuation, even with the money going to reduce debt load."
"btw, NOBODY on this board knows what they are talking about.... including me"
"it is ridicules to sell in good news. we all should trust Culp, he won't let us down."
WHEN I POSTED I WAS BACK IN AT 11:20 I TOLD YOU IT WAS GOING HIRE. I WAS RIGHT. I AM ALWAYS RIGHT. AND I AM HERE TO TELL YOU IT WILL BE 13 BY NEXT ER AT LEAST. I HAVE 5000 SHARES AND AM ALWAYS SMILING. IVE MADE MORE THAN 20 GRAND GOING LONG ON THIS SINCE 7. THIS LEADS ME TO BELIEVE SHORTS ARE DESPERATE AND BROKE.
"So what changed since Tuesday? Oppenheimer going to neutral because the stock hit their price level, and Tusa reiterating his $5 target? Nonsense. Purely HFT's playing games. Buy."
GREAT YEAR OF THE CULP
US stock market is very overvalued. The bull market seems running out of strength. We may see a big correction in near future. Prepare to accumulate more GE when it dropped together with the market. GE is the only stock I like to buy in today’s overvalued market.
when that 13 breaks H to pay
If GE can break 13.24 we could retest 15.01.
"Buy and go watch tv boys. $Nok $GE $AMC $BB $BBBY, $GME was just the first stop."
Pay attention..... tmrw Georgia election will determine if this market finally collapses. If these 2 radical socialists win tomorrow the market’s will begin a slow and long market collapse. Watch and learn.
"What GE really needs to do to accelerate its growth rate and strengthen its technology leadership in the entire tech sector is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for GE (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if GE just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

final chance to load on the cheap. GE will be 15 by the time they execute the RS this would translate to $120 post RS. in 2 - 3 years GE stock will be in 300-400 range. time will tell and do your own DD.
"While NASA revised its timeline for the X-59 Quiet SuperSonic Technology (QueSST) demonstrator to reflect anticipated first flight in 2022, the agency remains encouraged that construction of the X-plane had reached the halfway point by late last year despite complexities associated with the pandemic.In a recent update, the agency said assembly of the Mach 1.4 aircraft “made great strides” in 2020 as work progressed on the flight deck, wings, and other hardware. In addition, GE Aviation delivered the F414-GE-100 engine that will power the X-59 QueSST in the third quarter. Program partner Lockheed Martin is assembling the aircraft at its Skunk Works facility in Palmdale, California, under a $247.5 million NASA contract."
"Mr Culp is doing it right n the street is starting to see the benefits...couple that with the new round of stimulus helping the airlines, that will only help propel GE..think of where they were pre Mr Culp n.where their FCF is now...look forward another two years n think about where he will take GE...my educated guess is FCF of $7 to $9B n a stock price of $50!!! Yes, almost a 400% increase...mark this post!!"
I’m looking to invest . New to stocks . Wondering if ge is a good stock to start investing in ?
Has JJ left the building and removed all his posts??
Just need the jitter hands to sell their shares to the bullish guys....after this is done...then we March toward the $17 PT!
"Going to enjoy watching the negative analysts spin this one: ""Hate it at $6...Love it at $12"""
"Solid price gain and performance...........At this rate, it can just keep climbing. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"
Obviously some investors want to cover cheap...80 million shares short. Will be costly when price goes up !!
The only buyers today will be shorts to cover.
I’m selling all my $INO and buying $GE they making news robot
"Why do companies do investor days? At best 50% of them result in the stock going up. Usually, those are the stocks that analysts are in love with anyways."
"GE simply followed Boeing down the toilet today - won't last - in fact the pre-earnings move up begins - Friday, Monday and then BAMMMMMMMMMM Tuesday."
What are the chances this ends green today. I think this shows some resiliency in the stock.I would be happen with even but it seems to be bouncing back well today
Buy AMC and GME and make some money
Hey... anyone know something that DOES Fly....?Yes...you got it....!Lots of planes WITH....GE engines....!!! andThe more vaccines get distributed...the more of them will take to the ....SKY... along with GE stock!!!
i'm up 20% in a month @ 11.19 cost was going to take profit but you guys talked me into holding
"In all seriousness folks, and I really mean it, I’m not kidding. I’m having difficulty understanding something, and please, I would appreciate serious answers only. Here goes. I’ve been going over a lot of information, public information, easily obtainable by those like me, willing to look. Given everything I have found, I’m coming up with a break up value of GE, somewhere in the range of $22-$24 per share. I’m curious if anyone has come up with a similar conclusion? I can’t be off in my numbers by nearly half. Anyone?"
GE overpriced!!!!Do your research!!!!Let it drop to reasonable price.
GE is overvalued by minimum 40% and expect it to fall by 75% to $4.
"tomorrow is the dayge / culp where we are, where we are goingfacts will determine share value"
To all board members. GE will be a junk stock if this reversal goes through. Mark my words.
When this market finally crashes after this 12 year bull market.. it will take everything with it including GE
Literally GE is a getting back to be a great company what would come out better for them is if they can find a way to make renewables more profitable for them
"I can see the PUMPERS coming out in force. It's not going to do any good. GE misses 4Q and down we go back to single digits. Take a short position now to cover your losses. Culp is not the great CEO that PUMPERS have been claiming. Larry is lining his pockets, just like past GE CEOs."
the squeeze is coming
Brilliant by GE. My hats off to them for thinking outside of the box. Short term loss (one day) for long term gain. Brilliant !!!!!.
"Every post on this board that is positive about an I'll give you 1 share for every 8 you buy is a fraud, don't bet on it. This news is 100% bad!"
GE sp is depressed by the covid. The current administration will do whatever it takes to have many people vaccinated. Covid will be quelled fast and GE will fly.
"That volume this morning, omg"
Zack gives GE a strong buy rating
"G.E. ""they bring good things to me"""
15 after hours
BUY SIGNAL NOW !!!. For GE_to_4 Time for you to learn something !!!.
Reverse Splits are always the Kiss of Death for the retail investors.
GE is awesome baby. $UWMC clearly positioned for near term gains.
"Culp definitely goofed up here. Clearly doesn't understand the market.250m share traded today. Of course he wanted that volume after analysts day. But talk about losing investors billions. As well as employees.No reason why this won't drop another dollar tomorrow.The reverse split is scaring investors away. Everyone is thinking.....I don't want 1/8th of number of shares I currently own! I know from the standpoint of earnings divided by diluted shared count, it makes no difference, but its the perception. If the stock continues to drop lower and reaches $5..you can bet institutions will dump this.Colossal failure by Culp with regards to investors."
Immelt missteps now a thing of the past thanks to Culp. Go man go.
They Split OR NOT Guys take advntage of this pull back. You will never see GEE at this price. Going Forward Infra will be a BIGGGIE GE has a big Presence everywhere not like Techs who can evaporate in few days.
GE Board could be in Washington. Similar bad judgment.
"GE Healthcare Named ""2020 Global Company of the Year"" by Frost & Sullivan for its AI-based Command Centers that Help Hospitals Make Real-time Decisions That Improve Care Delivery"
GE will going up much higher
another day and another ge negative like a broken record.
Time to buy some JAN 29 $12 call options?
Shorts covering at 15 I love it
JJ . Maybe you have a chance to short more @ 13.50 . Who knows?
Almost 2% drop with 25% of the average daily volume!Who is RIGGING this share price?
GE will be $50 stock again in he next few years. Hold on tight.
"No reason to lie about anything! I'm a dividend man and I don't deny it. ENB brought in $3000 dividend alone into my piggy bank last year. Now! A good comparison - (1) share of DUK provides $3.68 per year whereas 368 shares of GE provides the same value. My 10000 shares of DUK provides a nice yearly income from my Roth IRA which the qualified distribution is not affected by taxes at all.If I depended on my dividend from GE, I would be homeless and hungry. Just waiting for GE to go belly up so I'll have a nice tax write off."
GE & ACRX are both climbing pre market!!!!
buy at 10.20 - buy
GE is trading with range of split announcement as expected and will be range bound until after the split. Watch and learn.
1M premarket shares traded in 7min. Looks good for today!
"Jeff Immelt on CNBC ...... what a SCHIESTER ..... his net worth is $50,000,000 . "
hahahaahaha Tusa get ready by tomorrow morning premarket hours
GE's just getting warmed up. Buy back those shares before margin call.
"I added more like I said I would under 12. I bought at 11.96. I hope more did the same. Now people are talking about tax hikes that will affect stock market. Until the loopholes are done away with in our tax system companies will not feel any pain from increases. When it was 38%, most companies paid under 10% while the good ole working man gets screwed on taxes as usual."
GE doesn't have the kind of short interest to make a squeeze even worth speculating. It's less than 2%.
"Let’s talk facts. CNBC fill me up on stocks that reacted positively with this kind of news, the reversal just around the corner. I challenge CNBC. Show us the facts"
"such negativity.IBM had similar fits and challenges once upon a time. what if GE and IBM merged. it'll never happen. but God bless the m&a deal maker who finds a partner. oh but wait, why could it not happen? a merger that is."
What happens to the stock tomorrow?
Buying opportunity or get out?
"Chicken little, the sky is falling! Where are the doom and gloomers this AM? Hmmmmmmmm"
Ignore the naysayers. GE will be a $20 as the economy reopens!
The only stock doing well today!
GE Fundamentals Could Attract More Long-Term Investors
"How fewer shares will make more shorts. on contrary fewer shares keeps short away. Those who are not comfortable welcome to sell , AH is down 11 cents meaning not many sellers."
"Nice job GE board. How to lose 15 billion in market cap, and have investors running for the hills. A 1 for 3 reverse split with stock buybacks would be better."
"FYI: On March 4, Morgan Stanley analyst Josh Pokrzywinski said the evont could be a catalyst for shares and upped his GE stock price target by 31% to 17."
"If it was bad, big fund would be dumping...."
AM SURE SOME BIG BOYS TURN BEARISH KNOWS LOOK AT THE VOLUMN HEHEHEH E
This is holding up nicely in a down market!
GE 10s coming tomorrow. OMG!
"C is trying to scam you. Over and over the same post. Upside to a RS? ya right. It is a desperation move by GE and everyone else knows it. Why desperate? Because they are still in deep trouble. The RS proves it. Deal in facts, not conjecture"
If you have owned this stock for years you lost the biggest opportunity in a lifetime to make serious money with so many other stocks... most are trading in the 300.00 range. You are only wishing and guessing for GE to make any meaningful move higher. Basically it’s to late in the game with a beat market looming.
"If you think is gonna go higher, you don't know split. GE will trade flat until the hopefuls get frustrated and then it plunges."
RS might not get approved or they could rescind that statement. Nothing else has changed since Tuesday. Stock will start to head back up and make new highs. They are a definite real opening stock.
Interesting article on the Haliade-X wind turbines by $GE in the NY Times last week. These monsters will be coming to our ocean shores this year. Vineyard wind project will ‘only’ be 800MW but we will start seeing multiple GW farms globally this year/decade. $FAN
$47M reward for taking the stock down from $10 to $6 and back up to $10. Nice.
Nothing but daily noise. GE is in all the right businesses for this administration and the grand reopening. Check back in Jan 2022
GME up another +90% pre market...... but I own this garbage called GE
So far do we have reverse split? Thanks.
"My target price for JPM is 20.00, they have to much debt and to many lawsuits."
"Mr. H. Lawrence Culp Jr. promised $32.31 a share by October 31, 2023. If he succeeds he stands to make ( I believe it was something like a $280 million bonus.) That's one hell of a incentive!4"
$12 and above soon!
"50% of all wind turbines in W. Texas frozen solid when needed the most. GE.....we bring good things to life.Sold my stock years, years ago"
This is a train wreck
Reverse split ended the golden goose.
"I hope the stock pulls back for a couple days, maybe back down as far as 11.60. If it keeps going up, we might lose JJ forever "
Soon will come out with a PR to stop or slow the bleeding.
"Kevin, maybe I misunderstood Cramer. I thought he said it could go to $50.00/share. Is that what he said? If not please clarify what he said.Thanks"

Wow...there are a lot of people on here that are off their meds and have way too much time on their hands. Who has time for multiple posting in an hour? That's a special kinda crazy.
Can’t wait for more wind deals and for aviation to open up.
Funny how the Culprit changes the game as he see fit. This is a dead company.
Here comes the daily slide !!! Announce that you won’t do the rs and save this
ok ok million times the RS is bad...... so now what ??? tomorrow pre market buy?? would you. I probably will .
Instead of cost optimization: let’s nail the shorties ! It’s time !!! Go ahead GE !!
I just called GE investor relations at +1 617 443 3400 and voiced my concerns. Call the and let them know how you feel about them boxing you out of the future growth in GE with this 1 for 8 reverse split!!Reverse the decision to a reverse split!!
"Your going to get some upside after this, then get out....."
"Boeing collecting orders, 1.3m travelers yesterday and gov giving airliners 15B. Seems at least GE aviation should kill it in future rev."
I was just doing research for electric car drive systems and GE came up as one. So when I heard the reverse split news Thought I would check in on conversations. Anyone know of their situation in the electric auto drive motor manufacturing? May be a positive to think about because I'm always looking at angles for future tech needs. I already checked on the chip side and ON semi is that play.
"high volume of shorts and puts indicate that most are bearish for tomorrow's earnings....The stock has not moved a bit while market and other stocks sky rocketed....we keep our fingers' crossed folks....after 3 months of waiting, Mr. Culp need to deliver bigger than the 3rd quarters. GOOD LUCK TO ALL"
"I am still holding my prediction of $16 by March, I am still expecting some amazing news, I am still thinking our friend from Omaha is coming back !!!"
"We all should expect short sellers rushing covering they positions on Monday. Told you, they'll have a lot of sleepless nights in 2019 year. I hope they didn't use margin to short GE lol"
Why is this terd going down? @Nasir low life any idea? Ask your help @Lisa.
"Fortunately for GE, the Boeing 777 engine that blew up was a Pratt & Whitney."
"So literally nothing changed today except Tusa, who has consistently been wrong the last 4 months, said that GE would miss. Didn’t he say that last quarter just before earnings too?"
At least it's not red.......
Who said something about a reverse split?
ge to 20 by end of day
I'm out!
"The reason that stocks are ‘overvalued’ is that they are getting scarcer, more & more people invest."
MMs cleaning up Jan 15 Leap Call Options.. Buy Jan 15 Put options for strike price $10..
Could GE start a rally of days in the greenI would love to see it climb over the next few weeks
"Wow, reverse split is a big mistake, look at C after their RS."
"GE RENEWABLE Growth story, GE Aviation headed back to $30Bn rev $10Bn profit, but JPM P!GS are the problem for GE Stock price, under MANIPULATION still.. Even FORD UP 200% from March Lows, GE NOOOT even up 100% from March and 2008 Lows of $6.66"
Did we clear the board members who supported Immelts Pillage? Or are you letting the same baboons approve spending?
Looks like it will hit 12 premarket
How many shares of GE are you currently holding?
"gene nice update I've been sitting on GE 1000 shares I bought back around Dec. 7th 20, and have locked it in a vault, and will look at it 6 months form now, what a great stock."
The report was positive and looks like GE will be up 3%. Patience pays.
$12... now the Algo AI will take over :)
"Is anyone planning to buy Jeffry Immelt's book just published? A short synopsis is in today's news. As hard as he tried during his 18 year tenure, he couldn't get the GE share price down to $4. I don't think our present CEO can do that either. Bring back another Jack Welch PHD (bless his soul) to move share price."
buy FORD. winnee
OMO's You think they are buying GE? I'd think so.What are OMO's you ask?Open market operations (OMOs)--the purchase and sale of securities in the open market by a central bank--are a key tool used by the Federal Reserve in the implementation of monetary policy. The short-term objective for open market operations is specified by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). OMOs are conducted by the Trading Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The range of securities that the Federal Reserve is authorized to purchase and sell is relatively limited. The authority to conduct OMOs is found in section 14 of the Federal Reserve Act.
"what i see, analysts raising / reducing tp by 1 dollaron average assuming 13/14 by the end of the yearbased on expected ge performanceinvestors and ge share value were too far ahead of actual ge numbersi dont like rs either, a surprise but not the only reason for the pullbackits the investors decision whether this outlook works for the individual"
"Sold all today took the $ 4,800 PROFIT. wanted to stay long until they stated talking RS..my experience with (rs ) usually turns out bad... Had to move on...Good luck."
no shareholder ever wins when a reverse split happens. Just got F'd by the GE machine
PPS should go down to $ 1.65 or lower before the Reverse stock split.
"Spin it anyway you want ! Reverse splits have nothing to do with fundamentals , growth or any other positives that a company may have .They are negative psychological effects that can play havoc with an investor's mind !"
Support is 6.30get out of this one now....................................
Its a beat!
Huge earnings beat and traders are selling and taking profits on the little pop. That is how much confidence traders have in this company. Take profits whenever you can￼￼
"With GE, do not get your hopes too high. The last time it made $30, investors were promised a windfall. Meanwhile, this what has happened since then:1. Fire sell of assets and disappearance of proceeds2. Price drop form $30 to $6.66 2. Dividend cut to 10 cents 1 cent3. Need I continue.It is all about making deals and selling assets, and making promises. GE has not even recovered from the 2008 economic disaster. But let us sell all assets, have a big old reverse split and magically become like Honeywell."
I work for GE ...we are hurting. Some older guys I work with have lost from 250 to almost 500 grand.
Short start covering nowThere are some buyer showed up too
Are your long portfolio's getting punched in the head repeatedly? Oh my!!
"Good night shorties, sleep well tonight !"
So what is GE's upside with power and aviation about to explode? Buy with impunity.
Panic sell end at 6pm. After that just bullish.
Have you smart pants wondered how the market tanked just when the stimulus package was about to be issued. The American government just stole our money to issue to the Americans to help with their economy recovery. World power at play.
Vote No to a reverse split.
$12 End of day
"Just saw a news item saying that GE BoD is going to ask shareholders to approve a 1-8 reverse split, to bring the number of shares in line with company capitilization. That would raise share price to over $100. I don't really see the point of such a move. Does the Board think it will improve the company image, make it look stronger somehow? I know it's just arithmetic, but in my long experience reverse splits reflect weakness, not strength."
"$GE has the potential to blow past $15 like an afterthought. With all the chess pieces in play right now $200+ billion market cap this year alone in not far fetched. $GE to $24 plus this year alone with side order $GE January 2022 $25 calls please, thank you and your all welcome."
Companies that are in danger of delisting reverse split... this is the worst outcome ever for existing shareholders.. you will be chasing this stock the rest of your life to break even after a reverse split.

"I’m going to leave this right here...You should have seen the trolls jump on my posts when it dropped on earnings day. Now it’s well over the peak on earnings day and these clowns are still here pushing a short position.But when you ask them1. What position are you holding and2. How much have you made or lost or even better3. What fundamentals and or beliefs are you trading on...They simply ignore the questions I suspect because the answers are1. They are not holding a position...they are just angry they lost money on GE a long time ago or are disgruntled ex employees2. They have not lost any money because they do not currently hold a position3. They will not answer this because there is not a single fundamental pointing towards a lower price. They believe that because GE was bad 2 years ago it is still bad. And one time in history has nothing to do with nowI am trading on the following fundamentals1. FCF and profitability is dramatically improving2. The company has resolved the largest liabilities and although there are a few unresolved issues...they are not significant3. Culp has focused on and prioritized the best opportunities and executed4. Covid numbers are dramatically decreasing and travel is going to be a huge upside for GE5. Culp keeps under promising and over delivering6. Even large droves of millennial investors are recognizing the upside opportunity and are coming to the table7. Institutional investors will start jumping back in as the fundamentals continue to improve8. If the fundamentals improve, there could be a great opportunity to bring back the dividends, which would bring back investors that jumped when the dividend was cut.9. GE is well positioned for green energy and the Biden administration will be proving up companies that get on board.You know....fundamentals"
Very disappointed with reverse split!
Strong sell
yay!! let's watch it drop down below 11.... then next week tumble i to single digits... yay!!!!!! good move GE....

I hope the damn GE board is reading the market sentiment about the disaster of the reverse split announcement and abandons this unwise move. I had such high hopes for GE and then they screw up (again!)
Might be just a ploy to make the price go down to buy it cheaper then ?

"Southwest is reportedly in talks with Boeing and GE for a potentially huge 737 Max orderthat helpsflying will come back, not as quickly as hoped, we will find out cos. responses"
Today Jim Cramer said he sold all his shares of GE too early . I wondered why he never mentioned GE days before earnings release on jan 26 th . The fast money traders were absent on GE before earnings. You have to listen to what they do not talk about. They can not discuss a stock 3 days before they buy or sell ?
The first fib is $11.15 and the weekly has diverged and is way over bought. This won't be a one day sell off.
buh bye 13
The comments about Dr. Ji are simliar to those about Larry Culp at $GE last March. Now Larry is hailed as a hero for saving General Electric.
I have had GE shares for a long time with a average cost per share over $30 . I am hoping the economy will go back to normal within 2 years and I will recoup my paper lose. Good luck to m and many other who are in the same boat as I
trading tip never buy a new 52 week high on Monday Or Tuesday -- the vast majority don't hold up over the next 3 trading weeks -- don't fight the odds
Volume is insane
told u is on its way uppp... buy.buy.buy...up.up. and away.
Yesterday’s short squeeze at market opening gives a taste. Shorties:cover !!!
Not good reverse split get out.
We actually believed Culp was GE answer..
30 billion for whom? dividends for shareholders? probably bonus for the empty suits then reverse split? you you want a 100$ share price earn it
Confirmed momentum play imo. Buy.
GE Board
I sat on the fence for 3 weeks about joining (http://Fairstox.com) for their weekly picks. Big mistake. GE exploded and I completely missed out. Don’t make the same mistake I made. Join them today.
"Based on my information, I see Larry beating estimates (again) and stock moving past $13 and $15 by Q2 earnings report in April. GE is well positioned in Aviation (vaccine deployment being accelerated creating a safe travel space) releasing a huge pent up demand for vacation travel in Q3/Q4, Renewables positioned well with world's large wind turbine (Halide X) and the world embracing renewables, and COVID numbers still globally high, Healthcare pent up demand for daily surgery will explode once the vaccine brings herd immunity to our highly connected planet. If you are on the sidelines come next week, it will cost you dearly to buy in - IMHO."
"Visa, Home Depot to name a few up over 1000% in this 12 year bull market... GE has performed nothing less than pathetically. Bigger problem is this bubble market is ready to pop and it will take GE with it down the toilet."
So i've sadly been involved with many reverse split companies and the stats are mind numbingly bad. Typically they go down in price till the reverse split then continue down afterwards. You have to keep buying without looking at the dwindling account till one day the price moves decisively back up and then you can get out with your shirt still on. But only if you keep averaging down and they dont go BK. This said reverse splits are typically reserved for companies with shares below a buck and in a struggling or very competitive environment. Then or of course theres corrupt management. Example Look at FCEL energy two 1 for 12 reverse splits in the last i think 4 years. Sure it popped up to 30 per share recently now back to 16.50. If you bought 100 shares in 1992 when the company first started they were trading at 207.00 per share. You held thats 20.700 invested. Two one for twelve splits now you got 4.16 shares. Ill let you do the math but it over 5000 per share for you to break even. My advice is to wait till after the split and wait more till after it tanks further then consider a long position or avoid this issue all together.If you have strong conviction just make sure you keep adding if your in love here. Full disclosure I hold no position in GE and after this blunder would only play the volatility through options. I took the time to to post this because of my experience with reverse splits. For a time it seemed like I was cursed and every stock I bought would would announce a reverse split then go bankrupt. Most recent example CHK a 1 for 200 RS. Yeah I was in that one to.I hope all make money here.Cheers
Citadel buying shares for their inventory as a major Market Maker. Will sell the inventory to retail investors at a later date. The hearings last week were most informative.
Tusa is quite because he got nothing to say.. JPM is still pumping EV stocks ..Watch GE and GM on this front pretty soon !!!!
Hind sight is 20/20. Six months ago you could have gotten GE for about $6. Would have made a tidy little profit.
Could this stock be shorted too? lol...... Please?
"My best guess is that GE will close tomorrow near $11.30 (up 5%). This ""best guess"" is based how the stock jumped the first day of the year in 2019 and 2020. Good luck to all us GE longs in 2021."
This will get uglyReverse stock split means something wrongBig mistake by Culp.
Literally this move makes no sense. Selling Aircraft leasing business sure ok I understand that but the reverse split makes 0 sense. Day trading is a thing whether GE likes it or not every company from GE all the way to APPL and MSFT experience it
"There are more than 60000 contracts open positions at strike price $12 this Friday. It means many people thought it will close above $12. Well, it looks like market makers want all of them expired worthless. They want GE to be close between $11.5 to $12 this Friday. Thus, don’t bid on short term options. They could let It move above $12 by next Friday if they manipulated."
Larry will be on Bloomberg at 12 noon.
Tusa set this up so nicely. He’s only good for about a $.10 to $.15 drop with his hit pieces. He made $10.50 calls cheap. Jan 15 is all you need
my interpretation of ge's gain and approval of share holders …today ……….culps action of prioritizing and redirecting goals for the future of ge ......
Good move board !!!! I guess you dont like your share price over 9
"There’s a good Reuters article summarizing expectations tomorrow. My post, with link was tossed. Sorry, in summary. Crazy good news...Payments for engines upon delivery!"
"Another bombshell from GE. As expected, legal corruption at its best."
Goldman Sachs raising the price target on GE to $15.00 extends the runway. I expect a pretty straight shot to $14.25. Clear Skies. V shaped recovery.
Buy the dip.. umm the dip... umm the dip.... and so on.. and on.. and on.. The only way this moves up is when they admit they are wrong and reverse their decision to do a reverse split...Nobody wants it! Do a buy back!! No to 1 for 8 reverse split!!!!
Wait until it retreats back to the nines.
"GE CASH & LIQUIDITY $$100+ BILLION ($40+ BILLION CASH in USA+ $30Bn abroad+ $$25 BILLION Line of credit UNTOUCHED)..GE PAID OFF near $$70 BILLION debt/pension.. GE SPENT $$120 BILLION DISPOSABLE CASH in buying back stock, paying debt, LTC, pension, and set aside other things.. GE IS A CASH MACHINE.. At this rate GE CASH FLOW Will be $$$20 BILLION"
Every state in this country is wondering what would happen to their power grid if they were faced with a Texas like crisis . Guess who they are calling to inspect and improve their grids! GE !!!
Finally broke $12
cool.. -20% in 2 days
General Electric Aviation awarded $111M contract for support of CH-53K
"I think everyone owes a debt of gratitude to Mr. Tusa. With his guidance, GE's stock price was held down long enough to give insightful investors time to get on board at a cheap price."
Go ahead. I'll just buy more. I don't need this money for many years.
"Get out now this is heading back to the $5.00 range, right where it was before the retail investors bailed this company out of bankruptcy!"
Unfortunately somebody already wants to sell 100000 shares at 10.86
10.30 - 10.50 then run up for quarterly financials. Market makers rule when there is no news
"It won’t be until after mid year that this re-establishes a positive P/E due to Q2 2020 kitchen sink.It also will likely get hit hard when the market decides to correct in the next few months or so.However, as long as Larry Culp is at the helm and no other negative macro surprises, I see this as a stealth grower into end of year. Over 100% from this sub $12 price would not surprise me."
"Market elasticity defines the wave forms from which natural stock price distributions are derived, and from this, a probabilistic determination can be surmised that there is a greater likelihood of equal and opposite market energy from hyperbolic to parabolic. Simply put, this is will go down."
Hi all. Why doesn't GE pay a dividend anymore?
"GE waiting to cross the $100B market cap.......heading for the price of $13.26 and a $130B market cap, the level it was prior to the PANDEMIC....................we shall see it cross that level and head towards the $150 Billion CAP very soon..............................target price for that would be $15.55............................. well done Mr CULP...shame on some jack #$%$ analysts who caused pain and suffering for thousands of investors...GE would have been above $20 by now if it was not because of their deliberate and intentional misguiding comments and analysis....."
bought 2000@12.23; no one every lost any money ever underestimating the lack of my intelligence of the American public!
"Bloomberg just announced that GE now has over half (50%) of the US wind turbine business in 2020.Only Vestas is anywhere near them at 31% in the US wind turbine sales and capacity in 2020.In the offshore wind turbine business GE is definitely already the big winner and jetting ahead in sales and customers. GE has upcoming huge profits of scale. Going forward it has made GE a ""must own"" stock for a lot of index portfolio managers as of today onward.It is the dominant recyclable and environmental stock. GE now has as much appeal as Tesla has - but more going for it in size, diversity, profitability, and overall an awesome well situated company worldwide.It is a dominant industrial manufacturer with plants in over 80 countries and 160,000 employees worldwide..The $20 a share price tag is now low for the year. The stock can easily move a lot more distance.That is why the stock is rocketing upward to new heights....Nobody left to catch GE in the wind turbine business and this ill be the second area GE is dominant in, after aviation."
anyone here know what time earnings will be?
"GE has been deeply engaged in China to help upgrade the local industrial chain with ""intelligent manufacturing""."
"We may see a huge market drop next week. Two important dates ( Jan 05 & Jan 06) will be key to the political, future policy decisions in the country... For the next 4 years , if not for much longer. Georgia runoff & Electoral College vote count. Market is likely to have a big jolt..GE could also go down with the market, if there is a huge sell off.Similar to 2000, market could be preparing for a big sell off in January."
Very week stock. Showing no strength at all. Looks abandoned. 10's tomorrow breaking the trend.
Sell the news.... Earnings are already baked in. High likelihood of earnings sell off Tuesday.
yes I sold took a profit now I'll buy back when the smoke settles
50 million shares in 22 minutes!
Is Immelt now for the CCP?
Only Jack Welsh PHD (bless his soul) could get the GE share price to $4. After doing so in the 1980's he got it back to $60 during his 20 year tenure. Must be his PHD mentality that did the trick. Send Mr. Culp back to school. I think GE would cover tuition. They paid mine years ago. Thanks GE.
They sound panicked!! heading to $5.00!!! Sick 1 for 8 reverse split!!
Tusa Upgrade round the corner?
great stock time for us to pad our portfolios. buy
"Don't forget that Tusa is called a genius and is broadly loved for his GE analysis. At least he is very professional in analytics and finance and GE. It is very strange that GE went so high, but soon it us all over and GE will be $5."
"If you go back to December 10th (roughly $11.44/share) and take the trend from that point to today and invert the trend, GE would be roughly at $12.32. So, without manipulation, its plausible that we could easily be hovering in the 12's. Don't be surprised if GE shoots up and basically bypasses the 11's to play catch-up."
GE on the verge of a potential obesity breakthrough using ultrasound(Google IT)That would be significant given that obesity is the nation's largest health issue
"Maybe the GE innovation center can put some electric engineers on the EV craze. Would be nice to have them get a few patents on improved and evolving technology. After all, doesn't GE stand for General ELECTRIC?"
new into investing wanting advise should I hold or sell bought at 12.28
"Just shaking out all the weak retail holders and back up it will go. Hard to imagine retail buying GME with little value now at over 100.00 and the thought of buying this at a similar price seen as bad. Oh well, you lose"
The Holy S#&$? moment for shorts has arrived! 
1-8 reverse stock split ? really now
Don't look now but GE is trending on Reddit.... it seems that some believe that GE could be pushed to the same heights as GME.... Is it possible tomorrow will show a big upside... the Reddit Herd seems to think so...
hey JJ.....show us your confirm on the trade.
"GE literally owns CNBS, could go on air right now and stop the bleeding. But the wont because they are Egotistical, greedy, Ivy league, insider trading Frauds!!! Retail investors pulled them out of Bankruptcy, and they repay their loyalty by reducing there invested interest by 1/8th. Reverse the Reverse split decision!!!"
Yahoo sensors free speech
Scotty we need more volume
"Volume coming in this morning. Technical indicator RSI is rising and in the bullish zone with the MACD also moving higher, according to stoxline. Looking for breakout at 15.05 for a run up to 17.58."
Breakout to new 52 wk high not too far off...
GE earnings this Tuesday lift off... I'm expecting good numbers and expecting a turn around story.
"Culp is cleaning up the balance sheet. Don't think we'll see great movement in the short term, but this is long term play. Won't move until divi is increased.But hopefully that won't happen until after the balance improves materially."
Because I’m happy! 
I was right good short
New ballgame if we close over $12.
OVER SOLD!!!
My only stock doing well today. Let’s go my little beaut.
"GE is a golden egg for holders. People are chasing BLNK for EV charging units. I don't know if holders are aware of the capabilities that GE has already. You can almost bet that you will find GE ""s name on the plugs and receptacles used by alot of the end users! GE is a treasure for sure. IMO"
GE is saving millions and millions with the elderly dying from Covid because now the pensions stop and long term care is discontinued........................
great news
"Amazing how AER is paying GE, GE is falling and AER is rising...."
Sorry.....82 billion in debt....employee pension plan deficits....cannot buy this. Too many other opportunities out there.
I got a feeling this thing is going to blow up. Its been held back for too long.
Uncle Joe is more concerned with making illegals legal than Americans in our country.
"Like I said, a close over $12 was bliss. Buy."
Surprise after hours???
Robinhood Investors will be back to GE in a few days......when they finish their Walk-a-bout. We should welcome them back.
Another beautiful Friday sell off... Any Questions? Flush the GE toilet..
"JPM-Tusa is looking like a very stable Genius, once again."
Lving this move. straight to 12 dollar by end of today or tomorrow.
"Whatever the numbers are, it will fall."
"The premarket volume is the highest it has been in two weeks. If today’s volume mirrors that, on an up day, GE could make a nice run today."
Money flowing back to tech today.
walstreetbets coming to GE?
There are a few Analysts at Apple that have rated Apple a strong sell for the last 5 years.......as Apple has gone up 800%. They will never give up. :-)
hey I just joined investing does looking for advise should I sell or hold bought at 1.28
The Reverse split is really messing with this stock.
GE can see 14.20+ this week and 20+ is just around the corner with all the great news and the 1.9 trillions is approved over the weekend.
"GE won over F in race to reach the $10 pps level, now they are in race to reach the $14......with tons of good news regarding both companies which one would win this time ?"
I hope JJ makes enough money to get a decent car soon. That 2006 Toyota with the Obama ‘08 bumper sticker is falling apart.
bought april puts on thisliterally free money
is it true that GE will be in the list of wall street bets? ( Reddit)
"BTW: That was a rhetorical question... Bottom line, Longs made a bundle today, earn a dividend in two days as a bonus AND didn't need to trade 1 share to boot!"
does ge involved in nuclear smaller reactors nuclear power? looks like nuclear power must be used to go green. 4 months of each year solar and wind won't work especially during the night.
Some of you guys act like everything else is perfect in the World. You really need to look seriously at all the uncertainty.
I will stay long GE but I put alot of $$ into Ford. it's about time that company bring that SP up. go Ford baby!! get in before 20s
"Tomorrow is may be make or break. And by break I mean. GE acting like other stocks. I have a tiny position in this but if this rally’s, it’ll be a huge play."
What is Tusa's PT now?
Up over 5% for the week! Nice job GE!!
"good point, Don't you think this is already priced in."
RAD is one reverse split that got really screwed . 23 billion in revenue 1.2 billion market cap. Short squeeze in progress.
JJ uses all his brain cells to watch and make a nickel on one stock while the rest of us quietly make a penny on 15 or 20 stocks in a diversified long portfolio. Lol
Anyone who is short must be having nightmares!
"Oh no, the stock dropped 3%, let me just sit happy with my 90% I've been riding, ohhh noooo."
GE crossed the $11.62 and headed for the $12 border...new high and higher high.....as said before hopefully this is an indication of a positive trend for the stock and a good descent earning report. Never know GE may surprise investor yet with another achievement this past quarter.....GOOD LUCK to ALL............GE is way behind compare to many other companies thanks to some self center analyst who has gone against all others who say otherwise
"UBS thinks $15, but I think higher. All of their components are revving up even Baker Hughes. $20 is my initial pt."
"Goodbye shorts. Game, set and MATCH!"
2.4% drop with 33 million shares (1/3 rd of the daily volume) traded so far. Rigged Casino!
Going close to 20 today at close
Now all there is to do is enjoy the ride.
I lost about $3000 from GE but I can see that it is going up gain. It is okay now.
Huge Opportunity to buy and hold.. Big Earning Surprise.. GE to $16 bucks soon !!!!Be Long Or Be Wrong !!
"That was fun while it lasted. Clear out of the way, she's rolling back down the mountain."
GE POPPING UP
dividend hike is comming
"is not the jet engine, because travel still restricted. but GE is big, other areas they also make cash, the problems is too many shares out and no dividends (that cut many out of the buy) and too big debts, and not in the Wall street list, however with a good management, I think it will come back in few years, may be 15/20 per share, GE is for LONG but by than USD may collpased."
Never buy or sell a stock based on what an analyst says.
I got the option june 18 15$ 65 lots positives

Hats off to Buffet for bailing at $25 per share. A man with foresight.
"Pokrzywinski analist Morgan Stanley:""We believe the March 10 outlook is a catalyst and it sets up a multiyear path to above-consensus FCF of ~$0.90 (per share) in 2023 with solid growth in the core businesses further beyond,"" the analyst said. For 2021, he estimates industrial FCF of 48 cents per share.That ain't bad folks."

"what a Love for GE, I loved it since $6 and will love it till $30. Great company with bright future."
Come on now! We can get there! The first 100 days so far has created a trend upward. We can get the national debt to 22 trillion if we all work together and do our part.

WHERE IS TUSA $5 CLOWN AND HIS MINIONS LIKE JJ N MORE
"I have to admit stock trading is a little irrational at times. If person has ten ten dollar bills and they being asked to exchange their 10 tens for a 100 dollar bill, the traders will get upset and devalue their current holdings because they don't want that 100 dollar bill. They rather end up with 90 or even 80 dollars than the full 100 dollars out of protest of getting a 100 dollar bill. I don't understand the mentality but it is what it is."
"PE of 32 is way high, it was always trading at 16 or lower, and hence the fall to $4 will occur soon."
sell sell sell sell. after reverse splits. value drop again in long terms then you lose money.
"For what it’s worth, Morgan Stanley raises GE PT to $13 from $12; maintains Overweight view. We’ll see. GLTA involved."
1644 ET - Falling commercial jetliner and engine sales accounted for almost a quarter of the drop in all US goods exports and more than half that in capital goods last year. The latest Commerce Department update highlights the impact of falling Boeing deliveries and shipments of GE engines on the broader economy. Aircraft exports fell $27.4B and aircraft engines dropped $18.4B . Aerospace imports declined almost $18B from a year earlier.
"spin off is only reason at this price, culp is a great ceo, previously at danaher... tKe a look at performance during his tenure. one year out, total value after split wk be $20+"
GE’s breakup value is probably $34 per share. Somebody’s going to start talking about it.
Bought a couple call Jan 2022 15 strike
The magnitude of the drop yesterday and today is unwarranted. I think some are loading up on cheap shares/calls in anticipation of a possible upgrade out later today or before market open tomorrow.
wildly over bought every indicator is saying sell off this week should finish the week below 12.50 cycle high has been reached for the month-- best if it opened at 12.71 or 12.72 that would generate max pain for the balance of the week -- Monday is a new month see where it goes after this weeks pain trade
A new day and another loosing GE day..
"What the F'! After 11 down days, we had a $0.15 upday for a change yesterday.. That gain is being wiped out ! MMs in total control Rigging the share price & volume..."

enjoy the upside today while u can hweheehehehe WHILE WE SHORT TODAY SINCE ITS GOING UP -- HEHEHEHE IT WILL GO BACK DOWN TO $12.50 N WE CAN COVER OUR SHORT HEHEHE MAKE MONEY THAT WAY.. REVERSE SPLIT AINT GOING TO PUSH THIS HIGHER.... BIG GUYS HATE REVERSE SPLIT .. THEY RATHER WAIT N SEE AFTER REVERSE
"from a technical aspect , the 5 year chart is saying the price target is 23-26 ,,, this is the true target price but ''' talking heads'' on tv are gutless .. sometimes technicals are the only indicator ,, use the '' kiss theory """" trust the science ,, sorry the devil made me say that"
20dollars in a week or 2
It will be exciting to see for a change that GE would hold its 50 cents gain today...Its daily patter suggests it won't..but lets hope it can.........Best of LUCK to all longs
big mistake with the reverse split all you have to do is look at citigroup hasn't done hardly anything it's been years.
Total ripoff!
I love you GE 
Good Day to All GE Investors! :):):)

NOTE: The government is not spend happy! Bernie has direction and insight. Hold out and you'll be working for $15.00 per hour by the Fall of 2021.
I'm looking forward to increased revenue from the GE energy and medical units. The positive cash flow should help offset GE's balance sheet while the Aviation unit recovers. Steady upward growth should will continue with proper management from Culp.
Why some poster put there nose in other affairs please mind your own business Stick to just Ge please try not to be a school teacher
hang in there with GE. GE could easily be the next Reddit target for killing off hedge fund shorties and all their little Tusa minions. Gen Z'ers love this stock on RH so hang on for a potential upward ride sometime in the near future. Just my prediction.
"most stocks as of late that buffet buys heads south, kr or gold are two."
MR. CULP IS THE NEW JACK WELCH OF GE....BELIEVE IT OR NOT GE TO GET BACK TO THE $60 LEVEL WITHIN A COUPLE OF YEARS AGAIN................THANK YOU FOR THAT
i feel i let my shares go to soon. was just 100 but nice to see how they're turning it around... May try and buy back in on some weakness
"Without earthquakes, California will be the most desirable place to live. Earthquake only come around every 30 to 100 years. Hurricanes and snow storms come every year. This is why California is where humans want to live."
$45 billion in cash with CULP sitting at the poker table of acquisitions GE stock $25 a no brainer
"Seems GE shares tanked when Culp took over as well as the dividend. I recall he had a $20 something million dollar bonus last year for the stock stay in a range of $10-$13/ps, after the bonus it tanked again. Year 2 looks the same to me except his bonus is up to $40 million plus. It would be nice to see the quarterly dividend exceed $0.01/per share. Maybe if they bought some stock back the share price might go up?"
GE is much better now than a year ago. . it was trading at $13. So anything north of 13 is a fair ptice.
14 of last 15 sessions ge down last 10 minutes of trading day on less than 45% the normal average shares traded per day. it closes always lower than intra day trading unlike a company we are all used to following. this thing flat out stinks of corruption and manipulation. even with good earnings will get beat down below $9 a share. Tusa and his JP Morgan folks pulling strings to let this pig bleed to death.
"Waiting patiently, but growing impatient. What going on with this SP? Should be $15 by now."

"I was in a leveraged ETF that did a 1/10 RS late last year to put it in triple digits, and of course I sold. But recently looked at stock and it seems they did another RS to put it back in two digits. Is that type of move advantageous to a company?"
Was GE to be sold to China??
"You may not know this, but the 737 Max with GE Engines is the most efficient and profitable plane any airline can fly. For many airlines, the Max will be the difference between making a to of money, or losing a lot of money. Many airlines will do what UAL did today."
Oh man Tusa the Loosa said We were wrong he up grade Ge
we had a nice rally going!
Looks like we are programmed to open with a bounce of 1 penny!
"Interestingly, GE is EXACTLY the same price right now - $10.85 - that it was when Larry took over!"
JJ shorted 5000 at 11.95 and 5000 at 11.92. He is losing and trying to make up for his loses. He took down that post when he shorted a lower stock prices. Thanks JJ for educating me on how to NOT lose money.
"Listen short and day traders 4.4 billion FCG in fourth quarter , if Aviation move 2021 Ge will have 6 to 8 billion FcF in 2021 Please do not bet against Larry"

GE’s breakup value is probably over $35 per share. GE will be hitting on al cylinders for the next two years. The stock will double from here.
wow fast market up or down
This is going to GAP up. All aboard!
"Two or three years ago, GE's stock price would have tanked on the news that JPMorgan set a price-target of $5. Today, the stock is having its best day in a month."
This will hover around at this level until the split and then nose dive again after the split which is very common..
"A tear ago GE was trading at $13 range, now is in a better position financially... 13 after earnings is within range"
Headed back to single digits. Vwry disappointed in Larry.
If you look at the many other stocks you will see a broad selloff everywhere as the market is down 600 points.A lot of hedge funds are selling because of margin calls...This is a very normal thing in a down day and has zero to do with General Electric.It will rise in a better market.
soaring
heading to $17 and then $20
Now ask yourself:who would you trust to run GE: the clowns on that board or a guy like Larry Culp.This guy knows what he is doing. I wouldn't let the clowns on this board run a pet shop. Don't panic and be patient. Everything will be fine.
"Although the earnigs tomorrow and the day after may be great for the AMAZON and Chipole, after their move GE may move higher, but by the end of next Friday no this friday GE will see 10.80. Anyway there is resistance at 11.33 to 11.43. In the next few days KUKR which shared earlier could make a move from $1.26 to $1.5. Back ip the truck."
GE is going to do a R/S there goes your dividend after the split this will sink like lead on water
CNBC today crazy off the charts pumping -- the Fed and CNBC have a perfect record of never seeing or calling a bear market -- according to both they never see it coming
My math of the value of that division of GE vs the the total vale of GE with and without it comes to about $1.50 drop in their stock price from $14.00 dollars. That making it $12.50 of course. But then you have to figure in the money they are getting payed for the sale which makes it more than likely somewhere right here.
Not doing a thing
The smartest short now is the one that covers the soonest. 
Here comes inflation. Seems BofA thinks that would be good for GE. uh huh
Needs to test the neckline of the H&S pattern next. mid 10's
GE is still my favorite bottom fishing stock for 2021. I think they are on the crab........and closing in on the Honey Hole.
This could trade 500million shares today and drop big!!! Reverse the decision to a reverse split!!
RevSplit will prevent it from becoming short squeezed like that other company we've been reading about lately.

Adding to my position.Buying more GPK too.
Loading up and hoping for a big run up this year and into 2022
"My opinion is that it will take a steady climb in travel industry for GE to climb into mid-teen share price, and that will not happen until year-end....and into 2022 as vaccine and possibly secondary booster shots (COVID-19 variants) are administered at a global level. A further boost will come from Canada/US clean energy government funding, which GE renewables/GE Energy will benefit from.I am long and willing to wait another 12 -18 months...patience will be paid...don't care about day-trading."
GO GE!!!!shorts: AMC 42% / VXRT 30% / PLUG 14% / NGA 4%
It is difficult for the market to ralley with the TNX moving to 10.93. Expect the FED to adress this issue on Monday for this ralley at the biginning of the month to manifest. My plan did not pand out as I expexted yet I remain positive that I will bexabkecto buy GE at a net cist of 10.30 by next friday if the 40 puts that I sold at 21 cents are excercide if not I will keep that money. Just a way for me to manage or define risk. Only 81 stocks move higher out of 600 at this time and the VIX is at 32.13 it was at 22 one yhe down turn started back Wednessday. I will doect a ralkey next week. I hope this not the buble wich I espect to burst some time in at thecend of February.

"The big money got in below $8.00 per share. This is just a short 3-4% pull back off the high. Once this is over, look for the stock to quickly move into $14 range. (provided that the democrats don't trash the entire market...which may happen)"
"Yes, up too fast - will see."
Tusa is now 2.5x below market.#justsaying
You Robinhood people are not Sticking it to the Man by selling your GE........you’re actually handing it to the Man. The hedge funds that are taking your shares are all laughing at you from their vacation homes in the Hamptons.
600 call contracts from June to Jan 2022 and counting
Attention: This elevator is going DOWN!
Not till flying resumes GE will remain in this position. As soon as most people are vaccinated and news of travel starts to echo GE will start moving up in decent chunks of money and dollars at a time. By this summer when tourism starts GE and BA will fly and GE should be above $20 for sure. Hang in there and do your dd. Good luck
B Bands too wide for this to move up so it has a destination move under 12

Hats off to the Robinhood investors who have made GE a favorite stock pick for the last 6 months!
"The SPY will have difficulti above 381 and if it dive to 370, look out. best be all on cash before the melt down. I hope the spy clear 381 and can not imagine going down to 370.

Seeing lots of desperate posts from shorts... Stop worrying...you can stop the losses and get in on the next leg up. It doesn't have to hurt so much...just accept it.
"winning lawsuit after close on friday ,should move stock over $12.25 this week, as it was a big win, next Culp move another m&a deal where acquisition will add a good amount to bottom line"
Who has GE beating earnings?
On its way to 500mil shares and major sell off. Expect really heavy volume towards the close!!! Pooched!
GE price dropped near $11.5 again. It is time to accumulate some more shares around $11.5.
"Pay a dividend. A dime special at least, if not a permanent 0.24. C’mon man!! All that money and we get an 8/1 reverse slap?"
typical new high action- hit it early in the week then sell off to close the week out down
Ge broke through support at 12.22 and tested 12.19 and buyers came in and bought the dip. Spiked up to 12.57...just a guess someone loaded up on March 15 calls in the hopes a SW deal or some other news worthy announcement is made...just a guess. It could also be a hedge fund buying in before a news announcement?
You Dopes waited another 3 months on earnings to either lose or gain .30 cents... And your still trading lower than a year ago..
It's funny how travel and hotel stocks are rising as if people are going to have the funds to travel amidst rising inflation.
Has anyone heard of a company called OZSC they apparently just got a contract building power back up systems for NY and they are going to us TSLA battery’s to do this
Too bad the management killed the great upward momentum with an unnecessary move.
Once we break $12.00 next stop $14.00

"change of plan, will skip a day, more of the same tomorrow, options expirations. will go down at the close tomorrow and on the fisrst of February to beginning ralley at open on tuesday. the down turn at close day is not that meaningful. market opens higher tomorrow and continue with a plan once again to go down about 11 to 12 and again down on monday to rally on tuesday through thursday and then the 10% correction the rest of the month."
"everybody on this board is wrong reverse stock split is just playing bad business. bad business. can I see it can I say it over and over again bad Business by GE if this go through. if anything they should have got the share price up to 40 or $50 and split two to one what a joke I had 40,000 shares and sold last week and 30 years of trading reverse stock splits get you nowhere"
Thank you for the cheap shares. More analysts upgrading this morning. Buy.
Trading like its waiting on something. Not super understanding. If someone has any insight that’d be awesome!

They learned a long time ago, to always have the best intel."
Here comes JJI’m guessing he says he took a new short position at 13.34 and is now officially killing it lol
a good day for GE
"I AM NOT BUYING ANYMORE Stock even if good undervalued plenty, this is why. Every stock I bought last 20 years has been severely CRASHED multiple times, and SEVERELY UNDERVALUED, even currently, GIANT CROWN-JEWEL OF AMERICA GE. Why would I trust and invest more if this is how selectively they target and severely punish/deprive a little guy, even if it means hurting a giant national crown-jewel.. All I can say is, respect to the powers that are in play, who rig and control the market, ONLY PRIVILEGED, ENTITLED are rewarded, even if they are addicted gamblers.. Count the positives in life, forget the injustice, don't let it bother you.Every Aviation up 200% to 400%, yet GE with strong mountain of cash, near monopoly in their every field, high margin businesses, is severely UNDERVALUED, not even up 100% from it's 2008 lows, March lows $6.66.."
That's a nice looking 1 year chart.
Longs assemble!!!
"Is Culp planning on going short? If so this is a great plan. ""similar number of shares to similar market cap companies""? So when the market cap falls in half after this rev-split, will they do another 1 for 2 rev split?"

Analysts don't want to be left behind. Seems a plethora of upgrades. Buy.
"If you want to ""suggest"" a reverse split, then why not comment on plans for a healthy dividend that will follow the much larger share price? This is why the Board needs to be sued (class action or the like) immediately. They threw a dangerous ""suggestion"" out there with no safety net."
I don’t like the high volume yesterday. Looks like a reversal day. It was a lousy training day for the stock even though it closed higher. ￼￼
When market is red and GE shifts to green pre-market....she ain't look'n good for shorties.
S&P new highs and GE?? Like always
Stop the reverse. Get the reddit crowd to fight it.
Reverse split is a bad idea. I say no to the vote
"wow.... what is JPM/Tusa's beef with GE (reaffirmed the $5 target today)? #$%$ off his leaker is gone? No analysis can justify that against a $400bn+ backlog. .... definitely not shorting the stock, so can only be a manipulation to suck up shares."
Show me one example where a reverse split was good for stockholders.
Back to the same drip lower... GE. Rinse Wash Repeat
"GE sues Siemens in regard to stolen trade secrets causing nearly $1B liability, This should be a positive thing for GE today; however, the stock is down...wondering how is that all making sense ? GE should be up at least $1 today just on the this news alone..."
Really looking forward to the next earnings report! What is the right call option to buy for it? JAN 29 $11?
"United Airlines said on Monday that it was adding 25 planes to its order for Boeing’s 737 Max jet, bringing its total to 180 in the coming years, and that it had sped up the delivery timeline as it seeks to position itself for the expected recovery in travel."
But Tusa said ROFLMAO ! Imagine if he did not luck out with Covid and Max ?
Beware the HUGE POP after earnings!
I no longer have GE stock. SEC should look into Tusa and J.P. Morgan and make sure there trading is legal.
Lets be realistic about this stock it will be in the upper 20s within 2 years

GE is like Apple. You own it and don't trade it. GE is a staple in the US and into every facet of our lives. We need to support this company because GE is America's company. Very old money owns GE and it time to put the squeeze play on the non-believers. I'm calling my friends at Reddit...lol.. Let's see how much people are against this fine. long established company. Or would you rather own something like Game Stop....duh..no brainer here.
980k block at top of move
The catalyst for the ralley may not come until monday next week...one could be the FED lining up to provide speeches next week during tbe secion. Or GE gets a major contract like the one yesterday.

"Seems like a gift to institutional investors that told Culp they wanted to see a higher, less volatile, share price. These same institutions will be buying down here as they price drop scares out the small retail investor. For those holding options, they will all adjust with the reverse split. For me, it's good as I needed the SP to slow down so it wouldn't overrun the short end of my spread (Jun & Sep 15 strike)."
what happen if market start going down again.. after reverse split $80.. will come down to $60.. remember acb...
"hmm a lot of bearish sentiments around this stock. I actually got in today at 11.45. had to sold SOME of my BB (initial investment) and bought GE. Why? because of strong cash flow, great management and most importantly, their renewable business. This stock price to me looks like a real bargain. This isn't a ""no-name"" company, they have been around for such a long time. I also like the decisions they're making to weather the storm and amidst of all the pressure from the pandemic, they sailed through it just fine. Although a ""slight"" hit on their financials, at least they have a plan path moving forward. Invest with confidence and analyzed your thesis. Just don't succumb to negativities of other people just because they told you otherwise."
So AER is up but not GE. Time to vote no on RS and no on BOD!

"GE's stock is in accumulation and needs to break $12...then off to $15 in a hurry. Requires a catalyst to upside trend to $12.26. If it breaks @ 12.30 then the next stop is $13.26, $14.68, $17.87 plus. GE was a $55 stock at one time."

the floor has no limit on this turkey... even with reasonable quarterly won't even approach its 30 day high of $11.78.. too many shares to dilute this equity and too many large institutions willing to dump and run as soon as they can. renewable energy has no net returns for any company a lot of pixy dust and wishful thinking. every large deal announced any renewable energy partner has omitted the bottom line of: Show me the money!! never once do the stories express any added value to the earnings. WHY cause it brings no net value.
GE prime candidate for one of those Reddit short squeezes on RH. run Tusa right out of business - where he belongs IMHO! go longs go!!!!!!!
Back to the 11's really soon. Reverse split is a real kick in the teeth for longs.
"High frequency shorts now asking themselves, what did we do? Buy."
I just learned that Thomas Edison was the cofounder of GE. How awesome is that? More than a century old. Viva GE. It will eventually climb up to $60 someday in the near future. It got the back bone to get there. Strong Buy rating will start coming soon.
"11,000 mil share buy at buzzer"
"on the Peloton doing 75 miles today!!! watching ACRX cross my ticker screen, LOOK @ the ACRX Volume & Price Action (new leak on ACRX)?$KODX also coming across the screen look good!!! $GE NOT LOOKING GOOD!"
What happened to all the GE I love yous
reverse split isnt good for exisiting shareholders will buy back in when its done
"To short GE now is the same as rushing into a flaming inferno with a bucket of water....Only a total fool with a death wish would short a company as large and strong as General ElectricIt matters little if they have incredible 4th quarter earnings.Investing is a longer period than 72 hours in the stock market.Patience and clear direction will pay off.The only direction over the next 12 months for GE is up, up, and upJust like the Colonial Penn Insurance's commercial at the three most important things buying insurance are $9.95, $9.95, and $9.95"
I see $102.00 after the reverse split.
"This is a snail riding on top of a turtle . ￼￼￼￼Let’s face it , everyone benefited from the market except GE and WMT investors ."
Some folks see this going to $4 but I'm not so sure that will happen.
great to see it close above 12 at EOW.... consolidation above 12 the next milestone and then nice stead March to 20 thru 2021!
.......how about dividends.
You guys saying the proceeds of the 735m sale of Baker Hughs is headed to a rabbit hole and shareholders won't see a penny don't get what Culp is doing. He is shoring up GE's balance sheet by prioritizing debt reduction. The cash will pay off debt and yes you as a shareholder you will benefit! GE aint no SPAC fellas. You won't get rich over night. Its an investment!!!
"Reverse split puts share price at over $100 at current price. Too high in my opinion. One way or another, price will drop. That is why I sold. If it drops to $50-$60 post split or $6 -$8 presplit, I am back in. Otherwise I move on to other opportunities. GE has never been investor friendly."
Short your last chance Cover and cover Ask jj Do not bet against Larry
Can anyone give a source that Buffet is buying GE?
"GE stock is on the verge of breaking out! There will be a lot of resistance on the way to fifteen, buy on the dips."
GE will always be THE loser in your portfolio...if it goes up a bit GE is coming out with News and it goes down immediately...sick company and black spot in my investments....
"GE is trading on emotion and disbelief. Soon reality will set it. For example, reasonable minds are asking, after reverse split, what next? Issuance of new shares, maybe. Nobody knows."
yes the green ball bounce.... sweet
"It is NEVER a good signal when a company performs a reverse stock spit and in this case there is NO reason for it what so ever unless GE is hiding something! I will be selling all I have at a 14 price a.s.a.p. I have held stock in 3 companies that did reverses and all 3 went bankrupt! Not saying that is the case here, probably not, but I want no part of any company doing reverse splits."
"Huge volume as well as the price gain, this morning, which portends well for the rest of the week; other things being equal, of course.Go, GE!Good luck, longs."
Out at 9:31amSell the news
JJ must be the new @What_The_F and @GE To 4. All three are getting pounded!! Nothing better than crushing shorts!!

"I think GE stock was looking for a reason to take a break and breath ; other wise the news of RS which has not even been approved would not have made it to go down. Hopefully some people took advantage and loaded more shares. nothing has happened to be bad, Ge will also pay down debt and be in better fianancial position anyway.................now we just have to wait and see what's next....Good Luck to all"
Manipulation in play !Unreal!
A 1 to 8 reverse stock split? I don't see how that will help matters. Perhaps someone can enlighten me.
"again opportunity under $13,just keep adding, next stop ,$17-$19 in a couple months,just Culp being Culp and building war chest to over $45 billion,a large acquisition in the next few weeks"
"Well my sell order at 12.05 just hit. in at 8.05 avg - out at 12.05. not bad, but no point in hanging just to see it fall another dollar over the next few weeks. There will be no upside in this stock for the foreseeable future so no reason to be in any longer. Good luck longs."
Run GE Run ... Starting Next Week...
"IMHO and my not so crystal ball, I believe GE will not only reach $14 but will maintain $14 by March 14."

"Have you noticed that all the businesses sold off by GE are doing great - SYF, BKR, WAB, etc. Only those getting shafted are long term holders of GE."
ge will be over $20 soon. and by soon i mean 6 months
JJ's reaction to $GE finally holding onto the price point of 12! Next step is 24!
Relax people! ....MM's letting institutional investors load up at the lowest price they can bring this down at.Will trade higher when this is all said and done for the next step up.
"So Bloomberg article, ""GE Sinks as $30 Billion Sale of Jet Lessor Fails to Impress""... talks about the drop. No mention of the negative outlook from the talk of a reverse split. Like #$%$"
"I'm congratulating the BAGGIES that are holding on. Nice move for you today. I'm not convinced though that GE is ready to get back to the 14s. I'm still holding on to 2 short positions, and closed and filled 2. Made some good money in the past week, and hoping to see a drop under 13 to cover my other 2 positions."

"Not real happy about the reverse announcement at this time. They've been on a steady upward trend, so why throw cold water on it?"
"GE’s price is pretty stable so far. Hopefully, it can stand the next wave of market correction."
Are market makers taking out the newest stop loss orders before the next leg up? Hmm.
"GE is hated by 400,000 employees as it lost 90% of their portfolio value. So that make 400,002 if add Tusa and Markopolos. And 400,003 when you add me. Who is in?"
"GE hold pretty well considering how bad the market was for the past few days and is still trending up. GE is trading near it resistance level of 12.73. If we can see it hit this week ( which I don’t see any problem at all & possible we will see it tomorrow), 13-15+ is just only around the corner."
Wll be rush and a lot of stampede to cover today before weekend driving it up consistently throught out the day.

GE government contract???
"Like your comments TURIN look at L. Culp stile at DHRtook over in his 30s with stock at $11/share and 14 years later retired with stock at $65/sh after leaving in charge a mew CEO and dhr stock is now about 7 years later $200/shI own $500k options, triple what i started with in jan 2020 and i will never sell after exercising 160k calls because Culp will retire in 2024 with option to stay 2025 as executive chair and i expect GE to triple again after his departure just like he did with DHR"
"Let's put all political B.S. aside; I have to rank GE among some of the elite corporations that back in the day provided tuition reimbursement. They helped me greatly back in the early to mid 80's to obtain a college education, even though I didn't remain with GE. There were no obligations to remain joined with the company after graduation. Another elite company that provides tuition reimbursement is Mattress Firm.If I were a present day high school graduate... Who cares about $15.00 per hour flipping burgers or picking up trash in a Food Lion parking lot. A good percentage of parents have not invested in 529 plans; nor have they put back for education.When I went to work for GE back in the day; I had $300.00 to begin my education. GE provided some flexibility in my schedule as long as I worked my 40 hours and my portion of required overtime. GE took care of the rest of my tuition as long as there was a Grade C or above. HATS off to GE for helping me develop my career via tuition reimbursement. I wouldn't have pursued a post high school graduation without it.EVEN IF YOU GET A $15.00 MINIMUM WAGE; you will only be satisfied for a short time. You'll always be stuck in that grocery store or fast food job with very little advancement.With an associate's or bachelor's degree; this is something you can carry with you."
"Make no doubt, the Texas energy crisis put back on the table, and juiced, gas turbine sales. Buy."

"I'm all in with $F, $GM, $STLA, $PCRFY and $GE. They are still cheap, especially when you compare them with Tesla. This is where you need to be if you want the next TSLA stock."
GE should Spin off one of their divisions of to shareholders In an IPO. Wake everybody up.
GE is considered to be a green energy company. This stock will have a premium price going forward.
Who’s buying?
Foolish idea! Reverse splits are never seen in a positive light. The GE stock was moving up nicely and would have hit 25 by year end. Learning to be different is not easy. I understand that that other industrial companies are trading at 100+ but is this the only way to catch up? Someone talked the board and management into doing this reverse split. Who was it and what was in it for them?
Look at TSA check point numbers highest ever for week day since pandemic started

GE simply has no buying power or interest... no legs for any meaningful movement the last 20 years
$13.30 nope too high. Wait for the drop.
over 10% correction after ER this week!
1-8 reverse split is a Ge killer below $10.00 by Friday. This is a massive slap in the face to the retail investors that kept them afloat over the past few years.
Nice drop today.
Will the super bowl televise standing and honoring the national anthem tmrw? If not.. you Now know what direction our country Is headed.

Is buying GE stock now better than the safe secure returns of an FDIC CD ? Just maybe.

The pumpers are out in full force trying to keep this #$%$ on life support
"Ineptocrosy is a system of government where the least capable to lead are elected by the least capable of producing, and where the members of society least likely to sustain themselves or succeed, are rewarded with goods and services paid for by the confiscated wealth of a diminishing number of producers."
GE and BP are long solid investments . Both companies are investing heavily in renewable energy sector .
"Here is why R/S is happening and you can't stop it1. They want money. They will offer shares once they're done reverse split and repeat this again, and again, and again, as they did so over many decades. Do your research.2. You, as shareholder, does not have power to change the outcome if the board wants it to happen.Yes it's hard to accept that your favorite stonk will go rewind 6 months of growth but it's better to cut it now than never. If you bought this share 20 years ago, you'd be down 80% by now. If you bought it 5 years ago, you'd be down 60%. If you sell it now, you're only down 20%.Leave this trash stock as their primary objective is to take money from investors, not everyone is like Elon Musk."
"I posted twice to BA board on F-15EX. But this board does not show my improved post, with no typos. Good news F-15EX will be very popular, GE engines are being delivered this year. Check the BA site"
Culp makes bold move with reverse split. Hopefully encourage penny traders to go elsewhere.
can anyone imagine where this stock would be trading at if the market takes a big downturn? stock is going down with market at record highs
Do we cross $11.00 today?
Weak hands should not sell based on logic. Economy is coming back while management is rebuilding GE
"No bad news to fuel the drop today. Betting its GOP money getting pulled ahead of their feared Blue Fed. Govt. That's fine, it's about time we flipped the wealth from the few to the many. I'll buy their scare shares all day!!!"
You can bet Morgan Stanley and Goldman are ready to pounce. Buy.
They have already admitted they won't make their numbers this qtr or year. Does this mean Culp gets his bonus for making the SP target? LOL
It's a beautiful day...in the (GE) neighborhood! 
"U.S. and UK agree to suspend tariffs and seek aircraft row resolutionReuters Staff(Reuters) - Britain and the United States on Thursday agreed a four-month suspension of retaliatory tariffs imposed on goods like Scotch whisky over a long running aircraft subsidy row, saying they would use the time to resolve the dispute.$Ge $BA"
Hmmhh stock up over 100% last 6 months so you screw it all up and announce a reverse 8 to 1 split. makes you wonder what they are thinking or potential accounting games. wouldn't be the first time for GE. talk about a momentum ruiner...
"GE up 5.2% yesterday and the countdown continues. In 20 days GE reports 2018 Q4 earnings and Larry Culp presents his turnaround plan containing how GE will deliver on the $420,000,000,000 order backlog ($94,000,000,000 for Power segment), the pension risk reduction of over $7,200,000,000 due to the Fed tax rate increases, the schedule for completing the Transportation sale to Wabtec and shares delivered to current GE share holders, the schedule for spinning off GE Healthcare and the shares delivered to current shareholders, the value of the recent Iraq Power deal ($15,000,000,000), and too many more positives to mention. The future is bright for GELess"
"I agree with you whole Heartily Mohandess, I think that everything will work out hopefully !"
"Keep in mind, with every penny lost is a step away from Culp getting his bonus shares. As much as I hate RS as well, this does make sense to rightsize the excessive float and yes, it will reduce volatility."
Looks like the lower $11/share prices are gone.Better buy now before above $12 from here on out.Imagine if GE can create or get in crypto ....  Will be flying this summer 
The Culprit owns 13.9 Million shares. Do you think he cares about you longs? He is corrupt to begin with.
"Every chart - 1D, 5D, 1M, YTD, 6M and 1Y are ALL positive. That seems like a trend to me..."
Split happens sometime between a few months and a year later in 2022. There will be a lot of ups and downs but the general trend will
"Well, it’s a shame that GE is once again going to fall like other companies have done in the past.. remember Board Members, you can’t put lipstick on a pig.. A reverse split will not dress up your company. Very unwise decision to even ponder.. I’m done with GE..."
i envision ge going from $100 to $200 like I envision GE going from $13 to $26.
Everyone at $SCR thought reverse split was a good thing until it actually happened and got halved in a week

"If GE decides to buy FCEL they would be looking at over 30 billion in stock and equivalents. All of that for a company with just a few million in sales and large losses. Technology is pretty good, but what's the potential to ever break even for GE while dropping this stock to $10 a share? GE focus on what you are good at and keep paying down your debt!"
General Electric ends tumultuous year with stronger cash flows
Rumor of huge news by end of next week - earnings season is going to be glorious!
This is a classic bankruptcy company..Your shares will be worthless in 18 months.
Swing traders understand 13.15 is the price to enter with a big purchase.
"Is it because the egos of the present management group make them desperate to see a higher price on their company's shares regardless of how they get there? Remind me again.... What happened to Citigroup after the 1-for-10 reverse split? C has never gotten back to anywhere near the pre-split high, and probably never will."
Tusa has become irrelevant. Has been wrong for a few years now. His thesis got saved by the COVID crisis. His short positions from his peddling buddies are badly hurting. So ignore.

Like I said before $20 is coming very soon.
"Today: At the opening the run down continue as predicted, Then the move up to 11.10, but remember the 11.18 stalling! finally retreated at around 11.23. I still belive that around 8 to 9 am the market will continue the run down as the SPY should test the 373 area, hopefully it will stay above 370! but the main move will come at the end of the day between 11:45 and the close. Why! Monday is the beginning of the month and my pention is posted, so is many of yours, and here come all that money into the market. That is the plan. by the way how big monewise is the Senegal deals. Summary Ge will sell of after moving higher than 11:23 today, and will ralley into Monday starting at the end of today secion. We are ok, Honeywell's numbers demostrate that the industrial are Kicking #$%$"
"While I don’t condone violence at all, I do think it is a good thing for the ivory tower politicians to be a little bit scared of the ire of the people.

So cash flow is no longer the catalyst to move GE higher lol? Follow the bouncing ball time?

post the news link for reverse split or its fake
"Like I said this morning (see post), someone was playing a big game yesterday and today. 1/2 the normal volume each day, to get some institutional buyer(s) lots of shares at cheap prices. Will not be surprised at all to see GE upgrade after hours or in pre-market."
Some of the loss is from Boeing rotten ER report.
This is a game for big boys. The information about the re-split did not come out by accident. Be greedy when others are afraid.
tomorrow is investor day might be good for a small pop but the level ll market shows down pressure is about to roll over again and down the chute will go GE
We will have double digit economic growth this year and GE will lead the pack.
"The Year of the CULP, forward statement will push stock over $13 in 2 weeks, the again maybe the Robin Hood investors find all the Shorts playing in GE $25 end of year"
Reverse splits and stock buybacks will not boost the stock. Dividend increases and paying off debt will. I sold the majority of my GE at 30 awhile back (at a profit)
DIVIDEND INCREASE COMING SOON....!!!!!!
There is a rising up trend line at 12.50 or so. (4h)

OK close letting banks COVERING in the 13s thanks to the reverse split fantasy false news. Won't last long. This stock is worth $15 TODAY. Once the bstards cover the party can continue.
"If you have a business mind or you have run a business for yourself, you understand how good the deal is for your company. Larry Culp and the board are ones of the smartest people. We are the stupid ones who don't understand the value they create for GE. The analysts understand and will upgrade the stock. Right now, the stock is being sold temporatorily. It will go back up today or a couple days later when analysts upgrade the stock. I see this is a great opportunity to buy."
"JJ , J J , RJ and Chicken man, feel the burn. The way you spread bad slanted detail, much deserved."

"Every Aviation up big 200% to 400%, GE being held down low, severely undervalued, it's not even up 100% from 2008 lows, March lows $6.66.. GE was already severely undervalued at $13, below $20, $30 before the C0vid19.. Now GE is even further undervalued. Every Aviation up 7% to 10%, but GE up only 2%.."
"If you've been following this stock for a bit, you know this stock does this really oftentoo bad to be the sucker who bought the top but you are going to be carrying the bag for at least 6 months, and you won't even know if it will ever go back up to your entry"
"altair acquires ...........As part of the acquisition, Altair and GE Aviation have signed a memo of understanding (MOU) to facilitate a higher level of collaboration and establish a long-term strategic partnership. ge looking forward"

"NMM executed 15 for 1 reverse split. Share price dropped from $11 post split to $4. As of Friday, share price was $22 which is $1.47 presplit. It is scary but if GE drops to $6 -$8 range pre split, I am back in. Everybody talks about GE's potential. I am not longer fooled."
This should of been $12 today .
"and the retail Investor heard ""BOO"" and he ran scared..."
I managed to sell 7 March 19 contracts from 1.25-1.33(the high of the day). Do you think we could make another high today or was that it?
Larry Culp had better do something about this fast as he is taking a lot of money off the top for himself so....this is not right...not at all. Boolean
Based on the technicals $12.01 was the buying point. Buying did start and I think we should be okay till $13.05
"So much for Welch's legacy... GE (at $110B) still has leprosy... another limb amputation for $30B won't cure what ""ails"" it... bad management... mission creep... people who don't anticipate metric vs. imperial conversions & crash satellites into planets... Big ""L""..."
"interesting opening today, will see where it takes us"
"Red day to buy more or short if that's your thing. Hopefully tomorrow, a steady climb will begin.Current pricing really seems like a recovery value from before Covid hit. So any debt reduction or revenue increase should really bring this thing up at least into the 12's I would think."
"Longs and new retail investors who are cheering Managements RS decision and patting yourselves on the backs:GE just three short days ago was at $14.42, then on ""Investors day"" Management thought it was a good idea to announce they were no longer interested in doing business with the small ""Retail Investor""... Had they not chosen this route GE would be sitting at $16.50-$17.50 right now. But, hey enjoy the dead cat bounce and keep cheering these dirt bags on for their truly vile RS decision."
hahahahahaha we are bullish with all empty whiskey. where is Tusa now?.

if you thumbs down me it proves you did not mute me are curious about what I have to say -- so go ahead and thumbs down it won't change your losses
down $.69 from opening highs of day. this is still the most manipulated play on the market. can make 3-4% every day on trades executed in 1st 10 minutes of trading and buy back during last 30 minutes of trading. put the numbers in and look at last 2 months. opens at high closes at lows. SEC needs to close this one down with its accounting games.
Apple should buy GE for $22 per share......then break it up for $46 per share. Someone is going to do it. Might as well be Apple. :-)
run G.E. run
General Electric is down 4.96% to 10.73
GE is a dinosaur. It is reaching the end of its lifecycle as a company.
the stock shows every sign that it is about to roll over--- get out
"Six Sigma Jack, and his chosen boy Imelt cost my parents them most of their life savings. They thought this was an honest company. I wouldn't touch this junk for a $1"

I was honestly expecting a better start today.
Shorts covering at the end of the day after driving it down for no reason.
How an analyst set a target so far off from the rest of the analysts covering the same stock.? Anybody care to elaborate?
GE eliminated dividend and eliminated retirees who are long term investors for dividend income. Now GE is targeting retail investors with reverse split. Go figure.
Heading my way BAGGIES.

@J J you boy have 9 posts and I already like you.
Want to know when GE is truly on the road to recovery? When the freaking dividend starts moving north of that .01 cents a quarter. That is when this stocks starts to move. Get that dividend back up to 2-3%.
here comes 15
End of the year 18-20$ mark my words and make a screen of this comment
Slowly creeping to 14.00
"GE is really starting to trend...economy is opening so will help aviation...energy is in focus so the energy division should take advantage...balance sheet is in great shape n great leadership led by Mr Culp...add all these up n u get a very good future outlook...if I was Cathie Wood, I would make a splash n add GE to Ark Investments...just my opinion...always do your own DD!!"

"The way I think of it is this: if all is well, GE will be buying back shares. But GE is reverse splitting. Not so good in my opinion. I am think new shares will be issued next."
I hear everyone on CNBC saying we need ruleswell the first rule should be no more after or pre market trades by anyone foreign or domestic armature or pro ... it would be that simplesecond rule if you freeze buys then you freeze the entire stock on all exchangesrule 3 no way can you short more stock than available
Good Morning to ALL GE short sellers!!!
I think GE reacts on the headcount-Reduktion at Siemens Energy - less competition in the powerplant sector
"So, it seems Immelt has a book out trying to detail all of his trials and tribulations at GE. An attempt to justify how he ran GE into the ground when he was at the helm. As he laughs all the way to the bank with his $300,000,000. While other people lost the bulk of their retirement portfolio. It's sickening!!!"
GE keeps hitting bad luck. With descent earnings and multiple good news and upgrades still dives down this time because of down market. Good luck to all longs.
"Anyone on this board who's touting the idea of a reverse split ""1 share for every 8"" as positive, is a complete fraud. This in no way shape or form, has ever been a positive move, for any company, at any time, anywhere!!"

GE will go up if Dems win Georgia Senate seats.
Down because the entire market is down. Will go up on earnings tomorrow.
Tusa and Markopolos are correct. GE will fall to $4.

Breaking through 12.05 resistance will be key to going well into the 12’s.I am hoping the opening volume will accomplish that
My bad!! I said 50 million volume in 1st hour but it actually took 11 minutes!!
I bought this at 6.50. When I bought it I told everyone it would hit 10 before it hit 5. Everyone was writing it off. That is like writing off Walmart or Amazon. NOT gonna happen. This will be 15 before March.
reverse split to increase the share price before spinning off a portion of their business? seems interesting
If this is true and becomes reality a reverse split is the worst news ever for existing shareholders... I’m basically speechless
"Wow, Lieden to the rescue. Just like Culprit to dismantling GE."
Reverse split to increase share price and keep it stock away from most people this way the managements can focus the task at hand rather than trying to put out the fires on hourly or daily basis.Smart move
Just unbelievable. Dow going up but not GE after management great idea.
If you want to see a thing of true beauty take a peek at the 1 year chart for GE.
Culp does not care about retail investors apparently.
"8,000,000,000 shares! Time to take this down 8-fold! I'm all for it. Let's do this! :)"
Wake and bake doooooooodzzzzz
Tomorrow stocks will continue selloff. GE back to 12. Nice short.
It is going to be a very interesting day tomorrow...
Huge mistake on GE's part. Lots of investors have been holding this for a long time; had no choice. Now an opportunity comes to partially make things right. Perception means a lot in investing. There was NO reason to split this stock now when people finally feeling OK about it. They took what shoud have been a day for celebration (new deal) and cratered the stock. Very poor move GE.
"Judging by the reaction on this board, i don't think the R/S split is going to happen. Looks like a buy here."
I don't blame them. The optics are terrible when you are single digit or low two digit stock. I'm glad they are doing it.
GOING RED NEGATIVE SOON -- I CAN FEEL IT TRENDING LOWER YIPEE --->>>>> THANK YOU LORD THANK YOU BATHALA THANK YOU REVERSE SPLIT...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

All these shorts crying abt the reverse split because it’ll make it harder for them to short. Don’t be fooled longs. Culp and the board are smarter than these tools. Hahahahaha
"This definitely wants to go to 12 folks, and it seems she does not want to wait till tomorrow."
Out at 13.25 I don't care to be a GE spectator while not making any money. I don't care to watch my gains from buying at a low of 5.60 whittled away by stock adjustments and reorganization dramas.
as i said before fire the person who had the idea to reverse split. took us years to go over $14 and now this? SHAME

"WOW....LOTS OF PEOPLE BOUGHT IT AT ABOVE $12 THIS MORNING HOPING IT WILL BE SKYROCKTING, BUT SADLY IT NOSE DIVED.. NOT EVEN STABLE FOR 20 MIN :("
"Great BUYING opportunity, will take off on Monday and then much more on Tuesday after earnings and never look back. Great company with great CEO doing an outstanding job!"
GE
This needs to break this 11.70 ish resistance level. A advance to 12 would be nice
I am retired and need secure income have few dividend paying stocks including GE. should I invest more in bond or dividend stocks as of now my mix is 50/50.I am looking for opinion not advice.
"GE has been consolidating for a while. It has tested $10.5 low several times recently and moved back above $11. This is a very good sign. GE is waiting for good news to make a breakout. GE management will give a presentation in March. Before that, the bears will attack again. Prepare to accumulate more shares under $11 if it falls under the price since GE might never fall under $11 again. Don’t be shakeout while waiting. I trust GE will be breakout $12 and stay above $13 before March’s update. My target price for GE is $16 to $20 by the end of 2021!"
"nice going, holding onto ge paid off, for me a double"
Entire market was off today - long weekend blues - next week GE starts its move.
GE back to its former glory of 30 bucks a share. Just give it a little time. I’m holding this one long. Seriously Bullish￼￼
Larry Culp!!! Brilliant!!!
The big play is China allowing BA back in the market / largest orders after US / when that happens and it will after some political wrangling add another 10% easy ..
JJ and other bashers are trying to drive the sp down. They are scammers. Notice they don’t provide any facts. They don’t do their DD.GE doubled in 4 months. There is a reason.Don’t listen to the shorts.

"First fib, 9.70"
A reverse split is one of the worst things that can happen to an investor. After 50 years in the Market I've never seen this work for a stock holder. The board must look at us as stupid. A good example is Citi Bank. Split 10 for one 10 years ago. I still view it as a $7 stock and never bought another share. Same for Xerox. Somehow this must help management with stock options. This looks like a loser for years to come to me. Replace the Board. Dumb move.
had 20k shares bought when it was 6$. have no remaining trust after this announcement.. bye GE LARRY CULP.. Bought COTY INSTEAD SUE NABI WONT PULL #$%$ LIKE THAT.
"Whereas the demise of power took us down, it's resurgence especially with brownouts to blackouts increasing, will bring us back up. Buy the best in class."
"Uh uh, buy. How this is still below $15 is a mystery. Everything they own is now banging it."
TUSA being led by his toofy all the way to $15 lol. Ouch!
"Reverse splits are typically not good for companies. I sold half my position and booked some profits. I will wait to see how this plays out for GE. They should have just let well enough alone, but GE is doing great things, so it may not hurt them in the long run."
GE will be the next GME but with real reasoning on company growing again.
$10 soon hehehehe lol
"GE CASH & LIQUIDITY $$100 BILLION ($41 BN in USA+ $30Bn abroad+ $$25 BILLION Line of credit UNTOUCHED)..GE PAID OFF near $$50 BILLION debt/pension.. GE SPENT $$120 BILLION DISPOSABLE CASH in buying back stock, paying debt, LTC, pension, and set aside other things.. GE IS A CASH MACHINE"
go GE go..........non stop one way ticket to $15
If volume continues to increase GE is going to have one heck of an earnings run.
"Not going to hit 500mil, but 300+ likely.... Blood bath! Reverse the Reverse split decision, please!"
"Immelt flew with 2 jets every where he went and ""did not really think about it"" (about waste). -- isn't that a clueless CEO? enough said. Problem was BOD let Immelt gut GE for too long."
My computer shows GE down . 42 in AH trading; is that right??
Relax people. MMs are lowering the price for institutions to get in before Earning next TUE. Look back at last Earnings in late OCT. Stock price went down to $6 before skyrocket over $10 in 3 weeks after Pfizer vaccine announcement after Election!....mark my words...$14 in Feb.!
"Bankruptcy is certain, that's all you need to know about 6 Sigma Jack."
Hopefully $14 soon.
GE is getting HOT with volume and momentum. It is trading above it resistance level as well. We can see GE 14 just around the corner.
"All right BAGGIES, you didn't listen to me. GEs turn around, has become a reach around. Hold on tight while you are bent over."
"Tech under assault, GE up! No stopping this train with brownouts, blackouts, and Pratt and Whitney jet engines burning up in the sky. Buy."
EXPECT TRADING VOLUME TO BREAK RECORD...ONE of the most stupid announcement of all time.......smelling conspiracy and TUSA.....CULP to make an announcement and explanation about the issue before its too late..... Where did this whole idea came from and why ? Must have good reason for it and shareholder demand to know about it.........................................
"In absolute numbers, short shares are high with 80 million (and I think everybody understands, that it’s only one percent of outstanding shares). So it will cost 880 million + to wipe them out. Nokia was trading yesterday 1.1 billion shares with 60 million shares short having around 6 billion outstanding shares. Its the equivalent of 5.5 billion USD trading value. So it’s ridiculously cheap to kickstart the GE process compared to Nokia’s battle yesterday. Especially as GE has clearly a mid term success story to write like AAL. So stay alerted, the days will be longer for shorties !"

Here she goes....down down down. Close your positions!!!
All seems so good until now. GE_to_$400 please bring some bitterness....
777 that had engine problems over Denver has nothing to do with GE. GE makes the best of the best engines. Stay positive and grasp the fact that GE hit $12 after 9 months of bashings and is heading for a new 52 week high. Good luck to all longs.
Well they held it down as long as they could - Monday huge!
Down only 8.31 % today plus the big loss yesterday. Poster Steven says Reverse Split is a great idea. So No worries LOL. Wait till the split comes and it drops for weeks. I was almost out. I was actually debating about holding. Go fiqure . Scammed .
A lot of Dopes on this board that have no idea what they are talking about... This reverse split is a short sellers dream come true with a company like GE
Pretty sad when the whole market is up and I’m happy GE is only down 2 cents. Even when it gains and can’t hold those gains.. I’m long because I have to be at this point not because I want to be.
Last chance shorts to cover before earning surprise
if you can't defend the 13.40 level the shorts are in charge
Bug rally tomorrow GoGoGo GE. The stock is ignoring the market Mr. Culp knows what to do....Look at it go. 11+
"come on, let's get 12 and hold"
Is there any chance of a bounce back all the way back to $13 tomorrow?
A few examples of reverse splits... DRYS shipping had 7 reverse splits before delisting. UNG has 6 reverse splits before leaving investors penniless. Reverse splits only destroy shareholders.
"Anyone shorting this stock is going down. I'm contacting Reddit and GE will be a $55 stock again. GE is profitable and growing. Don't take my word for it read it below for yorself.GEGeneral Electric Company GE is popular for its LEAP aircraft engines, Heavy-Duty gas turbines, Haliade-X and Cypress wind turbines, and healthcare solutions.In the past three months, General Electric’s shares have outperformed the industry. In fourth-quarter 2020, its earnings met estimates, while sales surpassed the same by 3.1%. In the quarters ahead, the company is poised to gain from its portfolio-restructuring program, expansion in digital business, efforts to deleverage balance sheet and solid liquidity position. Moreover, its efforts are on track to reduce the exposure to the GE Capital business. For 2021, it anticipates adjusted earnings per share of 15-25 cents. Industrial organic revenues are predicted to increase in low-single digits in the year, while adjusted organic margin is expected to expand 250 basis points. Also, Industrial free cash flow is expected to be $2.5-$4.5 billion in 2021. General Electric is working diligently to improve its liquidity and manage its leverage."
I bought Ge @ $30 in 2016. I am hoping ge can return to $20 or $30. in 2 yrs.
Keep buying those up grades. Those guys are smarter then you are. hehe
Ge will be $200.00 by year end.
"The news hurts both longs and shorts. No one likes it, but I am going wait to hear what Culp has to say before taking actions."
We're all set looking good for $13 and up by Friday. Will crack the $13 mark sometime today. IMHO. GLTA the LOOOOOOOONNGS.

"RS would put price at $80-90 dollars. I own several stocks in this price range with great dividends, and that don't suffer from management shooting itself in the foot. This idea is destroying value and has no upside that I can see."
After R/S pps = $80.00.......... (if we are lucky....... )
wow. might even try to sell calls today with $13 strike ending this week
The RS is a move to make a future stock offering more palatable even though the numbers would be cash neutral. Less shares to offer at a much higher price.

"I’ve had a change of heart and bought back in. With the Democrats now back in control and their monopoly of the media there is no way another shutdown is going to occur. California is opening back up and that’s all the evidence you need to see that this pandemic is over. I do find it truly amazing though how fast the country is reopening. Kids are going back to f2f learning, restaurants and other businesses that had draconian restrictions just a month ago are now given the green light. Isn’t it amazing that less than 1 month after a new administration takes office the virus is going away...... makes you think"
Buy GE it is good for America it is good for you
Looks like the markets are finally realizing all the wackjobs that took office in January and the fact that the world is dropping the dollar as the reserve currency.
Can you imagine how many gas turbine orders are piling into GE with the frailties of solar and wind now publicly exposed?
been using TA for decades most people have no idea how to use it or when it works and when it does not-- at extremes using the right indicators you have a very high probability of being right over a 4 week period all weeks inclusive in the same month-- it is not a rolling indicator where you can roll into the next month when you roll over to the next week you start from scratch- this month shows GE closing the month below 12.50 how far below just a few cents -- next month have no data yet-- anyone who tells you it is going to 15 is just guessing --- fundamental analysis tells you nothing about price action -- you can not pay the bills guessing

Unforced error. Wonder if any insiders were trading on it????
"This week will be last chance to buy GE under $11.5. With improving positive cash flow, GE is well position to grow again. GE is a great buy under $11.5. several houses upgraded their target price to be $14. Even $14 price will look a bargain one year from now. I expect GE to reach $18 by the year end! Believe it or not, see it one year from now."
"Bloody '777' day ahead. And, I still don't see why BA isn't trading double-digits after their latest Indonesian fiasco with the throttles."

May be a day to buy morr
here is my opinion it is not good to own a stock if you are not in control. i own 700 shares for a lose. hoping to reach 17 and get out that #$%$ and now it went down because of the psychological effect of the reverse split. hey you guy who keeps on talking about math. i am the mathematician and most people think this is a wrong move. i hope it stop going down
Not a repeat of yesterdayCome on GEOne nice easy positive day would be great every once in a whileUgh
bought more GE YIPEE SEE U AT $35.00
COMING SOON BAGGIES
When will the reverse splits take place ?
Current GE shareholders
What's the news?
GE has been shaking out retail holders and retirees since it was $30. Even Buffet was shoke out at $25. GE keeps shaking.
No doubt... Tomorrow is the mind blowing day for new holder...
GE is really going in the right direction. The airline industry is now a bonus because it will soon start booming again. GE in my opinion will hit in the $20’s by the end of the year.
Explain exactly how Culp still has a job?

"They want you to concentrate on the RS but look at the rest of todays announcements. The numbers are dismal and once the RS is approved, they will offer new shares into it. That is how failing businesses roll. It is all they can do. The business isn't doing well. Look at the numbers/projections."
Wasn't his raise tied to share price
Open Monday $11.50-$11.60 - close near $12 - Tuesday crazy time!
Take profits while you can this no doubt is going down town
Not sure why we’re up but I like it!
SHORT SELLERS are in control ......................target is forSINGLE DIGITS..................................
5% outstanding stock sold in 2 days equals 14% stock drop. retailers need to get the heck out soon so this baby can finally take off!!
BAC has not reached pre reverse split price level since it happened nearly a decade ago. Not fond of them
I’m ready to talk about breaking up GE. GE’s break up value is probably north of $30 per share. Maybe JP Morgan could talk about it.
who are going to line up in upgrading $GE this week? should cross $15 in next few weeks.
ok I get 500 shares at $104 ill take it.
7% GDP this year. Why would anybody sell GE?
I can't believe this complete mess is still in business.
low 20s predicted for 2022its moving in the right direction I don't mind the wait
GE needs higher volume to be able to breakout from here. Today’s moving higher is index effect. Market makers will make it drop below $11.5 if the index moves lower. Be patient!
"Slowly but surely GE will be back to 30. As covid clears, GE revenue will get a big boost"
Go UP GE a good turnaround story!!!New CEO will get this UP!!!!
massive put buying
Would be nice for some positive movement today
Morgan Stanley just kicked #$%$ Tusa right in the nvts!!!!! LOL!!!! I can only imagine that Tusa's boss at JPM is chasing Tusa around the office with a big switch in his/her hand like my mom did to me all the time when I acted a fool. Funny visual!!!!
When shorts start covering we see $12.50 !!!
"At the proposed split of 1 for 8, the quarterly dividend should increase from 1 to 8 cents. Officially, this split brings the share price in line with peers, but it could also be used to bolster FCF as the dividend could be reduced by another 7/8ths without eliminating it completely."
HOLDING STRONG through Earnings. I think we have the Best CEO (Culp) in place to take GE MUCH higher.
FYI - institutional investors pay commissions based on number of shares - a reverse split makes it cheaper for those folks to trade the stock. Just knowing their stock customer
"Ok, so where do we locate a class action attorney?"
How does a huge company trade @11.00 in a 12 year bull market where most stocks are 200.00? Ask yourself....
"The countdown continues as we march to GE's presentation on January 31, 2019. In 17 days GE reports 2018 Q4 earnings and Larry Culp presents his turnaround plan containing how GE will deliver on the $420,000,000,000 order backlog ($94,000,000,000 for Power segment), the pension risk reduction of over $7,200,000,000 due to the Fed tax rate increases, the schedule for completing the Transportation sale to Wabtec and shares delivered to current GE share holders, the schedule for spinning off GE Healthcare and the shares delivered to current shareholders, the value of the recent Iraq Power deal ($15,000,000,000), and too many more positives to mention. The future is bright for GE"
GE WILL use the STOCK SHARE PRICE after REVERSE SPLIT TO BUY new companies -- GUESS WHAT WILL HAPPEN --- U KNOW EVERYTIME A COMPANY BUY A COMPANY THE STOCK PRICE WILL GO DOWN WHEN GE ANNOUNCE A NEW BUY USING THE NEWLY REVERSE SHARES ...!!!!!!! LOL then who will be losing money again deeper n have to wait LONGER
Looks good for a run to 13
I will buy after every ones earnings are finished market will shed 30% before next quarter from this Santanic President
Wall street trying its best to keep our ascent collared. It will fail. Buy.
"Haha.. JPM should replace Tuss with someone that can call it right... So far, I am spot on and to those who listened to Tusa should now listen to me. I upgraded GE to strong buy with $13 target before end of Feb, Tusa held the line to sell at $5 target. I had reiterated my strong buy and lifted the target price to $14, Tusa stayed disappeared.. I reiterated my position with strong buy and lifted my target price to $16... I still have not heard from Tusa, I feel bad for his followers for the huge losses. I feel great for those who followed me, and made huge money keeping faith in my assessment vs. Tusa !!! My advice now is to buy GE calls for $15 June, $15 for Jan 22, $17 Jan 23... Create the Culp-trend line. Hold for 30 days for sold upward momentum, roll June $15 calls into Jan $17, wait for till Sept-Oct and start building your 2023 long position. One more thing, Tusa no more.. Yes for Turin !!"
GE will finish day n the green......Buying opportunity.....
"Your forgetting their debt, the loss of those businesses when things pick up. GE kept jumping into everything they could including wind generators. You need to look at their 10Q and see the bottom line net earnings after expenses. I be back with figures and the latest data."
Maybe they are just shaking the tree with this news.
Reverse splits badFor ge to do this means stock will have problems rising. Big mistake No confidence is what Culp is sayingAdios bagholders
Reverse split is comming Ge just announced
If your a long holder from 2009 you must be scratching your head how you possibly could have made nothing in a 12 year bull market..
Don't Worry... Be Happy!!! 
"Just read a story about Larry Culp's pay package, I missed it back in August, regarding how GE modified the price the stock needs to reach for him to get a $200m+ bonus, now set at $16.67 per share. First bonus was at $10 per share for $40m+. My money is that it will get to this price no matter what. Already laying off thousands of workers and as the recovery continues in aviation this will drop to the bottom line. I can't imagine any CEO that wouldn't want that kind of payoff. That is all one really needs to know to bet on the stock."
We fought hard for 2 months for 11 and won. Now we will fight hard and land this ship on 12 for February and possibly break 13. This end of month lull is a perfect time to build up your dry powder. Keep on buying!
Auspicious day': WestJet returns grounded Boeing MAX 737 to the skies
if it holds just below 10 could form a great chart pattern--one that is very reliable
maybe sluggish price of GE is the result of Boeing is in the position of losing a third of its orders due to delay of delivery of 777 aircraft. Ge supplies engines for this aircraft???
"A recovery in commercial aviation combined with margin improvement in power, renewable energy, and healthcare equipment sales is the recipe for success that GE investors will be hoping for 2021. Fortunately, GE is a company set to benefit from the coronavirus vaccine and investors have cause to believe significant progress on earnings and cash flow will take place.For a company that has been around since the 1800s . From Renewable energy, Healthcare and Aviation GE is definitely a big player"
"ge improving numbers In 2021, the company expects to earn about 20 cents a share and generate roughly $3.5 billion in free cash flow. That compares with 1 cent in per-share earnings and $600 million in free cash flow generated this past year"
"When the news came out this morning, I ran to my computer and by the time I was selling my 50 shares not underwater they were falling already. So I sold only 25 hoping to get a better price later? Not to be, it went down and kept going down. 6pm now and it is still going down. We did not even vote yet. Looking back, I remember Cramer putting a gold star on Meltdown on everything he said. Then, when it started to fall, Cramer said it would go to $28. A few days later, he said $26, then $22, then $18, etc., etc."
"GE LONGS ,,, TECHNICAL ANALYSIS IS SWELF SERVING ,, THE MORE SIMPLE A CHART IS AND THE FORMATION CAN BE SEEN BY A MORON,, THEN IT IS VERY LIKE TO OCCUR ,,, THE ONE YEAR CHART IS PERFECT EXAMPLE OF A BOWL AND HANDLE ,, CHECK FOR YOURSELF ,, THIS IS TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 101 ,,, THE RESISTANCE IS MODERATELY AT 13.68 , AND THE TARGET IS 18-20 BY THE NEXT QUARTER .. GOOD LUCK TOMORROW ,, CAVIAT ,, THE HANDLE CAN EXTEND ANOTHER QUARTER BUT BIG THINGS ARE COMING IN THE NEXT 6 MONTHS AND HOPEFULLY SOONER .."
Blue energy isn't profitable and likely may never be so I wouldn't count on GE to be interested in buying Fcel or Plug or something. GE is interested in becoming more more profitable and streamlining and not getting bogged down into bottomless pits of never ending losses such as Plug fcel etc
Buy and hold tight for ride to $20
African politicians in this country are activists only concerned about one thing... there own power and people.
"Here is something to watch carefully.With the news just announced that General Electric was moving half the GE Capital sales for 2020 to AerCap of Ireland, it may remove $4 billion of GE Capital sales on a $10 billion total volume in 2020.And it would also remove the GE loss on their balance sheet of $785 million on the $1.8 billion loss for GE capital in 2020.It would also remove GE borrowing $5 billion to support GE Capital (GECAS is their leasing aircraft portfolio in General Electric).What does all this mean.. Unless you really understand GE Capital as a stand alone unit - it is impossible to understand the effect on General Electric.But there are three things known for sure..... It will cut the GE debt by at least $5 billion. It will cut the inter-company loans between GE and GE Capital which has always been totally confusing.and It will definitely remove as much as $1.8 billion loss in 2020 from the FCF on the GE balance sheet.It is a lot of Harry Houdini I am sure - but to the analysts and the public anything to make the GE balance sheet simpler and anything to remove a negative FCF from the GE Capital division is positive for the GE price.And don't expect any help from the Stephen Tusa JP Morgan bear who is predicting a $5 stock or any other analyst. They a pathetic. All they can scream is too much debt, too little Free Cash Flow, not diversified enough since they have sold off lots and shrunk the company, and now Tusa's ridiculous statement that he is worried about a totally acceptable 81% pension funding. I am convinced they have never read the 10K quarterly filings. One lady analyst in December even said on The Street on TV that trying t understand GE financials is just too complicated for her. She doesn't read them!That is the poor quality you are relying on to handle your money and your investments. Pitiful..The next question will be the new Free Cash Flow number for 2021 and how the Wednesday March 10th conference will present their projectionsPerhaps the announcement a month ago the the FCF would be $2.5 to $4.5 billion was accurate then.But does that mean the next Culp prediction this week will now be adding the $1.8 billion GE Capital loss into his thinking and therefore making the new FCF now a $4.5 to $6.5 billion for this year?Remember when you are working with a $75 billion sales for 2020 company that was recently $100 billion in yearly sales in 2018 - it takes very little to return the company to over a dollar a share profit. Part is actual earning and part is just plain how you report the sales and costs. I business we call it the cut line or how the results for the quarter and year re accounted for.Add to that the potential for upward pricing Renewables, and power, and the normal understatement by Culp in predicting results - this could be a game changer. It could put the profit FCF potentially at maybe $7 billion or more and that would mean around $0.80 a share.At 8o cents a share - and using the very conservative 20 times earnings would translate into $16 a share and at 25 times earning it would easily come in at $20 stock price sometime mid 2021.So the AerCap announcement is really a dynamite blast if it means what I think it means.Culp is removing losers from his balance sheet and that makes the stock power upward.So this deal is very mysterious but it appears to move GE into a far better space with GE capital and GECAS - their airplane leasing division. It remove the 1,600 aircraft presently financed by GE on their balance sheet."
"I hope that everyone contacts GE investor relations to protest the proposed reverse stock split, an accounting gimmick to get an unearned increase in the stock price. Larry Culp's proposal has been rubber stamped by his board of directors. I wonder how many millions of dollars were paid to financial advisors, lawyers, accountants to get approval of this nonsense?"
$15. Today
I've said it before; GE always stumbles at almost exactly the $100 billion market cap; grab a chunk if it gets back around the price of a foot-long sub.
GE = Enron
$15 on wed
What is this?!... Green on a Friday and then a follow up with a green Monday and a green Tuesday?! 
10.50 closing today
"Culp said Q1 cash flow would likely be negative, BUT IMPROVED from a year ago; outlook for 2021 unchanged.Sorry for anyone that reacted. Really not news. Someone really seems to be pushing the negative here."
Good time to buy here...IMO
"Oh man, this terd is being purchased by murons like @Nasis and Lisa and Cap -r"
the covered return on the 10.5p is 86% return at .20. I want more!
This is the kind of decision that takes the company down the toilet 1/8 RS are they comparing GE to Apple  GE stock should drop $2 then they can do 1/8 RS
GE_to$4 How are you. Please don´t hesitate on giving your opinion and new impresions. Looking forward.

"I think overall today is neutral, probably will close slightly red at the end of the day. Just hopefully there isn't an aggressive short attack. Overall is relatively unstable until ER. just personal thoughts."
$13 is a huge break point!
jj just bought more ge shares at 12.12 I think jj you will not see this price at the end of April
Jeffrey Email is related to Jeffrey Epstein￼
Very exciting to see GE hit 12 early in morning trading session but as time went it was obvious that excitement of results did not hold. GE needs Buffet to validate opportunity for long term increase or validation by investing in this great company again
Reverse split they have to with billions of shares out there stock won’t ever move youNeed 2 billion traded to buy to move up 10-25. Cents Now it will move in $
jim cramer hyped them just now
$12 coming
"Well, I guess today is the end of JJ. I’m gonna miss him."
Load upAnd buy the dip
"Yep makes no sense GME , plug even AMC What the fudge"
Truly an unbelievable stunt by Culp..
GE will pass over $11 by today. even pass $12 tomorrow
Don’t panic hedge funds are selling their longs to cover their shorts.
Bought for dividend alone!!! 
It seems like GE has had a slow decline Monday through Thursday and a big increase on fridays as options expire I will be interested to see if this recovers tomorrowBeen a rough week though
Higher interest rates are going to help ge on there retirement balance sheets
Its GE's turn now isn't it?
"I bought in 200 shares at 3:58pm. Then after hours I sold all my shares of $GE because they announced a possible Reverse Split. It's 65 degrees in Virginia, I got my first COVID shot last week, and things are looking up! :-)With any luck, tomorrow I will sell my shares of $AMC and make enough to see a movie in a theater. :-)"
As they say... Hoping/Wishing and Guessing are all bad investment strategies..
Winners don’t come often when you are out there in the wild world of the markets. But all that can change if you join the right program. I joined up with these guys (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Now I am having solid picks every week.
"Any updates on the split? Hot topic for a couple of days, now all is quiet."
"if you really love GE that much sell it, buy back after the RS is complete. Save yourselves money and heartache"
Can I say that a reverse split is an almost lauphable idea....makes the stock a short target and smaller investors will also have a harder time selling covered calls as 100 shares will require a larger capital outlay...Also accumulation of a few shares every once in awhile is lost....bad Idea!
Expecting a slow upward crawl in to earnings with the PR machine cranking up Pre and Post.
Citigroup have been trading sideways since the 10 for 1 reverse split. It was a bad idea then and now.
"But while the coronavirus pandemic continues to pressure GE's flagship aviation business early in 2021, the conglomerate is seeing overall momentum.reason for some optimism"
GE.. to many outstanding shares to manipulate.... sell the news before earnings.
Dividend to one penny? Interesting.
FCC needs to step in and put a stop to short selling or at least limit the number of shares available for short selling..... this is the biggest scam and it actually destroys companies
Are you happy now.
"A Little Common Sense is needed now....Lets take a look at General Electric Free Cash Flow for the past 5 yearsThere a basically 4 areas of FCF that GE can make a real profit.It need to make $8.8 billion of 2021 to be at $1 a share profit which would translate into a $20 stock at a 20 times earnings pe ratioAviation FCF has hovered at around $5.34 billion (2016), $5.34 billion (2017), $6.46 billion (1918), $6.82 billion (2019, and $2.44 billion (2020).Health FCF has hovered at around $3.10 billion (2016), $3.48 billion (2017), $3.7 billion (2018), $3.9 billion (2019) and was only $3.1 billion (after Bio Pharma sale in 2020)Renewables FCF has hovered at around $631 million (2016), $583 million (2017), $287 million (2018), $-666 loss (2019), and $-715 loss (2020) Power has hovered at around $4.19 billion (2016), $1.95 billion (2017), (-808 million (loss 2018), $386 million (2019), and $274 million (2020)Something to consider. Renewables had losses in 2018and 2019 when they were spending $500 million creating and improving in their wind turbines in their plants. They have perfected the radical game changing Halaide 13W and installed a test model in Rotherdam. If they had not spent that $500 million money their figures would be close to a break even. For my part - I am all for the expense if it leads to progress and profit.The point of all the above is to see that s the world returns to pre pandemic it is not a far reach for GE to achieve their $8.8 billion FCF this year in 2021 and the stock to return to $20 a share.You can add to that three things.Payroll was halved, GE now tops anyone in renewables and there fore will be profitable going forward at perhaps 5% to 8%, and Aviation has a lot of existing and very stable military and commercial engine service contracts to keep them profitable - not to mention Rolls Royce and Pratt & Whitney are seriously wounded financially and reputation going forward.Also three other important changes are the reduction of long term debt, the taking control of GE Capital and reducing that independent part of the company's exposure, and also important definitely getting a reduction on paying into their pension fund more money to get them at least 81% funded.And lastly the management change has given General Electric a whole new culture and direction. Culp underpromises and over performs. I love the surprises that proel the stock up a point or more.What can anyone subtract from the above numbrs and direction to prove to me that GE's future is not only a $20 stock - but more likely in 2022 a $30 stock as they improve their Free Cash Flow."
"When jj, chickens, F and dewd were shoring GE @ 6.25, I was backing up the truck. BEEP BEEP BEEP. 100% again! Three times in the past 3 years. Thank you shorty clowns! I have your money."
"I have been through a few R/S. It never benefits shareholders. Now, splits, always benefit shareholders. GE used to do those."
no more buyers
up trend line here. Probably bounce off it. See if it holds. Nice action though!
How could GE Management not reverse their decision?? This is a blood bath that will only get worse. They need to change their minds now!!

Anybody know the short interest on GE?
playing with 12.00 like a 2 year old!
Tusa is genius. As he predicted GE $5-6 2021 then we have to expect a major stock market collapse of the this year. Otherwise how he could be a genius?
"Guys, I think sticking to the Wall Street shorts is the right thing to do. For too long this has been a manipulated market. I am definitely concerned that some of you will be left with nothing.Do the trade, but don’t get emotionally attached to a trade. Get out and take your profits and invest them into actual companies with assets who pay dividends.Think $GE $XOM $CVX $HD $GEL $ET there’s a ton of very good companies out there. Don’t get too attached to options and being over leveraged. GROWTH IS NOT A VIABLE BUSINESS PLAN WITHOUT PROFITS AND CASH FLOW. Please remember this - get into good companies with profitable well run businesses."
"What's up GE ????? Having Another doomed down day?...Market from one end, shorts and hedge fund managers from the other end with the HELP of a not so famous analyst are trying to rip you apart and force you to fall..HA HA HA...They soon going to wake up and realize you are A 125 year old strong company and could not be brought down this easily at least not when a great man like CULP is behind the wheel...viva GE...go GE go....."
close will send this below 13

"Don't kid yourself GE's Management designed this 1 for 8 reverse split to shake off the retail investor, the very one's that saved them from going under.

Looking good! Hoping we can get over 12 next week!
Windmills failing all over due to extreme cold. Will cost BIG $$$$$ to fix. Not good sign.
Did GE ounce stock split ?
Now that GE is generating cash and has trimmed down itself. Also there are more pieces to the puzzle which can be spun off and also the future looks brighter I ask can the potential for a buyer to come in and make an offer to buy the company. Wait and see
Full steam ahead now. I want that 12 dollars printed.
Sell because of a reverse split? LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
If it passes 14.25... drinks are on me....
"Starting to move back up. Also shareholders will vote no to reverse split. That was pretty much clear. All shareholders want more investors to hold GE stock so there will be no reverse splits. Now, $20 is new target price."
This guy is delusional. The stock went from $51 to $20 under his leadership. Culp is 20 times the CEO he was. He is a #$%$ and should pay back all the money he stole from investors. I used to work for GE Power. That unit should be making money hand over fist. Culp is righting the ship as we speak. https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/22/ex-ge-ceo-jeff-immelt-says-wholly-unhappy-with-story-around-my-tenure.html
"Short Call options, or buy Put options. GE will be in single digit before Jan 15."
I just bought in yesterday morning for the first time and glad I did. I've been following GE for quite some time and kicking myself for not getting in sooner. I like the businesses GE is into. I'm in for the long haul and feel GE is poised for a nice comeback.
"As aviation begins its climb back, why are you selling the lease business? Typical GE move."
Volumes goes and goes ....
It can not seem to break through that 10.82 markWould be nice to close above that mark
Does anyone know how the split works beyond the 1 for 8? Is it at preset determined way ahead of the actual transaction. Or the market price at day of split actually occurs?
"last chance to BUY under $12........................................with vaccination going full force, travel will resume strongly soon...BA production increase will start sending orders and leasing panes over to GE....and as Cramer said this will take GE to about $15 pps.....My guess is as early as mid MAR we should see this happen"
This is an opportunity to load up for more shares. Will not have reverse split. This is a fake test to get price down to do a buy back. Board and shareholders will not approve RS.
"Greta Thunberg should be giggly - SAS orders an order of BA planes with $ 2.9B worth of Leap1A engines & Luxcara orders 137 GE Cypress wind turbines with 753 MW capacity.

$20 is coming sometime this year. Weak hands should not sell.
All I can say is I wish I put more in this. But at least I’m up 10%. We’ll see 20$ real soon!
"The deal is great. The stock would have gone way up on that deal, the revere split 8 for1 does not look good and the timing for the split is not right, this is why the stock sold."
"Can anybody explain why GE’s CEO can negotiate to lower down his stock bonuses price from $18 per share to $6 per share? When GE stock price was dropped to $6, he negotiated his price so did all the board director’s stock price. When the stock gets back to $18, he will get a stock bonus of >=$210 million. How corrupted the company still is! If GE’s drops to $1, he could negotiate get the price at $1. That might be the reason why the ceo Culp and the board didn’t care the stock price to drop since he and the board can negotiate and get their stock assigned at low price. This just doesn’t sound right to me. If Culp is a great ceo, he should stick to the performance measure he initially was given. The people who bought the the stock at $18 will just recover his price to breakeven."
Holding up nicely on such a bad day
They could have bought back stock instead but maybe need cash to expand clean energy business
FIRE LARRY CULP!
"Don't fret too much on GE debt levels/valuation measures, the balloning addressable-market (EV, turbines, infrastructure build, etc) more than compensates for the high debt load ... plus they've been active on the debt reduction front ... near-term horizon is very positive IMHO"
Lots of cheerleaders on here happy the stock took a dip. It's also a great opportunity to buy the dip also. $GE to $24 this year can be done!

"At first reporting, Aviation24.be wrote about a left-hand engine fault, but the story is more complex. Simon Hradecky from The Aviation Herald explains: “There was no engine fault as such. There was a hydraulic fault in the left engine system, but the engine continued to run, and the crew wanted to continue to destination. But then they received a fuel imbalance and decided to shut the engine down according to QRH (no engine fault, but the suspicion of a fuel leak).”"
GE is well positioned for clean energy. This year might be a turning point for GE. It reminds me of AMD.
"Reverse split success stories. BKNG, LH, AVXL, C"
A trading buddy asked me the other day about GE and where I got the pick. I told her to check out (http://Thetraderguide.com). That’s where I get 95% of my winners.
"Someone said it here, Citi thought reverse split was a great idea in 2011 at $5 or so. A 10 for 1 reverse split was executed. Citi stock has never gone above $8 since then. That was 10 years ago. Meanwhile BAC and other financials have recovered nicely. Citi is still stuck under $8."
I can’t believe Robinhood Investors sold their GE to run off and play a Ponzi Scheme. They could stay here and get rich slowly. Go figure.
A reverse split will kill any short term profits. The stock will have trouble rising from here.
"Have fun ""SHORTS"" we shareholders will be buying with you covering"
I am starting to think this does look like a good short right here
Looks like 20 is the new target should get past 15 soon!
"So with a reverse split ,I wonder if the token dividend will stay at 1 cent a share even with 1/8 the share count .This would save GE another 300 million a year also."
1/25th normal daily volume computes to drop of 1.5% makes sense...
"I decided to sell my GE and purchase more WFC. Hate the losses, but think WFC is a better long and short term investment. Good luck to all those remaining."
Here is an update Culp vs Tusa Culp $11.55 Tusa $5.00Have a great week Longs.
BRING IT ON! TREASURY YIELDS CONTINUE TO GO UP! MUSIC TO MY EARS!
Before I buy Ge I would ask myself . Do you think the stock might drop lower ?
20 more cents and I will have yet another 5 grand! that's 20 grand I've made from going long in GE since 7 bucks so once again that leaves me to believe THEY ARE BROKE!
We should clear this up once and for all GE has too low of a short float to be squeezed like GME. If we had 100x volume then yes but at %1 short float it’s not likely

ubs raising ge target today to 14$ from 12
"I think there are a few things that could move the shares higher, but none as important as buying back a large amount of shares. GE has been in a down sizing mode for the last few years (much needed) causing revenue to come down as well. So the question is what is the best way to spend the dollar to increase the value of GE shares? With billions of shares in a shrinking company and the stock so low in price, now is the best time to buy back like 250 million shares at a minimum. The future will only cost more, and it will send a message that the balance sheet will be stronger causing the share price to increase........Anything else like paying down debt, raising dividend , buying other companies, which may cause the price to increase just means it will cost millions or billions more in the future. Please Mgt. lets not make the same old mistakes with the new GE. Maybe that should be the new add meet the new GE, its not your fathers GE, lets hope!!!"

GE is the most SEVERELY UNDERVALUED by far.. GIANT GE is still close to 2008 lows, March lows"
"As far as the split, it still has to be approved by the shareholders, right? If they don't approve it fine. If they do approve it I'm sure they believe it is a good move.It's amazing how many people on this site think they are smarter than and know more than Larry Culp."

Hey everyone! I see JJ shorted 10K at $13.21 today.
now credit rating companies are chiming in with possible downgrades by a notch
Ge biggest mistake(in History) was TRUSTING in these financial engineers with their financial GIMMICKS. That what destroyed Ge capital and almost destroyed Ge. Stay with the fundamentals of business and forget Wall street's gimmicks of financial engineering.
If they announce split is off... 14 In a week.
From a math point of view it does not make a difference on company value reverse slit or a split that adds share to the count but from a share marketing position almost all reverse splits reduce market cap and almost all splits that put more shares into the market move the stock up. This is a fact. Knowing this makes me wonder what GE has against small share holders. Culp has done an excellent job and from my perspective had a chance to have a $30 share price which from a turnaround from low single digits is remarkable. I take all bets that the stock is a minimum of 5% down by EOM March. In fact I did bet it.

Lets see a continuation thru 12
I think I’m buying 20 contracts for next week 13 call. This price should be significantly lower giving the year they have had. So the new evaluation would be around 20$ if they had another 2019 year.
Give it a week or two. People love round numbers when splits or reverse splits happen. I say $15 by next week. That relates to $120 when reverse split happens. Market is to srttong and with stimulus checks coming will only get stronger.
"Just added another 500 shares, looking to see free cash of 2 billion or better as Culp said we would see this quarter, lets see if he delivers. The stock will jump 2 bucks if its in the numbers....."
A huge amount of today’s volume in the last hour. I hope that is a sign of what will happen when volume returns to normal.
"GE Transportation’s revenue for Q1’18 came in at $872 million (down 11% year-on-year), while the segment’s profits jumped nearly 15% largely due to a higher mix of service volume and lower engineering spend. However, we expect the trend of revenue declines to change in the near future. GE’s Transportation division received nearly $3.6 billion worth of orders in the last two quarters. In addition, the total order backlog for the division stands at approximately $18 billion. This is comprised of 1,800 new locomotives orders and modernization of 1,000 locomotives. As a result, we expect the Transportation EBITDA to come in at around $1.05 billion in 2018. Further, the modernization of nearly 11,400 locomotive units, coupled with the deal to upgrade and build new locomotives for Ukraine should provide significant long-term opportunity"
The most desperate move any company can make. reverse split. Only companies in trouble RS their stocks.

He said he could send it back, so my Son put in a newdrive gear in the existing opener. 130 bucks is much cheaper than 500+. The customer works at home and deals solely with Boeing and GE andhas done it for quite a few months. Not a bad deal and that big dooris now working fine, thanks to a guy named Mike.

I thought that you were a ""Hands on Guy"" and would do good things for GE. But you have proved me wrong. You should be a ""Hands Off Guy"". You have shown yourself to be a true Elitist - crushing the shareholders and raising the stock valuation artificially, which will be more subject to joyous applause from all the short sellers. A Reverse Split? 2 for 1.. no; 3 for 1..no; 4 for 1 ..no; 5 for 1..no; 6 for 1 ..no; 7 for 1 ..Nope; 8 FOR 1 ..You GOT IT!!!

The reverse split proposal. Ge to take around 1.8billion shares so for every 8 shares you got is one whole share. Usually companies do this to stay listed. And the merge didn’t receive that good of a response. I’m looking at the volume and that should push it to 14 at least. But it hasn’t been 30 for the past five years. I say keep holding on.

What happened?
Currently up .14 or 1% AH. Good sign for tomorrow.
"Where is $20.00 ,"
Based on action today: There will be a big upside to 11.70-12.00 tomorrow. Even the shorties are afraid to jump on it. Billions lost in the market from shorts and more to come in different markets. You keep betting against the house you will get burned sooner or later.

"NO LIKES a company to take their 1000 shares and give them one hundred in return IT DOES NOT MATTER IF THE VALUE IS THE SAME. This reverse split is going to cause a lot more people to sell. A selloff on a reverse split happens just like a stock goes up on a regular split, you can call it irrational but it’s a proven phenomenon. There are no “rules” to making money in investing despite your little MBA teacher or Warren Buffet ( mr. can’t make money sell the airlines and banks at the bottom loser) tell you. GE WILL do this reverse split and this is a easy easy easy short there is at least $3.50 more downside here SHORT THIS WITH BOTH HANDS!!!!!"
My lucky day out of many years of investment:GE up 4%TEVA up 7%CYH up 5^ADOM up 40%WARM up 19%
(Train wreck) + (Zombie apocalypse) = Reverse Split
Culp reverse split then get multimillion bonus and run away.
And then there was a company called GE whom disappeared to the dust due to Executive corruption at all levels.
upside potential. buy buy buy
In 2021 GE will return to the NYSE where it belongs.
Amazon should be tarred and feathered for buying into GE competitors windfarm. Never liked that bald headed weasal .like him even less now
Look at one year chart...Anyone see the cup and handle?
"Thanks Larry , shorts are very quiet jj is gone for ever"
Resistance between 11.33 and 11.44 I do not see this prices today. Maybe by Friday or Monday next week. But if it goes under 10.91 there will be lits of accumulation.
Doubling down on GE to $4
Every stock I own was up today except for GE. Easy come easy go.
Long live Tusa and Markopolos. GE is going down.
"Sample a dozen random tickers @2:28pm till close and think about what you see. And do so across multi sectors..

Need to break through 12. Getting close.
Come'on....we can do it...just 2 minutes left til close....over 12!....YES we did!
GE could have reclaimed a helluva lot of shares back when it was in the single digits. It could still buy some back now.
Missed on the estimate by 0.01 but with higher revenue. So still with higher revenue the company couldn’t meet the original analyst expectations. Fake Rally .
Happy new year to everyone
"If you believe that Ge will recover as most analysts do, and that after this near-term period the shares will be significantly higher ($12 to 15 per share or more) then stay with it. If you panic you will just feed the short-term speculators and day traders. Stay long and you will likely be rewarded for your effort with a share price close to $20. That is a nice rate of return over 18-20 months. This isn’t the old Ge ... go look at Culp’s track record and then his Ge compensation package. Be bold and stay long."
GE wanted to get its stock up to triple digits by the 1 for 8 reverse split. Looks like a 1 for 10 reverse split may need be by done by the time GE stops falling.
how long will it take to give back the $.50 plus up yesterday. give it till 1300...
Ge will satrt paying divident.
Where were all the restrictions when GE collapsed over 300 billion $$ over the last 20 years. How much do u suppose the hedge funds made shorting the stock versus so-called Robin Hood investors. At least management made it easier on the big boys by crashing the dividend to one cent per quarter. BTW when you short u have to pay the dividend.
"Ok GE, its a red market day. Let's see what you got."
Down in pre-market along with BA (Boeing) due to this weekend's Indonesian 787 plane crash?

"bullish, I think it's not time to stop yet"
Could it be possible that culp is a worse ceo than immelt and welsh combined?
"been long GE since $6, took profits.. yikes! be back after this sell off"

Has been consolidating for almost a year n is starting to break out. Expecting a nice move up...weak n impatient weak hands r mostly gone n more n more institutions have purchased for the long term!!

It will go back up after lunch around 12:30. Also it will be around $13 plus by the end of the week.
"aviation alone will have the stock selling at $20, then add reduction of debt, then add CULP and acquisitions, and this stock is a steal. watch how fast $17.50 comes, buying all I can can today and prior to eps."
"uh oh,, looks like all the weak hands that sold are being taught a lesson which has started bout 20 mins ago. this will finish Green today and then up from there"
COVER your short positions JJ and GE_to_$4 quick !!. You both like losing money don't you ?.
"Attention please...Captain Culp has momentarily leveled us off at $13+... we now have a visual on horizon of significant Power, Aviation and Renewable energy needs heading our way. Please remain in your seats while he gets clearance and initiates a climb to higher altitude to cover these new demands."
200mil soon and back to the $11.00's!! Stop the split GE Management and stop the bleeding!
"I feared a ""sell the news"" event today. I didn't think GE would actually make a negative announcement today."
Today was a great day for the market. Almost everything was in green except for a few and sadly GE was one of them. It definitely suffered from TUSa comments. I always say if you got nothing nice to say you might as well shut up and don’t say anything at all.
I tried being long went back short
Goldman Sachs announced it is raising its price target on the industrial giant's to $15 per share reiterating buy rating

Goodbye GE Capital!! I will not miss you.
"GE is an American legend. Their failure under Immelt is a failure for the American economy, American business, and employees and shareholders. A strong GE has great benefit to the American economy and can be of great benefit to American citizens as an employer. Welch and Immelt and many like them in corporate America think too much about how to gather wealth from stock options on the backs of shareholders and not enough about how to build shareholder equity and buy their shares on the open market the way common shareholders do. The best run publicly traded companies in America limit the use of stock options as a form of compensation, limit dilution of common shareholders, limit the need for share buybacks of the share dilution caused by issuing shares for stock options, and grow shareholder equity and the ability to pay a dividend with growing positive cash flow. The excessive use of stock options in publicly traded companies concentrates wealth into the executives who have the power to reward themselves in that way, dilutes common shareholders, and robs shareholders of the opportunity for a dividend or reinvestment by the use of cash to buy back the shares they issued to themselves to overcompensate themselves for no productive difference or better performance; furthermore, this bad widespread practice incentivizes risks that do not justify the rewards for shareholders and are only justified by the recipients of stock options."
GE is the NEXT GME.
Great long term stock for the clean energy sector
well every stock has high vollume shorted will be targeted from other hegde funds and retailers globally. UK news firm reports it; not my story.

LOL - Stephen Tusa again did not give a price target but reiterated hold on GE yesterday. Guess he' still recovering from sticker shock when he seen GE yesterday. Wait until earnings hits him....hope he's sitting down.
"1 for 8 reverse split is a game changer investor decision whether it still works for the individualit will change investor styledividend another question. ge was asked but chose not to respondis culp still looking to cut costs, here is an opportunitymy earlier comment, looking out for ge or the investorat least temporarily."
"Texas Governor continues to show what a bad leader he is for his state. He removes sensible covid precautions against advice of CDC. The Federal Government should now withdraw ALL Federal funding, oil and gas leases and other ""handouts"". They did the same with power and water, and when disaster struck, Texas came begging. When covid surges again, they will come begging again. Time to move NASA, all military bases and other Federal agencies to blue states."
Good Day to All GE Investors !!! 
"GE can be such a safe haven. Look, it always loses less than the market. And it always grows more than the market. High-tech companies behave quite the opposite."

"For all of you doubters, history will repeat itself, I am sure no one thought GE will go from $57 to $6. Then from $32 to $5 ... but it did. And it will do it again all the way to $4."
we ca repeat that every year :)

Love the shorts here.. NOT. $17 in no time
So GE has always been a short sellers dream... GE has always been a day traders dream.. GE has always had difficulties finding investors when the price was dirt cheap.. imagine paying 105.00 for the same struggling company.. it’s almost laughable. Watch and learn how the shorts surgically destroy this stock yet again.
Hold. Do not let your shares go. This is about to blast off on market open.
"who would buy GE now with a reverse split coming, makes no sense. You are just giving your money away"
No reverse split.

This stock was around this level. When I was born in 1995.
Added my final lot at 12.08 my truck is full! Long term  let's just not do the reverse !
I don't like the reverse split and I'm out. I would have liked to see them grow their sales and keep the stock market going up. A reverse split is dangerous. Paying down their debt and buying back stock would have helped the share price as well.
"one Month's worth of gains.... ""poof"" gone like magic!"

Idk who bought those shares the last hr wasn’t institutional unless you can trade from the funny farm. Where’s the news
Finally GE getting to cut Jobs in France?...they have been wanting to do that for long time but French Government was threatening GE with fines...This is great news!! They can now cut even more excess and unnecessary costs.
Even though this was a $60 stock 20 years ago I'll be happy with $20.
GE should sell video games or be almost out of business like AMC. Those 2 stocks are up over 50% while this pig is down 2.5% What GARBAGE.

Where in the hell is Tusa of Jpm who predicted ge demise. Many investors lost a bundle on his fake prognostication.
Folks this is a year of OX per Asian calendar. It is believed that during the OX year things would be bullish and hopefully this would be the case for market as whole as Melt up occurs and most special a bullish year for GE.
Anyone know when the reverse becomes effective?
"traders or investors GE is just the best stock for anybody ,CULP probably #1 CEO in the country, add into the picture $40 billion in cash and l/c's, with CULP doing m&a deals, shorts will start to cover real soon. $22 share price not far off"

"for ge stock to continue upward action, we need, commercial flying coming back , or a move by culp"
When will revised price targets from analysts come through?
a chart pattern like this never rests until it takes out 10 bucks heading to 9.80 area-- this chart pattern is extremely accurate short term it says nothing about where the stock is heading over thinnest year plus--if it fails in the rally attempt below 10 up to the under carriage of 10 get out big trouble ahead --if it rallies over 10 and hods chances are good you can ride it to a new 52 week high--not interested in your comments-- I am stating probabilities based on past chart patterns -- probabilities does not mean you are right or wrong just getting the odds in your favor long term -- stocks will gravitate around the 10 level way too regularly to be chance ---right or wrong I am going with he odds-- sub 10 coming soon
short squeeze is on....
Sell off on the way. ?
1 for 8 reverse split will make GE a $100 stock. I'd wait to buy post split if I were a new investor.
Sold and walk away buy may be in future

"General Electric Company’s GE Power segment recently clinched an order for its state-of-the-art HA — one of the most efficient fleet of gas turbines in the world. The company entered into a deal with Tongyeong Eco Power to provide more than 1 gigawatt of power generation equipment at Tongyeong combined cycle power plant, based in Tongyeong City, South Korea."
GE can't even afford to pay a dividend so how can they afford to buy back any stock . They can't. So they will do the next best thing to address the massive number of shares issued over the glory years. A reverse split will only affect current holders if they continue to hold the stock. I challenge anyone to show us how Culp's bonuses and performance compensation largess is tied to the current stock price.Sure he and other insiders have purchased shares in GE. So did I when it was $5 a share.
EVERY TIME MARKET GOES UP...GE GOES DOWN......... 9 OUT OF 10 HAS BEEN THE CASE.....

"GE board of directors; there is none better! We preached reverse split and the board of directors listened. The day traders and shorts will migrate somewhere else almost as fast as foreigners coming across the U.S. southern border.

It will be nice to finally get a dividend increase by the reverse split that is forthcoming!For all you day traders and shorts looking for another stock to tinker with... There's always ""Sears Holdings"". LMAO!!!!Reverse split... Done deal baby!"
helluva bounce
"Going to $20 no question. By the end of this month,"
Boom! GE knocks it out of the park.
timber
Here is what I know as fact. All of GE’s business divisions will be in high growth going forward. Buy the trend and don’t listen to noise from anyone. Buy logic sense.
"$GE needs another surge to the upside of $5 dollars to get it to $20 plus buy year's end. It's going to require sustained daily volume of around 100 million for about a month to pull it off in just a month. Institutions are already starting buy up shares, now it's time for the retail investors to step it up. $GE pays you to hold after you buy shares unlike the resent ""Pump and Dump"" stocks that have been in the news. Even Apple cut it's dividend during it's rebuild period, $GE is doing the same thing and will follow the same model and become a growth stock during it's recovery from the pandemic."

GE is on a solid growth path. I'm all in long all the way. Mark my words the stock price will be in $30+ range by mid year.

If the RS had not been announced we would be at 15. How much credibility is in the RS? Thats the golden question. I will trade on the improving fundamentals and balance sheet during a reopening as large as this. No day trades here just pure old school investing.
Is GEs net debt really $37 billion? I don’t think they have a debt problem anymore especially if they generate $4 billion in free cash flow this year
GE is one for investors for great turn around investment pick. Business units are in the right sector for major growth going forward. GE is also very safe to hold. No worry during sleeping at night. Dividend will slowly coming back at the same time revenues keep climbing. $40 is very possible price target by 2024. GE is also considered as provider for green infrastructure. A premium price is warranted. I have been recommending to every new investors here since GE was at $6 bucks but probably not many listen to my reasoning. 40 plus experience help me able to find stock picks. Trading for me is now just for fun as my life is getting older. Good luck.
ge should be a reddit meme stock

There is absolutely no reason for GE to be down again. It is been down for nearly 2 weeks despite good market sentiment and all the good news regarding the company.................The only reason perhaps is manipulation and corruption..............but GE will shine no matter what.................
More discount pricing!

Glad i stayed away. This is gonna fail.

I lost respect for him he’s just like the past bozzos that came to GE. Mr Clup will ger his 25 million bonus cause the share pice will be way over 25 dollars after the R/S. What a smart sneak..."
Huge cup and handle pattern formed. Most likely a pause on resistance then further upside.
no commonsense person would hold or buy GE with that 1-8
Hurry up don’t miss this move to $4.
"GE is going to be a Python with a huge prey in its stomach... Very, very slow to move (over 7 bilion shares)..Short call options every week..."

Why this drop? No negative news

Hey General Electric is a great company and it has tripled since March which is fantastic. The current trend dictates a repeat of the move that was had back in mid June. The uptrend is over this dead cat bounce will not last to bring back to the top of the up trend. Allow the stock to come down and follow the charts please. The faster it comes back down to hit the support one more time at 11.70 the faster it can hit 15
"Did they finally decide not to manipulate the stock, darling? Why thank you"
"Aviation roars back and TUSA see his shrink twice a week, not one. Buy."
Here go finally!
GE has disappointed in the past. Can management give wall Street a little hope? Maybe a new gizmo for gene therapy? Or a home EV charging solution? Or some government stimulus gifts? We are in the Democrat party zone.
Maybe with the increased price they can get added back to the Dow. ￼
I Just don't think were going to repeat the recent pattern tomorrow. Green open and up! After hours head fake.

Weird. GE is loved by Obama folks

The educated stock analyst at JP Morgan have the mindset like the guy in the GIF
Might jump in here @ $11.99 for a long term hold to go along with m F @ $7.80Markets should dump on Friday after this weeks gains and drag this down with it
"GE has burned everyone who believed in it in the past! Fact is it will take a considerable time to mend those fences. Don't expect an overnight sensation. Fact is they disappointed on earnings. GE is a company who people find hard to trust either as an investor or as a client or customer. Yes, it will rise slowly in a slow upward trend with many up and down days - barring anymore sensationally bad news to surface then all bets are off."
Just shaking that tree. How many will remain. Buy the dip!

lost $20B in market cap in 2 days.. sale of aviation lease equates to giving it away free plus the added bonus of a 1-8 reverse split. GE is and will always be the biggest hurdle to success; always get it the way. good reading check out the OLD Fart board of directors not a young mind amongst any.
"I would put my $$ on Larry Culp, not the shorts and Bears. He knows far more about GE than anyone selling today. This is a good time to add some more shares."

20 million shares in 7 minutes; that's more than 25% of the average volume.
Ge signed a multi billion deal with scandinavian airlines
That kind of shoots a hole in the capital gains leverage with this stock. I don't see the stock price moving up at 8x the rate it is now no matter what they do.
I feel like people in this comment section think a reverse split actually changes something with the company
http://www.ge.com/news/reports/a-solar-star-is-born-ge-and-blackrock-form-new-solar-powerhouse
no reason to drop today. it is a buy buy buy buy signal
wait till tomorrow when the market is DOWN.... this will drop another 20%.. hello single digits.....
What happened here???. I thought Larry was supposed to be a smart guy
"Dead Cat Bounce.It hits bottom and rises. Then hits again and bounces up again.An that is the pattern f fear and greed.None of the past 2 days trading means anything because there is nothing fundamental involved.General Electric is the same company it was on Monday. The same!JB Morgan analyst Steven Tusa is an idiot and Ed Miller of Train Capital who on the GE board basically said so.Steven Tusa spins the story that GE stock will be $5 - the great MYTH the same way Trump says the election was stolen and he won - the GREAT STEAL. Both are fabrications looking for fools....Yes the last $20 billion of GE Capital will be debt on the company books directly now. But there is also a $21 billion asset in the AerCap stock - the 111 million shares of AerCap stock owned by GE. The change in the financials is zero. Zero. Zero.Steven Tusa says GE will be 8 times indebted in capital debt to capital assets.. That is simply a lie.GE Capital is $115 billion. GE debt shoud now be around $25 billion left after the AerCap deal and they are heading to 2.5:1 - debt to profit ratio.That means if GE returns to $10 billion FCF in 2022 and owed $25 bilion in debt - that is a true 2.5:1 debt of profit ratio.But never forget that GE has uncommitted with assets unused. Tthe Baker stock is sellable at $7 billion.The AerCap stock will be sellable at about $21 billion. And there is still on standby $45 billion cash against their $70 billion debt.So play with your numbers, throw a fit, sell and scream, but nothing will changeSame for the 8:1 reverse split. Everyone is in a ""tizzy"" for nothing. General Electric will be the same the day after the split happens.And that split will definitely be for the best as we get rid of all the Robinhood traders.Today the volume was just under 300 million shares traded.I never thought the e were that many buyers of GE stock. That today volume represents 1/25th of all GE stock traded today.Since over 60% is locked up in long term funds pension and hedge fund holdings - it really unveils how many day traders and unsophisticated trders are out there. That ratio today for the GE stock sales looks more like 1 in ever 12 available shares traded today.WoW!."
"There is no market correction in USA, only crashed or all the way UP. some humans will lose money, some humans will make money, it is people casino."
"Brent2 minutes agoTusa vs Culp? So far, Culp is winning. Buy.These are the people you want to mute. Perma bulls, long term bag holders"
"It's funny that some people think their vote matters in company decisions, nope!Why do you think reverse split happens? Retail investors never want them, but why??It's because total of small apes don't matter in voting percentage and all the big decisions are up to the board and their greedy pocket. You will NEVER stop reverse split, unless they suddenly don't want money."
day traders about to pull the plug
GE looking pretty good these days.
Shareholders will not approve the split by the looks of the PA.
"The new GE under CULP has been great. As I said it before, I'll say it again. GE will be $20 before the end of 2021."
Wait till cramer calls this a buy you better by now if you want in
"The reverse in this situation is harmless. It’s not as though they’re doing it to avoid a delisting. They’re reducing the float and bringing the stock price in line with the rest of the industry. After a lousy couple of years, this signals the beginning of a slow steady increase. What the reverse has given us is an opportunity to buy on this silly dip. The day after the reverse, the market will have forgotten all about it."
"Mr Larry Culp, please convert the 30% shares in BKR. to create an outfit to clead all the wells that are going to be plug. KBR is the best network which know were all those not in use wells are located and has the workabout to make a bit to the Goverment handle this task. Do not be late in this endevour. Reand todays executive order on climate change."
"Ever since the Wall Street Swindlers Upgraded GE, the stock has been down 12 out of the past 15 trading days, and the volume is half of the normal daily trading volume akmost every day (No Institutions buying after the snake oil salesmen's upgrade!) .. Anyone noticed?"
"GE $$CASH MOUNTAIN GETTING MASDIVELY BIGGER AND BIGGER ($45 Bn in USA+ $30 Bn sale of Finamce Leasing+ $30 Bn abroad+ $25 Bn Line of Credit)..This after GE SPENT DISPOSABLE CASH of nearly $$$120 BILLION buying back stock 2016--2017, Debt paid, Pension Paid, LTC extra $15 Billion set aside unnecessarily..."
WHOOOAAAA IT BROKE THE $12 YIPEE MY SHORT IS MAKING MONEY BIG TIME YPEE YEAHH BABYYY.. DOWN BABY SO I CAN MAKE MONEY ON THE DOWNSIDE TOOO MABUHAY ANG PILIPINAS
"GE option @$15 exp June18, looks so atteactive"
"Bottom line: GE stock is a buy right now, assuming the stock holds above its latest entry point. So it wasn't a buy last week at 10 bucks and change but now that it is more expensive...it is?WHAT???? Anyway... I loaded the boat with 10K in the 6's..... boat floats nice....!!!"
Sell before it's too late.
Keep moving up and send the shorts into a panic!!
wait to see 60T:11.63
"Come on GE 8 Billion shares !!! really yesterday you you could have saved a few million buying stock back. Every dollar the stock goes up will cost 8 Billion dollars more to buy back 1 billion shares.... Are you going to wait till its 20 to start a share buy back, lets go will ya... You know the stock is not going to move to far with over eight billion shares out there. Maybe you could learn from E Bay, they raised the div and bought back their shares, and yes the stock jumped up like 10 percent. Yes the value of GE will go up if you do this, but the longer you wait the more its going to cost, do you get this."
"i don't get the reasoning behind the planned reverse split. however, i understand even less why people would sell because of it! it will not change the value of anyone's GE position..."
"I’m holding my calls but the price drop is crazyIf they came out and announced they were taking the reverse split off the table, the stock wouldn’t go up 1.93 (last two days drop) So the drop is just irrational I’m hoping the institutional guys see the opportunity and jump in"
Any possiblity of GE scaling $13 mark in March?
can they turn ge into gme? We need to shake some shorts and get going
Common GE - hold the gain above the .30 for one day. You at least deserve it. Jesus.
Where is that 4.00 Mr. Genius GE_to_$4 ?. hahahaha. You and JJ are a piece of work !.
up again. yahoos average target for ge now raised from 11.75 to 12.18.
will see $12 today
"Timber, I told you BAGGIES. Twelve today."
How does a company like GE that has traded over 35 years on NYSE trade for 11.00 especially in a 12 year bull market?
"WOW, DOW up almost 300. This pig down over 1 dollar. BAGGIES once again left holding the bag. You will never learn that this company is out to screw retail investors."
we will fly tomorrow
reverse split is always a bad newstime to buy puts
Heading to $20. Hold your shares.
Never listen to frauds on CNBC. They were pumping this the day before RS announcement. Bet their minions were divesting their positions on the other side. Such a fraud market. Just do your own homework.
EXTREMELY OVER BOUGHT
"Another banner day for us shorts. Down 20 cents premarket. I will keep on taking various short positions on this pig making 5 to 10 percent increase in my holdings on a weekly to monthly basis. I have also taken a huge short position on Game Stop. This company is the next Blockbuster, and will be worthless within a year or two. Games will be streamed on line, just like movies. You can keep on holding on to GE, but I predict a post reverse share price of about 80. This equals a share price of about $9.00 today. The writing is on the wall for GE, and currently it is not good."
The State of Wisconsin Investment Board substantially increased positions in General Electric ADDING another 2.7 MILLION shares to their existing GE stock holdings.....GE also closed in highest point of the day and hopefully this trend will continue for awhile.... LETS HOPE we see a total new 52 week high in the next week or two.... I will be a holder till at least $17 and if the air travel picks up maybe even $25...GOOD LUCK to all and please do your own dd
Talk on Redditt????
Where's JJ? I'm up like 80% on my CALLs today.
Larry culp....buy hold forget
"""investors day"""
Wake me at $30. LOL
Looks like more ra ra price moves for GE. rara volume too

big lots coming in now!!!
"Government looks set to borrow more than $3 trillion for second year in a rowThe numbers: The federal government's budget deficit widened to $311 in February from $235 billion in the same month last year, the Treasury Department reported Wednesday.Economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal had expected the deficit to widen to $255 billion in February.The deficit is a record for the month.What happened: Total spending was $559 billion in February, up 32% from the prior year. Spending went up on unemployment benefits from the Labor Department and spending by the Health and Human Services . The government is not keeping track of all the money spent to fight COVID-19 pandemic."
"the year of the CULP, m&a with the Cash horde very soon, just like Danaher"
"The ramp up hasn’t finished yet. Believe me, this stock will be back in the 20s in a couple of years . But I know many have no patience"
"Have no idea if this has anything to do with AH gain, but Steve Grasso on CNBC picked GE as final pick. Said he’s expecting another “20%” move up soon."
"It seems today is a profit taking day.....GE been in RED all morning; however I don't think it would stay in RED, expect to get back in GREEN ZONE.....and go green all the way till earning is announced..Hopefully we will see it cross $13 soon....................JIM CRAMER raised his prediction on GE from $10 to $12.....I think it will even go higher than that...In my opinion $12 is very conservative number....This is my personal opinion, make sure to do your own DD......."
Chart looks.............bearish.
"Reverse splits are a sign of weakness. Now from the new price of $80 or $100 dollars it can begin to sell off again big time. They sell Baker Hughes just as Oil comes back. They sell GE credit just as the financials are in vogue. I don't know the whole story, but GE is out of lockstep with the real world."
"GE should be talking about building and selling great products. But all you hear is GE is making great deals, selling and spinning things off and reverse splitting. I don't see any incentive to buy and hold there. When all is said and done, you will have maybe a holding company or some skeleton company that may be finally sold off to some venture capitalist. I don't think there is any royalty to any company called GE. It is all about making deals and making money."
"IMO, clear trend reversal after yesterday and todays massive volume selling.. been long GE since $6, took profits. this doesn't look good"
"whether short or longno differencebuy low sell hi or sell hi buy lowworks either way,"
There's nothing like good money management.
losing patience..will need to review to protect gains i have left after this mess...
"Now I think someobody leaked the news of the rev split, and that's what caused the late day selloff yesterday."
"here is someone who really wants to see ge perform this quarter and beyond ..................A $200,502,000 stake of GE shares are currently present in Nelson Peltz's portfolio which amounts to 32,183,233 number of shares"
"I'm long GE, however over the years they have deluted any value to shareholders with massive 8.5 billion shares outstanding. Tuesday will be interesting. What could happen? Culp blames covid-19, can not get enough electronic component for electronic gizmos that are used in their jet engines & wind turbines. I hope I am wrong. Watch how the stock trades on Monday. If huge volume in either direction means a leak of info"
what's not to love... renewable the new magnet for venture capitalist.... GE 
GE was over $13 per share last year just before the Pandemic hit. GE is not a stay at home stock. It’s a get out and do things stock. In a few months we will be out doing things.
11s coming.
Run Shorts Run!!

"I'm telling everyone on Robinhood to buy GE right now, but I'm telling all you guys to SELL GE now.Kinda like the saying...""We cheat the Other Guy, and then pass the Savings on to You"". :-) GLTA"
Sometimes I like to drink carpet cleaner. I feel it makes my hair shine
Culp is as bad as Immelt with a shady deal proposed to do a reverse stock split.Another way to screw shareholders.
"GE Renewable Energy has been selected by Leeward Renewable Energy, LLC to repower its 90 MW #Aragonne wind project in Guadalupe County, #NewMexico, alongside the new 145 MW Aragonne Mesa wind project, the total wind farm output will increase to 235 MW"
"For once, I am hoping this comes down a bit. I want to add 50% to my February call options position"
Reverse spilt Better than spending billions on a buy back The price drop is from lower guidance
@Sammy You are totally clueless! The reverse split will make it higher than $20.00.
The monster is coming back!
Tell you what any news screws the shorts is good news.
"""Hanoi, Vietnam – 23 February, 2021 – GE Renewable Energy announced that it has been awarded a contract by Ocean Renewable Energy Joint Stock Company to supply a total of 15 of GE’s 4 MW-137 wind turbines to support construction of the Cau Dat Wind Farm, the first wind farm in Lâm Đồng Province in Vietnam. The contract also provides a 10-year full service O&M agreement for operation and maintenance of the wind farm."""
strong sell above 13
"2021 Will be a great year for Culp and Board of directors with those juicy multi million salary deals NOT GE.Expect massive layoffs ,offshore outsourcing and increase of GE goods prices to meet his market price goal."
General Electric stock price target raised to $13 from $12 at Oppenheimer
I’m going to the moon see ya all
"Is Buffet, and I don’t mean Phoebe Buffet, going to announce a new 13F after the close with 10-50 million shares?"
With the US credit rating at jeopardy GE might be headed to $11.50 a share.
"they say they are going to burn cash first quarter. The question would be if they are going to burn cash the second, the third.....hopefully not"
"Big fan of this company but, moving up 5% because a 777 engine blew up and it wasn't GE's, isn't really justified. I'm a buyer at $11.15 once the irrational exuberance settles down a bit."
Culp over Tusa the loosa.
i will hold this ge until i am break even. i will hold this ge and yell those board members of ge everyday
What are the chances GE restores the dividend?
"GE is a real solid stock. Look at my below results....My last 150 days GE investment results are:10-Sep-20 $108,40727-Oct-20 $139,40827-Oct-20 $170,21312-Nov-20 $214,79818-Nov-20 $260,3221-Dec-20 $250,2259-Dec-20 $317,7734-Jan-21 $266,7995-Feb-21 $327,501"
"what I like about Culp is that the guy just works and works and works quietly and in the end he gets unbelievable results, and no one believes him. Even Danaher is not a high profile company. But it does not matter, the guy gets you the results which are reflected in the price of the stock, and this is what matters."

GE engines are much better. Newer 777 are installed with GE engines. GE brings quality and good things to life.
Poor judgement as indicated by the street's reaction to this #$%$
jj we warned you change your habit
Boeing 777 engine problem must not be GE engine = Good for GE for more engine sell

I think Apple is preparing a $23 per share offer for GE. Apple needs to make a bold move. :-)
GE nearing 1996 stock highs. Wow. So much has happened in 25 years and GE is at the same price.
"Here is my take, Was a holder of GE back with Jack, sold all under Jeff in high teens after one bad move after another, could not take any more. I bought back in not long ago about 6 to 7 area few thousand shares. At that time I wanted GE broken up as I knew the value was much more than 6 and change, but figured worst case would be to see it crawl back up over the next few years. I have to say Culp doing a great job and in time I believe with a small raise in dividend and a few less shares we will see the teens again...... But Now is the time for share buy back not when its more money, look at the last buy back, lets not wait till its too high again !!! We need to see action now, it will put GE back on the road to recovery. Lets not do the same old mistakes of the past. Are you listening MGT."
All these peeps talking about dividends - who cares about dividends! Capital appreciation is for winners not some 4% handout each year.
Anyone think GE will break $10?
"nuff said... GE Future which way will it go....Total assets of the company in 2019 (in millions of dollars): 266,048Market value as of March 31, 2020 (in millions of dollars): 69,406Total employees of the company in 2019: 205,000It would have been the number one company in our list but unfortunately General Electric had gigantic losses which pushed it down our list. Just a decade ago, it was among the most profitable companies in the US but has underperformed majorly since and has become one of the biggest loss making companies in the world."

Put $175k into GE in the 7's and BA in the 150's just to keep some interest and entertainmdnt in the market.....remaining went to a financial advisor into capital preservation instruments where I dont care if the market goes down 75%...wont lose a penny. Both situations were turnarounds with solid, respected leadership in Monoghan and Su.....just like GG has now.....with a long term timeline..BA a duopoly and a best in class is just a matter of time....Relocated to Fla Keys and my decision each day is do I take my boat fishing on the bay or the ocean and if the wind blows I check in on these boards for some comic relief....and thats' where you come in oh Notradomis.......so keep gambling with your ""trading""......and maybe someday youll find a better answer to your ""calls"" comment....M O R O N...."

who would hold GE with a 1-8 reverse split
1/8 RS I am out. what a shame
Those $15 calls were soooo in reach. Thanks for the kick in the balls GE.
Culp promised positive FCF in the 4th and beat earnings in the 3rd. He has always under estimated. Analysts estimate positive FCF of 2.5B. Buying this dip.
"GE is still punishing bagholders after decades, TMV is not on your side, keep compounding your penny lol."
GE held up extremely well over the past rocky weeks.Clear sailing ahead!

"People, please, do not rely on information posted on social media stock boards. Lot’s of people will scam you just to get your shares at a heavily discounted rate. These folks out here include average retail investors trying to score a little extra. Then there’s the hedge fund trolls. No way to vet comments and that is a good thing, it doesn’t matter, this board is not a place for financial advice. Find an certified advisor you can meet with eye-2-eye. Trading platforms have tutorials, learn them. Due diligence and you’ll make good decisions for your financial situation. Culp is not going to risk a setback for GE, he’s done very well so far. Plus GE is not a “get filthy rich” in a month type of stock. GLTA."
now the cheapskate like JJ can not play around with his weekly pay check anymore...
"Been bullish here since Jan 2018. Saw a light after management shake-up and even more with debt restructuring, better structure withing the Board, and sensible asset sell-offs and no frills outlooks and updates from top brass. I hope Culp is around for another decade."
GE is a buy and hold!
Who was bragging about the 10K short this morning. He will cover at or above $12.50

LAST LAST CALL TO SELL GE BEFORE REVERSE SPLIT DOWN DRAFT COME INTO PLAY NEXT WEEK :)
Robinhood ears are short term traders or day traders.
Climate change represents a huge risk. Renewable energy is an excellent way to mitigate that risk. Natural disasters are fueling this trend. Pain is a great motivator. Countries are putting their $$ behind the Paris Agreement.
"Still miss that weekly paycheck from GE Father retired from there so did Brother, hope this year returns to former glory."
There is no way that some of you guys have been holding for years plus and have not seen any profit.. NO WAY!!!! I am thinking this company should be a good company.. It seems like it is trying to get involved in almost every sector.. I bought some call options because they were so cheap
Short sellers pushed it down with all its ammunition... a short squeeze may happen soon if GE gets upgrades...
Priceline 1:6 in 2003 Stock up 10x since then.
"In the money March 19 Call Options for strike price $8, $9 & $10 putting a lid on GE share price from going up. The MMs are pulling the price down to wipe out the option premiums at the tme of expiration?Hedging the long positions with some cheap $10 put options for March would be good..."
negative Cash flow this April earnings report as Larry Sculp said. watch value drop further on that day
Aviation and Earnings will bump GE stock up to $15. Great Bottom Fishing here. Start your jet engines!
"Weak hands are fleeing , a couple of quarters of increasing revs/earnings / cash and restoration of the dividend and fistfights will break out trying to get hold of a few shares ...if a company is not on the ropes not in danger of delisting , an RS can be a very bullish sign ... my guess is , if GE were to totally break up , the vlaue would be north of $30 /share ... garce"

"I'd say sentiment on this stock has been rising. Institutions are definitely nibbling more.I agree that ramping up airline bookings will see htis fly, but we're probably 4 qtrs away from seeing the results of that.Long term hold."
Well I guess TUSa is not going to get any dividends from GE.
I like the earnings last three quarters. Nice trend up.
Baker Hughes is nearing a 52 week high. Good time for GE to cash out. Further improve the balance sheet.
"if you owned $ge, you saw how these law firms line up for no good use. Same happening to $acrx and $uavs. at the end weak hands will cash the loss."
Where is Tusa? hahhahahhaa
"It looks like GE has lost its direction...not sure where to head. shorts and puts and manipulators are causing it...rather shameful.......125 year old company can keep up with 50 cents of gain specially on days where the market is exploding and all sorts of good news and upgrades are falling from the sky for GE, but still sitting stagnant...LONGS will be the end winner, that's for sure........go GE go STRONG......"
MACD - great indicator - huge pop coming
"no news, ge tends to give back.good news will support the stockapproved arms deal includes ge , total 3 to 4 billionbut we dont know the extent of ges participation"
IMAGINE 350 MILLLION SHARES WAS SOLD YESTERDAY FOR GE. MEANING IT WILL GO DOWN MORE 10 DOLLAR IS THE FAIR PRICE.
Took some profit from my options today and plan to make some more... the force is strong with this one
"BAGGIES, how do you read GE's announcement of its improving cash flow from 26 January 2021? Since a firm's ability to pay dividends depends both on its earnings and cash flow, the rise of GE's cash flow during 2020-Q4 marks a potential turnaround for the long-troubled company. If sustained, GE will be able to afford a dividend rise.Is that what's going on here? Because if it isn't, the argument that shares of GE are becoming overvalued and its nearing time to sell becomes stronger if its shares are really trading within the vertical range they have since 2018. No dividend increase, is a sell signal. Shorts once again will win while BAGGIES are left with empty pockets."
Get into $GEVO while you can. Thank me later!!
Sorry make the rise now 7.62% today (so far)....:) :) :) !!!
"For longs & bulls, if your here because of Culp, reduced debt, better balance sheet, growth potential/good earnings moving forward in renewables, power, health, aviation, & digital, then the reverse split discussion should not worry you because the FUNDAMENTALS have not changed.IMO, sure pre-culp history w/GE makes folks skittish coupled with the appearance of any neg. news but either you accept the turnaround is happening (I think a lot support there) or you don't.Best to everyone."
"I don’t care what kind of business model GE has, they have provided on thing They can’t run a company."
Good Day to All GE Investors!!! :):):)
Come on General. Let's close the week at 11.50 and make me happy.
"9:30AM GE starts the slow drip lower..,"
"""Keep the Faith"" - Sleepy JoeThis stock is going to be a roller coaster, but you can bet your bottom dollar this year GE turns around"
$20 definitely is coming due to world economy strong next year plus the fact the world needs to go green. GE is right in the middle to provide green energy infrastructure and equipment. Buy low sell high.
"DÉJÀ VU FOR GENERAL ELECTRICIf this sounds a bit like déjà vu, there’s good reason. In April 2019, Communist China’s efforts to steal GE’s turbine technology were thwarted and resulted in the indictment of Xiaoquing Zheng, a GE insider who was discovered to have copied more than 19,000 files to a USB drive and had encrypted over 400 files on his desktop. Then Assistant U.S. Attorney General Demers noted at that time, “The indictment alleges a textbook example of the Chinese government’s strategy to rob American companies of their intellectual property and to replicate their products in Communist Chinese factories, enabling Communist Chinese companies to replace the American company first in the Chinese market and later worldwide.”Looking back a bit further, yet contemporaneous with the activities of Ng, we see that in October 2018, Chinese Ministry of State Security officer was arrested in Belgium and then subsequently extradited to the United States for his part in targeting and attempting to steal trade secrets and intellectual property from GE aviation.ALARM BELLS FOR COMPANIESWhile it is heartening to note the three separate efforts to steal General Electric’s technologies resulted in indictments, alarm bells should be sounding for every defense contractor regardless of sector.The alarm? Communist China is willing and able to steal your technology.Setbacks to their efforts don’t seem to dissuade Communist China’s intellectual property theft efforts."
I just told the wife and daughters dinner is on daddy tonight!
that Tusa fellow has been 100% wrong and just doesn't give up. he will eventually and then will have some kind of excuse.
People should be buying like crazy......GE is coming out of The ICU.
Vote No; on the reverse split!
Tusa obviously digging in his heals. We should already be at $15. Buy.
"Red, red and red again. See you at $4."
On the way to $16 by the time hummingbirds roll around.
GE is a top Biden Infrastructure stock. Probably headed for $20. :-)
"Bottom line, when earnings come around GE will price itself accordingly. Hoping that GE truly is on path for renewed success and profitability."
why stop at 8? let's do a 1 to 20 reverse split
Stephen Tusa can ya hear me now!?! Haha
thanks GE for screwing your investors ; first by cutting the dividend now you pull an end around reverse ? You are worse than a SPAC at this point ...
Wow! so great to see my portfolio today . Watching GE negate thousands of dollars of gain from other stocks because of a seemingly reckless decision that is baffling even CNBC analysts... just couldn't leave well enough alone.. strating to understand why this stock had been in the crapper for years.......
Buy and HOLD is the only way we go up!!! The paid Russian bot bashing comments here are proof of it
There dumping their shares already . Reverse stock split are stock price killers
strong 1pc green in AH.
Where’s Tusa hiding?
Break $14 GE GOOOOOOOOO
"The literally own CNBC and could get on air within seconds and stop this bleeding, but instead their drawing out a conversation regarding the virus."
Looks like today is payday. Congrats to all of us long here.
Underwear getting real tight for ole cowboy... 5 tics up in after hours doesn’t mean much... .. or does it for Monday?HEHEHEHEHE
"Looks like analytics cannot read properly. In WSJ it was clearly said it is a MERGER, not sale, to build the biggest aircraft leasing company in the world. Probably this is a manoeuvre to lower the price deliberately"
Today is an excellent day to add now that the weak hands are being pushed out of the way. It's the day for the strong hands to hang in there and add. We have a good CEO that will lead us in the right direction.
cramer was right ford better buy then GE....
I could have bought my coveredd call back for pennies. And got out at 14 . This split is sinking the stock. Even if it works it will be years before it return to and equal of 14 . We believed in Culp. Not I think he cammed us.
I remember when the same thing was happening with this stock at $10.69 on February 1st.
This company can barely generate 50 cents of free cash flow. Worth 10.....Reverse split coming.
"Short show up with different name every single day They are loosing, big time They do not realize Tusa is almost ready to change his mind he starts saying positive about Ge Do not underestimate the power of earning FCF"
"I just booked 4 different RTs on United. I’ll be vaccinated. I’m traveling. And I haven’t even booked my European trip yet, my golf trip to Scotland or my trip to Bali yet."
Same Ole song and dance!!
"Another painfully low volume, extremely disappointing day for GE. The “big guys” just aren’t buying GE’s turn around plan."
Any $0.10 up move on a day is an opportunity to short (day trading)..
"after the holidays last month horrific rise in new cases of covid 19 , restrictions in place, us vaccinated 10% ? of its population. latest count, numbers increasing.travel on the mind of many.culp, your investors would like to hear from you. general market swings, nice environment for traders"
GEeeeeee watch me be $100 stock.
"Let’s crack it!! GE can hardly loose anyhow with health care and renewables ! Let’s move it, good for technical leadership and the country !!"
"Spanish renewable power retailer Capital Energy has ordered GE turbines for its 39-MW Loma de los Pinos wind farm project in Andalusia, its first in Spain’s southern region.The company plans to invest over EUR 36 million (USD 43.6m) in the project. Construction at the site in the municipality of Lebrija, Seville province, started in early December 2020 and is expected to last for about a year."
"WOW, nice comeback."
"GE managers aren't stupid. Yesterday's information on AerCap for this action would mean + $ 2. It's not convenient for big boys. Therefore, information about the split appeared. The course collapsed. When the options expire, it will move up. And no one will remember the split."
AA’s 737 MAX engine failed two day’s led to emergency land. It is good that no casualties happening during this emergency landing. Could this lead 737 MAX temporary suspension to fly again?
"lawsuit dismissed on friday, now watch CULP move ahead with another m&a deal, over $12.50 next week"
"Did you guys see the volume in the jan 15 strike 12 calls today? WOW over 35,000 already. Some are pretty sure this ends the week way over 12 bucks."
The hedge funds may be looking at GE as a leveraged buyout......
Up over 5% so far in 2021.
Unreal this finished up...
"For mutual fund is a good deal. Also, may increase dividends and become a value stock."
Why didn't you buy GME instead?
This could go back to 7.30 ish
"When all this money comes out of the market, where does it go? Bank CD's, Bonds, Real estate, cash in Purses & Pants pockets, new car and the like. Right.It wont stay out for long. No other good place for investment. Patience, won't be long."
The Cup and Handle pattern resembles a cup with a handle. They are continuation patterns and usually form in bullish trends. Most of these patterns are very reliable and offer great trading opportunities. They also form in all markets and in all time-frames.

There’s only 9 billion shares of this ongoing fraud. The sec again didn’t do there job 200& million fine. They should be restating all those yrs this is a ponzi any other company would be at 1$ a wels notice usually results in bankruptcy. Ge will be there soon enough. Fraud was committed for many yrs nobody gets in trouble. That earnings report was horrible who’s the dummy’s that bought this up 12% should have fallen glad I sold my puts yesterday
What did you investors learn from the GE’s outlook meeting?
MAYBE JJ IS TUSA HIDING UNDER JJ LOL
"it go down because humans only think of GE a commerical airline(s) laiden with debts and no way out - locked down and restrictions. GE is a buy for long term, may be 2 to 3 years. may be 2022. it will never be go up and go up and never come down, there are so many compnay to buy, GE is just one of them, there are so many company to lose your money, GE may be one for short term."
Great buying opportunity
AT LEAST IT SHOULD GO DOWN TO $12.50 TO CLOSE THE GAP THANK YOU LORD FOR FOR $13.30 SHORTED MORE
Shorts don't have the Donald to save them. Do you think Lying Joe cares about the stock market?
"JJ was calling for 9 dollars a bit earlier. What he really meant to say is: I see upside of 9 dollar for GE, so we will see 20 dollars by January next year. :)"
"yahoo ge average target raised again by a few pennies to 12.24i still like ge, an occasional trade until culp announces some action to give this stock the push we are looking for."
hahahaha 13.13 will be 14.14
"No one knows who GE is anymore. We need a corporate cheerleader or two who can tell the world how wonderful our aircraft engines are, how great our medical products are, how outstanding our huge windmills are etc. Likewise they must explain that the junk with the GE name - washer/dryers, light bulbs, kitchen refrigerators/stoves are NOT made by GE. Let's get our name off of these immediately! Jack Welsh PHD (bless his soul) would emphasize quality, technical magic, beauty, and reliability coming from our doors, and make sure the world knows. Then he would quietly adjust the corporate financial reports reflecting the effect of these maneuvers and split the stock by 2 to 1 every couple years.I believe Mr. Culp could learn all this in a year or two."
$4 remains our target. Long live Tusa and Markopolos
"Early morning sweep the stops, then the near limits before $12. Given the news we should break through the ceiling soon, then comes $15."
Well two fast money traders said to buy Ge tonight
GE is the 2nd largest holding in TRowe Price Capital Appreciation fund. The manager David Giroux is a genius at buying value. This alone has given me confidence in the turnaround and pushing in a lot of my chips.
"All you #$%$ who think $GE is going under must have very little understanding of what the next 10 years will look like for clean energy manufacturing. GE has the a lot of skin in the game compared to these new electric companies who haven't even produced a dollar, let alone build much assets.... We are still up 3% on the month... in the middle of a pandemic... check back on this stock in a year and tell me if I was wrong"
"Indexes have a big gain, our GE didn’t move much. People are moving away to growth stocks again, buying these high flying conceptual stocks again for quick money. They are no patients to waiting for traditional stocks such as GE."
lot of buying last few minutes of trading day! Down a few pennies after hours!
A division with $36B in assets is merging to make a company worth $30b? Does that make any sense?

I think I will vote NO on the stock split.
"Some people will have a bad day, buying back their short shares. Nice. "

you do all realize that ge was in process to sell to the China ccp
"Longs are so happy today, they will not lose any money."
I owned GE when they spun off Synchrony. I never got a share of SYF. So I dumped....no gain but no loss. Glad I got out. Recently I was considering getting back in to GE. Now the RS announcement....NOPE...I'm staying out of this. Total disrespect to shareholders so they can make the share price nice.
"I am long with GE since 6.50 but I have a feeling its going to get beat down tomorrow. Its ok, hold the line, this is going up up up."

Denver 777 Engine Failure was a Pratt and Whitney PW4077. That’s going to be about it for this engine. Airlines will replace all of them with GE engines. Don’t fly on a plane using the PW4077.
GE’s Cash Surprise Is Better Than Bonfires PastBut “surprise” is still the key word in its earnings. You just don't see such dramatic swings at other manufacturers.
"Expect Larry to step out a little more and harness the momentum. Difference between him and the next CEO , he backs it up in a very large way."
5% reversal in the last hour??? WOW!
Next bounce coming.
Reverse split puts you at $104 per share. Then it drops to $60 - $80 range for fund managers to scoop up shares before moving higher.
expect this haircut to take us back to 10 and change...the institutions will wait for a solid bottom of a week or so before adding to portfolio.. i don't see a lot of price drop post split
"I’m reading a lot of disappointment in the operational availability of F-35s. I’m not sure if it is due to the design, or poor reliability of supplier assemblies. The pavement to F-15EX, and other less costly operations, like Skynet drones is going to be getting a lot more attention."

"$GE is still selling at a deep discount, I buy it because it has real value, and great growth potential. $GE to $24+ this year!"
A lump in the shorts shorts
GE is up over 17% so far THIS YEAR!!
Unions are still eating GEs lunch profits. They wrecked aircraft engines in several locations before and are making a fortune selling coffee and donuts lol. Its true!
14 by Friday? Amazing run up. I am going to standby and watch. Been holding since 2017 13.25 average. Glad to see shares positive
When will the reverse split take place
stop selling its will go up to the moon........... BUT STOP SELLING AND YOU CAN BY MORE
Would be beautiful if GE started running up fraudulently like like GME. FCEL PLUG etc

"GE is great at manipulating the numbers. So, sure the earnings and revenues will be above expectations.Don't be surprised if it jumps up $5 and may go above $20/share. Long term prospects not so rosy!If that happens - Sell!!"

"If this Garbage-Enterprise did not do the bone headed move of RS, it would be 15+. Also, if it ends red today, it shows no investor confidence. Look out. I am still scratching my head to understand what's the rush to RS when momentum is unstoppable. Cost investors a lot of money. I hope shorts will take it down to single digits. RS split is gold mine for shorts."

They also made a deal with Saudi Arabia. Just Google it. U.S. technology and engineering conglomerate GE said on Saturday it had signed $15 billion of business deals with Saudi Arabia as part of the kingdom’s drive to diversify its economy beyond oil.From May 20 2017
stop selling let go up over 1270 you dnot need to buy but dnot sell who is with me?
"Take a deep breathAnd then look at the 1 month and 3 month chartsThis brings GE down...but the trend is still solidly trending up even with today’s dropIm taking a beating on my calls, but I’m still holding them. I think this will recover in the next week."
If GE was financially strong and growing it would be buying back its stock. But it's not and the outlandish amount of shares outstanding is ridiculous. You think GE is going to be attractive to the small investor at $ 130 per share. ? And there will still be billions of shares outstanding.
Looks like GE might retest $12 again. The option holders of 66000 contract calls might want to make a push GE stock to pass $12 today. Can it be successful?

I hate reverse splits no matter why they happen..... not good
if the Reddit people get hold of this stock - shorts look out. I would not want to be short this stock right now. this could so very easily to to 20 in the blink of an eye. truly (IMHO) this is not the time to play the short game right now. just cover your shorts and get out for a while until the buying frenzy subsides; maybe in a year or two. those little people in Reddit can do a lot of damage to hedge fund short sellers right now. just not worth it to my way of thinking. Reddit is the iceberg and short sellers are the titanic. just my opinion folks!!!
$GE Reiterated by Cowen Hold USD 10 Downgrades Oppenheimer Holdings Perform Target Raised by Deutsche Bank Hold USD 13 » USD 14
Has anyone heard from Tusa... I am wondering if he still got a job !!
I feel like Tusa is pulling string to get the stock down. Each time it is something different. I get the Power situation and negative cash flow. GE is heads strong on fixing it and letting other areas (aviation and healthcare) move along with not as much overseeing from Culp.Last week every where I read it was the true winner of Paris Air is GE!! Bullish comments from several.Tusa comes out and says aviation may be valued at under $40 billion and not 100 billion and negativity about Aviation.I feel now he is trying anything possible to get this to drop to $5.Even Inch who I am not a fan of has not made negative comments in past few months other than keeping his $7 target. he at least said GE will not go insolvent.
"Nokia Battle raging on...more than 60 million shares premarket !! Some profit taking, rest: cold sweat for shorties!!!"
@Nasir - You will soon own 1/8 the amount of GE stock that you own now!Standing ovation for the reverse split!
Why a reverse split. Is it to save four cent a share from div .it makes no sense .
Be ready for an upgrade on price target tomorrow - I see this hitting $13+ in the coming days. Free cash flow and beating expectations. 
This is the kind of decision that takes the company down the toilet 1/8 RS are they comparing GE to Apple  GE stock should drop $2 then they can do 1/8 RS.
"Never a good idea to link a CEO salary to the market share value of their company because it opens up room for shady accounting practices and mass layoffs which means those workers left will be overworked , underpaid and under appreciated."

"sell ,end of the world is coming , sell ."
I assume we are to be selling into this rally and buying back next week at lower prices? Is that how we play it? Lol
Do not vote for the reverse split.
Do you think Mr Culp gets his well-deserved bonus this year or next year?
"GE needs to get their debt under control, prove their worth, and get the stock up to $30 first before doing a RS. Earn your RS and prove it to investors first."

Motley Fool released GE is going heavy into renewable energy that’s going to take it sky rocketing
Tesla is a prime candidate to buy GE for $36 per share in Tesla stock. Musk has his own super inflated currency called Tesla stock. What better time for Musk to buy real assets? Think about it.

CNBC just announced Mr. Tusa is coming up this morning to discuss GE...
"great sale of another division, huge $$$$dollars adding to the large war chest, CULP will soon do a acquisition when stock breaks above $12"
Reminder to All...March 5 is Ex-Dividend date. Purchasers get the dividend if they own GE prior to date. And Shorts have to PAY the dividend if they still hold short position. 
"Wow, we are at $11.99. It will pass $12 with a little bit push. We have a chance pass $12 or close at $12."
"GE is one of the highest tech companies in the US. Everything from medical Xray, ultrasound, MRI and CT scanners. GE generators power 1/3 of the world's electrical grid. They're building those green energy wind farms everyone loves... yes 55% of airplanes use GE engines and they aren't doing a lot of flying right now... but this sort of high tech engineering has long duration product life cycles. This isn't something simple like cloud computing for storing your email & photo album or delivering packages..."
My Vxrt up a lot today. Pill covid vaccine news coming out soon. GE should be heading toward $20 also.
Too many have been disappointed and burned by GE in the past! Don't expect a sudden move consistently up!Respect and trust that has been lost takes time to rebuild. Fact is GE is only expected to earn 25 cents/share for all of 2021!! If it rises to $15 to 20 ----SELL!!!
"Maybe GE should spin off their wind turbine business to shareholders. GE’s competition’s stock trades for over $1,000 per share. One share of GE Turbine for every 10 GE shares you own? OK."

I hope everyone is seeing what I am. Opportunity to short this! This is sinking like The titanic!!
"In a piece about the stocks recent performance and things potentially weigh, ask yourself why there would be zero mention of the announcement of a 1 for 8 split. They address every other mjr topic Culp mentioned last week, except the 1 for 8 RS. I mean it's such a great thing for the value of the stock... pimp that news. Unless they want to minimize that, get the price up before the RS is implemented and get out. https://www.barrons.com/articles/ge-still-favorite-for-bulls-despite-stock-drop-51615826006?siteid=yhoof2"

If this reverse split was such a great idea the stock would be trading at a minimum of 15. I am short and will maintain it after the split whenever that is

R/S is just another trick companies that cannot make their pps go up use to hide their long term subpar performance........... GE is a 19th century company..........
"here is tusa for those looking up to him ............…investors business daily …………….But a long-time GE bear, JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa, was unmoved and reaffirmed an underweight rating on GE stock.After GE earnings, he said business fundamentals ""are not too dissimilar"" from his view earlier in the year. Meanwhile, he finds strong GE Aviation results ""hard to explain, with 19% profit growth on a 6% sales increase.""for investors here, my suggestion … try to do your own analysis.with the average analyst only getting it right approx. 50% of the time ............your chances are quite good to outperform........."
"GE sold 38.01 mln Baker Hughes shares on Friday, worth $735.06 mln"

Amazing how many people misinterpret reverse splits.
"Tusa wants to keep his reputation, he needs to be on the right side of GE history."
After two years of holding this garbage stock I cut my loses today and off to better opportunities. Today is a good day!
