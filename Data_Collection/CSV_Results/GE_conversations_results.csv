Recent headlines and conversations for GE
GE lots of good news
"GE expects a ""pronounced"" aviation services recovery in 2021. Looking good ahead.Show me the money..."
WOW!! The 1 year chart makes me want to have a vessel full of some beverage 
"$15 real soon ,plus a CULP announcement"
"I will tell you, very sad and disappointed at the board's recommendation of reverse split. That will definitely benefit the company but not share holders."
I don't like it. I've seen too many stocks dip after a reverse split. Sitting this one out.
Up .25 already and it’s a bad day in markets only because UBS upgraded to 15
Incredible set up here - significant news probably a week or two away just prior to earnings.
I personally like the news. Nothing has changed with the company. Why buy back stock when you don't have to spend money to reduce float? I'm a long term holder here. Most people can't see past 2 days. Bash away because I'm not selling!
Ge doing a reverse stock split ?
No valid case for the shorts here. GE is rocking.
Holding strong in a very red market. Momentum is still strong. Culp is getting GE back to glory. Will be over $20 by summer
"At $30 per share, GE promise windfall to investors. The only thing the fell was the stock price. Even the little wind drip called dividend was taken away. Lots of assets were divested and the money drifted away with the wind. Check your wallet, do you see any GE penny? nope."
"Hey jj Dewd, how did you like playing each other's skin flute last night?"
"Long time holders frustrated. Good news I’m here now, been buying an accumulating. ;) $1.2m. This puppy easy hits $20. Shorts don’t be haters, you had a great run from 2017-2020. Don’t marry your position."
I knew I should have sold above 12.00 for a tiny profit... greed
At what price should I take the bait?
"Analysts say, that new President will increase corporate income tax, which will be a burden for GE. Will check losses carried forward from GE...can not believe that this will have any short or mid term impact. But I wait for budget for renewables. This will have impact !!"
So Barons is still quoting Tusa who has been downgrading the company from it low of 5.48. The stock has gained $50 billion in market in sync with his downgrading. And to think he is making a 6 figures income with bonuses.
microsoft was split many times and the stock went up. . the board of ge is doing the opposite. i think it is better to kick the face of the members of the board who proposed reverses split.
this has to be manipulation.
RS will knock jj out and chicken  for ever
Great if Berkshire added GE after Munger endorse
Reddit could make GE $200. IN ONE DAY.
Will break $10 next month...
Morgan Stanley just put on a very bullish call on GE
$13.75 at open!
"GE share holders this is your Captain speaking. First I would like to take time to thank all those Long's for Holden we just been cleared from the holding pattern we will be clearing from our present altitude of $13 to $13.5 and then we are cleared by ATC to expect further clearance around $14. Once again my crew and I thank you again for believing in GE products. IMHO, GLTA the Looooongs."
GE management is just like Lucy
Uptick in Clown activity detected.
It is time for the dividend to be increased!
"Im wondering why people are selling out of GE right now, this stock should be going through the roof since finding out about them selling their jet side to AERCAP....!"
"You can tell by the volume that Wall Street wants GE collared. Be patient, the street is living in the past. Buy."
"30 yr. stock holder, stuck with it thru last 3 ceo s. Im tired of being lied to . Imelt should be in jail, he misled investors with every move he made, hiding all the losses, with crazy accounting no one could understand and selling pipe dreams. Every deal he ever made lost billions. (Some have called him a visionary -REALLY?) Was GE ever going to be an Tech Leader, He bought energy co. when oil is out , over paid on losing locomotive industry and did not get the pieces he was after, but could not man up and walk away from the deal. Culp is not any different its all about the stock options. They give up a salary and make millions and millions in stock options and bonuses, which years ago was given for increased PROFITS and higher stock prices. Co. execs and directors win, stock holders lose again!!"
GE’s pentup demand is huge. Buy any dips. This is a gift.
Can't wait for tomorrow! 
"GE Renewable Energy said Monday it has signed contracts with Orsted North America to provide its Ocean Wind offshore wind farm off Atlantic City with its 12 MW turbines and to service and warranty them for five years. They are the largest and most powerful turbines in the world, and will first be deployed by Orsted at its Skipjack farm off Maryland..."
"OH GOD 50,000 SHARES WANT TO GET OUT AT 12.57 LAST MINUTE SELLING HARD"
A more than 6 percent drop on big up day shows what investors think of this split. What are they thinking?
Looks like the board has no faith in GEs turnaround. Pricing GE with other companies at about 110 billion in market cap. What a joke!
"Big Pension Bought Up Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, and GE Stock"
Should close back up
Steady climb to upwards of around $12 seems highly likely.
"RBC, BArclays, DB raise the PT on GE.Go figure"
"low volume - I think the ;ow volume is a good sign because GE has lost a lot of short sellers. Any rational person knows we are speeding to the end of the pandemic. Today on the tv Scott Gottleib, on Pfizer board said pfizer has doubled the shots they are producing.A lot of the shots will be give to most people wanting them by April 1st after which there will be an oversupply of the pfizer, madera, etc immunization for all the others left.The stock is moving 20% last week up from 2 weeks ago showing a int struggle between two camps one betting long and the other betting short.The reduced volume tells me the bets downward re softening and it is just plain hesitancy now keeping the optimism from the stock rocketing to unsupportable levels.Better t wait for the obvious good upcoming news.What fool would be down on GE at this stage.On the other hand, there is nothing concrete until the 1st quarter results are announce in April.So thestock may move into the $12-$13 range but not for any real news.If any good news like a giant new wind contract comes out - the stock will shoot upward.Lackin news - the stock will keep trading sideways.."
Share holders get SCREWED again. I bought GE at $50.00 my wife and I got out heads handed to us. The just gets worse and worse with every passing year.
stock could be very close to a surge above $20
what is up with the announcement of a $.01 dividend? Is $.01 better than no sense?
GE management’s turnaround strategy...
GE crash stock thx culp
"GE is on sale people... it’s not a quick fundraiser, buy and hold and you’ll be happy."
I was planning to buy more GE as soon as I could raise more cash. Now I'll wait till after the reverse-split for the inevitable dip. Same thing happened to me with SCR recently. It's all psychological.
"Wave coming ? Who sold 6-7% below last closing this morning unless you have to ? GLTA, we will make it !!!"
Here comes the friday sell offSour hour is gonna be PAAAAAAAAINful
go ge! 13
this drop at the end of the day is not meanigful tomorrow at 11 to 12 that is the likely run down until late monday.
Does GE have plans for higher dividends?
Tusa of JPM is no better thanThese hedge funds shorting and destroying companies. Tusa is still trying to bring GE down
The Georgia runoffs should be the Green light for GE to buy EOSE......and become a huge player in Green Energy. GE needs to do this before Tesla gobbles them up. Electricity Storage will be a multi-trillion dollar market.
Thanks GE
"Lots of good news, nice work, this stock still likes $12"
https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/companies/healthcare/2021-01-26-ge-upbeat-over-2021-outlook-after-free-cash-flow-beats-estimates/
Honestly why would management ruin the stocks best momentum in years? It was on a clear uptrend!
GE GE GE GE GE GE THAT'S ALL I EVER HEAR
"Watch the selling increase as the ""West coast"" retail investors wake up and begin to realize how GE is cutting them out with a 1-8 reverse split. Give it another hour or so and we'll see this in the low $12.00's."
I see you’re slipping down in price over here a little bit some of y’all gonna be sad in the morning
"I might be wrong and hate to say it. The funds that bought in are slowly taking Ge down. I hope I'm wrong but this slow declining drip could go on for a couple of months if not longer. if market tanks, who knows when it will bottom out!!!!"
"General Electric (NYSE:GE).Binger said that as the company gets smaller the market is going to love it more. He is worried about the stock price because it has doubled from the bottom and the company has given an EPS guidance that was slightly below the consensus. He would not be a buyer at the current price level and he would wait for lower prices.Tatro is also not a buyer because there are too many other options out there. The company is shedding businesses in segments that are finally starting to turnaround, said Tatro. Even though it looks cheap on many metrics, investors should stay away, added Tatro."
Sorry to all who panicked and sold. I’m sure you guys will get an opportunity next time
"For a man like Culp, I do not ever believe he makes this amateur mistake on a good news day to announce RS. There has to be other motives. Either way, retail investors got giant up the hole without lube. I hope shorts will take this thing back to 7. (I do not do short game)."
"Buy GE, Ford!! god bless america"
Rocketing to $12............
Here we go!
Bought this beeatch at $6.75. Measly 4000 shares. But damn! It’s become my best performing stock in a while now. Don’t see a let up either. $20 a share by Easter. $50 by Christmas
Hold your shares. The momentum has just started. I’m very happy to invest in GE because they care 200% for the business. Bright days ahead of us
I am out. I don't like reverse split.
"Quite sure that GE will Spinn Off business units, like Siemens did. GE Energy & GE Healthcare would be the result, whilst Finance and Aviation would remain.Don’t see GE buying lookalikes like FuelCell...EPS are (still) lousy and share price simply too high. Also here -hydrogen world- I see cooperations to happen like Siemens Energy will cooperate with AirLiquide for a new generation of electrolyzers. So it will be very interesting...."
GE To Build 20 Engines For CH-53K | DoS Approved GBU-39 Sale To Saudi Arabia | Philippine Navy’s Frigates Gets Its Missiles in October 2021
You Dopes on this board seem to think bull markets last forever... this market is 4 years overdue for a massive sell off
"Tusa, who has always been right about GE, knows what time it is and maintains his $5 price target on GE."
The retail investor need to send a message to GE Management to Reverse Their decision on the reverse split!! This move cannot happen!! Its will bankrupt them!!!
Breaking the 12 barrier will happen very quickly. Everybody loves a comeback story. Lots of press on GE
GE long-term call options cheap and attractive; look @ 1/21/22--$20 Call options!
I promise you all GE is the next GME. We will see $100 by next week. I promise you all.
"The Culp/GE year begins, the higher the price of stock the more M&A you'll see CULP do,, then aggressive buybacks will start with more deals $35 real soon"
"ge speaking up adds some excitement,expected earnings for this quarter 2 cents per share,what does culp see going forward is the determining factor here"
If you people think a reverse split is good news you have no business investing..
a 1 for 8 reverse split ......... wow especially at this point of the gamedividend upped or staying at 1 penny \ sharea game changer for many and reevaluating our reasoning why we are hereseems culp is looking out for geinvestors need to look out for investor returns
"With all the emotions about GE, what about GM ?Both Americana history!"
"hedge funds trading, all are 10k plus order. dang it."
"Someone posted yesterday they were disappointed in the transaction with AER as GE was giving up GECAS. That is simply not the case. The amazing thing about the transaction is it pretty much leaves GECAS and GEs ability to generate cash flow from it the same. GE is getting 46% of a company, AER, that earns right now roughly $1 Billion per year. I tried to do some research on GECAS and the last thing I found was from 2018 when they said they earned roughly 1 billion. Assume that 1 billion carries to the new entity which would get AERs profit to 2 billion so GE will still be earning roughly 1 billion from it's 46% stake in AER and will have reduced its debt by $24 billion. This appears to be a rather ingenious transaction for GE.Also, Tusa is a liar. He said this adds 21 billion of debt to industrial GE. As the GE board member said yesterday GE Capital has 10 billion in cash which also comes over so the net debt is already down to 11 billion and then they will also own half of a company with a 15 billion market cap. Tusa must have known this when he reiterated his $5 price targe."
I don’t think we’re done today. I wouldn’t be surprised if we go $13.50+ by EOD
"i do not see the spy hoing much higher than 383, in fact i see a problem above 381. But, GE I can see going up to 12.29"
GE is creeping up. Could surprise us.
Should ge buy gamestop?
Another post for on BARRON'S usually means an up tick tomorrow
GE... what an explosion of flavor..... good luck to longs and may the PPS always be in your favor.. Damn.... so glad I loaded up and over weighted the truck on this one at 6 and change... made more than I make for two years of work.... so this is how the Wallstreet guys make money.... they take others peoples money
Why would GE want to RS? That wouldn’t that put their share price at 90+?
Expect a sell off earnings day... everything is already baked in. Sell the news... Mark this post
up up and away.....
I can see GE will use half of the $30B to buy back 2B shares of their stock. Trimming down 20% of outstanding shares to match the new GE.
"Don’t care about this news, I’m holding!"
good job Larry
Is it asking to much to turn green in the next 8 minutes.
"When you don't have the capital to do a share buyback, you screw the retail investor with a reverse split"
Do shareholders have to approve this split?
Rise in to earnings begins Tuesday - looking for significant news by weeks end - GE been pretty quiet of late and pre-earnings is typically the time to unleash big PR.
To the moon  GE..!
This too shall pass...reasons we original bought GE are still there and even better now than last year...new buyers coming in now will not sell until it moves higher than current price. PS...if board reverses and decides against the RS...we could see the opposite of what just happened pretty dramatically...just MHO.Best to all GE Investors.
HOPEFULLY GE DIVIDEND GOES UP TO 10 CENTS PER SHARE PER YEAR
"$10.85 closing? $0.40 intraday swing, if you can short at the peak around 10am.."
"This ceo will turn things around, give him time."
"Rebroadcast - In 29 days GE reports 2018 Q4 earnings and Larry Culp presents his turnaround plan containing how GE will deliver on the $420,000,000,000order backlog, the pension risk reduction of over $7,200,000,000 due to the Fed rate increases, the schedule for completing the Transportation sale to Wabtec and shares delivered to current GE share holders, the schedule for spinning off GE Healthcare and the shares delivered to current shareholders, the value of the resent Iraq Power deal ($15,000,000,000), and too many more positives to mention. The future is bright for GE."
"I do not think the GE management and its advisors are surprised at all today with the GE stock move down.And I agree with many posts saying about the same already:Reverse split would discourage retail investors looking for a higher quantity of ""affordable"" stock price entree and also of holding of the reversed split stock. It would also discourage day traders participation by loosing more of emotional retail investors and related stock volatility. The Retail fleeing will make room for lower stock price and ""noise free"" entree of additional institutional interest - this remains to be seen over time.I do not think Larry Culp would consider reverse split unless better days are coming up and unless he was advised to do so by institutional investors and analysts.I like the overall GE turnaround based on adaptability and futuristic plans. I also trust Larry and his flexibility. So I am going to hold the GE, likely for few more years. I will sell only if there would be a substantial, material reason(s) to do so, including GE and its stock going no where.Good luck to all!"
I don't like the overall market action the last couple days. GE is holding up pretty well all things considered but it would not surprise me to see us close right around 13.00 today given the number of open calls and puts that were sold at that level and expire today.
"Craig JonesSun, January 24, 2021, 4:54 PMTony Zhang of OptionsPlay suggested on CNBC's ""Options Action"" a bullish options trade in General Electric Company (NYSE: GE)."
General Electric is up 9.37% to 12.02
Sweet. GE upgraded! As vaccines take out covid air travel will EXPLODE this summer/fall.
Might be here around 13.50 for awhile. Love a good comeback story.
"Nice discount this morning that our predecessors created, time to buy the price back up and force them to cover up rearends ! $AG $GME $AMC $AG 45 MILL shares shorted, physical silver depleted, demand is high, SQUEEZE IS INEVITAVABLE, only here at $AG no other silver stock, here only ! $AG ( $GE $TLRY $APHA $SLV )"
TIME TO FLY!!
I picked up enough to make my holding a nice equally divisible by 8 number. 200 more at $13.10. Hope they say nevermind about the split and bounces right back.
An absolutely underrated company. Smart money has been flowing there for some time. It could be a hit in 2021. Still cheap. I recently bought $ 12.5. I'm counting on $ 20 - eoy. If it drops or starts consolidation - I plan to buy more. As long as this company has a CEO - Larry Culp - I'm calm.
Peace y’all have fun see yea when it in red
GE BULLISHER NEED TO GET OUT TO SAVE YOUR EQUITY -- TAKE PROFIT LIKE ME AND DO NOT BE A VICTIM OF REVERSE SPLIT :)
Add @Tim to the low life numbers.
Do you think GE will get a new CEO soon?
GE is AMD 4 years ago - nice bullish hammer today on the bounce - looking for $12 SOON!
Just hold guys. Slow and steady wins the race.
"jj shorted at 6.25, people. LOL. Don't believe his lies."
Common grandma needs this stock to go up! Grandma needs a new pair of knickers! Grandma been holding since 92'
outpacing my expectations the speed its taking on. no complains here lol
Just bought 1000 puts for next week...if this is a blood bath than this will reward me well!
"Mr. Larry Culp has done an admirable job of bringing General Electric out of the pits. At this time, I believe our company is no longer in danger of demise. His expertise, business acumen, and educational background has enabled him to deliver this to us.As a shareholder, I would like for him to add one more thing to his impressive resume. I believe doing this would add the pizzazz which would accelerate GE's rise to stardom again. In my opinion, the addition of PHD in Engineering or Physics to his list of Business accomplishments would be appropriate. He's still a young man, very smart and we would certainly be happy, as his colleagues, to see this. Pick his school MIT, Purdue, Cornell many others."
We’re going to $20. It’s just a matter of time
It wants to climb higher OMG. I am just smiling seeing this happen. $15 soon
Has Tusa made any comments today?
are GE investors going to get some aircap shares?
ge was on a good recovery..i don't know why they would go for a reverse split??????
"My account is up over 7% today, mostly from GE $13 calls"
GE is BACK!! It's hard not to be romantic about stocksl
Big volume on this sell off. hehe
I thought I was on the Tesla board by mistake!
"We will celebrate 25 by Y/E. Bought in the 6's. ""Oh Happy Day"" when?"
"12*8=96，To buy in an eps 0.25, No way"
And we rise 6.96% (so far today) ...Not bad for a 1 day return ! :)
so GE hide their intention for the 1-8rev split in a big deal announcement
Hard to comprehend that GE was $6 6 months ago. We had a nice run.
Using the dip to add more. Remember GE is the early recovery stage. Accumulating while it’s stock strength is at weak. This provides long term investors another opportunity. It will go back above $14 in one month!
Seems Bill Gates is under GE!
"What GE really needs to do to re-ignite its growth engine is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for GE (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if GE just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

Sell sell sell
GE’s major competitor in Wind Turbines gets a PE of 300 from the market. Maybe spinning off this business to shareholders would unlock value.
the market is waisting time it shoul start moving up so the sale iff comes st the end of the day into yhe lste oart of friday to rally again on the opening on monday. mY OPINION
"hey guys, go ahead and sell. And buy tomorrow morning, today is not a good day for Ge. the market is not on our side"
"How much did GE pay for the BKR shares? Just like a GE investor wanting to ""cash out"" for another massive loss. Has anyone actually figured out what this company does anyhow? Oh right, it rips investors off and gives big bonuses to upper management. Just like it always has."
to the moon!!!
Just got out @ 13.26 with around $1K profit.... this will sink further!
"Premarket is down. I am a bit surprised considering the stimulus. If the volume goes up, the price should make a jump but everyone seems to be sitting on the sidelines for now"
Who is doing all this Buying..? Buffett?
Fasten seat belts. Heading to 12 before end of Fiday.
GE falling into pieces to pay its debts
aviation slowly picking up again
GE and WIMI were both up about 10% in premarket.
"Win some, lose some. So long to my jan 11.50 calls :("
"volume 80 m today , still not back to average"
Thanks a lot Mr. CULP. It sure was not expected from you....The hell with the board suggestion. Don't you guys have financial advisers to check things out before coming out and announcing something that's not even thought about ? VERY VERY VERY BAD MOVE.....hopefully you have an explanation for this and hopefully you make an announcement ASAP before whipping out more of GE market cap.....we have already dropped from $130B to near $100B and going down further if you delay.... Who ever on the board made such suggestions need to be investigated for his intent....totally ridiculous idea and suggestion and on top of all announcement at such a crucial point..................STUPIDITY HAS NO LIMIT...analysts have already started to downgrade ...Thanks a lot for ignoring your faithful share holders
"if you buy GE at 5/6 dollars - you already make yourself a billionaire in just a year - it has doubled - it may go back to 9 dollars, if so sell at 11.20 buy it back at 9 - what can be wrong ??if you buy GE with 1 billion, you now have 2 billion (5 dollars to 11 dollars)if you buy GE and pay 1 dollar, you now have 2 dollars.what is that you do not understand ? - should you be here day trade with your hard earned money ???"
I hope GE takes it out of the park on Thursday
I don’t really want Apple to Buy GE.......I want Apple to just make a $22 per share Bid for GE........and see what happens.
Will hit 12.50 this week
MMs took it down today. The news lets them back in at a better price.
Huge one year cup and handle. Get ready for a pop after earnings!

"I have had the misfortune of owning several stocks that did reverse splits, and in every case it ended badly. Maybe this time is different."

Slow and steady creeping up based on strong fundamentals. Go GE Go!!!
"they are doing story after story of positive spin all day long on MSNBC about GE. of course GE owns NBC, so....... gimme a break"
Don't Worry...Be (Really) Happy! 
I was going to sell this #$%$ and buy some F the other day when they were the same.
Meanwhile GME up another +75%
What is going on?
Bullish again $1
One way to get a 12.20 stock to 100 and make bad earnings numbers look better with less shares.
Expect Industrial free cash flow to be at least $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. The earnings will be released in 1/26/2021. GE will deliver positive cash flow and profit in 2021.
"Culp, in discussing the RS, in passing said that the current float ""puts it out of reach of peers and competitors"" or words very similar to that. I definitely heard ""out of reach."" If he was not just making a verbal typo for ""out of line with,"" or the equivalent, this could be an indication that he and the board are thinking about the practical use of GE stock in structuring M&A transactions. If that's true, the RS may have more to do with preparing to ""play offense"" in the future than I've heard discussed so far, and not as much to do with window dressing. Thoughts?"
will see $12 next week
Don't Worry...Be Happy !

"When JJ spouts wisdoms like -- ""greediness is cancer"", ""dumb and greedy chase high"" -- you know he is not able to afford his beluga for the day... JJ - did you miss the boat today? How is your round trip doing?"
The United Airlines failed engine from Denver was a Pratt & Whitney: PW4077. Rest easy. There shouldn't be a gap down on Monday.
SHORT SQEEEZZZZEEEE this one to $150 next ... lol -- News media doesn't understand a short squeeze.
Looking forward to the great stock market collapse of 2021. GLTA
NO volume. 8.9 BILLION outstanding. Figure it out.

"You want to own General Electric Company (NYSE: GE), said Cramer. He sees the stock at $15 if it gets orders from Boeing. Travel has to start for Boeing orders to happen, he noted."
DRYS shipping reverse split only 7 times before delisting... UNG only reverse split only 5 times.. to name a few. Reverse splits only temporarily benefit failing companies.... scamming and destroying investors.
Sideways movement with very slight increase......prime for a pop!!
Boeing goes up GE goes down
"Smokescreen to make it look like a healthy, investable stock. Could reach this level in a couple years anyway (with great vision and greater management)."
"GE Still at 2008 lows, Close to March Lows, but sitting on CASH $$100 BILLION & LIQUIDITY, HIGH MARGIN REVENUE OF $$$90 BILLION, Headed back to $$12bn TO $$15 BILLION PROFITS.. GE HEALTHCARE GROWING, GE AVIATION GROWING, GE RENEWABLE GROWING.. GE SO SEVERELY UNDERVALUED.. No way I am selling at these dirt cheap price. If I sell, buy what BL0ATED P1GS OF China, FR@UD P1GS G@RBAGE OF CHINA, NO REVENUE BUT $$$90 BILLION Valued NIO..???GE REVENUE More than TSLA+NIO+QS+NFLX+ABNB+Grubhub COMBINED, Yet all of them combined valued at more than $$$1+ TRILLION Mkt value.."
"The selling is by those that feel GE is dead money, and can put their investments to better use; and there are those that feel GE will not make money now, and in the future (you see them in this conversation urging you to sell, so that is for personal gain, and might not be truthful); and there are those that feel Mr. Culp incapable of turning this BIG ship around ... . So far, Mr. Culp is doing fine and, unlike his predecessor, he appears know what is needed and will do it. I am long, as I feel Mr. Culp will continue to do a fine job."
"20 billion in market cap lost in 30 hours. Brilliant. Some store managers like to just cut hours and cut hours and cut hours, not realizing they're destroying customer service and satisfaction, thus reducing sales even further. Other managers look for ways to increase sales, which covers the labor, creates job satisfaction, providing good service. Both ways end up with the same EBITA. But hey, GE balance sheet looks pretty. The lost value in 2 days could have paid 2/3 of the aviation leasing company. And these people went to the finest schools our country has to offer?"
"Closes today $11.50, Tomorrow below $10.00!! But, giving your investors 1 share for every 8, great idea!"
"As stated b$4, no where to go but down. With 8 billion shares outstanding impossible to move this ship."
Low volume - head fake
No wonder Morgan said to buy lol
Existing shareholders will be chasing GE only to break even until they die. Only problem is they never will... This is an unbelievable move by Culp that has destroyed existing shareholders.
"Tusa still on $5 target. He has given Culp no credit whatsoever. This guy is just so painfully short on GE; pressure on GE is going to be bad for a while - he will never see the light. However, Culp did screw up on the RS I think."
King value stock GE going up. Where is Tusa?
@ 16:00:02 8.3m shares printed @ 10.99
it's all about what Larry says at earnings next week the 30th.
GE. has to many outstanding shares and day traders... simply no momentum
"There is no reason for a RS now that GE is starting to climb out of its hole. This recent sale was good but if the company can keep reporting decent earnings, the stock price will increase.It’s obvious that the CEO wants to screw the long time shareholders who have stuck with this company and put even more money in his pocket.It’s a disgrace."
If you trying to go long and strong this is the time to buy
"""Fundamental hasn't changed!"" is what everyone here says.Yes, a speculative fundamental that it will go up just because Boeing is going up. Why not buy Boeing instead then?The company is still covered in dept and hype for re-open was already priced in months ago.Being a bull on this stock has proven many people wrong for many many decades and it will be true until this company goes bankrupt."

"Hey BAGGIES, it's going to hit this number today. Nice short for me, but you will keep on holding back to single digits. GE post reverse split will be a 60 to 70 dollar stock. This equates to a current value of $4.80 to $5.60 per share. Right in line with Tusas numbers."
Tusa is not validated any since upside trend. Tusa was only validated when downside trend.
"""This exercise is a reminder that the Fed cannot forever shield the markets from the cost of financing Treasury debt growing faster than nominal GDP. For now, the economy enjoys below equilibrium interest rates, but high reserves and capital constraints more broadly means banks are not fully able to help others leverage growth through lending that these low rates would suggest,"" says Blitz."

Thats why is good to have some cash available. PANIC SELLING
Let's not forget this is Thomas Edison's old company--Thank you Larry Culp; your really doing it!
"GE behaved as it expected recently. Market makers and traders fighting each other heavily because of the option expiration today. Looks both side wins ; i.e, It trades between $13 to $13.7. It allows both sides to have opportunities to exit. Not like before, one side was in control. This is a good sign. This means GE will consolidate here and prepare for next up trend in near future. If you are waiting to get on the train, it would be great opportunity to load some shares when it traded under $13 temporarily such as this morning. Good luck to all."
Buy the dip
"board history has been overshooting targets,i am long, you go ahead and continue promising"
Looks like GE will reduce more workers to make GE leaner but more nimble going forward. Cutting more fat will help one move quicker and stronger.
could have a short squeeze on GE to 18......at least this is a real company
"All right all you BAGGIES, I'm going to repeat myself. How do you read GE's announcement of its improving cash flow from 26 January 2021? Since a firm's ability to pay dividends depends both on its earnings and cash flow, the rise of GE's cash flow during 2020-Q4 marks a potential turnaround for the long-troubled company. If sustained, GE will be able to afford a dividend rise.Is that what's going on here? Because if it isn't, the argument that shares of GE are becoming overvalued and its nearing time to sell becomes stronger if its shares are really trading within the vertical range they have since 2018. No dividend increase, is a sell signal. Shorts once again will win while BAGGIES are left holding the bag Any cash this business generates will be applied to GEs huge debt, and undeserved bonuses for Culp. Wake up and smell the Rose's, oh I mean the stench this company is reeking."
Another red day for GE!

Me and GE. Will be here for awhile. I don’t care.
"Proposing a reverse split is a ploy to tank the stock and make it attractive to institutional buyers, its a slap in the face to every small retail investor plane and simple! This is the worst thing GE could have done to their loyal investors, pure evil play."
Why do they want you to focus on debt reduction while GE has been issuing shares since 2018 while offloading assets? This is the same game played by Economou of DRYS which resulted in about 8 reverse splits before he took the company private.
"A) GE is not going bankrupt so just stop with that nonsense.B) Reverse splits will result in deteriorated value.C) Average people will not be able to buy at $104D) Once it gets that high, it will be shorted down to $50E) It is a lot harder to grow $104 to $208 than it is $13 to $26F) They may not ultimately do this because they do not have to."
What a disgraceful rigged and manulipated con game. All of the analyst upped their price rating to 14.00 to 17.00. The the reverse split news came after the Deal with Ireland Aircraft leasing co for 30 billion. What kind of CFO & Board will do that after the reverse split. It does not make sense..unless they have cheap options . Larry Culp will now get his 25 million cause the share price will be over 25.00.....He is a #$%$.. Vote NO NO on the R/S...it does not fix anything...
"Netwood I agree with you. this a good price to buy GE from 10 to 11, back ip the truck. As long as you are not making 500,000 dolkars a year taxing the tich does not apply if and when this tax laws are pass. . I still like other stocks to, LMT 333, KO 48 FDX 243, even VZ at 56."
Really another day down 3%+?
GE will be a beautiful story of 2021. Balance sheet continues to get better every quarter.Not many stocks currently offer low risk high reward like GE in my opinion....do your own dd.
"a reverse split means only more room to short it down, which the market will do..."
GE will be $13.75 tomorrow morning.
As long as the Feds keep rates low the higher the stock market will continue to rise. The day they make a rate change to the upside look out below!!

I am not jumping ship just before the rescue boats arrive... this is like expiring from Corona virus while the vaccine is here... carbon offset must be completed with wind generation and NG turbines.... boy this is active today.... my word on the split... it will make it more appealing to the street and thus good for PPS. High value stocks and the growth here spell higher PPS for GE... the rescue boat is here... GE will do fine... split will be sometime between 14 months. That is a long time for the current PPS to move.... Sorry for those who sold and jumped... you missed the boat

OH NO!!!! Reverse Stk Split....1 for 8
There is FEAR among shorts. Lots of FEAR.Shorts got Guillermo's 100% truthful catalyst post removed.EXTREME SHORT FEAR.Stay greedy my friends
SQUEEZE COMING...
Never forget people this is GE! A company that has burned its stock holders for decades and decades.That does not go away easily. How long did it take for people to forget the great depression of the 1930s?For generations no one wanted to buy stock. Same with GE. Investor sentiment is at all time lows with regard to GE. It takes time to fix that. GE results are no where close to changing our attitude.
GE is not your growth company that does stock splits to keep it available to retail investors and then splits again when the price keeps rising. GE went into the declining stage after years of obscene opulence and gross mismanagement. Culp has been a positive influence and I even put some money down for $5.60 a share after adding at $10. I figured to ride it as far as it would go before selling but this talk of a RS caused me to sell.
"Typical move for GE after earnings. Up, then down, then up - will likely finish up. May move up or down tomorrow and then the following days will be a net UP! The upward trend is certain to be up near term."
bought at $11.50... looking to hold for 6 months or more... what ya think???
OH GOD GE GOING UP TO 11.55 NOW GO GO GO REDDIT ARMY BRING ON SHORT SQUEEZE
"Sign of severe, forecasted weakness. What we wanted was a 2/1 split with the stock at 40. No way this is good for the current holders."
For those that are comparing reverse splits how many stocks only went down 5% on the day they announced it. Ive seen GE drop 5% on no news.
"there has been a lot of accounting f#ckery at ge over the last few years with all sorts of this and that charges, impairments etc..i would expect restatements down the road..."
"GE keeping strong the last month, 6 months, great to see. 15 by year end? Holding 12k+ @13.25"
This Reverse Split is part of The strategy to get GE back into the Dow Jones group. I wish they would level with shareholders the details of how that strategy would work and why it's important for the company. Hope that transparency will be forthcoming soon.
What they are doing is reducing the share count then they will issue shares to raise capital and reduce debt. Reverse split and then dilute to reduce debt. Very common.￼￼￼￼￼￼
giddy up
Should close that 12.6 gap today.
What’s up Doc? Not GE.

"You have to give this company some respect. It has been around since beginning of time. Even though it is not a component of the DOW, it sure trades right along with it. GE is a legacy company with a hell of a lot history."

"$57 to $22 to $40 to $8 to $31 to $6 to ??? maybe as high as $20? ehhhh, maybe not but that is a very long term downtrend that isn't going away because of Larry, Darrell and Darrell. Or anyone else. I am pretty sure if it gets anywhere near $20 that some of these lifetime bag holders will cut and run. Without them, who will care about this loser stock? GE has been sold off piece by piece and is still suffering from a conglomerate discount. Which piece of GE is next to get the ax? That is all the hatchet man at the helm knows."
Why bother with a reverse split? This will be back in the hundreds in a couple of years anyway. Unless management is not savvy enough to make that happen.
"The lead up to this announcement should be what T's people off. All of the so called ""bullish"" news was a setup to shareholders. He knew exactly what he was doing. The bad merger news was the icing on the cake. Trapping existing shareholders in their trades and slapping them down. I do know all of aviation is having a hard time getting more funding from traditional sources. A 1c dividend was never going to lure institutions into this. GE is in trouble still. Even if the bulls in here disagree. Look at the people that have unabashedly pumped this no matter what and ignore them. They are employees or retirees and pumping GE is their job. They are still pumping this as a positive. It isn't."
"I know not a big contract, but very important application if successful! GE wins $14 million to make water out of air - Times Union Scientists at General Electric's research lab in Niskayuna are working on new technology that would allow U.S. soldiers to brew drinking water on the battlefield out of nothing but the air they breathe."

How many CEOs come on CNBC to announce rev-splits? The average CNBC view who is just a viewer has probably never even heard of a reverse split. I mean the momentum FANG stocks that they talk about the entire day never even have to think about doing reverse splits. That term is never uttered on CNBC.

"Whenever there is M&A, the buyer usually goes down and the seller goes up. Occasionally, when the market thinks it's a good deal, both sides can go up. Here both sides are going DOWN. That says it all. GE made a sale on decent terms and is still going down because of this rev-split. My guess is Larry Culp tried to pair the supposed good news of this leasing sale with the bad news of the rev-split that he wanted to do all along."
Reverse splits are usually a last ditch effort to save a company. Wonder what the underlying issue here is???
GOOD NEWS -- BYE BYE $5 TUSA :) LOL : US federal government is betting $20.3 million that General Electric Co. can turn an MRI machine used in hospitals into a renewable energy powerhouse.The Department of Energy's Wind Technologies Office recently awarded the grant to a team of engineers and scientists at GE Research in Niskayuna in hopes that they can take superconducting magnet technology from MRI machines and use it in the generators that create electricity in large industrial wind turbines that GE makes.

"No Vote RequiredDo Stockholders need to approve a reverse split?The board of directors does not need to get stockholder approval to authorize a reverse split.

"Best thing that ever happens is double whammyreverse split takes the stock to perhaps $104 a sharethe AerCap deal reduces debt 24 million more and gives Culp 111 million shares to sell.If AerCap doesn't go broke - GE has a big great deal. Culp plans to sell part or all of the 111 million AerCap shares.Couldn't wait for the small 100 share investor to evaporate. That is causing a 5%-10% swingin the daily stock moves - up and down. Just look at today with 135 million shares sold in 90 minutes and a 94 point downward market swing. Pure FEAR.For real investors all the above could not matter less.Fundamental GE business is firmly rooted on the 4 divisions (Aviation, Renewables, Health, Power).All of these divisions have great market position. Each division exceeds $20 billion in sales (Aviation closer to $35 billion). Each could really contribute to FCF going forward if you do not measure in 202 quarters and instead measure in a couple of years. Most of these divisions if they were standing alone would dwarf most other companies on the stock exchange in pure sales volume.... Profits will follow. Obviously measured in days as a person owning GE is a ridiculously poor bet. Long term - awesome!Once again you are seeing analysts shout obvious sightly thought out opinions. They continue to show poor judgement. Some say better place to invest exists (bitcoin, Tesla, AMC, Gamestock for example). Wouldn't trade one GE share for any of these outright gambles. Some say GE is in trouble. Ridiculous! At $70 billion gross 2021 sales and $45 billion in the bank for use any way they seek to use it - GE is in exceptional condition to take a severe upward trek!Some analysts say too G has too much debt but ignore the $70 billion paid back against the earlier total. Culp is delivering and the company has managed lots of serious debt replacement in the past 24 months.Some say the firm (GE) is selling off the parts and there will be nothing left. Any serious fool can see that there will be 4 firmly exceptional divisions going forward. All will be future profitable divisions of GE. Any and all will dominate in their markets - including Power which owns 50% of the world market and has new low pollution generators to replace older models.....And some analysts cannot understand that taking the stock up 8 clicks(8-1 Reverse split) comes closer to $104 a share - joining other important stocks. A stock rolling in the mud at $6 to $13 is not very exciting for serious investors. And has anyone thought about FCF of $10 billion (totally possible in just Aviation and Health not counting Renewable and Power results) )with only 1 billion in outstanding stock makes earnings much more exciting going forward. At 20 times earnings- the stock would be trading at $200. At 25 times earnings the stock would be trading at $250. Doesn't that excite anyone or are we in a sea of fools?So let the stock tank today and recover tomorrow. At 135 million shares traded in 90 minutes - there is genuine panic in the market. Fear today - greed tomorrow.It scares the bejesus out of small investors and short buyers - and rightfully so. That leaves it to the rest of the serious long termed buyers.."

Now that everyone knows there’s going to be a reverse split there is simply no support level here at all. Pure psychological trade here. Once the RV split is done it’ll continue to tank￼￼￼. It may hold 20 after the split if lucky.￼

What was left of jj's $600 stimulus went up in smoke this morning.
Yesterday morning pre-market this was a $14.40+ a share. Then the announcement. BOOM! Stock plunges over 15%. A lot of pundits on CNBC really pushing this stock prior to that news. Looking like FOOLS!This is a stock to avoid. Too much baggage.

"After over 100 years on the index, General Electric was booted from the Dow in 2018. The company was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance. GE shares are down 12% over the last 12 months. However, the company’s transformation plans seem to be working. The company ended the fourth quarter with $4.4 billion in industrial free cash flow. In 2021, the company expects to generate FCF of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion. In the fourth quarter, GE posted a non-GAAP EPS of $0.08, missing the consensus estimate by $0.01.A total of 45 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in General Electric at the end of the third quarter, down from 57 funds a quarter earlier."

Still cheap.. Buy before big run up...
I have GE written down as a 100% gainer in 2021.
Broke through 12.22 next resistance at 13.24 then 15.01 going to be an interesting week. Looks like someone is taking a position.
A reverse split would be idiotic especially 1 for 8. This usually occurs when the stock is under $5.00 which GE is not. All it will to is turn away future investors as they will perceive the stock price as being too high.
timberrrrr....
no matter how you bashing but look at the balance sheet from year to year. analyists real logic to say it is beginning of recover. it was befor covid but you all knew that covid had caused stopping or worsing but GE is growing.

Stock split will not mean anything. It is better for big investors. Some cannot buy cheaper stocks. You will have less stocks but the same money.
does tusa officially hold a short position? or does he just advocate it?
"This will go all the way down to $1.50 by end of April. They can have 1 to 8 RS on May 1st, and the price will be exactly $12.00. Nothing will change except for the number of shares that you own."

I find it amusing that the dow is up 600 today and GE stinks. Crazy market we live with each day.
so does that make GE a buy ?
JJ likes to lose money. GE BREAKING OUT !!!.
"Doesn't appear there are too many more of these ""cheap"" pullback days ahead. I still won't purchase any more till they are confident enough to bring back the dividend n a meaningful way."
"wow, down 12% in 24 hours with no sign of stopping... way to go GE.... RS my #$%$"
Maybe 20 EOW? What do you guys think?
"Couple of wrong moves yesterday, sold 'X at $22..30and bought GE at 12.05 .today X is up to $24."
Reverse Split pulled?
Stock moving back up
As I said yesterday $6.00 before the reverse split is a good buy. See you there.
Thanks for the profits. I al buying Anab now at 19.5Could double within 2 year...Good luck guys.
Did I buy the falling knife?
"Shorts made some when stock was between 6 and 8, now again between 10 and 12. No worries, the obvious news will keep pushing things up. Shorts can eat, but they wont feast forever on this company. Culp is better than you."
It will come back up.
I’m in. I can see $20 coming real soon.
Jack Welcho ruined this company. All of the competive management systems that HE set-up will eventually destroy the management of this company.
"awwww, did you buy the dip?"
"C’mon Culp, don’t let us down in the morning. Go GE."

"GE is trading above it resistance level of 11.55 which is great. If it can hold, we will see GE at 12.50 and 13+ just around the corner."

"No Country, NOT even Russia, China can make GE Aviation Engines. So GE VALUE WORTH shouldn't be $700 BILLION to $1 TRILLION?? China can make AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, Copy JPM products services, but not GE Aviation ENGINES (only a rare 2 or 3 companies can, even they FAIL in reliability. ONE and ONLY GE ENGINES BIGGEST, MOST RELIABLE, BIGGEST MARKET SHARE.. So, how much is GE WORTH?? China can not make AVIATION ENGINES. They trying very hard. But not yet. China, even Russia is DEPENDENT on GE ENGINES. China/Russia ordered GE Engines worth $20 BILLION.. AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, LOL NFLX can not say that.. Now tell me what that says about GE VALUE, HOW MUCH IS GE WORTH to USA and the world. Do study GE Assets, it's products and services.. PROUD TO OWN A TRUE Heart of American dream, whose assets, products and services spread across so many VITAL, CAN'T DO WITHOUT Technologies of USA WORLD GDP Economy.. I am Humbled by JPM to own GE..If NFLX trades between $200 BILLION and $130 BILLION, Shouldn't GE TRADE AT $900 BILLION and $1,000 BILLION ($1 TRILLION)??..."
GE is up over 12% so far in 2021 for those of you scoring at home.
Volume has been the same today as all of the othersLooks like we might slowly go down until TuesdayBrutal
Do you think GE could get to $20 in 2021? To $30 in 2022?
"Get you Nok shares, great time to start ling position, still under 5 some how."

"Top holders, Institutional Investors and BOD will bring down to approx $10. There might be some buy backs with lower price and then reverse split - who knows."
"What GE really needs to do to accelerate its growth rate and strengthen its technology leadership in the entire tech sector is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for GE (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if GE just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

"Looks like we will have a big down day today and this could pull down GE ... great time to accumulate GE shares. GE is no longer in a conversation that of if it will survive in a down market, but the conversation how its bound back will looks like. The market sentiment of GE has changed most due to many signs emerged showing that it is turning around not a matter of if but when. We might see 10 before the end of Jan 2019 and if Jan is good, so is the yr. If the market has a good yr, GE will have a handsome return. Happy trading and good luck to all. looks like i am going to add a few shares today."

Announcing RS at $14 could only point to some bad things coming that will drop the price. Dropping from $100+ is better than dropping from $14. No one wants to be delisted before selling off to a venture capitalist.

IF GE was such a GOOD Company they would never do a REVERSE SPLIT...FACT: GOOD well run companies NEVER do REVERSE SPLITS...i.e...AAPL..MSFT..SHOP..CAT.
Wait to Tusa comes out n.goes positive on this!! There Balance Sheet is in great shape n by mid to latter part of next year will b looking to do strategic acquisitions!! Mr Culp is the best CEO in America!!!
"The companies GE competes with are generally smaller and less funded.You could never buy a stock for around $10 that has the same value going forward that GE has.In the past the stock was once over $50 a share. Then $40. Then $30, Then 20. Then $13 last year. Then $6 where i bought in at $5.98 after following the stock for over 40 years and hoping it would ever get that cheap.Not much has changed except far less employees,a lot lower pension needs and funded now over 82% - up from 70% just a couple of years ago.They now have less debt, smarter management, greater market position, they do command dominant industry products, and GE as access to every county in the world that need their advice, money, products, and partnership.So this continual bashing of General Electric is jut plain foolish.The stock is down because of the ""Robinhood Effect"" All the cutting costs and reducing debt and positioning themselves in the environment and buying innovation and developing new products. They are the real hidden messages for the company going ahead the next year.I can easily see the stock rising to $20, or $30, or even $40 for a patient investor over the next 2 or 3 years.There are a lot of poorly informed newer investors.All you have to do is look at the volume to see the last week that the really big money already is in the stock with patience waiting for forward results."
They are chopping away 2-3% every day!
When you have over 8 billion shares a couple wind turbine jobs does not mean squat!
"Let look at real facts for GEnothing can touch them on their Aviation. They own the market at 66% of all engines for airplane made.Their engines are also the most powerful and headed to the best fuel efficient with their new 10X model.They have 17% in military and also about 20% in service contracting their engines. It matters little on how fast that aviation market rebounds because the virus is being vaccinated and the forward look is all positive.Ad to that the Rolls Royce almost bankrupt picture and the Pratt & Whitney also propped up by Raytheon new ownership now - and Aviation is a very strong recovery for GE profits and volume The jewel in the crown is their renewable wind power division that is sweeping the offshore wind market and skunking Seimens and Vestes. Both are surprised with GE's powerful new Halaide 13MW turbines and this sweep will become the next leg for GE to incredible profits.Then their is the health care division. It just bought a new diagnostic small company and that makes their scanners are so far advanced that they will also rise to dominate the market in the next year or so. Every 3 seconds somewhere in this world they are using GE product like a scanner, monitors, etc in health facilities.An GE Capital has finally shrunk to just $10 billion, removed most of the bad debt, paid back a lot of the borrowed 5% funding, and is mostly offering new finding to the actual GE products like airplanes and engines and MRI scanners, and Halaide 13MW wind turbines.Their power division is also in better shape having ditch their coal, and now dominates about 25% of that market and is all over the world with their products."

"Just like some guys get rewarded with stocks and cash for cutting dividend and selling assets, somebody will be well rewarded for the RS. That person will not be you.

"GE is for long, if you keep saying PIG, it will turn into a PG, if you invest in GE when they are 5 dollars , it is more than double now, so invest 5 Billion, you have 10 billion now. This company has a lot of debts, but also has a lot of revenue, you cannot do it like Black Jack. Stocks according to Warren Buffet Long always win, Walmart used to be 12 dollars, Amazon used to be 8 dollars, if you hold long buy low sell high, you won't be here wasting time."
holding for a year once seemed like a good idea.
"Reverse split is very disappointing to me, though it makes no difference. Probably 1 for 3 would have been appreciated along with slow repurchase over a period time. It is known fact that lower prices appreciate faster and is more affordable to general public. In 2009 crisis I accumulated shares in financials, and industrials at a very low prices with the intent of accumulating dividends once they start raising them. I did same with GE (at 5-10 range)and I like to to hold as many shares as possible. Hmm."
Slow sell off into highly anticipated earnings. Interesting. I wonder what that could mean. Taking a wild guess and averaging down (Sad) on my March $12s. This dog likes to get kicked around
"The drop in price is an overreaction and therefore a buying opportunity. The leasing company sale was a good move and should have taken the stock up a dollar per share. The reverse split is a bonehead move and should have cost about $.75 a share. It makes no sense to me. But, overall, the stock still should have rallied a bit on a net basis. The selling, this morning, is a knee jerk panic move by retail investors. Institutions should be buying hand over fist, now. I expect the stock to trade even by the end of the day or tomorrow.Good luck, longs."
I have had stocks that did a stock reversal and lost even more money after the reversal. GE is not looking after the small investors with a reversal split. They want to look good for the big institutions. This is about us the small guys and we need to sale off all shares ASAP. First they took away our dividend know they want to screw us small investors. Let me say this to all small investors out there. Get out ASAP before you loose everything. I really thought Culp was making a difference but he is just like all the rest a F.

GE is up 19% so far this year. To the and setting up there for quiet a while. Goldman increased the target to $15.00 after talking with investor relations. This is the closest thing to insider information I can think of. They said they felt solid on FCF being on the improved side over last year. The Pratt & Whitney failures will drive the service revenue for GE on their engines and push sales upwards.

"The move also speeds up GE's turnaround, allowing it to slash its debt by $30 billion. It's also one of the biggest deals in GE's multiyear restructuring, following sales of the biotech unit, light bulb business, and a majority stake in its oil field services segment.Under the terms of the GECAS sale, GE will receive $24 billion in cash and 111.5 million shares, or the equivalent of a 46% stake in the combined entity. GE will also get another $1 billion from when the transaction closes in about nine to 12 months.Separately, GE's board also recommended a 1-for-8 reverse stock split and a ""corresponding proportionate reduction in the number of authorized shares.""Those actions are meant to adjust the number of outstanding shares in line to be more in line with companies that have comparable market caps, GE said."

I bailed out at 1365 After the RS news￼. Was planning on holding till at least 18. Which bozo had the idea of announcing a reverse split Just when the company was starting to get traction and investor confidence? Who’s the idiot that caused GE to dive bomb during ￼these record stock market highs?￼￼

"GE once again is taking shareholders for a ride. Retail investors and some big boys bailing out after the investor day news. Great for us shorts. Short this pig back to single digits up until the reverse split. At 9 dollars a share, GE will be 72 dollars after reverse split. Also a 72 billion market cap company losing over 50 billion in market cap during this process. The GECAS sale will be a loss. Sell to make 30 billion, lose 50 billion in market cap and then some.

I think that person that has been calling for GE to go to $4 may be wrong.
Spinning off health care and 80% of that will be given to ge shareholders.. very positive for ge shareholders.
Market dislikes uncertainty. Any uptick will result in an opportunity to exit...AGREED...they shouldn't have proposed this 1 for 8
best stock to own right now and for the next one year: GE
I smell shorts burning
"If GE were to sign a partnership agreement with EOSE for Sustainable Electrical Storage, GE stock would go up 4 points and EOSE stock would double. GE needs to grow their Green Energy assets........and all of the top people at EOSE came from GE. They already know each other. So talk about teaming up and going after Tesla in The Storage space. Get going. :-)"
Good Day to All GE Investors!!!4 days straight in the green including a Friday...we are good for a little breather before starting the next leg higher. Best to all.
Is there any doubt that GE is the leader to bring good things to life at any age and time?Did RS scared you out of your shares?

"My bet is on Culp. He came from Danaher. Pull a chart on Danaher........Oh Baby! Now that’s what I’m talking about. Culp signed a new contract last September that’s heavily linked to GE’s share price........Oh Baby, why would he do that? See ya at $22. Culp is da man."
The trading today was very disappointing. They always seem to find something wrong with their earnings or business.
Wow! The sellers are running for the exits. My screens don' t lie.
Selling off due to split is nonsense.. I’m more concerned about them selling the aircraft leasing business
There is a reason why GE is 11.00 in a 12 year bull market with most all quality companies trading in the 200.00 range... when this market finally crashes all bets are off.
Wonder what Cramer is going to say today? Probably I knew the market was going to tank & I forgot to tell you last week!!!

with market reaction to split I don't think it will happen but if it did say at $15 ×8 =$120 per share it will be like AAPL .The other option is to increase dividend by 100% and let the share price go up.
You go Larry! Making GE Lean and Mean. Making great bottom line for Investors. 
"I wonder if Warren Buffets secret investment is GE? Would kind of make sense...he knows the company, there turning things around, great mgmt n Bal Sheet!!!"

"Culp is doing a great job with monetizing various businesses, especially power, and drastically fixing the Balance Sheet.....hes setting this company to become one of the most respected organizations again...cash n AR now exceed current n LT debt and only will improve this qtr....accumulate before this really takes off...could see this jump to the mid to high teens if a solid qtr n positive outlook.."
I got only thumbs down on my RAD recommendation but it's up about 25% in 2 DAYS!!

This stock is my absolute favorite
GE is the only way EV can happen on a large scale.
"Here's a research note headline for those Sell-side analysts who couldn't rethink their bearish view on GE""Hated it at $6....Love it at $12""...Buy"
buyers think there is support at 13 - there is none -- the dam will break too much pressure
no more sellers
GE has been the poster boy for shorts . ripping off the long term investors. JP Morgan shorting GE. hope they get squeezed

"If you are on the sideline wait until the RS goes through or not. I believe GE is doing the RS for appeal. But financially theyre not ready and after the RS stock will drop 30% or more before leveling off and rebound. look at Citi, AIG, Motorla after their RS. And those are the successful examples. Huge dips after RS"

Bought more today. Will keep buying. This is the only stock I’m keeping very long term.
"Funny how just 3 months ago you guys were all hating on GE now everybody has nothing but good things to say. what a bunch of  regardless, I got in at a good price."
Which would be more devastating a world without Tesla or a world without GE
Remember that reverse stock split reduces ability to sell calls if you hold less than 800 shares and/or a multiple of 800 and end up with odd lots.
Now the shield of cant touch the Culp has been eliminated we now are in an entire new direction it’s time for the board to get just that..

"GE was fined $200 million by the Securities and Exchange Commission over alleged disclosure violations in its power and insurance businesses between 2015 and 2017. The SEC in a separate settlement said GE used improper accounting methods to increase its reported earnings or revenues and avoid reporting negative financial results in 2002 and 2003.Over the last 20 years, GE’s stock GE, -1.94% has dropped by a 3.8% compound annual growth rate, compared with the 8.1% gain for the S&P 500 SPX, -0.44% over the same time frame, according to FactSet Research data."

"A REVERSE SPLIT = A REVERSAL OF FORTUNEA reverse split is a sign of a shrinking company. Eight to nine billion shares is way to much for the much smaller GE of the future. It has been my experience that in the vast majority of cases where the company has instituted a reverse split the stock declined before the reverse split and for some time after the reverse split. In many cases, the post reverse split shares declined by as much as 70% to 80%. Also, companies that declared reverse splits often register shelf offering to raise capital at the new higher price thus diluting the effect of the reverse split . GE HAS MASSIVE DEBT AND IS MOST LIKELY THE REASON FOR THE REVERSE SPLIT! Many companies that declare reverse splits declare chapter 11 because of the onerous pressures that required management to declare a reverse split in the first place. It is my experience that at the very best it takes a company many years to recover from a reverse split. A reverse split company is more likely to file chapter 11 than it is to survive and in my view GE is no exception.IN MY OPINION A REVERSE SPLIT IS ""NEVER"" A GOOD THING FOR SHAREHOLDERS!!!"
"Sells a huge part of company then suggests a reverse split, and they have trouble with their balance sheet...Why the liquidation? Why the split? The answer is simple, the company is in way worse shape than the public.This 6 months of unnatural rally is about to go back 5 months."

GE is going to make it 8× harder to make a profit with the reverse stock split. I'm out.

Something is wrong. Every reverse split I was involved in went bankrupt. Many people pushed it saying what a great deal it was and I wound up holding the bag. Why didn't they discuss this when he was on CNBC. They just talked about the 30 billion? Vote NO.

Any chance of $13 tomorrow?
Thanks for the drop to buy more.
I do not believe that Berkshire owns any General Electric stock. I can't find verification anywhere.
Like how CULP plays long ball. Truly a refreshing style opposed to Immelt's. Buy.
"Selling none core business to lower debt is a good strategy,BUT not enough.....Culp has to increase core business results....Revenue and earnings....Then,share will climb strong...."
Prior to earnings GE was averaging 114 Mil volumeI am hoping today is the start of a return to that trend
"GE is getting leaner and stronger due to reduction of its debt, and simpilifing businesses and accounting and getting rid of their health coverage. In doing so it could attract big investors like mr Buffet and more of the institutional investors......RS was badly announced, however, due to strong future and fundamentals GE will rise to new levels soon.....I am LONG and will stay invested for sometime....by the end of MAY when everyone is vaccinated and air traffic is high again...GE will be flying high as well...."

"anyone who panicked and bailed on this stock, get back on the train, take a chill pill and let's ride this juggernaut to the future"
I’m reading a LOT of hoping on this board. A lot of I’m hoping GE will beat tomorrow. I hope this goes to $20. Ect.... The thing is there’s a big difference between hoping for something and the reality. GE will go higher but it won’t be tomorrow. What’s going to drive this stock up is AVIATION!! Not healthcare and certainly not the hopey changey thing about Windmills and the “green” deal. That’s pure pipe dream. Unless aviation moves higher and more IMPORTANTLY that the outlook for aviation improves this year this stock is dead in the water. I just don’t see aviation making a comeback in 2021. Look at Alcoa they mine aluminum and they see that being down this year. That’s an important driver as airplane structures are mainly aluminum. Don’t believe me yet? Look at Arconic. They specialize in making airline parts and they are getting hammered too after a big run up last year. As I’ve said before almost every company that has reported so far has gotten hammered. GE will be no different. Will GE survive? Yes! But that doesn’t mean that this stock is moving north anytime soon. If you didn’t have the China Virus last year I would bet this would be trading in the 17 - 22 range. But here we are. HOPING to get above $11 again.

"Ok so for all you folks that use terms like HOPE, IF, GUESS ect.... here are some cold hard facts: Cost of gas is going up, unemployment is going up, National debt is going up and a bill to pass $15 minimum wage is going to cripple small businesses and drive unemployment up higher. These are FACTS! More importantly, COVId is not going away anytime soon. The new mutation of the virus is going to only add to the uncertainty and hysteria of the government to justify more shut downs. It’s going to happen. Ask yourself what is that going to do to the overall market? Not just GE. Folks I said it before and I’ll say it again. The only way this stock goes higher is airline travel. If that’s dead in the water or any additional National or international shutdowns it’s going HAMMER stocks which are flirting at all time highs. I’m telling you now is the time to get in cash. Buy back later this year when things stabilize. Good luck to all."
Their clean energy division is doing great my question why not make EV batteries the EV battery business will see the fastest growth of any other business.GE has the technology and capacity to start right away
MASSIVE REVER SPLIT IS A NO NO RED LINE TO ME SO I SOLD ALL MY 7600 GE SHARES.. I WISH THEY NEVER HAD DONE A REVERSE SPLIT - I WAS SO SO BULLISH BEFORE THE REVERSE SPLIT SOLD ALL AT $13.65 TO 13.70 AM BEARISH NOW

"Amc , gme are examples how to trigger a short squeeze. GE is a good candidate as JPM has been shorting it from the 40's."
$GE has split at least five to six times since 1975 that's the reason for 8.1 billion shares outstanding. With so many shares it takes weeks for it to move up a dollar or two at it' current share price. If number of shares were to reverse split back to the 1975 share price you would be looking at a 30 to 1 reverse split. So in reality the 8 to one reverse split makes GE stock share price still cheap. One more perk is that the stock price after the possible reverse split would take a few days to move up $10 instead of weeks.
"Has anyone noticed that ""bad news"" on GE is offered up on a very regular basis. Most of it is new spins on the balance sheet, which is well known at this point. The ""latest"" news also includes: repairs on generators go global (old news), American Airlines brings servicing of their CFM engines in-house (old news)...."

BULLISH!
"GE has done it all since it hit $30 - Dividend cuts to 1 cent, Asset sells with no single penny to investors, etc and now reverse split. GE is like that uncle no one wants to hang around with, always promises. That is it - nothing but promises."
"Why has GE's smart score on Ameritrade gone from a 10 to a 2, yet the stock is up? Was planning to sell around 25. Not so sure now."
"All posts forecast dropping stock price re; r/s. Yet to read why? Why would mgmt / bod do anything that would automatically translate to long-term price decline? Price decline hurts Institutional as well as Retail investors, not to mention bod stock holdings. Can someone explain or interpret this paradox???"
105 too expensive. 20-30 is the right price for GE.
I'm kind of getting the impression that this company is on the cusp of turning a real profit for its investors. So let's just sit back and see what happens.
well Im hoping that the price goes upAnd STAYES up
Short please short more Ready for short squeeze
I thought the reverse split supposed to hype this stock up????
What a fricken nightmare
"this is the year for GE shareholders, and new buyers, everything is going for CULP/GE, plus Robin HOOD traders that want to squeeze holders that are short!!!, watch the forward statement Culp will give, this guy may see the value and throw in a $billion dollar buyback just to push eps along STOCK $25+ year end"
Carl Icahn should bring that $600 million over here to GE. We could use the volume.
"The MAX GE Stock chart shows a long downtrend, with three bottoms, and 5-year uptrends. Of course this could be the broader market, but it looks like GE is getting ready to rock the next 5-years"
"When it comes to psychology of share prices: Dow Jones is a price weighted index, so share prices with a higher price have a bigger impact than shares with a lower share price. I think Culp wants GE back to Dow Jones, as many investors are not considering companies not listed in major indexes. If I’m correct with my assumptions, that Segment profitability will increase this year and debts come to a healthy proportion (together with listing to Dow Jones), I’m quite sure what impact that all will have ! There are no clear rules to get listed again, but I’m quite sure a share price of 12 to 20 USD per share is contraproductive due to the a.m. reasons. Private retailers also will benefit once it’s done ! The communication around the RS should definitely improve ! So the underlying facts and motivation for the RS are understandable...GLTA"
We need to break $11.70...if we do could b a nice run set with little resistence to $13 or higher
will see $16 in place
"I thought about selling my position in GE after the recent news, but decided to hold. The market can be so irrational, especially at these times. I would not be surprised if GE ends the month with a new 52 week high."
Who is buying so fast?As soon as weak hands are out it will resume ascending flight .
who is buying a $7-8 stock after a 8-1 R/S proposed LOL
looks like the drop is accelerating.
here we go go..

"The turnaround at GE is starting to take hold and the reverse split is a part of a plan that will bring back investors (maybe institutions) and put them into a position of slowly start increasing the dividend (this will take time but it's gonna happen).The goal is to reduce the number of outstanding shares to bring the total shares more in line with other conglomerates in the industry....There are two ways to reduce the outstanding shares....1) Buy back stock (the way most larger companies do it) or 2) Reverse stock split.....GE got to this bloated share count through years of mismanagement of the finances by Welch and Immelt. This stock was split several times over the years (traditional split) without giving any real thought to the bloated share count it was creating. The financial crisis required more dilution and the shares count grew terribly out of control.We know the goal of improving cash flow and the need to raise cash. So buying back shares is not anything that could be considered. Reverse stock split is the only way to bring this back in line.I know many have the reaction (myself included) to paint reverse splits as a negative and desperate move by a company. That is the more traditional use of a reverse split. That is not what this is looking to do. I see this as a strategic move that accomplishes a big big objective without having an impact on the balance sheet.The 8 or 9 to 1 reverse split with take the company from 8.8 billion shares outstanding to .9 to 1.1 billion shares....Without doing the math for you, let me suggest doing this to see the impact... I took a look at Honeywell focusing on these three areas...Shares Outstanding695.5MEPS (TTM, GAAP)6.71P/E Ratio (TTM, GAAP)31.65xSource is TD Ameritrade Summary Page for HoneywellDo the 8 or 9 to 1 reverse split on GE's data to get these numbers....Then extrapolate GE's stock price from there....you will be pleasantly surprised at what you see....Now go look at Honeywells stock price. Now this isn't going to happen overnight...We might see a split adjusted price to $100 or so and then drop before improved EPS are attained....With improved cash flow (happening now) and the turnaround well underway, growth will start to take hold and we will significant improvement in the stock price...Look for growth deals to be made in the renewable energy sector to get the company growing again..... Larry Culp is doing a brilliant job and seems to have his board on board with the vision.....In two years this will be a $200 stock (25-30 by todays share count). If we get those numbers we will then start to see a slow increase in the dividend....Patience....he knows what he is doing.....reducing share count without spending cash.....Hope this makes sense to those concerned with the reverse split"

Heading to oversold territory. I built a position at 7.19 so this is just noise right now. If we hit sub 10 I’m loading up. Culp trimmed the fat and the RS is getting way too far overblown. If you were here before Culp you know he has only facilitated raising GE from the dead after what he inherited.
"On Feb 2020, GE was trading at around 13 a share. A year later, GE is in much better shape. If January earnings are in line, GE should be in the $13 range."

Most people want GE to reach $15 and then jump off. I get that. Some averaged down to under $10. I get that too. Some bought under $10. I also get that. But RS is not good for GE's reputation.
smart money getting out
"crazy market, for those who want to know Robinhood, said Thursday it was restricting trading in certain stocks that have also been targeted by Reddit to only allow users to close out positions."
10K shares at 6 an change.... GE is my Stimulus check! BOOYAH!!!
"Check the GE chart from April 1st, 2010 - January 1st, 2011. You’ll see GE went on a big $6.00 -$7.00 run. Not saying you should make decisions based on past charts, but the pattern looks very similar to what we have here. Also, the financial crisis almost bankrupted GE. Does that story sound familiar?"
Love to see thirteen today!
So some of us are buying GE because BA is going higher. Interesting logic indeed. Why not buy BA?
$15 coming
Just sell it short and come back next month to collect. Easy trade
Go GElets settle around 16
GE getting it’s mojo back?
What is the SP for a 1 for 8 RS at $8 ?
This surprise news will catch the shorts off guard. Could be an interesting day.
Canada Pension Plan just increased GE to 7 M shares...
"Looks as if most are sitting on the sidelines until the Feds announcement. Could get volatile! I've reduced my exposure and sitting on some $ ready to make a move. Good luck everyone, Happy St Patty's day!!"
"GE Renewable Energy has announced that it has been awarded a contract by Ocean Renewable Energy Joint Stock Company to supply a total of 15 of GE’s 4 MW-137 wind turbines for the Cau Dat Wind Farm, Lâm Đồng Province, Vietnamhttps://www.renewableenergymagazine.com/wind/ge-renewable-energy-to-build-the-first-20210223"

May Force be with GE.

watching the 11.98 & 11.99 tennis matchGO 12! GO GE!
I own 120k shares. I don't want it cut down to few shares. Larry keep up the good work you're doing but leave the share price where it is for now. You bring the sp above $25 and you'll see how fast it shoots up.
The RS plan will most likely be cancelled .....the management team would have known by now how damaging it is to the share price .....just wait for it to be announced
And the financial engineering has begun
"Two things important for GE stock and volume1) the earlier people shorting the stock from last June to around the end of January are not playing that game now.They have lost a lot of money as the stock moved mostly upward fro m$6 to - $13 and their cash position has been decimated.A lot of the volume in the past month was people ""churning"" in and out of the market. That is not the case now.But there are still short trades with computer programs making lightening in and out minute by minute decisions.These are different because the bet is huge, the risk is low, and they are fairly safe bets on small changes. These will not really affect the GE stock moves if you look at it long term.2) The GE stock has heated up over the past 3 weeks moving from a low around $10.50 to $13. This move is really not supported by earnings or earnings rumor. It is based on the long term belief in Larry Culp, the effect the vaccine is making on the pandemic, the belief that within 6 months things will return to a better place, and the obvious new energy GE has shown on Renewables,improved carbon emmiting generator products in power, their new super sensitive scanning MRI and monitoring equipment (supposedly a game changer)the new 9X turbo jet engine that has passed government certification and approval All these and more giving GE dominance in the very environmental sensitive energy market.and you can add a 3rd thing3) GE has taken all the fat out of their game.Reduced employment from over 330,00 to 160,000 closed numerous redundant manufacturing plantsreduced the pension obligation to under 20% and around only $20 billion unfunded - possibly lowerreduced the GE Capital portfolio from a bloated $5 billion a while ago to around $10 billionimproved the GE Capital portfolio financing only top quality things they mostly make and sellgetting the long term life insurance annuity portfolio under control and reducing exposurereducing the overall corporate debt to a very manageable $20 billion or near thatLeaving the $8 billion in Baker Tool 33% ownership as an unused equitybeing savvy enough to keep the dividend a one centbeing also intelligent not to go out on a buying spree or spending their cash on stock buybackSo a long term investment in GE is a bet on old fashioned common sense.General Electric has made all the right moves to move back to a very high price based on a much better Free Cash Flow.It is mostly a matter of time - not if but whenAs an investor, I have the patience to wait for the results."
"There is no way Larry Clup can get his sign-on bonus unless the stock goes over 25.00. So now he cons the board to approve a 1-8 revers split to he collects the 25 million bonus. We have 8,7 billion shre outstanding with the R/S we'll have 6.9 billion outstanding 1.8 billion decrease in shares out. Nothing changes, but the share price goes to 104 if it stays at 13. 13 X 8 = 104. but our CFO collects a 25 million bonus cause the share price went over 25.00 .....VOTE NO ......What a con-man... Where is Elizabeth Warren on this one..."
"something to chew on concerning the RS proposal * stock price is sinking* stock price may fall farther if the shareholders vote for it In other words , the mention of the RS will take off a chunk of the price .. NOW .... Guess what can be done if the sp drops back to say 8 or 7 or less ..... BUYBACKS ON THE CHEAP !!!!!!"
well Jimbo Cramer just gave us absolutely no useful info on GE
Set-up on 5 year chart is sick after $14.50 area - straight shot to $30 - haven't seen a set-up like this in a while. NIO was close and we know what that did.
Earnings per share at $.58. Dividend should be raised to $.16. This will raise the price per share and compensate we long term investors.
Our stimulus just came. News of G selling Aircraft leasing unit will pump value into my GE share more than $1400!
get out before the institutions start the rush for the door
That's all folks
"GE IS THE ONLY MAJOR, MAJOR EV ELECTRIC STORY THEY ARE KEEPING UNDER THE RADAR, QUIET.. You do not hear a single noise attention to GE's name is ELECTRIC, GE Technology is ELECTRIC POWER. The Power generators, Electrical Equipments, Parts, the God knows switches and mains, many millions of ELECTRICAL components, are all GE.. All EV roads must go through GE.. Yet, GE NAME IS KEPT SECRETLY, SO MYSTERIOUSLY SILENT..*AVIATION ALONE ON ITS WAY BACK TO $$30 BILLION REVENUE, WITH $$$10 BILLION PROFITS, and was growing revenue at 10% 2019..*Then there is GE RENEWABLE IN JUST THE RIGHT SPOT AT THE RIGHT TIME, GROWTH AREA. GE HEALTHCARE always was growing, and is high margin life saving, millions of Hospital's Emergency Rooms only hope.. Yet NFLX, TSLA, NIO, ABNB, DASH are combined $$$$TRILLION+ DOLLAR Value, Yet their combined revenues are HALF that of GE..God bless Wallstreet"
institutional holders not happy -- looking for the sell
"Thanks for the gift.... nothing changes with the ""possible:"" reverse split. Same PPS and the dividend moves to 8 cents a share or more? Maybe they will do a special dividend and share some of that $$ with a special dividend payout? Regardless, I am in for another 1K long shares... Also took 100 June 18th calls for 15 @ .60 . Decided to split the call between the 13 current PPS and the 17 the analyst project.... Knowledge is power... power is money... fear is worthless... tm Cheers (wow 152 people are here? What are you trying to find out HMMMM?)"
"Hold on to GE. I made the mistake of selling some Apple (aapl) in 1995 when the news was all negative. Big mistake on my part. GE is climbing steadily from some bad times. If a company can re-invent themselves (as Apple and others have, maybe GE too), then there will be a comeback. Not always, Kodak was not able to."
Would love to see Ge rally into positive territoryDisappointing considering the market is up so high
"I suffered through a reverse split on citicorp, years ago. The stock still has not recovered.This is not a good thing for the GE stock holders."
todays ge move could be related to texas disaster Larry Culp said at a conference that he expected GE to be part of the solution following Texas outages.
"With NASDAQ fading hard, GE will soar. Buy."
We need to break 13.06 if it is going to make a bigger run
This is an easy $20 if market plays nice.
"analyses supposedly ................ based on facts and individual assumptions as seen by the analysts , recently upped by many based on culps performance and forecast for 2021now tusas record for last year hasnt been great, his target 5$his belated upping to 7 then the pandemic hit and back to .....again ges latest er outperformed.tusa the sceptic in this game no longer calls ge a sell , short or underperform. his earlier ratings didnt quite work , my belief he is waiting to see more"
shorts are babies. This is long for the mature investor.
Moving in the right direction again. Nice :)
Volume moves a million per minute...look forward for the rest of the day and tomorrow ! Shorties: sleep well !!!
11.15 first fib.
will see $11.30 this closing bell
"My guess is corporate bonuses were just handed out and they want 20 percent more shares for their buck. Ive been a trader since the 90's and have never seen a stock reverse for no reason at all. I'm not buying the we want to look like the others gig. Only other option I can think of is they want to look handsome with an 8 cent dividend, post reverse. Which in essence is no increase to the dividend whatsoever. Anyone else have 2 cents to put in er uh 1 cent."
Does anyone know that GE makes the jet engines for Chinese fighters ? and now China wants to BUY General Electric.
RS are the last ditch effort to increase share price. That's not worth $40 dollar bonus let alone $40million.Why didn't board buy back shares when stock price was $6-8 dollars?
Classic Bear trap
Over 17 million shares premarketLast few weeks it was lucky to break 500kToday should be fun
"I’m getting my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine today. I have already booked 10 round trip plane flights for the rest of 2021. I have spent $0 on Travel over the last 14 months.......but will spend about $28,000 over the next 8 months. There are 150 Million Americans just like me. It’s going to be a boom. Book your travel now."
"You can't see me Texas Turd, I am doing my happy dance right now because the sell off not only let me buy some good options, add to my long position and make some money... it shook out the stock from day traders into long value holders. Mark my words... by August 31st 2021 GE will be at 25.00 PPS..... about a 2X gain from where it is today.... BOOYAH!!!!"
HEHEHE rever split down draft again next week hehehehe will we see $10 soon hehehehe newly minted bear LOL
Welcome all leaving tech for GE. Buy.
"done with it folks, got to run"
"Is GE working on ""better"" electric motor technology....applicable to EV and other applications. Also, are they involved in battery or other electric storage or distribution technology research and development.Thanks for any information regarding the above."
"Yahoo has 2 red arrows pointing downwards. In my opinion. it is fair to have 3 red arrows pointing down until GE starts to grow revenue. Sorry if you invested at $30 and they begin to sell off the house, cutting dividend and splitting. No reason to be trading above $5."
Shareholders: Do NOT vote in favor of the reverse split.I will vote NOT to reverse split.
"This is a shocking move. And caught everyone by surprize. It still has to be voted on. There appears to be no rational reasoning for it . Especially as well as things were going . As Jimmy pointed out , are never good. .These things if they do end well , take years to play out. I recall 3 I owned way back when , on stocks trading around what GE was the other day."
is this company a sick joke? did anyone else see the volume yesterday? absolutely no reason to be this down today
"Historically reverse splits do not end well. GE a $100 stock? I do not see any basis for it. There would certainly be so, so many stocks that would be a better investment at that price. They are selling off everything of value. What's next? Aircraft engine is still vastly effected by COVID and who knows how long before people will be comfortable flying even if they get this virus under control. GE Power is still not turning a profit. The Renewables face stiff competition. And Medical doesn't make a lot of money for the company. Barron's had a article on four reasons why the stock is down and said ""None of them are Good"". S&P may lower their credit rating. And cash flow though somewhat improved is still seems to be an issue. The glimmer of hope that occurred as the stock rose from the five dollar range to a little over 14 dollars, I think has lost it shine. Sad for a company that once was such an icon."
seeing that this happened on a green market day... the pull back coming tomorrow and next week will drive this to $10 and below....
People selling...... its going higher people
Dreams come true ge
When is going to be the split
Jeeez.... people are still buying loads of March 19th CALLS even after this run up... what could they possibly know that we don't?
JJ...you thereHello???JJAll the shorts that were so loud on Monday...anything???
Earnings may be a surprise ?
Any chance of $14 next week?
"Houston, we have launch!"
When was the last time Ge was up 5.88% in a single day?Nice movementBut it is interesting that the volume still seems to be low compared to when it was running 114 million average per day
"March 2 (Reuters) -* GE RESEARCH AND COLLABORATORS AWARDED DARPA PROJECT TO IMPROVE SPEED OF NUCLEIC ACID-BASED VACCINE MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION - STATEMENT* GE RESEARCH- GE’S DNA-BASED APPROACH COULD BE COMPATIBLE WITH NEW, RECENTLY APPROVED RNA-BASED COVID-19 VACCINES* GE RESEARCH - AWARDED FIVE-YEAR, UP TO $41 MILLION PROJECT THROUGH NEW PROGRAM FROM DARPA CALLED NUCLEIC ACIDS ON-DEMAND WORLDWIDE* GE RESEARCH-IN FINAL STAGES OF PROJECT WITH U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE’S DEFENSE THREAT REDUCTION AGENCY TO DEVELOP FASTER METHOD FOR MAKING DOSES OF DNA-BASED VACCINES"
Slow and steady advance is good for building support levels.
This is one of the very few bargains you can buy in today's market. Buy the dip.
Out of the 48 stocks on my watch list $GE is the only one on fire after hours. $GE to 24 dollars by years end!
wonder how many institutional investors are balling out.?
"Next resistance is $13.75. If we break through that, it’ll be a straight shot to $14+. Have patience and hold. Slow and steady will win this race. We’re not going sideways; we’re going up the next 2-3 years."
My guess is Tusa finally comes around tomorrow or Thursday...give accolades to Culp n puts a $25 price tag...he steals the show because now he has the highest target n knows if he becomes bullish the stock will exceed that target within six months!!! Lets see what happens!
"ProShares stocks do a lot reverse and forward splits. It is the nature of proshares to split, whether short, ultra short, etc. Can we say the GE stock is a proshares stock?"
"If the profit takers and panic sellers didn’t sell last week, we’d already be at 16+. Once we cross $15, look out. Could be a quick jump to $20. "
Morgan Stanley just raised the price target on GE to $17 ahead of investor day on March 10th. Tony Balooga suggested today on the Apple board that he may raise his price target on GE to $20 by August. Yikes!
"The Markets reaction to the Fed seems positive. But, GE's retail investor doesn't seem impressed. Imagine If Management had not announce a 1 for 8 reverse split. They might be trading around $16+ right now."
"GE is on a bullish trend, especially with renewable energy being at the forefront of the democrats plan. There wind turbines are rated the ""world's most efficient wind turbine""."
305M share on market today... So ...
"You know why China controls 95% of rare metals crucial to Apple phones, U.S infrastructure, U.S aeronautics and the U.S nuclear defenses? Because the U.S Congress and banks would rather put all their money into useless Facebook buildings full of computer harddrives."
back to $10
Crazy to think that with one dumb idea Culp went from being one of the most loved CEO of GE to just another name on the list of hated corrupt CEOs of the past.
I don't buy the reason to do a reverse split. I don't recall a case where a reverse split meant well.
Headed back to single digits. Example of how a mismanaged company can totally destroy existing shareholders
I will dance naked in the street if GE hits $20 this year...
"Is tomorrow a ""sell the news"" event?"
"Guess what would help prevent power outages..... GE Gas Turbines and GE Steam Turbines. they don't freeze up, Just saying."
bottom has reached...only but up from here imo.
Will. GE be part of the DOW again.
Don't hold it over the weekend.
High demand to buy GE. Turn around play for 2021
"Chickens Coming Home To Roost report to the main office, Chicken to the main office please!"
"Twelve Dollars! Beautiful, absolutely beautiful. A really good start for 2021. Go GE."
"GE BOD can do face-saving tomorrow morning by releasing -- ""We are shelving the RS to focus on business recovery"" or something like to that effect. My money is on NOTHING. They do this with intention."
VOTE NO FOR REVERSE SPLIT....
"After the reverse split for some companies, long term holders lost most of their investment - So why GE wants to do that, it is not a good idea."
$12 very soon........momentum feels right.
"Stock holder revolt needed ! Just when things were looking up. Culp pulls a fast one. Not sure what his game is , but it is not for shareholders."
reverse split
See ya at $15 soon
So literally put my meager life savings into GE at $6.15 a share. Unfortunately had to sell before year end but nearly doubled so I’m thrilled. Took a piece and put it on IQST. Currently flying management looking to up-list to NASDAQ have look.
Did Tusa get Viurs scan McAfee? hahahhahahhaha
MAX IS FLYING AGAIN... SO IS GE!!!
"SAFE SAFE SAFE! WE ARE SAFE! Texans no longer wearing a mask and I'm one of them. Texas economy is booming and so is GE! GE to $50.00 by year end! Time to go out bar hopping and celebrate! Live life to the fullest!Dow will be 45,000 by 2024. Don't believe negative jj; don't pay attention to 10-year treasury yield rates. Inflation will never increase. Go take a second mortgage on the house and place it all in GE. You will not go wrong. TRUST ME! The interest rate will never go up with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Saunders at the helm."
Jeff immelt ruined general electric. thank God he's gone. wherever he goes he will leave a path of destruction. Larry culp has picked up the pieces and will return GE to half of what it was. should be good enough for investors at this point to double their money within 2 years.
"In 2017-2018, this company was steered right into a giant brick wall doing 100 miles per hour. needless to say it has been down and out ever since. However, don't sell now just when it is wobbling back onto its feet again. I see a real light at the other end of the tunnel and it is flashing a green $15/share sign. I see GE at $15 sometime this year."
GE mgmt
"GE was about to break out from it's spinoffs like SYF, BKR and Wabtec and the dropped right back into the pile after the RS announcement. Sorry if you own GE and the spinoffs."
GE? This is the next mover?
"What is the real reason GE IS NOT much higher, with the future very Bright on the new green world."
"One of these mornings, the morning GE pop will surprise us all and just keep going........when who knows, but be prepared."
"What_the_F......Here's a suggestion. Since you appear to be so adept at continuously spewing out doom and gloom predictions with no substantive evidence to back up a cohesive thought, why don't you try playing the lottery. Your advanced knowledge that allows you to predict the future with such precise accuracy should come in quite handy there."

"Does GE move into an upward trend. Most likely yes, but don't expect much unless GE can post incredibly amazing numbers going forward. NOT LIKELY folks. Maybe a few pennies better than expected in the coming quarters."
Judge dismisses shareholders lawsuits late Friday night. Got a feeling stock will rebound big time on Monday
"Paris air show back on, and GE goes up a dollar on the news. The orders will be massive. --MGGA"
Morgan ups target to 17 then this news . What in the world is GE scamming ?
Reverse split needs shareholder approval and it will take some time. I am sitting tight and buying back what I sold at $14.20
"BA is up over 5%. GE should follow. Plus, GE should rebound another 5% from this week's crazy selling. Let's see GE close up over 10% today.Ready and set for launch.Go, GE!Good luck, longs."
Sold!
"If the Fed news is positive, GE could have a significant jump upwards.The market seems to be expecting positive news...but 2 pm could see a great increase for GE"
GE is into setting statics and metrics. Now all they measure is free cash flow. And Longs fall for this very bad metric. Legal corruption.
"Wow, 2 days since we closed at 12 and 13 is already in sight!"
"Some of us are rejoicing that GE is selling off parts and pieces and disappearing the money. My question to you is ""what do you own if you own the stock at all?"" You think the value of your stock in appreciating by selling off the businesses know as GE? It is like watching your neighbor sell off your land and you are happy do not have to mow the lawn anymore. Scratching my head."
4.4B FCF!! That's enough to be positive for the year!
we need T Rowe Price to dump entire holdings and then watch this turkey fall below $3.00
"GE Q1 Revenue 20.52B, 6.2B earnings. Last year's FCF was negative and Culp says it will improve this year. Still sounds pretty good to me. Culp always underpromises and over-delivers."
This is a great entry price. Gotta love a deal
BREAK THE WALL
"Above 400 Million Shares in 2 days and GE is Above $12. Basically, institutions are buying and retails investor is losing. Tusa comes out after so many days that means JPM is also buying. Culp is a legend look at Danaher. I am buying because I buy based on the CEO."
"Listen up, GE is next GME. I am telling. I have done my research, loaded my shares and ready to go. BUY BUY BUY"
This is the reason GE remains an 11.00 stock in a 12 year bull market.... it simply has no buying power. It’s nothing more than a computer driven day trade
The short squeeze should be at GE not GME.
Could we see 12 today?
Bought more GE today.Added to my position in GPK!
Selling out. Im sure thats what china wants. time to dump it - Lets see thief in chief sells out to china profits collapse. and engines are made cheaper over sees. Great job Dems. I forgot to mention the layoffs. Also now its free $$ for ileagls. But if your a hard working usa american than forget it. WOW
Hold or Sell to buy another stock that does move??
"Anyone saying anything other than tomorrow is a Green Day MOST likely. Well those people legit don’t understand charting, or level 2 this will most likely be above 13 at one point tomorrow"
20T:12.68?reverse spilt?
I BELIEVE SUSPECT MUTUAL FUNDS DO NOT LIKE REVERSE SPLIT ... THEY GOING TO SELL I THINK
Gotta get this volume north of 100 mil - actually 150 mil - 50 mil ain't gonna cut it. Wait for HUGE news - it's coming.
NOT GOOD
Covid infections dropping quickly due to Americans finally wearing masks. It took a long time to get Americans to wear masks and took covid 19 seriously. Probably helped by a few dead Republican politicians.
I must agree with the bears today something definitely wrong
"Huge momentum coming from small retail buyers... Big boys Big money are still assessing but ready to make some moves...I am thinking old school investors are stepping back in pushing $15 in March.. it's coming !!GE longs can relax, good times are just starting !!"
I know where I'm going with my dividend money BONNIE LEE'S FRYED CHICKEN
I AGREE G E on the way up have sell order in @ 15. but will sell @ 14 .
Larry is taking this thing back to the Dow people
Jump on the next GME. GE
Let's join hands and celebrate the $12 achievement.
Business improving + debt going down = Great buy. Class dismissed.
"meh. last year 8n march when it went red everyone was saying in wish I bought it in march. well this is it. time to load up on all the the stocks. mines in nvax, $nio and $ge. let's get it. when people are scared buy."
"GEs proposed 1 for 8 stock split stinks. 1 for 3 should be more like it. They should also use the 30 billion in the GECAS deal to buy back shares, while they are still cheap. This in turn helps shareholders and the company. A 1 for 8 reverse split will hurt shareholders. Time for GE to do the right things for shareholders who own a piece of this business."
covered 1/5 GE short +$1.79
moving up on low volume?
shaking out the stoplosses
Tusa just informed me the new target is $8.02. Does that make some happy?
The Fed injected 270 billion dollars to the market yesterday. You will see the market rise this coming week. GE will fly above $14 and could be $15.
Guys these are not FOOLs to just wkeup nand announce they would like to Reverse Split. Its well thought and planned out ... They will definitely not let anything go wrong with the company footed so strong after the 20008 turmoil and Pandemic .I am guessing they want the give Company and prestigious status and to be High Flier which you small guys will not be able to catch.
"The Fed finishing up their meetings regarding interest rates tomorrow, along with lots of key economic indicating numbers regarding employment, GDP, CPI, Housing and many more, sets the market up for a potentially very volatile day. Also, with Powell speaking live on Thursday with all eyes and ears fixed on his every word, I plan on sitting on the sidelines with as little exposure as possible.Good luck, invest wisely."
way to go thanks alot
"I was long on GE, but took profits. This move will exclude most of retail. After all, it is easier to take a stock from $13 to $26 than it is to take it from $113 to $226. I think this may slide some more tomorrow. The entire market is too high and we have an incompetent administration that yesterday held a press conference to tout maternity suits for fighter pilots. I don't know about you, but I do not trust an administration that wants to send pregnant women into combat."
Weak hands need to relax. Try holding the stock for more than a days or weeks? Company fundamentals has not changed.
Reverse Split is a bad idea. Management should focus on managing. Grow earnings and the price of the stock wil rise.
You think institutions didn't know this was coming as they...again...pumped those upgrades to you? Nothing has changed.
wow check out the 17's Call.Volume just released!
Masks are more important than shorts these days. Wear them properly now.
"I bought 300 contacts, 11 dollars call for $5300 and sold 100 contacts for 6000.00. Still holding 200 contacts and hoping for $12.00 tomorrow or day after."
Do your research. During the Stagflation of the Great Depression micro cap and small cap stocks outperformed large cap stocks 10 to 1.
"1/8 whaaaaat, Trade in GE over kids"
YIPEE GOING DOWN TO $12.50 IS MY WISH -- GO GO GO DOWN PLEASE LORD BLESS ME AGAIN WITH YOUR ALL MIGHTY POWER TO BRING GE STOCKS TO $12.50
"Ge sits on billions in cash, makes a deal for Billions, yet,... Offers a 1 share for 8 reverse split to its investors. No buyback witch could have easily been done and would have increased shareholder value. No increase of dividend, witch would have given the investors who bailed them out a small positive compensation for their efforts. GE is sinking and they DESERVE it. $5.00 range coming soon!!"
I can see GE in $50 stage soon. I am hopeful and so excited. Forget about the bashers. Today is a successful day
Ed Garden is one of 11 members of GE board. He is also chief investment officer for Trian fund management that in 2015 had majority of their investments in GE. Think about that for a bit. Yikes!
"Still wondering why RS. Let us take a peek at BAC and GE shares outstanding.2014 BAC (10516M) GE (10119M)2016 BAC (11059M) GE (9187M)2018 BAC (10237M) GE (8691M)2020 BAC (8797M) GE (8753M)There you see for yourself. BAC is growing revenue and buying back shares. Share price is now shy of $40 from below $14 in 2014. Oh, I can remember when BAC was $5. I couldn't buy enough because that was2009 and 2011. Couldn't find the money to load up like crazy.On the other hand, GE has been reducing shares by selling assets. Looks like assets to sell are running out and outstanding shares are creeping back up. Hence the proposed RS to hide the facts. No reason to pay $13 for a share."
GE to the moon!
GE is on the road to recovery.
The $30 Billion sale of aircraft leasing will clear the way for divestiture of long term care and debt reduction. Culp is making Major moves. Incredibly bullish for GE shareholders.
GE is a junk stock stay away.
"Just based on the mean price alone on the five year chart this stock should be trading at between the $25 to $30 dollar range; with ample volume this stock can get to those price levels. To many folks out there looking for the next jumping on board the next ""Pump and Dump"" and loosing there shirts. $GE stock has strong technicals and financials without extreme price pull backs. It's a smart stock pick."
"Pattern Energy Group has closed financing and begun construction of its 1,050MW Western Spirit wind complex and transmission line in New Mexico. The project consists of four wind farms using 377 GE Renewable Energy turbines. Commercial operation is set for the end of 2021."
14 premarket short we told you do not bet against king Larry Don’t blame us we told you jj and chicken
I say $14-$15 by March-April overall I see this a $30 stock price!
13.25-0.75 (-5.36%)At close: March 10 4:00PM EST12.78 -0.47 (-3.55%)Pre-Market: 8:38AM EST
"If GE can break 14.14 today, it should make a huge runTomorrow the house will approve stimulus and Wednesday GE will discuss their outlookThis week is looking up"
"GE pushing a burden on its share holders again. Wants less shares but cant afford a buy back, so lay it in our laps. how anyone thinks this is just noise is insane. Their is no reason to do this right now. but shares are up and CEO got his bonus and we get a reverse split cuz they dont like the share count. then buy back, but they cant afford it. That is bad news. in since 7, out at 13.20. still a good return but GE lost a long because this is not to a investors advantage."
I’ve never seen a reverse split make a good looking baby. GE is on the path of joining the ranks of former powerhouse Westinghouse. Sad.
"they go south so short make some cash and they go up so the long will make some cash and at the end the long make more, I do not see why GE can not be 15 to 17 down the LONG, long mean few more inches, take time."
$14.40 by Friday!!!
"Now we're talking . ,ok, the 11 dollar threshold has been surpassed. Now the rest of 2021 gets interesting.Hold longs. Don't listen to any shorty. They want you to believe this stock is going to tank.It is not going to tank. It's going to $20.00 or higher. Good luck all."
NO STOP SIGN!
"Who,in their right mind,would buy GE at over $100 after the sick idea of a reserve split 1 for 8.Culp is no better than Immelt.Keep selling off assets and screw retail shareholders ."
Hey Boys! Just got notification that 10 directors acquired around 4-8K shares a at 12/31 close @ 10.87 a pop!
"Fellow share holders currently GE has 84,250,000 million shares short VS 75,750,000 million short, lets dangle the worm for awhile before we put the squeeze on,CULP will be making announcements along the way,winning the lawsuit friday after hours a big deal, 50 years on wall street tells me we've hooked a big one"
Bottom today
184 Million already oversold.. time to buy. Going up $1 tomorrow...
Looting process.
I bought another 1000 at 12.70 to add to my long calls jan 21 strike 17. Confidence in this old boy.:)
"Wow, reached $13.61. GE is strong!"
we will be going higher i can see $13 today
this will really pop on earnings!
Who is going to buy GE at $100 a share in retail?
"I am long GE and will continue to add at between 10 and 10.5. I new the market would shoot up before friday. It is surpricing that the thing that motivate me here is that at the end and biginnig of the month money comes into the market. But I could really use another sell off before the close and maybe buying in agai at the close on Friday. why! take a look at GE how is tolling back the last 30 minutes, and the adv- declines are extended or ST overbought. No something will ither top at about 11:00 to to 12:45 and dive into the close all the way to Friday to see a rally about the close tomorrow and up until the first few day of traiding on Feb! This is my opinion, and is base on all this swinging and experiencing as of late the vix, adv-decline. out of the 500 sp and 100 nasdaq there are about 500 stock moving higher, it usually sell of after a few hours."
"5-for-1 reverse split might have looked far better than its massive 8-for-1 deal. (The latter signals that GE has all but given up on growth). The firm has also lagged in pushing wind power to replace its declining coal and gas turbine business. The AerCap deal brings in cash, but not much else.To succeed, Culp will need far more than smart asset sales – he needs a plan on growing the businesses he has left."
people working 9-5 are just getting home & checking their brokerage & finding out about this snafu!
"After reading GE ,CEO conference call, I predict $20 a share years end for GE"
GE RSI: 66.67
post the margins for engine sales and renewable sales please.
Wait for tomorrow guys
GE will soar when oil services is sold. Seems the price per barrel will make it happen. Buy.
I feel bad for whoever sold yesterday. Scared money makes no money!!!
"trustco bank, another Schenectady ny institution just proposed the same thing--interesting--the one thing I will say--a single digit stock is easily manipulated 10% at a time , and risk tolerant funds wont buy into that"
"GE will benefit greatly from the worldwide move to renewable energy. The company will supply 190 Haliade-X 13 MW turbines for Dogger Bank A and Dogger Bank B, the first two phases of what will be the world’s largestoffshore wind farm located in the North Sea. These things are monstrous! The blade diameter is over 600 feet and a single one is capable of generating 288 megawatts in a single day. With the new administration high on renewables, GE will have a good run over the next four years."
"We end another week and no word from Flannery or Miller. We are now at 2 months without a word. GE ""leadership"" does zero in communicating with investors. No reason to suggest the stock is a good value. Of course no buyers. There are some good things happening at GE but not being communicated by the company. Immelt used this management approach and Flannery has continued the practice. Apparently Crotonville doesn't have a course that teaches if your head hurts when you hit it a hammer, stop hitting it with a hammer."
Look at the volume. That's a beauty.GE momentum is tough to push against...
Volume on lower price yesterday was 1/2 the normal volume; volume on the steep drop this morning was hardly much...again trending towards a 1/2 volume maybe 60% avg volume day
"Theory behind Revese Split No Fundamental changes, they just want to reduce float , giving more credibility to company based o share price. It has nothing but to Go up Now and even after Reverse split."
"The long weekend and political uncertainty is over, now the money is pouring back into market. Enjoy the ride to $30."
route only getting started. GE just seems to always slow itself down and get in the way. this will give back all gains after reaching a high only two days ago at $13.32. Every time momentum gets busted probably going to ground all GE90 engines. also gota ask yourself the timing of an ex CEO what the heck is that about? Like I said GE is the biggest obstacle in its own way...
"Before flooding this message board, flood the ge investor relation email with complaints re:the RS!!!Let's get Culp announce a ""Oopsie I was misunderstood. The way GE is moving, the RS is not needed. We will reach $45 price per share next year. Why a reverse split? Moronic"".Stay greedy my friends"
"Whoever the ""Pezzo Novanta"" that proposed this Reverse Split needs to be jettisoned. He or she has a serious thinking disorder. Proposing something like this is a sign as to how far removed from reality these stuffed shirts really are!"
Is GE getting into batteries for EV? Or trying to buy an existing company like PLUG or FCEL? Anyone with info please share.
Think about it. The stock has been rising steadily and the banks and huge fund managers missed the first train. Now with all there power absent a Redit rush they are able to back up that first train and get on. This is going up up up.
"Holding up pretty well... GE turnaround is around the corner :),,,"
"Stop looking back. Look forward. Culp came from Danaher. Pull a chart on Danaher. Culp re-negotiated his contract with GE last Summer to make it much more SharePrice heavy. He knows GE is headed to $24. With a V shaped recovery and massive infrastructure spending, GE is going to do extremely well over the next 2 years."
Reverse Split = F'd again. Thx Jack Welch Thx Jeff Imelt Thx Board of Directors 
GE engines may replace pw ones.. as GE engine has record of great performance
Pre market is green. I hope the day will also close to green.
Pump team needs new pom poms. Next Nasir will come out with some real wisdom.
There is know reason to watch or write comments about GE until the last 3 weeks of any given quarter. It’s like a swirling rapid going know where until the final 15 days of a quarter go back and fact check it
"Heads up folks, call options in the next two weeks and earnings call will push stock price past $13 dollars. Ge fundamentals and technicals are great, very well undervalued company, positioning itself strong midterm to long term. Good luck longs."
New 52 week high... cant go against the trend...the trend is you friend!
larry would never cut his hair today.. his 3 year CEO work contract is coming up..have faith.
"GE stock breaks through $11.50 this week,followed by a CULP announcement"
"ge - it comes down to performance and prospectsi left ge for 1 year when i saw neither, what i did see a deterioration of management and co. performance now most importantly i follow culp, his business acumen, and sometimes share what i see.coming back for me paid off, so did my interpretation of stock behavior"
"Well it?s Saturday afternoon and let?s just recap this past weeks events. GE reported really strong numbers considering the current state of affairs. And just like I said, there would be a pop and then the HAMMER. Well wouldn?t you know how right I was. There were those that were HOPING that it was clear sailing to 18+. There were those saying only IF the Reddit people would short squeeze GE. But at the end of the week the pps shows no signs of life. Ask yourself what?s going to drive the stock price up over the next two months before the next earnings call? COVId vaccine you say? Well here?s something for you.....that?s already baked in. On the contrary any delay in vaccinations will only hurt this stock more. Oh the 747Max is now allowed to fly again! Cheers you say? GE is bound to go up now! Right?! Let me ask. How many orders does Boeing have? I?ll wait for that answer. But the new administration! The Green New Deal! Yes yes yes that?s the ticket you say! All the off shore windmills oh yes that?s going to drive GE to new heights! Let?s just see how fast ANY of that gets done. If there?s one thing Democrats and Republicans can agree on is that the Federal government is as quick to change as the Private sector.....NOT! Now don?t get me wrong, GE isn?t going to file for BK protection nor is it going to $4 like #$%$ says. But we?re sitting pretty high in the market right now and the policy changes being implemented are going to have a ripple effect theough the economy. Wait till this time next year when it?s $4 for a gallon of gas. How many people will be flying then? In short it?s a pull back to 8-9 range and then another run to $13-15 in November. Anyway, back to my Saturday afternoon!"
Any chance this goes green today?
"Tradings after the reverse split will be much less from the small retail investors, the big guys can then set their moods on the price they want to come in much easier...Good or bad for GE price-wise in one to two years out, you yourself be the judge... Think hard why BOD wants to do it..."
"Do not trust someone who has been banned!!! He says retired but the settlement with the SEC tells otherwise, read it!!!!"
I'm thinking about 50 million volume in the 1st hour!
hedgefunds must be taught a lesson until they are destroyed
11.5 sound good. then 11 35 and then back up again.

"GE Management, Reverse the Reverse split decision and all of the pain will go away."
today it was announced that Netjet is building 300 AS2 supersonic jets in the next decadeGE has just completed the designs for the engines that will be used to power this aircraft.Netjets is a Brerkshire Hathaway company.
I am in a very good mood today!
Insiders are not buying. They are getting free shares. Expect share count to balloon before the split. Then after the split new shares will be issued to pay down debt in the next 3 years. Share count will stabilize around 4B. Meaning that about 3B new shares will be added. Or 24B presplit shares
volume ........... someone is buying
"As one that bought in defiance of Tusa at $6.23, I can say that GE's businesses are now firmly in an uptrend. If Culp and the board want fewer shares through a reverse stock split, be my guest. It means nothing other than general house keeping. Buy."
Can we just appreciate GE for trying their best to protect us the investors
Today’s close perhaps between $13.50-$14+
Happy to hear the CEO gave up his salary last year. Very Brave!
heavy option buying this am.
"GE will close around $13.5 this Friday and $14 in one month. GE is still in the early stage of recovery. Using any weakness to accumulate the shares if you are a long term investor. GE’s aviation business will recover after pandemic. With the recent consolidation, GE is becoming leaner and thinner. Surely, GE’s future is bright. Thus, using any weakness to buy. I just bought more shares around $13 earlier."
If it just bounces up to $13.34 tomorrow I'll break even! Go GE! :)
Anonymous muted
my bet: 20$ by the end of 2021
I’ll buy the drop on Monday
Just got in at $11.00 see what happens tomorrow hopefully
Any predictions for the 26th post call?I think Culp has some momentum and will beat again...which should bring volume and a fairly decent sized jump upwards. I would think a beat would push it close to 13
looks like GE is growing despite what the Dow does
"I don't own this stock like I said. But I have before and would seriously research before dumping now. That division they are getting rid of seems to be pain to manage. Good idea to slim down and get cash out of that paperwork, managerial monster. I will be buying in at best point."
What will happen to GE price if and when it is removed from the Dow and certain fund managers are required to sell it from their funds?
"Wth, that reverse stock split makes no sense."
Might GE experience a short squeeze like GME? What could trigger such a thing?
"OH Boy look at her run.... JEEEEEZ no, not JEEZ, GE! Sorry for all those who sold... but you do know you followed the wrong advice.... GE is a BUY BUY BUY!"
"The deal is great!! Getting $30B cash n have an interest of 46%!! So, if this partnership works, huge upside...this division is not even part of core n.GEs market cap is only $116B...they just got $30B for a non core asset!! People don't get how good of a deal this is!! The reverse split has no impact, but to me wasnt necessary at all!!! Anyway, I've accumulated a lot more this morning in Calls!! Great buying opportunity once the street understands!!"
"If GE chooses to help resolve a national crisis how about assistance for the unspoken disabled military veterans who are homeless or living in homes that do not support their special needs. Let's see, we have plenty of money for Hector from Guatemala at the expense of G. I. Joe."
Here comes the demand !
If market holds up over the weekend.....gap up Monday!!!
Bofa upgrades ge to 14.00
"Disappointing volume, no real follow through from yesterday. Very frustrating....."
"Anyone notice that jj didn't post for 8 days? Now, he just got his $600 check, and about to lose it all. LOL"
upside at closing bell today. buy buy buy
shorts go broke a lot. name one famous shorter.... let's follow their picks
2 Pratt & Whitney engine failures over the weekend. Could help GE get more market share.
Must read NY Times article on GE disrupting the Offshore Wind industry
Tusa was just praising GE in Feb on 4.4B of FCF in Q4 beating expectations of 2.5B. He's hated GE for years and continues to as the businesses of GE are improving.
GE to $20 ... !!!
"While the reverse split announcement was a surprise, I understand the logic. This will likely result in less day trading (eg. less volatility) of GE shares and likely less shareholders over time as well. In the end, splits are nothing but noise long term and company will be valued on the company's fundamentals. As for the Aercap deal, rock solid in my opinion. GE gets $26B in cash while continuing to own 46% of the combined company. I like it the deal. All told, I'll be holding my shares."
 best people and culture on earth!!! We run the world.
"21.00!!!!!!! Target WOOOOOT WOOOOOT!!!! Is that 15.00 peeking around the corner!Mittermaier raised his price target to $15 from $14, while reiterating the buy rating he’s had on the stock since December 2019. The new target would make Mittermaier the second-most bullish on GE of the 21 analysts surveyed by FactSet, behind just Global Equities Research’s $21 target."
WooHoo $15 $16 $17 by tomorrow!!! Not! Hoping and praying. Hope and Pray!
longs about to be schooled on how technicals work this thing is going down
buy buy buy buy
of shorting this a few months ago
Oh as I read through all these posts on thing is consistent words like HOPE and IF and MAYBE. If you are using these words you have no reason to be investing. Hoping that this gets traded like GME? Really?! What most don’t realize or acknowledge is that this stock is not moving until aviation comes back. I am soooo tired of saying the same thing. It’s all about the airline engines. Nothing more. Once air travel comes back the stock will move up. It’s really that simple.
The shareholders voted today. Original news brought it to almost $14.50. Then they threw the 1 for 8 split in. Down almost another dollar. The CEO on CNBC this morning did not even mention the split? Why??
Just when we thought we had a right stock when mkt was down last few sessions Ge out performing but just in one day giving it all back
26B look at the positive side
Is the reason for RS fir the purpose of issuing dividend again but to one eighth of stockholders?
"Sorry Yahoo. I should have read the guidelines and I would have known that posting a link to an article is not permitted. My comment is still relevant. I became bullish on GE yesterday for two reasons: the NYT article on $GE development of A Monster Wind Turbine, and second, the reawakening of $BA that should help $GE."
GE is bidding on contract for engines on B52 bomber. 75 planes with 8 engines each.keep your fingers crossed.
"Now that Larry Culp has saved GE, sell Baker Hughes use the proceeds to buy back GE shares. $4B can alot GE."
hello GE freinds. i remember the GE bears on this post laughing at me in October when GE was around 5$ and i was telling them it will double!!! hahahah look where it is today.. GE is gold!!
why is GE going down as the market goes up????
Shorts will try to scare you but don’t be.
as i said before $20 in 6 months
I sure wouldn't want to be stuck in large cap stocks when the liquidity freeze finally rears its head because the day is coming when no matter what the Fed does liquidity will stay frozen.
Be real guys. GE share price will not skyrocket soon. It will at most thread water until the vote which will be yes. Then most likely drop towards Tusa's $5 until the split happens. Then fund managers will short and drop further to $50 range which Tusa's price target.
Pump and dump before closing bell...that's all it is.
I use etrade no charge on stock. now options I do not know?
"Respectfully, with the rising 10 year bond yield and possible inflation...In this climate, GE showed today it is safe harbor."
GE held up very this market selloff... GE turn around is here to stay....
"All else being equal, maintaining the same dividend level would mean 8 cents a share after the proposed reverse split.""Although the board reserves the right to change the company's dividend policy in the future, we currently anticipate that the per share dividend paid will be proportionately adjusted,"" a GE spokeswoman said in a statement.................uh huh"
Reverse stock splits are equity killers
GE should sell it's stake in BKR and focus on renewable.
guess buy once it is down 8%?
$15 by year end
Riddle me this Batman...why is the $17 Leap giving a 38% upside including the premium received to GE’s current share price? I mean it will be available this morning at the open?
"the year of the CULP, $15 soon, and Tusa finding his brain"
WHEN will GE pay their dividend ??? still 1 cent???
"Thanks to the last financial changes GE is now worth $20 a share today. They only way to stop the stock price surge was to invent this ""reverse split PROPOSAL"" which will be NEVER voted upon or even less MATERIALIZE.Guillermo owns clean energy CLNE. The stock stuck has been stuck at $2 for five years. CLNE board kept a PROPOSED REVERSE SPLIT on their agenda for 5 years without EVER asking shareholders to vote on it. Now the stock is at $14. No need of a reverse split. With GE at $14 a reverse split? All it needs to do is starting buying shares that it can next year with the PPS moving to $30.Stay greedy my friends"
GREEN PRE MARKET. SOMEBODY KNOWS SOMETHING!
Don't Worry...Be Happy !!!
"Bought 3,000 shares at 6.04. Thank you analyst for push this gold mine down so I could buy so cheap. I see $16 coming by July. Just as soon as 2 more of my holdings gets everyone vaccinated (PFE and MRNA).Hope VXRT will get their pill form vaccine out there by April also. TSLA is a dog. Bought F at 4.40 and riding it back to $20. No way TSLA who would not make a profit without the Govt. handout EV credits is worth more than GM, TM, GE, F, VW, HMC, and NSANY combined. Bubble on TSLA about to pop."
Some people are buying this if current holders are dumping! Volume is going to be a lot more than yday
"Now Tusa beats down GE when analyzing MMM....this guy has a love affair with GE Zand as much as he pushes GE down, I'm surprised there hasn't been any investigation into his comments regarding GE. Despite being wrong on almost every level. He was right on the stock one time, and he just cannot let go"
I was hoping it would get back above 12
At the end of the day / Ge is going to perform the same - however investment managers just got their transaction charges reduced to 1/8th of current !!
Shorts are like deer  in headlights
"Retest 11.62, then 12.20 then 13.24. Possible new uptrend beginning @ 11.40. I think we see 13.00 - 14.00 over the next few weeks. LC has pulled this Rig from going into the ditch to back on the road and the BILLION dollar deals to support it World Wide. Would not be shocked to see LC pull a rabbit out of his hat and surprise everyone."
Good Morning to All GE Investors!!!
It’s now a “contrarian” stock. Bet on it to go up when the market goes down.
Next earnings report starts the FOMO move - downside is virtually nil!
"It is hard to understand the rationale for the reverse split, especially since the company is doing so well. I suspect there is more to the story."
Time to buy GE
"Thanks to GE, I now have a short term capital gain problem. Thanks GE! "
GE’s engines don’t explode. That’s a very good thing. GE can supply Boeing with engines the flying public will feel better about.
.13 away from the 52 week highI would love to see GE move through 13.50 this week and see the volume go back to the 110-120 million per day
Nice close
GE deserves to be a $5.00!!!
Next they will increase the dividend to 4c or pre split 1/2c. You will be grateful as you are fooled again. The same GE no matter who is running it............into the ground
Buy. They're not reversing on a down note. Senor mkt. on the wrong side.
"Put your energy into increasing the profitability GE to increase the share price, not a reverse split. Giving me a dollar bill for 10 dimes does nothing."
"all you people talking up a short squeeze on GE need to understand the GME/AMC game and do some simple DD (avail right here on yahoo). GE has only about 1% of the float short - unlike AMC's 30+% and GME way over subscribed 260% both on very low floats. GE has 8Bn+ in the float and can cover in about a day's volume. Sure, millions of redditers can line up to buy GE but the last impact on a short squeeze would be minor. GE is a long play. Culp is doing amazing. Do some DD."
This deal is a great thing. Get in before it hits 14!
"Wow, Crazy Sale, back the trucks up!"
6 month chart is a work of art.
I feel lucky today. I'm thinking we breach 14. Aint that something?
Why isn’t the CEO saying anything about the adverse reaction to the RS??!
Why all the negative reaction to the reverse split. GE is getting stronger financially so it obviously has nothing to do with that. Naive investors will sell to longs advantage!
"Jack Welch came to me and a dream last night, and he told me to buy "
GE in a steady but sure upward trend!
one reason is decreased dividend.. it will not be 8 c/q but 5c
"This closes below $13.00 today, below $12.00 Tomorrow. Worst investors day ever!"
Reverse split is a bad sign for GE.
jj how are you
"GE is a joke, instead of focus on boost the earning, it focuses on psychologically boost per share stock prices"
"GE is not even up 100% from March Virus lows, 2008 Crash lows. EVERYTHING, EVEN ALL G@RBAGES ARE UP 200%--500% to even 1000%.. Just remember the $5.48 lows was after virus March low $6.66, which was also 2008 lows $6.66.. Just reminding you guys. Thanks to JPM, Toosa for the opportunity to buy GE.. I have to open JPM account at some point for this opportunity and show my gratitude.."
How much GE will save on interest by reducing its debt by 30 Billions ? Now they can increase the dividends .
"Manipulation is so obvious. Any normal ""real"" stock that is established and generates revenue (unlike a quarter of the speculative #$%$ being trading today), upon good news like this, would be up at least 3% to 5%, or maybe more. No problem, the longer it stays down now, the more it will go up later."
"GE provides power solutions to over 1/3 of the world's power grid. EV's are on fire! Tesla, Nio, GM, Ford, and many more electric vehicles all need to charge up. Who do you think benefits from the electrical grid buildout? GE!"
Reverse split worse thing that can happen every company that does this retracts even more
Just a temporary dip. Money is going out of stocks into the big money lotteries. GE investors particularly understand this maneuver!
"Reverse stock splits almost never work out short term at least. So GE will most likely start trading around $100 a share. Really? Why price the stock so high when many investors still remember all the nonsense GE engaged in during the previous years. I think the fact that the stock was priced very reasonably that the average investor was willing to take a chance. At around $100 a share, I think GE just priced it out of the average retail investor's price range."
Everyone vote NO on reverse split
"I suppose retail with losses has two options: one is sell a Leap now if you believe. Second is sell if you don’t believe in GE anymore. Perhaps the unspoken reason for RS by Culp was, we expect GE to be doing better by most metrics, and the 8+ billion shares will prevent our share price from adequately moving upward in response to those improved metrics. They have to get Institutions on board to pass the RS. How are they going to do that?Why is it that I can sell a $17 Leap for a $1.05 or so? So, let’s say the RS goes through (they have to bank on the institutions voting yes), the price at $13 will be $104; and at $14 would be $112. The $17 Leap if achieved is $136. So, I’m getting $8.40 on the leap. The real question here is do you think GE will be North of $18 on a pre-split basis.The other option is sell, take the tax loss and find a better equity."
"First Major Blunder by Culp,....by reverse splitting they remove the retail investor, someone who has supported GE while the institutions bailed on them. It was these so called financial engineers that got GE into trouble with the DERIVATIVE delusion of the early 2000's. The board should have left the share restructure ALONE."
Is that all you've got?
I don't do reverse splits. That's why I sold my shares after hours. I suggest you learn as much as you can and decide if you want to ride that wave or not. I will respect whatever you do...!
what time are earnings out?
"opinions dont matterwhat was culp able to accomplish, whats his outlookcrucial for ge pricing moving forward"
Oh boy going to $4. Get ready.
"@what-the-faith You insist the GE share price will drop to $4, and you mentioned in an earlier post this is based on your analysis of material issued by Steven Tusa and Markopolis(sp?). They have not been able to cause this to happen. Only Jack Welch PHD (bless his soul) got the price at $4 early in his CEO tenure. I'm a buyer at 4$, but when is that coming again?"
"Heads up folks, Something to notice, analysts at zacks updated to a strong buy of GE stock, after a long hold rating."
Sell puts against your position.
yahoo average target raised again 11.50 now.continuing to move in the right direction
What are the chances GE buys Bloom Energy?
RS designed to shake out retail investors... guess what? it's working.. it'll drop to $11 or $10 and change on lower and lower volume........ no more climb to $20.. no more momentum...thanks a lot GE... Retail investors took the chance and risk on your stock when in was $6.... typical...
blastin!!!
Interview at CNBChttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lYn7db0eK8
"So let me get this right, GE has most of the debt under control and a 400 billion dollar backlog of business and Tusa is worried about 21 billion in debt left on GE capital."
"surprised tusa waited and still no changege hit 13, then again 12, works for me"
Buy buy buy GE
"The Barron’s article today made several great points.One of which is that most reverse stock splits are done by failing companies with poor fundamentals. Also, reverse splits rarely happen. So the data for reverse splits will skew the numbers towards lower values.But GE has solid fundamentals and is not doing the split to keep their stock from being delisted. My take away is that today’s move down is a huge over reaction to the reverse split by people looking at skewed data sets.I am getting my teeth kicked in today...but I’m holding on"
Watching Level II...holding up nicely.Don't Worry...Be Happy ! :)
We could hit $14 by eod. Fed is not increasing rates
General Electric is up 5.70% to 13.30
GE BAGGIES dropping like flies
I think GE wont raise dividends until rs.That way they dont have payout as much.what do you think?
Analysts say GE stock a top long pick for 2021!! Covid recovery play. Are they right?
Renewable source of energy is the next big thing..GE is well positioned in that msrket.
Over 200m served down 5+%
Please stop whining on rs. It just a proposal to test the market responses and bring down the price. I think they they want to buy back the shares at a cheaper price
Six months ago GE was a little over $6. Those looking to buy the dip are to late. Growth should be steady though.
R/S are never good for existing shareholders ; only done for companies with debt issues that need cash.. GL and get out..
Not interested in GE because I am not interested in a RS.
Well they got the price back down maybe they should buy back shares now
Just hold tight and buy any dips. Culp is doing a great job and this time next year he will have the dividend reinstated and this will really take off. Wouldn’t be surprised to see $20 in a year
GE should be well over a 100.00 stock in this bull market.. but it’s not and it never will be... there is a reason why it’s 11.00
"Good morning, Clowns, especially jj. Did you wake up screaming a few times last night?"
GE is my favorite
What happens to your options when they split?
"Look at Culps compensation for last year. General Electric (NYSE:GE) CEO Larry Culp waived most of his salary and all of his bonus last year, but his total compensation still hit $73.2M, triple the prior year.But how is the stock performing now after investors day. How about giving back most of it since the stock price is barely changed since he took over. Culp is lining his pockets on the backs of GE shareholders. Retail investors are getting screwed by GEs current management. 8 for 1 reverse stock split, way to go."
anyone have a good discord
"Free cash flow by the end of this year is $3.5-$4.5 BILLION. Culp, would you please have my children?"
All these half baked companies up over 200% in last weeks tells you something big is going to happen in the market.. and it won’t be good
$30 and higher this year
Bid being held up as someone big exits this.
Never should have cut the Dividend...Was a huge mistake!!!
Anyone notice GE debt is now less than ---LLY. LLY DEBT OVER 350 per cent.
You got to be a very stable Genius to take a 600 billion dollar company and turn it into a 100 billion dollar company. Hard to believe they let Immelt keep all that money they paid him.
Two companies worth investing in GE and NOK. They are both turn around stories and have a bright future! Back companies that are worth and desire to be backed!!!
"Freight Of The World: Global Cargo Airline Picks GE Engines To Power New Boeing 747 Jetsby The GE Aviation BlogThe global freight carrier Atlas Air Worldwide said on Tuesday a quartet of new Boeing 747-8 freighters it ordered from Boeing in January will be powered by GE jet engines. The deal, which includes engines and overhaul services, is valued at $800 million at list price over the life of the 20-year maintenance contract.“The 747-8F powered with GEnx engines gives us the best and most versatile widebody freighter in the market,” said John W. Dietrich, Atlas Air Worldwide president and chief executive officer. “Our partnership with GE Aviation supports our longstanding focus on leading edge technology. We look forward to continuing to provide world-class service to our customers.”Atlas is the world’s largest operator of Boeing 747 freighter aircraft, with 53 of them in its fleet. The Boeing 747-8 is the latest and the most advanced version of the Boeing 747, also known as the Jumbo Jet, which helped redefine air travel over the last half-century.Above: A GEnx-2B engine at GE Aviation's test center in Peebles, Ohio. Image credit: GE Aviation. Top image: An Atlas Air Boeing 747-8. A new deal between GE and Atlas Air includes engines and overhaul services, is valued at $800 million at list price over the life of the 20-year maintenance contract. Image credit: Atlas Air.Each of the new planes carries four GEnx-2B jet engines, a close relative of the efficient engines that power another advanced Boeing jet, the 787 Dreamliner. Atlas said its new planes will have 20% higher payload capacity and 16% lower fuel consumption than the previous version, the 747-400.Airlines and other GE customers have ordered more than 2,500 GEnx engines since they entered service early in the last decade, making it the fastest-selling, high-thrust engine in GE’s history.The engine owes its popularity, in part, to advanced technologies and materials that helped it achieve the highest reliability and utilization, lowest fuel burn and longest range capable of any engine in its thrust class, according to GE. For example, the GEnx is the world’s first commercial engine with both a carbon fiber composite front fan case and fan blades. The material — which GE first used for fan blades on the GE90 engine — helps make the fan module lighter and corrosion-resistant, simplify maintenance, and improve reliability. GE Aviation has also developed a 3D-printed component for the engine that helps to further reduce its weight. The GEnx is also the quietest engine GE produces.“The GEnx-2B engines have proven their reliability and durability since entering service almost a decade ago, and GE Aviation is committed to providing full support for these engines long into the future,” said Jason Tonich, vice president and general manager of global sales and marketing at GE Aviation."
ge to sale engine Div. to China
I have been waiting for this week for the past 2 years!
"Welcome all newcomers to my page. As one who bought heavily at $6.23, I can say legitimately welcome. The issue was that no one foresaw GE’s component co.s turning around. Algos steppes in and rubbed it in our faces hence the drop to $6.23 where I bought. It’s not fully cooked. I see $30 over the next 6-12 months. Algos will take us their at the end."
Come on GE get the gas turbines to Texas NOW!
"Debt reduction, Revenue, Profit................SP up. The numbers will tell the story for sure. I don't see much risk here.....just need a little more patience/time."

Guillermo is asking all the witches with the B to cover today.The reverse split news is FAKE NEWS. Guillermo's family already sent 4 complaint letters sent to investor relations re RS fake news.Stay greedy my friends.
Good Morning to All GE Investors!!! :):):)
"with all the analysts on this board, there should be no surprises lol"
"Baggies should avoid GE stock because earnings have been sinking for years. Furthermore, the stock is still overpriced compared to what it is worth. A good rule of thumb is to never invest in something you do not understand."
Smart to trade this and buy some put options? What y’all think?
The decision to RS/ 1 for 8 will leave way to much room for GE to fall. GE is to financially too frail to proceed with the RS at this point.
Guaranteed that the only positive reactions regarding a 1 for 8 reverse spit on this board today are being made by planted frauds. Research companies that have done them and see for yourself.. This is a stock price killer!Reverse splits are for bankrupt companies!
GE big play will be wind turbines....
My gains are slowly creeping up .... lmao
could it be the election
"Reverse split makes perfect sense to me. They want long term holders and not daily profit taking. With lower volatility and a higher price, it’ll also keep short sellers out.I wish they had held that announcement a few weeks out, though, which could have helped today turn green."
"@Terrence my outmost respect goes to you. Because of your beautifully put posts, I will never respond or let @Nasir - low life - posts bother me. As far as $4 or $20 for GE, only time will tell. I am betting much lower if GE is to survive. Since it never made money during the best market ever, how can they make money in a bad economy. Regards."
THANK YOU LORD I SHORTED AGAIN AT $12.52
ge for me at this price without news a hold.better opportunities out there if you follow the market for trading / investing
"Reverse split? Are you kidding me? They announce a reverse split AND slightly lower than expected guidance at the same time? It as if they’re purposely manufacturing a selloff. ￼Reverse split rarely lead to positive movement and SP. Just when I thought GE was going to move strong into positive territory, They pull this stunt. ￼I’m out.￼"
When financial report?
I am 37 and now own 10000 GE shares; My gift to myself...
Wake me up when the capitulation is over.
what a day end!!!!
"Guillermo here: the reverse split is RECOMMENDED by the board, it is NOT a DONE DEAL, it must be voted. Guillermo asks everyone to write to GE investors relations/CEO advising AGAINST the reverse split. It will not happen. Conspiracy theory? Some banks were afraid of GE running to quick too high so they issued this fake news to ARTIFICIALLY drop the price allowing them to load up SUB $20. Thumbs up this post and let's get to $20 before June 1st.Stay greedy my friends!"
"if they split into 3 companies, at $15, if roughly equal value, remaining company would be under $5 possibly forcing institutional sales.... only reason for reverse....added here."
"Yahoo is blocking GE research on DNA vaccines. Blocked me twice from sharing GE link and this news link. It’s news! WTH is Y up to....“Aiming to enable vaccine production on-demand, anywhere in the world in just days, GE Research and a multi-disciplinary team that includes the Broad Institute, DNA Script, MEDInstill, Molecular Assemblies, and the University of Washington, have been awarded a five-year, up to $41 million project through a new program from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) called NOW (Nucleic Acids On-Demand Worldwide). Such a rapidly scalable and deployable production process could dramatically increase the speed at which new vaccines, such as the recently approved COVID-19 vaccines, could be deployed to people in need.”"
"I realize the negative sentiment with GE and you young menz. Is it not a reopening trade, engines, clean energy, and finance arm?"
HAHAHAHA its aint going up anymore ge reverse kills it hahahahahaaha dream on only small investors trying to hope for higher price.. the big guys are slowly getting out hehehehe that ontario pension i hope n pray they should be panic now before its too late becuase of the newly announce reverse split...!!!!!!!!!!!

GE is Tim Seymour final trade on FastMoney!!
Selling for roughly 1x sales with FCF of prob $4 to $5B!! So undervalued!!! Once the consolidation period is done we will start our climb again...company need to abandon RS idea!! Email investor relations!
"I refuse to try the tactics of some on this page. Truth is, GE is a solid company with transformational leadership currently in place. I've owned the stock for years and yes, I see it trending higher. New aircrafts need new engines, one of GE's mainstays. They build some of the most efficient power equipment in the world. I look for them to increase their dividend sometime down the road. So, I'm long GE."
Of course they will wait for the SP to be much lower before they really blow your accounts up. It is the GE way.
GE has slapped every retail investor in the face by offering them 1 share for every 8 reverse split. The retail investor saved this company for bankruptcy!! This company sitting on Billions picks the pockets of the small investor!!

GE is another Tesla stock - will soar upward for no fundamental, rational reason!! Sell! Sell! If this happens!!"

"GE Board wants to limit the number of ppl that have 100 or more round lot shares that can be borrowed against in brokerage houses for shorters. I'm assuming this was their intention and thinking a $30B sale would absorb any optics problems of a 1:8 reverse split.

GE just announced it will supply 137 Cypress land based turbines in Sweden. A huge 753 MW. Will be largest land based wind farm in Europe. 753 MW is about as much power that is generated by a nuclear reactor.

"My dad worked for GE for 30 years, passed away away at 97 last year. He was GE all the way...everything we owned was GE. He was part of the Greatest generation.....saved saved saved....talk about being long on GE! Gifted my sister, brother and I 300 shares each back in 2000. At that time stock had already split 3 times, and stood at $60 per share. I am patient and I know GE will continue to rise. Leadership and vision still great."
Strategically it is the right thing to do for the company and leads to long-term success. The problem is that it cuts out the little guy. Simply put the average investor cannot afford to accumulate a $104 stock the way they can a $10 stock. The leasing deal actually was BETTER than expected for GE.
Can it also go higher as shares at this price are accumulated to increase numbers before the RS?
"GE trading nearly $4 over it's 200 sma. As mentioned, MONTHLY rsi = 87. Upgrades sold into. You got the picture yet?"
Reasonable price prediction for the week ahead?
"In feb Tusa cut his price target to 14.00 see quote https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/02/12/jp-morgan-cuts-general-electric-price-target-to-14.html................. So now after the company is in MUCH better shape the price target is lower? C'mon. Oil higher , cost cutting almost at 20 BL. pension better with rate increases. Just say'n."
RS is old newsNow starts the fundamentals whih have improved.
"I am new , can someone tell me how GE went from billions in free cash flow last earnings and more projected to come and now projecting negative cash flow for next quarter?"
This will be in the news. More investors coming in.
RUN SHORTS RUN!!!!
After RS seems price will hit 125 and year end 220
The indicators will need to be reset before going lower. Should get a decent bounce here but it is only an opp to short or get out of your long
GE is going up slowly but surely. So I decided to stop this stock from going higher.I bought 500 shares. This way when I have the stock. It won t go higher anymore
Double-down.
thank goodness I got out yesterday. wait until after split happens. every stock I have ever bought re; stock split went to zero. or very near it!

"If you can't see how blatant this intraday manipulation is by institutions (upgrades, massive deals, improving balance sheet... and short pressure every day) I feel sorry for you.. sure there may be better plays out there, and GE is a dog with such a huge float, but there is no way the US admin achieves their climate goals without GE. I'm expecting $12 after earnings in late January."
"in 30 years I can recall only one reverse stock split that went ok (for a while), ticker CIM - all others fell in market cap"
Perfect time for game changing news will be just prior to earnings - counting on it.
Im a Conservative and I vote. GE I own stock and I vote. Not a good financial move to Single out GOP when for 4 years Far left has pillaged and Rioted.Not a good financial move to #$%$ off 73 MILLION Voting Republicans. Companies cannot afford that loss. Geez Joe I can give you the $2 Million contract because our company is boycotting GE for targeting Republicans!! Get it?
Ge is dead. Market will crash GE go back to $5.00 again. May be $3.00 a share.
Shareholder accounting lawsuit against GE was dismissed. This could be bullish news.
DO NOT VOTE for the reverse split!You have the right to object this reverse split stupid idea by the CEO.
"I should have known , was so close to exit GE at 14.78 my cost less dividend , covered call income . Who knows now 3k shares . And my call income will decrease with this split. Barrons just ran a negative article but I do not have full access . Not sure why when things were finally turning that this idea pops up ."
Here is my prediction after the 8:1. GE will be heavily shorted. From 100$ to 10$ is a golden road for hedgies. They will never let this opportunity let go
Keep this in mind . GE at $40 to $50 is a very possibility price target in the next few years. If GE is considered the answer for a green environment stock then $50 is within reach not imaginary anymore.
"GE is ready for a break out. Might not be soon, but look promising!!"

"As a valuation investor, I feel I am a fool when I see so many stocks (such as MVIS,TLRY,GME,AMC,...) are up 10 to 100% everyday. These high flyers without much revenue and earnings,but the stock valuation of them are extremely high. No wonder when I told my friend about GE. Nobody pays any attention since they could have better return with buying any stocks. What type of crazy market we have now? GE keeps trading between $10.5 to $11.8 range. When will GE breakout? March?"
218 million shares traded...what the heck is going on?
If you follow Tusa price you would fail miserably in the past months. Remember He is making money out of YOU.
"Wow, reverse stock split... That's a good sign. LOL"
Just bought more GE calls! I think this is a buying opportunity!! Larry is a diamond in rough ;) He will rise!!
thoughts on this 1 for 8 reverse split idea GE leadership is floating in the news?
"I just found out something very interesting. I am a GE long, and own GE stock individually and in my managed brokerage account. I just checked my brokerage account this morning, and shares of GE are no longer in my account. It seems that the person who manages my account, unloaded GE yesterday. My sons account through another firm, did the same, but on Monday. I am wondering If this 1 for 8 reverse split news was leaked early to Wall Street, but retail investors. like me did not receive this information until yesterday. Seems like some big boys got the news early, and bailed out prior to the news."
"Clamor to get into GE a brew pre-market. Not getting my shares, no way Jose."
Their go’s a nice run up. What is ge going to save 4 cent a share on div after revers split. I do not get it
I don't care. I made some nice money off the lows on this stock and will now find something that offers a better upside and/or a nice yield. GE is a long way off from that now.
"GE NOT EVEN UP 100% from March Lows, 2008 Lows, but every Aviation BA, SPR, DAL, Travel, even brick mortar, total shutdown businesses are up 200% -- 500%..Yet GE still barely above 2008 lows, March Lows.. GE was already SEVERELY UNDERVALUED at $13 below $20, down from $30, did not take part in the longest running Bull-Market.. GE sitting on MOUNTAIN OF CASH AND LIQUIDITY $$100 BILLION in the USA and abroad..*GE is an EV Story, GE Aviation growth Story, GE Renewable is a growth story, GE Healthcare is a growth and life saving story..Even FORD UP 200%"
It's mindboggling to see Tesla increase in market capitalization by $100 billion today!!
Investor day is a joke the news is already out what they are going to announce -- late comers tomorrow are going to jump in on the news-- smart money will sell right in to it
I can imagine if CEO gets millions so will the Board of Directors. They are in it together.
Bully GE!
GE is rising high above the clouds; absolutely stunning!!
You can vote on the RS in May.
"DRYS had to do 8 reverse splits, a cumulative 11,760,000 shares for 1 before total liquidation. It took that long before people get it. NBG successfully executed 2 for a cumulative 150 shares for 1 before they were thrown of the stock market. It takes time guys."
so when is the best time to jump in? After the reverse.
If u panic don’t buy..
My company doesn’t celebrate Easter but it does MLK... This actually used to be a great country..
"EVERYONE, the reverse split is a PROPOSAL. Just write to GE investor relationship and say NO.There will be NO VOTING, NO PROPOSAL, NO SCENARIO.It's wild fantasy. GE going to $30 without a RS. The will start buying stock and move to $50. AS EASY AS THAT."

GE at best has never been much more than a 30.00 stock.. and you actually think investors will pay 105.00? The short sellers will absolutely destroy this.
What else can GE do for us???
Resistance!!!
You bet your sweet bippy!
"This is so sad, GE reports almost 5 Billion free cash flow, with Billions in revenue , and it fights to get above 12 dollars, and companies like Blink 60 bucks a share, plug and power 72 a share and pot stocks with no profit all 20 to 60 a share. go figure, Maybe GE should buy some shares back or raise the dividend, this is crazy....."
I reiterate $GE to $24 plus this year alone! I told you about the breakout that was coming and that was more than enough time for the shorts to cover their positions.
Reverse stock split.... GE heading down to $6.....
So negative cash flow for 2021 Q1 and the stock moves up today?Let's have more news like this!
"Has anyone heard from Tusa? more orders are coming .. UAE and Saudi just added more planes, Qatar Airline is next.. The biggest order is coming from China, some needs to help Tusa do THE MATH and count the money. GE-Boeing partnership is stronger than ever !!! wait for more good news ... I am the first to upgrade GE to Strong Buy with Target price of $20, GE will hit it before December. Go long Or Be Wrong !!!"
"It took 20days+ to get to its peak at $14+ and took just 2days to drop back to $12.19. Sad me, was at %50+ profit but will continue to long."

GE to $4
LOL...3 YEAR HIGH. JJ AT HIS GREATEST LOSS SINCE HE STARTED.
"A year ago GE was trading at $13, A year later is in better shape... paid down debts... GE should hit $13 soon if earnings are good."

"Looking at NOK, can hardly believe that dopeheads are trading 1 billion (!!) shares....Will be very interesting tomorrow, but not for shorties..."
GE showing improvement in all divisions...looking anxiously toward next earnings report... We should all be Happy!
"It was physiological. The stock ran non-stop from $6 to $14. Over 100% in 3 months, one of the best runs in 40+ years! Temporarily losing 20% was NORMAL. The company is in its best shape it has been and everyone now wants in. Even Tusa has a HOLD rating, LAUGHABLE!Conspiracy theorist would see last slump as a way for big banks to jump on the train before it reaches the $20 station in the next weeks. Believe what you want to believe. Just remember to stay greedy with your GE shares, you won't regret it!"
"Folks do not panic, RS will not happen specially a 1 to 8 split. There is no need for that and management have not made any decision yet. It is to be debated and voted on in MAY. Most likely shareholders will oppose and block it... Very disappoint myself of the timing of its announcement, it totally ruined the good news of all the upgrade and the $31B deal...............I am sitting tight and keep accumulating as much as I can"
"Some remarks to Tusa and his somewhat foggy remarks: GECAS had 2020 32 Ben USD external debt, which are eliminated by Culps deal. GECAS made 700 m losses in 2020. Insurance has no debt and made 160 m profits in 2020. The segment profits of 2021 could easily double, if Healthcare continues to be stable (which it almost was in 2020 to my surprise), Aviation catches 40% if 2019 business after a very difficult year 2020 and power/renewables improves (and GECAS losses disappear). All figures from GE 10k filing, which everybody can access. Tulsa’s language make things more unclear...if something is to criticize why to hide it with cloudy remarks which nobody understands ?

(I find 8 to 1 particularly nasty and I hope that y' all will remember this when it's time for proxy voting for board members.)(Keep in mind that a major increase in share prices will tend to drive away small investors and leave GE to the big corporations and funds. This is a really mean thing to do and builds huge negative karma. If the stock price isn't up significantly in a year after this reverse stock split, the board needs to go.)"

"just a quick comparison, ge share value 1 month ago same as today, as is dow value, .today same as one month ago.assuming ge 12 months target is 14 $, is that enough to hold a stock 1 year. i said it before, i use trading to up my returns"

The revenge of value stocks!
"Not good. Why the RS for company trading in teens? Concentrate on turning the company around, not a gimmick!"
Great Morning to All GE Investors!!!
"GE, American GREATEST CROWN-JEWEL. Without GE Products and Services USA & World economy GDP will come to a stop. AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, FB, lol NFLX, Banks can't claim that.. There are 1000 copy cat to AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, NFLX, banks, but ONE AND ONLY GE vital, so integral to world economy gdp, ie, transport, power, Aviation engin maker (the biggest by far, most reliable, only 2 smaller compitition unreliable with many technical issues).. One and only GE.. If NFLX was valued at $200 BLLION Mkt with $12 Bn revenue, giant compitition in streaming AAPL, GOOG YOUTUBE, DISNEY, COMCAST, HULU, FOX, Countless others, then, GE CROWN-JEWEL surely worth $2 TRILLION Mkt cap.."
"Option action very bullish on GE chart, mostly due to renewable business...chart master Carter Worth says chart could be looking at $13.5 or higher in short term!!"
"Dow up 300, GE down 29 cents. Another great day for shorts. Once again BAGGIES left holding the bag."
Fundamental picture only brightening. R/S is a ruse to steal your shares. Resist and buy more. Going much higher. Tusa bound to lose his job over his resistance.
I am new to the market. What price would you all recommend I purchase at?
Shorts you better check yourselves......quickly!!
"After hours closes .10 lower than yesterday’s Tusa comments. If we can get a large premarket push Monday, we will be in a great position for Tuesday"
GE to $15 soon.....
"SHOOTER16 hours agoI have owned GE many times over the past 4 decades and for the majority time done including this last disposal upon the notice of a reverse stock split. I have NEVER seen anything good come from a reverse stock split NEVER!!!! I hope I am because I am planning on re entering GE at a lower price, MAYBE!!!!I think this latest sale for/of leasing operation is a good move and think a few more have to go as well.I held GE back in Jack Welch days, excellent CEO!!!But those days are gone and if anyone can bring GE back it is Larry Culp, yet I don't like a reverse stock split of this magnitude. Maybe a 1 for 2 but not much more than that. JMHO from experience.LessReply62MarkMark16 hours agoMany longs have bought to average down price. to get a bigger multiplayer as shares rose. so a reverse split does kill the time it takes to recover. your losses from higher purchases. stock will recover much slower at 90 to 100 share price. Let's face it they are poor competitors and operators. recent gains had more to do with a low share price compared to market. rs is is bad and should be a much lower rd like a 1 for 5. that would reduce 4 billion shares and I would of not sold my 1k shares."
Great Day to All GE Investors!!! 
The spy brike 370 going down expect a bounce back.
"A Shareholder will not lose money on the reverse split in and of the split itself. ... The reverse split increases the price to a level that increases pro trading activity, often boosting the stock price higher."
@marabound took the #1 spot for being a low life. Yeahhhh
"Like I predicted, $20 is coming"
we trust culp up tomorrow over a buck in my opinion
"Air travel will boom early July, once majority of Americans can get vaccinated. GE Aviation will then will drive earnings to 45 to 60 cents 3rd quarter and generate $8-10bln industrial FCF. We're probably headed near 20 coming this July."
"Totally agree with you bandit, I’m an airline pilot and long on GE! $20 end of 2021!"
"BA has exploded due to nearing deal with Southwest for 737MAX which would be beneficial for GE as well. If it wasn’t for the RS announcement, we could have crossed higher than $15 for sure. Though too early to say what happens in MAY but we should let the board realize that RS is bad and it already wiped off $20B in market cap in just couple of days and there could be more shedding if Culp doesn’t gain investors confidence. I say NEY to RS and instead please concentrate in growth of the company by getting more business contract."
"Anybody know what the share price needs to be for Mr Culps huge, and well deserved payday??"
"Fewer shares keeps short away. those who are nervous sell now. All these negative comments and GE Is down 20 cents, no seller and shorts are in hiding."
"great conf call - upbeat but realistic. Order and Margin improvements already materializing.2021 should be a great year for GE with 2H21 ramping up as Aviation comes back online. Culp stated they are already getting airlines to queue up for engine maintenance in advance of the return to the air, so service revenue will improve dramatically as capacity to service is fixed."
"I said yesterday it would be in the low 12's, now it looks like it will head south of that. So the news wiped out billions. Nice job Culp. I am long ang will buy more below 12. GLTA"
ge already has the largest offshore wind turbine operating near nordic country. A single blade is longer than a football field. This thing is a monster!
..when the Reverse Split again??...
"I'm holding for the long haul because GE is transforming into a lean powerhouse that's set to benefit immensely from the reopening of the economy. The r/s was an incredibly unnecessary announcement. Culp just opened the floodgates for all the haters and shorts that he had previously silenced. Regardless, this r/s hysteria will die down by next week. This stock is set to hit $20 this year, because it is built on fundamentals and a ever-improving balance sheet. finally, dont believe any of the clowns that say Culp's bonus share-price target wont also be altered by a reverse split. If he receives a bonus at achieving $25/share and we do the 1-to-8 split, then his new bonus target is $200/share. Do not listen to these clowns on this board. They've been getting their teeth kicked in the last 4 months. Unfortunately Culp did this garbage to wake them back up"
bought 600 shares more yesterday and nervous.
day traders are sensing they are trapped that buy at 13 isn't working --when they bail the water fall decline starts
This is a short candidate
"Shorts now getting burned. Tusa has lost his credibility. GE finally in the teens, could we see 20s within a year."
"More brownouts, blackouts, and Pratt & Whitney jet engine burn-ups please! Buy."
With democrats at the helm we are heading for a liquidity crisis and stagflation. Luckily during the Great Depression microcap stocks outperformed because they don't need much liquidity.
"When Culp goes out to dinner with other CEOs they are bragging how their stock price is in the 100s while GE is/was $14.00. Culp said to himself, I need to get GE's stock price up fast."
"About to breakout here, should push nicely past $15 in near term. Air travel about to explode, covid dying off fast now."
At least they are savings 10's of millions of dollars every month on the pension funds that almost killed the company. Due to the age of the covid deaths that do not have to receice a pension anymore (that was underfunded). Big relief for GE.................................
"incredible, the market maker move predicted .29 cent move today. GE did just that. Yet we got good news going foward, I take the 2.73% any day."
"...........when ""they"" MM's let this thing blow up (just a little).......it will be a fun day."
It’s still not too late to hop on JJ....
"RS is nothing but noise designed to shake of weakies and remain with long term shareholders, that is why W Buffet never split and retains life long shareholders at over $300,000/sharealso has nothing to with ""RS always end up in bankruptcy, see HOV in the last 5 years with a RS of 1:25"
"Everyone Do a screen capture now, so you can remember what you could have got in at! LOL"
"Sell Covered or Naked Call Options every week for strike price 0.5 - 1.00 above the Monday's opening price ...Milk the system, the MMs are doing this every week .."
"Bad news for Pratt, good news for GE. I expected .50 up for GE today"
had they not announced RS we would be above 15 right now....
it for a market correction which should get around 15% correction fairly soon .
15 today
The problem with reverse splits is that they most always result in a decline in share price over time unless the company does really well post split. That ain't GE. Psychologically much easier to short a $90 stock than a $13 stock. Maybe GE is worried about being Gamestopped at the current share price. I'm out.
10 tomorrow.
"if you are newbies, please check how an army of law firms were suing $GE for misleading investors (it happened 2-3 years ago). Look where GE is today and will be tomorrow. If you are convinced of $UAVS technology and its future, then this is the best time to get in or lower your average cost. $NIO went from ~$10 to $1.19 within few months when bad news were circulated and recirculated. I spent months reading on $nio and got on board at $1.6 back on Oct 2019, when everybody was crying bankruptcy. Hope $uavs will be another million maker like $nio. These treasury bond triggered panic selling was a simple shake moving money from small to big pockets. More such events may occur...only the patient ones who can read will be rewarded in full."

"Funny , nobody was complaining about day traders when the stock hit 14 ? Now all the posts try to rationlize the RS as stopping day traders . That is absurd. It was instituional selling the last few days . Super high volumes. Always the same MANTRA nonsense. Day traders holding the stock back. But when the stock is soaring , nary a word on the trades. I recall the same thing when DAL was falling because of n Covid of course . As it went back and forth it was the day traders. From 29 to 34 it was day traders, day traders . Once it began the climb from 35 to 49 never a mention .Yes, for every seller there is a buyer. But again the posters leave out that when a stock declines that means more sellers than buyers."
"GE was supposed to sell healthcare off and give ALL of the proceeds to shareholders. Culp killed it. Ge's WAB deal was halved to shareholders by Culp. Culp cut the dividend from 12c to 1c. BKR was purchased at the top of the oil market and then they sold a portion at the bottom by Culp. Guess how much Culp gave shareholders. Culp is getting big bonuses for hitting price targets near term. Guess what the RS does for him? You know, King Larry? EPS projections for 2021 have just been slashed below ALL expectations. What is it going to take for you to realize this isn't a recovery but another CEO C suiter that is taking YOUR money?"
first crack in the 50 DMA since October -- first recuse normal next time the stock is finished -next real test of the 50 is next week -- no trading on Monday so it is 4 days to the 50---hell is coming
"yep I was one of the fortunate ones to invest in GE at 6 bucks. but I didn't invest enough. I accumulated over 25,000 shares between 6:00 and 10 bucks and I will not sell so long as Larry culp is the CEO. Larry knows what he is doing plain and simple. I have a theory and it's totally one thing always invest in a CEO don't invest in a company. if you follow good smart executive CEOs just follow them and you will never lose a dime in the stock market. another CEO I'm following is Sue Nabi. she is the best in the industry hands down nobody better. she also took the helm of a company that was dragged into the ground by four CEOs in 6 years. I won't mention the company for those of you that do your own research look her up and see what company she is running now it's absolutely a great opportunity to get in. she'll turn this company around and 1 to 2 years and triple your money in a #$%$ market. and it's a recession proof market. good luck everybody"
GECAS deal is excellent; reverse split means nothing but simplification.
Culp will shuffle the deck......unleash shareholder value. That’s what great CEOs do. Culp is a great CEO.
"There are actually fundamental benefits to the reverse split. While of course many companies that perform a reverse split continue to be dismal investments, some that turned out to work out very well were Priceline, Laboratory Corp. of America, Corrections Corp. of America, Titanium Metals, Raytheon, and Intuitive Surgical."
reverse split news have bigger effect than any future good ge news
"Who foretold on here that the share price would hit $100?? Kudos man, you’re a genius!"
Waking up to a reverse split on any stock you own.
"My 2 cents for $GE. they need to jump in to structural composite business targeting EV makers, $TSLA, $F, $GM. GE has a lot of composite know-how, from aviation and wind turbine businesses, that will be a perfect match for making EV lighter enabling more battery mileage. Any such partnership with an EV maker will sky rocket GE value."
"In 4 years, GE’s giant wind turbines will be everywhere. Hundreds of thousands of them. Bringing good things to life."
GE was very good to me this year. Happy New Year everyone! See you at $14
But what about the precious Six Sigma strategy? They told me it was a winner for sure.
"with COVID relief passed Senate, the market will celebrate. Next is infrastructure bill to kick start the economy."
We back to 5T:13.06
"Don’t forget July 4th. This Independence Day is being threatened with an growing oppressive federal government. We have a incredible constitution that ensures Civil Liberties. Not the government, nor anyone can force another into a healthcare choice they do not want. Your Body, Your Choice. People should question, even more so after the speech last night, the science behind this push to vaccinate every American. Employing “Vacinators.” Frightening prospect when he said, “I need you.” That’s the Army’s old marketing slogan. Be careful folks, your liberty is at stake."
The RS is a smoke screen. Look at their projections for EPS. They are still struggling bigly. NOT growing but shrinking the business.

As the airline industry rebounds and they look to return to profits they will buy more fuel efficient jets that utilize GE engines. Great for GE!

"Am I the only person that thinks this is a complete overreaction to the reverse split?Yes reverse splits generally go down but that is because most of them are reverse splitting to avoid being delisted. That is not the case here.This seems to be more of a play toward institutional investors but I think today’s drop is not based on fundamentals of the companyIf it was, the only thing that has changed is a deal adding 30 billion to the positive and a new partnership."
"Wall Street Mafia's tactics: If selling doesn't cause the stock price to drop, they will drop the share price to cause selling! That's is the only explanation for this trickle down price erosion every day with less than half the daily average trading volume!"
GE has been doing all the right things to provide a better business plan that includes strengthening the company for the future and to provide a solid escalating share price to retain and attract future share holders. I feel very positive about their 5 Year Plan.
GE will go back near $13 by this Friday and >=$13.5 by next Friday. Accumulate more if the bears pushed it under $12.5 again ( I don’t believe it will)
No RS announced by GE. This news was leaked to see how the market react. Now they know and will not do a RS. it is a great buying opportunity for investors and GE's shares buy back.

"So much negativity surrounding this news. The company isn't failing, but actually getting better. Retail investors will have a harder time to buy but day traders and shorts will most likely get swept away. Institutional buying will increase, that's what moves the share price. I'm holding."
"Apparently Tusa agrees with me. He maintains his target of $5, say that $12 is unsustainable and has to cut in half. At $5, a reverse split makes sense.mead20146 hours ago$GE conversationReverse split puts share price at over $100 at current price. Too high in my opinion. One way or another, price will drop. That is why I sold. If it drops to $50-$60 post split or $6 -$8 presplit, I am back in. Otherwise I move on to other opportunities. GE has never been investor friendly."

Finally getting the volume necessary for large % moves - 200 mil per day target. Look for news pre-earnings week and then post earnings week - get the big bang for the buck. Chart is outstanding - first major resistance was $11.50 level - then it's a fight to the annual high at $13.26. We all know what happens after $13.26 is breached.
Think about it. The handful of companies that make up 90% of the market count have a handful of buildings jam-packed with computer hard-drives but don't literally produce anything tangible worldwide that drives societies. Its no wonder Apple is trying to get into the EV market. Meanwhile companies like GE literally power and move the world.
I am down 1.4% of my portafolio and am 79% in cash. ready for buy more GE under 10.5.

All take a breath...relax and take a look at GE 1 month chart. What do you see? I see a step ladder of higher lows and higher highs. Today does not break the pattern...we are at the low point of the next highest low...next move is next higher high...everyone just chill AND...be Happy!

Biden will push wind very hard over next two years and it will be great for GE; patience grasshoppers. I'm just a little sorry that it doesn't appear GE will get too involved (if any) on all the great EV charging stations that will soon be dotting the landscape. I'm used to seeing the GE symbol on anything electrical; it's a name I trust very much. I hope they square the whole charging station deficiency in the near future. We'll see.

"20 holdings, GE is only one down today (3/10), apparently due to news about 1-8 reverse split. Just as an increase in share price in response to an announced forward split is irrational, this fall in price in response to announced reverse split is irrational. A modest buying opportunity."

If they have any dignity and respect for the function they have been elected for I expect them to return all bonuses and submit resignation."
GE looking to get back into the DJIA. I like it. DJIA is a price weighted index. GE needs a higher price to get back in. I like management’s aggressive style.
overreaction. Nothing changes for the company itself. GE is on a good way to recover. RS makes no impact.

Now, GE is crucial to America. Makes over $100 billion. Yet, it is trading at $12. This world is absolutely messed up."
told u couple of days ago it was a great buying opportunity congratulations to those who listen
What’s the driver for the US Market going forward. Guess that’s my question which is much broader than GE. What comes after this stimulus bill? Is the Market in general due for a correction?
This will be the first reverse stock split that actually turns out favorably. Culp breaks the mold again? Buy.
Finally a high volume day...let’s see this jump before tomorrow’s earnings call.

JJ did you take my advice and cover? Don't be greedy and regret. (your words)
Low volume and still going up. nice. More buyers than sellers
When you sell off 65% of gains on earnings days that basically tells you investors have little interest or faith in owning this long..
Calling all volume police - come on man - need 150 mil plus here to get this moving - bring on the earnings already!
"We expect GE’s financial engineering house of cards to collapse, massive interest obligations, declining revenue, scale deleveraging and margin deterioration all will continue to drive lower free cash flow. Multiples will have to come in to match cash flow declines, our 24 month price target is $3.19 implying a 400% decline from current Share price"
You couldn't get away from this train wreck fast enough....sell sell sell....
"What make you think the reverse split is a bad move? Look at what it did for NBR and many other stocks. Again, today they will shake out the weak investors. Better days ahead Long 15k shares. Culp knows what he is doing."
"day trading is okay. otherwise, it's no hope for investment in long. not worth it. stay away. Larry Sculp may trick you."
Am very disappointed at the way Larry Culp handles the RS
How long Culp has been at the helm? GE is down 20% during the past one year (Jan '20 - Jan '21)..
How is this stock pps manipulated within one penny.??
"Along with the RS, GE is getting a new trading symbol: #$%$"
so the logic is we'll wait for the bad news to catch up to the good news and then released all at the same time
I’m guessing bankruptcy is next

"THE BOARD SHOULD BE FIREDThis is truly one of the Worst Ideas that I have ever seen a major corporation make. If you are going to thin the ranks of hard working GE employees ...Then Fire the Board. These ""Brilliant Minded"" individuals concocted and promoted this idea. The stock will eventually Tank at least 30% form recent highs."
"Reverse Split that GE did is just to crush retail investors, and this is Criminal on their part"
Lawd ha mercy!!
I bought in $10.85
"Oh Warren, where are you???? GE is another perfect buyout opportunity for BRK. Long term prospects getting better than anything over last 5 years; now is the time to strike BRK; when you can still get a great deal. Don't wait until it gets to 17 or 18 to make your bid; ""do it now....come on ""buy"" me.... do it do it nowwwwwww...."" LOL!!!"
"Another day, another$. Get some rest and tomorrow is another day my Friends!"
got in around 6 as a long term investment. is it time to sell?
"Oh the good ideas coming forth;1. $50,000 student loan forgiveness.2. Fed meeting on interest rates. (Take baby steps so as not to excite people. A good round figure would be 4%.)3. It's about time for someone to bring up the $15.00 per hour once more.4. GAS RATIONING - Yep! Will be here before you know it."
Love You GE!
"I now think GE truley has a smart CEO, pay off debts, reverse spilt stock so mature investors will invest to avoid robinhood and game store, right now the stocks is too low, until the shre become more expensive to buy and manulipate 1-8, the CEO smart, leaseing aircraft make cash but pandemic will make travel less likely to get quick cash fast. Good move."
i wonder if they will make a statement saying they're no longer considering the RS. i don't think it's out of the question. and the stock would pop back hard...
It is nice to see GE retested $11.95 area. GE’s stock is building momentum here. I expect the price will rise above $12 in 10 days. Bears will last struggle and try to push it down $11.5. We might be able to accumulate some more shares around $11.5. This will be the last chance to see GE around $11.5
Does any one know why or have there posts get stuffed or deleted?. This is the second time i've posted. This is honest information and it is my opinion.
We are all shareholders (maybe small ones) but still have a vote on this reverse split nonsense. Artificially raising the share price from a psychological standpoint is a bad move in my opinion. Let the company keep competing and winning with Culp and the share price will move up on its own. GE should buy back shares if they want to reduce shares outstanding. I feel like GE is making a bad move here. I was a long-term holder but not sure any more.
After this 12 year bull market finally crashes.. GE will follow back to 5.00. Thank your democratic liberal race baiters

"Wow the earnings are so great, the price will be $4 soon."
"The travel industry will be on a tear in another few months and by summer the world will be flying.By fall and Thanksgiving and Christmas everyone will be beyond the virus scare.By year end 2021 General Electric will be way up in stock price in the teens .At the 4th quarter 2021 the stock will report FCF of around $8 billion for the year 202.The stock price by year end or in January 2022 will be passing through $20.I can only imagine the 2022 stock price as the FCF goes up. Perhaps approaching $30So if you are on the fence on what to do - it is obvious....Culp always understates and he is doing that now. His results will be a lot better than he is admitting to the world today.I have owned a extremely large GE position since I bought in August at $5.98 and have multiplied since then.Ignore the ignoramousouses that only recommend s stock AFTER IT EXPLODES and not before it advances.That is a lousy way to invest.Use your own common sense and you will prosper.And tune out the JP Morgan Stephen Tusas, and the $5 depression stock price kooks, and the ridiculous GE shorts, and all the other doom and gloomer stock dabblers..It will happen in spite of these deranged people who are definitely not investors with a long term horizon ahead."
"Steve , well over your level of understanding but here is an example of BLOOD IN STREET this week03/08/21 Sold Short 10 AAPL Mar 12 '21 $114 Put(AAPL) @ $0.95 Unassigned 945.33If I close today 900.00 profit , holding as of now till Friday extra 45.33 total 945.33"
"GE STRONG BUY, 1% short same as AAPL, AMZN, GOOG..#1..So many Institutions ADDED around 2 BILLION share-counts to their GE positions, ie, Fidelity added around 400 million, Vanguard Group added 400 million, T.Rowe Price Group added 450+ MILLION share counts, StateStreet, Virginia Pension, and many more institutions, pension and sovereign funds added MILLIONS too. Don't forget the little mom & pop, us little retail investors who are adding MILLIONS of shares to our humble investments.. Toosa is putting JPM or their clients on the hook to deliver $$30+ BILLION worth of shares, perhaps that is why Toosa aka Markapolos desperately threw the whole kitchen sink at GE multiple times. All said and done, when dust settles, someone, collective group are on the hook to deliver those HUGE number of shares. I believe Toosa's unprecedented foolish ego put our dear JPM's & Clients' huge amount of resources on the hook, in danger, and it's many times BIGGER disaster than the ""JPM London Whale $6 BILLION LOSS"", GOOGLE about it.. I LOVE JPM as I LOVE GE, both are American, contributing in very important matters. But GE stands tall over JPM as the PRICELESS CROWN-JEWEL of America, none can fill GE shoes, hardly competition ever existed. JPM, AAPL, GOOG, AMZN etc can NOOT claim this, because they have 1000s of copy cats, GE near monopoly.. I humbly suggested our dear JPM to replace Toosa before he and his buddies cause further damage to HUGE RESOURCES of JPM & Clients, and their reputation..#2 PRICELESS GE CROWN-JEWEL of America. For USA/World, it is absolutely imperative, absolutely must to have GE PRODUCTS & SERVICES, FED-$DOLLAR to function and grow World Commerce/Economy GDP. Not even AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, lol NFLX, JPM, WMT, none can claim that enviable position except GE, and US Gov-FED $$DOLLAR.. Even AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, JPM, WMT, OIL & Gas have MILLIONS of copy cats, lessor quality, but others can do the job AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, JPM, WMT doing.. Just think, study GE products and you will quickly know what I am referring to. Aviation-Engines, GE Healthcare chips, softwares, critical emergency-room machines, from big MRI, X-Ray, CT-Scanners to tinny hand held devises that count your heart-beats, pulses, while you or your dearest ones clinging to last ray of hope to be alive and saved. These GE products & services, machines & equipments, Intellectual Properties are PRICELESS TREASURE-TROVEs.. GE Intellectual property Assets in Healthcare is Microfluidics which makes Healthcare Bio-Chips and Bio-sensors work by Emergency bedside diagnostics, also diagnostics in Bio-Chips.. Same goes with GE Aviation, same goes with GE Military Marines Systems, Growth in surface Vessels & Submarines propulsion, 10-15 years Growth areas.. GE has some compelling innovation portfolio in this area, none talks about it.. That is the GE CROWN-JEWEL I am referring to...."
"Lunchtime in NYC, best time to buy. When the power brokers return, the stock should gain. They will want to increase their positions before next week's run back to $15. That's my gut.Could be indigestion. I've been wrong before. But, I'm feeling it.Go, GE!Good luck, longs."
What caused the big drop in futures? Was +150 now down -10
GE going to $15 then $20 on the yearly agenda!
GE.. simply no buying interest or buying power other than Wall Street manipulation
So many people bashing GE. Did you notice most of the market is down significantly? Jeez.
This stock will be 16$ by end of this week!
where are the shorts
Back to the 12's today.
Maybe GE should not do the reverse stock since this will cause the stock to drop down to $6 again. Cancel such a deal. Let small investors able to invest with lower prices. This way more people can invest in GE
Gap down at the open...Sell Covered calls to milk the system.
I am already hearing the board will not approve 8-1 RS... !!!!!
Why did outstanding shares increase by over 60M since 2018 when every other reputable company is buying back shares?
"So assuming that GE loses their dividend completely, which is what some are saying Culp may do, what do you all suppose that would move the stock price to...$8/shr? Serious opinions only please."
"F COVID and F the FAANG. Buy industrials. Time to get back to to the fundamentals. GE has finally put the financial crisis behind them, by dissolving GE capital. GE has powered through covid. Bring on the next decade "

Big volume
Boeing monthly aircraft orders outpace cancellations for first time since 2019. Good news for GE.
"With market cap over 100 billions, ge stock is dirt cheap"
"This is nuts. Why not buy back shares. You cut dividend, then sell assets and then reverse split so that you will be like you competitors. wow!“The reverse stock split would decrease the number of shares outstanding to a number more typical of companies with comparable market capitalization,” GE said in a statement."
GE will be one of the best performing stocks in 2021. Tony Balooga picked GE as his bottom fishing stock of the year last August. He’s never wrong. Tony thinks $24 is where GE is headed with a V shaped recovery.
"If you compare GE with its competitors on the basis of cashflow per share in 2021.GE has a 12 ratio while Siemens and Honeywell are going with 30-40 ratios!Yes GE has more debt (which is enormously shrinking), but if competitors get 30 ratio, let's penalize GE by a 30-40% factor due to debt and give it a 20 ratio, FAIR! That translates to a $20 a share for GE. Not 12 not 13, not 14, $20 TODAY.If that is the case, clearly if the BOD really wants a reverse split, it could be 1/5 or even 1/4. Once that is clarified and communicated to investors, I expect the price per share to skyrocket.If this is the master plan then OK, Guillermo will start applauding right now. Bravo!Stay greedy my friends!"
Please sell your shares on the this reverse split news. I will be buying the dip and HODL!
Greek banks and shipping companies used reverse split to eliminate retail investors and scam money into CEOs pocket. Citi bank reverse split at $5 and has stay at $5 for the past 10 years or more. How will this work out? We will see. Remember that GE promised us a windfall at $30. That has put a new meaning into wind fall. More like turd fall.
Another Friday flush..
"Tusa will add 5 points one of these days, $15.50 in the two weeks unless Tusa comes out from under his ""rock"""
Too bad this board of directors didn't take advantage of buying back shares over the past year when prices were as low as $6per. Seems I recall hearing RS are last ditch effort to prop up share price. Is that worth $40 plus million bonus?
"NEW YORK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - General Electric Co accused a Siemens Energy AG subsidiary of using stolen trade secrets to rig bids for lucrative contracts supplying gas turbines to public utilities, and cover up improper business gains totaling more than $1 billion, according to a lawsuit filed on Thursday."

I smell a 1-25 reverse split on the horizon!
This reverse split noise is for small investors and will be like a one nigjt standWill not matter
I would buy GE when it becomes $14 after reverse split ....
"Seems to me Richard sold at a loss and now wants everyone else to lose. No discipline, just a poor newb."
"This evening, Fast Money’s Guy Adonis and Karen Finestein both said GE would be significantly higher in one year than it is now. They’re never wrong."
Good Day to All GE Investors!!! 
"Hey JJ, did you cover? Or do you still plan for more bleeding........."
That's pretty impressive that General Electric had insider buys Friday
I am posting about the future of GE as it said on CNBC but it is being erased each time. 600% is expected.
looks pretty stable...
Up big tomorrow
Culp came to GE from Danaher. Pull a chart for Danaher. He knows how to deliver for shareholders.
powell panic time -- bond vigilantes just came to his picnic --- no rate hike for 2 years--they just did it for him
GE will sink more when in April earnings report seasons.
"This is dirt cheap . Stock up now . its not going to $9 ever again . , Maybe mid 10's"
Next couple ER's and outlook downgrades for big tech will drive this higher. The Infrastructure stimulus will be extra icing on the cake...
GE recovers today from the previous drop
"@ Jon ""Jon13 days agoReplied to a reactionTesoro Enterprises, Inc.This is positive for those long in TSNP. A reverse stock split reduces the number of issued shares but without changing the total value of all shares issued. With a reverse stock split, you end up owning fewer shares but each share is worth more that the original""Which is it? Good or bad. I don't like reverse splits either but if the company keeps share price high volatility should be kept lower and maybe they can could also raise dividend back up? Maybe?"

"Hi fellow shareholders, I think it may help to write to investor relations and expressing the fact we do not think reverse split makes sense at this point of recovery. You can list a myriad of reasons available from the chats here. I sent an email to IR. email address is on GE website. My hope is that the message will get to the board and in any case, will not hurt. What do you think?"
"excellent Tusa news!Everytime he opens his mouth, GE goes up.tread some water here, perhaps a little bump until the 25th, then up to the next plateau for a while.GE is extremely well positioned now - and only set to improve in 2021 and beyond."
Overall GE $30 a share sounds good?
Write in proxy vote for Immelt. He is at least better than any current BODs.
People are selling on great news. Buy this dip!
The best time to buy was under $12.00. The second best time is now.
OVER REACTION TO THE NEWS OF REVERSE SPLIT caused stock downhill; other wise selling the leasing jet unit was welcomed specially with $25B in cash and 111M share of the Aercap company was a great deal you ask me............reducing debt and having a cleaner balance sheet will have GE save millions on interest alone putting Ge in better position to pay dividend and attract investor..........
Hopefully we get stay around $13.20-13.40 today! Or higher.

"Reverse split good strategic initiative to reduce shares outstanding to 1.1B and line up with industry peers. This is what CFO just stated , that’s it . PERIOD.quit whining......CulpHas the wheel , he is 100% behind every strategic move , this will play out well."
Going red.
Even if GE is at 10.30 friday next week the 10.5p would be at around .20 cents.
"So, to all the whiners whining about being ""kicked out of owning GE"", why not do this: It goes to $10 (maybe, I doubt it actually, but I hope so). Load up. It goes back up to $14 if not $15 before split, IF it even happens. You just KNOW it's going back up, and you also KNOW Culp will be announcing more huge things before then -- he's the master of timing, if you haven't noticed yet. Every single announcement comes with great news to set off horrible news. The thing is, post-split it's going to be great news after great news. So, yeah, load up now, you're up 20-30% before split. If it goes down 20%, no big deal. You got all your shares and don't have to pay $100 per. Then you're not ""excluded"". I guess everyone here is an annoying day trader and that's why you guys cry b/c it's harded to buy/sell 50 times a day at $100. That must be it."
Thanks a lot TODD for clarifying and yesI did hear the reverse split usually is sign of negativity....
I mute pyramid game invitations that are invading every message board as paid slaves follower master order.
JJ...you there? Hello?I bet your 10 dollar loss on your 3 shares you shorted is going to be tough. Tell mom you need more allowance and maybe reverse course.I am guessing even Tusa will be reversing today
Great buying opportunity right now.
It’s turning the corner. 2 more years and it’s flying again
when the REVERSE SPLIT GET APPROVE NEXT MONTH -- YOU WILL SEE GE CRASH BIG TIME HJEHEHEE
The GE 10.5 seven day put option is selling for .17 cents. That is 10.33 before commision. before the bell that put could be sold necked for more if ge goes lower a d is doing itvnow. I am a biver that we will have before the close or AN HOUR AFTER mondays secion the first of Feb
I have been holding on my GE shares for a decade. The dollar average is $29.. I will buy more to bring mire dollar cost average to around $25. Hopefully I will break even by the end of the year.
GE's 3 year recovery is paying off at the same time that the pandemic is winding down. How high will the stock go this year?

What are you nuts doing by selling this stock. It amazes me that people are worried about a reverse split. This stock has mega potential and it’s not in any financial trouble. If it happens so be. Have faith in the management team. They have done an amazing job bring this company back. Stop the selling and enjoy the profits.
"Let me guess, Tusa not fixated on the bottom line lol. Buy as much as want below $15."

"Daily pattern for GE: up early in the morning by 25 cents and close either flat or in Red. Even on the best of the best days GE struggles to stay positive. Despite all sorts of good news and upgrades, it just has hard time moving up. Very boring for the past few weeks."
GE will be the “comeback kid” of 2021. GE will begin firing on all 4 cylinders. Cash will start pouring in.

"This RS is not just a 1 man Call, It also will invlove Board of Directors. Not all will be fools , there is definitely a reason behind this call especially Now when Company is best footed with1) Less debt 2) Improving revenue 3) Boom in Infra Industry.4) Aerospace Boom5) Company entering multiple booming sectors ( You never know they will partner in the hottest Crypto and EV sector too )6) With so many Trillions of $$ pumped by FED/Govt in Economy for Infra 7) No Fundamental Changes Just buy and Hold and Enjoy the Profits that will come daily."

"The secret sauce is renewables.Only 3 real players and Siemens sells about $10. billion this year, makes 2-3% net, and profit is around $$30 million.For GE that is a rounding error.Vestas is even more of a weak competitor.Not much offshore and years behind. They have been the leader for 2 decades before GE came swooping to their area.Also does about the same sales volume as Siemens.Both Siemens and Vests have lost solid loyal customers in the last 0 days to GE and that is because GE has lower cost, better equipment, nd more muscle to deliver timely.Ironically the wind market is so large and growing so fast that all three will approach the 8% Vests has enjoyed. Possibly more.The World Wind Wind industry report says the industry needs 30% more turbines in the next 8 years and only 3 firms to supply them."

"Only the beginning of bad news, see you at $4"
Nice move GE board. Most stocks are green with the DOW up about 300. But our great investors day news drives share price down along with losing 15 billion in market cap in 1 day. Two thumbs up to you losers.
And part of the reason for the soaring broadmarket was the fresh supply of cash from the liquidation of GE
After Hours is giving it all back!
10 year up sharply what is the breaking point for stocks
"Longs, give GE some more time. It re tested $11.95 area last two days. The longer it stays >=$11.5 area, the more underline strength it builds. My strategy is to buy and accumulate more GE if it drop under $11.5. This is an long term investment. Time is at at our Longs hand. GE will get better since aviation sector will get better!"
GE stuck back at 1995 level. Remember only 5 stocks gave 80% gain in the S&P 500 in 2020. Most did fantastic last year. Take profits. Rotation into low priced value stocks very soon. IMHO.
"GE shares are reiterated with a Buy rating and $11 price target by Bank of America's Andrew Obin, saying GECAS has a strong and resilient business model with ""manageable"" writedowns.GECAS could average free cash flows of $1.5B/year during 2020-22, according to BofA."

"Motley Fool report is spot on. Just read it. I've been saying this for some time. OK, why I say $3-$5 this year. Btw, I am not an expert and I have no short positions. Sorry for long note but hopefully this will help those who are on the fence. I worked at GE back in the 90s as a young lad and learned so much about management from the great Jack. Great company to work for back then. My division got sold off for pennies because we were not #1 or #2 in the industry and holy cow he threw us out like trash but he meant what he said, no BS. Tons of integrity and self empowerment. Some of the smartest people I ever worked with at GE. Enough of background so u know I am not pulling this out of my butt. GE under crushing debt and if rates rise it will be hammer time. Larry is a great turnaround CEO only if he can monetize the existing business. No doubt he will make the company leaner and more efficient but that won't be enough. He has to raise revenue. Ok, can he raise revenue in jet engines, healthcare and power. 3 core business. Jet Engines: business travel, core part of airlines is not coming back ever as virtual tech improves, unless u believe ecommerce will slow down and more malls will pop up.Healthcare: Very possible but only if they innovate. They stop innovating long time ago... e.g., MRI is dying tech. I can't believe we still use that old tech... We put a man on the moon and that's the best we can do? when was the last time u got an MRI and doctor said, wow that was helpful. every time I get it, the doctor doesn't even look at it. u get the point... lots of old tech at GE. Power: This could be a possibility. As demand for electricity increases via EVs and bitcoin mining (j/k) they can supply electricity via nuclear power plant unless Tesla innovates faster via solar renewables. We had nuclear power and the liberals said no. very expensive... nothing like natural gas. Bottom Line. The turn around of this company is not just about ""cleaning up the mess"". It is about competing with their disrupters. This is where Cathie Wood is right (I don't own a single share of her ETF). GE could be obsolete in 10 years. Can Larry turn GE into an innovation company like it once was, remember this was the company of Edison... OMG. I am gonna say NO because all the young bright minds don't want to work for GE. I love GE, that's my generation Apple. But to young kids they would rather work for amazon or tesla etc... GE doesn't have the same pop like it once did so it will lose out on talent acquisition and there lies the death of this company. Btw, this applies to all legacy companies but they just don't have a mountain of debt like GE so they will last another 30 years vs GE only 5 years and then done. I am making broad statements here with some exaggeration to make the point... u can hopefully piece this together. I've lost lots of money listening to the ""suits"" do your own research, don't believe what you see or hear on MSM."
"As I stated 3-4 months ago.. GE steady climb to $16 with ""No major short squeeze"" .. short-covering is still continuing, accumulation started and continuing. Smart money is still rotating out of expensive Covid-Related tech stocks and unloading speculative positions in EV stocks (NIO, LI, XPEV, etc..), cashing out profit from FAANG stocks and pushing into more stable industrial giants like GE is currently happening.. We will see more serious GE upgrades and good news, and ultimately higher target to $16-$18-$20 bucks before year-end... Buy GE or buy the calls for June to Jan. My favorite is GE $15 Jan 2021 !!!"
"Yo can't spell ""garbaGE"" without GE being in itBreathe in deeply, think a little, let it settle down a bit"
Buying on this dip for long term. Reduce shares available in the future is good.
Imagine this fictitious scenario -Tusa got his walking paper from his employer. Tusa turns against his employer by telling the story how he was pressured to keep GE down for as long as possible. He actually thinks GE turn-around was 2 quarters ago but could not say so. Thus he thinks GE should be trading around ~20.The scenario would make Tusa's career. Could it happen? Anything can happen. Would be fun to watch if real.
"GE too big and inefficient. Work force structure is innundated with middle managers. Middle managers below other middle managers. Very difficult to stay profitable in competitive markets. I do like some of their products in imaging, but if I had to sit on the phone and try to get info out of one more 2 bit middle manager. They all running around: I middle managa, I middle managa."
"I have had two buys on GE, I am a small investor who bought and it fell. When GE was low 7-8, I decided to sell at 10.71, my cost basis is 11.71 per share, my 10.05 purchase is a winner, my 13.37 is not, should I take the money an run at a loss or continue to hold? I am 62, and have other stocks that are profitable to cover the loss! Rob"
It seems money is rotating out of techs into industrials. GE will benefit from this trend.
I always listen to Jim Cramer’s recommendations and do the opposite . It’s working 8/10 times .
Sell take your profits and teach this jerk a lesson buy back in at the bottom I'm out peace 
"Which one of these engine's blew up - General Electric GE90, Pratt & Whitney PW4000, or Rolls-Royce Trent 800 engines."

What's funnier than jj day trading off of monthly charts? LOL
I have been reading that AER management specifically the CEO is very good and skilled at making deals. The same is true of Culp. I’m interested in seeing the final product. I’m betting it’s good deal for both companies
"Resistance 11.48 level, 12.07 then 13.24, 15.02 then 18.57 Waiting on GE to continue Parade of Great News to push stock higher."
"Sometimes while I enjoy my glass of wine, I am wondering - do shorts teach their children to look for negatives and only negatives in everything? I wish Culp the healthiest brain a human can ever have to burn shorts to oblivion. Especially that weasel Tusa and JPM. The small timers on this board is ignoramus."
They might want to take some loans that's why they are doing the reverse split. It wouldn't be attractive to dilute the stock if the outstanding shares are enormous.

I was watching cnbc; 2 analyst 1 pro vs 1 con & interviewer. All 3 never mentioned the 8-1 stock split in their interview. I thought it was remarkable the subject never came up
Gulp had to know this would happen. What was he thinking? Even if they reverse the r/s the damage is done. I for one will no longer trust gulp.
I guess the scary thing about GE as market has rebounded 200 points GE has not
"Nice to see GE closing in on on 9 per share. Culp needs to deliver a strong turn around in addition to timing of asset disposal. Culp needs to smooge Tusa, because Tusa was the only analyst spot on for GEs demise. Tusa has slightly changed his tune, and Culp will need positive reviews from Tusa going forward. 2018 is behind us, GE kitchen sinking 2 years in a row, and probably have significant tax right offs for the year. Culp needs to deliver a clear message on his plans going forward, or else the stock will once again start to tank. Hopefully he learned from last years earnings report mistakes and starts delivering this year. At least get the stock price back to same level"
"What does it mean to BUNGLE something ($$$$)? I rode this to $5 once, not going to do it again."

"Now that GE Industrial is FCF positive (Q4 2020 $2.5B+ and 2021) look for GE to redeem its $5.8 billion 5% Pref Stock on Jan 21, 2021 (i.e. Wednesday) using a portion of GE Industrial's $24 billion existing cash balances This will still provide GE Industrial with $20 billion, including Q4 2020 FCF of $2.5B+. More than enough cash cushion. The redemption will improve GECC's profit by $444 million annually. Historically, 5% Pref Stock payments have been recorded on GECC's income statement within a line item called ""Other Continuing Operations"". The redemption also makes it very possible GECC breaks even / profitable in 2021, meaning GECC no longer is a negative value, but its $13.5B equity contributes to GE's enterprise value as LTC liabilities have been contained / funded over past 24 months and GECC's cash balances of $15B are sizeable and separate from GE Industrial's $20B cash balance post 5% Pref redemption. Finally, the 5% Pref Stock redemption improves GE Industrial's Debt to Ebitda ratio by 0.5 point to , much closer to the 2.5-to-1.0 target, which should be 3.0-to-1.0 this year and achieved mid-2022."

"When Elon Musk says that MBAs are over rated, you might wonder what he means. Compare these two company :1. CLF was $3 in 2020, GE was $6 in 2020. 2. CLF made deals and acquired companies, GE made deals and sold off assets3. CLF is head to $20 with no reverse split, GE was heading to $20 but wants to reach $100 by reverse split4. CLF CEO earned a Master of Science degree in Metallurgical Engineering5. GE CEO earned an MBA from Harvard Business SchoolThe reverse split seems like what an MBA will do to boost ego, and be like Honeywell. I have said it before, MBAs should not run engineering companies."
Dow might rally huge tomorrow so will GE .

Regretted it immediately and bought back it at 12.52. Would like to have friends here who are willing to exchange information, experience and teach me.

"If the 8 for 1 reverse is bad, how about full-year earnings per share lowered to $0.15 – $0.20 compared to its previous guidance of $0.15 – $0.25. Something smells rotten at GE, and imagine Culprit made 73 million in compensation last year. GE still the good old boys network. Executives lining their pockets on the backs of GE shareholders."
Tomorrow’s information should be interesting. I am hoping for more positive news!!
All airlines up on earnings so of course GE does opposite
JPM has to capitulate for GE to move up significantly...
When is the reverse split?
"Initially I was disappointed with RS, after some thought I have decided it will be a positive moving forward. A reverse split with improving fundamentals translates to increasing demand for less supply. Tell my why I am wrong."

Last time to sell and save yourself before the major collapse
Many here post with good information and JJ posts what he dreams about with zero information. Just an observation from a happy GE holder that has more then a double going.

"WILMERDING, Pa. and BOSTON, (Jan. 14, 2019) – Wabtec Corporation (NYSE: WAB) and General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) announced today that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has closed its review of the pending merger of Wabtec and GE Transportation, a business unit of GE. The merger is expected to create a stronger, more diversified transportation and logistics company.Raymond T. Betler, president and CEO of Wabtec, said: “The DOJ’s decision to close its review of the pending merger marks a significant milestone for our customers, employees, and shareholders. By bringing together GE Transportation, a global digital industrial leader and supplier to the rail, mining, marine, stationary power and drilling industries, with Wabtec’s broad range of freight, transit and electronics solutions, we will have the capability and expertise to invent smarter ways to move and improve the world.”The transaction, which will position Wabtec as a Fortune 500 company with operations in more than 50 countries, is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2019, subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions. Once the transaction is completed, the combined company is expected to have significantly expanded margins, a highly attractive profile based on an improved business mix, expanded global reach, and faster innovation in key growth areas."

Perfect combination!!!"

"Sorry everyone but I want to see GE drop, even if it's for just a few hours. I had a bunch of shares in the $9's and a personal price target of $13. My wife talked me into selling everything at $13.20. Now I have sellers remorse. I'd like to see low $13s just one more time so I can rebuy my shares. Oh, after convincing me into selling at $13.20; my wife turns around and buys shares at $13.35."
"GE, thank you for the alpha"
Btw. close to 12 billion attributable losses in GE‘s equity position. So it will take a time to pay taxes. Equity as such looks ok...

Do you think the GE going to 4 bucks nutjob has moved on??

In order for stocks to break new barriers they have to hit support a down trend was triggered the other day. It has been rising for 5 straight months pullback should be here by the end of the week. Jp from the fed going to speak on Wednesday you know what that means.

Light sweet crude $64. Inflation is good for stocks? I don't think so.
"GE does not need the RS specially 1 to 8 is a large size. This will take stock price to $111 which would be less attractive to an average investor..no one would want GE to be so expensive, $40 to $50 might be ok and not by RS but by gaining investor confidence and planning as CULP has been doing so far..The board need wake up and see facts.I am pretty sure after more research and thinking they will vote against it in MAY specially if stock keeps gaining value. It was not smart to talk about it today at all, since it is not even decided to do so...... RS will harm GE as well as the investors.......we say NEY to RS......"

"I worked at GE for 20 years and left back in 1998 just before Jack Welch left. Welch was brutal and he did turn GE into a profit machine that kept delivering for years despite the toll on it's workforce. When Immelt took over, he ran the company into the ground especially with GE Capital. The new CEO is competent and has a track record of being a winner. I see GE slowly rising back with Culp. The products are still great and he is addressed the debt. GE stock should do well."

I'M up 28% you guys talked me in to staying longer was going to sell @ 14 now will hold for a while longer. when will dividend be paid.??
I see where there are going to. My guess is a secondary offering after the RS. Then a reinstatement of higher dividends. I get it. But the problem is that average people cannot buy at $104. They are doing this for their rich investors where money really is not an issue.
Can GE get back to $30 like in 2017? EPS then were 0.48.
THE BOARD IS PROPOSING TO REVERSE SPLIT . why dont you tell those board to stop it right now. and make a news right away until people sell and sue them
SEC needs to look at this one. Culp explained nothing gave very flimsy explanations leading to stock dive during 4th qtr financials. have said for a long time that this is a manipulated stock probably from within GE follow last 3 minutes of each trading day since 12 January. unable to hold or sustain any momentum even after good relative cash flow position. look for bottom to fall out tomorrow after analysts look hard at this one and begin to question where the stock trades are coming from. it is not the option side or shorts very small percentages. these are good questions for Culp whom you all love. has faked you all out.
"Day traded this for several months with 10-20,000 shares at a time when it was stuck between $6-7 a share. Made a lot of money but obviously in hindsight was upset I didn't hold long after $7. After we established a clear upward trend I went long at $9 with a few thousand shares but just sold everything before market open today. This stock does not react well to bad news and I expect it to slide for several months. It's certainly feels like management is purposely trying to destroy this stock."
"GE to $13 before earning is very likely with good momentum.. more upgrades and higher targets, the good news is just starting !!"
"Today's GE chart looks like I am skiing downhill. Rally not holding up. 10s here we come, 9s possible."

"Lots of bullpucky going on with the ""EXPERTS""Motley Fools Lee Samaha took a spin on GE using a terrible comparisonWho cares about comparing market cap plus debt (EV formulas) to get a comparison figure looking at competitors in the four areas GE is excelling on. All of the competitors do NOT CLOSELY have comparable size or scale.... Kind of like turning a power boat around compared to turning the Queen Mary. Completely different things! And counting the tires on the car and adding them us is about as foolish as adding capitalization to debt to get a EV figure. Who cares????The facts are:GE is a work in progress. Added to that change in the General Electric fundamental direction we have just passed through the eye of the needle as 12 months on corona lock down should pulverize most businesses.It did not pulverize General Electric. How much strength they show....But here is the real comparison....Use free Cash Flow. Everyone seems to thing dollars in pockets matters and planning, investment, research, and future are drags on the basic company. Do not believe that FCF is the real test - but lets look at FCF....Aviation will return to the 2019 FCFof $6.8 billion and not too long from now.Healthcare will maintain their 2020 FCF of $3 billion.Renewables is the question mark. If you take a potential 5% profit on $15 billion sales you get $750 million.That number could be larger if they reach 8% profit like Vestas has on perhaps a $20 billion sales this year which is possible with GE sales pouring in. That number of 8% x $20 billion would then be FCF $1.6 billion. Renewables are the real wildcard.Power is the next wild card. GE has a lot of customers all over the world not abandoning their existing power grid. GE in 2017 had FCF of 1.95 billion. A loss in 2018 and a modest FCF $386 million in 2019 were not good things. Last year after selling off coal, power division was only able to squeeze out FCF of $274 million. Lets see if Culp with his newer energy efficient products can push GE Power to new heights.So the second huge question mark on where power will land in 2021. Because I have total faith - I place my money on a really solid GE turnaround. GE has larger sales in all segments. GE has deeper pockets. GE has more talent. GE is better situated worldwide to reach key buyers in all segments. GE is in a rebuilding phase coming out of the pandemic.What that all translates to is a 2021 FCF that may reach $1 a share or a $20 a share stock price. That is calculated at 20 times earning. For the more speculative crowd, that number could reasonably reach 25 times earnings or $25 a share.Watch out!!2022 will be a bombshell. It isn't too far off for serious investors. GE could easily return to FCF over $13 billion and $1.50 a share. That would make the $30 price very believeable. And the stock price can possibly much higher. I wonder how 2023 will look? beyond awesome?GE is headed right and all the experts with all their figures cannot tell you more.Using oddball formulas like EV (market cap plus debt) is a real distraction from real actual and potential numbers. Either you believe in GE and the chances made to get them to reach new levels - or you are speculating the best is now and the future is much slower.I prefer the glass half full - not half empty."
I think it is how it always work. you know people pass information. These guys are having cocktails right now scheming. IT'S just to easy. Reminds me of The Wolf of Wall Street
Sorry for those who shorted in the single digits...but you can stop the bleeding...just cover it and move forward.
"GREAT NEWS, now straight to $20 then1x8 stock exchange and$160 ,then CULP starts buying profitable l=companies with all the cash buying every share possible this week"

Don't Worry.. Be Happy!
Is there a way to look up how much of a short position JP Morgan is holding? Or any individual or organization?
GE is the third most traded stock on Robinhood.Apple is the top and Tesla is second. So with GE in third place a lot of the activity in GE is from Robinhood investors.That ccount for some of the froth u nd down in the stock.There is little on the Reddit Board on GE so it is a pure investment ply on the part of the public.
I just took a put. I am sure it will go green tomorrow.
"Don't think anybody can understand this reverse split,it just makes no sense to take out so many future share holders with $110.000 plus per share price ?GE was a blue collar stock, not sure what they are trying to do now by cutting so many blue collar workers out from buying it."
This is a sad American story.

"Loved GE from $6 to $11 , now sitting back and enjoying it became fruitful."
"The RobinHooders n Wall Street Bets are not just looking at high shorted stocks...There looks like there also needs to be a turn around story thats getting laughed at by investors, i.e. GME, AMC, NOK, etc...this is in the same stage...Tusa were coming for u! U have screwed GE shareholders for years...just my opinion...do your own DD!!!"
reverse splits are like lipstick on a pig the only thing that's going to make this stock go up is cleaning up the balance sheet

The federal government is betting $20.3 million that General Electric Co. can turn an MRI machine used in hospitals into a renewable energy powerhouse.The Department of Energy's Wind Technologies Office recently awarded the grant to a team of engineers and scientists at GE Research in Niskayuna in hopes that they can take superconducting magnet technology from MRI machines and use it in the generators that create electricity in large industrial wind turbines that GE makes.
"Options settlement day .. Huge volatility, Huge Huge opportunity to buy on this dip.... Load up !!!GE to $16 after earning next week !"
"I cleaned house shorting GME, and AMC. Only small positions, but made close to 9K. I still have short positions in GE of 10.50 and 9.75. I hit and closed a 10.75 position last week. I will probably cover my 9.75 position and lose about 5K, but will still hold on to my 10.50 position. I am not ready to go long on GE till about 3Q"
Why do so many disagree with the reverse split? Serious question.
What or who is this Tusa?
here we go
Write a complaint letter to GE investor relations (just google the email address) asking to throw away the reverse split. Not even propose it for vote. DONE. Back to $20 by June.
A reverse split never works out well. There was no need for a reverse split. I would say if the stock was under $2 then he might consider it.
I wish this had happened today. Let’s hope mondays volume supports and increase this
"Blocked from posting the press release, but it says the reverse stock split will be proxy voted on at the Annual Meeting on May 4th, and may take place anytime in the one year following that."
"any chance we will still hit $13 many of you predicted? How about getting back to $12? One day, maybe, message boards will realize that pumping doesn't actually work."
"Tusa will upgrade today, but below market to save face."
need a stock buy back to get this up
"So true: GE union boss outraged. Mr Culp’s $47m bonus “is absolutely outrageous”, said Carl Kennebrew, who heads a union representing GE workers under the AFL-CIO, the largest US union federation.“How can GE justify this type of enormous bonus for its CEO, while workers, their families, and communities are suffering?” Mr Kennebrew said in a statement to the Financial Times. Culp made over 29 million in 2019. SAME GOOD OLD BOYS CLUB AT GE. The executive's get huge salaries and bonuses, the workers get screwed, and shareholders are left holding the bag. Share price is lower than when Culp took over, and he gets a 47 million dollar bonus. PRICELESS"

Waiting to see what Larry has to say on Bloomberg at noon.
"People , two days ago GE was a great company ! What could possibly change to the opposite , revers split is just meaningless . RS event is just being used to steal your shares ,lol."
how is he ever been destroyed .... currently it's doing great.... renewable ever heard of it..... Boeing went up $18 yesterday did the shorts destroy that too...
Hold on tight!!! Higher prices coming. The last weak hands are finally gone for good. Great time ahead. You don’t weak hands around.
"When you are long, they assume you know nothingShorts and bashers are like a tattoo kissI knew they'll haunt all of my what-ifsThe smell of smoke would hang around this longBut I knew Larry Playing under-promise-over-deliver andGiving me reason, Once in 20 lifetimes, IAnd when I felt like I was an old investorI reminded myself I knew everything when I was young..."
"Does not make any sense to buy shares now. news of an impending reverse split will put pressure on the shares for the foreseeable future. Longs just hang on for a not so fun ride for next 6-10 months. As a GE shareholder, i'm used to getting hamstrung by the GE board. ""Meet the new boss; same as the old boss."" The WHO. We did get fooled again!!!!!!"
"If you think $14.00 is high, you can never get in again when it pops to above $15 tomorrow."
DOWN DOWN DOWN GE GE REVERSE SPLIT HORRORRRRRR LOL
As expected. The Culprit continues to dismantle GE.
Does anyone like a reverse split? It seems as though the market doesn't- down 5%.
All the above plus any good news we will see $20
When is the reverse split supposed to happen?
With shorter U.S. life expectancy due to COVID. Won't the projected cost model for the memory care insurance policies that G.E. sold decline significantly? Isn't there a lag in how these lower costs make it into earnings in US GAAP accounting ....like the time lag it took for increased costs to make it into GE's accounting?
THIS is just following SPY
jj the days are gone when ge noise dive and never recover there is new sharif in town
Reverse stock split and the PPS is over $12? What a way to screw investors! Most only do this when a company is in trouble.
"Investors beware, The Yahoo message police are deleting negative posts for some reason, very sketchy."
"jj once you post Ge stock is short dream , where are you now please tell us how you doing as usual you just disappeared we know as soon you will get your stimulus cheque you will show up again"
Happy to see ge growing its a safe bet at this price.
.14 from the 52 week high.I would love to see it break that today and continue up this week
Didn't have many and now I have NONE. R/S rarely work out for the little guy so Thanks for profit and good luck to anyone holding on.Make sure you have some kleenex handy....
Another dreadful year of stock performance. Last 12 months SP down over 10% as market it’s ALL TIME HIGH. Just amazing and the management and directors continue to draw incredible salaries.
Buckled in and ready for tomorrow morning !
"Conventional stocks like GE are over , there is a new revolution wether you like it or no , BBBY RKT BB GME EXPR KODK . “do no waist your time”"
I just want to break even after 1 year of misery... should have sold this garbage weeks ago
"buy, buy"
"System wide, coordinated attack with , nearly, the entire market being dumped around 10:22 am. Yet the SEC blames ""market manipulation"" on GME.. People, yes everyone, needs to start charting and reporting to FINRA.$MGNI $FSR $VLDR $GE"
"What's the bull case for GE? I was in before because the P/E was so low, and I was positive about GE's connection to wind turbines. I got out when the price came up to a satisfactory level. I somewhat regret getting out, but I'm hesitant about buying back in. I love the enthusiasm that I see here, but P/E is now 24.5. There's still some room, but other profitable companies I'm in are getting killed right now for having higher multiples. If anyone has an argument for a higher price, I'd love to hear it. I like that people are happy about the new CEO."

"""Engines are fascinating, but the biggest issue for the commercial aerospace industry isn't about the next hot jet or futuristic engine technology. The issue is when will commercial air travel look like it did in a pre-pandemic world. U.S. air traffic is still down roughly 60% compared with pre-Covid levels. The air travel recovery is, and will remain, the biggest issue for the industry and aerospace investors in 2021 and beyond.""Still down 60%.!!"
"I have had this stock for a long time. It never use to disappoint me, it was always in the red. I was really hoping for a change. I decided to sell today at a small loss. I first bought it at 19, 14, 12, and then 6. I finally thought things were turning around, but with the businesses selling off I cannot understand how this company can be anymore profitable, but I kept hope. I am done. I kept a 100 shares in case I am wrong. at a cost basis of 7.78 dollars. I cannot fathom where their cash flow is coming from, and I damn sure do not understand what this reverse split is about, even them thinking it is a good idea. I rarely ever sell my stocks, but I am not going down the RO again. With the other 100 shares I am willing to go down with the ship."
"After the close, downgrades will come, and bad news will be released."
"Culp is making a smart move with 8:1 and it still needs to be approved by stockholders. Even if GE gets to 20 then 8:1 would be $160 a share, well below what Danaher and Honeywell trade at $218 and $214 at today's stock prices. RS makes sense and doesn't do anything to shareholder value it's just dividing the pie into bigger slices."
Who is selling???
$GE needs to build it's support traders on both side of the fence can make money during this time. You're in a better position loading up for a long position during the process.
In other words there is no place for the Retail investor in GE's future!!! That's just bull!!
"Reverse split means nothing as long as the price keeps going up! If you own $100 in the stock, it's still $100. Just hope the price continues to increase vs. going lower. Believe me, Larry wants the stock to increase in value."
The split is for institutional investors. It’s actually a wise move. You’ll see.
another day another loss. will be low volume and bet goes down 2% today meaning all gains given back in 3 trading days this week on a total of 1 normal day trading. manipulated stock like none other.
I added more to my already large position. it will turn around soon.
Very bullish
One more week until earnings report...
"Repent people, 75% drop is coming"
"GE bringing to market a large-scale offshore wind turbine that can compete with Vestas and Siemens Gamesa gives me a lot of hopes in $GE. GE is a reliable American manufacturing company and the new president is willing to invest in renewable energy, especially in offshore wind. $GE is a must-have in every portfolio right now."
I wonder what GE has planned for news post earnings? Ya know it's going to be huge.
"OK, everyone take a breath...From all we see so far, unless GE makes a very compelling case for the reverse spit, shareholders will vote No. My question is...what happens when the RS is voted down??? My guess is that it will be the opposite of todays reaction...and we continue to move higher. Just my honest opinion. "
"Lots of uncertainty this morning. Wall street doesn't want to appear to frightening to all of those new investors that will be receiving a large cash infusion via stimulus. Other than big cap tech seems generally a down day. GE will hover lower, might test $12's and should close fairly flat to slightly down."
"JP M Chase 13-F 31 Dec., hold 10.3M shares long GE. Don't listen to Tusa scares retailers to sell into large institutional buyers. Today should be interesting."
"With the 1.9T trickling into the markets from every nook and cranny, and all the upside in aviation and wind power/turbine green energy generation, this GE play is absolutely a no brainier.The market cool-off from yesterdays record high, is healthy, and will serve to let investors take a breath, and then jump back in.If you like to buy low and sell high, now is the time to buy, as its not likely that this market will stop it's continuous climb for long (GE included)."
"Tusa acknowledged strong 4QFCF and is asking about capital reporting changes. Carolina answered that pushing the accountability back to biz is to be more clear and reflect in external reporting for transparency. Tusa - growing assets in GE Capital? No, keeping flat. Relatively benign line of questioning."
Per Barron’s: The CPPIB nearly quintupled its investment in GE stock by buying 6 million more shares of the conglomerate to end the fourth quarter with 7.6 million shares.
Financial rating set to be downgraded after this deal to a couple of notches above junk. So who cares ?
"I think we are on track to see a DROP, down to the $9.70 - $9.15 range. GLTA"
I love this action but it seems like a little too much too fast. That's the way this Mkt works I guess.
No volume again! 
Buying opportunity
I only have 3 holdings now. 2 of the 3 are reverse splits. Lmao! The other one is RAD up on both.
Sunny Skies ahead for GE shareholders.
pre-market pretty bullish hahahaaa!!! where are all the GE investors dump now...
"Let's just calm down, wait a few days and hear what the analysts have to say. Maybe we'll be surprised and there will be upgrades and higher target prices."
O M God look at GE go ......go GE go
"I encourage all shareholders to contact GE investor relations, check the GE website, to express your displeasure with Larry Culp's proposed reverse stock split accounting gimmick."
Think RAD
"Toosa LOW iQ admitted, GE IS TOO COMPLICATED FOR HIM.. Well, get a job at MCDONALDS, Flipping burger all day, repeatedly it everyday for 365 days.. Is that simple enough for you Toosa Girl or She-M@le ?? Mr. Buffet's sprawled conglomerate is not too complex, JPM's complex balance-sheet with all kinds of bad toxic loans, liabilities, investment toxic packages, toxic sh#@#TY derivatives are not too complex.. ?? JPM is balance-sheet is 100 times more complex, it's just Wllst politics, current negative targeting against GE. Therefore, throwing the kitchen sink at GE, over and over again, multiple times is justified, even if this narrative is all 90% false, lies, twisted facts, manipulative narrative"
I'd be getting involved in these stocks now... we all know clean energy is a big focus in the next 10 years.... GE wants be a dominant company in the industry.. don't miss out
"Guys this a majot sell off, and GE is participating but in good company and it will overcome. Buy back up the truck soon for a great one week ralley next week."
Maybe tusa and BOD are on the same page
"Kramer said to buy it tonight on Mad Money, if you believe in Kramer."
I Guess The Board Isn't Aware That A Company That Does A Reverse Split Is Forever Considered TRASH?
"So, to switch gears here. Folks, like Scott (and Steve I think), who seem to have some knowledge on actual investing, I've been wanting more but I'm a bottom fisher bigtime. Where do you think this goes before turning back up. $10?"
"Sure Sure......... ""everything"" stays the same right after the R/S........... until it doesn't.Get out of this if you can........ I don't see GE at $150.00 anytime this decade."
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GE/holders?p=GEGE at this price is a defensive play . Look at the number of institutional holders that invested in this company . A great play for the new technology for renewable energy.
"The message John Flannery failed to deliver last week. GE ended Q3 with significant Aviation above Q3 plan. GE along with our joint venture partner will meet our 2018 commitment by December. The Fed interest rate increase so far in 2018 reduces the GE pension risk by $6,600,000,000. If the planned rate increase in December is implemented that will reduce the pension risk by another $2,200,000,000 or $8,800,000,000 total for 2018. The Turbine blade issue disclosed last week has a fix and corrective action has started. (Note: all of this statement has been previously disclosed but not consolidated or spoken from the lips of Flannery)"
Vote against the reverse split and fire the entire BOD as soon as possible!
"I sold out today. I expect the price to drop a bit. However, I do not think they need to go this route and in the end, they may not. I will be watching closely. I am a small fish though. There are people with millions of shares. That is why WSB is actually a good thing. It is also why the hedgefunds and brokers colluded to bring down those stocks. Rigged game for the rich."
Reverse splits never end well
U SEE THE VOLUMN BIG VOLUMN THOSE ARE NOT MAJORITY SMALL RETAIL INVESTORS THOSE ARE THE BIG MUTUAL FUNDS I THINK DUMPING HEHEHE
Question for Manfred...do you think GE is rangebound until after the reverse split?
Don’t be cry all the short-seller...
"Ouch. GE's Culp scored $73M in 2020 compensation, mostly tied to stock payouts"
I have a strong bullish feeling about GE.
"General Electric Co expects a cash outflow in the first quarter of 2021, Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp said at a Barclays Industrial Conference on Tuesday.....Bet its down 20% tomorrow."
"If 500 million shares sold in last 2 days by losers (retail) , then500 million shares were bought by clever buyers (institutions).Just watching this board react over the past 48 hours clearly shows these posters have n clueabout the terrific benefits of the GECA - AERCAP deal or the reverse stock split.And Steve Tusa is the head Indian who is totally blind. There is nothing he said that is right. Any new GE Capital Liabilities on the GE balance sheet are exactly offset by an equal asset and this was confirmed by Ed Gardner on the GE Board.The real cap rate of $115 billion is offset by a total loan net of only $5 billion and will be whittled down to around $15 billion in the next year or so.A lot of idiots buying stock and all will rush back to re-buy as they see their on the wrong side of the deal."
"last years market pullbacks started just about now, but were short-lived nervous market or ready for another pullback"
"My man Tusa is coming through remaining with his 5.00 price target, 40.00 after reverse split. Keep on holding BAGGIES, a 50 plus percent drop is coming. Nice short once again, while you BAGGIES are again left holding the bag. Screw me once, shame on you. Screw me twice, shame on me. BAGGIES must love getting screwed multiple times from this corrupt company."
"No way that GE doesn't come out with press release TODAY, to reverse their decision to do a 1 for 8 reverse split!!"
J And J vaccine is 100% effective of preventive death. very effective to the strains. That is the catalyst the market will ralkey Monday. Gooooo GE.
Is GE heading higher?
good news
GE continues with short and long term growth.
Not sure what the problem with the reverse split is. No effect on the company. Sure it's a bad signal if the motive is to hide a continuing deterioration in price. But that's not the case here. Seems this is just another example of solving bad financial engineering decisions of the past and brings the shares outstanding to a sensible level.
was just thinking earlier that ge had beaten ford to 10 and now this reverse 1-8 bull.... ford will charge ahead just like the turtle 
"Come on Mr. Tusa, even Mr. Inch has raised his price target to $11 now. You really think $5 is right with the strong aviation recovery coming over the next year? Makes no sense."
Ok what will US do if covid-19 spirals higher? what will happen to GE if US cuts off international flights? We can not get vacine in people's arms quick enough. Maybe the US beer industry could get it in people's arms. Stores are never out of Bud!!!
"Take a look BAGGIES, heading to the 12s"
$17 VERY soon and then $2. GE is ONNNNNN
"Hello, devils. Honest question, what's your take? I sold out due to everyone's horrid fear of RS. I was in for very long haul (entry sub-$6!). Anyway, time to move on. Want back in. Buy on dip? Ya think it is indeed going to dive after RS? This RS has be totally clueless on how to play this. Want very long term but don't wanna buy at, say, $10, if that turns into $80 and then it dives to $40. What ya'll think? Any serious biters wanna share?"
Somebody expecting this stock to shoot up quickly
"The rally started folks we are moving. Monday it will continue. Go GE.hopefully I wil see GE today at 11.10 Yes my opino base on were the stock was few hours ago, not like it was there 6 month ago."
"Awww, what happened? Did u think GE would go down some more?"
What would market reaction be if $GE was to pull back its proposal for RS
"Higher high and lower lows....patience folks. I agree with many that Aviation is the driving factor behind GE and it will not be until Q3/Q4 that we see this driven up with the return of flights, and that will only happen with the global vaccination. The USA, Israel, UAE, and others are leading the way. Daily ups and downs like this will happen, but once the movement starts to take hold, it will look like the 2000 stock market and i pity those that will get caught short at that point...they will surely lose everything. I have also invested in ""Green"" hydrogen (HYSR) - thinking this will also take off - a green planet is surely needed. would by nice to see GE get involved in this - renewables is their area of expertise as well.GLTA!!"
"This article says GE regularly installs wind turbines with cold weather packages installed. I don’t know if that means it’s priced in to a basic installation, or optional equipment. This article summarizes Texas as more of a carbon issue... frozen pipes, but the fakestream is simply trying to redirect criticism on the dynamics of Arctic Air blasting the middle of a continent. This will happen more regularly as the magnetic pole is flipping, and the suns output increases.https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottcarpenter/2021/02/16/why-wind-turbines-in-cold-climates-dont-freeze-de-icing-and-carbon-fiber/?sh=4cf5dd5f1f59"
trending about 4% while Nasdaq is -2%. Very strong trend upward in my opinion. GE will be a strong factor in rebuilding the US infrastructure starting with Texas. It is a great gem.
dont be silly. there's no squeeze here. take a look at the share structure.
hahhahahahaa buy buy buy and hold forever should get rewards
"Oh no rates are still down 92 percent over the last 20 years. No one wants treasuries, until they hit 2 percent yield, then Japan will buy, China, and grandma."
The US market indexes are too high. The market may have a big correction any time soon. GE is a long term play. Hold tight GE stock. Don’t be shaken out and prepare to buy more during the market correction.
Really hope they turn earnings around. The monthly chart is looking better and better.
AMC was only up +301% today..
Hard to believe that management thinks after the reverse split that anyone in their right mind would buy GE at $ 100.Another screwing for individual shareholders from GE.How come they never came up with this when the stock was $5 ?
With over 8.7 billion shares out there that is enough to give EVERY PERSON ON EARTH 1 share and still have 1 billion shares left over!
"Long account getting slapped around. Almost time to refresh some of those holdings. NO, GE is not involved as poser stocks aren't allowed."
"Reverse Split is bad bad bad! Nothing good will come of it. The best for a company to take shares off the table is to buy them back. Granted GE is not in position to do this today. With things moving in the right direction I could see it happing in the years to come. Reverse Split is the kiss of death! Also, forget about a dividend. That will never come back! The only people that win on this is the Board and upper management! Everyone else will take it up the pie hole!"
At today's rate we should be back to $13's on Monday....Wish all GE Investors a Great Weekend...See Y'all on Monday!
$14 end of day
"when it hits 5 a share will look at it, maybe !"
General Electric stock price target raised to $13 from $12 at OppenheimerMany more upgrades coming. Great BUYING opportunity!!Outstanding CEO doing a great job and moving the company very quickly in the right direction.!
Now down 17% from its recent high.
"So, GE grew 100% since September. Then it gave back 20% (on a supposed, potential, hypothetical RS). Now back on track for its next leg up...In detail:First established a floor at $6.75.Then established a floor at $11 Next established floor will be $18 in May.Simple math. Trust GuillermoStay greedy my friends"
Analyst rating of 13$ not bad!
"GE is not going anywhere soon. If you are a day trader, you can play buy yesterday and sell today game. If you are long, you can either stay long or sell now, go make money somewhere else, come back one year later, you will still but it cheap. The range trading is set until the vote happens in may. Just like all reverse splits, it will trend down until the split happens."
Ladies and gentlemen...FOMO has left the building......
Looks like a 200M volume day deep in the red. Know what that means?
Tusa is the best. Markopolos is the best. GE has a Culprit at the helm. And Energy will be gone soon. To $4
I’m diamond handing GE
ge needs to go back 30/share
I wonder if this goes back to 11.45 level. Too bad I thought GE was a good buy. I don't see any reason to pick it up now. RS has to kick in and settle before any real interest in holding GE.
Who bought 11.16 million shares at the close?
cscrew this I SOLD will take my 10% to the bank know i'll be sorry but getting into travel stock
Should $ABB and $GE merge ?
"I hear ""The Jefferson's"" show theme song playing, starting now...""Movin' on up!""GE is a great company. The thrashing is overdone and it's time for reason to take hold. The price should start to rise, soon. The current price is nuts when taking into account the progress the company has made, the return of air travel and airplane sales, the great deal on the financing company, etc. ""Movin' on up!""...Go, GE!Good luck, longs."
Does this open over $13 on Monday?
"Only strong GE investors will be left and we will prevail in the long run. What a great, strategic, and foresighted move. I like it and so should you. Most people won’t understand. Do some research and let it marinate. This is another solid play by Culp. Been here for 8 years and holding.... maybe buying more."
Nobody made a dime by panicking.GE reduced debt and is accelerating their turn around.￼
Just when you think things are finally working... along comes a RS.
Does anyone know if GE got pension liability extended in the stimulus pkg?
"Why do people consistently think a reverse split is such a bad idea? Please enlighten me. Do you know how many companies prosper from them? It’s not a bad thing. Just like a regular split is not always a good thing. You don’t like it, sell and move on."
"1 for 8 reverse splits never end well for the retail investor. This stock wants to drop below 12.00 so bad, only a temporary move up on ""Sentiment"". Will open down and drop below $13.00 tomorrow, be carful and invest wisely."
I believe we will see a double from here this year! $25 or higher by 4Q.
Slow and steady wins the race pace yourself with a good solid stock￼
How many more times can it test the same price point without a breakout!? Everyone push!
"Yahoo/Google cut my post also, no bad language or anything, just making a negative comment about the RS.Yahoo/Google, is part of the WOKE / CANCEL CULTURE crowd.A disgrace, this country has a lot of missable, sorry people that think they know it all and want to tell you how to live and control your life.I praise the people who fought to protect that right."
GE Power! Push it to $12.
Took my profit at the peak. Will get back in after this goes back to $9.00
"This is exactly why I am a longer term investor. Yesterday Wall Street was gushing about GE. Today they are moaning.My question is not these two days....but what might be two years hence and, perhaps, beyond."
To all my longs... mute those shorts... we'll be eating good this year 
"over 12.00 plus, good price to get in at.....................loading up, good price for volume buying"
going super critical -melting-up into earnings
"While I don't agree with what happened last night, it was expected. The left has been given free reign to protest, riot, loot, assault, and do whatever they want, while being supported by the media. Every time the right tried to protest, always started peaceful until antifa stepped in, they were labeled as far right wing. The Liberal run media is trying to squash or silence the right and have been for years, I expected nothing less from the right, they were fed up with being silenced."
"it won't take any longer in theory shares shrink, share price increases, eps should also increase! if you have held for 22 yrs give it some time and you will be rewarded, culp is actually doing the right thing. ge in the past has made some stupid decisions and that are now being delt with, i added shares at yesterdays open in fact doubling my position in ge another 12 to 18 months will be in tall cotton"
"I think someone is trying to take a position. They let the price fall then buy the dip, example big run up at the close yesterday. The way the chart looks now, it seems poised to pop back up to 12.00 and change. I still think LC drops a monster news announcement to get the stock to rally higher!!!"
"Come on GE need my 11.50 call in the money by Friday, preferably 12 bucks or more.:)"
Dont forget the large portion of healthcare GE has going for them. With the change in office this stock will continue to go up.
"Share structure of GE is almost identical to share structure of NOK. Difference is, that GE can hardly loose with renewables and healthcare not to forget aviation, once the virus is controlled."
Someone must have turned off the price regulator switch.
The most important item of the stimulus package! Your $1400.00 check can be garnished.
New buy 7000 share at $11.97
GE and BA will be flying to the moon next week.
"What price will GE trade next week? If the market indexes don’t have a correction, GE will close above $13.5 to $14 next Friday. when GE tests $14 few times and breakout $14, GE will become very bullish. The traders will jump in to play. When that happens, the real game will start; the stock price will move higher very fast due to momentum. $16*8 is reachable by this summer and $20*8 by the year end. Why? Because the pandemic will go away and the aviation will come back. Thus, GE is the stock which will enjoy the recovery. Time will tell."
all you haters that talk bad about GE one day you wish you owned it so keep talking bad about it that's a good luck charm
"I am a GE bull, but I am only cautiously optimistic over the next few months due to market conditions. However, just before they erase the kitchen sink quarter from Q2 2020, around 2nd week of July, I will likely “back up the truck” and load it with GE."
Wow !
this message board is nothing but bs. A boat load of clowns talk as if they have insider information. nothing but jibber jabber!
I shorted 14.30 this morning before the bell. !!! The gift of GE keeps on giving. Thanks King Larry
Next run (provided market doesn't tank) should hopefully put this over $12.
"Solid numbers all around, with vaccinations rolled out globally, flights will resume and this can only be good, going forward."
"yes I'm sure ge to 0 is a real person (sarcastic btw). It's been mooning for months it's not just going to stop because of a tiny correction (or manipulation, take your pick)"
Shareholder you have the option NOT to approve the reverse split. DO NOT VOTE in favor of it.I will vote NOT to do the reverse split.
High pps doesnt limit day trading......TSLA...hello? A blindrobin is a salted fishDont be a blind robin or....thank you for the cheap cheap shares.
I think it’s safe to say the reverse split will not pass.
RS announced? major bargains here at $7 pre split.
14 for sure today; 15 probably by tomorrow
"The market correction is here. Today GE traded with high volume. It first went up because of the upgrade and quickly dropped to $13.2x in the early of the morning because of the market correction. Then, it recovered after bulls and bears fight. It is not bad that GE close at $13.57 at the close even the indexes dropped badly.Technically, the market indexes are in very bad shape. GE might drift down as the market indexes go lower in near future. Hopefully, GE can stay above $13. If bears push it under $12.5, I will thank the bears to give me another opportunity to add my position. Keep in mind that GE will be the best stock to own next few years."
"Investing is being threatened by investing games that young people are playing these days. Young people day don't want to put there money in a stock and walk away, they want to turn $50 into $1000 in a few hours or a day. The generation of impatience is taking over the market and we are in for a lot of massive swings on whatever stocks they decide to play games with. The whole platform is changing."
Don't worry. Back to 14 by Friday.
How do you like that potential RS now? Just a way for the guys to steal your shares
the dreaded reverse split
is reverse spilt means 100 share become 800 or the 100 become 12.5
The news is getting more bullish. I think this year is our year boys and girls. Don’t have a lot down on it. Once I get other plays open. Dump some more money on this.
jump jump.
We really need some positive press releases to bolster this stock back up
The stock will jump further when President will announce renewable energy program. It will further jump once 100 million American citizens will be vaccinated. More a question when then if....doubling is in the cards this year.
"GE's Earnings Release is next Tuesday, January 26 th.Let start the run up!"
"GE is a lot cheaper near the end of the day...It has been a pattern for awhile now, starting by 20 or 30 cents gain and letting it fade away as the day gets near the closing time. Unable to hold on to its gain Even on the best days for the market...... with the current rate we might see GE around $15 by 2023"
"in spite of all. yahoo ge average inching up , now at 11.75"
Analysts raised the GE target as they had bought it a lower price before and now they want to sell it higher price. Beware.
10 DOLLAR NEXT WEEK FOR GE
"Some people are shorting Ge in habit, do not realize power of GE producing of FCFSmart up jj"
GE breaking out because I bought some puts this morning. You're welcome.
they never recovered from the 3-1 split issued years ago--just look at a chart
5 million Americans got on airplanes in the last 5 days. Air travel will return with a vengeance. GE will pop.
Reverse split: much ado about nothing.
"With all the new BA plane contracts coming and the US/UK looking for new energy infrastructure, I would be afraid to go short over any weekend as news of new contracts imminent."
A 20% correction from the recent 52 WK high will be time to buy/ add. Don't expect GE to sink below $11.
"Fraudsters on the pretense that ""investors don't understand"" !"
come on GE should ignore the market and go straight up to $12.29 i hope so. forget the market come on! if not i will wait untill next week but it will go up!
It was looking so good. Why put a reverse split out there now?Maybe this is a good time to get more.

Tax selling finally over. All my holdings are green
"What happened, does anyone know?"
It still likes $12
GE was unstoppable today
Someone on Bloomberg just said the 777 engine is GE. Why can’t we get accurate news?
"With the $43,000,000 bonus Larry made about $65,000,000 in 2020. Underestimate this guy at your own peril. If the stock gets to $17 IN THE NEXT 5 YEARS he will get the full $230,000,000 bonus."
"Think about it. There are so many bloated stocks out there and everyone is nervous and wondering when to get out before most come crashing down. This is why investors are coming back to GE. They are growing, innovative, and safe. There is very little chance they'll go back down now. The safe bet is that GE will continue to go up and touch $20 soon, while all the bloated stocks, like Tesla, other EV plays, and many covid stocks will come crashing back down to earth. I'm not saying Tesla isn't a good company, although for reliability they are rated close to the bottom. Their stock isn't worth what it's at and when investors start getting nervous, they'll slowly get out and then create a snowball effect where everyone will race for the exits.Buy GE and stay safe my friends!"
"Seeing that huge buy into the close was a good sign. We all know what happened today. The most institutionally owned and strongest stocks took a beating to salvage and cover these ridiculous squeezes. GE, GM, semiconductors (heck probably every blue chip with a p/e under 40) should rally back hard this week."
"Reverse stock split, another way to destroy value !"
Hahaha
stock will close around $11 after surging over $12. tells me even with good news with cash flow stock still slides. never seems to maintain any highs or momentum. why? still a lot of big guys pulling this stock down.
"Faux sell off burning out as fast as it swept in. HFT's are to blame. Nothing more, nothing less."
Congratulations to all longtime GE longs --. It hasn't always been easy. Today was the one we've been waiting for!
My 1000 shares of GE cost $6250. My 200 shares of Roku cost $8400. Today the GE is worth about $14200 and the Roku is worth $72000. I am happy with both.
REVERSE SPLIT IS THE TERMITE OF WALL STREET :) HAHAHAA
"culp got his $42 million for just getting the stock over $10. Now, he screws the shareholders and 1000s of GE retirees who saw their futures ruined by CEOs and the board. These CEOs and Directors i.e. Immelt all walk into the sunset rich regardless of their poor decisions."
"These figures were taken straight from the 10K just filed1) receivable factoring is being reduced from 3.2 billion to to $400 million - savings will be 2.8 billion going to Free Cash Flow2) General Electric has an unused asset of $7.3 billion ownership in Baker Hughes that is available to pay down debt. There are $1.3 billion non recurring charges last year now going to the GE bottom line.3) pensions: every 1/4% (quarter point) upward inflation interest improves GE pension fund by 2.4 billion. GE is now vested at 81% in their pension fund which is above the 80% normal for industry standards. Since we see interest rates moving upward - every point would benefit GE $10 billion or about another 10% in their pension obligation. That is a real eye opener for improving value and reducing their debt.employment and plant closingsNot mentioned in this story are the fact that GE has reduced their payroll 15% last year and reduced by 50% from 334,000 employees to about 170,000 employees. That 15% represented a savings of about $12 billion payroll plus taxes. also they closed a lot of US plants moving from about 140 manufacturing facilities in the US to bout 70 plans now."
Upgrade! $16 PT Amazing Call
"Let us hope! ""General Electric's (NYSE: GE) $30 billion deal to sell its GECAS aircraft financing arm to AerCap Holdings (NYSE: AER) is a key milestone in the industrial conglomerate's effort to get its balance sheet under control, the company's chief financial officer said on Wednesday, giving GE ""multiple paths"" to bring down its debt. Speaking at a Bank of America conference, GE chief financial officer Carolina Dybeck Happe said the company expects to have gross debt of about $70 billion once the GECAS deal closes, down from $104 billion at year's end."""
General Electric Earnings: Revenue: $21.9B (est $21.83B)Power Revenue: $5.38B (est $5.34B)Healthcare Revenue: $4.82B (est $4.77B)Aviation Revenue: $5.85B (est $5.64B)Adj EPS: $0.08 (est $0.09)
Does anyone want to apologize to GE_to_$4? lol
"If I understand everything correctly, GE will receive 30 bln USD cash from AERC and will have 49 per cent ownership of the new entity...AERC has a market cap of 8 bln right now. Quite sure that the new entity will have some debts after the deal is finished (but have also plenty of assets)...think it’s a hell of a deal. Culp is smart....At the same time GECAS had 700 m losses last year. So profit of segments will boost, if Aviation will achieve only 40 per cent of the 2019 result. It’s a shame that there was more emotions about RS than real business related matters. Anyhow, don’t know what this guy Tusa is smoking..."
This is like a kick in the face by GE. GE stock will now most likely drift lower for weeks if not months if not years. RS’s are just not well tolerated.
Smart money jumping in 
"all is well, 11.35! a good price to move higher from here. keep your eye on LMT, KO, PEP, PG AND VRSN THESE SHOUL MOVE HIGHER temporarely."
"OH ok. (I'm sorry, I know the shorts missed me all day, I had an important meeting with some major players...the opposite of the shorts on this board) but alas I am here.Soooo... I see what made this pop, a stimulus bill for RENEWABLE ENERGY in which GE is a beneficiary.Well well well. ...Like I said, I had to keep reminding myself that I bought his for 2021 because we all knew this was coming.Looks like all the stars are NOW ALIGNED for GE.Get ready longs...the future is BRIGHT!"
"We’re at a resistance level from 2018, and experiencing some manipulation. In the news, feeling, and sweepings...Will we be up or down tomorrow?If down Thursday, up Friday!If up Thursday, up Friday!I’m just watching, looking for patterns. But the pattern changes... this carnival is more unstable than normal. The new normal, crazy people are in charge, and they lie about everything outside GE. Inside GE we have a good company with good leadership..."
reverse split and even the mention of it just sucked all the momentum out of this stock... thanks a lot GE....
Congratulations to all the survivors!!
Kudos to Tusa. He got this one right.
"Remember John Najarian last week talking about GE bullish call options? To 11.50? first week in January? well, he’ll be holding next to nothing when his options expire￼. January 8th"
Attention everyone. JJ just shorted 7k at $14.40

ITS ONLY GE CLOSE THE GAP BUY BUY NOW
How dare you not be green.
Thank the Democrats for this sell off. 100% the worst platform in modern American politics. The party is nothing that it used to be. 10% correction comming if both Democrats win GA. that speaks volumes
IPV merger with AEVA just approved. If you are looking for a better play.
Amazing volume. Amazing green GE on a down day
I wounded if the GE Honeywell merger will happen. Ow that GE has sold off its air craft leasing arm
"I warned you bagholders, nothing but cost cutting, no growth. keep cutting till nothing. all smoke and mirrors"
I added more shares when price dropped. company value has not change in my view. In a month time GE will be back to where it was.
"GE is a great potential stock to be the next GME. Too many shorts and manipulators for such a fundamentally strong company. 1/3 of the world’s electricity from GE turbines, 1/2 of every plane takes off with GE Jet Engines and 1/2 of every MRI is with GE machines!!️hope they will notice this."
Just sold April. .35 calls
two quarters in good earnings should upside higher and higher.
GE GOOD!
"If you were worried about short sellers - worry no more.GE stock has moved about $2 in the past week or so and anyone of the people holding the $80 billion in short positions lost a lot of money and are now sidelined for good.Someone or someones big are now buying into General Electric.. Buffet? Ackerman? Paulson? Add all the good things happening (see below) that Goldman Sacks upgraded today to $15 the March 10th investors meeting which will definitely move the stock The 1st quarter FCF being at the least down from $2.2 billion a year ago in 1st quarter. which was disaster but got rid af skeletons in their closetAnd a projected FCF of $-.2 to $-.6 billion this 1st quarter, the purchase rush all over the world to move into wind power.GE Haliade is the dominant offshore turbine wind choice, and in wind power GE is getting better situated to make this their 2nd most important dominant industry, The pairing up with Toshiba for the Asian market and especially Japan.The recovery of aviation as the vaccines are injected worldwide The loss of Pratt and Whitney and also Rolls Royce aircraft engines as serious competitors to GE engines (GE is the major 747 engine supplier as of now) Their new found place dominating the industry with their certified new GE9x engine, and the stability of their healthcare profit center. That along with Baker Hughes stock worth more every week and GE having at least that $8 billion asset paid for the serious reduction of all their overall debtthe minimizing of their pension funding necessity that now exceeds the 80% needed (now at lest t 81%the return to inflation and every 1/2 point adds to the pension fund income $0 billion, the reduction of their exposure and borrowing at GE capital the the return to a better power generation and far more friendly equipment offering - all this and more is a rel reason to look at a $20 stock coming up.I personally can see them moving the over $10 billion free cash flow for 2022 and a $30 price coming up in the nearer and not the far future and there is little to stop it from happening.All good nes for Genersl Electric."
A lot of long time holders broke even or made a profit when they got in at $6.00.. So this is expected.. More sellers will come when the price goes up and more people break even.. Overall though looking pretty good
"Just observed a lot of options bid at $12.5,$13, $13.5,$14 this Friday, a triple witching day. The concentration bids are at $13.5 with more than 80000 call contracts. The maximum gain for the market makers to profit is the price close at $13. It will be very versatile next few days. Using this opportunity to get some more shares when it traded under $13 and sell some trading shares when it reached $13.75"
20 coming by the end of the year. 15 by next earning. Tusa's pants on fire.
You guys wanna great reverse split? Check out RAD 1.37 billion market cap with 23 billion in revenue. They shorted to Bk levels and was actually turning around before covid. Rite Aide will be $ 40.00 by the years end if not by earnings.
this is just part of the SPX basket it moves up and down with the index-- the longs think there is something special here-- it is only moving up or down with buy and sell programs from machine trades-- as the SPX goes so goes GE-- on a weekly close there is a +.96 correlation with the SPX- you are trading the SPX here nothing more
Dow over 300 today. Look out below when Dow drops tomorrow. Tomorrow looks like profit taking day.
"Have to say I never considered this. Tim Seymour from CNBC brought up yesterday that GE’s pension obligations, that have totaled $18 billion until recently, will further drop if US bond rates continue going up. He stated that a 2% 10 year rate would cut pension liabilities by almost half down to $10 billion, further stabilizing their balance sheet.This stock is starting to look like a (turnaround from poor management + turnaround from Covid + growth stock + hedge against rising rates)."
"Do you remember when NoYB said GE ain't gonna get to $8, LOL"
"All, like any stock, it moves with the market - it has its up days and down days, but what i do see is higher highs and higher lows. A lot of fundamentals behind that, not hype: stronger aviation, stronger renewables, stronger healthcare, positive FCF predicted for 2021, and on-going stable management with steady progress. All of this provides credibility, and confidence with institutional investors who are looking to provide their clients a decent return. This is not GME because it is has a real business behind it. I still believe we will be in mid to high teen's by year-end. Shorts will have their day from time to time, but they may lose it all as they risk betting when it will go down, and find out it has risen again $1.00 or more.....hold until Q4 and you will be rewarded, IMHO - GLTA!!"
$ 20 on April.
"the year of the CULP, next m&a any day, $14 any day"
GE should have 1 for 4 reverse split. Not 1 for 8 reverse split.
What GE should do is announce a 10 for 1 stock split. Bring the total outstanding shares to 88 billion. That will send this mother up to Pluto.
"Could this be the"" handle"" forming on the ""Cup"" seen on the monthly chart?"
$GE is a bargain. PE will be dropping as revenue continues to go up. Still believe it will close above 10% today and another 10% before the end of the week. Shorts are going to get sqeezed.
General Electric is down 4.91% to 12.60
Sell the news
market cap 120bill.... ge stock under 14...dirt cheap!!!
General Electric is definitely BACK!!
"GE is to back the Engineering Design Center in Poland, one of the largest centers for turbine technology development in Europe for another 15 years.The Engineering Design Center (EDC) in Warsaw houses more than 1,300 engineers, with around 600 in the Łukasiewicz – Institute of Aviation working on R&D for aviation programs, as well as Gas Power and Renewable Energy."
Who is laughing now.
This stock will beat tesla but Im currently trying to pump dodge with my group we are heavily buying this dipp Lets GO GE AND DOGE
I do not like reverse splits. Stock will tank after splitting. Getting out.
Shorts are getting desperate. JJ you need to calm down and just admit defeat your short position is done
Money is rotating from tech to industrial. That's another catalyst for GE!
RS followed by dilution...
13.50 today?
"Someone here should start an online seminar called --- Shorting for Pennies To Afford Low Grade Vodka, Quickest Way to Be a Homeless.Hey if you make money, I want a piece of it because it's my idea."
I have missed so many opportunities to make serious money during this 12 year bull market. Owning GE was another mistake.
"Now that GE stock has started to roll, it will not slow for awhile till it reaches a meaningful level of at least high TEENS..my guess is $18..... all sorts of good news from the GE itself and other national news will keep stock going higher and higher......Thanks to the hard working CEO and all LONGS.... go GE go"
I was such a big fan of Culp and what he has done the past couple of years and in a few days stock is down over $2 all because of this BS reverse split which just makes no sense! It took forever to get this stock over $14 and now this! He and the board had to know the market would hate this!
Here is a fact. Easily proved. GE is down from $60 per share over the last 20 years. Trading at $13 and in a very long term down trend. For anyone to see.
Don't Worry... Be Happy! 
"Tim Seymour giving Fast Pitch on GE...no equity dilution, covid recovery story due to airlines, Multiple less than peers, street WAY BEHIND ON VALUATION, great mgmt...his stock price is conservative $18 with lots more upside!!! Going to run into $20s!!!"
Where's Chickens and dewd? Still working for the Chicago Sanitation department?

"James Bowman has a target price of $14.50.Both the move into value stocks and the efforts ofLarry Culp, are the reasons for Mr. Bowman's new price target."
Larry is full of surprises
THANK YOU LORD SHORTED MORE AT $13.30 PER SHARE YEAH BABY
"Wow look at yesterday TSA numbers, summer looks really goodVery positive for GE Aviation"
"The Board of Directors has their answer to the reverse Split proposal. This was Culp's first major blunder, by reverse splitting it's shares 8/1 they increase the price 8 fold sounds right so far ? Well, these financial engineers with their computerized algorithm trading can now drive the price down from a 112 were it will be to 60 then once people get washed out ,the tree shaken they can drive it back up. Since these Wall street firms have access to who owns shares and how much,they can by passed so called owned in street name and have access to direct ownership of shares. Point is they will be free to Manipulate the share with less effort. And who really suffers in the end the mom and pop retail investor who invests in GE in believe the company is a good investment, not a trading vehicle. Vote No to the RS of shares. The BOD should have left the share structure alone, and grow the company into it over time, NOT give opportunity to the institutional investors who only want to manipulate the trade."
Tusa coming on CNBC in a few; guess he will likely add to the pressure on the stock as well. He will probably say he was vindicated by the RS.
Picked a great day to start a very nice position in GE. Great to be up a nice chunk on a terrible day! Go GE!!
Jiffy Jeff went on to bigger things...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFgFUudn9Vw
A) Boycott Coke since they do not like white people and literally have said as much yesterday.B) Hold GE because it is going back to $30 and probably a lot higher.
$50 by 2022. $20 by May.
Tough being a GE hater when you get your head handed to you every day. But these folks spend their lives in their mothers basements being wrong so oh well.
"They are bending the shareholders over, just like they did to the pension folks."
"I'm with you on this unethical company. They do not call them ""Wolves of Wall Street"" for nothing!"
"I am thinking easy $12 this week with one more upgrade .... and I am still expecting BIG NEWS any day !!!Good longs .... One trading tip, Buy and roll March $12 calls in 2 weeks to June $15 calls, Hold and Roll into Jan $17 calls in 6-8 weeks.. cool strategy to double on the double for the triple !!!"
"This week could be the greatest opportunity of the year to buy GE under $13 before it climbs higher. The stage is set for the institutions to show retail investors how it's done. I expect them to load up at these prices, scooping up the volume dumped by retail investors.Go, GE!Good luck, longs."
Should we see more downward movement now that the stock lost 20%. It probably goes sideways for awhile before finding its true direction. We should demand an explanation about the RS from the management. Losing $20B of its market cap is unacceptable and more losses will happen if RS actually happens.
500 shares at $8. looking good so far
"Former GE CEO Jeff Immelt just wrote new book Hot Seat. I love the chapter on cooking the books. It’s a how to guide. In order to accomplish this, there was collusion with the former GE CFO Jeff Bornstein who played a key role. Where were the auditors?My condolences to employees and former employees who have GE stock in the pension and retirement plans."
"The 9 cent a share would represent 8.7 billion shares multiplied by 9 cents a share = $783,000 million profit.Culp said this quarter he would deliver $2.5 (Free Cash Flow) profit.That profit he expectes is 3.2 time greater than all the ""experts"" predictions.Now either Lawrence Culp has it wrong or the ""experts"" cant do the math...Culp is a professional. He understates.He veers to giving clear and honest statements.The ""experts"" are selling themselves as ""experts"".They shoot with hardly any facts That is because they can not be called out.Neither you or I can reach them so they can hide ad after say they were wrong or surprised or even worse - claim they knew.I think Culp knows a lot more than the ""experts"". I project he will get closer to $3 billion profit in the 4th quarter 2020.If that was just $3 billion FCF for the 4th quarter - it would be no news.But Culp also told us the 2021 year they would be profitable all quarters.Simple math would take the FCF for 2021 to around $10 billion .At 20 times per share or a multiplier of $1.10 per share profit for 2021- the stock would be least at a $20 price.It is fashionable to under-estimate the number and then act surprised when the company exceeds the 9 cents a share on Tuesday.In this case the public already knows what the number will be ($2.5 billion) or maybe even more.So Tuesday either General Electric matches the estimated $783,000 profit predicted by ""experts"", and we find Culp is a basket case and does not know what the numbers he promised are actually supposed to be.Or Culp told us the profit was going to be at least $2.5 billionMy money is on Culp. The fact is that he is shrewd.If GE has 4th quarter profits of $2.5 billion, expect the stock to rocket upward Tuesday.I think $13 a share that day is totally logical."
The Giant GE has been awakened. Time to celebrate.
It takes a year's patient to be back!
How is your sentiment regarding GE today? Mine is PUTRID.
Out at 13.30 before this #$%$ goes down more. Was going to hold before but reverse splits don't usually end well.
"This has been a great shakeout - 5% of the float exchanged in 2 days. For every seller there is a buyer.If you read through this board, you'll see just who are panicking and the source of selling.This is a rotation from a too-large of a float with 30% held by retail to a much less-volatile in-line float held by institutions at a higher share price. Exit ramp is open for weak hands to decide. GLTA"

"For 2-3 months I have been slowly closing my position in technology companies and switching to shares related to the aviation industry and airline companies. GE, Boeing, Airbus, Lufhansa, Delta.There are already nice earnings, but the best is probably still ahead."
hard pressed to find a more pumped stock on CNBC--they mention it multiple times withe the same story line --like you can keep getting people to buy on thee same news-- nothing new here and investors day will find a reason to sell-- add to it the market is wildly over bought - target price 12.61
GE need to do something to get back the retiree investors. Those dividend cuts should never have happened.
"General Electric’s Chief Executive Officer, H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. believes that the company is well poised to benefit from improvement in business conditions and its plan of transforming itself into a high-tech industrial firm. Also, in the long run, the company is expected to deliver significant values to its shareholders, employees and customers."
bad time to even think about reverse split...bad move on BOARD members...I hope it would be cancelled in MAY when they vote.......EVERY ONE to say NEY.....NEY NEY
Do shorts cover now...like right now...or wait till $11.50 ?
Can someone please post a link to a press release about a reverse split announcement.￼
They want GE to go down to 5.x - if so I want GE CEO pay me back what I pay him
"Any idiot knows technically it is a zero sum game. So don't give me your MBA hogwash. All this reverse stock split does is eliminate a small guy who buys a couple of thousand shares at current price and the stock goes up a half of point & he makes $1000. Great percentage gain. This knocks this player right out of the game.Institutional investors, mutual funds, etf etc. They do not care because they have blocks of funds to invest unlike a nichol& dime trader Will you buy shares of GE @$13 x2000=$26000 or will you buy 2000 @ $80=$160000? How many of you are willing to invest that amount of money in GE?"
Any one has an idea why GE is opening low???. It had a superb run yesterday
The entire world knows that GE closed over $12.00 per share today. Bells are ringing.
"THIS JUST IN Jan 9th 2021 ANOTHER BOEING 737 ACCIDENT?Sriwijaya Air flight 182, operatING with a Boeing 737, maximum departure took off from Jakarta at about 1:56 p.m. local time and lost contact with the control tower at 2:40 p.m., said Indonesian Transportation Ministry spokesperson Adita Irawati.The incident comes a day after the one-year anniversary of the shooting down of a Ukraine International Airlines flight in Iran with 176 people aboard, one of two major airline crashes in 2020.

"There are exceptions, but generally reverse stock splits lead to further underperformance:Researchers at the Stern School of Business at NYU and Emory University looked at more than 40 years of data, from 1962 to 2001, and found that of the 1,600 reverse stock splits, shares underperformed their non-split peers by 15.6% in the first year following the split, 36% in the second year and 54% in the third year."

"Nice move GE board. Dow up 300, GE down 80 cents. 15 billion drop in market cap equates to 50% drop of selling GECAS at 30 billion. Once again GE screwed up. You want to reduce float? How about buying back 25% of the shares with the sale of GECAS. This reduces float to around 6 billion shares. then do a 2 or 3 to 1 reverse split to reduce float to 2 or 3 billion shares. The 8 to 1 is a joke, driving share price to about 100 per share. Nobody will want to invest in GE at that price. And an 8 cent dividend is not an enticement. 1 cent now, 8 to 1 reverse split should yield an 8 cent dividend. The market is reacting to your news, and it is not good."

"Here s the psychology of buying stocksHave you ever looked into the fresh shallow water in a clear pool or stream and seen a school of fish swimming in mass.The second one fish senses anything wrong - the whole school swims as fast A POSSIBLE AWAY FROM THE DANGER.After 10 minutes pass and the school of fish feel safer, they will return and go on with their own world.So this pattern is exactly how stock trades. All stock sales (buying or selling) are motivated by either greed or fear.Like the fish, the moment a group hears something to fear- they dump stock and head to a safe place like money on the sidelines.But it is always inevitable that after a short while, perhaps after a few trading sessions, the greed takes over and a lot of people buy stocks. The reason the above is so important is the understanding on how stocks move up and down.Nhat no stock can keep moving in an upward direction. At some point it becomes overpriced and people start to sell. The real result is the stock moves up and down dozens of cycles each day.It takes time to get accustomed to a higher price for any stock. A buyer is weighing the price against the higher greed price. As the stock drops, the buyer is consumed with greed and buys. But the stock also moves the other way.So when I hear someone want a stock to move a point in a day for a $13 stock - that is very unusual. I thing a 5% move in any stock in any day is far more that I want to see. And it is mostly true that few stocks can support 4 or 5 upward sessions without dropping back to a lower level before they move u again.GE hs risen in the past 26 weeks from $6 to $13. That is more than doubled ans there is not actual higher earnings to support the move.There is a lot of buzz that the stock is moving up to at last $20 a share so the last couple of dollars stock price movement is mostly the belief that better times are coming up.Nothing wrong with hope as long as you don't get consumed that GE will be $13.50 next week, $14 the following week, and then be at $15 by the mid April.It takes time and a balance emotional investor to ride a rising stock and ""know when to hold and when to fold"".For now GE is a ""hold"" - but t some time in the distant future it will reach a point where it will be a ""fold them"".Greed and fear always dictate the situation."
OH MY GOD! NOOOOOOO!!!! WHAT IS HAPPENING????
"The stock is not oversold yet, its in free fall"
I'm sitting on 139% profit and holding
reditt investors should put money in ge
Not gonna happen I guess but : does anyone remember GE going up 1 dollar in one day ? :)
last 30 minutes of trading oh what a surprise its falling again..
Classic head fake going into earnings to shake out the weak and get in at a better price. Good time to load up if you have some dry powder.
Oh man @marabound low life is losing his retirement savings.
If they can keep the news about RS quiet this could move up to $15 by early summer. IMO
Of the 1600 Pratt powered 777's in service. 59 were already grounded due to being old and the pandemic. The recurring issue is with their hallow blade design wearing out. This should mean that the planes taken out of service going forward will be theirs and not GE. GE engines will still be used and serviced. Further GE sales and market share are likely to improve having not only the most reliable but also the most fuel efficient options.
Just watched Larry for 15 minutes on Bloomberg. He spoke well but had numerous occasions where he appeared to have trouble swallowing! Also NO MENTION of a reverse split!
"Ge double my money, waiting for triple..."
If you keep listening to the shorts like the one at JP Morgan you'll end up like the poor guy in the GIF below. $GE is set to double this year alone based on chart price movement.
Motley Fool estimates the value of just GE’s Wind Turbine Renewable Energy business to be worth $36 Billion. Something to think about.
I declare Green Monday! 
Anyone remember the Citi Group split 10 to 1 ?
"I'm long ge, but dang 8.5billion shares is a lot! Culp better deliver on share buy back & soon. With new administration, a couple of upgrades will help along with pension fund buys of late. Ge will need to sell a heck of a lot of turbines to move this beast! The stock has already moved from 50billion to 100 billion in no time!"
30 mio volume in 30 minutes...
"It might close to 100,000,000 volume"
ed garden of GE board to speak on cnbc within hour

Pop! So predictable! BY next week will be up much higher though not everyday will be an up day!
The B/A size is saying it all
jj knows reverse splits. Remember SRRA? LOL
Barrons :GE Stock Is Soaring in 2021. Here’s Why.https://www.barrons.com/articles/ge-stock-is-soaring-in-2021-heres-why-51615209197
"""GE stock won't go anywhere 2021"" -- Tusa""GE call volume above normal and directionally bullish"" -- FlyOnTheWallWill be interesting to see investors rightly put Tusa in his coffin (figuratively) for his personal vendetta against GE once and for all. JPM really are out to get GE, for what? to sell GE in pieces?"
"The significance of the reverse split is being blown out of proportion by retail investors. It has no impact on valuation only the size of the float. And it has no impact on stock options. The strike price on the options will be adjusted after the split. There is so much misinformation on this board the past couple days it's hard to read. When selling is exhausted, the stock will rebound based on fundamentals."
"what I just ""heard"" from that CNBC interview is this reverse split will happen."
BAGGIES tomorrow
Remember to vote NO for anyone the Board recommends .
Amazing growth! Will this price hold tomorrow??
"the year of the CULP is nearing take-off, when it starts straight to $20"
"Microcap beer stocks, specifically microcap craft beer stocks will do well in the stagflation frozen liquidity economy that's coming."
"Cramer says BUY, BUY, BUY!!!"
chart says wildly over bought coming down with the soon to be seen market sell off-- see you at 12.61
Just looked and GE has MOVED BACK to the same price level as a month ago - around February 15th.Not so bad. All that is missing so far is the past 20 trading sessions and that can come back....
"This is horrible....what a s...t show. The deal is fair , but when the REVERSE SPLIT comes it knocks out the small guys. Its good for Larry Clup because the share price after the reverse split will be $112.00 per share. 8 x 14.....Its good for Larry Culp because he will get a huge bonus cause the share price goes way over 25.00. Its in his contract when he sign on as CFO....he will receive 25,000 million ...What a smart #$%$.....the small guys get the shaft....always vote no on the reverse split if your vote counts anyway.....Sad SAD ....Rigged and manipulated."
Nobody talking about this?https://www.gastopowerjournal.com/projectsafinance/item/11539-ge-wins-equipment-contract-for-biggest-power-plant-in-senegal
Four stages of Reverse Split.1) Denial - It's good for the company and shareholders.2) Anger - Why didn't I sell when I had a chance.3) Depression - It's going to take many years just to break-even.4) Acceptance - I got screw by this company.
As I posted yesterday AM - blowoff bottom then up - and here we are. Life goes on GE goes up
1 LAST MINUTE TO CLOSE POSITION UNLESS U HAVE AFTER HOUR TRADING CAPABILITY LOL DONT SAY WE NEVER TOLD U HOW WE FEEL HEHEHEHE
Trust me if this is worth anything they would not be doing a reveres split They must be expecting a big drop soon...........
up or down for Wednesdays open?
"Over the past few decades, Stock Markets have become a blatantly Rigged Casino...It is becoming more & more perverse, these days.."
"I'm adding in pre market if GE is green, and I believe it will be. my guess is $ 14.50 by weeks end. people know this company is coming back."
someone keeps can not handle the truth. keep killing my post. I have never seen a reverse split that benefited an existing stockholder!
Most people here don’t have a clue what a target price with no binding time mean. The clueless people are actually right because it doesn’t mean anything besides the bashing effort everybody can see. Stay put.
Where's that GE to $4 genius??
march 10 ge goes to $15...buyers are waiting for good news and i think Wed. meeting will be just the thing needed to keep things going..$15 wed and $20 by sept
The fundamentals has not changed! lol
Bond market selling off on inflation fears and Fed meeting today. Sector rotation trade is back on. Tech is dumping and money flowing into defensive positions like GE that benefit from a recovering economy. It's just crazy seeing all the posts this morning from short sellers. The entire Nasdaq is red! There are so many better short candidates. I think GE will re-test levels above $14 soon.
I see $12 sooner :D GL to all longs!
Buy on the dip!
"My advisor called my 2 weeks ago with the following message: ' Buy GE...at this price it is a bargain and expected to be $28.00 in one year, recommended as a buy by the company ( one of the big banks )! So I followed his advise and once again fall in the same trap....those advisors don't know anything."
UBS raises GE PT from $14 to $15; maintains “buy” rating. Reported by MT Newswire.
Let’s at least see a 6% day today !!!! Power hour is coming
This is 20 by Sep relax.
I imagine GE gas turbines are being ordered frantically across the South as I write. Buy.
"GE was the 1st stock i traded many moons ago. I loaded back up when it was trading at $6 a few months ago. With Larry Culp as CEO i really think this will be worth a fortune one day (long term). Lets not forget what Larry Culp did for Danaher and that he also has an huge contract bonus incentive if this stock reaches $18. But for now, $12 is the new hump to get over. Lets Go!!!"
They have a 46% stake in the newly formed company plus the 30 plus billion. Great deal but the reverse split is at 1-8 is not a good deal. If they approve get ready for another long snail climb in sp.
Pretty interesting article on the clean energy boom.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clean-energy-stocks-bearish-164813905.html
"I bought a heavy position at $5.98 and have made a lot of money,"
This is truly one of the Most Moronic Ideas that I have ever heard a large industrial company ever propose.GE should use half of its proceeds to buy back shares instead. Truly Moronic!
Really great to see GE start to come back I worked there 3 times My Father and Brother both retired from there
"The very definition of insanity,... Doing the same thing over and over, expecting a different outcome. GE no longer wants the retail investors business. You have lived out your usefulness to them."
"Wow, sounds like we've achieved partial capitulation. Blood is flowing but might have not hit the streets yet"
Any one thinking a reverse split is a good thing better research reverse splits to see just how it worked out for other companies.......nuff said.......(:
I would suspect GE is involved with the development of nuclear engines Said to be considered for interplanetary travel.GE is an exciting company.always moving the technology along to new heights
Within striking distance of $11 ...... :)
Again Yahoo takes down my free speech post.. welcome to socialism
so what will the stock price be after the split
"Logic. If a RS sends the stock down, than a stock split will send the stock up. So if they do a 8-1 stock split, we can expect shares to go up to 16 by the end of Friday."
fast money think they will cancel their decision to do that reverse split
Get out of the market this week. A major collapse is coming soon.
"No Country, NOT even Russia, China can make GE Aviation Engines. So GE VALUE WORTH shouldn't be $700 BILLION to $1 TRILLION?? China can make AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, Copy JPM products services, but not GE Aviation ENGINES (only a rare 2 or 3 companies can, even they FAIL in reliability. ONE and ONLY GE ENGINES BIGGEST, MOST RELIABLE, BIGGEST MARKET SHARE.. So, how much is GE WORTH??China can not make AVIATION ENGINES. They trying very hard. But not yet. China, even Russia is DEPENDENT on GE ENGINES. China/Russia ordered GE Engines worth $20 BILLION.. AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, LOL NFLX can not say that.. Now tell me what that says about GE VALUE, HOW MUCH IS GE WORTH to USA and the world. Do study GE Assets, it's products and services..PROUD TO OWN A TRUE Heart of American dream, whose assets, products and services spread across so many VITAL, CAN'T DO WITHOUT Technologies of USA WORLD GDP Economy.. I am Humbled by JPM to own GE..If NFLX trades between $200 BILLION and $130 BILLION, Shouldn't GE TRADE AT $900 BILLION and $1,000 BILLION ($1 TRILLION)??"

Shorts are crushed again
"Tusa will upgrade for sure soon enough. May be too late though to salvage his reputation. It's no good to pick the top, but miss the bottom. I call that a wash. Buy."
"GE is up 22% since Tusa reinstated his $5 price target and up 283% off that target. How does one look investors in the face when he is so far off the mark. It like a bad gambler that keep betting thinking he is going to win it all back. Once Aviation picks up, it could be lights out for Tusa."
"Relief, the 777 incident hurting Boeing, but not much of a negative impact to GE."
GE investment in renewal energy looks brighter today and so are the CEO and BofD salaries which may wipe out all of it.
"This should be at least $13-$15 right now , why doesn't reddit or who ever they are run this one up ? 100 billion company will be around another 100 years , 99 more years longer then gamestop"
Is it possible that after a 1-8 RS GE will buy back its shares at a much higher price? Any insightful thoughts on this?
"Hey Larry you want to know why your stock is down, its the the Reverse Split not the deal. None of your shareholders like this and they are voting by selling your stock! Don't let a stupid RS mess up all the good work you've done! I urge all shareholders who want to keep this investment to call the company and complain, RS are a sign of weakness not strength it goes against all the good work Larry done. CALL THE COMPANY AND FIGHT IT!!"
"Wait, weren't we supposed to be over 12 by year end? Pumper's juvenile predictions failed us again."
"GE short interest ratio is 1 day. It means those who short, have a short time to cover. Meaning, if the stock price rocket, it will trigger a short squeeze."
GE will shine in 21!
I am so sorry about the lower cap for the $1400.00 stimulus check; however most of you that claim you make so much money via Wall Street will most likely sit this stimulus check out.
guess close to 13.00
WOW....GAINED $1.25 AT OPEN ..AN HOUR LATER LOST ALMOST ALL OF ITS GAIN.......SADLY DISAPPOINTING.........
Looks like jj will be shorting fractional shares after the split. LOL
Down 6% on a stick reverse split.....that tells you its a bad idea.
Yes my PLUG or SPWR stocks are better performers but there will always be a place for a GE in my portfolio!
I’m in favor of the stock split. Why would you want 8 billion shares outstanding? Do you want to be like AT&T? No.....you don’t. You want to be like Amazon......a big boy.
"reverse splits are bad news for any company out there, especially one with a hugh debt."
A reverse split is never good for a company’s stock. Stocks only needs to stay above $2 to be comfortably safe from delisting. The fact that GE is announcing this now suggests that they think the stock will go below $2 soon if they don’t do a reverse split.... This could continue to go down.
"Start Joining the Group We will vote ""NO"""
GE will pop back to 11.50 next week. Today was just a knee-jerk reaction to the bad J&J results. We still got Pfizer and Moderna pumping out billions of doses. People will get vaccinated and air travel will boom. GE profit will skyrocket. Don't listen to these lowlife naysayers.
Take a bite out of that Goldman carrot. Go ahead. They have lots of shares to sell you.
Chicago the Windy City you put some wind in the sales of this GE ️ ￼
"The Export-Import Bank of the United States has agreed to guarantee two financing deals that will provide $125 million to support aerospace work at GE Aviation and Spirit AeroSystems.One of the deals is intended to inject liquidity into the struggling US aerospace supply chain, while the other will help Australian airline Qantas purchase seven GE engines, says the bank."
If there is no bounce back by close look out 11.35-11.50 tomorrow.

Ghosts of Immelt/Welch back.
Filling the gap. GE will be going up next week.
HEHEHE DOWN DOWN DOWN LAST FEW SECONDS
Now that GE grows up into teen-age years. Most difficult time. Let's hurry up into adulthood.
Another day without Apple making an offer to buy GE. What’s taking them so long? This is how Apple missed buying Netflix. I hope they don’t make the same mistake with GE.
The deal is on.

Come on...one more big push to 1 dollar today!!!
3.3M Shares bought in one minute pushed it over $13.
12's today. Maybe 11's. All softball questions on CNBC. Not impressed.
JJ tell us your position. You say you took a larger short position at 11.64. For how many sharesEveryone wants to know so we can all make fun of you as GE blows past 12. Lol
"Been on the GE train for 22 years, buying the dips all the way down to bring the cost of share average to around 23 / share. With the reverse split, I am reading that 7 of 8 shares I now own will be taken away. Yes the value at the time of split will not change, but am still in the red. Now with less shares, it will be a longer time to get up to even. Why would I as an individual investor approve this? I'm sure there are many others like me, who loaded up in order to get to even sooner. I have been waiting for this turnaround for a long time, enjoying this current share price and company strength improving. Any thoughts to share here, or am I missing something. All I see is items that include institutional investors, not individual investors."
Every time it moves up somebody dumps so I'm now short GE
"JP MORGAN is the number 1 enemy of GE and its shareholders and its agent TUSA keep back stabbing the company since they no longer make money on GE..........all GE investor please raise your price target to $50...If GE ever goes down to $5, be sure that would be the end of American industry as a whole and not just GE alone and that also would be the end of JP MORGAN as well......my price target just got raised to $ 50 with additional investment"

"Bought Ge from $6.5-$7.5, keep long"
GE share price is about as fair and balanced as Fox News.
"When $13 becomes the new floor, our long term uptrend will begin! This month or next, buy and hold!More MAX deliveries, F-15EX orders, and potential AirBus engine sales will give GE aerospace a big kick... "
GE can barely generate 0.50/share free cash flow. Why the run up? Current stock market action and GE stock is laughable.
Buying more $AMC Price is too good.... Theatres are insanely clean just went yesterday
"The big guys can handle a $14 stock just as well as a $112 stock and they must have done all they wanted (or could) with the stock, the thing they cannot handle is the large number (38% of float) of small potatoes messing up or taking advantages of their game plan going forward in the stock movement. This is the real reason for the RS, to make it much harder for the small potatoes to get into the play. Management has to cooperate with those so-called analysts/institution investors (they need, benefit and help each other all the times) as long as the RS does not hurt the company in any ways, it practically does nothing to the value of the company.If you have couple of years of patience with the stock, you will certainly not regret it, go with the big guys but you have to be able to read their movements like a chess player."
Ive never seen a reverse split cause positive in the short term. GE is a long term hold but theyve just put a bullet hole in their own collective feet. Im bidding 6. For now and 48 pps after ReVERSE split in May....May. With a variety of Pundits claiming a major pullback in April this might get dicey. Taking 50% profit. Thanks GE...see you later when the smoke and mirrors clear.
Buy and hold then forget it and come back in 6 months or a year. You will be happy! Sure beats a CD rate of return!
4Q Conf Call starting in 3 min

"Today is the day to buy. It's a Friday and looks like the panic selling this week is over and done. Setting up for a great next week. Let's go, GE!Good luck, longs."
This will probably end up being $40 - $50 a share after the reverse split.
$GE Partnership coming Your welcome !!! I’d still SELL and BUY $FFNTF and $RWBYF
"one bear who did confirm improvements in ges balance sheet Inch who had one of the lowest price targets on Wall Street, at $7 a share. Now his price target for the stock is $11"
reverse split is the best decision the management made to eliminate excessive trading. Ge will become a buy and hold stock with stable future. this is a buying opportunity. long and strong
The market index went up too much today. Prepare for market correction. GE might drift down with market. Prepare to load up if it dropped down to $12.5. The price $12.5 is becoming a support level for GE. It was a resistance level a week ago.
I HATE the financial gimmickery of reverse splits. Get back to making stuff even if it is lightbulbs.
"$33 billion added to $45 billion, approaching $80 billion and in the year of the CULP. $25 quickly on stock then a buy side acquisition, then $50 stock, buying every share I can this week, before Berkshire steps up congrats. CULP"
"I am buying again under $12.5 here. It is amazing that I have an opportunity to buy under $12.5. In March 10, GE will be back above $13.5! Remember GE is a stock for long term. GE’s for business sectors (aviation, health, energy and finance) will benefit from pandemic recovery. Moreover, GE pension will gain from interest raising. GE will be $16 to $22 by the year end. Thus, buy when GE stock price’s in weakness."
whats up with the aftermarket red? is this a glitch or real? $10???
"In this new Covid bill, they put massive pension relief for companies...this will dramatically help GE!! The Balance Sheet of GE was getting much better but this change will really expedite how good the Balance Sheet is...GEs Karma is really starting to change!!!"
"As expected, once they paid $200MM for unethical behaviors, more lawsuits will be filled. GE to $4. Too much mud in their system, no clarity to financial accounting. They deserve to go to the dust."
This has politics written all over the script.
Just added to position will buy more don't care about rs GE will be a 125.00 stock!!!
A Repeat of DANAHER is just beginning GE the best Buy on NYSE. fast move to $20
Scandinavian Airline SAS Signs Multi-Billion Engine Deal With GE
Tesla lost 90 billion in market cap THIS WEEK. That is about 76% of GE's current value.
I’m kinda confused why would GE do a reverse stock split. If they are going to do well this year. I’m just wondering? It seems like they got some nice deals in and can really do well without one.
The days going back to $7 is over. They’re a much better company than they were then. Adding on any weakness. GE is going to $30+
I like GE and RAD in the new year.
Premarket makes it look like it will make another run upwards today.Would love to see 12 in the next week
every time reverse split never good... For that reason I'm out....
what a mess....not sure if i trust culp anymore..seems to favors big investors
Tusa for president!!

I would think that $VRAY would be an acquisition target from $ISRG or $GE Medical or some other company. They have a large back order and a bigger company could really get production and installation going at a faster pace. Maybe they don't see the value that I do.
"I think GE’s timing could have been better with regard to the reverse split announcement, it made me question the strategy. Although it may be a good business move for not only the company, but in the long run the regular investor as well, they should have rode the GREAT news of the AerCap Deal at least until next earnings report. In my opinion, GE share price would have at least rose to 17-18$ by then, no? I’ve been with GE since 2012 and have bought shares at 30$ and as low as 6.50$. I believe in this Company and I am very excited what Culp is doing to simplify GE’s model, lower its debt, and look after their employees and their customers. Future earnings and revenue should greatly sharpen as time transpires. We just need to be patient and it will happen, especially with energy efficiency talks growing rapidly and GE leading the way with wind turbines off shore in the U.K., no? Until public opinion grows extremely bullish (another 3-4 mo or so), the share price will gradually climb until it finally explodes to what it should be worth with their prevailing winds. I estimate that to be $27.80 in the short term and $38.50 in the long run.I’m an average, novice, amateur investor and not a financial advisor. Trade and invest at your own risk. This was simply a conversational post. Take care everyone and whether you are bearish or bullish, I wish all future prosperity."
187 mamaMILLiON shares traded. After huge earnings beat. And this is barely up? Lol
It's not going to go down anymore. Positive sentiment is too high and the fact is the reverse stock split isn't a negative in the long run. Travel Surge on the way!
Close over 13?
I believe in Larry. That's the bottom line. I'll hold this for a LONG time.
"Exactly what I thought... They plan on selling their 46% interest in the combined entity, later down the road. Likely after the industry has recovered. This will be more revenue to pay off debt and continue to get them back to being a core industrial company... This is going to be a VERY good long term move for GE."
"The MMs pumped up the sp during the last hour to short (sell) 11.50 Call Options for next week..They do this every week , either on Fridays or Mondays!"
"Can we get a just kidding on the reverse today? Seriously, this is shaping up to be my only holding in the red this am."
Oh My!!! To the moon Alice!
Today we can say it again....Great Day to All GE Investors!!! 
It would be cool if GE selling new jet engines were relevant but its not because TPTB are just going to move onto the next plandemic since everybody knows what Covid is. Ebola is the next scare factor.
"Looking for others to sell, the idea that the CEO has no core is fluttering"
GE: 20.00 pps by March. You'll see.
GE is a $30 stock. Just set it and forget it. Thank me in the future.
Pushing 60mill shares now.
"GECAS ""deal"" has to pass regulators. GL with that. Especially EU regulators. More smoke screen. $36B asset division merging to make a $30B company? Uh huh"
"First up, GE announced it would be combining its aircraft leasing business, GECAS, with AerCap (NYSE:AER). The deal involves GE receiving $24 billion in cash, a 46% share in the combined company that currently has a combined market value of $6 billion, and an additional $1 billion in AerCap notes or cash upon closing. As part of the deal, GE will transfer $34 billion of GECAS' net assets to AerCap."
This merger is going to be crazy. A month ago I said $14 by March 15 April.... looks like it’s going that way. I thought it was going to go sideways after $16.. but now I see $17-18 by the spring summer... hopefully $20 by the end of the year or next year $30
"After analyst day our friend Tusa still has a $5 target for GE stock price, this guy never gives up and is harming his customers, if there are still any listening to him. All other analysts gave a price target ranging from $13 to $15.

"jeebus 8 for one reverse split? Let's do the math. I own 100 shares ... 1337 *7/8 = $1170 loss. Welp, take a capital loss on 2021 tax return."
I believe that GE is bullish and it is only moving upwards. I choose to buy more shares in the next few weeks.
Every reverse split I received in 40 years has been bad for the stock price in the long run.
"GE Says “Momentum Is Building for 2021, and Sets a Reverse Stock Split”Hello GE if you have confidence in your stock value rising buy back shares! If you think your business is failing and you are afraid of getting delisted then you set a Reverse Stock Split!"
Out of the 500 S&P and the 100 NASDAQ Composite = 600 only 77 shares are up. If no but when there us going to be a huge rally tomorrow or by the end of the week.
If had a dollar for all the Good news about GE
This is what GE is now!
"They should crush earnings next week. Stock might not move much, because this dog is so manipulated, but I’m still holding my $12 March calls.. a month from now it will not be trading under $12."
"Some people on this board are trying to convince you, with wrong information, to unload your shares at this low price so they can scoop them. I welcome the R/S by Mr. Culp and the board. I believe they are doing it for the benefit of the co. and share holders. My asset allocation for this co. will give me 400 share @1-8 split. I went through a 1-3 with Duk and 1-10 with ETFC (E-trade) and they worked out very well for me. If you want to give away your shares at a low price to liars and shysters, it's you decision. I WILL NOT!"
"This guy ""Ed Garden"" is not giving investors what they want to hear. He's double talking and dogging the only subject that retail investors want to know about. And the reporter on CNBC is just soft balling him easy questions. Total bull!! Reverse your decision to a 1 for 8 reverse split!!!"
"Prodigal sons and daughters, you are always welcome back home to GE. We're not going anywhere we've been around over a hundred years and a hundred plus years to go to all the GE long investors out there!"
GE is the kind of stock you just buy and forget it. It will be in the $20s soon enough. I used to work for them at Power Systems in Atlanta. If they get that turned around --- watch out. We will go to the $40s. Culp just may be the best CEO in the world right now.
52-week high! let's hold $12
"Seems there is a lot of guessing about GE's future path and rate of recovery. However, in 16 days GE reports 2018 Q4 earnings and Larry Culp presents his turnaround plan containing how GE will deliver on the $420,000,000,000 order backlog ($94,000,000,000 for Power segment), the pension risk reduction of over $7,200,000,000 due to the Fed tax rate increases, the schedule for completing the Transportation sale to Wabtec and shares delivered to current GE share holders, the schedule for spinning off GE Healthcare and the shares delivered to current shareholders, the value of the recent Iraq Power deal ($15,000,000,000), and too many more positives to mention. The future is bright for GE"
What a hot steamy dump ge has become
We can not get any upward movementI would be happy with a .05 increase todayThis week has been rough. I am still holding strong through earnings
Tusa of JPM is not giving up on destroying GE...
shorted this this morning will be a mega good trade
my texts are respectable you Yahoo should let us write we need to express ourselves it's more damaging to censor our thoughts ....
"Technically, where is the bottom?"
I think it would help if Management explains why they think they need a reverse split otherwise everyone just assumes it is bad. Besides they need to convince shareholders otherwise more selling will happen and will not get approved.
"The Reverse Split Short Squeeze.If you are caught holding a short position on the day the stock reverse splits, it will turn into a GME situation. Shares being bought back frantically, margin call after margin call and $GE will sky rocket. That's what the shorts want to avoid and will spread as much disinformation and lies as possible in order to make you jump ship. Less shares means the price can move up faster and less short manipulation because the share price movement could easily bankrupt a short."
Suddenly my $12 puts are looking a LOT better.
"Volume slows down, institutions sucked up the cheapies. Now a traders paradise for a little while. Then everybody will understand the substance of the deal whilst business picks up. Institutions to enjoy both effects...."
"Bottom line: The reverse split hurts the little guy. Period. If you think it doesn't, you do not know basic math."
It's gone up hundreds of percents recently and I believe it will do that again with or without a RS (which is just rumor anyway)
"To all the GE longs, Congrats!!"
"Your money will have to work much hard after a R/S to make a profit. Typically stock prices fall about 20% after a R/S. Then, you have 1/8th the amount shares. If you are a shareholder, vote against this. On top of this, the market is EXTREMELY HIGH and we have fools in office. It is going to correct so that $104 split price will likely fall about 20-30%. Your money is going to have to work a lot harder. The rich won't have a problem because they will just buy in after R/S."
Not just Texas need to rebuild their electric infrastructure but the whole nation and perhaps the whole world. Climate change finally creating problems for humanity. Soon Venice the small city in Europe will be under water. More ice melting into the sea means heavier rain and flood everywhere plus higher wind. Hurricanes will cause havoc everywhere. It’s coming true. Just logical science. The melted ice water creates more water vapor going up into the clouds creating super storms. You don’t need to be a scientist to see this logically.
General Electric is up 5.38% to 13.22
Boeing 737 Max aircraft set be cleared to resume flights in Europe next week

Wow... this chart pattern is showing the Bullish Steam Roller!
We had our chance to finally sell this garbage after earnings was released... now we can watch it bleed lower the next 3 months
Reddit
A Boeing 757-200 had to make an emergency landing 2 hours ago. Very thankful that no one was hurt. I am also very thankful that the plane didn't have a GE engine.
This isn't going to make one bit of difference in what the the company is actually worth. But it's killing the price of the stock.
"If you had told me last week that GE was going to do a deal that erases 30 billion in debt, and retains the ability to capitalize on aviation recovery, AND Boeing is going to take a huge order of Max jets and GE will drop by 10%...I would have told you that you were crazyMaybe after the weekend retail investors will realize the over reactionMaybe notBut I am holding on (despite the beating I am taking) because I believe in the fundamentals of the business and I do not think that the reverse split fundamentally changes much"
"bofa came out with an analysis of its ownsees increase in fcf,but some impairment in revenues , due to virusagain based on opinion"
To all you nay sayers....your outta of here!!!!
"All told, the U.S. economy contracted at a 3.5% annualized rate in 2020, for the biggest drop since 1946. ?MAGA?"
Always thought an investor's day would be a positive outlook on the company. Never have seen an investor's day result in a 10% decline in the stock price. But again it is GE.
OkGuys; will we get a pop in GE stock if Democrats sweeps Georgia?
Are earnings pre market or after
Hahaha. It will not go anywhere except down to $4.
buying this stock is like playing russian roulette!
"Regarding RS...my initial thought was not good...but after reflection, I wonder now if it is actually a good move. If GE is doing this to get back into the DOW, won't funds/indexes that track the DOW have to buy GE stock? That would by HUGE buying pressure to get it into their portfolios. Am I missing something?"
Great earnings to be followed up by a huge PR by Friday - book it!
"This has to come down, crazy buyers don't have a clue on valuation. Market corrects all stocks with time. This has to come down to $8 - $9."
"rj, you are right about a huge market correction coming. But, the Congress has been holding off with the next stimulus package (1.9 trillion) announcement until the market forces the issue. Now everyone knows that Monday the market will force the issue and the Congress better release the approval stimulus news or there will be a one day substantial correction. This Monday. Fasten your seatbelts because we are heading for demolition derby."
"If share holders approve reverse split come May 2021 then the board of directors will decide when to implement the reverse split, ""it can only be done on any day after May 2022"". If it was to get approved by share holders it would result in total devistation to anyone holding a short position in the stock the day the stock reverse split, eqal to instant margin call. Way too much misinformation about reverse splits on here pertaining to a financially health company, with projected positive cash flow for the year and increasing cash flow for the following years going forward. Here is a link article to further improve your financial education about the matter: https://investorplace.com/2021/03/ge-stock-8-for-1-reverse-stock-split/?mod=mw_quote_news"

"Matt Lohr, of Lohr Interests, is significantly adding to his positionof GE. Note: Matt was my roommate at Georgetown University.I bought 500 more shares today."

"Miss F ,jj chicken we told you Do not bet against king Larry It is just a binging"
"JJ doesn't know what he is talking about. Texas turbines are made by Mitsubishi, Not GE. He is trying to scare GE holders because he knows GE is going up steadily. Also, read this. ALL turbines are capable of withstanding cold temps, if they are ordered with automatic deicing. If GE were to be blame for ""some"" turbines freezing, then the stock would have gone down a lot.The claim that frozen wind turbines are to blame for blackouts in Texas is MISSING CONTEXT. While some wind production is offline in the state, it is losing far more generation from thermal sources that produce the majority of power in Texas. Some wind turbines are frozen, but that is because turbines in Texas aren’t built to withstand unusually cold temperatures, as are turbines in colder climates where wind production is used."
"my last post was deleted. forget about the short position, volume will rock it tomorrow. i love robinhoods!!!"
The Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan initiated a position in General Electric (ticker: GE ) stock
"All the weak hands are out. Now, it climbs back up."
what is a fair price for GE when it splits 60-70-80$
AM SO SO HAPPY SHORT GE SHORT GE THERE IS TERMITES REVERSE SPLIT
"Where did JJ's short position post go ?. I read it last night, he shorted 5000 shares GE at 11.92, and another 5000 at 11.95. But that post disappeared. What's up with that ?. I guess he does not anyone to see that. Here is my prediction......if GE were to go down, he will post that he shorted at higher prices. If GE goes up, he will post he bought lower. Typical."
reverse split probably to increase valuation for the company and take out most short term traders.The stock price will rise much faster after the split. This is the case for GE. Good for long term holders. Weak hands should buy more and hold long term instead.
Tusa still holding at $5?
Buying here.
"Doesn't the dividend per share increase along with the price with a reverse split, since the investors now has less shares? That in itself would be a draw. Also wouldn't the EPS increase since there are less available shares."
YAY for me! Just stole 900 $GE at $13.40 Fly the friendly GE jet engines.
"That's it?! Almost seems as if the decision to a RS has depressed this stock or something,.... Hmmmm. Nasdaq going green, Dow record highs, yet, GE's struggling to recover over $13.50. Guy's, what's will it take for you to realize this company doesn't want you as an investor."
"A miss for 1cent , but still make a profit of 8cents. Profit is profit."
The management in mahogany row are considering an 8-1 reverse split to reduce outstanding shares. Well I just dumped my full position at a nice profit...so now now you are at least down 1200 shares.
GO King Larry!
Out of this stock or holding? Which is bettet option?
"Reverse split is a deal breaker, I'm out"
Now that’s a return to take to the bank. Market tripled and GE down 90 %. 20 years of losses. And still being led by a Culprit at the helm.
"Get ready friends. GE stock prediction is $ 30 + by Dec.31, 2021!Contracts, greatly improved revenue flow, strengthening the GE machine! Jg"
You will not be able to get out fast enough. They really trapped the hopeful longs.
$15 before Jan '22 ...
Watching these other stocks up another 91% such as GME simply makes you sick owning GE
Im waiting for a short squeeze.
Wouldn't be surprised to se us bounce over $13 today.
So many buy orders. Someone knows something we don’t...
"I dumped it. Not so much for the reverse split but if you value GE at 112 based on earnings projections I don't really see it going anywhere and there are better buys in the Space. Culp didn't wow anyone today and he probably #$%$ off a few. Reverse splits are like drinking Castor oil supposed to be good for you but yuck. I saw no reason to add to this, so goodbye for now. Maybe it sells off post split , I would take it at 80."
"The sale of the jet lease biz frees up a whopping $30 billion (billion!) Off their books, essentially ending the massive headache known as GE Capital. Now, the other headache, their legacy insurance division, still exists, hopefully CEO Culp will wind that down too. Won't happen overnight, but a major hurdle is gone. 2021 has already been a great turnaround year for GE. Keep the faith, longs!"
The turnaround is happening...GE will be an epic comeback story.
"Sorry...meant they ""used"" GE Trade secret info to win 100's of millions...."
Somebody bought $12 calls expiring in April n invested over $2.1M!! Bought at around$.75...
the drop has started better get out
will GE top $30 like it did when Obama was president?
$11.53 @ 11:53C time.
$20 is definitely coming
GE is a safe haven in a down market aka...stock bubble burst. If I had a choice of where my money is during a crash it would be GE. It will not go down at an equivalent rate of other inflated companies that are oversold and expensive.
"GE IS THE ONLY MAJOR, MAJORE EV ELECTRIC STORY THEY ARE KEEPING UNDER THE RADAR, QUIET.. You do not hear a single noise attention to GE's name is ELECTRIC, GE Technology is ELECTRIC POWER.

"I wrote earlier, that GE will own 49 per cent of the new AERC company; it will be 46 per cent, I misread. Still, with 30 bn cash, it’s a helluva deal from Culp. Looking at Baker Hughes plus the AERC value to come, debt will be in a normal level of 3 to 5 times of cash flow (which is considered to be quite normal). If there is a halfway normal segment profitability for aviation (I mean halfway compared to 2019) stock will go 20. Thank you, Mr. Tusa for confusing everyone, look to the 10k filing of GE for a change and do your job."
How nice our dividends all went to the top peoples bonuses nice
"We lose 1/2 of aviation business for $24 billion.More than likely, this affected GE valuation, even with the money going to reduce debt load."
"btw, NOBODY on this board knows what they are talking about.... including me"
"it is ridicules to sell in good news. we all should trust Culp, he won't let us down."

"Almost all reverse splits are done by failing companies trying to avoid being delisted. That is not the case with GE. It’s neutral news. The stock decline is retail investors not understanding that it’s neutral news over reacting. GE is doing exceptionally well. The board wants the stock to be reflective of its peers, and make it more difficult for guys like Tusa to push the price down with nonsense news. But to say “in my experience” means you are most likely comparing apples to oranges."
They cut the dividend few years ago so its been dead money for me and now reverse stock spit. Why stay invested in this company?What is easier a share of stock going from 10 to 20 or 100 to 200?You want to lower the number of share ge . Buy back your stock.
"So what changed since Tuesday? Oppenheimer going to neutral because the stock hit their price level, and Tusa reiterating his $5 target? Nonsense. Purely HFT's playing games. Buy."
GREAT YEAR OF THE CULP
US stock market is very overvalued. The bull market seems running out of strength. We may see a big correction in near future. Prepare to accumulate more GE when it dropped together with the market. GE is the only stock I like to buy in today’s overvalued market.
when that 13 breaks H to pay
If GE can break 13.24 we could retest 15.01.

"What GE really needs to do to accelerate its growth rate and strengthen its technology leadership in the entire tech sector is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for GE (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if GE just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

How much more tomorrow?
final chance to load on the cheap. GE will be 15 by the time they execute the RS this would translate to $120 post RS. in 2 - 3 years GE stock will be in 300-400 range. time will tell and do your own DD.
"While NASA revised its timeline for the X-59 Quiet SuperSonic Technology (QueSST) demonstrator to reflect anticipated first flight in 2022, the agency remains encouraged that construction of the X-plane had reached the halfway point by late last year despite complexities associated with the pandemic.In a recent update, the agency said assembly of the Mach 1.4 aircraft “made great strides” in 2020 as work progressed on the flight deck, wings, and other hardware. In addition, GE Aviation delivered the F414-GE-100 engine that will power the X-59 QueSST in the third quarter. Program partner Lockheed Martin is assembling the aircraft at its Skunk Works facility in Palmdale, California, under a $247.5 million NASA contract."
"Volatility, the reason that I invested in GE was to avoid excess volatility. Who knew that management alone was going to be responsible for the extreme volatility."

"Mr Culp is doing it right n the street is starting to see the benefits...couple that with the new round of stimulus helping the airlines, that will only help propel GE..think of where they were pre Mr Culp n.where their FCF is now...look forward another two years n think about where he will take GE...my educated guess is FCF of $7 to $9B n a stock price of $50!!! Yes, almost a 400% increase...mark this post!!"

"GE Aims to Slash Debt by 35% by 2023The company says it has a lot of options to cut borrowings once its deal with AerCap closes.Lou Whiteman(TMFeldoubleu)Mar 17, 2021 at 12:00PMGeneral Electric's (NYSE:GE) $30 billion deal to sell its GECAS aircraft financing arm to AerCap Holdings (NYSE:AER) is a key milestone in the industrial conglomerate's effort to get its balance sheet under control, the company's chief financial officer said on Wednesday, giving GE ""multiple paths"" to bring down its debt.Speaking at a Bank of America conference, GE chief financial officer Carolina Dybeck Happe said the company expects to have gross debt of about $70 billion once the GECAS deal closes, down from $104 billion at year's end. The company wants to bring that $70 billion figure down by about 35% to $45 billion by 2023, largely by cutting its roughly $43 billion in borrowings nearly in half.If the company is successful, that should bring its net debt down to about 2.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), compared to net debt of about 6 times EBITDA today.Happe said the company has ""multiple paths"" to reach its goal, including proceeds from its many divestitures and expected growth in free cash flow. GE will also own about 46% of AerCap after the deal closes, subject to a lockup of up to 15 months. Happe said that the company is likely to monetize that stake ""when the cycle recovers"" for airlines post-pandemic.General Electric is in the middle of a multiyear turnaround. The company is currently worth about one-sixth of its $600 billion market cap at the turn of the century, weighed down by its massive debt load and some market-topping acquisitions.The new GE will be smaller and more focused on aviation, healthcare, power, and renewables, with most of its financing and debt tied to those industrial businesses.Happe said that she expects current-quarter cash flow for GE to be ""meaningfully improved"" from the first quarter of 2020, a key metric analysts have been following in tracking the turnaround."
In GE better days are coming. Congrats Longs
The only buyers today will be shorts to cover.
"Institutions day trade this thing EVERYDAY! Where do you thin all of the volume comes from? 1000 shares traders? LOL Quit acting like this RS is nothing but a way to limit the little guy. It is a last ditch effort from a dying company to save itself. It is NO surprise this was put together after all of the upgrades and supposed ""good"" news.

Given everything I have found, I’m coming up with a break up value of GE, somewhere in the range of $22-$24 per share. I’m curious if anyone has come up with a similar conclusion? I can’t be off in my numbers by nearly half. Anyone?"
GE overpriced!!!!Do your research!!!!Let it drop to reasonable price.
GE is overvalued by minimum 40% and expect it to fall by 75% to $4.
"tomorrow is the dayge / culp where we are, where we are goingfacts will determine share value"
To all board members. GE will be a junk stock if this reversal goes through. Mark my words.
When this market finally crashes after this 12 year bull market.. it will take everything with it including GE
Literally GE is a getting back to be a great company what would come out better for them is if they can find a way to make renewables more profitable for them
"I can see the PUMPERS coming out in force. It's not going to do any good. GE misses 4Q and down we go back to single digits. Take a short position now to cover your losses. Culp is not the great CEO that PUMPERS have been claiming. Larry is lining his pockets, just like past GE CEOs."

"Reverse Split Advantages for GEThe move wouldn’t directly change the value of the company or an investor’s position, but it would shrink the number of shares outstanding to about 1.1 billion.In theory, a company’s share price in and of itself doesn’t matter—its total value can be divided by any number of shares.But some investors avoid shares below certain thresholds, and some stock exchanges require companies to keep share prices above certain levels: $1 on the Nasdaq, for example. Some institutional investors won’t invest in companies with stock prices below certain levels.Practically speaking, investors often seem to see higher-priced shares as more attractive—and companies with prices below certain thresholds, like $10 or $1, as shakier. In the market, of course, perception matters."

BUY SIGNAL NOW !!!. For GE_to_4 Time for you to learn something !!!.
Reverse Splits are always the Kiss of Death for the retail investors.
Buyers will regret not getting GE shares today trying to save few more pennies on price... tomorrow they will pay more. 
reverse split makes EPS and PE ratios look a lot better.After selling some of business you need to shrink shares too
This obviously will not be a day for rebound...stuck around low $13....any uptick will trigger selling
"GE spokesman talking on CNBC right now, only thing anyone wants to hear this guy say is that they will not do a 1 for 8 share reverse split! That's all investors want to hear!"

"Culp definitely goofed up here. Clearly doesn't understand the market.250m share traded today. Of course he wanted that volume after analysts day. But talk about losing investors billions. As well as employees.No reason why this won't drop another dollar tomorrow.The reverse split is scaring investors away. Everyone is thinking.....I don't want 1/8th of number of shares I currently own! I know from the standpoint of earnings divided by diluted shared count, it makes no difference, but its the perception. If the stock continues to drop lower and reaches $5..you can bet institutions will dump this.Colossal failure by Culp with regards to investors."
Immelt missteps now a thing of the past thanks to Culp. Go man go.

another day and another ge negative like a broken record.
Time to buy some JAN 29 $12 call options?
Shorts covering at 15 I love it
JJ . Maybe you have a chance to short more @ 13.50 . Who knows?
Almost 2% drop with 25% of the average daily volume!Who is RIGGING this share price?
GE will be $50 stock again in he next few years. Hold on tight.
"No reason to lie about anything! I'm a dividend man and I don't deny it. ENB brought in $3000 dividend alone into my piggy bank last year. Now! A good comparison - (1) share of DUK provides $3.68 per year whereas 368 shares of GE provides the same value. My 10000 shares of DUK provides a nice yearly income from my Roth IRA which the qualified distribution is not affected by taxes at all.If I depended on my dividend from GE, I would be homeless and hungry. Just waiting for GE to go belly up so I'll have a nice tax write off."
GE & ACRX are both climbing pre market!!!!
buy at 10.20 - buy
"GE's stock was valued in the single Digits for a reason. We lived through the Reign of two CEOs that Window Dressed this company to a higher valuation. But as we all say it was a highly undeserved valuation. Now GE's CEO and Board of Directors is trying to tell us that a Reverse Split of 1 for 8 will put us back in the stratosphere of $100 to $114 a share. Plenty of people lost their shirts and more on this company and now they want to take away their monetary leverage of regaining some of their losses. Yes GE has jettisoned some of its losing divisions, but it is still a risky company, but we were their Cheer Leaders. But at $100 a share GE will lose a lot of its following. The enthusiasm for holding the stock will mostly be gone. Mutual Funds and Hedges will have to support it. But GE won't stay at $100 -$114 a share. Its not just a Mathematical Equation. There is a large Psychological component. And that will be Lost. GE will sink to $70 and maybe even drift into the $60s.GE will become a Short Sellers Picnic.(Maybe the Yahoo Sensor won't Delete this Post this Time)"
GE is trading with range of split announcement as expected and will be range bound until after the split. Watch and learn.
1M premarket shares traded in 7min. Looks good for today!
"Jeff Immelt on CNBC ...... what a SCHIESTER ..... his net worth is $50,000,000 . "
hahahaahaha Tusa get ready by tomorrow morning premarket hours
GE's just getting warmed up. Buy back those shares before margin call.
"Wow look at them calls being traded: eg the March 19 15 strike over 20,500 volume."
"I added more like I said I would under 12. I bought at 11.96. I hope more did the same. Now people are talking about tax hikes that will affect stock market. Until the loopholes are done away with in our tax system companies will not feel any pain from increases. When it was 38%, most companies paid under 10% while the good ole working man gets screwed on taxes as usual."
GE doesn't have the kind of short interest to make a squeeze even worth speculating. It's less than 2%.
"Let’s talk facts. CNBC fill me up on stocks that reacted positively with this kind of news, the reversal just around the corner. I challenge CNBC. Show us the facts"
"such negativity.IBM had similar fits and challenges once upon a time. what if GE and IBM merged. it'll never happen. but God bless the m&a deal maker who finds a partner. oh but wait, why could it not happen? a merger that is."
What happens to the stock tomorrow?
Buying opportunity or get out?
Make GE Management feel it!! Timber!!! Reverse the Reverse split decision!!!
"Chicken little, the sky is falling! Where are the doom and gloomers this AM? Hmmmmmmmm"
Ignore the naysayers. GE will be a $20 as the economy reopens!
The only stock doing well today!
GE Fundamentals Could Attract More Long-Term Investors
renewable regardless is here to stay.... no one is selling ge it's moving up steady .... what all Investers look for....
"This is a real company stock that survives during pandemic. With the bosses that work hard for the company and their investors. I hope to see 20s soon. For now, we should be happy"
"How fewer shares will make more shorts. on contrary fewer shares keeps short away. Those who are not comfortable welcome to sell , AH is down 11 cents meaning not many sellers."
"Nice job GE board. How to lose 15 billion in market cap, and have investors running for the hills. A 1 for 3 reverse split with stock buybacks would be better."
"FYI: On March 4, Morgan Stanley analyst Josh Pokrzywinski said the evont could be a catalyst for shares and upped his GE stock price target by 31% to 17."
"If it was bad, big fund would be dumping...."
AM SURE SOME BIG BOYS TURN BEARISH KNOWS LOOK AT THE VOLUMN HEHEHEH E
This is holding up nicely in a down market!
GE 10s coming tomorrow. OMG!
"C is trying to scam you. Over and over the same post. Upside to a RS? ya right. It is a desperation move by GE and everyone else knows it. Why desperate? Because they are still in deep trouble. The RS proves it. Deal in facts, not conjecture"
If you have owned this stock for years you lost the biggest opportunity in a lifetime to make serious money with so many other stocks... most are trading in the 300.00 range. You are only wishing and guessing for GE to make any meaningful move higher. Basically it’s to late in the game with a beat market looming.
"What we have here is a total disregard for the changes implemented by a superstar CEO....the sentiment was so bad that even good news was greeted with a yawn. No one wanted to own GE....but, then the tide began to change ever so slowly......green shoots appeared....analysts begrudgingly acknowledged that progress was being made....even in the face of a pandemic. Then, it happened....the perma BEAR from JPMorgan changed his tune....not his price target mind you....because that would mean he had made a mistake. No, he just switched from SELL to HOLD.....IMO that's as good as ringing a bell. So, for those of you who held your nose and bought shares during 2020, I say ""well done"". Now, enjoy the ride....and let the hamster run!!"
If only you who sold last week listened. Congrats to all longs. Double your investment this year
"If you think is gonna go higher, you don't know split. GE will trade flat until the hopefuls get frustrated and then it plunges."
RS might not get approved or they could rescind that statement. Nothing else has changed since Tuesday. Stock will start to head back up and make new highs. They are a definite real opening stock.
Interesting article on the Haliade-X wind turbines by $GE in the NY Times last week. These monsters will be coming to our ocean shores this year. Vineyard wind project will ‘only’ be 800MW but we will start seeing multiple GW farms globally this year/decade. $FAN
$47M reward for taking the stock down from $10 to $6 and back up to $10. Nice.
Nothing but daily noise. GE is in all the right businesses for this administration and the grand reopening. Check back in Jan 2022
$30B coming into the cash register. This CEO isn’t playing games. Thank goodness we don’t have the old ceo anymore. Let’s go!
GME up another +90% pre market...... but I own this garbage called GE
So far do we have reverse split? Thanks.
"My target price for JPM is 20.00, they have to much debt and to many lawsuits."
"Mr. H. Lawrence Culp Jr. promised $32.31 a share by October 31, 2023. If he succeeds he stands to make ( I believe it was something like a $280 million bonus.) That's one hell of a incentive!4"
$12 and above soon!
"50% of all wind turbines in W. Texas frozen solid when needed the most. GE.....we bring good things to life.Sold my stock years, years ago"
This is a train wreck
Reverse split ended the golden goose.
"I hope the stock pulls back for a couple days, maybe back down as far as 11.60. If it keeps going up, we might lose JJ forever "
Soon will come out with a PR to stop or slow the bleeding.
I'm out in all my accounts. I bought this stock when it was $25 something (2013) I added to average down when it was $6 got out of one account with profit and a lost on the other. If I would of sold everything yesterday I would of been even in that account. Good luck everybody I didn't want to wait to see what happens after the split. Sad for such an iconic company. Will buy back in after the dust settles. I like the CEO. He has a good track record. GE is just too broken created by Immelt?
"Kevin, maybe I misunderstood Cramer. I thought he said it could go to $50.00/share. Is that what he said? If not please clarify what he said.Thanks"
GE hit almost 8% that is PAINFUL for this Blue Chip... Buy the DIPS?
Charles Schwab platform crashes again. This has been going on for sometime. What a great day to NOT be able to trade. Anyone else using it?
"CEO, Larry Culp is a great hero. Jeff Immelt is a full berger"
Don't Worry...Be Happy! :)
$15 minimum wage not going to be implemented - should soften the inflation fears.
Adding
"12, you are so naughty! come on now, stop teasing"
Wow...there are a lot of people on here that are off their meds and have way too much time on their hands. Who has time for multiple posting in an hour? That's a special kinda crazy.
Can’t wait for more wind deals and for aviation to open up.
Funny how the Culprit changes the game as he see fit. This is a dead company.
Here comes the daily slide !!! Announce that you won’t do the rs and save this
ok ok million times the RS is bad...... so now what ??? tomorrow pre market buy?? would you. I probably will .
Instead of cost optimization: let’s nail the shorties ! It’s time !!! Go ahead GE !!
I just called GE investor relations at +1 617 443 3400 and voiced my concerns. Call the and let them know how you feel about them boxing you out of the future growth in GE with this 1 for 8 reverse split!!Reverse the decision to a reverse split!!
Buy Ge be happy 20 coming
"Your going to get some upside after this, then get out....."
"Boeing collecting orders, 1.3m travelers yesterday and gov giving airliners 15B. Seems at least GE aviation should kill it in future rev."
I was just doing research for electric car drive systems and GE came up as one. So when I heard the reverse split news Thought I would check in on conversations. Anyone know of their situation in the electric auto drive motor manufacturing? May be a positive to think about because I'm always looking at angles for future tech needs. I already checked on the chip side and ON semi is that play.
"high volume of shorts and puts indicate that most are bearish for tomorrow's earnings....The stock has not moved a bit while market and other stocks sky rocketed....we keep our fingers' crossed folks....after 3 months of waiting, Mr. Culp need to deliver bigger than the 3rd quarters. GOOD LUCK TO ALL"
"GE to $14 tomorrow or Friday... and no one knows where Tusa is ? I said I would officially thank him on this board when GE hits 14 bucks, pls give him this message if you see him ... Turin says ""Thank You"", I will thank him again when GE hit $20 bucks this year !!!!!"
"I am still holding my prediction of $16 by March, I am still expecting some amazing news, I am still thinking our friend from Omaha is coming back !!!"
"We all should expect short sellers rushing covering they positions on Monday. Told you, they'll have a lot of sleepless nights in 2019 year. I hope they didn't use margin to short GE lol"
Why is this terd going down? @Nasir low life any idea? Ask your help @Lisa.
"Fortunately for GE, the Boeing 777 engine that blew up was a Pratt & Whitney."
"So literally nothing changed today except Tusa, who has consistently been wrong the last 4 months, said that GE would miss. Didn’t he say that last quarter just before earnings too?"
At least it's not red.......
Who said something about a reverse split?
"Investor day may or may not reveal ""YEAR of CULP' HIS M&A style at Danaher involved many many acquisitions, if so stock will be $25 quickly, like a good Poker player THE Year of CULP has a potential $80 billion in cash too buy a lot of companies"
"Reverse stock split, horrible for long term investors. Would you pay $104 per share?"
ge to 20 by end of day
I'm out!
"The reason that stocks are ‘overvalued’ is that they are getting scarcer, more & more people invest."
MMs cleaning up Jan 15 Leap Call Options.. Buy Jan 15 Put options for strike price $10..
Who (FAA or Boeing) will inspect the airplanes is meaningless to operation.
Could GE start a rally of days in the greenI would love to see it climb over the next few weeks
"Wow, reverse split is a big mistake, look at C after their RS."
"GE RENEWABLE Growth story, GE Aviation headed back to $30Bn rev $10Bn profit, but JPM P!GS are the problem for GE Stock price, under MANIPULATION still.. Even FORD UP 200% from March Lows, GE NOOOT even up 100% from March and 2008 Lows of $6.66"
Did we clear the board members who supported Immelts Pillage? Or are you letting the same baboons approve spending?
Looks like it will hit 12 premarket
How many shares of GE are you currently holding?
"gene nice update I've been sitting on GE 1000 shares I bought back around Dec. 7th 20, and have locked it in a vault, and will look at it 6 months form now, what a great stock."
The report was positive and looks like GE will be up 3%. Patience pays.
$12... now the Algo AI will take over :)
"Is anyone planning to buy Jeffry Immelt's book just published? A short synopsis is in today's news. As hard as he tried during his 18 year tenure, he couldn't get the GE share price down to $4. I don't think our present CEO can do that either. Bring back another Jack Welch PHD (bless his soul) to move share price."
Good Morning to All GE Investors!!! 
buy FORD. winnee
OMO's You think they are buying GE? I'd think so.What are OMO's you ask?Open market operations (OMOs)--the purchase and sale of securities in the open market by a central bank--are a key tool used by the Federal Reserve in the implementation of monetary policy. The short-term objective for open market operations is specified by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). OMOs are conducted by the Trading Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The range of securities that the Federal Reserve is authorized to purchase and sell is relatively limited. The authority to conduct OMOs is found in section 14 of the Federal Reserve Act.
"what i see, analysts raising / reducing tp by 1 dollaron average assuming 13/14 by the end of the yearbased on expected ge performanceinvestors and ge share value were too far ahead of actual ge numbersi dont like rs either, a surprise but not the only reason for the pullbackits the investors decision whether this outlook works for the individual"
"Sold all today took the $ 4,800 PROFIT. wanted to stay long until they stated talking RS..my experience with (rs ) usually turns out bad... Had to move on...Good luck."
no shareholder ever wins when a reverse split happens. Just got F'd by the GE machine
PPS should go down to $ 1.65 or lower before the Reverse stock split.
"Spin it anyway you want ! Reverse splits have nothing to do with fundamentals , growth or any other positives that a company may have .They are negative psychological effects that can play havoc with an investor's mind !"
Support is 6.30get out of this one now....................................
Its a beat!
Huge earnings beat and traders are selling and taking profits on the little pop. That is how much confidence traders have in this company. Take profits whenever you can￼￼
"With GE, do not get your hopes too high. The last time it made $30, investors were promised a windfall. Meanwhile, this what has happened since then:1. Fire sell of assets and disappearance of proceeds2. Price drop form $30 to $6.66 2. Dividend cut to 10 cents 1 cent3. Need I continue.It is all about making deals and selling assets, and making promises. GE has not even recovered from the 2008 economic disaster. But let us sell all assets, have a big old reverse split and magically become like Honeywell."
I work for GE ...we are hurting. Some older guys I work with have lost from 250 to almost 500 grand.
Short start covering nowThere are some buyer showed up too
Are your long portfolio's getting punched in the head repeatedly? Oh my!!
"Good night shorties, sleep well tonight !"
So what is GE's upside with power and aviation about to explode? Buy with impunity.
why little change AH? If RS is bad everyone should be selling. Fewer shares keeps short away . This will hold well no matter how many criticize it.
Panic sell end at 6pm. After that just bullish.
Have you smart pants wondered how the market tanked just when the stimulus package was about to be issued. The American government just stole our money to issue to the Americans to help with their economy recovery. World power at play.
Vote No to a reverse split.
99 % of Aercap shares are owned by institutions....think it will be a marvelous deal for both companies and for institutions....
$12 End of day
"Just saw a news item saying that GE BoD is going to ask shareholders to approve a 1-8 reverse split, to bring the number of shares in line with company capitilization. That would raise share price to over $100. I don't really see the point of such a move. Does the Board think it will improve the company image, make it look stronger somehow? I know it's just arithmetic, but in my long experience reverse splits reflect weakness, not strength."
"People panicking over a possible RS, but the company has been making the right moves and I am excited about the AerCap deal."
"$GE has the potential to blow past $15 like an afterthought. With all the chess pieces in play right now $200+ billion market cap this year alone in not far fetched. $GE to $24 plus this year alone with side order $GE January 2022 $25 calls please, thank you and your all welcome."
Companies that are in danger of delisting reverse split... this is the worst outcome ever for existing shareholders.. you will be chasing this stock the rest of your life to break even after a reverse split.
"Can they reverse their decision to Rev Split? I know a vote will decide it, and to be honest, institutional owners will dictate the decision.Volume is incredible.Talk about an 8bn shares in issue. These last 2 days a significant proportion of that float has been traded. If they that stock available in the market at these prices, they'd probably be doing themselves a favor.Not going to happen"
Very funny for unethical company GE: GE accuses Siemens Energy in lawsuit of stealing trade secrets - Reuters
Do not sell. Don’t want to make money then sell
you know its going up when JJ shorts premarket
I sold most off portfolio today to buy into this and I’m in GE 67.80 percent now of complete portfolio I’m on risk for the biscuit mode and have faith
BYE BYE BYE $12 SEE YOU $11 PER SHARE TOMORROW LOL
"I’m going to leave this right here...You should have seen the trolls jump on my posts when it dropped on earnings day. Now it’s well over the peak on earnings day and these clowns are still here pushing a short position.But when you ask them1. What position are you holding and2. How much have you made or lost or even better3. What fundamentals and or beliefs are you trading on...They simply ignore the questions I suspect because the answers are1. They are not holding a position...they are just angry they lost money on GE a long time ago or are disgruntled ex employees2. They have not lost any money because they do not currently hold a position3. They will not answer this because there is not a single fundamental pointing towards a lower price. They believe that because GE was bad 2 years ago it is still bad. And one time in history has nothing to do with nowI am trading on the following fundamentals1. FCF and profitability is dramatically improving2. The company has resolved the largest liabilities and although there are a few unresolved issues...they are not significant3. Culp has focused on and prioritized the best opportunities and executed4. Covid numbers are dramatically decreasing and travel is going to be a huge upside for GE5. Culp keeps under promising and over delivering6. Even large droves of millennial investors are recognizing the upside opportunity and are coming to the table7. Institutional investors will start jumping back in as the fundamentals continue to improve8. If the fundamentals improve, there could be a great opportunity to bring back the dividends, which would bring back investors that jumped when the dividend was cut.9. GE is well positioned for green energy and the Biden administration will be proving up companies that get on board.You know....fundamentals"
Very disappointed with reverse split!
Strong sell
yay!! let's watch it drop down below 11.... then next week tumble i to single digits... yay!!!!!! good move GE....
Hey JWhy do you delete posts after being replied too? How those shorts at 10.50s and 10.75 and 11.15 working for ya there sonny?Then the one about $23k student loans?

I hope the damn GE board is reading the market sentiment about the disaster of the reverse split announcement and abandons this unwise move. I had such high hopes for GE and then they screw up (again!)
14.5 jump soon.
Might be just a ploy to make the price go down to buy it cheaper then ?

Today Jim Cramer said he sold all his shares of GE too early . I wondered why he never mentioned GE days before earnings release on jan 26 th . The fast money traders were absent on GE before earnings. You have to listen to what they do not talk about. They can not discuss a stock 3 days before they buy or sell ?
The first fib is $11.15 and the weekly has diverged and is way over bought. This won't be a one day sell off.
buh bye 13
The comments about Dr. Ji are simliar to those about Larry Culp at $GE last March. Now Larry is hailed as a hero for saving General Electric.
I have had GE shares for a long time with a average cost per share over $30 . I am hoping the economy will go back to normal within 2 years and I will recoup my paper lose. Good luck to m and many other who are in the same boat as I
trading tip never buy a new 52 week high on Monday Or Tuesday -- the vast majority don't hold up over the next 3 trading weeks -- don't fight the odds
Volume is insane
told u is on its way uppp... buy.buy.buy...up.up. and away.
Yesterday’s short squeeze at market opening gives a taste. Shorties:cover !!!
Not good reverse split get out.
We actually believed Culp was GE answer..
30 billion for whom? dividends for shareholders? probably bonus for the empty suits then reverse split? you you want a 100$ share price earn it
Confirmed momentum play imo. Buy.
GE Board
I sat on the fence for 3 weeks about joining (http://Fairstox.com) for their weekly picks. Big mistake. GE exploded and I completely missed out. Don’t make the same mistake I made. Join them today.
"Based on my information, I see Larry beating estimates (again) and stock moving past $13 and $15 by Q2 earnings report in April. GE is well positioned in Aviation (vaccine deployment being accelerated creating a safe travel space) releasing a huge pent up demand for vacation travel in Q3/Q4, Renewables positioned well with world's large wind turbine (Halide X) and the world embracing renewables, and COVID numbers still globally high, Healthcare pent up demand for daily surgery will explode once the vaccine brings herd immunity to our highly connected planet. If you are on the sidelines come next week, it will cost you dearly to buy in - IMHO."
"Visa, Home Depot to name a few up over 1000% in this 12 year bull market... GE has performed nothing less than pathetically. Bigger problem is this bubble market is ready to pop and it will take GE with it down the toilet."
"Ok, in the face of this late-day selloff, I just bought a lottery ticket. 25 $15 calls expiring Friday for 10 cents/optionshare."
type reverse split GE in Google.. rookies
"You okay, JJ? "
So i've sadly been involved with many reverse split companies and the stats are mind numbingly bad. Typically they go down in price till the reverse split then continue down afterwards. You have to keep buying without looking at the dwindling account till one day the price moves decisively back up and then you can get out with your shirt still on. But only if you keep averaging down and they dont go BK. This said reverse splits are typically reserved for companies with shares below a buck and in a struggling or very competitive environment. Then or of course theres corrupt management. Example Look at FCEL energy two 1 for 12 reverse splits in the last i think 4 years. Sure it popped up to 30 per share recently now back to 16.50. If you bought 100 shares in 1992 when the company first started they were trading at 207.00 per share. You held thats 20.700 invested. Two one for twelve splits now you got 4.16 shares. Ill let you do the math but it over 5000 per share for you to break even. My advice is to wait till after the split and wait more till after it tanks further then consider a long position or avoid this issue all together.If you have strong conviction just make sure you keep adding if your in love here. Full disclosure I hold no position in GE and after this blunder would only play the volatility through options. I took the time to to post this because of my experience with reverse splits. For a time it seemed like I was cursed and every stock I bought would would announce a reverse split then go bankrupt. Most recent example CHK a 1 for 200 RS. Yeah I was in that one to.I hope all make money here.Cheers
Citadel buying shares for their inventory as a major Market Maker. Will sell the inventory to retail investors at a later date. The hearings last week were most informative.
"If it wasn’t the RS bomb shell, with a good day market saw today, And the $31B deal, we would have most likely cross over to $15. Sadly it was ruined. Not expected such a news on such a nice day. But I guess Culp had to say it since it was talked about among the board members. If big cheese shareholders oppose it, it could be canceled. Let’s vote and SAY NEY to RS."
"Another factor that no one is discussing here: The trade war could potentially end under the new administration. If that happens, lookout. The trade war was a headwind for GE in 2018-2019. The market is already starting to put COVID in the rearview mirror. If interest rates don’t rise too much, and the trade war with China comes to an end, I think GE will be/one of the top performing large cap stocks."
Tusa is quite because he got nothing to say.. JPM is still pumping EV stocks ..Watch GE and GM on this front pretty soon !!!!
Hind sight is 20/20. Six months ago you could have gotten GE for about $6. Would have made a tidy little profit.
Could this stock be shorted too? lol...... Please?
"My best guess is that GE will close tomorrow near $11.30 (up 5%). This ""best guess"" is based how the stock jumped the first day of the year in 2019 and 2020. Good luck to all us GE longs in 2021."
So glad I dumped this yesterday at 13.30.
This will get uglyReverse stock split means something wrongBig mistake by Culp.
Literally this move makes no sense. Selling Aircraft leasing business sure ok I understand that but the reverse split makes 0 sense. Day trading is a thing whether GE likes it or not every company from GE all the way to APPL and MSFT experience it
"There are more than 60000 contracts open positions at strike price $12 this Friday. It means many people thought it will close above $12. Well, it looks like market makers want all of them expired worthless. They want GE to be close between $11.5 to $12 this Friday. Thus, don’t bid on short term options. They could let It move above $12 by next Friday if they manipulated."
Larry will be on Bloomberg at 12 noon.
Looks like my $12.08 may be a success.
Tusa set this up so nicely. He’s only good for about a $.10 to $.15 drop with his hit pieces. He made $10.50 calls cheap. Jan 15 is all you need
my interpretation of ge's gain and approval of share holders …today ……….culps action of prioritizing and redirecting goals for the future of ge ......
Good move board !!!! I guess you dont like your share price over 9
"There’s a good Reuters article summarizing expectations tomorrow. My post, with link was tossed. Sorry, in summary. Crazy good news...Payments for engines upon delivery!"
"Another bombshell from GE. As expected, legal corruption at its best."
Goldman Sachs raising the price target on GE to $15.00 extends the runway. I expect a pretty straight shot to $14.25. Clear Skies. V shaped recovery.
Buy the dip.. umm the dip... umm the dip.... and so on.. and on.. and on.. The only way this moves up is when they admit they are wrong and reverse their decision to do a reverse split...Nobody wants it! Do a buy back!! No to 1 for 8 reverse split!!!!

"GE CASH & LIQUIDITY $$100+ BILLION ($40+ BILLION CASH in USA+ $30Bn abroad+ $$25 BILLION Line of credit UNTOUCHED)..GE PAID OFF near $$70 BILLION debt/pension.. GE SPENT $$120 BILLION DISPOSABLE CASH in buying back stock, paying debt, LTC, pension, and set aside other things.. GE IS A CASH MACHINE.. At this rate GE CASH FLOW Will be $$$20 BILLION"
Every state in this country is wondering what would happen to their power grid if they were faced with a Texas like crisis . Guess who they are calling to inspect and improve their grids! GE !!!
Finally broke $12
cool.. -20% in 2 days
General Electric Aviation awarded $111M contract for support of CH-53K
"I think everyone owes a debt of gratitude to Mr. Tusa. With his guidance, GE's stock price was held down long enough to give insightful investors time to get on board at a cheap price."
Go ahead. I'll just buy more. I don't need this money for many years.
"Get out now this is heading back to the $5.00 range, right where it was before the retail investors bailed this company out of bankruptcy!"
Unfortunately somebody already wants to sell 100000 shares at 10.86
10.30 - 10.50 then run up for quarterly financials. Market makers rule when there is no news
"It won’t be until after mid year that this re-establishes a positive P/E due to Q2 2020 kitchen sink.It also will likely get hit hard when the market decides to correct in the next few months or so.However, as long as Larry Culp is at the helm and no other negative macro surprises, I see this as a stealth grower into end of year. Over 100% from this sub $12 price would not surprise me."
"Market elasticity defines the wave forms from which natural stock price distributions are derived, and from this, a probabilistic determination can be surmised that there is a greater likelihood of equal and opposite market energy from hyperbolic to parabolic. Simply put, this is will go down."
Hi all. Why doesn't GE pay a dividend anymore?
"GE waiting to cross the $100B market cap.......heading for the price of $13.26 and a $130B market cap, the level it was prior to the PANDEMIC....................we shall see it cross that level and head towards the $150 Billion CAP very soon..............................target price for that would be $15.55............................. well done Mr CULP...shame on some jack #$%$ analysts who caused pain and suffering for thousands of investors...GE would have been above $20 by now if it was not because of their deliberate and intentional misguiding comments and analysis....."
I would like to see the BoD release an explanation of *why* they think a rev-split is needed. So far they've said the rev-split is being considered. What they haven't said is why this move is even being considered.
bought 2000@12.23; no one every lost any money ever underestimating the lack of my intelligence of the American public!
"Bloomberg just announced that GE now has over half (50%) of the US wind turbine business in 2020.Only Vestas is anywhere near them at 31% in the US wind turbine sales and capacity in 2020.In the offshore wind turbine business GE is definitely already the big winner and jetting ahead in sales and customers. GE has upcoming huge profits of scale. Going forward it has made GE a ""must own"" stock for a lot of index portfolio managers as of today onward.It is the dominant recyclable and environmental stock. GE now has as much appeal as Tesla has - but more going for it in size, diversity, profitability, and overall an awesome well situated company worldwide.It is a dominant industrial manufacturer with plants in over 80 countries and 160,000 employees worldwide..The $20 a share price tag is now low for the year. The stock can easily move a lot more distance.That is why the stock is rocketing upward to new heights....Nobody left to catch GE in the wind turbine business and this ill be the second area GE is dominant in, after aviation."
anyone here know what time earnings will be?
"I suppose GE may go up a bit based on sentiments. But I believe the fair price of GE stock at this time is between $8 - $9. If I have to pay above that for a GE share then there needs be a strong reason that EPS forecast will be a beat going forward. I don’t see any sign of that, in fact EPS for this year was revised down to 15-20 cents. With the sale of leasing business it will affect potential earnings next year. I sold all my positions in GE, 30h shares last week. I will get in if it get back to $8"
"GE has been deeply engaged in China to help upgrade the local industrial chain with ""intelligent manufacturing""."
"We may see a huge market drop next week. Two important dates ( Jan 05 & Jan 06) will be key to the political, future policy decisions in the country... For the next 4 years , if not for much longer. Georgia runoff & Electoral College vote count. Market is likely to have a big jolt..GE could also go down with the market, if there is a huge sell off.Similar to 2000, market could be preparing for a big sell off in January."
Very week stock. Showing no strength at all. Looks abandoned. 10's tomorrow breaking the trend.
Sell the news.... Earnings are already baked in. High likelihood of earnings sell off Tuesday.
yes I sold took a profit now I'll buy back when the smoke settles

"$20/share when air travel gets close to normal, $25- $30/share when GECAS debt is paid early next year."
Only Jack Welsh PHD (bless his soul) could get the GE share price to $4. After doing so in the 1980's he got it back to $60 during his 20 year tenure. Must be his PHD mentality that did the trick. Send Mr. Culp back to school. I think GE would cover tuition. They paid mine years ago. Thanks GE.
They sound panicked!! heading to $5.00!!! Sick 1 for 8 reverse split!!
Tusa Upgrade round the corner?
great stock time for us to pad our portfolios. buy
"Don't forget that Tusa is called a genius and is broadly loved for his GE analysis. At least he is very professional in analytics and finance and GE. It is very strange that GE went so high, but soon it us all over and GE will be $5."
"If you go back to December 10th (roughly $11.44/share) and take the trend from that point to today and invert the trend, GE would be roughly at $12.32. So, without manipulation, its plausible that we could easily be hovering in the 12's. Don't be surprised if GE shoots up and basically bypasses the 11's to play catch-up."
GE on the verge of a potential obesity breakthrough using ultrasound(Google IT)That would be significant given that obesity is the nation's largest health issue
"NetJets, has obtained purchase rights for 20 of its AS2 business jets.The AS2 will be powered by engineered synthetic fuel and can reach supersonic speeds of up to Mach 1.4, or about 1,000 miles (1,610 km) per hour, which is 150% faster than conventional business jets, Aerion said.Production of the jets will begin in 2023 at the firm's Aerion Park facility in Melbourne, Florida, with the first 300 AS2 aircraft planned for the first decade of production, the company said.Aerion's global order backlog for the AS2 is now valued at more than $10 billion.The company said it will also develop a supersonic flight training academy for civil, commercial and military supersonic aircraft in collaboration with Berkshire's professional aviation training provider, FlightSafety International.U.S. startups Aerion, Boom Supersonic and Spike Aerospace are working to reintroduce supersonic passenger travel for the first time since the Anglo-French Concorde retired in 2003.General Electric Co's GE Aviation unit has said it completed initial designs for the new Affinity turbofan engine, which will be used in Aerion's AS2 jet."
"You know something good is about to happen when all the shorties start posting anxious messages on the board. :-) JJ, Niklas, have fun tonight/tomorrow!"
"Maybe the GE innovation center can put some electric engineers on the EV craze. Would be nice to have them get a few patents on improved and evolving technology. After all, doesn't GE stand for General ELECTRIC?"
new into investing wanting advise should I hold or sell bought at 12.28
"Just shaking out all the weak retail holders and back up it will go. Hard to imagine retail buying GME with little value now at over 100.00 and the thought of buying this at a similar price seen as bad. Oh well, you lose"
The Holy S#&$? moment for shorts has arrived! 
1-8 reverse stock split ? really now
Don't look now but GE is trending on Reddit.... it seems that some believe that GE could be pushed to the same heights as GME.... Is it possible tomorrow will show a big upside... the Reddit Herd seems to think so...
hey JJ.....show us your confirm on the trade.
Nice little bear trap! lol
"GE literally owns CNBS, could go on air right now and stop the bleeding. But the wont because they are Egotistical, greedy, Ivy league, insider trading Frauds!!! Retail investors pulled them out of Bankruptcy, and they repay their loyalty by reducing there invested interest by 1/8th. Reverse the Reverse split decision!!!"
Yahoo sensors free speech
Scotty we need more volume
"Volume coming in this morning. Technical indicator RSI is rising and in the bullish zone with the MACD also moving higher, according to stoxline. Looking for breakout at 15.05 for a run up to 17.58."
Breakout to new 52 wk high not too far off...
GE earnings this Tuesday lift off... I'm expecting good numbers and expecting a turn around story.
"Culp is cleaning up the balance sheet. Don't think we'll see great movement in the short term, but this is long term play. Won't move until divi is increased.But hopefully that won't happen until after the balance improves materially."
"Call 617 443 3400, it takes 30 seconds. Leave a message that you and your family oppose 100% to the PROPOSAL of a reverse split. PERIOD.30 seconds of your time to move this stock to $20 in 2021.And buy more share before your message, because we are going GREEN very soon.Stay greedy my friends."
Because I’m happy! 
I was right good short
How disappointing this has become...Things were looking really bright just a few days ago.
New ballgame if we close over $12.
OVER SOLD!!!
GE back to $15 soon.
My only stock doing well today. Let’s go my little beaut.
"GE is a golden egg for holders. People are chasing BLNK for EV charging units. I don't know if holders are aware of the capabilities that GE has already. You can almost bet that you will find GE ""s name on the plugs and receptacles used by alot of the end users! GE is a treasure for sure. IMO"
GE is saving millions and millions with the elderly dying from Covid because now the pensions stop and long term care is discontinued........................
great news
"Amazing how AER is paying GE, GE is falling and AER is rising...."
Sorry.....82 billion in debt....employee pension plan deficits....cannot buy this. Too many other opportunities out there.
I got a feeling this thing is going to blow up. Its been held back for too long.
Good Day to All GE Investors!!!
Smart money got in over the last few days...not letting their shares go till they make some nice returns...Longs will do the same with them.
Uncle Joe is more concerned with making illegals legal than Americans in our country.
"Like I said, a close over $12 was bliss. Buy."
Surprise after hours???
Robinhood Investors will be back to GE in a few days......when they finish their Walk-a-bout. We should welcome them back.
Another beautiful Friday sell off... Any Questions? Flush the GE toilet..
"JPM-Tusa is looking like a very stable Genius, once again."

There are a few Analysts at Apple that have rated Apple a strong sell for the last 5 years.......as Apple has gone up 800%. They will never give up. :-)

The Reverse split is really messing with this stock.
"Just stumped at 13.14-13.20...any uptick, will trigger exit sells?...or investors still trying to figure out this aviation merger.BASICALLY, we gave up the revenue from aviation recovery in the next several years for $26 billion to paydown current debt."
GE can see 14.20+ this week and 20+ is just around the corner with all the great news and the 1.9 trillions is approved over the weekend.
Almost....next stop is Green !
"GE won over F in race to reach the $10 pps level, now they are in race to reach the $14......with tons of good news regarding both companies which one would win this time ?"
I hope JJ makes enough money to get a decent car soon. That 2006 Toyota with the Obama ‘08 bumper sticker is falling apart.
"If you have 10,000 shares like me and I'm dreaming this will hit a newer high let's say I paid 6.00 I'm at better than a double up in profit now .but I wait for the split well my shares go down and I'll never see these numbers again so for me I'll step out and play another day ,take my money and run cause I don't marry stocks especially doing a reverse,,go the other way I'm all in .shows weakness to me !!!!!"
bought april puts on thisliterally free money
is it true that GE will be in the list of wall street bets? ( Reddit)
"BTW: That was a rhetorical question... Bottom line, Longs made a bundle today, earn a dividend in two days as a bonus AND didn't need to trade 1 share to boot!"
does ge involved in nuclear smaller reactors nuclear power? looks like nuclear power must be used to go green. 4 months of each year solar and wind won't work especially during the night.

What is Tusa's PT now?
Up over 5% for the week! Nice job GE!!
"good point, Don't you think this is already priced in."
RAD is one reverse split that got really screwed . 23 billion in revenue 1.2 billion market cap. Short squeeze in progress.
JJ uses all his brain cells to watch and make a nickel on one stock while the rest of us quietly make a penny on 15 or 20 stocks in a diversified long portfolio. Lol
Anyone who is short must be having nightmares!
"Oh no, the stock dropped 3%, let me just sit happy with my 90% I've been riding, ohhh noooo."
GE crossed the $11.62 and headed for the $12 border...new high and higher high.....as said before hopefully this is an indication of a positive trend for the stock and a good descent earning report. Never know GE may surprise investor yet with another achievement this past quarter.....GOOD LUCK to ALL............GE is way behind compare to many other companies thanks to some self center analyst who has gone against all others who say otherwise
"UBS thinks $15, but I think higher. All of their components are revving up even Baker Hughes. $20 is my initial pt."
"Goodbye shorts. Game, set and MATCH!"
2.4% drop with 33 million shares (1/3 rd of the daily volume) traded so far. Rigged Casino!
Going close to 20 today at close
Now all there is to do is enjoy the ride.
I lost about $3000 from GE but I can see that it is going up gain. It is okay now.
"What happened??? All markets in the red and GE gains 3.78%!!!!Best part... We didn't have to buy, sell or short 1 share to gain 3.78% !!! "
Huge Opportunity to buy and hold.. Big Earning Surprise.. GE to $16 bucks soon !!!!Be Long Or Be Wrong !!
"That was fun while it lasted. Clear out of the way, she's rolling back down the mountain."
GE POPPING UP
dividend hike is comming
1 billion shares still a lot of shares. GE wants to make huge profits for strong holders instead of weak traders. This is why the reverse split. I’m holding long for this reason. Valuations will also go up much higher after the reverse merger.
"is not the jet engine, because travel still restricted. but GE is big, other areas they also make cash, the problems is too many shares out and no dividends (that cut many out of the buy) and too big debts, and not in the Wall street list, however with a good management, I think it will come back in few years, may be 15/20 per share, GE is for LONG but by than USD may collpased."
Never buy or sell a stock based on what an analyst says.
I got the option june 18 15$ 65 lots positives
look at NVAX after reverse split

"A return to 2019 levels of FCF and a conservative valuation assumption of 20 times 2019 FCF for GE Aviation would put it on an EV of $89 billion. Altogether, that's an EV of nearly $200 billion for the industrial businesses compared to the current company EV of $142 billion.So What? Places fair value at 20 bucks for GE.... new 52 week high today.Market in turmoil because ashholes senators think what people made last year on the tax returns is what people are still making through Covid.... so you made 161000 last year and then lost your job this year,,, you have 5 kids... big deaL NO THIRD STIMULUS FOR YOU.... but that lawn care business that deals in cash and listed 55,000 in earnings last year gets his...."
Guys Very soon Revese split will be Called OFF and you know what will happen Price will be 90 Without even revers split.
"I don't like the idea of a reverse split 8 to 1, but then investors have no choice but to resign to that change. The number of shares will be reduced to 8.74/8 = 1.0925 billion shares. The new share price will be $14x8=$112. The value of GE in your portfolio remains the same except for the number of shares you have will be divided by 8. Unfortunately, some investors will only look at the number of shares, and when they see their 800 shares are now 100 they freak out. Selling your shares is the least wise thing to do. Just hang in there and the share price could easily double within a year. Culb knows what he is doing."
"Fundamentally nothing have changed with that pending stock split, besides it will be voted in May so this reverse stock split is not a sure thing it will happen. Buying more GE at this price"
So i've sadly been involved with many reverse split companies and the stats are mind numbingly bad. Typically they go down in price till the reverse split then continue down afterwards. You have to keep buying without looking at the dwindling account till one day the price moves decisively back up and then you can get out with your shirt still on. But only if you keep averaging down and they dont go BK. This said reverse splits are typically reserved for companies with shares below a buck and in a struggling or very competitive environment. Then or of course theres corrupt management. Example Look at FCEL energy two 1 for 12 reverse splits in the last i think 4 years. Sure it popped up to 30 per share recently now back to 16.50. If you bought 100 shares in 1992 when the company first started they were trading at 207.00 per share. You held thats 20.700 invested. Two one for twelve splits now you got 4.16 shares. Ill let you do the math but it over 5000 per share for you to break even. My advice is to wait till after the split and wait more till after it tanks further then consider a long position or avoid this issue all together.If you have strong conviction just make sure you keep adding if your in love here. Full disclosure I hold no position in GE and after this blunder would only play the volatility through options. I took the time to to post this because of my experience with reverse splits. For a time it seemed like I was cursed and every stock I bought would would announce a reverse split then go bankrupt. Most recent example CHK a 1 for 200 RS. Yeah I was in that one to. I hope all make money here. Cheers
GE is next .. That’s the word !!
Hats off to Buffet for bailing at $25 per share. A man with foresight.
"Pokrzywinski analist Morgan Stanley:""We believe the March 10 outlook is a catalyst and it sets up a multiyear path to above-consensus FCF of ~$0.90 (per share) in 2023 with solid growth in the core businesses further beyond,"" the analyst said. For 2021, he estimates industrial FCF of 48 cents per share.That ain't bad folks."
ge out at 13.68
"what a Love for GE, I loved it since $6 and will love it till $30. Great company with bright future."
Come on now! We can get there! The first 100 days so far has created a trend upward. We can get the national debt to 22 trillion if we all work together and do our part.
"Call it daylight robbery , lol."
friday starting again like a broken record. just how low can we go on zero shares. thx to all the high school kids with robinhood closing out there 3 shares of ge.
For people who only read headlines: The 737-500 that crashed near Jakarta was a 26-year-old workhorse without the new technology that plagued the 737 Max.
Splitting will dilute your shares value going forward! Ex. after split if stock goes up a $1 well in reality I only gained .15 cents per share! Thanks GE !

"Well I didn't except it to drop today, hit my buy point at 13.65...LOL now I have more. Long even with the split."
GE filed Lawsuit against Siemans... they GE Trade secret info to win 100's of millions in bids on projects...the trade secrets were leaked by projects that GE submitted them to with their bid for the projects...100's of Millions $ in damages if case is successful!

WHERE IS TUSA $5 CLOWN AND HIS MINIONS LIKE JJ N MORE
"I have to admit stock trading is a little irrational at times. If person has ten ten dollar bills and they being asked to exchange their 10 tens for a 100 dollar bill, the traders will get upset and devalue their current holdings because they don't want that 100 dollar bill. They rather end up with 90 or even 80 dollars than the full 100 dollars out of protest of getting a 100 dollar bill. I don't understand the mentality but it is what it is."
"PE of 32 is way high, it was always trading at 16 or lower, and hence the fall to $4 will occur soon."
sell sell sell sell. after reverse splits. value drop again in long terms then you lose money.
"For what it’s worth, Morgan Stanley raises GE PT to $13 from $12; maintains Overweight view. We’ll see. GLTA involved."
1644 ET - Falling commercial jetliner and engine sales accounted for almost a quarter of the drop in all US goods exports and more than half that in capital goods last year. The latest Commerce Department update highlights the impact of falling Boeing deliveries and shipments of GE engines on the broader economy. Aircraft exports fell $27.4B and aircraft engines dropped $18.4B . Aerospace imports declined almost $18B from a year earlier.
"spin off is only reason at this price, culp is a great ceo, previously at danaher... tKe a look at performance during his tenure. one year out, total value after split wk be $20+"
GE’s breakup value is probably $34 per share. Somebody’s going to start talking about it.
Bought a couple call Jan 2022 15 strike
The magnitude of the drop yesterday and today is unwarranted. I think some are loading up on cheap shares/calls in anticipation of a possible upgrade out later today or before market open tomorrow.
wildly over bought every indicator is saying sell off this week should finish the week below 12.50 cycle high has been reached for the month-- best if it opened at 12.71 or 12.72 that would generate max pain for the balance of the week -- Monday is a new month see where it goes after this weeks pain trade
A new day and another loosing GE day..
"What the F'! After 11 down days, we had a $0.15 upday for a change yesterday.. That gain is being wiped out ! MMs in total control Rigging the share price & volume..."
Took some profit at $12.47. Still hold 80% shares.
Even if it goes 10$ I’m not selling.
"GE is a good contrarian play.....Should benefit from increase in interest rates, spending in infrastructures and renewable energy,rotation from tech to cyclical stocks,reopening of economy and air travel....."
"GE Aviation has been awarded a $111.9 million contract with NAVAIR for fourth lot T408 engines to power the U.S. Marine Corps’ most advanced heavy-lift helicopter, the Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion."
"The way people post, you'd think that this company just makes aircraft engines. Aviation is the largest division by revenue, but the next three divisions are nearly as large."
"It seems unusual to listen to 2 hours of the top GE management team describe all the savings and the future of new things coming on board in the next 24 months.They are describing lots of savings on factoring, borrowing, less employment, better management, lots of new innovations coming on line, and tons of new things.... and stillThe forward guidance for Q1 was negative cash flow and for the 2021 year was still .25 - .45 cents or $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion FCF.That is strange to me...."
"GE sold $735M of Baker Hughes stock, and just like everything that has been sold, you ain't gonna see a penny. Where is the windfall promised investors when they were forced to buy SYF shares that they already own. GE was $30 then. Smart investors like Buffet sold and ran with their money."
"Ge ceo has pulled this company out of the ground ,at the expense of closing alot of business and totally revamping there structure, sadly laying of thousands of workers in his path to help them rise from the grave, I hope the reverse split tanks GE karma for all his lay offs to all the workers !!!!"
enjoy the upside today while u can hweheehehehe WHILE WE SHORT TODAY SINCE ITS GOING UP -- HEHEHEHE IT WILL GO BACK DOWN TO $12.50 N WE CAN COVER OUR SHORT HEHEHE MAKE MONEY THAT WAY.. REVERSE SPLIT AINT GOING TO PUSH THIS HIGHER.... BIG GUYS HATE REVERSE SPLIT .. THEY RATHER WAIT N SEE AFTER REVERSE
20 bucks around the corner
Thank goodness I sold out as soon as I heard that GE was planning a reverse stock split . Most Reverse stock splits NEVER work out in the short term and cause the small investors to buy micro shares. It still remains to be seen if the board of directors shoots this down.
"from a technical aspect , the 5 year chart is saying the price target is 23-26 ,,, this is the true target price but ''' talking heads'' on tv are gutless .. sometimes technicals are the only indicator ,, use the '' kiss theory """" trust the science ,, sorry the devil made me say that"
20dollars in a week or 2
It will be exciting to see for a change that GE would hold its 50 cents gain today...Its daily patter suggests it won't..but lets hope it can.........Best of LUCK to all longs
big mistake with the reverse split all you have to do is look at citigroup hasn't done hardly anything it's been years.
Total ripoff!
I love you GE 
Good Day to All GE Investors! :):):)
"I am wondering if Tussa and Inch will come out with some bash article, full of old grudges and what ifs to undercut this run up"

Reduce outstanding shares from 9B to 1B and pay down 30B in debt and shed a so so business. How else would GE do that without crushing their balance sheet or wasting their cash on a 100B buyback?
key resistance 11.50
Have not checked in in a while. Still holding 1000 shares Long.
LARRY CULP & CAROLINA DYBECK HAPPE =Reduced Debt & Great Fundamentals moving forward...GE future is looking bright !
Fly GE fly GE
I bet the stock pushes back up toady AND tomorrow.
"How can we vote ""NO"" to reverse split ? please show as steps"
NOTE: The government is not spend happy! Bernie has direction and insight. Hold out and you'll be working for $15.00 per hour by the Fall of 2021.
I'm looking forward to increased revenue from the GE energy and medical units. The positive cash flow should help offset GE's balance sheet while the Aviation unit recovers. Steady upward growth should will continue with proper management from Culp.
Why some poster put there nose in other affairs please mind your own business Stick to just Ge please try not to be a school teacher
held my breath & bought back in on 3/11 2000 shares @ 12.23 on margin
Back above $14 or down to $11 U-Pick
hang in there with GE. GE could easily be the next Reddit target for killing off hedge fund shorties and all their little Tusa minions. Gen Z'ers love this stock on RH so hang on for a potential upward ride sometime in the near future. Just my prediction.
"most stocks as of late that buffet buys heads south, kr or gold are two."
MR. CULP IS THE NEW JACK WELCH OF GE....BELIEVE IT OR NOT GE TO GET BACK TO THE $60 LEVEL WITHIN A COUPLE OF YEARS AGAIN................THANK YOU FOR THAT
i feel i let my shares go to soon. was just 100 but nice to see how they're turning it around... May try and buy back in on some weakness
"Without earthquakes, California will be the most desirable place to live. Earthquake only come around every 30 to 100 years. Hurricanes and snow storms come every year. This is why California is where humans want to live."
Still undervalued should be 25.00 see glory days return soon.
$45 billion in cash with CULP sitting at the poker table of acquisitions GE stock $25 a no brainer
"Seems GE shares tanked when Culp took over as well as the dividend. I recall he had a $20 something million dollar bonus last year for the stock stay in a range of $10-$13/ps, after the bonus it tanked again. Year 2 looks the same to me except his bonus is up to $40 million plus. It would be nice to see the quarterly dividend exceed $0.01/per share. Maybe if they bought some stock back the share price might go up?"
GE is much better now than a year ago. . it was trading at $13. So anything north of 13 is a fair ptice.
14 of last 15 sessions ge down last 10 minutes of trading day on less than 45% the normal average shares traded per day. it closes always lower than intra day trading unlike a company we are all used to following. this thing flat out stinks of corruption and manipulation. even with good earnings will get beat down below $9 a share. Tusa and his JP Morgan folks pulling strings to let this pig bleed to death.
"Waiting patiently, but growing impatient. What going on with this SP? Should be $15 by now."
frat and Whitney and Raytheon are having serious problems with their jet engines. just glad they're not GE
buy back shares and ge will fly
"Long/short idea, long GE/shortNASDAQ"
Seriously GE is now playing politics?
This is just the beginning of the Democratic socialist experiment that will destroy America
"Is Culp ready to make the big move? Shuffle the deck? , disrupt the space? Release the hounds? I think maybe so. Get ready for a big move higher."
"Call me sentimental, but as a long time small retail investor who recently sold all of my GE holdings yesterday at $13.10. I just purchased 8 shares right now at $12.20, This will be the last time I spend even a dollar on GE or a GE product unless they reverse their decision to do a reverse split."
I'm out reverse switch are never a good thing. in 30 years of trading.
I guess we will be heading to 6$ soon
All the way to $25 a share this year.
"Nothing gives me more pleasure than witnessing shorts & their families living in a Ford pinto nearby a dumpster. Shorts does not contribute any positivity, only and always bet against the economy."

"I was in a leveraged ETF that did a 1/10 RS late last year to put it in triple digits, and of course I sold. But recently looked at stock and it seems they did another RS to put it back in two digits. Is that type of move advantageous to a company?"
Was GE to be sold to China??
"You may not know this, but the 737 Max with GE Engines is the most efficient and profitable plane any airline can fly. For many airlines, the Max will be the difference between making a to of money, or losing a lot of money. Many airlines will do what UAL did today."
Oh man Tusa the Loosa said We were wrong he up grade Ge
Nobody understands this move . Something is very fishy . No way does GE plummet what 15 % last two days without this announcment.
we had a nice rally going!
Looks like we are programmed to open with a bounce of 1 penny!
Rs will keep short out and day trader like jj
"Interestingly, GE is EXACTLY the same price right now - $10.85 - that it was when Larry took over!"
JJ shorted 5000 at 11.95 and 5000 at 11.92. He is losing and trying to make up for his loses. He took down that post when he shorted a lower stock prices. Thanks JJ for educating me on how to NOT lose money.
"Listen short and day traders 4.4 billion FCG in fourth quarter , if Aviation move 2021 Ge will have 6 to 8 billion FcF in 2021 Please do not bet against Larry"
Healthcare will will be critical to the earnings report and I believe it will be tops along with pick up in the other business units.

GE’s breakup value is probably over $35 per share. GE will be hitting on al cylinders for the next two years. The stock will double from here.
wow fast market up or down
This is going to GAP up. All aboard!
"Two or three years ago, GE's stock price would have tanked on the news that JPMorgan set a price-target of $5. Today, the stock is having its best day in a month."
This will hover around at this level until the split and then nose dive again after the split which is very common..
"A tear ago GE was trading at $13 range, now is in a better position financially... 13 after earnings is within range"
powell spoke and now the bond market did too-- no rate hike for 2 years---well the bond market just shoved it up his _____ yield just spiked to 1.72 on the 10-- wonder who is boss !!!!!!!-- now powell can't do anything --panic time
Headed back to single digits. Vwry disappointed in Larry.
If you look at the many other stocks you will see a broad selloff everywhere as the market is down 600 points.A lot of hedge funds are selling because of margin calls...This is a very normal thing in a down day and has zero to do with General Electric.It will rise in a better market.
soaring
heading to $17 and then $20
Now ask yourself:who would you trust to run GE: the clowns on that board or a guy like Larry Culp.This guy knows what he is doing. I wouldn't let the clowns on this board run a pet shop. Don't panic and be patient. Everything will be fine.
"I bought into this company because of Larry Culp. A smart, hands on CEO. One of the few CEOs that didn't slip away from the Board Room to become a milk toast CEO. Larry, the company should earn becoming a Higher Priced Company. It should be Earned. GE has been demolished over many years of two very poorly run, window dressed CEOs. Companies that are about to be Delisted Reverse Stock Split. GE should earn their oats and you should earn your stripes. This is a Horrendous Idea. Your too anxious for your accolades and your position with Tech ""Elites"". Your shares should be bought back with the company proceeds.You don't get to grab the trophy the easy way by crushing the folks that put you in this position."
"Although the earnigs tomorrow and the day after may be great for the AMAZON and Chipole, after their move GE may move higher, but by the end of next Friday no this friday GE will see 10.80. Anyway there is resistance at 11.33 to 11.43. In the next few days KUKR which shared earlier could make a move from $1.26 to $1.5. Back ip the truck."
GE is going to do a R/S there goes your dividend after the split this will sink like lead on water
CNBC today crazy off the charts pumping -- the Fed and CNBC have a perfect record of never seeing or calling a bear market -- according to both they never see it coming
My math of the value of that division of GE vs the the total vale of GE with and without it comes to about $1.50 drop in their stock price from $14.00 dollars. That making it $12.50 of course. But then you have to figure in the money they are getting payed for the sale which makes it more than likely somewhere right here.
Not doing a thing
50% of shares held by institutions. They will not approve this RS. Karen F. from CNBC thinks GE's Management made a mistake and they will abort the decision.
The smartest short now is the one that covers the soonest. 
Here comes inflation. Seems BofA thinks that would be good for GE. uh huh
Needs to test the neckline of the H&S pattern next. mid 10's
GE is still my favorite bottom fishing stock for 2021. I think they are on the crab........and closing in on the Honey Hole.
This could trade 500million shares today and drop big!!! Reverse the decision to a reverse split!!
"IMHO, all the stockholders should vote down the reverse split. I am going to vote down for the reverse split.Larry Culp is doing right things but this reverse split is just bad idea and wasted effort at this time. It is bad optics from shareholders point of view. I understand over longer term, it would not make much of a difference as EPS and other metrics will not change but in general, reverse split is done by companies which are struggling. Let's hope voters vote it down and Larry and the board see shareholders point of view."
$16 on the way.
RevSplit will prevent it from becoming short squeezed like that other company we've been reading about lately.
GE moving with Oil Price (Baker Hughes ) ...
"GE got an upgrade after ""following fcf deep dive"" -- stock goes down. Amazing."
"It seems like any time it has taken a dip like this, within a week it has recovered and is back up"
Andrew Cuomo touched me too..........
Today we can say it again....Good Day To All GE Investors !!! :):):)
just shorted it today easy money from here - thanks for pumping it into my short zone--

"Well it’s Saturday and GE pps is still trading below $14. You know the price pps the stock was trading the day of the analyst meeting when the RS was announced. It’s funny to me to think that people think think this stock is going to $16, $25, $30 this year. I guess we’ll see. There’s not going to be any additional new news when they report 2Q results. That has already been baked in."
What's the real reason for the reverse split that GE is not telling us?
"Airlines are in a slump and leaser of planes will not be able to generate returns,,, blah blah blah says the naysayers who wish to bank on pessimistic views while they secretly accumulate... and yet the Airlines are on buying sprees... but no pessimistic analysist will tell you this...Southwest (LUV) is reportedly close to a deal with Boeing (BA) for a potentially huge 737 Max order as the carrier looks to refresh its fleet. Boeing stock cleared a buy point. Airplanes need Engines... GE Aviation supplies them... and maintains them... Bleeding is not easy, but it does heal,,,"
"To the Moon, Alice!"
Adding to my position.Buying more GPK too.
Loading up and hoping for a big run up this year and into 2022
GE is proposing a 1 for 8 reverse stock split. Not sure I like that...it means we will each own 1/8 the amount of shares at a correspondingly 8x higher price...from my experience stock in companies with reverse stock splits don't fare as well as if the stock were left alone. Anyone have a different view of this?
"My opinion is that it will take a steady climb in travel industry for GE to climb into mid-teen share price, and that will not happen until year-end....and into 2022 as vaccine and possibly secondary booster shots (COVID-19 variants) are administered at a global level. A further boost will come from Canada/US clean energy government funding, which GE renewables/GE Energy will benefit from.I am long and willing to wait another 12 -18 months...patience will be paid...don't care about day-trading."
GO GE!!!!shorts: AMC 42% / VXRT 30% / PLUG 14% / NGA 4%
Next Stop
"Such good news over the last few months and then they go and announce they want a 1:8 reverse stock split. These never end well. Short term, it's going to hurt GE's valuation. Long term, it will probably shake it off as air travel comes back and GE Aviation starts ramping up production again."
"3 hrs ago I posted asking ‘why’ is the r/s such a horrible move and cannot get a response. Can anyone here explain why board of dir would vote for a move that inevitably moves their stock price lower?? R/s forgot priced stocks obviously is a move to avoid delisting, but this is not the case here so I must believe th they are acting in best interest of share price.....let’s not forget they own many more shares than anyone complaining on this board. Again, can I have a logical reason for this outrage??"
It is difficult for the market to ralley with the TNX moving to 10.93. Expect the FED to adress this issue on Monday for this ralley at the biginning of the month to manifest. My plan did not pand out as I expexted yet I remain positive that I will bexabkecto buy GE at a net cist of 10.30 by next friday if the 40 puts that I sold at 21 cents are excercide if not I will keep that money. Just a way for me to manage or define risk. Only 81 stocks move higher out of 600 at this time and the VIX is at 32.13 it was at 22 one yhe down turn started back Wednessday. I will doect a ralkey next week. I hope this not the buble wich I espect to burst some time in at thecend of February.
hahahahahahaha JP Morgan target GE price GE $5. I don't care and pay no attention. Buy buy buy buy buy
"The big money got in below $8.00 per share. This is just a short 3-4% pull back off the high. Once this is over, look for the stock to quickly move into $14 range. (provided that the democrats don't trash the entire market...which may happen)"
Gotta love the BA Max 737 jet orders. The way the competitions engines have been experiencing issues as of late they would be silly not to opt for the GE made engines. RollsRoyce trying to fix its turban blade issues.GLTA especially the longs.
"GE is going to end up like C (Citigroup) after the RSIn early 2009, C was the most actively traded stock. It had risen from $1 to just over $5 when they announced a reverse split. I had made a bundle trading it and selling option premium. When I heard about the RS, I sold my entire position. The RS ruined the stock. The stock has barely risen above my sell price of 5.30 (53.00 adjusted for the split) after all of these years."
"Yes, up too fast - will see."
Tusa is now 2.5x below market.#justsaying
Will their dividend remain the same after the proposed reverse split?
You Robinhood people are not Sticking it to the Man by selling your GE........you’re actually handing it to the Man. The hedge funds that are taking your shares are all laughing at you from their vacation homes in the Hamptons.
600 call contracts from June to Jan 2022 and counting
Overwhelming debtUnion profit drainChina offering to buy Jet engine division and all facilities for debt forgiveness. China moves their assemblymen into facilities to reduce high labor cost. Wind turbines of all types fail....batteries fail in cold weatherTHANK Goodness Capital is gone...but left a trail of Debt and tears that shareholders are stuck with. The only other mammoth business with more debt is the 43 trillion in government debt and adding daily. Im afraid. When does this Madoff scheme go kapow?? Some say April...some say never. I say maybe Gov. Bonds for a while. Yikes
Attention: This elevator is going DOWN!
Not till flying resumes GE will remain in this position. As soon as most people are vaccinated and news of travel starts to echo GE will start moving up in decent chunks of money and dollars at a time. By this summer when tourism starts GE and BA will fly and GE should be above $20 for sure. Hang in there and do your dd. Good luck
B Bands too wide for this to move up so it has a destination move under 12
"I see the logic of GE selling AerCap the GECAS portfolio for $26 billion in cash to pay down debt - but perhaps the $24billion debt is really all or most of of GECAS and GE Capital debt ..Then all the deal would be worth is the 46% of the AerCap ownership. That would be a lot more similar to a 50-50 merger with AerCap being the survivor.Or perhaps the deal includes GE feeding AerCap new business when GE needs to finance an airplane engine.If Culp really sold Biopharma for $21 billion with no strings attached, and if Culp sold GECAS for $24 billion and retained 46 % ownership with no strings attached - then he sold a $3 billion Biopharma yearly sales and a $5 billion GECAS yearly sales for only a total of around $8 billion yearly sales for a payment of about $45 billion (21 + 24 billion = $45 bilion) .and the rest of the empire (airplane, renewables, health, power) is still whole.That would be a very swift deal in my opinion.The only problem is we do not know what was included in the deal and GE may have some strings attached to take the sweetener out of the actual deal."
14:25:19 Should GE Try To Acquire FuelCell Or Plug Power In 2021? SMHOf course they should since neither makes any money at all. They will fit right in
"Like I've said before at this current price per share $GE is dirt bottom cheap, buy as many shares as you can afford meaning money that won't be needed to pay bills, put food on the table, etc. Yes there will be pull backs on share prices and advancements also. Even if the stock were to get approved for the reverse split, the every common blue collar worker can still purchase fractional shares and that's done with Tesla, Berkshire, Amazon, Priceline, Zoom etc, you name it and you can own a piece of America."
pressure building again on the number 13 dam can't hold for long- massive sell orders below 13 market makers setting to profit from the coming plunge - you can't stop it -- you can't stop a train you got to let roll on-- down she goes

"The 100's of millions of shares sold last week were scalped by a big, big investor. Should we soon expect an announcement on whom?"
2021 will be great year for GE.
at current loss next week your 1-8 reverse stock split will have a new price of $17.00
GE earnings... sell the news
"The reverse split does not show confidence on part of management,they do not see the price moving higher without financial engineering.it seems the new CEO has no idea how to turn around the business except through a financial trick called reverse split. GE still depends on old ideas of running businesses if you fail resort to financial engineering, innovation and quality control and new ideas too much for their small brains"
"If people do a better job holding their shares, place higher limit orders when selling, and stop using “stop limits” the craziness like yesterday will subside. It’s just they love to sweep the price for cheap shares, before moving higher. You can’t blame them, it’s like taking candy... from babes..."
At last seeing some light! But still running on only half the coils...
Where is the news about GE partnering going after the new Boeing Hornet jet fighter engine for the new F414E fighter jet for Canada?
"Below 10 is the first fib. 9.65 then 8.94, then 8.23 and a gap to close around 8."
"I am predicting GE to cross $14 and hold level.. I am still holding my projection of $16 bucks with more good news and more upgrades. Sit back and Enjoy the ride, the GE ride !!!!"
737Max back in the air and GE continues lower... amazing
Markets turning red.......everyone is selling so they can buy GE
I thought GE will be rocking today. Oh well.
target price of 13 is half of what it should be imo
"Like I predicted, when there's an issue with a Raytheon engine:no big deall, and the stock even goes up. When there's an issue with a GE engine...SLAMMED"
GE options are very at a very attractive price.
Days like today make me regret muting JJ.Also...where is the clown that kept hitting me up when the price dropped on earnings day.How are those short positions feeling todayAsking for a friend
Hats off to the Robinhood investors who have made GE a favorite stock pick for the last 6 months!
"The SPY will have difficulti above 381 and if it dive to 370, look out. best be all on cash before the melt down. I hope the spy clear 381 and can not imagine going down to 370. I just do not like the odds. There is going to be a much favorable market after march and april specially come summer and the world will have are better outlook and experience on how the pandemic begans to go away. it us only my opinion, to much soeculation and I know bkame little me."
"Ok Larry, CNBC giving you another chance to clarify and talk up the stock now!"
It’s a good day for our #HaliadeX. It has officially received its type certificate from DNV GL for its 13 MW rating. A single spin of the most powerful #offshorewind turbine in operation today can power the equivalent of a US home for an entire day.
figures GE just got upgraded again
Seeing lots of desperate posts from shorts... Stop worrying...you can stop the losses and get in on the next leg up. It doesn't have to hurt so much...just accept it.
"winning lawsuit after close on friday ,should move stock over $12.25 this week, as it was a big win, next Culp move another m&a deal where acquisition will add a good amount to bottom line"
Who has GE beating earnings?
I vote no on the reverse split. They should do share buy backs instead.
On its way to 500mil shares and major sell off. Expect really heavy volume towards the close!!! Pooched!
"GE Investor meeting:March 10, 8AM EST (before the bell :) )Registration: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/2n7ucb9jEnjoy - GLTA!"
GE price dropped near $11.5 again. It is time to accumulate some more shares around $11.5.
"Pay a dividend. A dime special at least, if not a permanent 0.24. C’mon man!! All that money and we get an 8/1 reverse slap?"
typical new high action- hit it early in the week then sell off to close the week out down
Ge broke through support at 12.22 and tested 12.19 and buyers came in and bought the dip. Spiked up to 12.57...just a guess someone loaded up on March 15 calls in the hopes a SW deal or some other news worthy announcement is made...just a guess. It could also be a hedge fund buying in before a news announcement?
Can someone please share with me if there is something positive with the 1 for 8 reverse split? Trying to understand why they would do that. Please don't be sarcastic. Just trying to understand management's reasoning.
You Dopes waited another 3 months on earnings to either lose or gain .30 cents... And your still trading lower than a year ago..
It's funny how travel and hotel stocks are rising as if people are going to have the funds to travel amidst rising inflation.
Has anyone heard of a company called OZSC they apparently just got a contract building power back up systems for NY and they are going to us TSLA battery’s to do this
Too bad the management killed the great upward momentum with an unnecessary move.
Once we break $12.00 next stop $14.00
Haven’t heard about GE’s insurance liability for a while. Any clue?
Don't worry GE investors I got your back
"In a reverse stock split, companies trade a fixed number of existing shares for a smaller number of new shares—keeping the value of each investor’s holdings the same. The result doesn’t affect the value of the company, just the number of shares outstanding and the price of each one.Think of it as exchanging 10 dollar bills for one $10 bill. The total value of your investment is unchanged, but you have fewer bills in your pocketSTILL, I WILL VOTE ""NO"""
Wow!! GE is up 29 percent in 2021.
"Is it wise for Ge to raise dividend . Many more investors will jump in , but maybe that’s not so Swift ?"
I'm in at $6 and Long with this. One of my favorite companies.
Could be a nice pop due to the CFO's presentation tomorrow.
Not everyone is so pessimistic as this board. two target price raises today: * GE : Cowen and Company raises target price to $10 from $9 * GE : RBC raises target price to $15 from $13
"Tusa vs Culp? So far, Culp is winning. Buy."
"This really should be green today.....manipulation. Oh well, in a month it will probably be at $14."
I think they just proposed it so that the stock will crash and they can buy cheap. They probably aren’t going to do it
American Airlines put their 737 Max back on schedule for New York to Miami route. Another boost to GE Aviation.

"Despite macro odds Mr. Culp pulled ahead squeezing every cent of profit out of GE. $4.5bln industrial FCF GE well ahead in the turnaround.

See you at $16!"
"change of plan, will skip a day, more of the same tomorrow, options expirations. will go down at the close tomorrow and on the fisrst of February to beginning ralley at open on tuesday. the down turn at close day is not that meaningful. market opens higher tomorrow and continue with a plan once again to go down about 11 to 12 and again down on monday to rally on tuesday through thursday and then the 10% correction the rest of the month."
"everybody on this board is wrong reverse stock split is just playing bad business. bad business. can I see it can I say it over and over again bad Business by GE if this go through. if anything they should have got the share price up to 40 or $50 and split two to one what a joke I had 40,000 shares and sold last week and 30 years of trading reverse stock splits get you nowhere"
Thank you for the cheap shares. More analysts upgrading this morning. Buy.
Trading like its waiting on something. Not super understanding. If someone has any insight that’d be awesome!
"One thing for sure, Larry Culp is has positioned GE for growth. 2021 will be about growth with power in the lead. I surmise their fielding turbine orders the best seen in a decade."
"GE CASH & LIQUIDITY $$100+ BILLION ($40+ BILLION CASH in USA+ $30Bn abroad+ $$25 BILLION Line of credit UNTOUCHED). GE PAID OFF near $$70 BILLION debt/pension..

Over 12 with lower volume than usual and o day Dow was flat... very encouraging
Love my Ge from 6

At best a $80 stock post reverse split
"Tuesday earnings!$2Trillion Green Infrastructure?Any leaked information should be in the hands of deep institutional investors. They may have Larry’s computer bugged. I’ve noticed over the years good news pops a stock about two days prior to public release. If you want to buy do it early, or wait for a sell off. They learned a long time ago, to always have the best intel."
Here comes JJI’m guessing he says he took a new short position at 13.34 and is now officially killing it lol
It was CNBC everyone gave it a buy with price target between 18-21 in 2021
a good day for GE
"I AM NOT BUYING ANYMORE Stock even if good undervalued plenty, this is why. Every stock I bought last 20 years has been severely CRASHED multiple times, and SEVERELY UNDERVALUED, even currently, GIANT CROWN-JEWEL OF AMERICA GE. Why would I trust and invest more if this is how selectively they target and severely punish/deprive a little guy, even if it means hurting a giant national crown-jewel.. All I can say is, respect to the powers that are in play, who rig and control the market, ONLY PRIVILEGED, ENTITLED are rewarded, even if they are addicted gamblers.. Count the positives in life, forget the injustice, don't let it bother you.Every Aviation up 200% to 400%, yet GE with strong mountain of cash, near monopoly in their every field, high margin businesses, is severely UNDERVALUED, not even up 100% from it's 2008 lows, March lows $6.66.."
That's a nice looking 1 year chart.
Longs assemble!!!
"Is Culp planning on going short? If so this is a great plan. ""similar number of shares to similar market cap companies""? So when the market cap falls in half after this rev-split, will they do another 1 for 2 rev split?"
nice update
"This run is over if you ask me, to rich for me. The SPY gad a good run. It can go higher but I rather wait for a pull back. GE should folliw alone with the SPY."
"Turbine generating power , 737 in the sky, AI in health sector, EV coming ..."
Analysts don't want to be left behind. Seems a plethora of upgrades. Buy.
"If you want to ""suggest"" a reverse split, then why not comment on plans for a healthy dividend that will follow the much larger share price? This is why the Board needs to be sued (class action or the like) immediately. They threw a dangerous ""suggestion"" out there with no safety net."
I don’t like the high volume yesterday. Looks like a reversal day. It was a lousy training day for the stock even though it closed higher. ￼￼
When market is red and GE shifts to green pre-market....she ain't look'n good for shorties.
Glad i did not sell last week after reverse split news ...i still dont like the split and will vote against it ...
S&P new highs and GE?? Like always
Stop the reverse. Get the reddit crowd to fight it.
Reverse split is a bad idea. I say no to the vote
"wow.... what is JPM/Tusa's beef with GE (reaffirmed the $5 target today)? #$%$ off his leaker is gone? No analysis can justify that against a $400bn+ backlog. .... definitely not shorting the stock, so can only be a manipulation to suck up shares."
Show me one example where a reverse split was good for stockholders.
Back to the same drip lower... GE. Rinse Wash Repeat
"GE sues Siemens in regard to stolen trade secrets causing nearly $1B liability, This should be a positive thing for GE today; however, the stock is down...wondering how is that all making sense ? GE should be up at least $1 today just on the this news alone..."
Really looking forward to the next earnings report! What is the right call option to buy for it? JAN 29 $11?
This will open $13 tomo you will see
"United Airlines said on Monday that it was adding 25 planes to its order for Boeing’s 737 Max jet, bringing its total to 180 in the coming years, and that it had sped up the delivery timeline as it seeks to position itself for the expected recovery in travel."
Four stages of Reverse Split.1) Denial - It's good for the company and shareholders.2) Anger - Why didn't I sell when I had a chance.3) Depression - It's going to take many years just to break-even.4) Acceptance - I got screw by this company
But Tusa said ROFLMAO ! Imagine if he did not luck out with Covid and Max ?
Beware the HUGE POP after earnings!
Don't Worry...Be Happy!
I no longer have GE stock. SEC should look into Tusa and J.P. Morgan and make sure there trading is legal.
Lets be realistic about this stock it will be in the upper 20s within 2 years
SHORTED MORE THANK YOU GE FOR GIVING THE CHANCE TO SHORT U ABOVE $12 HEHEHEHE LOL
"Reverse splits are like the prevent defense on football. They prevent the winning team from winning. Hence, GE's RS will guarantee the stock price will reverse."

Will EU and US regulators allow #1 & #2 in the jet leasing business to merge?
GE is like Apple. You own it and don't trade it. GE is a staple in the US and into every facet of our lives. We need to support this company because GE is America's company. Very old money owns GE and it time to put the squeeze play on the non-believers. I'm calling my friends at Reddit...lol.. Let's see how much people are against this fine. long established company. Or would you rather own something like Game Stop....duh..no brainer here.
980k block at top of move
The catalyst for the ralley may not come until monday next week...one could be the FED lining up to provide speeches next week during tbe secion. Or GE gets a major contract like the one yesterday.
"Reverse stock split's regardless of the corporate reason more times than not are sign's of management desperation, usually to avoid delisting, but in GE's case it's cloudy why you would do it. Have been a GE investor for decades, but won't stay through a reverse stock split. Personally have never seen a reverse split benefit Investor's. To be voted on in early May, Vote the Split down, along with no management confidence."
Hahaha what a cover in the last 2 min. Tomorrow will be a green day as well as it is a Friday and more shorthand needs to cover.
"GE is going to be the powerhouse of renewable energy and maybe Plug, Fcel and Bloom etc will be out there in small portions in the wings."

"--Analyst Actions: Zacks Downgrades General Electric to Neutral From Outperform, Keeps $12 Price Target"
if you think ge is worth 12.50 then 1/100 or 100/1 split or reverse split is meaningless. people shouldn't be investing if they think any kind of split has effects the value of the stock. if you dont think it's worth 12.50 then dont buy it.
"GE just keeps hanging around 100billion market cap. Stock could break either way. Take your pick red or black, or banker or player!"

"In my experience, short-term, a reverse stock split is BAD. Long-term, who knows?"
just imagine what this is gonna look like on a market down day.....
Not sure why people aren't all over this stock . Will be $40-$50 next year .
If there are any teachers on this board.... GO BACK TO WORK LIKE EVERYONE ELSE
good News today 
made well with GE.sold out... good luck with
"Seems like a gift to institutional investors that told Culp they wanted to see a higher, less volatile, share price. These same institutions will be buying down here as they price drop scares out the small retail investor. For those holding options, they will all adjust with the reverse split. For me, it's good as I needed the SP to slow down so it wouldn't overrun the short end of my spread (Jun & Sep 15 strike)."
what happen if market start going down again.. after reverse split $80.. will come down to $60.. remember acb...
"hmm a lot of bearish sentiments around this stock. I actually got in today at 11.45. had to sold SOME of my BB (initial investment) and bought GE. Why? because of strong cash flow, great management and most importantly, their renewable business. This stock price to me looks like a real bargain. This isn't a ""no-name"" company, they have been around for such a long time. I also like the decisions they're making to weather the storm and amidst of all the pressure from the pandemic, they sailed through it just fine. Although a ""slight"" hit on their financials, at least they have a plan path moving forward. Invest with confidence and analyzed your thesis. Just don't succumb to negativities of other people just because they told you otherwise."
So AER is up but not GE. Time to vote no on RS and no on BOD!
Remember GE Earnings day? Was up 1.15. Finished the day .30 was beautiful..

"GE will benefit from a united government - pandemic management will lead to earlier air travel, better healthcare with ACA being extended and clean energy. All GE sweet spots."
13.20 delayed. I think we can hit it but tomorrow!
"Timber, look at that HUGE drop BAGGIES, back to single digits. GE to come in low on earnings tomorrow. GE scratching for cash. That is why some Baker Hughes shares were sold Friday. Just enough to help line Culp and his cronies pockets."
Ouch!!!
No end of year selling! Very good sign for jump in stock price in 2021.
"For those posters (an many sound like children/kids not very serious) that do not have a clue what is happening - read read read .

Why is this dropping?
Great report this morning p'oed someone big. Only created a great buying oppty imo.
How Low can you Go!!!
Lots of tech investors will be plowing their profits into GE. Big year in store for us longs. Buy.
GE doesn’t want to be another AT&T.......GE wants to be another Danaher. You should be buying this dip.
GE BAGGIES
Buy or miss out
Well it's a good short
waiting... when do we buy back in ...... don't care about a RS either way like sandy wrote fundamentally Ge is the same

can someone remind me why I'm holding onto this stock. It's been 21 years since broke $50. it will never reach this price again. Not in my lifetime anyway.
Never buy GE.
Nigerian air force passenger plane crash kills seven peopleIs this another GE engine failure? SMH. Aviation is doing great.
Remember when Tusa said GE was cooking the books and would make Madoff look good over a year ago. I believe he was on to something.
"I’m not sure what these high paid analysts do, but my experience is they are good predicting yesterday’s weather. They upgrade after the stock goes up and downgrade when its down. They are selling and telling you to buy and buying when they are telling you to sell. I guess we will see next week..."
"GE's stock is in accumulation and needs to break $12...then off to $15 in a hurry. Requires a catalyst to upside trend to $12.26. If it breaks @ 12.30 then the next stop is $13.26, $14.68, $17.87 plus. GE was a $55 stock at one time."
Boeing wants GE engines on its planes. That’s very good for GE. GE makes Jet Engines.

How much do we go up after earnings are released?
A day to add long calls. :)
Buffet dumped GE at $25. He is the oracle.
Which one of these engine's blew up - General Electric
12.55 and the market is down imagine what it will be when the market is up!! 
Unfortunately this is the time to sell. Buy back later at 8$. News coming

"Out peeps, had $17 2022 calls, but with the prospective of a reverse split...not bashing wish you all well. But I think Culp might be pumping the price to do an offering to further reduce the debt. Cheers!"
"Well, whoever sold yesterday at 14.42, they look like a genius."
the floor has no limit on this turkey... even with reasonable quarterly won't even approach its 30 day high of $11.78.. too many shares to dilute this equity and too many large institutions willing to dump and run as soon as they can. renewable energy has no net returns for any company a lot of pixy dust and wishful thinking. every large deal announced any renewable energy partner has omitted the bottom line of: Show me the money!! never once do the stories express any added value to the earnings. WHY cause it brings no net value.
"After RS, share price will be around $100 and GE can begin to negotiate better deals to offload the so called core assets. I think. Cannot see any other good reason for RS. Eventually, GE becomes a holding company. Holding GE shares will then be like buying into a mutual fund, less the fees."
GE prime candidate for one of those Reddit short squeezes on RH. run Tusa right out of business - where he belongs IMHO! go longs go!!!!!!!
$14 tomorrow$15 next week
Back to the 11's really soon. Reverse split is a real kick in the teeth for longs.
"High frequency shorts now asking themselves, what did we do? Buy."
I just learned that Thomas Edison was the cofounder of GE. How awesome is that? More than a century old. Viva GE. It will eventually climb up to $60 someday in the near future. It got the back bone to get there. Strong Buy rating will start coming soon.
This stock will still double. Pent-up travel demand will be the hottest news in a couple of months.
That's one way to make GE shares worth $100. Shareholders don't seem to appreciate it though.
Chart pattern looks great! We’re still going to 18
"11,000 mil share buy at buzzer"

What happened to all the GE I love yous
reverse split isnt good for exisiting shareholders will buy back in when its done
"To short GE now is the same as rushing into a flaming inferno with a bucket of water....Only a total fool with a death wish would short a company as large and strong as General ElectricIt matters little if they have incredible 4th quarter earnings.Investing is a longer period than 72 hours in the stock market.Patience and clear direction will pay off.The only direction over the next 12 months for GE is up, up, and upJust like the Colonial Penn Insurance's commercial at the three most important things buying insurance are $9.95, $9.95, and $9.95"
I see $102.00 after the reverse split.
Lots of desperate shorts on here. Could see a nice squeeze by EOW. Target of $17
How the hell does a company with negative cash flow per share have a stock price of $53 and is rising today while this stock which has positive cash flow per share is tanking simply on the news of a reverse split. Maybe it's the merging with a company that has that negative cash flow. Who eff knows really. This stock has been taking a beating since 2017 and it's unrelenting. The numbers aren't making sense.
"This is a snail riding on top of a turtle . ￼￼￼￼Let’s face it , everyone benefited from the market except GE and WMT investors ."
Some folks see this going to $4 but I'm not so sure that will happen.
great to see it close above 12 at EOW.... consolidation above 12 the next milestone and then nice stead March to 20 thru 2021!
.......how about dividends.
You guys saying the proceeds of the 735m sale of Baker Hughs is headed to a rabbit hole and shareholders won't see a penny don't get what Culp is doing. He is shoring up GE's balance sheet by prioritizing debt reduction. The cash will pay off debt and yes you as a shareholder you will benefit! GE aint no SPAC fellas. You won't get rich over night. Its an investment!!!
"Reverse split puts share price at over $100 at current price. Too high in my opinion. One way or another, price will drop. That is why I sold. If it drops to $50-$60 post split or $6 -$8 presplit, I am back in. Otherwise I move on to other opportunities. GE has never been investor friendly."
Short your last chance Cover and cover Ask jj Do not bet against Larry
Can anyone give a source that Buffet is buying GE?
"GE stock is on the verge of breaking out! There will be a lot of resistance on the way to fifteen, buy on the dips."
GE will always be THE loser in your portfolio...if it goes up a bit GE is coming out with News and it goes down immediately...sick company and black spot in my investments....
"GE is trading on emotion and disbelief. Soon reality will set it. For example, reasonable minds are asking, after reverse split, what next? Issuance of new shares, maybe. Nobody knows."
yes the green ball bounce.... sweet
"It is NEVER a good signal when a company performs a reverse stock spit and in this case there is NO reason for it what so ever unless GE is hiding something! I will be selling all I have at a 14 price a.s.a.p. I have held stock in 3 companies that did reverses and all 3 went bankrupt! Not saying that is the case here, probably not, but I want no part of any company doing reverse splits."
Reverse split will drop stock by at least 30% and then the high share price post split will case it to go down more.Culp and the board are not interested in shareholder value for YOU...only for their future minted options.
"Huge volume as well as the price gain, this morning, which portends well for the rest of the week; other things being equal, of course.Go, GE!Good luck, longs."

I think GE is in a great phase right now. Looking ready to run and CEO looks great. BTW I work for GE and am confident this CEO is focused on the balance sheet and creating cash flow for the future. I scooped up 20k more Friday thinking this will hit $16 soon
That person claiming GE is going to $4 has been very quiet lately; do you think they are still alive??
In 5k shares @ $12.24 Long TermLooking for more @ $11.99
yesterday they loved GE today they forgot why....go figure
"I think GE stock was looking for a reason to take a break and breath ; other wise the news of RS which has not even been approved would not have made it to go down. Hopefully some people took advantage and loaded more shares. nothing has happened to be bad, Ge will also pay down debt and be in better fianancial position anyway.................now we just have to wait and see what's next....Good Luck to all"
Manipulation in play !Unreal!
A 1 to 8 reverse stock split? I don't see how that will help matters. Perhaps someone can enlighten me.
"again opportunity under $13,just keep adding, next stop ,$17-$19 in a couple months,just Culp being Culp and building war chest to over $45 billion,a large acquisition in the next few weeks"
"Well my sell order at 12.05 just hit. in at 8.05 avg - out at 12.05. not bad, but no point in hanging just to see it fall another dollar over the next few weeks. There will be no upside in this stock for the foreseeable future so no reason to be in any longer. Good luck longs."
Run GE Run ... Starting Next Week...
"IMHO and my not so crystal ball, I believe GE will not only reach $14 but will maintain $14 by March 14."

sold @ 11.68
"Have you noticed that all the businesses sold off by GE are doing great - SYF, BKR, WAB, etc. Only those getting shafted are long term holders of GE."
ge will be over $20 soon. and by soon i mean 6 months
JJ's reaction to $GE finally holding onto the price point of 12! Next step is 24!
Relax people! ....MM's letting institutional investors load up at the lowest price they can bring this down at.Will trade higher when this is all said and done for the next step up.
"So Bloomberg article, ""GE Sinks as $30 Billion Sale of Jet Lessor Fails to Impress""... talks about the drop. No mention of the negative outlook from the talk of a reverse split. Like #$%$"
"I'm congratulating the BAGGIES that are holding on. Nice move for you today. I'm not convinced though that GE is ready to get back to the 14s. I'm still holding on to 2 short positions, and closed and filled 2. Made some good money in the past week, and hoping to see a drop under 13 to cover my other 2 positions."
"I am most concerned about the rs, but I think we should wait until proxy is published this week. If shareholders have to vote, then they will need a better ""selling point"". I am guessing that the rs will give Culp options for purchasing critical businesses or for spinning off other businesses, that maybe good for creating value for stockholders, but could make the stock price go down after the businessis spun off. Whatever is the purpose, I think we need to reserve judgement on Culp. I bought more today."

"GE is hated by 400,000 employees as it lost 90% of their portfolio value. So that make 400,002 if add Tusa and Markopolos. And 400,003 when you add me. Who is in?"
Decent volume today.
Stock buy back is better than reverse split. Chinese companies offer many shares for shareholders so many people can invest in the company. Reverse split is not good for very large companies like GE. Stock buy back is better. GE will go back to $100 if they just keep doing the right things.
Want to look at what a RS does — then take a look at the one week chart. And this is only the beginning. Just can’t figure out who or why anyone one or entity would now invest in GE ? Puzzling.
"GE hold pretty well considering how bad the market was for the past few days and is still trending up. GE is trading near it resistance level of 12.73. If we can see it hit this week ( which I don’t see any problem at all & possible we will see it tomorrow), 13-15+ is just only around the corner."
Wll be rush and a lot of stampede to cover today before weekend driving it up consistently throught out the day.
Larry we need to purchase 1/2 billion shares could start a reverse spilt rumor? thanks
The 12.00 dolla struggle continues..
"Owned PINS for while. Went from $11 to $85 in less than a year primarily due to COVId. PINS last week went from mid 80s to lower 60s. First time I’ve seen a swing like that in the stock for the past year. Indicates that money is moving out of social media stocks due to the opening up of society post COVId. I think Now is the time for the GE run. My biggest concern in January was the COVId variant but that seems to be overblown and a nonfactor. The US is opening back up and that’s going to change. With that will come more travel and a boost to GEs aviation. GE has a lot of potential to be a very big winner this year. Proven CEO, Name recognition, still attractive stock price for the retail investor. Not many companies out there that are this large with an entry price below just above $10/share. Two things that will very much propel GE to the next level are increase in dividend and stock buy back regardless of amount. One if not both of those actions would solidify the confidence that GE is back."
"GE you are cleared from flight level $13, expect altitude of $13.50 in 120 mins. and begin to level off at end of the bell today, expect to climb to $14 by opening bell tomorrow. IMHO GLTA..... GO LOOOOOOONGS."

"Who here listened to the meeting this week? It's over 2 hours long GE is not going anywhere but up! Long is the only way to play this! If Charlie Munger opinion is that Culp is the best thing to happen to GE, that's good enough for me"
"Like your comments TURIN look at L. Culp stile at DHRtook over in his 30s with stock at $11/share and 14 years later retired with stock at $65/sh after leaving in charge a mew CEO and dhr stock is now about 7 years later $200/shI own $500k options, triple what i started with in jan 2020 and i will never sell after exercising 160k calls because Culp will retire in 2024 with option to stay 2025 as executive chair and i expect GE to triple again after his departure just like he did with DHR"
"Let's put all political B.S. aside; I have to rank GE among some of the elite corporations that back in the day provided tuition reimbursement. They helped me greatly back in the early to mid 80's to obtain a college education, even though I didn't remain with GE. There were no obligations to remain joined with the company after graduation. Another elite company that provides tuition reimbursement is Mattress Firm.If I were a present day high school graduate... Who cares about $15.00 per hour flipping burgers or picking up trash in a Food Lion parking lot. A good percentage of parents have not invested in 529 plans; nor have they put back for education.When I went to work for GE back in the day; I had $300.00 to begin my education. GE provided some flexibility in my schedule as long as I worked my 40 hours and my portion of required overtime. GE took care of the rest of my tuition as long as there was a Grade C or above. HATS off to GE for helping me develop my career via tuition reimbursement. I wouldn't have pursued a post high school graduation without it.EVEN IF YOU GET A $15.00 MINIMUM WAGE; you will only be satisfied for a short time. You'll always be stuck in that grocery store or fast food job with very little advancement.With an associate's or bachelor's degree; this is something you can carry with you."

"You want to know how I know that GE isn't closing above $12.52 or below $12.48 today? Because, There is still over 30k contracts of the $12.50 call @.04cents and 12k of the $12.50 puts @.09cents open that expire worthless at market close today.These greedy MM's aren't giving up a dime they don't have to!"
GE renewable energy business!
GE I believe will stay at a solid $14 and above from this day going forward. This company has no place to go but UP as long as MR. Culp is navigating this company. Just about anyone can fly a plane (GE) but not everyone can navigate. I've seen too many people that can do one but not the latter and at this point in time GE has one who can do both. So sit down strap in and all you nay sayers be quite and watch us looooongs ride this diamond to the moon and beyond. IMHO of course. GLTA especially the loooongs.
GE Drops .5% and all the 's just go nuts! lol check the last 6 months and try and grasp what the future may hold for this ELECTRIC pioneer company

"once this thing breaks past 12 to the 13 area, it's gonna march on up to 20 this summer.... will be fun"
Typical dead cat bounce.Setting up for falling harder.
Good Day to All GE Investors!!! :) :) :)
When is the CFO speaking today? And is there a way to access it?
"It was a nice run from $7 with 5K shares. Sadly, it's time to move on. I'm buying UBER with my gains."
"I'm all in with $F, $GM, $STLA, $PCRFY and $GE. They are still cheap, especially when you compare them with Tesla. This is where you need to be if you want the next TSLA stock."
GE should Spin off one of their divisions of to shareholders In an IPO. Wake everybody up.
GE is considered to be a green energy company. This stock will have a premium price going forward.
Who’s buying?
Foolish idea! Reverse splits are never seen in a positive light. The GE stock was moving up nicely and would have hit 25 by year end. Learning to be different is not easy. I understand that that other industrial companies are trading at 100+ but is this the only way to catch up? Someone talked the board and management into doing this reverse split. Who was it and what was in it for them?
"Bone to Wall Street that's all. GE isn't reversing to clean itself up to borrow money. In fact, today, it's paying down $30 billion lol. Buy."
Look at TSA check point numbers highest ever for week day since pandemic started

Ge priced in the earning of this year Hold it is fractions what it would be in two or three years as long Larry is there it is just binging
GE simply has no buying power or interest... no legs for any meaningful movement the last 20 years
Looking Really Good! 
$13.30 nope too high. Wait for the drop.
over 10% correction after ER this week!
1-8 reverse split is a Ge killer below $10.00 by Friday. This is a massive slap in the face to the retail investors that kept them afloat over the past few years.
Nice drop today.

Sssshhhh ....GE creeping to 14.00
Is buying GE stock now better than the safe secure returns of an FDIC CD ? Just maybe.
Forget the noise. Keep holding. Debt reduction is good. Look at other growth company. Their revenue is 1/10 - 1/20 and yet their market cap is over GE.
12. Do I hear 12?
The pumpers are out in full force trying to keep this #$%$ on life support
"Ineptocrosy is a system of government where the least capable to lead are elected by the least capable of producing, and where the members of society least likely to sustain themselves or succeed, are rewarded with goods and services paid for by the confiscated wealth of a diminishing number of producers."
GE and BP are long solid investments . Both companies are investing heavily in renewable energy sector .
What a very successful day. Congratulations everybody.
"Here is why R/S is happening and you can't stop it1. They want money. They will offer shares once they're done reverse split and repeat this again, and again, and again, as they did so over many decades. Do your research.2. You, as shareholder, does not have power to change the outcome if the board wants it to happen.Yes it's hard to accept that your favorite stonk will go rewind 6 months of growth but it's better to cut it now than never. If you bought this share 20 years ago, you'd be down 80% by now. If you bought it 5 years ago, you'd be down 60%. If you sell it now, you're only down 20%.Leave this trash stock as their primary objective is to take money from investors, not everyone is like Elon Musk."
"I posted twice to BA board on F-15EX. But this board does not show my improved post, with no typos. Good news F-15EX will be very popular, GE engines are being delivered this year. Check the BA site"
Culp makes bold move with reverse split. Hopefully encourage penny traders to go elsewhere.
can anyone imagine where this stock would be trading at if the market takes a big downturn? stock is going down with market at record highs
Do we cross $11.00 today?
Weak hands should not sell based on logic. Economy is coming back while management is rebuilding GE
"No bad news to fuel the drop today. Betting its GOP money getting pulled ahead of their feared Blue Fed. Govt. That's fine, it's about time we flipped the wealth from the few to the many. I'll buy their scare shares all day!!!"
You can bet Morgan Stanley and Goldman are ready to pounce. Buy.
They have already admitted they won't make their numbers this qtr or year. Does this mean Culp gets his bonus for making the SP target? LOL
It's a beautiful day...in the (GE) neighborhood! 
"U.S. and UK agree to suspend tariffs and seek aircraft row resolutionReuters Staff(Reuters) - Britain and the United States on Thursday agreed a four-month suspension of retaliatory tariffs imposed on goods like Scotch whisky over a long running aircraft subsidy row, saying they would use the time to resolve the dispute.$Ge $BA"
Hmmhh stock up over 100% last 6 months so you screw it all up and announce a reverse 8 to 1 split. makes you wonder what they are thinking or potential accounting games. wouldn't be the first time for GE. talk about a momentum ruiner...
"GE up 5.2% yesterday and the countdown continues. In 20 days GE reports 2018 Q4 earnings and Larry Culp presents his turnaround plan containing how GE will deliver on the $420,000,000,000 order backlog ($94,000,000,000 for Power segment), the pension risk reduction of over $7,200,000,000 due to the Fed tax rate increases, the schedule for completing the Transportation sale to Wabtec and shares delivered to current GE share holders, the schedule for spinning off GE Healthcare and the shares delivered to current shareholders, the value of the recent Iraq Power deal ($15,000,000,000), and too many more positives to mention. The future is bright for GELess"
"I agree with you whole Heartily Mohandess, I think that everything will work out hopefully !"
"Keep in mind, with every penny lost is a step away from Culp getting his bonus shares. As much as I hate RS as well, this does make sense to rightsize the excessive float and yes, it will reduce volatility."
Looks like the lower $11/share prices are gone.Better buy now before above $12 from here on out.Imagine if GE can create or get in crypto ....  Will be flying this summer 
The Culprit owns 13.9 Million shares. Do you think he cares about you longs? He is corrupt to begin with.
"Every chart - 1D, 5D, 1M, YTD, 6M and 1Y are ALL positive. That seems like a trend to me..."
Split happens sometime between a few months and a year later in 2022. There will be a lot of ups and downs but the general trend will
"Well, it’s a shame that GE is once again going to fall like other companies have done in the past.. remember Board Members, you can’t put lipstick on a pig.. A reverse split will not dress up your company. Very unwise decision to even ponder.. I’m done with GE..."
i envision ge going from $100 to $200 like I envision GE going from $13 to $26.
Everyone at $SCR thought reverse split was a good thing until it actually happened and got halved in a week

GE sitting on MOUNTAIN OF CASH AND LIQUIDITY $$100 BILLION in the USA and abroad..*GE is an EV Story, GE Aviation growth Story, GE Renewable is a growth story, GE Healthcare is a growth and life saving story"

"I can't believe no GE spokesman has presented one word of rational for a reverse stock split. Arguments exist either for or against. We shareholders have a right to know. Their reasoning for doing this should come prior to the announcement. Did I miss something?At this point, I have to believe it's a deliberate attempt to shock the share price down for buy in purposes. If so isn't that illegal coming from an internal source?"
GE Aims to Slash Debt by 35% by 2023. GE is on its way to 30....

What do they achieve from doing a reverse split? The share price was already going up to 20 plus
"From what I've read, this is a ""proposed"" RS. Based on the stock action, it doesn't look like current shareholders are very keen on the idea. I wonder if this will be factored into the ultimate decision. I hope so."

Please fasten your seatbelts and return your tray-tables to the upright position as we anticipate some turbulence ahead. Thank you for flying GE!! 
PROBABLY THE REVERSE SPLIT IS PART OF THE DEAL ON $30 BILLIONS ?
Get OUT NOW.......................they taking to single digits.................................
"Stock down?...sounds like good news! +$30 BLM cash, and still own 46% of aviation business"
"I'd like to better understand this AerCap deal so please help me out if I describe this incorrectly. It seems that GE is selling off an unprofitable subsidiary. I'm not sure why some articles describe this as a merger when it's a sale to another entity. This is good for GE because they are cutting a loser. This hopefully will be good for the buyer, but GE investors only care about GE. GE will get cash. Adding cash and reducing losses is good. Noone is really talking about whether GE is getting a fair price, but considering it's a loser anything seems good. Does that about sum it up? Not really groundbreaking, but positive. Is this a good summary?"
We cannot break 13.25. Maybe next week.
I've got a bid in at $12.12 let's see 
MAYBE TOMORROW $1 DOWN AGAIN ????? SO LAST CALL TO GET OUT LOL HEHEHEHEEEEEEE DO NOT FIGHT THE TREND
Pratt and Whitney engine on the 120 Boeing 777 that have a problem.BAD for Boeing and Pratt but good for GE!!
Tusa was right. $4-5 is being generous. I have replaced 14 of 18 GE LED bulbs that only lasted approx 1 year. I'm sure the other 4 will fail any day now. Replaced with Phillips. NEVER BUYING another GE product EVER AGAIN.
"If GE decides to buy FCEL they would be looking at over 30 billion in stock and equivalents. All of that for a company with just a few million in sales and large losses. Technology is pretty good, but what's the potential to ever break even for GE while dropping this stock to $10 a share? GE focus on what you are good at and keep paying down your debt!"
General Electric ends tumultuous year with stronger cash flows

Look at call 15 someone knows something
Swing traders understand 13.15 is the price to enter with a big purchase.
"Is it because the egos of the present management group make them desperate to see a higher price on their company's shares regardless of how they get there? Remind me again.... What happened to Citigroup after the 1-for-10 reverse split? C has never gotten back to anywhere near the pre-split high, and probably never will."
"Nice climb after hours tooI would love to see a steady climb next week to above 14 based on FUNDAMENTALS and positive improvements in debt, new deals, more jets being sold."
Tusa has become irrelevant. Has been wrong for a few years now. His thesis got saved by the COVID crisis. His short positions from his peddling buddies are badly hurting. So ignore.

"Today: At the opening the run down continue as predicted, Then the move up to 11.10, but remember the 11.18 stalling! finally retreated at around 11.23. I still belive that around 8 to 9 am the market will continue the run down as the SPY should test the 373 area, hopefully it will stay above 370! but the main move will come at the end of the day between 11:45 and the close. Why! Monday is the beginning of the month and my pention is posted, so is many of yours, and here come all that money into the market. That is the plan. by the way how big monewise is the Senegal deals. Summary Ge will sell of after moving higher than 11:23 today, and will ralley into Monday starting at the end of today secion.

"Culp is chiseling a lean and fundamentally sound juggernaut. I believe he wants this bad boy listed on the Dow again. The whales are much more attracted to higher-priced stocks. The panic over the r/s was absolutely absurd and fueled by short-selling misinformation artists. GE is on an ever-growing trajectory, take a look at its 1-year chart. This thing is really going to take off, get on and relax. Invest with your brain and not your emotions"
"Wow, huge volume. Big players getting involved. Get in now and enjoy the pump over the next few weeks!"
GE Has been a complete shareholder train wreck the past 20 years..
This is how Robinhood people give away their profits to Wall Street fat Cats. They really don’t understand what’s really going on.
"Wait, where did all the pumpers run off to? I thought we would be at $13 by the end of the day? Please explain how your extensive knowledge failed you in your predictions?"
GE will not go to $4.00; GE will go to $100.64 very soon.Count on it!

BAGGIES in denial once again.
Now up over 7% this new year!
Every sizeable purchase is being nailed large and down ticked. Going to be a long day for bulls.
Does anyone understand that shareholders must approve the reverse split and so far it sounds like they will vote against it. I think everyone is overlooking this very important fact.
Great day to pick up shares
post the news link for reverse split or its fake
shorts rushing to cover their positions this morning
"Like I said this morning (see post), someone was playing a big game yesterday and today. 1/2 the normal volume each day, to get some institutional buyer(s) lots of shares at cheap prices. Will not be surprised at all to see GE upgrade after hours or in pre-market."
Some of the loss is from Boeing rotten ER report.
"GECAS made 700 m USD losses in 2020, so receiving 30 bn USD and 49 percent of the the AERC Company: Good deal by all means. Hope that the 99.9 per Cent emotional reaction will stop soon. Looking to GEs cost base of 2020 and the business picking up, I recommend to have a look at GEs annual report of 2020 before being negative in Culp. He is knowing what he is doing. GLTA"
This is a game for big boys. The information about the re-split did not come out by accident. Be greedy when others are afraid.
tomorrow is investor day might be good for a small pop but the level ll market shows down pressure is about to roll over again and down the chute will go GE
We will have double digit economic growth this year and GE will lead the pack.
"The Year of the CULP, forward statement will push stock over $13 in 2 weeks, the again maybe the Robin Hood investors find all the Shorts playing in GE $25 end of year"
Reverse splits and stock buybacks will not boost the stock. Dividend increases and paying off debt will. I sold the majority of my GE at 30 awhile back (at a profit)
DIVIDEND INCREASE COMING SOON....!!!!!!
There is a rising up trend line at 12.50 or so. (4h)
Zacks does indeed have GE as a #1 ranked stock which kind of surprised me. Are they a reliable ranking service?

The stock is in freefall right now. You may want to cut your losses now while you still have a chance to live to fight another day. Tomorrow this will be sub $10 & I think everyone already knows that.
Who’s got a guess where it closes today
????? why reverse at this point of recovery.... makes no sense
"To all those spreading disinformation... this was a Pratt&Whitney engine, NOT GE!"
"Wake up people, before the the possible reverse split next year this stock is projected to trading around $30 per share after the reverse split it will be $200 to $240 and in 2023 close to $340 to $400 per share. Invest in $GE to help build your wealth the value is right in front of you the CEO Larry Culp is trying to show you!"
Me like!!
Most reverses are usually done to avoid delisting. It looks like they are trying to reduce outstanding shares here. I wish they would do it by stock buyback instead. I also think this will make their meager dividend look more insulting. I still like GE but I don't think others perceive it as a $100 stock. Maybe the shareholders will vote it down. I think overall the reverse will cause a lot of short term pain for shareholders
"Thee also going to partner with Apple/GE for the new car , How cool will that look ."
"General Electric Company holds about 349,439,701 BKR's( Baker Hughes) shares Dec 30, 2020 47.94% of total shares. That is about 11 Billions value ."
"I see an open tomorrow morning at $11.88, with a close above $12, on 88 million volume."
smart money selling huge
"serious investors pay no heed to the suggested RS ..... that kind of clouded some other points of interest in the health of GE .... from Barrons :General Electric asked investors to do some difficult math last week about its balance sheet and accounting, and the investors balked. Shares fell as shareholders digested a lot of news related to complicated debt actions, asset sales, and accounting consolidations. In the end, the outcome—less debt is a good thing, but the one thing that investors hate is confusion.The only problem anyone had with GE back in Welch days was the structure and accounting , too baffling for most analysts and they only looked at what Welch wanted them to see bigger revs andbigger earnings ... while camoflaging liabilities .. garce"
Oh SNAP this is GE.
Like this if you are holding your shares
How is this going to fly with the split putting this around 100.00? The co kees selling of the co. Is it really worth $100.00 a share Hmmmm
OK close letting banks COVERING in the 13s thanks to the reverse split fantasy false news. Won't last long. This stock is worth $15 TODAY. Once the bstards cover the party can continue.
"If you have a business mind or you have run a business for yourself, you understand how good the deal is for your company. Larry Culp and the board are ones of the smartest people. We are the stupid ones who don't understand the value they create for GE. The analysts understand and will upgrade the stock. Right now, the stock is being sold temporatorily. It will go back up today or a couple days later when analysts upgrade the stock. I see this is a great opportunity to buy."
"JJ , J J , RJ and Chicken man, feel the burn. The way you spread bad slanted detail, much deserved."
Stock prices go up and down. GE is still the same company I bought 6 months ago. The reasons why I bought GE remain as true today as they were 6 months ago. I see the drop as a buying opportunity. The possibility of a reverse split might be a bookkeeping trick but long-term it doesn't change the potential of GE growing in the very near future. Market Mentality is a strange beast.
GE long-term call options are cheap and represent great potential upside! Do your DD!
DOWN DOWNDOWN TODAY below below BELOW $13 TODAY YEAH GE DOWN SHORTED THIS MORNING AT 13.39 BEFORE AM TRADING
If you didn’t think this country is turning socialism blocking conservatives free speech.. now Wall Street is stopping trades of certain stocks that they feel are hurting the crooked hedge funds..
S&P bounce. Tech is moving higher. AAPL and MSFT been green all day
Let’s make a Deal.......Culp beginning to shuffle the cards.
"sorry for the drop , its because I bought in"
I am somewhat disappointed
Bears/shorts are not going to wait here for aviation to recover. Buy.
14$ coming soon
I would love to see this run back up to 14 todayThat would make a great start to the week
Back to 25 release the hounds
"some people on this board are rushing to judgement. NO REVERS SPLIT has happened yet. It is recommended and will be voted in MAY. Please note many things can happen till then and majority of board member may vote against it, specially if stock keeps gain traction and momentum......we are all against it......say NO to RS"
1 of my rules never invest in a company that does a reverse split
"Reddit has GE on its hit list, Good for them. A win win"
The Week after week GE Friday sell off... wash/rinse/repeat
"Every Aviation up big 200% to 400%, GE being held down low, severely undervalued, it's not even up 100% from 2008 lows, March lows $6.66.. GE was already severely undervalued at $13, below $20, $30 before the C0vid19.. Now GE is even further undervalued. Every Aviation up 7% to 10%, but GE up only 2%.."
"If you've been following this stock for a bit, you know this stock does this really oftentoo bad to be the sucker who bought the top but you are going to be carrying the bag for at least 6 months, and you won't even know if it will ever go back up to your entry"
"altair acquires ...........As part of the acquisition, Altair and GE Aviation have signed a memo of understanding (MOU) to facilitate a higher level of collaboration and establish a long-term strategic partnership. ge looking forward"
might reach $11
"NMM executed 15 for 1 reverse split. Share price dropped from $11 post split to $4. As of Friday, share price was $22 which is $1.47 presplit. It is scary but if GE drops to $6 -$8 range pre split, I am back in. Everybody talks about GE's potential. I am not longer fooled."
This should of been $12 today .
Expect stock to be at 60.00 after 8 to 1
"and the retail Investor heard ""BOO"" and he ran scared..."
I managed to sell 7 March 19 contracts from 1.25-1.33(the high of the day). Do you think we could make another high today or was that it?
"I am new to all this. But if there isna reverse split, if you had 8 shares you will have 1, but what happens if you have 1? Could someone please explain it to me?"
Larry Culp had better do something about this fast as he is taking a lot of money off the top for himself so....this is not right...not at all. Boolean
Based on the technicals $12.01 was the buying point. Buying did start and I think we should be okay till $13.05
They are pinning the strike on the 12.50 call options that expire today. With 10 year bond yields spiking again today the sector rotation trade is back on. GE is oversold. Watch it pop to the upside next week.
"So much for Welch's legacy... GE (at $110B) still has leprosy... another limb amputation for $30B won't cure what ""ails"" it... bad management... mission creep... people who don't anticipate metric vs. imperial conversions & crash satellites into planets... Big ""L""..."
"interesting opening today, will see where it takes us"
"Red day to buy more or short if that's your thing. Hopefully tomorrow, a steady climb will begin.Current pricing really seems like a recovery value from before Covid hit. So any debt reduction or revenue increase should really bring this thing up at least into the 12's I would think."
"Longs and new retail investors who are cheering Managements RS decision and patting yourselves on the backs:GE just three short days ago was at $14.42, then on ""Investors day"" Management thought it was a good idea to announce they were no longer interested in doing business with the small ""Retail Investor""... Had they not chosen this route GE would be sitting at $16.50-$17.50 right now. But, hey enjoy the dead cat bounce and keep cheering these dirt bags on for their truly vile RS decision."

"It's a sad reality, but the large numbers of nursing home and assisted living deaths due to Covid infections will be of financial benefit to GE. Also, the reluctance of the aged to move to such places will also benefit GE. All due to GE's residual insurance guarantees (a financial risk they took several years ago when those insurance units were sold) that will eventually expire. GE will be able to take that risk factor (set asides) off the books, which will be another plus for the balance sheet.Go, GE!Good luck, longs."
down $.69 from opening highs of day. this is still the most manipulated play on the market. can make 3-4% every day on trades executed in 1st 10 minutes of trading and buy back during last 30 minutes of trading. put the numbers in and look at last 2 months. opens at high closes at lows. SEC needs to close this one down with its accounting games.
"GE is holding the $ 14 level nicely. If the market pulls back, keeping $ 14 will be difficult. On the other hand, high tech money may come in here.P / E is still attractive, prospects are great, management is very good. Strengths only."
Apple should buy GE for $22 per share......then break it up for $46 per share. Someone is going to do it. Might as well be Apple. :-)

"To all of you who panic sold last week just because of the reverse split, you got what you deserve."
GE eliminated dividend and eliminated retirees who are long term investors for dividend income. Now GE is targeting retail investors with reverse split. Go figure.

boy feel pretty good down $60K in 1 1/2 trading days any more good news....
Want to know when GE is truly on the road to recovery? When the freaking dividend starts moving north of that .01 cents a quarter. That is when this stocks starts to move. Get that dividend back up to 2-3%.
here comes 15
End of the year 18-20$ mark my words and make a screen of this comment

"For those that say reverse splits are bad this is usually true. However, this reverse split has a strategy to lower outstanding shares and bring the SP to align with similar companies NOT because they are trying to stay listed!"

"So, it seems Immelt has a book out trying to detail all of his trials and tribulations at GE. An attempt to justify how he ran GE into the ground when he was at the helm. As he laughs all the way to the bank with his $300,000,000. While other people lost the bulk of their retirement portfolio. It's sickening!!!"
GE keeps hitting bad luck. With descent earnings and multiple good news and upgrades still dives down this time because of down market. Good luck to all longs.
buying opportunity shorts will cover in big numbers real soon and then it's up up and away
I really like Culp as GE’s new CEO. I think he knows how to fix things.
buying the dip going to 16 soon free cash flow positive
"Anyone on this board who's touting the idea of a reverse split ""1 share for every 8"" as positive, is a complete fraud. This in no way shape or form, has ever been a positive move, for any company, at any time, anywhere!!"
"2021 quarterly FCF likely will look similar to 2017. 2017-12-31. 5,442.00M2017-09-30. 1,589.00M2017-06-30 908.00M2017-03-31 -740.00M"
GE will go up if Dems win Georgia Senate seats.
Down because the entire market is down. Will go up on earnings tomorrow.
Tusa and Markopolos are correct. GE will fall to $4.
I closed my GE positions as soon as market opened. I am not sure if I want to get in again. I will wait
Volume guesses for today..............????
"nothing but good news ahead, plus CULP pulls off another very profitable m&a deal, $15+ in the next 50 days"
Cheapest stock in the sp 500. 
"Holding 58 shares, bought it at $6. Best position made so far as a young investor. The numbers are there "
This is a no brainer imo2250 @$13.87
"GE: Sell ,sell, sell! There are plenty of buyers."
"So where does Tusa see downside, aviation? Power? Oil services? healthcare? The man is off his meds obviously. Buy the dipper!"
my below post should have read - get $26 billion not $6 billion from AERCAP
Breaking through 12.05 resistance will be key to going well into the 12’s.I am hoping the opening volume will accomplish that
My bad!! I said 50 million volume in 1st hour but it actually took 11 minutes!!
I bought this at 6.50. When I bought it I told everyone it would hit 10 before it hit 5. Everyone was writing it off. That is like writing off Walmart or Amazon. NOT gonna happen. This will be 15 before March.
reverse split to increase the share price before spinning off a portion of their business? seems interesting
If this is true and becomes reality a reverse split is the worst news ever for existing shareholders... I’m basically speechless
"Wow, Lieden to the rescue. Just like Culprit to dismantling GE."
"Over $12 I told ya no point in selling . Give it a year , Will be triple"
Reverse split to increase share price and keep it stock away from most people this way the managements can focus the task at hand rather than trying to put out the fires on hourly or daily basis.Smart move
Oh no! Don’t tell me that GE will be $15 on Friday! Can it really move up 10% in 5 trading days?
Just unbelievable. Dow going up but not GE after management great idea.
If you want to see a thing of true beauty take a peek at the 1 year chart for GE.
Culp does not care about retail investors apparently.
"8,000,000,000 shares! Time to take this down 8-fold! I'm all for it. Let's do this! :)"
Wake and bake doooooooodzzzzz
why suggest a reverse split with the stock trading at $14 when the normal thing would have been to reverse it when it was 3 or 4 bucks ?
Tomorrow stocks will continue selloff. GE back to 12. Nice short.
It is going to be a very interesting day tomorrow...
Huge mistake on GE's part. Lots of investors have been holding this for a long time; had no choice. Now an opportunity comes to partially make things right. Perception means a lot in investing. There was NO reason to split this stock now when people finally feeling OK about it. They took what shoud have been a day for celebration (new deal) and cratered the stock. Very poor move GE.
"Judging by the reaction on this board, i don't think the R/S split is going to happen. Looks like a buy here."
"MAKE YOUR VOICE BE HEARD. CALL THEM and leave a message. Email investor relations instead of posting here.This is IGNOBLE market manipulation at its best. It is known even by a 4 year old child that for ANY stock that rallied 100% announcing a reverse split is bringing it down at least 20-30%.The BOD should be investigated.Thanks to latest achievements GE is worth $20 today. But no, let's make up a REVERSE SPLIT announcement. Are we kidding me? This is criminal. Yes buy more shares, but also bombard them with complaints.Stay greedy my friends"
"Portable ultrasound is the future. Companies like $GE are trying to get a piece of market share, but $bfly is the one who currently, and continues to, dominates the industryArk bought another 300k shares today after that news dropped, this company is going double by earnings"
I don't blame them. The optics are terrible when you are single digit or low two digit stock. I'm glad they are doing it.
GOING RED NEGATIVE SOON -- I CAN FEEL IT TRENDING LOWER YIPEE --->>>>> THANK YOU LORD THANK YOU BATHALA THANK YOU REVERSE SPLIT...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The new year begins for GE... wash/rinse/repeat
"Warren Buffet on CNBC ""GE is a STRONG company"""
"**RS..PRICELINE (BKNG $2500 today), UP 27,777% since 2002.**HOV is UP 2,100%"
"GE reporting $386.5Bn in backlog, of which $260Bn is in aviation with a pre-2020 margin of ~20% in 2018/2019. This demand will start to flow through in 2H21."
All these shorts crying abt the reverse split because it’ll make it harder for them to short. Don’t be fooled longs. Culp and the board are smarter than these tools. Hahahahaha
"Despite the occasional success story, reverse splits aren't usually a good sign for a stock. Still, they don't have to be a death knell, either. Because reverse stock splits have no fundamental impact on a company, it's more important to look at the financial health of a stock to assess whether a reverse split is likely to work in the long run."
"This definitely wants to go to 12 folks, and it seems she does not want to wait till tomorrow."
"Reverse split is completely overcooked, looking at Siemens without Health and without Energy: they have 850 m shares outstanding with a market cap more or less comparable with GE. So what’s the point ? Looking at AVGO / AMZN/GOOGLE etc.: is the shares price in absolute terms a reason for private retailers not to buy these shares ? Share price drop only gives opportunity for institutional buyers to enter the boat. Im more convinced than ever that GEs next move will be to spin off some segments, like Siemens did. It’s a pity that the main news are muddled under: good deal for GE and business is picking up !!!GLTA"
Out at 13.25 I don't care to be a GE spectator while not making any money. I don't care to watch my gains from buying at a low of 5.60 whittled away by stock adjustments and reorganization dramas.
as i said before fire the person who had the idea to reverse split. took us years to go over $14 and now this? SHAME
This stock acting up with Nasdaq. The dow is up 400 point and He should go up at least 60 to 70 cents. But as soon as Nasdaq came down so did the GE.What the F
Ask yourself why you would sell GE now???
"It's time for our dear JPM Toosa to stop VICTIMIZING GE STOCK.. Stop holding grudges because GE previous mgmt removed JPM rep from BOD in 2016. The start of GE price decline.. Pl, JPM stop the MANIPULATION, holding grudges is not Godly, not good.. Let go of GE, please let our GE trade at its deserved price $$30 to $$50"

The investment has enabled the company to develop additive applications across six GE businesses, create new services applications across the company, and earn 346 patents in powder metals alone. Yeah GE did something right and will be rewarded."

Good Day to All GE Investors !!! :):):)
buy at worst it will be a slow climb but a climb no less
Rising interest works in favor for GE pension obligations. A nice tail wind going forward as Fed tries to fight inflation.
"WOW....LOTS OF PEOPLE BOUGHT IT AT ABOVE $12 THIS MORNING HOPING IT WILL BE SKYROCKTING, BUT SADLY IT NOSE DIVED.. NOT EVEN STABLE FOR 20 MIN :("
"Great BUYING opportunity, will take off on Monday and then much more on Tuesday after earnings and never look back. Great company with great CEO doing an outstanding job!"
GE
This needs to break this 11.70 ish resistance level. A advance to 12 would be nice
I am retired and need secure income have few dividend paying stocks including GE. should I invest more in bond or dividend stocks as of now my mix is 50/50.I am looking for opinion not advice.
"GE has been consolidating for a while. It has tested $10.5 low several times recently and moved back above $11. This is a very good sign. GE is waiting for good news to make a breakout. GE management will give a presentation in March. Before that, the bears will attack again. Prepare to accumulate more shares under $11 if it falls under the price since GE might never fall under $11 again. Don’t be shakeout while waiting. I trust GE will be breakout $12 and stay above $13 before March’s update. My target price for GE is $16 to $20 by the end of 2021!"
"nice going, holding onto ge paid off, for me a double"
Entire market was off today - long weekend blues - next week GE starts its move.
"I bought at $6. holding to 18-20$... my biggest holdings are GE, BA, and UAL all I believe are safe harbor for this year."
GE back to its former glory of 30 bucks a share. Just give it a little time. I’m holding this one long. Seriously Bullish￼￼
Larry Culp!!! Brilliant!!!
The big play is China allowing BA back in the market / largest orders after US / when that happens and it will after some political wrangling add another 10% easy ..
JJ and other bashers are trying to drive the sp down. They are scammers. Notice they don’t provide any facts. They don’t do their DD.GE doubled in 4 months. There is a reason.Don’t listen to the shorts.
I am all in if you slash debt by growing revenue rather than by selling assets.

"First fib, 9.70"
A reverse split is one of the worst things that can happen to an investor. After 50 years in the Market I've never seen this work for a stock holder. The board must look at us as stupid. A good example is Citi Bank. Split 10 for one 10 years ago. I still view it as a $7 stock and never bought another share. Same for Xerox. Somehow this must help management with stock options. This looks like a loser for years to come to me. Replace the Board. Dumb move.
had 20k shares bought when it was 6$. have no remaining trust after this announcement.. bye GE LARRY CULP.. Bought COTY INSTEAD SUE NABI WONT PULL #$%$ LIKE THAT.
"Whereas the demise of power took us down, it's resurgence especially with brownouts to blackouts increasing, will bring us back up. Buy the best in class."
"Uh uh, buy. How this is still below $15 is a mystery. Everything they own is now banging it."
TUSA being led by his toofy all the way to $15 lol. Ouch!
"Reverse splits are typically not good for companies. I sold half my position and booked some profits. I will wait to see how this plays out for GE. They should have just let well enough alone, but GE is doing great things, so it may not hurt them in the long run."
GE will be the next GME but with real reasoning on company growing again.
$10 soon hehehehe lol
"GE CASH & LIQUIDITY $$100 BILLION ($41 BN in USA+ $30Bn abroad+ $$25 BILLION Line of credit UNTOUCHED)..GE PAID OFF near $$50 BILLION debt/pension.. GE SPENT $$120 BILLION DISPOSABLE CASH in buying back stock, paying debt, LTC, pension, and set aside other things.. GE IS A CASH MACHINE"
go GE go..........non stop one way ticket to $15
The dust yet to settle...downgrades will start pouring in....big buyers will cash out and wait for the stock to dive further after the split...new buyers will be scared off and more and more.....One of the most badly and untimed announcement...........
If volume continues to increase GE is going to have one heck of an earnings run.
"only proposed by the boards, it needs the ok from the big investors!"
"Not going to hit 500mil, but 300+ likely.... Blood bath! Reverse the Reverse split decision, please!"
"Immelt flew with 2 jets every where he went and ""did not really think about it"" (about waste). -- isn't that a clueless CEO? enough said. Problem was BOD let Immelt gut GE for too long."
My computer shows GE down . 42 in AH trading; is that right??
Relax people. MMs are lowering the price for institutions to get in before Earning next TUE. Look back at last Earnings in late OCT. Stock price went down to $6 before skyrocket over $10 in 3 weeks after Pfizer vaccine announcement after Election!....mark my words...$14 in Feb.!
"Bankruptcy is certain, that's all you need to know about 6 Sigma Jack."
"jj can keep bashing, but he will never recover from that $6.25 short. LOL"
Hopefully $14 soon.
GE is getting HOT with volume and momentum. It is trading above it resistance level as well. We can see GE 14 just around the corner.
"If i was head of research at JP Morgan, I'd reassign GE coverage to another analyst. Buy."
"All right BAGGIES, you didn't listen to me. GEs turn around, has become a reach around. Hold on tight while you are bent over."
$30B plus 46% ownership with the combined company? That’s a great news
"Tech under assault, GE up! No stopping this train with brownouts, blackouts, and Pratt and Whitney jet engines burning up in the sky. Buy."
EXPECT TRADING VOLUME TO BREAK RECORD...ONE of the most stupid announcement of all time.......smelling conspiracy and TUSA.....CULP to make an announcement and explanation about the issue before its too late..... Where did this whole idea came from and why ? Must have good reason for it and shareholder demand to know about it.........................................
"In absolute numbers, short shares are high with 80 million (and I think everybody understands, that it’s only one percent of outstanding shares). So it will cost 880 million + to wipe them out. Nokia was trading yesterday 1.1 billion shares with 60 million shares short having around 6 billion outstanding shares. Its the equivalent of 5.5 billion USD trading value. So it’s ridiculously cheap to kickstart the GE process compared to Nokia’s battle yesterday. Especially as GE has clearly a mid term success story to write like AAL. So stay alerted, the days will be longer for shorties !"

"citigroup did a reverse split in 2013 today it's doing better but took timeThe stock that had been trading at $4.52 at the time, began to trade above $40 a share. Citigroup's then CEO Vikram Pandit and former Chairman Richard Parsons said the purpose of the reverse split was to increase the share of institutional investors holding the stock.Apr 24, 2013"
Beautiful move..anyone know where Tusa is?
"Some of you out there maybe sweating right now, but this is a great opportunity to buy on the dip to all the fellow long investors!"
"What is really going on? Aggressive accounting at GE is an understatement. They are BROKE. When rates rise on their debt, they will have to sell off more business or declare bankruptcy. I think new mgmt is doing the right thing by coming clean. It will send this stock down below 5 and maybe $2 bucks so they need reverse split before it hits the fan... optics are worse if they do a RS at 2 bucks... now they can spin it in a favorable way."
Rumor has it that GE was being sold to China in Pakistan last night and got prevented by the military. Anyone confirm?
and...... back down again
Do share holders get to vote on the reverse split? Would institutional investorsvote it down?
"tusas comment was to avoid ge, in contrast to approx. 60% of analysts who consider ge a buy"

Here she goes....down down down. Close your positions!!!
All seems so good until now. GE_to_$400 please bring some bitterness....
777 that had engine problems over Denver has nothing to do with GE. GE makes the best of the best engines. Stay positive and grasp the fact that GE hit $12 after 9 months of bashings and is heading for a new 52 week high. Good luck to all longs.
Well they held it down as long as they could - Monday huge!
"CNBC reporters lying right now about GE, saying that its down because investors wanted a better price on partnership deal. Not because of the 1 share for 8 reverse split. Complete Frauds and manipulation!"
Down only 8.31 % today plus the big loss yesterday. Poster Steven says Reverse Split is a great idea. So No worries LOL. Wait till the split comes and it drops for weeks. I was almost out. I was actually debating about holding. Go fiqure . Scammed .
A lot of Dopes on this board that have no idea what they are talking about... This reverse split is a short sellers dream come true with a company like GE
Pretty sad when the whole market is up and I’m happy GE is only down 2 cents. Even when it gains and can’t hold those gains.. I’m long because I have to be at this point not because I want to be.
Last chance shorts to cover before earning surprise
if you can't defend the 13.40 level the shorts are in charge

"GE will bounce back, not to worry !"
A few examples of reverse splits... DRYS shipping had 7 reverse splits before delisting. UNG has 6 reverse splits before leaving investors penniless. Reverse splits only destroy shareholders.
"Anyone shorting this stock is going down. I'm contacting Reddit and GE will be a $55 stock again. GE is profitable and growing. Don't take my word for it read it below for yorself.GEGeneral Electric Company GE is popular for its LEAP aircraft engines, Heavy-Duty gas turbines, Haliade-X and Cypress wind turbines, and healthcare solutions.In the past three months, General Electric’s shares have outperformed the industry. In fourth-quarter 2020, its earnings met estimates, while sales surpassed the same by 3.1%. In the quarters ahead, the company is poised to gain from its portfolio-restructuring program, expansion in digital business, efforts to deleverage balance sheet and solid liquidity position. Moreover, its efforts are on track to reduce the exposure to the GE Capital business. For 2021, it anticipates adjusted earnings per share of 15-25 cents. Industrial organic revenues are predicted to increase in low-single digits in the year, while adjusted organic margin is expected to expand 250 basis points. Also, Industrial free cash flow is expected to be $2.5-$4.5 billion in 2021. General Electric is working diligently to improve its liquidity and manage its leverage."
"Assuming we rev split on today's price (not going to happen of course), the stock would trade at $112In order to short that, you'd need to have deep pockets to do so.Can happen. But would have been different if the stock was teetering around $5 and it rev splits to $40...Retail investors who short could drive it back down.At a higher price and multiples of 100, you've got to have quite a bit of cash.Things are definitely looking up for GE"
I bought Ge @ $30 in 2016. I am hoping ge can return to $20 or $30. in 2 yrs.
Keep buying those up grades. Those guys are smarter then you are. hehe

Funny how the circus dumps on Thursday to get people out of the options. It must be easier to trash a stocks imagine than it is to pump."
Ge will be $200.00 by year end.
"The news hurts both longs and shorts. No one likes it, but I am going wait to hear what Culp has to say before taking actions."
We're all set looking good for $13 and up by Friday. Will crack the $13 mark sometime today. IMHO. GLTA the LOOOOOOOONNGS.

"RS would put price at $80-90 dollars. I own several stocks in this price range with great dividends, and that don't suffer from management shooting itself in the foot. This idea is destroying value and has no upside that I can see."
After R/S pps = $80.00.......... (if we are lucky....... )
wow. might even try to sell calls today with $13 strike ending this week
The RS is a move to make a future stock offering more palatable even though the numbers would be cash neutral. Less shares to offer at a much higher price.

California is opening back up and that’s all the evidence you need to see that this pandemic is over. I do find it truly amazing though how fast the country is reopening. Kids are going back to f2f learning, restaurants and other businesses that had draconian restrictions just a month ago are now given the green light. Isn’t it amazing that less than 1 month after a new administration takes office the virus is going away...... makes you think"
Buy GE it is good for America it is good for you
Looks like the markets are finally realizing all the wackjobs that took office in January and the fact that the world is dropping the dollar as the reserve currency.
Can you imagine how many gas turbine orders are piling into GE with the frailties of solar and wind now publicly exposed?
been using TA for decades most people have no idea how to use it or when it works and when it does not-- at extremes using the right indicators you have a very high probability of being right over a 4 week period all weeks inclusive in the same month-- it is not a rolling indicator where you can roll into the next month when you roll over to the next week you start from scratch- this month shows GE closing the month below 12.50 how far below just a few cents -- next month have no data yet-- anyone who tells you it is going to 15 is just guessing --- fundamental analysis tells you nothing about price action -- you can not pay the bills guessing

GE is a great buy under $11.5. several houses upgraded their target price to be $14. Even $14 price will look a bargain one year from now. I expect GE to reach $18 by the year end!

May be a day to buy morr
here is my opinion it is not good to own a stock if you are not in control. i own 700 shares for a lose. hoping to reach 17 and get out that #$%$ and now it went down because of the psychological effect of the reverse split. hey you guy who keeps on talking about math. i am the mathematician and most people think this is a wrong move. i hope it stop going down
Not a repeat of yesterdayCome on GEOne nice easy positive day would be great every once in a whileUgh

COMING SOON BAGGIES
When will the reverse splits take place ?
Current GE shareholders
What's the news?
GE has been shaking out retail holders and retirees since it was $30. Even Buffet was shoke out at $25. GE keeps shaking.
"As an investor who has been following GE since early 2000's and having bought/sold several times, it seems GE under Culp is doing fine and this selling phase will look like a lost buying opportunity next week onwards. In any case, it is getting too late to sell on Reverse split news now. At a higher level, RS does not change anything fundamentally and GE will do fine and in longer term, so will share price but RS is bad optics and it seems not convincing enough. Maybe they will change it but otherwise, unless GE comes up with a better plan, we should just vote no. And yes, shareholders will be voting on the proposal. I think it would help to send a note to IR or call at (1)617 443 3400 expressing disapproval. Any number of reasons as expressed in other conversations can be used. I can't post the IR email as Yahoo removes the post but is easily available on GE site."
Cannot believe GE is only a few big companies are down today when the indexes are up big. The bears attack GE badly. They tried to create a technical bearish pattern so that the short term traders to dump their shares. Unbelievable!
No doubt... Tomorrow is the mind blowing day for new holder...
GE is really going in the right direction. The airline industry is now a bonus because it will soon start booming again. GE in my opinion will hit in the $20’s by the end of the year.
Explain exactly how Culp still has a job?
"I AM VOTING YES ON RS. Here is why: They are thinking outside of the box, why not do something different. They don't have to RS, they want to, The sell off is all psychological because we have all been taught that RS's are when companies risk being delisted. GE doesn't even come close to that. I believe that GE and institutions are smarter than me so I will trust their vote. They are the ones that will decide, not retailer like your and me. There is nothing for anyone to gain or lose ""immediately"" upon an RS, it's simply a different number of shares with the same overall value. What is their exact reason for an RS, I don't know, could be to reduce volatility, maybe they buy back stock after frightening holders into selling driving the price down. I don't know, but everyone (except a small # of shorts) want the stock to go up, so why do a RS ?. There has got to be a hidden, underlying reason somewhere. NOTHING has changed recently except the recent aerospace sale announcement. FCF and revenue forecasts look good, if interest rates rise, that will help with pension obligations, and they don't need to borrow money. Personally, I think they are on their way to nice growth and a nice dividend increase."
"Let’s see if we can reach $13.50+ today! I’m guessing after JPOW speaks, everything should get a nice boost. The sell off on treasury news is not justified and just an overreaction. "
Buy more GE is on sale going higher
la la la :)
"Well timed announcement to clean up most of the deep in the money March 19 Call Options.. They did this ( 15% haircut) in January as well. .Clear skies,ahead after next week. load up $12 ( in the money) call options for Jan '22.4"
"They want you to concentrate on the RS but look at the rest of todays announcements. The numbers are dismal and once the RS is approved, they will offer new shares into it. That is how failing businesses roll. It is all they can do. The business isn't doing well. Look at the numbers/projections."
Wasn't his raise tied to share price
Open Monday $11.50-$11.60 - close near $12 - Tuesday crazy time!
I would love to see a 1 dollar up day. I do not remember GE going up a dollar in recent history.
Take profits while you can this no doubt is going down town
Not sure why we’re up but I like it!
SHORT SELLERS are in control ......................target is forSINGLE DIGITS..................................
"If you invest in GE, you will not go wrong. Look at our market cap"
Go watch the Harry Makapolis' (forensic accountant) videos and read his research on GE....He claims GE is like Enron and Worldcom combined!
5% outstanding stock sold in 2 days equals 14% stock drop. retailers need to get the heck out soon so this baby can finally take off!!
BAC has not reached pre reverse split price level since it happened nearly a decade ago. Not fond of them
buy to cover 1/5 GE short +$2.11
I’m ready to talk about breaking up GE. GE’s break up value is probably north of $30 per share. Maybe JP Morgan could talk about it.
who are going to line up in upgrading $GE this week? should cross $15 in next few weeks.
ok I get 500 shares at $104 ill take it.
7% GDP this year. Why would anybody sell GE?
I can't believe this complete mess is still in business.
low 20s predicted for 2022its moving in the right direction I don't mind the wait
"BUYING OPPORTUNITY! Nothing has changed with respect to this company's prospects. At the end of the day, you either believe what management is doing or you don't. If not, get lost. We don't need ya! I think it was good timing from a momentum perspective to announce - right after many upgrades from Wall Street and the GECAS deal which will help reduce their debt and put them in a better position. This is a strategic move to keep the company in more stable hands. I'm in."
GE needs higher volume to be able to breakout from here. Today’s moving higher is index effect. Market makers will make it drop below $11.5 if the index moves lower. Be patient!
"With all the negative comments, I have to admit I regret I did not buy more at 7. Don’t know how the RS will turn out therefore would not buy more now, but the deal makes GE more and more what I want it to see and why I bought it... It’s an industrial conglomerate, more and more focused on its core"
"Slowly but surely GE will be back to 30. As covid clears, GE revenue will get a big boost"
Go UP GE a good turnaround story!!!New CEO will get this UP!!!!
massive put buying
Would be nice for some positive movement today
Morgan Stanley just kicked #$%$ Tusa right in the nvts!!!!! LOL!!!! I can only imagine that Tusa's boss at JPM is chasing Tusa around the office with a big switch in his/her hand like my mom did to me all the time when I acted a fool. Funny visual!!!!
When shorts start covering we see $12.50 !!!
"At the proposed split of 1 for 8, the quarterly dividend should increase from 1 to 8 cents. Officially, this split brings the share price in line with peers, but it could also be used to bolster FCF as the dividend could be reduced by another 7/8ths without eliminating it completely."
HOLDING STRONG through Earnings. I think we have the Best CEO (Culp) in place to take GE MUCH higher.

"The countdown continues as we march to GE's presentation on January 31, 2019. In 17 days GE reports 2018 Q4 earnings and Larry Culp presents his turnaround plan containing how GE will deliver on the $420,000,000,000 order backlog ($94,000,000,000 for Power segment), the pension risk reduction of over $7,200,000,000 due to the Fed tax rate increases, the schedule for completing the Transportation sale to Wabtec and shares delivered to current GE share holders, the schedule for spinning off GE Healthcare and the shares delivered to current shareholders, the value of the recent Iraq Power deal ($15,000,000,000), and too many more positives to mention.

GE WILL use the STOCK SHARE PRICE after REVERSE SPLIT TO BUY new companies -- GUESS WHAT WILL HAPPEN --- U KNOW EVERYTIME A COMPANY BUY A COMPANY THE STOCK PRICE WILL GO DOWN WHEN GE ANNOUNCE A NEW BUY USING THE NEWLY REVERSE SHARES ...!!!!!!! LOL then who will be losing money again deeper n have to wait LONGER
"General Electric is selling off its aircraft leasing business, closing the books on its once mighty GE Capital unit, the financial arm of the company that had been its largest business and one of the world's most dominant financial institutions.GE is selling the aircraft leasing business known as GECAS to rival AerCap (AER), an Ireland-based company that will become by far the largest company in that industry with an estimated 25% to 30% share of the market. GE will receive $24 billion in cash and stock that will give it about a 46% stake in the combined company.The company plans to use proceeds to reduce its debt load by about $30 billion, part of a multi-year effort to slash $70 billion of debt from its balance sheet. It is the latest and among the most dramatic steps GE is taking to reshape and slim down the now struggling company.GECAS, which buys aircraft and leases them to airlines and other operators, had been providing most of the revenue for the GE Capital unit. But sales fell about 20% last year as the Covid-19 pandemic caused a plunge in air travel and massive losses across the airline industry. GECAS' cash-starved airline customers paid only about 84% of the unit's invoices in 2020. It resulted in a $786 million loss for 2020 after a $1 billion profit in 2019."
Looks good for a run to 13
I will buy after every ones earnings are finished market will shed 30% before next quarter from this Santanic President
Wall street trying its best to keep our ascent collared. It will fail. Buy.
"Haha.. JPM should replace Tuss with someone that can call it right... So far, I am spot on and to those who listened to Tusa should now listen to me. I upgraded GE to strong buy with $13 target before end of Feb, Tusa held the line to sell at $5 target. I had reiterated my strong buy and lifted the target price to $14, Tusa stayed disappeared.. I reiterated my position with strong buy and lifted my target price to $16... I still have not heard from Tusa, I feel bad for his followers for the huge losses. I feel great for those who followed me, and made huge money keeping faith in my assessment vs. Tusa !!! My advice now is to buy GE calls for $15 June, $15 for Jan 22, $17 Jan 23... Create the Culp-trend line. Hold for 30 days for sold upward momentum, roll June $15 calls into Jan $17, wait for till Sept-Oct and start building your 2023 long position. One more thing, Tusa no more.. Yes for Turin !!"
"when you are powerless, and small, and you invest in long and short positions in the market... what can you do to influence the price of a stock? what is a small man to do? the floats are huge and the prices are controlled by the institutions...... hmmmdon't go on Yahfool! message boards and bash the stock. that will do NOTHING to a company like GE."
GE will finish day n the green......Buying opportunity.....
"Your forgetting their debt, the loss of those businesses when things pick up. GE kept jumping into everything they could including wind generators. You need to look at their 10Q and see the bottom line net earnings after expenses. I be back with figures and the latest data."
Maybe they are just shaking the tree with this news.
Reverse splits badFor ge to do this means stock will have problems rising. Big mistake No confidence is what Culp is sayingAdios bagholders
Reverse split is comming Ge just announced
If your a long holder from 2009 you must be scratching your head how you possibly could have made nothing in a 12 year bull market..
Don't Worry... Be Happy!!! 
"Just read a story about Larry Culp's pay package, I missed it back in August, regarding how GE modified the price the stock needs to reach for him to get a $200m+ bonus, now set at $16.67 per share. First bonus was at $10 per share for $40m+. My money is that it will get to this price no matter what. Already laying off thousands of workers and as the recovery continues in aviation this will drop to the bottom line. I can't imagine any CEO that wouldn't want that kind of payoff. That is all one really needs to know to bet on the stock."
We fought hard for 2 months for 11 and won. Now we will fight hard and land this ship on 12 for February and possibly break 13. This end of month lull is a perfect time to build up your dry powder. Keep on buying!
Auspicious day': WestJet returns grounded Boeing MAX 737 to the skies
if it holds just below 10 could form a great chart pattern--one that is very reliable
maybe sluggish price of GE is the result of Boeing is in the position of losing a third of its orders due to delay of delivery of 777 aircraft. Ge supplies engines for this aircraft???
"A recovery in commercial aviation combined with margin improvement in power, renewable energy, and healthcare equipment sales is the recipe for success that GE investors will be hoping for 2021. Fortunately, GE is a company set to benefit from the coronavirus vaccine and investors have cause to believe significant progress on earnings and cash flow will take place.For a company that has been around since the 1800s . From Renewable energy, Healthcare and Aviation GE is definitely a big player"
"Not to get too cocky but... Opps you fell for it again... you sold your position and it climbing back up becuase Oh OPPS you did it again... and now the recovery way back above 14....""Analysts are growing more optimistic about the industrial titan as its turnaround strategy progresses."""
"ge improving numbers In 2021, the company expects to earn about 20 cents a share and generate roughly $3.5 billion in free cash flow. That compares with 1 cent in per-share earnings and $600 million in free cash flow generated this past year"
"Buying more GE first thing on Monday.Adding to my position in GBK, too."
"When the news came out this morning, I ran to my computer and by the time I was selling my 50 shares not underwater they were falling already. So I sold only 25 hoping to get a better price later? Not to be, it went down and kept going down. 6pm now and it is still going down. We did not even vote yet. Looking back, I remember Cramer putting a gold star on Meltdown on everything he said. Then, when it started to fall, Cramer said it would go to $28. A few days later, he said $26, then $22, then $18, etc., etc."
"GE LONGS ,,, TECHNICAL ANALYSIS IS SWELF SERVING ,, THE MORE SIMPLE A CHART IS AND THE FORMATION CAN BE SEEN BY A MORON,, THEN IT IS VERY LIKE TO OCCUR ,,, THE ONE YEAR CHART IS PERFECT EXAMPLE OF A BOWL AND HANDLE ,, CHECK FOR YOURSELF ,, THIS IS TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 101 ,,, THE RESISTANCE IS MODERATELY AT 13.68 , AND THE TARGET IS 18-20 BY THE NEXT QUARTER .. GOOD LUCK TOMORROW ,, CAVIAT ,, THE HANDLE CAN EXTEND ANOTHER QUARTER BUT BIG THINGS ARE COMING IN THE NEXT 6 MONTHS AND HOPEFULLY SOONER .."
Blue energy isn't profitable and likely may never be so I wouldn't count on GE to be interested in buying Fcel or Plug or something. GE is interested in becoming more more profitable and streamlining and not getting bogged down into bottomless pits of never ending losses such as Plug fcel etc
Buy and hold tight for ride to $20
African politicians in this country are activists only concerned about one thing... there own power and people.
Larry Culp is one of the most admired CEO's in the world and we have him leading GE back to sustainable health! I am so glad the board promoted him to this demanding role.
"Here is something to watch carefully.With the news just announced that General Electric was moving half the GE Capital sales for 2020 to AerCap of Ireland, it may remove $4 billion of GE Capital sales on a $10 billion total volume in 2020.And it would also remove the GE loss on their balance sheet of $785 million on the $1.8 billion loss for GE capital in 2020.It would also remove GE borrowing $5 billion to support GE Capital (GECAS is their leasing aircraft portfolio in General Electric).What does all this mean.. Unless you really understand GE Capital as a stand alone unit - it is impossible to understand the effect on General Electric.But there are three things known for sure..... It will cut the GE debt by at least $5 billion. It will cut the inter-company loans between GE and GE Capital which has always been totally confusing.and It will definitely remove as much as $1.8 billion loss in 2020 from the FCF on the GE balance sheet.It is a lot of Harry Houdini I am sure - but to the analysts and the public anything to make the GE balance sheet simpler and anything to remove a negative FCF from the GE Capital division is positive for the GE price.And don't expect any help from the Stephen Tusa JP Morgan bear who is predicting a $5 stock or any other analyst. They a pathetic. All they can scream is too much debt, too little Free Cash Flow, not diversified enough since they have sold off lots and shrunk the company, and now Tusa's ridiculous statement that he is worried about a totally acceptable 81% pension funding. I am convinced they have never read the 10K quarterly filings. One lady analyst in December even said on The Street on TV that trying t understand GE financials is just too complicated for her. She doesn't read them!That is the poor quality you are relying on to handle your money and your investments. Pitiful..The next question will be the new Free Cash Flow number for 2021 and how the Wednesday March 10th conference will present their projectionsPerhaps the announcement a month ago the the FCF would be $2.5 to $4.5 billion was accurate then.But does that mean the next Culp prediction this week will now be adding the $1.8 billion GE Capital loss into his thinking and therefore making the new FCF now a $4.5 to $6.5 billion for this year?Remember when you are working with a $75 billion sales for 2020 company that was recently $100 billion in yearly sales in 2018 - it takes very little to return the company to over a dollar a share profit. Part is actual earning and part is just plain how you report the sales and costs. I business we call it the cut line or how the results for the quarter and year re accounted for.Add to that the potential for upward pricing Renewables, and power, and the normal understatement by Culp in predicting results - this could be a game changer. It could put the profit FCF potentially at maybe $7 billion or more and that would mean around $0.80 a share.At 8o cents a share - and using the very conservative 20 times earnings would translate into $16 a share and at 25 times earning it would easily come in at $20 stock price sometime mid 2021.So the AerCap announcement is really a dynamite blast if it means what I think it means.Culp is removing losers from his balance sheet and that makes the stock power upward.So this deal is very mysterious but it appears to move GE into a far better space with GE capital and GECAS - their airplane leasing division. It remove the 1,600 aircraft presently financed by GE on their balance sheet."
"I hope that everyone contacts GE investor relations to protest the proposed reverse stock split, an accounting gimmick to get an unearned increase in the stock price. Larry Culp's proposal has been rubber stamped by his board of directors. I wonder how many millions of dollars were paid to financial advisors, lawyers, accountants to get approval of this nonsense?"
$15. Today
I've said it before; GE always stumbles at almost exactly the $100 billion market cap; grab a chunk if it gets back around the price of a foot-long sub.
GE = Enron
$15 on wed
What is this?!... Green on a Friday and then a follow up with a green Monday and a green Tuesday?! 
10.50 closing today
"Culp said Q1 cash flow would likely be negative, BUT IMPROVED from a year ago; outlook for 2021 unchanged.Sorry for anyone that reacted. Really not news. Someone really seems to be pushing the negative here."
Good time to buy here...IMO
watch GE landslide from time to time until reverse splits day
"Oh man, this terd is being purchased by murons like @Nasis and Lisa and Cap -r"
the covered return on the 10.5p is 86% return at .20. I want more!
This is the kind of decision that takes the company down the toilet 1/8 RS are they comparing GE to Apple  GE stock should drop $2 then they can do 1/8 RS
Smart money knows where to go. The company's potential is huge. It's sad what previous CEOs have done to this company. Now it seems that this company is on the way to shine again.$ 20 by mid-year.
GE_to$4 How are you. Please don´t hesitate on giving your opinion and new impresions. Looking forward.
jj is the only bad news here.please join me to say goodbye to jj and send him to muted island. That was easy.
Lets hope 12.00 is the bottom
"Offical start of the long Bear Market: Jan 20, 2021...."
"GE Shares are currently under Valued with Upgrades coming in faster than Bill Clinton can take off his pants for an Intern...Morgan Stanley analyst Joshua Pokrzywinski lifted his price target on GE by $4, to $17 per share -- well ahead of the Wall Street average of around $12.30 -- while maintaining his overweight rating on the industrial group as GE prepares for its March 10 investor day presentation. Current price target should be $20.00. Keep bringing more Good Things to Life...."
GE still owns 200 mil shares of Baker Hughes worth 4.2 Bil.
"I think overall today is neutral, probably will close slightly red at the end of the day. Just hopefully there isn't an aggressive short attack. Overall is relatively unstable until ER. just personal thoughts."
$13 is a huge break point!
jj just bought more ge shares at 12.12 I think jj you will not see this price at the end of April
somebody inside GE.. please send Culp the link to the conversations here.11.75 today?
Jeffrey Email is related to Jeffrey Epstein￼
Very exciting to see GE hit 12 early in morning trading session but as time went it was obvious that excitement of results did not hold. GE needs Buffet to validate opportunity for long term increase or validation by investing in this great company again
Reverse split they have to with billions of shares out there stock won’t ever move youNeed 2 billion traded to buy to move up 10-25. Cents Now it will move in $
jim cramer hyped them just now
$12 coming
"Well, I guess today is the end of JJ. I’m gonna miss him."
"Buy all dips especially the big ones like last week. Debt reduction, maintaining equity, the return of power and aviation are huge catalysts. $20 possible this year. Buy."
"Today is ridiculous! GE stock is selling for peanuts....Nothing could please me with the reverse stock split.It will get rid of the 175 million share swings like today. A higher stock will stop the incredible up and down ""bouncing"" - as much as 8% in a day.and it will definitely get rid of the pranksters like JJ on this board who are NOT investing since none of them will buy stock over $100.How could a company that has paid over $75 billion in reducing debt and almost extinguished long term debt over the past 36 months be in a dive like today.We are like a banana republic. Small minded and with no idea what they want. Our public unskilled stock buying crowd is in a temper tantrum. Don't get your way - scream.Don't like higher priced stocks - take the stock into a dive.This is totally irrational behavior.... Today I agree this should have been a win-win day. All the GE conference news was positive.The stock should have shot through the roof - but it is in a funk.Longer term nothing has changed and any serious investor will make out.Short sellers may be suffering today but the regular investor is ok.About the split. It is appropriate to take the stock in the $104 price range (8x$13). It still is much lower than Honeywell, 3m, Caterpillar, and a lot of others. At $104 there is plenty for room to double and triple - much like Microsoft, Boeing, and Raytheon to name a few.With the stock higher priced it may allow a return to a modest dividend going forward in a year. ."
I think the RS will also be great because of what is happening right now. What’s your opinion?
Load upAnd buy the dip
"Yep makes no sense GME , plug even AMC What the fudge"
"If GE goes back to $14 per share, it will be a slap to bad investors. Watch and learn. I am telling you this, GE is only getting better. Shorts? Nevermind."
Truly an unbelievable stunt by Culp..
GE will pass over $11 by today. even pass $12 tomorrow
Getting in under $12 could be my best knife grab of the year
Don’t panic hedge funds are selling their longs to cover their shorts.
Bought for dividend alone!!! 
"For those saying this is a good idea, just remember that the average investor won't buy GE at over $100 a share and the market knows it by the -5% today. I understand the reasoning, as they are about to gain millions of shares and it will further increase their market shares, but it will make GE look like a better stock than it is at this point and it will likely fall a lot more after the split. Reverse splits are a sign of a company struggling to stay afloat by making their stock look more expensive. All I know is they better adjust the dividend to .32 as well and once healthy, better get it up to $2 a share or more (per year)."
It seems like GE has had a slow decline Monday through Thursday and a big increase on fridays as options expire I will be interested to see if this recovers tomorrowBeen a rough week though
Higher interest rates are going to help ge on there retirement balance sheets
When will this split take place?
"Nice that the analysts are recognizing the strength of this dealBut on Monday, bullish analysts from UBS, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America came to the company's defense, extolling the merits of the Gecas deal and GE's cash position."
Its GE's turn now isn't it?
"I bought in 200 shares at 3:58pm. Then after hours I sold all my shares of $GE because they announced a possible Reverse Split. It's 65 degrees in Virginia, I got my first COVID shot last week, and things are looking up! :-)With any luck, tomorrow I will sell my shares of $AMC and make enough to see a movie in a theater. :-)"
As they say... Hoping/Wishing and Guessing are all bad investment strategies..
"When the effect of the stimulus money wears off, the market and this stock will be struck by a wave of selling."
Winners don’t come often when you are out there in the wild world of the markets. But all that can change if you join the right program. I joined up with these guys (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Now I am having solid picks every week.
"Any updates on the split? Hot topic for a couple of days, now all is quiet."
"if you really love GE that much sell it, buy back after the RS is complete. Save yourselves money and heartache"
Can I say that a reverse split is an almost lauphable idea....makes the stock a short target and smaller investors will also have a harder time selling covered calls as 100 shares will require a larger capital outlay...Also accumulation of a few shares every once in awhile is lost....bad Idea!
Expecting a slow upward crawl in to earnings with the PR machine cranking up Pre and Post.
Citigroup have been trading sideways since the 10 for 1 reverse split. It was a bad idea then and now.
"But while the coronavirus pandemic continues to pressure GE's flagship aviation business early in 2021, the conglomerate is seeing overall momentum.reason for some optimism"
GE.. to many outstanding shares to manipulate.... sell the news before earnings.
Dividend to one penny? Interesting.
FCC needs to step in and put a stop to short selling or at least limit the number of shares available for short selling..... this is the biggest scam and it actually destroys companies
Are you happy now.
"A Little Common Sense is needed now....Lets take a look at General Electric Free Cash Flow for the past 5 yearsThere a basically 4 areas of FCF that GE can make a real profit.It need to make $8.8 billion of 2021 to be at $1 a share profit which would translate into a $20 stock at a 20 times earnings pe ratioAviation FCF has hovered at around $5.34 billion (2016), $5.34 billion (2017), $6.46 billion (1918), $6.82 billion (2019, and $2.44 billion (2020).Health FCF has hovered at around $3.10 billion (2016), $3.48 billion (2017), $3.7 billion (2018), $3.9 billion (2019) and was only $3.1 billion (after Bio Pharma sale in 2020)Renewables FCF has hovered at around $631 million (2016), $583 million (2017), $287 million (2018), $-666 loss (2019), and $-715 loss (2020) Power has hovered at around $4.19 billion (2016), $1.95 billion (2017), (-808 million (loss 2018), $386 million (2019), and $274 million (2020)Something to consider. Renewables had losses in 2018and 2019 when they were spending $500 million creating and improving in their wind turbines in their plants. They have perfected the radical game changing Halaide 13W and installed a test model in Rotherdam. If they had not spent that $500 million money their figures would be close to a break even. For my part - I am all for the expense if it leads to progress and profit.The point of all the above is to see that s the world returns to pre pandemic it is not a far reach for GE to achieve their $8.8 billion FCF this year in 2021 and the stock to return to $20 a share.You can add to that three things.Payroll was halved, GE now tops anyone in renewables and there fore will be profitable going forward at perhaps 5% to 8%, and Aviation has a lot of existing and very stable military and commercial engine service contracts to keep them profitable - not to mention Rolls Royce and Pratt & Whitney are seriously wounded financially and reputation going forward.Also three other important changes are the reduction of long term debt, the taking control of GE Capital and reducing that independent part of the company's exposure, and also important definitely getting a reduction on paying into their pension fund more money to get them at least 81% funded.And lastly the management change has given General Electric a whole new culture and direction. Culp underpromises and over performs. I love the surprises that proel the stock up a point or more.What can anyone subtract from the above numbrs and direction to prove to me that GE's future is not only a $20 stock - but more likely in 2022 a $30 stock as they improve their Free Cash Flow."
"When jj, chickens, F and dewd were shoring GE @ 6.25, I was backing up the truck. BEEP BEEP BEEP. 100% again! Three times in the past 3 years. Thank you shorty clowns! I have your money."
"I have been through a few R/S. It never benefits shareholders. Now, splits, always benefit shareholders. GE used to do those."
no more buyers
up trend line here. Probably bounce off it. See if it holds. Nice action though!
How could GE Management not reverse their decision?? This is a blood bath that will only get worse. They need to change their minds now!!

Another 25 cents upside early in the morning. Watch it disappear by the closing time. A pattern of over a month long. Unable to hold any small amount of gain.
Person at work went to Florida - I asked how much space they had jokingly figuring they had 10 seats to themselves - they said plane was full - there and back - recovery is in process folks.
We need analyst upgrades now.

Anybody know the short interest on GE?
playing with 12.00 like a 2 year old!
Tusa is genius. As he predicted GE $5-6 2021 then we have to expect a major stock market collapse of the this year. Otherwise how he could be a genius?
Book value of 4.06. I don’t think it is the right time to get In. Overvalued in my opinion. Thoughts?
"Guys, I think sticking to the Wall Street shorts is the right thing to do. For too long this has been a manipulated market. I am definitely concerned that some of you will be left with nothing.Do the trade, but don’t get emotionally attached to a trade. Get out and take your profits and invest them into actual companies with assets who pay dividends.Think $GE $XOM $CVX $HD $GEL $ET there’s a ton of very good companies out there. Don’t get too attached to options and being over leveraged. GROWTH IS NOT A VIABLE BUSINESS PLAN WITHOUT PROFITS AND CASH FLOW. Please remember this - get into good companies with profitable well run businesses."
"What's up GE ????? Having Another doomed down day?...Market from one end, shorts and hedge fund managers from the other end with the HELP of a not so famous analyst are trying to rip you apart and force you to fall..HA HA HA...They soon going to wake up and realize you are A 125 year old strong company and could not be brought down this easily at least not when a great man like CULP is behind the wheel...viva GE...go GE go....."
close will send this below 13
I’m surprised to see that it’s not back in green by end of day
WAY UP ON ON MY 13 CALL COOL NEVER SEE 13 AGAIN
GE to b featured on options action tonight
"so much enthusiasm on this board, will see where share value settles."
As the song says....Don't Worry....Be Happy ! 
"watch for 150 million share volume day as ""Shorts"" run for cover"
Some more clowns died today.
All GE purchasers now get Dividend if they hold till Ex-Dividend date... could explain some of the added interest in purchase/demand today. Especially Bad timing for shorts over next few days.
Great closing. $13 open tomorrow!
"Don't kid yourself GE's Management designed this 1 for 8 reverse split to shake off the retail investor, the very one's that saved them from going under. They don't deserve your loyalty to ride them thru this nightmare. They offer you 1 share for every 8, for your blood sweat and tears!! No buy back!! No increase of dividend!!!"

Two days all small investors bailed out and shares mostly with Big holders. They will not sell and will squeeze it hard. And after reverse split will jump even more as leaps of 10 plus points will be easy with less float as co.pay fundaments are still.sme and infact improved incomes and reduced debt. Shorts after reverse split will be gasping for more oxygen and will eventually sell at way higher prices and book lpsses
GE shares are falling pre market! This is due to the reverse split news! Long term share holders will get crushed!
Looking good! Hoping we can get over 12 next week!
Windmills failing all over due to extreme cold. Will cost BIG $$$$$ to fix. Not good sign.
Did GE ounce stock split ?
Larry Culp needs to come out NOW and say the reverse split idea was a mistake and they misjudged investor sediment about it and decided to no longer consider it and save our investment in GE.. be genuine and do it!!! Please!! To much at stake for something that does nothing to change good fundamentals!
Now that GE is generating cash and has trimmed down itself. Also there are more pieces to the puzzle which can be spun off and also the future looks brighter I ask can the potential for a buyer to come in and make an offer to buy the company. Wait and see
"If you are long term investors, this is a great opportunity to accumulate. What caused this wave of dropped? 1. Bears use the reverse split as excuse to make the first push, shorted the stock.2. Short term traders who bought GE last week saw the short term up trend momentum damaged, sold their shares to take profits.3. Technical program traders saw the pattern breaking down 10-moving average also joined to short the stock.If you listen to the conference call, all are positive news. I am gain more confidence after I saw the GE’s price movement quickly moved from $12 to $14.5 last week. It made me believe GE is alive again. GE could reach $16 due to the trend momentum if the company didn’t announce the reverse split. This has temporarily caused the up trend to trade sideways in short term. With GE’s recovery is in progress, the up trend momentum will come back. When that comes, nothing will stop it go higher. GE will be best stock which positions for next few year’s recovery. Thus, accumulate some cheap shares during this wave of drop."
Full steam ahead now. I want that 12 dollars printed.
Sell because of a reverse split? LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
If it passes 14.25... drinks are on me....
"For those of you scoring at home, GE is up 1D, 5D, 1 month, YTD, 6M and 1Y."
"Starting to move back up. Also shareholders will vote no to reverse split. That was pretty much clear. All shareholders want more investors to hold GE stock so there will be no reverse splits. Now, $20 is new target price."
GE is Wild today
This guy is delusional. The stock went from $51 to $20 under his leadership. Culp is 20 times the CEO he was. He is a #$%$ and should pay back all the money he stole from investors. I used to work for GE Power. That unit should be making money hand over fist. Culp is righting the ship as we speak. https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/22/ex-ge-ceo-jeff-immelt-says-wholly-unhappy-with-story-around-my-tenure.html
"Short Call options, or buy Put options. GE will be in single digit before Jan 15."
I just bought in yesterday morning for the first time and glad I did. I've been following GE for quite some time and kicking myself for not getting in sooner. I like the businesses GE is into. I'm in for the long haul and feel GE is poised for a nice comeback.
"As aviation begins its climb back, why are you selling the lease business? Typical GE move."
Volumes goes and goes ....
It can not seem to break through that 10.82 markWould be nice to close above that mark
Does anyone know how the split works beyond the 1 for 8? Is it at preset determined way ahead of the actual transaction. Or the market price at day of split actually occurs?
All the bears are the ones that got scared yesterday and sold and regret it
Investors having unclarity of this RS proposal obviously...will take time to digest...hear Culp talk soon.
"last chance to BUY under $12........................................with vaccination going full force, travel will resume strongly soon...BA production increase will start sending orders and leasing panes over to GE....and as Cramer said this will take GE to about $15 pps.....My guess is as early as mid MAR we should see this happen"
This is an opportunity to load up for more shares. Will not have reverse split. This is a fake test to get price down to do a buy back. Board and shareholders will not approve RS.
"Greta Thunberg should be giggly - SAS orders an order of BA planes with $ 2.9B worth of Leap1A engines & Luxcara orders 137 GE Cypress wind turbines with 753 MW capacity. Not Green enough... well then there’s 200 MW worth of LM2500Express units to replace a coal plant due to retire, then over by Singapore, it’ll be two 9HA-02 gas turbines for a combined cycle 1400 MW plant, which is capable of operating on 50% H2..."
"What happened, why down? Not worried thou, this will surely go up "
8 to 1 rs doesn’t look good.The question is who is gonna buy at the moment?
6-10% up with in 3 days
4.37 Billion free cash flow on an estimate of 2.5. That is HUGE!!
$20 is coming sometime this year. Weak hands should not sell.
All I can say is I wish I put more in this. But at least I’m up 10%. We’ll see 20$ real soon!
"The deal is great. The stock would have gone way up on that deal, the revere split 8 for1 does not look good and the timing for the split is not right, this is why the stock sold."
"Can anybody explain why GE’s CEO can negotiate to lower down his stock bonuses price from $18 per share to $6 per share? When GE stock price was dropped to $6, he negotiated his price so did all the board director’s stock price. When the stock gets back to $18, he will get a stock bonus of >=$210 million. How corrupted the company still is! If GE’s drops to $1, he could negotiate get the price at $1. That might be the reason why the ceo Culp and the board didn’t care the stock price to drop since he and the board can negotiate and get their stock assigned at low price. This just doesn’t sound right to me. If Culp is a great ceo, he should stick to the performance measure he initially was given. The people who bought the the stock at $18 will just recover his price to breakeven."
"The good news is after the initial drop in price, it held the line for the most part for the rest of the day. The RS is only a possibility at this point. It has to be approved by shareholders and it is months away. I think a 4 for 1 RS is better than an 8 to 1. But overall, whether one gets a wallet of 10 five dollar bills or a wallets with a 50 dollar bill, its the same amount of money."
Holding up nicely on such a bad day
They could have bought back stock instead but maybe need cash to expand clean energy business
FIRE LARRY CULP!
"Don't fret too much on GE debt levels/valuation measures, the balloning addressable-market (EV, turbines, infrastructure build, etc) more than compensates for the high debt load ... plus they've been active on the debt reduction front ... near-term horizon is very positive IMHO"
Lots of cheerleaders on here happy the stock took a dip. It's also a great opportunity to buy the dip also. $GE to $24 this year can be done!
"Folks if the decision of RS materials, the shorts will take us down. Since yesterday the short interest have spiked. Taking it down below $10 will ruin it all and the idea of RS will be done easier. Say NEY to RS. Reddit to Rescue."
$21 price target!
"Governor of Texas should resign immediately. He failed to contain COVID and has been a failure with energy and environmental policy. Companies should move out of Texas. Musk should reconsider Tesla plans now, Texas is a basket case led by a gOP that believes in hoaxes. Time to turn Texas BLUE again!"
"At first reporting, Aviation24.be wrote about a left-hand engine fault, but the story is more complex. Simon Hradecky from The Aviation Herald explains: “There was no engine fault as such. There was a hydraulic fault in the left engine system, but the engine continued to run, and the crew wanted to continue to destination. But then they received a fuel imbalance and decided to shut the engine down according to QRH (no engine fault, but the suspicion of a fuel leak).”"
GE is well positioned for clean energy. This year might be a turning point for GE. It reminds me of AMD.
"Reverse split success stories. BKNG, LH, AVXL, C"
A trading buddy asked me the other day about GE and where I got the pick. I told her to check out (http://Thetraderguide.com). That’s where I get 95% of my winners.
"Someone said it here, Citi thought reverse split was a great idea in 2011 at $5 or so. A 10 for 1 reverse split was executed. Citi stock has never gone above $8 since then. That was 10 years ago. Meanwhile BAC and other financials have recovered nicely. Citi is still stuck under $8."
I can’t believe Robinhood Investors sold their GE to run off and play a Ponzi Scheme. They could stay here and get rich slowly. Go figure.
"wait until they GE consolidate shares RS, and only BIG, Wealthy would buy, than GE will come out from the dark to give more dividends - and 99.9% of the investors here will disappear."
A reverse split will kill any short term profits. The stock will have trouble rising from here.
"Have fun ""SHORTS"" we shareholders will be buying with you covering"
I am starting to think this does look like a good short right here
Tomorrow $14+
Looks like 20 is the new target should get past 15 soon!
"So with a reverse split ,I wonder if the token dividend will stay at 1 cent a share even with 1/8 the share count .This would save GE another 300 million a year also."
1/25th normal daily volume computes to drop of 1.5% makes sense...
"I decided to sell my GE and purchase more WFC. Hate the losses, but think WFC is a better long and short term investment. Good luck to all those remaining."
Here is an update Culp vs Tusa Culp $11.55 Tusa $5.00Have a great week Longs.
BRING IT ON! TREASURY YIELDS CONTINUE TO GO UP! MUSIC TO MY EARS!
Before I buy Ge I would ask myself . Do you think the stock might drop lower ?
20 more cents and I will have yet another 5 grand! that's 20 grand I've made from going long in GE since 7 bucks so once again that leaves me to believe THEY ARE BROKE!
We should clear this up once and for all GE has too low of a short float to be squeezed like GME. If we had 100x volume then yes but at %1 short float it’s not likely
looks good ... wind power GE... key word electric.... air travel engines.... what's not to like......

Great close! Next week will be excellent!
We are down over $2 since the reverse split was announced. I hope most people vote NO. We were doing okay all along. What are they not telling us?
"Should be a good day for longs tomorrow, based on Fridays AH, and positive articles over the weekend."
Guys GEs quarter earnings were good. But everyone is looking at one sector and saying not so much. There was a big buy order placed just recently
It was nice to see how much resistance GE had to the market sell-off. I see it as a good sign that this will snap back hard.
GE strong like bull!
Let’s climb AH and PM tomorrow to line up a huge day tomorrowWould love to see 14 again this week
When I saw R/S...... I immediately thought...... OK...... 1/2 or may be 1/4 max. Not 1/8. NO.
"Holding and buying, original purchase from $6 sold some at $10.50 & 14.20 .Now replenishing to 6k shares."
Besides selling parts of the company what has Mr. Culp done? Maybe we should have kept Flanigan and avoided the generous comp package.
sell sell sell. GE is unfaithful now since bad news for reverse splits that losing your shares.

"GE will be selling and getting paid for a lot of engines, and engine hours. The next report will show...The institutional investors are simply trying to shake shares and fees from loose hands. GE will show higher percentage performance than BA over the next two years. Plus they makes the F-15EX engines...And have been talking to Airbus, there’s a paradigm shift... it’s been 14-years since they put engines (or talked with) on an Airbus. I heard."
"I think there are a few things that could move the shares higher, but none as important as buying back a large amount of shares. GE has been in a down sizing mode for the last few years (much needed) causing revenue to come down as well. So the question is what is the best way to spend the dollar to increase the value of GE shares? With billions of shares in a shrinking company and the stock so low in price, now is the best time to buy back like 250 million shares at a minimum. The future will only cost more, and it will send a message that the balance sheet will be stronger causing the share price to increase........Anything else like paying down debt, raising dividend , buying other companies, which may cause the price to increase just means it will cost millions or billions more in the future. Please Mgt. lets not make the same old mistakes with the new GE. Maybe that should be the new add meet the new GE, its not your fathers GE, lets hope!!!"
This will never hit $14.00! Too many profit takers. Kiss this!

"As far as the split, it still has to be approved by the shareholders, right? If they don't approve it fine. If they do approve it I'm sure they believe it is a good move.It's amazing how many people on this site think they are smarter than and know more than Larry Culp."

Hey everyone! I see JJ shorted 10K at $13.21 today.
Rite Aid did a 20-1 reverse split. Before split it would move 0.25 or 0.50 in a day. Now it moves at most $1 per day which is 0.05! At $20 Rite Aid looks expensive until you see that it is $ 1 pre split. It will take forever for it to get to some reasonable level. Dont like reverse splits.
Can I see the opening price tomorrow? I am excited for GE
now credit rating companies are chiming in with possible downgrades by a notch
Ge biggest mistake(in History) was TRUSTING in these financial engineers with their financial GIMMICKS. That what destroyed Ge capital and almost destroyed Ge. Stay with the fundamentals of business and forget Wall street's gimmicks of financial engineering.
If they announce split is off... 14 In a week.
From a math point of view it does not make a difference on company value reverse slit or a split that adds share to the count but from a share marketing position almost all reverse splits reduce market cap and almost all splits that put more shares into the market move the stock up. This is a fact. Knowing this makes me wonder what GE has against small share holders. Culp has done an excellent job and from my perspective had a chance to have a $30 share price which from a turnaround from low single digits is remarkable. I take all bets that the stock is a minimum of 5% down by EOM March. In fact I did bet it.
GE 100 day RS rating above 80. That’s extremely bullish and most likely means big gains ahead. 
"$GE CEO Larry Culp knows what he's doing. Buy the dip and as many shares as you can afford. This stock is set to double this year alone at it's current price and double at it's possible R/S price. The new deal is a multi billion dollar cash infusion that will be used to knock down debt while still maintaining a 47% stake. Increased positive cash flow, reduced debt, and now potentially less shares outstanding to be manipulated. I know that there are a lot of other positives that were left out. Hopefully other bullish $GE investors on the board can pick up where I left off."

Is anyone else trying to get some that Wall Street Bets money over here to GE? We sure could use a nudge to get this ship out of the repair bay.
It's too late to undo the split announcement. Damage is done. Telegraphed profit troubles ahead and stock needs downside room.
Reverse split is good for MR Tisa he is having is cake at last

"munger was asked, his thoughts regarding ge ..........he does not own general electric stock, but praises its ceo larry culp, saying 'if anybody can fix it, he can'"
I am close to bailing. This has to be the most fiduciarily irresponsible and lack of situational awareness decision I've ever seen from a company's top brass that was riding HUGE momentum literally hours before said announcement. This is like losing a set on nothing but double fault services and unforced errors.
"Fact Check:Over the last 20 years, GE’s stock GE has dropped by a 3.8% compound annual growth rate, compared with the 8.1% gain for the S&P 500 over the same time frame, according to FactSet Research data.How long are you willing to ride this downbound train?"

What's 2 x $6.25 ? Anyone? Anyone?
For those that keep posting EVERY TIME A REVERSE SPLIT HAPPENSLook up XOP. Reverse split last MarchDoing quite well since
GE management will not retract the RS anytime soon. The lawsuits would crush them.
technically magnetized to the 12 level--heading south
Still up 16% past 30 days and 120% past year. Stocks have their ups and downs pay more attention to fundamentals Not the daily close.
REVERSE SPLITS NEVER BENEFIT SHAREHOLDERS.. END OF STORY
"Don't be fooled this company has a long way to go, and buy below 12.00 don't be a bag holder after the split. Buy cheap and the company will reward you...!!!"
I am accumukating this little company that will have a great precense in the EV future. KULR it makes the use of lithium batteries safe and keeps its casing cool. The technology is used in almost anything that uses lithium batteries. In fact it is currently being use in space by NASA perceverance which will be flaying a drone in space!
Any idea?????? $14 today?
"$20 will happen within few months, book it."
It never fails: As soon as things starts getting better a bad decision and move ruins it all. BAD move Mr Culp. Don’t mess up all your good work. STOP playing with share price and just concentrate on your core business of getting profitable. Stock price will automatically get higher. No need to artificially get it done. Thank you
Lucy = GE ManagementCharlie Brown = InvestorsAny Questions?
ahead of Investor Day Tomorrow Morgan Stanley very bullish
Pitiful stock should be up $1.
Classic trading of Distribution from $11.49 about a month ago.
I have owned ge for the last 8 months and up 43%. I am up 43 % in amc in the last 45 min. Lol
Lets see a continuation thru 12
I think I’m buying 20 contracts for next week 13 call. This price should be significantly lower giving the year they have had. So the new evaluation would be around 20$ if they had another 2019 year.
Give it a week or two. People love round numbers when splits or reverse splits happen. I say $15 by next week. That relates to $120 when reverse split happens. Market is to srttong and with stimulus checks coming will only get stronger.
"Just added another 500 shares, looking to see free cash of 2 billion or better as Culp said we would see this quarter, lets see if he delivers. The stock will jump 2 bucks if its in the numbers....."
A huge amount of today’s volume in the last hour. I hope that is a sign of what will happen when volume returns to normal.
"GE Transportation’s revenue for Q1’18 came in at $872 million (down 11% year-on-year), while the segment’s profits jumped nearly 15% largely due to a higher mix of service volume and lower engineering spend. However, we expect the trend of revenue declines to change in the near future. GE’s Transportation division received nearly $3.6 billion worth of orders in the last two quarters. In addition, the total order backlog for the division stands at approximately $18 billion. This is comprised of 1,800 new locomotives orders and modernization of 1,000 locomotives. As a result, we expect the Transportation EBITDA to come in at around $1.05 billion in 2018. Further, the modernization of nearly 11,400 locomotive units, coupled with the deal to upgrade and build new locomotives for Ukraine should provide significant long-term opportunity"
The most desperate move any company can make. reverse split. Only companies in trouble RS their stocks.

"They are manipulating the comments on the board at the moment to try and spin this reverse split as a positive thing. 1 share for every 8 you buy is not a good thing people, wake up!"
rising US interest rates will allow GE to re-allocate a boat load of money allowing for a faster recovery as they can divert from pension funding requirements - sure to hear more about this from Larry on March 10
being investing / trading for 30 years and have never seen a stock went up after the company announcing RS.
"precursor to a spin off or two, live this ceo why I bought the stock."
how do you get $30B from a company only 10% larger than the assets you sell and you still get on top 46% of that underlying security in the form of stock. sorry makes no sense again on my end. games have started guess you need to read the fine print on the certified financial statement that don't get added to any balance sheets... smells a bit like Enron problems to me.

We've put a few of them in lately, but in this casehe had a 16x9 door, which was a little beyond the side mounts, in myhumble opinion. He said he could send it back, so my Son put in a newdrive gear in the existing opener. 130 bucks is much cheaper than 500+.

"Barron’s: The reverse stock split might be the fourth reason. GE announced plans to give investors one new share for every eight they hold. Reverse splits can make investors nervous by signaling the business outlook isn’t good. That doesn’t appear to be the case, though.“One of the things I came to appreciate at GE is we have a share count that puts us out of reach of any peer or competitor,” CEO Larry Culp tells Barron’s. “It’s nothing more than cleaning up an excessively large share count.”"
"double disaster double whammy of bad bad ideas and thinking from management team ,i really think theyhave no idea what they management is doing. it is like a man with no brain, why would ge sell the aero leasing company when when airline business is just in the begining of coming back strong after coronacriss,the coronacriss is almost over ,why sell the business now when you can make bigbigmoneynext 5 to 10 plus years, the pent up demand for travel after what in the corona criss will behugehuge.and why would they put forward a 1-13 reverse stock split rightnow .it dont make sense at all. when ge was just starting to turn around thier business and have a positive impact on the stock ,comingweeks this stock will will have ascaryscary crash back below $7 because they propose to do to sell aero leasing business and a reverse stock split , reverse stock split sound and make them look like they desparte andin trouble with debtand want to raise money .all us invester know when reverse stock split is done the stock usually will crash over65 to 85 percent to its origin of price before reversestock split was done. thestock alway crash 65 to 85 percent after reverse stock split is done. invester are not happy they will just dump the stock"

Horrible timing on Culps part. Stimulus confirmed and markets hitting new highs on big numbers. BA ramping up Max production and Biden easy with the purse strings on infrastructure. Could have been up 10% from 14 not down 10%.

"This is a story about GE, That doesn't talk about shr. price ,dividend,or earnings.this is the story about GE ENGINES.Part 1From the turbosupercharger to the world's most powerful commercial jet engine, GE's history of powering the world's aircraft features more than 100 years of innovation.GE Aviation: Powering a Century of FlightWhen the United States entered World War I in 1917, the U.S. government searched for a company to develop the first airplane engine ""booster"" for the fledgling U.S. aviation industry. This booster, or turbosupercharger, installed on a piston engine, used the engine's exhaust gases to drive an air compressor to boost power at higher altitude.GE accepted the challenge first, but another team also requested the chance to develop the turbosupercharger. Contracts were awarded in what was the first military aircraft engine competition in the U.S. Under wartime secrecy, both companies tested and developed various designs until the Army called for a test demonstration.In the bitter atmosphere of Pikes Peak, 14,000 feet above sea level, GE demonstrated a 350-horsepower, turbosupercharged Liberty aircraft engine and entered the business of making airplanes fly higher, faster and with more efficiency than ever before. That mountaintop test of the first turbosupercharger landed GE's first aviation-related government contract and paved the way for GE to become a world leader in jet engines.For more than two decades, GE produced turbosuperchargers that enabled aircraft, including many in service during World War II, to fly higher, with heavier payloads. The company's expertise in turbines and turbosuperchargers figured into the U.S. Army Air Force's decision to select GE to develop the nation's first jet engine.Since then, the aircraft engines division of GE Aviation has scored many firsts. Among them: America's first jet engine, the first turbojet engines to power flights at two and three times the speed of sound, and the world's first high bypass turbofan engine to enter service.Today, GE Aviation is a global provider of engines, systems, and services, with revenues exceeding $30 billion. As a leader in aviation technology, GE Aviation continues to design, develop and manufacture jet engines, components and integrated systems for military, commercial and business and general aircraft as well as aero-derivative gas turbines for marine applications. In addition, GE Aviation is the world's leading integrated engine maintenance resource.GE Builds America's First Jet EngineBecause principles and challenges in turbosuperchargers apply to gas turbines as well, GE was a logical choice to build America's first jet engine.In 1941, the U.S. Army Air Corps picked GE's Lynn, Massachusetts, plant to build a jet engine based on the design of Britain's Sir Frank Whittle. Six months later, on April 18, 1942, GE engineers successfully ran the I-A engine.In October 1942, at Muroc Dry Lake, California, two I-A engines powered the historic first flight of a Bell XP-59A Airacomet aircraft, launching the United States into the Jet Age. The thrust rating of the I-A was 1,250 pounds; the thrust rating of the GE90-115B is more than 90 times as great at 115,000 pounds.The I-A engine incorporated a centrifugal-flow compressor, as did the increasingly more powerful engines developed by GE during the next two years, culminating in the J33 engine, which was rated at 4,000 pounds of thrust. The J33 powered the U.S. Army Air Corps' first operational jet fighter, the P-80 Shooting Star, to a world's speed record of 620 miles per hour in 1947. Before the end of that year, a GE J35 engine powered a Douglas D-558-1 Skystreak to a record-breaking 650 miles per hour. The J35 was the first GE turbojet engine to incorporate an axial-flow compressor--the type of compressor used in all GE engines since then.However, the Air Corps, concerned about disrupting supplies of turbosuperchargers, placed production of GE's jet engines with other manufacturers. GE then set about designing another. The resulting J47 put GE back in the business of building jet engines. But demand for the J47 to power almost all the new front-line military aircraft, particularly the F-86 Sabre Jet, meant the Lynn plant could not keep up. GE needed a second factory.GE selected a federally owned plant near Cincinnati, Ohio, where Wright Aeronautical piston engines had been produced during World War II. GE formally opened the plant on February 28, 1949, with the second J47 production line, to complement the original line at Lynn. Later, the plant would be known as Evendale and would become GE Aviation's world headquarters.With the Korean War boosting demand, the J47 became the world's most produced gas turbine. More than 35,000 J47 engines were delivered by the end of the 1950s. That engine scored two major firsts: it was the first turbojet certified for civil use by the U.S. Civil Aeronautics Administration- and the first to use an elec"
Imagine now when the DOW drops 400 pts. Bad decision.
Smart money hiding in GE as usual . Just like the ol days.
"maybe Ge can buy some games, from game stop"
The 8 to 1 split does not seem to be accepted by some shareholders as can be seen by the 6% drop in the share price. This is just a knee-jerk reaction and things might look different in a day or two.
today's close will be just shy of 13
OMG...BREAKOUT! 
I bought the GE what it was just over $10 I wasn't about to dump it I was just waiting for what happened today and I expect that it was Profit takers that was causing the stock to drop. just glad to see what it's doing after hours and very happy with the volume expected to keep going up

Is Buffet buying into GE??????????
Definitely a buy right now.
Should i buy a 1000 more?
So one analyst can just say he has a target price for GE and stock goes down to $6? Is that how stock market works?
I see the wisdom in Culp’s latest move. Long term it will be healthy. I saw posts of those who would prefer buybacks over a reverse split but the effect long term should be the same. If the 30b is used to pay down debt especially those long term care debts while removing the number of outstanding shares will have a positive effect on EPS relatively soon after the reverse split happens. Sure a dip in the share price and it will probably trade sideways for a few months but long term it is healthy for GE.
GE has a history of dipping between the 11am - noon hour. No surprise there.
"This is comical that people think the roof is falling in. Shorts are trying to shake the tree of the new investors. This company is solid and will only keep getting better. The reverse split will have positive effects, it will cut down some of these day traders that play on people’s emotions. Look at the history of RI nothing but negative comments that go way back. He is a short and will only offer bad advice that will put money in his pocket. So hold firm and you will be rewarded with great gains."
lets made ge pass 1330 dont sell it and its will go up
All the shorts and jj and co where are you guys
We will go back to 14+. Fundamentals have not changed. Anyone who thinks a reverse stock split affects the value of a business HAS NO business in investing in stocks. Let the panic sellers sell. What a great dip these last few days and congrats to all who held.
"Everyone vote against the reverse split. Reverse splits rarely work. This is what will happen if the reverse split happened tomorrow for example. GE will open at around 96 per share. Then a down day in the market will see GE drop to around 89 per share. Then GE will issue stock options offering increasing their share count and rewarding mgmt and their board and GE will drop to 79 per share. Then you will see the crooked hedge funds come in to short GE. The crooks will issue fake stories and eventually you will see GE back to 12 per share. Vote against any reverse split. Contact the SEC and report the board and mgt. GE had momentum, there is absolutely no reason for a reverse split."
"I know Cathie Wood holds some GE; not much, just around 175k shares. But still..."

"I completely am mystified on this split, as a long time investor, I do not understand this one. This reminds me of pulling your starters from a game after you have gone back from a large deficit. Can someone explain how this is possibly a good idea right as things were improving??????"
You’ve got to be nuts to buy GE with all that is going on right now. This is about all the present stock holders only. Do not buy GE until they put out a statement on the cancelation of the reversal stock split.

The reverse split proposal. Ge to take around 1.8billion shares so for every 8 shares you got is one whole share. Usually companies do this to stay listed. And the merge didn’t receive that good of a response. I’m looking at the volume and that should push it to 14 at least. But it hasn’t been 30 for the past five years. I say keep holding on.

"NO LIKES a company to take their 1000 shares and give them one hundred in return IT DOES NOT MATTER IF THE VALUE IS THE SAME. This reverse split is going to cause a lot more people to sell. A selloff on a reverse split happens just like a stock goes up on a regular split, you can call it irrational but it’s a proven phenomenon. There are no “rules” to making money in investing despite your little MBA teacher or Warren Buffet ( mr. can’t make money sell the airlines and banks at the bottom loser) tell you.

Doubling down on GE to $4
Every stock I own was up today except for GE. Easy come easy go.
Long live Tusa and Markopolos. GE is going down.
"Sample a dozen random tickers @2:28pm till close and think about what you see. And do so across multi sectors.. Yes the entire market is down.. it is just happened to drop down at the exact same time , across all sectors? charlie munger ""uhhhhhh, we really should be focused on GME.. like you know, that's the actual concern with the markets integrity.. it should never been allowed to happen""$GE $MGNI $VLDR $FSR $LPI $CPE $SM $GTHX"
Everyone here needs to contact your brokerage and explicitly tell them that you will not allow borrowing of your shares by anyone that is not you. $CPE $LPI $GEVO $MGNI $GTHX $ISR $GE $OZSC $TLSS
Need to break through 12. Getting close.
No stopping this GE.. a lot of great business transactions
Come'on....we can do it...just 2 minutes left til close....over 12!....YES we did!
GE could have reclaimed a helluva lot of shares back when it was in the single digits. It could still buy some back now.
Missed on the estimate by 0.01 but with higher revenue. So still with higher revenue the company couldn’t meet the original analyst expectations. Fake Rally .
Happy new year to everyone
"If you believe that Ge will recover as most analysts do, and that after this near-term period the shares will be significantly higher ($12 to 15 per share or more) then stay with it. If you panic you will just feed the short-term speculators and day traders. Stay long and you will likely be rewarded for your effort with a share price close to $20. That is a nice rate of return over 18-20 months. This isn’t the old Ge ... go look at Culp’s track record and then his Ge compensation package. Be bold and stay long."
GE wanted to get its stock up to triple digits by the 1 for 8 reverse split. Looks like a 1 for 10 reverse split may need be by done by the time GE stops falling.
how long will it take to give back the $.50 plus up yesterday. give it till 1300...
Ge will satrt paying divident.
"Guess who was the smart guy who bought a ton of options thinking the 30 billion deal was gonna make the stock jump ? Yep... story of my life. Bought nikola it dropped $50 a day laterBought kodak, it dropped 75% 3 days later. Been holding workhorse for a year hoping the usps contract would go through, lost 25 a share on that dealBought tesla and apple when they did their splits...lost money for the next 2 months after that. If you ever wanna know when to place a put just ask what im buying and your put will skyrocket!GE ... ya let me down"
Where were all the restrictions when GE collapsed over 300 billion $$ over the last 20 years. How much do u suppose the hedge funds made shorting the stock versus so-called Robin Hood investors. At least management made it easier on the big boys by crashing the dividend to one cent per quarter. BTW when you short u have to pay the dividend.
"Ok GE, its a red market day. Let's see what you got."
"well thats a surprise.....last couple days the children were not to be found...a day GE is down the Notradomis's are out in force posting every couple of minutes with their cutsey gif's, dribble drek and LOL YIPEE HEHEHEHEcant wait for nappy time"
"ge is planning an investor day on March 10, when it also plans to share its 2021 outlook."
Down in pre-market along with BA (Boeing) due to this weekend's Indonesian 787 plane crash?
"Boeing reported a huge Q4 lossconsidering, ge did quite wellhowever, circumstances are not yet in ges favor - not where people are spending need to see how culp will be using cash on hand"
"I see several people saying they will ""vote NO"" to a rev-split. The Google Machine says that in most cases a rev-split can be declared by the board and it does *not* require shareholder approval."
"Just saw this - Analyst Actions: Deutsche Bank Adjusts General Electric's Price Target to $14 From $13, Reiterates Hold RatingBY MT Newswires— 11:14 AM ET 03/11/2021A reverse split isn't always a bad thing. At least not like it's being portrayed here. My opinion, it creates somewhat of a facade. EPS will LOOK better because there will be less shares. The market cap will remain the same. Dividends will be greater on shares held, only the investor will have less shares, so the end result (yield) will remain the same. The stock price will be more in line with other company's in the sector. I'm not understanding the motivation for the big sell off."
"bullish, I think it's not time to stop yet"
Could it be possible that culp is a worse ceo than immelt and welsh combined?
question. Let face it the stock has fallen off the truck! Way up from 5. What's keeping Culp from announcing a stock buy back before the 8-1 split?
"been long GE since $6, took profits.. yikes! be back after this sell off"
back to $9.5
Has been consolidating for almost a year n is starting to break out. Expecting a nice move up...weak n impatient weak hands r mostly gone n more n more institutions have purchased for the long term!!
$20 possible by Jan '22?
you know why they do reverse split?so they can take your money and stay on the marketprove me wrong
It will go back up after lunch around 12:30. Also it will be around $13 plus by the end of the week.
"aviation alone will have the stock selling at $20, then add reduction of debt, then add CULP and acquisitions, and this stock is a steal. watch how fast $17.50 comes, buying all I can can today and prior to eps."
"uh oh,, looks like all the weak hands that sold are being taught a lesson which has started bout 20 mins ago. this will finish Green today and then up from there"
COVER your short positions JJ and GE_to_$4 quick !!. You both like losing money don't you ?.
"Attention please...Captain Culp has momentarily leveled us off at $13+... we now have a visual on horizon of significant Power, Aviation and Renewable energy needs heading our way. Please remain in your seats while he gets clearance and initiates a climb to higher altitude to cover these new demands."
As a shareholder DON NOT VOTE in favor of the proposed reverse split.
200mil soon and back to the $11.00's!! Stop the split GE Management and stop the bleeding!
Back down to sigle digits; good going GE!
"I feared a ""sell the news"" event today. I didn't think GE would actually make a negative announcement today."
Today was a great day for the market. Almost everything was in green except for a few and sadly GE was one of them. It definitely suffered from TUSa comments. I always say if you got nothing nice to say you might as well shut up and don’t say anything at all.
I tried being long went back short
Goldman Sachs announced it is raising its price target on the industrial giant's to $15 per share reiterating buy rating
Closing at or above $13 this week. IMHO
$12 it is! My short term target for this stock is $20/share by next February 2022.Longer term higher if the continue on this trajectory!

Goodbye GE Capital!! I will not miss you.
"GE is an American legend. Their failure under Immelt is a failure for the American economy, American business, and employees and shareholders. A strong GE has great benefit to the American economy and can be of great benefit to American citizens as an employer. Welch and Immelt and many like them in corporate America think too much about how to gather wealth from stock options on the backs of shareholders and not enough about how to build shareholder equity and buy their shares on the open market the way common shareholders do. The best run publicly traded companies in America limit the use of stock options as a form of compensation, limit dilution of common shareholders, limit the need for share buybacks of the share dilution caused by issuing shares for stock options, and grow shareholder equity and the ability to pay a dividend with growing positive cash flow. The excessive use of stock options in publicly traded companies concentrates wealth into the executives who have the power to reward themselves in that way, dilutes common shareholders, and robs shareholders of the opportunity for a dividend or reinvestment by the use of cash to buy back the shares they issued to themselves to overcompensate themselves for no productive difference or better performance; furthermore, this bad widespread practice incentivizes risks that do not justify the rewards for shareholders and are only justified by the recipients of stock options."
GE is the NEXT GME.
Great long term stock for the clean energy sector
well every stock has high vollume shorted will be targeted from other hegde funds and retailers globally. UK news firm reports it; not my story.
You cannot steal a Presidential election without any repercussions.
GE earning come very soon
PLEASE DO NOT FIGHT THE TREND THE TREND IS GOING DOWNHILL -- NEWLY BEARISH GE INVESTOR
LOL - Stephen Tusa again did not give a price target but reiterated hold on GE yesterday. Guess he' still recovering from sticker shock when he seen GE yesterday. Wait until earnings hits him....hope he's sitting down.
"1 for 8 reverse split is a game changer investor decision whether it still works for the individualit will change investor styledividend another question. ge was asked but chose not to respondis culp still looking to cut costs, here is an opportunitymy earlier comment, looking out for ge or the investorat least temporarily."

"Texas Governor continues to show what a bad leader he is for his state. He removes sensible covid precautions against advice of CDC. The Federal Government should now withdraw ALL Federal funding, oil and gas leases and other ""handouts"". They did the same with power and water, and when disaster struck, Texas came begging. When covid surges again, they will come begging again. Time to move NASA, all military bases and other Federal agencies to blue states."
Good Day to All GE Investors !!! 
Honestly I approve of the deal with Aercap but the reverse stock split feel like its the opposite approach of what you want now. Short term its going to see more volatility and long term less investors going into the stock
"GE can be such a safe haven. Look, it always loses less than the market. And it always grows more than the market. High-tech companies behave quite the opposite."
"Patience needed, earnings season just started, not so good for most companies. Ge stock should benefit on earnings report day due to its swift recovery in all its metrics thanks to actions taken by new management. Do your own research, midterm to long term exceptional benefits, stay long."

"For all of you doubters, history will repeat itself, I am sure no one thought GE will go from $57 to $6. Then from $32 to $5 ... but it did. And it will do it again all the way to $4."
we ca repeat that every year :)
ehemmmm 100% upside here and a great jump start post March 10th? #$%$

cheap way to short the SPX-- traders going to torment the longs -- get out
Love the shorts here.. NOT. $17 in no time
So GE has always been a short sellers dream... GE has always been a day traders dream.. GE has always had difficulties finding investors when the price was dirt cheap.. imagine paying 105.00 for the same struggling company.. it’s almost laughable. Watch and learn how the shorts surgically destroy this stock yet again.
Hold. Do not let your shares go. This is about to blast off on market open.
I would appreciate some serious input from any T/A guys out there ... the 2 year chart has nowcompleted a C&H .... within that was low retesting a number of times and the whole thing looks very bullish ... garce
"8:1 reverse split, not shareholder friendly. I will put money on they are raising their share price to do an offering six months or so after they do their reverse split. I have been through several reverse splits and have studied the matter continuously for 40 years. The reverse split never goes to the percentage, but always under the percentage, in this case 1 for 8 proposed. Shareholders get spooked and so do investment friends and retirement funds when a stock is shaken up by a reverse split. If they can’t entice the street to upgrade their share price, they do it manually. Red flag.￼￼"
"who would buy GE now with a reverse split coming, makes no sense. You are just giving your money away"
i wonder how many BOD people have made a lot of money in the past 2 days ...this seems pretty fishy to me..
No reverse split.
Great investors day. NOT !!!
Minor correction time? Want to get back in...Got out a bit sooner today.. Thought $12.60 will be the top..
mondays mkt. open and next week could see the stock move over $14.50
"All I can say is great job GE board and Culp. How to lose 20 billion in market cap within 3 days. The market speaks, and the reverse split is not good."

Haven't bought back all of your shares yet?
@C i have provided facts all day. You just don't want to listen. Get out from underneath Larry's desk and see the light. 1 out of every 1000RS's moves higher after the split. This was pout out to take everyone's attention to their dismal number projections going forward. Look at the projections and argue that. Go scam someone else. I have traded GE for nearly 4 years now. Where did you come from?

Anybody going to read Immelt's upcoming book?
I'll buy a few shares of GE when they drop to $5.50 ...
This stock was around this level. When I was born in 1995.
Added my final lot at 12.08 my truck is full! Long term  let's just not do the reverse !
I don't like the reverse split and I'm out. I would have liked to see them grow their sales and keep the stock market going up. A reverse split is dangerous. Paying down their debt and buying back stock would have helped the share price as well.
Thank you for the cheap shares to average up. Nice blurb in Barron's too. The days of Jeff Immelt are finally receding. Only by the steady hands of Larry Culp are we now positioned for growth. Buy as much as you want below $15 imo.

Idk who bought those shares the last hr wasn’t institutional unless you can trade from the funny farm. Where’s the news
Finally GE getting to cut Jobs in France?...they have been wanting to do that for long time but French Government was threatening GE with fines...This is great news!! They can now cut even more excess and unnecessary costs.
Even though this was a $60 stock 20 years ago I'll be happy with $20.
GE should sell video games or be almost out of business like AMC. Those 2 stocks are up over 50% while this pig is down 2.5% What GARBAGE.
Does anyone else think that Culp look like one of the perps on Law & Order SVU
General Electric is up 6.31% to 11.45
"Like I said, no signs of a rebound today...any uptick will trigger exit selling"
GE strong like BULL!
Where in the hell is Tusa of Jpm who predicted ge demise. Many investors lost a bundle on his fake prognostication.
"Something the market seems to be overlooking is that GE was expected to sell the leasing unit for about $30 billion with terms unknown (maybe deferred). So, an okay to moderate deal was priced into the stock. However, what was announced this morning was a significantly better deal. The leasing unit was sold at around $50 billion in value -- $26 billion in cash, upfront (which is a lot better than $30 on ""terms""), and the rest in stock in the new company.GE stock should be up by at least a dollar a share based on that news, maybe $1.50 at least during the day, with a close at $15. This drop has all to do with the reverse split which demonstrates how retail investors don't like that move. I think it's wrong but it's not $1.80 per current share wrong. Institutions are smart enough to know this and I suspect they are buying and will continue to buy because this is a short term opportunity to get the shares on sale. Plus, the leasing co sale was far better than expected.I'm going out on a limb here and calling the stock to rally back and close the week at $15 or better.Go, GE!Good luck, longs."
"GE Renewable Energy will create as many as 750 new jobs in northeast England with a new factory that will make hundreds of giant blades destined for wind turbines in the North Sea.The new facility, located in Teesside, is set to open and begin production in 2023, the company said in a statement."
Folks this is a year of OX per Asian calendar. It is believed that during the OX year things would be bullish and hopefully this would be the case for market as whole as Melt up occurs and most special a bullish year for GE.
Anyone know when the reverse becomes effective?
"traders or investors GE is just the best stock for anybody ,CULP probably #1 CEO in the country, add into the picture $40 billion in cash and l/c's, with CULP doing m&a deals, shorts will start to cover real soon. $22 share price not far off"

"GE has figured out how to market and sell the wind! Once, people catch wind of this, it will surely be a windfall to longs..."
Congrats to the longs who stuck it out during that dead money period in December while institutions were accumulating. This admin cannot execute a green 'revolution' without GE. $11 Jan 15 and $12 Mar 19 calls looking good.
"for ge stock to continue upward action, we need, commercial flying coming back , or a move by culp"
"50 days moving average is still active. Will go up in the next 3 weeks before quarterly. I agree with many contributors about the timing of the RS (they should have done it at quarterly in a careful way instead hammering it out). Fundamentally nothing has changed, they are on track."
The only reason for the RS is to issue more shares after the split. Issue 1billion shares at $100 and whala $100 billion dollars. And then ge is at 200 billion shares outstanding and price drops to $50. Then price drops to $40 then price drops to $30. Am I right?
When will revised price targets from analysts come through?
a chart pattern like this never rests until it takes out 10 bucks heading to 9.80 area-- this chart pattern is extremely accurate short term it says nothing about where the stock is heading over thinnest year plus--if it fails in the rally attempt below 10 up to the under carriage of 10 get out big trouble ahead --if it rallies over 10 and hods chances are good you can ride it to a new 52 week high--not interested in your comments-- I am stating probabilities based on past chart patterns -- probabilities does not mean you are right or wrong just getting the odds in your favor long term -- stocks will gravitate around the 10 level way too regularly to be chance ---right or wrong I am going with he odds-- sub 10 coming soon
short squeeze is on....

1 for 8 reverse split will make GE a $100 stock. I'd wait to buy post split if I were a new investor.
Sold and walk away buy may be in future

"GE Healthcare unveils Vscan Air a new, wireless handheld ultrasound. More personalized care for patients worldwide."

"General Electric Company’s GE Power segment recently clinched an order for its state-of-the-art HA — one of the most efficient fleet of gas turbines in the world. The company entered into a deal with Tongyeong Eco Power to provide more than 1 gigawatt of power generation equipment at Tongyeong combined cycle power plant, based in Tongyeong City, South Korea."
GE can't even afford to pay a dividend so how can they afford to buy back any stock . They can't. So they will do the next best thing to address the massive number of shares issued over the glory years. A reverse split will only affect current holders if they continue to hold the stock. I challenge anyone to show us how Culp's bonuses and performance compensation largess is tied to the current stock price.Sure he and other insiders have purchased shares in GE. So did I when it was $5 a share.
Look at the opening number later 
EVERY TIME MARKET GOES UP...GE GOES DOWN......... 9 OUT OF 10 HAS BEEN THE CASE.....

When is the split
Did not see this coming. This will drop more coming days.I say sell and wait.
"Share holders can vote NO, but GE might have ran this by big investors and agree to it"

helluva bounce
"Going to $20 no question. By the end of this month,"
Boom! GE knocks it out of the park.
timber
Here is what I know as fact. All of GE’s business divisions will be in high growth going forward. Buy the trend and don’t listen to noise from anyone. Buy logic sense.
Great day in the Morning!!
"$GE needs another surge to the upside of $5 dollars to get it to $20 plus buy year's end. It's going to require sustained daily volume of around 100 million for about a month to pull it off in just a month. Institutions are already starting buy up shares, now it's time for the retail investors to step it up. $GE pays you to hold after you buy shares unlike the resent ""Pump and Dump"" stocks that have been in the news. Even Apple cut it's dividend during it's rebuild period, $GE is doing the same thing and will follow the same model and become a growth stock during it's recovery from the pandemic."
Accumulate. Target $20.00.

GE to $20 soon.
GE is on a solid growth path. I'm all in long all the way. Mark my words the stock price will be in $30+ range by mid year.
I don’t have a problem with reverse splits. After 128 years a company is gonna find itself over diluted and it takes too much volume to move 8.7 billion shares..Same problem Nokia has.There are too many other stocks vying for investors attention for GE to generate the several hundred millions shares traded daily needed to move such a large float
"@rj Wow, what did I say 2 months ago. I guess you won't be complaining about the share price anymore...Sudo2 months agoReplied to a reaction$GE conversationShare price doesn't mean anything. They could do a reverse split tomorrow and have $100 share price if they wanted to."
WHAT have you Done H. Lawrence Culp Jr.? Unbelievable $$$$ lost here.
"hedge funds buying GE is increasing significantly every month,now add CULP and $45 billion in cash ,only up ahead for stock"
Maybe the renewables will keep GE running up.
My decision day is today: I can sell my GE and buy F for the same price. Which one will do better over the next year? They’ve both been down and out and recovered from pandemic lows.
"The market hasn't gone down since the 1.9T, I wonder why? They have to get the money into the economy somehow, and dropping it from helicopters never was really feasible."

"Volume was looking great today, just a sample of things to come."
If the RS had not been announced we would be at 15. How much credibility is in the RS? Thats the golden question. I will trade on the improving fundamentals and balance sheet during a reopening as large as this. No day trades here just pure old school investing.
Is GEs net debt really $37 billion? I don’t think they have a debt problem anymore especially if they generate $4 billion in free cash flow this year
GE is one for investors for great turn around investment pick. Business units are in the right sector for major growth going forward. GE is also very safe to hold. No worry during sleeping at night. Dividend will slowly coming back at the same time revenues keep climbing. $40 is very possible price target by 2024. GE is also considered as provider for green infrastructure. A premium price is warranted. I have been recommending to every new investors here since GE was at $6 bucks but probably not many listen to my reasoning. 40 plus experience help me able to find stock picks. Trading for me is now just for fun as my life is getting older. Good luck.
"GE executives are paying themselves massive bonuses, yet, offer the retail investor 1 share for every 8 reverse split for their loyalty!!!"

KABOOM!
"Is Buffett buying GE? Given Munger’s recent remarks, and there’s no company more American today than the one Thomas Edison founded."
Buying Anab now.
who is buying those 1/4 BILLION GE shares that have traded today?
ge is finally getting it's due. just starting to grow into a major position it once held..... a lot of new investors.
there is (i think) still huge short pressure on this stock. Go Reddit Go!!!!! eat em in the shorts!!!! just kidding!! doesn't matter about short pressure anymore; this stock is going to be slowly on its way to full recovery. I wouldn't be surprised if GE Capital was now doing much better. Buy low at 13 ish - stay long!!!
culp on cnbc at 9 am
Unbelievable news.. reverse splits only help struggling companies. Never help existing shareholders. Imagine trying to find buyers @ 95.00 per share.. the shorts will drive it down 50% easily. It goes to shoe GE could care less about their shareholders.
"Don't panic!When a broad index like the Nasdaq falls day after day even when other markets are rising, it can make you question your investing philosophy. But don't let short-term fluctuations change your attitude toward the entire stock market. No matter what happens in the short run, Nasdaq stocks will be back, and great companies will lead the way forward."

There is absolutely no reason for GE to be down again. It is been down for nearly 2 weeks despite good market sentiment and all the good news regarding the company.................The only reason perhaps is manipulation and corruption..............but GE will shine no matter what.................
More discount pricing!
The SEC is a joke.
Glad i stayed away. This is gonna fail.
"Whatever may be the results tomorrow, it’s only symbolic. Most important is turnaround plan!! Those who hold for a year, will double their money."
"Why would Larry clip announce a reverse split now or allow it? The 30 billion deal was very good, but they killed the upside run. I lost respect for him he’s just like the past bozzos that came to GE. Mr Clup will ger his 25 million bonus cause the share pice will be way over 25 dollars after the R/S. What a smart sneak..."
Congratulations longs
Huge cup and handle pattern formed. Most likely a pause on resistance then further upside.
no commonsense person would hold or buy GE with that 1-8
Hurry up don’t miss this move to $4.
"GE is going to be a Python with a huge prey in its stomach... Very, very slow to move (over 7 bilion shares)..Short call options every week..."
"Looking strong, close above $11.50 today!!"
GE needs now some upgrades to propel the price higher
Why this drop? No negative news
"CUP & HANDLE completed .. it took a while , but the SP might be on it's way ..... I will take 15 and a good div boost for 21 , thank you .... garce"
Culp sacrificed GE Long shareholders to make his stock look attractive.. perfume on a pig isn’t going to work. But it did get outstanding share count lower at Long investors expense... Thanks again Culp
I am out folks. Caught her at 12 and got out at 13.30. Great company. Will be back in soon!

"Reality check, aviation and power back in the fold with Baker Hughes miraculously now in play. Momentum could take us back to $20."
Hey General Electric is a great company and it has tripled since March which is fantastic. The current trend dictates a repeat of the move that was had back in mid June. The uptrend is over this dead cat bounce will not last to bring back to the top of the up trend. Allow the stock to come down and follow the charts please. The faster it comes back down to hit the support one more time at 11.70 the faster it can hit 15
"Did they finally decide not to manipulate the stock, darling? Why thank you"
"Aviation roars back and TUSA see his shrink twice a week, not one. Buy."
Here go finally!
GE has disappointed in the past. Can management give wall Street a little hope? Maybe a new gizmo for gene therapy? Or a home EV charging solution? Or some government stimulus gifts? We are in the Democrat party zone.
GE is a safe haven stock.
Maybe with the increased price they can get added back to the Dow. ￼
I Just don't think were going to repeat the recent pattern tomorrow. Green open and up! After hours head fake.
Disappointed
"Wow, so far today only .50 cents short of Jan 4, 2020!!"

with so many shares outstanding does anyone really think the chatter on here makes any difference in GE stock price?
Weird. GE is loved by Obama folks
Big sell off after earnings when people realize that a company that sells jet engines did bad when air travel is at a all time low
Next week we will be flying.
"OH MAN.....GE IS FLYING HITTING NEW RECORD OF $14.14........FOLKS THE SILLY SHORTS ARE GETTING IN...as soon as the stock hit $14,the short interest increased .....don't let them get your shares......Next week would be a great one.GE CEO will have meeting with analysts...we should expect great outcome......"
"Well, if you were waiting to get in. Now looks like a dip."
I trust Larry
"I bought 40,000 GE shares yesterday noon, since then Stock Market Gods D!creators been angry, turned GE flat to down, contrary to market sentiment and trend..Just amazing, how they will MANIPULATE giant $$500 BILLION CROWN-JEWEL for TARGETTING tinny soul.. God & Karma is the ultimate supreme ruler of the universe"
2021 the year GE turns around...13 by end of January
I’m ready for Tuesday GE.
"Dow at record high, GE still struggling to stay over $13.50. Why? Because on ""investors"" day GE Management decided to squeeze out the retail investor with a 1 for 8 reverse split!!"
"I'm expecting Big, Positive News about GE, today."
magnetized to the 12 level you can't stop it -- trading desks are gunning for it --get out
GE would go up more if GE would cancel the proposed reverse split!
The educated stock analyst at JP Morgan have the mindset like the guy in the GIF
Might jump in here @ $11.99 for a long term hold to go along with m F @ $7.80Markets should dump on Friday after this weeks gains and drag this down with it
"GE has burned everyone who believed in it in the past! Fact is it will take a considerable time to mend those fences. Don't expect an overnight sensation. Fact is they disappointed on earnings. GE is a company who people find hard to trust either as an investor or as a client or customer. Yes, it will rise slowly in a slow upward trend with many up and down days - barring anymore sensationally bad news to surface then all bets are off."
Just shaking that tree. How many will remain. Buy the dip!
"If you created a mutual fund containing all the companies that have done a reverse splits, it would probably have the worst track record of all time. Not_A_Short"
Lock up your shares at your broker so that they can't lend them to shorts folks...I have mine locked up with good till sold orders at $25 per share
lost $20B in market cap in 2 days.. sale of aviation lease equates to giving it away free plus the added bonus of a 1-8 reverse split. GE is and will always be the biggest hurdle to success; always get it the way. good reading check out the OLD Fart board of directors not a young mind amongst any.
"I would put my $$ on Larry Culp, not the shorts and Bears. He knows far more about GE than anyone selling today. This is a good time to add some more shares."
in the green...finally
20 million shares in 7 minutes; that's more than 25% of the average volume.
Ge signed a multi billion deal with scandinavian airlines
BOOM! GE IS GOING UP UP! 30b debt reduction...
That kind of shoots a hole in the capital gains leverage with this stock. I don't see the stock price moving up at 8x the rate it is now no matter what they do.
I feel like people in this comment section think a reverse split actually changes something with the company
http://www.ge.com/news/reports/a-solar-star-is-born-ge-and-blackrock-form-new-solar-powerhouse
no reason to drop today. it is a buy buy buy buy signal
wait till tomorrow when the market is DOWN.... this will drop another 20%.. hello single digits.....
What happened here???. I thought Larry was supposed to be a smart guy
"Dead Cat Bounce.It hits bottom and rises. Then hits again and bounces up again.An that is the pattern f fear and greed.None of the past 2 days trading means anything because there is nothing fundamental involved.General Electric is the same company it was on Monday. The same!JB Morgan analyst Steven Tusa is an idiot and Ed Miller of Train Capital who on the GE board basically said so.Steven Tusa spins the story that GE stock will be $5 - the great MYTH the same way Trump says the election was stolen and he won - the GREAT STEAL. Both are fabrications looking for fools....Yes the last $20 billion of GE Capital will be debt on the company books directly now. But there is also a $21 billion asset in the AerCap stock - the 111 million shares of AerCap stock owned by GE. The change in the financials is zero. Zero. Zero.Steven Tusa says GE will be 8 times indebted in capital debt to capital assets.. That is simply a lie.GE Capital is $115 billion. GE debt shoud now be around $25 billion left after the AerCap deal and they are heading to 2.5:1 - debt to profit ratio.That means if GE returns to $10 billion FCF in 2022 and owed $25 bilion in debt - that is a true 2.5:1 debt of profit ratio.But never forget that GE has uncommitted with assets unused. Tthe Baker stock is sellable at $7 billion.The AerCap stock will be sellable at about $21 billion. And there is still on standby $45 billion cash against their $70 billion debt.So play with your numbers, throw a fit, sell and scream, but nothing will changeSame for the 8:1 reverse split. Everyone is in a ""tizzy"" for nothing. General Electric will be the same the day after the split happens.And that split will definitely be for the best as we get rid of all the Robinhood traders.Today the volume was just under 300 million shares traded.I never thought the e were that many buyers of GE stock. That today volume represents 1/25th of all GE stock traded today.Since over 60% is locked up in long term funds pension and hedge fund holdings - it really unveils how many day traders and unsophisticated trders are out there. That ratio today for the GE stock sales looks more like 1 in ever 12 available shares traded today.WoW!."
"There is no market correction in USA, only crashed or all the way UP. some humans will lose money, some humans will make money, it is people casino."
"Brent2 minutes agoTusa vs Culp? So far, Culp is winning. Buy.These are the people you want to mute. Perma bulls, long term bag holders"
"If this gains momentum and volume it could be a really nice recoveryI was really excited the last week and a half leading up to TuesdayIf it returns to a run Ike that, based on fundamentals, we could see how ridiculous the reaction was by the shorts and people who jumped"
"I am NOT invested here at the moment but....A R/S during momentum is often actually seen as bullish - reduction of shares (they have 8 BILLION outstanding right now!!), market cap will become more aligned with peers, and consolidate / expand into their money makers. If you like the current GE head then your confidence/trust shouldn't be shaken here. He's righted the ship thus far and he is thinking 10 steps ahead of everyone. Very intriguing....."
"It's funny that some people think their vote matters in company decisions, nope!Why do you think reverse split happens? Retail investors never want them, but why??It's because total of small apes don't matter in voting percentage and all the big decisions are up to the board and their greedy pocket. You will NEVER stop reverse split, unless they suddenly don't want money."
day traders about to pull the plug
look for the 12 level it can't be stopped
GE looking pretty good these days.
"Guys I just sold all 4K shares of my position. Been through 2 other reverse splits. It always sells off hard after the reverse split. Research it if you are unsure, but the market always punishes RS's. It's an artificial way of propping up the stock price."
"GE stock could trade 200 million shares today, a great sign the BIG mutual funds are buying all they can get, $20 very soon"
Shareholders will not approve the split by the looks of the PA.
GE recovering from the recent plunge. I'm guessing the at the reverse split the stock will be around $120 per share. Stock will most likely drop after the split. What's the guess on what it drops to after that? $112? And then the surge back up again.
"The new GE under CULP has been great. As I said it before, I'll say it again. GE will be $20 before the end of 2021."
Wait till cramer calls this a buy you better by now if you want in
"The reverse in this situation is harmless. It’s not as though they’re doing it to avoid a delisting. They’re reducing the float and bringing the stock price in line with the rest of the industry. After a lousy couple of years, this signals the beginning of a slow steady increase. What the reverse has given us is an opportunity to buy on this silly dip. The day after the reverse, the market will have forgotten all about it."
"Mr Larry Culp, please convert the 30% shares in BKR. to create an outfit to clead all the wells that are going to be plug. KBR is the best network which know were all those not in use wells are located and has the workabout to make a bit to the Goverment handle this task. Do not be late in this endevour. Reand todays executive order on climate change."
"Ever since the Wall Street Swindlers Upgraded GE, the stock has been down 12 out of the past 15 trading days, and the volume is half of the normal daily trading volume akmost every day (No Institutions buying after the snake oil salesmen's upgrade!) .. Anyone noticed?"
"Don't do the 1for 8, the stock can't even get to 15 all the big guys would like that. So they would get all their Options and cash in all the millions. Let the stock move up on its own, and it will in time."

"When a sports team has a great head coach, it keeps winning for decades. It is the same for a great CEO with a company. Wall Street loves great CEO. Larry Culp is everything Wall Street is looking for. If next week or a few weeks from now, GE annouces it wins a big contract, then you will regret that you didn't look into the valuation instead of looking into RS."
"GE option @$15 exp June18, looks so atteactive"
"Bottom line: GE stock is a buy right now, assuming the stock holds above its latest entry point. So it wasn't a buy last week at 10 bucks and change but now that it is more expensive...it is?WHAT???? Anyway... I loaded the boat with 10K in the 6's..... boat floats nice....!!!"
Sell before it's too late.
Keep moving up and send the shorts into a panic!!
wait to see 60T:11.63
"Come on GE 8 Billion shares !!! really yesterday you you could have saved a few million buying stock back. Every dollar the stock goes up will cost 8 Billion dollars more to buy back 1 billion shares.... Are you going to wait till its 20 to start a share buy back, lets go will ya... You know the stock is not going to move to far with over eight billion shares out there. Maybe you could learn from E Bay, they raised the div and bought back their shares, and yes the stock jumped up like 10 percent. Yes the value of GE will go up if you do this, but the longer you wait the more its going to cost, do you get this."
"i don't get the reasoning behind the planned reverse split. however, i understand even less why people would sell because of it! it will not change the value of anyone's GE position..."
"I’m holding my calls but the price drop is crazyIf they came out and announced they were taking the reverse split off the table, the stock wouldn’t go up 1.93 (last two days drop) So the drop is just irrational I’m hoping the institutional guys see the opportunity and jump in"
Any possiblity of GE scaling $13 mark in March?
can they turn ge into gme? We need to shake some shorts and get going
Common GE - hold the gain above the .30 for one day. You at least deserve it. Jesus.
"The announcement of the RS proposal was absolutely created to destract investors from GE’s biggest achievement of the last 20 years. Worth at least $2+ dollars a share could have generated a panic short squeeze which short holders like Chase would not have been able to handle. Solution? Come out with with this fictitious announcement, let the short covering happen in order and once Chase and friends join the party move the $20. This, again, is the last boat for short covering below $20.Stay greedy my friends"
Where is that 4.00 Mr. Genius GE_to_$4 ?. hahahaha. You and JJ are a piece of work !.
up again. yahoos average target for ge now raised from 11.75 to 12.18.
will see $12 today
Get ready for the squeeze. It’s coming later this week. GE will be $17 by EOW
"Timber, I told you BAGGIES. Twelve today."
How does a company like GE that has traded over 35 years on NYSE trade for 11.00 especially in a 12 year bull market?
"WOW, DOW up almost 300. This pig down over 1 dollar. BAGGIES once again left holding the bag. You will never learn that this company is out to screw retail investors."
"Looks like the reverse stock split isn't catching on. Understandably so. Trying to make GE a $100 stock just doesn't make sense. Retail investors will be frightened away and priced out. Looks like GE just undid much of the good, it seemed to regain."
we will fly tomorrow
reverse split is always a bad newstime to buy puts
Heading to $20. Hold your shares.
GE is heading lower for the first half of 2021. Higher in the 2nd half.
Never listen to frauds on CNBC. They were pumping this the day before RS announcement. Bet their minions were divesting their positions on the other side. Such a fraud market. Just do your own homework.
EXTREMELY OVER BOUGHT
"Another banner day for us shorts. Down 20 cents premarket. I will keep on taking various short positions on this pig making 5 to 10 percent increase in my holdings on a weekly to monthly basis. I have also taken a huge short position on Game Stop. This company is the next Blockbuster, and will be worthless within a year or two. Games will be streamed on line, just like movies. You can keep on holding on to GE, but I predict a post reverse share price of about 80. This equals a share price of about $9.00 today. The writing is on the wall for GE, and currently it is not good."
Strong companies do forward splits $TSLA and bad companies do R/S GECatching on
The State of Wisconsin Investment Board substantially increased positions in General Electric ADDING another 2.7 MILLION shares to their existing GE stock holdings.....GE also closed in highest point of the day and hopefully this trend will continue for awhile.... LETS HOPE we see a total new 52 week high in the next week or two.... I will be a holder till at least $17 and if the air travel picks up maybe even $25...GOOD LUCK to all and please do your own dd
Talk on Redditt????
"GE does not belong in the $10-$20 stock price range. This is for small to mid size companies.GE should be in a league with other global conglomerates like HON, ZBRA, MMM, BA, AAPL, CATThis split will achieve this."
Where's JJ? I'm up like 80% on my CALLs today.
Mr. Culp .... How does the company generate value when it reverse splits???How is that better for the share holders who hired you to put the company back on the right track ???

all Boeing orders have an out clause-- there are still hundreds of already built planes sitting in storage that need to be moved --Boeing's first priority is to sell the already built planes at a steep discount -- airlines have every incentive to cancel future orders buy the deep discounted already built ones -- the airlines are in no hurry to take delivery on full priced planes yet to be built -- my wife works for American and they are not going to take delivery on any significant number of planes--our fiends oak for United same story there-- watch for the unsold inventory figures as a true tell of GE's operations

"why would Culp want to do areverse split at the beginning of a turnaround? Makes no sense, most young investors will not jump into this as it wont appear cheap. and 8-1?? Culp... what are you thinking?"
"Government looks set to borrow more than $3 trillion for second year in a rowThe numbers: The federal government's budget deficit widened to $311 in February from $235 billion in the same month last year, the Treasury Department reported Wednesday.Economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal had expected the deficit to widen to $255 billion in February.The deficit is a record for the month.What happened: Total spending was $559 billion in February, up 32% from the prior year. Spending went up on unemployment benefits from the Labor Department and spending by the Health and Human Services . The government is not keeping track of all the money spent to fight COVID-19 pandemic."

"Have no idea if this has anything to do with AH gain, but Steve Grasso on CNBC picked GE as final pick. Said he’s expecting another “20%” move up soon."
1 for 8 Reverse? Whiskey-Tango-Fox...Guess the BOD didn't realize it was the retail investor that brought this stock from $6 to $14?
interesting 1M shares+ traded post-close to drive up the price.
"If you don't already see it, as GE returns to health, you will realize the genius of Larry Culp!"
"It seems today is a profit taking day.....GE been in RED all morning; however I don't think it would stay in RED, expect to get back in GREEN ZONE.....and go green all the way till earning is announced..Hopefully we will see it cross $13 soon....................JIM CRAMER raised his prediction on GE from $10 to $12.....I think it will even go higher than that...In my opinion $12 is very conservative number....This is my personal opinion, make sure to do your own DD......."
Chart looks.............bearish.
"Reverse splits are a sign of weakness. Now from the new price of $80 or $100 dollars it can begin to sell off again big time. They sell Baker Hughes just as Oil comes back. They sell GE credit just as the financials are in vogue. I don't know the whole story, but GE is out of lockstep with the real world."
"under 13.75 will only last for maybe a day, even todays close and after hours will find Buyers"
"GE should be talking about building and selling great products. But all you hear is GE is making great deals, selling and spinning things off and reverse splitting. I don't see any incentive to buy and hold there. When all is said and done, you will have maybe a holding company or some skeleton company that may be finally sold off to some venture capitalist. I don't think there is any royalty to any company called GE. It is all about making deals and making money."
"IMO, clear trend reversal after yesterday and todays massive volume selling.. been long GE since $6, took profits. this doesn't look good"
"whether short or longno differencebuy low sell hi or sell hi buy lowworks either way,"
There's nothing like good money management.
losing patience..will need to review to protect gains i have left after this mess...

"I'm long GE, however over the years they have deluted any value to shareholders with massive 8.5 billion shares outstanding. Tuesday will be interesting. What could happen? Culp blames covid-19, can not get enough electronic component for electronic gizmos that are used in their jet engines & wind turbines. I hope I am wrong. Watch how the stock trades on Monday. If huge volume in either direction means a leak of info"
what's not to love... renewable the new magnet for venture capitalist.... GE 
I am assuming that the Pension Fund appropriation in the stimulus bill will bail out GE Union pension plans and remove the unfunded liability contingency from the GE balance sheet? Anybody know about this?
GE was over $13 per share last year just before the Pandemic hit. GE is not a stay at home stock. It’s a get out and do things stock. In a few months we will be out doing things.
11s coming.

"I'm telling everyone on Robinhood to buy GE right now, but I'm telling all you guys to SELL GE now.Kinda like the saying...""We cheat the Other Guy, and then pass the Savings on to You"". :-) GLTA"
"I don't understand all the panic over the RS. Wouldn't a retail/small investor want to gobble up shares now -- not sell them -- before they cost an arm and a leg? They're obviously doing this to get back on the Good Boy List for institutional investors and be relisted on the DOW. The only difference between before and after an RS is perception, so why would everyone start freaking out and selling? Also it seams like an RS would totally wipe out a huge swath of Shorties -- a huge plus. I'm asking seriously and as a buy and hold basic investor. No option/put talk please, none of that is on my radar, just an old-time investor here. I'm up 75-133% depending on the account. I bought to hold this for like 5 years and get the Danaher-like 400% pay off."
Sometimes I like to drink carpet cleaner. I feel it makes my hair shine
Culp is as bad as Immelt with a shady deal proposed to do a reverse stock split.Another way to screw shareholders.
I see 20 and then RS and then 160 and will soon to 200
"GE Renewable Energy has been selected by Leeward Renewable Energy, LLC to repower its 90 MW #Aragonne wind project in Guadalupe County, #NewMexico, alongside the new 145 MW Aragonne Mesa wind project, the total wind farm output will increase to 235 MW"
"For once, I am hoping this comes down a bit. I want to add 50% to my February call options position"
Reverse spilt Better than spending billions on a buy back The price drop is from lower guidance
"J.P. Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa doesn't think eliminating GE Capital as a reporting entity fixes underlying issues. That's a big reason why he's a GE bear, because GE Capital is what he calls ""an ignored overhang on value."" He's still concerned with the debt at GE Capital, and problems such as long-term care insurance contracts, are significant. He believes investors are too focused on the industrial recovery and not focused enough on what's left in GE Capital after GECAS is gone."
@Sammy You are totally clueless! The reverse split will make it higher than $20.00.
The monster is coming back!
Tell you what any news screws the shorts is good news.
"One of the BOD (Trian) was just on CNBC ... the 5 minute interview was poorly done and focused on usual/mundane balance sheet stuff we already know ... literally gave 20 seconds to the RS and the explanation was simply that they wanted a float that was more reflective of the business size ... he gave no sense that the decision was going to be reversed, so I just sold ... I think the SP was heading to $18 by the end of May, sad"

"2021 Will be a great year for Culp and Board of directors with those juicy multi million salary deals NOT GE.Expect massive layoffs ,offshore outsourcing and increase of GE goods prices to meet his market price goal."
There is absolutely no this stock goes back to the single digits in the foreseeable future. Little to no risk buying now. Upside is huge! $20 here we come.
General Electric stock price target raised to $13 from $12 at Oppenheimer
Reverse split for GE? or I read wrong?
I’m going to the moon see ya all
"Is Buffet, and I don’t mean Phoebe Buffet, going to announce a new 13F after the close with 10-50 million shares?"
With the US credit rating at jeopardy GE might be headed to $11.50 a share.
So Barons is still quoting Tusa who has been downgrading the company from it low of 5.48. The stock has gained over $60 billion in market in sync with his downgrading. And to think he is making a 6 figures income with bonuses for spewing out his BS. One wonders if his firm bought shares every time he launched into his downgrading.
GE is on the way to $15.00.
Amazing GE
"they say they are going to burn cash first quarter. The question would be if they are going to burn cash the second, the third.....hopefully not"
"Big fan of this company but, moving up 5% because a 777 engine blew up and it wasn't GE's, isn't really justified. I'm a buyer at $11.15 once the irrational exuberance settles down a bit."
Culp over Tusa the loosa.

What are the chances GE restores the dividend?

"what I like about Culp is that the guy just works and works and works quietly and in the end he gets unbelievable results, and no one believes him. Even Danaher is not a high profile company. But it does not matter, the guy gets you the results which are reflected in the price of the stock, and this is what matters."
When you sell off part of the business reverse splitting allows for a more reasonable amount of shares. People are looking way to much into this.

GE engines are much better. Newer 777 are installed with GE engines. GE brings quality and good things to life.
"General Electric asked investors to do some difficult math last week about its balance sheet and accounting, and the investors balked. Shares fell as shareholders digested a lot of news related to complicated debt actions, asset sales, and accounting consolidations. In the end, the outcome—less debt is a good thing, but the one thing that investors hate is confusion.But on Wednesday, General Electric (ticker: GE) CFO Carolina Dybeck Happe offered clarity on the company’s debt plans, telling investors exactly how the conglomerate will manage its debt between now and 2023. The good news: More debt reduction is on the way, and GE is taking a conservative and transparent approach toward its debt management. Investors are breathing a sigh of relief, and the stock is up."
Poor judgement as indicated by the street's reaction to this #$%$
Lot of buying has happened in big lots today by funds
jj we warned you change your habit
Boeing 777 engine problem must not be GE engine = Good for GE for more engine sell
Huge saving on interest for GE by reducing its debt 30 Bil. !
To Marc down below: I think the name is Welch. Just for your edumication.
"ge engines part 420 percent longer life and as much as 65 percent more power to weight.GE Aviation invests more than $1 billion each year in research and development, positioning the company to lead advancements in military propulsion for generations to come.GE Becomes Leading Commercial Engine SupplierBuilding on the technology of the TF39 military engine, GE moved aggressively into the civil market in 1971 with a derivative engine, the CF6-6 high bypass turbofan engine, on the Douglas DC-10. The CF6 family grew to include the CF6-50, CF6-80A, CF6-80C2 and CF6-80E1. In the 1980s, the CF6 family of engines emerged as the most popular engines powering wide-body aircraft, including the Boeing 747 and 767, the Airbus A300, A310, A330 and the McDonnell Douglas MD-11.The CF6, in service since 1971, continues to add to its impressive record of flight hours, more than any other commercial aircraft engine ever accumulated. To put that in perspective, it is the equivalent of one engine running 24 hours a day, 365 days a year for more than 26,000 years.The CF6-80C2 engine, which entered service in 1985, has set new standards of reliability in commercial service and has been instrumental in the rise of GE as a leading supplier of large commercial engines.Perhaps the greatest compliment afforded the CF6-80C2 was the U.S. government's selecting the engine to power the U.S. president's 747 aircraft, Air Force One.The CF6 engine family, in service since 1971, continues to add to its impressive record of flight hours, more than any other high-thrust commercial jet engine ever accumulated. To put that in perspective, it is the equivalent of one engine running 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, for more than 28,000 years."
One day 3.00 bounce back coming. Wait for it. It's gold Jerry gold.
"Tomorrow this goes below $10.00!! Market is going to drop anyways due to profit taking before the weekend, this accelerates GE's decline!"
Up up and away! GE soon 12 and more!
Tomorrows headline. GE beats market.
Dead dog bounce. GLTA.
"Say what you want, Tusa holds huge sway over GE. I don't agree with him at all, but give him his due. Buy."
I think Apple is preparing a $23 per share offer for GE. Apple needs to make a bold move. :-)
GE nearing 1996 stock highs. Wow. So much has happened in 25 years and GE is at the same price.
"Here is my take, Was a holder of GE back with Jack, sold all under Jeff in high teens after one bad move after another, could not take any more. I bought back in not long ago about 6 to 7 area few thousand shares. At that time I wanted GE broken up as I knew the value was much more than 6 and change, but figured worst case would be to see it crawl back up over the next few years. I have to say Culp doing a great job and in time I believe with a small raise in dividend and a few less shares we will see the teens again...... But Now is the time for share buy back not when its more money, look at the last buy back, lets not wait till its too high again !!! We need to see action now, it will put GE back on the road to recovery. Lets not do the same old mistakes of the past. Are you listening MGT."
All these peeps talking about dividends - who cares about dividends! Capital appreciation is for winners not some 4% handout each year.
Anyone think GE will break $10?
"nuff said... GE Future which way will it go....Total assets of the company in 2019 (in millions of dollars): 266,048Market value as of March 31, 2020 (in millions of dollars): 69,406Total employees of the company in 2019: 205,000It would have been the number one company in our list but unfortunately General Electric had gigantic losses which pushed it down our list. Just a decade ago, it was among the most profitable companies in the US but has underperformed majorly since and has become one of the biggest loss making companies in the world."
cat bouncing hard on monday
it is funny how people assume shorting a stock is somehow un american!
EOD climb
We can see $14 tomorrow 
On its way.
"Go ahead, continue believing in this dead company. China set to deliver response to Boeing, Airbus in 2021"
$2.5 to $4.5B is a bit of a swag. Understand the macro environment but gimme a break. I could have made that swag.
"GE ""SHORTS"" are going to get the lesson of a life time ,stock will probably end the day up, then watch for a big DJ up day soon, when the ""shorts"" turn buyer along with other UBS buyers $20"
buy more GE with any down
"Had there not been a reverse split announcement, we would have just done a deal that erases a massive amount of debt, and still allows for upside as aviation recovers. And it sounded like there is already an agreement in place for GE to exit.We would have another massive deal of 737’s being sold, and two huge upside days in the market. GE would likely be trading over 15 a shareAs irrational as I think it is, the RS has essentially erased 20%. Frustrating because even positive news is having zero impact Boeing sells a bunch of jets, their stock increases and GE slides on the RS.Brutal."
"Another very bad day for shorts! If they are still holding their positions, today will shake them out!"
I’ll sign up for class-action
"BoA just raised their price target on GE to $14 today. Google ""Benzinga GE"" ."
Lots of volume when we get over 12
"J J.....why buy calls?....this is why....when Buffet invested in BAC at 7.25 I took all I had and bought deep in the money..far out calls...20k in fact and rolled them over for almost 5 years...sold when BAC hit 27.75....profited $3.8 mil...did not worry about every up or down zig zag during that time....afterwards took profits and bought 75k AMD deep in money calls when it was 4.5.....same strategy...sold at 77.23....profited $5.4 mil. Put $175k into GE in the 7's and BA in the 150's just to keep some interest and entertainmdnt in the market.....remaining went to a financial advisor into capital preservation instruments where I dont care if the market goes down 75%...wont lose a penny. Both situations were turnarounds with solid, respected leadership in Monoghan and Su.....just like GG has now.....with a long term timeline..BA a duopoly and a best in class is just a matter of time....Relocated to Fla Keys and my decision each day is do I take my boat fishing on the bay or the ocean and if the wind blows I check in on these boards for some comic relief....and thats' where you come in oh Notradomis.......so keep gambling with your ""trading""......and maybe someday youll find a better answer to your ""calls"" comment....M O R O N...."
The corporate increases are coming and we are not talking stock price increases either! Pay attention to the news!
We will recover positively today. I will not be surprised either if we go back to $14 per share. GE is GE.
(ADOM) 0.48 /CHEAPEST E-Cars maker =2000%++UPSIDE like TESLA
GE could jump to $15
"re good news in near future,the $45 billion gives Culp places to change GE, $18-$20 soon"
day traders watch the 11- 1pm time frame if it is weak then its toast
"Larry may be correct about the number of shares float. Looking at similar companies most have less than a billion shares float. Boeing as an example has only 583 million shares. By doing an RS 8:1 reduces the number of shares in GE to 1.1 billion and the share price will be around $100. On the other hand, Microsoft has 8 billion shares and that has not increased volatility nor has it stopped the rise in the share price. In other words, there is a strong argument for either the pro or anti RS action. I am against a reverse split and will vote no. The market has the same sentiment."
"TODAY JANUARY 29 2021 BOUGHT MORE GE 1,000 MORE SHARES .. HOPEFULLY REDDIT & ROBINHOOD START BUYING GE SHARES ... ATTENTION REDDIT: WALLSTREETBETS"
who would hold GE with a 1-8 reverse split
1/8 RS I am out. what a shame
Those $15 calls were soooo in reach. Thanks for the kick in the balls GE.
Buy GE going higher and higher
Culp promised positive FCF in the 4th and beat earnings in the 3rd. He has always under estimated. Analysts estimate positive FCF of 2.5B. Buying this dip.
"I was very happy that GE was on the rebound and I thought that with the sale and infuse cash flow and focusing on core businesses, we would be heading to where we should be (20-30 range). Until.. the RS rumor/leak/announcement! What the efing is going on? I know that valuation is intact, and all that.. So can anyone tell us what is the purpose of the RS and how will it be good for the stockholders when the share price will be 8 times higher?"
"GE is still punishing bagholders after decades, TMV is not on your side, keep compounding your penny lol."
GE held up extremely well over the past rocky weeks.Clear sailing ahead!

now the cheapskate like JJ can not play around with his weekly pay check anymore...
"Been bullish here since Jan 2018. Saw a light after management shake-up and even more with debt restructuring, better structure withing the Board, and sensible asset sell-offs and no frills outlooks and updates from top brass. I hope Culp is around for another decade."
GE is a buy and hold!
Who was bragging about the 10K short this morning. He will cover at or above $12.50

"Boeing plane, Boeing stock goes lower. Guess which stock goes lower with it? I will give you a hint. You own the stock. Anyone? Go ahead, make a wild guess."
Options went down by 70% in one week even though we are at the same stock price one week later? What a manipulated stock.

LAST LAST CALL TO SELL GE BEFORE REVERSE SPLIT DOWN DRAFT COME INTO PLAY NEXT WEEK :)
Robinhood ears are short term traders or day traders.
Alot of cash on the side ready to buy. Just waiting for green light from the meeting tomorrow. Billions to pour in.
Climate change represents a huge risk. Renewable energy is an excellent way to mitigate that risk. Natural disasters are fueling this trend. Pain is a great motivator. Countries are putting their $$ behind the Paris Agreement.
"Still miss that weekly paycheck from GE Father retired from there so did Brother, hope this year returns to former glory."
There is no way that some of you guys have been holding for years plus and have not seen any profit.. NO WAY!!!! I am thinking this company should be a good company.. It seems like it is trying to get involved in almost every sector.. I bought some call options because they were so cheap
GE IS UP X IS DOWN: The market giveth and takenth
Short sellers pushed it down with all its ammunition... a short squeeze may happen soon if GE gets upgrades...
Priceline 1:6 in 2003 Stock up 10x since then.
"In the money March 19 Call Options for strike price $8, $9 & $10 putting a lid on GE share price from going up. The MMs are pulling the price down to wipe out the option premiums at the tme of expiration?Hedging the long positions with some cheap $10 put options for March would be good..."
negative Cash flow this April earnings report as Larry Sculp said. watch value drop further on that day
Aviation and Earnings will bump GE stock up to $15. Great Bottom Fishing here. Start your jet engines!
"Weak hands are fleeing , a couple of quarters of increasing revs/earnings / cash and restoration of the dividend and fistfights will break out trying to get hold of a few shares ...if a company is not on the ropes not in danger of delisting , an RS can be a very bullish sign ... my guess is , if GE were to totally break up , the vlaue would be north of $30 /share ... garce"

Pratt and Whitney? Nahhh GE ALL THE WAY
"I'd say sentiment on this stock has been rising. Institutions are definitely nibbling more.I agree that ramping up airline bookings will see htis fly, but we're probably 4 qtrs away from seeing the results of that.Long term hold."
Well I guess TUSa is not going to get any dividends from GE.
I like the earnings last three quarters. Nice trend up.
"Ge please reverse split 1 for 8 ...so the cheapskate gambler can not play around with their weekly pay check, that way they can not buy then sell with 10 penny gain."
Baker Hughes is nearing a 52 week high. Good time for GE to cash out. Further improve the balance sheet.
"if you owned $ge, you saw how these law firms line up for no good use. Same happening to $acrx and $uavs. at the end weak hands will cash the loss."
Where is Tusa? hahhahahhaa
"It looks like GE has lost its direction...not sure where to head. shorts and puts and manipulators are causing it...rather shameful.......125 year old company can keep up with 50 cents of gain specially on days where the market is exploding and all sorts of good news and upgrades are falling from the sky for GE, but still sitting stagnant...LONGS will be the end winner, that's for sure........go GE go STRONG......"
MACD - great indicator - huge pop coming
"no news, ge tends to give back.good news will support the stockapproved arms deal includes ge , total 3 to 4 billionbut we dont know the extent of ges participation"
IMAGINE 350 MILLLION SHARES WAS SOLD YESTERDAY FOR GE. MEANING IT WILL GO DOWN MORE 10 DOLLAR IS THE FAIR PRICE.
Took some profit from my options today and plan to make some more... the force is strong with this one
"BAGGIES, how do you read GE's announcement of its improving cash flow from 26 January 2021? Since a firm's ability to pay dividends depends both on its earnings and cash flow, the rise of GE's cash flow during 2020-Q4 marks a potential turnaround for the long-troubled company. If sustained, GE will be able to afford a dividend rise.Is that what's going on here? Because if it isn't, the argument that shares of GE are becoming overvalued and its nearing time to sell becomes stronger if its shares are really trading within the vertical range they have since 2018. No dividend increase, is a sell signal. Shorts once again will win while BAGGIES are left with empty pockets."
Get into $GEVO while you can. Thank me later!!
Sorry make the rise now 7.62% today (so far)....:) :) :) !!!
"For longs & bulls, if your here because of Culp, reduced debt, better balance sheet, growth potential/good earnings moving forward in renewables, power, health, aviation, & digital, then the reverse split discussion should not worry you because the FUNDAMENTALS have not changed.IMO, sure pre-culp history w/GE makes folks skittish coupled with the appearance of any neg. news but either you accept the turnaround is happening (I think a lot support there) or you don't.Best to everyone."
"I don’t care what kind of business model GE has, they have provided on thing They can’t run a company."
Good Day to All GE Investors!!! :):):)
With the good news just announced I feel a nice Green Day for GE and if market cooperates too we should see a min $2 move upward. Good luck to all
Come on General. Let's close the week at 11.50 and make me happy.
"9:30AM GE starts the slow drip lower..,"
1-8 reverse split is what bankrupt companies do to consolidate when their stock price is penny's. It's as if GE decided to come up with the only thing that could have brought their stock down to below $10.00.
"""Keep the Faith"" - Sleepy JoeThis stock is going to be a roller coaster, but you can bet your bottom dollar this year GE turns around"
FALLING KNIFE........................................9.90 coming
$20 definitely is coming due to world economy strong next year plus the fact the world needs to go green. GE is right in the middle to provide green energy infrastructure and equipment. Buy low sell high.
"DÉJÀ VU FOR GENERAL ELECTRICIf this sounds a bit like déjà vu, there’s good reason. In April 2019, Communist China’s efforts to steal GE’s turbine technology were thwarted and resulted in the indictment of Xiaoquing Zheng, a GE insider who was discovered to have copied more than 19,000 files to a USB drive and had encrypted over 400 files on his desktop. Then Assistant U.S. Attorney General Demers noted at that time, “The indictment alleges a textbook example of the Chinese government’s strategy to rob American companies of their intellectual property and to replicate their products in Communist Chinese factories, enabling Communist Chinese companies to replace the American company first in the Chinese market and later worldwide.”Looking back a bit further, yet contemporaneous with the activities of Ng, we see that in October 2018, Chinese Ministry of State Security officer was arrested in Belgium and then subsequently extradited to the United States for his part in targeting and attempting to steal trade secrets and intellectual property from GE aviation.ALARM BELLS FOR COMPANIESWhile it is heartening to note the three separate efforts to steal General Electric’s technologies resulted in indictments, alarm bells should be sounding for every defense contractor regardless of sector.The alarm? Communist China is willing and able to steal your technology.Setbacks to their efforts don’t seem to dissuade Communist China’s intellectual property theft efforts."
I just told the wife and daughters dinner is on daddy tonight!
that Tusa fellow has been 100% wrong and just doesn't give up. he will eventually and then will have some kind of excuse.
People should be buying like crazy......GE is coming out of The ICU.
Vote No; on the reverse split!
Tusa obviously digging in his heals. We should already be at $15. Buy.
"Red, red and red again. See you at $4."
On the way to $16 by the time hummingbirds roll around.
GE is a top Biden Infrastructure stock. Probably headed for $20. :-)
"Bottom line, when earnings come around GE will price itself accordingly. Hoping that GE truly is on path for renewed success and profitability."
why stop at 8? let's do a 1 to 20 reverse split
Stephen Tusa can ya hear me now!?! Haha
thanks GE for screwing your investors ; first by cutting the dividend now you pull an end around reverse ? You are worse than a SPAC at this point ...
Wow! so great to see my portfolio today . Watching GE negate thousands of dollars of gain from other stocks because of a seemingly reckless decision that is baffling even CNBC analysts... just couldn't leave well enough alone.. strating to understand why this stock had been in the crapper for years.......
Buy and HOLD is the only way we go up!!! The paid Russian bot bashing comments here are proof of it
There dumping their shares already . Reverse stock split are stock price killers
strong 1pc green in AH.
Where’s Tusa hiding?
Break $14 GE GOOOOOOOOO
"The literally own CNBC and could get on air within seconds and stop this bleeding, but instead their drawing out a conversation regarding the virus."
Looks like today is payday. Congrats to all of us long here.

GE will bounce right back and be over $15 within 2 weeks. Mark this post.
Underwear getting real tight for ole cowboy... 5 tics up in after hours doesn’t mean much... .. or does it for Monday?HEHEHEHEHE
"Looks like analytics cannot read properly. In WSJ it was clearly said it is a MERGER, not sale, to build the biggest aircraft leasing company in the world. Probably this is a manoeuvre to lower the price deliberately"
"Reverse split not necessary as GE's stock was recovering organically and the consequent rise in stock price keeps many small investors from getting into the shares. Buying shares at 14 is much better than trying to buy shares at 112 (assuming yesterdays close). Once the reverse has occurred, the shorts will have plenty fuel to short term attack GE and drive the price down for at least a while. I don't understand, this makes no sense and is very un Culp characteristic as it will (for a little while) simply cause un-do pressure on the share price by giving the shorts more fodder. I'm still long GE, but I may (for at least a while) regret it. Longs expect pressure on the stock for a while; bummer!!!"
Today is an excellent day to add now that the weak hands are being pushed out of the way. It's the day for the strong hands to hang in there and add. We have a good CEO that will lead us in the right direction.
cramer was right ford better buy then GE....
I could have bought my coveredd call back for pennies. And got out at 14 . This split is sinking the stock. Even if it works it will be years before it return to and equal of 14 . We believed in Culp. Not I think he cammed us.
I remember when the same thing was happening with this stock at $10.69 on February 1st.
A close above $14 by the end of the week would be great. It’s nice to see some decent volume lately as well
This company can barely generate 50 cents of free cash flow. Worth 10.....Reverse split coming.
"Short show up with different name every single day They are loosing, big time They do not realize Tusa is almost ready to change his mind he starts saying positive about Ge Do not underestimate the power of earning FCF"
"I just booked 4 different RTs on United. I’ll be vaccinated. I’m traveling. And I haven’t even booked my European trip yet, my golf trip to Scotland or my trip to Bali yet."
Same Ole song and dance!!
"Another painfully low volume, extremely disappointing day for GE. The “big guys” just aren’t buying GE’s turn around plan."
Any $0.10 up move on a day is an opportunity to short (day trading)..
"""The company said the timing of the reverse split will take place, at the board's discretion, before the one-year anniversary of its 2021 annual shareholder meeting scheduled for May 4."" Wow, that's a convoluted way of saying the reverse split will happen anytime between now and May 4, 2022. I've seen how a stock price can tank after a reverse split. Just get it over with, so we can buy afterwards. This impending negative catalyst is going to cause the stock price to stagnate!"
"after the holidays last month horrific rise in new cases of covid 19 , restrictions in place, us vaccinated 10% ? of its population. latest count, numbers increasing.travel on the mind of many.culp, your investors would like to hear from you. general market swings, nice environment for traders"
GEeeeeee watch me be $100 stock.
"Let’s crack it!! GE can hardly loose anyhow with health care and renewables ! Let’s move it, good for technical leadership and the country !!"
"Spanish renewable power retailer Capital Energy has ordered GE turbines for its 39-MW Loma de los Pinos wind farm project in Andalusia, its first in Spain’s southern region.The company plans to invest over EUR 36 million (USD 43.6m) in the project. Construction at the site in the municipality of Lebrija, Seville province, started in early December 2020 and is expected to last for about a year."
"WOW, nice comeback."
"GE managers aren't stupid. Yesterday's information on AerCap for this action would mean + $ 2. It's not convenient for big boys. Therefore, information about the split appeared. The course collapsed. When the options expire, it will move up. And no one will remember the split."
AA’s 737 MAX engine failed two day’s led to emergency land. It is good that no casualties happening during this emergency landing. Could this lead 737 MAX temporary suspension to fly again?
"lawsuit dismissed on friday, now watch CULP move ahead with another m&a deal, over $12.50 next week"
"Did you guys see the volume in the jan 15 strike 12 calls today? WOW over 35,000 already. Some are pretty sure this ends the week way over 12 bucks."
The hedge funds may be looking at GE as a leveraged buyout......
Up over 5% so far in 2021.
Unreal this finished up...
"For mutual fund is a good deal. Also, may increase dividends and become a value stock."
Why didn't you buy GME instead?
This could go back to 7.30 ish
"When all this money comes out of the market, where does it go? Bank CD's, Bonds, Real estate, cash in Purses & Pants pockets, new car and the like. Right.It wont stay out for long. No other good place for investment. Patience, won't be long."
The Cup and Handle pattern resembles a cup with a handle. They are continuation patterns and usually form in bullish trends. Most of these patterns are very reliable and offer great trading opportunities. They also form in all markets and in all time-frames.

Immelt on CNBC. Trying to sell a book....
"https://worldairlinenews.com/2021/02/21/uniteds-flight-ua-328-from-denver-to-honolulu-suffers-an-engine-failure-returns-safely-to-den-after-engine-parts-fall-on-broomfield-co/DENVER — United Airlines announced Sunday they will be grounding 24 Boeing 777 aircraft powered by Pratt & Whitney 4000 series engines, the same engine involved in Saturday's incident over the Denver suburb of Broomfield.The Boeing 777-200, heading to Honolulu, experienced a right-engine failure shortly after takeoff. The plane turned around and returned to Denver International Airport, landing safely. Debris from the engine fell onto a wide area of Broomfield, affecting homes and property in the Northmoor and Red Leaf neighborhoods. Nobody on board or on the ground was injured."
I've been through 3 reverse splits. Not one turned out good. Look at ACB. It's still only 1/3 the pre-reverse split price and that happened a long time ago.
30Bn of renewable energy backlog and dd growth and increasing margin.
Reverse the reverse split idea @generalelectric and watch the stock get its momentum back! Signed concerned shareholder.
"Ok, GE has fallen enough. I'm buying actual shares:11.98"
"Go LOOOOONGS Clearance Center to Flight GE you are cleared from flight level $13, expect altitude of $13.50 by pre market opening tomorrow, expect to climb to $14 by mid-day tomorrow. Also be advised there will be a few air pockets along the way during your flight tomorrow. IMHO GLTA..... GO LOOOOOOONGS GO.P.S. GE engines stay intact!!"
GE Train is leaving the station!
"We have a gap. I think we'll have to shut it down. But for now, let's enjoy this growth.Traders will then have their own moment and long-term investors will have the opportunity to buy cheaper."
8/1 reverse split  $105 share run Forrest run.
"Usually when a dog like this makes changes at the top and begins focusing on what’s worthwhile and selling off what doesn’t make sense the rebound in the stock can be significant. GE has been a basement dweller for so long and now they are actually in the sweet spot of what the rebounding economy wants. Comps for GE are pitiful, the valuation even to its peers is way discounted. This really has potential to trade to $35-$40 range this year, which seems ludicrous but turnaround stories like this generally way overshoot what the market expects."
There’s only 9 billion shares of this ongoing fraud. The sec again didn’t do there job 200& million fine. They should be restating all those yrs this is a ponzi any other company would be at 1$ a wels notice usually results in bankruptcy. Ge will be there soon enough. Fraud was committed for many yrs nobody gets in trouble. That earnings report was horrible who’s the dummy’s that bought this up 12% should have fallen glad I sold my puts yesterday
What are the chances we can duplicate today’s performance tomorrow?AH seems flat or slightly downI’m hoping for a big positive day tomorrow to make it 3 in a row
Hey everyone. JJ just shorted 10k at $14.34! 
What did you investors learn from the GE’s outlook meeting?
MAYBE JJ IS TUSA HIDING UNDER JJ LOL
"it go down because humans only think of GE a commerical airline(s) laiden with debts and no way out - locked down and restrictions. GE is a buy for long term, may be 2 to 3 years. may be 2022. it will never be go up and go up and never come down, there are so many compnay to buy, GE is just one of them, there are so many company to lose your money, GE may be one for short term."
"insider buying just the beginning, The Year of the CULP and $75 billion buying power for M&A will bring a $30 stock price"
Great buying opportunity
AT LEAST IT SHOULD GO DOWN TO $12.50 TO CLOSE THE GAP THANK YOU LORD FOR FOR $13.30 SHORTED MORE
Shorts don't have the Donald to save them. Do you think Lying Joe cares about the stock market?
"JJ was calling for 9 dollars a bit earlier. What he really meant to say is: I see upside of 9 dollar for GE, so we will see 20 dollars by January next year. :)"
"yahoo ge average target raised again by a few pennies to 12.24i still like ge, an occasional trade until culp announces some action to give this stock the push we are looking for."
A self inflicted wound. Unintended consequence or intended?
hahahaha 13.13 will be 14.14
"No one knows who GE is anymore. We need a corporate cheerleader or two who can tell the world how wonderful our aircraft engines are, how great our medical products are, how outstanding our huge windmills are etc. Likewise they must explain that the junk with the GE name - washer/dryers, light bulbs, kitchen refrigerators/stoves are NOT made by GE. Let's get our name off of these immediately! Jack Welsh PHD (bless his soul) would emphasize quality, technical magic, beauty, and reliability coming from our doors, and make sure the world knows. Then he would quietly adjust the corporate financial reports reflecting the effect of these maneuvers and split the stock by 2 to 1 every couple years.I believe Mr. Culp could learn all this in a year or two."
BIGGER TOMORROW to $15
"GE Announced Tons Wednesday. This Was the Real Bombshell General Electric (ticker: GE) is proposing to give investors one share for every eight they now hold. That will take its share price to about $112, based on recent levels, reducing the shares outstanding to about 1.1 billion fromI do not have full access to the article , but other than the few here who think it was not a bid deal , everyone else thinks so"
$4 remains our target. Long live Tusa and Markopolos
"Alot of news today. But, i think this is the time to add to the position."
"Early morning sweep the stops, then the near limits before $12. Given the news we should break through the ceiling soon, then comes $15."
Well two fast money traders said to buy Ge tonight
GE is the 2nd largest holding in TRowe Price Capital Appreciation fund. The manager David Giroux is a genius at buying value. This alone has given me confidence in the turnaround and pushing in a lot of my chips.
"Reverse split does not change market value, FCF,, profitability and does not change the operations in any way. The run up is based on fundamentals...the drop premarket is based on nonsense. Robinhood investors buying 2 shares at a time are not what is driving the stock up when there are 8.6 billion shares. So forcing investors to buy 8 shares at a time only excludes guys like JJ that can only afford to buy or short one share. Lol. The deal that he did does functionally change cash and value.I’m holding on...one day bump is not shaking me"
"All you #$%$ who think $GE is going under must have very little understanding of what the next 10 years will look like for clean energy manufacturing. GE has the a lot of skin in the game compared to these new electric companies who haven't even produced a dollar, let alone build much assets.... We are still up 3% on the month... in the middle of a pandemic... check back on this stock in a year and tell me if I was wrong"
BARRON's. ARTICLE on 4 reasons GE stock down today...anyone with access care to share? Thanks
"GE CASH & LIQUIDITY $$100+ BILLION+ $30Bn from Finance Leading sale ($40+ BILLION CASH in USA+ $30Bn abroad+ $$25 BILLION Line of credit UNTOUCHED). GE PAID OFF near $$70 BILLION debt/pension.. GE SPENT $$120 BILLION DISPOSABLE CASH in buying back stock, paying debt, LTC, pension, and set aside other things.. GE IS A CASH MACHINE.. At this rate GE CASH FLOW Will be $$$20 BILLION"
"Indexes have a big gain, our GE didn’t move much. People are moving away to growth stocks again, buying these high flying conceptual stocks again for quick money. They are no patients to waiting for traditional stocks such as GE."
lot of buying last few minutes of trading day! Down a few pennies after hours!
"tomorrow is going to be up because I sold all my 10,000 shares today.....no other reason other than my luck"
A division with $36B in assets is merging to make a company worth $30b? Does that make any sense?

Are the Reddit people about to visit GE? Gee. I hope not. :-)
Largest pension in the world out of Canada quads it’s GE shares. US teachers pensions next.
I think I will vote NO on the stock split.
"Some people will have a bad day, buying back their short shares. Nice. "
"Now i know why they got rid of the slogan, GE brings good things to life. GE has been dead for years."
"I keep having a recurring dream of $GE hitting $25 this year, and the funny thing is the way the stock is moving on the chart it may happen. Second, third and fourth quarter earnings should send us there."

GE is back !Very bullish.Mr. Culp thank you !! (Also all GE employees)
you do all realize that ge was in process to sell to the China ccp
"Longs are so happy today, they will not lose any money."
I owned GE when they spun off Synchrony. I never got a share of SYF. So I dumped....no gain but no loss. Glad I got out. Recently I was considering getting back in to GE. Now the RS announcement....NOPE...I'm staying out of this. Total disrespect to shareholders so they can make the share price nice.
"I am long with GE since 6.50 but I have a feeling its going to get beat down tomorrow. Its ok, hold the line, this is going up up up."
"12 BABY!....NEXT STOP 13, 14 ,15..."

Denver 777 Engine Failure was a Pratt and Whitney PW4077. That’s going to be about it for this engine. Airlines will replace all of them with GE engines. Don’t fly on a plane using the PW4077.
GE’s Cash Surprise Is Better Than Bonfires PastBut “surprise” is still the key word in its earnings. You just don't see such dramatic swings at other manufacturers.
I would hate to be a short this week! Two catalysts at play. GECAS AerCap merger and COVID-19 relief bill.
"Expect Larry to step out a little more and harness the momentum. Difference between him and the next CEO , he backs it up in a very large way."
"LOL... for the last month this is the ONLY stock I own that has gone up, and yesterday I was finally able to buy more shares.The stock almost immediately lost value.And now a reverse split.Unbelievable."
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood .... Thanks to GE ! 
5% reversal in the last hour??? WOW!
Next bounce coming.
Reverse split puts you at $104 per share. Then it drops to $60 - $80 range for fund managers to scoop up shares before moving higher.
expect this haircut to take us back to 10 and change...the institutions will wait for a solid bottom of a week or so before adding to portfolio.. i don't see a lot of price drop post split
"I’m reading a lot of disappointment in the operational availability of F-35s. I’m not sure if it is due to the design, or poor reliability of supplier assemblies. The pavement to F-15EX, and other less costly operations, like Skynet drones is going to be getting a lot more attention."
smash the sell button and take your profits...it's just that easy!

"$GE is still selling at a deep discount, I buy it because it has real value, and great growth potential. $GE to $24+ this year!"
"REVERSE SPLIT IS A GREAT IDEA!!!Culp is crazy like a fox.At $12 he can't increase the dividend by a penny (100%) as the share count would make it very expensive. After the the RS, he can afford to raise the dividend by a penny, 12.5% increase at 1/8th the cost.A 12.5% increase in the dividend will show strength and investors will drive the stock price up.This is just an old man's opinion. Lol"
A lump in the shorts shorts
GE is up over 17% so far THIS YEAR!!
Unions are still eating GEs lunch profits. They wrecked aircraft engines in several locations before and are making a fortune selling coffee and donuts lol. Its true!
It wants to go up so badly. It is so exciting
Should G.E. be buying back shares while the price is still cheap?
14 by Friday? Amazing run up. I am going to standby and watch. Been holding since 2017 13.25 average. Glad to see shares positive
When will the reverse split take place
stop selling its will go up to the moon........... BUT STOP SELLING AND YOU CAN BY MORE
Would be beautiful if GE started running up fraudulently like like GME. FCEL PLUG etc
"I thought is us the shareholders., that has the vote"
WATCH N LEARN TOMORROW DOWN AGAIN HEHEHEHE FRIDAY DOWN DOWN DOWN TO $11.00

close under 13 and water fall decline
"Expect the AERCAP deal details to be part of the Wednesday conference call being held by General Electric.GECAS may merge wih AERCAP and together they may spin off the two companies into a new company with part ownership by each firm in proportion to their parts. That might make sense....I doubt that this is a straight $30 billion sale of GECAs to AERCAP. I t has too much debt for AERCAP and AERCAP is too small for that sort of deal in the middle of a pandemic and a slow-down aircraft leasing industry. Their sales in 2020 were under-performing and poor..More importantly, someone on this thread said that the GECAS-AERCAP dela would erase $25 billion or 1/4th of the GE Capitalization. Totally wrong.GECAS may be valued at $30 to $40 billion, but it only generates $5 billion per year at GE Capital and it doesn't seem to make money. It is also about 1/2 of the total GE Capital holdings of around $10 billion.And another analyst (CFRA Research) falsely said that by selling GECAS and BIOPHRMA - General Electric was getting rid of the crown jewels. They said the RENEWABLES AND POWER divisions were losers.Wrong. RENEWABLES AND POWER are the new horizon for General Electric. Both have a ton of growth and promise. While they have not made a lot of profit in the past - they can make a lot of profit going forward.GECAS at $5 billion yearly sales and BIOPHARMA t $3 billion yearly sales are just 8% sales of the $100 billion General Electric was recording in 2018. And the large growth of RENEWABLES from $8 billion sales in 2018 to $15 billion sales in 2020 and probably approaching $20 billion sales in 2021 more that offset the GECAS AND BIOPHARMA loss of sales volume.I think GE RENEWABLES will soon be clocking 8% bottom line of $1.6 billion Free Cash Flow in 2021. And remember - GE has not said it was selling GECAS. It is entering into a strengthening deal to change the GE Balance sheet. That is magic in the account industry of how giant industrial companies wring out the best numbers.Look for Larry Culp to squeeze every drop of profit and balance sheet readjustment that is possible going forward while keeping the four crown jewels of the present General Electric.And for serious investors and stockholder - what could be better for the stock than profits going forward, debt erased, and improve balance sheet in the near future ...."
"GE is great at manipulating the numbers. So, sure the earnings and revenues will be above expectations.Don't be surprised if it jumps up $5 and may go above $20/share. Long term prospects not so rosy!If that happens - Sell!!"
"CEO Flannery was GE Shareholders friend.. Culp is a STOOGE, AGENT OF TH!EF JPM-P!GS, HELPING STEAL GE Shareholders VALUE, ASSETS, ie, Bakerhues BKR was sold for $9, BKR IS NEARLY ZEROOO net debt, OIL SERVICE COMPANY, STRONGEST BALANCE SHEET, stronger than SLB.. Culp sold CROWN-JEWEL Biopharma for half the price. GE Biopharma was a SWEET GROWTH FUTURE OF MED, already was FREE CASH FLOW POSITIVE $$1 BILLION, and revenue was growing 15% to 20%.. GROWTH at Biopharma was about to accelerate, but TH!EF JPM'S AGENT Culp sold Biopharma (GE DID NOT NEED THE CASH).. Helping JPM justify lower CRUSHED GE Share price. Still GE is SEVERELY UNDERVALUED comparison to its peers..."
"If this Garbage-Enterprise did not do the bone headed move of RS, it would be 15+. Also, if it ends red today, it shows no investor confidence. Look out. I am still scratching my head to understand what's the rush to RS when momentum is unstoppable. Cost investors a lot of money. I hope shorts will take it down to single digits. RS split is gold mine for shorts."

They also made a deal with Saudi Arabia. Just Google it. U.S. technology and engineering conglomerate GE said on Saturday it had signed $15 billion of business deals with Saudi Arabia as part of the kingdom’s drive to diversify its economy beyond oil.From May 20 2017
stop selling let go up over 1270 you dnot need to buy but dnot sell who is with me?
"Take a deep breathAnd then look at the 1 month and 3 month chartsThis brings GE down...but the trend is still solidly trending up even with today’s dropIm taking a beating on my calls, but I’m still holding them. I think this will recover in the next week."
If GE was financially strong and growing it would be buying back its stock. But it's not and the outlandish amount of shares outstanding is ridiculous. You think GE is going to be attractive to the small investor at $ 130 per share. ? And there will still be billions of shares outstanding.
Looks like GE might retest $12 again. The option holders of 66000 contract calls might want to make a push GE stock to pass $12 today. Can it be successful?

Up to 11.90 premarket and then drops to 11.68??? Who is selling shares premarket? I do not understand that.Strange
What time does Larry Culp speak tomor confirming Aviation deal?
I hate reverse splits no matter why they happen..... not good
if the Reddit people get hold of this stock - shorts look out. I would not want to be short this stock right now. this could so very easily to to 20 in the blink of an eye. truly (IMHO) this is not the time to play the short game right now. just cover your shorts and get out for a while until the buying frenzy subsides; maybe in a year or two. those little people in Reddit can do a lot of damage to hedge fund short sellers right now. just not worth it to my way of thinking. Reddit is the iceberg and short sellers are the titanic. just my opinion folks!!!

"is here anybody, who believes explanation ,why Rs is necessary?"
Has anyone heard from Tusa... I am wondering if he still got a job !!
I feel like Tusa is pulling string to get the stock down. Each time it is something different. I get the Power situation and negative cash flow. GE is heads strong on fixing it and letting other areas (aviation and healthcare) move along with not as much overseeing from Culp.Last week every where I read it was the true winner of Paris Air is GE!! Bullish comments from several.Tusa comes out and says aviation may be valued at under $40 billion and not 100 billion and negativity about Aviation.I feel now he is trying anything possible to get this to drop to $5.Even Inch who I am not a fan of has not made negative comments in past few months other than keeping his $7 target. he at least said GE will not go insolvent.
"Nokia Battle raging on...more than 60 million shares premarket !! Some profit taking, rest: cold sweat for shorties!!!"
@Nasir - You will soon own 1/8 the amount of GE stock that you own now!Standing ovation for the reverse split!
Why a reverse split. Is it to save four cent a share from div .it makes no sense .
Be ready for an upgrade on price target tomorrow - I see this hitting $13+ in the coming days. Free cash flow and beating expectations. 
This is the kind of decision that takes the company down the toilet 1/8 RS are they comparing GE to Apple  GE stock should drop $2 then they can do 1/8 RS.

The break at 13 was huge. Now at another resist point...could see $18 if strong breakout

My Vxrt up a lot today. Pill covid vaccine news coming out soon. GE should be heading toward $20 also.
"Glad I exited with a profit .I would consider buying again after the split & a decline to the teens again .Until then , I will move on to greener pastures"
Too many have been disappointed and burned by GE in the past! Don't expect a sudden move consistently up!Respect and trust that has been lost takes time to rebuild. Fact is GE is only expected to earn 25 cents/share for all of 2021!! If it rises to $15 to 20 ----SELL!!!

I hope everyone is seeing what I am. Opportunity to short this! This is sinking like The titanic!!
"watch the savvy investor buying up these cheap shares as the little, week investors dump for no reason. It’s dollar for dollar it means nothing and only people that know that are savvy investors. So what’s happening is exactly what GE wanted to happen. Add some more if interested and continue the ride up over the next few years."
"In my opinion, getting in under $20 is good now. I see this hitting $30 by EOY"
"In a piece about the stocks recent performance and things potentially weigh, ask yourself why there would be zero mention of the announcement of a 1 for 8 split. They address every other mjr topic Culp mentioned last week, except the 1 for 8 RS. I mean it's such a great thing for the value of the stock... pimp that news. Unless they want to minimize that, get the price up before the RS is implemented and get out. https://www.barrons.com/articles/ge-still-favorite-for-bulls-despite-stock-drop-51615826006?siteid=yhoof2"
conversation open. has anyone ever seen a positive result from reverse stock splits. honestly I would say under 10%. bad move on their part I believe they will lose institutional ownership
"AH trading coming to end, if you want to sell do it now, otherwise keep you peace."
If this reverse split was such a great idea the stock would be trading at a minimum of 15. I am short and will maintain it after the split whenever that is
V shape recovery. will never see the $12 again
"Realistically, almost everybody is using a GE product."
something is wrong in this stock market when only GME and some meme stocks are on the rise...smh
"New POTUS, NewYear, same #$%$ 8 years of dividends gone in a day."
Typical GE trading range...
I'm keeping my shares whether shareholders approve reverse stock split or not. GE has a much better future than recent years. Remember to vote shareholders!
"Do you see the hyping of debt reduction over reverse split? They know reverse split is bad bad bad. The real question is, what happens after the reverse split? 1. Borrow more money?2. Issue new shares and dilute?3. or what?Tusa said the share don't worth over $5. Keep that in mind."
GE target is $30 in couple months here
Listen to Brent. The eternal bag holder hoping you will bail him out. Mute Brent. He wants you to lose more money.
"Just for the record, I am voting ""NO"" .... Absolutely ""NOT"" with my 486k shares !!!!!!!!!"
Reverse split. NOOO. It will find its way back down to $30 again.
General Electric is up 5.41% to 12.67
OMG NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
"Ok, all you shorts rest easy and sleep well. I certainly hope you don’t see news across your screen that some Firm comes out with an upgrade of GE and a $14-16 price target. I mean, I’d really hate to see this at $13+ tomorrow! Lol"
"If the reverse is a great idea why is GE getting clobbered on a big up day ? Just when it had started gaining traction and upgrades . How does a reverse make any sense ?The one poster talks about decreased volumes from day trading like GME . What ? When GME and AMC were under 5 voulumes were low , when they ended up 65, 75,100 plus volumes were insanely high from the day traders .Hardly think lowervolume is a reason. Last I recalled Apple is 119 and trades a bit heavy lol ."
R/S is just another trick companies that cannot make their pps go up use to hide their long term subpar performance........... GE is a 19th century company..........
"here is tusa for those looking up to him ............…investors business daily …………….But a long-time GE bear, JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa, was unmoved and reaffirmed an underweight rating on GE stock.After GE earnings, he said business fundamentals ""are not too dissimilar"" from his view earlier in the year. Meanwhile, he finds strong GE Aviation results ""hard to explain, with 19% profit growth on a 6% sales increase.""for investors here, my suggestion … try to do your own analysis.with the average analyst only getting it right approx. 50% of the time ............your chances are quite good to outperform........."
"GE sold 38.01 mln Baker Hughes shares on Friday, worth $735.06 mln"
Check 90 day chart. Since nov 2020 steady gains with a few reasonable gap ups.Now in 2 days 2 big red candles that gap down indicating institutional selling. at this rate $10 by end of next week is likely as near term put options indicate. The fund managers are driving this down and mid April & June call options indicate they will drive it back up by then. Looks like the biggest GE manipulators are Culp and the board with the RS.
"going below $12.00 at 200mill and much, much lower by the close!!"
Amazing how many people misinterpret reverse splits.
"Tusa wants to keep his reputation, he needs to be on the right side of GE history."
After two years of holding this garbage stock I cut my loses today and off to better opportunities. Today is a good day!
