"Holy cow Batman, they've downgraded Adobe. ""Robin, pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. Adobe will be making a lot of money for years to come ""."
Actual move of 3.15%-ish as opposed to the 3.75% priced move. These market makers are good.

"It looks like raising outlook, nice move, above 300 coming."
"when you have high PE, PS, and PEG (which means the stock is overvalued) the only way it will jump after ER is unexpected, strong rise in guidance. even if it meets the guidance it will go down to adjust to the real value compared to the industry"

"300 tomorrow, must be owned by big guys"
Adobe either has a major design flaw or has been hacked. Adobe programs are shutting down and wiping Chrome and it's data on customer's computers And of course Adobe's service is non existent. I have been waiting 4 days for a real tech to phone me as the first one from India didn't have a clue what to do.

PODCAST: Adobe Systems | The next great American acquisition target?!?! | http://investing-adventures.madewithopinion.com/adobe-systems-the-next-great-acquisition-target/#
Anyone know if the earnings report is tomorrow pre market or after closing
BANG!
What's up with this nice AH bump?
"Revenues estimates beaten, record results, more at seekingalphaSAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Adobe (ADBE) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended Nov. 27, 2020. In its fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, Adobe achieved record quarterly revenue of $3.42 billion, which represents 14 percent year-over-year growth. In fiscal year 2020, Adobe achieved record annual revenue of $12.87 billion, which represents 15 percent year-over-year growth."
340 !!! huge growth !
Omg no news about the earnings yet!
Undervalued but.. flat af for 6mon now heading 6mon low bruh
Big Joe is about to take a short position
I just bought a bunch more last night before this hike. I previously bought when at $82.92. I'm pretty pleased.
270 call 9/28. How screwed am I
Out at $234
It is time for the stock to split.
what's wrong with ADBE
"Someone please explain to me why some companies this earnings season provided weak guidance, and their stocks got crushed, and others like Adobe just gave guidance lower than expected (basically warning for next quarter) and the stock goes up 5% in pre-market? And then the sell side analysts create a self-fulfilling prophecy by raising the price target into the $325 range. So why is ADBE rewarded for lower guidance?"
"Will be closing my ADBE position today, looking for a nice day of upside movement. Stock was at $320+ for much of the day on Friday, until a slight last-minute dip just before the close. Nothing but weekend traders feeling jittery and nervous, IMO. As long as the general market is good today, ADBE still has plenty of upside potential to trend up to the $225+ level. I will be away from my computer most of the day, gonna us a Conditional order and slap a $330.00 Limit Sell and a $312.00 Stop Sell, in order to lock in a good profit for the day no matter what happens, as I am long at $305.80. Not expecting a dip, but want to play it smart. Protecting an existing profit is always smart, especially if you cannot fully monitor both market conditions and the stock itself during a trading day. Later this afternoon I plan to jump into HEI as a Long play. They report at 4:15 PM and the stock looks very good for a nice pop to the upside on a strong Earnings report, IMO."
I brought aswell good luck
ADBE will be hitting new highs within days.
Up we go from here. Positive indicators!!
"Already red after market, these earnings are not worth a penny ;)"
why the sell off
Don't listen to cramer.
What happens if apple were to disappoint? Lord have mercy .......
See if you can hold Adobe down today... we will rise!
"AdobeAt $337.52, Adobe stock is more than $45 off its Feb. 19 close""In my view, Adobe's the best of the cloud kings, and I like that Morgan Stanley just this morning bumped its price target from $410 to $450 in the teeth of an obvious sell-off,"" Cramer said."
why this stock up so big upgrade?
I'm gonna buy at 102 and not a dime more....
Why the need to prop this!!?? U scared mms its gonna crash because the whole world is long this like apple and screwed? My advice- step away and let this paper fall hard
Heading back up. CEO will be on Cramer tonight which should help put a good additional spin to the numbers. Should open at 255 tomorrow and rise from there.
Cloud stocks are back! ADBE will rebound with the others
ADBE worth $30
what happened?
"So sick of losing ALL I HAVE 100% losses every single day in Put options, Straight line up from 2002. from $1"
Down 200 coming
$150 today?
"destroys earnings, beats revenue, and goes down AH ?????....that's like eating onions at lunch and ripping a fart at dinner that doesn't stink"
Analysts are expecting too much and not fully accounting for the slower growth in the estimates. I am seeing this scenario over and over. Beating numbers isn’t good enough
PT Raised to $145 from $115 by Wunderlich
no growth..
ADBE reached an all time high at 308.98
"guys old days when adobe growth was generated by adobe photoshop suite cloud are over. Now in order to grow Adobe should go on a market were there are a lot of competitors (SHOPIFY , GOOGLE ETC). So this stock reached his high limit and from here it will go slowly down"
Adobe should buy ROKU! Like NOW!
"is there any chance earnings are not positive?I want to go all in £4,000 with this one"
PLEASE can someone tell me if I can buy. Or what is the right price to buy?
1929 repeat
even raising guidance
"if you know what you're doing as an investor or trader, don't sweat it. let the weak hands get out before making new HIGH. as time goes by, reality will set it. it's all in the numbers they just reported. noobs that don't know how to decipher those numbers will panick due to manipulation and sell off..."
closing in the GREEN
Adobe is down 4.93% to 333.71
Avoid Amazon with an upgrade today just only +0.60% terrible.....overpriced
"I bought this stock today because it had the strongest BUY rating by , well pretty much every financial investor. so I did"
Adobe blows the doors off earnings. I say billion in profit.
I expect at least 8$ jump after hours
"No idea at all. I am in the region of this company and there is no negative information in this timeframe that I am aware of that resulted in this movement. I still believe there will be a strong beats on the ER, which is AH today."
What is the long term profitability outlook on $CRM? Why do profits seem lower than other SAAS players like $ADBE
"Great shopping day. Picking up some cheap NVDA and $ADBE. $SNAP getting cheaper too, and I'm hammering it with more short selling because it's a worthless POS. Meanwhlie, $BOOM, $GOOS, and $MU are keeping my day's losses to a minimum. $FB selling off for no real reason. Perhaps it will take a few more weeks to hit $200."
Warned u to get out zero bids zero momoTrapped longs with no liquidity $amzn $adbe $aapl
weak movement so far
Excellent earnings and guidance by ADBE!!! GO ADBE GO!!!
Never seen massive numbers and great earnings and a stock goes down $10 this is insane
"Gonna crash, even with earning beat"
2 pm pst
"Garbage products, Garbage customer service, Garbage company."
"How much will ADBE fall tomorrow? My suggestion if management is smart enough to really think. I almost bought a new MacBook air pro but held off only to get pro logic to make music. What Adobe needs and must do Is make a tad simpler version like logic but with all new different sounds from Adobe. All the students at college think and say the same thing in my film classes, digital media courses, audio courses and in my coding software class. Adobe does not understand how much business in new student 20.00 subscription fees this would bring, plus students are dumping mac airs and going to newer lighter notebooks from msft. Can you imagine if Adobe big wig picked up the phone and called msft big wig, ...Let's both put money into this special collaboration project with a team of 40 of our guys and 40 of yours for 6 months to make our way better version of logic we will call Adosoft audio or Adobesoft. audition. Why because it will sell more new Microsoft laptops chosen over apple macbooks. That helps msft get buyers that feel forced to logic and final cut pro from mac. Two it helps adobe as the latest and greatest new app software out to make music. Adobe new high school and college subscriptions would skyrocket. Students talk and the new conversation for people making their own original songs would go from I'm buying the mac for logic and pro to. Forget those programs and the mac, Adobe teamed up the last six months with msft and completed a secret project called Adobesoft audition audio. It has 4 times the new choices as logic aapl takes their sweet time for a major update so they lost their old number 1 logic spot for good in six months from Adobe msft collaboration. Now the final way adobe sells more laptops for msft and msft who helped speed up what would have taken adbe a year in a half by themselves. So you go to the msft store, for 12 months they include the new adobe audition. Subscriptions and laptop sales skyrocket. Want to know the best part? All those new laptop buyers are learning adobe opposed to mac. Students don't like to learn the same thing twice. Regular business pro's that like microsofts new lighter long lasting battery life learned adobe audio and video editing instead of mac software. Now Adobe if msft says no, you call oracle, and go down the line not stopping until you are having a teleconference meeting with software engineers and musicians telling you what they like and how to make it simpler for them. Get everybody on the same page about the 6-8 month timeframe. Your jumping way out ahead of apple. Pass them while they are focused on apple tv and arcade with google arcade also on their heels. Print this out Adobe audition executive, take it to the boardroom and make it happen.Unleash the monster this stock could be again if you follow the steps exactly like this student wrote for your company for free. I cannot buy adbe stock till you do this. I'm in Nio before earnings Tuesday, bynd before my psychic abilities see a mcdonalds deal, roku because arms dealers always win and MAXR because the chart screams a short squeeze pop market maker induced right away to 15 before 21 a couple days later."
"Traders are bidding it up, breaking above $314 here.... :-)"
Every option is worthless
They’re just shaking weak out of the tree.

This is not just a blip on the radar folks. Those who have ever worked in video editing know full well that this is a true game changer.

I bought this stock a couple of years ago at $82. Think I'll buy more.

bought up 250 up already ...so i see it at 260 to 270 before long
average price target now almost $100 over the current price.. um w h a t
Eddie ain't getting any at 260.
What is it with this stock? Blow out results and increasing outlook and treads water to slightly down? I just don’t get it
under $400 before year end....$350 by the time Biden gets thru screwing silicon valley
Excellent results but forecast 2021 is a little bit lower than earlier expected.
"I would like to pose a question to true long investors - apart from AMD which other stock is currently as close and powerful, past and present holding? I had $SHOP (Bought @ $95 three years ago, sold @ $625 this April) and currently own $ADBE (Bought @$132 - three years ago)."
"New ATH next week after upgrades!Buy this temporary dip, will be green at the end of the day!"
movement is pretty weak
"If the world puts Covid in the rearview mirror, ADBE, over $1,000 in 18 months! Every new dollar falling to bottom line!"
"earnings in two weeks, I imagine it will slow between now and then, hopefully not much of a pull back though"
"ADBE might close 185$ today, lots of pressure has been built up, plus the upgrade to target 217$. 185 close is VERY REASONABLE. who knows MM plays this for option expire today"
Starting after hours today you won't be able to by this stock for less than 180. Any hints at a beat will drive it even higher pre ER.
"Thought, If Shopify is worth 70 billion, Magento has a chance to be worth a fortune if Adobe executes"
Cash in at open before it's too late.
Adobe is a bunch of Indians on all top positions and woke leftists with pierced bodies who are trying to convince us that Adobe is some sort of fun company with lots of creative ideas. HA three times. This company has a facade made in Photoshop and pretty toxic and rotten inside. Everything what Adobe touches turns to #$%$
"solid business and growth , waiting for mid 300s to buy"
Lower the guidance(most important). Tomorrow will see $270 I am shorting this at $285.50.
Great ride. Sold today.
What’s going on this morning with Adobe
What a beautiful closing figure ... 234.56$. Will sell at 345.67$
Adobe glory Days are over !
Fairly high volume today for ADBE
"U shape ... if u bought in high, u bout to break even"
Here comes $ 330.
"Adobe tanking haha. 450, then 400, then 300. Target P/E 30. It's reality time folks... called here comes Biden."
"Next rally cycle has begun, 5-day-bear-trap at 442."
"They raised the guidence 5% on EPS (which is by the way still in line with consensus) and just a bit on revenue.Now it's traiding 12 % up (was 8% lowest today).Where is the deal here ?I believe it's just an attemp of management to raise the stock befor earnings report, cause they feel that numbers won't impress the market. I'm shorting it."
Horrible chart toppy zero bad priced inWhich is scary
"Check out ZI, this could be a Buy Out target by...ADBE, CRM, etc"
"djh is correct of course, and ADBE reports an hour after the bell today. I bought it."
Buy at $277
Institutional investment pulled back from big tech out of fear. They'll be back.
ADBE finally beating to its own drum again. This is gonna be great
"Overstock reports thursday after the bell , look at sfly chart compared to OSTK and (lol they sell greeting cards) not a baby amazon I believe is going to give us a blowout # and rising revenue and guidancethat is both an earnings play and longterm hold in gaming CYOU and I like AAOI optical scanner company roku movie and tv streaming and fit (fitbit smartwatch)"
"Sold ADBE at $323.73 for a very, very, VERY nice profit on 190 shares. In at $305.80, out two trading days later at $323.73. Oh yeah, that's the way, aha aha, I like it... :-) Currently Long 500 shares of HEI at $126.95, and she is looking nice and perky in the AH session. Earnings were very good and I think this stock will also rally up further tomorrow, perhaps to the $135 level, as my modest winning streak hopefully continues. :-) Good Luck to All! :-)"
Its a bunch of options #$%$ about to go worthless in a few hours...I'm not satisfied at all..but not selling. Needs to take out 190.
This company preforming the worst among the tech companies! Today nasdaq above 100 points and adbe is only $5 up while other techs are $20 up!!I can't wait to sell
Took time to mute all spam= nobody left on this board
"wow, this stock is so cheap?~~~ gonna get some tmr finally price I can get in"
"oh, jprourke1956, that's #$%$...nobody's listening to you. Triple bargain. Price discount, earnings beats, and unaffected by corona. You'll see in 45 minutes, ratface."
U better get in folks
Adobe is up 4.91% to 441.90
hahaha you morons should've sold sell now and buy AAPL
"Long stock, short call is a must this time."
my current strategy is to buy until my cost basis is 500. I started buying tesla at 330 with the plan of adding up until my CB was 500 and that has worked very well thus far. Phil town and Warren b would call this the accumulation phase
"Beat on every metric, share buyback announced, very good guidance...how is this not up 5%???"
it looks like earnings are out and ADBE has been halted. OMG!
ADBE smashes sales revenues and earnings!!! GO ADBE GO!!!
shorted this tr_ash 321
"Good article, including the Disclosure."
"Collected from Nasdaq's website... Adobe raised its fiscal 2021 outlook and projects revenues of $15.45 billion, up from its previous guidance of $15.15 billion. It raised its adjusted EPS forecast to $11.85, up from its earlier projection of $11.20. Overall, the Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on the stock based on 9 Buys and 1 Hold. The average analyst price target of $562 implies upside potential of over 22% to current levels."
"If a non profit like Netflix is 250, ADBE is worht every bit of $270"
Some perspective Year to date 2 years and 3 years ADBE stock has performed slightly below amazon in price appreciation...HMMMMMMMMMMMMMStay long
"Nice movement today, especially considering trends in this sector. Been working in Graphics for over 30 years. Mostly as a Production Artist in Life Science Labeling. In the last decade I’ve transitioned￼ to Project Managing in the same space. Can’t wait to see what Adobe does with WorkFront. ￼HUGE upside when you consider what they can do for workflow management, proofing, approvals, metric reporting, their cloud, etc. — especially in the highly regulated Labeling and Ad/Promo environments. I’ve used many systems, WF is currently one, at this point you have to use more than one because WF can’t be validated￼, proofing tool sucks... I see them KILLING it! GLTA!￼"
"All you turkeys that quickly came on her screaming sell sell sell....Look already nearly made up any after hours losses. And call still to go tonight. Dont act off emotions with stocks or you'll lose your butt. Maybe up tonight. If not, looking for a pop tomorrow. They literally blew it out of the water."
"This is very suspicious 25% YoY beat on ER, price action is flat, and absolutely no commentary on the strangeness of it all."
CEO on CNBC now!!
Abort mission !
stay away fro this garbage laggard ADBE!
Sold my shares. Going after Fedex on Monday
"Since last June, S&P is up 25pct and the Nas is up 50 pct. adbe is up two dollars. They killin it."
Up $20 tomorrow! Excellent forward looking guidance for 2019!
$2.05/share estimate was 1.91
200 till xmas!
"Pig==ADBE, you can never make any dime on it even if its fundamentals are solid. WS does not like it!"
That's crazy Andrew...the ER should beat with revenue and especially guidance.
let me short this stock to see how it goes
Buy ADBE for great price! Increasing 15% ADBE! Hopefully low more!
Buy more Adobe!!!!! It’s way too oversold
Looks like the institutions are selling. They like to leave the small retail investors holding the bag...this will be down AH.
Triple top should break out at least 10% over? asking for a friend.
Too much funny business happening with this stock. No surprise at all if it goes back up $10 Monday. Ridiculous and probably illegal.
Projection - Share price will drop to 486 before rising once more
"What is interesting:« Creative-segment revenue was $1.96 billion, up 19%, while Document Cloud revenue was $375 million, up 22%.Adobe said it repurchased about 1.5 million shares in the quarter. »“Adobe delivered the best [third quarter] in our history in a challenging macroeconomic environment, demonstrating the global demand for our innovative solutions,” CEO Shantanu Narayen"
Look at ADBE rock!!! I cannot wait for their earnings report in June!!! GO ADBE GO!!!
"Just an fyi, I’m a full stack web dev -their cloud based offerings and marketing tools, no one comes close.I’m hanging on to this one for a long time."
"I think Abobe is mature enough and should be paying dividends at this point. Its a shame, that its not. Will wait setupped an alert at 150, even their I feel a bit bearish."
ADBE seen beating big time?
"Wow, what are the charts showing ?"
$270.00 by Thursday am.
"ADBE being down only 2% and change after the run up it has had, and considering the market is currently in solid red, as it were, is pretty pretty good ! Gotta Say, Adobe is going higher, much much higher ,,,,,,"
looks like its good news?
"Ultragenyx agrees to buy 2.4 million shares @ 10 dollars a share for ARCT. Collab. With option to buy 600,000 @16.00"
Adobe needs to mobilize it's army of digital artists and create the most fantastical metaverse the world has ever seen!
"Still a bargain, adbe 1000 in a few years buy and hold."
I just bought 100 more shares of ADBE at $ 473.00. ADBE will report exception sales and earnings growth next Tuesday!!! GO ADBE GO!!!
stock seems quite high. I'll make a few phone calls #thebigshort
Sell Short now

"back n forth green n red idx these are great earings ,with raised guidance shes gonna soar"
Buying January $265 calls tomorrow
255+ tomorrow
"ADBE has crushed ER the past two quarters, the stock has moved sideways or down for months. Gets no respect. The ER, for ADBE, is not a catalyst. And this is especially true because GME, also goes tonight, will hog the spotlight. Given the fact that the market hates software right now, makes very concerned for the ER tonight. God forbid if they miss or come in light on the forecast."
I wish to buy this stock throughout the whole year of 2019. Lower prices are welcome!
This dip was huge buying opportunity.Easy 350+ by end of the year
"all you had to do is sell at the open today. RIP Adobe, apple and peloton. each of them all peaked at the open."
anyone saying they know what ADBE is gonna do after posting earnings is full of it. straddle options were suggesting about a 4% move. methinks i am on the right side of this trade ~ but i haven't a clue. good luck to the ADBE lomgs.
Missed

Just got an upgrade by UBS with a PT of $217.
ADBE always bounced back before close.
Down -21% nice dip it will come back
"I doubt the stock moves higher be for the Fed rate announcement at 2pm. If they don't cut a quarter point, then the whole market will plummet."
$ADBE Most of selling was after hours. Going back up in pre-market without much volume. Good sign this is going back up.
"Buy, Buy, Buy"
"I can tell you as a cloud user who also has a college student user. Nothing even comes close, Adobe Cloud is the wildcard that unless you use it you will underestimate just how much it's taken off."
did they miss???
"SORRY SHORTS, NOT ON MY WATCH AND NOT THIS STOCK, Thanks for the extra cheap shares."

"Even though no direct correlation to Apple, the news from them will probably have a ripple effect on overbought high flyers such as ADBE. RSI at 78, it’s overbought"
ADBE is rallying!!! GO ADBE GO!!!
ADBE is oversold for market crash!!
ADBE acts like an old car: slow but steady!
buy now before it hits $550 tomorrow...
$390 by 2021.
"bought back in today 100 shares, allow the trend to continue now..."
"Based on this earnings report and the upward guidance, I see the price trending towards $500 in the spring and $550 by late summer if the next earnings report is also good."
SHORT THIS #$%$
AP reports that ADBE non-gaaap earning MISSED BY A NICKEL! Now the numbers are $1.83.
ADBE reached a new All Time High at 219.71
"Guidance was terrible, as I said yesterday, look for a $15-20 dollar selloff today"
Might see 440 today if whole market stays in a sell off
"In 2018 Adobe made significant investments across their product portfolio, entered new markets, and made strategic acquisitions which will show up in the company’s performance figures and stock price in the coming years. See: http://alamg.com/report-adobe-systems-inc-adbe-adobe-raised-revenue-and-arr-targets-for-fiscal-year-16.html"
"EARNINGS will continue to beat. I just bought my first ""traunch"", hoping it's my last but prepared to average down should opportunity knock again."
Time to buy stocks is now
I am buying here
"I'm curious if the adoption of crypto NFTs might be utilized by Adobe to create a fine art market in which the artist can receive royalties on the transfer of ownership in perpetuity. If Adobe were to create this market, it would be so lucrative for them. There's an article on Business Insider that got me thinking about it. I can't share it with you because Yahoo will filter it out."
Buying opportunity today. Down after great quarter and strong projections!!!!!!!!!
Less than 1% off 52 week high and people are surprised by a 3% pullback after a great report. We see this time and time again.

Adobe's earnings appear to be solid and predictable. Will they initiate a dividend soon?
OK fine: Stock won't move...ER coming out AH...I'm doubling down.
"Dear investors, do you have any idea why I cannot add to my portfolio ADBE200117P00250000 contract? It doesn't appear on the lookup field although the contract actually exists on other platforms. Thanks!"
Take some profits and buy back ~ 264.
Why down?
"It’s aall about the stock making HIGHER HIGHS SND LOWER LOWS...And that what $AMD ‘s chart displays !Aside from $AMD gaining traction in many areas and paying Down debt at quite a nice pace ... all looks good with $AMD moving FWD, into the MARCH CONF. and it’s upcoming EPS... It reminds me of buying $ADBE around 290$ - SUMMER 2019- , a month prior to its EPS 2019, which were disappoint... watched my CALL options hit 0.20$ , when $ADBE , was around 270$....around THANKSGIVING 2019.... And... with a chart of higher highs n lower lows and momentum building ... just 3 months $ADBE is now at all time highs, after a return to positive EPS and guidance and positive catalysts going FWD...GTLA GOING FWD WITH $AMD"
"If Adobe really gets hit hard tomorrow, I simply buy more, but I doubt it will...."
"if adbe drops below 450 , I will add some"
"Adobe Systems currently had an average rating of “Buy” and an average price target of $114.53, but after today's presentation, I believe that number will be ratcheting up another 10-15%.Today's earnings release was expected to bring us good news and it did, but they beat the estimates across the board. The subscription based cloud business model is going to put this stock into the ranks of Amazon and Google. You'd have to be crazy to be short this one IMO."
There is a content war brewing by giants that will only get bigger the next 5-10 years. ADBE is right in the sweet spot to profit. ADBE one of my largest holdings and buying monthly!
"Its pricd to move $10 tomorrow, I'd be happy it it keeps within that range."
Getting a little top heavy?
ADBE is down 7.28% to 289.10
"Andrew Left is all over Bitcoin now the bubble is on the verge of bursting, soon to be something for the wall street history books."

HAD TO SHORT TODAY @ 495 X 500 SHARES. BIG MISS COMING WILL SEE 425 OR LOWER TODAY. ENJOY THE FALL LIKE I WILL.
"**ALERT**So ADBE actually MISSED earning and then **ADJUSTED** the number up to Handily BEAT estimates ! Why not make it 3.00 per share or 5.00 ?So the headlines say ADOBE CRUSHED earnings !What a joke Red Robin Grill posted a loss then adjusted earnings up to beat estimates !This is CALLED NON-GAAP accounting and is why the stock is only up 5 dollars ah not 20...So it was nice they beat on revenues but the pe ratio of this stock is extremely high so be careful about buying into the hype it may just sit there and pull back tomorrow depending on forward. guidance..he San Jose, California-based company said it had profit of ***75** cents per share. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were $1.02 per share.The results exceeded Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 94 cents per share."
It seems that the market doesn't like the results.
Why is it down after hour? they beat estimated earning.... i bet someone is trying to manipulate the afterhour trading session... up huge tomorrow
"Why has ADBE fallen the last few months? I would think COVID-19 would mean *more* ADBE users would work from home, increasing the use of the software, storage, and licences. At the very least, I would think ADBE would not be adversely affected by people not going to the office, since its a SaaS model and people organisations will still be paying to access the service.Any thoughts on why the company has been dropping this year? Thanks"
Blowout earnings. Futures are showing 275 after earnings. Crm exploded when they beat and this will go parabolic upwards after earnings tonight.
ADBE is up 5.59% to $216.62
"From Louis Navallier -The company still has solid forecasted earnings and sales growth. For the first quarter, the analyst community is looking for 22.5% year-over-year earnings growth and 21.6% year-over-year sales growth. But I’m concerned with the overall drop off institutional buying pressure, as evidenced by its D Quantitative rating and overall D-rating in Portfolio Grader. So, I recommend that we sell ADBE today.If you bought ADBE when we added it to the High-Growth Investments Buy List in May 2018, you’ll sell the stock for about a 100% gain. Sell ADBE."

How many times can you beat expectations and have it be a surprise?
"Dear Shantanu Narayen, We are not here to hear you wax poetic regarding future positioning. Every single person on this board is here because we own ADBE and you have not even given a casual nod to the shareholder. If you have no dividend to give, then the only thing to give is share price increase. If you cant engineer that, people are confused and they wonder why they are here. Well, at least I do."
Adobe reached an all time high at 425.08
"ADBE is toppy for now, gonna move some money to IQ rocket"
I have to believe that this is a bubble... Bearish Gains at best... Wall St. did something similar before the October 1929 event... Institutions pooled funds and focused in on specific companies that had the trust of the public to create an illusion of stability... information is just that... do what you must.
is conference call started ????? Some one please post comment
ADBE is severely undervalued. Could easily be 4-500 within 12 months.
"Adobe posted its annual report, hence the pop. http://www.conferencecalltranscripts.org/Q/summary/?id=4509579"
it's time to move from adobe stock...they enter in a new era with slow growth !

"Adobe is great company, very rewarding for investors, but look at Luckin coffee of China, market cap only 1 billion, Adobe market cap 236 billion, Luckin has over 6000 coffee shops like Starbucks, has 700 million in cash, new management, new auditors , profitable at store level Benzinga and Motely fool like it, do your own due diligence, potential for Hugh profit."

"The only thing that can fix this is people stop buying ADBE options. I have no idea why people think they can make money buying options in stocks like ADBE that are so heavily institutionally owned, the MMs can manipulate the price to wipe calls keep your money and their stock and then do it all over again each step up price ladder."
Garbage garbage garbage. Deleting my photoshop
"Adjusted EPS $1.90, bloodbath for PUT holders. Margin CALLS coming your way shorts!"
"I am feeling very bullish about ADBE for this upcoming Earnings Report. Planning to go long with a big chunk of capital, sometime tomorrow before market close. This is a profitable tech company that is fairly valued. Moreover, it is one of the oldest and most famous internet technology companies. It has a real legacy and a stellar reputation in the industry. On top of that, it has a stellar earnings history: Examine the past THIRTEEN earnings releases. Do you know how many times they beat the consensus on Revenue?? All 13 reports! And what about EPS?? They beat the consensus estimate 12 out of 13. Very few companies of any kind, let alone technology which is one of the most volatile, have this type of earnings record. Interestingly, the stock does NOT seem to do that well right after earnings releases, at least not in the past, even when they beat consensus, as they always seem to do. But...I see this company firing on all cylinders, I think the report will be very good and the stock will pop up in price. Maybe not a 10%+ mover, but downside risk is minimal, IMO. Do your own Due Diligence, but I see this baby looking good! :-)"
Probably 220 next 3 months! Go Adobe!
Joe Terranova claimed he was selling Adobe on CNBC today. That should be a green light to go ahead and buy the stock! This guy can barely complete and intelligible sentence let alone make investment decisions.

ADBE is down -4.91% to 242.30
"Stock is down 3%. Certainly not a correction. A blip in a continuing uptrend in the stock chart. Would I have liked to see it spike 20 points etc..., yes but long term this is a stock to own. I saw and continue to see the same thing with Shopify (in since $41 and bought more on the dips for additional trading opportunities). The stock will recover!"
We're at that darn 255-256 resistance again. Let's see if we can power through it this time!
Sold all my Adobe which I bought @ 154. This is going to get ugly tommarow
"earnings on 6/14, before market open or after close?"
"Adobe has nothing to do with the Vaccine. No matter you WFH or WFO, you still need the software to do the job."
"To be honest when you see these high P/E ratios it is a little daunting, but just look at the same Qr last year, has grown eps by nearly 66% with a growth rate like that the P/E ratio makes Sense. If it goes down or up tomorrow either way we are right around where we need to be. I would be surprised to see a large move down."
"Him, very rare and major drop for ADBE. I’m scared to touch this and I may be wrong but 200 is in play here"
ADBE reached an all time high at 374.00
HOLY COW! EPS is EXPLODING HIGHER! Too bad we are losing to a virus
Any clue why this one is struggling? I loaded up on this hoping for a 15% push

"Big earnings report after hours!!! UP, UP, AND AWAY!!! ADBE will be at $ 510.00 after hours!!! GO ADBE GO!!!"
I sold mine early at 310. May rebuy.
Here comes $ 320!!!
I bought some today...I think ER will be a strong beats.
"As pointed out before earning yesterday -- DEATH CROSSING on the chart 50 DMA undercut 200 DMA now - so stock price will head lower 'self-fulfilling' - no matter the earnings good or bad , no impact. - so make no sense to buy before earning if you so desire to lose money today. LOL"
Isnt ADBE an easy NFT play :-) look at NFT stocks .
So scary . Just bought it.

"HEI and JBL look like interesting possible Earnings plays for Monday, both to the Long side. HEI in particular, is grabbing my attention. A very high quality company with an excellent earnings history of beating on EPS and Revenue, priced well below it's 52 week high. Still overvalued technically, but I see very good upside potential based upon a likely beat on both EPS and Revenue, along with positive Guidance going forward. I will be researching and analyzing these two stocks more, over the weekend, before I am any final decision as to my next play. :-)"
"IMO, $AMD , based upon SU Prob factored in the COVID-19 possible effects in $AMD ‘s fwd “ conservative guidance”Look at $ADBE ‘s positive performance from yesterday’s EPS & $ADBE ‘s performance after its previous recent Qtrly EPS.Yes i feel as though $AMD’s upcoming Qtr May be the start of a consistent upward trend.Still trying to make sense of AMD’s ‘New-ish’ AH movement.It’s as if $AMD will be bringing out/ announcing another major positive catalyst..."
"@joe don’t go into hiding tomorrow.. as I will torture all day until you mute me....good luck bag holder. Already down, the earning call will make it worst"
ADBE will rally through their earnings tomorrow!!! What a great company!!!
250 stock at least.
Will it ever go up
"Also , IMO, L. SU... Everyone has a diff approach to Conference Calls n guidance and now we know she gave conservative guidance. The Tech/ SEMI Setor stokcks like $AMD, $MSFT, $TER, $SWKS, $NXPI ( ESP TER, blow out EPS quarter) .... just a lil correction , buying opp....I recall $ADBE... options THANKSGIVING WEEK 2019... 0.16 ~.020.... after ESP 13 per contract ... in just 3 weeks...."
"they should consider a stock split, it is not moving from 450 onward."
@joe....you were saying?!!!
Can anyone tell me the main driver of ADBE's revenue growth the past 4-5 years? Is it simply just the conversion from boxed product to cloud services? Recent acquisitions have been relatively minor. I remember holding this stock back in the days when they acquired MACR - but it's been off my radar for quite some time. Too bad I didn't forget about it in one of my accounts hah.
"Love this company! Only have 100 shares had to get a put at 250 just feels like it should be a little less at the moment, but maybe others know something I don’t. Either way it’s a good growth company over the next 10 years in my opinion."
To the moon earning will be fire preloading
Shoeshine boys pumping today lmfao telling us a story pricedIn 10x already $crwd $zs $docu $adbe $okta

Not worried at all.
"Just replace the words ""to the moon"" with (at least) ""to the cloud"".Yep, all of these stocks just flying high. Commerce, forced by circumstance (Covid, now riots) has suddenly shifted to the cloud - and guess who led the pack on the applications side? ADBE that's who.Earnings are going to blow even the biggest advocates out the door. Move over MSFThttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cP-baAETnI"
Just bought in. Estimated EPS not great but otherwise looking good.
Best cloud stock to own. Will trade north of $270.00 after earnings.
Its one of the Growth stocks. Good for Long term
"Unbelievable, not pumped stock can drop 20% in 2 weeks"
I hope the earnings miss so you all lose your shirt. thank you for your attention in this matter!
yea agree $600 looks doable in 2020! Money pouring to bottomline now! SAAS business model is like MAGIC!
I lost like 100 dollars toda on ADBE
"just muted Santam or whoever, no one needs to post that many repetitive phrases in a row... We get it, you're bearish. Say it once and quit crying for attention. Anywho, I see this at 487 by end of week on healthy prospects. Just my opinion and holding my position for the long term either way"

ADBE bought Magento at very cheap price. Magento market share is much bigger than Shopify. You have seen how Shopify fly! Stay with ADBE!
Buy the dip!
I don't know guys I think it is up a lot over the last two weeks. People are taking profits because it will go down after earnings. My guess is it is priced in
Breakout above 350Target 400
I pray that the option trader who screwed us up will lose all his money sooner than later
"Buy Buy Buy ADBE! If you search for STOCKTRADEVIDEO in google, then one thing will happen: winners... winners... winners!"
What's going on with this great company's stock?? Can't find anything on the site in IR. Is it just 'recalculating'?
"As a designer and 20 year-long users of its products I am locked in and can't get out. Want to buy in but near term, it looks overvalued. Going to wait and buy the next dip."
Typical ADBE bruh rise 1 day fall 6 days
Yeah boiiiii...!!!!
Will break 270 today
"Here we go again. Wall Street started to recover and now everyone's afraid of civil unrest again. It's not going to happen. We'll be fine, and ADBE will come right back soon. Load up."
"I'll be too busy to keep track next week so I'll just take a position first thing Monday morning and wait it out. There's absolutely no way ADBE sinks much lower than this, and if it does, it most certainly won't be too long before it shoots back up above these prices."
"Great company with great financials. However, future PE compare to its next 5 yrs estimated EPS growth is still too high, I will have to wait until it drops below $400 before buying this."
"I'll be adding to my position today. The fact that this has held strong today is a VERY positive sign. It'll climb higher next week, and I'll be there to enjoy the ride. At a discount."
"Trifecta; Earning Beat, Revenue Beat and Guidance Above Concensus. hehe"

I'm considering buying for earnings as their earnings history of beating estimates is great. At this point is this too high? i.e. have I missed my chance going into earnings? Appreciate responses in advance."

Some of u shorts are cranky
Holding this over the weekend = financial suicide
600 by morning. Shorts squeezes
Just get back to $239 so I can sell and get out
Adobe reached an all time high at 443.42
Whats the 8% gain today? Never seen this kind of jump in price in one day from Adobe
Anyone buying and holding over the weekend will quickly regret it come Monday
The stock just passed through the price gap which occurred on August 26... let's see if it can hold that position.
http://alph.st/b21987b1 Continuously beating the consensus estimates. Will be a hot stock tomorrow.
"I've double-insured as many of my positions as I could today. I bought PUTs on everything, just in case Trump and Kim (and Trump's boss, Putin) end the world tomorrow. I'm buying the priciest insurance, near or at-the-money PUTs expiring this Friday. Buying PUTs on $FB, $AAPL, $ADBE, $NVDA, $BOOM, $IBKR, $MU, $GOOS, $NTNX, $AAOI, $TGTMost likely, Putin will not expose his puppet tomorrow. Why do that, when he can be used to sow so much more discord in the Western World, while Putin strengthens Russia and its allies' positions? But blowing the Manchurian candidate's cover tomorrow would be like dropping a nuke on Democracy and would throw everything into disarray, because he would expose not only Trump but hundreds of our politicians as traitors. It could take years or decades to recover, if we ever do. This is much worse than Watergate.Anyway, I think that ""nothing"" will happen tomorrow. Trump will probably achieve ""success"" at the summit, which will help get more Republicans into office in a few months, giving him yet more power to destroy the institutions of Western Democracy. Putin and maybe China too are probably encouraging Kim and Trump (their puppets).So, all these PUTs will probably expire worthless. But I see tomorrow as a day of great danger for a black swan event, and so I think it's worth it just this once."
ADBE is up 7.66% to 316.10
"call done, me happy, so should all longs"
"I love how they are running this up after hours, just going to fall harder once I place my puts and short heavy. Todays volume was 4 x that of it's 10 day average. So unless there is continued buying which I highly doubt this is going to FALL HARD. Be cautious about chasing this."
was lucky to be out back at 378... never expected to be able to buy again at 280.. buy order in..

why this stock does not move past 6 month!!! its getting range of 440$-500$!!!

Great buying opportunity!
Why is it taking so long?
I bought 200 shares of ADBE at 25 and sold it at 27. I bought 100 shares of AMZN at 99 and sold it at 90.I bought 50 shares of FB at 37 and sold at 32.I am a complete idiot.Could have been very happy right now but I like selling winners and holding losers.
they should merge with crm
Guys dont worry earnings is good. The reason it has dropped is because everyone is getting on the Airbnb ipo and then there is stimulus hopes. once the hype dies down investors will buy back in to Adobe and shoot it up. We have tomorrow so be patient
Out at 257.23. Now it will jump more. I will take a 5 buck a share any day!!!!!!!!!!!

"This should pop tommorow as people finally realise that they shorted a company that shouldn't have been shorted (great earnings etc.) Let's hope we get a decent short squeeze tmrw.That 6m option shortseller should watch his back, he's lost us all a lot of money by being selfish"
What a garbage!
"Digital Experience segment revenue was $784 million, representing 34 percent year-over-year growth. This Digital Experience Segment should be worth 200 Billion in 2022! Digital Experience Revenues only account for 28% of Adobe's Revenues, going to be Monster going forward"
Garbage!Stay away from IBD mentions stocks; those IBD writers are simply not sharp on markets..
Adobe had a healthy pull back from its ATH and is now ready to get back to the consistent growth it’s experienced for the past decade. Very excited for next earnings report
CRASH!!!
$50 stock
"As soon as investors digested the disappointed FED news of today about not cutting interest rates, the Market 'll start sell off in after hours today and tomorrow heavily selling as well..."
We are in red while nasdaq is up 100 points! Ridiculous
Nice discounted price going into next weeks acquisition!
if u don't sell at 460 when u going to sell??? 200??? LOL
adbe now diving AH after today's slaughter. OMG!
"Basically ADBE reported no surprise ER, so muted!"
Huge...!!!! Earnings expected on cloud stocks....ADBE is the best of them all. Stock price today is spectacular!!!!
someone can explain adbe consolidation?
Non-gaap earnings WERE A PENNY SHORT OF ESTIMATES! Estimate was $1.88 and they limped in at $1.87.
Adobe is a big bubble
Just like I said 260+ today
325 tomorrow morning
how many times did I tell you? 275 in 15mins?
Finally some movement.....
Impressive quarter! wow.
ADBE beats on EPS and Revenue consensus estimates. :-)
You don't cover today you have to cover tomorrow at much higher price!
Adobe is the mother of all SAAS company. USD 520 here we come
HERE WE go CRASH!!!
It honestly makes no sense....this stock is this low because nobody wants to buy it. Even though the company shows massively better financials than many of the top 30 movers today.
259 is next support...
Here we go... the lying shorts. I'se talking to you little lying steve-o.
"record profit and it tanks. Mean while TLSA goes up 30% just because Musk gets to stay. It was obvious that Musk wasnt gonna get kicked, but the #$%$ market goes crazy. Maybe ADBE could also pretend to kick out our CEO and then reaffirm that he gets to stay. Will the market get baited into pumping up ADBE?"
HERE we go CRASH!!
"We are gong to see 300s very soon, Thanks to the Adobe top management"
ADBE is ready for a big bounce!!! GO ADBE GO!!!
"This is a great company. If the stock drops tomorrow, buy buy buy!"
Are you guys still in (ADBE? They just got featured on the watchlist at (https:// www.tradenow.xyz)
"Idk whats going on. I dont care that much, Ive had the same 70 shares of adobe for 6 months. I was curious though what they say about workfront deal how they see that panning out."
A general rule good earnings and bad price action is a sell. I am out with my profits for now. I will re enter at a later date.
Nice comeback today
Setting up to go down no matter what the results are. Went up to fast.
over $500 lets see if it will hold steady for tomorrow

Don't let shorts sell few shares to scare pre market ..Earnings beat guidance good
I started listening ULTIMATESTOKCALERT and their alerts are better than anyone else .
Why is this down ugh!?
I’m simply shorts all earnings. This one is no exception 230 tomrrrow
"Im still a fan here at 398. I believe that the genie is out of the bottle when it comes to working from the cloud - no matter where you are. Big companies and small companies alike are finding value in Adobe's Creative Suite, a toolbox full of tools at a reasonable monthly cost enabliing literally tens of millions of people around the world to make a living, safely from whereever they are. The breakout is coming. We will likely test 400 a few times and then BOOM! To the moon Alice!"
Everything will be just fine.
can someone post link to earnings report?
Bought at 232.50
Back to $ 530 before earnings
Don’t sell winners. This stock is winner!
"What do people see this as an opening price for tommorow, bearing in mind great Q3 results, and an incredibly positive Q4 outlook"
How long it take trash dobe to breakout?
Stock is down $2 after hours which is consistent with the WEAK guidance and messy earnings announced last week.
For the love of god STOP INJECTING THE COMPANY INTO POLITICS! It's bad for business.
Looking @ level 2 bit ask only 400 shares to buy @ $45.00 and tons for sale. Shorts be ready tomorrow...we will see a big drop tomorrow. No demand at this price
Big boys trying to take your shares before earnings.
This is the go to stock for all graphic designers
I JUST SHORTED 10K MORE SHARES
Holding . I think 325 after 2-3 quarters
Anyone else see that glitch. My heart stopped for a second lmao
ADBE getting ready to break their 52 week high!!! Here comes $ 260 per share!!!

300 at open
have earnings come out?
those are damn fine earnings & guidance.
earnings and rev beat
BUYING here at 312 in spite of the doom and gloom end of the world imbeciles (aka: shorts) rantings on this board.
"We need need high volume to break through so tell all your friends to come buy some fresh, never frozen, organic, cage-free, non-gmo ADBE"
"Next quarter to non-gaaap earnings to drop to $1.60, as per ADBE."
"This makes three quarters in a row of blowout reports and guidance, and the price goes sideways or down. I don't know which stock gets less respect, CRM or ADBE."
Great company with lots of growth left. Don’t hesitate to buy on the dip!
wow this stock...
Adobe flash out of date???!! what is wrong the Adobe as they want you to update daily. Bunch of jerks.
"How many times does Goldmunsux have to be wrong?. They keep low balling the estimates only to be proven wrong - time and again.Its time for them to realize that Adobe is one of the few company's out there who has the smarts to harness the cloud and convert to a license based economy while at the same time growing their customer base. According to company projections, full market saturation is still YEARS away! HELLO!???? GS, come in please!! Earth to Goldmun!!"
"I shorted friday at 175.40. I am prepared to average up at 225. But, after such a quick runup to 175 I am pretty sure we will see a pull back before the end of the year. This is a great stock but it is way over priced for now. I also went short on NFLX, BGNE, and NVDA pennies from their last all time highs I covered on BGNE Thursday for a 17K profit 22%, I left money on the table.for BGNE. NFLX I believe has begun a long decline. NVDA and ADOBE just a significant pull back is in order."
All in
ADBE literally one of the healthiest companies financially within the NASDAQ
"ADBE does this a lot. Especially after earnings. I've owned this since 2015 and I'm not shocked anymore. My guess is it gets run up to take profits/shorted. I do know this stock has a history of climbing, then crashing. Look up it's history. My experience has also been that once it finds its middle ground, it will climb back up slowly. Be grateful it's over $400."
Adobe holding up extremely well during these two volatile months shows lots of interest among institutional managers. I guess no sale for this stock.
This better be the bottom or we're in a world of hurt 
I believe there’s no need for year tax loss sale here as the selling been on since September. This should be back to 250 in a week
"jay, Adobe is great company...you said it...go puebloans!!"
Insanity markets here. Downside out weighs up side big time. So over priced period.
ADBE reached an all time high at 337.89
ADBE had a great day today!
Do you guys think it’ll break 230?
Drop for good earnings?Satan
goin drop at least 5 percent tomorrow
Hold on for ADBE. Don't panic.
Out $179 and change. Moving to RHT - Redhat for trade into earnings on Tuesday
"we will see 286 around tomorrow , people are going to take profits!!!"
Wesbush upgrade from 410-510 .. let's take it to 550
"I predict good earnings beat, but share price will go down instead"
BOOM!!!!
Guys i would scalp calls for this if it dips in the open
let's put it this way: every chart timeframe you can look at on Yahoo finance is green except the one day chart. lol at your $250 target price.
Typical sell the news. I started a new position at $248.91 and already up!
"The EPS and revenue have increased from the last 2 quarters, and the stock price is currently lower than June 2018. I would say since this stock has proven itself over the last 2 quarters by the earnings that just came out, it is a BUY."
is there any takeover (expensive as always) planned?
Go Adobe! Go EAGLES!
ADBE is heading towards $ 320.00!!!
"Tomorrow - WE FLY!Yes, UBS has already upgraded the stock with a target of 450.00 per shareYes, Oppenheimer has already upgraded the stock and set a target of 430.00 per shareYes, OTHERS WILL FOLLOW SUIT over the next two daysYES, ADBE's conference call and guidance indicate that this company has emerged as a defacto standard in conducting ecommerce as well as creative content remotely, securely and in collaboration.MOVE OVER MICROSOFT, MOVE OVER GOOGLE, MOVE OVER APPLEADBE has been here longer than any of you and it will continue to gain its rightful market share!"
Beat but miss the wishper number going to $245 next week
it cheap I'm bullish 900 dollar
Mute that loser Steve
TRUMP ENRICHES MORE LIBERALS WHO OWN THIS STOCK. ADBE up almost 3% after hours on news ADBE is forecasting higher earnings due to TRUMP'S TAX CUT. And so it goes on and on and on and on>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Adobe is a safe heaven
Cramer is so full of s... He told viewers Adobe was going to have a blow out quarter. This guy should be in prison with Trump.
ADBE has value at all!
Already fading no muppets left to buy tech herei
It will take us many years to recover from the damage the Obama admin did.
I heard some chartist yesterday on CNBC said AMD could reach $85 in 18 months from now according to the chart.
$ADBE Reiterated by Guggenheim Securities Hold
"Guys relax,The only reason this dropped 0.4% was because of a 5% sell-off in tesla and 1.5% sell off in apple"
All these bulls will be crying to their mommies when they realize that growth is not infinite. Name one time in the history of the world where economic growth was infinite
Why on earth is this dropping over 4%
"Same share price as in August, just like most FAANG stocks. $30-40 up day coming soon. Way over sold."
Checking EBITDA history and thinking about adding more.
Oh yeah ? What happened now
"I am up by $250 Million since March 2020 thanks to the US Government and the Stock PUMPING Festival in the US that has started in March 2020! NOBODY Needs to work anymore!

ADBE is down to $ 286.73!!!
$480 after earnings tomorrow
"With the introduction of Adobe Fresco and now Photoshop Camera Apps, Adobe is starting to look a lot like a Trillion Dollar Market Cap Stock!!! Could easily see a billion downloads of these apps in 36 months, and the potential to mint money will be endless!"
Easily 200 by xmas
"At the last moment i bought 100 contracts, weekly $130 calls. I paid $2900 (28cents). It will be interesting if I can make money or will expired worthless. Fun day tomorrow. For the best I hope to see ADBE in $135 range."
Wondering if I should unload my shares before earnings or hold. What y’all think after reading the latest article on yahoo regarding $100 billion company...
up up up
ADBE is rocking!!! Here comes $ 525.00!!! GO ADBE GO!!!
ccs reboot tomorrow may 1st......
Spammers are so annoying 
hedge fund had a large ptt position...guess i will have to follow
Forward PE of 30? Is this some kind of joke or is this being manipulated?
$148 tomorrow.
"Hovering at 178 now, thoughts on tomorrow after opening bell? Up then down? Up? Down? Use the thumbs or reply thanks. Should go up in my opinion"
Adobe keep going higher but Many of it's customer are struggling and forced to cut cost. Question is how much of their services are essential and not targeted for cost cut.Sure their eCommerce is biggest beneficier but They already seen very high growth and going forward it just make much harder to compare.
They beat on everythingGood guidance
I plan to buy more ADBE at $ 260.00.
It’s tomorrow morning at 8am December 10
"With more quarterly earnings like this going forward, those institutional investors will be running back to ADBE."
"Not bad today, nasdaq dropped 140 points, yet adbe dropped only $1."
"New lows like I said , Merry Christmas and happy holidays, I hope my posts helped you out!"
Down 8% in 2 days. More bearish than overall market!
"This company is going nowhere as long as it keeps promoting countless relatives and friends from India on management positions. Start cutting useless headcount. Go to eCommerce Engineering org and start cutting randomly - it will not affect the performance. All those Gaurav Jains, Deepaks, etc , etc. Do it now or shareholders will force you to do. I am Neutral/Bearish on this stock. ADBE has lost its steam and permanently stagnates."
"For Navjot and others talking about wanting dividends. I have owned ADBE for ever. I don't have any brokerage accounts opened on screen right now, so I can't give exact date, but ADBE USED TO GIVE DIVIDENDS. I think it was 2016 or 2017 when they cut dividends, and put the money back into company and NOW they are worth far more, the share price is WAY up, and the company is not a stock I feel I need to watch. I consider it one of my core stocks. If I get a chance, I will look up dividend rate and when they stopped. That info should be readily available."
ADBE is up 4.93% to $250.19
Like ADBE and buying AMRN for a buyout
ADBE officially in BEAR territory: Sell the pops!
"Already did. Didn't catch the bottom, tho."
Stay away from this laggard ADBE==garbage!ADBE problem is lacking innovation in sofware; It's been using ADBE softwares for two decades///
Adobe is still under is 50DMA and 200 DMA.. not good in a bear market rally.
last earning was a beat but drop 5%....
"Joe Terranova mention today on CNBC, WRT sale of Adobe.This guy is a dumb as a sack of nails."
For god sakes the stock is fine
"Target $380!ADBE traded on rev 25% growth, now that it actually grew by only 14%, you should sell the heck all the way down to $400!"
Adobe is down 5.08% to 447.19
This needs a healthy pullback to test the support looks like a bloody day lets see where she goes .
Adobe is up 9.78% to 312.88
Looks like Costco in here. Good performance equals a massive train wreck.
"Over the past 10 days, analysts across the board have raised their price targets on this stock to an over all average in the high 420's with some extrapolating out into the 470s. I personally feel as though these numbers are low. Kind of like those who called for TSLA to go to 500 when it was trading in the 400's. Its over 1000 now and still climbing. Is it any wonder ADBE us up 10.00 this morning after the Fed announcement? ADBE doesn't just cater to individual artists, it is overwhelmingly the defacto standard with the entire S&P 500 crowd too. 420 by Friday"
I see that people are buying this thing up a week ahead but I don’t believe it. Damn what a mistake.
Any chance this thing recovers to 225+?
"Adobe software is universally used by all creatives. They have, in all practical terms, a monopoly on design software. Apple secured a new subscriber base for Adobe by dropping support for 32-bit applications, ensuring that anyone still using old Adobe software will have to convert to a subscription service. Adobe is locked in for profit, and they keep innovating."
"Huge Debt, earning going bad, billion shares in market. ADBE is a bubble"
This stock is too undervalued!!! $550 is fair!
ADBE=== trash of garbage!
No one ever got hurt buying ADBE!
riding this short into earnings might beat but im banking on lower guidance. stocks are selling off with solid earnings. -220 ONE TME
"Please plow more of your $ into adobe, thank u need it up over $425"
Look at ADBE rock!!!
This is a great company buying the dip and holding. Software Tech will move to the forefront when 5g takes hold. Faster moving data speeds are nothing without SOFTWARE
"Almost all tech stocks have reached absurd valuations and no matter how well they do in their business, they are ripe for a 10-20% drop. Adobe maybe the first case in point."
"please forgive me for shorting in to the fabulous earnings but it's already a winner. I shorted today at 16:08 NY time and got off 500 shares between 182 and 183. The question is do I cover here at 177, or are we heading lower in the am?"
Get ready for a big bounce!!! ADBE is rallying!!! GO ADBE GO!!!
Adobe Q3 EPS of $0.75 beat by $0.02. Revenues of $1.46B were up 19.7% beating by $10M $ADBE
ADBE reached a new All Time High at 254.42
ADBE is down 4.95% to 254.44
ADBE is up 9.78% to 312.88
"Seems like a pretty safe place to put money if you ask me, which nobody is so I guess I'll just sit here and continue minding my own business."
uS market full manipulation
Great now the kiss of death from scammer Cramer....all aboard next stop $220
US stock market is INSANELY OVERVALUED and OVERBOUGHT! Most OVERVALUED and OVERBOUGHT BUBBLES are: $AMD $NVDA $SQ $SHOP $AMZN $NFLX $TWTR $FB $SNAP $AAPL $NKE $CRM $ADBE $BABA $PYPL
Market is green and earnings in a week. Keep adding this will hit 200 soon
"Playing games with ADJ. EPS, this use to be called accounting Fraud."
Wow thrash stock
"Take profits before Robinhood attack at 9, do it or cry after 9"
"These earnings are worth $1.49 according to after market, hahaha"
"Sell longs and take short position, adbe is a bubble"
"I am thinking split... would open this great company to the ""everyday"" person to take part in the growth that will come."
"every loser tech company is going into the cloud now. AMD, BABA, IBM.etc. going to have too many players. plus there is Apple, Amazon, and Google too."
And no dividend
Adobe will hit $510 next week!!!
back to $256
Whopping $1 up AH for beating expectations. Imagine what would have happened if it missed.
"Shorts no need to worry tomorrow, if you look at the last two earnings, history will repeat itself. GLTA!!"
Adding to my position
"Oracle tanked big time so shall ADBE, sell short"
Can’t hold. Take profits
This slight pull back % wise is needed to continue the solid uptrend. No need to panic longs!
September 13 is earnings are we down on a leak of poor earnings?
down on high volume ??????
Is 320.00 per share do-able by tomorrows close? Most assuredly! Just look where we came from - not even CLOSE to a 50% standard retracement until around 320 (and I expect this level to be pierced rather handily as ADBE is one of the FEW STOCKS that will actually benefit LONG TERM due to the lessons learned during this pandemic. CLOUD BASED COLLABORATIVE ENTERPRISE is what this company is ALL ABOUT!
It's difficult to make a case this is worth $300. $468 is gross overvaluation.
GO ADBE GO!!!
The big banks are giving this an average PT of ~$200. Follow the big money $$$
"Yeah, no crash here! Adobe is a fortress."
Buy zogenix It will rocket to moon next month
FLUSH FLUSH FLUSH!!How many more knuckleheads will they be able to roust from their nests? haha
I am loving the after hour action- yeh ha
Adbe sees %20 yoy growth Reaffirms
Doesn’t bode well I guess. What do you guys think?
"Earning date shows 3/23 now. Little concerned with Oracle miss. Of course, ORCL was at a 52 week high and we are not even close. Hopefully, ADBE pulls a Microsoft like beat."
NDACU Nightdragon this is a new cyber security spac whose Partners include Adobe. Just went on the market today for 10 bucks.
"I see Zacks has ranked ADBE a 3???? wow....if this company is merely a hold and not a buy, i really dont know what they are looking for? I think its a great buy on ANY weakness."
Tanking (
Yahoo deleted my post but allow stupid spammer posts 
"time to buy, buy, buy!"
The earnings conference invite login will not go active. Hoping to attend at 5pm EST.
Do you think it will drop down 5% tomorrow or more?
we'll see a quick correction on this one. buy low while you still can
ADBE is down 5.08% to 354.01
"Adobe needs to add a meatless Photoshop version, would go to 10,000!"
why is this going down? im listening to the live conference call and its very bullish with further unrealised gains from subscriptions and new enterprise products down the line for further organic growth
"Earnings report looks good, very good, but NOT a blowout on any of the metrics. Good thing this baby was not over-valued going in. I am sticking with her, I think she has very good upside potential still for tomorrow, to $320+"
Time to short this again!
This will crash after earnings just like every other tech stocks.

Adobe reached an all time high at 395.24
"Things have settled down. Expect another spasm in the afternoon, but I think it closes around $177.50. Would like to see it take out $180.00, but the current action says no."
End of day tomorrow after earning it will go $350 easily.
"Glad to see the positive guidance. I expected excellent earnings, and they beat expectations by over 25%. Good news all around. My overall takeaway is that Adobe seems more interested in expansion than innovation right now. I guess that makes sense. There's probably more more profit potential in applying what they already do to untapped markets. As a user, I'm always interested what's next, but I can see this being good for the stock. Good job, Adobe."
Going back to $50
Bubbye Eddie.
ADBE to $ 327 by today's close!!!
"i m long since 96 but the 49 peg ratio concerns me, anyone care to comment on why i should hold this stock with little growth relative to PE and stock price?"
"Cramer said buy adobe, EVERYONE SELL"
"Last week, this stock saw a 50 point UP day only to watch it get wiped out over the next 3 days. Once again, as the market appears to be turning (and tomorrows option expiration looming) there is no reason to believe we won't see a repeat of that kind of (short squeeze-coronavirus-play) massive jerk to the upside. Hold onto your shares people! The Adobe Creative Cloud Suite of Tools is the GLOBAL GO TO for work at home graphic artists, editors, marketing and metrics; all things internet. Do NOT let this opportunity pass you by!"
Only %11 growth in revenue yet has 65PE ratio price is not justifiable and risky. Also there are so many new free apps to disturb Adobe’s business model. I would only think buying Adobe at 26-27 PE
"For all those asking about the sell off after a strong quarter...Adobe as a company is in great shape and the numbers they put up are fantastic. The problem lies with the valuation. ADBE trades at 16.5 revenue. That is pretty darn high. You could say that they are “priced for perfection”. However, I have found that it’s often better to pay a hefty premium to own stock of a great company, rather than looking for cheap shares of a trash company (think BBBY, GME, HRB, etc.)ADBE will be fine"
"I've had several stocks that beat on all, like this...and went negative, and then positive during earnings call. Which hasn't happened yet. They beat all figures, this thing may take off upwards still tonight"
Market analysts are reporting the smartest Wall Street people/fund managers are buying ADOBE - big time!!! Check it out... You'll hear much more about this in the coming week...
Here comes $ 360.00!!! GO ADBE GO!!!
Do we have technicians here? When is the best time to buy? Tx
Is AH $3.95 real or fake news ?
Purchased 1500 shares @ 140.95 just before close! Oh yeah baby 
Only in this market stocks go down on good ER smfh
Undervalued BUY MORE!!!
When are earnings? Any intelligent intelligent responses to what the Market's reaction will be to its earnings? Thanks in advance
Its gonna bounce of the 50 day
Are we ever going to get $180? Lol
Hi baggies
Yessssss baby beat beat beat:)')
why is this losing $$$$$$ ????? down 10 % this week??????????? WHY
"No innovation, no growth. No dividends. No interest from investors. I am OK to have this stock as a part of my ETF portfolio, but to have the stock in my portfolio - no way. I was lucky to unload half of my ADBE portfolio when it was at it's 500s. Hedge funds are dumping tech anyway, prepare for long stagnation of the stock."
lets go boy...
Lunch time power hour
Coming back nice
"This stock is freaking out at the $260 mark, which it was at the beginning of trading day. Soon enough, ADBE. Soon enough."
Snap up 12.50% yesterday and still up 0.80% today......up 100% in just 3 mths......but the bargain stock and go for big rebound.....avoid Microsoft and PayPal overpriced
Check out Cramer's conversation tonight with Adobe's Pres/CEO. You can expect a major rebound tomorrow. It was very informative.
"you will all regret this tommorow when it corrects upwards.There's absolutely no reason for this decline, it's just investors getting scared"
255 puts win
"I have no clue as to what this investor meeting is going to be about, but I SUSPECT that ADBE is going to announce an ENHANCED ""WORK FROM HOME"" platform. Just my intuition here folks so please do your own due diligence!"
this always sells off no matter how big a beet then it runs up
Holy S....Adobe doubled this yr....ffs i need to look around the investing landscape
Adbe will pop on monday and aft earnings to 550$!!!
"While hundreds of native American workers were laid off by Adobe, Adobe was busy hiring hundreds of cheap foreign indian workers . Adobe is one of the biggest culprits in the destruction of white collar jobs in USA. Hardly surprising given the CEO is a fellow Indian. This is the most egregious H-1B visa application that I have found so far. This application has been certified for FIFTY ""INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SPECIALISTs"" working for Adobe Systems in Lehi Utah for a wage of $23,462 per year, less than $12/hour"
Let us go boys today.
"Did you you buy more shrs 6/27, like I told you to? I borrowed $5000 from credit card, sold Mac comp. Bought more shrs. Loan cost me 11% APR... ADBE makes me 70% ROI. Do the math. I hope you are telling ALL the people you know about the safest and smartest investment poss. in ADBE. We will be at $675 in 2 yrs. Bank on it, and you are welcome... again."
I missed the train. What is the news that makes ADBE dropped over 3 points this morning. Whoever knows please tell me. I try to get what is going on but I can't find any substance.
"I warned you guy for this crash, covered my 523 AH short at 481"
"futures bottom limit ""halted futures"" $SAVE $UAL $BA $HUD $CDLR $ADBE $EEM $ULTA $OSTK"
"Close to breaking the previous low, once that happens let the panic selling ensue, down to 150 real quick."
Looks like option traders are will be manipulating the price to cash in on idiots who buy options.

Finally people start to realize $AMZN $MSFT $ADBE are undervalued
gonna tank today lol
"Very nice price action for ADBE throughout this AH session, IMO. Sure, it would be nice to see a big pop to $320+, but we have consistently good bids, the price has easily stayed Green the entire time... I think this bodes very well for tomorrow, more so than if we had big spikes and dips as sometimes happens in the AH session. A spike to $320+, followed by a dip to $300, would have me more nervous about tomorrow, even if the stock came back up. She be looking good this whole session! And, in case you missed it, five star Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss raised his price target on this Baby from $340 to $410, just 3 days ago, on December 9th. :-)"
Stock price currently says it all.....BLOWOUT EARNINGS.
"A 13% raise above previous target for both Q1/18, and Year 2018. The impact on the stock price is significant. Analysts covering the stock will most likely revise price target. The stock, in my opinion should rise about the same percentage in the coming weeks. Great News. Best to all"
"ADBE has been consolidating for a while now. It's due for a great break out and run up. Solid financials, growth, and management. Fantastic long term play."
rosie oddonnell said sell.....
"What a wild ride in after hours. Bought 1000 at 276.03, saw it go down 3 1/2 points before rebounding to 278.28 where I humbly put in my limit order for 278.15. Actually had a chance to but back in at 175 but got too greedy with my limit price. but not years from me."
pure manipulation 470 -> 450 ???

Not if the market is up
"I tried to buy the $425 put to no avail, you longs simply Panicked and plunged the Stock from 427"
"Up to 185 shares, started buying at 105. I see this at 400-500 in the next couple years."
it's all manipulated.... whole day neither call not puts could earn.... 300 Spartans kind of strength by MM to make all losers ...
"With Microsoft $MSFT, Adobe $ADBE, SAP $SAP, Apple $APPL......As Our Partners We Are Going To Be Ubiquitous! We Are Going To EXPLODE ON To Every Screen In The World! We Have The Next Thing In Social Communications and Social Selling! Pretty Soon Everyone Will Be TAGGing All Their Videos. Can't Wait For The iOS and Android Apps! Any Day Now!"
"no one knows why the stock has dropped. Without any dividends, it's hard to hold. They are becoming the Apple of the stock world. They get lower and it takes 18 months to crawl back up."
Looks like earnings might be bad or forward guidance will be bad stock keep dropping even thought we have 3 upgrades in last 2 days?
"Man, will we ever see one green day?"
I warned u to get out vaccines and therapeutics r here
When's the 5 -1 stock split happening?
ADBE ready to break out over 350 and run with other momentum plays that are hitting new year highs
What a great company this is...
IF TRUMP WOULD SHUT UP ADBE WOULD BE AT 350 TODAY!!!!!
"This thing is so overvalued , 15 x sells , wow ."
Bought 10k position today
Time to buy
Non-gaaap earnings were a PENNY SHORT!
This is a great company!! This will be green by close..
Adobe was a huge industry leader and stock performer BEFORE Covid. Many thanks to those who foolishly sold. I happily bought.
Your welcomeLol
Most recent data reveal Fund Managers have increased their ownership in Adobe stock by 6%. That's a nice jump up!
Earnings within 6 day what should we do? So don’t waste time to buy within time. Dear friends are you agree or not??
"Great company, but way too expensive and overbought at these levels. Cloud computing stocks have the possibility of becoming a crowded trade."
we will touch 350 today!!!
"Wow, came back after 2 years, still below 300."
"Clearly, I don't own enough ADBE......haha!"
"Beaten earnings, AH +0.39%"
Dropping back to 240 after fed minutes in the afternoon all indexes will close down tmrw
"Salesforce, workday, Amazon, alibaba makes more sense here than this junk"
lol this isn’t going to end well
I’m so sick of all these stocks. AMZN NFLX NVDA ADBE etc. Just sit and spin. Pathetic.
Good week ahead.
ADBE is going down guys... make sure you put your stop loss in. I bet it will be down 10 points on opening bell
ADBE==NFLX==garbage!
Why did the stock raise all of sudden? ER is December 1st.
Whats up with all the trolls on here ?
Moderna vaccine resultsComing careful paying up for overvalued tech and charts at highs like on $adbe $crwd $okta $shop
Come on atleast $185
Love it..... but no volume :(
this is what happen when instead of investing in new technologies and ideas you invest in huuuge buy backs.Adbe brought nothing new on the market except photoshop ! on the looong run it will head to lower 200
Cramer will make you rich !!!
"Glad I grabbed those calls on the pull back,thanks dummies who are chasing this up. You are making BIG JOE RICH! Even richer once I grab those 300 puts"
ADBE==garbage software stock just like ORCL!
260 is coming !rolling all the way down
NVDA Crm aap AMZN. All down more than 20%. You fools don’t learn
PT Raised to $142 from $122 at Pacific Crest
any thoughts on close today. I'd say $182-183. if great guidance perhaps $195+ tomorrow
"Good stuff - Adobe said it expects 2018 GAAP earnings of about $4.72 a share, and adjusted 2018 earnings of $6.20 a share, compared with a previous guidance of about $4.40 a share and about $5.50 a share."
"How sweet is this stock! Sold off my profits a couple of weeks ago but kept the shares I bought first. A great CEO, who's also heads the Board. So nice and under the radar."
wow how high can this one go
"UT OH! Volume finally increased toward the daily average, but - it was to the sell side... Caution (for sure)…"
they say theyr doing buyback but ceo and executive selling bunch of shares how ironic..
"Well, i was close, I estimated open at $250."
ADBE 'll back to below $284.00 tomorrow ...
"I thought when this stock was punching hard against 500, it was gonna pop and fly to 530-550 neighborhood. Then, it reported earnings, which blew away expectation on the beat/raise, then it's been falling apart ever since. I am holding 40 shares, and will wait it out. But I have no idea why this stock lost its juice."
i have a sell at 320
@jason lol!!!! From going to explode to buy the dip.Longs this morning. Lol
ADBE: possible 300$ after ER
why are we crashing? I thought we had good earnings

Adobe Inc is still one of the 5 ALL-TIME HIGH MEGA CAPS STOCKS THAT ARE STILL STRONG BUYhttp://walledstreet.com/5-all-time-high-mega-caps-stocks-that-are-still-strong-buy/
ADBE is rocking!!! GO ADBE GO!!!
strong manipulation not sure why
"UBS has some pretty uncannily accurate predictions to their credit. They've consistently turned billion dollar profits during quarters when everyone else was down. Over the past decade, people suspected UBS and attempted to ensnare UBS traders with investigations and accusations of insider trading. To date, none bore fruit. That said, the one real eye opener was when Goldman Sachs and UBS engaged in lengthy suits and countersuits for the theft of proprietry ""trade secrets"" and the theft of key programmers for their teams. It turns out that the 2 people in question were leading edge programmers that had come across a genetic algorithym capable of detecting earnings results before they actually came out - and they made billions. Now days literally dozens of research teams across the industry employ quant analyisis utilizing the latest in AI (genetic algorithms) to detect moves before they happen. Know this to be true (and it is), there is no way in hell I am going to go against UBS when 4 days before ADBE is set to reveal their 1st quarter numbers come out with an upgrade on ADBE and raise their target price by some 25%, We will all know for sure by late Thursday but I'll tell you one thing; there is no way in the world I would bet against that UBS prediciton. They are the best in the world."
259 soon
"Over all market is down, also effected by ZM and CRM tech, but will be fine on earningBuy now and smile Tuesday."
NASDAQ and DOW futures are all dropped in after hours....
Most of my retirement in AAPL and ADBE!!!!! I sleep well at night.
hot market
"Oops, turns out, ADBE will be red tomorrow"
this stock is a pig. sell before Biden gets elected and thank me November 4th
AMC being bought by NFLX. NFLX everywhere.David Kerr targeting $760 price target for NFLX!
glad i waited til the last min and didn't sell. bc I wanted to hold this til tomorrow.
Adobe is up 5.18% to 477.53
This is hitting $478 post
Think it goes up and today and tomorrow to a slight pullback at ER and then back up next week?
Nice $8-10k in the morning hopefully! Never know now a days!
Big beat
On a good ER she's gonna spike in the 190s before consolidating.
ADBE==market perform==sell any strength!Target $250!
"I like and own shares of Bridgeline Digital (BLIN), a tiny company in enterprise software. BLIN is trading at ev/ sales of only about 0.55 as it moves to subscription model. BLIN is worth consideration. They have good technology, but not enough scale. Bridgeline’s CEO Ari Kahn, Univ. of Chicago graduate and PhD in computer science, sold his previous company to Oracle. FYI - Univ. of Chicago alumni have a vast network of influential people (Microsoft CEO Nadella, Apple Board member Wagner)."
"Hold ADBE, $200 should hit by years end."
Going to turn RED AH as I expected.
ADBE is rocking on extremely strong sales and earnings in their quarterly earnings!!! This stock will reach $ 320.00 in the next 30 minutes!!!
"Great company, great numbers! Bright future!"
"ADBE to close at $ 260 today, and open at $ 270 tomorrow."
"Adobe is offering 90 days free for their Creative Suite subscribers. We just redeemed ours and will not have to pay anything now until July. As a person whose in a company raved by the virus where business income is down to basically crumbs this is a great help and we will take it. But as an investor, will this cause them to miss the numbers badly this quarter once everyone gets their credit?"
Weak af
beat or not. Adobe always goes down after earnings yet continues to climb yearly.
well looks like i am getting ready to sell my stake.
This stock has now only moved up 10% since before the COVID crash. Time to buy?
Zero catalysts is a poster boy of bubble stock
Adobe stock upgraded at Stephens after earnings
Adobe target hiked to $315 at Jefferies after earnings
Until the Trump Ministry of Market Manipulation releases its next pump and dump alert stocks will drift lower. ADBE IS AN ACCUMULATE BETWEEN 240 AND 270.
Looks like my predictions have been offset by the current broad market selloff. I'm taking it as a gift and just bought more. You've got to see the correlation as to why the market is selling off (Covid19 is surging where lockdowns were lifted) and the very catalyst that drove much of the world to the Adobe Cloud Suite of Productivity (from anywhere) Tools. THE FUTURE FOR ADBE LOOKS VERY BRIGHT TO ME!
When is the greatest time to get?
Be ready for Thursday: it’s a great company
All time high before next earnings. What a gift at $454 this morning. Bought 1000 shares. Come to daddy !
Not sure why?
Next decade for Adobe is going to be EPIC! Adobe is the Epicenter of Digital and Creativity!
"Everything in the past two to three weeks has been low volume that's a good sign. If you take a look at its fundamentals their solid. Technically speaking take a look at their chart. It's forming a cup and handle and right now it's just formed it's handle. Expect this to shoot up especially if it gets support from the market. If I'm long or anyone else I wouldn't get out. This thing is surefire expected to shoot up past its high. To boot if Trump wins the election which all signs point that he will, even more guarantee to go up"
Pretty encouraging article. Golden Cross happened again this morning.
Workfront acquisition?!?
"Earnings eruptions trade, our #1 day trading setup, is off to a nice start this earnings season. Learn a great strategy for trading earnings - https://youtu.be/f4UtKIpt9nY"
Just sold everything at 265 will buy back wen the dust settles
ADOBE is a Rocket and I'm riding along. I'll be touching the Angels at this rate ADBE FOR LIFE
"their at a 40 forward pe. people are on here saying it undervalued. whats it worth, a 100 forward pe. you do know their growth rate has been slowing the last year right. same with salesforce. it wasn't enough they doubled in the last year right. there's some losers on here pushing the wrong metrics. adobe is expensive as hell. id rather invest in amazon given they just one the union battle."
An enormous beat actually
Option expire tomorrow. It should go back $270 Friday opening bell
"This is EXCEPTIONAL news for the entire ""STAY AT HOME"" Stock sector.THINGS ARE BOOMING!!!!! (thank you Southern States for lifting your lockdowns WAY TOO EARLY!)"

"ADBE CC product suite is at the heart and soul of the global, cloud based WORK FROM HOME PLATFORM.What better vehicle to own during these unprecedented times of ""social isolation""?"
"Market cap around Software as Service is now 15-20 time revenue and 50-100 time earning.What's even more funny is everyone forced to use technology in last 6 month. what that mean? We have hyper adoption to technology but more important no one left out.If there is trend that everyone buying bed, what happen after everyone got bed. Specially what happen when everyone get bed almost same time. Next year sale would not just stop growing, decline by large."
ADBE is not NFLX which can fly to sky after reporting solid ER.I don't like ADBE at all!
Anybody know why it's down $3 in the pre-market?
Just got a hot tip from (http://stocktip.xyz)
"ADBE showing some nice strength this past week. Is this the beginning of the breakout we've been waiting for or a continuation of the typical 6th month pattern? An outstanding quarter, some recent upgrades, an overdone consolidation period....."
shld go up after hrs and pop tmw morning...
"Apple had great earnings, but not so positive guidance brought the stock price down.Opposite adbe, very good 2019 guidance and only missed a penny!Up $20 tomorrow! Short Squeeze!!!!"
I sold tsla for the adobe's earnings! I hope I didn't make a mistake!
Longs?!!!
Wow NVDA
Adobe must cut costs and fire the CEO. This company is in stagnating mode. Giving hiring preference to Indians and Indian relatives backfires.
Adobe reached an all time high at 475.33
ADBE selling off at low of ATR of 11ish. I'm a buyer here.This company has only gotten better and stronger as a result of COVID.Long and strong at 426
Some trader bought $6million puts on this. I’m only in for 1k calls and I’m cringing haha
I’m in just under $178 guess I should of waited for a better spot. Might sell on a spike then buy back in the drop. I think adobe and oracle go positive after earnings. I like adobe more
Look at Coupa. Down after earnings Monday up 7 percemt two days later
Ya I would like ABDE to be above 480 by Jan 15th... got greedy and didn’t close my position.
go go go
"Asking every company I am a shareholder, to ask themselves, what can we do to help our country and frontline healthcare workers. Adobe now is the time to join the fight"
"It will rebound this just the typical sell on news and ask questions later , they started selling immediately without hearing the full numbers"
Adobe's stable revenue stream is allowing the company to keep innovating. It's very difficult to be a media professional without Adobe because the software is so widely used.
See you guys at $225 - $228 Looks at the chart guys!!!!
Oversold territory now!
Adobe is up 4.91% to 508.23
fake forecast
"ADBE has been consolidating in a wide sloppy base for 6 months. I don't think institutions have built in high expectations going into this earnings report which means we shouldn't see a sell off on results meeting expectations. We might get a rally post earnings if guidance is good. The valuation is a little rich but nothing compared to the stay-at-home places, i.e. ZM and DOCU."
initial headfake in ah
"Doubled up my amount when it was 438 thing morning. Hopefully, I got the timing right for once."
Down another 2%. Should be some support at 145 area (100 DMA). But doesn't look like that will hold given the volume. Next support not until 138. GLTA.
Long on $appl $adbe $now and $mime Can’t wait to pick up more on the next dip!
still buying more with rate cut going up to 500 or put your money in oil stocks lol
Looks like a solid report! As usual the stocks selloff after beating!
A bit expensive forward PE is much lower than trailing PE and still bubbled significantly
"Adobe is the new Hogwarts of of Witchcraft and Wizardry, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYUbyR2qalg ! Amazing a group of twenty somethings from everycorner of the world creating real magic that leave one breathless. On the campus of Adobe the once impossible is now possible. One can not even imagine the future these young wizards are creating. BEST Sneaks EVER by a MILE, congrats!"
"ADBE has had quite the run up recently. Profit takers can take control for a bit, no biggy! I will just add more"
"I'd buy this here but everyone knows that Shopify will likely come out with Shopify-photoshop and Shopify-acrobat as a compliment to their influencer merchant platform, thereby crushing Adobe in the process."
Is just the beging of the fall guys . Till 1st January 200
Greatest bubble of all time in this and similar hugh flying stocks. 22 times revenue.
Good to see ADBE came right back. I see it climbing back and working the $525-550 range for a while. This is a keeper stock.
no stock is expensive comparing to TSLA
Beat
Another 2% drop to start the day. Makes no sense
When is Adobe gonna split?? Maybe 2:1 or maybe even 3:1 stock split would be nice. Any news??
Lower low and lower high so far today....
ADBE is down 14.91% to 285.48
ADBE is among the most hated sftware stocks due to lacking of innovation!
"As you can see technically and fundamentally, as well as from the excessively bright future announced and discussed last week by management - It is easy to see how possible it is that ADOBE make a very nice new high this month. Vey nice indeed!"
200 buckDrop a coming
"Now put all 3 articles together and read their blog, Adobe is la leading AI platform now...https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-sensei/"
ADBE is extremely bullish!!! Here We Go!!!
"Owned ADBE for several years and the ride I've enjoyed is nothing short of a dream. 500 is coming soon. Shorts are advised to cover now...there is nothing to be bearish about on this stock. It has a moat, is COVID proof, and no serious competition in sight. As long as that's the case this stock has unlimited upside. Never too late to own and I've been buying all the way up. Currently have a 230 percent return. $$$$$"
"Don’t forget two prominent analysts downgraded the stock after earnings. BAD, BAD, BAD"
Good earnings! Will be green tomorrow no doubt
"lol mandalorian, I think you just need to face the fact that this is not a stock to short. I watched this for a while thinking it just really has to go down at some point. but then I did a bit of research and decides to hop on the train with a smallish position. no regrets so far :-D"
havin fun watchin your money get flushed down the toilet mo-rons?
This stock is so undervalued! Gonna load up more today! see you all at $700 
Added today
Limit buy on ADBE at 250.00
DID YOU SEE that close manpulation? ADBE DOWN 20+ points at the Close- Than within SECONDS- went RIGHT_BACK up again to the closing price of $175!!!!!!!
$260 will be a great buying opportunity if it gets there.
just added a bit to my ADBE long swing trade on earnings. you never know ~ but i have been doing this game for 22 years and that's my intuition.
We're moving after hours. What's the news?
"Will double in 24 months, Adobe is like a clock, just keeps ticking higher."
Could it be that bad?!
"Took some profits yesterday at 289. Always wishing I would have waited, but oh well. My avg. cost is 79. Can't complain."
i’m hoping that we’re randomly going to rebound and end up 4% at the end of the day even though it’s probably not going to happen 
wish this one would be a little less indecisive about that 200 mark
Adobe is currently lower than in June

"Not looking good for longs in the premarket - wow - not going to be pretty, major selloff coming today"
it would be crazy to sell here / add on momentum
Still 6 million ADBE short shares out there .. soon to be crushed
"Does ADBE have the oomph necessary to break out? Volume, the fuel that's necessary to launch the rocket is anemic. Checking past performance I don't think it's been this consistently low for day's in a row that its been (this low). I'm not saying sell or not to accumulate. But, I do think caution is the watch word of the day. A breakout to a new high would certainly be nice. The old high is not that far away. But, where's the oomph? Where's the volume necessary to make it happen? We should all be fine as long as we have our exit strategy in place. However - CAUTION!"

Are they going to beat earnings ?
MacKeeper virus linked to Adobe updateDoes Adobe get a kickback? It is the worst virus I have seen in years. Adobe really needs to put a lawsuit on MacKeeper if they are not knowingly involved
Selling this short. Adobe is running out of customers for Creative Cloud. Far too many 40% off promotions being the primary indicator.
hmm what's it going to be
"why it is down? beats earnings, doesn't it?"
whole market is in dumps .. shorts stop scaring us .. when market gets normal this will see 560
"$500  (again, finally)"
No real reason to be down 6% today. Buying opportunity.
ADBE will reach $ 485.00 by the close today!!! GO ADBE GO!!!
ADBE IS EXTREMELY BULLISH AHEAD OF THEIR EARNINGS AFTER HOURS TODAY!!! LOOK AT THEIR ! MONTH CHART!!!
ADBE must truly be the biggest bubble out there. I just don’t see why the share price should be more than $100-150
Earning beat
ZI...killing it again.
I think its going to solid earnings and above 290 after AH
Question - where can you easily find how many multiples a stock is trading above its price?
Would not buy 1 share even if it drops 15% after earnings.
Let push ADBE to 180 today

"Nice movement today, gained 25% of yesterdays losses."
thanks god I didn't short this.
"Market is moving strangely this week, too many new people at once, it’s smashing things around"
Shut up and add! Its gains O'clock!
If you trying to recover your losses buy Tesla
ADBE and FDX teaming up. Nice.
200 stock
"Amazing... simply amazing.. when the stock is on its way up we have pumpers coming out and cheering for $300, and when an overall market correction (typical of October) takes place, morons come out and singing the dooms day and ""too expensive, will test $200 near term"" song - and of course the numbers all being pulled out of their rear end without any bases what so ever!! LOL"
I said 10 down it went 30 geez
Why did this go up 17% after soft guidance?
darlin
sinking ship of american economy
Fantastic quarter! Let the ADBE shorts burn! Big rally coming.
Buy today!
Pathetic
lowered guidance! tried to warn you with factual numbers!
"These stocks are lagard: ADBE, PAYC,"
"Upgrades in morning, CNBC Fast Money says buy buy buy"
"I wonder: how many of the people happy about ADBE are long-time users of their products? I suspect most here only look at the financials and the growth of same and have no perspective about how the company treats the customers it makes so much money from; nor do they likely have a negative opinion of Adobe's monopoly power, which was overlooked (IMO) by the DOJ because their purchase of Macromedia (and subsequent deprecation of Freehand) was happening at the same time the DOJ's investigative resources were fully occupied by their prosecution of Microsoft. I am curious..."
Just covered the Dec 105 calls shorted yesterday.Now ready for leg up to test all time 111.00 high (I think we'll take it out this time)
"Sell this stagnating garbage and buy AMC. Once AMC squeezes, you may buy back ABDE x10, if you are THAT attached to this stock. AMC FOMO!"
ADBE reached a new All Time High at 211.90
Do the Mueller report comes out in a few hours and we just had the Barr press conference. Can we get off the sell the news cycle and get back to trading based on the economy and individual company performance?
"now there are no Friends left........... stable genius, where are you?"

The run looks over for now.

Such boring products from a boring company. Can't believe it was a darling stock for a long time.
Quiet board
Buy FB Nflx to make the adbe loss back
"Still Long 190 shares of ADBE at $305.80. I am really liking how this stock has acted today, I think there is more upside potential than downside risk, so I will hold this for Monday. Already have really nice profit on my earnings play here, but want more and there is nothing really grabbing me among the Monday morning earnings releases. I see this baby consolidating at the $320 level today, and there is a good chance she will break through and go higher, to $325+, on Monday. Will definitely close this position sometime on Monday, and do my next Earnings play, which I will be researching over the weekend. Best of Luck to All!"
can someone post CC highlights here? i'm at work and can't listen to it. thanks in advance
Nose dive?
"Adobe crushes earnings, goes down four dollars. I smell a rat. bye bye."

"Almost there... almost there. Patience Luke. Let go of your emotions. Don't be hating. Use the Force. Buy @ $235-237. Its the way of the Jedi, and the smart investor/trader."
Blowout!!
ADBE is up 4.91% to 290.37
Go manipulated
It’s gonna be at 185 tomorrow. Earnings were awesome. Solid company we have here.
Nice to see the ramp up today. Adobe is such a crafty company. I wonder what they could accomplish with a workplace collaboration suite and what opportunities await.
Tomorrow’s this willDrop to 470 only holding at 483 cause of the volume once everyone sells and moves there money into other securities this will go down
but will rocket if earnings are good
"pure manipulations. call volume like this. ADBE200918C00480000 2020-09-16 1:24PM EDT 480.00 9.45 9.45 10.00 -16.61 -63.74% 1,198 2,122"
This is a beast of a stock. I am a designer and have used it for 20 years now. My yearly subscription keeps going up but I hedged that with stock :) LOL Now my kids are teens and getting into it to create careers. Generational MOAT people. IT IS THE MOAT GOAT!!!!!!!!
Buy before earnings or no? I want to take a position here buy wondering if I should wait until after earnings are released this week. Thanks
Oracle just Crashed big time
is this stock boring or what?
Here comes the greed.
still trading in the mid 80s bit surprised we didnt see a stronger rebound after yesterday especially since raised guidance is still fresh news guess we have to wait until march for confirmation of better outlook?
"Small beat on revs, big beat on bottom line, RAISED GUIDANCE"
Jim Cramer gave solid positive outlook at the end of the show for ADBE and CEO is coming on tomorrow. Stop all downgrades rumor guys!! He actually mentioned UPGRADES for this stock!!!
Broke through $180! Let's keep churning.
"man i have should buy put, so bad"
"460s is reasonable price for adbe . not gonna add here , not bearish either"
This is definitely hitting 400 in the next week or so
Why was ADBE down 11 dollars and 8 cents today?
Hey  all$ADBE LONG - via Long Call Options Nice EPS BEAT today.Noticed that this board doesn’t have much convos concerning $ADBE.Anyways . Congrats to all longs .
Adobe is down 4.93% to 507.51
"Adobe should cut underperforming orgs. Like DX, e-sign, e-commerce engineering, etc."
man I just hope it goes to $ 40 by earning day.
Struggling to stay above $440... should see $444 tm at open
It ripped up like we all knew it would! enjoy them gains folks.
"Had a funny feeling this would happen, glad I got my puts"
Crush into 120.. not good
earnINGS are TOMORROW MORNINg. adobe ir website says so.
sell adbe buy msft
Roasted! Longs got cooked- major selloff coming tomorrow- YES PLEASE show me the money! This was very weak earnings for the stock price and the selloff will be brutal- good for shorts and put buyers and well.....lube up longs
im riding this short into earings banking on lower guidance and the fact that wall street hasn't cared about good earnings. Any kind of miss in ANY way this thing is dropping big. The upside reward is much lower
I think it goes up Monday after the options expire Friday at closing Bell
"dancing back n forrh for now, until analysts come out with upgrades, tomorrow should see some movement, on the technical side avoiding the death cross and a significant price drop is already a win, raised guidances will take adone higher. glta joe out"
300 today?
Adobe is #$%$
"As coronavirus stockpiling catches up to itself, the big run up in stocks like WMT and CSTO is going to come to an end as people stop and take hold of the notion that they have time on their hands to do something other than EAT. For starters, they are going to be thinking, how can I best socialize with my loved ones and friends from from at home and engage in business communications? (ZM) or (TEAM), and then just as importantly, how can I earn money and, using what tools from at home? (ADBE, ADSK, EBAY, CRM, SQ, AVID) and lastly, how can I educate myself on how to use those tools to improve my saleable skills for now and on the other side of the tunnel when this is all over and the world is forever changed? (LRN,BEAM, CHGG, MSFT (which owns Lynda.com) through purchase of LinkedIn)"
wow.
called it :*
"Good to see ADBE coming back. I hope you took advantage of the drop. Unless the Nasdaq crashes again, I don't think Adobe will see $450 again for a long time."
My cost basis is 96. Happy to buy more on the dip. ADBE is unstoppable.
ADBE is up 4.92% to 225.59
285.37 is the bottom band. That is a HUGE downside potential. ALWAYS TAKE PROFITS and never chase.
Finally some upward momentum pre-market

"Sure looks like business is back. +20% revenue growth next quarter. Should be at all time highs, by end of year."
can you imagine the size of regret of those who are selling right now?
At this rate I would be happy with $485 tomorrow.Congress sure knows how to screw with the markets.
Adobe cooking the books since 2K like a well-oiled engine
should I buy?
garbage==ADBE==laggard!
looking for at least 550 max after the earnings release.
Adobe the day after earnings have a 5% to 10% Pop history if beating earning by single digit. In tgis case double digit beat
look like ADBE would over 200 very sooni expect 250 target.
"I am loading up more at this price. Adobe is the work-from-home, do-everything multimedia software. There's just no competition."
give me 170 for adobe...wkwkwkwkwk i still waiting LoL
GO ADBE GO!!!!
We are on the move. Enjoy the ride to $500+ sometime next week.
ADBE is down 5.27% to $208.11
buying 200 tomorrow and wish myself merry Christmas.
looks like the SEC didn't want ADBE to anounce their earnings miss on a day the nasdaq dived. Bad news for longs
How high it might go?

Watching adbe try to eek up is like watching a glacier move.
ADBE might close at 154$-155$
No brainer at this price
why is this barely moving pm
"I have seen fading the day before ER, which doesn't mean the ER will miss. I doubt it here."
It looks like a big day for ADBE.
ADBE should beat 300$ less than a year imo.
ADBE Beats 3.14 versus 2.78 estimate on earnings. HUGE!
Load time guys
"Adobe killed, only going to get better from here as we get back to normal! ADBE going to $700!!!"
500+lets go babe
looking to get back in around 140....

330 by close.
Unbelievable. I'm in shock at the market reaction. What's a company to do? Excellent earnings. I expected the opposite of what happened.
BULLISH COMPRESSION - open - 359-361 (area) - no sellers - test the 52. week

"Honestly, this is an absolute joke of a market....why are Palantir and Tesla up today and this isn't?!?!"
Lower guidance again...

Im feeling sorry for the stoopidputz that bought the fat premium PUTS I sold today.
"Nice earnings, -0.20% AH"
ADBE: buy when it's on sales - Uptrend resume soon...
ADBE is down 4.96% to $233.60
We are closer to 300s than to 500s. Adobe should start cutting costs by letting go their management. They can easily cut dead wood.
Market hates this purchase. Just look at the stock today. What ajoke.
This looks good
"Adobe Digital Marketing had lost the battle to SAP and Salesforce. Adobe Sign is loosing to DocuSign. Anything Adobe is touching turns to rubbish. Cut the costs, lay off useless management and contractors. Stop hiring only Indians. There are tons of 100% Indian teams in eCommerce, Adobe Sign, Adobe Experience (ex. Data platform) at Adobe HQ."
@mel slaughtered really missed by a penny but beat ecerywhere else. record quarter and yearly with raised guidance and you thinknits going to get slaughtered?!? i remember shorting my first stock lmao
This has been going back and forth all day nobody is sure what to do
Buy the dip.
like the stock but at a PE of 57 hard to justify buying here; its not growing that fast.
"Remind me again... why did ADBE buy Fotolia?-------Shutterstock, Inc. (SSTK), a leading global provider of commercial imagery and music, today announced that its vast collection of high-quality photos and illustrations is now accessible within Adobe Photoshop software through its new custom built plugin. With more than 100,000 new images added every day, the Shutterstock plugin boasts the largest collection of photos and illustrations that can be licensed directly within the Creative Cloud desktop application."
Also the massive cash currently saved abroad will be brought in to be used for further expansion and acquiring other companies.
Why is it not rising ffs???????
Was 200 months ago wake up
ADBE will reach 578$ possibly.
this stock is an unstoppable beast :-D
Shantanu Narayen (and all his Indian friends - board members) should go.
"Adobe looking strong here! Saw, Shantanu on CNBC last week and thought to myself, Adobe must be killing it!"
What in tarnations is going on AH?
anything above $312 and i'll be happy.
"just wanted to state I lost 95% on my Put, taking the loss from buying it yesterday, crushed"
"Lots of people with rose colored glasses on this board, its like they don't even want to think the market, or this stock, could go down at some stage, despite the fact that this is the 10th year of the bull market, earnings are peaking or in some industry sectors like cyclicals have peaked, interest rates are going up, wages are going up reducing profitability, we are at a serious risk for a trade war with China and everyone else, NAFTA could collapse, Iran is soon going to become a threat again now that we've pulled out of the treaty, stock valuations are factoring in growth in earnings that are highly unlikely to materialize, Paul Manafort went to jail today and may soon be joined by Michael Cohen, and we are entering the traditionally weak months in the market. Of course, Adobe is going to 300 next week!! Cheers."
With everything going on with IRAN I can't help but believe you'd have to be a total nut job leaving profits on the table over the weekend especially after such a solid run. Suspect major sell off tomorrow.
Well at least ADBE is a good holding to carry over into next year not much risk to it. Them Bitcoin fanatics are running for the hills today.
new 52 week high
One of Cramer's favorites. Hmmm... That can be tragic.
Adobe bubble? Tread lightly through earnings... https://www.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/mtec/chair-of-entrepreneurial-risks-dam/documents/FCO/FCO_Cockpit_April_2018.pdf
Hoping it would pull a salesforce or zoom jump but not complaining!
What is going on?
2.29/share beats 2.26/share and 2.99B beats 2.97B estimates.
"I called the bottom of the 2008-9 financial crisis the day after it happened. I’ll tentatively call this one, the selloff is over. Almost all signs point north now. Unlike 2009, though, we do have some big problems brewing (indictments, impeachment), but it was trade that was really scaring the markets and things are now looking very good on that front. Trump just has to make nice now that he’s won, rather than gloat. Kind comments toward president Xi, etc, about a constructive trade relationship, will cement this rally.I’m betting on big gains.$NVDA $FB $ADBE $MU $GOOGL $MSFT $NFLX $AMZN $AAPL $IBKR"
ADBE reached a new All Time High at 251.08
200 cap for a software that everyone can use for free LOL
"The bot spammers on this board are ridiculous. mute and mute and mute. Anyways folks, looks like futures is strong for tomorrow. looking for a strong movement up. perhaps next week we can cut into our recent downward thrend."
The DAILY ATR for this stock is around 10.00 - meaning - don't sell your shares today unless you see over 407.00. Very nice picture on the horizon. Great results and forecasts coming from company tomorrow and don't forget the United Bank of Switzerland price target of 450 still looms - it's waiting for us.
This is BIG MONEY MOVING - Institutional Cash - millions of shares
beat!!! we're going up boys.
"one of the executives sold some shares... that being said people sell their shares for many different reasosns, but something to consider. although i think it will still do great"

Don't think I've gone a day without using Adobe one way or another.
Just bought a sh%t load of Adobe stock. This is going to hit big making us all money. I should be able to hit $10k or more in profit on all the stock.
ADBE is ready for a big breakout!!! GO ADBE GO!!!
Weak outlook!!!
guess wall street really wanted to burn options players? lol
"I was pretty impressed with guidance and results, thinking this would finish December $510 to $515. Digital Docs and Creative content along with partnerships and marketing should pad the numbers and exceed them in 2021."

@Rick are you not entertained!!!!!
Down 20 tomorrow
"I believe in ADOBE as I use their products myself , but is this at the peak right now? Wait for a dip?"
"If you buy back now you save over 3% or be greedy and wait for 5%...,,,up to u"
Timbrrrrrr
It will be green tomorrow at open and during the day. Bear trap right now in AH.
"ADBE: breakout of 5 years HIGH, this indicates it will move to above 500ssooon"
Worth 200 max get out while u can all of tech a bubble
What happened with earnings?
When will earnings be announced?????
"Great company, great business, but definitely overvalued like the rest of the market."
"Wow Trollville here, must be going higher soon"
"Good earning but I don’t thing it justifies super high valuation, stock is going to struggle all week... hoping it holds 480"
Uh doby 
Dang out of no where right before 8 big $3 drop off? I know the more tariffs news came out but still did not see that coming
"There are no serious alternatives to Adobe Photoshop, Acrobat, Premiere, Lightroom, InDesign. Professionals are using them and will be using them for a long, long time."
"P/C is almost 1.5 for ADBE , a very bearish sign."
expectations are low
"thank u, friend Powell, we'll take it from here"
Does ADBE have any exposure to China and the potential trade war?
@ michael - current low P/E does not mean much if earning expectations go down.
-6% to +3%...not buying it...it's goin red!
"P/S of 12.3, PEG Ratio at 1,85, little cash, and a sky high pe. Couple this with a chart tha is INCREDIBLY bearish. Strong Sell folks....."
I'm going to take a quick nap. Wake me up when we hit green.
I am so scared
something's up...ADBE never reports in the morning before the market opens.......
$300 open tomorrow
1.71/share
Sorry....Earnings are on the 13th....This Thursday after the close. ADBE looking good going into earnings. Charts are positive.
Tis garbage stocks: ADBE/NTES/KLAC/ROKU...SQ
"Goldman predicts Adobe will experience explosive growth this year, will outperform its competitor's and be the #1 company/stock in its category. Their current price target is $291.00..."

Free and easy money.
"Top takeaways;Creative Cloud, rose 29 percent to $1.21 billion.Subscription revenue rose nearly 37 percent to $1.48 billion in the three months.Revenue jumped 26.7 percent to $1.77 billion."
It is beyond belief that this solid stock is going down for the last one week after excellent quarterly results.
I almost bought in at $491. The big boys may know something about this steady decline...
"The options bet could’ve been completed today also , selling in the AH , will sometimes cause more selling pressure , He made a good profit.Maybe the goal was to take the profits n buy it back at a cheaper price .so many variables. I’m still long/ BULLISH on $ADBE ... think there will be a bounce soon.Avgd the price of my long calls lol. GTLA"

"Wow, WOW, WOW this is not a good report, Adobe what are you doing? This was very, very weak - and guidance was stupid bad"
ADBE ==forced liquidation by index fund==!
Love the Ceo Shantanu. Awesome person. Co. is great. 5 Star Co.
ADBE issues strong guidance for the balance of 2021!!! GO ADBE GO!!!
"Hi fellow investors! I just bought into ADBE today. I chose Adobe for many reasons. Adobe has greatly outperformed the index in the last few years. Adobe is rated by Morningstar as a Wide Moat company. Adobe has a low debt to equity ratio of 43% indicating they should whether any future big debt economic crisis They have a A rated credit rating. They are held in two Ark Invest funds of ARKW and ARKF indicating that ARK Invest believes Adobe has deep growth value. Adobe is heavily held by many hedge funds. Lastly, Adobe is an iconic brand, whose software is being taught to university students. Long Adobe!!!"
Come on: it is really boring tiny up/down !
"Adobe needed a major positive surprise to move higher. It did not get that and price is going back down to test support at the 50 day moving average. Adobe is overvalued, and expected good earnings was not good enough. Earnings hit the whisper numbers, no surprises. Great company, great earnings but the price is too high. Now we will find out what the efficient market price is. After hours is not very efficient. Buy backs also make for inefficient pricing. I expect we will see some of that on the open"
"C'mon folks, who can possibly deny that ADBE is in a huge bubble with numbers like those:- PEG Ratio (5 yr expected) 11.10 - Price/Sales (ttm): 14.22 - Price/Book (mrq): 13.78 ADBE and MSFT will be the last companies to come down to earth, but they will, it is only a matter of time. Better get those stop-losses in place if you haven't already done so."
Even MSFT can up 2% today: ADBE moves too slow!
ADBE will touch $530 soon.
should be at 550$
Lvs or travel stocks better buy as technology sector getting hit..
What happened to softwares? Most if not all are tanking this morning.
ya dumping it ....2m shares traded 1m less than average day. nobody dumping maybe few taking profits out of the unknown I say solid beat and guidance. $185-190 AH and possibly $190+ open
I trust the UBS algo. They've simply been right too many times. And this is a very big fish....
ADBE is up 7.23% to 315.91
Target raised to 550
"You can bet there will be an effort to drop the price to protect the option trader who bet, and is now losing, 6 milly. Bet his household is quiet right about now."
I sold BAR and bought more ADBE and VTI.

"ADBE's main focus seems to be security in images/media, whilst this is a nice to have it doesn't provide new products or features. They have already gone for the rent model and they don't seem to be offering anything innovated to the content creators. Not sure where the upside is at this point. I'm out."
Owned since $259. It would be foolish to sell now. I’m expecting a big run up to earnings as other tech companies benefiting from work-at-home measures are beating earnings expectations.
beat big time
"Bridgeline Digital (BLIN), my top holding, is making transition to SaaS model, like Adobe did in 2013 – 2014 (ADBE CFO Mark Garrett did a super job navigating thru SaaS shift). BLIN stock is beaten up, shows multiple insider purchases and worth consideration."
Should I buy into this? Someone let me know...

I think the JPMorgan downgrade is fake news can't find any details on it other than it being briefly mentioned in a few obscure articles.
greed push the stock to greater heights at the cost of the peril in other stocks in any sector
Could smb pls explain how come the analysts expect 3.76B revenue? I mean thats about 10% QoQ growth. I dont recall Adobe revenue increase that fast

ADBE to 150
"Thank you adbe, really needed that after today. Just hope market recovers tomorrow, then this will be at $425 easy"

NASDAQ gonna drop like a ROCK tomorrow due to FED disappointed market today...and so does ADBE...Just sold 5.3k shares to secure my account !
Predictions for today’s earning?
"The Good — This is one profitable company. Apple's continued forced obsolescence will propel people into an Adobe subscription plan. I imagine they will have a great earnings report coming up. I think there's a huge opportunity for Adobe if they can find a way to bring an NFT art market to life.The Bad — I want to see what's coming next. As a user, I see Adobe blundering in how they treat their customers, such as dropping support for XD on marginally older macOS. Insider sales are indeed signaling danger. The Adobe stock price is strongly correlated to AAPL, which is not too happy right now.Overall I'm feeling neutral, but leaning bullish. I can see the stock price trading in a range between $475 and $525 until there's news."
CRM delivered strong earnings and guidance after the close; ADBE up in sympathy. Should be a big day for software sector tomorrow.
New competitor entering the ring soon. ADBE is still as rock solid of an investment that you can get.
Is it good enough?
150 next week!
Time to load this on dip
Close at 385. tomorrow open at 330. Gluck to long. 
Big news with the acquisition should be going above $520 even if market isn't good . If all else was equal this stock with Acquisition should position it to at least $550$600
250 by end of month
"I recall, it was hugs and thugs last night on mad dash. You were ordered to Buy at $250. How's that working out"
"ADBE reports phenomenal earnings/sales growth and guides higher. The market punishes this stock???? I do not understand. The same thing happened to MU in the last quarter. ADBE and MU are 2 excellent companies which are both ""Strong Buys"". This is easy money for those who buy on this ""dip"" this morning!!!"
Volume starting to pick-up. Feels like they will announce at 1700 Eastern.
"Very poor results, was higher AH, when the Market wasn't up last night $406"
It’s on sale
"Everything seems good about Adobe. Solid Company, and all analyses are extremely positive. I am in with 20% of my total investments.Excuse my grammer. I am from Denmark."

"there it goes.... time to buy, buy, buy!"
"Anybody who has the words ""Pro"" or ""elite"" in their username are anything but that. Adobe will consolidate in this range and be back over $300 soon enough."
Does anyone have an opinion how or if the move by google chrome to stop supporting the adobos flash player will affect the company in any way or stock reaction at least..? pumpers and dumpers please refrain from answering thanks.
Hedge funds and institutions selling based on a citi report?? I thought software is the place to go with all these china turmoil.

Like ADBE and ADPT to new high
ADBE 550$ end of day?
"My lowest cost basis on ADBE shares is $104, bought more making the cost basis $148.02. Long the stock and plan to stay long for life. This company has a moat and it is the best cloud stock IMO along with NOW. You don't sell companies with moats. You hold onto them."

"Anyone who is not buying ADBE at these discounted prices is a damn fool. ADOBE stock is in the midst of experiencing the most powerful BULLISH technical indicator known to trader's and investor's. It is called the ""golden cross"". This is when the 50 day SMA (slow moving average), moving upward, crosses above the 200 day SMA. This doesn't happen often folks. This is one hell of a wonderful buying opportunity that will result in a better life for you and your family. In the short term, we should be above $290 within the new quarter."
YIKES!! UP 18.00 in Afer hours!
We will see $ 500.00 very soon!!! GO ADBE GO!!!
Big miss! OMG!
Up 1.4% in the first 9 minutes of pre market could mean a big push UP so hold on!!
550 by may
ADBE is not inflated like most other growth tech stocks right now. It’s actually at a decent price and worth accumulating more shares. It’s consistently been growing revenues and earnings and will continue to do so. May not be as explosive as some other more speculative names but in the long run slow and steady wins the race. But again most importantly this stock is not hugely over priced and does not have the negative press or the us government hovering over it like other big tech stocks. use this lull as an opportunity to expand your position in this stock.
Like ADBE and buying IQ rocket
ATH tomorrow
Really glad to see the support at this level. We’re above the 50 day moving average for the first time since August. At this rate we’ll pass the 100 dma next week and then further north?
"Is today’s price action just ADBE mirroring the nasdaq, or is there something else going on?"
"Adobe's ""technical issues"" last week tells us one thing; USER DEMAND IS THROUGH THE ROOF.Brace yourselves for some phenomenal earnings this quarter."
$270.00 before earnings Thursday .
Wow. Horrible action.
Best slate of new products EVER!!! Adobe's product innovation is accelerating!
"Remember to always take profits especially during times of uncertainty. 2 P.M. FED makes decision on whether a cut is coming or not to rates, if no cut expect massive crash. Current rally has already priced in a cut."
This will go up today per MF.....
Fundamentals are strong...highly innovative company...buy buy buy
"Wow, -$40 in 24 hrs. That certainly wiped out some folks."
still above 400..
$580-600Big prize of ADBE at the end of 2020
ADBE pre announced they will exceed their earnings estimate.Their SP has held up better than almost any of the big tech stocks.Their products are not affected by tarrifs or trade war or anything related to China.SP recently (last week) hit 260.Cramer came out and supported the stock two days ago.Even the bears on the overall market (calling for a recession in 2019) agree we will have a positiveclose for stocks this year.All that helps me to conclude buying pre earnings is a reasonably sound decision.
"PE 53 seems extremeearnings look to be around 2.8% returngood growth but, that's so far, will it continue enough to justify the PE of 53maybe notup too much in one year, 10 years evencautious short?"

"Just about every copy of every Adobe product in use within southeast Asia is cracked, a.k.a. not paid for. Plus, all these cracked versions are easily accessible. Lets face facts, at least 70% of the general population are dishonest. This and the fact of low cost competitive products getting much better all adds up to a big SELL."
ADBE is down 4.97% to $250.13
Look at ADBE rock!!! GO ADBE GO!!!
ADBE reached a new All Time High at 273.65
problem is ADBE keeps going lower and lower everydayBig institutions keep dumping ADBE

We will be at 430 by the time they finish with the conference call!
Adobe to DOUBLE in next 24 months! Amazing company!
The best of the breed in CLOUD!!!!! Earnings will be way above estimates as well as guidance!!!
HAHAHHA HAHAHAH
Please not the “not no mo” curse. I’m selling
I remember when this traded for $5 or $1.90
ADBE==NOW==CRM==old software stocks==sell!
Why doesn't ADOBE split like Apple and Tesla?
Who sold at $438 ?
this cant be real????? why the huge crash ?????? daily ?????
ADBE will likely move up to $130 and settle there before a pull back to $120. Adobe is a very good company and those hoping to trade down to get below $110 could end up very sorry.
ADBE flexing...showing just how much of a powerhouse they really are. A great quarter with a very positive outlook!
"All the software stocks got slaughtered this week....based on some manipulation and BS downgrades. Hopefully, they start loading now at 10% discount and we fly next week."
"ADBE broke below the support, it could go all the way down to $350-$375."
Probably not much to expect here until the start of a new tax year.
Everyone I know is running a cracked version of Creative Cloud.

"Adobe on mad money, saying great things"
Approaching day low before earning at 405pm. I wouldn’t buy here
Some time ago sold some $ADBE at $501 and bought $AMC at $5.60 and $7.20. It is close to 11 now. It is equivalent to $ADBE at $900. Think about it.
ADBE AT 340 BY FRIDAY.
Might tank to $260 today if CC is so so
I bought some VIX calls. I see bad things happening soon. I'm shopping for more puts then calls at this point.
what prob adobe facing now..the stock cannot move even market is green
"It will gap much higher than 177 at the open, Darius, you're toast."
"WOW! I missed this, Adobe revenues accelerated Q/Q! 25% up from 23%, Awesome!"
I hope every long is enjoying the ADBE ride!!!
No matter the earning this puppy has been pumped up waaaaay too too fast.
"Long 190 shares of ADBE at $305.80. This is an Earnings play, I am expecting a very good earnings report, to be followed by a nice move up in stock price. Looking to make back all the $ I lost on LULE, and more, and start a new winning streak. In just a few minutes, we should have an idea whether or not this play is very smart, or incredibly stupid. I hope it is the former! Best of luck to all..."
it'll break through.. higher highs
In October Adobe and Gopro entered a collaboration. Any new news about that?
"tanking as I said it would. don't believe me then go back and read. now read this. dump this pig, it ain't worth $450 or $400. listeners will be thanking me"
ADBE reached a new All Time High at 248.39
If there was gonna be a big drop today it would've happened by now. Steady climb up continues.
"Beat and Raise, my two favorite words"
ADBE down 7% over the past month. Not related to their financial performance but the political environment. Going to hold for the long term. Got to get the uncertainty behind us.
530 tomorrow and 600 by year end. This is the stock with very good fundamentals and business models. #growth stocks.
because of netflix perhaps..
Was short into earnings will double down tomorrow possibly triple down short. This stock is a pig at this price. Will make the very very very bearish death cross tomorrow or Monday.
Adobe upgrade spam has gotten so bad it made it onto the Bill Maher show.Do we really need weekly upgrades?
ADBE is down 7.87% to 290.41
ADBE stock is rocking today!!!
ADBE continues to get killed. Doesn't deserve it and will turn around.
Will be good earning and outlook after market close today. Just buy 500 share at $258.Easy money.
That's not great Guidance.
"Adobe will Mint, money in Q4, as their marketing business Destroys numbers! Their digital, marketing, platforms are going to reveal just how valuable Adobe has become, going to be Epic! Could easily hit $500 in early 2020!"
estimates say they will beat at earnings!
"We will go down 10-12% very short term (2 wks??)... then BUY!! Stock price runs like clockwork, and everyone profits. ROI, YoY is 50-75%, and we can sleep at nite. No worries here, whatsoever. I can retire 5 yrs early, and I am grateful!"
Yeah bahaha hahaha!!!!!!!!!!
Go back and view the last earnings forecast till now and you will see why ADBE is the best!!!
looks like it hit resistance and is now gonna test its support and then maybe consolidate for a week or two or maybe till earnings is my educated guess
225.90 +7.03 (3.21%)After hours: 4:23PM EDT
200 on cards before Q1 results. With a growth rate 25% this is cool stock to own
I sold all today at 475 and took short position
this thing will fall....like a brick.....an adobe brick......suckers
$500.00Tomorrow Guidelines is fantastic
"The 25 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Adobe have a median target of 120.00, with a high estimate of 134.00"
Why the big AH drop just now
"Adobe 510, really? This bubble is gonna burst."
"Unsure about ADBE. Thinking it might drop, but don't want to miss earnings. Any thoughts?"
What's up - not the stock price?
Gosh... Adobe is moving slower than some mutual funds... right now it’s being traded by day traders... the 1 and 5 minutes charts are so predictable...I hope these day traders get burned once Adobe gains momentum again
bought at 38 time to sell
RIP Chuck. An awesome person and a great leader.
ADBE==strong sell garbage stock!

Market is overreacting before hearing the call. They need to quit comparing this to a startup. This revenue amount is huge. Up up soon
"I know I shouldn’t be concerned with day-to-day movement, but really.. 2 days ago adobe raised its earnings estimate, and now it’s below where it was beforehand? Makes sense..."

"Just two weeks ago, an analyst with a 94% accuracy rating gave ADBE a price target of $550 and a Buy rating. ""Stifel analyst Tom Roderick reiterated a Buy rating and $550.00 price target on Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) after the company announced an agreement to acquire Workfront for $1.5bn."""

@the missed. They guided lower for q1 and full year... it will get killed tomorrow. I’m short. But just stating the facts
Why is this down now after an earnings beat?
Growth earnings and good guidance. The use of adobe is satisfying and many options. No one compares to Adobe.
ADBE is down 4.93% to 257.54
"Sell ADBE, buy FDX why?1. FDX has same rev growth as ADBE, with gar superior EPS growth;2. Valuation of ADBE is nearly two times of FDX,3. So what what measures do you want to use???ADBE target $385--downside 20% while FDX target $350 upside 40%!"
"Am I wrong for believing this is about as nice and safe a place to hold your money going into a weekend when we're on the brink of a trade war. I mean, seriously, discounted shares of ADBE the day after a positive earnings report and a week before a sweet acquisition! How lucky are we?! Buying in and starting the weekend early, folks! Have a nice weekend, all!"
Zoom.... $528.49 with 9.10% increase in one single day!!! PT $650.00 by end of year.

Going up within one hour
Adobe is down 4.95% to 467.61
ADBE EARNINGS DATE=(((( 09/18/18 ))))). On a Tuesday after the close.
Guidance is weak. This will be down tomorrow.
This is worth watching if you're thinking about investing in Adobe.
ADBE raised their prices recently. Should be reflected in next earnings.
buy the dip they said hahahhahhahaa
"Adobe achieved record quarterly revenue of $3.91 billion in its first quarter of fiscal year 2021, which represents 26 percent year-over-year growth. Diluted earnings per share was $2.61 on a GAAP basis, representing 33 percent year-over-year growth, and $3.14 on a non-GAAP basis, representing 38 percent year-over-year growth."
picked up 40 more shares today at 190. total of 100 share now this stock rocks!
Monster growth continues. Cheers!
Who here believes Adobe could buy DocuSign in 2020?
Best move I made today was to sell my ADBE at $297 to buy A LOT of CGC @ $39.90. I hope that continues to provide comfort.
"this stock rocks, buy some more before we hit 150."
Any company with good growth and a good management team in place is a buy and hold.
And 200 here we come!

Covered my short with some loss. Looks like this will close green today.
Everybody should took a look To Intel stock price. Their maximum from 1999 was never touch again. This is going to happen with Adobe. They reached the. Maximum level on 270. Beside Photoshop all other Adobe products has real competitors!
Told you they would push it down to give the options trader relief. Wall Street is THE ultimate scam if you’re on the right side (that being the dark side).
"Everyone relax, it doesn’t matter if they come out tonight or tomorrow morning... it doesn’t change the results, and either way markets are closed!"
Added today. I think we go higher after earnings.
I should have bought more at 220.

Adobe quarterly results beat estimates
"“The stock market is a device for transferring funds from the impatient to the patient.” - W. BuffetI find it really funny.. read this news headline:""...But Adobe disappointed with its earnings outlook because of foreign exchange headwinds and costs related to its acquisitions of Magento and Marketo.""For its fiscal first quarter, Adobe expects to earn an adjusted $1.60 a share on sales of $2.54 billion. Wall Street was modeling $1.88 earnings per share on sales of $2.52 billion in the February-ending quarter. For fiscal 2019, Adobe expects adjusted earnings of $7.75 a share on sales of $11.15 billion. Wall Street was looking for Adobe earnings of $7.98 a share on revenue of $10.8 billion.""So the company (which has always been conservative in its forecast is beating the most aggressive predictions of wall street in terms of revenue growth and short of earnings in the short term due to acquisitions is beaing beaten down because of:Those who are selling now will come back and pay higher price again to buy back their shares. This is inevitable. And if they can make up the difference in between with something else, then more power to them..."

All aboard.

"Earnings has nothing to do with market reaction , even if it gives an extra ordinary results it still goes down , that’s how the market is now a days . Better sell all your stocks and keep cash until market gets stabilized .."
Glad I held on through the drought. One of my larger positions but feeling good now!
Hard to believe this stock was trading at a P/E of around 15 back in 2012. Funds have really piled onto tech stocks and have driven up the valuations to absurd levels now. JMTC.
It may fall on earnings. 200 level?
relax and give it more than just a few minutes you imbeciles
"The governors forcing people to lose their jobs, collect unemployment and stay home is Driving Tech. Software firms will still double from here."
"flat base has been forming for over 6 months between 450 and 500. when it breaks it will really run! Such a tight range for so long shows the big boys buy this up and are just playing us all until they let it run! dont give them your shares that easy, this is gonna run, just give it time, They like Amzn Aapl NFLX Good are cash cows, and cash earning machines! when people are done be distracted by the GME and AMC of the news, they will buy these leaders!"
"Sometimes a really great company's stock gets to such high valuations (rightfully in this case IMO), that it needs a good flush to clear out the weak and allow those who were fearful before a chance to enter without going in at the all time high. Today is one such day. It's healthy for a stock and I'm a believer. Took the opportunity to add to my position. Im looking for 500 this year. Move over MSFT!"
"Actually, I think it will rise to $480 or more tomorrow."
After hours we might hear stock splits:) we might hit $600 after hours
Adobe reached an all time high at 402.10

"Adobe managements are being cute. Their Ecommerce platform ""Magento"" just can't compete with Shopify. Don't they know Wallstreet is pumping Ecommerce at all cost?. Rebrand ""Magento"" into Adobe ""Shop!"" or whatever catchy phrase, and make iteasier to use than Shopify. Adobe stock will fly. If not, Adobe, the dinosaur is a lousy sell."
this #$%$ stock is nuts
Adobe is so overpriced it's a joke. Total joke. When Biden gets elected it's so crashing... lol. You're crazy having this at $500. You're crazy having it at $400. It's not worth $261 billion. People have lost their minds on true values. Mark my word you'll wish you listened.
Wow this price is a screaming buy.

This is going to tank at 4:15pm

"ADBE will have a great week through their earnings report on Thursday, and through the month of June 2020!!! GO ADBE GO!!!"
"Well, after good earnings, DROP.......WHY?"
"I was hoping to see ADBE drop back down to ~$155 today, but this market is so bullish these days I dont know if it'll find it's way back under $157."
Long ADBE STRONG AND UNDERVALUED COMPANY!
big bubble. adobe software are available for free!!!
EPS was impacted by the financial costs associated with the acquisition of Marketo.All other Q4 annual targets were met or exceeded.
"ADBE bulls are doing a good job protecting this level from breaking down. They will fail sooner or later though. We're in a bear market, and there is a mad king running the show."
"Adobe was up previously is because it is a profit machine with a locked-in market and no serious competition. It doesn't drop in a pandemic because work-at-home people use it. I'm holding what I've got and buying more. Any ""election effect"" on this stock is wrong, since the business isn't affected by red/left politics."

ADBE==dead money!
What a trashy company! Nasdaq is up 170 points and this garbage us only $2 up!!
"I never liked ADBE before, so do I now!"
Does this happen before every earnings call like Apple and MSFT? Drop in price or profit taking?
Just released earnings on their website. Record revenue. Record earnings $2.81/share profit.
all softway stocks are garbage: ADBE/NOW/...
"Anytime IBD touts it, sell it; since market knows a firm's fundamentals well before the information processors like IBD consisting of bunch of writers who are collectively not good as J Cramer!"
"Just 1 more reason why it's suicide to short ADBE for the long haul...its margins are amazing. 87.45 percent gross margins, 32.43% EBITDA margin, 26.83 percent operating margin, 40.9 percent net margin, 42 percent free cash flow margin. This company is a money making machine."
"Great move by Adobe, buying Workfront! Hopefully, Adobe continues to us their capital on buying more of these cloud startups! Great move, congrats!"
Don’t believe the Conspiracy nuts. Just follow the Fed.
Why this is forcing yellow in the pantz? Lol
Wha happened? Timbrrrr?
"So, yeah. I expected to get some of it back today.. What I did not expect was that we would get ALL OF IT BACK in one session. Unbelievable day for ADBE. Who amongst us is not a believer at this point? The Cloud King will be taking new territory soon."
"ya well some short some long we can agree on this either eay its gonna make a big move. Weather thst be to the upside or down. rhe suport and resistance arent to far off in either direction. if we beat we should be able to blow through the resistance, if we miss theres a lot of support at 238 i doubt we'll fall lower but its possible. im betting on the beat blowing through resistance at 251.50 ..either way glta"
no chatter for a week? EARNINGS TODAY PEOPLE
"Nice results recently for Bridgeline Digital (BLIN), a stock I own. Bridgeline revenues rose 14%, Subscription and perpetual license revenue increased 17.3%, Services revenue up 15.2% in fourth fiscal Q. EBITDA was up for the year. “Our financial improvements derive not only from stronger customer acquisition but also from expansion within our existing customer base” Said Ari Kahn, Bridgeline’s CEO.I think this software company trading at Price/Sales =0.65 is worth consideration."
Near term target for the day and swing traders: 421.00
Good entry point @ 429.50
crazyness at peaks. volatility of stocks gives jolt to faint hearted on earnings day.
"Adobe is a crowded trade, I know the company will continue with increased revenue they a very good product many designers use, professional to amateur. But adobe is very overvalued, I am willing to sit this out it could easily go to 200, but it could just as well in a correction which will happen return to 90 and then move up from there. As well ADBE as their earnings increase need to provide a dividend."
ADBE is down 4.90% to $239.42
My apologies for the -10% drop.....it a mistake and just -2 or -3% drop.....no harm done to sell.....you can buy back at opening cheaper tomorrow
"Pre market looks good, but I will be surprised if it closes over $180.00. I am going to say a $178.00 close with a move over $180 by the end of the year."

when is adobe going to start paying dividends?
"Picked up a 120 $490 calls last week super cheap, fixing to start raking in that cash. Next stop $500."
"I don't see value in this bubble, so will go short here"
Don't be scared of the RED it'll go GREEN after the call.
"This has been going on all year in the market, Washington has created uncertainty and managers are trying to maintain there numbers or get fired. The stock has been on a tear for a year traders are taking profits off the top, ADBE will hold @ $248 for a few weeks then run to $270."
Looks like over $480 after earnings
It is strange this stock closed at 287 and change with the price stalling alittle bit. Naturally it should go noplace. Yet suddenly it is catapulted--and I mean blasted to 291.33 for no apparent reason. Total manipulation.

"ADBE not being hit hard enough right now for me to addThis is like a bad down market day for ADBE6% down , I would think of adding, but not down 3% ...yawn ...."

Does anyone know what time frame are analysts referring to.....for upping the shr price target? (ie. analysts at Stifel upped their price target to $210) Is this supposed to happen by the next earnings announcement?
cancelled Muse without any notice. Stranding thousands of developers that have devoloped client websites on this platform for years. I'm guessing they lose a lot of business with this move. The forums are going crazy with po'd subscription members!

What a wild range $270-$280. How do those who sold at $270 feel now...?!
Who even competes with ADBE? Rare to have dips to buy on this one.
"5 firms have upgraded Adobe today..Stifel, Credit Suisse, Citigroup, Keybanc and BMO capital"
If you don't sell you will regret.....whoever sell will thk me.....earning report is very bad.....projected -10%......and over.....
"ADOBE Earnings --Digital media and marketing software maker Adobe (ADBE) late Tuesday beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal third quarter. The Adobe earnings news sent ADBE stock higher in extended trading.The San Jose, Calif.-based company earned an adjusted $2.57 a share on sales of $3.23 billion in the quarter ended Aug. 28. Analysts expected Adobe earnings of $2.41 a share on sales of $3.16 billion.

In three days market up more than 4% while ADBE up only 2%==a market laggard! Sell this garbage!
Why is after hours up

huge upgrade will be after con call .....this should fly
"ADBE's market cap is 82% institutional. Not sure why it pulled back today, but it might be a general market nervousness since there was no news about Adobe. I imagine we'll be back at $500 this week. Maybe even tomorrow."
What the hell!! Why Adobe doing this to us again!
$ADBE https://youtu.be/gTdPG7VhC4EHere is the link for earnings call live

"Adobe could easily create there own NFT, digital art platform and have a Monopoly!"
The bounce back will be awesome. Funds and private investors will be loading up. We're on our way to $295.00!!!
Wow nose dive after the earning?
I see Adobe as a 10-bagger over the next 10-20 years
The earnings party is over.
"Earnings a parade of horribles, the earnings call a disaster this is a strong SELL"
Earnings Thursday after the close. Expected above $270.00. New price targets revised above $300.00.
What a garbage company! Nasdaq is above 100 points and this garbage is in red!
"I definitely will hold this for the regular session tomorrow. The report was very good, the company is gold standard for its sector, and I think there will be lots of eager buyers tomorrow, driving the price up throughout the day... :-)"
"To sell adbe rightaway, take the profit,don,t too greedy anymore."
I’m a new investor to Adobe 
wow great eps and projects. and its down. smh
What a garbage stock. A do nothing supposed ‘winner’. Whatever. I’m done running in place.
Ready to run. Strong.
I am finding it strange that this company is not up. The balance sheet is GREAT. The debt is very low for investors and margins aren't bad.
Why is adobe not participating in this rally today but moving opposite
The stock has outrun the pre-pandemic level of 390's. Is this dropping because of the vaccine news? Does ADBE has an inverse relationship with vaccine arrival?Trying to figure out if this is going to further crash? Any thought?

After IBM's dopey purchase of RHT i cant help but wonder if someone will make a play for ADBE. If IBM can pay 70$ premium for RHT im sure ADBE will get much more.
ADBE is down 4.91% to 270.70
What happened ......going down straight
Tomorrow will be a nightmare. You shall see. Sentiment is collapsing
"anything cause the downturn, over sale?"
"these SOB's cost me a bunch of money last month, because of some moron from the company misspoke, went down sept 20 or around there from 165 to 155 overnight, i had 165 calls oct, sold 10 contracts to cut losses, the dumb #$%$ apologized for his error, he must be a liberal dip wad"
hmm may be tommorow . should be out by now . The call is at tommorow 8 though
Give me one reason not to own this great company. I think whoever is selling this at this price should be fired.
Where ever this swoon goes that's when you buy look at the analysts rating look at the revenue and earnings picture. This has $300 by year end all over it. See if you can get in at $240
"Can Adobe Magento do what Shopify can? If not, then why? No one seem to know Magento, Adobe must be extremely stupidnot naming it Adobe ""Shop!"". The first time I heard Shopify, I know what it is right away, ""shop online"". The first time I heard ""Magento"" I thought it was just a color app. Nothing more. A name with no common sense, It is doomed to fail getting any notice! even if Adobe spends 20 millions or more advertising it , it will fail to catch on. Look like Adobe will be eaten alive by Shopify."

"Good time to buy, will be 145 by next week"
Is this for real or are we talking about year 2000 when the ballon popped?
Cramer has mentioned Adobe along with Salesforce several times already on show tonight as two stocks that will be climbing this week. He's not wrong.
ADBE=trash! stay away from this lagard software stocks: MSFT is leader!
Love these profit margins. Will be adding this like a 401K every month.

"ADBE a $500 dollar stock in 12 months! EARNIGS are AMAZING! 30% growth in subs! INSANE GROWTH! If ADOBE contimues to hit 30% on Subscription Revenue, that creates another 576 million a quarter in Revenue that recurring and another 520 million in cash flow that goes to building an unstoppable monster! Thanks to those idiotic tax cuts almost all the money drops to the bottom line ADBE should fly past 10 dollars in earnings in 12 months! The businesses that Adobe have invested in have a high probability of exceeding the 29.6% growth rate achieved this quarter! These guys running ADOBE are GENIUS!"
if its a beat earning...why down? i'm lost
Sell!!!!
this is a short at 270. u wanna sell before earrning. this stock too expensive
"This is what TruthFinder posted yesterday. It JUST happened. How many here fell for the headfake?""F you happened to miss the awesome rally in ADBE recently - don't regret it too much. If history repeats itself, the hedge fund machinators will very likely force a sharp downward headfake after earnings are released tomorrow, in order to scoop up as many shares as possible prior to a massive rally bringing the stock up somewhere near 450 and higher in the following 5 trading days."""
500s coming
Almost time to buy. Once it hits 255-257 range look for the rebound back up
My 252.21 trade is looking very good. Lucky for once.

"What a great company, I remember buying Adobe at $10 a share in 2002, a marketcap at the time of 5 billion, today Adobe just paid 5 billion in cash for Marketo. I never could have imagined in 2002 what opportunities and new business Adobe would be competing in 2018. Marketo and Magento are two companies I would have invested in if they went public, but by owning Adobe stock. did not need to. Own shares of HUBS and Shopify that compete with Marketo and Magento, just love what Adobe is doing with cash flow in investing into these HUGE addressable markets, digital marketing and ecommerce cloud platforms. Adobe has a vision of the future a plan to get there. Congrats on your new Acquisitions"

They missed!!!!!
ADBE has no enhancements; not really innovative. They need to step up for the stock to move higher. What a boring organization
glad I bought on Joe Terranova's sell reported on CNBC last week. This guy is a terrific contrary indicator!
Sell it for a while.
Absolutely CRAZY selling after hours. You need to appreciate a company by not selling. This stock should do well.
Double topOn chart
really glad I added to my position at 250 on Friday. anyone think we'll be seeing 260 by end of week?
shorting the minute the market opens tomorrow
insider selling tons of share.. especially the CEO!!
Patience. You're holding a 200 stock
just a complete non event earnings
Muted Ganlin. Sick of having to read his garbage posts on the ADBE board. He’s said the same thing about other companies that are gold. It takes garbage knowledge to say companies like ADBE are garbage. He probably lives in mommy and daddy’s basement with his teddy bear as his only friend in the world. Sad.

"For how long will the US Government continue to PUMP the US Stock Prices artificially? Everyone knows that the US Market is in the MEGA BUBBLE; it is even more overvalued than Tulip Mania Bubble! The US Stocks are INSANELY OVERVALUED and OVERBOUGHT!

Now there are 100,000s of companies worldwide competing for $1 revenue! The US Companies that barely generate revenue of $1-2 million are trading at $50-60 Billion Market values, while in Asia, the same companies with better fundamentals, 100 times more revenues, are trading at 99% less market value! The US Company valuations DO NOT MAKE Sense at all! Why would one invest in US Stock Tulip Mania while he/she can buy the 1000 times better company share for a 99% cheaper price? The US Stock Market is a MAJOR PONZI SCHEME designed to patch fraudulent pension systems in the US temporarily! There is NO PROPER Revenue Collection by the IRS since 2016. Taxes are extremely Low, and Nobody is paying custom duties! People want more free money without working, more free checks, more capital gains, more stock hypes every day! This fraudulent ""no need to work"" policy of the US Government will END TERRIBLY very soon! Inflation is skyrocketing, but the Government is lying about inflation! $AMD $NVDA $AMZN $AAPL $SQ $SHOP $SNAP $TWLO $CRM $ROKU $ADBE $DB $BAC $JPM $MS $GS $TWTR $TSLA $IBM $INTC $MSFT $GOOG $LMT $BA $TXN $NXPI $LRCX $NKE $DIS $EBAY $X $MA $V $S $T $F $GM $NFLX $CSCO $CAT $MMM $SBUX $TGT $WMT $ATVI $EA $TTWO $MCD $AVGO $JNJ $BIDU $BZUN $BABA $MU $AMAT $QCOM $WFC $BBBY $PFE $GE $WDC $BLK $KO $UA $ABBV $GILD $BB $ORCL $RH $KEM $IQ $GRPN $PYPL $MA $MOMO $JD $WBA $CVS $FB $W $BBY $SKX $FL $EFX $ETSY $W $UNH $SAP $GPRO $KHC $DPZ $PEP $LYFT $UBER $BYND $ZM $OLED $XOM $CVX $DAL $UAL $AAL $LUV $SAVE $AXP $SPCE $NCLH $CCL $NKLA $NIO $ZM $XPEV $QS"

Earnings on December 9 will be excellent. We will be heading back over $500.
Good opportunity to start a position on a great software company
I think tomorrow adbe will go up $20
i'me afraid i missed a good opp to get back in this when it had fallen back to the 440's; bummer;
People looking for a quick buck buy in just before earnings expecting a jump. The jump doesn't come to the level they expect so they sell off. Stock then resumes its growth pattern and goes up from there. I'm an adbe long. I own their products. I use their products everyday. I believe in their products and love them. Photography. Pdfs. Creative cloud. In the photo world they have brand recognition. You say put on a band aid when you get hurt. You say Photoshop that when you need something done with photos.
ADBE is the last great tech stock left standing. The chart looks like it is about to roll over. Lower lows and lower highs.
sell any strength!Target $250==ADBE==ORCL!
You never know ~ but i have been doing this for 22 years. I would say the chances of a rally here are over 90%. good luck ADBE longs.
"Now, it's getting interesting. A couple more % points down, and I am going to add to my ADBE position"
Adobe is down 14.91% to 285.48
ADBE: Strong monthly job report. Market will up 500 pts in the endBUY the pull back may see 255 close
what the #$%$ this stock is nutsss
"As far as stocks that might actually benefit during a coronavirus pandemic environment, excepting the medically related, the stay at home / work from home flavor of stocks as far as my research goes are THE best candidates for long term benefit as people and corporations around the world who become aware of working collaboratively over the cloud will ultimately acclimate to the new virtual reality and adopt these platforms long term. My #1 candidate as witnessed here, is ADBE, followed closely by ZM and of course TDOC. Best wishes to all!"
who wants to make a bet stock will be down tomorrow at the close?
"Wait... wait... wait... till $235, then start buying as much as you can. Even borrow a little money, if possible. You are going to get a +90% return on your money in a year... count on it. You're welcome and Happy Fathers Day!"
Earnings could take us to $520 per share.
"I'm still digesting this report... Starting with Q4 of last year Adobe's earnings significantly improved to the tune of $1 Billion per quarter. You can see this in the small chart on the Yahoo Summary tab.Adobe continues to grow revenue, but the change in earnings is big change. Somehow Adobe has reduced costs significantly, and this savings extended from Q4 of 2020 to Q1 of 2021. Will this continue?Given the positive guidance for 2021, it looks as though it might. At least, it seems credible that their forward guidance is at least accurate.I'd be interested in learning what they did to reduce costs $1 Billion per quarter and if this will be sustained. If this is because they furlowed employees due to Covid, then we might presume that these costs will return for the rest of the year as they bring people back on board. Since they are still growing revenue, I imagine that earnings and revenue for 2021 will still be better than 2020, but we might see a downtrend in earnings after Q1 as these costs return. Just trying to manage my expectations."
ADBE shorts are going to get crushed after earnings. Shorting this stock in general is beyond stupid.
why the sudden hike up to 103 plus? Is it flying high on the Cloud theme just like MSFT yesterday? Gabe
What a dud
"Guess this company is too ""boring"" right now like Microsoft When fundamentals start to matter again, EV stocks, e-commerce stocks, fintech stocks, clean energy stocks will correct, and money will flow back in stocks like Adobe and Microsoft"
ADBE still getting hammered again today. Big traders are taking money off the table to go after others in spite of the great quarter and strong projections. This is a hold or a buy though given eventually it will get the recognition it deserves in its stock price.
ADBE is down 7.45% to 311.68
Need to think about mental capability of us if we are buying Doordash airbnb at 150+ and not buying profitable strong companies like ADBE .
Is ADBE's earnings today after market or tomorrow? Yahoo Finance says today but Google Search says tomorrow??
Bright days ahead for this stock. Adobe truly is the leader in this sector and they will gain their momentum back. I have a friend who is very reliable and they will produce record earnings this qtr.
"Sell before earnings, ADBE has run up as it always does, and it will tank. Buy tomorrow at $250"
Just shorted 300 shares at $337.75....... will short 300 more if it goes to $400...... this is wayyyy overbought!!
This is so secure tonight to beat - it’s simple gains 2.30 tomorrow
Today's target 407.00Friday's target 450.00(my numbers)

Go up 20% tomorrow?

Whenever someone asks me what Trump's heritage is I answer - PIG!https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-rape-case_us_581a31a5e4b0c43e6c1d9834
As more people return to the office upon economic reopening ADBE should resume its upward trend. Very bullish on this name for the long haul. I feel that long term ADBE will leave the 400s and 500s in the dust. There is no bear case on this name. This company has a solid moat and will start to be rotated back into soon. I feel compared to where it will trade in a few years that this stock is at a discount.
I guess ADBE didn't get the call that the whole market is correcting again - it's got too much earnings stuffed in its ears.
Look at ADBE rally!!! GO ADBE GO!!!
$520 tomorrow?
"I think a lot of tech companies need to prepare for the possibility that talent may not want to come here if Trump is reelected. His relentless attacks on immigrants to satisfy his base is changing the way the US is perceived - I think there's a good chance that talented people from foreign countries will not see the US as a welcoming destination. I hope ADBE and MSFT and GOOG, etc. start working on expanding or setting up shop in places where the talent wants to be. Western Europe and Asia could be big beneficiaries."
why is ADBE crashing after hours?
its going to be 477 by July 2019.
Retest of lows In march coming
"Near recent resistance, uptick on low volume, easy short! See you guys at the bottom, cheers!"
GO GO GO ADOBE!!! UP!
Price drops to $170.23 after market. Someone is selling a huge piece of this stock
Let’s go rebound
Is this a good price to buy in?
no wonder tech stocks has been flying lol. because tariff imposed..
"Most software stocks up nicely today: why ADBE drops? MDB/OKTA/TDOC,..all up!ADBE really laggard caused by moronic index fund managers!"
employees are gonna sell their shares from the ESPP - this will affect the price
Why is yahoo Finance so bad with dates? Posting the wrong days for earnings reports and dividend payments is very common on here.
For those of you who have been in ADBE for several earnings; does this usually pop afterwards? I see minor dips on the last two; is the way it usually goes?Thanks!
"Comparatively, downturn risks to ADBE share price today, is de minmus. Return potential high. AH traders can yuq a donkey."
fly baby
They overpaid. It was sold in august 2017 for 1.79B. Marketo is expected to only generate 400m revenue in 2018. 12.5 times revenue is insane.
ADBE will rock into their quarterly earnings next Thursday!!! GO ADBE GO!!!
What is a pandenic? Is it an Adbe Stock pumping Festival of light
Bought at 451 waiting for the next tech bull run!
"but nobody will be selling shares at $260, or even $310, bcz it will open above that tomorrow, ratface. earnings beats, call in a half hour, why don't you listen in?"
"Great, lets go back into 500+. Got myself in at 476 but got a bit scared wit the premarket crash. Now Im bullish again and I'll hold!"

Broke 180Let push ADBE to 190 today
$ADBE$ADHD
Imagine that. Has earning and decent outlook. This market sell off was unjustified. Period.
so called everybody analysts.... keep on sending hurray articles for company example adbe kmx only after the whole action was done. then slack someone out of unknown world comes and says it's 25% downward.. if value is all that matters then I thin all companies will go 50% down or more.. who declares them analysts.
http://alph.st/bf74f376 ADBE dropped 4% after it reported third quarter earnings on September 19. What is expected out of Adobe's fourth quarter earnings on December 14th?
"295 is the top band, should they run it up there I will drop 100k on shorting this without blinking. Funny how media is twisting Powells words saying ""Rally on possible rate cuts"" Powell said clear as day NO CUTS in 2019 and won't look at them again until 2020..."
Is going below 200
Accounting manipulation.

This is beyond my apprehension with such ER this only clicks 12 points in AH / PM . I just hope that it will gain some intraday.
They keep bidding up the junk stocks and this one gets hit. I added today. This will double in 2022.-23! Love getting quality on sale.
looks like quarter profit taking is keeping this down.
ADBE is laggard without compelling moat!Stay away from it at any strength!
nice
Down 1%? EARNINGS OUT NEXT WEEK(what did you think? they're just going to give you free money without a little sweat?)Covid19 has ensured that this stock will break out to all time highs over and over again during the next quarter. Mark this post!

Cramer’s favorite stock you shouldn’t bet against him
Net profit up from $268 million to 1.68 BILLION from 2014-2017. No way im selling this bad boy. Still undervauled IMO
Clearly wants to go to $500 in the near to intermediate term.
Easy 10% down tomorrow.
ADBE crashed Friday for the expensive buyout of Marketo and as suspected was amplified buy options end date for September so now we go up from here on a rebound
Buy ADOBE b4 Sep.4
company changes name from ADOBE to ADUMBO to match bagholders in this garbage
Given ADBE’s moat I would say even at these levels the company is still undervalued. Patience is key The returns are well worth the wait.
"Awww but I thought this company reinvents the world every day? The P/E should be at least 10,000"
What goes up come down
ADBE 350 in 2 weeks.
What the F?? YOu have a great rebound day yesterday and then you give it all back today? No excuses for this
"so much hype, this market will crash so hard if earnings aren't great :("

"Here is something to consider...no rate cuts considered until 2020 FACT no matter how much CNN and others try to twist what Powell said...you must ask? Why twist truths other than to drive prices higher before dumping? Note, today the volume was FOUR TIMES that of the 10 day average. Do you really think you're going to see that heavy of volume to keep this up? Profit taking and shorting will drive this back down fast and hard. Don't be a sucker retailer caught chasing."

Abort mission
Any quick drop in ADBE recovers very quickly with in 2-3 days... This could happen again next week. Possible 155 by mid to late next week...
"IF you happened to miss the awesome rally in ADBE recently - don't regret it too much. If history repeats itself, the hedge fund machinators will very likely force a sharp downward headfake after earnings are released tomorrow, in order to scoop up as many shares as possible prior to a massive rally bringing the stock up somewhere near 450 and higher in the following 5 trading days."
really wish I'd bought more 2 weeks ago

"Gonna be green next week, upward trend towards 500 range, also Colorado pension just ditched shares in square etc and bought a ton of adobe."
There is no news that adbe will do their earnings tomorrow! So I guess it will be done today

"Shorts working hard here to cover their losses tomorrow, good luck guys but no use"
"i would’ve assumed that our pullback was due to a small number of shares trading hands, but we’re still reaching average volume pretty often "
this is a solid stock
ADBE repurchased shares because their managements are greedy and want to sell their shares at high price. Pls. be aware.
ADBE WILL ROCK AFTER RELEASING THEIR EARNINGS (AFTER HOURS TODAY)!!! GO ADBE GO!!!
"MM are driving up prices to shoet there was no rate cut,this will crash,but first they want to milk this run"

"I am probably longer on this stock than anyone else on this board. I bought at single digits, when earnings were reported in millions and not billions. At that time, cost were a mere fraction of revenues and we receives a small but fair dividend. In 2005 they gave us a 2 for 1 split and ceased the dividend. I was not unhappy because this was supposed to offer greater growth and benefit to us. After years and years of up and down and frustration, it did in deed take off. My only concern is that I am now in retirement and all I hear about this companies operations is how well they treat their employees. Free health care, child care, cafeterias, workout rooms, sponsored vacations, time off for pregnancies and after delivery, newer and more expensive buildings, free free free. When it was announced that they would receive around 600 million in offshore income at lower tax rates, the CEO said that a lot of that would go to the share holders, either in a dividend or a stock buy back. A mere 8 million allocated to SBB, #$%$. I believe that the stock holders should demand a dividend, equivalent to the same percentage of all paid benefits to average earnings of all non exec employees. I also don't understand the soon to be billion dollars a year in R and D when almost all of their advances are from purchasing other concerns. I am still not unhappy with Adobe, it bought my retirement home, but I feel it is time they start thinking about their shareholders, as well as their employees."
"Bought December 15th, 170 call option on this pull back. This horse goes higher long term."
"ADBE appears to be one of the safer bets in a Tech rebound, which is what we’re about to see."
Whole system one big joke. Blame fed with stupid rate cuts once again. Screw savers to try to push them into stock markets again. 2008 era all over again. Corruption period.

Founder is resigning from board - retired long ago. VERY SUCCESSFULLY HAND PICKED CEO and MGT quite capable of continuing the show - was they have been for past few years and 100% revenue and price appreciation. No worries - steady as she goes.
Cramer previews Wall Street news for the trading week of Sept. 14.He sayed adobe and fedex will have a blowout in earnings and a great upside potential this week. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhfTB0aGsT0 Go see!! Sky soon!!
"hopefully this is a shake out, but its now in a clear downtrend for the last 6 months"
What a disaster. Even Cramer was saying ADBE would have a blow-out quarter. I guess it is not enough. There are different degrees of blow-out. This is not one of them. I think the market is moving into a very tight place.Even good earnings are not enough.
not even 5% up
"stupid decision , i wil never buy this again"
Love this stock. Great steady growth
SELL NOTHING TODAY MY FRIENDS
@satnam speak with greater confidence when the earnings report is ACTUALLY OUT
Adobe CEO is on Mad Money in a few minutes. Expecting a bump with that and then people trying to buy in at a value buy tomorrow
What a scam job. Pat on the back to the option trader who got shareholders to back his position.
if the price breaks below 464 I'll wait till the 200 day MA to add more though
earning is before or after market?

U should be selling every fakePop
this stock always goes up in a good market but it is choppy
Raised guidance and flat? I'm adding
Be prepare for a boost after major announcements in next week Max conference. Right time to buy for short term gains as well.
"I am thinking that perhaps it is time for ADBE to start paying a dividend. The company is grown up now, good acquisitions come at a heavy price so stay away from bidding wars. Time to start spreading the wealth back to the stockholders. Paying a dividend would also attract more investors and contribute to a stabilization of the share price."
It red who did not listen to sell before the earning report
GO ADBE GO!!! THE BULLS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
Sell Short
"JD, the $350-355 mark is a mere 7-8% and within the next couple weeks, that’s where the 50DMA will be. I expect the overall market to pull back 5% as the Nasdaq is overbought at an RSI of 72 as well as the S&P. ADBE would surely come back to that area in this scenario. When Microsoft got to $191 the other day with an RSI of 80, it pulled back to $181xx for a quick 5% retreat because it was overbought. You don’t think this is t going to happen to ADBE sooner than later? I don’t care what stock it is, when the RSI is at 80 it’s extremely overbought."

Head and shoulders top in ADBE lately.
I don't like ADBE: an old stock!
We are down bcuz of that option trader! Tomorrow every thing will be back normal and the stock will be $500+
Back to $200 this is over-extended.
Technical dip this is a bullish sign
"Dominant market share, xlnt mngt, drama free, a little pricey, picked up 50 shares today on general principle."
Look for 243
ADBE is grossly undervalued by market players.It will break out 3 weeks tight pattern!
I warned u
to the MOON
ADBE reached a new All Time High at 237.40
"Every pop is followed by a sell-off. I like strong stocks on weak days, not weak stocks on strong days. I'm out. This stock should have done what $ADBE did today. But it failed."
"Too many bullish people today, this is telling me that the stock will go down big after earning"
"saw there was a big amount at 4pm size 347,258 at $476. was that a sell or buy order? anyone know?"
It will probably 500+ in 30 min
Up 10 tomorrow on huge volume.
I feel 300 around the corner. It is hovering here at this price from the last qtr. people waited how the merger acquisition will come out. They look like they are on all cylinders. Look at the digital advertisement business it is firing up. The 100b opportunity around here.300 around the corner.
This looks like it wants to retest resistance @ around $230.
Monster earnings on Thursday after the close!!!! This will trade north of $270.00.
"If you got some calls or out, you gave away your money. Too expensive with little movement in price"
This is over valued.
Adobe is down 7.87% to 290.41
is it good time for new position now? your advice
All you need to know if you don't see the obvious valuation and growth rate warnings surrounding ADBE.https://www.tradingview.com/chart/sow0vtYr/
We are ready to beak though $ 407.00!!!
Target $450!=Aggressive buy!
Disappointing guidance and the beat was not impressive I am glad I shorted down HUGE tomorrow usually only about 40% off the selloff occurs after hours so look for stock to be down about $15 tomorrow
Well IMO this stock will either go up or down after earnings report
Is this some kind of joke?
I covered 41 shares at 268.
Split coming soon? 2 for 1 or even 4 for 1 possible?
Why people selling. Earnings not out
Why so little gain today

9% move is just silly. CRM sympathy doesn’t imply ADBE can have similar performance.
"As expected, ADBE is coming right back."
This stock should be $525
"IMHO, ADBE is a ""Warren Buffet"" style stock; THE BEST TIME TO SELL IT?....NEVER"
Valution is 3x the lows

Adobe is a bubble. Beside photoshop and cloud they really have anything interesting or proprietary. You’ll see in 1 year

I am predicting $500+ after earnings - Adobe has been lagging behind the tech boom and should have a great quarter and guidance - good luck to everyone AH
"UP, UP, AND AWAY FOR ADBE!!! GO ADBE GO!!!"
ADBE has received 10 target hikes!! Many of them in the 450 area!https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-today-futures-poised-to-rebound-adobes-10-target-hikes-zynex-rallies/?src=A00220
190 today my prediction
"OUTSTANDING opportunity to short this pig at higher levels! .05 for a 280 dollar stock, and flat rev. It will close flat to red tomorrow imho."
GO ADOBE GO!
320+ at earning
Want the best trade tips? Just google ULTIMETESTCKALERTS .
$275.00-$280.00 after earnings. Options action on Sept.14...275 Calls looking great.
OMG you're a moron.
these guys are pumpers people.they muted me for asking the question of where did you get your info from
"Ok longs here is a free tip, at the market open, sell all your shares in a at the market order and then buy the same number or more shares short, over the next week you will make back all your losses plus on your short - you are all welcome"
ADBE: Instution been picking up shares this AMpassing 254.25 will close 260$ VERY possible
SELLLLLLL
This is a simple beat
Did it touch 170 today?
"Adobe's Indian CEO pledged allegiance to the US Stars and Stripes , and then promptly fired thousands of Americanworkers , replacing them with temp Indian H1Bs . Trump should revoked his US citizenship and deport him."
all the money went to Kodak
Happy I jumped in last week still long way to go adobe is highly undervalued like all tech stocks at the moment.
Adobe is down 7.45% to 311.68
Wait until conference call kicks in at 5PM.Shorts get ready to file for bankruptcy!!!Protect your homes! UP $20 plus tomorrow!
"Not a huge move so far, but breaking above $317 here, nice price action, traders like the report... :-)"
"BOOM, we are moving in the right direction!"
Will end the day down 5% only to see a 5% drop tomorrow as well. Friday will be brutal so who knows by then.
Yesterday I said $8 increase. Now it’s same...
"Guys, thank you for playing!Now that you bought, what are you going to do with it?"
Look at ADBE rally!!! They report earnings tomorrow!!!
Will flaten shoot up then down
I couldn't care less about Max Pain. Im selling 25% of my shares at 425 and another 25 after we cross 500. We may see 600 this year according to my estimates.
"I short adobe, should I cover now AH?"
Let push ADBE to new high today
Company will continue to miss moving forward. Outlook not realistic with current global and future corporate environment
Bought more on the dip. Shorts are in shark infested waters. They may think they're safe right now but that's only because the sharks haven't found them yet. Once the market starts rallying blood will be spilled.
"Adobe are buying Exela Technologies, Inc"
"Indicator RSI and Stochastic oscillator are triggering bullish signal, according to foxchart. On watch for clear recent high at 277.61."
When are the ER coming?
Eps looks amazingContinuously increasing revenue and OI. Cant have anything better than that!In pdf we trust
All time high
Beats revenue!!!
"The financials are outstanding, the reoccurring revenue from software as a service is going to propel this company to the freakin' moon."
"stay away from this software laggard:1. big cap;2. less rev/eps moat unlike MSFT, NOW,"
Will open around $275....... such an awesome report
300Coming dodo birds
"Frank, what's your point? Hundred dollar bills are made of a couple of cents worth of paper - TULIP THAT!"
adobe will pop today and monday before earnings.. and after earning 550$... easy. Sky is coming.!
"Wow, I foolishly followed the directions and updated Flash, and the MF Adobe download Maccleanup Pro virus.so long Flash and adobe"
"Nice close, but I am doubtful it will hold."
Why are we struggling today?
Look at the high flying IPOs. Risk appetite is still on. This one will catch up soon
going higher Monday another 10bucks.
Short at 139.20. Good luck.
"I read many freaking out..... You elected the WRONG President. I've lost $10K in the last 100 days. Not my fault.... I didn't vote for the Alzheimer's Puppet. Many investors are jumping ship based on his ""New"" Tax Increases and based on whom it will fall on. Thanks for voting on the Liberal Puppet. You Fricken' Idiots!"
"I feel quite safe owning shares in ADBE.Their products are at the very epicenter of the skill set necessary for WORK FROM HOME JOBS!While their cloud ventures place them at the forefront of AI integration and innovation.Eventually, I expect this company to take over MSFT in market cap. The utility of their products and services is unrivaled!Full Disclosure: I have a huge investment in the ADBE/ MSFT PAIR TRADE (long ADBE $100K / short MSFT $100k"
"Alert! Digital experience segment sales increased 34% to $743 million, above guidance for 31% growth. Adobe Digital experience segment will be worth over 200 billion in 5 years! These morons downgrading ADOBE have no clue on how valuable Adobe is going be in the near future! Clueless"
Either a Facebook type drop or a 10% up-day tomorrow
Who is buying low 300s?
Watch how big this rebounds.. don't miss out being foolish
550 after 4pm
Their 52 week high is within reach!!! GO ADBE GO!!!
"Solid quarter, great management team, and despite lower guidance, still resilient. I'm bullish on these guys. Go ask any of your creative friends what their preferred software is and you'll be hard pressed to find another name. I'm going long on ADBE"
This is really only the 2nd Qtr into what is becoming a phenomenon with Adobe. If you look at the product line nothing else even comes close and the AI platform is opening new markets for them.
Time to Buy Truck Load
"Earnings doesn't matter, its the guidance that matters now and that is below expectations."
"Been tracking this for a while now, waiting for the price to get below $400 before I move in.Looks like a great long term play."
"feel(or hope) we get back to the adbe i love, slow and steady no hysteric jumps just 2-3 percent every 1 to 2 weeks on a solid 30-40% year and im a happy little camper. gla"
knew there was risk holding short into earnings. Expect a massive sell off tomorrow when the market opens
ADBE is breaking out!!! GO ADBE GO!!!
Great earning report
i think its an error
"Looking but forward PE seems high, missing something? My sister left ADBE years ago for other opportunity and sold all her shares, 10 years ago, good news is, it's all in MSFT in the 40's."
ADBE is rocking again today!!! Here comes $ 320.
"Wish list for ADBE, use cash flow to invest in acquisitions, use stock to aquire acquisitions, borrow money to invest in acquisitions"
No move either direction??
"Get ready for phenomenal earnings report tomorrow for ADBE. BUY, BUY, BUY!!!"
"Well......that ADBE stock ""Implosion"" didn't last long. It wasn't even a speed bump !"
"Wait for 206.. You can make a small purchase here to test the waters. At 188, you can make bigger buys. Just know that this is roughly the range ADBE needs to get back to. My analysis is part gut feeling, and part self serving, wishful thinking. I want to get back in. Just don't see how till we hit these levels."
Seeing a bit of sly scare tactics going on for big investors before the ER.
"A vote for Trump is a vote to end democracy and to establish Russian-style authoritarian dictatorship. Eventually, the markets will react negatively to the GOP's undermining of checks and balances."
Buy ADBE anytime...Are you people kidding me???..What does a rock have to hit you in your head???..Adobe is a rock solid company with great management that is only going up???..JUST DO A LITTLE READING!!
the time is almost near! let's see where earnings takes us!
I knew it
"Big earnings beat, excellent ceo so probably great guidance"
"Undervalued I can't wait for the next tech bull to start running been transition into tech stocks all year FAANG to me is Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Nvidia and Google. Adobe get a honorable mention in FAANG."
will be down again tomorrow
I own half ADBE and AAPL....Both will be GREAT!!!!
Insanity buyers here. You will see another massive sell off with in weeks here.
Earnings to Watch this Week $ADBE https://www.instagram.com/p/CMsMDfiFcBG/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link
"Yeh, baby!!! Surge in buying!!!!"
"love it, a new high on a market down day. It may be just tenths of a point but its still beautiful"
"Nice move. Anyone miss any big movers this week? Dont miss them anymore. Text the word"" VIP "" to 1-833-847-7376 . Its free and the trade reports sent out here are from a wall street veteran. I have seen them, and am subscribed and its really good content and good trade ideas. Swing Traders and Short Term Investors check it out."
Why do we have a big drop yesterday?
LOL those algos are so jumpy just relax holmes
9 lives adbe. Is it a good time to buy?
Joke stock
Excellent conference call. What a great run company. Heading north for sure.
"ADBE is a ""Diamond in the Rough"". Watch this stock reach $ 400.00 by their earnings date in June 2020!!!"
"Adobe is $500 stock in 12 months, just doing what they are doing. 4 more quarters exactly like this one! Things that can turbo charge earnings, a falling dollar, revenues should accelerate now that product revenue is less than 7%, Magento intergration."
Adobe all time high $536.. but best quarter is yet to come.. tomorrow it will crush expectations and it will pop 15% and maybe hit all time high... U will see tomorrow...
ADBE reached an all time high at 366.33
"ADBE a sure winner,,,,,,Long term Investor"
why is Adobe going down after a good qtr result?
"Adobe made a successful transition to a subscription software model. They have a tremendous moat. They are profitable and earnings are up. The number of outstanding shares are down. The only reason the stock is down is because some people have sold their most profitable stocks to take profit out of fear of a collapse around this election. It will soon be over, and the money will be flooding back to Adobe because they are a winner. RSI is in the low 30s. This is a buy time if there ever was one."
"Magenta what!. Stupid management have no clue to how to rebrand their Ecommerce software to fight against Shopify. From online reviews, Magenta is a pathetic hard to use software compare to Shopify."
What will be the best price to buy in?
ALL TIME HIGH!!!!
Adobe is over played. Come to PSTH and get in early to something.
How does a regular post from one of us get deleted by Yahoo's filters but tulip mania spam posts get through? I really hate those posts.
ADBE partnered with MSFT around April of this year. A lot of market manipulation going on looks like a trading stock. I am just not going to worry at all.
That 244 support was hella strong... this may be a great buy opp.
TO THE MOON!!!!!
"Uptrend is broken, look to test $350 in the next few weeks, buy at $300"
ADBE will provide digital advertising and Web analytics for cryptocurrency?
Will be up tomorrow hands down.
Like ADBE and IQ rocket stocks
know the rules of this game
I just wasted some money on some 230 CALLs for tomorrow. Or did I? Probably. I guess we'll see in a minute.
"Adobe HR: fire Mason Wolf from experience platform, Gaurav Jain from e-commerce."
ADBE: last few Q ADBE was up 30$ AH for ER
Market is reacting to slowdown in China. Adobe is still a buy with consensus target of $293.
Why so quiet?
We’re close to the ALL TIME HIGH so UP or DOWN ER??
2.66 EPS next quarter considering no growth = 10.64 EPS gives a P/E of around 44. Nothing different than FANG companies but it was considering no growth. So if it shows growth over the next quarters it can easily reach 600+$ range
GReat NEWS MLNT was $1.98 yesterday now $7 on FDA approval up $5!!!!!!! After FDA approval same with PTN? Ashley and co will be decimated when we get approval go PTN get that FDA approval if Addyl can get it so can we just save women from that mess. IMO
damn it will go lower
Get in at $247
Just bought 25 more shares!
"Adobe is a screaming buy, going much higher! CEO must have said wait for MAX a hundred times on the conference call! There is a lot of AMAZING news coming. Earnings were great and with ADOBE flush with 4 billion in cash flow they are funded and capitalized to really take advantage of this huge secular change in digitalization of content, documents, marketing, data and AI. It looks that Adobe is going be coming out with some mindblowing mobile apps at MAX. The transformation of Adobe's business , platforms and opportunities have been nothing short of breathtaking. the next two quarters are going to be EPIC, Braveheart EPIC!"
Who was the loony tune that downgraded this stock a few days ago? Time to eat crow.
What is with the swing in stock price today? Up $3 and then all the way to down $3 later?
Looks like people are buying it could be 263 close
Idk why ADBE volume is so low! Such a great strong company and yet market under-react... 
I said 10 down it went 50 ho ho ho
"When $MSFT $ORCL $ADBE went Public, they were not flying high. They were innovators. of its time. $ZUO is an innovator of its time. Fact that stock fell is a great entry point to buy and hold for the growth. It is a volatile stock. A few weeks ago it was trading $24 then went to $34, Now it trades at great entry level under $29"
"Max Pain is only 410 but the weekly expirey's have such little volume, MM's aren't willing to move mountains to bring them about. Still,we could see the 410 promised today on the close."
https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180315006274/en/Adobe-Achieves-Record-Revenue
All aboard the train back to above 500 and then to 600. I bought the dip and am extremely bullish on ADBE's future. No competition in sight so no reason to be bearish. Shorts have no case on this stock. Every dip is an opportunity to get richer. Unless I'm horribly wrong the next leg up in the market has started and ADBE will break out again. Cover now shorts!
"As ADBE goes, so goes the Tech Sector. Give today's market flush another 2 days and we should be back to some sense of normalcy given the loose money at the FED - the current decline could be over by EOD tomorrow."
GBP went so high I hope adobe be high like gbp
This is stressful don't know where it going
Great stock but overvalued by about $30. Will go sideways and down a little to retrace.
You all who say ADBE is overvalued it's not that overvalued compared to other tech stocks
Dang... from 500 to 440
I can't find the official release. It sounds like it was mostly positive.
anybody know what caused this drop?
Think it goes up AH Friday and then again on Monday?
Which way y’all think this stock is going after ER announcement ?
Who thinks this will go up after earnings?
"Everytime CNBC Cramer mentions a stock, it always falls, no exception!Sell!"
Disregard if you trade short term. Most SaaS companies struggle to retain customers. Adobe is more like Microsoft.
Looks like they want to wipe the 175 calls as well.
"When the dust all settles, ADBE will be the Amazon of the decade! As they expand & diversify the ride will get sweeter and sweeter ..."
Also sold Tesla for adobe earning - it’s a simple beat tonight
"Shorted today at 175.60. This is a great stock and has had a spectacular run. Good time to put in a short, will average up if required if it goes over 200. At 230 I would cut losses. But if I am right as charts tell me I will see 160 long before I see 225."
Insiders are getting rich.
"RSI at 78, this is going to $350-355 soon enough. It’s overbought and it can’t stay that way forever, it just can’t and won’t."
Adobe is down 4.98% to 482.49
"I'm seeing a beat on earnings by 60%! Plus, Apple will kick start a rally in tech tomorrow. Momentum and fomo will flood ADBE tomorrow and after earnings we should see new highs this week!"
what a great buying opportunity going in with 20 more
Heres a little tid bit of good news if your long ADBEhttps://www.mercurynews.com/2018/01/10/adobe-buys-lot-new-office-tower-amid-downtown-san-jose-campus-expansion-google/
Adobe reached an all time high at 496.51
bubble
"The lower it goes, the more money you will make in the future. $380 by 2021."
JBL huge squeeze going down tomorrow after blowout earnings
What on earth!!! This is hooey!!! what is happening?
"Let's give it the most optimistic earnings estimate of $8 for FY 2019. That represents a revenue and earnings growth rate of well under 20%. Even at 25 times 2019 earnings you get a target price of 200, at 30 times you still get a price $20 below the current price. Fed's raising interest rates aggressively. Anyone thinks this stock's going higher from here, I will like to understand why? Valuations matter. It's a very good and well run company but overpriced like a lot of them out there right now."
Long hold (graphic designer)
This will go in Red.
Beat after earnings or?
"A bit concerned because it fell below the 50 day moving average, which its been bouncing off of consistently. Still holding though, should be back up to $260+ in a couple weeks"
My cost basis is in ADBE is $104....this stock has a moat and is the best cloud stock along with NOW IMO...this is the wrong stock to short. Long and strong.
go like my comment!! down... lets put it in top reactions so people who likes jim can see it!
Best thing you could do now is to sell this stonk after market and buy GME. This will be down tomorrow -5% and GME will be up +20% ;)

Coronavirus will not stop big company from purchasing subscription. Individual and other workshops will also keep their subscription and work from home or in small groups. I think maybe the Coronavirus will increase people's demand for cloud storage and pay more to use Adobe services.
Booyah! I see Upgrades coming and new PT say around... $200.
"yeaah got some at 476 for LT, tomorrow back into the greens. Love the discount, thankyou!"
GoT in @ 260 ADBE has been good to me
"Earnings on 3/11, beat and we go over $500, easy money."
"$460 is the price to look for, then itll pop off"
Pre-market trading is very strong... This day should be delightful.
"Guys i think ,this is not time to buy ,so just wait a few days and then ,GO"
Anyone else a member of (http://bestpix.xyz)? They just mentioned ADBE.
"Shareholders should vote to push out the CEO and his buddies on the board. Cost cutting and layoffs of countless managers (especially those who were hired just for been Indians) should be introduced.Adobe should stop useless acquisitions: this is total waste, Adobe cannot handle the acquired technologies: 80% of whatever Adobe touches turns to manure."
I use adobe and autodesk everyday
Buy the options
Still undervalued.. keep buying or miss the opportunity...
I am thinking 200 next year at this time.
PATHETIC!! Up in AH and down in day trading 3 days in a row
"Adobe should double in 24 months, there seems to be no end in sight for growth, magin expansion, cash flow explosive growth, innovation. Adobe might be the single best run company in the world"
"added at 178, the company is fantastic and thats all i care about right now"
Check out ZI could be a CRM Buy Out target.
"Think this will hit 400 by end of monthThen who knows much every photograph, digital artist, animator, illustrator, animator uses these softwares can’t imagine that changing in decades"
cross back over 50ma...strong uptrend. obv turn positive. covering my short and start call position.
going to exercise my options if it goes down by the stupid selling .. Close your eyes for 2 months see 550
What's happening? What news is causing ADBE to go down?
Buy now or you will regret...
I think that’s all the loss we are going to get today
Most software stocks were down today. Rotation into SEMIs. Adbe will bounce back $20-25 one day next week.
good earnings !
They miss by 1 cents am I reading this correct?
Just bought a bunch...fingers crossed!
Fugly chart double topAnd abou to fall to 400

don't buy before fed cut news
"So sick of ADBE. Stuck for months with this stock. No movement, no dividends, no nothing. I predict ADBE will stagnate until MSFT acquires this boring company. I used to work for ADBE for 10 years, so I can tell where this company is going. The company has metastasized beyond repair with hierarchy of Indians and their relatives at every level. Toxic environment inside the teams.Hopefully it hits 500, so I will sell all and never look back. I will not care if it later hits 700, 800, etc."
reports adj'd EPS of $1.71 on revs of $2.6B vs EPS est of $1.62 on revs of $2.5B
Micron Is Better! Zzzz
Im happy with ADBE. Bought 2000 shares at $84.
Just shorted more
There is nowhere to grow for ADBE. Photoshop CC? Acrobat? Premiere? Lightroom? Oh cmmn..
Adobe on sale!!!
What is a Pandenic? It's a an Abode Play-dough Tulip mania buying scheme? I bought some physical Abode today
"hey @Benjo dude, since you are at it why even buy at $16-$170? why not $60-$70 or hell why not $6-$7,,,> In fact why the hell buy this stock to begin with especially if you feel there is manipulation with earnings.. LOL."
Breakout today above 350Next target 400
Anyone shorting before earnings? I saw Cramer video and he says that ADBE falling every time after earnings report. What you guys thinking?
The King of Could now and in the future!!! Great earnings and guidance expected!!!!
What time are those #$%$ earnings?????
