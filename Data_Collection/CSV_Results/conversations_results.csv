predicting questions in march “today’s share price is 80 should i get in now or is it too late” answer no it’s not but wouldn’t you rather have gotten in at 58 or lower we’ve seen these questions weekly since 2s look at the 1 year trend and consider where nio may be 12 months from now too many positivestrategic things happening to keep sp below 100 for long the fastest growth in 202120222023 will belong to nio not tsla when shorts suggest the sky is falling daily ignore them or tell them to look at the charts as they speak for themselves nio is just getting started folks

hey tesla long term investorswhenever i see a research analyst doing one of these doom and gloom prediction on tsla price i start to pay attention jp morgan analyst ryan brinkman in december upgraded tsla price from 8090 and i was like whats up with that with a sell rating because i have about 45 of my portfolio tied to tsla and i want to make sure i see what he is seeing so i did some research on what the guy is about i just want to report back that i dont have too much to worry about and let me explainthe guy is a legit automotive research analyst having more than 10 years of research experience in the automotive sector my problem is not with what background he has but its what he does not we all know there has not been a whole lot of innovations in the automotive industry except tsla until this year when all the automotive legacy companies jump on the bandwagon because of tslas established success in this area but we all know tsla is not just an ev manufacturer its also autonomous drivingartificial intelligence battery technology with current production unlike another company called qs energy storage robotics software development car insurance hvacetc now how could a guy like that covering all these areas with just automotive research background with a master degree in accounting oh my god just we need another research analyst with accounting background if its that simple joe from our own chat room can do his job easily i think an ideal person for this type of analyst has to have a combo of 57 years of auto manufacturing industry 23 years of sw industry 2 years of artificial intelligencerobotics experience and a couple years of solar energy solutions industry an analyst with this combination of experience would be very expensive for investment banks but its absolutely necessary to cover a company such as tsla welladditionally i always want to see what credibility does this guy have i have extracted some information on brinkmans past performance from tipranka site which keeps the performance of stock research analystsand share with everyone in the forumranked 6701 out of 7182 analysts on tipranks 14083 out of 15010 overall expertsaverage return of ratings he gave out 44i dont know about you but why is the media even give this guy the time of the day given that terrible performance record

tesla cheats it’s investor calculating always with percentagesthat’s a big fraud you also have to consider the numbers absolute and these totals in prices shows the dilemma and what a big fraud the valuation is teslas fanboys ignoring this factto have 60 growth of one product like models y is not a good message in totals it is ridicolous and there is also a cannibalism effect with respect to model 3this shows all press releases focus on one good number while there are many bad numbers included  when there is a correct interpretation the valuation is the biggest bubble ever and will cost many shareholders big losses90 is my prediction jan 20 reuters  tesla incs vehicle registrations in the us state of california jumped nearly 63 during the fourth quarter compared with last year largely due to the success of the companys model y according to data from crosssell httpsinfocrosssellcomteslaspecialreport0 a research firm that collates title and registration datathe automaker reported betterthanexpected 2020 vehicle deliveries earlier this month driven by a steady rise in electric vehicle adoption even though it narrowly missed its ambitious fullyear goal of half a million deliveries during a punishing year for the global auto industrythe report released on wednesday showed registrations in california a bellwether for the electric carmaker and its largest us market recovered from a thirdquarter low of about 16200 vehicles to around 22117 vehicles in the three months ended decemberat about 11417 registrations in the state for teslas model y compact crossover utility vehicle surpassed those for the model 3 california registrations for teslas model 3 massmarket sedan fell 34 on a yearly basis to 7044total fourthquarter vehicle registrations in the 23 states where data was collected stood at 44749 with model y accounting for nearly half the registrationsregistration figures might not accurately reflect the number of vehicle deliveries during the quarter as registrations in the united states typically take about 30 days from the time of saletesla whose shares surged over 700 in 2020 is expected to report fourthquarter results after market close on jan 27 reporting by akanksha rana and ayanti bera in bengaluru and tina bellon in new york editing by vinay dwivedi

i only see three possibilities for the people who complain about tesla1 they are bearish and they are shorting2 they wish they got in earlier and are hoping it goes down so they can buy at a lower price3 they are whining about a stock that they have no position in nor any intention to have a positionwhich is it
if i put in a sell order gtc for 500 and someone else puts in a sell order gtc at 550 and the equity opens up at 600 which order will be filled first by the market maker
we will get a tiny down move today but it wont be nearly enough it might move down 10 or 20 this stock would be overpriced at 400 the issue is that theres too much magical thinking right now theres a lot of competition and the market is treating tesla as if has none this magical thinking will eventually ebb away but it may take quite some time it could take a year for this thing to correct like it should

love my ev picks tsla elcr
do people not understand that tesla shareholders decide what tesla is worth tesla has amazing technology and innovation but at the end of the day we the peopleinvestor determine the rise of tesla we see the future and it is why we choose to give tesla a higher market cap which can allow tesla to gain more funds for rd and gigafactories 100 gigafactories powers the world  welcome to the future of investing this is how great companies are created
hard lesson will be learnedthe pain is coming to those who dont know how to properly value a company

i had 43 shares of tesla at one point and sold at 643 hoping for a dip that would allow me to buy 44 shares but it took off that is a sad feeling fortunately i invested in one of the chinese ev brands now i am the proud owner of 47 sharesthis stock has its bad days but when it takes off you only see its tail lights getting smaller and smaller and you are left eating the dust not a good idea to bet against tesla
now that tsla is at 850 and at 1617 pe i think its time to consider again the product vs its competition there are many competitor ev cars and trucks now and many more coming that are more comfortable roomier ergonomically more sound offer better customer service and better range tesla has great brand recognition but not a great product and i think in 6 months to a years time we will be thinking of this stock more like a myspace one of the originals but not the pick moving forward

vw posted over 12 billion profit and this turd will be lucky for 3 billion i love how people say tsla is not a car company yet the only revenue stream is carstax credits and the stock rises and falls significantly on announcements related to its car business the typical response is tsla is a company of 20 startups to which i counter 90 of startups fail and the ones that i’ve heard about are just jokes that people with too much money musk created out of boredom eg the boring company and it’s flamethrower

tesla is one of the most over valued stocks ever companies are valued or should be on the basis of a stream of likely earnings in the future to value it sensibly at  800 billion it would have to be able to generate profits of around 50bn a year in fairly short order that is simply not possible the car market is intensely competitive tesla is now being outsold by three other companies in europe i suspect the big fall will come after 27th january 2021 the cult like followers are anticipating incredible results when they are merely in line with expectations perhaps a sense of reality will set in moods change very quickly in markets

tsla short sellers lost 401 billion last year and have been defeated its hard to imagine anyone has had a better year than elon musk did in 2020 his personal net worth soared like one of his spacex rockets increasing by more than 100 billion and his loudest critics aka investors who shorted tesla tsla stock on the assumption the share price would go down lost a record 401 billion betting against him according to analysis by s3 partnersmany of the shorts were forced to admit defeat last year about twothirds of the short positions were unwound during 2020 which in itself was a factor that helped drive tesla shares higher as the short investors were forced to buy higherpriced shares to exit their positions

i’d like to understand the bullish point of view where do you guys see tesla in 5 years in terms of rev sales etc
at some point tesla should sell enough cars to justify their valuation plus profit from car sales a very long way to go or the valuation will drop to meet what they actually dohttpstwittercomtweetmyinboxstatus1345771438603726848
analysts are starting to realize that the higher tsla stock price the easier tsla can fund its growth and the more valuable it should be but the other virtuous cycle they havent considered is that people who buy tsla stock will buy tsla cars and the higher the stock the easier they are able to afford the car
just for conversation how many cars will tsla have to build to make 4200 a share to get to a 20 pe and grow into this valuation things that make you go hmm

tesla long and strongwho wants to drive gm or ford they can’t figure out how to make cars for over 100 years
for anyone that has studied bubbles if everyone is saying it’s a bubble it’s not a bubble only when most if not all of the skeptics capitulate and buy in believing outsized gains are the new normal does a bubble at risk of bursting take hold tesla is still too early in its life cycle there are still an enormous number of skeptics as can be seen i’m holding at least 3 years possibly 5 there is still massive growth ahead for this company once everyone buys in to tesla’s world changing products and services only then will i consider selling
took a ride in a friends tesla hes part of the fsd beta while it generally does well it really choked in two instances one was road construction with cones directing you into the oncoming lane and the flow of traffic was being directed by a police officer we could see his signaling but it was confusing even to us i dont see how fsd ever gets to understanding this  which makes me think the robotaxi business is a nonstarter the second situation where it got confused and required my friend to take over was on a highway where they had redirected the lanes 12 lane over to make room at roadside for what looked like sewer work behind a barrier the lane shift had new lines and somewhat stripped  scrapped old lines fsd couldnt understand what was going oni went into this with an open mind and while system is impressive in 95 of road scenarios it utterly fails in the last 5 and this comports with what ive read  the last few percent of autonomous diving is 95 of the workso in conclusion i think you can cancel your robotaxi dreams
the difference between tesla and other competitors is that tesla is focusing on the product and customer other car companies are focusing on tesla
so apple is rumored to work on electric cars maybe elon should enter the telecommunication business since they already have a lot of satellites flying up there tsla phone anyone

guys serious questioni have lost everything and im not sure how to continue this summer i invested 17500 six months salary and my entire life savings into ornamental gourd futures hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry after watching a video about vincent kosuga and his monopoly on onions i decided id try to do something similar with another vegetable i did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this years gourd yield would be far smaller than the past due to deteriorating soil conditions in central mexico and a warmerthanaverage spring at first demand soared around halloween and prices skyrocketed but the gourd bubble burst on november 12th unfortunately the coronavirus caused a massive dropoff in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for thanksgiving and prices plummeted i had invested early enough that i thought i would still be fine but then on the morning of december 2nd a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel the massive gourd shipment from argentina scheduled for early march had arrived i was planning on selling off my futures right before this in february but this ruined everything to top it off the gourds in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan some topping 4 pounds each causing the priceperpound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound i am ruined
the 78 year old guy with dimentia is in control of your portfolio now
i am going to short tesla  today imo the valuation has reached an unsustainable level production  delivery challenges are sprouting up which will likely be revealed in the 27th earnings call and the competition is quickly catching up to chip into market share the bold and committed investors will do the same the curious fearful or brainwashed will sit on the sidelines and watch the pullback without the financial windfall in their portfolios
this message is for any new tesla members there is a lot of fear spread on this board by short sellers  often messages about tesla falling for example there were tonnes every other minute about stock tanking the week after sp inclusion it’s true the price was volatile around the inclusion but it rebounded to new highs i used to get worried about these warnings so much so that i sold once too early and it cost me in fees taxes and missed opportunity  since then i bought back in and gained but i would have been much much wealthier had i not soldsummary point is don’t be scared by their warnings tesla has a bright future is lead by a revolutionary genius and continues to go up despite small set backs here and there be strong and hold especially on red days don’t give into the fud by shorts  it’s a trick they want your shares at a discount remember my words you will be rewarded

i find it most interesting that rusch 1036 and ives 1250 new targets for the first time have not pushed tesla higher once upon a time in this fantasy world there long term targets would be hit in weeks in november ives raised his basecase stock price target to 560 from 500 best case you all fooled him so he more than doubled it basically in two short months say tesla is not a 560 billion dollar company but a 12 trillion dollar company yes 300 billion for the two existing and two to be built factories not enough cars built on the planet to support that number and you know what all of you bought it so why arent you buying it anymore

world auto production in 2019 was 91786861 tesla at their present margin ratios which would include the sale of regulatory credits would need to sell every car in the world for 10 years to have a pe similar to toyota the tesla market cap is absurd at best buy it now and you will pay a hefty price in the next few years
to potential tesla stock buyers please read the following before buying sharestheres a lot of debate about the valuation of tesla proponents of the stock will recklessly promote it and will tell you not to believe posters like me they will tell you that i am spreading fud but i am honest and presenting the reality you should read the arguments from both side before risking your money in this stockto anyone considering tesla understand that 1 it has had an amazing run that defied all standard expectations for a stock given the companys actual financial performance 2 past stock performance is not an indicator of future results 3 by every metric of company valuation tesla is grossly overpriced 4 tesla has overpromised and underdelivered repeatedly with respect to its products and 5 tesla does not have any lock or monopoly on any of its businessyou can believe in tesla the company its supposed mission and elon musk but none of that means that the current price for the stock is appropriate or sustainable proponents or bulls will regurgitate that its the future without elaborating they will tell you its more than a car company despite well over 90 of its revenue coming from cars sales they will disregard competition from existing automakers and new ev startups they will do just about anything besides admit that they have been wildly lucky and hit the equivalent of the lottery with teslas past year runup so just think about it before you buy

tesla couldnt keep up with the market today the institutions know something and its crazy retail thats propping up this sideways action meanwhile the institutions are offloading my guess is earnings are going to be a big miss credits were frontloaded in prior quarters and theyre less and less necessary meanwhile costs are going up with all of the factory construction and design work i can only imagine the overtime engineers must be putting in to make the exoskeleton cybertruck compliant because thats what musk demands

there are a few things that keep coming up that i think need clarification1 yes ark funds do sell tesla shares its because they have to in order to balance the funds if tesla rises significantly they have to trim shares so that a certain percentage of the fund isnt exceeded by tesla alone and so risk is managed since tesla has been on a tear its value in the funds skyrockets anyway its just normal maintenance for very wellmanaged funds and it signals no more than that if you have doubts visit the ark invest site and look at the number of shares held vs shares sold2 yes tesla is astronomically overvaluedif youre judging by standard figures and philosophy but as we know tesla tends to defy such valuation there are a few analysts who have recognized this early on and several who are finally coming around to the idea teslas value comes from the potential of all of its irons in the fire not just current car sales and revenue even if we ignore the attraction to elon musk for his various endeavors like spacex and the irrational exuberance and cultish nature of the stock we cant ignore the potential tesla holds in various sectors battery tech solar power electric utility car insurance autonomous cars and robotaxisand oh yeah cars its a long list yes there are those who kick and scream about it and its understandable nonetheless the reality is right in front of us has it crashed in the past sure its been quite volatile can it crash again absolutely can it continue to rise also absolutely but one thing is for certain its real and there are good reasons behind it even if theyre not the typical ones3 if elon musk decides he wants to sell some shares good for him i would if i had such a quantity i have no idea what he plans to do with his fortune but if he were to sell some shares it doesnt indicate a loss of faith or guidance part of elon musks compensation is stock if he wants to sell some shares he has every right to do so and should as hes worked hard for it and deserves his pay4 tesla is musks only publiclytraded company to get in on the others like spacex requires highdigit private investment if theres any opportunity available at all i do recall musk mentioning that if starlink goes public tesla investors would have first crack at shares im not sure about the logistics of that but it would be nice for us will spacex go public probably not as musk likely relishes the freedom to not have to answer to stockholders on that onejust my two cents hope it provides some clarity for those with concerns andor questions good investing and best of luck to all of us

from seeking alphasummary • despite having less than 1 of global auto market share teslas market cap is now greater than that of all nonchinese automakers combined • tesla is clearly priced for massive growth yet half of its current products are aging and its development pipeline is sparse • the tesla semi new roadster and cybertruck have all been unveiled they are already facing significant competition from other automakers • even if teslas most ambitious assumptions were to play out as planned it would not be enough to justify the current valuation • tesla is already seeing declining market share in the most mature ev markets as this trend continues in 2021 the growth narrative will likely come under pressureat present tesla inc nasdaqtsla has just four electric vehicle models in active production the model s the model x the model 3 and the model y the model s and model x while extremely innovative at the time of their introduction are now aging platforms in decline leaving the model 3 and model y to carry ever more of the load while both have proven popular their addressable market is finite as evidenced by tesla’s having had to resort repeatedly to price cuts to keep demand from ebbing throughout 2020 even in the supposedly nearlimitless chinese marketceo elon musk has stated that tesla aims to produce 20 million vehicles per year by 2030 far beyond the wildest peak annual demand projections for the model 3 and model y combined to achieve its goal tesla will have to bring a host of new offerings to market over the course of the next decade yet the company has struggled of late to expand its product development pipeline as i discussed in a recent article the tesla semi which has yet to enter production more than three years after it was unveiled is one clear example of this issue
way back when amazon was under 100 everyone screamed overvalued not making money selling books they will never de thrown barnes  noble i panicked and sold at 450 happy with my 350 profit biggest mistake of my investing career i learned from that which is why tesla has made me into a multimillionaire it wasn’t hard to own tesla way back when at 38 100 and 180 a share 1000 shares was easily a part of any well seasoned portfolio and today with 5 times the amount and 1000 rise in price well this has made up for all of amazon

most likely short term scenario price goes to 900 elon then announces another split stock goes to 1000 presplit on the news 5 for 1 then he issues another 5b in stock because there’s actually a tsla stock shortage now that institutions have to buy and hold due to sp then the share price splits to 200 without a decrease to accommodate the 5b offering elon gets the cash for rd and the shareholders get the returns easy peasy
i can say that nobody is going to buy at this price insiders are selling to common folks robinhooder those are the people that will hold the bag if you are saying institutions are buying think about this every year they would want to make a profit to show investors how good they are they need this stock to go down substantially in order to make good profits for 2021 you have been warn and if you look at charts everything is overbought overvalued if you swing trade then probably fine but if you going to hold the bag by all means do as you wish

tesla is an environmental movement phenomenon unlike other stocks tesla has so many loyal investors that believe more than making a few bucks these investors don’t tend to sell tesla so easily when the market take a dip they been thru so many up and down and still going strong you won’t hear one complain or anyone regret buying only the sellers and the shorters are the ones regretting everyone that sell ended up buying back again at a higher price

hello followers and happy new year i have been on an extended holiday and have just returned i have analyzed thoroughly and see that tsla is sitting in the perfect position for the royal canadian mounties  the option mms and their followersplayers to effect the very significant  most significant in fact option unwind in the history of tsla you see that this friday  the jan 15 options will expire these were the former leap options that have been around for a couple of years or so so they naturally have a lot of open interest  but in fact they have more open interest than any series of options that tsla has experienced ever so much interest  that if you choose the strike price which renders the lowest dollar value of all the combined options outstanding for jan 15 expiry added together  what all the calls and puts of the whole series would be worth if tsla closes at that strike price they would still be worth 143 billion  that compares with the analgous figure of 380 million for the jan 22 expiration  a small percentage of the dollar open interest of the jan 15 exp at yesterdays close of aprox 850 the jan 15 options would be worth aprox 226 billion  now i have seen tsla swallow 2 billion of change from the ldv without trouble when it has news or huge momentum but never has it had to swallow such a difference before it is going to be interesting to see this expiration have fun my followers
tsla rode earlier from 200 to 4400 because of a similar preorder newslet’s ride this to 100
teslas success has sown the seeds of its failure if tesla hadnt gone up 10 times from its price last march but instead just rose a modest 24 each year it might well have been an a successful track to increase in value 10 times by 2030but tesla soaring stock price has drawn in a huge amount of capital into the ev market the market always overdoes it when there is technological change creating a new product there will end up being excess capacity and all the ev makers will be fighting for market share and profits will be meager at best at least 12 of them will end up in bankruptcy this is the lesson of the past the 1960s had the color tv boom every household was going to buy one and they did and the tv makers went bust or were bought out by the japanesealuminum was the growth industry of the 1950s as lightweight aluminum was revolutionizing products the big three aluminum companies advertised heavily on tv as the metal of the future kaiser and reynolds have disappeared and alcoa is still around ceased being a growth stock in the 1960s

here is the upgrade noticeupdated  january 5 2021 432 pm estmorgan stanley analyst adam jonas raised the price target on tesla nasdaq tsla to a street high 81000 from 54000 while maintaining an overweight rating the firm set a bull case of 1232jonas raised 2030 volume to 52 million units versus 38 million unitsthe analyst comments while the range of outcomes is admittedly high the market has ‘chosen’ to ascribe a higher level of discounted value to tesla than that typically discounted for its peers despite the extraordinary run in the share price we continue to believe that tesla can outperform vs our sector in 2021 in our opinion tesla is still the best positioned company in evs and avs under our coverage due to its people its technology business model and access to capital furthermore it is important to note that the company has no entanglement with the environmental liabilities that burden its legacy competition put it all together and we believe teslas business model can unlock recurring mobility services revenue faster and more profitably than the competition we struggle to find a more innovative company with the ability to execute against the high degree of difficulty inherent in sustainable transportation and energy at scale we reckon its a rather short list

detroit ap — tesla inc is balking at recalling about 159000 vehicles with potentially defective touch screens so us safety regulators are moving to force the company to take actionthe national highway traffic safety administration on wednesday sent a letter to tesla saying it has tentatively determined that the screens are defective and pose a safety risk because they can cause backup cameras to go dark and defrosters to malfunctionthe agency wouldnt comment beyond the letter which is a rare step toward a public hearing and eventual legal action experts say the letter means that tesla has resisted doing a recall that nhtsa feels is necessary“its obvious to me that tesla told nhtsa to go pound sand so what theyre about to get theyve earned it” said frank borris a former head of the agencys office of defects investigation who now runs a safety consulting businessmessages were left wednesday seeking comment from tesla which is based in palo alto californialast june the agency opened an investigation into complaints that the giant touch screens would go dark in certain 2012 through 2018 model s cars and 2016 through 2018 model x tesla vehicles it upgraded the probe to an engineering analysis in novemberthe letter says the agency has determined that the screens are defective because their computer processors have a finite number of programanderase cycles nhtsa says the screens would fail in five to six years which isnt sufficient for safetycritical features“the lack of a functioning windshield defogging and defrosting system may decrease the drivers visibility in inclement weather increasing the risk of a crash” the letter saidin data submitted by tesla the agency found more than 12000 customer complaints field reports warranty claims and other claims related to the screens the letter saidnhtsa also determined that the failure rate for the screens is higher than the rate for vehicles involved in prior recalls for similar problemstesla tried to fix the problem with several overtheair software updates but nhtsa said it tentatively believes the fixes are insufficient“i think its planned obsolescence which requires physical replacement of a part which tesla tried to gloss over by sending a software update” said jason levine executive director of the nonprofit center for auto safetythe screen failures also can cause the loss of audible chimes and alerts that are part of tesla’s “autopilot” driverassist systemthe letter says that if tesla formally decides not to do a recall it has to provide nhtsa with an explanation the agency can schedule a public meeting on matter and could turn it over to the justice department for legal action borris saidborris who reviewed the letter called it very thorough and said nhtsa has a strong case should tesla decide to challenge the agency in court
is anyone else worried about all the competition that is suddenly coming out in the ev market
guys ive done a lot of research and im about to go long tsla because of it if my math is correct tsla doubles once a month so by this date next year tsla should be trading for 320000 per share or a roughly 300 trillion market cap i feel like thats a pretty conservative number i give it a margin of error to the upside of 10000 so i plan on putting in 10 and i expect it to be worth 100 billion in jan 21 wish me luck guys im a tesla person

1t valuation for tsla is very small no reason aapl is 2x higher valuation
i do not want to go on a huge rant this is my opinion for any new investors that may not be able to take big losses no matter how well this stock is run or future potential if markets turn bad for hundreds of reason like interest rates spike due to money printing or us raises taxes to combat there spending that is out of control or 30 year bond rises unexpected all of these can cause a panick in markets and cause a major correction in all sectors these markets are grossly over valuated and its due to history low interest rates do your home work learn about fundamentals learn charts etc and invest not just on hype because you can be trapped in a stock very fast

most people on this board are not understanding the role low interest rates have played in soaring pes even with the fed plowing money into bonds the 10yr rate has jumped bigly to start the year what this means is that companies have to increase earnings by the same amount or else stocks will plummet watch the interest rates very closely if they keep rising at some level they will trigger a sell off

well the numbers are in for the tsla short world “ marktomarket short losses for tesla totaled over 40 billion as it was “far and away the most unprofitable trade in 2020 and had the largest yearly loss we have seen historically”the bulls and the bears did battle in the pit with no holds barred no one knows how it will play out for 2021 but even with the competition finally gearing up for a piece of the bev market share it will challenge their resourcefulness in one important sense elon musk has already won his personal vision and purpose of acting as a catalyst for encouraging all players brought into being energy sustainable transportation the biggest vehicle manufacturing entities in the world cannot ignore their altered renewables future some will in their own fashion and innovation carry the industry forward and prosper the financial industry and its market’s own uniqueness will play their role since wall street’s early 19th century beginnings next year will certainly be exciting can hardly wait to see what lies ahead

every time tesla goes up more than 3 now they are adding more in market cap then they do in annual revenue itd be like ford adding 130 billion in market cap please let that sink in i understand theyre not just a car company but until their financials resemble something else this company is wildly overvalued by even the most positive outlook
jacob walthour of blueprint put it so wellvaluation is the wrong way to look at tsla evs are the future and right now the performance and range of the competition’s evs are lackluster compared to tsla’s evs as long as that’s the case tsla will continue to do well

from wall street journal todayzwickau germany—five years and nearly 50 billion into the auto industry’s biggest bet on electric vehicles volkswagen vow 078 ceo herbert diess and his guest chancellor angela merkel stood in anticipation as the first id3 germany’s longawaited answer to tesla rolled off the assembly linethe event at the company’s flagship ev plant just over a year ago marked a “systemic shift from the combustion engine to the electric vehicle” said thomas ulbrich leader of the id3 effortthe car however didn’t work as advertisedit could drive turn corners and stop on a dime but the fancy technology features vw had promised were either absent or broken the company’s programmers hadn’t yet figured out how to update the car’s software remotely its futuristic headup display that was supposed to flash speed directions and other data onto the windshield didn’t function early owners began reporting hundreds of other software bugs
not much upside and 8090 chance that top hit at 880 ibd advised that 67 indicators showed that tesla is reaching a climax run after a climax run comes a big pullbackpe ratio all time highps ratio all time highrsi off by one point from 2013 all time hightesla expected to make 31b in revenue but has a 800b market cap if anyone can find any other stock that has ever done this in the history of stocks tech auto whatever please give me the name apple disrupted the cell phone market when they developed the first touch screen iphone 35b in revenue at the time  175b market cap amazon disrupting brick and mortar business amongst all other thingshad a 3600 pe at one point but were making 5560b in revenue and had a 150b market cap google i’m sure you’ve heard of them highest pe they ever had was around mid 50s netflix disrupting streaming business traded at a about 450 pe at their highest while making close to 4b in revenue and had a 45b market cap highest ps ratio of about 12 so just compare tesla to any other major tech company and you’ll see the insane overvaluation here even though as it stands tesla makes most of their money from selling cars up close to 900 since march people need to get a close look and see that numbers like that can only be compared to com bubble welcome to the ev bubble you have companies like nkla with no revenue valued close to 10b there’s a new ev company every other day and competition is everywhere tesla could sit at this price for the next 35 or more years and still be grossly overvaluedreality is tesla is expected to make 31b this year 45b next year and 65b in 2023 with this growth fair value they should be around 300400b market cap and that’s still being very generous don’t worry there was plenty of blind fomo buyers in the com bubble as well they would speak the same language as the pumpers here keep in mind that it took investors 1015 years to make their money back and that’s if they invested in amazon looks like history will repeat itself this coming earnings report should do the job y’all better hope they smash expectations by at least 100 since they barely met 2020 delivery expectations i expect a modest beat at best then let the massive selling begin sell the newsleaving off with this on 123 musk stated to his employees that tesla needs “to cut costs or the firms stock price could be “crushed like a soufflé under a sledgehammer”  that was around 550 sp well we’re now 55 higher and i am sure tesla didn’t magically make any drastic changes to their cost cutting within a month should be a big warning sign

theres reason to be positive on tesla as a company but not silly positive with the current stock pricing 1 tesla  23x ford  13x general motors  8x volkswagen  4x toyota volkswagen and toyota generate the most revenue of all automobile manufacturers ford and gm are among the top seven tesla is does not make the list of the top 20 peugeot doesif we cut teslas stock price in half its still very optimistic at 400share it would be 12x ford  6x general motors  4x volkswagen  2x toyota toyota revenues and earnings are 10x that of tesla how long will it take for tesla to catch up to toyota and be worth even 1x as muchanother example tesla brings in 12 of the revenue and earnings of peugeot peugeots market cap is 23b a fair valuation for tesla would appear to be 12b but ok lets give tesla a higher valuation for being innovative and possibly opening up new markets but this is speculative what multiple of a fair valuation makes sense twice as much three times as much certainly not 80 times as much

tslas sp may very well start to erode now with little to no end in sight why too much real competition with many leading ev makers reaching 100000 in volume in 2022 tsla 2023 numbers going forward are going to get revised down gm comes out as a surprise competitor whom may actually be better positioned than tesla with many partnerships building cheaper cars and they currently hold the title for a best selling ev in china now  nio has battery tech that seems to be better than teslas but teslas biggest problem is the 25000 sub car market you know the main part of the car market for the average consumer many ev manufactures are much closer to the goal of a mass market 25000  ev gm is emerging as major competition for tesla  nio xpeng li byd right now  gms stock will go up more than teslas this year and possibly more than those other ev manufacturers as well everyone wrote off ice manufactures but gm has been making incremental upgrades the whole time dont count out ford with the mache either as far as im concerned tesla will maintain its market share on the higher end evs but doesnt have a chance against ev competitors that already have sub 25000 evs tesla makes 4 vehicles out of  100  different types needed to replace ice keep in mind that teslas rise from 20172020 had a lot to do with traditional ice manufactures only pretending to compete because they believed tesla would falter well fast forward to now and we can see that it is a much different environment with everyone working on evs
tesla to produce 800 million carspe is often used as a realistic barometer of a companies value with an auto producer that pe could be extended to cars produced for example toyota produced 88 million cars last year to achieve earnings their pe is 921 this indicates that toyota needs to produce 88 million cars times 921 years of earnings to meet market cap this total is 81480000 vehiclestesla produced 500000 cars last year their pe is 1628 and this is not a fully diluted pe multiply the two and the total is 814 million cars fully diluted and this number nears 900 million there is not enough raw material capacity to achieve this in the next 10 years world auto production in 2019 was 91786861 tesla at their present margin ratios which would include the sale of regulatory credits would need to sell every car in the world for 10 years to have a pe similar to toyota the tesla market cap is absurd at best buy it now and you will pay a hefty price in the next few years
future are up really nicely tomorrows going to be good for all those calls
i expect at least 1share in earnings for the 4th quarter analysts have been sandbagging with low estimates tsla is very profitable now and would be even more profitable if it didnt have the cost of the options granted to musk in 2018post your own estimates tsla is very profitable now and would be even more profitable if it didnt have the cost of the options granted to musk in 2018 this would stop growing if the stock price would drop back down below 100share so considering that and all the cash tsla has raised i think tsla is worth that much that would be about 30 times what i project for 2021 earningsnone of this matters really as the stock price is so inflated the real question is what will tsla earn in 2022 and 2023 when the competition gets significanttsla bulls are expecting great things but its curious tsla is not spending very much on rd nor on capital expenditures in general for a company expected to grow 10 times in sales in just a few years tslas rd expenses were just a little under 1 billion for first 9 months of both 2019 and 2020relative to market cap tsla is now spending only about 01 on rd annually yet this is a tech company destined to grow 10 times in a decadegms cruise division 80 owned shows gms net investment in auto drive along about equal to tslas entire rd budget yet tsla has 10 times the enterprise value does this make sense

here is my biggest concern with tesla’s valuation leaving a parking garage yesterday i noticed the incredible variety of cars around me many different makes and many different models hundreds people love variety their car is part of their identity and what differentiates them from others based on tesla’s current valuation the market is saying someday tesla will make at least 3050 of all cars on the road that would be an incredible assumption because of the desire for variety in the cars we like to drive i don’t see tesla able to profitably develop such variety i think tesla will grow into a very significant and important company but they will not be the apple of cars because the car market seeks variety

been looking around the web about response to nio day it is very bullish tsla has the high stock price it has relative to sales because of its tech first mover status and the future sales it will and is starting to yield nio just unveiled the type of tech that will have the same impact and comparing their growth story and sales levels to tsla it is obvious that nio should be waaaay higher not tsla levels but it should get to about 175 eoy it is not a matter of tsla vs nio it is tsla  nio vs the ice companies who are five years behind nio and tesla on the tech the long drive to 175 starts monday

on saturday ark published an update to its tesla tsla 029 valuation model saying it now expects the stock to be worth 7000 by 2024 — and thats the base case in a bull case tesla shares would trade at or above 15000 the bear case puts the stock at 1500 or about 25 times current trading levels
up 50 to 60 billion in a day market cap exceeds entire industry yup totally reasonable no risk here
investors business daily is a reliable resource for market news and analysis of stock charts ibd says that tesla has just experienced a climax run in trading just last week alone the stock is up 25 or 175 in the last 4 weeks its up from about 600 to 880 yes by definition thats a climax run which is doomed to correct substantially its not just the chart competition is and will be continue to be a major headwind  there are a lot of ev players in china and then you have vw and other us car companies theres absolutely no barrier to entry in this space tesla sells low margin cars and their profit is based on regulatory credits a correction to 650675 may be reasonable for starters
if only they could get the panel gap corrected everyone complains about that and its easy to fix
nio now has better batteries than tsla which can also retrospectively be upgraded in older cars within 5min better cameras for autonomous by about 6x lidar which tesla doesnt use nio has without question positioned itself as the pure ev play for anyone wishing to invest in the worlds biggest ev market not li or xpeng

tesla is five years ahead of the competition ok so at a 40 growth rate yoy in five years that means tesla will have to deliver just under 2 million vehicles to sustain its current growth at 100kaverage selling price very unlikely per vehicle that is only 192 billion in saleshow can this company be worth this much if in five years when competition catches up theyll only be able to produce and deliver 200 billion worth of salesmeanwhile ford has capacity and sales to deliver 66 million vehicles and investors dont care
the day tsla crashes will be the day the entire market crashes because so many people will be panic selling everything else thinking it the end of the bubble tesla became god of the stock market thoughts lol
in 2021 tsla will lead the ev tech advancement and nio is aggressively working hard to follow crypto will slowly become an important digital currency and sq will grow with it afordable energy storage for microgrid will be provided by eose and they will be the key for power grid electrification
tesla likely hit a peak friday or it could keep rising for huge gains for a few more days with even bigger daily point gains selling at the very peak of a climax top is essentially the great fishing story for investors many will claim it few will achieve itinvestors may want to sell some tesla stock into strength because when a climax top occurs shares can fall to earth even faster than they riseafter a climax run stocks often suffer huge declines that take years to recover from qualcomm qcom finally surpassed its 2000 climax top peak last yeartesla stock had a climaxtype run in late 2019 to early 2020 peaking on feb 4 at a splitadjusted 19380 shares then plunged 64 to 7010 on march 18 with the coronavirus market crash no doubt contributing to the lossesperhaps tesla stock will have a climax top sell off and rebound rather quickly once again but do you want to sit through a 30 50 80 decline on hopes for a rebound if tesla stock corrects or crashes and then bounces back investors can always buy it back after the coronavirus crash tesla stock offered buying opportunities slightly below and above the february peak

watch out the bears are standing behind teslas in the dark so they can buy some shares when the price is at 3400
im outas a shorti cant do itthis makes no senseand i think i timed my entry into the short incorrectlyor there is really is something about this company which i fundamentally dont understandmy best wishes to all longs who have been correct on this all year longand even more so today i was wrong
people need to realize that tsla is truly a life time opportunity to buy in to a company that is literally changing the world for the better over the years people have dreamed of getting in to companies like microsoft and amazon that have changed our lives today this dream is a reality if you have the stones to buck the naysayers and embrace a great company with an incredible visionary leader for those of you who look at the financials of tsla and claim that we are in a bubble take a second to research the pe ratios of amzn and fb earlier on when they were establishing their foundations for success you will find that amazon had a pe of over 3700 and fb over 1400 there are many examples of extremely high pe ratios for companies starting out that went on to change the way you navigate in this world tsla is only in the 2nd inning of this ball game stay strong bulls and don’t let the shorts make you look in the rear view mirror some day and regret your decisions merry christmas

i have extended my short exposure massivlythe bubble actually stops and we will see abutting never seen at wallstreettesla to produce 800 million carspe is often used as a realistic barometer of a companies value with an auto producer that pe could be extended to cars produced for example toyota produced 88 million cars last year to achieve earnings their pe is 921 this indicates that toyota needs to produce 88 million cars times 921 years of earnings to meet market cap this total is 81480000 vehiclestesla produced 500000 cars last year their pe is 1628 and this is not a fully diluted pe multiply the two and the total is 814 million cars fully diluted and this number nears 900 million there is not enough raw material capacity to achieve this in the next 10 years world auto production in 2019 was 91786861 tesla at their present margin ratios which would include the sale of regulatory credits would need to sell every car in the world for 10 years to have a pe similar to toyota the tesla market cap is absurd at best buy it now and you will pay a hefty price in the next few years
not enough tsla stock to go around  a few weeks ago i wrote how tesla being in the sp now locks up about 150 mil shares in mutual funds that basically take it out of circulation there are probably more funds that also buy and hold cramer said on cnbc that there are not enough stocks to invest in so the high demand and low supply is making the price go up i agree with him completely if you had money you want to invest  what would you buy not money markets not bonds you buy stocks of course but which ones  you buy tesla of course and since there are less sellers  the price goes up
go cover your positions tesla shorties unless you like losing money
elon is playing with the shorts tesla deliveries have already crossed 500000 for the year i placed my order just today

going to add another 17 shares tomorrow leading up to earnings
while teslas 499550 vehicle deliveries technically fall just shy of its 500000 target they are close enough to highlight teslas staggering growth and to suggest that the electric car maker was able to achieve some of the improvements in logistics and delivery efficiency at higher volumes that it was aiming for
