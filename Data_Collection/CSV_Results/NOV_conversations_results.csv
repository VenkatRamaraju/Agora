"Sell the Company to a dividend paying company. This is a bag holders turd of a stock, and I'm tired of holding it at a loss."

Hopefully this is a start to take us to new all time highs.....
NOV is down 10.83% to $33.00
I'm still waiting for a buyout.
This price is lower than 2007. over 10 years. How are there no changes? Where are the Icahn's. Sell this damn company.
With the coronavirus in China bring the oil price down I think NOV will break below the $21.22 support soon.
"If you can't short it, you better buy it! OR just watch it fly high! AMEN"
National Oilwell Varco is down 10.11% to 9.42
National Oilwell Varco is up 6.66% to 14.48
I am sick of all the plugs for awesome stocks and the other bull s!!! posts of people who are promoting these sites. Yahoo should every one of them. Free advertising for this #$%$.
"The ""GreenNewDeal"" Train has left the station:)"
Nov has been lagging the industry despite having one of the strongest balance sheets out there.
"wow , now thats a lot of loss"
NOV is down 4.91% to 27.89
Oil up will move NOV up along with NG prices with all the bad weather.
still a huge miss. only good if oil recovers..
BUYOUT!!!!!
This is easily going back up to 60 like it happened before. Glad it's going up means more oil work also.
5 yr low. what the hell
"This company used to be a fantastic investment. I've never seen it with earnings -$15.00 eps. I know there are some serious pro investors on this board. Please tell me, is this company going under?"
"NOV is a roller coaster special. Big ups, big downs. But more downs than ups."
This stock is permanently disabled and will never recover imo. it will forever hover around the mid teens
"Don't let them fool you into selling. At $13.2 NOV is the *only* oil stock that has a potential to double within the next 12 months, even if oil prices just remain at current levels ~$60. It is dirt cheap and there is large pent up demand for its products/services, which will materialize later in the year. Mark my words: NOV @26 in a year, if oil just remains around $60. None of the other stocks that I follow will double, even those that I highly recommended in the past. For example, HP and SLB will not be at $54, HFC will not be at $70, BP will not be at $49. The only other stocks with a double potential is PBF but that is a very high risk/reward stock, unlike NOV which has a strong balance sheet and generated $700 million in FCF last year, despite the worse year for the oil industry. Load up right here around $13."
still my #1 garbage stock. Sell the company to one of the big boys.
Is all the bad news baked in?
oil prices fall on friday ~~ nov trading up....production increase expected as the US exits the Paris agreement....nov benefits from this increase in production and i believe is the reason we moved higher on friday...
don't wait until this stock pops to jump in; I’ll just keep loading up here and sell them back later at a much higher price as usual
"Those who are selling didn't bother to read: ""The combination of $60+ oil, the continued recovery in the North American rig count, improvements in international activity, and the emergence of a number of our offshore drilling customers from bankruptcy is expected to lead to meaningfully better results in the second half of the year."""
Is Buffet buying back in?
the stock is at a decade low and yet Clay Williams got paid $13.8 million last year. anyone have a problem with that? punch up a long term chart and see if you can come to grips with the shareholder destruction that has occurred while this management team has been at the helm.
get rid of this stock
"Lift off?? God I need this to start moving up. Underwater!! Buy some companies, get bought out. Do something for crying out loud. Where's the insider buying?"
NOV reached a new 52 Week High at 47.89
hammer time
"I KNOW THE CEO KEEPS SAYING THEY WILL CUT COST BUT I JUST DON'T UNDERTAND HOW HAL A 23BILLION COMPANY HAS 60K EMPLOYEES AND SLB A 55 BILLION COMPANY HAS 100K EMPLOYEES BUT NOV A 9BILLION COMPANY HAS 34,220 EMPLOYEES"
NOV is down 10.11% to 9.42
"I was speaking to a trader this morning, things are too quiet for gold. A woof in sheep's cloathing. America has the last word on North Korea."
NOV is down 5.77% to 21.38
crazy... Moodies! downgrade to bbb2! and stock goes up. I guess options squeeze.
"Why not a Buy out, at this price levels before it goes higher"
"I think the new tax law impacted NOV's first quarter. The new tax law allows immediate expensing of capital equipment purchases, effective January 1st. If companies were thinking about ordering equipment from NOV in November or December, they obviouslywould have held off to see if they would have gotten a way bigger tax deal in 2018, and they did.So, if orders from November/December were pushed to January/February, NOV wouldn't have had enoughtime to build that equipment and book it as revenue in Q1. I also think those delays will just add to pent-up demand and compound the orders into 2018. Indeed, NOV's CEO characterized the dearth of revenue as a temporary thing, consistent with what I'msuggesting."
why the big drop afterhours?
National Oilwell Varco is down 25.89% to 11.62
"I must be The only bag holder. This has broken the old low, I think we may test, or come close to the low at the end of the energy crash. This completely sux!!"
Added some more at $11.25. I suspect the selloff is based on some short term nonsense. I look at 12 - 24 month time range and the fact that NOV generated $380 billion in operating cash flow in the worst quarter ever for the oil industry. You will easily see double from these levels if you just have patience and look at the longer term.
"I sold this, but the play should have been sell at $24-$25, buy in the $21's, repeat, repeat, repeat...."
"This sort of revenue pre-announcement is always rough and comes on the heels of a not so good previous quarter.To my way of thinking, NOV is famous for being ultra-informative. The revenue miss is bad but it is likely that people are more upset about the ""Opaque"" statement - The truth sucks but it isn't the end of the world.Perhaps a mistake, but I am staying long; this money may be locked up for a while, but this does not seem to be a case of NOV losing to an emerging competitor.If I owned BHGE (which has held up this morning), I would be selling them right @#$^* now. I wonder what their put premiums look like."
"Please sell the company, make an aquisition, or raise the dividend. I'm officially sick of being a bag holder."

National Oilwell Varco is up 14.56% to 10.31
This stock is soooo predictable...it hits a newer high and rolls right back down into $1150 - $12.50 range...
Fire the Board!
"The 3 analyst who updated their view following the report, have an average price target of $15. So why are people selling at half the price? This market is crazy bearish - lost all connection to reality."
"The analyst had his so-wrong with X, and are still trying to predict lower ESP. Buy, SLB, and NOV are going to be popping, could squeeze"
"In the call, outlook for 3rd and 4th Q to decline. Hence the drop!"
"New global oil discoveries are at 70 year lows. Oil companies are coming up far, far short of replacing the depletion they are experiencing out of their existing reserves. When this oil glut ends, it's going to end with a bang, and once it does, it's going to take years for new drilling to bring new supplies up and running to replace continued depletion. This glut is like water rising behind a cracking dam. The higher the water rises as the glut continues, the bigger the flood is going to be once it breaks. The longer the glut persists, the more a company like National Oilwell Varco will benefit once it breaks... and the break is inevitable."
National Oilwell Varco is down 6.14% to 16.96
"BASX (Basic energy services) The market cap of this company is mind boggling at 6.5mil with the stock trading at .29 compared to what’s its actually worth. Just the 860 million NOL (carry forward losses for tax purpose) would save a larger company like $SLB $NOV $BHGE 180 million alone plus the almost 60 million in cash and their water midstream unit is worth at least 350 plus million.They are expected to be cash flow positive this quarter of about 5-8 million which is the total market cap right now! Capex ex is minimal going forward. Never in my life have I’ve never seen such a disparity between market cap and what the company should be trading at and NOT a measly 6.5 mill market cap make ZERO sense. 850 million plus in revenues and been signing big contracts in last few weeks with oil rising Add recent sale of unprofitable biz between 40-75 mil which is outstanding, potentially another $3-5 mil buyback new CEO which is second to none in industry This should be $7.00-$9.00 Plus a share easy."

chapter 11 on the horizon
Hopefully bottomed out
"Based on the graph, it's the same price as it was in 2008. That's pathetic."
How is this worth 10% gain on 21 million in profit for a 18 billion company??? insane
"WOW! I can,t believe what a buying situation we have. I didn't think we would see 42 again, at this price and the pick up in oil production,$55 is not far away."
When it hit's 52 week low I'm in
"It appears to me that US is at Cold War II w China and Russia and the main tool is oil prices... so prepare for a ride. Before Iraq war we clearly saw end of oil, now we clearly see only horizon... meanwhile gasoline prices are same."

I am not sure how much value this management team is willing to lose without the board of director doing something about it. They are sure not working for investors. Too bad....
NOV is down 4.93% to 26.52
UGH...Another great day for people like me who are still stuck with this.. Holding...But painful ..
I continue to not understand NOV share price. They have an excellent balance sheet compared to competitors whose prices are sky rocketing. This is a very well managed company being punished for some reason.
NOV GAPPING HIGHER TAKING OFF

21 hours ago someone wrote that this stock will pop out... and it will be big time. Thanks man. :))) You should be ordained as priest.
"Just bought back into good, old, All American, no nonsense, NOV!! I've been waiting patiently for a bottom to form. Dollar appears to have more weakness going forward and oil looks like it want to continue to rally. NOV has a nice chunk of King Cash on its balance sheet. Stock is worth a minimum of 35 bucks. Nice entry point today around 27.30."
"mindful, NOV doesn't do divs as long as no payouts keeps their shirts on NOV's back. investor shirts, well that's another story. grasp fact newb, buying oil patch is dicey, and especially now. buying the patch and not even earning a dividend for the very risky long hold, is bonkers. comments here are for amusement only."
going to be ugly today after the pre announcement
still nothing from this lousy board of directors! And now the math has changed again for the worse with the price of oil down 5%. wonder what they are waiting for? we need activist investors to throw this board of directors out restructure the company. the cost structure is insane!
I hope they are buying back shares under 30.
NOV is down 4.93% to 21.60
"The drop in the dollar should lift oil. Not sure it's a 100% correlation with NOV, but it seems like it is."
"$700 million in FCF in 2020 - that's the takeaway number from the earnings report. That means that in the worst year for the industry on record, NOV generated $700 million in free cash flow, a number that will only grow as the industry recovers over the next year. That means improved balance sheet, improved liquidity and financial and operational flexibility. NOV is currently trading at around 7 x FCF - dirt cheap."
Earning missed expectations. Outlook dismal. Same old strategy to pump the price up during after hour and pre-market trading while the volume is light.
any idea who is looking to buyout NOV. Rumor has the bid for NOV at $43. Does not seem like enough to me
capex comentary from hal and slb not good for nov
"Even during the most horrendous quarter for the oil industry, NOV generated $380 in operating cash flow! That bodes very well for the future when the industry recovers. NOV is on my list of stocks that will double within 1 -2 years. I recommended it when it was trading at $12. Additional potential doubles: HP, BP, PBF (the latter I recommended a smaller than average position because of its leverage and higher risk)."
Where are the earnings?
NOV is down 5.68% to 20.41
Been a roller coaster been making out on puts and calls on this one!
I sold a quarter of my position at $17.7 - even though I do believe we will see $20+ before the end of the year. Just being cautious. Oil services stocks are now overbought - we were at $13 less than a month ago. If you are a long term investors you shouldn't care.
Finally!!! Let's hope it's finally turned the corner and heads back up above $50
I’m baking up the truck at $0.50. -0.05 EPS last I checked. OTC NOV. Here we come.
Looks like they want to run this back up into the $29 range this week. Institutions wanted your shares CHEAPPPPPPPPPPP

Warned you guys...
NOV is down 15.23% to 8.63
If we finish the year at a similar sp to the start of the year I feel the bear trend in the sp has ended so with all the chopping and changing within the organization I believe the sp has hit the floor and hopefully price of oil shall start on an upward trend in 2020 pulling the NOV sp with it lots of potential for the future.
What wrong with this stock? up one day and down for the next 4 days?

NOV reached a 52 Week low at $25.97
Do SOMETHING with the cash.
"management owns less than 1% of this company. why is that? why did management get 100% bonuses last year? the annual meeting is next tues may 28th. if you want to see what a fat and happy board of directors looks like, then attend this meeting. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! they are using the company's piggy bank and stock to enrich themselves while taking on no risk themselves! UH HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM! BLACKROCK, get off your rear end and start putting pressure on these guys. there needs to be some urgency here. compare the cost structure to their competitors and you will be astonished at how out of whack NOV's is."
upper 50 dollar range my opinion
$21 Tomorrow
"18 Million+ shares on the buy side, $58 target seems low. Can't wait for the rig count!!!!"
Rumors of a buyout!!!!
NOV should not be reacting to the price of oil each day. What a joke.The company is off and running now and drillers are drilling.
"Bought yesterday and will buy more over time. Do me a favor next time you drive your car, or get something delivered, or run your electricity, or lather your hair with shampoo or pack the kids lunch in tupperware or apply mascara, etc, try doing it without oil and oil byproducts. We all work for big oil in one way or another. Buy while the hipster apocalypse has everyone believing in absolute rubbish."

"NOV will go BK. Change of Directors and hiring of New Management Consulting firm is what to look for.Usually 16 Months after public knowledge of these simple actions, BK filing will be initiated and accepted.Not even worth selling so we'll all go down together.I wish I knew what merger could happen but that usually ends up the same way. For example ESV."
"If you are watching this today, the range is staying tight between $12.10 and $11.95 which is good. Over the holiday weekend come Tuesday, there will be good demand from oil being talked about and other good positive influences for getting the economy on track. Who knows I would not be surprised if the stock finished around $12.25 today. Then that gives me more confidence that come Tuesday ...we see it hit $13.00"
Wow look at MU now after falling so much. We need to keep on keeping on
"$1.20 away from $14 Not much distance. This stock can do it in 1 day...Looking to sell tomorrow maybe....bad thing is oil report will be out after 4:00pm and then in the am on Thursday for the EIA. Since this stock has been running erratic, but fairly predictable. I am thinking it could hit 14 and drop back. One of these days there will be a run up of at least $5 and I would hate to miss that. It seems like NOV and BKR are running in tandem. Kind of weird"

"Here are the results of the OPEC agreement today:They have agreed to cut production by 1.2 million barrels a day, beginningin January. Translation: They will be producing like a bat-outta-hell all through December. There are no provisions to ensure compliance. Translation: They'll all produce whatever the hell they want to producebeginning in January.Every ""cut"" that OPEC has ever enacted has been followed up on withreports estimating how much they're all cheating on the cuts. EVERYTHING that OPEC does is designed to jawbone oil prices higher.Show me one time that OPEC has ever actually cut production, aside fromthe late 1970s, and I'll eat my gas cap."

National Oilwell Varco reached a 52 Week low at 17.33
"Management change needed urgently! I have spent years analyzing companies and can tell you with certainty that NOV's cost structure is way out of whack. the stock is at a multi-year low yet management shows no urgency to implement the hard changes that need to be taken. The board of directors needs to do its job and fire top management and replace them with guys who are filled with bs! Urgency needs to be shown yesterday, yet we keep getting a bunch of nothing! If the board of directors cannot act quickly on this, then we need to replace the board of directors. It's that simple. this used to be a viable company, but not anymore. With facility consolidation and a 20% headcount reduction, we can bring the cost structure back in line and return this company to meaningful profitability. I understand that the market is a bit soft for their products right now but that notwithstanding, this company should be consistently profitable. Management is getting fat and happy on our dime. Time to throw them out!"
full alert. WFT
NOV will start moving soon as all these rigs are starting to fall apart and need new parts.
"Nice move up today, I hope we see more of it tomorrow!"
"At $12.5 NOV is once again a BUY. As long as WTI stays above $50, the industry should recover nicely and so will NOV."
"NOV is one of the few energy stocks that has quite of upside left, just to catch up with its peers. It should be trading at $18 - $20, just to catch up in the short term, if oil prices remain stable around $60. I recently turned neutral and even bearish on some of the oil stocks that have overshot and become overbought/overpriced for this stage in the recovery. NOV is not one of them. Still bullish short term."
"Look at the one year chart, beating thru the 50 day and 200 day moving average. Chart the high and low trend lines. Have a nice weekend !!!!!"

10 year low - ouch!
"For an industry that has been increasing demand steadily for the last 7 months and whose price has been increasing for the last 7 months, it's strange that NOV and oil and general would be so volatile."
Look at the Normalized EBITDA on the financials. This company was in trouble long before Covid.
"Woooooow, what a turnaround from where it opened (and yesterday in AH trading!!). Must be combo oil down 3%, plus something they said on conference call."

"This professional portfolio manager is very excited about $NOV:""We recently took a position in National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:$NOV), which is a provider of capital equipment for oil and gas exploration. And National Oilwell Varco has really been consolidating the industry over the past decade-plus. They are really the one big player in a couple of other end markets, and one of those is rig technologies, which is really equipment packages for offshore and land-based drilling rigs.""https://www.twst.com/interview/taking-the-emotion-out-of-the-investing-process"
Just like clock work....price dropped from the morning highs around 1130am and hovered through lunch time....and then retraced on a steady climb back up. Looking good!
NOV is down -5.33% to 38.74
"Thought WTI was going back to 55 bucks. That looks unlikely at this juncture so just got back into good, old, NOV!! If I'm wrong about oil (could be if the dollar rallies, or if Venezuala starts producing again, or if frackers pump even more oil), then oil will collapse down to 50 or 55 bucks, and I double down on NOV. Can't lose, Can't lose!!!"
"Does anyone have any idea why NOV is up over 7% today? I'm not complaining, I just can't find any reason why. Thanks."

"Patient investors might find BOARF of interest at its current price. SEI Investments holds 275,000,000 sharesper Yahoo ""Holders"" column."
NOV and USG should both start paying that div again and then I'm in.
This should open up 10% on these earnings.
This is crazy. What is the board of director doing? THEY HAVE TO CUT COST!
NOV reached a 52 Week low at 10.78
There is an outside chance NOV will get delisted as TSLA gets enlisted. I guess it would be a changing of the guard and we're all about the cheap marketing stunt these days.
NOV is up 4.90% to 21.83
Fire the board and CEO. Sell this company now.
Brutal day.
"the weak first qtr is already in the stock. the stock is greatly lagging the recent upturn in oil from $50 to $60. This stock is about to pop big time. 1st qtr conference call is going to be very bullish. NOV has a great balance sheet, is buying back stock, and has a great opportunity with Saudi Arabia that will begin to ramp up big time as the year progresses. The stock is being left for dead but the fundamentals have already turned. it's classic Wall Street. buy it on the cheap today!"
"Saudi Oil Minister proclaims: #$%$ Y**, Iran. Produce whatever the hell youwant to and we'll pump full-out too and just SEE how your sanction-free productionholds up once Donald Trump gets through with feeding your deal with Obamathrough his Shredmaster (TM) brand paper shredder.The only thing that's more rare than OPEC agreeing to production cuts isOPEC actually ABIDING by cuts, once they've pledged them...... something that has never actually happened."
NOV is down 6.14% to 16.96
if nov is overvalued the whole oil service sector should bow down to nov
NOV reached a new 52 Week High at 45.73
I believe an 11 year low.
THE CEO OF NOV NEEDS TO CONTROL COST OR THIS STOCK WILL NEVER GO UP IN VALUE. WE ARE LOWER TODAY THAN IN 2016. CRAZY!
This stock just keeps falling. Will it ever rebound again?
National Oilwell Varco is down 10.47% to 11.63

"When will insiders start buying shares? How much time will it take for this ""Cycle"" to end? Getting impatient. Time for an outsider to come in, get a seat on the board and have the company sold. Seems like they are not buying any companies, and just cutting costs and waiting for the cycle to end. That's not a pro growth strategy. Would like to see some positive action, and insider buying to show support."
NOV is up 5.24% to 21.77
"you want another Big Oil stock check out reconnaissance energy Africa LTD. Junior oil company has 8 million Acres over in nambia own 90% And just prove their first well. I made $50,000 off of it in less than a year."

These guys give free jars and massive discounts On there products  junk company and Not a short btw!! Lol
National Oilwell Varco reached a 52 Week low at 7.78
NOV didn't fall nearly as much as many of the big oil plays did today. Seems like a good sign.
"Put yourself up for sale already. This stock has done nothing but lose money for shareholders. In fact, it has done nothing for shareholders. Only self interest. For the board. Garbage!"
NOV is headed back to $60+ in the next year. If Venezuela gets squeezed out maybe $80. Lots of rigs will be updated or replaced.
NOV is up 5.16% to 20.16
"not in it...but familiar with company...2011 to 2015 they where indispencsible in the bakken.... I'm thinking the margins have goten so tight on the production side, it is killing the services players.....want to filter in some ..but don't trust the div. till E÷P come back..."
Does this stock ever go up? It is a serious drag on my portfolio.
"Between oil declining today and the shorter who are going to hammer this down I'd be cautious with the current PPS, inflated and comes down twice as fast as it goes up"
Activepennystocks too. More bull s!!! promoting.
When are the damn earnings released? Suspense!!!
This is garbage! 3rd qtr result just released below 2nd qtr guidance. Not improved like HAL and SLB. High risk of its debts declared junk. Sell.
The management needs to cut cost or this stock will stay at this price for years to come! If they cut cost the stock would be much higher at this point in the cycle.
Anyone listen to the conference call?
NOV to Buy Diamond Offshore Merger ALERTS
"We are looking goooood for Tuesday. The stock held tight, without a big huge drop going into the long weekend. If any oil related news happens on the weekend, stock will be ready to react on Tuesday. Much good news on the economy reopening in more locations will be in the news, and oil storage will likely show a bigger drop at Cushing on Wednesday via API or Thursday via EIA. People have more time to mull over stocks to buy for Tuesday, as well as institutional buyers adjusting portfolio's. I would be somewhat disappointed to not see NOV and BKR move higher. At least $13.25"
"National Oilwell Varco EPS in-line, beats on revenuehttp://www.seekingalpha.com/news/3328269"
Another reason YAHOO finance target prices are not worth the paper they are written on.
NOV is up 10.51% to 9.36
Hard to beleive we have no one following this stock....NOV and BKR has quite of bit of upward room to move.
Weather and covid are temporary. Use the dip to buy more. $20+ before year end. There is a lot of pent up demand for NOV products/services due to low spendings in 2020.
"Last time oil was at this level, NOV was way higher. What is going on?"
"If this goes below $20, is there a law about mailing poo to the board of directors, attn. CEO?"
National Oilwell Varco is down 9.26% to 10.97

So much for that. Revenue warming? this stock sucks the big one. For the CEO. Get this sold. Garbage
NOV reached a new 52 Week High at 42.69
"With increasing presence of Electric Vehicles, especially Tesla, which reduces demand for crude oils. Oil prices will likely remain low for very long time. As a result, there is less incentive for drillers to drill new oil wells and invest in drilling equipment providers like NOV. A trade shorting NOV and longing TSLA will likely be profitable."
This stock sucks and I'm a bag holder....
I told you...
Delete every one of them.
NOV reached a 52 Week low at 20.57

Here come the buy out's. Hopefully NOV is on the block.
Going back to March 18th on this stock look at the 3 or 6 month graph.....the lowest lows keep getting higher and higher. And the price swings throughout the day can be as great as $1 or more. Its impossible to not make money on this stock provided you watch it carefully and hit it at the right point.
"***** has anyone heard any rumor about results in the field for the E-FRAC system with their partner, NEX?? Should have results by now........maybe they will save it for the next conference call....*****deepsub"
"real ? is when oil will go up..... based on media : never, because if oil price up than US shale is up and again we go down.... Any thoughts?"
NOV is up 4.91% to 27.78
National Oilwell Varco is up 9.76% to 16.92
Overbought. I can still see my message here from less than a month ago when NOV was at $8. Now at $14 it is 75% higher. Congratulations longs. Long term still looks good however short term most oil stocks are now overbought. The effects of the vaccine on the bottom line will take at least a year. Between now and then we have at least 2 more bad quarters for the oil industry.
Is NOV really that dependent on offshore that they need $80+/barrel to move the needle? This is painful.
"I talked to a long-time resident of oil & gas country in Eastern NM. Been through a lot of energy cycles. This person thinks this one is about to turn. One person's opinion, so do your own due diligence. I'll probably add to NOV if in the low 30s."
Every month 1 or 3 messages :) Hot stock :(

"I have voted Williams and, in fact, the majority of the board OUT each of the past three years as this once proud company continued to plummet. They continue to be there! WHAT ELSE MUST BE DONE TO GET THEM OUT??!! Do we need to go so far as to contact the SEC and other regulatory agencies to investigate them and intercede???!! They are LITERALLY FINANCIALLY DESTROYING SHAREHOLDERS WITH THEIR INCOMPETENCE AND INDIFFERENCE. This is BEYOND immoral and Unethical. SOMETHING MUST BE DONE BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!!!"
ment 17 year low on share price
"good report, much improvement over last quarter. on the way back."
"Sweet Jesus, they finally announced a share repurchase of $500 million in Nov 6th. Finally!!!! At least it's something."
17 year on share price
Rumor has NOV buying Denali fiberglass. Here is another fiberglass company they will ruin.
"How many companies do you know that amidst the worst slump in the industry's history, not only are not issuing debt / using additional financing, but actually using their massive cash flow to buy back their bonds? I think NOV's conservative approach to dividend payment and focus on improving the balance sheet is going to pay off big time one the industry recovers. Definitely one of my top picks - easily a triple from here ($8) when cv is history and the oil industry recovers."
"As the oil prices stabilize, we should see oil companies invest in capital equipment which should go well for companies like NOV."
According to Buffet people will not fly means they will drive. Buy VLO and psx
