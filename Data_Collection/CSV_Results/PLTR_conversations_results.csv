"Oh look, it's a tech crash! More BS from the media, funneled to them by hedge funds. Watch things quickly rebound and then will come the inane excuses for the turnaround, meanwhile it's just plain old market manipulation. Shaking out weak hands and making a profit on the way down, then back up."

Where is Cathie to pump?
"To all those who complain about the payments to the company's managers,I would like to present a different opinion.Hope you find the words worthy of an appropriate response.The people you complain about are on the edge of the edge of the quality that can be found.They have been setting up a technology venture for 17 years.During this time they could make tens of millions of dollars a year !!!In any technological organization they would just like.Such human quality is rare and therefore required at all costs.Any salary and benefit that comes to mind, they can receive. In any organization.What are you complaining about?These people gave their best years, energy and talent, while taking a huge risk to their name and livelihood.now,When the company can pay (yes also from the investors' money) they are worthy of reward. Before everyone else.The fact that we have now, recently, invested several thousand dollars in the stock, does not give us the right, at least in my opinion, to complain about their compensation policy.I feel like my investment is being managed by the best of the best on the planet.All that is left is to wait patiently, support and make a profit. A very large profit. We will not invest or wait 17 years.That's my opinion. Correct me if I'm wrong.English is not my first language, apologize in advance for errors"

"From Motley Fool today. Good reading. Famed stock picker Peter Lynch offered investors this wisdom: Buy what you know, research what you plan to buy, and adopt a long-term mindset. That's great advice. When you buy a stock, you buy a portion of the underlying business. It doesn't make sense to buy a business you don't understand -- that's basically gambling.In my experience, one of the easiest ways to learn about a business is to research how its products are used in real-world scenarios. For instance, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) both provide some pretty complicated technology, but it's easier to grasp when you consider how these companies have aided the fight against COVID-19. Here's what investors should know.NVIDIA: SupercomputingNVIDIA provides graphics processing units (GPUs) and high-performance networking solutions designed to make data centers faster. The company also provides pre-trained AI models and frameworks across a range of industries, allowing developers and researchers to build intelligent applications.NVIDIA headquarters building facade.IMAGE SOURCE: NVIDIAFor instance, NVIDIA Clara is designed for healthcare, using artificial intelligence to improve drug discovery, medical imaging, and genomic analysis, and to create smart hospitals.Using NVIDIA Clara, a research team from the University of California at San Diego won a Gordon Bell Prize for their research on COVID-19. Specifically, they blended AI and high-performance computing to create the clearest picture to date of the coronavirus. NVIDIA GPUs made it possible to pack twice as much data into the image as any prior simulation in molecular dynamics. One researcher called the visualization ""critical for vaccine design,"" for both COVID-19 and future pathogens.Additionally, NVIDIA assisted the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in building AI models to improve tracking, testing, and treatment of COVID-19. Specifically, the models were trained on data from high-infection-rate locations, enabling them to accurately diagnose coronavirus cases from lung scans.More recently, the Argonne National Laboratory announced that researchers would be using 24 NVIDIA DGX A100 systems -- supercomputers designed for artificial intelligence -- to accelerate the discovery of COVID-19 drug therapies.Of course, these examples illustrate how NVIDIA can dramatically impact healthcare, supercharging research efforts and medical imaging. But on a higher level, they demonstrate NVIDIA's critical role in addressing computationally complex problems. That value extends beyond medicine into areas like smart retail, manufacturing, robotics and autonomous vehicles, and virtual reality and graphics -- as well as other scientific domains like space exploration.Palantir: Data analyticsPalantir specializes in big data analytics. The company's software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms help clients manage, integrate, and draw insights from massive data sets. As a result, Palantir has played an important role in helping government and healthcare agencies combat the coronavirus.Imagine trying to coordinate the delivery of medical supplies and personal protective equipment -- face masks, gloves, gowns, and hand sanitizer -- across thousands of healthcare institutions, each with rapidly changing levels of supply and demand. That's the type of problem Palantir's software was designed to solve.Person viewing a map of interconnected data points.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGESMedical suppliers use the Palantir Foundry platform to monitor global supply chains, allowing them to identify potential shortages and work proactively to prevent problems. Similarly, public health agencies use Palantir to track the spread of the virus, assess the effectiveness of response strategies, and collaborate with hospitals and suppliers.In the U.K., Palantir has helped the National Health Service (NHS) coordinate its vaccine effort. Facing a logistics nightmare, the NHS selected Foundry to simplify ordering, allocation, tracking, and delivery of over 29 million doses of COVID vaccine.Palantir has also played an important role in the U.S. vaccine effort. Its platform has powered the integration of data from government agencies, drug manufacturers, and distributors, then referenced that data against demographic, employment, and public health information, allowing officials to allocate vaccine doses efficiently and effectively.In fact, during Palantir's most recent earnings call, Global Head of Business Development Keven Kawasaki noted that the company helped the U.K. and U.S. run ""two of the most successful vaccination programs in the world.""In general, these examples highlight Palantir's ability to improve healthcare by enabling data-driven decision-making. But that value proposition is applicable to virtually every industry, and it should help Palantir grow its business in the coming years."
All the way down to $16 let's face it guys the market has crashed and it's still dropping the market has been falling since November and all we were hearing was that people are just taking profit's but it doesn't take 6 months to make profits from $44 to $19 pltr has dropped over 60% and analysts say pltr lowest is $15 I won't sell because my average is $12.14 I know that pltr will reach above $50 this year if the shorts ar pushed out I would much prefer a 1% price increase rather than the 5 & 10% increases that we've seen
"The number of institutions buying this stock growing every single week! from over 200 to over 550 and still coming... wait until we have over 1000 institution buyers holding PLTR this will be great... I'm only buying doesn't matter how low I will keep adding, this is a life time opportunity!"

"S1: Foundry opportunity""Market OpportunityWe estimate the total addressable market (“TAM”) for our software across the commercial and government sectors around the world to be approximately $119 billion. For purposes of estimating the TAM in the commercial and government sectors, we exclude institutions in countries or regions where we have chosen not to sell our software.CommercialOur estimate of the TAM in the commercial sector is $56 billion.This estimate is arrived at by multiplying the number of potential customers around the world — defined broadly as approximately 6,000 companies with more than $500 million in annual revenue — by an assumed annual contract value for each potential commercial customer based on organization size and our internal data of existing customer spending.We developed further support for this estimate by analyzing third-party industry estimates of projected spending in the software categories we believe our platforms address. Over the years, we have expanded our platforms into new product categories, increasing their potential value across our existing and potential customer base. Our market opportunity has increased as a result. Our software platforms address a broad range of requirements within organizations, including data management, integration and orchestration, application development, security, system and service management, analytics and artificial intelligence, supply chain management, enterprise resource management, and content and workflow management. We estimate, based on data from International Data Corporation, that global spending in the subset of these software categories that we believe our platforms address will be approximately $158 billion in 2020."

Remember the more cheering leaders pumping good news here the more it falls
One has to wonder about employee retention at this point since many haven’t been able to cash out and see execs worth billions and they drive the stock down because of their greed.
How long do we have to wait.....
1 thing about pltr is they can't report all new contracts because of security. there will be massive revenues reported that the dpsht analysts have no clue about.
Are shorts still in denial?
How can one be bearish on PLTR with all these new clients and good growth?
This is going to $12 tomorrow

Very soon we will see Q1 and then understand what CW is seeing.
PLTR has stoped falling to new lows. My guess is that this week it will start picking up and move to around 35$ by the end of the month... thoughts?

This is so weak can't even break $19 now. Last week it was at $23. It's a really bad sign for this
picked this up yesterday and added more BOXL shares..happy day
Cathie just keeps buying 
"Here’s my tale. Invested in this last November and added as it dropped for months. Very difficult but held even through the 11 day dump. Yesterday morning after dropping from +10% to 2% my nerve broke finally and cashed in with 30% loss. Then it took off. Annoys me that I endured for so long, another day may hav made the difference. Moral for me is you have to be tough trading and I nearly had that toughness. Best of luck to the longs here."
i like the revenue growth but the increase in cost is doubled while the revenue has only grow 50%.. its the only thing that worries me

Hope everyone booked their ticket to the moon. All aboard.

PLTR trends down without news.
"If you read the Dec 2020 report, Palantir disclosed the 67 million options CEO holds set to expire Dec 2021. They also disclosed that he may need to sell to pay taxes. If he exercised when vested, California would have gotten 13.3% of his capital gains. Colorado will get about 4.65%. Federal taxes are going to take about 20%. So Karp will have to sell close to 13.5 million shares or lose the money. As far as financial statements, Palantir would have taken the hit when shares were vested- probably between 2016-2020 and the amount would have been about $100 million. Stock compensation expense for going forward would be about $300 million per year compared to $ 1.2 billion we took in 2020."
"holy moly, when you look at 6 month's chart...this baby is down trending.........did BlackRock sold all their shares????"
This only goes down

"I was thinking about the CEO. The guy making the decisions... he’s a Philosopher. Do you remember the Trojan Horse event that happened in history? This is a perfect analogy for what they are doing by giving away the Foundry software for free. As a “”GIFT”” then...attack. Not literally attack like the real event but more of an approach to get in the door of these companies they want to be associated with. Palantir knows that their software is good and by (gifting) it they put it into the hands of their costumers.. if the product speaks for itself as highly as they speak of the product then the companies that got the product become dependent on the product, and that’s when they are tied up. Netflix gives you a month for free when you join. They get you through the door and then they charge you. Same goes for APPLE Music, HBO, Disney+, appleTV+ and millions of other subscription based companies... I think it’s brilliant. Now there’s a rotation in stocks and companies that are dependent on the pandemic to be valuable. Like ZOOM and PELOTON.... however those companies just lowered their guidance because of the re-opening of every day life. Their financials are giving up this data, and Palantir wants in my opinion to ride that wave of re opening. Now that companies are spending money to reopen in a post pandemic ecosystem they want to do it efficiently and if Palantir delivers they will become dependent on PLTR and that is very very good"

"Let me give you my advice on this one. Since i been pretty good giving advices in last few months. Pltr is great stock, but managment need to deliver a lot before valuation will be valuable i am waiting 14-15 dollar pull back where i will start scaling into. You ask me why? First charts are showing that, second i wanna see Q1 and then i am ready. I know is hard for many of you just seing stocks going down down and down, but we been in market which is just going up up and up and few months ago i was telling yoh, take your profit and reduce your risk. Non of you listen, my portofolio is up 10% in last 2 weeks when most of you are getting hammered. Do your risk managment, most importat in the market and it will make you very rich. Good luck guys see ya in arround 15."

"Okay hear me out guys, when I was buying Tesla at $200 pre-Split the same thing that is happening to PLTR was happening to TSLA. Good news and the stock would be down... i dont know if people or big institutions where putting pressure to get it to drop or whatever but it sure as hell is the same thing that is happening here. So I’ve been thinking of an analogy to explain what is happening and I think I got it. You know when you have an empty water bottle and you squeeze the bottle while turning the plastic to create air pressure at the tip? Well the same thing is happening to PLTR. Once there’s enough pressure in the bottle and you turn the tip it makes a bang sound and the cap flies off.... that is what is happening to PLTR. It’s getting squeezed & pressured.. but once the cap is turned and there’s a big pop (CATALYST) we’ll see a big wave of buys and the stock will move up on all those good catalysts that have been pressured and given the perception to being bad for the stock price itself."

There is virtually no way that management can change the reigning story of this stock in the near to mid term. They wrote the story and with unimpressive earnings picture that they are forced to report now that it's public; the massive unrestrained insider dumping; the disrespect to shareholders......it's going to take awhile to patch up this burst vessel leaking at the stern and the bow. Shorters are telling the dominant story at this point.

All the pro investors are accumulating PLTR on a regular basis! Many are on this board!!
"this turned into a death trap for me. no more buying stocks for me,cuz my money is all gone......"
"This stock is getting so much hate by everyone for not being transparent with all of the company and government contracts they are receiving. The first thing that the CEO should be doing rather than stroking the share holders is making the company is more profitable year over year and I believe he has done just that. And all of the share holders will find out when they are supposed to on earnings day 5/11. Most of the analyst are upset because they can get inside information from this company, so they bash it. But the numbers $$$ can't lie for better or worse we will know who is full of $$ or #hit on 5/11. Investigate into this stock, did you know that PLTR has the highest level of clearance with the Department of Defense. No other company has the platforms that they have and can do what they can. They are diversifying into other industries with their platforms Foundry and Gotham. This has nothing besides an upside for years to come, always evolving. ""Good Luck To Everyone, Where Every Your Money Is Invested"""
How they step on stocks to dislocate them from the upside of the general market. Then they throw an anchor on it during a market down day. Manipulation all right. HF's can't compete like Cathie Wood. Openly and without options shenanigan's. One penny lol. Describes the culture of wallstreet.
I guess all of us who were AVERAGING DOWN are screaming at our computer monitors...Please DO NOT SMACK THE MONITORThe monitor has nothing to do with Mr. Karp hairstyle...
Incredible volume...good to see positivity again!!!!
Don’t believe those $27 call sweeps options that expire on June 18￼. They LURE. You in on fake news￼
"Financial institutions / TV programs calling $PLTR as risky now at $20, will recommend after 2-3 months at $30 with $50 as target."
"My prediction for tomorrow, it can go up if not then down. In 1 month it can go down if not then up. In 10 years it will have been going through many up and down and it can still go up if not then down or sideway."

Picking on Cathie is his only way to get some attention."

sad part is most rookie retailers got in with youtube hype'men.. and now hype men have moved on and left you with a bag that's worth $18

"so scared that this one will go back to 8 where it started, selling half now"
don't like cramer? lol maybe you'd like to go back to the days of suzie gharib on NBR. lol. they were using teenies back then. guess a lot of posters here would be out of luck because i don't think too many could actually work in sixteenths and do a conversion to decimal. things have changed and much better today than yesteryear.
The CEO calls himself a socialist yet is worth $2BN. Karp is a champagne socialist.
When I saw this red in the morning before work I was like f my life again... not bad still almost at my avrg now
I’m such a bag holder on this one the stock can jump 30% and I’m still not breaking even.
Bloodbath today. Sell at opening bell.

Still a fan of PLTR after all the Cyber Attacks!!!! I would buy more if I could at this price. Tomorrow 24.00+++

"Yo. I'm long term PLTR, I was out of action yesterday and saw the pre-market and thought it was gonna be another bleeder day, but got to check back at the end of the day and woah. Great recovery. Not saying it may not dip again, it may very well trickle down over the next few months with all the fear in the market. But celebrate this win PLTR bagholders... one day those bags will be full of gold!"

Joe Bidens market - isn't it wonderful?
"Gross profit $165M - $267M in a 3 month span, net loss is represented by immense stock based compensation. Palantir is meshing employees interests with the companies focus = win for shareholders. Cash increased from $2B to $2.3B. Billings up 250%, Government growth up 76% yoy. The government market is nothing to snark at, Palantir is building monopolies in the defense and commercial industries."
Where do you think shorts sellers will start to cover and take profits?
"Platforms like Gotham and Foundry can be done for less than 10 million USD ... Just order them if you have money and people in India and Russia will fight for the contract ! You paid 1000 times more for something you don't understand ! STUDY , LEARN ,ASK ,...READ,...before pay ! You will cry a lot if you hold this bag !"

"if you held throught april, youre up 6%"
"I’ve said it countless times. What they do is nothing short of magic. Bringing Foundry to the edge is going to have massive positive revenue impact and is going to empower orgs to make real time AI based decisions on factory floors, in mid flight for an airliner, in a tank during combat…Those countless endpoints EACH require a software license or at very least have some impact on size of contract values…Real live iron man suits around the corner where robotic US soldiers are empowered by AI decision and precision through use of Palantir software which acts as a real life version of “Jarvis”IBM first sale was within 16 days of that joint product/partnership announcement. Let IBM and AWS materialize in the next 9-12 months and this thing will explode.Central operating system for the US and all participating Democratic countries one day"
Just got 100. Will get another 100 if we touch 18. And another 100 if we go 17.50. If we rise from here I’m ok with my 100 at 19$
"The clowns will be out in force today. Before you panic sell, read the piece on stock manipulation at the griproom site and you’ll see for yourself exactly what these turds are trying to do. The institutions are loading up which is exactly the outcome they’re trying to achieve."

here we go again...

O profit in 18 yrs. Pps down to 20 from 45. Meanwhile ceo has become a billionaire and shareholders get the shaft. Its not over yet as ceo keeps awarding himself and insiders 100s of millions of shares each and every yr which they then proceed to dump no matter the pps. After all they are free shares and they get 100 s of mill more each year while shareholders get the shaft. 3 bill float. 0 profits in 18 yrs. meanwhile check out how much the ceo has made in the same time. Not millions. Not 100s of millions but billions. Real team guy that ceo. Lol times a bill. The ceos total compensation since inception while the pps has cratered to 20 from 45. Like I said a real team guy that ceo. F him and his horse

I was kind of shocked when saw morning time -10% ....
Will close at $18 and change today.$16 and change tomorrow$15 by the end of the week.
Can’t wait till PLTR hits $420.69 so I can frame it in my wall like I did with Tesla.

"A look at the options expiring Friday shows it is in the financial interest of the market makers to keep the price close to where it is. They want as many options to expire woryworthless as possible. Just watch the large buy or sell orderd pop up to keep the price in this range. Until we get sufficient volume to level the playing field, big money will protect their profits from options."
"For everyone moaning about the company giving away their software for free, think about this...Palantir is a data analytic “AI” company. AI being the big word here. Meaning the more data that’s gets entered into their system, the smarter and more efficient it becomes. Also, once the company starts using the Palantir software, they’ll soon realise they won’t be able to live without it. Therefore expanding the retail customer base ten fold.We are in good hands, trust the management."

"Boy, that was some great day, huh? Ole Cathy Wood has the Midas touch, lol!"
only down from here.. We might see $10 before July...SELL
Perhaps pltr software can predict its own future stock price?
"Is Palantir's stock too risky?I bought Palantir's stock on its first trading day because its business seemed disruptive and it looked cheaper than many recent tech IPOs. However, I sold a third of my position after the stock price more than tripled in value earlier this year, since its valuations looked overheated.I plan to hold on to my remaining shares of Palantir because I still believe it has tremendous growth potential in the government and enterprise markets. But the ride could be bumpy, so risk-averse investors should probably stick with more conservative growth stocks like Salesforce instead."
Need to pushhhhhh this over 20.25 for long term down trend breakout
Closing above 20!? 
"The big institutions know what’s up. They are putting selling pressure on this to buy cheaper. Guys think to yourself and be honest, if you could legally short a stock causing it to go down to eventually take your short profits and buy the stock at the price you want you wouldn’t do it? Please be smart. Look at cramers hedge fund secrets this is how this works"
"One of the individuals posting (anonymous in the suit) is an extremely smart tech guy. So is Bobby, but Anonymous yesterday talked about Palantir’s understating it’s total addressable market so as to not be targeted too early as a monopoly. Google did this some years back before Congress when it was hauled in. Palantir, at least to me, is like a Cheshire cat, knowing all but waiting for its plan to unfold and quite frankly, it is unfolding rather quickly. Of course, it’s stock could stay down for years, but what a fun and interestingly mercurial story this is for us to observe. I am having a ball watching it unfurl. Any others, or is my pleasure archaic?"
"Gap Up tomorrow a.m.? I would say ""yes""."
"You will know it's near bottom when the CEO finally halts his wholesale dumping. When he decides it's too cheap to sell even his free shares, then he will be telling you the price is closer to their actual value. We are far from that point apparently. Dumping rapidly and ceaselessly right through earnings tells you he feels its way overvalue compared to what his people will be reporting on Tuesday."

i'd love to see a level 2 chart rn to see just how many sell orders are in at 20.90 cuz this is insanity......
"Could palantir simply be the fastest new customer on boarding software company in its league in the world? Let’s look at this closer because if customers save time, money, project costs- overruns, manpower, then save money in the future after deployment and data mining, well then this is a secret sauce that is right under our noses that you have to be really smart to pick up on. Listen, watch when the demos, and leaders lay this out rather subtlety $ 100 sooner than later"

Does anyone have any idea what the relationship is with PLTR and IBM. There are no specifics that I could find but there has to be some strategic sales process they engage with?
"My PLTR investment story, bought at 23 sold at 25 twice, bought at 22 sold at 24 once. And now waiting for earnings before starting a fresh position at about 17-18 range. Also, as a form of charity have been warning others from last 3 weeks that this would go to teens but only got thumbs down from longs.If senior management that has access to earnings is selling the stock then you can’t expect a good earnings. And management have themselves said don’t look for short term gains in this stock."
Going to $10

"A few thoughts regarding Barrons recent hit piece on PLTR. The thing that's important to keep in mind is that Eric J. Savits and/or the author of the article/subterfuge on Palantir is paid by Barrons which arguably has ties to the investment firms noted in the article. Likewise, Savits, Barrons, and an analyst's job isn't to be the umpire of the financial world whereby their purpose is to help protect the little retail investor from the big bad wolves of wall street; rather, their job and/or purpose is to render opinions that invoke either fear or greed in the masses. In turn, Savitz, Barrons, the analysts, and the firms they all work for are hoping to profit off of your emotions. I know, I know, I know, it may not seem right; however, it is how the game is played. So, take what the author of the article and his analyst buddies say with a grain of salt then buy more Palantir. https://www.barrons.com/articles/palantir-stock-slides-amid-growth-concerns-51620834965?siteid=yhoof2"
I lost 4K buying PLTR shares. I did not do my research. I only recently joined the WSB Bandwagon & lost . ️ ASO Set to gamma squeeze I will gamble my life savings on this bet.
40$ by earnings.
"If this is the 3 months bottom, for those who bought today, huge respect!"
expect unexpected
"You don't here anything good unless you do the research yourself and their is plenty to be excited about. Several of the analyst don't like the way Karp talked on the interview with CNBC and since then they have bashed the stock. WHY?, has something changed to make this stock less valuable? NO, PLTR has added several new customers more than we know about. They say the option traders are more advanced into seeing what a stock is going to do and if you look into the options. There is more than a 2 - 1 calls then puts, showing the price will increase next week. And there has been a large amount of institutions buying in over the last couple of weeks. Why would they buy into PLTR now? Think about it. Blink Charging gets awarded a contract to install charging stations in one city in Texas a couple of months ago and the stock moves up $3.00 - $4.00 in the day. PLTR has been receiving several contracts for 10s of Millions and nothing. People are scared to buy there stock because the writers are writing nothing besides negative information. Market Manipulation, you sale price drops they buy your shares at a lower price. Just my feeling, no disrespect to anyone that sales or doesn't buy."
"I don’t get it, didn’t Q1 ER pretty much show that the growth isn’t hindered by inflation?"
Wohoo we up $20 mark
Cathie Wood's ARK Invest Buys Over 2.8 Million Shares of Palantir today! Hmm
"OK, everybody, just cover all 7000 shares 17.95. The profit made is exactly for 1 bitcoin. Technically I got a bitcoin for free. ($47500 price). Enjoy trades, both bulls and shorts."
Nice entry point!!
The whole growth sector is down! Just buy the dip because this is an undervalued stock!
Looks like Karp is buying today.
Added more shares today!! Now we wait for Tuesday... as a long I’ve never ever made a comment on this forum which goes to show that only shorts come on these forums to bash stocks lol. Just close this app and check back in in 6-7 months when this stock is 40-50$ minimum. :) 
The question I have is how many options/ restricted stock units are management going to award themselves next year and ongoing.

PLTR pumpers everywhere… no real contracts! Cramer said to sell months ago!
pltr always does well until the employees wake up and start selling
Palantir's earnings report has confirmed itself as THE premiere growth play in the tech sector.
Imagine all the new shorts crying right now  Never bet against big data monopoly
Thanks for the delicious breakfast dip this morning. Will check in later.
## STRONG GREEN GAINS in The BEST TECH TODAY..... PLTR..and AABB Gold-backed ETH tech Cryptocurrency.
"Palantir, the maker of software and analytics tools for the defense industry and large corporations, reported 49% revenue growth for its first quarter, beating Wall Street estimates."
Markets are awful and all tech is suffering there’s a reason why pltr lost 50% of its value
"PLTR is battling price manipulators and shorts.Green IMO will win today, but they will reduce what it would have been.Great company, great product, great stock."
The train is leaving now.
New deal.. read the news guys!!
"My fellow PLTR Evangelists,Let me predict:1. Blah blah bla... Palantir signed new contracts 2. Blah blah blah LONGS will go to the moon3. Blah blah blah Earnings Report will beat all expectations 4. Reality: PLTR will trade in the 20's...Peace!"
The easiest money I have ever made is from shorting this company. I will continue to short until it is trading under $10. I am rich!
90 October !
"""But his hair"" is the new ""But her emails"""
"My fellow PLTR broken hearts,,1. So, despite all the good news, contracts, good Earnings Report, Cathie Wood buys, etc... PLTR price keeps going down2. Maybe if we start hearing BAD NEWS, then PLTR price will go up3. Palantir is declaring bankruptcy soon?4. Palantir is being sued by companies who are not seeing the empty profits and promises that Palantir was promoting?5. Palantir CEO is being sued by female employees for harassment?6. Palantir was cooking the financial books?7. The military awards PLTR contracts to other companies?8. Justice Department is suing Palantir for Monopoly?9. Civil Rights groups suing Palantir for using American citizens private data in Palantir computer systems?10. Fair enough? Now the price will go back to $45 next week....Peace!"
"PLTR is a “millionaire maker,” only if you have the “coconuts” to continue to buy and hold long term! Simple as that!"
Waiting and waiting
I’m excited for today and tomorrow
accepting bitcoin payments
"I got 8,000,000 stocks at average price of 40 I’m going to sell now what you guys think?"
"I told this was going under 15, did anyone listen?"
Lesss gooo we going to 100 in no time
ARKK buys 700k MORE SHARES TODAY 
All people here are aware AI is going to be our future within some years ?What does it mean today 17$ if tomorrow PLTR is a monopolistic company ? Rendez-vous in 2025
I think now is a great short price. I have their money to use or lose!!!!!
"I guess once a panic seller, always a panic seller."
KARP wants money today ....you can eat promises for 10 years but KARP like money more than bright future promised by someone ....BRAIN most important tool !
"Don't fight the trend, sell in May and go away. Come back in single digits."
"Total 2.4 billion shares ahead. The price must adapt. Target $7.25...lol As at December 31 2020, there were 535m options outstanding with a weighted average remaining life of 8 years and an intrinsic value of $9.3 billion (Page 143). Those options equate to 34% of the current shares outstanding (December 2020) and if exercised, would dilute shareholders substantially."
"Top of the range , back to 14"
"Considering how the market is bleeding, Pltr has hold pretty well. Looking forward for the second part of the year."
It's by design to steal your shares...institutions
"Profit guidance, how soon?"
"if it holds here, we should bump up by friday"
Guidance of 30% growth for the next 4 years ... meanwhile other tech based companies won’t give guidance... you do the math
"Ole Cattie sure knows how to pick them. Look at PLTR and Workhorse go this morning, lol."
Palantir Technologies Inc Q1 2021 Earnings conference Callhttps://youtu.be/NBqzJU-pgUg
"Schwab also bought close to 750,000 shares yesterday:). And they don’t even cover PLTR. Dipping it’s toes......"
"No stopping this boys, sorry."
Deja Vu.......load up and be rewarded next week!
Booster Rockets Engaged!
All we need now is for the market to rebound today and we are +20% on the day.
25 by friday
That rocket on earnings day was magical...that's why why we love Palantir. Uncle Karp and aunt Cathie...Big Time Stock. Peter has majority of the company he's never selling. He will hold majority of the company indefinitely.
"bought someone's weak hands at 20.25, thank you!"
The shorts got quiet so fast
"TBH, an increase of 2.5% per day is fine by me. I'm more concerned about April 26th, 2030 than I am 4/26/2021."
going to 25 and beyond
7 days of red daily candles in a row
I see RED from here....OMG
"pltr share price should go up Monday for many reasons, but mainly in anticipation a positive earnings report on Tuesday and the first quarter to show a profit"
"Cramer is a genius, said buy PLTR under $20 and buy Snowflake under $200, bought both yesterday. Booyah !"
"Hey look, down to $15 just like CovertAction said...man, that guy is ALWAYS right...."
"Given the horrific treatment of these shares, you *have* to think that 'bad' earnings are baked into the price. Any positive earnings will produce violent upside movement."
long 1100 shares around 30. does it hurt? yes. will shorts or tutes get my shares? FROM MY ICY DEAD DIAMOND HANDS. see everyone in 2024 when this is trading over 400
"Tomorrow PLTR must go up, COIN is +3% up in the aftermarket... we know that ARKK has too much shares of COIN..."
Funny how it took 40 years for people to hear of Cathie wood. Remember a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while and hers was Tesla. Somehow catapulted her into messiah territory. Now we see it was throwing darts.
"Four of my friends are plowing into Pltr because I can’t not share, and they are too polite to say stop already. One is severely wealthy while the others are merely millionaires, and while the price is down they are adding. This is an exciting time for people from all walks."
Aunt Cathie buying this up like there’s no tomorrow
"Hey panic sellers, here’s where some of you shares went. It’s not just Cathie. Here’s a couple of many Institutions that reported today. 5/12/2021 Northern Trust Corp 924,597 $21.53M5/12/2021 Geode Capital Management LLC 3,433,049 $79.96M"
For the sake of everyone is asking the same question about earning. It's May 18th.
Holding $PLTR strong
"wow, i'm long. in fact i'm already making money. yay palantir!"
Should I swap PLTR for RIOT when they cross paths... very tempted
This company just seems to can’t stop loosing money
This will be down 6-8 percent at opening bell. Karp was hoping that he would see a higher share price when he dumps a ton more shares this morning but I'm sure he will sleep well tonight. As for everyone else invested in this.......
"Small new Win, NIH, $2M - 4 months contract, not bad for such a small period."
WOW This may break $17 today.
Look at financials and contracts this company is signing. $38 to $45 by year end or sooner. Just be patient
"Ok shorts, there was your selloff. You can go bankcrupt now "
"Here's why I added huge today...""US commercial revenue grew 72% year-over-year."" I expect to double next quarter."
whats going on lol
"Premarket action was scary, really thought 14.5 was in reach. Holding up pretty well here so i think we are back to the swing pattern of 18-24."
Karp just gave the following message to his broker.
Remember when this was in the $30s and hit the $40s and you wish you had bought more in the $20s. This is still your chance of a do over. Buy now and hold. You will not regret it.
Luckily I put Faith in the right company. I did not sell even one share. I invest in the company not the number or the noises. How was thinking it would go down more so I can load another ten thousand shares but ..oh well
Its time to hold Palatir Friends.
slatt
"Look at virgin galactic, it’s a foreshadow for what gonna happen to pltr after earning?"
"Palantir Unlock - It's not a ""first one free"" thing. It is a full frontal assault on the current generation of ERP software providers out there like SAP and others. Unlocking your data and having it in accessible format, that is what you do when you exit a contract, so that you can transfer it to your new system. Some providers have handed data printed on paper in 40 garbage bags upon exit, because the client didn't specify the format in the contract. PLTR is removing this obstacle by just going into these systems and pulling the data out and organising it. I'm not sure some providers are even capable of doing that themselves! It's so utterly mind blowing and bold move, there will be a movie about this, greatest story on earth right now"
This stock cannot get out of its own way.
Ur crying because we lost couple dollars Look at $snow...Buy PLTR dip Lifetime opportunity GLTA
"Dear shorts,1. My BRAIN tells me that I want all of you to LOSE BIGLY because you have caused all of us LONGS a LOT of losses and headaches in the last 2 months2. My HEART tells me to let you know that it's a good idea to NOT GAMBLE anymore with the PLTR stock and just let this beautiful GEM of a stock to go back to its rightful altitude of $503. You are more than welcome to join all of us and we can cruise together at an altitude of $50 this summer4. Who knows... we may be partying BIGLY by the end of the year while our PLTR baby is trading in the $100 range when the USA military and private companies are using Palantir software to fight Covid-19, China and Russia on multiple fronts... using both Foundry and Gotham...Peace!"
"On behalf of all shorts, we thank you CEO Karp and bestow on you the honorary title of Chief Shorting Officer."
"FB went nowhere (rangebound between 20 and 30) for the first year of its existence. TSLA traded between 20 and 30 (pre-split) for its first TWO years as a publicly traded company (2010-2012). Both were regarded as having unique and potentially revolutionary products as companies, but as overpriced and underperforming as stocks. Finally, their products and the market for each matured, their steady efforts to produce top and bottom-line growth paid off, and they were rewarded by Wall Street. I owned both stocks, but got impatient and missed both moves. We're now six months in with PLTR, and it seems pretty clear that WS is willing to wait for them in the 20's the same way they waited for FB and TSLA. Whether the company can eventually deliver with earnings remains to be seen, but I see no reason it can't happen."
Everybody is talking about this stock being down...Apparently nobody saw CNBC this morning and heard that inflation was expected at .03 and came in at .09....triple. This stock is holding up pretty good after such bad economic data. This stock will continue to climb as the inviroment improves...Bought more at 18.80.
I just sold my shares. The market is about crashing next week because of higher interest rate. I will repurchase the stock at lower price.
Did you guys see SPCE  this market is not friendly
"We hit $45 January 27th around 1:30pm. I was getting a yellow fever shot for my trek to Patagonia. Remember where you were when something big happened? Well, I thought, “Wow, this baby is going up fast...should I sell?” Then it sank just as fast. I’ve been in purgatory since —paying for hubris....."
it is nice to see some green again. I'm new to the game only 50 shares but over the next 4 years I plan to have atleast 100K portfolio
what’s happening
It is only down because of inflation news. The whole market is down. Don’t sell . Buy more!
BUBBLES need to attract more people !
looks like a bull trap
"so, board personal fave blackrock, drops about 23 million shares a few days before earnings and the owners of pltr shares do not see a possible flag there."
"Solid momentum here. If it can pass through the next resistance point at 25, acceleration will move fast and we’ll see new highs in the short term."
"Palantir might also earn a spot in S&P500, in a mid/long therm future. Bear that in mind."
Shorts working overtime on this one today
This is a good stock and will pay off I am holding long on this bad boy and will buy dips when I can
Regarding the video this morning: Karp and Thiel do not do anything without thought and planning. Chapter 13 Zero To OneThey have methodically analyzed all 7 issues for a startup:1. Engineering2. Timing3. Monopoly 4. People (right team)5. Distribution 6. Durability 7. Secret Question (have you identified a unique opportunity that others don’t see?)So there is price fluctuation and your point? Know what you own. This is good stuff. Amazing actually. Have a nice evening.
"Last down day for PLTR , options expire Friday"
"PLTR will be surging like a stock I use to owned CROWDSTRIKE, after earnings release."
We’d be up $3.00 if tech wasn’t getting the high hard one.
"Man, disappointment is becoming a daily dish...but I got a strong stomach."
Simple DD for all confused today insiders filled a sell today.
ARK bought again yesterday over a million shares.
cracked out Cathie was wrong AGAIN
Is it becasue Karp is dumping again in the weed hours of the morning?
red by 7
"only 8 months into IPO, give it a few more years. FB and SHOP both struggled the first 12 months"
Yellen needs to watch what she’s saying. She’s now changing her tune according to a WSJ interview at 4:30.
even all the daily Cathie's buying for last three weeks can not save this stock./...what is going on? I have 2410 shares...but I...I can...not afford to hold any longer.....any longer.......we need God
"Don't care about the critics, and they sold too soon in a panic and now regret the decision. Buy Buy Buy Buy and hold PLTR at this price...25.00+++ SooooN"
Going to ipo price $10
https://www.outlookbusiness.com/specials/my-best-pick-2021-166/the-million-dollar-question-is-investing-a-game-of-luck-or-skill-6242#investing.Kindly read this first part of the article. Amazon was exactly at that stage like now is with Palantir since it turn cashflow positive this quarter and also bcos it has been beaten down and given up for dead. My opinion is that we are going to enter very exciting stage of Long term uptrend.
Patience will be rewarded
"Actually, l would like to add a lot more Palantir around 15! L do not want to see it race up to fast before l am loaded up! Hahaha"
The earnings will be great and this will jump 40%
I just bought 44 million safe moon
"170,000,000 + shares at 2:00 is a truth indicator."
Volume is great we should end in green. Added another 250 at $18.87. Come on fellas buy whatever you can. Just need to reverse the trend. GL
"If you're truly long, then you should be glad if this plummets much lower. If you need the money tomorrow, this is the wrong place to be. Now let's get $15."
Just Bought more for 500e..
"everybody chill out. yesterday we had a triple test of the lowsat 20 to 21 this is the third time it's tested and bounced off nicely. this is a great sign and earnings should pop it up, stay long and set aside your fears."
That was actually good!
"the cashflow from operations is amazing!!!! if im right, this is a buy"
saw in barrons that cathie wood is moving her corporate offices to mt ararat. sounds like a good move to me.
"Growth stocks like ARK funds are the best buys right now, huge upside."
"Fortunately, I’m still up more than 100%. I’ll be holding fast for some years to come."
$fubo will also accept crypto for sports betting in their app and on your connected tv. watch as this plays out just as $pltr
Wall Street will upgrade this when you least expect it This was a deliberate short attack.
I start buying around 30 and averaged down to 25 when it was around 20...when it hit 25 again on demo day i sold everything with almost zero profit...everybody on this board laughted at me...who is laughing now?
DAY 100 OF BUYING THE DIP. BUY THE DIP.
Bought 5k more shares
PLTR - Watch how it bounces back into 25 in 1-2 weeks screwing all the Shorties .. PLTR is a one of the best buy at these prices 20.57 . great long term stock -- will go 100 in 2-3 years.. so excited about pltr..
"Im afraid of cnbc, fast money prophecies. It's always opposit. Can go back under $20, as NASDAQ and tech have not finished its correction."
Wonder if cathy got paid for setting the biggest bear Trap ever???????
Seems like people had a psychological 21.
this is a double bottom or its just another leg down..feels like a new down leg but who knows
I will average down to a cent if I have to.
I would never short a Reddit stock
Just when the shorts thought they knew something...fail
"Waiting for a big surprise PLTR-BTCThe CFO said during the CC : YES with no hesitationBTC is now a weapon against dollar that could be used by China and Russiato destabilize the American monetary systemPalantir wants to position itself as quickly as possible on cryptos to have control and monitor blockchainsit is a new type of war that the American administration has understood very wellone could see partnerships quickly so that bitcoin remains in western hands and is the subject of surveillance and tracing against organized criminalsif this happens, PLTR will be in the 3 digits and we'll see GAPFA I keep my shares and i don't care of daily fluctuations"
Palantir to now start accepting bitcoin as payments. $PLTR $BTC
Thinking about tomorrow share price with PLTR............end of the world
Pltr is set to be profitable very very soon. Last earnings show great progress. Get ready for a 10x in a year or two. I’m loading up every dip.
Huge institutional buyers waiting the wings. Once this stabilizes volume will increase rapidly. Beware the short day traders fear mongering
Perfect time to buy! We’re not giving up 20 and pltr will exceed expectations on earnings next Tuesday as they did the last two quarters.
I did not buy Friday cuz Monday will be red again...
"If you are a true palantir investor, thumbs up!"
PLTR is like a spring getting a little tighter every day and when it unfurls watch out below. It will explode exponentially. Shorts not invited.
pltr just hired a top gun from the j p Morgan sales team.
what happened ?
Let's push this to over 21$ LETS GO!
I’ll buy this at 15... cents
Upgrades coming.
"Today 5/20/21 is a confirmation insider sales is over & done. Per last recorded insider sales related to unlocked shares was 5/13/21 filed within two business days following the transaction date per SEC regulation, recorded on 5/17/21 by the SEC."
"My fellow PLTR homies, 1. It's TRUE: Blackrock, Inc has sold some 24 million PLTR stock2. Currently, Blackrock Inc holds ONLY 9.3 million PLTR stock3. It's also TRUE that in the last 7 days, institutions have bought some 25 million PLTR stocks.4. It's also true that PLTR stock price has decreased by about 16% in the last seven trading dates5. In other words, PLTR stock price is FALLING while institutions are BUYING.6. For us, REGULAR bag holders, we are mostly in the RED...7. Palantir will be reporting Earnings at 8am EST on Tuesday, May-11-20218. Most analysts are predicting that Palantir will have a GREAT Earnings Report with more EPS, more contracts, more clients, and good guidance for the future 9. The question is: Will the stock price go back to $23, $25, $27....?10. If after the Earnings Report, PLTR stock price is still in the $20 to $21 range, it's going to be a depressing summer and fall and we will have to just suck it up and continue to moan for the rest of the year. I am certainly ready to unload my PLTR truck, but I am trying to minimize my losses or break evenPeace!5."
Who's ready too make some money today.....
Some whale shorts are closing on volume...
"The drop from 45 to the teens $#&&&, but with large institution investments it provides mild optimism."
"Hey guys.....""James"" has it exactly right! If you could see the future.....you would be buying every single day. For example....for every share I buy ......I will eventually get $45 to $175 a share back in profit. Don't forget what the first real Wall Street wizard said long, long ago. ""Buy low and sell high!"" PLTR is the perfect example of this. That Wall Street wizard was none other than ""Bernard Baruch!"" Keep buying guys! You will become much more wealthy if you do. Thx to all."
Expect upgrades during the weekend and +10% per-market on Monday.
Bottom is in !
Patient will reward!!!! Long
Long term hold. Wake me up in 2030.

how late are the earnings?
Why does this stock keep falling despite all the amazing news it constantly has it just doesn’t make sense to me
Does anyone of you know the product they make and the growth potential to justify it's huge market cap?
"Man, 7 big red candles in a row, don’t know when I’ve seen that even from NKLA. Where is Dominic Decoco to tell us this is up 150% since DPO? Oh wait that’s right, it’s no longer up 150%. And the declines are getting bigger each day. Zoinks"
"5/10/21Ark Buys 1,070,331 Shares Get the picture"
only red stock in my portofolio. Unbelievable 1 day before earnings
this company is a winner. smart money is loading at current level
Went from +10k to -3k on my position in PLTR. But I am honestly not afraid.
Nice to hear from a user of PLTR software...https://www.reddit.com/r/PLTR/comments/llm1yi/pltr_foundry_my_user_experience_skywise/
Rumor has Karp sold more shares again today.
If we have good er im doubling down
Ouchie. Still not selling.
"I don’t understand how people voted for demorats look at this now , they are losing all their money because of their sleepy leaders"
Just bought more. Appreciate it.
You guys don't need to look at the price until it break $25... Without break $25 we are still on the down trend.... But in this level if any big news we will jump back to up trend.
"Becky, WOW way to call the market assuming you have the actual experience to do that. Were those your friends who sold today at $16.35/share?"
and the Dow is up 141 points
"amazing results...share price will go down due to market selloff...it may even go under$15, again due to panic sell...great buying opportunity... good luck all.."
Microsoft hates PLTR for having a better product.
Let's Dance To da MOON they said.....up 9 cents!!!!
Go PLTR!
NASDAQ futures - 0.5%. Another red day tomorrow. Tech sector is not done yet with red days.
T Seymour just gave PLTR a big thumbs up. “Palantir is growing its base...” and will be the software and service solution for data.
Good! I will buy when it drop to $10
Who is holding? Anyone raise your hand
Just bought 209 shares! Send me to the moon
please drop to 20.20. want to double up.
Any pain?
Feels like a mega trap for shorties! 
I think it’s looking good.
"no reason for the DROP... GREEN market, + deal with Celularity"
"Wow, looks like some serious resistance to overcome at 20.90. Super low volume, otherwise it would have just blown through it. No one trading except daytraders swaping pennies."
These are buying times not trying times
"Td should change the news feed to ""palantir shares trading lower simply for being Palantir"""
PLTR will make us all poor in the short term but all rich in the future if we hold on and keep buying!
the ceo cant eve be bothered to cut his hair!!!
How will shorts feel when Oracle bids $40 for Palantir?
tiring looking at PLTR red... probably need to get used to :(
I’m officially done I’m going super long. 2 years and I’ll be back to check in
"WOW, the reversal in stock price today is impressive!"
Cheaper than a Palantir cap now
I hope all you are learning that it doesn’t matter how the company is doing . It’s where the herd is
when will this be $30 ????
Why on earth does this have a $40B market cap???It should be about $20B
Well it looks like Karp cashed out just in time...
"Longs. Great time to accumulate. Goes down, we win. Goes up, we win. That’s my view and why I don’t panic sell."
Going for 5 up days in a row fellas

Palantir + BMW ! Finally great news !!! 
I thought it was suppose to go to 16$!$! I was suppose to buy the dip!!!
Palantir is in a tough business with stiff competition. This stock will be a slow climber than most expect.
"Read up from bottom for those with limited time and patience. Looks like it is Palantir's ""arena""...Biden's cybersecurity order means new boon for enterprise cloud stocks - WedbushMay 13, 2021 7:10 PM ETTelos Corporation (TLS)By: Jason Aycock, SA News Editor56 CommentsPresident Biden has signed an executive order to bolster U.S. cybersecurity after the ransomware attack at Colonial Pipeline - and that's giving Wedbush's Dan Ives another chance to tout potential beneficiaries in the enterprise software sector.The move could mark an inflection point for the group, he says; ""Clearly the federal government has reached a tipping point around beefing up its cyber security protection in a strategic move long overdue. This move will have a crossover impact into the private sector as well and ultimately benefit the pure-play cyber security vendors in our opinion with new standards now in place.""The pipeline attack follows fairly closely on the SolarWinds hack, marking two major, ""brazen"" nation-state attacks on core infrastructure in six months.And Ives says he's ""befuddled"" by the lack of core next-gen security infrastructure in place around utilities and other key federal assets.The shift to the cloud has left even more data and endpoints potentially exposed, and attacks are increasing at an ""eye-popping"" rate, he says - a broader sector growth catalyst for the next 12-18 months.And it's a belief that the Biden Administration is likely to catalyze more federal spending that ""benefits Beltway players such as Telos (NASDAQ:TLS) and Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) in particular."""
Let's take a poll PLTR's stock price after earnings. I am pulling for $25+
the earnings tomorrow is going to be interesting. with the way rhe market is now you see good earnings and stocks plunge i hope to god pltr don’t plunge
"Relax! ""Buy when there's blood in the streets!"" Credit goes to Bernard Baruch.....Wall Street legend from over 90 years ago."
It’s hilarious to keep reading this as if it will keep falling forever while growing close to 50% per year
Still buying the dip ?
Stay Patient. This stock will be a Large piece of Paper in the next 5Years.They are the MSFT of Cyber security and are a Lockdown in gov't contracts and Building their commercial base. Stock is trading in it's first year like FB in the same timeframe. Stock is $300+ in 3 years so if you are long term line me 5kshares cb $31 just Stay Patient!!!!!
"Let it breathe, last November same price before rally"
Awesome. Palantir isn’t having it. It’s recession proof also
im sorry to tell you guys but...market cap of palantir $34.48BILLION! currentlyrevenue 300mil.. even if it was pure profitable revenue that means a P/E of a 100+? but they only increased revenue by 50% and doubled the costs....there will be more share dillution coming
Hedge fund is SHORTING this stock like there is NO tomorrow!!!!!
Cathie’s Ark is what Noah’s Ark looked like if it had sunk in the great flood.
"On the bright side, I get to buy more at a good price!People selling into this little drop will be sorry a year from now. Think it through. In this environment, Palantir's customers will need the software more than ever."
"If one of the founders funds is loading up, what does that tell you?"
Added all my margin could bear today. Time to fly!!
Sell in May and go away so I can buy more at bargain prices. In just a few years PLTR will provide for my second retirement.
Another gift to Karp. He’s going to off load a ton more shares. Rinse wash and repeat
EOS Space Systems Partners With Palantir Australia On Space Operations Exercise
Calm down! It's not the end of the world. PLTR reached $45 in 4 months. Don't y'all have any confidences that it will go back to $50 in 5 years? It's a great company. The government have been using it for years. Don't let the noises or numbers mess your mind up.
i bought over 500 shares at 25$ i think im dying
show me 16! Braahhhahahahaha
"Strong Day. Close over 20 not an accident...Call pricing. If Nas stabilizes look out. Machine inputs relative to Nasdaq have switched since pre earnings. Good thing PLTR is it's own animal and really is not dependant on a sector performance...Palantarians: FSLR solid pick this year, big winner into 2022. Been shorted by whales since 100. Reversal will be strong and break through to new ALL TIME high (from 2008-10 Solar euphoria...now it's actually here.) once tariffs are extended on Chinese and Infrastructure plan materializes. ONLY US maker of solar modules on large scale...JOBS. Best in class technology/durability. Balance sheet that would make Ben Graham smile above. Value and Growth. Enjoy the weekend"
Can’t wait for PLTR to make new products available. They plan to be the number one software company in the world.
Now we just need 9 more days like this...with not red days in between. Who is with me?
24.00+++ minimum sell
$30 by July? Or higher?
We might even see green by end of day!!! ARK INVEST will definitely add more to PLTR!!!
Listen I bought more on margin. Now stop this brand let’s go!!

"owned this stock for about 4 months and just keeps bleeding. The only big customer it seems to have is a handful of govt agencies....usually the govt hires the lowest bidding minority owned company; i.e., welfare for poorly run companies.

oh noooo again.. Max pain
"""Chewy, let's jump to lightspeed!"""
"If Baffet doesn't understand tech stocks, what do you understand? And, would Buffet buy Palantir? No!"
"My entry is over $30. It's not easy for sure. But trust me on this: there will be a whale of an account soon. An account that doesn't just push PLTR higher, but the kind of partnership that doubles the stock - a $1B+ contract. And when that happens, those who are short will be decimated. Because there is no ceiling for short sellers...and they've become way too confident that PLTR will never see those highs again. Boy are they wrong."
citi put a 17 dollar target on pltr this am. guess i'll wait.
Hey
"I’m not one to make posts... but I’ve been in the marketplace for over 20 years. A little background about me... around 1996 I was fortunate enough to become a venture capitalist for the first time with a fiber optic company. I turned $100,000 into $10,000,000:) YES.. extremely lucky, and once in a lifetime opportunity-so to speak. Over the years I’ve invested in the health sector, internet, biotechnology, etc... all Pre-IPO... I invested in Facebook at $45 a share before it went public, and the unthinkable happened! It dropped to about $17:( I thought the world was coming to an end! However, approximately 10 years later, it’s now over $300 a share:) the lessons I’ve learned are extremely valuable when it comes to the stock market! The worst thing you can ever do, is PANIC! Now, with that said, I would like to share my thoughts:)Palantir is such an underrated stock, and SO cheap at these levels, that I KNOW that the stock is being incredibly manipulated right now!! If anyone really knew the true capabilities of what Palantir can do, the stock would have a zero at what it’s trading today and be where it should be amongst the other tech giants in the marketplace! Trust me when I say: the hedge funds, and other institutions are loading up on this stock at these levels, but they know they won’t be able to get it here for much longer!! I know it, they know it, and now all of u know it!! Palantir has been in business for about 20 years now!!! It hasn’t even scratched the surface when it comes to their potential! If everyone who owned it, held it, what do you think the price would be for those who want to buy it??? The math is simple!!!! Like I learned from the one past example, those who bought at $17, are now boasting $300! I don’t believe it will take Palantir long at all to hit triple digits, because they’re business model and products are like no one else out there!"
"Another 2008 is on the way, same thing happened in 2008 hedge funds selling then the market going down,"

"Dear PLTR stock,1. It's OK baby....2. If you reach $21 you will be able to drink and buy any alcohol you want...3. The $21 milestone is a rite of passage for many Americans... who can go to bars, dancing clubs, etc...4. You can do it...Peace!"
numbers not even out yet and its down 5% 
"yeah, 18 by earnings.."
Fund Managers finally woke up to his great company!
I see $22 close.
Long and Strong! I think we will see another 10% today!
i heard citi put out a $170 price target..they know something
Took my profit. Seems bullish though if the Nasdaq holds we'll see.
$22 plus close?
Game over ... bears!
PLTR at these levels ($20ish) is like Amazon or Google at these levels. We'll never see this price again. LOAD UP.
Short squeeze baby
You know upside is huge when shorts spend more time here than holders
How many red days in a row now?
Like how much lower are they going to short the stock!? Geez this stock!
Patience grasshopper. I been holding Apple for close to 15 years and made a killing holding and selling Tesla after 7.
Someone bought 17M at the open...massive 
Big institutions would not be adding such large quantities if this stock was not going to make them profits. They have teams of experienced analysts making decisions based on years of experience and expertise. I’ll hold the bag and let it get heavier
added five more don't think we have much time left at this price

"""They have a saying in the textile industry: It's always darkest before pitch black."" - Peter Lynch"
Or is it a Bear Trap..
Palantir announced it is accepting Bitcoin as payment. NASDAQ correction sends the boats towards the rocks. The ship will recourse soon enough.
If you really listened to the call the SBC should not concern you anymore.
Shall we sell everything? And buy back when this correction finish?
"In theory, if I had known we will hit $18, I would have dumped all my shares at $26 and bought more now. It is what it is. I’m still confident this firm will be highly successful in years to come. Set it and forget it."

"Slight green in the pre-market morning, Palantir investor take warning. Another Red day ahead!"
I watched the Cramer vid he actually said it was an ok stock I don’t see the big deal I’m still bullish on this
Close $21.83.
Bear markets are perfect buying opportunities for long terms gains
Earnings report should give us a “boost” in about an hour and a half

Buy buy buy!
When Cramer tells you that growth is doomed from here on out and you have to get out to be part of the banks/materials run up on after the most painful Monday growth stocks have had after a long slow painful bleed.... then the next morning pre market is blood red.... that’s when you know the bear market has come to an end.

"The Price of share keeps going down while many said big boys and ""girl""=Cathie is buying....then why is the SP keeps going down???Answers: many contributing factors1. Big boys are shorting Cathie Woodstocks in collaboration (totally illegal but how can you prove they are doing it but they are doing shorting) 2. Retail investors got scared and they stared dumping the stock thus effecting the price lower3. Stack based compensation hurting the investors= company makes no profit because the comp is so large. 4.Incredible amount of Insider's stock thus devalues share holder and SP.5. Big boys buying up cheaper shares while they are shorting...thus the boys win both ways....momentum play at the moment. NOW YOU KNOW!"

Keep it up.

cathie should have had a talk with dr. doom.Dr. Doom' economist Nouriel Roubini says 'the Flintstones had a better monetary system than bitcoin' and the token should not be considered a currency
its at a price you can kinda hold it and not get too hurt these days....but it may be a while until u see any money
They are universally trashing PLTR for a second time now on CNBC for a second time lol. Lackluster earnings report immanent they say.

I wonder if Salesforce or Google will try to buy PLTR.
So bullish right now...looking forward to the big hike and not selling it.

"Delusional robinhooders think this will ""x10 to the moonz!"". You can tell they arn't that bright because they don't understand how laughable that is.

Yeah ok baggies, this should have a higher valuation than companies like Cisco systems, McDonalds, PayPal etc."
These hedge funds are jumping into PLTR Selling and Shorting Catherine WOOD has no chance. I will bet she is placing BEARISH options. To Hedge ￼￼
I don't care what you haters say! I am buying PLTR monthly! I only holding 3420 right now and will add more as long as it in $20s! 5 years later will see where we will be.

Ives said he was “befuddled” by the lack of cybersecurity infrastructure around utilities and federal assets and that efforts to improve that could benefit a number of names such as Telos and Palantir PLTR"
Only Snowflake and Roblox is more overvalued than PLTR. That says a lot. Insiders fair valuation was $7.25...lol
"If it breaks $20 tomorrow, then it will go to about $22.5 before it heads back down to new lows. Unless $22/23 is broken with conviction, this will continue to follow the downtrend it has been in for months now. Today's bounce has less to do with earnings, and more to do with day traders getting in as it bounces off the lower trend line."
Can someone explain palantir Thanks

This is just full on stock manipulation. A war on tech. The sec should be arresting people but they are prob shorting this too.
I guess there are $1.1 billion reasons why the stock is crashing this morning!
Short squeeze incoming
Looks like stop loss triggers happened this morning... back up we go
Ceo always babbling on about how virtuous and morally concerned and superior the company is. Where exactly is the virtue and morality of turning it into the insider's ATM to the tune of over a 50% loss to bagholding shareholders? It's almost like legalized racketeering and rarely seen such a crass example. And if earnings are drab it will be even more so. This thing is ready for another pounding.
Break of 26.20 will confirm a trend reversal.

Later cathie will be the boss of this company
Dudes today Palantir in Zak rank is 4 which means sell. Should we trust them?
"as soon as next week, CEO will announce that they will cut dividend by 1/2 starting next Q and the NEWS will sink another 26% of T. Just sell and go buy $tsla and invest in the future. And also put some in $pltr for gigantic growth!!!"
This is becoming very disheartening
I believe in this company's business but my $38.50 cost is becoming less and less reachable. At least in a foreseeable future..

I'm glad I bought yesterday!
sHORT sQUEEZE NOW.. SHORTS GOING BANKRUPT... YAHOO.. PLTR TO TOUCH 25 WITHIN WEEKS..
"Broke through the 20.00++ so stay long for next weekk. News and upgrades coming, and now 26.00+++++ I see 40.00 by end of the month."
The stock breaks 20 and we are going to 14.5 before any upward movement. Seems to be the downward trajectory since last earning.
Can anyone here justify 38 b market cap?
For me bottoms was put in 3 days after earnings! Going higher but what do I know I shine my city shoes
"The dislikes on positive comments, shows that this board is flooded with people shorting Palantir stock and trying to get people to sell their shares."
"Hang tuff boys, just because the slugs have crawled their way out from under the slag heaps they live under does not mean the stock will tank...they are only trying to ply their one and only trading technique...wishful thinking."
"PLTR has been in a bearish trend since the insiders starting selling their stocks, this is headed back down to $11."

Today is going to be fomo because of fantastic earnings. Tomorrow we will end up 40$.

Palantir reports 49% revenue growth for its first quarter

"Took a look at the chart. This is about to rip really, really hard."
Does someone know the total contracts for Palantir this year?
“A winner is someone who recognizes the weaknesses. My weakness was very easy to be panicked. since I learned patience is a virtue. I am not worried with pltr. I will keep adding when the opportunity comes.
Grab. the dip!!!! going to rally!
"It’s still a $41 billion market cap. When the first jenga peg gets pulled on this market, and it’s coming soon to a theater near you, everything is gonna drop hard. Again people, $41 BILLION market cap right now. I am in early, this thing ran up way too fast. Be patient, keep your powder dry, and get this thing under $15."
Will end green today
nice!!! just broke 20 
only up from here
Enjoy the ride this week.
"not only holding, I loaded up today"
I will buy as much as I can under $30. I will be retired by 40 years old living of PLTR diviends.This will be in ten years the top 10 biggest companies in the world. I believe.
Karp just made 1.6 billion dollars. You lose money? Ok. But why do you want to pay 200% over fair price $7.25 to Karp?
Pretty obvious insiders expecting underperforming earnings for Q1. They cannot sell shares fast enough.
"If you're willing to be patient PLTR has a bright future. Here's my take: 1. Web 3.0 will be defined by a deluge of data - 5G, CRSPR, Low orbit satellites, FSD, AI.....they all have one thing in common - Data. 2. Most existing solutions have a fragmented data stack approach. Even the much loved Snowflake is taking a more traditional approach albeit cloud based. 3. PLTR is the first and only solution which can organize and analyze data in a super efficient fashion. Which can marry new and legacy system with minimum fuss. 4. All it will take is for one FAANG or Fortune 100 use case to become public and PLTR's order book will take off 5. THey have built a massive moat with a 2-3 year head start on their best competitors.Long"
Institutions bought 25 million shares in the last seven days
Old news for the curious:Soros sold last quarter. Stop fretting. He’s gone.
"Dear Palantir employees,1. As you can see, PLTR is going slowly up2. This is GOOD NEWS3. HOWEVER, please don't F it up again by selling your millions of stock4. Just wait until after the Earning Report date5. Otherwise, we LONGS, will be MAD...Peace!"
Down
"Dear lord please, please save us all."
"I'm holding 4000 shares with AC of 26.5I was up until 3am MST trying to determine what to do on open. I went to bed with pre market at 17.05.I dreamed, Palantir went on a dump and the stock fell to 4/s. I.. still held.I woke up at 7:28 with a panic; premarket was 16.xx and I was freaking out expecting the dump....but, it moved up to 19.83.Even at 4/s in my dream, i decided to hold. Thank god that dump didn't happen, but i clearly have no plan to sell. - neither should you.We are long everyone."
$ 17. He's going fast. People start to think. Soon the ATM will run out of cash for management.

"very good time to add and average it down. I am a patient guy, so no issues to hold it for few years, although I believe it will be over 30 by EOY!"
There is so much talk about insider selling. But did you know over the past 12 months insiders have been buying over 161 million more shares than they sold? Think about that. The shares they sold were prearrange by their contracts.
"Therefore by the end of today whoever is panicking and wants to get out will be out. Tomorrow, no matter what happens, there will only be pressure on the upside."
Ark just bought almost 3 million more shares. They got 1.5 yesterday as well.
"omg , what did CEO do now?????"
Bought 2000 more shares averaging down to $20.62. BUY WHEN PEOPLE ARE FEARFULL.
Down 30K but I’m not selling 
Some day PLTR will be at $100. I’m willing to hold

"My fellow LONGS,1. Any new HYPE we can come up with to cheer the masses?2. We have been saying it will POP. When?3. We have been saying ""consolidation blah blah..."". It doesn't seem like it's helping4. We said Palantir is winning a lot of contracts. People are just YAWNING...5. We kept making fun of the Shorts. But they are clearly winning the game...6. We kept saying that PLATR is ""Oversold"". It's just another silly empty excuse ...7. We kept telling the masses that the Palantir employees have a right to sell their stock after 17 years of work... and that will end soon... It's clear that Mr. Karp and his employees are still in dumping mode... 24/78. Despite Demo Day, despite CNBS and financial news appearance by Mr. Karp, despite the IBM, AWS, etc... partnerships, etc... Wall Street is NOT IMPRESSED...9. What Gives?10. Are we DUPED by this PLTR stock? What else can we HYPE? We did everything in our power and we used all the buzzwords that LONGS are supposed to use. Nothing is working... HELP!!!!Peace!"
Not sure why people come on here to bash this company. If you think it is so bad sell and take your money and invest in something you believe in. Life is too short to be so negative.
...bought more.
Where is the bottom on this stock?
It has been like this every day!
Crazy Cathie bought $25M worth Palantir today. Which means this is definitely going to $18 tomorrow.
Can we have 45 back in office?
I did it! I was finally able to purchase more shares at $19.88.
Added more
Still not seeing any conviction on the buy side...
Good day...as a long I'm happy with that!
Board is full of shorts.. where are you longs? Everybody gave up?

If they crest the value we know they will they’ll hold and when they do sell there will be hungry buyers
Today is going to be FOMO because of fantastic earnings. Tomorrow we will end up 40$.
I like the call !
I will buy when it drop to $7 and that will be by next week.
Bears don’t understand this company nor the conviction of the longs
I hope miracle happens and we are up +10.
"If Palantir misses on earnings, how low does this go?"
"Open admission - Never expected us to break below $20 again...Concerned but not the least bit surprised as WS never loses...They got burned by PLTR going Direct Listing and seems they're determined to get it at the prices they want..The recent reduction in Institutional shares held (reported) is not what I'd like to see going into earnings. Albeit ownership on that front is up significantly since last earnings but it has dropped from highs. No telling the reasons why. I do get concerned some about the stock based compensation continuing to be the narrative that steals the show from earnings. I hope to be wrong but IF i'm not, I will be finding yet another opportunity to add. What has not changed are the business mechanics. The horizon for PPS hasn't changed either. Referenced over and over and over. If you have a 2025 view or longer I believe we will come out significantly in the green.Disclaimer - I'm now even on my investment after being up 6 figures. Paid the price for my loyalty but doesn't change my position on this company and subsequently stock when the powers that be are ready to let it run.Best of luck this week!"

"Not invested in PLTR, though am in AI, so feel your pain. Please humor me while I tell you the story of being heavily invested in retail stocks during the majority of the Trump administration, stocks such as Williams Sonoma, American Eagle, Signet Jewelry and a host of others to include fashion houses Capri, Tapestry and Ralph Lauren. The retailers languished as did the designers, supposedly because Amazon was going to take over the world, that was the common theme for nearly three years, no one could compete. So going into December 2019, retailers were at very low P/E's most in the single digits even during the traditionally strong Christmas season, it just appeared that things would never change, yet they did in 2020, Covid and it got much worse, I saw Signet go to five dollars a share, I saw Williams Sonoma go to 25 dollars a share and American Eagle made it to 8 if I recall correctly, Tapestry to 12. I held, didn't see anything else that wasn't already pumped to invest in. Now due to reopening narratives, Signet, a company that couldn't break 35 for years (after divesting of their financing arm and seeing a huge loss in revenue and profits due to it) now all of a sudden is breaking 68 dollars a share, a price double what it was before Covid and three percent unemployment. American Eagle is three times higher than it was pre-Covid, Williams Sonoma is at all time highs and also nearly three times higher than pre-Covid. What has changed? The political environment, unemployment double what it was, an economy that is now a wounded bird nothing else. Yet for some reason retailers now are considered the hot stocks gathering P/Es that tech stocks couldn't imagine now."

We'll call him Alex here. So first off, Alex is one of our largest stockholders, but he has two large option grants that are expiring at the end of December that can't be extended. And so when he goes and exercises these options, it's going to create a very, very large stock build just to exercise in holding shares.And as a result, we've seen tax motivated sales as well as many corresponding exercises for shares that he will continue to hold. And even after this, he'll continue to be one of our largest stockholders. If you're interested in the nitty-gritty, you can check our filings if you want more detail."
All gains will vanish from yesterday.When will you all learn that this stock isn't going anywhere. It will now trade between $15-$20 not $20-$25. It will break $15 by next month.

This company will change the world.
"I am very optimistic about Palantir. We are all going to get rich eventually! But we must have patience, buy more shares during the dips, and be willing to hold our shares for a long time, if necessary. You won't regret it."
"Screw diversity, PLTR is 40% of my life savings now. Lets go!"
The problem is not in this company. The problem is the bear market correction.

Their revenues will continue to increase dramatically and their existing business revenue becomes much more profitable. This will all shake out in a couple years with significant revenue increases and profits. Be patient. Their technology is sound and needed. Just look at what happened to the pipeline. This technology can help solve the conspiracies.

This is getting tiresome
"These earnings will reflect gains from Amazon Web Services and IBM partnership for the first time, which are deals that basically made Foundry modules available for purchase, to every living human on earth. It’s a no brained that Palantir WILL skyrocket after earnings."

"Hope all of you remember my post, last week."
annual growth of 30 pct from now till 2025. people aren't going to love that.

"Cathie added in both ARKK and ARKW. She has 25,235,538 Shares total. Palantir is now her #16 holding in ARKK and #20 in ARKW. Soon to be top 10 in both."

Glad to see the earnings report was well received as I am a hesitant owner of the stock but Dominic Decoco is still annoying AF.He has a 5 year plan. He is 10 percent into it. He is reason alone to sell your shares.

"There's a lot of selling pressure on this stock, every time PLTR tries to rally, the amount of selling always mutes the rally. I noticed this even on its march to $45.00. I wonder how long this group of sellers will last, because as long as they do PLTR faces considerable headwinds."
She's performing beautifully! Working hard to get to a $21 close.
Get ready Bears
"So, depressed price movements the last few days were due to Karp prearranged the sale of his shares to pay taxes. Hope that he is done selling for this year as it is hurting small retail investors very much!"

I picked up a bunch more under $18. Thanks again. Time for another cigar. See you all tomorrow.
If you can't handle a bear market you shouldn't be in the market. The only person to blame is yourself for not being patient and investing more than you can afford to invest.
Hey guys is it possible for a stock to dip so much it goes to 0. Hehehhehehe.
Serious question to those who bought PLTR pre-ipo: Has anyone had a problem with their cost basis and original trade date information? I have been trying for months to get my cost basis info corrected at a broker (I will not name) because the price they are showing is lower than the price I paid. Therefore when I sell the stock (long term) I will pay more in capital gains tax. They tell me I have no recourse and It can not be fixed. Any thoughts?
What will be the headlines tomorrow? PALANTIR exceeds expectations on quarterly earnings report!
PLTR//Two analyst are down on PLTR//One analyst is up on PLTR//Cathie Wood is buying PLTR shares in the tune of about 40M//Earnings were better then expected//Price is down from $45 its 52 week high//I believe that PLTR is a buy despite the report from Barrons//
Nice to see some green again
Tomorrow +10%

That's why I decided to load the tuck with PLTR stock7. For some reason PLTR is down 60% and my truck is still in the parking lot8. Can someone please give me some reputable YouTube Influencers to help me unload my PLTR truck?9. Please.. I am crying and I don't know why.Peace!"
"A quick balance of power on Saturday morning:* Huge contracts- high frequency* Strategic investments - groundbreaking companies* Huge forces - buy on the basis of trust And more On the other hand, Strong declines as a result of many reasons that we all assume/guess, the main ones :* Short manipulation* Valuations*Employees sell because they know something we do notI ask you,What needs to happen so that the direction will change?Is a performance change required? Maybe the change required is political or the image of the company and the products?Maybe it just takes time?Serious answers are welcome.Answers from clowns/cartons will be even more welcome, so help me mute you effectively.I am a long-term believing player.maybe a little worried but the basis for concern is a lack of understanding and not a lack of faith.Thanks"
bought 80 more at $21.16
Get ready for another down day of major sell off.
PLTR will close at $20.18 today. Thumbs up if you agree!
"Hey PLTR, there’s this thing called a “Green Day”, and we would like for you to perhaps try and dwell into those once again instead of being lazy. Thanks!"
My favorite GIF for a green day. Take this shorts!
Incredible day to be buying!! just doubled down. thank you for the cheap shares.... Alright Cathy let's Rock and Roll!!
crypto sell-off. money is coming back into tech stocks. im already swimming into green
"Given the suppressed downtrend, this stock could easily go up $5 in one day."
"Any good earnings tomorrow, realistically, will get suppressed due to the bearish market."
Beginning of recession?
"ARKK bought 737,283 of PLTR today."
How long will it take PLTR to go back over $35.00?
1800 shares hoping to get more tomorrow loosing a lot but hanging in there
Did you know that 90% of annual profit goes to Karp and his merry man???Each quarter CEO and XO pays themselves first before reporting revenues....unfair...totally unfair
who's buying today baby let's go....
"Good evening. I bought another wee thousand shares last week; 17,000 was an oddish number to me. 18k seemed a rounder number, legitimacy I think. Kind of like the drinking age in some states, the right to vote, the privilege to serve your country, etc....I like this number. I feel like am legal now. I also like owning a company as grand as this. Irrespective of tomorrow’s numbers, its all good."
"As Alex said, if you are looking for short term gains, buy another stock."
Friday will be 3rd red day in a row. This is headed right back down to $16. Possible support there. Wonder how many shares Karp is unloading before the weekend.....
The issue with this stock its as many others in the Tech-growth sector that when the 10 year yield starts to climb again it will bring down most of them. That is why this is going to be stuck in the low 20s; then teens again. It is my prediction
"We're on the highway to heII!! highway to heII, Yeah, yeah."
"Ok, I was always bullish about Palantir. I am even now, but if they want to hold bitcoin on their ballance sheet they really pi$$e$ me off! I don't own that digital trash without intrinsic value and I don't want that any company I'm invested in to own it. If they don't like owning $2.3 billion in cash, there are plenty options where they can invest. So why do they choose overinflated bull**** is beyond my understanding."
"2 more days and the market will flourish, so sell Buy PLTR...!!"
This stocks movement is so manipulated
Listen.. we can’t be any worse than Cathy’s funds or Blackrock ok? Chill!
"Everyone who is panicking right now should read Chapter 8 in Intelligent investor again. If your neighbour come to your home today and offers you $1000 for your home, would you sell?"
"I doesn't feel good to have this long serie of red days, everyday several % down. But in the long run, this doesn't matter. Investing isn't sprint. It's marathon, whoever has more patience usualy wins. If you look at Palantirs financial statements, there is nothing wrong with this company. Tiny debt, ton of cash, new clients, massive growth of revenue... the company could be profitable now if they chose short-term goal instead of long-term one. But they will not sacrifice great future, because few short-term investors want their money now. Alex Karp said that well, if you want short-term profit, you can go somewhere else. This company's strategy is not make tiny profit today, but to reinvest and make huge profit tomorrow. Their potential runway is very long and there are huge tailwinds. So hold or sell, but don't bash here all day. And those management options? If you have great product, if you are years ahead of the competition, and if you want to keep this trend in future, you must pay your engineers to keep them work for you and motivate them and to reward them for good work. Palantir is 17 or 18 years old company so they have good working product, but if they want to expand to comercial sector and take a big piece of that cake, they must in some ways act as a startup (reinvesting ton of cash, big options etc). I am confident in Palantir's future and I will hold shares and load up more without any hesitation and no matter what acrobatics the price will do."
The Earning is great. I'm double down my position on this stock. Be greedy when other is fearful.
Last Chance before Lift-off. Doubt now or regret later 
Data is the new oil
"Data and A.I. continue to explode, PLTR has a addressable market of $119 Billion and growing. The US government market alone is $26 Billion and ever growing. PLTR is on pace to crush 2025 $4B revenue target after the 104% yoy growth in total deal value. PLTR also remains a crypto player, Peter Thiel is huge in the space while COO Shyam Sankar has voiced concerns about the US needing defense against cryptos being used as financial weapons by foreign countries. This company is exposed to the fastest growing sectors in the word and maintains a pristine relationship with the US government. PLTR will be a tech giant among the FAANG’s."
whatbhappened everystock im in is red....woodstock has been burnt up
Crypto is where the money is at
Again people. Facts speak for themselves 45 to 18 and more pain coming. A real team guy the ceo is and insiders. Lol times 12 mill Ceo total pay last yr
Why did Yahoo tell everybody Karp made a billion dollars? Are they trying to cause the stock price drop?
This price is delicious.
Just remember yesterday our premarket was -10%
We are in a 50% correction. What could be a good entry ?
Pure histeria
i like the buisness modell .. i sold at 19 with 100 dollars loss.... you should relize that the macro is not on your side with Palantir... this is th rewinde of growth stocks ...
CitiBank with the $170 price target! Get ready for takeoff
"We have hackers everywhere, and guess who the government will rely on PLTR, and so will private industry for data control."
we will end today green. this month green. and this year.
What are the earnings expectations?what ar3 the rumors?
"Help Karp to get rich, buy more stocks."
5D price chart is total joke. Even the blind must see it. Prime example of inefficient market.
Shorts be ready for a massive reverse! We will reach 27 after earnings!
PLTR + SKLZ the combo for a retirement
broke 20 look out. I'm adding 5 more
"NEWS FLASH: I just got back from my morning workout. The sun was out, birds were chirping, people were out and about. Contrary to popular belief, the world is not ending."
Holding 4500 shares of PLTR at $23.15. I believe this’d stock will be trading $30 by end of year. I will be holding.
wait till this thing does PINS and FB move and turns around in 1~2 yrs. diamond hands!!
Got more at 22.98 thanks !
I think its time for Palantir to open a new algo driven wealth financial services. I will open a new account w/ them if it comes to fruition.
market sentiment is soooo negative right now for growth. never seen it so negative in the past year
Colonial pipeline situation could have been avoided with PLTR tech.
Obviously nobody on the 'sell' side is scared of earnings.
"A market cap of $35 Billion is not justified by their earnings, huge let down and i see this close to $10 by friday"
I practically did not open my portfolio for a week as everything was RED! Felt like the bleeding won’t stopthank you #Fubo #PLTR
My blood pressure is going up
"here is a question for all of you,,, How can you value a company that ahs 1.6 Billion or more shares that can be traded at anytime and has ZERO earnings and has shown nothing,, what price should it be priced at, seems anywhere from 10 to 40 but 22 seems like a ship sinking"
nice volume......long term looks at little brighter
Today 25.20$
Cathie? That you?!! 
I’m just sad I didn’t get e chance to buy at $17 
Oh no they extended another contract.. That means this stock will go down again.
Praying hard for tomorrow
what is wring with this stock. Absolutely no news and just goes down
Now watch how the Shorties get kicked out from their Houses & file for bankruptcy when daily PLTR will increase by 5% . Nothing can stop this Winner from reaching 25 in 2 weeks and 30 by early next month..
Overall software sector down today. Earning will beat and we'll rise 20+%. Strap in longs!
im holding but is it smart to hold ?
Just analyzed the earnings report and I’ve never been more excited about palantir. My average is 24. Will double my position if it hits 15. This is an opportunity if a life time
Did they really mention a possible offering of 100 million shares ? That’s crazy if they did
wish i had more money so i could buy more:(
"A bunch of geniuses come together and develop technology for nearly 20 years. Leading commercial companies in their field, governments and government agencies, pay over $ 1 billion a year for groundbreaking services. Total future orders (after contract) about $ 2.5 billion. The best investors believe in the capabilities of the company. We too have identified this and are taking advantage of the situation, whatever its reasons for overloading more shares. Up the road we take risks but continue out of the power of faith in the company and the value it produces for its customers. For me it's fine that there are those who do not think so. I'm trying to ignore them. Absolutely. It's only a matter of time until this technological marvel is called ""The Digital Industrial Revolution."" Believe it !!!! Load if possible. It will take less time than we anticipate."
Who’s ready for -50% tomorrow
Man can’t even sustain gains when everything is green. Bad sign
"NASDAQ is going to get spicy with the MISS in the jobs report. Also, the correction in last month's report. The argument for inflation has taken a MASSIVE HIT today. Right in time to PLTR Earnings.... Spicy Spicy Spicy!"
"So when it goes down KArp is selling, per the shorties, so when it goes up does that mean he is buying?"
I had seen this had the power raise 30% in one day.
burn shorts. glad i loaded up more this morningm. look at that growth. see you at 50 next year.
"When Jim Cramer was selling Viacom/CBS over a year ago I was buying. When Jim Cramer said not to buy SNAP a few years ago, I was buying. Now Jim Cramer says he would not be a buyer of Palantir. Guess what I am loading the boat on Palantir just like VIAC and SNAP. Jim Cramer likes to recommend stock when they are obvious like Apple!!"
HODL - Diamond Hands! We’ll see $22 y EOD

Don't need $21.01 BUT $21 ............................
"I shorted at the money on Monday because I was bearish. It dropped so much now that this has actually given me the chance to close out those positions and short it again in the same week. Ahh, the sweet smell of free money. :D"
Nasdaq futs down over 55 pts
Treasurys yields are down and this still down and Nasdaq up. this is very bad to say the least.
Insiders made their milllions and billions already...and don't care what happens to the price now.
Sold at loss of %20+.... Will never return again to this stock....beside a great co.lany yes .... this stock is otc garbage true story
"Guys, the whole stock market is getting beaten ...take a look at any stock like Amazon . May is typically not a good month for stocks, investors are now trying to figure out how 2022 will shape up. Patience fellow Palaterians!!"
Going all in
Climbing on a depressed day.  Youngsters buy more shares N O W.
I am a small investor won’t be able to afford another big dip
"This reversal is like a dream come true, Hyper"
Oversold. This is a great entry for me.
"of 28M expected, and they were UP by 151M! FCF margin of 44%, even higher than MSFT! In other their second earnings report! And they expect at least 30% revenue growth to at least 2025! I think it could even be higher, especially if they get their commercial side of their business rolling! And it is starting to roll! Folks, we have a phenomenal powerhouse here in the making!"
No words to describe this...
Even Conservative 1yr estimates are 25% above the current price.
Anyone see the new job application from PayPal asking for Palantir experience? Just like AT&T??
"Please, Please keep us in Green & keep going !"
The whales are loading up 
I am long LT but I hope that this is not a bull trap.
"Maybe this really isn't a good year to be investing. coin, stocks, funds, everything is falling."
"If earnings was a hit this time and they cut losses by $700M in 1 quarter, just imagine what the next quarter brings, this is literally such a good discount price right now... especially with gotham and foundry being unrolled and now working on apollo. Palantir is the next pre-90's IBM"
Plm. Palantir lives matter
This is time start buying IMO.... fear is at its highest. Buy the fear and wait like a snake to sell the greed.
How many readers do we have here? Here’s a suggestion aimed at those who wish to hold but vacillate. Good read about Buffet. And he held on to everything. He could read and assess a P&L in 20 minutes before he decided to invest.... Regarding PLTR I think we’re only talking 3-5 years for superlative returns. Anything longer could be a generational change for a family. The Snowball by Buffet and Alice Schroeder.
Cathi back at it again with the 1.1m shares bought
My prediction for the close today: $20.90 (currently at 20.20)
"So, TEN CONSECUTIVE DAYS of PLTR down... RED...Where is Jesus when you need him?"
I only need a $5 pop and I'm even! :)
"Everyone loved Palantir before, now the institutions short it to shake off the retail Investors and everyone panics. They know they can make huge gains shorting a stock, and then re buying it at a very cheap price.By the time retailers get back in, the price is too high, and the institutions short it again.Now is the time to buy."
"chilling, down 20k/up20k don't matter atm. "
"It was disgusting the way they treated Palantir, shorts burned today"
Who tf selling at 21$
"Bold statement: Last year, former Airbus CEO Tom Enders told the New York Times that bringing in Palantir was “one of the best decisions of my career.” Enders is now a member of Lilium’s board."
New buyer .. I hope this was a good entry .. in at 19.90 what’s the plan ? Help me I’m a newbie to pltr
"I called it on the dot, 17.2"
"Green wave tomorrow, earnings beat coming, hedge funds got sneaky with this one."
Stock is tanking because they will show continued massive employee option expenses. Probably another billion. This is going to 15 this week.
"Tremendous buying opportunity, thank you for the shares this morning."
1705 shares and I won’t sell no matter what. I only hold PLTR and no worries at all. Goes up great if it goes down I buy more

The same powers that took this down for 11 days straight could now push it back up if they want to. Shorts who didn't cover today hoping for a retrace back down tomorrow could really get squeezed if the powers that be decide to run it up tomorrow morning. PLTR basically the plaything of manipulators. Place your bets.
"Unless Report 100% greater then expected, this like any and all techs trade down. Already blew out, soon to be defunct, arkk fundThis is a good hold if you have the time, but who really wants to wait anymore"

March 2020 market crashed and fully recovered plus then some. Remember that as you sell at a loss.
lol i love the negative energy here - i am holding my 1000 shares and thankfully don't need to worry about day to day price movements
I like to gamble pre market. Sometimes I get a deal and sometimes I hate myself for not waiting. 250 shares added at $20.60
Long term hold. Ignoring the drop.
This company is going to be a beast in the future!
"Another 32.5 M contract from USAF and spaceforce, yet got to see red"

"Listened to the entire call, can honestly say I have more conviction than ever. Shayam Sankar on new Ai, a few steps from skynet. Skynet, let it sink in. Long term horizon @ $4b in 5 years this is cheap. They always beat guidance to likely $5-$6m."
Green Again
"The longer a stock is in a consolidation phase the sharper it will rise once the time comes. Amazon, Tesla, Square, etc all followed that same pattern. Buy now, don’t look back years later when this becomes an Amazon and only have your memes and complaints to comfort you."
13F files can be checked with Charles Schwab and Karp and Insiders are selling now! go check!
This is a young stock. There will be many other dips to come. Just be disciplined if you are a long term investor like me. No chasing.
Buy calls or puts for this earnings? which one
How’s the golf game going Dominic Decoco? Hope your $19.20 buy order went through.
"Today we can have some ups, then next days down again."
"where is the disconnect? new contracts, great news.....only 22 bucks. yet my daughter is in Dogecoin and she laughs at me. I'm like....#$%$ is going on ?...the Universe is upside down."
Can anyone tell me how the stock price is going up if they are going to issue 550M shares in the next few years and still there are 20b unreleased shares. It doesn't matter how many contracts they sign or how good they are doing. They are just scamming outside investors.

"It may close the gap at $16.10 and find support at $16.00. When one of my stocks is HEAVILY SHORTED and drops in price but the fundamentals of the company haven’t changed, I’ll average down and hold. This is a good company to get in on the ground floor. SHORTS look for immediate gains, this company is a long term hold like Google."
Pure Manipulation by Hedge Funds....A Squeeze will come sooner or later...This Company is another Google !!
"Inflation is increasing, which will increase rates, which increases discount rates, which will lower valuation, which makes this company less valuable. This is going down to 15."
You need CONVICTION in Pltr!!! Look how Thiel and Karp are doing their job 
Is this two days in a row that it’s green?
FXStreet saying PLTR will go to $14.33. A delicious shorting opportunity.
not celebrating until I breakeven at $42.64

Let the recovery begin
"Posted this yesterday: “Max pain around 17.2 if you believe in fibonacci retracements. Brace for it, but... nothing fundamentally about the company or the market has changed. My gut says this will not be the armageddon that crashes the market just yet. Tech, the nasdaq, and stocks overall will resume their advance and soar to new highs in a few months.”"
This is for entertainment purposes only
What an amazing earnings :O
Sad for those who sold at a loss.
Earnings was great but this is a long term investment for me. Don’t sell on small gains hold and you’ll be wealthy
Incredible volume again....HOLD
Listen here. I bought last week this stock for the first time because I realised this company is now undervalued.Load the absolute TRUCK. Going in 5k shares deep.
Blackrock bought 218M today
Bears..... get covering it’s our turn now
we will be fine
hope this seller is done.

Bears disappeared so quick lol
Sell everything folks
I'm stressing out... maybe I should add more
Still down -20% with 24 shares. But I will hold this so long... I am 21y old and currently I am studying information management. What I know about cybersecurity and data mining this company will be huge in long term.
if this company is so bad then why do you have to spend so much time trying to convince people to sell it?
"As painful as it is, the fluctuation from $10 up to $37 then back to $20 is not uncommon for longer term high-growth stocks. Just look, for example, at the wild ride NVDA had before it became a hundred-bagger winner."
It doesn’t matter what the results are. I feel like it will go down anyway unless Karp beats estimates by at least 300%
"EVERY DAY since $42 I tell you it’s going to $9, get out. And every day you keep holding the bag and watching it get closer to $9! Good job!"
Sold
"What's your train of thought if you knew PLTR would be $175 by January 2024? Would you sell your car, house, all ""other stocks""...........would you work overtime for extra pay in order to buy more PLTR? What would you do?"
The true joy of owning PLTR shares is more than making money. It gives me a reason to read this chat and see Dominic Decoco fighting Steven everyday! 
"My SmartStops service puts PLTR in a normal state at about $24.26 and has a conservative stops loss set to 17.23. I think the buyers are going to jump on around $24. Probably Friday, my guess. Why is there not a Very, Very Bullish selection for this stock???"
I expect a rapid rise of shares tomorrow as PLTR will be a buyers market starting now.
$24 by next week...
"Hear that soft, wheezy whimper on the wind?? That just the shorts curling up in the fetal position sniveling to themselves mumbling, ""But I am right...i know I am right...'"
-10% pre market after 49% revenue growth ....
$PLTR on Tuesday
Holding beautifully
What is the deal with PLTR? Only red stock on my board. Getting hard not to sell and move on to something that moves upward
Friday +23$
"I try to not watch everyday on my stock-growth but rather strive for improvement through learning what it means to be a good person for my peers. The money will come, this is set."
I’m curious if anyone holding an average of $35 and above? How many shares do you have?
Is the down ward pressure priced in the earnings?
They need to make some money this earnings release and announce stock buy backs
Bears BTFO
Give me a reason why I should buy at this level and not much lower?
They had some interesting insights about PLTR on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Who sold today at $17 and more importantly who sold premarket at $16?? Why????? Pretty decent quarterly report. Most likely everyone here had bought this stock in the $20's before today. Why would you decide to sell at $16 or $17 of all days? I never buy or sell the first hour of trading or last hour. It is just a hairball. Plus when I buy I hold for years until the fundamentals change. The only fundamentals changing with Palantir is they are getting more customers and more profits.
"Guys they’re making contracts, they have no debt cash on hand and lots of revenue, Karp said to LEAVE if you’re looking for a quick swing trade because it’s a long term stock with lots of future guidance plans."
Not looking good for the week before earnings I hope they are super duper good for my fellow palantiers and this hit 28 and then you guys can leave the boat and re buy at 22 again
I literally just posted a link to a job opening seeking someone with PLTR experience and they removed it. That normal here?
Citigroup gives PLTR new price target of $170

"I like this guy on YouTube. Check it out longs. Clowns, no need to watch. https://youtu.be/YMaWer7stbA"
"Interesting how this got upgraded after all the analysts and so call heavy hitting experts bashed this company until they them selves secured a sizable stake in the company last week. Now they are stoking the fire on palantir. It’s all a rigged freaking game. Not news but calling it. So with that said always do your due diligence yourself and screw what the so called experts say. Heads up on history, during the 07 to 10 financial crisis, there are a lot of repeat history going on here, if you go back and trend market sectors and such.Right now everyone knows the logistics situation is no bueno! Back then ocean shipping stocks went through the roof because of lack of ships. Freight rates where all time highs. Well guess what those ocean freight stocks are up 400% with 65% owned by institutions. Most of them have less than 150 million shares of float. Check the BDI and FBX shipping rates. Most rates are over 600% and will continue for 18 to 36 months until all the backlog and logistics are worked out with the world. Trend these shipping stocks back to the financial crisis and apply to today’s scenario but x5 worse than back then.The big boys are cornering this market. Look at institutional ownership in the stats column.Peace out!"
32mil new contract for PLTR and they keep coming
"Thinking back to TWLO being $62 in Sept 2016. Then by November that year it dropped to $32 and a few months later down to $24. Stock was hated. Today it's $294 after a steep sell off. In Feb this year it was $443. Point is, that major drops create million dollar opportunities. Oh to have loaded up on TWLO at $24."
"Selling is contagious as a Virus, too many coco cheerleaders here with tiny amounts of stock."
Amazing how the shorts come out of their termite nests every time this is red. I need to spray them with Raid.
"I've bought PINS at 23~35 back in 2019. Guess what, I 'lost faith' in the stock and sold in the teens with loss. Now look where it is.It's an embarrassing story but people always regret selling early.I'm not making the same mistake again of course.I think PLTR is a long term play (AT LEAST 2~3 years).You make money in the stock market by 1) being patient2) buying on red days3) and NOT selling when everyone else pack sells.don't regret two years later like I did.'I'm not a financial advisor. This is just my opinion'"
"@Amir you are long and weak - be honest, you've lost money here.Dear @Kol, Below is my answer to you and all those concerned. Yes indeed I am. What does an investor mean? The goal is to make a profit, but there are bumps in the road. To me, it means believing and understanding the company's activities, monitoring performance, identifying and listening to reliable and professional people, load at opportunity prices and being mentally strong along the way i.e. patient. This is what I do with gains or losses. In the message board here, I identify investors doing so. At the same time, there are young investors, who on red days are stressed and leave the stock. This is due to a lack of understanding / belief in the company, investment in the company as a result of rumors of quick profit and mainly a lack of mental strength. In my worldview I know I do not know everything and therefore listen to experienced people and learn. Recommend."
"It’s simple, buy and hold. If it goes down buy more. Sell in 5+ years and you won’t regret it."
So nice to see Pltr and my account on the green side.
If all the Tuts Buy up their desired shares what makes it go to 100? Retail investors? International ?
"OMG. News, contracts every month. Genius CEO, great business model. This isn't moving now, when it starts to then the sky is the limit."
"Lots of new 13Fs filed today. Here’s one of note. 5/18/2021 Duquesne Family Office LLC 5,983,992 $139.37M"

It was up a minute ago!
"We are going to have 5 Green Days in a row!! Short crying, us holding, everybody is happy "
Can’t believe shorts fell into this trap. Amazing.
Anyone guesses on how q1 earnings will be? Serious answers
Just read it correctly; adjusting for one time item EPS is at $.04 cents vs analyst forecast of $.04 cents. What matters is commercial customers grow at 75% rate. I won’t be surprised if we open in green at 9.30 am. GL
Today another oppurtunity given to buy. Consider yourself VERY lucky to enter at this price.
I don’t think earnings are going to do anything any good news and this sinks
Under $ 10 is a fair price.
Elon tanked BTC for Palantir to pick up for the low low. Never forget the ties of PayPal Mafia. Elon and Thiel are tight nit
might tade to 18 dollars and then on earning stay around there for a while...why not
PLTR: Double bottom out...ready to move higher from here. Hope for a strong open tomorrow.
PLTR will make 32% operating margins on $5 Billion in revenue by 2025. If you are a long term holder just continue to add shares.
Nothing makes sense in the stock market these days ! $50.00 here we come !!!
"Congrats shorts, let us enjoy counting money, let dreaming bulls enjoy dreams which paid by their hard earning ."
Great news = PLTR down...Nice !
"Recent Larger Accumulation by Founders Fund II Management, LLC PLTR=21,302,448 shares, 100.00% of the total portfolio. Shares added by 51508.52%"
Are my eyes deceiving me? I was ready to stomach a -15% day and we’re actually green? Color me surprised
Timing is everything. My 7000 shares short was covered @17.95.
I can only average down so much...
Perhaps funds are pouring into growth and valued again! I mean fund managers have to make money for their clients in form of equities right? They can’t just stay away from equity market forever!
palantir was the ultimate YOUTUBE hype stock.. valuations and PEs matter
17$ today? Easy.
"Imagine Karp got a kick out of selling some of his before earnings, chase away the shorties."
Good thing I held and did not react to Pre-Market BS. Lesson = Keep Holding Stay Long and Strong Palantards!
If nasdaq turns red will see 19 today
"If this company is so great, why do insiders need to sell when the stock has been kick down and beat up. If Karp knew it was going to be a good ER, he would have held a bit longer. But, then again, he knows and that's why he sold."
I want to be loaded up before the massive squeeze starts!
I sold my house to buy more PLTR
"Katie picked up 67,000 shares..."
"For those people rushing to take their money out of stocks into crypto. (You should’ve already had money in both) and don’t load up on bubble asset because another is currently lacking. I FOMO’D into BAC last summer at $29 watched it drop to $20 and come back over the next 6 months. I sold as soon as I broke even again. Right after, BAC exploded and sits at $41 now. Just shut up and hold."
I am 5K shares at $22.50 predicting they will have an earnings surprise of 100%. Not sure why just think they are killing it.

Don't forget - the real valuation of this stock is $5-7. Still a lot of toom to go down
"Q4 2020 commercial business grew over 100%. 2021, it will be $1B. Add over $1B more for Gov't, PLTR revenue will hit $2B this year."
Pentagon said. 16T up for grabs over the next decade in contracts.. with 8B a year for R&D... what company do you know that can use the backs of the gvment to improve their commercial product at no cost?
Sharks have successfully transferred your money to them. They are accumulating your cheap shares!
KARP receives one share for 1 cent ! You buy for $20.00 - GREAT BUSINESS !
I've successfully convinced the 3 most important people in my life to hold onto PLTR through the ups and downs...1. Me2. Myself 3. ISorry if you didn't make the list...
"What's possible tomorrow? 20%, 30%? PLTR is still incredibly cheap!!!"

Bought more at $ 19.87

"""Palantir hired its first U.S. government chief medical officer from IBM as the data analytics company doubles down on its life sciences business.While the company made its name in software used by government defense agencies, its health-care sector has become its fastest-growing U.S. government business, doubling over the past year.In his new role, Dr. Bill Kassler wants to help put Palantir's technology in the hands of researchers who can use it to make smart decisions in the next pandemic."""
"bought some at 19.3, if it goes down lower i might buy some more"
Way to go PLTR! Continue the climb!
20 years in business and company was NEVR profitable because the insiders take gigantic profit before the financial report! TOTAL SCAM
I wish my gf went down this ez
"Lot of Bashers saying back to 10. honestly I really don't mind, I don't need that money for next month rental."
"Ok guys, looks like Amazon will lead the market higher. They reported a very strong quarter. April showers brings May flowers. : )"
"Karp does not care , this is his exit strategy folks how else was he going to get his money out.IPO was the exit plan"
BUBBLE trying to attract new bag-holders
"I believe AT&T had a great quarter, a great earnings report today, because it has been using Palantir. Verizon did not have a great quarter, as it lost out to AT&T and its Palantir guidance. Many words and phrases and strategies used by AT&T's CEO today, during the earnings call, seem to be those used by Palantir. I have to buy some Palantir."
Clown investing 101: sell when others are selling.
"Nasdaq on the rise, PLTR turning green, STEM moving up"
Great results and go up today! This is free money
500 more in the books. Only the brave will be rewarded.
Is not going to Zero guys! This is another opportunity to get in at a discount! Earnings were FANTASTIC!!!
Pltr is going to GO BIG TOMORROW BEFORE EARNINGS ON MONDAY!The volume will be insane.Cramer and CNBC news mentioned PLTR more than 2 times last week.Do not underestimate tomorrow's gains.

I did say it was wedging to the upside yesterday 
the legendary White star fortune teller told me this pltr is next new dawn...bought 9000 shares..lets go!
Guess jeremys buying today
One of the ELITE fund managers is continuously adding and trending PLTR in 2 separate holdings ARKK and ARKW towards TOP 10 weight in each fund and I'm supposed to listen to bearish posts when I have 10 year vision and plenty of patience? Cool story shorty!
OMG here is the RED day again...please Lord Help us!
really? how low it can go?
Dead stock
37 billion dollar market cap......is this real?
At 8$ the valuation is way more reasonable . Thats where I bought it the first time and sold for a nice return
"Already choosing my Lambo, we goin‘ 25$ at/end of May."
"Just know, the institutional buyers are watching, they respond to consecutive positive reports. They ignore retail traders and emotions. PLTR is great LONG play, ocean waves, not pond ripples."
"Can someone explain me the snowflake, how can they justify their market cap? Pltr revenues are so much better, why wall street loves snow more? What's the catalyst ?"
Can't wait for the day when Palantir partners with a privacy oriented company like Apple to manage their data.
Is Cathie up still?
There is zero doubt this is going up in the future whether it takes 5 months or 5 years. Why is it trending on Yahoo right now is my question.
Upgrades are coming.
wall street 1%...
easy double by January.
"My fellow PLTR homies,1. It's The Final Countdown = 3 Trading Days Left until that Faithfull May-11-2021 Earnings Report2. I am very bruised... but bring it on...3. Maybe tomorrow will be a Green Day for our PLTR babies?4. My personal opinion: Mr. Karp should NOT be in charge of The Palantir Press and Investor Relations. He's just NOT cut out for that kind of job...Peace!"
RSI is blowing up and the volume is 60+ million
Shorts? Where are you all?
"I see a lot of people stuck with this stock and I'm sorry, fortunately I have an avg price of 19.20 and if it goes down to 15 I will buy heavily, this company represents the future!!"
I only have a couple hundred shares so it’s not a large position in my stocks.I’m not connecting the dots regarding the Bitcoin and it’s business.
The last act of the tragedy. Teenage prices are here. Now we will quickly see single numbers. Keep listening to pumpers and lose your money.
it will never see below 20 again....never.
Added more. This is the way…
It seems that today is beginning of another correction.Hope we can hold $21.
A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investing scam which generates returns for earlier investors with money taken from later investors. This is similar to a pyramid scheme in that both are based on using new investors' funds to pay the earlier backers.
$22-24 next week
"Bloomberg about PLTR, just now: 43% growth expectation in Q2. 11 New customers in Q1."
$40 very soon July possibly!!! Memorial Day rally !!!
"Strong finish! The red days have been relentless and gut wrenching but amazing discount, added 225. Ready for a Green Day tomorrow!"
Uve been played by con artists I’m telling you is still time to add This thing will be 300$ in 5 years Just chill It’s called investing!!!
Mute the shorts. do your own research. They talk bs on every stock. Long and strong
Nasdaq down while PLTR is up... something is cooking
this is going to save ark!
"Some sharks know investors’ sentiment, they will continue to manipulate the stock. Time will tell!"
OTW to $40's...
A lot of shorts are closing their positions. Tie that in with the influx of institutional buying happening.. not surprised.
Another clean easy break through 24. Should become support soon.
"If you need future green growth, Planthere."
"Enjoy the ride to $22.5 PLTR bagholders, then it's back down to new lows. We have been through this song and dance many times before."

Holding strong in a sea of red!
Hedge funds are over-leveraged. We are seeing a sell-off due to the irresponsibility of wall street. Great buying opportunity today and tomorrow. PLTR is the future.
Good earnings aren't helping growth stocks right now. Good or bad earnings tomorrow morning probably won't help the sell off.
Buying options for ER good idea?? Some stocks go down even ER beat any opinions
When a CEO tells you to buy other stocks… and not his…. Believe him… 
"Load up under 15, market at all times high. Inflation fears."
another big contract with cellularity. just released more contracts to come stock should start moving up any day now
Shorts gotta start wondering what might happen if that earnings report is better than expected. Hubris tends to bring chaos. Isn't that life?
"expectations.I share with you my thoughts ahead of the release of the balance sheet in a few days. Obviously, this post is for long-term holders.I thank everyone else in advance for not answering.Everyone is expecting a big rise in the stock ahead of the first quarter reports for 2021.I'm not sure that is indeed what will happen! I will try to explain.The indicators that I will diagnose the company are:Revenue-These are long-term contracts, and the question is what will the company choose to refer for the reporting quarter?What can we learn about the future revenue vector from sustainable agreements?Revenue distribution-I expect an increase in the commercial sector.I will also try to understand the source of income (Licenses, manpower, cloud storage agreement with Amazon, how much of the revenue came from IBM sales people?).Expenses -Critical to understanding the direction of the company.If this item increases, it can significantly reduce profit or lead to loss.It is therefore necessary to understand the distribution of expenses.In other words: Did the agreements we heard about (and many others we did not hear about) lead to accelerated employee hiring? Did they receive shares / options in accordance with the company's policy?Investments -We have heard about investments in various fields. What is their impact? Is a revenue vector expected from them? How much was referring in the quarter?In summary, profit and / or revenue can be good even if they are less than expectations. The most important thing is to examine the essence of the numbers. Deep inside.Hope I did not disappoint you in this opinion.Correct me if I'm wrong.English is not my first language and therefore apologizes in advance for syntax errors.Amir"
I have an option at 22 dollar expire next year. Let see how much this baby boy can make me.... 60 is too much to ask for?
I guarantee with absolute certainty pltr will go throught the roof tonight no question they will report excellent revenues in their report I'm not pumping I could care less if you buy or sell it won't effect my I'm in since it's IPO I still believe after the earnings report the shorts will battle to get this down to $16 but when earnings come out with great news which they should after all the amount of contracts that were secured since January have been great I think people forgot that
Options here too expensive. They need a 60% haircut then I'll buy in.
IRS gave Palantir contract for tax evasion
"Dummies on this board think they know better than the ceo.Karp stated in an interview that they need the stock based compensation to recruit top tier talent.But,yeah he has no long term plan and hes just wants to sell as many shares as possible."
Let’s go 
Karp and insiders love the price action despite huge losses in Q1. It's good for their upcoming new 600M shares.
No better than Mcafee and JFROG
Cathie were so  $1 after ER
"Oh Karnak the Magnificant, aka CovertAction...where art thou?"
Sleeping giant
Only need a rise of $7 per share and I'll be even money! :)
Every analyst is lowering the price is it good or bad

Big news is coming.I can feel it.
PLTR: accumulating and getting ready price surge....on good ER. Buy range at this price. Bullish
"Hi guys, I'm an PLTR long term investor and weekly buyers. Anyone know why the number of institutions holding PLTR is going up every week but the percentage of institutions holding is going down? This make no sense to me. Thank in advance for anyone can respond to this."
"I have no idea what the earnings are...but if you've been watching, you'll know that MANY of the high-volatility stocks have been getting hammered before earnings (regardless of whether they end up good or not)."
Huge beat!

how the shorts doing ? lol
Will buy more when we see $5
When you thought it cannot go any lower. Time for a Dodge City!
"To all long term PLTR holders - and that means you - please pause and recall some relevant John Maynard Keynesquotes, especially if you bought PLTR on margin:“Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.”""In the long run we are all dead“I was bullish on PLTR but management breached my threshhold of pain and I had to bail at 21.Good news brings a drop in price, bad news brings a drop in price. What do you think earnings will bring? Really? And what about the millions (really millions) of shares Cathy Wood has bought? Used to be the ""Cathy put"" that would prevent a drop below 23. And then, uh, 21. And now? 19.90. Can she save this stock? Every morning Ark presents what it bought and sold the previous day, and then guys on Reddit breathlessly report that ""Cathy bought over 700,000 shares of Palantir."" I believe in the company, but hey, there are less painful ways to make a buck in this market."
Those buying today you have guts and probably are genius.
CNBC fast money says it's going to 13....how much should I sell before taking a bath

"Hedge funds need a safe exist, so they have analyst lower the price target to trigger a sell off so they can cover their options. Not first time this happen and wouldn’t the last. If anything went wrong, blame on Robinhood and retail investors instead of all these hedge funds"
please bring this back to 25 :-)
"Up the end of the day, congrats sharks! They will successfully complete their short mission of transferring shares from weak hands for free to their account . By tomorrow morning, sharks will be laughing and as always, weak hands will be crying! The world is that brutal!"
From the ER call this morning :“It also expects Palantir to produce $150 million in adjusted free cash flow in 2021.”Stay long my friends... !!!
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Thetraderguide.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
Next week more on green days! So this is your last chance to buy the dip! 
PLTR would be in the 30s easily if it wasn't insiders selling for the last several months.
$PLTR's favorite color - RED !

We are trending on Yahoo finance
I dont know why u buy this when u could have gotten snow under 190

"It hurts to admit it, but you got to give credit where credit is due. The shorts have been right call 90% of the time on this stock. Not sure if it's a stock-based compensation, Alex's rhetoric￼, The market makers, or a combination of all of the above. I think Palantir will prevail in the end. But it's hard to hold."
30% rev growth x 4 years = just shy of a billion dollar rev company. Not bad..
"I think we need to ask ourselves some basic questions : 1) whether this Company is a fly by night company with dodgy products ( if so , how does it survive for so long and be able to be qualified as vendor by US Govt ) 2) is there growth potential for this company? Is the business sound with wide economic moat ? ( I think the high switching cost for users is definitely in place) . 3) is there any fundamental shift in the Marco environment that will obsolete this product ? If u can go thru the above questions and draw the conclusion . You will not be ruffled by the current price fluctuation. Bec money makers all shaking out weak players in order the cream the market ! Last question , how do u rank this stock against GameStop ?"
Cathy Wood will be on CNBC at 3 p.m. today. Will close up over $1.50 today.Mark this post

@CoverAction... Where are you?
This stock doesn’t have a support no more only resistance tomorrow it’s another day but for now charts are saying something different thanks
Down we go with the inflation numbers which cannot be good considering the housing and meat prices.
"Are insiders buying? That is a question worth raising with every stock one considers purchasing, I’ve been told...."
I don’t get it! HOW does a company make massive amounts of profit and DROP in value??? How the F is that possible??? There’s just NO rhyme or reason to this contradiction man!
PLTR will buy Bitcoin like Microstrategy. Confirmed in CNBC.
bought more... my avg is down to 21.25... keep selling weak hands :) Would love to buy more if it goes below 20 which is very unlikely.
Bought 50 call for 50 2023
its only going to get worse. look arround at all the tech stks. its a WIPEOUT. if u have 2 be in this one sell now and buy it back when it gets much cheaper. yesterday was a gift.
George Soros fund dissolves their stake in PLTR. He doesn't like our business practices bye!
"MSCI US Equity Indexes: There will be four securities added to and 11 securities deleted from the MSCI US Large Cap 300 Index. The three largest additions to the MSCI US Large Cap 300 Index measured by full company market capitalization will be Palantir Technologies A, Liberty Broadband A and Liberty Broadband C."
"here's the deal. the stock is gone be fantastic long term, head over the next 3 months I think it's going to be up and down along with a lot of other stocks in the market in so I don't know about y'all but if it gets a spike, I'm buying and selling I'm going to trade it through the summer. go along after the next big earnings report"
"Palantir, as with other Tech stocks, has been tracking the Nasdaq, which has been dropping since 26th April.When Q1 comes out on the 11th watch Palantir break out."
"Look at that volume. I can’t wait to see all the institutions that bought up the shares from the weaklings. Oh and shorties, take your own advice and take your profits and run. This is a cash machine that ain’t slowing down. Do you have any idea the damage 50 top notch salespeople can make? I came from the enterprise software space. Salespeople of this caliber are SUPER AGGRESSIVE and COMPETITIVE. The 30% annual growth rate is a walk in the park joke. The internal stretch number is a heck of a lot higher. Load up."
"Told ya, another 30% correction is coming."
guys I sold at loss so I'm guessing the stock will go up now lol
Shorts are burning
Palantir was picked by Mr. Wonderful in the 2021 CNBC Halftime Draft. This stock could be a multi bagger by the end of the year!
"I may be right, I may be wrong, but for some reason I feel really good about the price actions on PLTR today."
"Imagine this: the year is 2025, PLTR is set to make over $5b in revenue, is profitable, and shares are no longer being diluted. Shares will be at $100 no problem. This is what you’re buying, it doesn’t matter whether you get in at $17 or $22 you’ll be fine"
BREAKING NEWS....Kathy Wood buys $1B worth of PLTR @ $19.95Pretty sure you will see this article today or tomorrow
"Lol, so much fear for those who does not have time to be patient."
Wouldnt it be something if palantir get awarded a cyber security contract for the colonial pipeline.... 
We should be in the $30's...
I'm SO EXCITED!!! I just KNOW that PLTR will be $900. by Friday.
$24 by the end of the week. $27 in 2 weeks.
The entire stock market is up. Why is Palantir down? Who is selling?
Palantir owes us a 3 dollar day
"I keep typing it over and over. If you believe in your research then don’t worry sit back and watch your gains, Wall Street can’t ignore good companies forever because that’s not how you make money."
Greed is gonna get alot of shorts soon
What a great day for all of the PLTR longs. They only lost 2 percent of their investment today.High fives around!
The real meaning of growth stocks is success in persuading rational people to put their minds aside and gladly buy anything at any price without logical and realistic reasons !
Let’s get it. 45 today
NEW WIN for Palantir on April 5th. Coast Guard $11.3M
"Can someone, anyone, give a simple explanation of what this company does? It's seems to be a mystery."
I dont like to lose
2 red days in a row with market pretty much green across the board. How many consecutive red days will we see this time around? My guess enough to bring this back down to the $16 level.
Another MILLIiiii for Cathie!!
30% of my portfolio down 10% in a day. Not worried at all 
"Also, PLTR was technically profitable by $200M last year on a near doubling of revenue. Because the company went public through a direct listing not IPO, granting their employees around $1.5B in stock options reflect a loss which it is but adjusted PLTR is profitable."
yes only when Karp stops his printer
I think the problem with Palantir is that no one knows what the valuation is. It can be $15 or it can be $150
It’s red again. 
"In context, though, the kicker is the insider selling. Going back to October 2020, the main executives — including CEO Alexander Karp — have been cashing in on PLTR stock.Which, you know, is capitalism. But if Palantir and its products are so great, why isn’t anyone on the inside buying PLTR?"
"It’s a cliche but we’ll be on firm ground when the weak hands have been eradicated. In the meantime, buy their shares as you can afford."
Power hour fa sho!
If Cathie and her friends like Northern Trust Corp and Geode Capital Management LLC bought all the shares...why is it tanking???? Why???
"Coiled Spring Baby, can’t wait for the day."
Another 1M shares bought by @CathieDWood Conviction is high high. $PLTR weights 1.55% of $ARKK and 1.6% of $ARKW
Catherine Wood digging a deeper hole she will not be able to get out of￼
"Waiting for the price to come down to $10, then I'll think about buying this stock"
Look at the strength
listen up folks Tuesday morning they going to pump it down short hard and then they going to buy it back. don't sell revenues are going to be fantastic
"L gendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Monday, shares of Palantir Technologies Inc (Symbol: PLTR) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.6, after changing hands as low as $18.18 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 71.0. A bullish investor could look at PLTR's 29.6 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself"
This went down alot .. im not getting overconfident but optimistic
Cathis woods adds almost 100 million in shares
Could end in 17s today.
ARKK bought another 2.6M shares yesterday. Institutions are loading fellas. Add/hold strong. GL
PLTR over 150% up since Sept.
"Good report, FREE CASH FLOW !!! Like it."

"Guys, market correction!!Chill, have a glass of wine, they will come back into growth stocks, they always do!! EARNING CALL MONSTER TOMORROW!!"

Now Palantir has TWO nations under Government/Military contract. Germany is next. Then the EU at large. Nice break with the job numbers guys. It was looking like a boss fight against the Hedge Funds. Stay strong.
"4338 w/ an avg of 20. Letting this thing do what it does for the next 10+ years and focusing on other investments. It's a winner, long-term. Watching this day by day is a waste of time. Ciao, everyone, and the best of luck!"
ARK got 58 mil in the dip...
You only loose when you sell. Have confidence and patience and stop sweating the short term. This is the new mega trend with no competitions. The top 500 companies know they have to use Foundry if they want to stay competitive. It’s a must have technology. Peace.
the stock is dropping because it's overvalued
why is going down????
Pltr expects revenue growth of AT LEAST 30% per year for next 5 years. THATS why the stock is up.

Sell
"If it goes to $21 and stays there, then it will officially uptrend again !"

Congrats to all the Bears.
this stock is going to be a game changer for years. accumulate and wait. Like a fine wine sit back and give it time!!!!
i dont get what the point of bashing this stock so hard is... is the goal really to scare investors away to load up at the floor so in 2 years when this stock is at like 50+ whoever panic sold down here loses?
Market is crashing sell
662 shares. 11 call contracts. this is about 50% of my portfolio.
How many more weak hands going to jump ship today?
Dare I say this will close green? Best bargain on the market? Real company with massive growth potential that will only increase due to inflation (they help all those supply chains run more efficiently)? Growing roster of commercial and gov clients who need them more than ever?
Citigroup price target 170$
One positive aspect of a red week: the usual friday afternoon sell-off may not happen today!

I added some long term calls on Palantir to accompany my shares!
It’s been a pleasure losing money with you all
"If you panic sell PLTR, you better look around and panic sell the rest of your tech stocks."
This should have been one of those days that’s this jumps 5% and more with the rest of high growth but it’s a acting weird. Anyway our day will come
Be greedy when everyone else is scared. Good Luck.
"PLTR"" Strong rebound is near term.... Holding"
"Monteforte: Palantirs earnings report was absolutely ""phenomenal""!!! Especially seeing that they expected to lose 28M on operating income, but instead made 151M!!! They are now adding more large commercial customers than the other big boys! They added oil giant BP well! Like l said before, l would not at all be surprised if a behemoth like MSFT made a move for them in the future! There's a reason why we see almost 100 hundred million shares trade everyday!"
"Even good earnings can't help this scrap.what? back to 24,So,big deal,this is a long Bear Trap !!!"
It aint pltr The last4 months have been a disgrace. Ceo and insiders using pltr as their own little piggy bank. Awarding themselves millions of shares and dumping old ones no matter the price. 45 to 18. Facts speak for themselves. See u at 10. 18 yrs. 0 profit meanwhile ceo and insiders getting rich while reg shareholders get the shaft. Where am I wrong. I would like to know how much ceo raked in altogether between his crazy salary and dumping mill of shares every time. Every single time
$PLTR might join QQQ..

I am still holding brought my cost average down a little. Have been here since IPO but added as it was going up so cost averaged during down side. I believe in this company and what it does. I don't have as many shares as some of you but will keep adding.

We had 8 days of red. Is this day going to be the 9th or is it going to be the 1st of many green days coming?
"I don't understand, the principles of economics tell us to believe that stocks protect us from inflation, because it is a different value. Stocks are an inflation cushion. Stocks, their growth protects us from inflation. There should be growth at this point, not panic, but most don't know the rules of economics. Either way, it should rise in the near term, as people will be shifting from traditional money, depreciated by inflation, towards stocks."

"Today's action was mostly the result of two things. Some shorts covering, and daytraders getting in for a quick profit off the lower trendline. When the price reaches 22.5/23, we will be at the upper trendline, in which the traders that bought today will start selling, and a new round of shorts will come in. Then, it's back down to the lower trendline and new lows. Mark this post."
incredible cheap!
which do u prefer shares or leap options?
"My fellow PLTR homies,1. After reading many comments, I get the impression that PLTR will be going up this week.2. It also seems that many commentators are WORRIED that the GODS who control and manipulate the PLTR stock will let PLTR go to about $24, before they gently bring it back down to the $21 level.3. Having said the above, are there any serious indications that PLTR will break into the $26 to $30 levels and stay there for a few weeks?4. From my personal observation and the chaos that I saw since Feb and Mar-2021, I have already decided to liquidate half of my PLTR stock when it reaches the $24 to $25 level because I need some dry powder to use for other stocks. I am patiently waiting...Peace!"

The BIG BOYS (Hedge Funds, Shorts, etc...) use After Hours to LOWER the price to TRICK the SCARED LONGS to sell their PLTR babies for cheap 5. Don't fall for this TRICK.6. Hold on to your PLTR babies and only sell (if you have to) in the $30 to $50 range...Peace!"
Well that was a tasty dip. I had to pick up more. Still cheap. Got to run. Have fun today.
"I am long term believe in this stock - at first investors didn’t love Facebook when they went IPO - they didn’t have a clue how it would make money - it went from the 20’s to the teens, now look at the MC - I believe this will do the same."

"My fellow PLTR homies,1. I have lost faith in PLTR...2. I am extremely disappointed in how the PLTR stock and management have infuriated the investment community3. Just like many PLTR stock holders, it's very difficult to see 7 red days, then 2 small green days, then another 7 red days...4. In the last 3 months, there were many good catalyst events, such as Demo Day, NASDAQ rallies, good news about more clients added to PLTR, Cathie Wood buying millions of PLTR shares, etc...5. However, PLTR goes red on these positive events...6. Many commentators are clearly disappointed, and a few cheerleader are trying to convince the disappointed PLTR bag holders to wait 5 to 10 years, without any solid proof that PLTR can deliver on its promises...7. Many of us bag holders are not at ease when we clearly see 1.8 Billion shares of PLTR floating around and Mr. Karp and his employees keep liquidating their PLTR stock on a dairy basis and causing the stock price to stay low and mostly red8. Lost in PLTR HYPE...9. Fair enough?Peace!"

The company beats the earning why the strong selling ?
"PLTR has nearly twice the revenue as SNOW, yet SNOW has nearly twice the market cap of PLTR. If PLTR had the backing of Wall Street when it went public rather than doing a direct listing, it would probably be trading at around $50.00 today."

I love days like this for stocks I have faith in. It proves I know what I'm talking about once it corrects and skyrockets long-term.
Amazing stock!! YouTubers said this is a $300 stock!! 
Insiders are selling right up until the earnings report. Then after it will no doubt continue unabated. Really funny would be if they are selling during the CC.
"My weekend agenda,1. I will cry myself to sleep2. I already bought 2 Gallons of Chocolate ice-cream3.

"Big money trying to scare retail so make them sell their shares, and increase their short selling profits. They come to these boards to see how the moral and trust levels are. If people aren’t scared enough, they bash the stock even more and intensify the negative rumors/comments, to cause fear and doubt on investors. You should always hold on to your investments, big money just wants to steal your money, however, they can only short to a certain extent, so, if you hold the stock, no matter what, it will always recover at some point, specially Palantir that is a leader and will be a 1 Trillion company. Don’t give your money away, hold your shares."

The big money sees the little guy running scared, so they buy puts and short stocks driving down prices even further, scaring more shares out of weak hands. When the selling abates, they sell their puts , cover their shorts and buy buy buy. Like taking candy from babes."
Just bought a Put . Now it should recover some
cathie was just fomo
No rats today?
"loaded up again at 18.6 after selling off yesterday at 20.40,,, up to 27k shares noww,,,,,goooooo pltr"
Still gonna go nowhere today....just gotta buckle in for the long haul.
"My fellow PLTR homies,It's the moment of truth...My UNREALIZED DREAM:1. By 8am tomorrow morning, Papa Karp will release the AWESOME PLTR Earnings Report2. Then BOOM... PLTR stock price goes to $30 per share3. I sell ALL my PLTR stocks4. I get two airplane tickets to the Bahamas5. I get me some wine, some steaks, some romantic candles, and it's going to be a sweaty night...HOWEVER...My GUT feeling is telling me this:...a. Go to Walmart...b. Buy some ""Preparation H"" = Hemorrhoids cream...c. Get some napkins for crying and a Gallon of chocolate ice-cream for comfort...d. Sleep on the coach because wifey doesn't know that we are going to live in a van down by the riverPeace!"
Congrats for all who bought on this dip! I did!
Palantir bright star in the Nasdaq sky.
Rally!!
I tried this morning at 17.60. Then it started falling again. Out at 17.30. I refuse to get stuck in this sort of thing.
PLTR is up 4.20% today
"With a wide range of applications for its services and many government customers, Palantir offers investors an excellent mix of safety and growth.....hello is anyone listening..."
"I don't know how you guys, but I love today's results. As expected. And remember, the said in 10-k (chapter about risks) that 1Q and 2Q usualy have worse earnings than 4Q. I will not sell a single share loong time."
"I can’t speak for those who bought at $35+ because my CB is $23. But It doesn’t matter because you should all keep holding the stock . Your invested in a company exposed to 3 of the fastest growing sectors in the world. PLTR offers exposure to Big data analytics, A.I., and Crypto where else can you get this for the price? Just relax and watch this summer run after earning season calms down."
"Thanks again weaklings. Lots of institutions also taking advantage of this opportunity. Here’s a notable one for today. Do you think they did their homework?5/4/2021 Commonwealth Equity Services LLC 650,816 $15.16M"
what is the difference between PLTR class A and Class B stock?
"co-founder Alex Karp’s total compensation this past year was $1.1 billion, much of it in PLTR stock options and awards...this is absolutley unacceptable for a company that all is doing is accumulating debts.."
"Why does Yahoo have PLTR pegged on the far right as ""overvalued""? What would be a correct value for this stock?"
ARK BUYS MORE TODAY 
Well....we will see...
What do they not teach you in school? Answer: Master your emotions.If You're going to invest and or day trade or swing trade stocks. This is crucial for success. In fact it is Important no matter what you do in life to master your emotions.
"So, Palantir can make Foundry free download to businesses to evaluate & trial. Them, they pay PLTR when they start using Foundry Software as a service....."
Don't sell PLTR until it crosses $21.00 (only if you have to sell)In fact don't sell until after $30.00
"Shorts come and go, just relax guys. good companies stay. Ya, pltr is going no where, they are just making more and more money everyday!"
If you were smart you bought the dip yesterday
To the moon
Looks like will crush earnings but still no profit due to Insiders multibillion compensation and bonus every Q.This caompany Motto: We Pay ourselves FIRST and then the rest with very tiny amount.
"Imagine betting against a company building a monopoly in the 3 fastest sectors: Big data analytics, AI, and Crpyto security. You are buying into a company with elite connections to multiple governments, corporations and a developing Foundry product which blows everything else out of the water. $>50 by end of summer"
What is everyone in at? 22 here.Share
Disruptive technologies sold all their shares in the last qtr .. Prob time to buy
Is Cathie selling?
Should be 36 by next earnings
Cathy is now at 21.63. Wonder if she will buy more to average even further down to 20.
Looks like this is going down to the mid-teens or lower this week. Biggest drop will come after earnings. What a fall from 45. At least we’ll no longer have to listen to perma bulls repeat that it’s up 150% since dpo lmao
With this massive volume squeeze is imminent 
I would buy more if I could...
Why is it falling?
nobody knows the trouble I am...nobody knows BUT Jesus......nobody...
LMAO look at the Nasdaq. Shorts do not even know how the stock market works.
what did we expect fed is printing money and it just going to imports anyway
"do not sell, let's goooo"
Bought more at open. Now up to 1533 shares and very confident. Just look at Teslas historic chart. Very much alike
"Someone check me here. Is this not Peter Thiels fund???13F5/17/2021 Founders Fund Ill Management LLC 22,120,875 $515.20M"
Cathie is the only catalyst this stock needs. 
Why any CEO sell their shares in billions when their earnings is right around the corner??Who does that? Unless you do not believe in the company.Do you really need to cash in billions in a day? What do you need a billions of dollar for? To buy your own country or an island in Hawaii?
Don't like the way this is trading. Feels like it is going lower.
"I already bought more once today. I guess I'll do it again. A gift, if you ask me."
Didn’t expect this to start green
With recent ransomware we should expect huge announcement soon involving PLTR as part of the solution in these space!!!!!
"I'm long as hell, but I must say it's an embarrassment for PLTR as a company to be in this predicament. Even today, going red? How many days in a row can this go down? This is their lowest price in 6 months. With earnings just two days away? I wonder: didn't they run the data on this? Wasn't there an algorithm to warn them of this? Didn't Karp run an investment firm before PLTR?"
it hurts
Today's close $18.06.
please ring the bell already
"Buy Buy Buy... PLTR is the new DogeCoin... No, it's better."
"Sorry shorts... All real investors are tired of this flat situation. Now it's time to reach the moon, we will see 50s soon!"
Should pop up today
Buy the dip! Right now!
"Experts be saying... even after big price drop, this stock is still overvalued!!!"
The CEO sold $1.8B worth of stock last month.... What a vote of confidence for the stock... NOT!! This company came public with 1.82B shares outstanding.... Good Luck with those earning...
Relax and ride it.
"It seems PLTR is resisting huge drop, potentially there could be a massive win to be announced soon. Will monitor the government contract award website. Fingers crossed."
"This is a long term stock. If you want to short or swing it, TESLA will print you money, not this one!"
Good God what a bloodbath! My losses are horrific!
HOLY GROWTH
22-23 by the end of the week.36-45 by year end.
stock based compensation is KILLING this stock all the time
Even ARKS won’t save PLTR anymore! Soon $10
ER is so good
More likely to see over 150m shares trade tomorrow. Institutions will go past 30%
RIP my wallet
"Every time Cathie Wood TALKS about Palantir, the PLTR stock goes down.We need a RESTRAINING ORDER against Cathie Wood in order for her to BE QUIET."
Climb into the close? Will the power hour make a comeback?
Buying more. But where
What’s happening?? How long side ways??
I just bought 100 shares of T and 200 shares of $pltr.
"In one day, Back to back progressive news or mentions in palantir, yet got to see this gem suffering from shorts"
Hold please don’t sell for a loss. Think long term
I wonder where karp was for the call. That isn't too common for the ceo not to be there if only to say a few words and roll it over to the cfo or coo. I guess I'm the only one to find that peculiar.
Cramer is protecting sales force.conglomerate. But pltr and c are playing on different fields.
"Hedge funds sharks are manipulating this stock so they can buy your shares for cheap. Q1 earning going to be astronomical. You got to be blind not to see the potential here. I have sold other stock to buy 2000 more shares, at this price it is a steal."
"Guys... if we know how great this company is, don’t you think institutions should know just as much as we do? No secrets here. The reason for Green Days is nothing but sharks now are more willing to invest into this Company at LOW LOW PRICE! fundamentals of company got even stronger these days. Sharks probably shorted to $17 then stole the shares from you at dirt cheap prices and then they just comfortably hold them until whenever. Those who got trapped were nothing but institutional trapped!"
"Cyber attack on Fuel Pipeline in US this week, will make PLTR even more important company. They need PLTR help for current and future security of all systeam that involve Data."
"New range 16-20 , previous range 20-24, get use to it for now"
Memealantir
You will see an article tomorrow....Kathy Wood buys 100M shares
I new generation of bag holders have been born over the last couple weeks. You might break even if you're lucky in 5 years.
21s 
Started from the bottom now we’re here
18.18 was the bottom it's going to close in the green today
What does this company do? Why should i invest? serious question
What just happened?

Added 900 shares @ $18.65
Breakout imminent at $21.04.....................!!!!!
"what's going on, Palantir not doing Palantir things?"
My prediction for may 11Eps around 12 cents/share
+5.01% Today!
"Analyst Estimates for tomorrow's Earnings Report is .04 a Share on $332.2 Million Dollars in Revenues, for the Quarter ending March 31st, 2021"
Time for scared investors who don’t believe in Palantir to give me a much cheaper price. Cough up those shares for me.
I have been shorting this stock the last 3 days
Nothing will stop the relentless selling.
"Could see low teens, even as low as IPO price. Great opportunity!"
IMAGINE SELLING AT THE BOTTOM
Party like it’s 1999.
"More I buy, more they go down LOL"
This one is forming a solid base and will take off hard one of these days
New shorties cover in 18 mnt :D :D :D :D lets gain
"Credit Esther for the topic. Posting to get some other view points:At first blush the identified TAM by Palantir of $119 Billion is still massive and provide ample runway for HUGE pltr returns considering current penetration.Then I read Zero to One and many Thiel Talks podcasts and he referenced what Google did early on to prevent the monopoly target on their back. It was eye opening and made me think “is palantir doing the same”. My immediate answer was “yes”. Reason being is that the $119 B market was specific to Govt and Commercial Enterprises who have $500 million in revenue or more“Our estimate of the TAM in the commercial sector is $56 billion. This estimate is arrived at by multiplying the number of potential customers around the world — defined broadly as approximately 6,000 companies with more than $500 million in annual revenue”- What I felt was this was vastly underestimated because we know darn well that a modular approach is now an option and procuring via AWS is also an option. That brings into play customers who generate revenues of $100 million to $500 million and the number of those institutions vastly outnumbers those with $500 million or above. Lastly - Mr. Sankar COO validated this for me with his comments in last earnings call of feeling the “commercial defense sector market” was now open to them and it’s $200 billion in annual spend.The market opportunity has been dramatically under played. These guys know what they’re doing. It’s investors who don’t know how to research and connect dots who can’t put these things together. Several of us on this board have.Long and strong"
now who voted for bidum?
Microsoft has 7.4 billion shares outstanding!!!
"2021-05-18 13F Jane Street Group, Llc 23.42 ave 5,024,451 shares"
"At some point ,they gonna have to buy to cover ...and that will start tomorrow..IMO"
"All in all, it was a successful day for longs today. Only down 3% even though the markets were green across the board today. Just think if the markets were in the red today. I it could have been a lot worse. Like most days for PLTR, it was a moral victory!"
Do we see $ 20 today
"The more the name Cathy wood pops up stating bought more, the more this goes down. I see 16 before 20."
"Wait, no dancing jewish dude meme today? Must be a green day"
Massive 05/21 and 05/14 call volume past 2 days.... look out
Nasdaq in free fall again
if you want to avoid a loss in the market stay away from the decoco's and the elton's. they will make you poor.
Hedge funds controlling the narrative once again.
1860 ? We need 1960 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nice sale today. Increased my position by 25%.
Well I feel better after buying 5k shares at 19.99 lol
No Pain no Gain...tough movement but hopefully long term with vision this will work out well.
Volume still very low. I Expect a remarkable move up by closing.
I would say a prayer if I was short
"Please, please just have a Green Day next week. At least one. Maybe two? Or is that too much to ask for"
"Of course, whales are playing with Palantir! That's why it's called Fraud Street! Hahaha"
Palantir wins part $1.67Bn contract with UK Government
Yearly revenue of meagre 341 million for a 34 billion company???
they are shaking the tree. hold and wait for big dip to buy more
From -10% pre open to +7%. Tells you current markets all emotions and not much fundamentals
PLTR it’s on fire what’s to finish at 21 today and continue the up trend congratulations longs
"This is what happens when there is an ""unlimited"" ability for the Karp and his gang to print more shares every day . I think they print 100 to 200 MIL shares per day for ""insiders"" so no matter how many shares retailors buy...CEO and the company has it beat. THEY ARE TAKING OUR MONEY EVERY TIME WE BUY A Share! wake up!!! This company has over 2BIL stocks floating and 2MIL shares are being added every day."
"Only annoyed I didn't get some of those $17 stocks. In my 12 years of investing, I've learned a thing or two about the true great winning stocks. I can for sure say $PLTR and $NIO ticks of all the right boxes, and is currently one of my biggest holdings that I will continue to buy and hold for the next few years. As boring as it sounds, these times are the best times to buy. People selling at lows to maybe get into Crypto highs, will only risk a double crash of their portfolio. Smart money is buying these lows, cause when the near Crypto bull run is over, and chip problem, inflation, etc is solved, guess where all the big money will be moving? Yes, u guessed right. And that's where you will have been holding and buying at the bottom, and everyone else will be FOMO'ing to get in. Do what you want, I'd recommend to buy and hold. Thank me in a few months."
To all of you who were bashing yourselves for not buying in earlier when the price was above 30. here's your chance
"Insiders know this is worth less than $10, which is why they continue to sell shares even at $18. Most companies buyback shares if their shares are undervalued. Some CEOs buy shares to indicate that. Not with this company. They dumping like the end is near. And no, don't tell me this is automated selling per their stock plan. They have the option to PAUSE the plan to stop selling (or buying)."
"Anything Cathie touches dies like this $tsla, $pltr, coin, $sq, $etc.....are dying slow bleeding ....omg"
Palantir is Maplelane Capital’s third largest position....after Google and Facebook. It is a big move —-somebody REALLY likes this company. We need more attention like this. It will come.....
"Another large purchase by an institution panic sellers. Don’t worry, your shares will be kept warm. Do you really not seeing what’s happening here? Oh well, more for us. 5/5/2021 LA Financiere DE L Echiquier 2,045,000 $47.63M"
943 shares Strong!! Ain’t no way I’m selling this bad boy. The more I look into it the more confident I become. In fact I didn’t sleep last night because I wanted to get the pre-earnings dip. Bought some at 7:30am and got my avg down. This bad boy will build my dividend account in 2 years with all the profits I’m gonna make on my beloved PLTR
So happy for an up day
epic fight between bulls an bears today...bulls may win today..
We when we got rich by PLTR:
"why im bullish even after a day like today? there is a lot of suspecting between the US and China, and companys that can transfer information, and in pltr case is very clear what side the are... war's today shifted to computer and data... so i believe that a lot off money will go to this company that have proven record"
$AMC $UPST $PLTR
to the moon
Uncle Karp is giving retail a chance to pounce on good numbers for a whole trading day. Instead of giving out earnings post market where mostly institutions can take advantage.
"I have been in the markets for many years. I can tell you that all the people/institutions who are afraid to lose more if the earning are not good, have already sold by the closing today. This only leaves upside potential no matter what the conference call will be tomorrow."
Traders - sell. Investors- hold + load up on dips. which one are you?
Most industries like Pharmaceuticals in Europe use SAP...how is Foundry and Gotham etc better in these industries?...just wondering.
Anyone still having some dry powder left?I kept using mine and now I have nothing left...
Closing green...awesome!
ceo still selling? im staying away
Buy non stop ! I will print more ! KARP
What's the point of selling when you already down 99%?
It’s seems like my old Facebook stock ! Pltr is going to be huge in next 5 years
No conviction whatsoever in today's action...too flighty...
For me it does not matter if it closes > $20 or under I careless .. wha Ti know is that more calls have been bought and you know what that means? Sharks will bring this up soon!
"Analyst logic always illogical When momentum is upwards, upgrade to a fancy price ;When momentum is downwards, downgrade to a price they can buy and upgrade;If you trust analysts you are doomed. "
Hey look! Another contract...Let's go down even more!
arkk probably imploding here too....bigger fail than archeos
My Family is monitoring PLTR price closely....
E/R this morning before the bell
"The year is 2025. PLTR has become the most valuable company in existence, it’s AI SKYNET named Chad Thundercock has given all of its parent shareholders financial godlike status over all other humans. PLTR price target $42069.00 a share."
Hahaha  
If futures are true. We could see this below 15 tomorrow
Tomorrow will be our best day in a while
"Ray is obviously an astute investor! I already bought earlier this morning around $21! Much less than Ray......but, everyone has different budgets for investing. Congrats to Ray!"
Anyone else remember when it peaked at $40 and you felt that spark when you looked at your bank account? I miss that feeling. lol
I've noticed every time this board is flooded with negative posts and the shorts try to run PLT are down and always jumps up the next day
I just bought more )
What is the right price for PLTR stock ? Please justify .
"they tried to push down the price early this morning, and they couldn't"
Thanks for the cheap shares
"My guess is that stock-based compensations are going to annihilate the earnings, considering all the stocks creation to pay its own employees, and especially Karp. This is going to take Palantir on another down trend wehereas fundamentally speaking, the business is sound. On Q1 they reported a profit on 2020 if you do not count in the stock based compensation."
I lose my mind when dodge is in green whereas pltr which makes real money is in red most of the time. Are we all going crazy in this world?
Here come all the short dirt bags…
I think this is one of the most dangerous stocks in the world to short! It just has that feel!
OMG why????Every day in RED????Why?????
when it's down - it's down by 6 or 7% for several days in a row and when (rarely) it's up - it's up merely 1% or less. same story most tech stocks for 3 months now
"Palantir USG Inc., Palo Alto, California, has been awarded a $32,500,000 firm-fixed-price contract that provides data-as-a-service platform for two separate mission areas.https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/2591938/"
"If the CIA, JSOC, Mi5, GCHQ run their operations on Palantir - if you run a pipeline company for example then perhaps you ought to as well."
well these frequent huge sell-offs are definitely not retail
This is my lottery stock.
Anyone holding from 39 like me?
CEO needs to reduce salary and apologize to stock holders.
Im tired of this stock. Lets go at 15$ so maybe (maybe ) at least have a chance too see a green day
"Upgrades to come soon. $25 near term. New highs, $45+ EOY"
This is a gift if you are long term
Under 20...it is a buy!
take it for what it's worth but all you people who are nervous about this stock I've got three or four nasdaq stoks that have just as dramatic as PLTR . look at the charts on Tesla look at the charts on many of the other NASDAQ stocks you'll see almost exact similar pattern this has nothing to do with pltrs business it has to do with the sector money managers moving out of sectors. it will go up in time if not Tuesday morning when blowout numbers are publicized. and remember Black Rock Kathy Wood and all these other money managers who have bought into the stock who are still holding it. don't forget why you bought it
3–1 calls to puts for 5/28 . Expect a move next week
pltr just signed the new aggrement with space force. future is great 
sell every chance You can get !!!!!!!!
$1.2 Billion dollar contract to be announced... https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/notice/8d7bebf2-c76d-433a-8f91-4dff8eea1625?origin=SearchResults&p=1
Hope you bought yesterday! Shake Shake Shake
"Once PLTR gets to $500 and declared a huge first stock split, that's when you'll realize how bad you missed the gift here!"
"All I know is that.....I'm buying every day! Modest amounts to be sure! But, I'm convinced this stock will hit $100 plus within 2-3 years. Most likely much, much sooner! I'm in for at least the next five years. Cheers to all!"
Palantir usually moves with $SPCE so this will end green today.
"the lower it gets, the lesser risk it is"
this wil have a huge green candle on opening!
Soros filled the sales of 18.5m shares PLTR. Everyone cuting this overvalued stock. Back to its DPO price
I bought a silver stock in 2011 that I've held on to that is finally in the green. Time and patience is everything.
"On a Green Day, this stock crashes!! Woow PLTR"
PLTR is just like amzn and tsla in the early days. All misunderstood.
"PLTR software will be the default ala ""Trouble Shooter Support"" in all electronic, pc, automotive, marine, aeronautics, finance, business management, websites, etc....sky is the limit."
Great company to invest. Never would have thought it would drop back below $20. Bought more for retirement. All smiles down the road. Being patient is key to successful investing. Drown out the clown noise.
Nasdaq down 314 points
What she say???
The ark dumping will drive all these down stocks down big time. This will be one of the survivors but the other 80% are done.
Shorts have left the chat 
There will be a massive bounce.
KARP said to his friends take price up ...he wants to sell more bags soon BUY NON STOP
To the moon :) long term
My $$$ all tied up in PLTR...
I guess we can all agree now that this stock is a piece of sheet.
It’s probably just a long squeeze now. It’ll bounce back plenty mid term after earnings
10 dollar today
Who remembers what happened yesterday? A huge decline and then an increase. After each storm comes the sun;)
Hope the earning call provides growth & demand what the market wants to hear. It's been close to a 40% hair cut based on last earnings call. This earnings call will drive the stock to 14.5 or 27+... before the next one based on growth forecast...
"According to CNBC, last week's article:In August, a month before Palantir went public, CEO Alex Karp was granted 141 million options that vest quarterly.Those awards resulted in a total pay package for 2020 of $1.1 billion, even though Karp’s salary was just $1.1 million, according to a proxy filing on Thursday.Karp owned about $1 billion worth of Palantir stock at the time of the company’s market debut. The share price has more than doubled since, and he’s cashed out about $350 million."
Here comes $15 possibly 13 and change by EOW
"Palantir Revenue growth forecast 33%, compare to industry (Docusign 35% but trades at 5x book value) PLTR and ZM trade at the same book value. You have to value stocks compared to their peers. Palantir has an EBIT Growth forecast of 127.7% (higher than ZM, Unity, Synopys) Palantir has an EBIT Margin forecast of 22.4% competing with Zoom. Let’s gooooooooo"
"You keep crying, I keep buying"
"In January I decided to invest 1k in PLTR. However, had i been smart and Investing 1000$ in DOGE on January 1 of 2021 would be worth $115,576 today"
Remember when stocks used to go up more than one day in a row? Those were fun times
So far its unfortunate to own PLTR .I have 600 share and stock with it
"If the former President were still in office PLTR would be 68.69 now, there would be no gas lines, no hyper inflation, and the Middle East would be quiet."
"Lots of 13Fs filed today. Institutions are lining up to add this gem. Here’s one of note. 5/14/2021 Rovida Advisors Inc. 4,575,282 $106.56M"
I am down like 35% with 950 shares but I ain’t leavin!!!!
I'm still holding at $30 after 3 months. Excuse me?!
Bought another 500 at $19.10. GL
Woof woof woof Palantir 
"To the investors on the board, Palantir stock is up 150% since Oct."
 YES! CNBC. $25 most likely near term! BUY BUY BUY
wow..up 1%!!! that makes up for 1/5 of one of the last 20 days!!! Just think.. half a year at this rate we will be back to $30!!!
Something big is coming. Gonna be a nice pop.
Good Day!!!
"I would like to see Palantir make a bid for Fireye. It is a leader in Cyber Security , and cheap enough for Palantir to buy it . I know I will get thumbs down for this , but I think it will be Great fit for Palantir."
The triangle formed by that middle wave of the correction suggests to Todd Gordon interviewed by cnbc this morning that the stock could break out to the upside.
-10% in pre-market but opens just -2%. Sounds like manipulation to me. Look how we'll close green.
Someone made a great call of 19.90 for the close (it wasn't me. I predicted 20.90)
3 months red .... when will the train start?
I bought this at 16.63 8:30 a.m. this morning. Timing is everything. The trend has turned positive. ￼￼￼
"2 ERs down for me, and at least 12 more to go. This is getting real good. Forget the walk in the park 30% annual growth rate, the 50 new sales reps on the street are going to blow that number up. I’m quite sure there is an internal stretch number that’s significantly higher."
Red in a beautiful Green Day
CNBC reporting on big Palantir buying by ARkK yesterday at close. GL
We will sell more tomorrow ...Buy non stop ...We print you a lot if you need more ...
Are we rich yet?
"BTC dropping should mean less inflation. Less inflation should help growth stocks/PLTR.Long story short, buy now.Just my thoughts. 4338 strong! Avg 20."
So much pain.Everyday red.weekly dips. Bottom is $5 I am calling it now. Karp and other insiders will continue to dump shares.
up at least 10% tomorrow!! Load up at open guys
"My fellow PLTR DREAMERS,1. I have a dream today!2. I have a dream that one day down in Palantir headquarters in Denver Colorado... Mr. Karp will stop selling PLTR stock and flooding the markets with too many PLTR stocks3. I have a dream that one day this stock board participants will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all of us are bag holders and Mr. Karp doesn't care.”4. Let freedom ring from a stock price of $22.30 today to a stock price of $30 by Earning Report day of May-11-20215. I have a dream... that one morning I check my PLTR stock and see Green again... and see a beautiful number above $25...6. “Free at last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at last.”Peace!"
"Small comeback from the lows, tomorrow will be interesting."
too much insider selling. imagine being paid in stock options and holding for 20 years.
So what that the CEO made 1 billion last year.That’s in the rear view mirror now.Shorts and options have control of this because there really is no clear guidelines.Earnings will take this sky high along with a stock buyback program they will announce on the 11th.Not sure if I want to buy more at this point in time.I know it’s going up before or after the 11th.Will be watching it.It might be a buy on the rumor and sell on the news kind of thing.This world is really messed up right now.All reply’s welcome.For everyone’s information I bought back in at 24.14.
4 new government contracts. They keep piling up.
"The only sensible thing to do right now on this stock is buy puts. Once Cathie Wood, institutions and the youtube pumpers abandon ship everyone else will be left holding the bag.Most overhyped stock of our times along with Tesla. This is the year when a generation of investors will once again learn how to be sceptical the hard way. Stop believing company projections and those with a vested interest in pumping stocks up. Good luck everyone."
never had a 60% loss on a stock before.. wow..
That was a bear trap. All that shorted the open already underwater.
"Karp said to leave, if you are looking for a quick profit and Karp left with quick profit - investors money. Lol."
Who would pay to Palantir with bitcoin? CIA? Oil company? US Military? Pablo Escobar? Snoopy Dog?
it is getting impossible to post on these boards yahoo has so many flags out on words and sites. was much better in the old days. they could never resist screwing up the format.
What price could we see with a strong earnings report?
"Ok guys... the 4 CNBC fast money love this stock and was blown away and impressed with the Earning reportKaren: She has been long in the 20’s.Pete: love itGuy: also love itTim: i love his analysis, he loves it, and said this was confused with the Reddit crowd like GME but the truth is it has all the fundamentals of a good company unlike GME. Looks like fund’s managers have been in denial for a long time as they thought this was just a meme stock now they are finally waking up and giving green light!"
"Maplelane Capital LLC Purchases 14,500,000 shares of Palantir April 20 2021!!"
I don't care about this volatility up and down... Cause it's gonna be like this for a long time to come probably.What I care about is the future. And this might very well be the future. It's a strong bet at least.
Thats what we call a bulls trap.
Selling is not an option here for the next years! The only option is buying the dips....
"Where did PLTR get their $2bln cash from, if they have no profit?"
"Welp, atleast we’re sideways today. Other stocks still getting hammered."
"1,000 shares at 24 i am sad"
"Mama used to say : not sold, no lossPLTR in not a on stage company with only dreams, this company has a lot of cash and no debt and is one of the most specialized company in the world.Huge news are coming within months, it could become a monopolistic, US gvnt needs PLTR like Raytheon, Lockheed, ....."
$21.50 needs to be broken ...getting rejected every time by CEO Karp is AI selling every time we attempt to break through...wow
21.10 resistance
"At this point, investors value Palantir's growth more than its profitability.As a result, Palantir's shares may be fairly valued between $28 and $33."
"I am waiting for Capitulation, MY Gut feeling told me this was going to hit the teens a few weeks ago; the question is would this comeback to 22 or drop to 15 before it jumps. Market is way overpriced, although this stock already corrected 50+% from peak."
This is lower than the day before earnings. The trap has closed. Now it will go for $ 15.Next week.
This just in - Palantir is going Vegan
not again
15$ opening?? unbelievable
Is this pump just from Citigroup about $111700 somewhere in future? Lol
This market is totally irrational
"Druckenmilller bought $140M, unco firmed yet but he is a market visionary, giving more credibility,..."
Cathie come and get my long polish sausage
"Hey CovertAction, I had no idea that dead cats bounced so high....pretty high from $16.50...course, would have been even higher if it had ever hit your never-achieved price of $15....oh, or is that still just round the corner?"
"Most stocks are traded 20 x their revenue. Let's say if PLTR maintains their growing rate, their revenue will be 5 billion in 2026. What is 5 billion X 20? Listen to what Alex said in his previous interview. He did not lie. Don't listen to all the noises. This is for long term."
This stock price makes no sense at all.This stock should be at 50$ easily
buying the dip for the 28th time.
Nice to see it is resisting all the downward pressure.
WHO IS READY
i don't care... (Alex Karp)
"weak sales team. Karp and sales needs to start hitting the pavement, phone, zoom calls and canvas the private sector as the govt is low margin and low hanging fruit that requires little effort. All companies value data.."
Yesterday was the first time in a month we had 2 Green Day’s back to back - are we going for a 3rd? 
"Well, I'm about to just leave this in a dark spot of the portfolio and just forget about it."
7% down in 30mins wow
I almost give up on trading coz i was making a lot of looses but when i come in contact with Mr. Andrew Kreiger . Things worked out like magic i started making a lot of profits. Thanks Mr. Andrew telegram @AndrewKreiger212
Those numbers are pretty good to be honest. Buying here.
49%. If you can’t see what this means—- Buy utilities
when will this end
Looks like Cathie and ARK made the right decision to buy more just before earnings.
another million shares bought by none other than queen cathy today...
"Any thoughts on the indirect impact from the MSFT and AMZN battle over project JEDI? PLTR won $100 million contract over all of them. If they revisit the books on JEDI, I hope it doesn’t impact the other contracts"
Few hundred thousand more shares dumped by insiders today will soon drag this back to red by end of the day.non stop greed

"hold your breath, this whole market is going under water for a while"
DEPRSSION FOR PLTR mODAY AND ALL WEEK!!!!!
$22 in the making...rightnow.
"From a 70 Billion market cap to 30 Billion in 90 days. Huge overcorrection. People are spooked. But not worried This stock will go up aaaaall summer. Companies will need this software more than ever as the economy comes back for sure. Same with governments. I admit, the pullback went way further than I anticipated, but it's temporary. You just have to be patient, as hard as that is."
LOL
when are earnings announced?
"Volume speaks volumes, people are holding."
The key phrase to understand is a loss due to stock based compensation for their execs. Palantir cares little for their shareholders. It was all set up to line the pockets of the employees with 
"Just buy some now and forget about it, your money will double or triple by year end. Mark this post!!! "
"Did I ever tell you BEARS, BASHERS & SHORTS this joke. “There’s these three Hedge Funds that shorted a company called GameStop, they shorted it so much that they shorted more shares than the company had. A bunch of retail investors saw this and got together to raise the stock price and squeezed over 70 billion dollars out of the Hedge Funds.” Now that’s funny and the funniest thing is it’s true."
2nd leg could take us >20 into closing
Opportunity to buy some generational wealth here guys
"Sorry folks, but look at the 1y chart. This is now going to slide to $15 thru the next 10 days."
This will gap up tmw.
"Tremendous run since Oct. Next week another qtr and will indicate success in both gov't and commerical. Similar to other great platform stocks, 500% growth in clients in one qtr will not happen, but over 50% per year is possible. $4B way before 2025 target."
where is that KYLE guy?
Daily chart - W pattern . Macd about to cross and stochastics already did
"This isn't just palantir. This is alot of retail favorite stocks. Doesn't matter how good the news is and how good the earnings are. Big money is waging war on retail investors. FB, AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, and any other big money tech stock are hardly affected. If retail likes it then it will be targeted. Payment for order flow is coming back to bite retail investors."
"Good morning my fellow PLTR homies,1. The next 36 hours are very stressful to my fellow PLTR LONGS (bagholders?)2. Currently, PLTR stock price = about $203. Assuming PLTR Earnings Report is GREAT, here are a few possibilities:...a. PLTR stock = $21 means 5% gain...b. PLTR stock = $22 means 10% gain...c. PLTR stock = $23 means 15% gain...d. PLTR stock = $24 means 20% gain...e. PLTR stock = $25 means 25% gain...f. PLTR stock = $26 means 30% gain4. So, based on the above mathematical realities, any chances PLTR will go up 20 to 30% in the next 48 hours?5. Many of us bought in the last 2 months and we were told then ""To The Moon""6. I also understand that many PLTR retail investors have bought in the 30 to $40 range. I feel your pain.7. Sometimes I fantasize about WallStreetBets GURUS trapping PLTR Shorts and force the PLTR stock price to $100... However, that means Palantir valuation will become $200 BILLION and that's a little bit unrealistic to justify. But, I keep hoping that can happen...8. Pray for us.... we are hurting 9. Fair enough?Peace!"

Can someone share the link where institutional holding is updated everyday based of 13F filings
SNOW is down more than us today.Shows you that the decrease has nothing to do with PLTR.It's the whole sector.
Locked and loaded for $20.75. Thank you again. Heading out. Will check back later.
PLTR would go up to $21.65 tomorrow after the earning release. Goodluck everyone!!
Easy -25% tomorrow if beat is moderate....lol
And Karp keeps selling his shares!
Resistance is $21.26. Need to break this to form a support base.
I have to say CEO is very smart. He knows when to sell stocks.
Shorts are shorting out to get money back!!! Buy PLTR....!!!!
"Revenue is increasing YOY, and their Margins are getting better YOY hmmm, the software and business model PLTR has is my reason for going long on this. An increase to the commercial markets and adjusting their services/products to the demographics will surely set them straight. :)Not Financial Advice"
bla bla bla shorties all over the board...be patience and you'll rewarded 
"Finally had some chance to read transcript from earnings. Shyam deserves every penny of stock based compensation. Did you not read on chained edge AI?  ""We only have one tenth of a percent of total defense spending""?"
"3% down PM, nice! wait 10 usd/ STRONG SHORT"
Earnings will send this stock back to $28
"PLTR is a legit technology company. Trust the government and the company's revenue growth year after year. Don't listen to the noises from the bearish or emotional traders. Bears trade base on resistance and support from trend lines, patterns and gaps etc. They don't have a real job. They sit in front of the monitors and draw all kind of R lines. They have to cut loss once the candle breaks the resistance lines.Long term investors need to learn/calculate on the company's foundation, not the noises or short term price fluctuations. Focus more on your real- active job for active income and let your money and the company you invest in earn your passive income."
I am losing alot of money 
"of course, it's red. There was a big battle yesterday and blood have been shed during the night"
Dominic has unlimited funds to by every single day.Must be nice.
The entire market is on it’s head right now. Nothing makes sense. Follow the company and not the stock price and you will have a great great career as an investor.

"Wonder if any , just any people on this crazy board here are real pro software engineers that actually got to use and evaluate the palantir software foundry or gotham suite...if anyone can speak to it in terms of its advanced tech compare to any other data mining/analysis softwares out there so we longs all know that we put our money in the right direction with bright future..shorts go away...thanks in advance..."
Thanks whoever sold me their shares at open. Much obliged. I’ll check in later. Have fun today.
New pt is 24 in 4 years. Hehehehhe.
I'm long but I sure am getting tired of all these buying opportunities :/
Huge volume and a nice positive move when many stocks were down for most of the day. Let's see when it will go back to its ATH. God Bless and stay well.
As Cathie Wood stated. This is a long long long term hold. You can put money to use elsewhere for about a year.
Thank God for giving me such a cheap price to load up 
Shorts grilled:
"If you short today or over next few days, you will really regret your decision. Perfect example how small investors lose by fear and large ones make money always in long run."

Market Stop loss recommendation is 17.07 today.
probably Karp and friends taking more profirs
1-800-DIVORCE just in case!
I'll buy at $10 :D
ARMAGEDON
I will literally accept .11 gain on a triple digit upday in the market....
"Palantir will have contracts with every fortune 300 company, this SP is a total bargain."
Shorts are coping so hard right now
"PLTR, red as always"
I'm just happy it's around 20 (my avg). Can't wait for the FUD to clear and this to rise to levels where it won't matter if it gets cut in half again. I just want to remain above my buy-in and to let PLTR do its thing for the next 10-15.
Man never thought I could add again at this price
I just read an article by Seeking Alpha and the author is saying Palantir Technologies will be another FAANG stock in the near future. I just loaded up.
+3.36% Frankfurt
"Cramer was right for once LOL, hope he ends up being wrong though."
"this is going back down to 10 a share and it would still even be overpriced. No room for growth, p/e ratio makes 0 sense with this company, and no new innovation coming out of this company. On top of that you guys are supporting a big brother type of corp. Really makes my brain tremble."
"Hold.The downswing is across the entire market.4000 shares holding strong. - AC 26.5Yes, that's almost 32k unrealized loss. But, it's unrealized. Palantir will bounce like everything else. Patience.Whatever you do, never sell at a loss. Right from Mr. Buffet"
Loosing half of its gains from yesterday
This stock will be $5 in a couple days
Soon 30!
CEO is not worth 1.7 b which cause company debt!
"Last summer banks said Tesla will go to $20, when it was in $200."
Cathie just doubled down
PLTR has a swing on Tuesday from 12% to 9% up in about 75 minutes.REPEAT PLEASE.........Great company superior product great stock long or Options.
Going up 10 points in a day. Will you still be playing ball or did you fall victim to the devils in disguise?You all should know it is the DAILY short volume that prevents the powerful move up. Will you be worn out by the best traders in the world trying their best to suppress a stock? Meanwhile making dough on high priced put selling? Short sale volume does not- and is not intended to- equate to bimonthly short interest position information. Short interest data reflects short positions held on two DISCRETE days each month.
Ffs.. this almost gave me a heart attack. Almost went to 16s
"They have turned PLTR into a perma-dog until further notice. All other techs up, so that's nice. CEO has managed this one into the doghouse though."
Like if you’re holding back to 30 
Expect a clear and short path to profitability.
"Cathie PUMPS and Hedge Funds dump and pays Wood ""under the table money!"""
It will test 25 Mark today
Any interesting books?
up 1 cent in after hours !!
I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time! Palantir under $20 is my entry point. I’ve bought for the long term and so should all of you! This is a massive buying opportunity! “Be greedy when everyone else is fearful” #longterminvestor
"So funny to me how quickly people are to mock Cathie Wood and her stock picks when literally 6 months ago she was a God. The very people that do this (Cramer) should also understand that EVERYTHING is cyclical!!! Growth and Tech (inclusive of PLTR) will return to favor, it is literally just a matter of time. It very well may hurt and it may take time, but if you have the same investing strategy as she laid out ""5 year plan""...you are sitting on a stock that is going to take very good care of you. Do yourself a favor and READ the transcript of the earnings call-it will sink in better on exactly what this company has accomplished and where it is going. This is no fly by night speculative company. The numbers are real, as is the earnings/revenue, and year over year growth. Profitability is not far away as they are paying down debt in mass sums as they go. Do what you will, mock all you want. I will be long PLTR"
Maybe they should hire a barber instead
"NOT ONE single analyst will downgrade based on earnings. Several will upgrade, however."
"Cathie Deadwood bought over 2 millions share of $17 that is bargain price, congrats"
"The wheel has turned and we will not look back. Once the big boys are done buying Palantir, the SP will rise in a big way.Don’t miss this buying opportunity now,."
"People looking straight at the biggest technical disruption since alternating current be like ""I don't like his hair"". I like his hair, and I like companies that help create AI powered exoskeleton companies in a few days as a side project."
This is such a good company. I’m holding for the rest of my life.. 50 by summer
"Well at least I got my double back, now the triple, that will take some doing."
"I like to believe PLTR is getting hit indirectly from the organized onslaught of ARKK. No one in their right mind would directly bet against the most promising company in the world, PLTR :)"
Still on the downtrend.

omg CRASHED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! down 7% without a reason???????
I'll take any green day the way this stock has been performing past couple of months

Not buying nor selling... waiting
I doubled my shares today. This company is a great investment!
i am just glad tgis is not down...if i can make some money ill cash out and repaybmy credit cards
I hate this days when the index goes down and your stocks goes down the double and the next day the index goes up +1% and your stocks goes up +0.5%...
Yesterday’s Bull Trap created new Bag holders. Let’s say hello to them. You would be joining those who bought in mid 20s thinking it will go back over 30 which it never did.

Cathie woods bought 1.3 million shares today
Wow where is bears??? They were talking last few days. Please talk
Just my thoughts GOOGLE backed by the Government when they started or before they took did what they did . Not saying its the same thing but for few 100 shares why not . Just saying
Atleast one Good thing is PLTR will have strong support at $0 
Buy ratings coming
This is it.. our day to reclaim 21 support.. build some MoMo into ER next Tuesday
Bitcoin in play Awesome dude
OK Now I have fastened my seat belt . Ready for take off
"Biggest SCAM,,, BULL TRAP in the History of the Stock Market,Long squeeze."
Don’t get me wrong I think the potential benefit of Palantir is enormous but as a shareholder we have little chance of benefit given the dilution of shares going on with the lucrative stock options being given.
THose shares are really diluting our values....1.9BILLIONS of shares???Come on man!
Added more.

Not worried about today when the whole market is green. Hoping it will be back to $18 by next week
Earnings met and revenue beat gimme gimme gimme
"Shorts are starting to cover, let’s see if there’s people selling the shares they need "
"I think today this is a great short term buying opportunity to recover previous losses, especially it is a few days before earning date which I think Q1 will look great in terms of revenue."
"FOR THOSE TELLING US TO BUY NOW, THE PROBLEM IS WE DON'T HAVE ANY CASH LEFT.."
Why is it still making a loss after being in the business for 20years? i dont get the high valuation of this stock at all.
Tommorrow will be 200m shares wild....
Buying more Monday. I’ve run a large organization within an sp500 top performing tech company for years. Data management and analysis is pivotal to success. PLTR provides what every other business in the world desperately needs to improve on going forward. Easy money for a mid/long outlook and this is a cheap buy point.
I’m ready to add some on this price point! Came down fairly good!
Heading to the 22 today 
I only own 2 pity shares of this... and I’m already down 20 cents.

My wife told me that I bought Pltr yesterday more passionately than she buys clothes .....
"Just bought more at 19.61, lets go to 24$!"
"Guess what hedgefunds, I will play with y'all till the last penny. I will not sell even 1 share no matter if y'all push it all the way to 1 penny."
"This looks like a 10X stock to me, in 2-3 years."
How many investors would like to see Cramer fired from CNBC ?
Buying more at 19.99
No end in sight
Techs ar in deep trouble i invested around 8000£ on techs but my portfolio is down to almost 45% maybe years to come until it recovers
No more new contracts!
Shorts!
Gonna be an ugly opening...
If you bought the stock at $35 you have to love it here. Buy more and look at it in 5 years. You’re welcome.
Yahoo deletes my free speech. They are against the United States Constitution. These hedge funds in Palantir are in total control of this stock. They are the big fish in the sea the Whales. And Cathy Wood is the little Fish. ￼￼￼. One person has no chance competing with multiple Hedgefunds. Get it? ￼￼
"As usual, it is red. The stock market is DONE. $$$ is now purring in crypto and energy. Someone please proof me wrong"
I wanted to buy at 18.25. All my money is not settled yet on my Friday transactions. I sold this at 37. It's a steal into the 18s
"7 minutes into the CNBC interview on U tube, Karp hit it the point, companies , gives spend billions to procure software over years. PALANTIR. Software is deployed immediately and solves problems ASAP and it’s not a build as you go deal wasting millions and troubleshooting to oblivion . Make sense ?"
Resistance broken @ 19.21
I will wait until conference call to see what management going to disclose more.
Holding pretty well given the bloody red stock climate.
Not selling any share of PLTR. Just hold tight. Think of long term. We have to be patient as human and also investors. I did my own research and I trust this company and not going to sell.
Back under 20 today. The March to 15 resumes!
"Are we still at a launchpad???Did someone bring the rocket fuel???Johnny??? Johnny??? Oh ok, you left them at home.....ok. Maybe next year"
No more $19 I want our substantial gain's to start in the $20's.
robots are in buy mode.
Patience with this stock .. $500 in Five years or Less!! looks like Facebook when they first went public...
If a stock is red on a green day then you know what’s gonna happen on red day.
Guys...I have a felling that today we will see +4%
AHAAH YOU KNOW WHAT WE SAY TO THE SHORTS OF STREET?NOT TODAY!
* Over $1.18 billings loss last year.* 18 years in business and still incurring loss.* Insiders are still selling.* CEO was compensated $1.1 billions last year.
stop this please
Soo tired of this
"The Thing I’m happy most about after this ER report is we don’t have to hear about shorts BSING about non sense anymore. They will always dig for negative reasons but in reality, PLTR has prove to be one of the best growth stock out there."
Time to start accumulating again
Covertaction! Where are you brooo! You said that pltr was meant to be 7 dollars a share
they knew I wasn't going to sell this. I am a holder even if it goes to $2. PLTR GANG CUH
"I just picked up 4 shrs. Not for the long term, I just need some paper to line the bottom of my bird cage. On the real though what's the bottom price to buy in on???"
stock is only green when market is red.... wonder why? the answer is pretty simple.*Manipulation*
This is going to the moon ! 30 plus by Friday
TOMORROWS OPEN: $329
"The loss of 150 mlns was from a stock compensation the said, by Karp. Next Q2 will be even better."
Nothing wrong with CEO and nothing wrong with the company. Youtubers and Cathy pump this stock and now its correcting. Really good company to hold for long term. This could be a great buy under 15.
Took my first sizeable position $20 calls Jan 2022. Riding 100 contracts. Let’s go 
Shorts will be toast; goodbye Christmas hello soup line
"Everyone will be using Palantir, I don't care if it goes to 10 or goes to 50..I'm looking at big picture..10 years from now, you'll be asking what a opportunity miss, this company will be special..I was right about Tesla, in my heart I know Palanir will succeed, yes Karp is strange, but u need strange individuals 2 make company great."
"I accumulated a lot of shares this week. Always about accumulation on the dip or crash. This is a minimum 10X, but I think 20X in next 5 years."
finish GREEN....+.10 cents... lol
what a ride
I have not been long in this business but have learned to not panicing. This great company will be around for a while so just have nerves and hold or just buy more.I bought my NVAX in March 2020 it's been an roller coaster but worth waiting.If you buy a new car for $50.000 and drive it around the block you loose directly $5.000I must be positive even if it's hard sometimes.
"I'm wondering why there is so little discussion of Karp's released video today. Giving Foundry to users for free to help industry get back up and moving after the pandemic. Are they using this moment to solidify their monopoly in this market, and then come the fees later. Any thoughts?"
Let's reach 20 a stay there
$ 25 spike ?
OMG we are looking at $15????OMG Jesus
"Let’s recap what happened last week to see what is the future hold. On Wednesday, ER better than expected and the stock went up 9%. The hedge funds panic, and wrote a hit piece on Thursday to crash the stock price so they can have a safe exit. On Friday, the nasdaq went up and the hedge fund now turn the ship around and buy back in at cheap price and stock went up 10%. So, next week and the near future I expect to see palantir goes up from here. Also, more cyber attack happening, the White House is putting more money into companies like palantir"
"Super results, count me for more shares!"
"CEO wants to retire, which is why he was not on the earnings call. He wants the money, the billions. So PALANTIR WILL BE SOLD. One of the tech giants will buy it here at these low prices."
Palantir is the future. Microsoft has a challenger!!!
"Longs, its only going to get worse. Don’t forget, the company will issue another 100-125 million shares as compensation which will promptly get dumped after earnings further reducing share price. This is going to $15 fast. That said, this is an extremely profitable short stock, the best out there!"
4% drop on no news is a lot
"My fellow PLTR homies,1. The PLTR stock has a lot of emotional issues2. We need some professional help to keep PLTR above $203. I stopped saying ""To The Moon"" when it became clear that the stock has been DILUTED...4. Just like many other stocks, I have a feeling that even if the May-11-2021 Earnings Report is GOOD, the PLTR stock price will go down...5. In other words, maybe we need BIG SURPRISE NEWS like Amazon or Google BUYS Palantir..?6. Based on the last few weeks, PLTR seems to go down even with GOOD NEWS...Peace!"
tomorrow this will be $17 buy buy buy now!!!!!!!
Ark picked up more ! Cathie !!!!
May 11 judgement day
Again 0 profit in18 yrs and ceo has made himself a billionaire at the same time. Enuf said
"PLTR will definitely be a winner. It will be the IBM of yesteryear as it involves itself in areas of crypto to healthcare and AI. With time, this will be a GIANT winner."
Why didn’t I just buy Ethereum? Holy cow. ￼
"So shorts are you buying back? It's okay to be honest, you won a lot these past few months."
future GIANT of software and AI. patiently holding my 100 shares for 20 years
Leaving any share isn’t sign of weakness.its in fact strength of standing uptogreedy carpe and cronies .staying in whilst the management laugh their way to the bank is weakness
Why?
"This where you want to buy. Didnt these big banks claim a target of $18 earlier this year? Ofcourse they did, institutional buyers took hold of and drove right where they want it to load up some more"
19 bucks.....
I muted so many turds today that my phone screen cracked at the spot where the mute button is. I still prefer reading clean infos on a cracked screen than cracked infos on a clean screen. GLTA!
I bought few at 20. But its absolutely overvalued. I will load boat below 15. Its growth rate is 30% but price to sales ratio is 35. Do your DD.
Shorts right now!
So ARK bought another ~1.3 million shares.
Celularity looks to advance cellular therapies with Palantir.
"God help- I am holding from average of 10 usd, red over to low 20s was ok. But today and still now it’s nerve cracking when under 20s.How you guys managed to keep your cool? Care to share please"
"Listen, stocks that trade on price vs. future earnings are going to get obliterated - yes worse than they already have. It doesn't matter where this opened at IPO, or how it's performed. This is a different equation for valuation than we've seen since the summer of 2000. Beware of buying the dip."
pitiful...we dont know how long this bear market is going to go until you know stock is up..but its already been a while now so this aint a run of mill bear hopefully it wont go on too long bc the longer it goes the worse it gets
"Man, for all you naysayers out there (CovertAction), this dead cat bounce keeps on bouncing higher it seems...Where you at anyway? You hiding trying to find a way to make $$ to cover?"
$30+ coming soon whether the manipulative shorts on this board like it or not. do not be shaken out this is a great company
"Growth stocks are at a steal right now. Value stocks are a hedge against inflation and ppl are playing the re-opening trade. Now is too late to get into value stocks. Once people realize the sky isn’t falling and that we aren’t having hyperinflation, they will pour back into growth stocks and PLTR (and others) will take off. Buy based on fundamentals and hooooold. It’s that simple. 4338 strong."
I'm definitely long holding shares. The only way I'll lose all of my money is if the company goes bankrupt in the stock drops to 0
do tou watching this price movement?? 
"Just bought another 480 shares for my retirement!! These prices were just too tempting. Hate to do it in my IRA, but I'm all out of powder in my Roth."
Oof imagine speculating that Palantir would drop on on earnings . Couldn’t be me
Gotta watch this video claiming PLTR will be 20-25x it is today....$1Trillion...Yes!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-U6falW-wM
No chance this breaks 20
No chance we see two green days in a row. Zero.
In this Market an earnings miss would be catastrophic.
"Yes I agree that this stock is beaten down so badly.. and it shouldn’t be here. It hurts but look around Plug, went from like $70 to $24. Snow from god knows where now is nothing.. look at Fastly.. everything tanks but PlTR will survive as they will continue their growth. No companies make you a millionaire immediately.. be patient.. and hold on to your shares. Sell call until next year if needed to!"
Cathy Wood is destroyed on this one 
"Remember insiders fair DPO price was 7.25$. With upcoming 600 million new shares when options are exercised and dilution, new share price is $2 after dilution."
Just hope Ark Investments does not go belly up making bad investments across the board with a lot of the new tech companies. The better the uptrend of Ark investments the better the stock action for PLTR...
When there is blood on the streets buy.
Are earnings before or after bell tomorrow?
Feeling of holding 7000 shares short is sweet! You can not go wrong by following CEO'S dumping.
Upgrade today-tomorrow and $21+.
As Cathy wood stated. This is a long term hold. They will continue to show fantastic revenue growth and the earnings will grow as well. There will not be much movement in between quarterly results unless they land major contracts that they are allowed to announce early. Be patient with this one. You never know when it might jump 15/20% in one day and it will.
"Cathie is loading, and so did we. Good luck to all!"
Cathie bought more.....
Palantir now in charge @ the USPS
"2023 isn't that far off, I rarely look at my accounts these days & plan on keeping it that way. Wealth will b made over the next few years . My goal for PLTR is 50 but ill probably hold to 70. Market depending but it won't stay in this horrid state forever!Good Luck everyone!"
Federal Reserve meeting today is POSITIVEExpect PLTR and stocks to go UP!!!
I could watch this chart all day.
"crazy to me how a company that has become a necessity to our government, basically securing the future success of the company, could be beaten down and battered by shills and shorts so hard"
I really hope they add Bitcoin to their balance sheet.
"I can still buy food this week, so I'm OK. haha"
Wait for $15 then jump in.
shorts running outa steam back up we go.
"120 day short interest dropped from 10% to 4%, if your short go look at the call volume for 05/30"
"I wouldn't think about buying this stock until 1. it reaches single digits, or 2. it establishes a base, consolidates, and starts a proven uptrend. As it is right now, this stock is like a bagholder onion. Any bit it goes up in value, you will have a new layer of bagholders that are desperate to get out or break even. There will be constant selling pressure every time this stock tries to go up."
"$2B In cash versus $197M in debt, Contribution Margin 21% to 54% from 2019 - 2020, Adjusted gross margin estimate near 85% 2021, $2.8B in total deal value up 104% year over year, gimme gimme gimme at this price"
There goes my dream of becoming a millionaire in 2 years...
should have bought pre-market below $17
Like Warren my good friend always says investor buy and don't sell. This company is the future.
"This is a great company I just believe I can get a higher return else where , but I am going to have a position just a small portion of my Portfolio I still have my shares from IPO tho:)."
Needs to close above $20.62 for the momentum to continue.
please jump up to $50
party weekend ahead! I warned everyone of you since a couple of weeks we would break down below 20... my best guess is an end around 16-17... good weekend y'all

good luck shorts
"earnings will be good, that won't be a problem.the question will be what they are going to say about further share dilution .I think if they keep rewarding employees with shares, that will be a catastrophy for the stock price."
"But if Palantir and its products are so great, why isn’t anyone on the inside buying PLTR?"
"Nice price for new buyers, nightmare for existing investors, depends on how you plan and look at it."
You are oblivious of what is happening in the world markets. This stock is holding up just fine. If you are a day trader not so much. If you bought as an investment you will easily double or triple your money once economic conditions improve. The while market is taking it on the chin with inflation issues. It has been a concern for months and yesterdays numbers confirmed it.
sold 2k shares at loss. good night.
"I cannot believe it turned Green.. Pre-market was 16.60 when I checked. It was about time for this to rebound, being down the last 2 weeks. Perhaps pre-market was capitulation for the stock and now is the real time to buy or add."
CEo is here?
"This is a good earnings not sure why any of you are saying it is not. Read the numbers, of course cost is up but revenue and FCF is up much more. Soon it is going to be decently profitable without question."
At least we are back above 20

"this didn't even rise due to earnings (too early, still irrelevant), this went up due to the vast oil pipeline hack that is causing havoc on the east coast..and guess who you're gonna need to protect data????Just buy and thank me later...don't be so short term..."
I am selling all my shares.What awful news!
"My fellow PLTR homies,1. ""To Be. Or. Not To Be"": That's the question2. I think, based on analysts, that PLTR will report AWESOME Earnings that BEAT...3. However, many commentators seem to believe that the PLTR stock will still fall even with AWESOME Earnings Report4. So, I guess that hoping for a price of $22 (which means 10% GAIN) is TOO MUCH to ask for, even with an OUTSTANDING EARNINGS REPORT)5. If PLTR keeps falling... when are we going back to $20? Next quarter? End of year?6. I am frustrated... depressed... crying ""a little bit""...Peace!"
$PLTR is racking up contract after million dollar contract... i just love how Cathy and other institutions are continuously building positions on a grand scale. Our time is soon coming.
Earnings are May 11 before market open.

This sell off in tech is big F joke. Give it a few weeks and suddenly “everyone” is back in tech and the reason being it’s suddenly very attractive. Have patience and not only this but all tech will fly again. “Never bet against tech”

hopefully tomorrow will be a good day. At least let me breath. so many bloodbath stocks right now
We will never see below 20 again

At this point... we are so desperate... our only hope is for the WallStreetBets soldiers to counter attack...WallStreetBets boys and girls: ATTACK!!!I am just talking out loud to myself...

My regret is not having enough money to match more at these low prices
Well....looks like a buy day....again.

Early tee time so I have to run. Good luck today and have fun. I have a buy limit order for $19.20 if there’s panic again.
"Haha the paid bears are out on the board already. Planned short attack on the stock today no doubt. I say bring it on, in this current climate, I know what side I’d rather be on a heavily shorted stock"
Just got back another limit order filled at $19.60. Ouch. I hope who ever sold me their shares didn’t take too big a loss. Great time to buy if you don’t need the money for a while. I’ll be a bag holder at $17.43. Can we get there?

Fight the good fight with PLTR. Cyber security is the most important for any government or an organization. PLTR will be the gatekeepers of cyber security.

PLTR is like that dude who is really good at limbo and just gets lower and lower and you can even believe that it’s possible to get that low
30 by the end of the year?
"We are on the final stage of a massive run up by PLTR. Shorts are getting their last dollars, before they cover and stop shorting more. The only people selling PLTR now, and making stock price go down, are people who are shorting, who actually own 0 shares. I mean, no long is going to sell shares within 10 days of the first earnings that will reflect so many new contracts, including the AWS and IBM deals. I’m very calm and optimistic, holding my shares for the next 10 years and buying whenever I can decrease my average cost."
Was 23.01 USD a gd entry point?
Looks like it is setting up for a good 10% gain today
What is causing the drop? Seems like good news or bad news don't really matter anymore.

"Palantir, the greatest stock to short on the market today."
oh my god....
"Last night, I read an article in an oil trade publication that 18 percent of EV owners in Los Angeles have switched back to gasoline vehicles."
US commercial revenue grew 72% year-over-year
19.80 today and hopefully that support holds
"So PLTR partnered with a biotech company. The company works on curing cancer, infectious diseases and degenerate deceases. Turns out that this company Celularity has plenty of data and they are using Palantirs foundry platform to organize data and make it more efficient. If it took the scientists months to read through the data and to analyze it, with the foundry software it takes them hours and in some occasions days depending on the amount of data there has to be filtered through. This works as a time acceleration for these cures and advancements. It’s like the phones usage. If I wanted to tell you something and the phone didn’t exist then it would take me days to reach you and then days for you to get back to me with a response. The phone allows us to do it instantly and because if that civilization has had incredible advancements. It’s like the Mail with the EMAIL. Or the horse with the CAR. or a boat with an airplane. These creations and inventions have accelerated life and innovation and expansion. Now moving foreword Artificial intelligence and software development could be the turning point for innovation and expansion by facilitating these things more effectively.With the distribution of vaccines, it would’ve taken many weeks if not months of logistics to come up with a plan on distribution. However given the data the gov had they would just input it in the foundry software and the algos/AI would do the work many X as fastTruth is how much is all of that software worth?? A software that optimizes time and efficiency to the decimal and limits errors while producing more and more value for their customers which is an incentive for their customers to keep the service..."
OMG very weak....where is the rocket fuel????oh....CEO Krap is not willing to fuel it.....why?
Ms Woodstock bought more. We need to see $43 by next Tuesday!
200 shares at 26.5 and I am happy :)
how can a stock have this kind of move with below average volume?
"Because of PLTR's Saas Foundry, Online ad companies can now compete against Googles ad AI Ad 360 called Doubleclick which is responsible for all of their revenues since they acquired it in 2008. Meanwhile, FB is also successful in its online ad revenue due to the helped by Microsoft selling them ATLAS to slow down Googles Double click digital marketing claws.I see Foundry leveling the digital marketing advertising very soon. Now if it can compete against Doubleclick & Atlas, what does that make Foundry & to PLTR stock price???"
Love my aunt Cathie
i havent seen premarket this green in a long time....bears looks like its getting sleepy
Another 4 months red seems reasonable.
Just bought more. holding long term and buying dips. I've locked up my shares at $300 so shorties can't borrow them. looking forward to watching both institutional ownership % and share price increase. patience.
Boom! Huge news. PLTR is now in the medical AI field battling cancer.https://finance.yahoo.com/video/celularity-looks-advance-cellular-therapies-194948672.html
Investors are accumulating PLTR.
What is next ? CORRECTION minus 30% !
Funny how the stock dropped like $20 then up about $2 and everyone got excited lol 
"When insiders sell you the aspiration but they themselves take the cash, what does that tell you? I think this is an opportunity to do as they do, not as they say."
PLTR will be able to breathe after earnings. Keep averaging down do not panic sell and remember why you bought.
Ya gotta hand it to the folks on here a few months ago who predicted that by summer this thing would be in the teens.
"Short sellers forgot the bull market is still here. Too many new trends coming from EV market to 5 G wireless, DDR 5 memory standard coming, genomics explosion, gene editing technology, Artificial intelligence and robotics revolution, add infrastructure spending all around the world also. Bull market has many more years ahead."
What the actual **** is happening
"Hahaha everyone freaking out Go do something, play outside, work, whatever This is a long term stock!What’s the difference if your down 20/30/50%?? Just don’t sell See you on top in 4-5 years at 300$!!GLTA"
So wood buys another 1.5 million now owning 16 million shares and that still can’t help the price.
Cathie is house of cards. This is not worth the price. $5
lolololololololololol remember this board was full of people saying they sold
But his hair.
Watching the rotation into value tech
The whole market getting hammered!!
"Yesterday + today's current price = 3% gain. That is what you want (slow, steady gains, a slight pullback, and nice bumps ONLY when HUGE deals are realized). The more people realize this is how PLTR is going to move long-term, the more stable the stock will be (and then we will ALL see larger and more consistentnt gains)."
Those who shorted yesterday and did not cover.. oh boy!
PLTR- $500 2026
"Keep in mind most companies DO NOT want their name out in public doing business with a high profile company in the surveillance and data. Confidentiality is crucial. In other words, the earning report could end up skyrocketing. With these hidden companies that are using palantir. We just don't hear about them right now. Hush hush.BULLISH Go PLTR"
Hold for 4 years and hope the republicans win next election. Thats the only way stocks like this will ever go back up
"Wow, is it me or does that trend line from opening look almost straight up?? Shorties, what you think?"
What a turn around!! Would anyone have expected to see $20 after the pre-market?
"My fellow PLTR Hemorrhoids,1. Cathie Wood buys 1.5million PLTR stocks... BUT our beloved PLTR stock goes down2. Palantir announces new clients, contracts, etc... BUT our confused PLTR stock still goes down3. Papa Karp sells PLTR stock... and of course PLTR stock goes down4. Nasdaq is up... But PLTR stock goes down5. Nasdaq is down... And PLTR stock goes down as well6. There is something STRANGE about PLTR stock... I am still trying to figure it out... The pattern is not clear yet...7. Maybe PLTR is a confused stock and it's COLOR BLIND? It can't distinguish between Green and Red?8. PLTR = Curse?9. Hemorrhoids are painful....Peace!"
REDDIT TIME
Hoping to see first ever profit since started
Hahahaha  
"Only thing this downtrend made me realize is just how much hedgie money makes up a lot of these growth stocks, and how much influence they really have in the market."
In 5 years you’ll own one of the most profitable software companies in the world. Palantir has proven itself on an international stage and continues to grow supportive relationships across governments/corporations. Read Peter Thiels book and you will realize how this company will change the world. Palantir has spent 17 years solely focused on developing the most advanced products in data analytics and AI. Patience will be rewarded. Weekly fluctuations mean nothing. Pay attention to accumulation institution ownership. PLTR is already in multiple Vanguard funds. Don’t forget about the Renaissance fund.
One day... far away from today. You and I will use PLTR to manage our own data. Mark My F Words.
barrons and crampperare doin a hit job
Redditors all left for the crypto markets.
"I’m going to try this again. My post keeps getting deleted with the link. Find out about stock manipulation. Search, “why your stock is always red”It should be the first site that comes up."
put a fork in this...everyone is onto the compensation scheme now. so buyers are looking for a real uptrend before they buy
"And kathie bought 747,000 more shares today, yaay!!!"
We need a roach bomb
Be careful ... EV stocks are now being hit so hard .. pltr could be the next !!
"All Tech stocks are now being used as funds to buy Home builders, energy, transport ,chemicals,....."
Green eod ! False flags on inflation ffs
"Bought more today. I have extreme confidence that PLTR will be around in 3 to 5 years, and doing well in 3 to 5 years. I don't know what the path will look like exactly, but TODAY 5/6/21 seems like a historical buying opportunity. Revenue from earnings on 5/11/21 being a super catalyst."
"Guys, why are you worrying when people buy or sell shares? Wouldn’t it be better than when no one buy or sell anything?"
Just imagine how many funds are getting ready to buy now. Dump you stocks and put your money in shiny objects like big boats or airlines! They will probably post a positive earnings report in next decade. In few day you will realise that you bought into a lie. I am ready to add so please just sell
"Too many da coco nuts here,Cheerleading improbable results."

PLTR: Oversold. Will be back in green later.
"May 16th, 2024: What's the share price of PLTR? Whoever is the closest gets a cookie!"
"Palantir has been awarded new or renewed contracts $$ almost every week. Ask yourself should some of this news make the stock go up or down? So why is it going down, because the big money institutions along with some retail investors jumping in for the ride are shorting the stock and will buy all of the share for cheap. Only for the stock to recover and hit higher highs. I will be riding it down and buy more when I feel like they have suckered all they can out of their shares. I have 2440 share and my average price is $23.00, I am not selling. I bought PLTR because they have software that no one else has in there field, I am not just saying that. I have read report after report, check and see how many countries use the platform for their police and military agencies and commercial businesses. PLTR has been receiving more commercial contracts and that was one of the items that the analyst were saying had a stranglehold on the stock. This stock will be worth a lot more money soon."
"What a F joke rotation into blue chip from tech they say, yea sure put you money in airlines and cruise and see how much wealth that makes you. Cruise and airlines will probably post a positive earning sometime in next decade. What a f joke."
I had the chance to exit @30 but I keept listening to YouTubers
It’s a perfect buying storm. Tech is way down. We somehow got entangled with GME and AMC. All the retail clowns that bought into the quick money narrative are taking their losses and moving onto the next shiny object. Tomorrow should show people that this is a real company with a real future. The institutions have been accumulating. Tomorrow is the first of many ERs for me. I have dry powder if the selling continues. It’s a marathon for me. Good luck longs.
Be greedy when others are fearful. Going to yolo into buying at ton of shares. Forget a 10x after this dip this will be a 20x in 5-10 years.
Anyone holding at $49?
"Morning update:Total Pre-Market volume = about 430,000 stocks soldHighest price = $20.88Lowest price = $20.50PREDICTION: We will be trading in the $21 to $22 range today...Now You Know!!!"
Unfortunately earnings won't matter much in this marketThis market is crippling. Long term will b fine but tomorrow next week not in my opinion. .Every stock outside of a few have been destroyed in the last 90 days
How can this company have an earnings beat if they paid out $1BIL+ in salary to top CEO?
"We are very close to pullback, Maybe another 20-25%"
Market never makes mistakes.. just hold and forget it !
"I didnt get the ""lets sell before earnings"" memo, lmao"
Pltr and Royal navy extend contract.... Another - 7%....
CEO worshipper here
Arise trajectory imminent!!!!
Aaaand...you are still trading at 83x this year's projected revenue. Still needs to go down by at least 75%.
"The revenue will be amazing in Q1, just think of all the wins they had in 2020, over $1B of new projects, these project will be delivered in 2021 and recognize the revenue."
Do We have a SQUEEZE !!
Perhaps I'll average down next year... And I thought that 25$ was a good price...
ARKK bought over 1.1 million shares today 
Earnings will not matter. It will go down or stay neutral.... anyway.Hold this for at least 5 years. Simple as that.
"Oh and by the way, insider transactions display more recent buys than sells recently. Karp makes headlines for selling but the amount of insider ownership has skyrocketed recently not decreased. Hmmmmm?"
 Cheers to brighter days ahead. Those earnings were quite reassuring
"i'm going to go out on a limb and say that 18.72 print was it. earnings report yesterday put the company on solid footing. it was good, not stellar but good enough to provide support."
who sold in PM?
I can't believe this was $16 pre market today
"think its getting near the end of the road with his syock now, looked promising but enough is enough"
"Alex Karp, Palantir CEO: ""Buy other stocks."" Thank you, I will."
Palantir is turning companies more profitable!
Gonna buy more if it continues to go down after open.
"should have bought the dip, but yeah, not enough money"
The street likes the stock
"WHAT a gift ..incredible. This is like buying apple in the late 90'. What an opportunity for a longtermholder to enter this stock. Just added 1000 - another 1000 will be bought at 17,50Thanks so much for selling"
"As the great Alfred E. Newman said : WHAT, ME WORRY ?"
Tuesday is a win-win. If the price goes up longs make money. If the price goes down we buy more shares on the cheap and make even more money in the end.
Come on! 21.50 let's go!
"KARP number one short seller ....he sold 500 billion , now he is buying 50 mil ....clever"
This is the nasdaq crash we all knew was coming. Its here. Save your money
i bought some shares at this price..... CHEAP!!!!
"Anyone remember when Palm IPO'd in 2000 at $95 and then hit a high of $200. End of 2001 fell to $7. Yeah, that was going to the moon too! Be careful buying dips especially if the stock is touched by Jinxed Woods!"
What is wrong with this stock it seems to go nowhere down 6 K
"Sure, relax. You lose money every day, but relax. You will wake up from a sweet dream with single numbers."
There is no safety in the market right now.
can this go back to 17 so I can load up?
Only Karp and Thiel know our faith at this time.
"Palantir dropping, Karp’s hair still flying high"
"Artificial intelligence is the next wave of transformational technology. Just as the internet changed every facet of our lives, AI will do the same. We’re invested in a company that allows companies the opportunity to build out algorithms that better their supply chains and make more efficient decisions. Supporting our government and military are an added bonus. I’m very comfortable parking my money here for a while."
I need more CASH to buy PLTR. Buying a 1000 more when the markets open.
You have not seen anything yet!
$15 is the new $20
"This is a 10 bagger at minimum, if all things go right 25x."
"PLTRs stock will only really rise significantly once they report a profit estimate either later this year or mid 2022. This week they reported for Q1 a loss of -$0.07, for Q4 2020 a loss of -$0.08."
At least we seen a line
This will lose all its gains by tomorrow morning. In this market no way this stays above $15 over next 30 days.
These second tier software stocks have literally been hammered...
"I don't mind if it goes up or down. I am currently holding almost 7000 shares. I will load about 10,000 more shares if it go back to the bottom. At least I am holding tech stock. Technology will always be needed."
Buying more......
I feel so bad for the Long's that had conviction that got shaken out premarket on earnings day I feel so bad for you guys
I can see larger hedge funds buying a ton at this level
why is nobdy mentioning the potential big contract renewal with the dod on the 25th ???
Pltr is on a downtrend
PLTR is an AI and dat company...it is NOT cybersecurity...This company was used to catch Obama Bin Barrack
"There is only one exit for those who bought above 20 - sell your house, while it's overpriced and start averaging down PLTR till $5. Dont thank!"

U. P. G. R. A. D. E. comming!!! $22-25 this month.
So the CEO with the crazed insider selling couldn't even be bothered to be on the earnings call? That is odd and sends double bad message to the street. Sounds like he's checked out.
I'm not going to even look at this today.
I have $100K in cash sitting on the side. I will buy $10k on each red day.
"Remember, NOTHING, I repeat, NOTHING is lost unless one sells when it is down."
Love this stock! We will be rewarded.
Great set up post earnings for Palantir. Market wanted to see growth in commercial customer base and Palantir delivered. This company deserves $1T valuation and easy $100/ share. This will eventually happen as they are the only company on face of earth that can keep customer data secrets at this point and will charge premium as we move into 2022. $1-3T valuation is just starting before we chase other data analytics majors. Great earnings and outlook. Hold strong. GL
Last chance to buy this massive stock under $20
"Over time , stock market is a wealth transferring machine from the impatient to the patient ones ....."
Good earnings tomorrow can have a 6% sell off if market continues like this good earnings could have good move to the upside but we will see remember there is a strong put sell at 17.50 which is the other support for this stock if this breaks could see 14 again
Any update on why the CEO was absent from the earnings report and call? That's weird.
Today $19 or $18 ?
"need to see a deal with Amazon, Walmart, Costco, Tesla or some major consumer companies"
How much longer until AMC catches up to Palantir share price?WOW.
ready for the drop!!! $17 coming to you nice and easy
i was so glad to be able to increase my position to 4000 shares during the downtrend
"A lot of people who said ""trash company"" are now buying because of fomo, and will be the first ones to sell on the next dip.I didn't sell any share at 26, and bought more at 19, you win in the investment game with knowledge and patience, this stock is a winner 100% in the long term. Best wishes to all the hodlers, who like me will never sell their PLTR shares."
Is miracles happening ?!
"With each day, new avenues for growth come to light. The applications of Palantir’s software toward increasing the operating efficiencies of both governments and businesses seem infinite."
"Today felt good, really hoping we hold the gains next week and continue a move to the upside ($25/$26) in the short term. Great buying opportunity this week but ready to leave the teens behind forever!"
"For those complaining about PLTR CEO stock sales. Let me explain how it works: when you a non-founder CEO gets hired, they get millions of options usually with a strike price that is not zero. As the company raises money before it comes public, those options increase in value. When company goes public and options vest, Karp then has to exercise those options and buy the shares outright. But if Karp does not have millions of cash somewhere to exercise the options then his only option is to exercise and sell the shares. And if he does that he would also own taxes on gains on the shares he decides to sell because he doesn't have the money for the outright options exercise. So he is forced to just liquidate just to cover both taxes and exercise his shares. That usually results in liquidating the shares from the excercised options."
"I do believe that, for this to make any great leap upwards, we are going to need aliens to come down, say they use PLTR technology to space travel and they have only come back to earth to renew their contract with them...then, because it is good news, it will probably fall again.."

"My fellow PLTR homies,1. Last night, I decided to watch a few YouTube videos about Palantir2. I listened to an interview with Mr. Karp3. Mr. Karp is REALLY MAD at Silicon Valley4. For some reason, he has a LOT of HATRED in his heart for Silicon Valley entrepreneurs5. This ""Political Disagreement with the Valley"" is his main reason for moving Palantir headquarters from Silicon Valley to Denver, Colorado6. Basically, he wants to work and profit from multi Billion dollars contracts with the government and military who love to use Palantir Services, however, Silicon Valley doesn't like the government being ""Big Brother"" to control the American people and their freedom.7. My impression of Mr. Karp is that he doesn't want to be politically correct or socially ""responsible"", and that's why he moved Palantir headquarters to Denver, Colorado.8. The big obstacle for Palantir is that the stock owners (meaning US the American public) are expecting him to make money, show more profits, and sign up more CIVILIAN and PRIVATE COMPANIES... instead of just military and government contracts9. So, it seems that Palantir might face Social Obstacles trying to sign up private contracts with companies such as Walmart, Kroger, Amazon, Facebook, etc... because of the push back by the American people... 10.

Then the unimpressive report and a 150 million share sell-off upon earnings - along with the customary massive insider dumping as the cherry on top. Should get this to the 15's. can you then imagine the insider panic selling at that point?
RESPECT to George Soros ! He is very honest man !
added more! Now I just chill and enjoy my day reading some good books. Easy pathway to be a millionaire by 2025!
I’m starting to think that I’m good on stock market investment. I don’t freak out like 80% of the people here.
300 shares at $29
If you are having any doubt about Palantir watch Alex Karp's interview with CNBC's Wilfred Frost today. It's on Palantir's home page. Karp is a genius.
"Stockinvest has a price target for Palantir: Low 20, Average 52 and High 170"
Have you seen what earnings? There have never been such.
"When you make so much money, that Venice Beach is calling"
Wow today we will see a huge jump!
I own 5 stocks pltr nio aapl hpi and aabb did own more but most my money is in real estate
"First, I am a long, but tired of listening to know nothings on this board so I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS PROBABLY GOING ON INSIDE PLTR BECAUSE I LIVED THROUGH IT... back in 2001 I worked at a start up. We had lots of options, we went public. The stock was at $70, 3 months later the stock was at $12, still the exercised options at higher prices created a huge financial burden due to the AMT tax. When the lockdown expired, people were selling stocks at $12 bucks in order to cover the tax on $70 of exercised stocks that they had bought with penny options and held. It was a HUGE issue in silicon valley during the dotcom implosion as employees that held to their exercise stock were in the hole with the IRS for tax bills that sometimes where 10, 20 times the value of the stocked they owned. So even liquidation wasn't a solution to their problem. I have no proof, but I suspect something similar is happening at PLTR. Some options probably were expiring, they exercised at higher price, they held, now their bosses are selling, the stock is getting hammered, they are looking at huge tax bills and they are having to liquidate at basement prices. I will tell you from personal experience, IT AIN'T A HAPPY PLACE TO BE WORKING IN. This will not just affect stock price, it will affect the work culture. I suspect that a lot of people that put a lot of work will leave."
I hope to go under 15$ to buy 1000shares!
"If my guess is right, there should be a rally to the close (currently at 19.62)"
Hello Bagholders ! We love you ! Don't forget buy more today we set premarket green for you
"what is very humorous about this massive 11 day sell-off is that they havent even announced a miss yet. but the stock and its repute has already been smashed by the arrogance of management selling strategies and snotty attitude. so if there finally is a miss afterall this, get ready for a true inferno of price destruction."
We will see green! Remember my words!
"Once enterprise software is installed, it is very very hard to displace it. Especially in defense and government applications."
"Guys, we are slowly recovering!! Heading back to 30 by end of May! "
"Palantir never ever closes green on a Friday, this is really uncommon and tells us that Monday it will explode."
"I like it, but I am not gonna hold my breath."
Here we go again
"The many of you lamenting on this board are either purposely spreading FUD or have no spine. If you’ve done your research (and watching Jim Cramer does not count). Then you take these days, weeks and even months as an opportunity. I’m frustrated as can be not with the price per share but with the length of time my IRS return is taking as it’s being dumped into this stock “hopefully” at these prices once it arrives.Was I wrong for not selling at the top? Absolutely!!! But I’m not crying either. The real top for me is closer to $250-500 per share for anyone with 5-10 year outlook. That requires patience and conviction in what you own. Something a fair amount of yahoo folks don’t seem to have.I’ll be here in 5 years to say I told you so. Until then my friends, place your bets. Being on the wrong side of this one will hurt and I can’t for the LIFE of me see how $23 per share can do anything but bring gains to those willing to wait.Get to know the tech and it’s historical limitations and you’ll feel much better.Cheers"
Who is holding more than 10K shares in here? You will be rich sooner than you know. Of course given that you have a longer time horizon for investment!
"May 11: Explosion or Implosion, this is the question. Anyone?"
Loosing all my money
I really want to load up on this again as it hit for me when my broker said buy it at 11. Unfortunately he said don’t buy it again till 11 but he told me to sell at 20 which was a huge mistake as it ran to 40. Im worried about all the free shares given to insiders every quarter just about which they then proceed to dump every single time. Is this not true. Its not the product but the self awarding shares which then makes them dump the previous awarded shares. Does this worry u 2. Again luv the product but no profit ever in18 yrs and the mounds of free shares that are awarded every quarter especially to ceo.does this worry u people also. God bless always and good luck 2
super strong despite the market crash....impressed..
GREAT NEWS ! KARP bought new and very fast printer ! It is able to print more shares non -stop for 24 hours 365 days !
Going higher and higher from here...normal upward trend...Do not sell below $40...
What is a good price to short this dog!!!
Fidelity just bought almost 1.8 million shares 
so who was buying under 17
Setting up low limit buys all morning. Thanks for the sale guys
im just worry about the Earning..
"Lotsa movement, good volume so far. I like it!"
I’ll take a 4% gain all the time
Price target is $10 for me with next 2-3 weeks. Thank goodness I only own 5 shares and I purchased using lottery winnings and not my own money

My bag got a little heavier today.
Come get me boys I’m holding at 30$
Long palantir. Lets hit 30
Surmises on the new Form 4's for the Karpster and the Thielster?
"God bless America, PLTRGod bless meWe will come for you 26, 30, 36By EOY"
Longs be warned; you are being played by a campaign of spam posts followed by a dozen or more fake replies.Think I'm wrong? read the replies.
If it does not break off the resistance of $21.26...oh boy.Only 26 cents does not look good. Hope the Insiders does not DUMP today!
should i buy this ir plunk?
Goodbye Palantir.Had some potential but was ran into the ground.
"Decisions, decisions. Take 20% profit or hold for the big payday."
The higher it goes the higher the odds of a squeeze.
"i don't buy into the theory that the triple bottom yesterday counted for anything. if you are looking for an actual bottom that many would say has to be taken out look to the march 5 , 2018 low. look for capitulation with a share count equal to that day 173mm. that is how it really works. you can retest a low but it needs to be with huge volume, otherwise it's just another day.what ms woods does means little. in actuality she is a small player and at the moment not having a very good time of it. what you really need to understand is how companies like blackrock take a position and literally work it into the ground for the benefit of their clients. they are in the game to make money and they don't mind killing share price in the process."
Jeeze PLTR is getting hammered. It is the whole growth side of the stock market. It's not just you guys.
All you people that thought they were buying in “low” yesterday... lol. A lot of new members added to the Palantir bag holder club yesterday
There’s an article on relative strength improvement of PLTR in IBD a few hours ago.
Some 1diots think $45 billion company can’t trade under $10. I ask them to look at GE with $116 billion and trading around $13! IMaO
PLTR going to cure cancer and still trade between $20 - $25
What is the true value price if 20 is too high?
Last time we went green for 3 days on the bounce was Jan 25th  let’s for for 4!
10 days red. I'm long term but how not hate the situation?
I went all in yesterday will need to wait till Monday to buy more. :-)
Pltr announced today they filed for bankruptcy. It was a good run while it lasted
"as we know PLTR has recieved Alot of contracts, I think this stock will be huge gain for long-term Good luck Investors"
This will eventually go up but this is still painful to watch
"Stanley Druckenmiller's Duquesne adds Palantir. May 18, 2021 7:32 AMPalantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR)C, FHN, CPNGBy: Liz Kiesche, SA News EditorStanley Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office takes new stakes in Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) with 5.98M shares"
"Nasdaq getting creamed. So is Tesla. PLTR holding up very well. If you plug in both Tesla and PLTR into a covariance matrix￼, ￼you will realize there is a strong positive correlation. They move together."
I'd be happy with a 21.00 close today. (it's a start)
"I feel like Yellen will crash the market again, a few hours later in the live briefing. AGAIN"
$1bn. Seriously? It is like a joke to check the revenue from last year and the compensation the CEO got. Come on.
"30%+ growth for the next four years and that is not good enough...well, good enough for me...I buyin' more."
CEO selling has to stop this is not going anywhere...Sad may be we should sign a petition.
Love watching all the know nothing bag holders pretend they are buying more everyday and don’t have an ave of $42  
the bottom was yesterday for anyone still wondering
Add it up. Go ahead meanwhile shareholders get the shaft
I m long since direct listing I have averaged up…. What do you think about the market cap ?
A successful day in the life of a Palantir investor is being down 2 percent lol.
Where you think the shorts are?
$23+ tomorrow thumbs up yes or thumbs down no?
"torn on this 1,made good money before on it but im worried about all the self awarded shares given each quarter that are in the 100s of millions,especially the ceo,then they dump all the previous self awarded free shares,am i wrong,luv the tech but it like ceo and insiders use this like their own little piggy bank which hurts shareholders,again am i wrong,torn on this 1"
$22-25 next week.
Lots of buyers today! Amazing! This will turn green as soon the market opens!
20$ end of the day would be an insane day.
What I love about PLTR stock is that it drops by about $1 per dayAt least it's predictable.My portfolio has a nice downward chart that looks bloody beautiful...I am crying... Help!
"Hey panic sellers, here’s another large purchase today. 5/3/2021 Nikko Asset Management Americas Inc. 5,640,148 $131.36M"
"My fellow PLTR players,1. ""Tomorrow it will be $40 because of awesome Earnings Report at 8am""2. I just like to say the above statement to help my severe anxiety.3. My psychologist and therapist told me to keep saying the above statement and one day in the distant future, my dreams will come true.4. My insurance company allows me 20 counseling sessions per year (I have a $4,000 deductible in my Medical plan).5. The official diagnosis is anxiety and lack of sleep, due to Palantiris Decease caused by prolonged RED bleeding of PLTR blood cells...6. Pray for my health and soul. I am losing it...Peace!"
"so, maybe there will be something in the conference call that will justify ms wood's buying yesterday.she's not looking to great right now."
who else is bagging PLTR
"as a public retail investor of PLTR stock, you’re not being pitched on its profits (it doesn’t have any). Rather, you’re being pitched on its aspirations; it will grow into its valuation.When insiders sell you the aspiration but they themselves take the cash, what does that tell you? I think this is an opportunity to do as they do, not as they say."
Where is Ramses 
Wall Street bets is coming to rescue this 
"Alex Carp's vision sounds exactly like Musk's or Bezoss's 10-20 years ago. Fully focused on long-term growth instead of satisfying small quarterly goals. Peter Thiel's book ""Zero to One"" (which I highly recommend) outlines the strategy behind Palantir: creating contrarian business that isn't needed at the time of creation but will dominate and monopolize that particular industry once the world evolves to need such services; ""great companies don't join the market, they establish a new one"". Investments in Sarcos Robotics and Lilium prove their long-term conviction. How many $40B companies spend hundreds of millions investing in tech that might start generating revenue 3-5 years from now? Clearly, Palantir is something special. Although I do think that it might take the market a while to wrap its head around what Palantir actually is and what value it presents. Good luck, everyone!"
"$1.67 Billion dollar contract isn't everyday news. Roaches, when the music stops playing...Will you have a chair to sit on?"
Who’s holding.. might as well!
13F filed today by Karp and many insiders are killing this stock
I think this company will report profits tomorrow...
"Extremely low volume, not sure what to think of that"
"No short-tarDs, the red is not the stock, it is the market and its irrational fear...buying when it is down simply pads profit for when it jumps up. Don't let short term fear/emotion stop you from buying."
Remember...a GREAT day for Palantir is when it's share price drops less than a dollar! :)
Starting to form some support
never buy first hour no matter what
Hopeless. Just lose everything from yesterday and delist already
"Take note: ""PLTR’s stock is going to be driven by a combination of changing TAM expectations, high growth, and impressive profitability in due course. Currently, it looks as though the market is underestimating all of these, so the future looks very bright, indeed""."
"My five year plan: bike rides, hikes, stretches, and bbq's. Then be fit, heathly and maybe sell my PLTr."
"Good thing they are in with the Coast Guard, as this ship is rapidly taking on water and sinking."
A very clear wedge is forming on the intraday chart.

"Renewal contract with us army is due on May25, I thing it is worth 728Mil.can some one verify?"
Today Cathie bought 1000000 share PLTR
Don’t hit that button! Unless you want to miss the rebound
For once I agree with Jim Cramer: he said PLTR is a battleground!
I did not get to buy the dip below $20 :(
I bought at 20.00 and thought I did so good. Even if I am long term this fall is frustrating.
This stock will see a new 52 week low. Because people don’t like Cathy Wood in her field.
just bought 500 shares before market close.... hope that was a good buy
"Retail investors are selling PLTR stock just like the big guys want them to, not me! Look at these buys by the institutions over the last 30 days. PLTR stock buys within 7 days 25.5 million, within 14 days 30.3 million within 30days 46.7 million SHARES. BlackRock was one of the institutions that bought 9.4 million within the last 7 days. Wouldn't have been better for them to have waited to after the earning to buy the stock cheaper if they thought the stock was going to drop down to lower lows? Isn't this a sign that the institutions believe the stock will increase?"
GDBanks upgrades PLTR to strong buy. 12 mo. target price $40.00
Moving money into PLTR from TSLA. I was thinking of holding TSLA till $1000 but better opportunities knock now.
im not feeling bad anymore after selling at 20.61. im buying back at 19
If you believe in this company the stock price should have NO influence. If it does you shouldn’t be here.
Revenge of the Nerds ! We got this ! see you at 100 in 5 years or less IMHO of course
"Max pain around 17.2 if you believe in fibonacci retracements. Brace for it, but... nothing fundamentally about the company or the market has changed. My gut says this will not be the armageddon that crashes the market just yet. Tech, the nasdaq, and stocks overall will resume their advance and soar to new highs in a few months."
"Will I break even on monday at 20,50$?? haha let's find out quite soon!"
Rare to see a company stock price to keep falling before ER.
When will we reach $28?
It made a beautiful rebound from $17.83!
Ark bought again...
Only 5 more trading days before earnings.
just hoping we can cross 21
Hello $15

BUY the dip??? With what money?????
Short Selling industry needs to be transparent. They rob people with 6:1 leverage. Stress test the Hedge Fund's so Archegos can't happen. CNBC planning on roasting Cathie on CNBC tomorrow with this blatant forgery of a market?
Thank you for for donating 15 billion $ to me and insiders by inflating share price. We just issue more shares if you like our stock. Regards Karp and friends...lol
This is just short time noise. Take advantage of this. Over time tech is the future regardless.
When this break the 25 no one will stop this
This stock is a roller coaster.
"So, Palantir invests in Bitcoin. Then, when Bitcoin colapses, how low will the stock price tumble down?"
att and IBM already profiting from their software....wait until other billion dollar companies jump on board..there will be no stopping this
"You guys spend too much time looking at the price. Look at 18$ this stock will 5x-10x in the next 5 years. Go spend some time away from the market and keep dollar cost averaging on dips. Trust me, I made a fortune off Tesla, FB, apple. I have barely sold any of those either since I’m no where near retirement. Gonna pass the stock off to my kids one day."
PLTR is rising !!! This company is the next Apple or TSLA. Nothing like it. Just have patience and we will be rewarded.
thank u god
"Honestly, I LOST interest in hearing about tomorrow's Earnings Results... (I really don't care at this point)In other words, EVEN if Palantir goes up by 20% after the Earning Reports, the stock will be about $22Yes, I know (99% feeling right) that the Earning Reports will be AWESOME GREAT FAULOUS... blah blah blah..HOWEVER: The damage has already been done...So, I really don't care if it's good or badHere is the PLTR pattern in the last 2 months:a. Palantir signed more contracts ==> Wall Street YAWN!!! Who cares.. Stock goes downb. Palantir Demo Day ==> Wall Street YAWN!!! Who cares.. Stock goes downc. More analysts say Palantir is a great company ==> Wall Street YAWN!!! Who cares.. Stock goes downd. Analysts predict that Palantir EPS and Revenue will BEAT BIGLY ==> Wall Street YAWN!!! Who cares.. Stock goes downMAYBE, for the stock to go up, we need to start hearing BAD NEWS: Palantir declaring bankruptcy? CEO Karp is sued by female employees, as usual!!!? Palantir Denver offices and engineers have been ALL shutdown due to a MAJOR COVID-19 infestation by all employees?"
Why is the rest of the market green? But not PLTR?
"Dear Palantir,1. I am LONG2. Please report BAD NEWS for tomorrow's Earning Reports3. Why?4. Because so far with non stop good news in the last 2 months, we had nothing but PLTR stock going DOWN5. In other words, the ""GOOD NEWS"" medicine is NOT WORKING6. So, let's try some ""BAD NEWS"" medicine for a change7. Again, I am LONG and I want ""BAD NEWS"" tomorrow from Palantir Earnings Report8. If PLTR is going going back to $10 per share so F-- [[[k]]] ing be it....?9. Why not!!!Peace!"
Back to 16 we go
+350 job openings. More companies paying over $100K per year for candidates with Foundry experience.
This is just the start to a huge run.
Under 10 is a good buy.
It is only a loss if you sell. Hope you never sell
"Buy 1 share for $18.37 now. Sell that 1 share in 2025 for $175.........................""buy low, sell high!"" Once again credit to Bernard Baruch of yesteryear. What if you bought 50K PLTR tomorrow and sold in 2025 for $175 per share? Payoff is $8,770,000!!! Almost $9 million bucks. Accumulate boys! Buy on every dip. GLTA."
Good earnings and new contracts on the way. $$$
Like if you trust this going back up to $30 or dislike if you think it going down below $20 .Personally I think it seem too easy for pltr to pull off . I think still have to retest $14-18 range.
"All the teck stocks are down, not only Palantir."
Cathie: We bought TSLA all the way down. And we’re buying PLTR all the way down too.
Question the motives of a grown man posting endless negative cartoons. These are the same infants that will change position direction in a heartbeat
Can someone explain why this is going up?
My crystal ball is telling me we will go over $21 today...PLTR will reach $25 by this Friday?
I'm long on this but we haven't seen the bottom yet. ~16 should be it
i just keep buying
this stock needs to be treated for hemophilia.

market makers will not let PLTR close above $20 today
"By now, the word is spreading. Palantir will start accepting Bitcoin. Shorts start having a slight chill roll up the spine."
30% threshold guidance for 2021 is a joke. More like 50% growth.$4B Rev before 2024. 2025 will be towards or over $6B.

Wall Streets buying at the prices they always wanted before Reddit pump. Earnings will be a beat. PLTR will be moving up before the end of the week.
Down trend broken
Being in the red is given with this stock. A good day is when it is down less than 1 percent.
Will surge near 21 last hour.25-30 by EOW.

I'm done here it's time to trade. Good Luck  
"Shorts lurking here to profits off all the puts bought today. Once everything relaxes, PLTR will stride. It’s fishy when you realize how much bad press this stock receives from the masses, it’s irregular and points to manipulation. Oh and by the way, Cathie Woods isn’t the only manager who owns this stock Vangaurd, Blackrock, and Renaissance have positions. PLTR will be just fine this is Christmas for long term holders"
Where are all the shorts now! Rally longs
"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."

How’s it feel bears!!!!
premarket giving people a chance to get out over $20.This will surely plummet back around 19 and change.
Every Yahoo board dominated by Haters. So sad. I don't think this is what Yahoo had in mind.
Earnings prove it’s a legit company making REAL money...finally some sense
Let's GO #$%$!
See you at $500! Good night! Hahaha
LIVE LOOK AT PLTR shareholders:
"My guess is that the Fraud Street whales force Palantir a lot lower before it rises again! That's why l am down here waiting to add a lot more! Besides, this is the weakest time of the year for stocks! Lots of stocks bottom out in June and July!"
If only the colonial pipeline was using PLTR‘s Technology
PLTR will be 100$ a share in 5 years or less. Hold and pay less tax. Hold for life and 10-20x. This company is my highest conviction value stock.
I have no money left to buy.
8% plus.............
Analysts are reducing price targets. CC was filled with unimpressive anecdotes and hyperbole. I didn't like the answer to the question about dilution from over the top Share based compensation.
So doubled down at $20.99 was that a smart move? LOL
Oh where oh where has did Dominic Decoco gone?
Just want to say that if nasdaq is red tomorrow could probably loose all their gains and see it back to 20.00 also by looking the chart couldn’t keep it above 21.30 tomorrow will need to keep it up and continue the uptrend until 22.50 so then will be a super bull trend
Pltr +BMW! If I see a red day today... I'm buying more and more!
Just pretend Palantir is the next Google or Amazon and you just have to wait it out until things come together. ￼
I can't believe that I sold this stock at a loss last week and then went in and out this morning and made my loss back plus! I never ever thought that would happen.....
Palantir = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pets.com

"Good afternoon,I may be presumptuous, but I’ve been wondering about the growth factor of this stock. (It could retrace tomorrow and stay down but I don’t think it will—- Although my twins sons point out my errors prodigiously.) That said, I read a book a while back, Monster Stocks, by John Boik. Anybody read it? Well, it describes patterns and factors, parameters if you will—-high tight flags, etc. that shed light on certain stocks. Relative strength is a key factor, for instance. I’m hoping, as we all are, generically long speaking, that we see a break out soon (in spite of the decline in Nasdaq).

"Earnings Report PLTR great. More Good NewsPeter Thiel’s data analytics firm Palantir Technologies is accepting bitcoin payments and may soon hold BTC on its balance sheet. Data analytics firm Palantir Technologies announced during a recent earnings call that it accepts bitcoin as a form of payment from customers and is considering holding BTC on its balance sheet. “During the call, an investor asked ‘could you ever see Palantir having bitcoin or any other type of cryptocurrency on its balance sheet?’” according to TheStreet Crypto. “In response, Palantir’s CFO, David Glazer said, ‘The short answer is yes. We’re thinking about it and we’ve even discussed it internally. If you take a look at our balance sheet there’s $2.3 billion in cash at quarter-end including $151 million in cash flow in Q1. So it’s definitely on the table from a treasury perspective as well as other investments as we look across our business and beyond.”Glazer went on to note that “in terms of accepting bitcoin from our customers, we do accept it as a form of payment. We’re open for business there.”https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/palantir-accepts-bitcoin"

"Selling & Marketing expansionWhy have their selling and marketing expenses risen to $ 136 million that is almost 40% increase. Is it IBM or EWS commission. If yes, that very steep increase for a software co or have they hired sales people by truckloads. If yes, then we are in for higher stock based compensations in the coming quarters which will increase the already inflated floating stock"
"What do you guys think, they will beat earnings ?"

"Guess what will happen when:1. Customers will start to present improved balance sheets as a result of the implementation of the systems (we are talking about huge customers and first class in their industries).2. More investors will be exposed.More long-term investors will join who will hold tight. Demand will rise.The co-marketing engine with Ibm, and the successes in section 1, will cause a long queue of organizations interested in joining.They will pay what is required.Monopoly, have we already mentioned?4. Planetar's profit line will hit the forecasts.I'm starting to think that it is possible that the predictions / expectationsDisabilities within a paradigm.I calculated a number of very, very conservative models.Weighing the points up, and I allowed myself to assume somewhat surprising numbers.Higher than the common predictions. My conclusion ( I know there will be a lot of opposition here in the forum to my words, and that's fine):Why not start talking about $ 100 in 2021?I'm starting to believe it's feasible.I would love your opinion.English is not my native language, sorry if I made syntax errors."

Palantir Technologies Stock Earns Technical Rating Upgrade Amid Growth Selloff!
"All pumpers blame the short, the weather, the size of hamburger patty....Really? So price descends has nothing to do with:1) $1.18 billions LOSS last year..2) 18 years in business and never once made a penny profit..3) Insiders sold over 400 millions and still dumping shares..4) CEO was compensated over $1 billions last year .5) 1.8 billion shares outstanding, which poses a risk of REVERSE SPLIT before issuing more shares for insiders or equity financing."
fed said something right will start tapering off buying. they admitted they causing the inflation
Volume of 1.6 million in early trading. Larger than usual. What it means?
Shorters are partying!
"Am very disappointed with the performance of this management team, all this company turned out to be is all Hype, there balances sheet doesn’t look good, and I see the stock going to 5 buck a share if they continue this way, and don’t turn things around. It will be 10 - 20years before one see any good returns on their investment."
all cybersecurity stocks are green except pltr of course 
"To the rookies here who keep saying ""omg insiders are selling, stock is garbage""... Please educate yourself. I have worked for a tech start up and issued RSO = restricted stock options. When these RSO's become vested, they become taxable by the IRS. A lot of these people don't want to use there own bank accounts to pay a large sum of taxes, so they sell the shares needed to pay the taxes. This happens with EVERY single tech that goes public. Look at FB, in 2012, Zuckerberg sold 2b in stock. The majority of that was to cover taxes from stock becoming vested. 2nd, an insider just can't sell tomorrow, they are held to different rules by the SEC to prevent fraud. They issue they want to sell XYZ shares, a date is chosen at random and it sells that day. It is usually 3-4 months out, when I went to sell, they chose a date 4 months away that it will sell. If the stock is down, the person can't just cancel the sale and say never mind, it is 100% sold. Like I said, some of are selling for some profit, most are selling to cover taxes. If you saw insiders liquidating 100% of positions, that is alarming, most are selling 5-10% of the position which tells me 100% it is just for taxes. No different than the company I worked for back in 2012, and no different than FB. Go look at Peloton insider sales after they went public, same thing, insiders selling. When you get your salary, you pay taxes on it. When they get there vested stock, that is like a ""bonus"" and they pay taxes on it. Stop freaking out about insiders selling, it has nothing to do with the company. The company is 2 for 2 on earnings, they beat EPS and Revenue back to back and raised guidance to a 30% yoy growth for 5 years.Why is the stock down? The stock is down because they are issuing TO many shares to the employees. So wallstreet and retail did not like seeing Karp get 1.1b in a pay package. Keep in mind, this pay package is paid over 12 years. He gets 2.5% vested stock each quarter, and guess what, he will pay taxes on those 2.5% of shares every quarter so I expect him to probably sell stocks every quarter for that reason.Once they stop issuing so many shares to the staff, you will see profits and the stock can rise. Karp told CNBC, this is mandatory for the time being to retain top talent and eventually this will level off like other tech companies. The key thing is, how long will this last because as long as this last for another 1-2 years, expect us to sit anywhere from 15 - 25 range if they still stay this large of compensation."
It's about time we saw a $1+ move on these shares.
looks like + .50 today. I'll take it x 5000
Could this be our new higher low. Hope so. Let’s see a higher high........
If we closed above $20.22 that would be glorious putting us in green territory for next week on the charts
Every time I buy low it goes lower
"Ha- Did you really think it was over,,no way,the funds want to take every penny from retail !!"
Perfect end to a great week thanks to the GREATEST short stock since Enron and Lehman Brothers. But let’s give credit where credit is due! This would not have been possible without CEO Karp dumping his voluminous shares. And THAT will continue next week too!
This is the only stock in red sinking out of 18 stocks that I invested....WOW...really Karp???
Who is still selling?
dumping when market begins everyday Non stop

"I know that as I feel fed up and sell, that is when it surges!!! I know it!"
"I'd like to see a tesla contract, be good for both companies"
"Why have insiders and the CEO been panic selling their shares ever since Day one? They've basically ruined the stock in record time. As they likely will miss earnings expectations and further annoy the street, it's not looking good so far. Trainwreck is the appropriate word. And the furious inside selling will continue unabated. It has been a fine scam they've brought public. hats off to them."

Hopefully a few upgrades today

"Watching the move, are y’all?!!!!"
The market is up and Pltr is going down??
M don?t #$%$ on people because they don?t have a great job like u. But for the grace of god it could be u. The thing that?s aggravating with pltr is ceo and insiders keep dumping their free shares no matter the pps because they are freebies and then ceo awards himself and insiders 100s of millions of new shares each year which they then proceed to dump. It doesn?t help shareholders who are paying for their shares. The float is at 3 bill. 0 profits in 19 years. Pps has cratered from 45 to 20. Meanwhile the ceo has become a billionaire with all his free awarding shares which he then proceeds to dump in the market. Am I wrong. Look up ceo total pay last yr including his dumping of 100s of mill of free shares. Luv the products but the way the ceo awards himself and insiders 100s of millions of shares each and every yr makes me think twice about investing in this. Its like the ceo is using the company as his own little piggy bank. Am I wrong. Ceo has become a billionaire while 0 profits in 19 yrs. look up ceo total pay last yr including his dumping of 100s if millions of shares. Have a puke bucket ready when you see it. Meanwhile the pps has cratered from 45 to 20. Please explain how and why im wrong as I would luv to load up again as i did at 11 but sold at 20 before all profits were gone. Again explain to me where im wrong as I would luv to buy again but the whole self awarded free shares in the 100s of millions which they then proceed to dump makes me wary. Would luv to be proven wrong but the way the ceo set it up with all the free awarding shares in the 100s of millions which they then proceed to dump each and every time gives me a bad feeling about this again look at ceo total compensation last yr including his dumping of of 100s of millions of free awarding shares. God bless and good luck everyone always
who's buying more today let's go mother flowers 
"Just wait, great price coming at $2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I will get 5 shares then...I hope I will not lose any money.LOng term investment with my 5 shares"

"12 cent min earn, per share"
"Come on keep the negative noise coming. I get it its easier to bash and trash and manipulate narrative. Bottom line is that for sound investors those of us that have weathered many storms this too will pass. When it is back to $45 I will still be holding along with many others. When it hits $100 I will still be holding. Yes time will tell but what this company can do by gathering data and using it to calculate the way people move and spend. Whats the line ""PRICELESS""."
"Palantir's management estimates its total addressable market tops out at $119 billion annually across both its commercial and government segments. Given that the company generated revenue of just $1.1 billion in 2020, it clearly has ample opportunities for growth."

"Watch the price of Aunt Cathie's funds. Every day the price goes down and people withdraw money. Aunt will have to start selling. And then an avalanche will start ... Single-digit prices are inevitable. In this context, Cathie's massive purchases are the kiss of death. ARK was buying huge amounts at 20 + $. See where the price is now - below $ 20 and the decline accelerating."
OMG !!! City Group give 170$ price target from 15$ !!! I can’t believe…. That’s what I call good news :)

"Come on, let’s get a last minute spike to $21. Just to make the shorts hurt more."
Obvious - Wallstreet is against Cathie and everything she does

PLTR will have to go up to $28 and hold that level to go up further.
"This is a great company, but soon this stock will be trading below $20. I will have lots of dislike for.However the current stock market is all rigged and manipulated by the feds and Hedge funds.Peace"

"Honest question: What do you guys think of the CEO? I'm very interested in the company and thinking of buying in tomorrow, but the CEO gives me some hesitation. Don't get me wrong, I do like him, but I feel he's too outspoken and political that, undoubtedly, he will burn a lot of bridges with potential customers. I feel he needs to bring it down a notch. What do you guys think?"
This is going up hill
like this comment and comment one company pltr is working with or has a contract with.
waiting for$ 23
This happened with draftkings also . The lockup expired and the stock went down and sideways for a season then bounced back .Lockup is over and that’s a great thing.
"Nobody knows how the end of the lockup period is going to play out. It could go higher or it could go lower. In many cases there usually is a decline, but not necessarily right away. Could happen slowly over several months. ￼ ￼Insiders were able to to sell 20% of their holdings when Palantir began trading as an IPO. When lockup period expires, Insiders will then have the option to unload the other 80% of their holdings if they wish, adding more supply of stock to the public. There will be some insider selling for sure, but I suspect most Insiders believe this is a great long-term play and will hold onto most of their shares."
If it breaks 25. Watch out below

Hopefully, the stock won't crash, which I don't think it will due to the cult following of Peter Thiel.

Cathie Wood of ARKK initiated an position of PLTR 5.2 million shares yesterday (Feb 18)
"One thing I know for sure, nobody knows jack &#@$"
What! Another red day?! I ve already put all my money! Here! Come on! Now let's move this up!This should be over 40!
I believe I can fly... To The MOON
"IBM is in. Next is Amazon. And Salesforce. I promise you, this is just the start."
"In my view, 3M’s expansion of their contract w/Palantir, to the entirety of their (millions of) line items and huge data set, is serious evidence that Palantir brings value to a profit oriented company. But then, I’ve got several thousand shares, at a loss, so what do I know?"

"i am 23 and working full time making sub minimum wage +tips and have been finishing off my degree. Since inception, i have been putting all of my tip money into pltr while my hourly wage gives me the basic necessities to survive. i been living like an ape for 1 whole year and managed to save 20k. which is all into pltr. if i can do it. you can too"

The way this stock recovers is phenomenal
Short it as you please. I will hold it strong. Long term winner baby.
Added 5000 more shares. Love these dips.
I’m actually going to buy more!
"Too many people gambling on options rather than buying shares and investing is where we are right now. It is becoming a problem. Regardless, I am very invested in Palantir and have no intentions to sell for many years. This company will change the world for the better."
Worth noting that most of the sell off today could have been from soros dumping their shares. They said they were going to do to ethical concerns. They’ve been an investor since 2012. Seems like it’s held pretty well around the 25 range. If it goes green tomorrow this might be the bottom.
"My girlfriend said, Me or Palantir?I miss her.....$$$$$$$$$$$$$"
Told my father to buy the stock. And he did. hehe

"Why did the Director, Peter Thiel sell 20 mil shares on feb 18th?"
Come on. This is stock market. Of cause there is ups and downs. But believe in the long term portfolio of pltr. They are winning contracts and they have huge investors investing on them. What makes you think this won't go to 50 soon? This company is a gem. One of a kind.
Oh nooooooo! It's the yield. And I don't mean dividend! Run Forrest run! So I just started my first small purchase of Palantir.
Ouch 10 yr Treasury is bumping up against 1.50%. At one point it even went up above the S&P 500’s yield. The pace of rate increases is shocking. I expect people to be taking profits as this continues to occur as stocks valuations will be coming in.
So pullback day is over today. Back to $25 plus Monday
she really gets going now
Red but it will probably hit 40$ this year.
Over $40 On Thursday !!!

That was a very bad interview. I think he did a lot of damage.
Quite shocked that people are unloading when it's pretty obvious that this is a bottom and 35+ is right around the corner.
"I love the opportunity here. bought 1417 shares at $29...With all the attention from reddit, webull comments, and Google search volume...its hard to say how high this will go...yet this is not gamestop...palantir is a credible company...so no matter what, you're safe to buy..."

I’m 80% cash. When do I buy this stock???
"Market sentiment has turned positive on PLTR, more good things to come. I bought the IPO, not because of PLTR but opportunities missed by not buying companies Peter Thiel brought to Market in the past."
always red
Shorts in full panic mode now.
"big news coming tomorrow, 40+"
I like the company but is going to be a long journey. holding for few years.
bought more today to bring average down to 26.
They have to make our options even more expensive so these weekly games attract investors that seek insurance and not these abusive gamblers.
"Now that woods have some share. will this go up like ROKU, Square, FiVER.."
give up wsb
Holding strong. Not worried at all!
uptrend intact
happy to get in. a bit late at 27 but still good entry point imo
very green in frankfurt
PLTR management.
"This is the dirtiest battle on Call holders I have seen. They want to sweep the board clean before the next push higher. Not just Palantir options, on the whole tech market."
i bought this at 25.77. rode it all the way up to $30 and rode it all the way down to 20. There is Nothing happening in palantirs horizon. will follow nasdaq sentiment so im assuming this is all algorithmic trading at the moment.
I run out if money yesterday I couldn’t buy any more  come on PLTR
"LOL, I love how people on this board are telling others to BUY NOW! Even if everyone on this thread bought in, it would not budge the price. Same things with shorts telling people to sell. Even if everyone here did, it will not do anything to the price. Relax."
"I’m confused, people are actually selling?"
"Unlike others in the forum, I have no predictive abilities.After hundreds of pages that I read, studied and researched,I am convinced:After 17 years of development, the company has flexible, multi-industry products and a team of groundbreaking executives with a unique vision.The contracts that are being published these days have probably been in the pipeline for several months.Now ready for signing and publishing. Think, how many contracts are in the negotiation phase ....For me it's time to keep loading.There will come a day when faith will pay off."
I am now overweight PLTR and looking forward to tomorrow. I think markets will finish strong this week. Get out of cash. My $MS $GS $JPM $BAC looking good too. Buying banks at the bottom of the curve is prudent. Five year holds on all mentioned.
"I have one word for you bears.Cathy Wood. Sorry, that was two words, but you get the gist."
i hope it stys at this price so i can buy more for months. but it wont. ill just buy while it goes up the next 3 years then ride it until 10 years
If you need money now get a job. If you want money tomorrow invest.

CATHY WOOD GIVES ME WOOD! Who is with me!
"cathine wood bought 3,365,400 shares on Friday.."
buy some more
"Motley Fool article on why Palantir is a buy:“I've been cautiously watching Palantir from the sidelines since its IPO, and I missed the big jump last year when shares went from sub-$10 to briefly over $40. Since then, the stock has been reduced to a much more modest valuation and the price is down some 40% from its peak. And after seeing the Q4 update -- the first for Palantir as a public company -- I'm ready to start (still very cautiously) dipping a toe in the water. My caution stems from the well-documented fact that the bulk of Palantir's business is derived from government contracts. There's also a lot of new stock being doled out as employee compensation that could throttle growth of a stake in the company. But Palantir expects its sales to grow an average of 30% a year through 2025 as data analytics demand picks up steam. Palantir has also made changes to speed up the rollout of its software for commercial companies, and it's posted some early successes on this front. Plus, Palantir is highly profitable (on an adjusted basis that backs out non-cash items like employee stock-based compensation, operating profit margin was 32% in Q4). The company also has loads of cash: $2.01 billion at the end of 2020, offset by debt of only $198 million. For a high-growth software technologist in a fast-growing industry, that kind of liquidity paired with a profitable operation is powerful. Granted, even after the recent taming of the stock price, Palantir trades for 32 times expected 2021 revenue (assuming the company grows sales by ""only"" 30%, although management said to expect ""30% or more"" growth). It's still a costly price tag, but not terribly unreasonable if the company does in fact deliver on its five-year plan. Thus, I'm ready to start nibbling a little here.“"
Sell off was brutal but I am still up over 65 percent. This is a long term play for my bull thesis to play out.
"Questions, what caused PLTR NEGATIVE EARNINGS to blossom to almost 1 billion. There will be more growing pains as I see it as they ramp up. I love pltr. But why buy it if it will forever be in a hole. Are the expenses one timers or forever on the books? The institutions are 6 months ahead in their views so 6 months from now were still in the 20’s. The pop to 30 was irrational unfortunately. Or the love of the stock to the likes or kathi wood could just propel this company but that’s a paper tissue narrative. It’s a tough call. What it her motive for buying. Will earnings be positive in a year ? A billion with of deals won’t be signed. IBM cooperation could be a positive because pltr sale expenses could hold steady as they piggy back on the few thousand sales staff at ibm facilitates contracts lowering the cost of client acquisition? I don’t know no ones discussed this who have better knowledge than I"
"I believe Cathie Wood recently purchased somewhere around 6.8 million shares. Pretty sure we're all going to he just fine. It was probably heading to 23 last Friday with the lockup expiration and her purchase news turned the price around a bit. This is a growth play not Value play, so quit squaking about the fundamentals."
"I’m ready for this thing to run to the 30s by end of month! To all you bears out there, don’t be surprised when it does. "
I’m long and don’t care if it falls to $10. Will just buy a ton more. Long term I’m not concerned one iota about the stock. Getting excited about all the cheaper shares I may be buying. Goes up I win. Goes down I win. That’s how I view this stock.
"Words of wisdom: If you have to choose between dumping your girlfriend or dumping PLTR stock, dump your gf."
I'm long and will remain long . But if this News is so great why is it fading into it ???
Let's get a good laugh
"1. Lock up is done2. Citron bs has passed3. Earnings report panic is overThe long-term steady growth continues. Embrace the volatility and focus on the long-term trajectory and you’ll sleep a lot better at night .I’ve watched multiple “selloffs” since I got in below $10 and it always ends the same way: those who sold impatiently regret it .Check the comments, been saying this consistently every time I’ve posted here .Weak hands lose out 9/10 times. Patience is a virtue but it’s everything in this stock market."
As usual. Red on premarket. EOD rocket.
"Rest assured this will reverse to back to the high side soon and move up to $34 before it takes another small hit. This is very clear on the graph. Keep in mind the 1st quarter will end in 30 days, and already PLTR said the revenue will grow by 40%, and I am sure this was a conservative estimate. I expect this to continue climbing up until Q1 announcement."
This could be a nice buy the dip entry point..whay you think!!
time to release pltr from its cage. i checked the same dates that gme went up last time. pltr went from 25 to 40 in same time 3 day period.
"PLTR tip of the day:If we cross $24 past Noon Eastern Time Zone, we may end the day at $25...However, the computerized trades using the power of PATS = ""Python Automatic Trading Scripts"":1. Must wake up at 11:30am2. Analyze the trades from 9:30am to 11:30am3. Adjust their AI = Artificial Intelligence input parameters4. Update the PLTR target price between 11:30am to 2pm5. Typically, the AI automated trades are fired to put pressure on the PLTR price in order to keep the $22 to $23 target price range6. HOWEVER, if you have OUTSIDE and UNPREDICTABLE behavior, such as REDDIT and WallStreetBets people messing around with the usual ""Institutional Pros AI algorithms"", then the AI based trades will go CRAZY and the price will go up in a very unpredictable manner7. When you are trading, you must try to OUTSMART both the weak hands and the Computerized AI Algorithms8. Now you know!!!Peace!"

It's hilarious how undervalued this company is. The societal shifts that'll occur in the 20s are going to break the brains of these myopic Wall Street analysts.
"Well, the stock is up because CPI was slightly lower than expected driving the 10Y Treasury yield down. Why was CPI low? Shelter inflation was at a 10 year low in February. Must be a housing crash going on lol"

There we goooo! I bought this morning more
"Guys...This price reduction has nothing to do with company's performance.

"i get in today , so far so good , 100% PLTR great company !shure 50 usd stock in the near future."

Its really interesting how low the niveau is in here. I don't get the idea of the pump and sell posts. To all the shorts and pumpers: check the valuation of the company and accept that your wierd messages will make the stock niether go up or down. Its tidysome to mute all this spaming. This place could be great for posting news and real opinions.

Please wake up...Thiel and Karp have long felt like Big Tech has done everyday Americans a disservice. They direct listed to allow ALL of us to benefit and prosper off of their genius..Yet some of you want to ask why they haven't turned a profit? The answer to that profit question is EVERYWHERE should you just read into the company, watch some youtube clips of Thiel or Karp...They have a trail of crumbs that they've lift for retail investors and some refuse to look down to follow it?

I was out of chips for this dip. :(

"Today's deep thinking:1. Imagine that there are ONLY 1000 trucks2. Each of those trucks can be loaded with PLTR stocks3. I have loaded my truck and I am waiting to unload when the time is right4. Now, there are 999 other trucks that are currently loading and unloading each day5. As time goes by, we will get to a point where we have some balance where these 1000 trucks are fully loaded with PLTR stock6. Just like me, these 1000 trucks don't want to unload until the time is right7. Now, the 1000 truckers (including myself) will wait... and wait... and wait... until buyers are willing to pay $30 per share...8. At that points, I become a little greedy and I start to gently unload my truck by selling 10% of my PLTR holdings and wait....9. Is this a good strategy to load and unload the PLTR truck?10. Is this how Cathie Wood loads and unloads her PLTR truck?Peace!"

"This is a marathon not a sprint. If you can’t handle the wild swings then this is not the stock for you. I suggest Costco or Visa, which are great companies, but move really slowly. I expect Palantir to be a roller coaster of a stock for several years until it becomes more stable. Most IPO’s are. If you believe in this company then load up. Five years from now it’s probably going to be worth 10 times higher than it is now."
Dear PltrWe have had happy days with you in the past ... Why are you doing this to us now?
"ark like ptlr, no worry !!!"
Palantarians: I hope some of you bought Yeti like I rec'd last week. It's not even close to done. Big Winner.When will we hear about TSLA and PLTR joining forces...soon enough soon enough.

"First of I am a long investor in PLTR. What happened today was typical of big money selling off and locking in profits to drive the price down and clear out short term investors then buy the shares back at a better price. Look at the low volume today. I expect tomorrow to be high Volume and would be surprised if we are not back to 36 or higher because there is no trading Monday and earnings are pre-market on Tuesday. So if you were waiting for a pull back in order to get in, today was that opportunity. Last thought, I would not fear the lock up expiration. If earnings are not as expected and we see lowest or high 20's after earnings do you think people will unload their shares when they see that it hit $45. Also I think Thiel and Karp have a ton of money to buy those shares on Fri the 19th if they beat earnings and get a pop to reward not only their employees but to drive out the shorts and reward us longs for our loyalty!! I want to wish you all good luck. In 25 years of investing and being in on some very good trades early in aapl, goog, Tesla. I can tell you PLTR is 100 stock in 18-24 months. I do think that values are stretched past 45 but at 40-45 is a good value if they beat on earnings especially with IBM being a great start into the corporate world with the GOVT being a solid income source forever."
WAITUN FOR TOMORROW GREEN ALL DAY BABY
40k reactions and 50 viewing ...lol...let's go!
Going in
Why did Cathie add TDOC? Didn't she get the memo that $amzn is now a competitor? Her overconfidence is going to destroy this fund (and the underlying companies) $tsla $pltr
interview at 3:00
"Consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 2 cents indicating a sharp decline from 9 cents reported in the third quarter. I do not understand why would Zacks come up with this article knowing all the new revenue that PLTR will have with all the new contracts, Future guidance would be our only hope?"
huge volume at the end
Wish it want it do it

"When MM behind Algo wants me to sell, I do the opposite"
"People need to do their DD, look at my history comments for this Stock, told ya there was a Dip coming, granted didn't know the dip was this high. Still I sold part of my shares to lock in the price at 38.00, now I am using the funds to get back in. My guess is tomorrow after the lockup expires, see where the price is at, to those that stay, its still good, this stock will hit triple by next year, I just wanted to cash out and have money to get back in to get more shares, I love this Stock!!!"
$25 average and holding for at least a year. Ya'll mfs either have paperhands or you love bending all the way down for Uncle Sam.
"Ark and others buying.Lock up is done.Earnings is done.We’ve survived citron.Survived the 25% dip in 2 days.What more can they do? . I appreciate the dip in price, added more and holding strong."
Tomorrow +18% ..... The lion has woken up !
All these shorts going to have nightmares all weekend knowing ARK bought 5M shares today
happy I just bought! Very nice entry point to load up again
Buy and hold. This stock will be back to $40+ within days.
Gap up huge Monday like at least 15% I’m loading up 2k at 4am! Will increase my position to 6k holding for 5 years! See you at 2k in 5 years!
$26 is now support. Next stop $30. Good luck
I did a little swing trading today to get chips for the dip!! Increased my holdings by more than 20%.
I like the vision and culture of Palantir. Worlds most important software company
Not Selling
Why is this the only red stock out there? What’s the deal with PLTR?
CONGRATS if you caught BFT under $15 last week. It’s still under $17 for now.BFT highly anticipated merger with PAYSAFE coming. 
looks like market bottom in futures rallying hard
Cathie is bae
all I know is my bosses hedge fund was loading up on this all week. He told me to buy all I could. He has only done that one other time. He is a multi millionaire so I will follow him.
Next week Tuesday $42 ~ $50
Event coming in April to focus on the Foundry platform.
Palantir refuses to work with China government! Just like Google!
"I don't like short term predictions, but here it goes.. $30 by 16 April."
"Don't miss the train, last call!"
breaking the 24.66???LETS DO THIS
About 50 days until Q1 earnings. Can not see too many analysts believe the $4B guidance for 2025 when Rev comes in at $350m. It will be more like $8B at least for 2025.
eh...futures -3.5%; another bad day? I'm a bit concerned about the trend
"These are very bad signs for the market in general. -2,5% NASDAQ ending +1.55% The market does not know what to think or what to do. Panic is very close."
Thank you who ever sold me their shares. Going golfing. See you all later. Don’t forget to have fun.
26.00 and change tomorrow high 27.00and that is pushing it.
a stimulus is here. What more does nasdaq want?
"Stuck at 37, any help boys?"
who is loading in dip ?? THUNBS UP !!!
Brothers I bought 2800 shares today.
"Forward PE 263, Forward P/S: 55, Forward P/B: 47. Cathie Wood is no value investor."
Karp. ..... you are the man.
"Hey guys, Monday morning at opening let’s all do the 5 Share challenge.#5ShareChallengeWe all buy 5 shares each to increase the price."
Once again shorts lose
Do you think Palantir and their technology can help me find my father? He left when I was 7 and I have never seen him or from him again.
Hit 30 today
volume is .....wow....
So much bashing of the founders and insiders. The same ones that cut out the bankers to direct list at $10.
The effects of the lock up expiration have been greatly exaggerated by the general market correction in tech. I am of the opinion that two birds may be been killed with one stone and this is the new ground zero and we go up next week.Good luck to you all.
The funny thing is that most who are selling don’t know why they’re doing so. Just following other blind sheep.
Will rip premarket! Cathie wood baby loaded up 81 million dollars worth of shares after market closed Friday! 30$ tomorrow!
"Read my previous posts guys I told you to hold, this is just the beginning of a great run PLTR"
PLTR = 19% SHORT INTEREST IM NOT SELLING@! I HAVE DIAMOND HANDS NOT PAPER TENDIES
it's like taking candy from a baby.
added more at 25.20!
I have come to a point where I do not care when PLTR is red because I know it has great future.
technical analysis says bullish trend beginning. hope everyone averaged down or loaded up!
A lot of emotion with Pltr on here. No panic... This is a great company.
"My girlfriend said: ""Me or Palantir?""Sometimes I miss her."
Holding this for life
T0 70 dollars
"Lots of good news today and so many catalysts!!!! J&J vaccine approved, Stimulus passed! 10 year bond yield falling again, PLTR lock up over, so many contracts bought that betting the stock will shoot back up to 40$ Cathie wood loaded up the boat last week! I see this ripping to high 29-30$ today!"
"Just keeps moving up in AH. Up now $1.50 (6.00%) on volume of 8.2 million, Yes, the Cathy effect does matter!"
55$ bound.
Bought the dip. Great day to buy.

"Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is +1.38 at $26.30, with 2,482,002 shares traded. PLTR's current last sale is 181.38% of the target price of $14.5. For more hot stocks like (PLTR) just go to (http://trade-view.com)."

"We hope those of you on this call who are current investors stay with us and those of you who prefer a more short-term focus, that you choose companies that are more appropriate for you,” he said.CEO Alex Carp PLTR"
150 @ 27 if it drops little more this week I will load the boat
After hours today back to 27.50
whats a good price to buy 50 more?
We need an investigation in the NASDAQ INC. for rigging the exchange. On every down day because of low volume they drop the prices significantly in order to get people to trade and make them money. Check for yourself: $NDAQ at all time highs today whereas $IXIC slumps. IF this game ain't rigged to the core I don't know anymore. ALGOS + NDAQ Exchange collusion? You bet... $baba $tsla $aapl $momo $msft $dji $pltr $fb $goog $jd $nflxSEC please step it and go after the algo traders and exchanges. The fish always starts smelling bad at the head.
My net position in PLTR is +10% but I would not sell this. I have got diamond hands. Who else has diamond hands. Thumbs up! To the moon 
Holding 367 shares )) grabbed 100 more today at 25.05
ho ho ho! going up!
This is just the beginning for PLTR.
Goldman Sachs says buy! $34 target.
selling not done yet. market still got a bit toncorrect
PLTR is the few stocks you need to retire
Much needed day
Way undervalued. Do you DD
"What other company is ""committing"" to growing atleast 30% per year over the next five years! Clearly a strong buy!!!"
buying 3 more shares tomorrow
Love that the CEO loves

"I see PLTR started down, but is making its climb to regain ground."
Peter Thiel plans to integrate soft mechanics into the foundry platform so businesses like 3M can benefit from the ease of use it will bring. It's tremendous to bring simplification to the platform because it allow companies to mutlilayer their marketing. A lot of people will be able to join and sell their products and benefit from the pyramid. The oversimplifiaction can drive consumers into purchasing more of the foundry and government contracts like gotham brings the appeal of palantir to a different level.
"if this hits 100 usd in 1 year or more, i will give the first and last comment 10,000"
If it breaks 26 it should go to 29 right? Any graph guys here?
this stock is struggling and I own 750 shares 
Get ready for a string of upgrades today and tomorrow now that the institutions are all in already
Nadaq selloff picking up steam. Great (sarcasm)
Oh this was wild. The worst is over. Reflection is coming. I'm still -23% but i'm confident about PLTR.
"Once the insiders with zero cost shares are done selling, which is today, the buying pressure will bring this back to 35 in a breathtaking manner!"
"For those panicking, here’s some solid advice to reduce your stress in the future:1. Do your DD and never invest because of advice you get from a friend, yahoo, or firms. 2. Distribute your money with diversification. You’re much better off investing about 25% of your portfolio in 3-4 ETFs (spread across 3-4 different sectors) + the remaining 75% into a variety of companies you believe in, preferably around 8-12, spread amongst multiple sectors of the economy.Gives you exposure to many different areas of growth but also minimizes, not eliminates, the odds of you waking up one day with half your money gone in the toilet.3. You only lose when you sell impatiently. Avoid emotional highs (where the market is doing great so you keep buying up everything) & emotional lows (omg it’s red= let me sell and cut my losses). 4. Read above: be patient. When the next man/woman panics, you buy."
positive please
"Palantir signed an important distribution deal with IBM (NYSE: IBM), which will integrate Palantir's offering into the IBM Cloud Pak, immediately increasing Palantir's distribution to 2,500 IBM enterprise salespeople all over the world -- a massive increase over Palantir's own capabilities.

5 a.m. and all i have is PLTR on my mind
I anticipate news tomorrow 7am
Wish I could buy in premarket these prices are a steel
"Can someone explain why this i dropping? Serious answers please. Contract after contract good report,and a great future ahead. Don’t understand?"
"Cathie just added another 460,300 shares."
might as well just buy all calls on this thing up to 100
Sell Sell Sell
"WOW. Huge open interest on 30 calls, expiring 2/26. Following Kathy is gonna cost some people a bundle if things don't turn around quick"
Not sure about anyone else but it seems very reassuring that the price stayed consistent around $25. This is a great base to build from and go up from here!
PLTR $100 BY END OF THIS YEAR 2021
and there we go again into red territory  am I the only one that have a big portion of the portfolio invested in but not worried at all about this dip?
Everyone on this board expects price to go down at lock up exp date! Market is counter intuitive. The shorts already depressed the price re: lock up the last 3 days. Now they just need to cover after Tuesday morning!
Buy asap !
When the institutions next report their holdings which will include A LOT of Palantir you will realize that on days like this (if you sell) you have been played. Relax and look at the big picture.
Going to moon today
"Backed up the truck at $24.5. Plan to hold three years. Then, we’re going to need a bigger truck(s). :). GLTA"
The nutty professor. Needs a good front man for pr.
"The market is dipping, not only PLTR, relax for the V shape lol. Believe in Cathie Wood."
$29 wall gone. $33 close could easily happen
Diamond hands
"AI competition just began w/ IBM's adaptation of Foundry...Will Oracle, MSFT follow? This is huge...huge for PLTR Stock."
"Anyone selling/writing covered calls here? I would like to generate some income with my PLTR holdings. I'm looking at April 1st expiration at $40. Premiums are currently too low but as the share price hopefully rises in the near term I hope to get a decent premium. My time frame is shorter than most of you so this strategy should work for me. If I'm assigned at $40.00, so be it. Looking at historical option prices premiums have been much higher over the last few weeks as the underlying share price was much higher. Hopefully our share price will move back to the 30's. What price premium appreciation could we expect, base on previous activity? Asking this to those who are considering a similar strategy. GLTA"
Why this stock is not moving forward at all :((
"Buy order went through at $28.10. Thank you. Next stop for me is $27.55 if you panic sellers bring it down further. Still way ahead. 30% annual growth projections for the next 5 years according to Karp. Ah, yeah."
That could be a good strategy! Lol
"Bloomberg reports “For the year, Palantir posted a first-ever operating profit, ending nearly two decades of sustained losses at the company. Annual adjusted operating income in 2020 was $190 million on revenue of $1.1 billion, the company said in a statement Tuesday. Each number exceeded analysts’ expectations. Palantir also issued a first-quarter sales growth forecast of 45%.”"
Every drop is a bonus.. every drop is like black FridayTake advantage and add more ￼ ￼
Thank God we’re not going to have to deal with all the lockup bs talk after this week. Finally people can talk about the long term future and not some meaningless short term insider sales.

I dont think the shorts will get enough sleep tonight knowing whats waiting for them
"23.36 $ resistance, if we break its down to 15-16$"
"Relax guys, this has to be fun and bring joy! Keep it that way"
Could this be the big purchase Peter Theil filed for? Maybe he put a buy order at $25 which is holding the stock there.
"I have said this before and will say again, it is all about waiting. Don’t worry for the flat days because it will take just 1 or 2 good days to reach 31 from 25. Look at the charts."
So let me sum this up . The insiders have the first chance to sell after 16 odd years and they are not doing that much at all and our friend Cathy is loading up . What direction do you guess this could go now ?
I believe PLTR will be $40-$50 next week. Bullish on PLTR.
"The irony here is shorts think that they have skills but are too obtuse to understand that brilliant a.i. machines on wall st created the bear market last few days. As fast as it goes down the same machines will reverse it. It’s a different game now. Human analytics are inferior. All the more reason Palantir prospers massively this decade. Fundamentally speaking, wow, what a company. And you know it, wall st knows it(though they will grapple with accepting it), hedge funds definitely know it, pension funds will get to know it more and more, quickly probably. Lock up schmockup. It will be pleasing to listen to Simon’s Sounds of Silence once this ephemeral storm blows over and the bears go back to their caves. Meanwhile the bulls will enjoy the sounds in their Catalonian Palaces. Lovely indeed. Winner. Cena de Pollo. Big"
Love you fammmm!!! Bring this stock to 200++Holding 964 shares!!!!Leggggo!!!!!!!!!!!
karp and cathy should make a baby
"Btw, Karp means Carp (fish) in Russian. ;-)"
rotation back to tech already unreal
Is that a Cup & Handle I see formulating ? 
"I'm ready for tomorrow !Release Foundry, Gotham , Apollo. Make the bleeding stop and get us a new contract worth billions."
Market testing lows again. Buy the dip when it drops below $25.
"It seems like when nasdaq falls by a little, palantir reflects a huge plummet. Anyone notice this?"
we protect.
"I would love to see $35-$37 end this week, albeit a really small pull back middle of the weekI am super bullish anyway"
"60 days away form 1Q +45% Revenue Growth. The second quarter, since going public, will hopefully reflect and validate the penetration into comercial business. In my opinion and watching PLTR for so long, the story gets stronger!!!"
"To be or not to be , that is the question . Tuesday when I wake up PLTR will be delivering music to my ears.Remember when Citron, MS, Sisi credit etc,etc call PLTR a casino ? Well,well,well, here we are looking at 40 pps .This is not a meme stock ! Release Tiberius !"
yes people were saying this will see 40 today looking at yesterday's AH action... NASDAQ sure gave a dose of reality!
Every day PLTR investors lose more money. Management is making millions.
If this was fastly the stock would be up 50
"i am really worried i bought some days before and now the price is going down, can i hold it ?"
Premarket means nothing
you should have bought the banks. much easier less stress ful ride.
"AMAZON, IBM, MMM, GOVERNEMTN, EVERYNE, SOON AAPL!!!! BUT LETS SELL!!! KEKW"
Today is the day we start moving upwards again
Thank you to my homies at WallStreetBets...?
Hope y’all bought the dip. We’re green for launch. 
"United kingdom, Iran, Russia, China... Are loading more and more nuclear weapons, countries are leaving the nuclear agreement, and soon it is very possible to see a war and Palantir will be very important in this case!"
this stock is a smart choice ........if you want to make money with little risk.......i would not be surprised if we are at $ 60 at year end.......do you d/d.......this ceo is sharp.......joey
Cathys buying more let’s ride
this stock actd weird...wpuldnt be surprised it has a manic gap up tomorrow
9% down on lock-up expiration and 15% up the very next day....seems the sky did not fall like the shorties hoped.
"oh boy, heading back to 10"
ARK just bought 1.5 million shares!
"BUY THE DIPPPP!!! AGHHH!! Also picked up some Palantir merch toda, thought I would share in case anyone else wants something!  https://stockjunkies.ca/collections/palantir-pltr"

"I wonder what you expected when the CFO selling close to 1mio shares from 24$ to $29...if an insider is doing this, all others will do the same coming out of no sell timeline. This stock will go down before it goes up. Don`t average down yet. wait at least 2 consecutive days of green and then load the boat..."
To bearish investors
It's important to understand that Ark Invest has access to information most of us don't.
Increased my position to 27%. I hope I'm not making a huge mistake not going all in on this stock. It's really enticing but I have to stay disciplined
Palantir needs to ink a HUGE Military contract.
Any thoughts on why it’s in this price range the entire day?

Here is the bottom line with this company. You buy at any price. And 5 years later you have no idea what you just did. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS
S&P is flat PLTR is down 4.4% what if tomorrow S&P is down 4% ? It looks like company executive are still selling big chunk of their holdings. I was lucky selling all shares this morning. Good Luck PLTR bulls
7 of the last 10 days have been red. We need some news or something to pick this stock back up. Bullish but it's getting annoying.
Buy this now or go buy something else you heard PLTR will do well in the future
"This is a great company to hold. Just wait, that’s how buffet made all his money"
PLTR is GME 2.0
"Folks, enjoy riding up this unique record-hitting stock which is guaranteed above 100 in ️️️️！"
Tech sell off is over done.
35-40 dollar price target by Friday.
"Cathie woods load up again today $ 35,000,000 more pltr."
"So, this guy told me that they will release news about a really big contract... I'm not sure if this info is correct but.. Well I might believe."
Order 26.66 will it get there today ?
Got 1 30 call expiring today. Come on PLTR!
All I got to say is :Come on PLTR give them the bejesus !
This stock will get to 200$ a share one day watch 
"This is where the real investors are separated from the wannabe “investors”.Anybody can look like a genius while buying stocks as the entire market is doing exceptionally well, NOW is when you really see who knows what they’re doing.It’s been a bloodbath in tech since feb 9th-10th.Everybody is panicking. People are selling to secure profits. THIS is where you are expected to sell, but if history tells you anything: it’s that emotional highs & lows are a bad thing.Nobody likes to wake up day after day and see they lost unrealized gains, I feel the same way, I’ve lost many MANY unrealized gains in tech since that date, but patience is crucial.Put your portfolio/phone away for a week or two, go outside and do something, and reevaluate later.Don’t do something dumb today because you’re on a emotional low and don’t see the light . The market generally grows. Be patient"
Ooppsss... it’s green already LOL
I was expecting to see $32-33 by now - Not Good!
This is testing my patience. Lol
Durning the last earnings report some pretty wild claims were made... 30% growth every year for 5 years.... if they hit this target everyone invested will make very nice gains... if they miss these targets but continue yearly billion dollar compensation then us investors are in trouble
Giddy-up Horsy!!!!The wheels on the bus go round and round....Do I need to give you a Scooby snack to go over $24?or maybe some LUBE to keep it up?
OMG Palantir is likely to explode towards $ 30 today. The upward trend looks bullish plus new great collaboration
New institutional investments today

Watch the PLTR news at 3:30pm...
All I need for my new Florida home is PLTR to reach 50 -- is that too much to ask? :)
In 2-3week we will see 40-45 $
I predict a huge announcement of a new HUGE client in the near future. I also predict some of you will be paying $52 a share instead of $26.
I drank the liquids. When do we take off to meet the SPACESHIP?
Added PLTR this morning. GL guys!
Told you PLTR is going to soar up!
Buy and Hold!
does anyone have that problem when they sell it will fly? if you do can you sell? thanks.
is everyone here comfortable with the float?
*don’t you know pump it up* starts to play. Green here we come! 
"I have a feeling this is that phenomena in the stock market where, since everyone anticipates the stock to sell off, either because of lockup expiration or the ""stock has gone up too much. It's up x% this year!"", it'll only continue to go higher; leaving all the naysayers and non-believers behind. A selloff after a lockup expiration is not a sure thing. The stock selling off heading into earnings does not determine the move of the stock post-earnings either. Bears and short-term bulls are bearish. This makes me bullish, lol. Long 5,400 shares at $33.45."
$27 coming soon
"You don't day trade palantir, accumulate."
Keep selling guys
"The sentiment is negative on this board, therefore, the stock will continue to tank. Sell"
"I’m all in, way more than I should. 30% of my portfolio!"
"""Palantir said it has entered into a six-year strategic partnership with French automotive supplier Faurecia"" What is meant by ""strategic partnership?This how customer-supplier relationships are defined? what do you think?"
Let's have a good laugh !!!
"I'm comfortable with a wide range of earnings outcomes. I'm long term. If it's upbeat, nice. If it's dissapointing, I look for the right opportunity to add shares. I own this. I don't trade it."
"$PLTR should rally Thursday with boost from the $BUZZ ipo, along with short squeeze from reddit and wall street bets."
Add 2500 shares .
"Palantir owns the future of data analytics and beyond. We only get to see what they show us. What other disruptive and ground-breaking initiatives are in the works? Palantir is like $CRWD $AMZN $GOOGL $AAPL $FB $CRM $FSLR ...buy it, put it in a drawer, then open it in 5 years. You're welcome."
"If you didn't sell when it hit $45, it's because you thought it was worth more. Why would any one sell now?Investors always win. (ups and downs are part of the game) Gamblers always lose. FACT"

"Tomorrow will be interesting! For both sides... The stronger will win... I hope it ends green!My target price is 48 dollars a share! But, I also believe that we will see that after 1Q. We will see this company becoming profitable for the first time! Don't lose your faith!"
"Credit Suisse downgrading PLTR and then buying $200m worth of shares on 12/31 is a tell tale sign that retail traders are not in control. In the last week PLTR institutional ownership increased from 12% to 20%. Follow what the hedge funds do, not what they say. What you think the ER is going to look like doesn’t matter. But what the hedge funds think it’s going to look like does matter."
Nothing is happening with palantir. Tech and growth stocks under pressure with rising bonds. You dont likey what i say? In that case. Palantir just came out with a new program called metropolis. It's to combat the highly speculative news on facebook and twitter. They're going to data mine internet companies and capture ad revenue from B2B and B2G. They'll be working with high profile clients from bill gates and warren buffet to master the their metropolis platform and integrate gamma mechanics into their new metropolis ecosystem. This should give you some bulls to think about and make sure to buy more shares.
Cratering wahoo. Just when I buy
"25.20 ceiling, if broken, we will go to 25.45"
close above 26.55 today
Wow up today. What a surprise .
Cramer said he's not a buyer of Palantir. Cramer also said not to buy SNAP a few years ago. I did not listen to him on SNAP and made a fortune. I also am ignoring him on Palantir and except to have another multi bagger!!
"I like how they are investing aggressively now and for the future. Their outlook isn't short term, they have high growth potential, great team working and in a very high growth industry. In the 100-200 range next couple years"
Ouch
Red Monday it’s coming. Read walletinvestor forecast.. sell and buy Thursday.
Palantir will be $45 next week. Who's with me?

Saw the CEO on CNBC today. I really liked the guy and I am glad that I am a shareholder in PLTR. It was a great interview.

"I don’t care if pltr drops down to 1$ I’ll just buy more! I’m long btw, did I mention I’m long? I’m gonna buy and check back in 10 years when the stock is 5000$ minimum.

Where are all the troll haters today? Ramses hello???
"just bought in 200 shares 26.75, for long term"
"I really believe in the success of this company, no matter what .. this stock will be the big winner of 2021 and maybe of the decade. Lock up sale one day will be over. Stock at the moment is still undervalued. LONG ALL IN PALANTIR ;)"
"this is def a discount, 30 tomorrow"
"will go to maybe 22.50, then that will be the last time to get it that cheap ever again, will be 50$ by the end of the year,"
"nice!, running up for open"
"Still love the company, but not good that $25 support just broke."
Am I Warren buffet? No. Am I up 253% this current year? Yes.How? Patience 
Any Guesses? will PLTR open on Monday premarket higher than $30 or lower?
Pump that volume up!!!
"Everyone, mark my words. Palantir will be the future of tech. No pump"
"If you're a long term - 5 to 10 year horizon - investor it wont matter if you buy it at 20 or 10. This is a 100 stock in 5 years. Do your research, their tech is way ahead of all their competitors. The coming data tsunami and the need to analyze the data will make PLTR the #1 analytics company in the world. And we havent even addressed the need to analyze logs to identify trails of hackers attacking Western companies/govts. Buy so you average down. But do your research."
Palantir rising war in the garden of Google. A must read on SeekingAlpha
CNBC:”JPMorgan invests in private stock trading venue with Palantir link amid demand for pre-IPO shares”
"Bought the dip again, love the stock"
why is the market open early today
Crameer's own words before he was big public figure for stock forecasting were that he lied to get people to invest and manipulate stock movement. Nothing novel as that is how market makers/movers work the retail investors. With Palantir you have senior management encouraging long term holds. These guys are the real deal.
60 per share at the end of the year
150% of average volume in the first hour.
Q1 2021 in profit
"Buy at 10 no buy now, going to 40 no will be 50 soon.. Dont be a gambler, be an investor."
"Doesn’t matter the fluctuation of these days. Palantir will be $100 in a year. 03.2022: Palantir will be $100. If the price goes below $20 and after pop up to $30 it’s egal. I mean longs always wins. It’s all about statistics my friends. Buy as much as you afford and if you don’t need the money in next year, jackpot. Good luck everyone."
Alex Karp came off as arrogant. I do not understand how Karp criticizing Silicon valley executives is going to help Palantir investors. The stock price took a dive after his interview. I am disappointed.
Seems like everyone and there mother is a seller while the buyers are nowhere to be found. Where have they gone I don't see them anywhere?
Everything will be fine. Just wait and let the management come back from Europe from skis. Ha ha.
I THINK I should keep buying more pltr for long term because: They have tons of long contracts with many large cap companies and I believe in 10 years from now this will be added the the S&P500 and be also added to FAANGM I TRULY believe faangm will turn into MAPFANG the p got Palantir of course
is the AWS partnership priced in?
hoping the stimulus package contains a big contract for Palantir.
I am so glad I was able to buy more shares at $20.90 today.
I personally think that we will turn green after the market opens!
"Amazing how Thiel, Sankar, and Cohen tanked their own company by dumping shares. When your leadership doesn't have confidence in their own company, neither will the worker bees. Hence, the insider sell off. This is officially a Zombie Stock."
"Now is the best time to buy PLTR, just do it buy now ."
karp and cathy wood needs get married
I now have 11K Shares Will Hold - I hope this works out
I am planning to invest in PLTR stock but not sure at what price range I should start my position. Any suggestion will be helpful..
Do we see $22 or $21? WOW!!
Any hope of 25$ today ?
This administration is a disaster for the stock market.
"PLTR will break $50 a share easy by the end of the year. No other company in the world can do what PLTR is doing today never mind tomorrow. Welcome to the TESLA of data mining, analytics, and cyber security."
"10Y back up to 1.565 and rising, market betting on a hot CPI print. You know exactly what that means."
In with 1300 WOW Very happy!
...20% up by end of today...
I like how bears here(we kbow thw names) try to convince about the prices. They could solve the market in 5 min
$509.00We will sell it in 2031
"The Motley Fool is a big cheerleader for PLTR, must have quite a few shares"
"APRIL 14th is the day to watch.Watch what happened the week ahead of demo day 1/21, from $23 to $45 We are building a base for the big rocket "
would we see 45 again by the end of a month?
"For those newbies reading all the BS on this board about PLTR reaching ""$100 by EOY"" and $400 next year and comparing it to Google, Microsoft, etc., do your research, its BS. If you're willing to lock up your money for decades (especially with the monster float on this stock), you have shot...if PLTR performs. And again, for comparison purposes, lets look at how long it took for two giants to reach their loft valuations (and yes both have massive profits. This could indeed be the next Google, but it also could be the next Enron. You'll have to lock up your money for years to find out.GoogleSept 2004 $50April 2005 $100April 2009 $200Oct 2013 $500Oct 2017 $1000Current $1800MicrosoftMay 1986. 12 centsDec 1996 $10Nov 2012 $26June 2018 $98Current $231"
Gonna finish green
I rembember times when PLTR used to rocket every time they announced partnership :D
another thing people need to understand is once several big corporations and governments jump on board this other private corporations will notice the positive side of having palantir on their side to help their business. they will have to use palantir to keep up with competition. it's kind of like the EV market right now everybody knows in the automobile industry that electric cars are the future so the first guy that starts the new EV cars I'm going to be the ones on in the front burner. if they don't keep up if competition does not keep up with their competitors they will lose out same thing is happening with palantir there will be forced to use their services because volunteers competition is out of their league
"10 y Bond 1,72 right now. Support 24,30 can be broken today and later come to $20 - Head and Shoulders line. Healthy correction needed under $20, preferably under $15, where it can be attractive."
"just bought 27 shares, not much but i hope it helps"
"PLTR is a durable company establishing a competitive advantage with bread and butter connections to the government producing IP that can be turned on the public providing almost monopolistic goods and services well into the future. This is a company to invest in as it invests in itself. Trading this stock isn't likely the best strategy but holding it for the long term provides the highest probability of outperformance. I bought this stock to own a piece of a company not to daily count the sheckles in my brokerage account. Patience pays!! If you bought a house would you worry about how much that house is worth the day, week, month or years after closing? Of course not because you bought with the intention of holding that property for a long time. If you bought into a franchise you can ask the same question. I am personally excited to own a piece of a company that could be the next google or amazon.https://youtu.be/uC2UZ4PxRWk"
"When Nasdaq will recover, I cannot imagine how fast this can go up. Whole tech market is just holding this bull. Who's with me!?"
Remember when I sold my shares thinking JP will say bad news but instead the opposite happened. Lesson learned: NEVER SELL OR YOU WILL REGRET IT!

Palantir new business with IBM starts in 14 days from now. Tell me where PLTR's revenue will be thereafter? How high will PLTR rise after another cloud enters business w/ Foundry???
"A lot of smart tech people love this stock, love this concept, love it's notion of stretching AI toward it's valuable and obvious future direction to benefit the planet. This should offer short, mid term and long term growth for us."
maybe in ah it will go positive
ALL the major indices are down and sinking further.Palantir will rebound BIG time.

PLTR to Titan! 
Is seems like most of the rise happens overnight. Thoughts on buying before close to hold overnight?
"I was just reading a comment made by Jim Cramer that im really not sure what he means. He said,"" PLTR is a black box "". And therefore would not recommend it. Does that mean the company isn't transparent? I think that is what is means. For the record im bullish on the company and would like everyone's thoughts. Thank you in advance."
pltr to be 100 ???? yeah right this stock is a joke!

Paresh working hard today
20 is coming soon... What i told you???
the options are getting heavily discounted
TESLA announcement soon
hello your friend Tesla is up 16bpercent so hurry up or else you lose your firend.
IM HERE! PLTR is doomed ! I bought in today at 29.24 . Every stock I buy gets crushed after I buy it! It will never go above my buy price as long as I am holding it . It's 100 % guaranteed!
Above 30??
I can realistically see a $30+ close today.
Buying back at $22
"Companies are going to look to save money, they'll use or partner with PLTR to make that happen. Stay with this and you will make your money back and a lot more."
"Goldman sachs upgraded to ""buy"" with a PT at $34, this stock should be in the 50s or 60s logically..."
"guy chill out, this is a correction we in, hold your position and add if you have funds and believe in the company. pltr or anything else. "
what's you price target for PLTR
I am getting in on Monday. This may be a good one long-term.
Just hit 1000 shares! This stock is gonna be big long term!!!
I'm dropping $2k in this thing tomorrow because all you people praying to break even has to mean something with the man up stairs & it has to go up I hope.
Doesn't take a genius to realize if it's holding on a day like today.... this is the floor
News every week. They can't keep this low forever haha.
Going up after that sleepy speech.
I ain't playing around. I sold most my stuff and made this 50% of my portfolio. Belive in Cathy woods and the hype
"I just have to laugh at myself!!  live and learn, sell when it’s in the green!"
god please save me..
"Although PLTR is my single largest position with an 8% weighting, I don't even look at it anymore...don't need to. Just knowing that I'm early and it will continue to grow is all I need to sleep at night. fyi... $GBTC is number two in my portfolio. Another one I don't need to watch and feet over. I'll start wringing my hands when $GBTC hits 1200."
Roblox stock market dip. Sell your shares cheap and chase that scam. So disappointed with their misrepresentation of a DPO.
Should you believe in Cramer and hedgefund? Do you think they would want you to make profit? I just believe in my own research.
This is too cheap when we look back @100+ later! 
"The company had a pretty good year with 47% YoY Revenue growth for full-year 2020 and expects that growth to be bigger than 30% for 2021. Data is slowly becoming the most valuable commodity on the planet and Palantir is exactly where it needs to be to take advantage of that. Data collecting and analyzing isn't going to slow down in the years to come, it's only going to accelerate. And that's why Palantir is going to win and win big."
"the whole market down but we're still up nearly 2%just imagine when the market recover, how much we can reach :D"
another day another 2k of my investment gone..
PLTR: What a bargain price for such great company. May never see price this low again.
Broken 25
Whoever is judging Palantir by their current earnings is making a huge mistake. This company is in a space where there is no competition and they will be printing money in the future. Data mining using AI technologies is the future.
Be careful at the last 30 minutes of trading. Seems as if it slides down. Look at the 5 day chart. You’ll see a slide that happens every day. I’m in at 300 shares at $28.54. Holding. This is great software. I’ve used a small part of it.
"ARK Invest adds more Palantir sharesMar. 04, 2021 10:33 AM ETPalantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR)By: Kim Khan, SA News Editor8 CommentsARK Investment Management added more than 2.6M more shares of Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) +1.1% yesterday."
"The world's only stock that needs a multi-million dollar new business win each day to close green, lol. Until one day soon, it will be all green."
I love the days where shorts come out of the woodwork on this board. It makes it easy to know who to mute.
Whats a good entry point??? I missed the boat at $21
EOD dump like yesterday?
I do not know about anyone else but I am looking forward to Wilfred’s interview with Alex Karp today.
Tesla is up almost 20% today...Any particular reason why?
"Being one of the only positive stocks yesterday shows the commitment of investors, amazing!!! GLTA!!"
so i really did miss out on 22$
You really think most insiders would sell after the lockup when the stock already corrected? Most insiders probably know it’s already at a value price. You’d think that will make it harder for them to sell
Can someone please explain to me the problem with Palantir?? They literally beat earnings estimate every quarter by A LOT . So what is everyone’s deal here??? What’s with the sell rating and the drop? What’s wrong with people?
"If you dont trust Alex Karp and his team to work on your $, dont buy.I have done my research and I like what I am seeing."
340 shares 
Added shares!!!
Like I said you should have bought
"This time, WSB finally found the real deal instead of GME!let’s squeeze short big together!"
Calling a 29.76 close on friday.
"People that panic sell on a day like this where the entire market is red, deserve to lose money .Oh yeah let me panic sell because PLTR is down 2-3% on a day where some stocks are down 10%, yup that totally makes sense"
keep those hands steady
They said I was wrong to buy April 16th...$20 Calls....
"Whoa, pre-markets are sliding! Doesn’t look good for tomorrow!"
I'm adding more if there is any dips this week. 50k ready
everyone tripping on this lockup dip. nothing changed about the company and its future. all those selling just giving institutions and us long-term investors a gift. thank you paper handed peeps
It's a tug of war so far
I tell people to buy PLTR before it get to 108. Thumbs up  if you buy.
I don’t claim to be a PLTR expert but it seems this is the new Tesla stock. I’ve bought calls to see what happens.
"I was not expecting 30 today like many other posters were writing. I was looking for it to hold 25 or 26 though. As it turns out, we are or about to go red 40 minutes into trading..."
My sources tell me: PLTR is going To The Moon!!!
well im glad I didn't sell. thanks for the free advice.
"I’m going on record. I believe we see $50 by close on market on March 5th at the latest.Institutional ownership rose 8-9% in the last couple of weeks during the shale from ATH at $45.. That’s lot of accumulation in a short period of time all while keeping the stock at bay... Paper hands got shook out good...And rest assured there’s a whole slew of other institutions who aren’t as big of risk takers but are watching very closely to say if we deliver and potentially exceed our 1st public quarter guidance since direct listing. This is the 1st show me quarter after our come out statements. Institutions like to see a habit of beating guidance. Let’s be clear. We’re going to exceed and post our first ever profitable year. For some context:Tesla gained 700% since first reporting profitabilityAmazon gained 25,000% since first reporting profitabilitySee you March 5th for a check in :)#notallthatisgoldglitters"
ark got a lot. this is going to go back up easy
"There’s a rumour on Stocktwits that they are selling data to hedge funds who are shorting stocks with high levels of bullish sentiments so now everyone is tagging bearish on purpose to trick the algorithm. Should we try it here too? Haha On that note, pltr to £100"
$50 coming soon
Cathie Wood says Karp speaks their language and they're playing in a huge space...
"Cramer mentions absolutely nothing about the revenue beats. Q1 2019 revenue was $146m, we will start the year off $350m, passing 100% growth in 24 months (and starting Sept 2020 non government sector began to understand the platforms)."
Tmr will be the last chance to buy. While everyone figure out during weekend. Monday is going to the moon!
My goal is to get to 1k shares and it’s days like this that keeps making it easy
Why its up guys ?? Any news ??
Selling my oil stocks which have tons more room to go up to buy this dip. Might need to sell my wife next.
50+ in 2 weeks. Easy.
something big about to happen !
Slow and steady.
Why is this stuck?? And Tsla goes up by $118 in a day!!!...I'm having no luck with investing.
Wooow.... How a partnership with amazon leads this so down!
Today! Pré market should be over 8%!
"Palantirs revolutionary AI software will be lead top tier companies to modernized their existing hardware/software and thus allow PLTR additional growth. I wouldn't be surprised if PLTR is a major household name within the next 5 years. At the current rate of expansion, PLTR software will be used for every major industry and political governance. Big Brother tech at its finest."
This stock is a tremendous machine. 10Y broke 1.635 and it continues to go up!
Really? goes down 1.25 recovers .11?
We will close around $28 today

Since the insider unlock the air has really come out of this one. It's clearly outpacing demand. But one question: do all those shares now added to the float actually count to dilute earnings?
Palantir and Faurecia Embark on Long-Term Strategic Partnership#PLTR
We're proud to team up with AWS this baby will go to the moon.
up from here folks.
"If you’re in a long position, what are you worried about. I haven’t even looked at my gains on this in weeks. This is an easy set and forget it!"
Cathie found some change in her car's ashtray and bought another 145K shares. ARKW is almost at 5 Million shares. Will she push to it to 7.5 like ARKK?
with all the anticipation of a dip following lockup - why do you think Thiel's Hedge fund Mithril AP filed to buy some 180 million worth of shares? see you on the moon
why didnt I buy @ 21.00 last week :(
Thinking of selling my 2000 shares of AT&T and put them in Palantir. Thumbs up if you agree
Hold this stock & don’t look at it for another 5 years
Get ready longs
This market has so many IPO's and over valued stocks with little revenue. Palantir is exponentially gaining revenue with new contracts . Buy the dip and Hold
This stock is probably the safest stock to have your money in today (aside from large blue chip stocks).
I am all in @25.96$Can you also please put comments on what prices you got in? thanks
I can see your cards!
AMC about to break out gone green
Let the good times roll
$PLTR - rumorWall street bets hype about doubling PLTR.Need to watch if volume pours in.Possible 20-100% run
Did my DD and will be getting in tomorrow morning hopefully under 28$
Game-afication of stock trades huh? Wallstreet invented that with short/algo attacks. look at the ladder down in the last hour. :)
I actually purchased Software from Palantir and used it to aggregate/analyze the data from the price action and the consensus is that it’s going to the moon
"The Palantir says, ""Buy now or pay a lot more in 2022."""
my 1st cousin bought an apple and i am buying a palantire'
"ALL IN PALANTIR.Truly believe in the success of this company.Fasten your seatbelts, tomorrow we will start our journey. Enjoy ;)"

TEXAS POWER GRID CONTRACT IN A WEEK........
Let’s take this to $200 like we did GME. No reason why we shouldn’t....or couldn’t. Just have to work TOGETHER.
Added another 9k shares !!! To the moon we go !!
"LlOL. A replay of yesterday. Uo premarket, but will be down again once insiders ump their shares. Red by 10. Longs, please stay away from sharp utensils and open windows today."
this thing moves like a Toyota Corolla offroading
"No competition, many government contracts...this is just starting...this tech stock will be at least 1500+ in 3-5 years....look at other unique tech stocks where they r now..."
Back to $40
wish pltr stock going to up 20% + on Tuesday
let's close green 
Been watching this stock for awhile. Finally pulled the trigger. Long 500 at 22.33. GL all
$26 today!!!!!!!!!
Bought 2k more yaaaayyy
Today marks the final end of the Cult of Palantir.
Up after hours. We’ll see how tomorrow goes.
"guys be real... its extremely unlikely that the price will rise in the coming days. im long, sold my position with a broken heart and waiting for a re entry. No sane institution or retail would buy before seeing if theres going to be lockup volatility. Stop denying the fact that this might happen and stop bashing the stock aswell. This stock is a winner 100% but for a few days it will drop a bit and its normal. im buying back in next week. PS Cathie Woods can stomac the drops and she probably has multiple buyin prices. She's in for a forseeable long run. if you're not, you should not follow the moves of someone who doesnt have the same timeline, it just doesnt make sense. can't wait to be back in ! next week should be exciting"
$28 by March 20th
40$ very soon
30 by the end of next week
"CASH GENERATION MONSTER:PLTR basically has NO DEBT! Almost 90% of Assets are LIQUID (which grew 50% since 12-31-2019). The company has projected a very conservative guidance of $4B in Rev by 2025. So, if it grows $600m in cash with $1B in Rev, what will it generate with $4B?"
Yahoo boards are driving the markets since decades now! LOL
Above $25 at close...
Is PLTR going to be next stock craze???
26.20 was yesterday's ceiling. We can break that today and are currently poised to do so. I say we close between 26.65 and 28
Have a wonderful day longs and enjoy the coming...
Holding the support at 22.5 real nice. Things will be higher soon. Option call of Apr 18 at $65 strike is huge. This will go higher and higher very soon. Just be patients longs.
"“Come with me, if you want to live”I love Palantir!!!! I will buy more PLTR."
"This is not my style but that being said.....This is going to the Moon.Congrats to all long term holders, enjoy the ride."
"Over the past 3 months, $28.60 has been the biggest resistance/support barrier."
Green green and more green
should i buy it from 26 $ ? any thoughts ?

"Have a multi-thousand load near IPO price, but will add more if it drops to $25 on expire. Thank you for selling, i gladly take your shares."
"If you haven't figured out this game yet then this is another clear example of manipulation in order to get in at a lower price before the earnings release. Don't get suckered in and sell, in the hope that you can get back in a lower price.It doesn't take much work to figure out how many new contracts Palantir secured in this quarter and I would be surprised if they didn't have some interesting news to reveal aswell.Remember who the management and founders are. The best in the business.Price target of $44 after earnings."
I’m muting all the bot trolls
"Keep running from the fire! I’m looking to free up any amount of cash possible to continue to take advantage of this gift. For the record, I believe anything below $30 is a huge gift. If not for market factors we should have never retraced below that number with the IBM partnership, Q4 Earnings, 3M expansion, ARKK, Vanguard and funds adding in truck loads. Don’t care what price you grab it’ll be considered a solid trade within 60 days of the market correcting. This is sprung tight with new investors and many who are holding from higher prices.If you’re scared, sit on the sidelines but know you’ll be full of envy when many add 20-100% to their positions at these ranges.I’m not a perfect investor. Bought here at $10, added at nearly every price from $10 to $37 and have added at nearly every price from $37 down to $24. Know and believe in what you hold. If in doubt REVISIT your DD. It’s one of the easiest companies to research and if you’re savvy enough you will look beyond just the company headlines."
"don't sell, let it grow"
lol ceo say shet so they can buy calls
"The question is how much pltr does Cathie have now I guess around 100 million dollars worth, anyone with up date would be helpful"
So tired of seeing red sold my average of 32.20 today for 24.30. So relieved got out before this hits the teens.

the big day is coming 50$ up

"I never understood the correlation of Pltr to Gamestop, a video gaming store. It's like linking in palantir to Starbucks or Deere or Victorias secret. Mash potatoes and ice cream...."
is pltr merger with amazon would be so great for amazon
When the shorts realize theres no more profit to be made this will start climbing quicker
"Well, well look who woke up"
4K shares since the IPO holding strong. No plan to sell for the next 18 months! 
Is this stock going to take off this week orbit it another 25-27 week ?
it appears nobody is sellling expect the insiders. get out this stock before u get gut. this stock is heavily invested by foreign retailers any stock with such high numbers of foreign investment is bound to get gut for the short term. u didnt think they gona allow those outside money double. dont get caught up in the mix. last chance out.
This stock is hanging in there trying to climb every little bit.
"Palantir doesn't hire/employ hourly workers. These are well paid...well above average earners. They don't need the cash. Expect the lock up expiry to be a big, scary nobody sells quality at a bargain."
Glad I doubled @22 lmfao let's go
"This stock was $32 last Friday, its still up compared to a week ago. Chill out everybody. This is not some kind of sports bet, this is solid and promising company. Relax, stay long and enjoy the ride up. "
This will be 5% core holding in my portfolio until I retire.
Lets get $26
I'm not joking when I say this is a 1000 dollar stock.....
Stay long and strong Palantirians!!!!!!!
Cathy Wood will be on CNBC after commercial break.
"I think the problem is that we all know in the long run this will pay off, but what hurts us is that we’re not able to profit the green stocks while holding throught those rough days"
How long before this stock sees £38 again?honest answer please
Got my 1 share today for $24.61. Not a bad price.
Time for real value companies with low P / E. Enormous value bubble shares with P / E will burn.

"My fellow PLTR believers,I could have sold my beautiful PLTR shares for a nice profit:1. March-01-2021: $25.902. March-10-2021: $26.243. March-12-2021: $26.924. March-15-2021: $27.475. Should I be depressed? Sad? Feel down because I have missed at least 4 awesome opportunities to sell?6. Should I be listening to my DEEP INSTICTS when my Combustion engine = heart + head = Telling me to Sell High and Buy Low?7. These are the emotions of many PLTR investors...8. However, investing is like religion: We all say we believe in GOD, but the truth is that we all don't know how to describe this GOD and we just repeat the same ""empty?"" statement: Just Believe in God... you will go to heaven...9. My heaven = PLTR = $50Peace!"
"Most of the stocks today fallen by 5-15% today including $tsla $amzn and $aapl. So no worries, it is going to go back to $30 when the market turn to normal. Take a break..."
Its going down to $15 soon.
"The most bullish reasons for investing into PLTR right now: 1. dropped 50% in the last three weeks. 2. Share lockup is over and done with. 3.meme stock, but a great one, like apple/TeslaI’ll send you all a postcard from my yacht once we hit $420.69"
i guess its 50 50 but i hope we see some more buying on monday and not the speculative buying
"one thing is sure bros, shorts made a fortune and then they will be buying stocks with longs money !! lol!!!"
how is palantir teaming up with amazon not on the main news!!!
This little dip won't last.
Been buying dips for 2 weeks straight. I’m ready.
Congrats lings! This will make FOUR straight days in the red. Had enough?
No reason why SNOW is valued at 30 billion more market cap. PLTR makes more money and is closer to being profitable. Wall Street games....
Yessss Based on charts We will fly to 50$
https://www.palantir.com/solutions/cyber/
We are surpassing ️️ soon!
Btw has anyone seen apple job advert in london requiring Palantir experience in key qualifications?
I was in with hype and average down to 26 now with 3000 shares believed in this stock/ company Will Green back sooner than you expected 
Most people believe that today is another red day for tech. Hope market suprises us with green!
You guys are buying because Cathie Woods bought and hoping it will skyrocket now. While Cathie Woods would love to see it drop below $20 so she can buy more. Nothing is going to make this skyrocket until we get a powerful ER.
ALL HAIL PLTR
lord of the rings iv starts at 24...its the story
what a #$%$! didn't even recovery yesterday loss and keep dropping..
Down 30% in 2 days...happens very time I buy!!!!!
I guess no one likes this company anymore after yesterday
It's a bad sign when insiders are selling every share they own for whatever they can get for it.
"Wish I could see the faces of weak hands selling this week, next month. It's going to be hilarious."
"I think long term this stock definitely goes up,. but there's far too many calls this Friday for this to break out this week. I'd be super impressed & broke lol if it skyrockets tomorrow. May the odds be forever in your favor. :D"
The never green stock
BUY BUY BUY!!!!
"lol, 100mil in one hour, I bet the volume today will be greater than yesterday"
"Investing in PLTR is an investment in the American Empire and its tip tier companies. Look at it this way, having America and its top tier companies succeeding by using PLTR's tech will lead to PLTR'S success and overall profitability. New investors only want a quick profit, bash the company when it's down to the overall market being down, and don't understand the fundamentals of the company. Buy the company and watch it grow for years to come. PLTR as a whole is fundamentally strong and can prosper in a slow economy, booming economy, and even in a wartime economy."
This is a manufactured sell off!! big boys are getting in before the open watch this pop today
"Sleeping Bulll, all aboard as soon as you can"
Great dip buying opportunity when nothing fundamentally wrong with the company and ceiling is at $45
I came on here 10 days ago and recommended AMC theatres. In that time AMC has gone from 11 to 14 while PLTR has been stagnant. PLTR is a great company but all of these huge 2021 runup stocks are taking a break - and it going to be for a little while before they are back in favor. Come read the AMC forum to see why this is about the best play in the market now. The proof is in the pudding there. Cheers!
"Cramer is always been jealous, he’s going to be eating his words very soon "
Karps says he has MORE things to worry about than peeps complaining about the share price. He says NOBODY is forcing you to buy PLTR.
i own 8000 shares at 24. Will sell at 50
Off to a good start
Cathie pumps tesla endlessly but little to PLTR. .....Marcia Marcia Marcia!!
Ark bought 50 million shares. The market ran out of shares to sell.
If no one sells it could be $1000 by March. Just don't sell no matter what!!
"What's the main reason why their IPO was below $10/share, and now they're $25, and were just in the mid-$30s, even $40? Are they worth 3-5x what they were worth 5 months ago?"
"2 years time, palantir will be in the S&P500."
"I have 7000 shares at 24.25 , what yo do?"
It's time for me to load up on calls here.
15 min. passed with 48Mn volume....party's not even started...yet...
yeah boyyyyy!!!!! broke 27
"Amazing how some pumpers on this board are constantly talking through their sphincter about what’s going to happen with this stock. HOD at the close! 50 by next week! 1000 in three years! Yeesh. They annoy me almost as much as the shorts, and I own 15,000 shares."
This is going to the moon! 
"1,560,200 shares were purchased today via ARKW, not ARKK, confusing a lot of people, W is part of their five actively managed ETFs, soon to be six, with the space ARKX launching next month."
Picked up a couple hundred. I think we’re gonna head back up tomorrow
"All what PLTR talks about is long term strategy. In order to reinvest in PLTR, We need to see short term strategy that will generate revenue within the quarter. Investors want return on their money today, not in 5 years."
When this will hit 100-200 bucks i am going to become a palantir millionaire
Thanks Powell :(
$PLTR Sell if it get back to $30 $NIO sell if it get back to $50
I'm scared
..when the Reverse Split?..
Look at Balance Sheets! Cash grew $1.4b to $2.1b. 50% change from 2019.
Every thing is collapsing but PLTR is holding strong.
I guess I get to take a break from reassuring people in here. Take it away boys 
https://youtu.be/c8KkCfvLcy8
sold nio . made good profit . throwing it all in PLTR . LONGTERM HOLD !!
Palantir why you doing this
Always best to invest early in a monopoly. Palantir's pricing power will leave us in awe.
"Only buy and hold , same with calls buy calls only for one year at least"
"Just need one green day, so my wife won't divorce me pls"
$50 by april wow
$30 before Friday
shorts working overtime this weekend.
I feel sorry for those who bought this for a quick buck. This is a long term stock.
"It's nice to have the function of a mute button. All these bots making claims, only a bought vessel of interest would make, needs to be put away. It's all gibberish from script to fearmonger.Also, to green days in a row? Early in the week? Another beer seems to be in place. As some say in Sweden.""Fira med Bira""-celebrate with beer"
It is hard to changing from bull to bear. I finally faced reality and sold yesterday @27. I will establish short position from today based on its actual performance instead of bubble dream. It will be under 20 soon.
LET ME SAY THIS WITH FAITH AND HOPE : TO THE MOON!!!!!!!
Bruh! Roblox is a 45 dollars a share! This is a joke!
Come on PLTR. You can do it little buddy!
"something big just happened for PLTR, I'm not exactly sure what it was but this is about to go up"
"When this goes over 30 next week, it’s time for new Ferrari!"
Hoping to see pltr hit 40 by end of year. Setting my expectations low so anything over is even better 
"I am very frustrated with this stock, I want to be a long-term investor but I want to see stability and the company to start buying back shares if they think the stock has come down too low..."
"Today double the avrg volume, closing green $1 up. Bears are left behind again. Big money make money all the time"

"This is an small excerpt from Cathie Wood’s interview on Jesus Calling podcast... very inspirational.. she goes into why she named it Ark Invest... but couldn’t copy it all here... “I really feel like that was the Holy Spirit just saying to me, “Okay, this is the plan.” And the idea was basically, “Look, you’ve been a student of disruptive innovation your entire career. Why don’t you disrupt your own industry? It’s broken. Why do you disrupt it with some of these new technologies? Why don’t you harness social media? Why don’t you invite people in—even your competitors—to brainstorm about these new ideas, to help spread the word?” And so I did that, and it’s been amazing. It’s so much better than anything that I could have possibly imagined. “"
"Waiting for 22. Sorry guys, price is to high to get in now with this market condition."
I hope ark didn't lighten up here
Just bought a 100 at $23.29 To the moon boys 
"Loaded up more.This is a nobrainer.As long as the fundamentals are intact and the contracts keep coming in, I’m gonna keep ignoring the analysts and the bears. I predict this will hit $100 before the end of the year."

"PLTR - Guys look at call/put ratio of PLTR - its 3 times for calls-also heavily shorted. If we can push this at 27+, this will cause ripple effect like GME...PLTR can reach 75 today"
Long with over 500 shares...not worried about lock up expiry at all. It will move up even if it drops. Key is to be patient and hold and keep selling covered calls to make money along the way...easily $50 stock in the next quarter or so.
August $40 calls. LFG.
Those who sold their shares at $21
Covered calls to average down if you don't have funds.

Once we break the $30 resistance this will just take off and the next resistance will be around $35.
YESS!!! first Green Day there has been in days

I have been in Qeth.u from $18 and made $5k. I am going to sell all of it tomorrow to add to my 289 shares of Pltr. I want to retire with Pltr.
CREDIT SUISSE bought 6.3 million shares!
Market will come back after Powell calms inflation fears. Fed won’t do anything to disrupt recovery.
Basically somewhat bullish long term but concerned short term. If the numbers miss the mark at earnings release then watch out below. Current valuation of the company stands at $57 billion or so. They will barely squeeze out $1 billion in revenue this year. Pretty high PE. I hate the fact that they have 1.7 billion shares outstanding. Institutions only hold 13% of the stock. What is going to happen after the lock up expires next week? It could flood the market with people wanting to sell their shares which will drive the price down. Be careful out there! Don’t back the bus up just yet.
Up 6% in Berlin
Glad I got out of this at 25
Imagine buying APPL at 40Billion market cap. That?s PLTR right now. This is the best time you will have to buy pltr. 40% dip from last month. Covid crash lasted 1 month. It?s been a month of all tech correcting. Bears are #$%$ to short at this point. It?s time to buy.
This is a great company. Zip y'all up!
AMC has earnings coming up so that may drop back down for a nice entry but pltr earnings already lock already insiders sold already. So back up we go
I am just in @ 27.90 bought the dip yesterday! hodling for longterm #notselling
I'm hesitant to sell a few Apple stocks and strengthen Palantir. What do you think?
Imagine that on a Green Day Ramses disappears......
"Been patient since $9.45, go ahead and panic, I’ll go for a walk and ignore my portfolio for a week or two, let’s see who’s crying afterwards"
I love all the repetitive negative tone articles from yahoo...omg insiders sold some shares after waiting 17 years give me a break......
FINALLY some good news about PLTR! https://mobile.twitter.com/deitaone/status/1364183109818867713?s=21
It’s like TSLA for me. I got in before it started making profits and refused to sell any share. Until I discovered palantir. I shaved TSLA at 700/s and bought PLTR. I am comfortably retired from corporate job. Sitting on 60k PLTR shares and not selling.
Looking like a Green Day  !!
Time for a power hour rise?
monday i will beable to trade margins. im gonna hold it though!!! yin buying 750 more shares monday
Any chance this goes to $20
we need this 26.5 bois PUSH THROUGH
it will be above 80 $ within a year. make a note of this you shorts
If you sold or even had the thought cross your mind after seeing 2% in the red today you deserve to loose money. Do your DD & stop using yahoo message boards as your answer to sell or buy.
Two words. Cathie Wood.
"Verizon , ATI , Facebook , Tesla , Morgan the list goes on who will be using Palantir to get the edge"
"You buy the company not the stock, Palantir softwares will optimize time of decision making for every company and that's a game changer. Add on it, the most important innovations started in the governments especially in the defense sector and in intelligence sector. #BIGDATA#AI"
"AH 25.51, hope it will be a good day tomorrow."
BOOM !!
Its coming back to 38$
It’s holding so nicely even tho insiders are selling easy 30 next week
I brought in at 28.8 can only lower my cost basis now
Not planning to sell anytime soon! I double downed my long term options calls today. Originally had 5 contracts with expiration dates of 1/20/23 strike price $10. I bought on IPO. Today I sold two and bought 3 options contracts at $22C exp 6/17/22. I can’t wait to make bank! Also I am long on a PLTR. Bought 152 during the IPO and haven’t sold any
Take a look at new positions opening up at PLTR. Growing!!!!
"Investing in the company that gives the US Military, Federal Agencies, and top tier companies the edge is worth investigating. company of the future"
Why is it that shorts only come out of the woodwork during AH to run their mouths when the stock is red on very low volume? They weren't saying anything during active trading hours when we were green almost the entire day while every other stock was getting obliterated.
Hey Redditers! Let’s do short squeeze for a while and take PLTR to moon!
I’m eating my sandwich and drinking a cup of tea. Nothing to worry about longs! Who’s with me ?
yesterday was a gift .... thank you... so grateful....
"the shorts have left, the stock is basing meaning it is the time to buy NOT sell..........counterterrorism software in the world we live in with the stock price trading where it is today is a steal imo.....also; i will be watching sales ramp up as the sales team is ramped up (headcount)......"
you are missing the point. If insiders are selling 257 million shares of Palantir why should WE buy it???? Who da hell do they think we ARE?!
"I am a believer long term. I only have 600 shares so not a ton avg of 25.88. I have stuck with them all the way to 20 and back to where it is now. I just dont like seeing red on back to back days where the market is green, If it was red on a red market day no big deal. I dont want to, but really thinking about selling now and just do some other things until this has had a chance to consolidate some more."
"FK The 10-year Treasury yieldThis #$%$ has caused enough havoc to our beloved PLTR...I don't know about next week, but the stimulus package is the only good news coming next by Mar-14-2021Are we expecting MORE PAIN next week?"
Patience! My father always told me> Patience is a virtue! If you're patient you will win! we will see this over 30s in some weeks!And Next Q we will see this over 45!
"I held Aphria from the summer of 2018! I was down 75%......I actually did lose hope. I told my hubby, it may take 5 years to get our original investment back. We finally made out with a small profit last month. I can’t imagine PLTR will take 2.5 years to break even. Aphria was totally dead for months on end."

You can leave.
"MY TRUTH...I am long PLTR and I'm also a patient investor. I can with all honesty tell you that if I had been working at PLTR for several years I would definitely have sold 3% of my stock ... no problem. I bet if you look at the average age of Palantir employees they are raising young families. If that is true they have probably been planning their dream house in the Denver area for a while now or perhaps buying a few acres in CO to build a second home or dream house. Thats what I would be doing. How fun and rewarding after working so hard for so many years. I wouldn't wait for the price to go up more since I would have lots more shares I could cash in at a later date. It's all good if you are a long investor you are going to be rewarded but if you are super impatient and maybe a newer investor who wants instant gratification with HUGE rewards immediately ... you may just make yourself crazy. Good luck to all,KC"
This happened a few days/weeks ago but then reversed and closed green! Don’t sell!
"Thanks Pltr, You made me surfer ,I was scared yesterday when i bought at 25.02.. but i did, i believe in the company ...i hope we go up."

Shorts fundamentals do not matter. Do you want to get caught in this stock if it does something like Rocket out of the blue. Highly shorted/ large option calls and big investors buying. Same pattern. Be carful just trying to help don’t like to see anyone lose money.

"Hey look, @CovertAction is wrong...again....should be used to it by now."
If we close above $25 today we should see $29 soon! Still holding my 2K. If we hold high $20+ this week we will trade above $30 by the end of the month.
"So PLTR, CCIV and CHPT are all trading sideways in AH. Couldn't be more coordinated."
Let’s close $25?
poppes 50 cents in the last 30 seconds of trade.
I felt absolutely gutted when I missed out on Tesla several years ago.Nope. Not this time. I've learnt my lesson. I'm looking at a winner. PLTR is a game changer and the future.

This stock is so unpredictable. You know the secret? Just hold for years!
Monday is going to be a great day
"whoa, what was that sudden drop?"
Great day to average down!!
To those who think PLTR is over price for bringing billions dollar in revenue are the same people who bought CCIV at $50/share without even have a product in place. Mind blowing to me to even think about it.
"The investment opportunity in PLTR really is quite simple. Currently trading at a 45% discount from all time highs, you have the chance to get into a SaaS leader in a big time AI data space that isn't going to be regulated but is actually contractually partnered with allied governments. Logically speaking, in the future of business across all sectors, you either operate using AI or you get wiped out by competitors that do. So companies have the option of creating their own ai budget, hiring, training, implementing which takes TIME which is equal to dollars lost. Or, they install a software that is the leader and most advanced in the space they require to not only thrive but survive vs competition. The fact that people don't seem to understand base level logic is mind blowing. When multi billion dollar companies are up against it penny pinching as interest rates rise down the road and the economy becomes even more competitive, there's no longer two options there's only one. Take from this what you will but for those who understand business forget the numbers and media for a minute and just use you brain, simply, make a choice."
I have a honer
"Please Read - Facebook Contract - Let’s put this one to rest. Commercial contracts do NOT require announcements and often kept private unlike public sector contracts. People are reading tea leaves due to Facebook job postings and there have been MANY more large Enterprises that have Palantir experience in the job descriptions.I believe a relationship with Facebook is imminent. The threat for child exploitation, child trafficking, etc is real on FB and Palantir helps in this regard already with orgs specifically addressing this real threat in a growing virtual world.I also believe the relationship of Thiel with Facebook (Series A and Series C investor) helps the relationship come together. I expect THE SAME from the likes of Tesla (to take autonomous driving, robo taxis, etc) to the next level and continue to help Tesla outpace Chinese brands like Nio, Xpeng, etc. because after all, Palantir doesn’t get down with China.I also expect the same with SpaceX as flying people around will require extensive data analysis and predictive outcomes..I expect the same with PayPal as PayPal has gone heavy on Bitcoin and the managing/security of the dark web on Crypto will require policing and that’s right up the Palantir playbook. So sit tight my friends. But don’t get restless waiting for a Facebook announcement. Not all commercial contracts are public. So we may not ever see the relationship in bright lights but the revenue could come pouring in.All roads lead to Palantir. #notallthatisgoldglitters"
Well well. Let’s see what next week has to say
"I'm not surprise if we have a jump to $30 before Market close, that would be sweet!"
"Thumb up if you bought, are buying and will HOLD for at least 1 yr.Thumb down if speculating for short-term profit.I’m confidently holding for 2-5 yrs. 15k+ shares in so far."
going back to 20.18?
Karp is doing like Elon musk! He said the same words before tesla's rally
Recovery week for the market
"This cannot hold $ 25 when the market explodes and dreamers are delirious about $ 30, 45, 60.The direction is clear - below $ 20. It won't happen quickly, but it is inevitable."
going up! 
"5000 shares , will wait 6 months before selling, not sure how much it will be"
"$pltr was at $45 on Jan 27th, lost more than 50% in less than 30 days. $pltr got hit since executives sold very few number of stocks when comparing 1.5 billions of outstanding stocks. Will be suiting moon soon when the market recovers."
Who thinks PLTR will hit 75-100 EOY?
this will be 30+ next week
Buy order in for 26.50 PM
"26.20, Like I've said a few times here, is a point of resistance. We will break that, and find support at 26.40 ish"
PLTR... just sit back and enjoy the ride... cashishhhhhh
Could we see a $50 on monday?
"If you liked Palantir at $32, you should love it at $22. (Think long.)"
PLTR on Fast Money ! They claim we got a boost from Reddit. Frankly I don't care where the boost comes from as long as we get $ 45 next week.
People that bought in the 30’s & 40’s we are coming to get you! No brothers & sisters left behind!!! Lets get it!
"Anyone see Cramer's BS this morning, he really bashed Kathie Wood and one comment was ""who will she rescue today"" The same Cramer that called oil un investable a couple of months ago which is now up 50% or more."

"People who bought at $40s or high 30s, we are coming for you!"
Someone yesterday on here said it will close at 24.5 to wipe out calls and puts. Looking likely
All good. There is no way but upwards yesterday drop was by all mean manipulative. Next week am buying 500 more shares as my cash is on the way.
"guys lock up expiry coming on Thursday, we may see further drop in pricing, that's nothing to worry about, the the opportunity to buy in the dip like Ark investment did yesterday , this stock will go back to over $40 in the next few weeks. I am in at $26 and if it drops below that price I'll be buying more"
I just opened up a ROTH IRA that allows me to buy stock and I’ll be buying more PLTR so today’s price action actually works for me.
The trillion stimulus will inflate prices and interest rates. The market reaction today won't be sustainable for loss making companies like PLTR that lost -2B $ the last 3 years.
I’ll buy in at $15 CAD
34++ this coming Monday.
"I remember, a week back when I mentioned about $BANT, people started questioning. Whoever followed that advice, they can justify my comment.Happy trading!!!"
10 year 1.606 and rising.
Mute spamming all gif posting 
"I love how people are in here for short term gains. If you want stupid risky investments go to crypto or GME. Palantir is the next Google sized company, it won't happen overnight."
I considering selling off some other and going full in this . the other stocks are high this has a lot of growth ahead.
You are dreamers $20 this is never going to happen next week 30+ guarantee
need to lower my average Today . what does everyone think a good low today is ? im thinking 27.50?
100 dollars here we come
Jefferies’ analyst: “ Strong beat....long term outlook....implied 30% growth next several years”
"Funny how bashers came out of the woodwork to run their mouths now that we've finally seen a red day after several consecutive green days. A dip like this was a gift to anyone who has been wanting to get in on this stock, and also a gift for existing shareholders who bought more discounted shares. Soon we'll be leaving the $30s range and never coming back, just as we did to the $10s range and $20s range."
Bought in at $15 & I really don’t wanna get out yet....
"SNOW is just chilling at $250, had a jump scare. 70 Billion. Palantir is worth no less than 70 Billion at today's sale price of 44 Billion. $9-10 was such a gift. Thank Thiel for using the DPO model."
I am looking to buy if it drops below $23.00 tomorrow - the employees & insiders can sell their shares.
Even MeetKevin bought a lot of PLTR based on his video yesterday..
Don’t fall for propaganda
For me any tickers are numbers. $pltr trades more than any other stocks in the similar market value that attracted me. hopefully it will cross 30 when all the dust settle.
Seems like the sell it's over!
Prediction EOD 27.03
"PLTR is a long term play for the astute and patient investor. Buying under $30 should pay off handsomely down the road. Not expecting to see $40 quickly as some posters have posited. Rather, a slower climb to, say, $50 by year end. JMHO, but $100 is in our future. Just not this year or next. Finally, ignore any marginal drops in the pps. Remember, there are investors who bought PLTR around $10 not that long ago and have seen their investment triple. Gonna be some profit taking, and that's to be expected. GLTA. This is a winner."
The vast majority of people here does not understand Palantir’s future and thus don’t deserve the long term rewards
"I have a feeling that barring unforeseen events, we’ve already hit bottom. This is not saying the stock will suddenly rebound, but looking at the 1 month chart it looks like the drop is behind us and the stocks is just beginning to rise."
"So it’s down a little after hours for no good reason, other than the market itself is down some more. People never learn."

Cathie Wood's ARK Invest adds 3.4 million Palantir shareshttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3667503-cathie-woods-ark-invest-adds-34-million-palantir-shares?utm_source=webull.com&utm_medium=referral
I found this a good buy at $31. Now it’s even better!!!
I had few shares of small AI company $VERI. Saw price going from 1.50 to 50 in a year.Where will be $PLTR from here in next one year? .... 200+ ???
wow strong on a red day. this reminds me when this stock was trading at $10. stayed in green while market was red and as soon as market turned green $pltr exploded. let see if history repeats again. holding at $27 avg.
We just need new contract release
"Oh brother, Wall Street Bets has picked PLTR as their new focus. I mean great I guess. But if you watch what happened to everything else they focused on it soared and then crashed like a rock. So we should be on our toes watching this thing the next few weeks."
"Big King Karp isn’t looking at the stock price day in day out, nor should you. Buy the dips buy the highs, just own the stock and HOLD. Karp and his team will make our pockets heavier and heavier throughout the years"
Is there really no end of the nasdaq crashing..
"Some Palantirians are spooked by the news that ""investment guru"" Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management sold off all of his PLTR holdings in 2020-Q4. Well, that means that he cashed out under the $30 level and missed the bull run to $45 on January 27. According to news reports, Facebook (FB) is one of his top holdings. Well, FB has lost 15% in value over the last six months, falling from its all-time high of $304.67 on Aug 26, 2020, to today's intraday low of $258.44. So he missed a >50% profit on PLTR while staying long on potentially a ≤ 15% loss on FB. That's one guru who might be in need of some further meditation."
$30 is in our near future
Welcome aboard wallstreetbets. Crushing shorty dreams. Love to see it.
"I am recommending all website publisher and software certification providers should partner with PLTR to create greater security authentication and stop malicious intrusion, malware and eventually hacking and/or fake news."
I do have some curiosity with 1 billion shares outstanding if Palantir will ever do share buybacks down the road.
hi
"Friends, I'm in a very difficult situation. Let's call for reddite together."
It was just $29.50 minutes agoDropped $1.30 I have to get on a broker who trades at 4am
Initiated a position today because of Cathy wood long term approach
"Glad I got in at 9.20 first and have a 10 average. Don't care at all about these small price swings. If you are long, you probably shouldn't either."
Cathie is going to make Pltr her top holding
"What's everyone 3/6 month goal on this hyper growth stock, I'm calling 40/50 again."
Thiel sold 20million shares when the lock-up ended...this is why the stock is down so much
Anyone see the CNBC ? What was said?
The robot knows all! PLTR is going to be epic!!
"Fair warning, I am buying this morning. It may dip further."
I don’t know if I’m glad or upset that this stock no longer moves with the meme stocks
I think this is headed higher sooner than you think
not a bad place to buy
Who held and remained long all the way from 45 until now?
Sell now and buy under $20.Who's with me?

"Holding tight since Oct, entertaining profitable ride. PLTR is like finding a franchise quarterback don't trade him (Houston)"
"Be prepared to suffer like Tesla did. But we make money, Tesla had a decade of promises and market share gains from the big three automakers. Like Thiel said. Zero to One, we don't compete, we own the market. Palantir is the next Palantir."
Funny saw that Cramer questioning Lady Cathy buying PLTR but now I saw in a interview that he was now saying that she is the greatest investor of our time and she has a plan like no other! Stay with Cathy and your a winner not to mention all news sources are saying the PLTR has years of potential for great gains.
They will reorder FAANG.
It will recover. Btw like the $AMC
That was tough. Still holding.
Any outlook after the lockup expires on 2/19?
PLTR is limitless. Let's go
When the short squeez begins...
Green is good.
"So, is today another 2% DOWN?"
finishes the day 25.50
Palantir will rise up to 60$ In 2-3 week
Sadly this will be a 10 dollar stock soon. Insiders sold off. Enough said.
Incredible hold at $25!!!!!
Whos with the diamond hand still? Im still holding 668 shares @ 10.45. aint selling a share till this reach 100.

"They were just waiting to be unlocked to sell. They waited impatiently .... And they flooded the market with their shares, not caring about small investors. It will be dead money. This company will negatively affect the history of the US stock market."
Stay strong guys. This is only temporary 
"Where are the longs?!?! Where are the longs?!?! We're here, loading up!!"
Thank you Auntie Cathie for loading up 12 million shares last week. A triple on the way for this ticker!
$50 ies here we come
This thing can not get out of its own way. Where are the gurus that loved this at $30 plus.
"Question. - are there going to be, that anyone knows of, any more lock up periods hidden out there ? it looks like the shares have found a home - IT LOOKS LIKE.. as yesterday was the first day i saw the volume going back to nominal.. thanks"
If I remember correctly 2/18 $25 Cathie loaded that day and we jump to $29 next day. Let’s see some $28-$29 mo day.
"This is the PLTR I know. What are we closing at 28, 29."

going to the gym!!!
This will be over 30$ by the end of the week said no one ever. Where did the buyers disappear to?
Well this is either a good entry point for people to start getting in or to get close to doubling down how much more downside is I have no idea but it looks like he can go lower but PLTR is a good company is going nowhere has a lot of potential for upside for the long term looks like I will start by in a little while and see where it goes from there￼￼
What a joke. Stocks from + 10-20% gain became a 1-3% gain at 9am. $pltr $nndm $gevo $bngo $tsla this is pure manipulation
"And now out of blue moon al analysts and columns vouching for palantir, what changed overnight"
Im loading up today. This boat is leaving.
Y’all ever see minority report? Not even possible without PLTR technologies
Doubled my humble position at $26
Can someone provide insight on the high stock based compensation?
Nothing wrong with this company. Not going bankrupt. Maybe just a little ahead of its' time on valuation
"People are being too emotional and are overreacting. I started buying the dip at $23, and Im planning on adding more if the price drops even further."
Way oversold.
I will sell at $600.00
"As an IT guy now retired I watched Palantir's demo day and I have to say their products are truly game changers in the world of Digital Transformation and Big Data. The future IT landscape will be all about Digital Transformation along with Software as a Service as it relates to Big Data, AI and Internet of Things. Palantir is clearly going to be a major player (and already is per the contracts they are signing on a weekly basis).In the spirit of full disclosure, I have a fairly large position of PLTR and I'm very confident this company will grow exponentially over the next 4-8-12 qtrs! The world truly is their oyster and as all leading companies, globally, in any sector will gravitate to Digital Transformation (in a much larger scale), just to remain competitive, if nothing else!I recommend people due their own DD and watch the Demo Day and listen to what their products can do and are already doing after 15 years of development and continued fine tuning of their core products.https://vimeo.com/488141017"

"If you’re in this long term, turn your phone off for the rest of the week"
Now that the Commie Soros is out of this stock it has a chance to go way up. looking for 75 by summer.
We’ve gone from 54th on ARKW holding size back when pltr was at ATH. And we’re now at 18th largest holding. While the price has dropped one of the best growth stock investors on the planet RAN towards the fire and has quickly made this one of her largest holdings. Adding where I can.
"The corporate narrative is building: ""Adopt Bitcoin or become irrelevant"". Just the beginning. We'll hear and see much more of this in the coming days, months, years. Expect largess moves in $BTC $GBTC when Apple, Amazon, Microsoft etc. announce their inclusion and investment. The genie is out of the bottle...has been for a while now, but you keep telling yourself that you're too late. I used to think that way too. Don't wait too long before you start nibbling on the $GBTC. Also gotta give a shout out to $RKT... the most undervalued stock in the market...and $PLTR my future 10 bagger which reports before the bell on Tuesday. Nice set up going into the print. Most stocks seem to be priced for perfection these days. With the recent pullback, Palantir could lay an egg on Tuesday and it'd still be grossly undervalued."
"Heck I bought More $qs, $sq, $pvh, $amd, $pltr, $msft, $tsla, and $gm, $pypl and $cpng....I spent $56,786 today. All out of cash now except for mortgage and utilities.Good luck, will be cashing in Friday or Monday as soon as they go up!Sowing now for reaping the crops!!!!!!"
Please tell me some bad news.....This stock will only be good news of contracts from here on out....It's Over Shorts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
IM LONG THIS TO $150

What are your guys price target for this stock
"If this does go green today, it'll be a lightning quick move."
"Dropping 3-4 percent is PLTR style, it is not too hard to realize, people just do not want to accept reality."
"When the market recovers so will stocks. In the mean time buy the dips or hold & enjoy life. Not stressing about a few bucks here & there. It's short lived, April should see a recoveryWall Street is running the show!"
really wish i have the cash to buy the dip.. FML
U got what u voted for !!!!
im sooo disapointed.. what is this price..? -7900$
"Ladies and Gentlemen,We are now climbing to a $30 cruising altitude...Please fasten your seatbelts, no selling is allowed, and thank you for flying PLTR airlines..."
This is the future. Investing in palantir today is like investing in Tesla in 2019.
I can only say this; deep roots are not reached by the frost ...
PLTR looks pretty strong than other stocks today. Everything is red...
Ark is loading....
"Bought at 9,5 so anything above 15 is Great the first year. But of course 45 is nicer then 25"
where are u shorties ???
Got a bad feeling about tonight with this stock . holding 750 @ 29
"ark bought another 3million on Friday Cathie sold 551,000 apple shares 77,711 Facebook shears so with a bit of look we will see low 30 over the next 3 weeks"
Cathie Woods bought 3 MILLION shares of Palantir today!!
Tomorrow!!!
How many of you wished you could buy at $25 when the share price was $45? Well this is the time !!
Peter Thiel disclosed he sold over 20 million shares of Palantir (NYSE: PLTR) on 02/18 through a 10b5-1 trading plan as a lock-up expired. Thiel is the Chairman of the Board and one of the founders of the company. Shares were sold at prices from ~$25.06-$25.93 per share.
I fully expect a rotation back into tech in the next week or so. Not worried.
"If we close above $25.50 today, we will see $28 tomorrow."
the founder cashed out all his shRes..its long term so will buy it back when they actually make money while he invests it elsewhere
Recovery from yesterday starts now let’s make some money!
"Jobs adverts at apple, Facebook, Verizon & AT&T looking for Palantir experience. Speculation at this time. Something could be announced "
"LONGS - stay patient, the storm is almost over. This will be a $50 stock by June. Loaded in 20s, patiently waiting, will probably keep for years."
now that is great news
"Presentation is really good, over 25 new contracts signed this year notably Rio Tinto and IBM partnership"
"I used to love the posters here. Now its the same repetitive post over and over and over .1. STOP mentioning Cathy wood....I mean we GET it.2. STOP saying to the MOON! with the rocket emoji!3.

Buy buy buy!!!!!
I’ve started the short squeeze. Now let’s go!
Just bought 15.000shares today.
Went from 576 to 616 shares. Happy to own each of them ;) Go PLTR Go! ;)
Powell reassured rates werent changing in the foreseeable future. Markets regained confidence. and NOW we rise.
If +3% on a day like today in the markets doesn't show strong investor sentiment i don't know what does. This is going higher
"Can't see how there isn't 100%+ in Acquire phase customers for Q1 Earnings call..... IBM says 100/150 AI customers alone are on PLTR so that should be 100%+ Expand phase growth....I'm taking the OVER for Scale phase growth.....under promise, over deliver...."
"Palantir never disappoints...shorts, that is."
wish I had some cash to buy the dip. Pltr is a long term stock
Yuge volume way above daily average already.
Green today.
"Pleas, $25. Pleas..lol"
ark is buying Palantir 
Haha run away panic sellers. Give us your shares. 
"This is basically a war on Cathy Wood.... But look at it this way, the lower this goes the more rewards we will have few years down the road. This company is not going anywhere"
"Upgrade from Goldman Sachs PT raised from 13 to 34, buy rating"
Bought 5k more
HOLD
Cheers for Palantir today No way to stop this Juggernaut
"Pltr is going to be the greatest software sotck ever. That's true.. And I believe that everyone knows that. So, if you know, and wanna make money!, Bring the true value of this company and be willing to pay 50 dollars a share!"
It'll close above 28 today watch....

Nice to see 6 mil+ AH......too the moon in the morning.
"Storm before the dawn. Senate stimulus (done deal but fear milked to the max), 10 year Bond rate increase (nothing burger JPow downplayed it, Bears gaslighting of course calling him dovish again)Options Calls wipeout game is being played out.

"There are other ways to make money. If you catch a leprechaun, he'll give you a pot 'o gold!Also, there's a pot 'o gold at the end of the rainbow. You just have to look for it."

"Gl All technical and historical data show a move upward is due. Also, This is the fifth down day in a row historically has five down days it has a huge bounce on the sixth. If I was a betting man, and I am, and if I have any money, which I don't ha ha, I would back up the truck right now. I had to put money on it, I would say this thing is going to explode tomorrow! JMHO"
26% increase in shorts. Here comes the squeeze! All over WSB
I've got 100 contracts of pltr $30 calls expiring 4/1. paid $1.01 each. trying to decide if I want to cut my losses or hope this pops big time in the next two weeks.
"The ARK Funds just purchased three million more shares tonight, hence the jump!"
this is the safest bet in town.. geez.. good job palantir
can anyone tell me when the earnings is scheduled? thanks
under $20 by Friday
Elton where are you?We need help here!
Just rocket past $50 and get it over with.Sheesh...
Based on the interview they should go back to being a private company. As Cathy wood stated. This is a long term hold.
this is even good on a all red day. that is how you know it's a great investment
Is it good time to get in or missed the train ):
Pltr founder just on CNBC
The patient will prosper in the stock market 9/10 times vs those who panic at every 1-2 week downturn Relax.
palantir ceo to be on cnbs this afternoon at 3 pm
"This is not a PLTR issue. This is a tech issue as a whole.Not only will I NOT sell, I will buy this dip as I have bought the other dips.These same “experts” will be nowhere to be found later. I’ve been preaching patience and I will CONTINUE to preach patience.Put your portfolio away for the next week or so and HOLD. This is where panic will cost you! When they panic YOU HOLD"
According to Fíntel there’s a 14% Short Interest. I can’t wait to see the squeeze from this alongside the ARK push. Come on 9:30!
"COUP, FB, CRM, and many others took several qtrs before moving up. PLTR went from $9 to $25 in 120 days. This company will grow over 40% rev per year. It will get to a stock price which will make those who showed patience very happy."
"Lots of shorties in here. They might just win. But at the end of the day, this will continue to climb long term."
You can see above 30 within this week. Big boys are buying your shares.
No doubt PLTR will trade $35+ soon. Some hiccups due to insiders trading which is normal as they have been waiting for years!
have 20k shares Palantir. thinking about doubling that at current levels for long term. tjoughts
"Don’t let a short term emotional low dictate your long term positions.Take it from somebody that’s made that mistake before. This looks really rough and many of us in tech are hurting badly since feb 9th, but patience is still the most important aspect of success in the stock market.Don’t let a 3 week period of red determine your portfolios growth over the next 5 years. Get off the phone and let it run it’s course"
Very bad moods on Ark funds boards. Lots of people plan to sell to protect their profits.
Did karp #$%$ off shorties? ?
This is the next Tesla
"Shorters must be thinking all longs bought above $30 and they're happy thinking we're loosing money, but they forget we bought under $20 and we take this as a discount."
"the whole market is falling, not just palantir... Just be patient. If you're looking for a short term gain, that is not investing, it's a gamble"
Where do you think we'll end the day today? Above $26.5?
"For everyone complaining about the price not hitting a certain price point. You need to think about why you bought into PLTR in the first place. Was it for a swing trade? Then you're going to be disappointed often. If you're a long trader, you won't care about the ups and downs. All you have to believe is that PLTR will pull through"
Take advantage of these prices while they are here PLTR longs there will be huge institutional buying over the next few weeks. The 20s will be history. These prices are dirt cheap. This is going back to the highs and eventually much higher than that. You will thank me soon enough.
I'm down 16%
it is a great chance to get in while it is under 30 $
"I've had 3 people tell me to buy this stock. When I ask them to describe the business model, who the competition is, and what the market size potential is.....NONE of them could tell me! All they say is Peter Thiel is one of the founders, and that I should buy it because he co-founded PayPal. Consensus EPS is 16 cents this year and only 21 cents next year. Consensus price target for next 12 months is $25.83. Only 1 of the professional analysts assigned to cover this stock say it's a ""buy."" Are the robinhooder's and reddit users propping this thing up? Options offer very attractive premiums for selling PLTR covered calls, which I think is the way to go if you are going to speculate with this stock at current price level of $26.92."
I am in buying at the bottom now
12M premarket volume
"I'm just a student with almost 50 shares, but I'm proud to be able to invest in this company. Palantir is the future and is gonna be a giant in the tech sector. Get in while you still can or go home."
Happy to say I bought yesterday
No complaints.
Disappointing day.. onwards and upwards!
Long term goodie! Great company it will transform me to Superman. Today I'm more like the Michelin hubba bubba man.
Literally no gains when market was up but PLUMMETS HARD when market falls
What’s this Implied Volatility stuff all about?
Don't mind seeing a little red. Used to see it on my schoolwork all the time and I turned out just fine. So will Palantir.
Toooo the moon!! lets go back go to the 30's next week

That was rough boys
buy on the dips 
"Emotional highs/lows & impatience will lose you money 99/100 times.Been preaching it in regards to PLTR since the DPO.This is not the stock to buy if you want to quadruple your investment in 5 months. It IS the investment to hold if you want to 5-10x your investment in 2-5 years.Relax and accept the short term volatility for what it is, comes with the territory lol.I saw the same bashing, from different bashers, as it climbed from $10-20, 20-30, etc."

"My current stocks: 1) Apple 2) SNAP 3) VIAC 4) Palantir 5) Draft Kings. You have to be patient with stocks and ignore the noise. Jim Cramer held VIAC and sold last year, because he did not see the future. He lost out on astronomical run in the stock, I held and made a fortune. Jim Cramer blasted SNAP a few years ago and said it would never do anything. I purchased a ton of SNAP in the early teens and it has gone crazy. Jim Cramer does not like Palantir, but I loaded the boat! Jim Cramer is like the Dr, Fauci of recommendations. He is right 50% of the time, I have lost $ on one stock in my life, Trans Ocean."
It warms my heart to know the SHORTS lost another 2 billion dollars on GAMESTOP. Just add that to the over 70 billion they’ve lost already. Long and patience wins the race.

"Forwarded as received from one Reddit memberAll of Palantir?s (weekly) blockbuster deals/contracts/partnership are being downplayed by financial media.Disclaimer: This isn?t DD nor is it financial advice. This post is for educational purposes only. My views are my own. Let?s talk about Japan, a notoriously a difficult market to enter for a slew of reasons. Successfully entering the Japanese market in any capacity is a big deal, especially for a western company. This has been completely buried by the financial media as we continue to see minimal positive coverage of Palantir. Once the Japanese market starts bearing fruit for Palantir the implications are huge. Rio Tinto, a mining giant recently signed a ?significant? multiyear agreement to license its Foundry analytics platform for mining. Again, the trend we?re seeing in the financial media is to downplay these big deals. Mining is extremely competitive, if one company adopts a tech that can save money or affect the bottom line others will have no choice but to line up. In a [press release](https://www.barrons.com/articles/palantir-license-deal-mining-gian-rio-tinto-51611847014) Rio Tinto said that the deal ?is an important step in our digital transformation; enabling fast-paced, forward-looking decision making across our operations leading to improved results in safety, cost and production.?A giant, in the mining industry is using Palantir to digitally transform their business. The language is important. We?ve been hearing about digital transformation for years but all that?s meant for most is switching retail sales to online sales. Palantir is truly transforming the digital world. By taking data (which company?s usually have in droves and do almost nothing with) and turning it into a tool to increase productivity, efficiency and safety has major implications, not just for mining but for every company. Palantir seems to have found the new gold rush and they?re the only game in town. The latest partnership with IBM is yet another blockbuster announcement that?s been totally downplayed IBM is [fortune 50 company](https://fortune.com/fortune500/2020/search/), ranked 38th. For some perspective Disney is 49th and Facebook is 46th. But we?re not talking about IBMs achievements I?m getting at IBM?s gigantic customer base. IBM?s customer base include governments all around the world and even more impressively, the entire Fortune 500. As a partner Palantir now has a direct line to companies like Walmart, Amazon, Exxon, Apple etc etc. To say the implications here are massive may be an understatement. Just a quick factoid, Apple had to partner with IBM to fuel its enterprise growth, and their partnership did just that. What I believe is the most downplayed of all of this is the fact that Palantir is a downright monopoly. Right now we?re hearing that the market doesn?t know exactly what Palantir does or how to price it. This is typical #$%$ from Wall Street. Don?t these guys make billions of dollars from assimilating information like this before anyone else? If demo day showed us anything it?s that no company can currently do what Palantir does. In Theils own words Palantir is truly a 0 to 1 company, not a 1+. When I see Palantir through an objective lens and not Wall Street?s I can safely assume that Palantir, a monopoly, can achieve a 1 trillion dollar ($500 SP) market cap and above. With the explosive deals coming in weekly that would seem sooner rather than later. A couple of months ago I thought a 10 year timeline may have brought Palantir close to that number but I wasn?t factoring in some key statistics. The main one that I don?t exactly know how quickly a monopoly can grow. And that monopolies that were around back in the day didn?t have such a big market. I don?t think industries were as big as they are now with completely new sectors that have emerged since then. $1T MC was just an idea in the 80?s and 90?s. Now we have a handful of companies with trillion dollar market caps. Apple?s is 2.2 trillion while Microsoft is closing in on 2 trillion. With Palantir being a monopoly, inflation, and world trade opened to its fullest capacity I think Palantir achieving a $1 trillion market cap could be sooner than I initially thought."
This is pain
This will also rise with Bitcoin seeing they use Cryptocurrency for ROBUX$$$$$
"Such a big day in the market but as luck would have it, I had one of the stocks that did not go up at all. Sold out of it and now put all in here at 24.80. What comes first, 20 or 29? I hope for the latter obviously."
I add 2000 .$29.98
PLTR investors will make a few pennies today. Management will make MILLIONS!!!
It’s evident PLTR is head on with shorters
We’ll be back in the 30’s by next week.
26.80 is next resistance
My only winner today... love you palantir
"the manipulators will rap this one more time on Monday, to frustrate,then higher and higher like Jackie Wilson sings."
What will PLTR do with so much cash each quarter? Imagine buying back shared will be an option.
$0.30-$0.35 that’s all I’m asking for in the next hour to close above $27.
Ark! Likes! PLTR!!
The Guidance this year is 45% growth !! This is a phenomenal growth and this could bring profitability!!
"I heard on cnbc(?) that Ferari used pltr’s commercial software to reduce a decision process from 20 seconds to 3 seconds. An 85% reduction on a process important enough to put through this process. If they could use this to reduce vehicle handling, accident avoidance or fuel mixtures, etc they’d have real break throughs for their 458 Italia or 488 GTB.BOOM, Another $100k per car!"
The sharks push down the price before the demo day . So that they buy cheap . After the demo day the price is driven up . Don’t u guys see how the game is played ???
Bought 90 shares @24.43
"Lock up is over, and it is green!"
Imagine if we ended green today after all this 
"When will impatient “investors” learn, this is how the big boys make their profits .They count on your weak hands and lack of confidence to ride out a little month or two of red..Told ya"
CNBC is beginning a counter narrative against Cathie Wood. Just because of Palantir shares. Never a problem with buying $685 TSLA shares eh Goldman Sachs? (A huge position in it)
I see short squeeeeezeee this week.
when ARK start selling PLTR. then we know it's the bottom.
"This is going to be a very positive week, $100 before end of year maybe higher."
the boogeyman is inflation...we overcame.covid and nownworried about paying a few more bucks for stuff..all the money we lost isnsure to aid in deflation
Someone just grabbed 285k shares @28.80? who could it be?
Going to dump 10k tomorrow for long term. good luck
did anyone take a look at April options call? something big is coming in
PLTR might be back to $30’s tomorrow.
Scoopin some more shares today at market open let’s go. The best stock in my portfolio.
Grabage.. in 17 years this co have only 125 clients.. and debt.
"Yeah, this thing PLTR is beginning to boil. The MACD crossover, Williams%R, & HugeCall interest in the 30,32,35,40 Calls. It's getting interesting."
"Hey, be aware you might get 12 out of 15 days of red. Trade with caution. This is now called ""money management""."
"Okay Palantir, your turn to shine..."
Nothing new here $24.6 base
Will it reach 30. End of week
"Hahaha just quickly read through the comments, are people #$%$ off with a 6% increase, that's boss."
Picked up another 39 @ $27 Now 289 shares @ $26.20 I am happy. Wish I can accumulate 500
Why are we up? No news?
"Personally I hope this goes to triple digits in 2021. However, I think we're going to test the March 8th lows for all of these high growth stocks."
GOOOOO so my call don't expire worthless lol
This stock is waiting on me to sell some before it explodes. That's the way it works.
"this is strong growth stock, keep adding more!"
I think the stock performed great over the last 2 days!! Other companies down 20 to 40 percent!! Show investors are accumulating even on pullbacks with insider selling!!
"It's painful but I'm with Karp for the long term. As an accountant, I am delighted to know that most of the Q4 losses are related to stock compensation and not the actual cash expenditures. AS many have said, PLTR trimmed the loss from 25+ cents/sh to merely 8 cents/sh is a huge improvement."
Scared money dont make no money
NASDAQ just broke down the 50dma! So tomorrow nasdaq might go down further.
I bought FB shares when it dropped to $19 long time ago. I totally regretted selling too early at $59 with 300% return at that time. I am not going to repeat my mistake again.
well I guess I'll trust Cathie Woods and hold this for a few years. I wonder what 100 shares of Tesla @ ipo prices is worth now.
Just found out that my 19 yo nephew bought pltr today. So proud of him!!!
Good interview. The only frustration is you have to be an engineer to work there. Other than this the modular business model is common sense and they do it. We’re in good hands in terms of investment.
Cathy Wood could?
Like stone...down
"Load UP as you can’t win if not in it. The worst thing can happen is wasting some time but the upside potential is massive. From SPAC to Karl’s comment, Palantir is good for retail investors like us. US and allies will use Palantir and keep on using. No one can compete at this level of big data analytics. In 6 months, you will be bragging you got in below 25."
In since IPO baby!!! @10.60 Who's wit me!?!?
people want to buy the opening...they want to...all fed needs to do is not throw us another curve ball and not be confusing or conditional..just say it or be clear about it not say that they will say..just say rate hikes coming gradual.moves maybe once in 9 months and then based on need and be done with it
Thumbs up if you bought the dip!!!
"""We're proud to team up with AWS across sectors. Learn about Palantir's ERP Suite, optimized to run on AWS."" I thought this was the big fish PLTR was waiting for. But the stock went down. A lot. What gives? Why aren't we at $50 on this announcement?"
"From 2012: SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Facebook Inc jumped nearly 13 percent on Wednesday, as investors breathed a sigh of relief that expiring trading restrictions on a huge block of shares failed to trigger an immediate wave of insider selling.“While the lockup is expiring, there is nothing requiring anybody to sell,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. “Given the low price, these long-term holders are deciding to hold the stock, and that is lifting it here as the fear of the expiration subsides.”Roughly 800 million Facebook shares were eligible for sale on Wednesday after restrictions on insider selling were lifted on the biggest block since Facebook’s May initial public offering.The lockup expiration greatly expands the 921-million-share “float” available for trading on the market until now.“We’ve seen this before with other lockups. People sell them leading up to the lockup period expiring, and then they have a bit of a relief rally,” said Ryan Jacob, chief executive of the Jacob Funds, which does not own Facebook shares.In August, shares of the online reviews website Yelp Inc surged by more than 20 percent on the day that insider trading restrictions expired. That stock’s rally was boosted as short-sellers scrambled to cover their positions when the expected flood of selling failed to materialize, say analysts."
Vanguard bought 6.5 Million shares today.
Just added 100 more shares on my way to 1K shares
"Last day of sell off:Its great opportunity buy more of these shares STRONG BUY : #NIO, #PLTR, #TTCF, #GHVI, #GSAT, #INUV, #SNDL, #VBIV, #SFT"
"curious, what's everyone's average?"
Finally got to 2000 shares. Started 1000 @ $9 and continued to add on the dips. I will now hold these for years.
SHORTS GETTING SMOKED TODAY
PLTR is a 100+ stock!
"Cathie bought 2 million shares yesterday of pltr you tell me she doesn’t know something, big news to hit this stock soon and it’s going going to mother of all moved I bet we get to $30 by next Friday"
Like those $30 calls.....
remember when 25 was rock bottom.
Yummi
Market is ripping today bulls! It’s really ripping and we might not even see a dip at the open since we got hit hard with a 50% drop last 10 days! If you wanna buy PLTR it’s a great time to load up now! This stock was almost 50$ You buying at a huge discount now! Even Cathie wood when she first loaded up she bought in the 29$ range.
The only way is up
Shorts getting squeezed
"What happened sleepy jo said he has a plan , that’s his plan destroying economy"
why is everyone obsessed with the lockup...if you had shares and knew the potential of PLTR would you be selling now? I expect mgmt to give a glowing outlook.
$22.50 strong support
Everyone have to step back and see what the market and PLTR really is. The market is going to bear territory. Been there since the dotcom days. You may see 10-15 continuous days of selloff so you should hold off on the buying because you will soon run out of money. Hold on to your money and wait for a rebound of 2-3 days of green. You may miss the bottom but it is ok since this is a money management game.PLTR investors will continue to sell their shares and dilute the float because many of them got the shares for free. It may be better to wait.GLTAL
Hope all the longs are doing great today! God bless America!!
"So, every time it is down a smidgen all of these 'told you so' shorts are our quacking about how right they are....but we heard zero from them when it ran from $9 to $45...and, yes it is in the mid-20s now....and? When you got in at $9 all of this silliness is just sour grapes for the losers who have no stones..."
Still needs to go lower to buy in. Under 25.00 is the key....Longs don't worry. it is only business!!!!!
You’re watching a leader....
"I was working out yesterday when PLTR dipped 14%. I thought I may hang around those levels for a little bit seeing how brutal things were the last 2 weeks. When I got to my computer to execute the buying, it was only down 4% and did not go down from there. I was soo mad...PS- I already own a ton at $24.18 average. Would have been great to get some around $22."
when this hits 80$ do i take it out and buy my mortgage or hold and rent? O.o
buy this and live it for 5 years..
Its holding today because people see the value of the stock we all know this is a good long term play big tech company's are not going to compete whit PLTR there going to hire them for there services this is only the start. If you short all value the big traders like Warren Buffet so much look at snowflake its trading at like 100 PE ratio for PLTR that would mean around a 65 dollar price target. This is why its like a bargain right now in a couple years.GL to all people who are short we cant stop you but advise to not.
"George Soros, has publicly signaled his plans to exit. There could be some more volatility this afternoon."
More than 3mil shared added to arkk @@ Plus stimulus newsWhat y’all think about Monday move? 10% up?
"If your investment horizon is 5years, keep buying...if you are trader, only I can say is that high rates could bring it down to a lower evaluation or overall market selloff...I have invested in Palantir as a part of my retirement portfolio and I will be adding more...."
60 dollars in 3 months
"Shorts are really playing with fire, this have huge support around the 22-23$ while this can break out anyday shorts should really consider their risk to reward ratio here."
Futures down 3.5 points. Lol. Real newbies on this board.
i want this to fall a little more. i want it cheap!
I was in at 34.5.....not sold at 38 and holded thru earning. Now I am 13.5k down :(.
My crystal ball tells me that today is a 50 cents day: PLTR is on sale between $24.50 to $25.00...
Next target 31$
"I don't care if it's down and losing, I buy the dip to average down. Remember, if this #$%$ analysts downgrading PLTR but secretly buying millions on shares, you know PLTR is a big deal."
He said #$%$k zuckerberg ??
"TOLD Y'ALL TO HOLD THESE $PLTR $NIO $TSLA, STRONG COMPANIES!"
"SHORTS ae loosing, like they always did"
yep!! what Cathy says I follow!! she's all in in Palantir for the long term!!
"Yes! -- as a company/conglomerate, do you want to project a carbon neutral emissions agenda to the libtard world? PLTR's gotcha covered!"
Market showing NO faith in the CEO. Down 2+ points today for sure!
PLTR my biggest holding waiting for Tesla and ATI and Verizon contracts
Is there a reason for this drop or is it just to wipe out options?
Snow is down AH and we're we're a tad up. The seeking alpha article percolating a little?
Raise your hand if you are one of the original investors in PLTR since November?
Hold. Pltr has a proprietary software with expanding government contracts and an expanded sales force. Hold Long term. put it away and look at it 2 - 3 years from now. leadership is still holding substantial shares. So they and some employees sold shares they've had for years. Completely understandable. This is the time to buy. This company is more than meets the eye and the customers are governments and large corporations.
Should I go long on Monday?
At least 18-22% up that I see after what I see after hours
I really think this could be the next parabolic stock...have a feeling!!!
Just bought 10 contracts with an 28.50 strike that don’t expire till 3/5. Hopefully it works out so I can sell to pick up more shares.
"Question:1. Yahoo Finance website says that the 1 year target price of PLTR = $25.832. I assume that Yahoo Finance analysts have done their job to crunch the numbers and they believe that $25.83 is where PLTR is headed3. So, does it mean we should buy in the $23 range and sell in the $25 range?4. Unless the Yahoo Finance analysts and experts are LYING to us?Peace!"
"sold short 500 shares @25.05, will add more if higer, strong sell."
Why would ARK or anyone buy before the lock up period expires? That makes me think that the insiders won’t sell much of their stocks. Any thoughts?
"ARKK bought ~2.5 mil shares, ARKW bought ~867k shares today."
"Okay, big cyber high five,  thanks for hanging in there investors. We’re climbing up bit by bit."
Crazy cheap again add another 1400 shares
The US needs this in multiple industries. I went shopping for a refrigerator yesterday and many are back ordered with a 12+ week delay. Our supply chain needs work and PLTR can help fix it.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/n95-mask-producer-3m-expands-182704300.html
"Paresh, where are you buddy? Do we have a deal?"
I’ll never give financial advice because I’m positive many do it better...So don’t do what I’ve done and go 100% in on PLTR..PS - I sleep like a baby knowing ALL of my money is right here.PSS - Don’t gamble on sports even though I’m a sports junky. Don’t gamble at Casinos.Let’s see how many others have done enough research to know they should be allocating more to PLTR than your typical investing 101 book would suggest to you.Again - Not my advice. My only advice is never stop doing your due diligence.
This Stock is going to 5x - 10x BEY

Auntie Cathy is speaking tomorrow.
I can’t wait until 3 days after earnings when no insiders sell and this stock gains 10 points. I love PLTR!!!!
everyone knows PLTR is surging north! The most precious factor is the timing! The most precious timing is last week! All the sudden above ️️ @open next week! Jealous bashers just can’t get in right now! LOL
"A small gap at $22.5 was left behind back in January- once that is filled this will consolidate to over $25. Nothing has changed about this great company, earnings were good and deals are still coming - yield curve fears are overblown and shift to value stocks is premature. Watch for the next trillion dollar injection coming into the market and Powell confirming low rates are here to stay till unemployment is addressed. Just hang in there"
"Panic, panic, panic sellers are back. Here comes a tasty dip. Man this is way to easy. "
"Today is the mother of discounts as market breathes from highs for $NIO, $NNDM, $PLTR, $XPEV, $PLUG, $FRSX, which are my largest holdings as these are what I consider disruption stocks that have the best long term gains. Excellent prices for anyone looking for a huge opportunity. NIO's ER is March 1 and is expected to be positive. I expect a 50% rise from current levels after the ER...80-100. keep buying and holding all of these stocks until 2025+."

PLTR Investors
Where’s all my diamond hands at?? 
Buy the dips.
You would think a spike to $25 in the premarket would be in order for the AWS partnership.
Bought at 28$...I’ll hold to 55$
In the comments people are saying this will be 40$ tomorrow. OK... lets be realistic. If the market doesn't tank it will be wonder for it stay at the current AH price... my 2 cents :)
Countup to March 16 CNBC Chicago club interview with Karp exclusive https://www.executivesclub.org/programs/upcoming/a-conversation-with-alex-karp
RAMSES know nothing
It is most likely the final bell to board the train.
After hours really doesn’t mean anything for how it will be tomorrow
hopefully stays low tomorrow. Will add more.
"If you know charting and draw Fibo retracement lines, you will see that it has hit the 0.618 line which is usually the bottom. Based on analysis I expect Palantir to go up from here, and we will probably never see this price again. This is no financial advice, just an analysis based on a chart & the usage of some indicators :)"
WallStreetBets is attacking PLTR....? To The Moon!!!
"I’m loving it, im in green since yesterday and gonna enjoy the ride, anyone else have another good stock idea for long term investment?"
I'm holding
Just got back. What did I miss? Oh I see it’s green. Sweet. Thanks again whoever sold me their shares this morning. It was very generous of you.
This looks like a lot of employees are cashing in some stock. I imagine the boat dealers and the Ferrari dealerships are doing quite well this week. Thanks for the discounted shares!
I'm hoping this company will be back to $40 in a few months. I do not see why not
Add more today after the great interview !!
I'm anticipating another news release this week.
Why release earning pre-market after a long weekend (President's Day) after your stock lost 20% value in the previous week ? I don't give my family bad financial news early morning when they are barely awake unless is to tell them we won the lottery ! get it ?
These Senate hearings are so scary for the markets. So so scrary...
Added another 100 shares + bought back all outstanding calls today. I like the stock!
"I bought more. 20,000 shares now - holding for years."
"PLTR catalyst coming boyzzzAlex Karp, Palantir CEO, will be on CNBC's closing Bell!! tomorrow Tuesday...get your surf boards ready..."
"Bruh! Can't you see a great opportunity! Last year, March, people were so scary to buy stocks thinking that it would be the end. When the market recovered they cried because they lost the opportunity.My personal advice is buy! And you will be rewarded.Look I'm trying to get rich and live with my wife in a good house with a better car.... And I want all the best for everyone. So, don't be afraid to buy! You will be rewarded."
"What do you think is the price end of day tomorrow?I'm very heavy in Palantir, I believe in the company having great success."
Funds buying up the float.
lol - This will reverse immediately at the open
What a #$%$ stock $PLTR is. Bought some calls that printed green for a split second then tanked.
"Don’t play earning, stocks usually tank. Invest for long term."
we could easily see $29.01 today
I just sold some stocks to buy $PLTR at. $24 but now it's over $26 again.
"i've become numb to seeing negative numbers on my PLTR holding, this doesn't even phase me."
My trucks are fully loaded....I will only sell for the right price...Any suggestions on what price I should sell?
i see this hitting 65 can you? by april
"Time to Buy, everyone is fearful"
"Today's profit calculation:If you like to Day Trade for quick cash, this is the best PLTR deal for today:1. BUY at about 12:30 Eastern Standard Time: Price = $25.582. SELL at about 13:30 Eastern Standard Time: Price = $26.253. Rate of return = (1 - 25.58/26.25) = 2.55%4. This means, if you invested $1000 at 12:30pm and sold your PLTR shares at 13:30pm, you would have made a profit of about $255. With an awesome profit of $25 dollars, you could have breakfast at Starbucks for about $5, lunch at McDonalds for about $7, and dinner at Chipotle for about $9 = Total $21 and you have an extra $4 for anything else your heart desires!!!!6. Conclusion: Today is not a good day to day trade because $25 is not a lot of money to risk $1000...Peace!"
The first wave of IBM-acquired clients will have PLTR at $50.
MANIPULATION IN PROGRESS....
"I’ll be buying on the open, on my way to 1k shares"
I have a feeling that this is closing green today.
Many stocks are too ahead of their values based on fundamentals. Stocks markets are no different from casinos in short term. In long terms those holding the right stocks will be rewarded big.
"PLTR will be the next TSLA. Few people believed in TSLA in early years, now they have all harvested if they persist. PLTR will be the leader in the pack, the exponential growth will happen year after year.."

It’s gonna be a long weekend
"""We don't want profits now, we want them to invest aggressively,"" company's aggressive investments are the right path forward. Sacrificing near-term profitability for long-term growth is a net positive. Cathie Wood said."

Up over $27 AH.
Ark bought 5.2m shares today
ARK bought today too in all their funds.Not sure what they are thinking but long term it is a no brainer. Gl
"Like I said 2 days ago, PLTR will trade sideways for a few weeks, there will be opportunities to buy under $25. It’s about $25.3 in pre-market right now. So don’t FOMO and end up buying high. Curb your enthusiasm. When people are no longer excited and stop posting “to the moon”, then that’s the time to buy."
"Hey day traders, nothing to see here. All the action is over at GME. What are you waiting for."
50 million volume
Cathie Wood speaks as if Palantir is the next sure thing Amazon or Tesla. Invest at any price long into the future regardless of current performance or valuation. She seems to place alot of faith in the vision and products of the company. Maybe it comes to fruition or maybe it doesn’t. Is this a lottery ticket? Does Cathie already know the winning numbers?

"PEOPLE BEHIND PLTR: Direct listed to eliminate big wall street from the going public process; gives ave. investor chance to buy at great levels. Growing the company 50% yearly. Impressive free cash flow growth. Plus add the track record these people have to shareholders of their other companies. Will go up, up, up."
"Horrible company. They’re only working with the government, gas companies. Amazon, etc. who are you guys working with ?"
"Here is the yahoo profile for the latest deal with PLTR. They were founded in 1929.

"My advice to you guys is that this company is worth at least 50 Billion. Morgan Stanley wanted to IPO it at 42 Billion by 2018. That's with half the revenue today and an operating loss. Today, over two years later, these Wallstreet crooks are trading it at 45 Billion and accumulating. Snowflake 75 Billion. Get the message? Don't sell."
New price target $35 by Friday and $40 next Friday
"Hey retail-turd fortune tellers, your homework for the weekend is look at all the insider sales since day one of the DPO and research the difference between an IPO and a DPO. Maybe just maybe then you’ll understand what’s going on. Although I bet you still won’t get it. That’s ok, we’re all enjoying the cheap shares. Longs here aren’t selling."
EV and Tech are inflated at moment. But this one still has plenty to grow. Think about it. Cathie wood wouldn’t have bought more....and she sold Tesla and Bitcoin/RIOT....says a lot

"If you find it necessary to ask ""when are earnings"" you probably shouldn't be investing real money."
"The product, named Palantir for IBM Cloud Pak for Data, is planned for businesses in retail, financial services, manufacturing, and telecommunications, among other sectors."
"I've been in the investment business for 30 years and worked with wall street traders in my prime. It's not simply ""coincidence"" that there is a strong support level for this stock at 22.50, which is exactly 50% from the high of 45.00. This is where large institutions and fund managers will step in and either start or add to existing positions. Of course the price can go lower than 22.50, as seen on 3/5 when it went down to the low 20's, but the panic selling that day was bought up quickly. Follow the money.This is precisely why Ark and other companies kept adding shares around the $23 level (and lower) as it was getting closer to 22.50. Ask yourself, at what level do institutions wait to buy, 50% from the highs, 60%, 70%? They won't ""wait"" for 60% or 70%... Could PLTR go lower than $20, of course anything is possible, especially in this rate environment, but it's highly unlikely at this point. All of the angry posters on here saying the stock will go to $10 have zero experience.Bottom line, no doubt this will be a rocky road near term, but the market has already shown us the pressure points on this stock. Plus, the market has already shown how quickly the stock bounced from $20 on 3/5 low to $27 on 3/15, less than two weeks. So relax, use the dips to buy and you will be rewarded, not only long term, but within weeks. Leave emotion at the door and use logic. Think about it, what would happen to a stock if nobody was willing to sell?Full disclosure: I started accumulating at the end of February and now hold 1,000 shares. Will keep buying more at these discounted prices."
some serious daytrading churn...with all these shares now this is like a paradise

Al you really have to do is just look at Alex Karp and understand that this is a guy you speaks tech much better than he speaks English in a Social setting. And that’s the guy I want to invest in. Look at Jock Dorsey...guy looks like he hasn’t look at anything other than a Computer screen for the last 5 years. Those are the guys I want to give my money too.
"Why is a surprise to anyone that the reason they did a DPO is to covert 17 years of ownership into currency? It started at the DPO. The SP has gone up ever since and institutions are happily scooping up the shares.

Palantir ! Hold Be patient ! Billions of dollars will enter the market tomorrow ! Stimulus ! ! ! Buy Buy
So insiders sold 18 million dollars today worth of the stock and Cathie wood only bought 70 millions worth of the stock along with other 4 hedge funds! Lol bullish AF!!!
"i spoke with my stock investor today and told him I was still a hold on Palantir. He has been an investor for 35 years and says Palantir is a good company, with a bright future and he us going to buy into Palantir. So for all you people who bought in above where Palantir is currently priced be patient with the correction. There was a huge sell off by the insiders, plus a correction in the whole market. i encourage you to be patient even if Palantir sells off more tomorrow. You only take a loss if you sell below where you bought. The stock price WILL turn around. Thus company is getting into business with bigger businesses, 3M, BP, Facebook to name a few. Not to mention the huge mining company and the U.S. and foreign government contracts they have landed. Wait it out. Don't listen to all of the negative Nancy's out there. Do your own research on the company. My investor did and he is a buy!"
Cash is growing $200m each qtr 2020.
"I don’t quite understand why there’s so much pressure being put on the profit margins. RND usually makes companies operate at a consistent loss until they have a product that is finished and can then be distributed for a profit. I feel as if palantir was smart about using government contracts to fun their development before entering the market beyond. People seem to forget that Tesla since it’s conception operated at a loss for many of the same reasons. Tesla just this year became profitable but it’s stock was always seen as an overvaluation by those who couldn’t see the long game. Palantir is long, no short term profits here. They are a leader in their industry that has just truly left the development phase and are moving quickly into distribution. If they continue to sign great contracts like they have been, I see no reason why they aren’t posting profit post 2022."

Cathy Wood is on CNBC right now praising Palantir!
https://gov.capital/stock/pltr-stock/1 year later 108.481681
I think most of the panic selling we've seen over the past week has much to do with the lock up expiry. I think it will be a nothingburger. Insiders and early investors are too intelligent to sell at 40 when they can fetch 150 in time. buy. hold. chill. (tried and true strategy). Stop hiking yourselves out of winners like Palantir. Tuesday morning will look like your birthday.
the last filer alexander moore for 35000 shares sold only...good man ..ye shall be rewarded...the selling is officially done we march upwards from here
"$30+ by end of next week, $125 by Christmas, IMO."
"Had 2800@25.01.Added 2400 in premarket.Now total 5200@27.02.Feels good, man."
Cathie Wood is the best investor of our time. Follow Cathie not the clowns.She said Palantir is a triple digit stock and she's 100% right
Today is the the day  tgif!!
100 dollar stock in a year 500 dollar stock in 3 years. Buy all dips the first year of this IPO
"Rumor has it that during earnings call, you'll see leadership pledge not to sell shares after lock-out"
Glad I added more yesterday!!!
"Bought 1,000 at $24.92 and another 1,000 at $24.84. Total position of 8,000 now. Set it and forget it!"
Let's make a cult of this stock! Target $500!
"I believe Palantir won't move too much this year since a lot of growth has already been priced in, maybe it'll get to 30-32. However, I believe this stock with take off within the next two years as they acquire more commercial customers and continue to give great guidance. I'm using this time to slowly build a substantial position while it's cheap and reap the award in 2-3 years."
It was a good day to buy
im still here
"Lol standard pre market green, open red"
Anyone placing a long option on this??
Another meme stock. And you wonder why it is red most of the time

Looking at the call options, some people are expecting $65 by April-20214. Now, if all goes as planned, I should be the only millionaire in the neighborhood5. My backup plan: If PLTR goes south, I have one more horse left from my 4 horses. I will be heading West to find gold (My belongings will be packed in my small carriage and pulled by my 5 years old stallion and my family will need to learn how to live without toilet paper until we reach San Francisco sometime in the summer of 2025)6. I have literally bet the entire farm on PLTR...Peace!!!"
"This company is grabbing some solid consumer market foundation like IBM and Amazon, hopefully Azure will also join the strategic alliance too. PLTR they can start harvest the result year by year. $100 is really foreseeable with the earnings, not by shortsqueeze."

Nobody (including me) can tell you what this company will do P/share wise in the short term, I can tell you it will be successful in the long term with confidence.Embrace the volatility"

"PLTR basically has NO DEBT! Almost 90% of Assets are LIQUID (which grew 50% since 12-31-2019). The company has projected a very conservative guidance of $4B in Rev by 2025. So, if it grows $600m in cash with $1B in Rev, what will it generate with $4B? This company will be a cash MONSTER."
Let the buying begin.. !!
I see $30 very soon. Strap in.
Used to be my best stock but this month became my worst stock ever. 1. Regretted not take profit2. Should have never average up in these 2 months!
"If PLTR is going to ""grow into its multiple"" explain how it hasn't ""grown"" over the past ten years? It has grown as big as it is going to be. Ten years of losses with a $47,300,000,000 market cap. The CEO gives you the finger everyday but you just keep telling yourself ""this is the next Google!!!"" No, it isn't. It is a symbol over everything that is wrong with tech stocks today and will be in the single digits by the end of this year. Get out now."
"Worrying about executives selling shares for profit is the same as asking why leaves fall during autumn. There’s a pretty obvious answer but I guess most investors use their feelings rather their brains. The markets been shaky the past weeks and the next few days are uncertain, why would you be surprised if executives sold and took profits early? Especially since they were rewarded shares as commission.The fact is the market is going to recover and when it does so too will pltr, once pltr gets back on beat we’ll see the price soar to sweet heights. We just don’t know when, all you can do is watch, wait and hold, or sell your shares and incur a loss. Shorts and bears can hop around all they want, but when PLTR flies all of a sudden don’t go thinking it’s some miracle."
You know what to do shorts. COVER COVER COVER 
This is the stock that will feed me during my retirement.
"Cramer does not mention Rev forecast of +45% for Q1. Does consider that maybe management’s $4B guidance for 2025 is conservative (considering ave rev growth is 44%), what is realistic is close to $8B for 2025. A lot of cash generation potential."
Great company & management. Wood likes it too. $70 in two weeks. Add all you can under $30. Short overpriced EV stocks like NIO and LI

"See you on May 13 for the next resultsmy opinion is that PLTR underestimates its incomeI think we will be in a range of 400 to 500mio with profit.People have no idea what the partnerships with IBM and AWS mean.AWS has a third of the cloud market in the world and for PLTR the door is open to global application and visibility. I don't care about stupid emotion-based reviews, one day PLTR is worth 15, another day 100, tomorrow it will be 30 or 20, that doesn't mean anything.What I do know is that PLTR will become an inescapable monopoly and that is priceless. So don't rely on multiples and ratios. Remember TSLA AMZN GOOG FACEBOOK when they first started saying exactly the same thing."

(NASDAQ: PLTR) shares were advancing Thursday after the data analytics software company announced a strategic partnership.What Happened: Palantir said it has entered into a six-year strategic partnership with French automotive supplier Faurecia to help the latter accelerate its digital transformation and move toward carbon neutrality.The French company will use Palantir's Foundry software to obtain better insights on data from manufacturing to purchasing, and from engineering to finances.The software will help reduce Faurecia's material consumption, improve R&D competitiveness, secure purchasing excellence and track and measure overall CO2 neutrality efforts, according to Palantir.""The range of uses for Foundry across Faurecia shows the breadth of practical applications for our software in the manufacturing and automotive sectors,"" said Palantir COO Shyam Sankar.Why It's Important: Palantir's revenue guidance for fiscal year 2021 suggests a slowdown in growth to 30%-plus compared to 40% growth in the fourth quarter of 2021.The commercial segment's revenue growth slowed in the fourth quarter.Partnerships such as the one with Faurecia are likely to accelerate revenue momentum, eventually helping the company to outperform expectations."

There is not one person on planet earth, that can give you a price prediction, with any conviction. No one knows!!!

Nice price to buy in these economic conditions we are in. This is a keeper and could give 100% with in short period of time.The volume and technology attracts more funds.Keep buying at these levels.It could be headed to 45. This down turn is a boon
Congrats to those that just bought that dip. Easily 30-40. This is a joke.
Partnership is a game changer.....wouldn't want to be Shorty !
"Those who hold this stock long & strong will definitely make the most out this trade. Do not get panic in the short term's fluctuations. This will surely make the correction in the price and even go higher, It just needs time and patience (for long-term holders). As long as you believe in PALANTIR's success, the stock will eventually do great in the end. DO NOT SCARE YOURSELF WITH DAILY FLUCTUATIONS IF YOU ARE LONG."
looks like someone will test their luck @ 22.61. They said buy on top of me now!
direction is up
"Plenty of buying interest folks, green by EOD."
"Wait until the market opens, that is when the real buying frenzy will start...IMHO"
Big volume
"if you don't like it, move on I don't see the point in talking down on it. it's a long term play if you looking for quick profit just leave and find something else"
200@33.77 ...Should hold ?
Looking forward to next week!!!
This is going down to $18 for sure now
Been holding since $9.45 and not selling a single share 
Did Ark just bought another pile of shares?
"Cathie Wood is trying to average down to cover her portfolio paper loss on Palantir.Action speaks louder than words. If this stock has any potential of going up before next quarter, insiders would have waited instead of dumping million of shares already."
Tough question. Is Cathie Wood an investment genius or does she just allocate to extreme momentum stocks (which have done tremendous in this part of the cycle).
Right here is where the buy in and buy backs start
Wish I’d waited and got in below 33 but in the bigger picture it doesn’t matter
"These are the 10 stocks I am going to hold for long term -$PLTR$VUZI $NOK$HCMC$TSLA$BANT$MSFT$ZNGA$MU$ABNBAnyone investing on these, just LIKE the post.If you have any other stocks in your mind, just drop a text.Happy trading!"
Somebody want to check on covert action? I’m sure he’s not doing too well...
Well Soros did not sell his shares after all
"Dear Shorts,1. Walmart has a sale in the LUBE section2. Get some Xanax at Walmart as well3. Xanax = Sedative = It can treat anxiety and panic disorder.4. Get Well Soon!!!Peace!"
Everyone here is like ohhh don’t listen to anyone that uses Cathie Woods to bait you into buying more - k why would Cathie woods purchase MORE of Palantir 3 days before she knows the lock up period is going to end. Why would the CEO of Palantir purchase 40 million dollars of shares of the company 2 weeks before the lock up expires.
All the bearish people in this comment section have no idea what they are talking about. The market began to recover at the end of Friday and will continue to ride on the stimulus news. This stock has been in the 20s for around a month now. This is a 30s stock but I wouldn't get your hope up on it jumping 10% in one day but it will gradually go up as the week goes on and the weeks to come. It hit bottom at 19.50 and for the people saying it's going below 20 are just trolling. Do your DD and make your own decisions but I think we will touch 30 at the very least.
"Karp should change his name to Krap. That what he does to investors. This is a person, no matter what a ""genius"" he is believed to be, who has absolutely zero talent at running a public company except into the ground. He needs to be replaced by someone with experience and that Wall Street trusts. Stock has no where to go but down."
the outstanding shares are so large that if it ever gets up from the selling by employees and pltr it will take massive buying interest
3000 shares and holding long 
"The market crash it's over, we'll see nice numbers on $PLTR $NIO! THE PAIN IT'S OVER!!! HODL!"
"Good interview, love the CEO, proud to be an investor"
Holding at 31$ come and get me guys!
With all announcements I hope the earnings are a smash. Lots of speculation going on here but really nobody knows unless you happen to work there
today bought aark investment $40 soon
After hours 
From 44 to 27... wow.
"I see bashers are hard at it. Good, try to make a little profit. I hope it goes down some more, I will be a buyer on further weakness. I hav done my DD and am positioning for long term. Unlike other recent tech offerings this company actually makes money and has long term earnings growth potential. No rocket emojis or comments like straight to the moon. Those are as ridiculous as some of the ""basher"" statements and neither should be a influence whether you a should buy or sell a stock"
Happy Friday guys 
HOLD THRU ARK'S 150 PT. I'M AVERAGING UP.
Holding well considering 140M shares moving around.
This is a 100$ company folks. Just patient.
This panic selling happening these days makes absolutely no sense. Powell just said rates will not increase until 2022/2023 so I don’t see particular problems for stocks evaluations in the near term. Perfect time to add some nice tech and disruptive stocks!
Palantir will open at +15% above Friday's close and go up to +25% on Monday. Who's with me?
"Wow, sponsored posts pumping the stock. Not good."
I wish it were up more but glad to see people stepping in at every dip
should i buy now or wait for the dip tommorw... the whole market is green and you know that doesn't happen 2 times in a row
Just bought 200 more shares
"After hearing what the CEO had to say about the stock price, now I know why there was so much insider selling a few weeks ago."
"No one panic , u only lose when u sell for a lost. All these good stocks will be the first to fly when the market comes back"
Funny how when it is down in pre-market the shorts are so whitty and 'told ya so' written every 2 seconds but when it is up they seem to have better things to do...
Palantir sales is crew is at 30 reps....after IBM partnership....Palantir gains another 2500 sales reps through IBM....By percentage calculation...thats about 8233% more sales reps w/ corresponding rise to revenue.
"hope you got that dip,!"
"IBM was so concerned, went into a partnership. “If you can’t beat them, then join them”."
"When we see cash generation for Q4, most intelligent investors we see the engine to print money. Those trying to be clever exiting out of PLTR, thinking to get back in on a big dip (or correction) do your numbers and understand tax liability. Better approach is to hold for the long term."
Nice 
Man is doing your own research in this stock vindicating!Thank you Karp and Thiel for being blatantly transparent and leaving all the intel out in the open for the public to pick up on provided they were willing to do some reading and listening!#notallthatisgoldglitters
"IBM, 3M, Rio Tinto, Amazon, Faurecia....the private deals just keep on coming. This is a Microsoft in the making."
AAPL potentially using palantirhttps://jobs.apple.com/en-us/details/200218529/global-threat-monitoring-team-lead-emeia?team=CORSV
Opening above 28$ tomorrow! Thumbs up if you think so!
Given Palantir's exclusive relationship with our most opaque division of government...that's basically a monopoly... in and of itself that's worth 50.
Guys sell Apple immediately and buy this PLTR...insider information so many contracts and procurements in progress
"I'm a buyer. When the results of their partnerships with Amazon and IBM come to light, Cathie Wood will look like a genius again. Buy and Hold."

"My entire portfolio is now Palantir.3,800 shares.So who's psyched about Wandavision episode 7 tomorrow?"
Cathie Woods picked up more today..... Ark
I bet there's a lot of forced sales due to margin calls. That drives the market even lower.
"This 4Q I think we are expecting too much because it will only cover until December. ! But after this Q, We will see this jumping to 40s or even 50s. Always buy when is down, and hold!,"
I think we can meet $40 by the end of the week
"If an insider wants to buy a brand new Bentley and a $20m mansion after staying with the company for 17 years, they'll sell a portion of their PLTR shares to pay for it. They're not selling because they hate the company and think it will collapse. They're selling because ""Palantir shares"" usually isn't an accepted form of currency at the car dealership"
"Ok, time to buy!"
"I added to my collection. To me, this is no-brainer accumulate."
alright i scapped up enough money to buy one more share. everyone buy one more in about ten minutes from now to break the 24.50 resistance if we get this past .66 cents it will pop
good price to get in?
"As the NASDAQ is selling off, I honestly feel the strategic move is to buy NASDAQ stock, PLTR in particular. Momentum will eventually be shifting back in growth stocks favor and we’re buying it on sale."
"If u don’t like palantir, just leave..."
some shorts got caught with their pants down apparently...
it's easily a 100 dollars stock.
"$1 bln revenue, $44 bln cap. Haaa?"
Jim Cramer right now
"We talked a lot about how prices in the last 3’days were depressed due to pressure like lock up exp etc. what you have not mentioned is those who day traded on margin did not want to pay interest for 3 days so they had to sell. There are companies that did so well like Apple recent earnings, but stock got sold immediately. Why? Because the price was at its top before earning. With PLTR, since it was bearish by 20%, and I’m not saying that it’s 100% that it would go up, the chances for it to go further down is less than the short covering, the buy backs after the long weekend. The market is so counter intuitive. But my understanding tells me that these traders were ahead of smaller long term retail investors, so they sold way before the lock up, plus the pressure of not wanting to hold the shares over the long weekend as they have to pay interests, they over sold the stock. So have fun catching up the prices Tuesday then!"
30 on open!

"Bought more this morning @21.86, avg down to 28.30 wish I had more money to put in on this! This will be a life changer"
PLTR sp strong...I love you long term
were going to $150 this year
I bought 100 shares at 32 and not worried at all. I lost a small amount today but it will be back to 32 in no time. why would I gift my shares to institutions?
$40 plus is coming next week!!
Palantir is a powerful AI stock. Nothing like it. Total game changer
Keep panicking. I want to pick some more up today. Sorry you have zero patience but there are plenty of buyers.
"If your CEO just said he’s committing to a 30% annual growth rate for 5 YEARS, would you sell your shares after this drop? Get real people. These are smart, well compensated professionals with financial plans past lunchtime. Go ahead and keep selling if you think that, the institutions and long investors are happy to buy your shares."
"Weak Newbies, Go take a look at the 20 year long chart! "

"When there’s blood on the streets, BUY."
"Yes, I am convinced wholeheartedly now that we will close green today just based on price action so far!"
Want to know how you have a great investment the whole market down 500 and you're up 3%
institutional ownership 22.14% we going up and it will continue
Are there any upcoming catalysts for this stock?
"Jim Cramer recommended Ulta a few weeks ago when it was trading 345-350. It now trades at 312. They changed CEO’s, and now have been downgraded by multiple analysts. On the other hand. He does not recommend Palantir. Because, according to him, he doesn’t really understand it. This alone is a clear buy signal for me. "
Heheheh I’m getting turned on now 
Yeti. Going higher.
"peter thiel is a republican donor and operative who's company, palantir benefitted while trump was in office. almost all of their new business came from the govt. how will he and palantir fair now that we have the democrats in office. haven't the analysts warned you about this? haven't they been ringing the bell about this? NO NO NO NO NO...........BUYER BEWARE."
"I forsee that palantir is gonna be huge. Making business decisions with analytics is some unique value proposition which you can't find it elsewhere. Furthermore with more government contracts coming up, it's eventually gonna reach its fullest potential. Invest in pltr now is like buying tesla when is was below $300 pre split. Potentially a 10x bagger company"
Am I the only one wishing it wasn't the weekend?
I bought the dip three times. And I will buy the dip three more times
"Few days in a row in red (when whole market is down) and local folks freak out. That's hillarious. Show some patience cry babies or sell and never go back. That's what Karp said. It's a long term investment. And for your information, for those who don't know what ""long term"" means. Even 3 years in red doesn't matter, it is still short term. Long term mean decade and more."
Why would the insiders sell if they can sell at $150. I'm sure they make good money already!!
PLTR going above 30s in near future.
"this still can finish green. Let oversell, they will be back once we move 5% up"
Keep selling while ARK keeps buying
Soros is a winter fly to Palantir ).
Will win FDIC prototype
who bought today baby... every single share count's...
Just ink it. Come on!
Palantir moved up to the #31 spot from #47 a couple weeks ago on the ARKK ETF list. It’s ahead of Twitter now. Look for it to keep moving up at these prices. Cathie knows a golden goose when she sees one.
Up $2 yesterday.Up $2 todayTomorrow close above $40?By Friday $45??

NASDAQ is green. WTH?
I have been investing in PLTR since DPO. Can someone please explain why there are 1.47 Billion shares outstanding for a small company like Palantir. what are pros and cons. Thanks.
Today is very possible to see this reaching 29
Just got 1500 shares what do you guys think this will be end of year?
Hoping for a good gain next week.
Just grabbed one for $24.73. Not bad.
I’m praying that shorts keep the prices low so my sell put price could strike! Please shorts please bring it down further I beg you!
Worst performing stock I’ve seen in quite some time. The moment bag holders give up it’s going to pop lol
"Faurecia 18bio revenues, 235 plants and site all over the worldPalantir is in the big leagues and proves that it is not only dependent on government contracts.Q1 2021: next results May 13400-500 mio income, profitable, SP $ 50Don't miss Karp's interview next week. Remember, the first one lead us to the 35-40 range"
why would people sell for +5% when i wouldn't sell for -50%?
Smart money will be loading today
Looking at options it seems 27-27.5 closing today could be possible

2:30 is when the margin calls come in. Watch for a huge dump as hedge funds will have to cover billions on GME.
Fast Money Jeff’s closing trade selection is PLTR. Thinks it hit its level of support and will go up from here.
Time to buy more. This is going to the moon before and after earnings!
insert tendies here   
Don't buy this stock.
May add bit when it's under 20
Overall market correction. This is why you diversify and ALWAYS keep cash in your portfolio.
"I have to assume most of the bashers are secretly loading up right now before we run up to 40+ this week. If they have no interest in buying the stock, then why are they even here?"
Palantir is responsible for tracking down bin laden. Alex Karp said Palantir has stopped many terrorist attacks you don’t even know about before they happened.... let that sink in... how can you put a valuation/ price on this company? Next earnings report going to knock it out of the park
just watched the demo walk through video I see huge upside potential for this company especially if they can get major contracts with large companies like amazon
"Hey, it's red....come on out shorts...."
"Just watched Tom Nash YouTube video on why Palantir could hit 1T MC, does anybody really see this happening? I could see 300 - 400b MC but 1T....."
Buying more once it opens
"Don’t you love the whiners? Oh I’m long but why can’t this be $100 right now? Get real people. Didn’t you listen to Karp? You don’t like it, leave but stop your whining."

Speedy recovery Tiger. We’re praying for you.

"My sister loves this company. 90% of her portfolio is on this company at an average price of 24 . Me on the other hand, I like this company because it’s innovative and works with secret agencies . My portfolio is only 15% of PLTR shares. (Sorry, I love space companies a lot )In my opinion this stock will stay between 25-28 for the next week. After it consolidates the price it will go above 34 and try to reach a new ATH by around the start of May or start of April only if every with the stock market goes well."
Back to $30 tomorrow
Palantir will continue to land new partnerships. Amazon Web Services partnership and Fuarecia are just the beginning.
I’ve been warning all you permabull bag holders every single day for weeks! . This was a pump n dump meme stock scam! Get out while you can. This will be single digits soon enough!
Going red todayyy
No one stopped to ask themselves maybe the MM's are bringing price down so they can get in before the massive run back up past $40?? Think about it..
will it drop below $24.80 tomorrow???

"One of my biggest mistakes was not buying into Amazon at 400 a share because I thought their valuation was rich... I won’t do that with Palantir, I have a feeling this will be the biggest player in the data space in the next 5-10 years l."
"Was quite insightful reading on the simply wall st article about Palantir ownership breakdown: Retail investors 63.7%, insiders 9.7%, institutions 20.7%, public companies 5.9%It really does show the bears argument around insiders selling is baseless and fake news.It does also highlight that the recent pltr stock price drop is probably more likely to be result of immature and inpatient retail investors, hoping to become millionaires overnight and focusing on buying options and puts instead of actual shares.I must admit I have now changed my mind and I’d rather prefer institutional ownership to be greater than retail investors. At least they won’t be playing roulette with my investment.So, paper hands, sell sell sell! Move back to gme or wherever else but stay away from pltr. Serious investors, be patient, it will take a few more months but we’ll get there.Wouldn’t surprise me if pltr is not announcing any new major contract now because they are waiting for price to return to previous levels."
can't see this going much below this
There is a very high correlation between PLTR and NASDAQ 100. This means PLTR is down because funds are selling all high tech stocks. Nothing particularly wrong with PLTR per se.
a green start!!
"You can play games and buy GME and the rest of the meme stocks.Or you can buy the F out of PLTR and get rich over the next several years. Buy, hold, and never let go."
The executives held for 17 years. You retail-turds can’t hold for 17 minutes. That’s why they’re billionaires and you’re eating a hot pocket while bashing a great company that makes other great companies greater. Stuff that in your bong and smoke it.
I wouldn't worry too much about the drop. The rest of the zero profit tech darlings are down 3-4%. It's a sector dump.
Closing somewhere near $26 today. Watch those option contracts expire worthless.
shorts and pltr bashers are back to their caves where they belong
Tuesday will be glorious
skynet rules!!
PLTR stock is like a love affair...a. It's UP pre-market (Meaning: The infatuation period during the dating phase between a girl and a boy in love)b. It's DOWN during the regular trading period 9:30 am to 4pm (Meaning: Marriage + Stress + Fighting + Divorce)c. It's UP after-market (Meaning: After Breakup and/or Divorce the boy and girl are happy again)

"Faurecia deal is a really good news. Looks like France is keen on PLTR (actually its 3rd largest market after the US and UK) : - Airbus (to allow Airbus to keep up on A350's production); - Sanofi to gather clinical data; - DGSI (kinda like the Homeland department in the US). They have renewed their contract with PLTR in 2019, even though Thales ran against; - and now Faurecia, which is a major automotive company. Take note that Palantir France's CEO is the former CEO of Airbus (2012-2018) and thus know pretty much everyone, including the present government. One more interesting thing is that Faurecia is owned at around 40% by Stellantis (PSA and Fiat Chrysler). That deal was thus most likely overshadowed by their boards. More opportunities for PLTR in that sector.PLTR knows how to lobby and it's only the beginning."
"When it passes $30 IMO, it will be a psychological pass and it will accelerate the rise faster..."
PLTR is a retirement stock buy forget it 5-10 years
auto buy order @24
In 5 years I see this at 5 dollars. Hehehehheh.
its risk off bc of possible inflation reaching over 5 percent...housing running at 25 percent over on coasts and higher byilding costs...and if course autos high costs...thats whats gonna empty our pocketbooks and cause real world inflation erode savings...inactually think thats a good thing if you own stocks bc theh just have to charge more but only for companies selling what people want...is pltr that company i am not sure

"I keep remembering what Cathie said in one of her recent interviews about Palantir. She said she loves that they’re still aggressively investing and that we’re in a “winners take most” market. Every deal they land, gets them that much closer to the “winners take most” goal.They had 20 deals over $5M last quarter alone. Simply impressive."

"I am long this stock, but will definitely not be adding to my holdings right now. The Fed is losing control of things, and with the 10 year bond yield increasing daily, and very rapidly too, interest rates are going to go up, and Tech is going to suffer.

I cannot let go for less than three digits. I am looking at $125 EOY and forward to $200+ EOY 2022. This is my midterm outlook and I realize it is aggressive. 6 months will be a hard catalyst and this will bring $50-70. Any ideas?
leave your holdings. Let it work for you. Just get out and enjoy your weekend.
PLTR Kathie wood mania
I sense the shorts beginning the panic
buying 200 shares now
USD is rocketing higher. We're going to have a good day!
PLTR TO THE MOON
"According to Business Wire, Palantir and 3M Expand Relationship to Build Dynamic Supply Chain.Palantir Technologies Inc.

24 AND THEN TO THE MOON POP HERE WE GO
You are buying Facebook for 27-28 ...............
This ER was exquisitely and strategically planned after a three day weekend and before market open on the 2/16/21. You think Thiel and Alex Karp don't know what they are doing???...they are geniuses at the highest level.
it'll comeback soon longs <3
Where the shorts at? LOL
"you want be miljonair ( not in one week), buy PLTR and look 2 years from now ."
"Others can trade but I’m holding as long as it moves up steadily. If there is some ridiculously inflated move, then I may step aside for a while but it’s now doing exactly what it should."
PLTR shareholders.
"Come on keep selling, $29 is my next buy limit order."
I've had enough of the stock market I really have.
"Oh snap, we’re green for the day. This could very well close above $27!"
1 min chart ended in an ascending wedge. Tomorrow is going to go hamsammich
"My fellow PLTR investors,Don't mind my ramblings, I am just doing some calculations because I am dreaming BIGLY and planning on becoming the first millionaire in my family in less than 2 years by investing in PLTR stock (I am trying to impress the wife by betting my entire farm on PLTR)1. Current price = $26.502. If it goes by an average of 5% per day, then we should be at: $27.825 by this Friday3. By Monday next week = $29.224. By Tuesday next week = $30.685. By Wednesday next week = $32.216. By Thursday next week = $33.827. By Friday next week = $35.518. If ALL goes well, I should be a millionaire in less than 2 years.9. I haven't taught about the consequences of the worst case of losing our farm.10. I am fairly sure that my wife will not understand why we are suddenly living in the van down by the river.Peace!"
Just ran to the store to buy some diamonds for my hands.
Short this dog. Too much future competition. Buy below 24.00.....!!!!!
"Like I said before, PLTR will trade sideways for several weeks. Be patient, no rush."
Don’t know if anyone has mentioned it but it finished +9.11% up In Frankfurt. 
aunty cathie are you buying more today?
Every next day PLTR is becoming cheaper and cheaper. Palantir is making new juicy partnerships and price is going sideways. Best scenario. I need to get more money to buy more shares ASAP
"OMG you bashers and negative people, get over it, it's a market crash, all tech stocks are affected. It will go back up. Stop freaking out and cause panick in others that will sell."
"Credit Suisse just congratulated them. Shorts, did you hear that??Who you going to follow now??"
"OK, Buy PLTR asap and Hold for long !"
Ark invested about 45mil today mean something
Yesterday report called us the next fang stock. 300 to 500.
"Oh snap! Cathie ""Tiger"" Wood buys 1.5. I guess she wan't listening to the bashers on this board today. ( and CNBC )"
So far we are a go for green and continued upwards momentum any +announcement 30.00 pps and change. my analysis is the latter. gl
Keep an eye on the options. Somethings coming.
wow so many good news
"Palantir and 3M Expand Relationship to Build Dynamic Supply Chain, lets go"
This should have a positive increase in share price tomorrow PLTR + AWS for all customers now available https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantir-aws-team-erp-suite-205011002.html
"As I approach retirement and look back on my life, I like to reflect on all the things I've learned along the way. When it comes to investing I haven't done to badly with what I've had to work with. On a blue collar salary and no pension I'm doing pretty good. There are few things I wish that I might have known a little sooner. If I had, I would already be retired. The single most important investment strategy is to find a company that is going to change the world and invest in them. Palantir is one of these companies."
$32 today
Go babe go. Go up to 30 today.
Anyone who can explain me the business case of Palantir? The market value is is like 40x sales.
You better believe my stake in PLTR will go up today if this continues. Don’t worry I’ll be thanking all you panic sellers as will many others including all the institutions.
This stock will make me rich! Come on!
"Karp needs to focus more in talking about the Palantir technology and less on irritating his enemies. They are dangerous enough with out him aggravating them! Other than that, its one of the best bets in Tech today. IMO"
anyone have the premarket volume numbers?
just got in for the first time at $27.10 lets go Longs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"What fund manager wouldn't pick up more $PLTR stock on Amazon news. Don't tell Cramer, it's too much for him to process."
Broke $22.50. Down to $22
"The peak at open today above was above it’s 5 day peak. Double top attempt to short was thwarted by 24.50 wall. Trend is upward albeit deliberate (on purpose strong algo consolidation and selling of puts). However, there have been some big buys and big short closes to test various short term ceilings. Amazon, Army, BP, Rio Tinto, IBM...just to begin with. Fundamentals are too strong - markets prevail over short sighted. Always. It is a battle for shares by institutions thus the deliberate pace of sideways consolidation. If you build it he will come.Patience."
If this is under $75 in 2022 I will be genuinely shocked.
Watch this double prior to next ER.
Mon:RedTues:RedWed:RedThurs: Redto be continued......15 is coming soon.
Time for that power hour to start. Push toward that Goldman Sachs price target of $34!
News at 7am!?
BUY THE DIP YOU PAPER HANDED DEGENERATES!!
"Wow congrats to all the lucky longs, see if it could be 40 EOD?"
"Again, than you who ever sold me your shares this morning. When will you guys learn?"
Should I buy another 100 and average down for a 3rd time!!!!
"Where are my homies at?The Reddit boys and girls are not doing their sacred job yet?Many commentators are saying that The WSB crowd (WallStreetBets) are targeting PLTR stock.So, since I do own PLTR stock, if the WSB crowd targets PLTR and make PLTR stock go to $250 per share, this means I can become a millionaire before Spring timeOK WSB boys and girls... I have no idea how you guys do your magic, but if PLTR goes the same way as GameStop, I will quit my job and move to the Bahamas this summer"
"I’m prepared either way, hold or load. Shorts have one option, cover."
Buy the dip and enjoy the show
"This post is just for understanding, PLTR has about 45 Bil of market cap, but only 1,5B of estimate revenue in 2021 and 16cent of estimate earning in 2021. It makes a P/E of about 150. And in 2022 it will not be much different with a P/E of 110 at current price. So the current price appears so high. the question is: WHY?"
"Why the f are we down 6% when the market has almost completely recovered. I'm long, but this is not cool."
Added 3700 shares today
"For my long friends. This is all you need to know: Tute ownership has grown 8% in the last several weeks while we slid down. Weak hands gifted them shares.

Did ark just add 1.6million shares
Short-term relief coming later after 2PM. Say hello to my little friends ...
40 sh before earnings
Hope hope hope 
People are hyping this stock too much... hope they are right though because I bought at 39 )-;
Are we going to retest $8.90 during this downtrend?
I’ve been buying all day long in increments of 25. Hard to believe anyone could see the ER as a reason to unload shares.
Daddy just picked up more :)
Adding
"Long since $15. Honestly, I dont even care about the price. Days like this are healthy, you get to add some shares on discount. Who cares if the price dips to $28 today. If you are in it for the long haul you expect $100+ in 2022. Thankfully there are a bunch of overly emotional people in this stock that gives guys like myself cheap shares."
I believe Palantir is developing the evolution of the OS. Operating systems allow us to manipulate and store data. Palantir creates software that allows us to make sense of that data in ways we never thought possible.
just bought more
How much is everyone losing on Palantir?
Want to hear a joke?Cramer says Snowflake is high growth.
I got in at 24.50 . holding this long term.
Go to REDDIT leave this Yahoo boards
Over 100K $30 call options were purchased today expiring fri.
I don't think PLTR really follow the ebb and flow of any indexex. PLTR has beed trading sideways and ending par this entire week regardless of the movement of the indexes. You bears really know nothing
Like if you think Cathie Wood bought today
37 end of week
We going back up to $45 
120 end of april.
Yo dis jaunt finna fly. We all gun be gucci no cap
"More good newss, j&j vaccine approved."
"Looks like cathie is making pltr his next tesla, seeing how she agressively buys it on any dip!! Plus this is pretty much govt backed, you guys better buy if you don't want to flip burgers or do boring regular jobs forever to pay mortgage!! You'll thank me later..."
"In a world where countries and companies data is the most valuable asset, which other countries steal and get rich from, PLTR becomes a national security and economic sovereignty paramount necessity. Mark my words, this stock is goes beyond some ""quarter earnings"", it is a paradigm shift from naive digital age to complex/segregated data necessity. The sky is the limit. FANG is old history..."
"cathie woods works for the hedge funds milking the sheep, next stop shearing pen"
"Just closing flat on a day like today is an accomplishment. We’re still working through the share overhang from lockup expiration and all the people underwater from the 40’s. There’s room for steady gains from here, but I don’t think we get over 30 until after the next earnings report."
"My fellow PLTR comrades,1. I spent time analyzing the PLTR trades in the last hour between 10:30am and 11:30am2. What I noticed is that almost 90% of the trades are for 100 shares3. In other words, The VAST MAJORITY of trades are small 100 shares4. Where are the BIG BOYS and institutions buying 1 million shares, 500K shares, 100K shares...5. Are the BIG BOYS done buying and loading the trucks BIGLY in $23 range?6. Is this a sign that PLTR will be going up?Peace?"
Anyone else expecting a power hour to begin again today?
Reddit boys are back!!!!!
yep... we made it... tomorrow green at minimum 28 but may see 29 in my opinion...
"PLTR has no debt, 90% assets are in cash. 2021-2025 will generate over $20B in Revenue. What will it do with all of the cash?"
Btw..........what part of America or the world are you in? North/South/East/West parts of America? Foreign countries?? GLTA......
I’m betting at 5am PLTR will trade at $25.25. Don’t sell and take advantage of this drop to add more. Any announcement of a multi million dollar account win and we will be back in the $28’s $29’s maybe even low 30’s.
And who did not expect sinking today?
"While nasdaq rises, this trades sideways. While nasdaq plummets, this plummets!"
if you dont like ws then dont list on the exchanges..get donations or direct investments or something
I guess Mama Cathie is always right
"When the broader market is up, PLTR will be up even huger!"
depressong
I hope it does pull back a lot so i can buy moreeeeee
This stock will be huge in years to come . Saving big corporations millions of dollars. There will be a lot of contracts added as time goes by. F Cramer
"2/8/2021 : Ark Invest purchased 76,415 shares; I purchased : 1,500 shares. Dollar cost averaging good luck y'all"
last chance to be on board
Buy time tomorrow
"This may be your last time to acquire shares at these prices. Good luck, and still some time left!!!"
"deep deep inside you know this is a great stock , ongly time is your best freind now ( patience) !!!!"
Thanks whoever sold me their shares at $23.80. Heading out to the course. See you all later. Remember just mute the  just like you would a telemarketer.
Bought it at 35... contemplating selling it before losing it all
Question guys. I have 20 shares of Tesla at a cost basis of 400$. I’m up about 61%. It’s my biggest holding. My second biggest holding is palantir and I’m extremely bullish on it too! My cost basis on palatir is 25$ at 200 shares. Would you guys consider selling some of my Tesla to increase palatir?
"Pretentious shorts acting like PLTR is crashing. Look around. Nasdaq is down -2.46%. Every major tech stock is red. Compared to the beating that other stocks have taken today, PLTR did just fine today."
OMG the sky is falling. Send in the clowns that I haven’t muted yet. 
"This is the Microsoft of the 21st Century.... due your own due dili, I did mine...."
Hold the line....
Stimulus checks will be hitting accounts today.
"Cthie Woods bought 2,6 mil and Peter Thiel Sold 20 mil shares worth 500,000,000, he sold ALL his shares at 25$. Good luck with that!"
Look last time when Ark bought shares in 14 of January... they bought 500k shares in 14 of January and Palantir goes up 50%.... they bought 1.6M shares yesterday...
"35 by the end of this or next week, probably some consolidation and then fly"
"Keep an eye on Nasdaq.... Correlation between PLTR and Nasdaq...Now, Nasdaq is up 410 points... ==> PLTR up 5.3%"
Amazing results and more to be exposed in Q1 and you guys are selling? I think we’re not listening to the same presentation 
Bruh it’s down cuz of the Nasdaq. Why do you think a company like Microsoft who’s had its best earnings went from 245 to 229. Everything is down. Palantir is down because the market is down. It’s poised to soar. Don’t worry
Anybody think we'll hit $30 by the end of the year?
"I have 15,00 shares at $39. I ain’t worried this is going to $200 by next week. Trust me"
Im getting about ~$3000USD in tax returns in a few weeks.I am fully intending to dump the whole thing on PLTR.Someone talk me outta this or im going to do it lmao.
deep red in premarket. i am not sure how long i can hang on...
Why is it that every time this gets momentum SPY dips and it takes PLTR a week to recover.
"just trying to spite Cathy Woods, pltr should be at 27,jealous people, market is rigged"
Anyone else scooping up more shares of palantir at a discount?
Looks like another buy day when I get home.
Well the smartest girl in the room loaded up today at these for sale prices. ARK buys 1.5 million shares.

Anything below $25 is a steal. I'm bought more at $25. Waiting for dip to buy 1K shares to add to my already 1K shares. Not selling until $50!
"Wow! I've never seen such anxious for earnings!!We all are expecting to be high! I know.. But remember this earnings will be just until December2020. You should expect 1Q to be the highest! With lots of new contracts, And price at 50s - 70s. With Market Cap at around 90B!Agree? > likeDisagree > dislike"
"lets go! this pro america company has been manipulated kong enough. buy at will, buy calls, i did!"
just a reminder that this will be 60 by the end of the year
Heavily discounted prices. Time to buy more :)
People here acting shocked that board members sold some of their stocks. Lock up period is over and they sold - end of the story.Please grow up guys.
Incredible resilience!!!
"It's always cute to see the people stressing and fighting HARD to make sure the price of PLTR at the last 2 minutes of the trading day go up by 5 cents or less...Is there a reason why there is this ""last minute fight to push the price up?"
okay. loaded more. ready to roll. here we come April.

Reading the comments is fun when you bought at $9 :)
After hour + 5% fondo grosso comprando
what time we will know news about 10 year bonds?
Already down nearly a buck
This is not a win tho
Where’s that beach Cathy Wood?
"More contracts, more partnerships, more revenue = more shareholder value."
"Good qtr. What is happening here is there was massive short covering and some accumulation on the run to 30 twice. Now, banks are selling shares short and skimming just like retail shares in the lows 20's and lower. The fundamental story is in tact. It's amazing how strong the algo's are on a put insurance and bear controlled day where the flooding of shares overpowers correction buy in opportunity. I have seen it 100 times. Game changer of a company. Big Winner."
i am 16 years old and i have a crush on Cathy Woods. please help what should i tell her?
"Just bought 200 shares at 29.44. Hopefully, it’s not to late"
All this stimis checks coming in hot!!! Palantir to the 30’s????
Palantir is the perfect growth stock
https://www.google.com/amp/s/investorplace.com/2021/03/palantir-pltr-stock-has-a-bright-future-despite-rich-valuation/amp/
"10 year treasuries are so shorted that dealers cannot even find them and short sellers are willing to pay the 3% penalty rate for not delivering. Imagine, being so confident you are willing to stare down the Federal Reserve who is buying billions a month. Someone has an inside scoop and see a major move, obviously this means to you that your future returns on PLTR will be discounted further, reducing the share price further."
Who else caught Palantir on CNBC Fast Money? Every trader said they’d invest in PLTR.
I wish he had kept his mouth closed .. attacking Tech industry & Silcon valley .. granted maybe gave him points for his military contracts ... But didn't make him any freelance gains in Public market... just saying & I have the stock not happy...
Still incredibly low share price....considering the future. I'm a buyer for the long term. Glta....
Bought another 1600 this evening... 4300 now. Live long
"I have said it before and will say it again. Palantir, AWS, IonQ make the pillars of future progress."
"IRS needs a HUGE contract with PLTR!! Nearly, 1.5 trillion dollars per year in tax dollars is not being collected because people are under reporting income from their various businesses and pass-through businesses. By collecting the income tax which is due, this could eliminate a lot of our deficits and help to fund infrastructure and other social programs such as health care and education. A powerful big data software program could eliminate this fraud through cross-checking peoples various monetary accounts. It isn’t fair when half of the population is paying their taxes and the other half is skirting their civic and fiscal responsibilities. PLTR could help bolster our fiscal picture improving our quality of life and increasing our national security at the same time."
Called this earlier this week about it hitting above $25+ on or before EOW.
We shall see that we won’t ever see anything under 25$ again today! That was a hell of a drop the past few weeks! No PLTR is ready to explode!!!! Back to 45$
"20,000 shares. Down 170K. When are we going the moon guys?"
"it's first jump from $9 to $30 was followed by a pullback all the way to $23. We then hit $45 and have been pulling back since in an up and down pattern between $31 and $38, once it breaks the pattern upwards after earnings it'll eventually be up past $45 for sure."
"This is probably the most talked about stock on WSB seems like everyone is going to buy long term which is good news ,we will see ."
gonna be ling term for sure maybe 10 yrs ir more
Loss was because of stock compensation. Still +30% in revenue. Worth the buy at open IMO.
Long term this is a great stock. Buying more and holding!!!!!!!!!
"Keep these things in mind:1. The USA Senate has received the stimulus bill approved by the House2. March-14-2021 is THE DEADLINE to pass the bill make sure that the American people keep receiving unemployment and help...3. WAR NEWS: Israel may attack Iran because of 3 things: ...a. An Israeli commercial ship was attacked in the Gulf of Oman (Middle-East)...b. Israel is blaming Iran for some Oil spills in Israeli waters (Blaming Iran for this ""environmental terrorism"")...c. Israel wants the USA NOT to go back to the Nuclear Deal with Iran4. Finally: WAR = MONEY = PLTR stock goes UP5. So, the next 10 days will be interesting...6. Now you know!!!Peace!"
Bought 600 more shares come on Wall Street bets
"This is panic selling by insiders. Nice vote of confidence in the comapny, huh?"
"Sell, keep selling, true believers don't care."
We should get a fairly decent space here!
I am singing.... PLTR To The Moon!!!I can see clearly now the rain is gone.I can see all obstacles in my way.Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind.It's gonna be a bright (bright)Bright (bright) sunshiny day.It's gonna be a bright (bright)Bright (bright) sunshiny day
tremendous upper pressure after hours closing. if you are in the stock yet you better get in early Monday morning pre-market hours. this is the temporary bust out move this is a temporary bust out move to the upside due to CNBC analyst projecting upper movement short-term too many people agree that it's going to bump up Monday so get in early it may bump up again Tuesday I'm looking for a minimum of a 34 based on Goldman Sachs projection they're going to make sure it gets the 34 probably going to see 35 and then come back in 33
buying back started
You buy a stock with huge volume. This is her good stock to own The action will be where the volume is. We still could close 27
Based on SNOW's ER report it shows how undervalued PLTR was (another post on this board highlights this better) but because of this new info - Cathie Woods bought 2 million shares for ARKK and 660k shares for ARKW. If you are a long then buy and hold and continue to buy the market crash price. GLTA
plenty of spring I t his to get to 28.35 maybe tomorrow or whenever soon
"My target for this is 50-60... it will come, but you will have to be patient"
We'll be back up to where we belong - 35+ in no time
Added another 100 on the dip

the 30 year bond is heading to 2.46 % all this is technical and has nothing to do with inflation.
Haha 2% up. I love it. Slow and steady. Nothing to see here day traders. 
"Guys, did they say on the call that the stock comp is one off event? I didn't catch that part but I definitely got the future project with Lockheed and other weapon manufacturers."

$65 by April 16 based on the options calls.
"1. Staff selling after lock up period is normal. It is their bonus, which they waited for years. 2. Stock is down due to meme traders who panic sell and trash talk all day. 3. You panic but and you panic sell and you shout scam. Get a life.4. Day trading and leverage is a sure way to lose money. There is a reason why apps like Robinhood CLEARLY state that.5. Yahoo finance is completely ruined by you people. Can’t even find descent opinions any more. 6. Just can’t. You are absolutely exhausting."
I only have 4 shares and I get so hyped that I’m profit 10 bucks ahahahahahahahahah yay me
Uptick coming.
IMHO there will be a big contract announcement in the earnings report.
what a ride today; picked up another 500 - doubling my holdings.
oush
The bears need to leave it’s not happening pltr is corrected and at a stable price.
we need Republicans to fixed the market
"This is dead money for quite a while, several insider sales as well..."
"In 12 months, PLTR could be trading in the range of $80 to $115/share."
Put your trust in the Lord. Jesus saves. JESUS SAVES!!! ￼
j.wieder and serg1011 are same accounts trying to pump this stock.
"Added to all my major positions these last 3 weeks, down 33+% since February 9th.When others panic, you buy & hold.All these red is irrelevant, the market grows in the long term regardless of whatever “sell off” these “experts” are currently talking about.They count on your weak hands. That goes for everything, not just PLTR.Appreciate the $22-23 range we’ve had these last few days though, I’ll gladly take the cheap shares.This is a long term hold, short term movements are highly unpredictable, embrace it"
Bought in at the IPO. I'm not going anywhere!
Short are fleeing -38% so far!
Hmm looks to me this is a little oversold wouldn't ya say?
Cathy Wood added more PLTR & DKNG and both are down. Now is time to buy and hold!
A tech stock that has already been corrected - perfect to rotate into and buy now.
https://cathiesark.com/ark-funds-combined/trades
lmaooooo over 50 stocks in my portfolio and this is the only one green right now
It’s funny to watch the bears post on here because they also don’t know how to spell or anything about Palantir... at least act smart!
"Market seems down in the stocks I frequent, besides having great taste in stocks, do you think it’s in preparation for the Fed’s comments?"
I have been wanting to write some covered calls but I can’t bring myself to go against it in the short term.
Hearing chatter about WSB Reddit all talking PLTR. Hmmmm
"Stimulus package rally next week, take it to the bank."
go pltr
Don’t miss the boat to 30 in short term.
Another green day. Nice.
wow
I like this stock. It will be a turbulent week coming up but in the not to distant future this will rise above $40....
Options open interest @26+ for next week is unusually high.
What’s your guys average and shares?
Somebody is continuing to buy ah.
Don't forget Karp's interview on Cnbc next Tuesday !!!!! 10-11 am
Even with the increase we got Friday there is still a lot of upside to this stock
"Stimulus In, added more shares!!!"
"it's cheaper than when i sold it in november.always wanted to get back in.ibm cloud venture in pipeline,many government contracts,best data analytics software on the market.and ive just jumped back in cheaper than cathy woods.happy days"
"Did Cathie buy more pltr today, I bet she did one smart cookie"
Going under $20 before it climbs unfortunately. Will climb next year
Arkk has 9.8 Million shares now (1.0%) I guessed right she's loading the mothership. Arkw has 5.5 Million shares (1.67%)This woman is working hard for us. I liked her story of the newlyweds that thanked her for recommending Tesla in 2019. Cathie even paid for their dinner. The reason she gets up in the morning she says. One of the few heroines in the industry.
Added 1k to my 401k account! Again follow the volume! 7 institutions loaded up again today billions worth of shares.
Thiel and Karp unloaded their sjares at these prices almost everything they had.
"I added shares of PLTR just now, buy asap and hold for long !"
"People who are short sellers and newbees let me tell you this “its not only pltr which going down it is the whole market going down because big companies are investing in bond yields that is why bond yields are going up and stock market is going down. Furthermore, you guys please check all bond yields all time graph bonds never go high in long term it always go downwards. So why big hedge funds are buying bonds because the are balancing their portfolios and for the good interest rates they do this all the time but only for short time period. So please stop blaming companies use your brain do research about companies as well stock and money market and then invest. As far as my knowledge the market will gain in 2 months”."
"My $1,400 stimulus check didn’t show up in my bank this morning but my $6,997 IRS Tax Refund did, Whoo! Whoo! Buying PLTR at these bargain prices with it!"
Did you all noticed that yahoo is repeating the same news over and over just to say that has fresh news!
"For 4Q 2020 management said 27%-30% YoY, realty blew past these numbers. Q1 guidance 45%, it will be past this number. 2021 over $1.6B. Every qtr this 4 yr target of $4B will look ridiculously too conservative."
Red... red... red.... all the time
Palantir Technologies Inc. is down 5.97% to $22.52
"Exited out of my position at 28. Please be careful, and make your own decisions based on your analysis don’t take what a persons opinion as gospel. Be safe "

"A large short position means they have brought down the price already, when they start covering, some will wet in their pants when they see a $5-$20 jump in share price IMHO."
"If ARK is staying in, I'm staying in."
"My youngest employee asked me if she's going to get a $2,000 stimulus check every month from now on. She also wanted to know when I was going to pay her $15 per hour. As it's rare that she shows up on time, and frequently asks to leave early or work from home, I bit my tongue and smiled, then said only time will tell. We're nearly $30 trillion in debt, which equates to nearly $100,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. We've spent over $5 trillion on COVID related stimulus bills so far, which equates to around $41,000 for every single tax payer in America. We're giving people more unemployment money than what they earned while working, and telling them they don't even have to look for a job to get it. We're giving families that make as much as $150,000 a year stimulus checks. We've spent more on COVID, which for the most part didn't even represent a significant threat to our children, than we did on WWII! Our country is in deep, deep trouble."
This is basically a war against Cathy Woods. Wall Street wants to burn her because she did so well last year. Buy the stock for the next couple of years and you will be well rewarded
I kept buying the dip from 38 $ now I'm -36000 loss i am not sure how much more I need to buy the dips
"Come on, let's see some green"
pltr is going to predict inflation
"I sold. You can thank me, it should now go up from here"
I’ll be buying more tomorrow 
Why is PLTR down so much on no news??
75 percent if pltr ownership is retail..do yourself a favor and enjoy yourself. dont waste your money on this
"PLTR is goes up for one reason. It was over shorted for no reason. It is a great company. PLTR losses is mainly employee stock compensation. It is an one time thing. PLTR goes up not because Cathie woods bought. She and her team great at understanding and analyzing tech companies. She is ultra transparent in her trades where other hedge funds do all sneaky tactics and afraid of front running their trades. Mark cuban went on TV and said, why analysts go out on TV and say short this or buy that. They are simply creating demand. If that is a company, they should just buy. Cathie does that. Most analysts have no clue of understanding tech. They are just number crunchers and do some DCF stuff."
"The market is reacting to the bond market, and the bond market isn’t making much sense right now. In any event, the Fed isn’t going to stand by and do nothing. Everyone should know that by now. They’ll stop at nothing. That means more liquidity and continued low interest rates. That might be bad for the dollar, but if you have good stocks, so what?"
Pre-Market looking good for PLTR. 30 and below will never be seen again.
Where do you all see pltr end of year? 5 years10 yearsThank yiu!
This rally is BEFORE all the free money gets put back into the market. Think about that for a moment.
"If PLTR below 20, i will sell my kidney and buy more shares"
"If it cost $4bln now it would make sense. But $40 bln - Sorry, but No!"
"Wow, that was exciting. I picked up a bunch more towards the end."
I would not be surprised if PLTR closes at $35 today.
"This company is one of the few in this era that has built such a strong foundation contracts with Amazon and the government this will one day grow to a Lockheed Martin and even bigger because of the public and private contracts Queen Kathie knows this, be investors not day traders and"
It would be nice to have a good day
"Very happy to have bought yesterday. I waited patiently and we now have a nice base formed around $24 from which PLTR can soar. We have a great company with excellent revenue growth, huge institutional buying, and a massive market. Will hold and enjoy the ride!"
I bet it’s positive today

"Inveating in Palantirs AI Software is investing in the might of the U.S. Defense Deartment, Federal Agencies, Local Law Enforcement Agencies, and top tier companies that make the U.S. what they are. Palantir is a company that will help secure the U.S. and assist top tier companies with logistics, operations, and finances. Only major company with data integration on the scale that Palantir has and is constantly improving is Google. No reason to short just for a few dollars."
"I see Palantir going down to the 22-24 range where I plan to scoop up large and by EOY we should see $35-40 range. There will continue to be a bit of volatility as expected, but it will continue to make gains in 2022. I can’t even think of the next closest competitor in the space, likely C3.ai that’s trading in the 120+ range."
"Oh man, we have a wonderful president why the market keeps going down :))"
I trust cathie!
"Man, if Powell does nothing about the SLR exemption we could see some dramatic swings. Unbelievable."
All those panic shorts are claiming pltr to be the next GME for no reason 
"Cash grew 100% Dec 2019 to Dec 2020. PLTR guidance of $4B will be way short of reality, will be closer to $8B (44% ave growth). Generating over $20B Rev 2021-2025. The CASH holdings will be above $5B by 2025."
Stimulus passes and Palantir will get tons of new government business...

ARK certainly loaded up on PLTR today. Hopefully the value they see starts resurfacing in the stock price.
Hype stock. Without the pumping of Ark it would be worth about $5. Just look at the float.... omg

"I'm $1.3m into team Palintir and 100% confident they are a game-changer. I used their software in the Marines and it helped us gather the data to map, target, and disrupt terrorist networks. Now I am a management consultant for a large business solutions firm, and I have seen the #1 challenge large organizations have is consolidating data from multiple systems, and in disparate formats, and drawing the insights to make executive decisions, without data scientists. What PLTR appears to have created is close to data-management magic. This might drop 30% after the ER, who knows? but it is definitely a game-changer and I have no doubts about their long-term prospects. GLTAL!"
Palantir Technologies I announced Friday its new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system with Amazon cloud service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) will be available to all AWS customers.
Check out Diligent Trades on YouTube for his Palantir Technical analysis. Dude spent $15k on leaps and says it will go up by next earnings
Time to cost average down?
This will fall fast now on the ER

So happy about the insider selling this past week. This dip is a blessing for all young investors. I’m holding 3000 shares and buying another 3000 at close. Goodluck longs
"Bruh! NASDAQ is down almost 3%.... Of course, that's not good! That's life. This will back up soon!"
Looks like shorts are working really hard to move it down but I know they can't and wont be able to stop the stampede.
$100 within 12 months. Thumb up if you think it’s supported.
You can tell this will skyrocket after earnings next week because of the lower price they forced so they can get in because they know it’s going to be good 
"It’s the panic sellers who sold last Thursday and then bought back Friday, now they’re scared again. "
"Kathie Wood doesn't have a crystal ball and she is not the stock goddess. Peter Lynch lost a fortune in the early 2000s, Warren Buffet lost a ton of money by betting against airline stocks last year, George Soros lost nearly $1 billion in 2016. You shouldn't invest in stocks if you are the type of investor who buys a certain stock just because someone (Kathie Wood in this case) bought 500,000 shares of PLTR. You need to do your DD and take advantage of the momentum to make money in the market. Based on my technical analysis, PLTR's next support is at $22-23 and $19.75. Also keep in mind that Kathie Wood's 1.5 million share is nothing compared to 800 millions shares soon to be go on sale."
WSB is no longer playing in PLTR as it has an actual product unlike GME and AMC lol
Vanguard added 1.5 Mil. shares to it's mid-cap growth ETF VOT.
Where’s the Reddit buyers?
anybody else love this stock?
Board full of negativity = Time to buyBoard full of positivity = Time to sell
As I wrote - Judgment Day today -10%.
I betcha it's back to $25 by Thursday (or sooner).
"I give up, sold all shares, really do not like it stays read when market is green."
I see lots of comments mentioning about the shares that were sold by some of the management members. Some people claim that if the company would be more successful why they already sold these share with the cheap prices. All those shares are given to them with the cost of 0 $. They sold them around 26 $ which is 26X up. So I am here to simply ask those people who keeps asking. Would you not sell your shares with 26X ? the reason they sold is not because they do not believe in the company's success.. only because they sold it with 26X profit.
I think Cathie is doing her thing this afternoon! 
"Wow, Cathie bought quite a bit of our PLTR... Palantir Technologies (PLTR) - 3,365,400"
Where are all the shorted people
I wish to all shorts a creative and productive day! Your posts here are every day the same since September! Looking forward
"The fact this held up like this today, whether we finish slightly red or slightly green, is extremely comforting in a time where consistency is hard to find."
"Is our next recession on the horizon with increasing rates, shutting down profitable industries like drilling and oil, and also increase cost of doing business for small businesses by increasing minimum wage to $15? Thoughts?"
This market is an emotional wreck. Filters through the good news to dwell on the bad.
"Picked up 200 more shares here 22.51, at support. Tomorrow will be interesting."
WSB will join the party?
the only stock currently green out of 24 on my watch list....
Am I correct in saying the last 20% of the shares ‘locked up’ will be released today?
just read what may be the best article written by seeking alpha about pltr. it was about valuation and expectations it was in my opinion honest and accurate and I'm pltr or bust
26 lmfao get some vasoline its coming
This is an amazing company for long term. +100$ within 1 year easy
Don't bet against Mama Cathie
Why is it falling!!!!! It needs to break the resistance and go over 25
VIX and PLTR only green today.
When is PLTR next earning date?
At the gym
"A lot of you guys have mentioned that information is ""the new oil!"" And I agree 100%"
If people cant see the manipulation when a stock opens at $29 and hangs in this range despite 150 Million shares trading you are BLIND or short...To have the 10% pre market drop continue to stay steady throughout day despite that volume and VERY bullish guidance tells you all you need to know...This is institutions parking the boss right here given what they heard today is categorically more bullish than even the last earnings call...
been holding 4k shares for quite awhile and won't be selling for at least 5 years.
$26.50 = resistance?
"Trade smart, place sell orders GTC at $65 Prevent short sellers from using your own shares against you"
The 30% guidance for 2021 will be met in Q2 earnings.
"I'm salivating at this buying opportunity, if it keeps dropping, that's a huge buy, if it pops during the day, that's a huge win. either way, it's a win win"
Bought the dip and im almost all-in in PLTR now
It seems that the average volume of 72 million prior to lock up has returned. Does that signal that most of the insider selling is over and we can anticipate continuing 72 million shares traded on average daily.
I'm happy for this weeks result. !!
Just got back in and couldn’t help buying more at these prices. I’m bringing my average up since starting at DPO but that’s ok by me. PLTR is about 13% of my portfolio. I might stretch it to 15% but that’s about it for me.
is this a good stock for long term?
"I have full trust with the CEO and the company, i am holing my stocks tight!!"
"IMHO, PLTR is about as low as it's going to be in the short term. Stochastics look oversold below the 20 mark, there is something close to a bullish pin bar candle, and the 100-day moving average just kicked in and is at about $22.70 and rising. So you have oversold conditions at a longer term moving average and a candle showing bearish sentiment is slowing down and being overcome by bullish sentiment. No promises, I'm not a financial advisor, make your own decisions, but IMHO I think it is more likely the share price has a several dollar increase on Monday than a decrease. Longer term, I hope everything is done with this correction soon but I also get a bonus in March so I wouldn't mind getting a bonus at the bottom of a market correction. How long do corrections usually last?"
Whisper ATI and Facebook contracts
Remember when you bought MSFT at $24? PLTR is deja vu all over again. Thank you Yogi Berra!
Tech up tomorrow Buy Buy Buy PLTR!!!
I got faith keep your heads up 30$ by Friday. 
you can't keep this stock pressurized for a long time. it will jump soon
"I see no comments from anyone on this thread who sound like they have any investing knowledge at all. No legit arguments to own this thing. None. Instead, I see a Bitcoin mentality here. I see people who treat this stock with the same gambler's mentality most people would have while playing the state education lottery, or playing slots. Take your money and go to Vegas. You may have a chance of getting rich there. It's not going to happen on this bet."
Have you guys seen the open interest on the $26 call for this Friday 3/5?
this is obviously gonna blast off I'm buying more here
"This is being led purely by algos and not actively-trading pros. Which makes the risk / reward risky prior to earning. Depending on movement after Powell on Wednesday, I may sit it cash for a while."
With all news it should be around 45 now 
It is becoming more stable! And soon to da moon!
go on whale wisdom and look at the 13F filings for Palantir from yesterday. Do with that knowledge what you will
I get all of the long term talk but honest people will admit that it’s disappointing for the market to have been up all 3 days this week while we have been down each of them. Come on already and give us a good green day.
"After Hours it was all PLTR on CNBC! First on Options Action where the whole panel was bullish - and lots of bullish options activity. They also featured an entire segment with the founder of Thinknum, an alternative data company that tracks trending companies on Reddit's Wallstreetbets - and apparently PLTR chatter is up 30% yesterday. Could be the next Reddit darling (for better or worse). Lots of these players love PLTR and anticipate a big pop."
Well someone got pumped up by YouTubers and now holding the bags? Like #cciv*this is for entertainment purposes only
"Investors in Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Apr 16, 2021 $65.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today."
Ark bought another 2.5 million shares
"Thanks to whoever sold me their shares at $24.50. There’s always panic sellers out there. Going golfing. Have a great day. Oh yea, just mute the "
"True longs cannot lose tomorrow. If it goes up, great, if it goes down, buy. This is one of many ERs."
65M in 1st 3mins!!!!
"I hope everyone $ cost averaged down today. Here's how it works. Everyone on this board is an individual investor. The Pro's goal who works for the hedge funds take advantage of chaos in the markets. If they unload millions of Palantir stock, it can really move a stock down. This causes the individual investors to panic and then the bots take over and drive it down further. However, when there is blood in the streets, this is when you need to buy. By the time the market closes today, Palantir will almost be back over $23 and the Pro's win again."
"Can someone explain to us how the WallStreetBets crowd can make PLTR go To The Moon?This is what I was able to learn from the GameStop drama:It seems that WSB geniuses were able to buy GameStop stock cheap and HOLD it in order to LIMIT the available GameStop stocks. In other words, Less available GameStop stock = Higher PriceHOWEVER, the PLTR stocks that are available to the public = 1.07 BILLION stocksSo, the WallStreetBets crowd doesn't have enough people and/or assets to buy and hold PLTR and make it a ""scarce commodity"" = PLTR stock can go up to $250 like GameStop?"
Congrats to the strong holders and everyone who topped up yesterday.Cathie Woods endorsement is the only thing that needs to be said today.
"PLTR is a growth stock that won’t be affected by yields. In 3-5 years this will be $250-300 per share, $500bn company."
Buy the dip. This is only way to have profit in future.
Take off!!! Automotive partnership!!! Flyyy to mooonnn!!! Let's goooo!!!
Palantir is now the go to place for big corporations to save millions of dollars and it's working. This ship is going to sail.
I’m selling now tomorrow will be disaster
Thumbs up if you honestly think we end green today.
US Stimulus package that passed on the weekend will put more pressure on teck stocks this week for sure. Don’t be surprised to see an other dive in the next couple of sessions.
buy and hold and sit back and watch it grow for the next 10 years+

Boys and Girls: The TECH stocks are now turning GREEN...
Leaked video from an hour ago.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc2LEsNtm10They're aiming at Salesforce's market share.
"My fellow PLTR comrades,It seems that between 9:30 am to 10:30 am, there is a lot of PLTR stock price fluctuationsMany commentators seem to make PROFITS by selling HIGH between 9:30 am and 10:30amat the same time, there are many other commentators who BUY LOW during the 9:30 am to 10:30 am timeframeI understand that it's HARD to time the market, but is there a SECRET ART on when to sell HIGH and buy LOW...In may case, I obviously want to hold until the mid 30's or 40's at least (depending on what PLTR good news and contracts are coming)HOWEVER, in my specific case, looking at the charts, my portfolio is currently GREEN, and there were at least 3 chances, in the last 5 days, to SELL and make PROFIT... then I could have bought LOW again and I will still be ahead...It seems that BUY LOW and SELL HIGH is an art for some traders with GUTS...Please provide simple insights on how to maximize profits using the BUY LOW and SELL HIGH strategy.Peace!"
$29 and $30 are the resistance right now. Support seems to be holding at around $28.60
How about a -10% today? Huh?
Should we be panicking? Great numbers and we are red?
"As I’ve been preaching for months (go ahead and check ), remain patient.Nobody can predict the short term movements of PLTR, you see “too the moon” and “on its way to $5” every day, all full of .This is a long term play. Buy the dips, hold when others panic, thank me later.I know a lot of people’s portfolios are tech heavy nowadays and are hurting, hell my portfolios hurting since February 9th, doesn’t matter in the long term.Sit back, relax, and accept the volatility for what it is."
I smell 30’s this week
"If bashers are so confident that this stock is in a bubble and will crash immediately, why aren't they taking out loans to short this and make easy money?"

"Soros Fund Management, which revealed in November it began investing in Palantir in 2012 and owned 18.46 million shares, has said it will sell for ethical reasons. The firm said at the time that it had sold all it was able to and “will continue to sell shares as permitted.”"
dare i say 35+ tomorrow. bond yields retreating. lockup over. earnings good. jnj vaccine approved further fueling positive economic outlook. looks good to me

What’s with the after hours activity
Bets against PLTR are closing in AH today
Goldman upgrades Palantir !
this product is not tangible to the average consumer. This is a B2B product. What you guys have is Cathie Wood and wall street bets to keep this going. Wall street bets being the bigger contributor to help prop this palantir up. Long run this is going up. FOR SURE. It's going to be a looooooooooooong run though. Like I said this is going nowhere and when it goes nowhere it trades sideways and downwards.
just patience !
PLTR = the new TSLA
the stock mkt is coming to an end soon...
The whole market is down. I blame GME.

WALLSTREETBETS are monitoring this stock, so please short it so they can take another billion dollars from you. It warms my heart to see you suffer such massive losses, KARMA a @#$&."
The new partnership will be a really big deal. Imo
"For the new guys around (shorts), This stock had bounced multiple times 40-50% up in 1 week easy.Its gonna bounce soon and Aunt Cathie knows it that's why she keep loading up.Follow the money not the clowns. Recovery is coming soon."
Holding until $300...PLTR will establish a whole way of valuation in time.
This selloff will make selling after lockup less attractive.
I'm down -27% on Palantir which is only about 50 bucks thank god i did not put more money into this.

Hi Palantir Investors Does anyone have an intelligent and professional explanation for the stock's behavior yesterday? Sharp decline during trading and pre-closing correction?
Who's adding shares today??
It's also a RED DAY so this selling is expected since most of the market is. so in other words this is on sale and load up while you can!
Nasdaq futures reversal spike off double bottom. 10 year retreating. 10 year step up not ominous. Bullish long term for markets (the bond bears know it because it is basic market theory). Inflation is GOOD in economics. Too bad the low IQ’d commenters on this thread understand the game worse than I crochet (I‘ve never crocheted). Sorry. Sleep tight and wake up early if you‘re short. Real early. Ferarri going to be fun when it hits its straightaway. Adios Pelota
Plummeting to $24 now....
They need to meet growth expectations provided last quarter with path to profitability. If that happens during the next earnings the upward momentum starts. If not we move down further.
"I saw Catherine Wood interview today. I really like her and her 40 years of experience in this industry. . My advice to those who want to buy this stock to wait for signs of short squeeze to get in as we don’t know how low it could get. My warning to shorts is, having seen her interview and her prospects of PLTR, i warn shorts, don’t mess with Catherine Wood!"
"It can close now, I'm happy with this price today!"

What’s powering this move up? Not complaining but don’t see news.
I’m buying the “upcoming” dip — obviously
So many etf’s added pltr in funds.
I have never been so sure on a stock until now!! I have decided to hold all my 1.2 k shares also after the lock-up!! There is a high chance that they will announce Facebook between 16-19 so the institutions will buy more and nobody will sell!! Think about this..
ARKW - went from 4.04 million to 4.15 shares. I believe they added today on the dip
Today +29$

How long until we $45 a share again?
"Many have been saying that we will see 20 soon... I believe that it depends of today's chart. If it ends between - 2% and +1 %, believe that we will see it reaching 20s. If wee see a jump over +5% well, hehehhe! My friend! We will reach 40s soon!"
GUYS ITS GREEN

CATHY WOOD IN THE NEWS!
This is getting into bear territory. Everyone might just have to hunker down and wait it out. Averaging down might not be the wisest choice at the moment.
"Hmmm. ARK holding 2.4M+ PLTR in their Next Gen Internet ETF. They loving throwing away money over there, don't they?"

If only it was not correlated with the nasdaq etc. it would have been already 50 usd.
Stock market is the only place where when something goes on sale. Everybody runs away.
Cathie Wood Thinks PLTR is The Next TSLA - Just Bought 5 Million Shares!
Be careful with this market. We lost our market cheerleader and this administration is extremely depressing. Wall Street is trying to get rid of the retail investor. Hold or stay out for awhile.
Crammer Lol! You can tell that he is really jealous of Cathie Wood's success.
"Sorry, but the down trend continues. Wait 'til it reaches $11, then buy."

Why would anyone think this is some sort of bottom and accumulate shares at this level? PLTR is showing weakness and a dip into the teens is not out of the question.
This is a 3 year hold minimum stock
I don't know what's harder - holding throughout the past month or no-nut November.

"My fellow PLTR holders,I have been watching PLTR Pre-market and I noticed a few strange behaviors:1. There are MANY trades where people are buying ONLY ONE SHARE of PLTR2. There are MANY trades where people are buying 5 shares of PLTR3. There are hundreds of trades where people are buying less than 50 shares of PLTRQuestion:It seems that the people who buy just ONE SHARE of PLTR are paying a ""higher price"" ON PURPOSE in order to somehow TRICK the market that PLTR should trade higher in the $24 range...Are the PROS using this ONE SHARE trades as a TRICK to manipulate the share price?Peace!"
everyone buy NOW u are missing out on a buy like apple but way better. this is gonna go to 400 in 5 years BUY NOW

Well that was an eventful day.

"As I said before, Facebook and Apple are now recruiting people with skills in palantir. It might mean something. I truelly belive that Facebook will use Palantir services soon.

Congrats dip buyers!
"As a long time investor, I can go back to early days of Microsoft and Google and their first earnings call after IPO was nowhere near as upbeat and positive as what we're hearing today on PLTR first full year call after DPO.This to me is a very strong BUY and will turn green later this morning and upgrades will start coming in!!"

If you have some knowledge we all know this will hit 40-50 this year.
Hey guys. Where do you guys go to see ARK’s daily acquisition of shares?

when you wake up tomorrow and the nasdaqis 13000 premarket you're done if you are out of the nasdaq 100 watch and learn.......... nighty night see you all in the morning chasing down the smart herd of investors!
Notice how Amazon and other software giants are scrambling to secure government contracts. Palantir already has those locked in.
Teaming up with AWS is huge!
Let’s be honest. We all saw this coming. Believe in the company long term and this will be a blip
I love investing in companies that have great CEO’s like Karp and Musk. Hence why my portfolio is 60% PLTR and 40% Tesla. I like investing in winners.
Bought 9 calls for a break even price of $39.....good idea or no
will buy at 20... I find this to high.
"Follow the money people, not the "
Clearly there’s some big players loading up on shares today. Otherwise we’d be red just like everyone else
You want price to keep going up? Pretty easy... STOP SELLING for some penny gains and high taxes..
Could this go any lower? Or was that the dip?
3m deal shows you what’s going on. ... pltr once it’s in your company it can never leave. Gold mine.
In my list of 60 stocks. PLTR is the only one positive.
"Big buyer at $25; however, when they're done buying look out below. Meanwhile, the insiders are still selling."
I need to lower my near-term expectations for PLTR not to be disappointed over and over again every day...
"Both Steve Cohen and Peter Thiel, who are multi-billionaires, sold large quantities of their shares between 25-29 given how “broke” they are. The message theynsent was SELL."

What’s Next: Palantir has been working with AWS over the past year on a number of different projects and believes companies that adopt its new ERP Suite will be quick to see results.“Within two weeks of installing the ERP Suite, BP was able to unlock approximately $50 million in working capital and has the potential to unlock further savings if applied across their worldwide supply chain,” the company said.The ERP suite is now available for all AWS customers and can be deployed within days."
Price predictions for tomorrow?
So.. would’ve been profitable if they didn’t pay out a HUGE amount back in stock compensation? So they based a loss. Wth??

"Karp should do more interviews for sure, people still don’t know much about what they do"

Palantir is about investing instead of trading. Let’s see the price in May or December!In 2022 or 2025?Lo-lo-long Hold and we will be rewarded ;)
I'm officially own 2K shares of PLTR again! 1K at $25 and 1K at $22.84. It will spike up to $31-$33 when the trend is back up.... if it hold on it will go to $50. Diamond hand is back!
Lock up expiry will yield little in terms of movement. Early investors are often smart investors. Smart investors don't sell shares at 40 when they know time will fetch triple digits or better. These are not hourly workers that need the cash.
Is this going back up to $30 anytime soon?
The loss has decreased from 29 cent per share to 8 cent per share in one year. The Q1 revenue is expected to rise by 45%. No way I sell a single share of a company with such amazing progress.
wow i think we actually slowed this down on the downside so lets get up
Great comeback even after all the negative news.
"Up in pre market by 6%. Mind you, pre market is pure manipulation but quietly confident"
"As much as I love PLTR, I had to sell some. I mean tsla is below 600......I had to do it."

Ok who do I thank today for selling me their shares for $24.12?
"how can you not trust arkk and Cathie by now, she's got my money"
if you bought yesterday @24.99 please thumbs up
"Ark is the reason for everyone who owns PLTR became poor and PLTR employees got rich. On the day of expiry, Ark buys large number of shares pumping the stock up, raising everyones hope for a higher price, buying more, yet PLTR employees enjoyed the hike in the price and sold driving the price down. Everyone under the sun knew the stock will take a big hit, but they listened to her because supposedly she knows her stuff well."
Don’t worry aboutGreen today 
"The captain has turned on the fasten seatbelt sign. Relax and remember that if you own 1000 shares, unless you sell you will still own 1000 shares. Good luck."
Need opinions: should I buy PLTR as CFD or just equity? I mean should I go long on CFD? Never used CFDs.
How low can we go
Did Cathie bail on this stock? Seems so Bearish all of a sudden

"i bought more, thank you newbies."
It would help if someone could contextualize how meaningful PLTRs contracts are with IBM and Amazon. And explain how it translates to revenue. I know Alex is setting this up for monster gains as they sweep into the commercial sector. But it needs context. No reason this should be in the low 20s because their bread & butter isn't tech - it's B2B - including value stocks which will benefit from a strong economy with the help of PLTR.

Palantir DPO'd at 17 Billion out of pure generosity to retail investors and these Wallstreet crooks could have loaded up like I did. Why do you need intelligence when you have a ton of cash, financial weapons of mass destruction, and an algo time machine that just bum rushes at their time of choosing..."
"$25.08 is the bottom, this could shoot up at any stage and back to $29 within a few hours. I have shared every one of my buys of Palantir since started at $9.90 and I have added more today and last week when it was at $25. ARK has identified the bottom here and I am happy with that assessment too.Insiders have sold a very small percentage of their holdings and I would too if I held for many years in a company I have contributed so heavily to.Do not wait for this to drop below $25 because I personally do not see it happening.Remember, you are buying the company, the product and the management. Pal has a monopoly and it is the future.See you guys back at $45 shortly"

"Everything that Peter Thiel touches turns to gold - PayPal, Facebook and Tesla.Palantir will be the greatest of them all."
"This is a great LONG term investment, but is WILL trade between the $18 to $30 range until the next quarter. People stating it will shoot up to $40 - $50 in the next couple of weeks are dreaming. If that's the case, don't you think insider would have held it for a bit longer? Again, it may pop to $30, but can easily drop down to the high teens with negative economic events. The first quarter that shows strong growth will almost certain propel this above $80. But, it could take 2 more quarters at minimum."
"Thanks for the discounted shares...In for another 1,000"
"Ok, who do I thank for selling me your shares at $27.60? Don’t be shy. Chime in."
The lock out period ends in three days is that true?
"Market is having a tough time and so too are most stocks. Technology sector being the most popular is even down. We are in the middle of a correction and this is normal and the perfect time to load up on stocks, especially stocks you see as long term investments which PLTR is suited for. Any short term gain stocks are a no-go unless you get lucky. There could always be a rebound for us worried investors to be happy about, we just don’t know when or how long this correction will last and when our stock picks will follow up. Either way don’t panic and think you made a bad choice. We will see PLTR and all these other stocks rise up and rise up quick. We just play the waiting game"
I am a certified bag  holder. please go green tommorow.

Look at this little gem the whole market is down and this is green. it sector especially down and it's holding this line that means it's a great investment.

This is the last chance before surging above 30 all the sudden!
Verizon and AT&T possible deals ....
My first post. Bought 1000 shares last week at $24.5. Sold DIS and AAPL for PLTR. 30-40 before July?
"Great technology, badass attitude and even outrageous hairstyle, you’ve got to invest in that"
"This could be the best investment of 2021. Come back in January next year and find it over $100. It bounces around, it goes up, it bounces around some more then goes up some more. People will call it a missed opportunity."
PLTR seems to be gaining momentum. First it catches the eye of Cathy Wood from Ark Investment and she purchased millions of shares consistently for ARKW & just recently 5.2 million shares for ARKK. Goldman Sachs increased PLTR to a buy rating with a price target of $34. Then JP Morgan Chase bought 19 million shares. Anything else I missed?
probably more share will be sold the coming month by more company top people
"Funny how these longs are soooo excited that PLTR went up today and only recovered what it lost yesterday. And it took the Nasdaq to go up over 450 pts to make it happen, LOL. If it goes up that much every day for a week, they have a chance of hitting 30...maybe."
"Someone that explain why this stock is down when nasqad is up I saw Tesla, NIo and other texh stocks are down thanks"
PLTR has been outperforming NASDAQ for several days. Passed inflection point!
"I believe what we are seeing is a tax season sell off. There are a lot of people who entered the market this year and made some money, and now that its tax filing season, they are realizing that they owe taxes, and the only way to pay them is to sell some stock."
"Shorts, quick! Time is running out for your prescient, ever wrong comments!"
40M in the 1st 30min...impressive
Bears don't understand PLTR business and potential!
"Invest into the future, money will come back to tech bcos the post pandemic world will only be driven by tech."
Why down ?
"If you're a true long, the best thing to happen was PLTR to miss on its earnings. If they beat, the stock would just be frothy and lockup shareholders would feel compelled to sell and shorts would short en masse.PLTR is growing revenues at a extremely quick pace, and that is what matters. 30.00 bucks seems just rightfor the time being with lots of upside on the horizon. For all intents and purposes, this is a brand new, young company, that has refined its products. What a client list!"
in at 37 with 2000 shares will be holding it till 75.
this could be multi day thing better get out buy back 17 or 15
"As of tomorrow my portfolio will be 100% Palantir, 1340 shares all in, they say don’t put all your eggs in one basket but never been so addicted to a stock!! 5-10 years hold to be mortgage free"
longs will have to hold the bag for LOOOOOOOONG time
"Long term investors know that an investment in PLTR is an investment in US national security and in top tier US companies. No reason to sell but excellent opportunity to buy the dip. PLTR will be a giant in the defense, government, and private sectors"
oil shock
10 Minutes for a run to $25 Call holders. This would be a WSB legend. But GME is their god.
talk about resistance level...
I added wish we could get a dip to buy longer .
"Remember, investors have options to sell at $45-$50. Shorts don’t have much option. They have to cover! Good luck shorts."
"Didn't have the balls to buy the dip when it dropped to 21. Lesson learned, always listen to Cathie mama and never look back."

I love how this slowly grows. I’m not made of millions but this stock let’s me buy in gradually as pay days come. Everyday I expect a huge spike and count my lucky stars I can buy in at the mid 30’s range

"Palantir is the new Tesla. Tom nash bought it, Kevin bought it, chicken genius bought it, Cathy woods bought it. All mentioning that they found some leaked data and detailed research on the company. Amazon, IBM, 3M partner Palantir within weeks, there must be something out there that is yet to announce. Everyone is afraid to invest because they do not really know and understand Palantir fundamentals, but if wait till you would understand it, the price would be at hundreds as layman will would invest in it and it’s too late. Give a thought, the feds invested in Palantir for 13 years, 13years ago I’m only 20 years old! Palantir is The Best Bet you could take it on now. Just imagine with 500 shares and per share is $400. Just imagine."
"Catalyst 1 q 2021 forecasts 45% growth yoy , back to $40"
Anyone thinks this might go below 20 by next week?
team up with AWS and this is falling almost 6%...
I have an average of 21 USD and held all the way from 45 until now. No weak hands let's go!
Its gonna be $100 soon after..
Looks like investors are buying the dip!
if you listen to cramer and base your investing decisions on his advice them oh boy circus medrano will happily hire you congrats !!!!
can't believe $ocgn recovered back to premarket drop while $PLTR $BNGO $NNDM Tanked hard and in a state of injury.
22.50 a good entry point
bought 250 at 10 and 250 at 43.51.......... and some iin between total of 527 shares!!! this hurts!!! butIM NOT LEAVING
Oh $pltr will be $90 EOY!
"What’s up with the volatility of the 10 year Treasury? It is hitting this market hard, especially Nasdaq/tech stocks."
"Only PLTR is green today50 %of portfolio goneJust wandering, how long it will continue? Why is taking profit?There is no profit anymore"
What do y’all think about Monday? 
"Foundry could go to personal besides business. Individuals are facing more and more data created everyday, one needs a powerful software to analyze the data to make personal decisions daily yet protect privacy, the business potential is up to the sky."
this is at the prices it was back in like DEC.....before the IBM and a few other deals....think about that.gonna be a great week
Forget about individual stocks. If you are panicking during this market correction. You should probably not trade at all.
"Reddit is behind the stock per CNBC!! Sit back, hold your shares and enjoy the ride!"
Volume is decreasing...
"How many people think when PLTR starts moving, it will move up fast $5-10?"
anyone knows why the stock jumped up 1 dollar this am ?
I have more cash ready. Who’s going to sell me their shares this morning?
I think this is undervalued. I’m in for 500 shares.
im still holding
is aunty Cathie buying today. any news?
The Best US Stock for the 21 Century.
Good news coming at 3:30pm today...
IM 23 AND CATHY WOODS IS HOT. THERE I SAID IT!
Everyone knows this stock is gonna be a winner. Don't chicken out and sell unless you need to feed your kids. Why pay the high taxes for holding less than a year? People who think they'll buy back in later invariably buy back in a higher prices. Don't think too much.
seller right now will be tearing out their hair later
"Thinking of buying 3000 shares here. My question is, for experienced to traders, Am I better off waiting until after earnings and the lock up.? How many new shares will be available After the lock up.? Thanks in advance for any intelligent responses."
"Just like EVERY stock I have positions in, and have had positions in for a long time (newer to Palantir) - wake me up in 3 years lol. Never have I ever let random people on a message board determine my view on a company, and thats why I continue to win. Palantir wont be any different."
Get you some of that Cathy Wood special lol.
this is the only thing on wsb that makes sense.
"It dips more, I say ""Thanks God, Im out till $15."""
"In 5 years this is going to be over $100B company....The value of company is tremendous especially when you see it is an operating system for data, analytics, AI, etc. I think that analysts are not able to understand it and evaluate it properly due to not only technical understanding but also market industry fit...It is difficult to understand that a company that started for government in the US, can be both global and support all other industry segments (where i see revenue exponentially growing over the next 5 years. I think that next 3-5 Q may be not as strong, but from there it will beat any expectations. Buy and hold..."
Are we going to have a squeeze on PLTR with wokians having to cover their shorts before this takes off next week? I think we could ...
Be ready !Tomorrow another squeeze Big winner tomorrow 
"Governments and companies with global footprints are hiring Palantir. I believe they will successfully scale globally, in multiple sectors. Proof will rely on their numbers. We shall see."
"Big thank you to crooked market and scared retail...While I have not been in love with the timing of some of my adds to my position...$37, $33, $29, $27, $25, $24...At the end of the day NONE of this matters in the long run and I should consider myself blessed to have added at any of those prices...Had this remained at $45 or above there's no telling where or if I'd have added given the run up... Started my position at $10 have 4x the shares at an average of $20....See you at $200 and beyond...Will look back to these days and realize we wasted our time lamenting vs finding ways to pump more cash in...This is not a pump, the company is as rock solid as any business in the market..Short term bashers know that, but they're here to screw with you during these fluctuations and we always knew they'd show up hard in and around lock period...Bravo to them! My position will teach me about a new decimal point the moment this hits $112 per share, then we'll see who is laughing...Stay strong brothers!"
The stocks goes down 6% and everyone is panicking. You all need to relax. If it goes up 6% everyone is hyped. This is long term play. Relax and hold and enjoy the ride.
omg wasnt even a normal.blip up..how dmaGed did krusty do
Two reasons why we dropped this past week. One is our corporate wxecs are brilliant people and they made millions by selling. So what? The second reason a more serious concern which is market stability. Honestly I’m out after the Stimulus bump
Be patient! The smart insiders waited until after Day 1 of the lockup to start selling. The next few weeks are likely going to be sprinkled with sellers. Some will wait until it doubles again. None of this will change PLTR's final destination of $1k+. Holding 2500+ strong!
buy and hold monday $40 news coming soon
Cathie Wood is losing millions on $TSLA and she will lose millions on this too. Most overrated investor in the history of the stock market.
Wow I’m bag holding at 41 fml
"hope you longholders have a strong stomach, no stop losses and no margin."
you guys do realize nasdaq futures is manipulated right to drive sentiment. hedge funds have large stakes in or out of something and they can drop a couple shares in the futures market to make you think it goes in a certain direction. jim cramer is well aware of this manipulation as he's done it himself.
@Jing Ren $22.50 on the chart (Dec 2020) before a strong quarter in (Feb 2021) confirms the value is there. We are bottomed out. Talk without a thesis beyond UP/DOWN is cheap.
"Karp tried his best to message the growth story over the next two years, the media disinformation, the freedom to be a critic elsewhere. Buy or live in regret."
$GME is fun. Keep pumping! But also consider $PLTR for a long term play
Bought 100 @ 24.18 lets see
"So, same old same old:Spike in bond yields = FEAR in stocks = PLTR DOWN...Is there a mathematical formula to this logic?Peace!"
Long term hold
"So much good news and this stock still can't get into high gear,some hedge fund is stepping on it."
I bought SBUX so many years ago at 10 a share and now 104...Thats how you profit..Let Planter sink to mid teens and sit on it...Dont panic!!!@
"in trust we Peter Theil. Airbnb is not profitable but it's a monopoly. Palantir is creating a Monopoly , I don't wanna Miss out on Gain. I'm willing to hold the bag for now. average price $29. I'm not selling will be adding more if it goes down more."
Cathy just added 3.4m shares of Palantir today. Honestly think that we're up from now.
ARK bought more = I buy more
every time i buy in the 24s it drops 
Going to gracefully bounce back this week.
Who bought the dip... again? Picked myself up 250 more
i will hold for 30 years idc! diamond hands mightt give all my shares to my grandson when im 90 and have him give it to his kids!!!!
Still holding since September.Long for 2 years my firends!!!
800 shares today at the close. Up from here.
I hope Vanguard decides to add PLTR to VTI fund .
"I don't think we can expect the same volatility as before the Lockup expiration.the float is now HUGE, it's very hard to move the price.unfortunately 40$ is many months away, if not yearsI have 2000 shares @ $10.5 which I did not sell @$40.beating my self.."
someone bought big shares this morning
I'm actually depressed. Time for an 8ball and escorts.
2500 IBM Professionals started promoting PLTR software today........ Worldwide..
My portfolio = 60% PLTR 40% Tesla 
Laughable how hard hedge funds and big banks trading teams are working to keep price from gapping higher. How many margin calls can we pick up before we ALL decide to let‘s it‘s TRUE market value occur?What a sad job they have. Create an illusion and fail at it. Fortunate to be independent and pick winners without being corrupted by greedy short hogs who shall get slaughtered like last time. Oops last two times. Fact. Chicken DinnerSee you en el caribe
after watching cNBC. it's obvious Kramer and others are conspiring to run down the NASDAQ stocks especially stocks like palantir that Kathy wood owns. they're now trying to tear her down by saying shes dumping money in certain stocks that are down because retail investors are chasing what she's buying and she's just trying to keep her ark investment numbers up. and they are pretty much saying that she is going to fail. sounds to me like Kramer and CNBC are working for the short hedge funds
Longs be like 
pltr look good now buy it forever its going to 24.68 for sure on monday
"Cathy is the same person who predicted Tesla hitting 3,000$ pre split. And look what happened to Tesla. That’s good enough for me."
We will open $123.34

Buy buy buy !!
Let’s bottom line this. The whole goal in doing a DPO is to convert 17 years own ownership into currency. That’s it. How else would they achieve their goal? By holding another 17 years? Get real people.
"Yeah right... keep ignoring back to back deals of hundreds of million, like the one with Amazon, and listen to Cramer, meme traders."
what time today will go back to $36 ?
Added 100 shares on this dip.
Cramer who? He ones said TSLA is over valued when it was 500 dollars before the split . 
32 open....squeeze
"Yes! Buy order went through at $23. Ok I’m done buying for today. Going golfing, see you all tomorrow. Thanks for your shares."
"Not sure if we have reached a point of capitulation yet. When the pump stops having an effect, my history shows that it typically results in a slow leak as we have a new round of price discovery."
Now is the time to buy bought 10k
"All PLTR investors should keep quiet. Real investors want the price to go down, so you can buy more. Quietly ARK hoovered up another $60m worth yesterday.The experienced will make a killing in this market correction (it is not a crash). The new should learn from it."
Buy the stock
Next Week they will sign the big contract we will see $ 30 easyWatch it
Here we go As soon as I buy it’s drops Who care it will be 200$ in 2-3 years!!!Stay long my friends
"just bought 4000 shares ,i can smell rally soon"
"Palantir is going to be among the big public companies in its niche likes of Netflix, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, IBM. Oracle. Apple, Facebook. I think within 5 years from now it will transform ""FAANG STOCKS into ""FAPANG!"""
"Most tech stocks are down today, don’t let the clowns get to you. They are just after your shares. Ignore or mute works a treat"

Lift off to happen any day in next 2 weeks
I mentioned and was flamed that balancing your holdings with a couple of banks would provide a hedge. FITB bac wfc key.
My PLTR net is in green. But I won’t sell. You know what hands  I have got.
Tiger-Speedy recovery.PLTR-30-32 by Fri.Now lets make it happen.
Look what they did to Apple the last 10 minutes of trade. 17 Billion share float just algo'd to opening price in the last 10 min. Unreal and fake.
"Let's not forget that PLTR closed above $30 for 16 straight trading days in a row from Jan 22 through Feb 12. February 12th was just last Friday. As recently as this Tuesday it was also trading above $30. Since Jan 22, we've really only had three trading days (this Weds, Thurs, and Fri) in which PLTR has traded consistently in the $20s. Today's test of $30 and its closing price of $29 are very positive signs that it's on its way back to the $30s."
I love the company but the valuation is ...
Just entered my first position in palantit with 6500 shares. BEO will be 120 per share.
PLTR is the unique game changer which solves the problem world can’t!steady government endorsementunlimited commercial roof to skyrocket!
We no need shorts here go somewhere else shorts this stock is not for ya
Before the end of March this will go up to 40s mark my bloody word!

"Don't be surprised if all institutions are selling including Ark. They made tons of money,"
PLTR up up up...another good DD videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_Z5DG3eC3Y
Tasty tasty end of session dip. Thanks panic sellers. I’m ready for tomorrow however it goes. Always have cash available in your portfolio kids.
"Why buy any stocks right now, everyone knows the 10 year yield is going up and how stocks react particularly in tech. Wait until the yield rises to 2.5% then stabilizes or you're gonna get rekt."
Another institution might buy this dip after hours.
My hair looks like Alex Karp's after this week.
"Stop crying, nobody cares .. most of us here are down 20k-30k but were also up 20k-30k few weeks ago"
"I thought 20 would be bottom , but the Tech correction is not over . Looks like new Target is 15."
is palantir signing another contract with verizon or at&t or is it just the rumor spreading around just to pump it up? lol....
5.2m more shares for ARKK today
ARKW purchased 1560200 shares today...
"I dont understand the lockup period. As far as I can see, the insiders have already sold $530 million worth of shares in the last few months"
only stock in ARK ETF that's green.
"All of this media exposure will create interest in both government and private sector corporations. In addition to being tied to a strategic relationship with IBM. This will significantly have an impact on growing revenues, and, improved margins going forward. Just understand the dynamics as you invest wisely."
Palantir will be as big as Microsoft in 10 yrs.
"I adjusted my portfolio to capitalise on the market pullback. I sold 1/3 of my CCIV shares and invested them in $STPK $SFTW $PLTR $VACQ $CTXR $SPFR and $HITIFThe way I see it, if CCIV moves up I make a lot of money. if Lucid goes low 20’s / High 10’s I buy in large with my profits from the above high growth stocks.Win WinDiversification is King.A huge believer in Lucid, haven’t loved a company this much in a very long time.P.S. I also believe $SPFR could be merging with Tonal. (This is from personal DD and no official / unofficial rumours have been confirmed)"

the downforce is strong
"Lol @ everybody who stresses every little period of green/red days so much.Been holding since $9.45 and I’ve watched people claim “  SELL” & “to the moon  by next week” every day.Reality is this is a slow and steady position to hold and forget for the next 5 years, anybody who tells you different is full of it.Nobody can definitively predict this market, especially in its current state.So sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride. Patience is a virtue, but it’s everything in the stock market/investing game. As you saw with GME, big money counts on your impatience and short-sighted buying/selling for measly gains.A little red day is just as irrelevant in 5 years as a Green Day or week."
JPMorgan reported 19+ million shares in PLTR... how about that bieatches...
i thought that was pretty amazing! also very positive feedback from all analysts! feeling super bullish!
"Wellness check. How are all the people saying they are going to buy back under $20, $15, $12 yesterday doing?"

"My fellow PLTR investors, 1. PLTR is teaming up with AWS.2. AWS = Amazon Web Services 3. What is AWS?4. Answer: If a private company wants to rent computers. They go to AWS and rent them by the minute, hour, etc...5. If a company wants to rent a service such as database or storage space for their massive files, they rent it from AWS6. Finally, AWS offers ANALYTICS services as well7. Since Palantir deals with data analytics, it makes sense to team up with AWS to use the many AWS services and help generate REVENUE using the millions of companies who are also using AWS services 8. Imagine if Palantir SERVICE is sold as another ""standard service"" by the existing AWS service framework.9. Maybe some of the Palantir services require massive computers and databases and storage. So, AWS is an ideal ONE STOP SHOP...10. Feel free to add/correct any of the above points...I hope this helps my PLTR homies..."
$100 today...
stock just got upgraded to 40$$
Hi guys Im new in palantir I just moved from tesla to palatir I bought 1100 share now

"“All that is gold does not glitter,Not all those who wander are lost;The old that is strong does not wither,Deep roots are not reached by the frost.From the ashes a fire shall be woken,A light from the shadows shall spring;Renewed shall be blade that was broken,The crownless again shall be king.”The frost was temporary, the fire is soon to be woken."
Institutional ownership now up to 21.9% and climbing
That’s not cool compare PLTR to GME as WSB. This is great company and has good fundamentals. Oh well market can say whatever but we know better.
"If there is a short squeeze, how high will it go?"
PLTR coming up on CNBC right now. Karp is a genius. Think Steve Jobs but for Enterprise Software. Take a look! (3 PM ET now)
We like the stonk and we have vanguard and cathy woods.
Pay close attention to the spin doctoring over Snowflake and learn how they scam. Are we worth 70 Billion in comparison? Pretty clear we are now. Cramer should answer angry investors for pumping it so sky high.
Easy hold. Sorry shorts but you bet wrong.
haha look at me i actually looked at their financials for once....they have a lot of selling and r and d expenses as well as.admin expenses with only 2 billion in cash...theyll burn that in two years if they cant get costs under control...ill dig deeper but from i can see they need a real financial dude in their not thisnsankar he knows they can be gone in w yrs so orobably why he sold the boat....i guess you have to believe theh gonna reign in costs soon or theh gotta charge more. this is not like money loosjng uber is it..shouldnt people pay if they buy a service and why is pltr selling services at a loss..absokutely make no sense to me unless they gonna start selling subs
"Tomorrow the question will be ""Who bought the dip yesterday?"""
This quite a unique software play. PLTR uses high quality datasets for it'sbreakthrough software resulting in outstanding results. This company is very wellpositioned for the future.
"I'm begging this doesn't go higher than $25 until next Monday. I get paid next Monday so plan to buy more then and I'm feeling gutted I wasn't able to load up/DCA when it was in low $20s.Regardless, I am long and bullish on this stock. And I expect lots of volatility on the way."
Look up wallet investor and type in PLTR. Never knew there was a website that predicts stock prices. After 5 years? Estimate PLTR @ $421. I wouldn't be too surprised if it even beat that.
Imagine selling PLTR yesterday.. oups
I thought things would steady after the bottoming out on Friday and lead to a good week. Sure doesn’t look that way though in the futures market. May be a here we go again type of day.
Market begining to reverse already!!
"Karp has a rare personality type, he's able to see concepts and connections others can't, on abstraction levels few can even fathom, which allows him to ""see"" far into the future with high accuracy. He is also guided by strong convictions not easily swayed by day to day concerns like shareholder sentiment, which is positive. To normal people, this easily comes of as unhinged or arrogant. To me, everything he says resonates deeply and I would follow the guy off a cliff. Of course there are obvious drawbacks - if not constantly fact-checked, these guys end up chasing chemtrails and blaming the govt for 9/11, and the only way to really tell the difference is to look at their history - are they delivering on their grand visions? Well, with PLTR, the answer is a resounding ""yes"", they are frigging changing the world to the better already (finding Bin Laden??). The only thing you can know is that what happened ten years ago, Karp figured out 20 years ago. So everything that's happening now is part of a plan, and I'm going to sit back, drink a few martinis, and enjoy immensely how the coming five to ten years unfold according to his (and Thiels) current plan."

"Overall, for the last month we've moved sideways and slightly down when looking at the total lifespan, ie. 6 Months since direct listing. You need to expand your scope when looking at $PLTR, I'd personally wait untill May for price expansion to 30s, and then further along I'd say midsummer for any higher 30s-lower 40s action. Bullish EOY is 65, Neutral 48, Bearish 35. With Quarterly growth 35 or higher percent, shouldn't expect too brutal of a decline going into Q2. I'm not an advisor. Just a guy with Gotham user end experience.225 Shares, 14 Call Options, with most in for next January.Holding until I'm not."

Like if you're holding to $50 
If Tesla signs you know GM is signing it’s a bloated bohemoth lots of data silos to organize. New to palantir look up data silos and you’ll buy more when you’re done.
200$ by 2023!!!
I looked up recent institutional ownership on fintel and a ton of mutual funds and ETFs are buying. Not just ARK but even Invesco (they outperformed all of ARKs ETFS in 2020).
"the CEO appeared on cnbc last nite ~~~ he is saying as an investor you should look at the bigger picture for pltr and sell if you are a short term trader looking for fast profits i.e. quote ""no one is forcing you to buy"" so move on and buy another stock if you think it is better.....perhaps this explains the selling today which imo is a buying opportunity agree with me or not ~~~~~~~"
Such a nice bipolar stock buy buy buy

so strong ..i like pltr for the long term...but please get to 26
happy for this dip adding 5 . this can stay here for a long time so I can keep adding!
Just wait until TSLA brings PLTR aboard. Geniuses with similar values come together. History repeats itself. Good history too.
"Just so everyone is clear.. the lockup expiration is tomorrow not friday. Google it. I thought it was Friday as well, but its saying tomorrow. Tuesday counted as day 1."
Think about it. Blue Ridge Capital has somewhere in the area of TEN million shares. PLTRis a very unique company.

"REALITY CHECK:1) If you bought at 25+, this stock will be a real test of your patience 2) At 25+ PLTR was trading like it was 100% certain it’d be the next Amazon/Apple/Google3) it’s not 100% certain. I believe it’ll be it’s own thing, better than any of those companies 4) the price didn’t drop because of the lock up expiration, that was always baked in. It dropped after earnings call because the CEO of the company provided future earnings guidance that was LOWER than anticipated - thus the share price adjusted downward 5) The market is trending down. There is a rotation happening from tech to inflation resistant and COVID recovery stocks. This impacts PLTRBottom line: If you believe in this company, and the 4B rev guidance by 2025, just relax. This ride will not be for the weak of heart."
"So from of show of thumbs down, how many bag holders are still hanging onto their $45 shares??? lolzzzz"
"If you have been investing in Tesla for some years, you know exactly what happened yesterday."
Instead of buying door dash for $65B you could buy PLTR for $55B at this price and have $10B leftover. That may speak more to doordash being overvalued then palantir being undervalued but still...
$ 25 today
Get in the pool you goof ball investors. Personality of CEO has no bearing on the price. This is a gift at 24.50 or less. $40.00 real soon with this slip up Biden. Tracking needed. Buy Buy Buy PLTR...!!!
Seeking Alpha negative article again.. Basically listing every downside attribute while not mentioning the IBM or AWS growth sales prospects
cat just ran away from home. (gonna put the money I would be taking care of her for) towards pltr
"I believe in the company, its managers and its unique products. I really think these are products that will dominate in the future. The company is a consensus among investorsAnd also among opinion makers in the capital market.On the other hand, very confused.It is still difficult for me to understand the massive declines yesterday, today in early trading is down about 6%.My fear that even if it is indeed a future is bright,Stakeholders are currently operating in the stock in their favor, whether options traders or employees selling “locked” shares.I would appreciate your opinion guys"
"Oh, Yea! it's also a massive ""scam"" according to some, and this is why the pentagon gives PLTR research and development contracts."
"Love it , very stable here"
Shorts will get played like a fiddle.
Should make a run to $30 within 48 hours strong hold
"I'm in at 33. only have 20 shares but I'm a bit worried, as I don't have a ton of $..."
"6 days red, 7th day green. Like God's creation?"
"The whole market is down guys, almost everything. It's not pleasant but I'm never selling here ever!!"
juuuuust wait.........
just bought more @ 25.96 $
wsb gonna abandon also....they too woke to help thisnguy
Back to 35+
we'll see a nice jump tomorrow if the market is green
"We do not need any actions for PLTR. Palantir is just fine, it doesn't need robinhoods. Just buy as much as you can it and enjoy the ride."
See u all @100 in the future
bounce back to 27
The lock up will cause more pain $24-25 is my buy $$$
"Well I’m happy with a upgrade from Goldman only means the rest will follow from here jpmorgan, credit suisse, etc the hit mafia is on our side now I’m happy"
"Breaking news!It’s almost like investing requires patience and an emphasis on the BIG PICTURE instead of being focused on whether PLTR is $24 or $25 by EOD.Shocking I know, take a seat and breathe ."
"29.4% Put and 70.6% call options, which means 71% think PLTR will go up and 29% think/hopes it will go down."
Just keep buying the dip
give me a ring when it hits $14~ so I can buy in then.
The stock is up solely because the 3Y treasury auction was successful. Future stock swings will be mainly driven by interest rate expectations.
"This will bleed down under $20 and maybe into the $13-17 range. Everyone says that it is a long term hold, I truly believe that but I think there is a much better entry point lower into the teens."
"DayTraders bashing PLTR....Go somewhere else, in six months it will double."
"The CEO says in a few words, BUY AND HOLD it will pay off soon"
I thought it was going to $9?
"Do you think Cathie cares that the stock goes down a couple percentage points literally hours after she purchased? Haha get real. Watch her interview on YouTube and learn something about how really smart successful investors win long term. You heard it from Alex and Cathie reiterated it, Palantir is not catering to investors looking for short term gains, they’re investing aggressively because we are in a “winners take most market”. They’re goal is to own this space. Short term profits is NOT THEIR FOCUS. Why would anyone want to day trade a stock who’s CEO said that?Baffles me that after hearing that, people are still chasing those pennies. Oh well, my shares are safe."
Picking sure winners like this is easy. Finding money to buy them is the problem
"My fellow PLTR Minions,1. I have a feeling that the BIG BOYS are nice to us Minions on Fridays2. It seems that the BIG BOYS make their millions of dollars in profits Monday through Thursday3. However, the BIG BOYS allow us Minions to profit between 20 to 40 cents on Fridays 4. Thank you BIG BOYS for being very nice to us.5. Conclusion: Buy Low from Monday to Thursday and then SELL on Fridays for a small profit to pay groceries, gas, cigarettes, diapers, etc...6. Rinse and Repeat?Peace!"
Watch out! Pltr will turn green!
It is just amazing at how cheap this stock is.
Back to 34 soon
Get ready
"This is another stock that Jon Najarian pumped on CNBC half-time, buying the calls at the start of the show, then waiting for the CNBC viewers to pile in, so that he could dump the calls after the show."

"In for 6k shares, what do folks see as a solid opp for call options?"
What a Bargain PLTR is right now
Alex Karp seems to be brutally honest. Especially when he tells people to “go buy another stock. There are plenty out there.”He also said that he “wants to build one of the top software company in the world.”That statement seems so much more real to me now.
Cathie wood loaded up another 3.3millions shares today! Total 12m shares! 30$ Monday coming!

"Got in 1800@25.01. Good or bad buy? Looks like there is great support at 25$! Looks like someone wants to buy all those newly Soros available shares, no? Institutions/hedge funds, probably."
Strange how calls expiring in a few months were in the red today. Still think mid/low 20s is the floor. Great time to get in!
ol good . i buy more today PLTR good lak to ol
Does anyone think we'll be up today?
What a gift yesterday
"Wait for the last hour, it will be interesting,..."
Anyone who thinks that Peter Thiel's baby saw its lifetime 'high' of $40 a couple months after public trading...is smoking crack. You'll be reading Palantir at triple digits within a couple years (maybe sooner).

So basically down on good news with the nasdaq moving flat? Maybe the last insider selling. Tomorrow up big.
"The likelihood for a rapid government adaption usage of PLTR software in AI as big data 5G hits cruise control mainstream business between private corp & gov will magnify conversion use of preferred vendor Palantir for rapid flow of information technologies translating interoperability, versatility & profit to the company."
"On a CNBC Fast Money special right now, two “analysts” said they would buy Palantir at 15. Nice try."

Thank you China for flooding the market with printed cash and driving down the 10 year treasuries therefore driving the stock price of PLTR higher.
If you ever get worried about PLTR just think about 5 years from now when it will be $250+. Will you care if you bought it at 28 or 30?
ARKK initiated a 5.2 million shares position of PLTR yesterday. Position 50. WOW!https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/ARK_INNOVATION_ETF_ARKK_HOLDINGS.pdf

Thank you Cathy Wood!!!! 
Even the $24 Calls right up to $65. They must be digging out their GME short losses to be so petty.
Multi-million expansion of supply chain with 3MNever regret holding strong my share <3
Maybe the 10Y collapsing to 1.51 is people dodging the incoming train. Maybe it's something else I do not see. But we have movement.

Jeffries analyst raised PT from $30 to $40
flgt i believe is going to make a major move to upside soon.......yes im pumping but being honest. check out chart yourself do your due diligence....they just had a blow out quarter and have a high ceiling
So we had a better price last Friday before the ibm news ..not adding up
you guys aren't going to like it but this will drift down and sideways for couple months. it will go below 20. don't sell because its hard to time the market but have cash ready to average down huge on this.
"Palantir is a required skill for data analyst at AT&T , check their website!"
The people selling now in the 20’s will be buying later in the 30’s. Once in the 30’s people will sell and buy back in the 40’s etc. etc. long term hold not just 6 months but years....10 years from now this company will be a house hold name such as the FAANG stocks and prices 10X....

"Hey, the good news is that SNOW is up over 2.5 percent! If you guys are lucky, they'll buy PLTR out."
"This is becoming boring to watch today, maybe this is it for today hoping for another good day on Monday."
Ok so when can PLTR get some of that GME type action?
"Full disclosure, I am long PLTR. For those of you talking about a short squeeze, you are obviously not looking at the statistics of the company. Only 3.25% of the outstanding float is short (that is a VERY small percentage). There is not going to be a short squeeze. This is a long term holding and there will be ups and downs, just like with any other stock."
"PLTR is just set for a very big rebound. I still strongly claim that this will be doubled in 2 months (I am not just saying this because it is increasing, I kept saying that even when the stock sharply declined for weeks I guess some people would remember my comments ) if PLTR is not over 45$ in 2 months, I promised to give up investing in stocks. Regards"
Must close above 27.74 baby...next stop 29
"Did I write this yesterday? Yes, I did :). More to come caballeros. I will update the thread occassionally like I did with Weight Watchers (WW) several weeks ago. I will not steer you wrong. Tech Analysis from yesterday below:The peak at open today above was above it’s 5 day peak. Double top attempt to short was thwarted by 24.50 wall. Trend is upward albeit deliberate (on purpose strong algo consolidation and selling of puts). However, there have been some big buys and big short closes to test various short term ceilings.Amazon, Army, BP, Rio Tinto, IBM...just to begin with. Fundamentals are too strong - markets prevail over short sighted. Always. It is a battle for shares by institutions thus the deliberate pace of sideways consolidation.If you build it he will come.Patience."
Everyone switched up all of the sudden
29 please
"LONGs, can you hear 30s coming soon? I certainly can."

$38 is coming today. Mark my words
"It take money to make money, just because we has one-time expenses, Stock based compensation, Cramer, talking crack. Company’s success usually depending on customer's and committed employees, Let the record show we been getting contract left and right."
I bought this last week at $38. It has been a stomach turning week but I am not selling for less than $100 no matter how long it takes. What this company does is the trend with a lot of potential..
"This dip in the market really tests the wisdom of traders. If you panic sell, you need to stay calm like the pros do. In the end, you should be investing in companies that you love and understand why they will grow. If you can't handle volatility, then you didn't love your investment or do your research. If you panic sell, you need to improve your investing skills cause there is a way to win in the stock market and a way to lose. You bought high and considering selling low? how will you ever make money? then you wonder how you keep losing money...buy low, sell high and invest in companies you absolutely believe in..."
You will see when it start to run up no one can stop it Then you will regret why you were late
"As far its volume stays above 30m everyday, this meme stock can’t make a reasonable rally."
Market never makes mistakes...
Back to 35$
Added shares. Long-term value here is just ridiculously underappreciated. I thank Karp for being transparent about the market and PLTR.
"Karp exclusive on CNBC March 16 = stock flies. (new contracts). Palantir Demo day April 11 = stock flies.$50 this spring.But yeah, keep selling for crumbs cuz that's the only thing you know."
Stock very strong. I expect down much lower to $20
I'm still waiting for a decision for the SLR exemption to be made before I buy in. Where do you stand on the SLR exemption issue?
"Nice uptick, great volume. Thumbs up if you’re holding!"
88% of my portfolio..
It’s funny how the bears think that the lock up expiring is only a bad thing... they clearly haven’t read into the history of some ipos and their lockup’s...
Very frustrating. Drip drip every day. Ok just got to hang in there if your long. It will get better. Jmo
Holy Amazon!!!!!!!!!
"Been preaching the same thing since DPO day. Chill the hell out, on both green & red days, and remain patient.No, the odds are we are not going to the moon by next week.No, PLTR is not trash just because it’s struggling as the ENTIRE TECH MARKET & NASDAQ have struggled in recent days.Yes this will pass and be completely irrelevant in a few weeks-months.Some of y’all really treat long-term investments like they’re supposed to make you 100% returns overnight. You won’t get anywhere in this stock market game with a approach like that. These hedge funds have millions behind their risky plays, you don’t. Act accordingly and stay patient when others panic.-spoken as someone down over 30+% the last 2 weeks from my 2021 high, and I spent today buying more of my current positions.Patience pays off more often than not in the market."
"Alex acted like a little kid yesterday in the interview with his comments to the wall street investors, basically telling them I don't want your money, go somewhere else, plenty of other stocks to invest. Such comments will tank the stock further unless he was speaking from point of power with a good news to come out soon to boost the stock. I hope this is the case."
BREAKING INSIDE DEAL WITH TESLA ELON MUSK ACQUIRING 5 MILLION SHARES
So the dip and market crash also had a lot to do with a fiscal year profit pull for many companies. Where you see many people sell off their shares take profits and reposition. Think about owning pltr and in a year it doubles in sp... wouldn’t you take profits as well?That should explain some of this. The rest is just time. GL
The 3M win is huge. It proves that PLNT provides private sector companies with a competitive advantage. And the fact that 3M is increasing its spend shows there is measurable ROI.
"Buy, hold and then purchase that Porsche you want!!"
"Either Aunt Cathy has no idea what she's doing by buying 1.6 MILLION shares BEFORE the lock up period expires, on this red sale day, OR all the sellers of Palantir after a great earnings report, made a big mistake and are unable to see the bright future of this company."
"10% down is no big deal. I am still up pretty nicely on PLTR, and will add more shares...in it for the long haul...3+ years."
Only holding 575 shares what will it be worth in 5 yrs
Always have cash in your portfolio for days like today.
Why Palantir is a $1 Trillion Company? >>>>>>>>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbIwiGHdItY THIS IS THE WAY
Got 800@25.01.We'll see how that resistance holds.
Buying back at $20
ARKK is planning on purchasing more shares today  strong hold don’t sell shares
Vanguard buys over 6 million shares
"I am holder since day one, continue to hold AND average up. The bears do not understand the importance of the AWS and IBM cloud partnership. Try no to think linearly about the future. This company will be one of the most important software companies in a couple of years: they provide visionary solutions that took many years to build and are currently years ahead of non-exsitent competition. Rant over..."
Will open greeeen
Hopefully this will be the next leg up.
Not much more downside to this stock with all the tutes and the WSB crowd buying in
"Just added 800 more shares at $32.13, bringing my total up to 2,000 shares. All of my shares are insured by $40 puts. Separately, I have plenty of other puts and calls to capture the upside or downside movement next week. If PLTR plummets, I'll just take profits on my puts and add more shares. But in my opinion, PLTR has already proven that it has consolidated the $30s price level. A breakdown to $29 and below would be a sign of serious trouble. I think it's more likely that it will re-test the $40s (and maybe surge to $50) after the earnings and forward guidance are announced. PLTR continues to be undervalued in the $30s. A year from now, it will be in the triple digits."
2 weeks in the top 20 most bought stocks by Hedges funds
AT&T will be using PLTR.
Just a quick reminder: Watch what happens at 3:30pm TODAY!!!
I could be wrong.. or I could be right.. but I don't think we'll ever see $25 ever again..
Pltr comin back folks!
AT&T announcement soon.....
I am bullish on this I have half my portfolio in this. I had 100% until yesterday so sold half with the spike at even money. Just didnt like having all of my money in one stock but feel even better just having half as I can enjoy it more even it it goes down a little as I have another half to play with now. GLTA of us longs.
close green 
"ARKW bought 1,560,200 shares of PLTR today!"
Good price to enter at these rates. 28-30$ seems possible next week.
tone has totally changed of the board...means its going up
Goldman upgreaded PLTR from Neutral to BUY with 34 price target!!
"First they cried about valuation.Then they cried about profits.Then they cried about the lock up period ending.When will you “experts” learn that all the bashing you’re doing is pointless .Any long-term investor can see where this is going based on their leadership & product. If it’s good enough for the US government, IBM, and other power players, it’s good enough for me.Patience PLTR longs, patience. Scared money don’t make money in this game."
Fun day buying :) Thanks sellers
going for more support @ 26.40
good time to buy more during pre-market before it change to green.
im pretty sure this is the best stock EVER. i love karp too. reminds me of the smartest people I've ever met. NEXT level processing in his brain. I would just hand him my wallet if I met him. no jokes.
When are insiders able to sell? Today or yesterday after market closed?
But the dip and be patient. In a year you’ll be laughing
yeah ark bought 45 million dollars worth today
Volume looking to reach 20 mil higher than yesterday. These are good signs for overall health of the stock
When PLTR hits $100 I’m going to start looking at Rolexes... always wanted a yacht master
Got it at 24.90$ soo sweeet!
We succesfully hold on $28 and ready for $30 tmr
Just 4 hours left to accumulate or sell before earnings move it.
I am sitting with great pain with 500shares @35/share. Insider played big game. They have unloaded and made big profit. Security exchange should take action.
"Palantir Technologies Chief Operating Officer Shyam Sankar disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that he sold 757,510 shares between Feb. 19 and Feb. 23, at prices ranging from $24.59 to $29 a share. Proceeds were about $21.5 million.With the sales, Sankar now owns 2,879,793 shares in the data analytics company, not counting 1.07 million shares held in two trusts he controls, according to the filing.The disclosure followed filings earlier this week covering 2.7 million shares sold by three other Palantir executives.As reported, Stephen Cohen, Palantir's co-founder and president, sold 2 million shares, on Feb. 18, 19, and 22, at prices ranging from $25.07 to $30.03 a share. Those sales generated proceeds of about $53.6 million.Matthew Long, general counsel, sold 503,864 shares on Feb. 18, at prices ranging from $25.04 to $25.86 a share, for proceeds of about $12.6 million.Ryan Taylor, chief legal officer and business affairs officer, sold 218,255 shares on Feb. 18, at prices ranging from $25.07 to $25.85 a share, raising about $5.5 million."
Friends like I said buy at $24 levels. This is a good dip buying opportunity.

"You just need to think, are you trading or investing?"
Wallet Investor AI 1 year forecast for PLTR is $86; 5 years forecast is $331.
110 viewing.. this late.. well what is it this and when in rome... but you can't stop it... we start cooking... today.. tommorow... PLTRRRRR!
"If it really drops like this today, I’ll get out of everything else and be 100% PLTR. "
"30+ EOD, let’s make it happen fellas."
Still holding since $9.04...
What contract will be signed and when? PLTR has been averaging 2 announcements every 13 days. Next one is around the corner.
"Dont care if the price will be 20, 30 or 40 in the next weeks, in 5 years from now you will laugh and cry about it at the same time, because you’re counting the money Palantir has made for you "
It's the second most traded stock today by volume and yet the price is stable at ~$25. It looks like someone big is picking up all those shares. Perhaps this is the right time to buy.
"This stock will be bought out with six months $ 80 to $ 100 a share , the government loves this company that why you will see a buyout to strengthen a big player in military contracts"
Your missing variable in your equation : Spike in bond yields = FEAR in stocks = PLTR DOWN = buying opportunity
go up a lot please
"The truth is it’s dropping because the lock up ends Friday, so it will go lower as people sell before the employees start selling 100s of millions of shares over the next week.When it’s over, the stock will shoot right back to $40 within a couple weeks.I sold last week before the big selling started, and you should not hold going into the weekend, next Monday & Tues will be a blood bath, possible Wednesday also.Good, solid company, just not one to hold over the next week.Just my opinion, not financial advice, do your DD"
Plug  will be pulled on every stock involved. Then thousands will be in federal institutions.
Giddy-up Horsey....
Haters back off
"Place sell orders to $40Or more, this is going to fly"
"Been looking to get into PLTR , thank you for the dip ! As I’ve now bought in"
Like this post if you think Cathy Wood is a QUEEN and will bring us to the promised land (aka the triple digit club)
"For those who stomached these past 2 days, you will be heavily heavily rewarded in the future. Palantir is here to stay."
Bought 1000 share today. Tomorrow another 500 . Let’s see where it will end .
I bought at 29.50
Volume 314M+what is going on here???
Guys I’m long pltr but 100+ by EOY?? Let’s be real..
Multiple new big deals upcoming!
"bought at 13, been averaging up with every bit dip, didn't sell any. now average $24...hum, am I doing the right thing?"
"There were 62,000 options for today's $26 call strike price sold yesterday. Some person/group is expecting a big positive move today. Or they are planning on buying a ton of stock today and wanted to benefit on the options."
Are you seeing that V shape in the chart?V = Viagra...Let's hope PLTR can keep the hard on...
Just put a little or alot into a meme stock and your attention will be diverted from this slow growing (but amazing and big potential stock) and watch the drama unfold. Pltr is 95% my port but is was nice to get a break from watching it today Pltr eoy 125
I'll continue adding shares. I think we double then triple by year's end.
We will end up green! Guys!
AT & T deal imminent
"Tech sell off; This is today news. MMs getting ready for Friday for options to expire worthless. Completely rigged market. This has been there for long time but now it is at new proportions. Mainly because, Wall-Street is upset with main street making money."
Added 300 shares
STIMULUS PASSED!!!
"Alex Karp told you from his own mouth that this is a long term investment. He told short term investors to take a hike. Why are guys saying thing like ""TO THE MOON!"" ""$100 COME SOON!"" Did you watch the conference call??? He basically told you this will be dead money for maybe a year. Will this be a $100 company in two years? Yes, this is very likely. Make your investment and just forget about it. Don't look at it daily and second guess yourself."
Just got another 100...let's roll!!!!
Draftkings soaring with 46% institutional ownership and a bigger than expected loss (-44.70%)Perfectly rational.
I just started putting some $ into this. I only have 100 shares. But my goal is to keep buying dips until I reach 1000 shares. Then I plan on forgetting that I ever put anything in this company. Then I will check back in 20 years
"The market is way down, the stock is up which is a good thing. The market is up and the stock is down which is not a frustrating thing. The positive side of all this is that the stock might be creating a base at around $23/$24."
Algo pointing to $28.
bought more on the dip.this company will be huge
See you at $34 by Friday
Bear market has officially began. 2-3% will be knocked off every week for next 2 years. Hahahahha
buy. hold. chill.
"In my opinion, now that lockup is over we're going to see a recovery, $50 price target MAX next month"
flood gates are opening
"Bought in at 35. Bought again at 32. Bought again at 25. But yeah, now I'm still buying. Because I believe..."
What’s going on with this stock? Nasdaq is up and this is down. Doesn’t make any sense. They sign more contracts. And this is remains neutral. CEO sold his shares. Other members sold as well. If you believe this stock is great why sell? Keep it. But they do opposite
One of the few stocks that are up ALL DAY LONG and then after hours the manipulators drop it a dollar!? What a load of horse shhh...
i am stuck with 5000 shares at 28. any idea if this will ever go back to 28 again ever ???
Went from 100 shares to 147 & selling 30 CC... not much but we'll get there
Can someone tell me why you think this will go up to $100 in the next few years?
31 Million volume in the first 3 minutes.WOW
Shorties think they could win us :D
Karp is really a patriot. Bashed silicon valley for being unwilling to help the country in which they are protected and make money. Love this guy!
Is AWS confirmed?
"I see a news in Yahoo ""Palantir As WallStreetBets' Top Interest"", is that the reason why it went up after hours? next GameStop?"
Read the entire conference call. And you will really realize. You invested in a dynamic company. And you will be rewarded
up in Germany 6.02%
"Ladies and Gentlemen,If you sold your PLTR babies below $27, you made a BIG MISTAKE... Now, for those of us who will not budge and will not even think about selling our PLTR babies...

Not really a surge for PLTR...either way come on baby!
We might see $5 jump tomorrow! Everyone is buying. Let’s push this baby to $50!
And failed 27! Who was right?
Well just lost all my gains from last year.
"I feel bad for those who sold yesterday. Nevertheless, it was a lesson for you! Patience is key."
Can anyone please tell me? for those who are not happy about this stock - why do they always keep being on PLTR'S BLOG and always trying to comment badly? those who are smart enough will immediately find out the real answer. you can spend your time on other stocks if you really think this is a bad investment. DO NOT ACT LIKE A KID YOU SHORTIES COME ON !!
Aunt Cathie is back ........... Could hit back to 45 in a few months.
"Ramses where are you? U, #$%$"
"Palantir, Anduril Team Up to Develop Tactical Ground System Prototype for Army"
Imagine selling at 20-22. 
I'm happy with a daily increase of 3%
"The chart is favorable, $29 is the first target most likely early next week."
"Next time this dips below 24, I am increasing my holdings. I've seen enough to understand how this is playing out. This stock is going to be like TSLA, Parabolic for the next year and maybe forever. Remember when everyone was laughing at TSLA and how overvalued that was, yep just like that."
Come on let's get going already?
"I'm buying modest amounts of shares at various levels: 10, 20, 50 shares whenever I can. It adds up going forward. One day we will all be looking at $150 plus per share."
$PLTR options are damn expensive 
"In October Lonsdale mentioned that PLTR will be very, very profitable in a couple of years. It will be!"
"PLTR is a great company to invest in. for now, my account has gone down $42,000 in PLTR. Am I scared? None at all. I will make $70,000 if it go back to $40. But I won't sell it then. I will hold it for years. This is my chance to retire early. "
"$100 before the end of the year in my opinion, no doubt!"
This is when Catherine Wood increases ARK investments significantly
had my opportunity to buy in at $25 and i blew it ...
Very interesting post from a former engineer at palantir on Reddit:https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkngg9/former_pltr_engineer_dd_part_2_usability/
PLTR will be open@30+ on Monday!
Tesla contract next $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Selling another 10 (teaser lot) at 26.99. Let's see if they hit me
"I wonder how much this contract is worth? These guys are NOT small. Many haven?t heard of them but this is a big customer.Founded in 1997, Faurecia has grown to become a major player in the global automotive industry.

Guys! Palantir is on sale right now! This is a great buy point! $40 by March 1.

"Palantir time is ticking, dip won't last forever.Palantir has dozens of open jobs worldwide, hundreds of job postings require palantir skills.Funds are buying, while clueless retail is selling. Major catalysts March 16 and April 11, plus new contracts announcements in the interim.Ready for gapping up."
Went from 230 shares to 310 today:)
To the moon Alice lol!
I like this stonk
In what world would you want to go to sleep NOT owning PLTR shares? They drop news on a regular basis and once WS is done loading up this train will no longer wait for anyone.
Gonna be huge next week
"LET ME REMIND ALL THE PALANTIR INVESTOR:When this stock was trading over $33 there was not a single negative comment or a dislike at all in here, All these negative comments you are seeing are from short sellers that are here for a quick buck.IGNORE THE NOISE! This is a great companyAverage down if you can and hold for long term to make 2X 3X on your investment.For short sellers, remember this bounced from $23.5 to $40 in 1 week and it will do it again and you will run to cover. Its a matter of time.Good luck to all, enjoy the weekend"
27 close or more
Don’t panic over numbers.The target on this stock is 60$
Market will be record green tomorrow where PLTR will spike $28-29 easily!!!
"Just wondering when the PLTR leadership exercise options to buy shares at zero dollars, are those just created out of thin air and added to the float therefore diluting our investment?"
"Someday, all the right investors will own this stock and it won’t fall any where near these levels. It’ll be over $100 a share."
"Under 20 coming. I'm better than Cathie, proof was today ;)"
"I like the stock, I also will bet you this moves positive 10% today"
What a buy!!!!!!
"Ark over 62000 purchase today ,look at AH going up"
"If you haven’t already, subscribe to Palantir’s YouTube channel, Follow them on Facebook. Help the brand"
What would Cramer say if he had bought PLTR?
This boy ain't right.
Its going up in heavy volume..
whats a good entry price
"I guess that Ramses has now gone back to Egypt, Mario_111 has returned to being a video game, Elon Bezos has just smartened up and shut up, and Covert Action is now so covert, that he actually cannot find where he has hidden himself."
"Having just read over the transcript of the earnings report, these seem like some very impressive facts and figures. Eighty-four percent margins and 30% compounded annual growth over the next four years are nothing to cry about. From last Monday's high of $39.22 to today's low of $28.00, PLTR has seen a -28.6% decline in just one week. It's possible that the end of share lockup might send it crashing down to $23 or lower—but that would represent an additional -20% decline from what is already a heavily corrected price level. Today I took profits on some puts and repositioned myself with new calls and puts at even better strikes and expiries. I haven't bought any new shares today, but I might do so soon. I currently own 2,000 shares, and I'd like to double or triple that amount this year. If the end of share lockup sends PLTR crashing down to the low $20s or high teens, I will start adding as many shares as possible.A year from now, when PLTR is trading in the triple digits, it would be nice to be sitting on 5,000+ shares."
"With those vols, I guess this stock is heavily traded by day traders."
"Ladies and Gentlemen,We have reached an altitude of $24.We are now going to try to beat the headwinds..."

Closing GREEN...?
"Morgan Stanley downgrades PLYR and then double down when the price drops. Now they are hiring palantir analysts on their job website. “CRGT is seeking an experienced and highly motivated candidate to manage the Palantir application architecture and data within Morgan Stanley. The ideal candidate is a hands-on and detail-oriented architect-level developer with strong communication, coordination, and data analysis skills.

"Last dance, last chance to buy!"
Today +25$?
65$ by april
Amazon partnership confirmed on Twitter
Sooner or later: PLTR will blast by $45 on its way to $175 plus.....
"6 year contract? lol, do some of you not comprehend the bullish sign that a business in todays economy is willing to go into a 6 year agreement? That is an eternity but should provide some understanding of just how powerful this software is. They wanted price lock for 6 years because they know the price of this oil (data/AI) is going UP as demand for it increases.$55-65 by end of year. $150-250 by 2025Those who can wait until 2030 likely have $350-500 and that’s potentially modest."
The 3m contract yesterday was clouded over by the Federal reserve deal. It really should not be overlooked that PLTR made Millions and Millions of dollars yesterday closing this important deal. A small rally is in order. Not a decline in share cost. Uptrend confirmed
"Growing revenue, a new deal just done with IBM and you're going to sell? lol."

He will say ""I tried to tell you but my lawyers won't let me"""

"Well, good morning all. I like to come in a little late so I don't have to sift through the juvenile and moronic posts in the mornings. Anyway, looks like the morning dips are getting shallower quickly as expected. It should be green by EOD if you believe the charts and historical movement. I know the overall market is moving all tech right now but it will recover nicely. Just be patient! GL and God bless."
This is a $100 stock in 9 months
I love all the negative sentiment here. You all know what that means?
"Behold, the total sweep of calls from $65 to $25 by Friday. This is a legal practice by WS. To sell contracts and manipulate open markets with trading machines."
Don’t mind me. I’m just here to do my GIF poster muting morning clean up.
25 all day long? What's the significance of the number?Hundreds of millions of trades...yet it stays locked in at the price...days like this u know the market is rigged

"The stock came back to pick you up. Don't miss the opportunity, LOL."
Why did Cathie Wood buy AHEAD of lockup? Makes you wonder.
$29 so close to being in the money
For the bears. Palantir has been profitable you just don’t see it Q3 earnings - one time direct listing fee of 800 million Q4 earnings - decided to invest more on there workers for their hard workAs for q1 of 2021 lol prepare yourself
"up or don't care. cash on the side to pick up more. been holding for long time. we know the drill. Long time play boys. hit 20 no problem, hit 15 no problem hit 45 still no problem"
Amazon grabbing a sure growth partner to grab more of the cloud market. They were first in that business and lead Google and Microsoft. I'm impressed. IBM was first and Amazon wasted no time to compete. I'm expecting Oracle to jump in next very soon.You guys think Microsft Azure will play ball? Google even?
when will george soros get out? really want him outta this stock. didnt he said he will sell when he can? ill feel safe when he is out

Just bought 5k more shares since Cathy bought.
I feel like PLTR is one of the most undervalued companies today... That was a good video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=815nXB4ySw0&t=136s
"It's obvious that printing 100B a month is not enough to keep Treasury yields down. The Fed needs to bring in yield curve control and print whatever it takes. If it means trillions a month, so be it."
Monday open: $41
"ARRK investors received notification (I did) that they purchased 1,560,200 shares of PLTR today, they must be more than confident in PLTR's way ahead! This stock is one good partnership being announced and immediately jumping north of $35, get in at these prices."
$27 is huge resistance
"Hipster stock $8,99."
"Got in at 25, good enough"
pltr couldnannounce somenbuy backs please
Great discount!
okay by 4:00 p.m. today this stok will be in the green along with the NASDAQ probably be up 150 points..... watch
If it breaks through resistance at $30 we are smooth sailing.
BAAAAM!! Hello 30!!
"Pltr turns green, we all know how hard it is when Nasdaq is down more than 1%"
"Is PLTR becoming a go-to company for climate change and striving to be carbon neutral? BP, PG&E, Faurecia, etc. tracking supply chains inefficiency and ways to streamline processes and offset carbon consumption."
I bet all those bashers from the last 4 weeks feel very smart waiting on the sidelines right now 
$65 stocks are traded at 29 bucksWhy not???Super Sale??????
Way Oversold....
Karp is right though. short sellers ruin everything. you have to think about long term investing
"Many people are saying that this stock is going back to 20s....this is a thing that I disagree! The actual price now is undervalue! If we see a new contract this week, For sure we will see it over 45.We are just waiting for news...Not going back to work 20s!"
Cyber Security Hackers be careful! Palantir is coming to town

"Good investors don't care about the day in and day out of the share price, just keep adding to your position and in 5 years you will be looking like a genius!"
"Wish i got in lower but screw it, im sure at some point Ill reflect on $24 as a “sale” price"
I'm a lomg for at least 2 years. These prices are a gift from God.
Pltr will get the energy grid deal in Texas. That’s a no brainer.
Buy as much as you can afford. This is short term pain for long term gain
THE best CEOs don't care about being rich.
"As predicted the dead cat bounced back like the rest of the market. What's important is how this valuation bubble will handle slower growth, operating losses and the upcoming Nasdaq meltdown."
CEO ripping on face book right now 
I’m more than happy to buy more 
"What we are looking for tomorrow is not necessarily the earnings but Palantirs forward projections, in light of a very active few months, I think a few surprises may be announced too."
"No matter the price you, you still own the same amount of the company."
$45 soon
This will hit $30 this week easily after that is anyone guesses.
"My next entrance is $22.84. That should be the bottom, if not we are dead for awhile LOL"
"Cathie Woods like PLTR , add more !! this is a long hold ."
YessThis is a huge contact
"Instead of throwing his anger at wallstreet, PLTR CEO Karp should look at mirror and anger at his own board of directors who unloaded millions of stocks last month when it was trading high!"
Being patient makes you successful 
"Guys listen my words, around June 18th you will see this stock at 55 dollars!"
Bears can’t even tell you why they think the stock is bad...not selling for a longggg time.
Flying high! To the moon!
"Looks like the market is finally waking up from a drunken state. Highly speculative stocks, such as $PLUG, $FCEL, $BLDP, $RUN, $BLNK, $WKHS, $SNOW, $PLTR, $PTON, $FSLY, $ZM, $W, with no real prospects of good long term earnings, but astronomical valuations, are crashing! Long term, earnings and valuation always matter!"
Suzanne Orman says this is a buy!
"after any conference with Jobs, Gates...the shareholder was immediately rewardedlook at PLTR DOWN DOWN DOWNguess the management is very good, technology the best but f...communication"
Told u it was gonna go green this is the longs time!
"Wouldn't it be nice if $25 is our new low and everything from here is up? The lock up really didn't shake the tree too much today. Smart share holders that were able to sell today will wait for the real money coming later. Unless they were strapped for cash, Why would anyone sell PLTR at $25? We all know by EOY that it will be considerably higher. The future of PLTR is extremely promising. I am holding my 1600 shares like a roll of toilet paper in a pandemic. P.S. Please say a prayer for 2.5 million people in TEXAS that are effected by the storm. No water. No power. Sub Freezing temperatures. It could have been you just as easily."
"Yahoo Finance won't post the Amazon Partnership. Ironic we let them data farm our sentiment, while they feed us bearishness."
My dog after watching Alex Karp’s interview a couple of days ago...
everyone buys one share to get this to $25
PLTR sees Q1 revenue up 45%
Closing in on the $27 call strike Mar 12. Watch it climb.
"Anyone who is bearish on Palantir probably has never read or even heard of Zero to One - one of the best business books ever written. I'm pretty sure Thiel wouldn't have started this company if he didn't have something special. In fact, I think it is going to be quite funny in a few years when Thiel is hauled before Congress and has to explain why Palantir is not a monopoly, while Senators are reading direct quotes from his book to him. I will be watching from a beach somewhere on a remote island."
PALANTIR'S next target will be above 45 $ Make a note of this
Every down turn. I am buying more.The CEO has convinced me that this company if the future of software.
Back down to $25 where I’ll buy more.
If you people sell this stock your going to be mad in June......as in mama June.
Good stock bad market situation. Simple as that. Bears please don’t try to act like you’re smart and make up reasons as to why it’s declining. People are scared and selling because of a correction or market decline. Once this is over this will rise considerably
Added some more at 29.3I’m happy.
"shaking weak hands very obvious,and based on volume so many weak hands are gone already"
"Got another 500 shares to increase my position to 3,000 shares. "
Expected revenue between $ 327m to $ 350m against analysts expectation of $ 304m
"Check the daily chart, you will see that PLTR is going up every other Friday. And if it’s the Friday , the following Monday will go up too."
I don't like this stock as ARK has it. If she sells out this goes to 10. I don't want to take that chance.
Buckle up.
"This Faurecia partnership is a lot bigger than most people realize. ""Faurecia is a French global automotive supplier headquartered in Nanterre, in the western suburbs of Paris. In 2018 it was the 9th largest international automotive parts manufacturer in the world and #1 for vehicle interiors and emission control technology. One in three automobiles is equipped by Faurecia.""Revenue: 17.52 billion EUR (2018)"
This is the worse stock to own in a tech correction.
$200 by end of 2030
I think we will reach 26 now.
This company's name is from Lord of the ringsI think its good sign
AI is not the hottest thing roght now as earnings have been dissapointing...itd be best for pltr to sell itself as a software that does a lot ofnstuff. instead of AI
This seems to have settled down at the $25 range. Just about all the Tech stocks and companies that shot-up fast are getting massacred yet this is holding strong. That a very good sign. I added more today.

"Just bought more at $32.69. Like I said a few days ago, PLTR will trade sideways and consolidate for a while. But you will make far more money by buying and holding instead of trying to sell at the top and buy back at the bottom. PLTR is still in an uptrend."
"This should be trading at the highest P/S ratio in the game.The fact that it is not is a beautiful opportunity.The world is going to be unrecognizably different in 2030. China will likely surpass USA in GDP.Rewatch the palantir scene from LOTR. There’s an important reason, even from an investor standpoint, to understand why they named the company Palantir."
got my stimulus and tax return money. added 101 more pltr shared and going to work now and will be adding my tips that i get from work to pltr too
"Just bought 4K shares , this is now my largest investment. Did I make the right move guys"
"Hold the line, $30 here we come"
"Everyone on here is bashing like an expert but fails to realize the NASDAQ is down 2.5% and the S&P is down 1.5% Ya thanks genius, obviously every major company is going to be down today Whatta surprise. Pltr will be fine. This company isn’t going anywhere."
"Apple, great earnings and trading side ways, ￼ peloton great earnings but sold off because of demand issues, Palantir sells off after great earnings, Twitter goes higher and barely beats earnings. This is the market we live in."
"Cathie ""Diamond Hands"" Wood"
"Shorts are so funny, go ahead and short $27 and recovery your lost at $30 tomorrow haha, or shortTesla at $3,500 per share haha...."
"In the same breath Cramer says PLTR ""...is a very good company."" Only questioning a quickly ARK increased position. One minute he says it's solid, another minute questions why invest so much. My guess is he wants in at a lower price before Q1 earnings."
i listened to those shorties and sold all my PLTR positions yesterday. what do I do now?

The company for people who don't bash America!!
Like = BuyDislike = Sell
Amazon AWS news is bleeding through the wires and MM are still shorting. Market manipulation.
Buy the dips
Today we are manipulated by market makers. All charts are following the same intraday pattern.
"My fellow Palantir comrades,Hold on to your PLTR stock because:1. PLTR has virtually no competition2. PLTR worked on its software for 17 years3. Think of 17 years = Gathering specific requirements from the government, DESIGN, CODING, TESTING, DOCUMENTATION, etc...4. Any competitor has to deal with a LOT of time to try to catch up with PLTR5. Google is SCARED of the fact that team (AWS + IBM + Palantir) are now working together to Bring down the Google house of cards (DATA is what Google collects from all of us)6. There is a possibility that Amazon or IBM may ACQUIRE Palantir for 100's of BILLIONS of dollars7. Many people don't know what Palantir software does. Here are some examples:...a. Many businesses have millions of customers' DATA located in many files, databases, and profiles. ...b. Palantir will gather this historic data, analyze it, and actually tell your sales team that this customer will be ready to buy a $25K car because his/her current car is old and historically this person NEVER spends more than 30K to buy any car....c. Palantir will tell your sales team that this person prefers to fly United Airlines and goes to a Beach vacation during the month of July. So, your sales team will be presented with a nice offer to fly to Virginia Beach, with United Airline, Hotel, and free museum tickets to Virginia Beach any week during this coming July....d. Obviously, Palantir works with the government/military and many of the services that Palantir offers to the government/military are NOT available to the public... BUT, Palantir can leverage that experience to create Commercial software because of these government/military contracts8. Now you know why Google who COLLECTS and ANALYZES data from your email, search, Google Drive, etc... is SCARED of team (Palantir + IBM + AWS)9. Fair enough?Peace!"
"Congratulations to everyone who bought yesterday on the big dip. Every time a stock like Palantir dips and you buy, you’re just buying value. This is an amazing company with strong contracts that are locked in with the government and just those contracts will increase 30% year over year. This company is strong because they sell contracts left and right.I <3 Palantir"
A no brainer $60 in 90 days
These discount prices make me want more 
"Hey, could Palantir-Foundry implement their software to a, say, Bloomberg terminal? I'm sure Big Banks, Investment Banks, and Wallstreeters would love the extra layer of Financial Analysis DD at their disposal. Just wondering."
"Let’s be very clear about the lockup expiration. It makes absolutely no difference what amount of stock gets sold, as long as investors see the value in a stock and a company then there will buyers.Palantir has a monopoly on what it can do and it is the future. There will be buyers today and tomorrow and ever increasing amount as long as Palantir offers value. I did not buy Palantir to get fixated on a few days of trading, particularly on something that we have expected since October. I bought Palantir because of its products, management, future growth and that it has a monopoly. Peter Thiel and Founders fund own nearly 14%. Palantir is his baby and he will make sure his company becomes the next conglomerate, as he has done in the past. The DD is done, hold or buy the dip. Then let Palantir do all the work then."
"An International Mining Company... California Electric... British Petroleum... and the biggest fish so far, IBM. PLTR landed all of these in the past few weeks, plus others. And they are just getting started - just like your portfolio...because this is going to be $60 by spring. Mark this post."
"Oh boy, once we break through 26.00 this is gonna fly so fast"
"$150 stock by November, the Stupidest analysts will soon be crowned for lack of knowledge, like Cramer...."

Nice to finally see this stock spark up a little  pltr needs a few good days.
Unusual activity coming for PLTR same like RKT GME.. get ready everyone.

Palantir and IBM partner to deliver Palantir for IBM Cloud Pak for Data
Is this forum just for short sale day trader? I don't understand how a stock only down 3% in a day is considered a failure when the whole market is in red right now. These are the best days to buy and average down for bigger gains in the future
I got to ask. I might understand if you are day trading. Who cares about the price a week from now. This is a buy and 5 years from now you will be grateful. September was 10 bucks. Stocks don't go up daily NEVER
Cramer has a lower price entry point for PLTR. He wants to buy but will try to push it lower before buying.
Next week the big contract is coming be ready shorts
"Lol imagine being the guy who sold around $21 thanks to peer pressure, BS, and panic "
"Made more research, HD, COCA, AMEX etc bought PLTR' service years ago. and cancelled later because can not bring profit rather than high price cost. even such big player do not want spending on PLTR, strong sell for sure!"
PLTR lets ....

Lost a fortune in this stock this week. But  s
CNBC reports thisPLTR reported 4th qtr 2020 earnings of $0.06 per share on 2/16/21. This beat the $0.02 consensus of the 6 analysts covering the company.
"Cathy added 1,560,200 shares on 2/16 (Tuesday). I think I will follow suit."
This will be very active at 3:30 as this is last day before earnings Tuesday morning as market is closed Monday.
I’m so tired of Palantir’s red days.. and my portofolio being on negative..... come on men..
wondered what price AARK paid for this
Hooders..double down now. Sleepy Joe has already promised to send a $2K stimulus check.
"$30s next week, March will be a great month and now stimulus 1.9T approved!"
Feels like something weird is going to happen on Monday.. something doesnt feel right
"Just picked up some more, buying opportunity"
Thank you again for your shares. Heading out for the day. See you all later and have fun.
"Its starting to take offff, lets break 26"
"lol, check the daily chart... a huge volume... interesting......"
I sold out all of PLTR between 40-45. I am scared of Cathie playing.I be buyer again at 10-12 till then let Cathie do whatever.
Let’s break 26.90 come on !!!
"Still pricy today, from $11 jumps"
"Hey everyone, tough day today, tough week!It will come back, just gotta wait it out. I've been in since $10, and I'm not selling!"
Tomorrow will bring more....
How are you $20 bagholders feeling today? This is an expensive lesson to not get caught up in hype
Hope you all bought the dip last week
People think that Stocks never recover and that we’re all going to live in Caves soon
"ARK yesterday bough $45,220,957.44 (3 times more why they bought in November)... and by the way, they are not loosing money. Inform yourself (e.g. Tom Nash on youtube)"
West coast wake up now. we go 30
just a thought...imagine palantir create a search engine for public use like Google -
"Got more at $20.95, averaging up."
"Can you guys imagine, next Q we will see this company becoming profitable! That's gonna be amazing! The price will jump so high!  My guesses are 65 dollars a share! And EoY we will see 95!"
I was all about diversification etc... until Palantir started dipping and sold all my equities to purchase Palantir...Wish I had more to have a bigger position ...
"Bears enjoy your time, it wont last for long. I dont want to see you next month or next year. I don’t care if it drops 5 o 10 or 20%, this is an investment, a value investing. If it dips i will add more, for sure. This will probably join the s&p one day"
going to 28
M is on mute. Board looks better already. There will be more to join that lost soon.
Reddit: We like PLTR!Hedge Funds: Let's short PLTR!Cathie Wood: I like it too. I bought 5 million shares.Hedge Funds: NOOOOOO!!!!!!

"GOLDMAN SACHS UPGRADES PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES TO BUY, RAISES PRICE TARGET TO $34BZ WireGoldman Sachs analyst Christopher Merwin upgrades Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) from Neutral to Buy and raises the price target from $13 to $34."
Hope the Reddit Gang is attentive to what manipulating funds are doing to this Honest stock !!
Palantir rumored to be signing with AT and T or Verizon or both
Palantir $PLTR deal with AMAZON AWS came into effect today. HUGE.
Did I hear them correctly? They've done 47% growth in 2020 and they're looking to grow about the same rate for Q1?
Bought in today when down a little over 9%. Could have waited before the close but I'll be holding this for years. The operating loss is due to ramping up and expansion.
Wow... glad to see this week gone
Investing in Palantir is honestly a no brainer. In the past 3 months there's been positive report after positive report - deal after deal. And this is just the first year of going public!
I’m going to put half my stimmy into palantir I don’t even know what it does but who cares
US stimulus approved......big things for Palantir?
Panic buying on tech stocks seems to be starting.
"Future me will thank myself for holding. This is the next Apple, Microsoft, Tesla stock"
"nice bear trap tracing the Nasdaq, might be a red day today but monday will be green"
JUST 5 DAYS TO GO!
"Will this correction continue tomorrow or not, that is the question . . ."
i am in at 37 will be holding till 80.
"but Catty bought more, but but.....rofl"
"Sold mine $27.45 a while ago. Meant to buy back around $25 but failed. Watched it all the way to $45. Never wanted to chase due to its high valuation. Thought it might stay above $30. Well, time to buy back?"
When I bought Tesla it collapsed aswell...then it doubled....Hold the line!!!
I'm going to make a bold prediction and say Nasdaq going to $10000 if all tech stocks correct to reasonable values.
"Stop worrying... its not the stock, its the market"
So are we going to make more volume than yesterday? Thumbs up if you think so!
27 today
i learned a very painfull lesson with MODERNA.....lesson- $20 stocks can be manipulated just like $.20 stocks just in a different manner...i will hold for 200+...no doubt 1-3 yrs....YeshuaIsLord
If you guys want this continuing going down! Let it go! But pump it! Again to 40s! In 1 month! I will hold! I won't lose money with this!
We are back baby let’s do this 
i have lost 10s of thousands now in this and what makes most annoyed is that the company doesnt have a vision..just some vision to be the united states ..the eagle eyes like in the game of thrones and karp thinks hes the freezer king ...its totally annoying..give us real updates like how many hits on aws or ibm sales etc...thats really whats supposed to be happening yoj cant start blaming non western values for not making money
"Q1 Guidance is 45% rev growth, +$103m. But guidance for entire year is 30% (+$327m). So Q1 will represent 31% of the guidance for the year, leaving 3 more qtrs to generate $224m. Clearly the large amount of Calls reflects a big “beat” is coming, plus a big guidance improvement. $4B will be the target not for 2025, but 2023."
ARKK and ARKW added. A lot.
Who wants to buy my PLTR shares for $50?
Strong base at $32. We will never dip into the 20s again. Only up from here $50 by earnings.
Shorites lol
$44 by tomorrow
AWS tendering offer for PLTR - could be as high as 41.50 per share -----
"If you were an pltr executive, would you sell a boat load of PLTR options at $25 knowing in a few months it will be some crazy high price like you believe. Thoughts ? The entry point for this stock is below $20 to hold for a few quarters."
Goldman has a $34 Price target. They're relieving GME traders of their Palantir shares at a discount for themselves.
"Add another 500 shares short, trend is so clear, thanks for dreaming bulls!"
Never ever bet against Peter Thiel!!! He will make use all RICH!!!!!!
"Remember that ARK, Baillie Gifford, Blackrock and Vanguard all added in Q4 2020... also PLTR have made very interesting new deals. This will be a winner in 2021 and forward... Long and strong in this awesome and interesting stock."
I like Palantir have a long position. Just took a position in AABB a company creating a crypto currency backed by gold. They are up over 90% in just two days. It's OTC and risky but sounds very promising.
"Whatever happens today, we are together longs."
"So, where is Karp? Skiing in Austria?"
40 end of March
Wow so it broke $28. Time for $25 again I guess
Less than 24 hours!
$TSNPD & $PLTR are my long term babies. I feel bad for you if you don’t agree.
I’m jumping back in at $20
Can you imagine... Everyone expecting 50s....and this is now at 25! BTW... I'm 30% down! 
"This week bites but if this will one day become a trillion dollar company or anywhere close, I will give the ups and downs of times like this a pass lol. Let’s get to it..."
Keep on Lifting...Higher! Higher and Higher!!
Everyone knows PLTR is above 100 in️️️️
"Those that are selling , have no Confidence in Management for ER. These people know what they are doing, Tues will be Great."
"You make the $$ not in selling or in buying, but in Holding."
"$15 target, maybe lower."
So I watched/listened to the call earlier and I liked what info I got out of it.I listened to the questions from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs analysts both congratulated the Palantir team on the past quarter.Then the sell off.And then this evening we learn that one fund has added 1.6 million shares. The only one that reports daily. So what do we learn? The big money wants in. I suggest you follow the big money too.
Of course the final price will be right on the pin for options reasons.
"Lesson for you all. I had 1100 shares of SQ at $38, sold it for 10K profit, I had 1000 shares of PINS at $19, sold it for a few thousand in profit....Lesson to learn? Look at these stock prices now...HOLD pltr."
Auntie Cathy bought 5 million shares today.
Frankfurt premarket - 25.86 (+9.74%)

Ok longs... just relax.. it will finish green. It my take 1 step back but in a day it could walk up by a few steps. Relax!!! Stay long and strong!!!
This is very heavily shorted and it's still happening those are facts...it will swing back..but not until alot of damage and sellers or panicked people give up...I've seen this game 1000 times..this will be 50 or 60$ stock by Summer guaranteed
"anyone know about the reddit group coming to pltr? if it's true, oh my gosh. PPS $100,> 150, >200, 250, 300, 350 $400 PPS. If not I'll settle for $100 PPS."
"As the price of a stock falls it becomes less risky, not more risky."
i'm just about done with my 1500 shares in this thing. so frustrsting

I am reading karps thesis. Just thought you d like to know.

"Day traders' easy money buy 1000 shares @ $26, sell @ $27 reload and repeat all day long..."
It is all right now. Red.
20k shares added today y’all. Let’s go 
"from what I gather the CEO is unwilling to tell the world about what pltr does with the information it gathers he also doesn't care if people invest or not he states it's a big world out there and we can invest in whatever we want no one is forcing us to buy pltr I genuinely love this idea that he can't be bullied nor bought or pressured by wall street or big investor companies I believe the secrecy around pltr has more to do with keeping control of their business more than anything if they start telling the world everything we should see copying so I'm 110% investing in pltr not only have they secured almost 20contracts in the past 4 months on this year but they have successfully gained confidence in renewed contracts. ark BlackRock and many more investors have bought millions of shears I see a future in companies that refuse to be controlled so #$%$10,000 of my personal money will be put into this company and left for 5 years I won't look at it again till this day in 5 years"
"Huge dip AH, who sold their shares?"
the sellers who feel smug selling their tech grow stocks right now they're gonna go over and get steamrolled ... cramerhttps://youtu.be/tFwxNk5dit0

Ark bought the dip about 1.6 million shares today.
glad you didn't panic sell :)
waiting for a lower dip to get further in the red hahahaha
"$50 in two months..... sure, I'll buy all I can at $25"
Palantir is 47.5 Billion and Snowflake is 50.5 Billion today. What's the deal? We're worth more at 40X than their 85X price to sales.
WSB lost today to management selling shares.

WE FOLLOW CATHY AND SHE WILL LEAD US TO THE  SO STAY STRONG AND LONG 50.00 COMING!
"Lots of pointless talk and guesswork.Is the stock on its way to the moon in a crazy run as many forum participants hope? It may or may not be.Would be very nice if so.But, we invest in a stock that we believe in its vision and future-breaking products.The stock will grow as the company continues to develop and market its products. I believe IBM joined the partnership on the understanding that “if you can not beat them, join them.” Think about IBM's considerations in the deal and understand where PLTR is going...... Patience is the key word and for the kids investing in the stock, I would love a quick run to relax a bit. good luck to us."
I'm losing my school money. let all pltr investors write to support reddit and elona parlantir
Today $26?
plz someone call the KARP to inquire why I'm going bankrupt after investing in this future company
As I wait for the US market to open
Ya im out. Out of palantir. Out of all nasdaq stocks
"NASDAQ is going green very soon, so do we AH."
Good to see Palantir partnering up with many tech companies. Future is very bright!
that runup at the open yesterday probably had nothing to do with retail investors. i'll bet that a fund got wind of the deal and added to their position. about 8 million shares.
"Are you a  follower or have you done your DD? Makes no difference to longs. If you panic sell, we buy. Longs win, shorts win, panic sellers lose."
THE PLTR TRAIN ON ITS WAY TO $40+ALL ABOARD AND FASTEN YOUR SAFETY BELTS!GO PLTR!
I can laugh about this “misery” ‘cause eventually I’m laughing all the way to the moon bank with this stock.
I loaded the boat again and drove my dollar cost average down to $23.38. You have to take advantage of these days and dollar cost average down.
Great company to write covered calls on
Bought more today. I thought I got good deal when I purchased some shares yesterday. Looks like today is even better. On sales guys!
can PLTR ever keep its gains.... up 2$ in the morning and now up a mere 0.50 cents.

If u didn't buy that dip to 25 u really missed a once in a lifetime opportunity
big news on the way dont sell
PLTR: looking for upward move from here. Going green later today and next week!!! GLTA
It’s strange how so many of you bought the stock and have no clue what you actually invested in  Wow.
Buy at open before it blasts off!
Why hasn’t yahoo said anything about Jeffries raising price target to $40?

Bro these next few days/weeks are a golden opportunity to scoop this up
I'm at peace with PLTR. I trust this company and its upside potential. You should too. Dont watch every price change. It will just stress you out.

44 @ 1 june. Keep buying...
Great work today guys! Keep holding WHO IS WITH ME
I opened a cashapp just for the sole purpose of buying 1 PLTR share per day. It's obviously not my only brokerage acct or PLTR position but it keeps me committed. Goal is to have 200 shares in that account by the end of the year. It's kind of fun to log in each day and see the price I'll be paying.

they call him tom the tank engine for a reason. his portfolio is tanking
Interesting article by John Rhodes on seeking alpha concerning his view on upcoming earnings and price going forward
PLTR id honestly the best stock you could purchase on the market. It’s like buying apple or Tesla at 40Billion market cap. I’m not selling for anything less than $420.69
"1. I will start thinking hard about selling PLTR once the price goes up to $272.0 It seems that PLTR will be playing between $23 to about $28 in the next few weeks3. Many commentators keep saying ""To The Moon"" and saying that PLTR will trade for $100, $150, or $200 in the next 2 years...4. These same ""Cheer Leaders"" said the same thing when PLTR traded at $30, $35, $40, and $45... Then: BOOM, the price is back to reality and trading at $23 to $25 AGAIN5. Conclusion: If you bought at $23, SELL when it goes to $27 and buy again when it goes back to reality around $23 to $256. Today's stock market is not setup for LONG TERM anymore...7. The Millennial Generation as well as institutions and people like Catherine Wood will QUICKLY FLIP PLTR stock and move on to the Next FAD stock...8. Fair enough?Peace!"

what a coincident that GS upgrades it to a buy right before the lock-up period sets to expire on 2/18... So they want you to buy it when their clients are selling... Umhhh....
Looks like the larger players want to accumulate PLTR. HOLD
This is Soros dumping his shares. Short term fall but good riddance to him and his cronies.
Whoever said it would’ve closed green should perhaps reconsider
"It's curious with all of the negative press today, how many people didn't sell."

"I’ve been in this company since $13 a share; buying various lots with prices ranging from 13-36. Haven’t sold a share and have been trading covered options against my positions, slowly inching back some of my losses. I originally bought this on hype, but once I dove into the fundamentals and watched their demo day, I was sold for the long haul. I’m a firm believer in the long term total addressable market here, that has, for the most part, not been fully tapped, and I’m excited to see what other companies will decide to partner. These last few weeks have been incredibly difficult, but I haven’t considered selling once. Both green and RED are an integral part of being an investor in the stock market, you must take the good with the inevitable bad. I’m not going anywhere anytime soon, cheers to the ride for the next few years."

PLTR inks a 6 year deal with FURCF to use their Foundry platform
predictions end of 10 years? i think if the contracts come in steady as they are now. this company may certainly have a value of 350$
could go up to 45 by next week
12 pm was screaming buy
See the live press conference from White House
People with cash should take this as opportunity. Wait for the bearish market to bottom out and scoop up the opportunity stocks.
We live in a world where a company without financials and mere speculation can run 1400 percent in 3 months. but palantirs revenyes increased 47 percent from last year and people sell.
Pltr to the moon 
ALL HAIL PALANTIR
if we open above $30 we can see an interesting day
Was always a hype stock. Going to $13 quickly.
You still doubt?
"Okay, instead of ""Buy the dip!"", do we have anything else cheery to say? How about ""Set it and forget it!""?"
"Ark now owns 16,010,363, added 400,000 this week and purchased as it went up !!! The upcoming Demo will shed light on the future, buy on any dips because this will head north very soon."

"Insiders and Soros keep selling.Cathy is a paid buyer of stocks because Wall Street,institutions and insiders need people like her to buy and promote stocks.I've seen this movie 100-200 times before. $15 coming."
Why is everyone hating on the insider sales? If I had put in the sweat-equity for 17 years building a company I’d cash in some rewards too. Everyone just goes immediately to the negative.
ARK is over 100 percent ..ARK buying the PLTR like crazy humm im buying more .https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/03/03/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-over-2-6-million-palantir-shares/
I think 27.25 is where its headed
very interesting the way this has held up recently
"As the late,great Joh Belushi said...Let's do it!"
"My fellow Palantir amigos,1. Cathie Wood seems to be a smart investor2. She did buy PLTR at different prices this year and it seems that she bought, mostly, in the $22 to $26 price range3. So, it seems that, as far as PLTR stock is concerned, Cathie Wood has paid, on average about $24 per share this year...4. Looking at the current price of PLTR = $24.86, as I am typing, it seems that Cathie Wood is doing ""OK"", but not ""Extremely OK or Great"" as far as her PLTR stock pick5. In other words, considering the period of this year from Jan-1-2021 until today, it seems that Cathie Wood is ""really no smarter than the average Joe who is buying PLTR""....6. Is Cathie Wood = Hype? Shall we follow her stock moves? Is she working with these companies to trick investors into buying stocks that are just average stock? Does she get financial kickbacks from Palantir? Tesla?...In other words is there a conspiracy between big investors and hyped companies?Peace!"
300 more shares then in part of the 1k club!!!
What a great buy opportunity! 
Really nice to see that PLTR has been consolidating quite steadily even with fears of rising 10 yr bond yields.
"I'm a decent investor, not an expert by any means. For many of us retail investors, this is a long-term no-brainer. A.I. is going to be a huge part of first world and emerging economies long into the future. Growth in this sector is inevitable and stock prices can seem disconnected from the reality of the moment but it's important to have forward thinking hindsight to really experience growth in your portfolio. Keep doing your research."
Just remember when countries have problems who do they turn to? You guessed it !
"I’m cashing out, will be back at 23"
SOMETHING REAAAALLLLYY BIG IS COMING.....IBM + AWS= FOUNDRY
Who’s holding for $50 or HIGHER?
This is too painful to watch...Let's change the subject...I bought a Big Mac for lunch and 6 pieces of Spicy Chicken Nuggets My first time trying the Sbicy Nuggets. They were great.
"Remember: Buy and hold is the most consistently successful investment strategy. 1. Buy a company with a compelling business proposition, 2. Don't get distracted by the noise of occasional bad news and red days, 3. Focus on the long-term (2 years and longer). I went all in on solid Oil and Gas companies exactly one year ago. I am now millionaire and I am planning to retire this Summer when I turn 40. I'm using much of those gains to invest in the Palantir team and I have no doubt they will succeed (and I'll succeed from their success). $20, $30, or $40 is all the same when this thing is $200 in 5 years."
Next support $22.50
By April 50+
Revenue up 40 percent and it drops like a rock?
"+ 2,54% in preopening Frankfurt"
Bought some more shares and muted a lot of clowns. That’s a successful day in my book. Thanks again Alex for doing a DPO for the retail investors. 
"When others panic and sell, you hold.Scared money don’t make money, if a 3 week period of red is enough to make you give up all hope and cut & run, you’re clearly in over your head when it comes to investing.At that point you may as well stick to gambling in your free time .If it was as simply as buy the stock with a “buy” rating, fancy PR news, 2-3 month trend of green, and good “fundamentals”, everyone would be rich.This is a game of risk. Every stock has risk. Any given day, week, month, or year (COVID 19) could be trash . If you can’t handle losing some unrealized gains, this isn’t for you.Idc what these trolls say, neither they or you can predict the market with certainty. Your best bet is to focus on the long term, where the market generally grows."
one of these days
"This has been a TECH sell off, not just a PLTR sell off over the last 2 weeks.99.9% of the “hot” tech stocks like PLUG, NIO, TSLA, etc etc are in the red the past week-2 weeks.Not a PLTR issue, hold strong or regret it later.You don’t sell because the next guy is selling. You sell if you believe fundamentals have changed, which they have not . People are panic selling because they haven’t seen green in days, that’s when you hold and trust the market will rebound. 99% of the time it will "
will be $50 on Tuesday
I have a total of 541 shares now. 250 at 10 and 250 at 43.51 and 41 buying the dips.This stock is long term play and I plan on keeping this for 30 years. I am 23 years old and will be putting 30 dollars a week into this stock and 70$ a week into the s$p500 Although pltr will be 30% of my portfolio. I believe in 30 years the price will increase so much that it will invert the effect of the 30/70 split in doing and be 70/30
The pre-market means nothing as volume is very low and spread can get very wide.I don’t see the price going under 25.5 support at all and even if it get there it will be by the end of trading day as some traders might decide to take some profit before the weekend.
do you think that palantir price will go up after earnings? It looks like earnings will be positive so I think it would be good to load some more shares
The year is 2025. PLTR has continued it's tremendous growth rate of 45% a year and forward guidance looks to be about the same for the next 5 years. Stockholders rejoice as the bullish outlook pushes the stock above 30.
"Can't stay down for long, Green closure."
"Worldwide revenues for artificial intelligence software, hardware and services will grow over 16% annually from 2021 to 2025 to reach $327.5 billion, forecasts International Data Corp."
way undervalued
"If you are a seed investor who is seeking a good future harvest $$$$, P'Lant'ir."
"Can’t be too emotional on green or red days. Considering how the market is in its current state, nobody in here knows what PLTR will do in the near future, if they say otherwise they’re BS’ing just like the trolls telling you to sell .Embrace the short term volatility and accept it for what it is.Whether up or down 10% on Monday, it means nothing in 5 years.THAT is where I can tell you PLTR is still a sleeper and will be worth considerably more long-term.Lock up is done.Panic selling due to citron/earnings/lock up period is done.Now it’s catalyst based growth moving forward. Those earnings should continue to improve as well.Got in <$10 and will be holding for the next 3-5 years.Appreciate the 25% discount "

Follow the money flow. Last 2 weeks big money are buying tech sector and retail is shaken out as always. Sell now and buy back in 2 weeks LOL
"Nice, but all those shares she bought at 25 didn’t stop us from going under 23 today. If she becomes too overweighted in this stock, the danger is that other Wall Street predators will do to her what WSB did to Melvin Capital Mgt with GME, but in reverse. Still heavily long, but nervous."

Added more under $26
"PLTR is turning out to be a worse investment than my house. I'm down 30% in 5 years on that including 5% down Jan 2020-Jan21. Everything I touch turns to dust. Still, I hold."

"Looks like selloff halted and institutions picked up discount shares. Whoever stays long should enjoy the ride from now on. The company is old, but the products they offer are still young and technically no competitors. We should just wait for the market to mature and I am happy to ride along with it."
ticker jumping between 24.99-25.01 means someone has a FAT buy order for 25
Nice and steady. Keep accumulating at market price.
Like this comment if this is gonna go up tomorrow
It will never ever come back to this price again. Mark my words!

This will lift off in 3 minutes.
Move up on strong volume is what we needed to break through and looks to be what we are getting. Keep pushing.
I’m bought 3 more at 29.01 today. Now I have a total of 523 shares at average of 31.57
I should have bought more yesterday. best is to come
"Lol so much impatience.... you make me laugh.If doing well in the stock market was as simple as buying a stock that’s been trending green week-to-week, is upgraded as a buy by so and so, and had a phenomenal earnings report: we’d all be rich.Reality is this is a risky business. Your portfolio could be cut in half tomorrow. The entire market could crash due to some insane event. Etc etc.Patience is your best bet. All this red/green/trash/to the moon stuff is nonsense.PLTR is experiencing the same volatility as much of the tech market currently, + some hangover from the lock up expiration.Facebook was down 50% for quite some time after it appeared on the market, countless other examples out there.Accept the volatility, stop stressing day to day and stress year to year = you’ll sleep better.Have a nice day, shoutout to the REAL longs that have been here since DPO day like myself.

CNBC clip said GME like squeeze. This is going to take off!
The good news is no one will sell their shares Friday.

And where are the paid actors hiding. Where the screams - $ 45.
REALLY strong AH price moment. We will see $28s and maybe $30 tomorrow. Strong strong.Once the insiders stop the sales we will see a gradual increase back to $40s with upgrades (should be any day) and continued contracts.
"After hours, up 0.69% up! Nice!"
My current portfolio is 60% PLTR and 40% Tesla
This company just partnered up with 3M should be over $40 this week
"But again, one had to be out of mind to short this stock!"
23 to 25 range bound
Get ready PLTR about to take off to 40$
Finally started a position at $26.36....fingers crossed
pltr
I always wanted to buy this stock. starting with 500 shares @ 25. let's go
ARK just bought 5 mil in shares
$40 Baby !!!
I didn't have any more chips with which to enjoy the dip...
Dont get it.. if insiders are dumping why is cathie woods buying... what sdoes she know that they dont...
"a manipulating hedge fund is Very Jealous of Cathy Woods, it won't work,Reddit gang will get them."
Will it close at the high of the day?!
looking based on the fair value (from simply wall st) this is undervalued (fair value @28.83) 
PLTR is the only one queen which is running.Hence I feel whoever buys here will double their money fastGl
For people who’ve been bag holding at 30: we’re coming for you
"there are plenty of other places to put your money said KarpI've never seen a worst communication, maybe a genious but must be helped by a real communicantHe doesn't need our money ? But glad when he sells his options and free shares"
"Usually when I buy stocks, they start falling..I bought this yesterday and this one is making me money. It’s weird.."
5000 shares holding till 500 a shares in 5 years !!!
brought 600+ @ 28 wishing for the best rn !!
The graph shows a positive move for the next week or two. Enjoy it while it lasts.
I like the stock
"Yup ,1.6million...ark must be worried about the lock up as well"
The whole day around 25. Feels like manipulation. Anyway bought today
We will close today $67.05
"keep adding little by little since $29 after it fallen from 45. Never expected that $pltr will hit hard. If my predictions are correct, $pltr will turn back to 30 by next friday."
Been an investor of Palantir pre direct listing. Just give your money to the smartest people in business and let them grow your money. Just keep adding slowly and I believe in a few years this stock will be trading in the 200s.
That jump to 28$ at the end should tell it all
"20 years, no profit. A single product that is difficult to scale. What am I missing? Why is everyone so bullish? Because of Cathie bagholder Woods?"
"I'll listen to bears if there is any sign of intelligence. That said, I haven't seen a real bear on this thread yet."
Robinhooders... DO YOUR HOMEWORK!
It will just take one day to get from 25 to 31 so relax and patiently wait￼. Rally will happen sooner than later.
i just load $23s whever i see it. Got another 3500 shares in $23s today..
"To whom it may concern, lack of patience and expectations is creating your anxiety."
"Although I saw the Amazon Web Services news, I did not realise that ERP was built as a new product specifically for AWS. It is a shame this news was eclipsed by the market volatility yesterday.Here’s the link:https://medium.com/palantir/launching-erp-suite-to-deliver-cost-savings-for-aws-customers-ceed6e6dd927"
That is how I feel
"Just saw the interview with Karp...The is THE reason why I have put some much $$ into PLTR, a man who does not shy away from the cowards among us so full of courage to complain on a twitter machine because someone hurt their feelings and they want someone to lose their jobs. He is not a 15 yr old in an adult's body! I will keep on buyin'...."
Upcoming news....people know! Its been two weeks since last contract announcement.
I want to own 100 shares of this before it blasts through 50s. adding slowly.
Thumbs up if your excited for the week coming
"All IPO/DPOs have to go through the founders/employees/investors cashing out their investment. If you are long and bought PLTR shares back in Oct-Dec 2020, your investment are safe forever I will be as patient as Cathie Wood to wait for longer term big return. There is some risk and may go down even lower, but the return is worth waiting."
i can only hear the short sellers screaming.... 
"Investors in Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Apr 16, 2021 $65.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.Buckle up!!"
2000 shares added at $26.25People can fret the drops or stagnation. I’ll remind you it was at $9 5 months ago... The earnings were as solid as we could ask outside of the negatives from stock based compensation.Insiders selling? lol. This your first rodeo? Name me one mega cap company where insiders don’t sell. These dudes get more shares as they hit milestones. Not like the rest of us who need to hold to realize gains.Grow up or get out. Money is moving from the inpatient to the patient as we speak.
"Chief Operating Officer, Shyam Sankar, Bought 600,000 Shares worth approximately $16000000, on 02/19/2021.Follow me on @money_stock_pick on Instagram for more details and Form 4"
volume .... isnt really speaking to me right now
if we hit back $40 i will sell half !! I'm super regret not take profit on last time.
This reminds me of Facebook s chart in the beginning Only difference Facebook had a ton of controversy before takeoff and still does
"Spent $1,287.90USD buy 53 shares of PLTR two weeks ago.Spent $242.10USD today to buy 9 more.I still owe $29kUSD in student loans. Logic tells me to pay off my student loans first but dammit, PLTR is too good of an opportunity to pass up. One way or another I will pay my loans..... BUT IM NOT SELLING MY SHARES."
I expect Friday to be an AWESOME day for PLTR.... To The Moon!!!
just bought 138 shares
Just added 200 shares
I lost 7K in less than 4 trading days.
Point and Figure improved with the breakthrough of $26. Should have little resistance there in the coming days.
been in pltr since 13 my favorite by far
This stock is 10% of my portfolio . I’m long dawg
in at 27. not selling untill i reach 100. #$#$ off hf
"Lol @ anybody who sold this past week or two.The entire tech market is down. All the favorites are in the red anywhere from 15-30% during this last 5-9 trading days.I spent the day adding to my positions in PLTR, PLUG, NIO, TSLA, APPS, OPEN, NET, CRWD, and others.When others panic for the sake of panicking, you hold strong and double down in the stocks you believe in.Will it work out for you 100% of the time? No. Will it be the correct move much more often than not? Absolutely.These big hedge funds can manipulate prices any given second, a little PR here & there, and boom: price is manipulated. They count on your weak hands to get in where they see fit.If doing well in the stock market was as simple as: buy the stock that’s been green for 3 months, everybody would be rich. If you believe in this position and/or others: STAY PATIENT. It’s been proven time and time again: the turtles win this race more often than not.I saw the same panic in PLTR when it was climbing from the 10s to 20s. Been holding steadily since $9.45 and adding on dips.Relax. It’s just a momentary down period, completely irrelevant in the 2-5 year trajectory of this company and others alike."
"If you don’t own PLTR and bashing. your a Fan , I’m shareholder I will give you autograph."
Some people on this board are comparing this company to FB and AAPL. Seriously? What is so unique about PLTR that the SP will 10X long term?
maybe I'll add more. moving out from $aapl to get into this $pltr
IM STILL HERE!
We can do it
Thanks for discount!!! <3
"Tuesday morning, release earnings !"
The price getting drived down before earnings is something to see from a good eye. Ive seen so many run ups to earnings and major selloff even at good news. So i think this is just perfect. People are not buying as much as they are waiting to see whats going to happen. The entry price will be a lot more alluring when the news come out. if this was in the 45's it would be perceived as expensive. In since 10 with a 19.40 average and looking forward to Tuesday! See you at 60 after earnings lads
why isnt this going up its supposed to be songreat
"The CEO said we hope long-term investors stay with us, if you expect short-term returns take your money to another stock. With that statement, I don't see this as the best place to put your money the next 3-5 years. But beyond that, I see it go parabolic"
"visited the website, looks like a scam to me. where is the product? quotes are cited like ""Executive Director—World Food Program"""
someone is trying to keep it above 25
ARK funds purchased roughly 2.6 million shares today
futures are down 220 as of now. Hopefully it doesn't affect $pltr tomorrow when the market opens.
Europe third wave and lock down not good
Heard this is a $250B company within 24 Months
PLTR upgraded to buy by Goldman -34 price tag!
Watching the price action
I see $50 by the end fo the year.
Cathie is buying pltr by the millions
Today we are starting red .. Nasdaq is Negative 1 dollar!But I hope we end green!
Wait to buy when ARK starts selling. He will have to do this.
Here you go 29.01-29.02 again... someone is buuuuuuuuying...
PLTR will be a candidate for a buyout from a big tech by the end of this year.
This is long term huge potential stockYou should hold more than 3 year if you don’t need moneyOr you can swing for profit between 1month-3monthsRemember don’t sell for you40$ price soon
"Thiel foundend paypal with Musk,what do you think guys if palantir signs with tesla?"
Up 5% after hours . Think I'll add in the morning.
when is this stock IPO ?
Bond yields reflect the booming economy is upcoming! 
Think one year out....Think two years out....I’m long at 3622 shares.
Thousands of tech-savvy IBM salespeople are currently scouring the world for new PLTR clients. :)
Believe in Cathie woods not any other agenda analysts. She said they not only invested in TSLA but traded it and made 175% profit on it. She bought millions of PLTR at this level. She knows other walstreet crooked tricks and plays against them very well.
HAHAHA / pretty good analysis eh Yahooey? HAHAHA
"45 to 22.6, it was a fight against myself, won and holding long. How about you? "
buy when others are fearful...never bet against america
100M volume in less than 1hr... the power of PLTR
We’re heading even higher this afternoon to welcome the even bigger rally next week!
any reason for this drop in price?
"Hi Friends, Have a look here in $SHIP, higher breakout above 50% expected soon. Dont missed out!"
"Well, whoever is in there’s no going back now! Premarket prediction for Tuesday is +$40"
i dont understand why...pltr is sleeping
From 45 to 28... hard to watch but will never sell.
I've lost more money in just this week than some people make in a year..lol..$55k down in just a week
"I love “coulda/woulda/shoulda” part of your sentence, I am in the same boat too many times, lots of times closed my positions for a small profit, shame! But, this times I am for the long haul till it hits the 10x target price, probably will have to wait till 2025!"
"For those who want to sell the stock this morning, please think about why you bought ? Please calm down, don’t let the anger control you, you don’t want to live in regret, do you?"
Slowly but surely! Reddit investorsAre gathering their funds now! Wait!
Nice that Palantir is discreet until big deals are done. Sudden revelations will make it likely that shorts get torched real good in due time.
anyone know what this uk lawsuit means for pltr short term
"At $27 several of my shares get called away from me on Fri. I'm still net long, but it's gonna be sad to watch them go... but that's why I loaded up under $22. I LIKE THE STOCK"
"PLTR is going to be a clear cut winner long term, this thing is going to be HUGE. Billions of $ in revenue and counting baby. I’m no joke extremely surprised this thing isn’t 40 again"
Announce another deal this morning and this goes to $40+
"About 85 days away from Q1 2021 Earnings. Q1 2020 was $229m. Guidance is 45% or $333m, (but does not include what is being closed and signed between Jan 1 and Mar 31). Expect 60%, $360m Rev--with 80% margin."
"The whole market is down,and the bearishs come back,what’s wrong in them?"
look at everything else sell off while this is holding support!
I see we have a lot of smart people here!
The only green in a sea of red lol
IoT will be fully realized through Palantir's software
24 has been broken
Just mute the  people just like we hang up on telemarketers.
i like the stock
"Buy $PLTR under $30 while you can. Palantir is a software innovator that will disrupt more categories than you realize.Today with market sentiment pulling back shouldn't stop PLTR from breaking 32 this week and continue climbing.Keep buying PLTR and holding 10+ years. Same goes for others you should be holding long include $NIO under 55, $NNDM under $14, $XPEV under $40."
News! Check their twitter!
40%+ in revenues and people are selling? I'm laughing all the way to the bank.
"you guys paying a premium on ""growth"". inflation is a guarantee and people will value fundamentals because they dont want to be in a hyperinflated environment. Do you guys think the economy will recover? If yes then you know interests rising is inevitable. This will be below 20 in like a month"
I’d give Cathy all my shares for Whig of her taint. No joke
ARK is in it for long term and they made it very clear. If you are in it now today for quick profit then you need to keep up with the pricing action and make your call.
Cashing out
I just bought 350 shares! Am I too late for the party?
HEAVY institutional buying. This is an undervalued gem that will be a 5x bagger at minimum by years end.
"rsi turned up, it's trading above the 13ema, on 3/5 we had a hammer at the bottom of the downtrend started the trend reversal to the upside... we begin the climb.... next stop 60.22ish.. let's go PLTRRRRR...."
I’m buying huge on Monday hopefully stay around same price. This is steal
https://medium.com/palantir/palantir-joins-weprotect-global-alliance-a22641c9670d
"we keep strong and long ""leaving the ship"""
It has traded in a 70 cent range today. That won’t last and it’s looking like the extension will be a move to the upside.
Pre market looks bad
I just want one day where I actually make more money than a day where I was down..that's seems almost iij impossible bc of math...or percentages. they should stop showing percentages bc that makes people stop
Holding for next five years
As I said 500m volume today to 33-35
Did you hear the good news...
"thx buy more , under 26 is a bonus!"
"Not bothered, very happy with earnings and plan to buy more today. Long and strong."
Held my 8000 shares through today’s dip and bought 5000 more shares. As a mid 20’s millennial. This is the easiest 10x I’ll ever make in the next 5 years.
We will end up green!
"How funny! Almost everyone here says buy, buy and buy including myself. But the more we buy the further it goes down. So who is selling? Is it hedge fund taking profit from weak hand?"
What is this! We were 5 % up! Now we are almost negative!
we are holding tight and thats awesome. as long as insiders stop selling we are good to run another good one....
If ur bearish than buy puts 2-3 months out and see what happens...
PLTR is a steal when it's below 30$. It will be above 50$ within next two months. 
we closeda @ almost 24.
If this hits 24$ it goes to 27
I see 50+ in the very near future
BEWARE: bashers on this board have no game in PLTR. they do not short or invest at all. they are dried up stock market geeks that make money commenting on comment boards.
"it will be green tomorrow. Friday, end of the week end of the month. everybody just hang on good news is coming"
Let’s go!
ALL IN
finish the day over 25 $$$$
A green day is a green day. I’ll take it.
What does this company even do?
I bought 3k yesterday at 37.37. Let’s keep it up
"“Oh now tech is doomed”“Market is crashing SELL NOW”“You’ll be a bag holder” “This thing is ”...they said.Yeah ok. See you in 5 years champ, let’s see how that money you saved by waiting on the sidelines pays off for ya.You don’t sell because others sold. You don’t panic and let a emotional low make you doubt your DD.So glad I bought the dips in TSLA, NIO, PLUG, PLTR, GE, among others. Idc if they dip further next week.Bring on the discounts .Shoutout to my real longs, oh and to the wannabe Nostradamus’s: you don’t make rash decisions based on a month of red. Having two brain cells will tell ya that.But your tears do taste delicious. I know you’ll be back on the next 2% dip to claim we’re going to $5, see you then (: "
"great price, i got in cheaper than ark. i'll hold as long as she does "
I think Palantir will get more news. It will go past 60$ without you if you get scared
The reason why it’s going down is because of the 25 USD put option which is expiring tomorrow.. so everyone is jumping on that ... so if I were you take the opportunity to buy tomorrow because it’s expiring tmrw.... this will shoot back to 30 with call options for March.... no brainier really
Someone bough 900K shares at the bottom.
Even some of you perma bulls will be blown away by the sales revenues we will soon start to see. Karps guidance was massively sandbagged growth numbers... Positive enough to justify valuation but limited enough to being consistent beats... We are 3-4 quarters away from the IBM and AWS partnerships to provide parabolic revenue growth...
PLTR is hiring in a lot of places.
Buy the DIP and let it RIP
"I have been selling off Apple shares every time hits highs and buying $tsla and $pltr....I think Tim Gay cook company is dead and Tsla will be next hot item to have, but I still do not know what pltr does..really. I just buy pltr because C. Wood buys it."
Has anyone else noticed the increase in market cap? Nearly 10 billion increase?!
"It may go down $1 in next 2-3 days, and then in one day it will go up by $10.That's how big players crush retail investors."
May see not $45 but $35-$40 again in 2 weeks???
"Executives selling Shares, This should be under 20 soon"
Karp is our leaderrrrrrr..... battle it out!!!!!!!..... No surrender!!!!!!!! 
Anyone using margins on pltr?
What’s the P/E of this company ?
Its gonna touch green and falll
What do y’all think about Monday?

I am a small investor but from what I have heard and read , I really like the long term upside to this company. I only have 50 shares, but I have a feeling I will be adding more."
"I’ll be the first to admit, when we were in the 30s I never thought we would see the 20s again. And, it resulted in high levels of stress when we plunged into the early 20s. BUT, what a blessing that was and it was the perfect opportunity to build a larger position, which was not part of the original plan at all. With that said, let’s get back into the 30s!"
tech getting wscked again like everyone warnee
Cathie wood is smart she dumped Apple and Facebook and loaded on PLTR and Teledoc on the dips. No bling PLTR will hit 100$ because it’s the cheapest quality stock now.
"What is negative about this stock? Only lockup, thats it."
for ARK a dollar or two down means nothing compared to 100 upwards... thats why they bought... like Karp said and Woods agreed short term means nothing to her... these shares yo her will cost double in a month if she does not get it NOW.
We will be just fine
"I can't buy. Etrade submits the market order, but it will not fill."

"How can you trust people who say: hold is long term stock.And the next day, the same people are selling massively."
I keep accumulating
For the 1000th time. For those fear mongering about the LOCKUP PERIOD....Who cares about lockup period. Do you think employees who are making $200K+ will burn money and sell all their shares when they know this is worth 5-10x in the long term???? what's wrong with people!
this is where smart stimulus money goes!
"Next couple of weeks are crucial- earnings and lock in expiry - what’s your take,  we make it through with ride up,  we just bleed down to under 30’s.I am hopeful to higher 30’s."
If today wasn’t a change in the tide then I’m not sure what is. Fantastic and I’m drinking the good stuff tonight. Not every day needs 10% to be a good day. Cheers!
Anyone else enjoy that delicious breakfast dip?
"We know how meme stocks can skyrocket. This is the only meme stocks that is also supported by growth and fundamentals...in the right field. Whoever bought in the 30s-40s, worry NONE.

Patience=Wealth"

"Nasdaq up, PLTR down!"
"So y'all are nervous because insiders are selling shares. Well, think about it in your own life folks. You work for a company for up to 17 years, take a diminished salary in exchange for stock options over the entire time you worked there (maybe you've left the company but still had a lot of shares), then your shares are released and you have the opportunity to cash in at 5-10X cost. DO you do it in order to diversify, pay off debt you incurred because of the smaller salary, invest in another startup? Yes you do, and you should. Stop losing your minds over a selloff when 800 million shares enter the float overnight. If you didn't expect this you don't belong in the market..."
“Palantir is a must have long term investment”.https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b1e29d2c-0ce1-3b63-87d9-115fb0754ea5/here-s-why-palantir-is-a.html
Just added to my position...
"Insiders valuated fair the value to be 7.25 $ at Direct Listing. Now they can sell for 25-30 $ to amateur investors, that has inflated the price 400%. Oh I forgot the 258M $ stock option program for the management. Thank you for our early retirement. Regards Cohen and his team."
Revenue: 1BIncome: -1.17BMarket cap: 41BShares : 1.9BBuy or sell??? You figure out by yourself.
we should positive around now
I'm seeing a lot of false reporting Pltr had a .06 earnings beat.
"Jimmy C says he cannot recommend PLTR because he needs to know what it does with the darkest, most secure corners of the government. Guess what Jim? You'll never know. Palantir is a monopoly. You always buy a monopoly as early as possible."
buying opportunity
"hey paaaaaaaaalantir, we wanna see the 45$ again! GO, PLTR LONG AND STRONG!"
It’s on sale!! BUY it up
It'll be a down day like this when we get the first big run!! Scare everyone out reverse sides up like a rocket!! They be very tricky!!
Palantir need to form alliance with 5G network vendors particularly NOKIA & Ericsson.
OMG! run for the hills . I's down 1%
ARKK is loading up more tomo can possibly make a run to $29 tomo
"Can’t sleep can’t do anything, counting the hours.  up up "
About to fall hard
Buy buy buy it will be 40+ by April buy and hold
This stock will be worth a lot very soon
market positive after all that amazing
Picked up another 100 shares today. In ten years this will be tantamount to buying NVDA when it was $30.
0.8% of Ark invest portfolio is in PLTR! Follow Cathie wood bulls and load up premarket! See you at 30$ tomorrow. And for the bears your dip will be above 30$ this week!
Alex Karp always does his media interviews in the snow. The real SNOW.
Huge volume in pre market. Lots of attention. Folks are aware of PLTR>It should be at $35 plus.
Goldman Sachs analyst Christopher Merwin upgraded Palantir Technologies ==》2.5X 
"PLTR tickerRemove from watchlist (Yes)Holding 2,011 shares - how much I care about the price now. There is a snail trying to climb my outdoor stair case, I think I’ll watch that."
"I’ve got 500 shares at $13.5, should I add another 500 and at what price?"
Mama Wood said it best earlier today. If you are in PLTR for the short term wanting profits this isn't the stock for you. Long term story and they are investing for the future now.
This reminds me of TWLO early days. Mid 30's to mid 20's and plenty of bashers. 4 years later 20X higher!
Broke through the $25 wall
. green ! let's go
I am in. Looks like $35 tomorrow.
A $27 open would be nice.
"If PLTR announces a new big deal, everyone will flip their jacket over in 2 seconds and say Karp is fantastic, his frankness is miraculous, this guy is awesome and everyone will want his barber's address.Okay, his communication is terrible, but I still prefer Karp instead of hypocrite Zuckerberg talking like a robot. Don't confuse Musk, this one is a junkie who has no talent other than having burned tens of billions with investor money.Karp is right, most people want a 10% or 20% gain every day, so actually go to the OTC, the bitcoin.On the other hand, he should attack algorithmic trading, HFT, robots that manipulate the price not small investors who invest their savings"
why didnt I buy this last week?
well that was easy
"Hahaha, I bought more..."
"1.9 T printed & oil are going up, another painful week."
"Nasdaq up to 2 days, PLTR drop on both days. No good."

"Food for thought grasshopper's, I bought Microsoft in 1988 and still hold a few, Palantir is about to write the next JCL.... if you get that... live long and prosper...."
How do you think market will react to the stimulus passed? Will investors worry about inflation or not?
Hey shorties...what happened to $25...???

I miss Palantir flying to the moon like Elon’s rockets..

"So far, holding up well considering how low the nasdaq dropped"
Palantir folks
In geman market PLTR leading top gainer pre-market

AWS AND PLTR TEAM UP
treasury yield is tickin up again. it was bound to happen ya know.. good luck on monday because i really dont know where grwoth and tech stocks are going but its not going to recover for at least month plus
$45-$60 after earnings?
Thumb up if you agree PLTR is a 100+ stock in ️️️️！
"Ok, so everybody was wrong regarding huge sell off happening today beacuse of lock expiration"
we’re mooning 
"PLTR is a long term investment as in the interview. Stop buying high, and selling low. Let the shorts do that, and buy back low under 25.00"
I believe that tomorrow the recovery will start.
Bears get slaughtered.
Good thing I grabbed those $29 calls!
So... do we recover tomorrow or Monday?
alot of buzz on this company from every where. AT&T hiring someone with experience in Palantir software. interesting
"It is sad to see small investors fall prey to the sophisticated game. Videos on YT, interviews, huge hype. And today you can see that small investors will become poorer and insiders will have additional $ billions."
"When Palantir breaks $ 20, both those who bought $ 10 and $ 30 will wear pampers."
The next tsla
"I’m in at 37, any opinions would be appreciated"
Reddit crowd just started action today. Much more to come.
26 calls expire toorrow!!!
thumbs up those who remember what i said last week about PLTR doubling up to over 45$ in 2 months or I would give up investing in stocks. I still believe that this will be over 45 in may. regards
The face of Cathies copy cats after looking at portfolio...
"I think one chance at this . I think Monday pre trading will be big. It’s time to clean out my watch list. Monday I will buy huge PLTR. Of course every one of my biotech stocks will triple as soon as I sell them . Let’s see how open is in morning first ...actually, I should give a hoot how it opens just do it"
Why is it falling
"As advised yesterday, buy under $25.You don't understand this company if you don't buy this under $30.PLTR is a $400+ long term stock. I expect it to be in triple digits within 6 months.Keep buying under 30 and hold until retirement."
So Woods was sitting at $25 all day buying and that's why it wouldn't go lower?!?
PLTR will become SkyNet!!!
HAPPY SAINT PATTY DAYS!!!
Let’s go
"PLTR is close to finding its bottom. Like I said before that big money will come in between $18 and $22, and it did on 3/5 and 3/8 between $21-$22 on above average volume. The stock may not go to the moon right away, but it will not go much lower either, it will likely find its footing in the next several weeks. Thus you will still have the opportunities to buy under $25, and this is close to the bottom."
"of course, as soon as I buy, it goes down. fml!"
PLTR solves problems the world can’t! Longs and shorts both know how high PLTR will surge!
"On the subject of value investing, SNOW just released Q4 earnings of 190.5 million revenue and 70 cents per share loss. PLTR released Q4 earnings of 322 million, and 8 cents per share loss. SNOW's market cap is 70 billion, and PLTR's market cap is 43 billion. Who would you invest your hard earned money in?"
"gonna get Whacked monday,cnbc reporters all jealous of Cathy Woods,try to show her wrong,they are"
any news about bonds?
Do you think this stock will go lower than current price? I bought months ago at $26.77. Should I sell and buy back when it’s lower?
"ARK bought 142,968 shares today, total today: 15,896,853. Cheers."
Wow PLTR contract with AWS. That is monumental.
This is like a huge middle finger to the market hahaha
"Just added 20@$24.76 for a total of 1,480 avg $15.5629 different lots lol The march to 2K continues!Good luck everyone!"
"We reached the bottom now, guys. The only way is up!"
Correct me if I’m wrong but isn’t the AWS huge news? This opens up tons of potential customers. Stock barely reacted.
Wondering why 24 is so hard to pass.
Anyone know what Typhoid Cathie's latest picks are so I can short them?
"Sometimes with stocks, there is one final huge  dip and then it takes off. I’m thinking will be in the green April 1. ￼"
Does anyone know if Ark bought today?
"Bought in at 27, but no worries here with a likely >2x from here this year. Stay schwifty"
Why would anyone pick $SNOW over $PLTR makes no sense.
"If Ark paid around 28.00 average for the 1,560.000 shares they bought today the tab would be about 44 million. Hard to believe no upside from here, numbers improving and more clients, I have been in since 10 bucks and not going anywhere."
Don't pull up your pants just yet. We still have tomorrow.
$25+ will hit on or before EOD Friday. Mark this post!!!!
"let it dip down for us! Opportunities raises once in a while, take it or leave it."
"Wow if ARK bought PLTR today as somebody mentioned, that is the best news so far..."
e everything looks great for tomorrow..so I guess this will end up down a dollar only
welcome to the bag holders meeting everyone please have a seat. heheheheheheh
"It will be awesome if we close above $30 today, that will be a great start to next week on our journey to $40"
Even I can spot a market manipulation of PLTR. Somebody is quietly accumulating shares.
Bag holder at 32.00 will triple my shares when price goes below 20.00. long and strong
22 is upcoming!
"...and here the shorts come, just like flies to dung...or DemOs to politics, whichever you prefer."
Seems like it has bottomed out and now ready for bull run. 32 is in sight within days if market remains green.
Holy smokes...Just logged on for first time today and that Anonymous guy is making some of us Anonymous's look bad... lol
The calm before the storm
Who said we weren’t gonna break $29? Later 
I hope we will not see this price again
This stock has only been around for 4 months on the open market and is JUST now getting more notoriety . What the heck do you all who are bashing performance expect? Delusional expectations are ruining your portfolio not this stock.

Very interesting article on PLTR in Seeking Alpha. Second headquarters in Switzerland? among other tidbits..
"Reality Check:As we speak, Pre-market (8:48am Eastern Time Zone):Volume = about 2 millionHigh = $23.85Low = $23.0So, we should expect PLTR to play between $22 and $23 as usual?"
"How is it possible more than $1down? Should then drop $10 down, if it's not a problems for PLTR."

So sad. Our friends at PLTR are losing money again.
I got 3000 at $17 ... and I am down by like $30K but still in GREEN. Not gonna sell anyway :) I believe in this company for the long term.
PLTR wil rebound back above 30 next week! It’s just My conservative estimate!tons of tailwinds in long term!
"In today with 1,200 shares. Not trying to time the market, long term hold, waiting for larger deposit to hit, want to own 6,000 in the next week when the deposit hits. Just looking at fintel, endless institutions keep buying and 0 are selling. I want to buy, lock away and check back in 10 years."
"They try to break the people and make them sell. If you’re in HOLD and don’t worry, it will go up again. They try to manipulate stocks like always do. Remember, the big money are made the the people panic. The big boys now they’re making good money."

"Elon Musk - Tesla, Peter Thiel - Palantir"
"Palantir Gotham is used by counter-terrorism analysts at offices in the United States Intelligence Community and United States Department of Defense, fraud investigators at the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, and cyber analysts at Information Warfare Monitor (responsible for the GhostNet and the Shadow Network investigation).Other clients as of 2013 included DHS, NSA, FBI, CDC, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, Special Operations Command, West Point, the Joint IED Defeat Organization and Allies. However, at the time the United States Army continued to use its own data analysis tool.[36] Also, according to TechCrunch, ""The U.S. spy agencies also employed Palantir to connect databases across departments. Before this, most of the databases used by the CIA and FBI were siloed, forcing users to search each database individually. Now everything is linked together using Palantir.""[36]U.S. military intelligence used the Palantir product to improve their ability to predict locations of improvised explosive devices in its war in Afghanistan. A small number of practitioners reported it to be more useful than the United States Army's program of record, the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS-A). California Congressman Duncan D. Hunter complained of United States Department of Defense obstacles to its wider use in 2012.[68]Palantir has also been reported to be working with various U.S. police departments, for example accepting a contract in 2013 to help the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center build a controversial license plates database for California.[69] In 2012 New Orleans Police Department partnered with Palantir to create a predictive policing program.[70]In 2014, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) awarded Palantir a $41 million contract to build and maintain a new intelligence system called Investigative Case Management (ICM) to track personal and criminal records of legal and illegal immigrants. This application has originally been conceived by ICE's office of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), allowing its users access to intelligence platforms maintained by other federal and private law enforcement entities. The system reached its ""final operation capacity"" under the Trump administration in September 2017.[71]Palantir took over the Pentagon's Project Maven contract in 2019 after Google decided not to continue developing AI unmanned drones used for bombings and intelligence.[72]International Atomic Energy Agency EditPalantir was used by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to verify if Iran is in compliance with the 2015 agreement.[40]"
She is making way up. Undervalued stock here It will go back to previous high
$50 end of year.
cathy wood wasn't wrong. if you're short term focused then palantir isn't for you. this is going to be short term bearish.
Can we get a round of ￼ applauds for Palantir.
Almost to my 1k shares
"Insiders are buying, and retail investors are selling now. Employees - insiders - have started to buy PLTR again on the assumption the company will outperform."
Bullish news = price plummets
Looking pretty bullish. Consolidated @ $25 all day with 300 million shares being traded. That's a pretty good sign when 80% of shares became available to be traded in the markets. You could fish for the bottom again on Friday but that's just trying to gamble the bottom. Whoever bought @ $25 did a good job today. Good luck to all tomorrow.
By the end of next week $PLTR will be about $45 I think
Any guesses for closing price? Mine is $25.01
AMAZON BABY
Then they said Futures and Frankfurt is green so we're set for a green day $NIO $PLTR $GEVO $BNGO $JAGX
Bought 950 shares today.
is this a good start or what?!!!!!
"Until the wolves of wall street are finished squeezing every last share out of inpatient investors you can expect to see this same trend. They know that todays ""investor"" i say that lightly given everyone wants immediate returns anymore are losing hope and getting antsy. They also know that there's no company in a better position to absolutely take off on fundamentals AND growth prospects. It's usually one or the other that someone might get in an investment but with Palantir it's very evidently soon to be both. Until they're satisfied there's no use in discussing this stock price"
"OK... I can't buy any more dip.. I'm so tapped out like the guy who threw all his money at the strip joint and can't afford to pay for a lapdance.... Then he comes home to his wife and coudnf afford to pay electric bills... So he had to sell his house and now living in a 1996 Honda civic hatchback... And a gas tank so low, he can only move the car from this block to the next block.... And the block has a liquor store, so he spend his last dollar on cigarettes and will smoke until his last death.. And then his wife cash out his life insurance policy and become 500k richer.. Finally, she will used the money to maybe buy some more palantir on the last dip just before it rises.. She go to her husband graveyard and told her husband he could have been alive to see palantir at 1000 a share."
the only stock I have that is actually green 
"If you don’t buy more after hearing Karp’s comments, you have no idea what you are doing."

"added 3k at 25.04, thumps up if I made a good decision."
"Why people think contract mean the company will pop??? This is a contract, this is not AWS or MMM will give palantir tons of money immidately.... is a long term good news not short term."
For a Friday beautiful!
"How much do investors really want to keep punishing this stock? Corporate insiders sell shares all the time. Over at Facebook, COO Sheryl Sandberg sells shares pretty much every month like clockwork. It's not as though the insiders at PLTR have sold off all of their shares: they sold a portion and kept a portion. And I'm sure they have share options as part of their compensation package and will be obtaining and selling more shares in the weeks, months, and years to come. But again: How much do we really want to keep punishing this stock? Do investors really believe that this is a $10 or $20 stock? If so, it never should have gone to $45, as it did in January, and it never should have run for 16 straight trading days from late January to mid February with closing prices above $30. Yesterday, for two minutes, investors thought PLTR was a $30 stock. Today, for 15 minutes, investors thought it was a $20 stock. Obviously, it can't be both, and it's unlikely to be either. PLTR is going to become a $50 stock, then an $80 stock, and then a $100 stock. Then, over time, it will become a $200 stock, a $300 stock, and so on. Basically, all it will take to become a solidly $50 stock is news of one or two new major clients, such as an Apple or a Facebook or a foreign government, and a Q1 earnings report that reflects net-positive earnings per share. All the signs are there that from now to the next earnings report, such developments are likely to materialize. By May, if not before, we should see PLTR trading solidly in the $40s and heading into the $50s."
Keep for a week. This will be well above 30sGl
Every time you sell someone is buying
Board up the windows from inside if you bought a lot of shares from PLTR.
THANK YOU ALL WHO SOLD 4K SHARES TO ME AT $28.
Karp was daring you not to buy. He will see where the price is at in a year or so. That's confindece. Lawyers will not let him say anymore.
Stock markets move higher on stimulus and PLTR rises on more news
"Broke 30, Let the WAR BEGIN"
Do you know why Palantir is not going up. Too many people goofin off with contracts instead of picking up shares. Too many of you guys are rollin options. You have to buy shares to bring this up. Period.
Palantir to the moon today!! hit like if you agree
Wonder why insiders are selling the stock in volumes? Any thoughts?
"I'll admit - I'm long as anyone but these last few weeks have truly killed momentum here. I never envisioned multiple visits back to $24-25. I truly believe we'll all look back one day and realize this was just a moment in time. I added 2k shares at $26.25 and thought I was getting a steal. That steal won't be recognized for some time it seems. The earnings report was strong but this stock based compensation negative and the subsequent sales that are being promoted by Yahoo like a feature film while contracts with 3M and others are hardly a blip is putting pressure on the stock. Lastly - I'm of the belief that this is where the stock market saying of money moving from the inpatient to the patient is reality. While our options traders and short term swing traders get burnt and move on, the institutions use that as an opportunity to grab shares without having to move the needle. We may have weeks more of this BS but I do believe that over the next 2-3 earnings calls we'll finally reverse this back to the upside and for the long haul. Gluck everyone!"
Cathie woods only looking at her brings joy  hehhehe . Love PLTR and love cathie . To cathie with love

every tech is green? except pltr? lol
CNBC is doing the job for the boys upstairs .Scaring everyone to sell so they can buy
Who was waiting for $15? Shorts never learn 
AWS = AWSOME!!
Could be huge
once wall street bets is no longer on this. THAT is the time to buy. they're still in denial. have to crush that for this to climb.
SHORT SQUUUUUUUEEEEEEEZEE
From $45 to $23 in one month! Where the longs?
Bagholding 100 shares at $25.69. Any chances of it going upto $40-$50 at all this year?
"Still holding my 2K shares. 1K at $25 and 1K at $22.84. I added 500 more shares at $21. I just can't pass it... PLTR is the future of change, if the trend turn around $50 is coming in a near future!"
In 5 years this will be $250
How about a Costco contract? Need help with the inventories. My favorite bag of snacks is often unavailable ...
Just bought 150 shares
I’m buying way too much of this stock
"All aboard, the  train is leaving the station. Lots of empty seats today."

"In the meantime, analysts at Jefferies Financial Group are also bullish on the stock after earnings, raising their Palantir share price forecast to $40 per share from $30, with an upside scenario price target at $55 per share and a downside target of $20 per share."
pltr is just testing patience right now. hold strong 
notice how they are increasing corporate relationships and didn't list the names of 100 companies they're dealing with. Translation: shorts getting REKKED and they set a consecutive growth number despite 40+% revenue in 1 QUARTER for a reason. The drip of news and PR onslaught coming is going to destroy shorts now. not even considering the one-time IPO costs and compound effect of already signing industry leaders in completely different business domains SELLING ITSELF. Palantir is in a class of its own and the industry leader. Good luck  s
"Oracle earnings very good, this will continue upward momentum for PLTR..."
$RKT and $PLTR in sync today. Like these two companies
What’s everyone’s average cost per share? Holding for 10+ years
"PLTR has strong revenue growth, have strong management team, have strong support from Cathy Wood, and now have strong volume! Share holder goanna sooooo rich holding this stock long term! I predict this stock will be a blue chip stock some day!"
"Dear PLTR stock...Yep... I can see that you are still dancing around $27Nope!!! That's not good enough for me... baby...Get your fat a... [[s]] ... s to $30 Pronto!!!

My gas and electric company(pg&e) signed a deal with pltr.
"Pretty disgusted with the performance of this stock. Whatever the NASDAQ is down, this is down 3x times as much.￼ But I'm in deep, so I'm staying."
Fast Noney talking about Palantir being the company to help with data analytics in cyber security.
This is going to run again. Tech sell off today as money is rotating into value stocks. Temporary rotation unless 10 year spikes but that shouldn’t happen. This stock will run higher. Too many big institutional buyers and sponsors.
ARKK just bought 5.2 million shares!!! YES I was right about this one-) up we go!
Today volume is so high compared to average volume!
To this over 27 we need a really big contract and good 2nd demo day...
"Karp may not be the best spokesman for a FinTV interview, but his confidence in PLTR reflects where these guys are going. Lonsdale has been the same. Up, up and up...."
New partnerships almost every week! My opinion is get in now!
Cathie Wood on CNBC Closing Bell today:https://youtu.be/SaAt-9OIizw
"After lock up period, only 80 % of initial investors are free to sell not 100% as the lock up was only 80 % of their investments. So if you are one of those investors, have seen this stock at 44, would you sell right away at this price? Maybe some, but No prudent investors would do this. The would wait. I think we are way too bearish about lock up exp and gave shorts such chances like the last 3 days to depress the stock by 20 %. That was the punishment! Shorts won’t stay here for too long!"
How low can it go
wiff on 25
I am so tired looking at the market down every single day!! :(
"PLTR is undervalued if you were to compare them to TSLA. Almost 1/15th the market cap. I also have a position in TSLA but they too must grow into their valuation. Also, the press saying it’s a meme stock is full of it (complete agenda). Wall St and Big Funds do this to delegitimize it and blame someone else for big moves in either direction. Talking heads. The TRUTH is that retail does NOT gap stocks up and down. Period. End of story. The sooner one comprehends and realizes that he or she is one step closer to understanding another part of the game. It WILL be the big funds that move it when sentiment changes and guidance numbers justify large rotation back in and selling insurance puts by funds close. Game changing software. Disruptor. Unique."
GME is going to crash the market again. Hedge funds are being forced to liquidate their liquid assets.
Two companies you should invest now: IA and Blockchain!!! That’s the future. PLTR is a leader in IA besides IBM.?
"I dont matter what happen this week, I'm sure PLTR will pay my payoff home in 1 or 2 year, is very easy know that the price of this company will be up in the future"
"GNOG ready for a huge reversal during early march when warrants expire, easy $30 sp"

This is a $35+ stock
"Im in for long here. But this is stressful, ive lost 13k in this stocks. Idk if I will continue to hold or get out wait for the best time to jump"
"“Over the past two days, three executives filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to disclose the sale of about $18.5 million in stock. That brings total salesdisclosed by Palantir’s leaders this week to nearly $112 million.”...Barrons..."
Limited downside risk but potential of high profit in short term.
this thing isndead in the water
PLTR is a long term play. I will continue to buy shares at these incredibly low prices knowing PLTR is poised for greatness. Just give it 5 years and we’ll see $150-$200
GME all over again. I am in.
Of course Cathy loaded up so do I

"Hey Alex,please re stock the baseball caps,I wanted to order one but they are sold out."
ARK has 150 price target !!!!!
"Red on Mondy, Red on Tues, Red on Wedensday and so on... Regardless market is green or red. Is it too hard to tell?you can never wake up a person who is pretending sleep....."
"I saw all these comments when PLTR tanked 16-20% after the Citron news, followed by a period of red as the market struggled.And today we sit discussing the mid-30s and potentially reaching $40.What’s the point: stay patient and enjoy the ride .Held through all the volatility and red days during the consolidation period when we couldn’t seem to break the $20s and I won’t be selling a share.Scared money don’t make money. $9.45/share and long"

Buy good stocks and hold them...thats how you get rich!
Whats a fair market cap for this company? 100 billion or $50 ish per share seems to be best case scenario?
I have a first confession:I have 100% of my account loaded with PLTRI have a second confession:I have another 100% of another account loaded with PLTRI have some good news:BOTH accounts are GREENI am a BAD INVESTOR because I am not diversifying my portfolio...BUT... I like to login to both of my accounts and see GREEN everywhere...It's definitely RISKY.... Pray for me!!!

Tired of seeing this in red
Is this a temporary blip on my screen? I am seeing it over 25 in afterhours now. Please let there be some news driving it...
"I think we found support. It’s not going down to 25. Boys that bought in the 30’s, hold tight we are coming to get you."
I am long at $32.50. Long term this company is a no-brainer. Short-term volatility and downward pressure are normal especially with the lock-up period expiring recently. I have a feeling next quarter will blow away all the estimates and we will see a consistent run-up. GLTA!
allergic to green

oh lord im still holding

Another 197 shares added to my TFSA at $25.19. Think long term.
"There is a number a reasons why it is up after hours. Big buyers last couple of days, the agreement with IBM but Snowflakes earrings and forward guidance is what’s moving it after hours."
We are not gonna move up until we see good earnings report
5hrs and 6 mins to end green plenty of room for upside
The stock is tremendously undervalued rt now. will be over $50 by end of June!!! Stay patient
I would already be happy if we hit 28$ during the week.
A correction was inevitable tbh. But the conference call should relieve investors
Power Hour starts now

"Institutions loading up. Deutsch Bank, Vanguard Group, Price Michael and others!!!"

"It seems that we need to CONTINOUSLY COUNSEL our PLTR brethren to HOLD THE LINE..We do know ery well the games played by both the Shorts and Hedge FundsDo not trade PLTR on a daily basis.I understand that you want to make profits.So, how about this: Hold for 30 days until Quarter One Reports.You have to understand that squizing the Shorts = FORCING the Shorts to cover = FORCING them to buy PLTR at $30, $40, $50, etc...You have to understand the game of the Shortz and play hard balls..."

"Here are some tasty nuggets on PLTR that might catch your attention.  Three different companies who aren’t your corner store cafe have posted Palantir as a preferred qualification.

"totally wasn't expecting this, i am glad that I moved my money away to other stuff at 29.5 tho..... Every day there is a news about insider selling millions. If the company is worth double in a year then why sell now?"
"Last day to get in tomorrow before earnings next week. To all the longs, we know why we bought this and where it will take us. Let's go."
What’s up with all the bots in these yahoo comments lol
$37.50 × 3500 shares.
"PLTR will get a more implemented customer base from the S&P 500 and worldwidecompanies. Once this happens PLTR will be an acquisition target. Companies likeIBM, Microsoft, Oracle will be salivating at the potential of a buyout. BUT, PLTRwon't be for sale."
Longs be like
I’m just here trying to spot all the “experts” that were giving us bearish predictions this past week .Guys can you speak up?? We need to hear your expertise so we can do the opposite of what you say and make gains.Where my LONGS at (:

Waiting for the reversal and then loading up. This company is experiencing explosive growth. Cash on hand is $2.0Bn and LT debt is a mere $200MM. 4Q loss is driven by stock based compensation (a non-cash item). IMO this will pass and it’ll be up and to the left going forward.
sold for a 5% profit
"SFTW, soon to be BlackSky. Another Peter Thiel backed company. Your welcome."
should I sell at $200?
I just really need to see a couple of green days please.
Do you guys know at what time is the interview with Karp?
Monday opening price 32$
The share price is going down. I guess something good would be a statement from the management or CEO and calming the market?Why is this not there?Are they too busy selling their shares?
Palantir will be trading around 168 end of year... No need to trade. Just let the stock work for you.. Long term play..
The overall trend of PLTR is upwards. The trend is your friend. Thank me later
200 more shares at $29.85Just moved my average to $20 per share. In since $10.
"I don't know about you all, but it's kind of hard not to want to give all your money to a company whose Chairman wrote a #1 New York Times bestselling book about business and gives interviews and speeches telling everyone that competition is for losers and monopoly is the condition of every successful business."

Not even Google AI or AppLe AI can beat Palantir. This is like SkyNet level.I will buy more. PALANTIR
Slow and steady is much better. Great day!!! Will continue green into earnings
"It turned out shorting PLTR is very right decision, 15 is first target. This is just a friendly reminder to dreaming bulls as I was before."
"Market will try to shake weaker hand again, I am assuming it is going to stabilize by the end of the week, the stock broke a very important support at 23-22.5 on Friday. it should continue the down trend for few more sessions or at least retest the 20 level before bouncing back. I think it is good idea buying more shares if it goes down and averaging down. The a very strong long term investment stock, but it may be painful for short term trades."
Load the boat time!!
"Bought 1,500 shares @ 28.05, will be holding for the next 1-2 years. GLTA."
"This is the calm before the storm. Get in now, it's oversold, by/after earnings this will be $40-$45."
Appreciate PLTRs transparency with a Q and A from shareholders. Very bullish.
This thing is gonna rebound to $40 soon.
The fact that we’re in green today shows that PLTR is very strong.
Hopefully this is a consistent climb into the close.
"https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/george-soros-top-5-stock-picks-2-921203/4/Shares of Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR), which was founded by legendary investor and PayPal’s cofounder Peter Thiel, swelled significantly since its debut on New York Stock Exchange.

PLTR earning report on Tuesday before market opens.
Green in the end
"Feeling of shorting PLTR is so sweet! thanks for bagholders, you are not investor, just a wishful dream bull."
Although we aren't close to the record highs late Jan/early Feb. the performance of this stock over the past several weeks should shut up the naysayers about the future potential of this stock and its future exponential growth. The share has been diluted by insiders sales and it still is holding strong. Time for all the haters to go elsewhere or tend to their own portfolios lol
"What... am I reading things very wrong or is institutional ownership now at 22,49%, up from 12% a month ago? Source fintel"

"Biggest problem for PLTRThis company has a lack of communication, it remains in opacity and doesn't understand how to be transparent.I wrote to the investors relation dpt but no answer : i'ld like to know what does mean stock-based compensation. Is it a one time charge or a recurrent charge. This is important. Without that, pltr generates earnings.Very strange that we have no idea of earnings guidance and no analyst is able to give some prediction.Communication is very bad and it's not Karp who is able to improve it.Think to Steve Jobs, Bill Gates...."

PLTR Announces a Six Year Deal with French Company!
"What we will find out Tuesday and what we’ve been saying for a long time, most private sector companies, DO NOT, want their name public after signing with Palantir, for obvious competitive reasons. We know from their website that they are now in many many new industries. Also, through great detective work from members on this board, high level companies are hiring people with Palantir experience. The numbers will come out during the ER, that they can’t hide. With software companies, they recognize a portion of the revenue during the quarter the contract is signed and the rest as incurred. That’s the beauty of long term contracts, they recognize maintenance and support revenue every quarter for the duration of the contract. They essentially become utility companies just like Comcast or National Grid. It’s the gift that keeps on giving."
Can anyone tell why the value is falling when the company has shown good reporting and confidently predicted further growth?
Isn’t it at 45 not long ago ?
Strong rebound. Glad I bought into the dip while this was in the $21s. Officially in the green overall on PLTR
Ending $25+ today!
Slow bleed now to $20
Thanks for your shares. Going golfing now. Have a great day longs.
Sell now before this is going under 15$. There's no way this will recover in the next two years. The ship is going down. Save what you can before going broke.

"Just like previous days, opened green premarket and goes down red. Goes down red premarket opens green. Let’s see if the pattern follows"
looks like all of the insiders have sell orders pegged at $25. when they all clear. maybe stock can release and head towars $45!
"GS upgrades PLTR, ARK buys 1.6million shares, and weak hands still get this stock down by 13%."
"Don't be weeded out. Heroes grow into gardens. Gardens grow into legends. Palantir creates a safer, more beneficial world for humans and economies. Period.Salud and God Bless.Home Run and yes, Adios Pelota----------------"
"80 million shares traded a day is enough information to tell you that good news will send this stock much higher. There's a lot of people watching this stock. Keep adding shares, the news will come."
all interest is gone now what a change from last week
"Back in 2006, I was in the back seat of Warren Buffet’s car. He mentioned PLTR during the ride. I’m long. WSB is noise."
"First timer to PLTR. In with 1,000 shares. Let’s go baby!!"
Trades are smoothing out around $25-$26. As fluctuations calm down there will be a slow steady rise in $/sh.
20 soon
any bagholders from $40?
Added 400 shares on weakness yesterday. Easy hold for 5+ years. Looking for a 10-bagger.
"Peter Thiel the founder of Palantir is using company software in recent spac companies in Malaysia for tokopedia, gojek, and traveloka when I heard this I immediately put in buy orders on the Bridgetown holdings 1 and 2. This guy has the magic touch"

Who did'nt buy enough PLTR? ....me.... i did'nt buy enough. :/

"1hr before closing,, load up your tendies.... heading to the moon!!"

"The stock has doubled since October 2020. In 4 months double the money.Even with the current dip, the overall trend of Palantir is UPWARDS. In stocks the trend is your friend."
Did you hear the AWESOME NEWS?
"Looks very strong to me. It has been trading in a consolidation zone recently and bounced strongly off the $21 support level today. If it does break down here, it could go much lower, all the way to 15. But there is a good chance it will hold and back up to 26 to 28 at least."
im out of money but so you know nonrate hikes theough2023 tech rally on.
I love karp's style and company solid business model and potential and i will hold this one for sure
This thing is being heavily shorted otherwise it would be back at 26$ by now

Pamazon?
Holding 6000 shares at 23.7$Going to boy 3000 every 5% drop. Unlikely it’ll go below 22$ But who knows. Probably the best stock on the market right now. This is like getting apple at 40B market cap.
Don't be victims of short term down trend and don't loose opportunity of long-term investment
10% pullback for s&p is healthy correction and opportunity to buy more.
We like the stock. No DD necessary

"I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again; thank you Alex Karp and Peter Thiel for doing a DPO instead of an IPO. And he said it today, to let the average investor in at a great price. Not a popular move with Wall Street but they can’t run from his commitment of a 30% annual growth rate for the next 5 years. They’re succeeding in getting cheap shares for their clients and us. Go longs. Be patient."
Who here has done math to determine PPS needed to be a millionaire? I have!!! 
$100 by the end of 2021... GLTA
"Buy the dip today, it's due to JPOW and FOMC meeting. Not because of interview hahaha"
"Is there a COMPELLING REASON why people are selling below $26?The Fake Business News keep saying the same silly nonsense: Rates up = Stocks downPLTR doesn't care about rate up, housing down, etc... A business will use Palantir software to gather business INTELLIGENCE in order to INCREASE PROFIT MARGINSFair enough?"
"Ignore the PLTR executives that sold stock, they maybe related to Ted Cruz. They bail out at the wrong time."
WOW under 25??? I bought back in!
BUY BUY BUY
Get ready longs.
Joe Biden's administration will crash the stock market unless they continue the SLR extension. Hundreds of billions of dollars of forced selling hang in the balance.
go pltr go pltr its tour birthday
Can you insiders either wrap up your selling or wait for higher prices so this thing can actually rally more than 5%! Knocking down every rally does no one any good!
nothing but buys at 25? what a wall
I'm in at 35$ and I'm not selling for at least 5years
"Get on the PLTR rocket before its too late, Remember couple weeks ago this was holding great at $33-$35 Nothing has changed beside insider selling their hard earned shares that they held for 17 years."

"""Year-over-year revenue growth of greater than 30%.For Q1 2021, we expect:Year-over-year revenue growth of 45%.""SO THAT MEANS they expect revenue growth for Q2,3,4 to be around 25%.Could this be a reason why it is dropping?"

Shorts u need to cover now!! This ur chance
what a tease..tomorrow it'll be up another 3 or 4 percent just doesn't want to give it all away on the first daye
another opportunity or is it
"I do think the huge dilution since the lock up expired is our worst enemy. That's the only way to explain why this is at 23 and not 43. The business is amazing and during one all cylinders. It's the 2,500 employees who are shooting themselves in the foot by selling their shares at a discount. Once this levels off it will be up up up. But when will that be?"
"Cathie wood scooped up more than 1.5 million shares today....that is more than 35million dollars of worth, what you gotta worry about ?!!!. Lets go"
45M traded...why is the algo holding it hard at $25..is there price fixing going on???
I bought more today. Thousand shares strong. I will only sell if it goes to 100 otherwise I will hold it forever.
I LOVE PAMAZON
We’re dumping more PLTR tmr!LOL
Back to the 30s this week?
"Just saw a PLTR LinkedIn post about their collaboration with Doosan Infracore, a Korean heavy equipment manufacturer. What is up with that?"
Noticed that the Libs on Bloomberg hate Cathie Wood. My theory is that she looks and sounds a lot line Sarah Palin which makes them hate her even more. (P.S. Libs don’t truly like strong women.)
this stock looks good
"Trend is your friend, do not fight with it."
PLTR at 22x is a Steal. Don't wanna miss the Ride before it gets back to 30x . Bullish on PLTR. Should cross 50+ in 1 yr.. Way to go PLTR.
Hello Guys. Just checking in to breath some green air. Our PLTR happy island today. Be strong!
"Buy and hold! If this company becomes profitable next Q! Guys... We will see this reaching 60s... If not,... Well I guess we will see 16 dollars a share."
Soros’s early investment in Palantir was converted into publicly traded shares when the company listed on the New York Stock Exchange in September.
Pre market up 5%. Hopefully this can go above $30 by next week.
Added more !It’s on sale Let’s GO
"I am a day 1 investor and it truly amazes me that no matter how great the news is this continues down?? I mean come on IBM, AWS, Ferrari, contract after contract and I am not saying to the moon but 40-50 seems more in line with the contacts they are signing long term... still holding :)"
Ok serious question tho. To the moon but where is the moon. Should I sell at 100 200 or 300. If Monday reaches 90 should I take profit?
Calling all bulls
"Another demo day... Imagine.. Instead of reaching 45 dollars, we reach 60s!"
I would not be surprised to see PLTR close @ $35 tomorrow.
still too expensive. be patient. it will keep drifting sideways and trading VERY slowly down. even the bulls here know that. they just hope over exuberance will drive this stock upwards. nope. we're going to pull the rug on you guys. not the other way around.
SNOW dropping after hours.
TESLA and ATI contracts could be coming very soon
"Instead of selling average down. If you sell on a loss within 30 days, you get ding during tax season. Also, PLTR is one of a kind AI / SAAS company and with economic uncertainty comes opportunity."
"Has anyone ever thought instead of employees are selling, they bought the dip at $25"
"Hey bashers, it was nice having you all here for the laughs, but we’re gonna have to cut this short. Palantir is going back up now, bye!"
April 16th demo day part 2 
IMO... A good day to buy any weakness. I will buy more in the 22's today
"For those interested, take a look at the 6 month chart. We’ve only pulled back to the stocks upward trend line."
Is this next redditer's choice after GME and RKT?
This is a CONSOLIDATION befor moon. So wait and chill.
"Short PLTR so we can get back in at a lower price, and if you were long don't worry. It will take a while so hold, and all will win, so for now, SHORT THIS STOCK...!!!"
"ARKK- PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES INC-A PLTR- 7,683,103 shares"

"No worries, long term this will be a big winner. Probably as low as we're gonna see this."
Beautiful
"Wow, can we break 30 today?"
Nothing but turbulence !
ark state it clear they r in long terms. Institutions won’t sell. We’re heading to the moon together.
Let's admit: we have received VERY POOR advice to 'buy the dips' for the past month.
"Yeah guys keep selling , it will be in the green"
FOMO starting to set in on Palantir...
What happens? Any news?
soon 50
I think we can all agree that this stock will never go below $25. Only up from here!
"i get out , bye and good luck in 5 years."
"At this rate, PLTR will be worth Zero by month-end."
"This stock is a monster, I'm so bullish I can't even see any downside with this company. I have no idea how it's only $27. I picked up some discount shares at $24 today and I'm riding this LOOOONG term."
I think the ER was pretty good. The 30% rev growth moving forward was taken out of context imo: https://youtu.be/mbwwd8DTERA
God is with those that are patient.
Where are you longs? Looks like everyone is bearish now.
Pre market is up? Hope it stays sub 25 until I got money to buy more....
To $ 25
Setting up the other leg down
Look at the whole market going down after overreaction and PLTR barely down. This is the bottom for sure.
i wanna buy more but i dont get my tax refunds for two more days. i will be buying either way at whatever price
"Don't look at it now, look at it in 3 years! Easier said than done, but this is a long-term investment. Today was a rough day for the market as a whole."
A weird stock ... that does not stop falling ... everyone glorifies this stock and says that it is the best investment stock ! ... but what we are seeing is nothing but continuously selling !
did motley just say palantir is one of the 3 meme stocks?
"All in the board, DATA SILOS. palantir to the rescue."
Go to the moon. USD 100 dollars incoming.
Shield wall at 24 lol. Let's call Ragnar and his sons to break it.
"Because he does not bow down to the infantile mob of wokkies, that is why i bought in."
Still buying at 26.00 Wait till after 2:00 today to see 24.00+
Samting going on in plrt fly 7% in after 
"300 million shares traded hands on lock up expiration today, 5x more than average. Stock only dropped 7%. So if that bear thesis is now dead, we can resume our forward trajectory."
Green baby lockup over green skies ahead
Wooow are you seeing the chart! Inverting! It means we are leaving the down trending behind!
"Ppl be thinking 20 and 30s are price targets, my lowest estimate for pltr within the next 2 months is 45$. Almost 50% of my portfolio."
"It’s so funny to me when kids are scammed in this chat. Dude, sometimes you win sometimes you learn. How tf u wanna learn if you never fail? Just because someone from YouTube told you that the stock crash is coming, doesn’t mean that it’s actually coming. The crash it’s coming when all scared kids stat to sell massive. Chill."
strange how there was so much volume and the price stayed at 25 almost all day....

"Let's go longs! New contracts incoming, company is solid, one of the future leaders . As Alex said, they are developing products that the world will realise in 5 years that they absolutely need."
Pltr engines starting. It's like a slow horse takes a while to gain speed and needs something to catch up to to rocket past ie gme amc bb bbby

I'm all in
good luck fellas
Managers working overtime to keep this smothered and shorted under $25. They know they're sitting on a powder keg.
Calls were priced as I said earlier. Close after market at 25.51. That‘s not an accident. Calls coming....big.
Am happy with my 2079 shares. Looking to hold for several years.
Lame holiday - i still have to work and the market not open to help me look busy. Go PLTR
When will it be a 100 dollar stock?
SHORT SQUEZEEEEE SOON.
Notice nobody posted a link regarding “Amazon” news.
i love this stock so much. just got paid and added 11 shares. now i ahve 528 total shares! i need to hit the 1k club!
I have no idea if this is a good stock and what the company do. But I don't really care.I bought 400 shares of it because stock moe hyped it in his youtube video
bought more CALLS.
"ARKK bought another 460,000 shares on an ugly day and sold Appl, Facebook, PayPal and Google... Let that resonate some.."
"Today signals what many of already knew. This company is a paper tiger. There is no confidence it it either from investors, and especially insiders. When Thiel, Cohen, and Sankar sold millions of shares in the 20s, I jpknew this was headed down fast. These guys are capitalists first and foremost. If they thought the 40s, or even the 30s was quickly within reach they would have held of an up to 50 percent increase in gain. Instead, they dumped bigly. Talk about sending a signal to shorts. They may as well have put up a billboard in Times Square saying “Hi, I’m Palantir. SHORT ME!” As I’ve said before, this company has been commented on as the next Google. I see it at the next ENRON."
We have support above $24 now
PLTR is BIG ... new contract after new contract ...etc
Buy-dont mind short time fluctuations- keep look back in 5 years = rich
"Hamilton themed PLTR, just to annoy the shorts...https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxgpa3/i_spent_four_hours_writing_hamiltonthemed_pltr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb"
"PLTR is the Microsoft of data management for now and the future...btw MSFT = 1.79 Trillions Mkt Cap, but PLTR = 48.7 Billions and their next goal of Mkt cap will be 100B, 200B, 300B+..... during the next 3-5 years with a many more big partnerships....coming soon."
"Hey yahoo, why do you keep deleting comments?"
"Yep, this is more like it!"
30 close possible with funds buying
Snowflake is at $300+ and these guys are only at $33? PLTR has more employees and has been inking some big contracts. Hopefully more commercial presence. Also teaming with IBM? Maybe these things provide a boost.
I really don't understand how the SEC don't see a mayor fraud with Shorts and Options manipulation with a tone of options due tomorrow at $25 to $20 strike price.
I'm a longterm investor and I'm glad Palantir is down and might be down for some time. Good opportunity to get rid of all the spineless jellyfish who can hold a stock no longer than a fart.
"I have no idea what the overall market is going to do, but I love that this stock wants to outperform. Very encouraging."
"Institutional investment is up 100% from 10% in December to 21% now. if you don't understand what this company does and why this stock is a goldmine, go and trade something else. you do not belong here."
"Wow, who dumped these 120,000 shares afterhours?!"
Just out Blackbro just added 3 million shares...
"Regarding the lockup period expiration, if it were in the high 30s to 40s I would say we would see a sell off but since it’s been demolished like it is now why would one sell when it’s low and potential so high??But of course nothing makes sense with this stocks movement :))"
5 other institutions besides Ark invest loaded up today billions of dollars worth of shares. Again this is like getting in Microsoft when it was 20$ It’s crazy cheap now. For sure will pass 100$ this year!
$31 opening tmr?
You still have a chance premarket
What negative again? This doesn't make any sense to me! We just had another partnership and this keeps going down?!
Prediction:1. PLTR will go up to $25 by 10am Eastern Time (ET)2. Then it will go down to $24 and $23 by close of business3. Commentators will say the usual: Cathie wood is buying. Vanguard is buying. Shorts are affecting the price. etc...4. While others will say To The Moon!!!Fair enough?
It will be great to wake up Tuesday morning and see my money in PLTR double and shorties scurry to cover their lost.
Stuck at 37 Fml
"ARK , Mrs Wood bought more today , $60 million worth , google it"
"The company, co-founded in 2003 by billionaire Peter Thiel, signed 21 contracts each worth $5 million or more during the fourth quarter and said it expects sales in the first quarter to grow by about 45% from a year ago."
Strategy:1) Let girly weak hands continue to sell at a loss.2) Wait until the carnage stops.3) Swoop down and scoop up all the cheap shares.4) Stay long and get rich.
Sell Apple And buy more pltr
Black Friday?
have no idea. why people are bullish on this but okay.
ARK also bought 2 out of the 3 stocks I bought today! I’m patting myself on my backLet’s go!!
CEO SPEAKING RIGHT NOW CNBC
Just imagine what's gonna happen when Palantir announces a big contract with a Microsoft or a Tesla. To the moon !
Ark buying up shares large blocks
"got in at 29, been down ever since...."
"Wow, 170M shares exchanged today. Why did it tank on a green day? Can Cathie continue to double down or must investors stop her? My friend bought some Ark ETF and is losing a lot of money."
The only regret I have is I didnt buy more 
"GME gets halted, NASDAQ recovers! haha"
Premarket spooks.....
"Just purchased $28,500 worth of shares. It's flattening out at a good support I like this one. Happy to lose."
"Lol, short shorts are so desperate here. Watch they run for cover once the lights are on. Stay calm and be confident. BUY and HOLD."
Wow 3 plus mil shares. That’s a lot of shares!! Some shorts in here have 20 shares and trying to bash the company. GTLA
"Cathie Wood’s funds take big hits as Tesla and the tech trade show signs of unwinding. Shares of Palantir, Tesla, Roku, Square, Paypal, Teladoc, Baidu, Zillow, Shopify and Spotify were all down big, in many cases by double-digits. All were major holdings in funds like her flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) and Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW).Shortly after the open, her flagship Ark Innovation Fund was down 11%. By 10 a.m. ET, a half-hour after opening, it had already traded more than 8 million shares, a full day’s volume. By midday, it had traded 30 million shares.And then, a half hour after opening, the selling let up. The fund was last down about 6% and 11% for the week."
In 10 years I’ll be one of the early few who has shares under 25. Very excited to watch this grow slowly. Excellent company with a bright future
If this dips to 22 I am adding another 8000 shares..PLTR and NIO
Been wrong all day but now it's my turn to be right. This will pop big time after hours and into tomorrow.
"Weak hands are all out, right? Now it's the show time, it will get back to $40 in 3 weeks. Why? Because money talks. ARK and other institutions invest heavy money in PLTR, they will turn it on. Plus it's a great company, whatever you weak hands think, the earnings report increase my confidence. It's actually a great report, it's just too many short term gamblers in this pot, now they are out I am happy."
why did cathie sell aapl to buh this? isnt aapl part of a bigger thing...and why this? can someone help me pleease i have lost so much money that i actually needed for other things but got caught up in this ...it was like a video game...i just kept putting credits in to play and before i knew it i was down like 18 dollars and then you know its history
"I bought at $9.34 for 10k shares and I added another 1k shares at $24.01 today. I've been through ups and downs from $9 - $45. I won't sell any single share for the next 2-3 years. I will add more, if it's down lower than $24 again."
JUST ADDED 400 SHARES
40 by Friday !
"How does a company continually make no profits and proceed to stay in business? It seems counterintuitive at best. However, companies can become successful even without turning profits for extended periods of time – and can even simultaneously continue to attract investors.There are three basic ways big companies survive without profits.Purposeful Reinvestment – Earnings are significant and large, but the company chooses to put most of its revenues back into the business to keep propelling growth. Amazon is the king of purposeful reinvestment, infrequently reporting a profit in its more than twenty years of existence and following an overt strategy focused on continued growth over profits. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has the revenue and base to allow profits, but it argues that without constant investment in its business, the company would be overtaken by competitors in different fields.Hopeful Expansion – Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) is a good example of this category. With recent acquisitions such as Vine, Periscope and MoPub, Twitter is trying to carve out a larger social media presence but is dealing with considerable expenses, including almost 45 percent of revenue paid out in compensation as stock options. As opposed to Amazon, the intent is to reach and sustain profitability.Initial Growth – The company shows incredible growth and promise in its early stages and secures venture capital..."
You cannot remain silent in this situation. I invested all my school money in pltr I lose it all my life will end please support the parlantir. #ElonMusk #reddit #RedditArmy #tesla #pltr #palantir #wallstreetbets #SpaceX #help #pls
Ok time to create are own gang Who wants in
"In the end the shorts are not going to matter. All the analysts aren't going to matter. The statistics and technical data is not going to matter. The only thing that is going to matter, is Palantir is producing products and services that companies and governments simply, can't do without. And right now, and in the foreseeable future nobody else comes close."
Cathie’s target is $150 is this true??
"Going to fair value = 7.25 $ soon. Last chance, let's do it..."
I’ve been doing this for awhile. This isn’t a pajama boy Reddit stock. I hate that it’s come to that because this is a pioneer in an industry that’s going to be needed more than ever soon. Long.
30s
BFT OVER $17 soon
On my way to 1k shares thanks to those who are selling
sounds like vegas in here
I don't worry about Palantir at all. I bought a few thousand shares and plan to hold for many years! We could be looking at a $200 stock in 3-5 years.
Palantir. Possibly the greatest bag holder stock ever created.
"I’m in at 37 down heavy, what’s the timeline im looking at here"
BUY and HOLD !!!!
is it me or does it feel like something or someone high up is trying to keep this stock down ?????
"For some reason I compare this to the facebook IPO, it will go to $100 and $200 in the next years. Just be patient and add more on the dips"
Who is buying this #$%$ tonight?
Hi - My name is John and I’m really bitter towards PLTR. Can you help me find my baseball?
Soros selling for ethical reasons. Have seen it all now.
"I’m sorry, but does the WSB crowd actually know what direction the moon is in?"
Karen from fast money mentioned about $PLTR.Looks like bottom reached.
this stock is in a strait jacket
"PLTR has read color only. 15 is short term target, long term is zero,"
Once it breaks $30 
Shorts give us your money!!!! Feeling so bullish about this one!
Newbie here... I have 400 shares of this stock which I’m not worried about but I also have 3/19 55 calls... are these call options dead?

"For the fourth quarter, Palantir reported an adjusted profit of 6 cents per share, including stock-based compensation. Revenue climbed 40% to $322 million, said the provider of data analytics software to U.S. government agencies.Analysts had projected a 2-cent adjusted profit on revenue of $300.7 million. 40 % not good enough. . Show me another company that has a 40 % revenue."
This seems like clockwork. The yield on the 10 yr Treasury spikes today and suddenly PLTR stock drops at the same time.
"Special companies only come around rarely. If you lack the conviction to buy Palantir at $26+, then you might as well keeping loading up on AT&T for its dividend."

I'm all in since the day one when they went to direct listing. Palantir is one of the most innovation tech company in our life; Gotham & Foundry are pretty much dominated the government's sector and Apollo will be changing the way retail and commercial user in their OS in either #$%$ Back Office. I'm long in his stock because I see their potential...

"I am long and holding. Tomorrow will probably be rough, lock up expires. Be prepared. Brighter days ahead for longs after that."
I'm 30% down 
"one more thing: having worked with Amzn, I can tell you that if Palantir enters into a partnership with them it is because Amzn does not have sufficient capacity to do it himself. This is not pejorative because amzn already has very good engineers, PLTR has the best.We will quickly see the results and many companies around the world will be won over by Palantir's platforms.Apple, Facebook, Google and others?"
A lot of new enthusiasm : )
"Same old Wall Street move :1) Sky is falling market crash, stop losses are taken and panic investors sell.2) Pundits come on Saturday morning cable shows to remind us they knew this was coming,3) Message board at Yahoo gets wild with the short haters and the cry baby's that lost their lunch money and blame, curse PLTR.4) Next week PLTR comes with more great news and we move back up to 30 range.5) I watch ,wait and learn . Release GOTHAM !"
The controlled dip right before close to 24's then uptick to close over 25 is indicator for call pricing.Going to be fun when the Ferrari gets to her straight away...

"if palantir dips today again, no worries because mama Cathie is going to buy more shares. But its not going to dip.......still very undervalued for what they do.......and pre market says it all"
"I have finished watching the interview with Palantir CEO Alex Karp.Here are some points:1. Palantir is working hard with both IBM and AWS (these companies like the modularity of the Palantir software)2. Invest in Palantir long term. He specifically mentioned some good stuff coming in the next 2 years3. Alex Karp has a PhD from Germany4. Palantir software = Modular = Easy to integrate with the software of other companies5. As a CEO of a public company, he's not allowed to predict where PLTR price will be (His lawyers told him NOT to speculate)6. Alex Karp thinks that many people investing in Palantir are engineers who are investing their own money, with no safety net, and believe in Palantir's future7. For some reason, Alex Karp doesn't seem to like Silicon valleyPeace!"
"If Aunt Cathie bought over 3 million shares, then PLTR is going to be just fine"
Funny how people say $ 24 is in support of that shares. If the Nasdaq drops -1% it will fly -10%. It doesn't have any support points.
We were red because the WHOLE market was red.. next week we’re going GREEENNNN!!! Copped a Palantir hoodie cause u know I got to represent  sharing link in case anyone else wants to join Palantir merch squad  https://stock-junkie.myshopify.com/collections/palantir-pltr

This will start heading up as the demo part 2 is coming mid April and more customers are signing up. This is a  guys at these prices. Won't stay in the 20s that much longer.
Filings showed that one of its co-founders Stephen Cohen and two company officers jointly sold over 2.7 million shares overnight.
"Any shares bought under $30 will make you money in the short term (less than a year). Any shares bought under $40 will make you money in the long term. And when you're old and grey, you're gonna slap yourself for not buying as much as you could because now it's over $1k/share and your paper handed Mars house is a quarter the size of our diamond handed Mars houses."

People have been working at this company for 15yrs plus just cashing out some sweat equity is all. Most of us would do the same. I have zero worries about that.
"""We hope those of you on this call who are current investors stay with us. And those of you who prefer a more short-term focus that you choose companies that are more appropriate for you,"" Chief Executive Alex Karp said on a conference call with analysts."
We in a good place now Tec. rebounding hard. this going back to 40
I have the impression Wallstreet is shorting the FAANG's at stupendous levels. They targeted Apple the hardest. They're grabbing two quarters of solid earnings at November levels. Behold the genius of Wallstreet. Robot trading and collusion. They get to peek around the corner and compress the stairwell to ground levels. They created a financial time machine. No risk for the real insiders. Martha Stewart went to prison for a 100K trade though. Nice system.
lets not celebrate now. Our real victory is when it crosses $30. Lets hang in.
"No matter the results, this company has just started. BP contract was biggest-1.2B for ten years in 2014 and was extended. On IBM interview they said IBM is bigest so far. It needs more time to monetize all contracts."

I bought PLTR with my stimulus package money
"3 patents where approved yesterday, AI related technology, The deal with IBM and recently, potential partnership with Amazon Web Services. how much more is being overlooked right now?"
"Just looking at today's chart, if it can hold above 24.65 or so and rise to above 25 again, that will be a definite trend of higher highs and higher lows intraday. While we know anything can happen, and Nasdaq is taking a dump, it does look like it is on a good trajectory today! We'll see."
Massive volume!!!!
It’s only down because of the lockup expired employees can dump shares and lots of em. Can’t blame them they been holding since they started most are holding. Good sign
I just bought 100shares
"I told you this is going to be like Facebook. first 6 months it was going up and down, their data is massive, and eventually , this will go higher . just hold on to it. do nt do day trading on this stock , you lose"
"do you know what it means when a stock sells at 28 x Sales? it means the stock has nowhere to go but down in the medium to long term. i don't know what the stock will do tomorrow but there is NO VALUE HERE PERIOD. watch and learn. stock will get bumped up and then come in hard. the insiders will sell, sell, sell. lmao"
Added on 23 an amazing dip! I will hold my 1k shares forever! Their program can be used in every sector and they are the only one? Enough reasons to go all in!
"The sell off will start at 3:30pmWall Street software engineers and Short sellers have their ""Python Scripts"" timed to wake up at 3:30pm for a final feeding frenzy"
ARK bought 1.5 million shares. I guess they really believe in Palantir!
"The new product, Palantir for IBM Cloud Pak for Data, is planned for general availability in March of 2021."
Good long term stock but be careful if you are short term because you might get burned due to market volatility.
"Dear Shorts,We offer our sincere condolences to all of you!!!!Do you need a hug?RIP!!!"
Palantir’s double-click event to demonstrate they platform across multiple industries. Hopefully they can demonstrate client testimonials.

Picked up what I can with extra cash: 50 shares.
Such a strong stock. It will fly soon.
not good..onoy cathie may buy this now
Going to be a huge pre-market Tuesday!! Could see a 5 point jump. All institutions buying is like a smoke signal seen from miles around!! FOMO
Stick with this one. The bearish call options have to be hedge funds’. Attempts to scare the living hell out of retail investors holding long.

"Back to $45 easy. Simply because it's already been to $45, and the foundation of PLTR is so solid. We found that out hearing the CC. The only question is.....when will the shorts figure this out and cover. It's going to be a long weekend for shorts!"
LOL you guys a funny. Do you think all these million share buy orders are retail traders. Big institutions buy for the long term.
Omg a green day.
I might be bag holder but I'm Bullish.....if you afraid of your life losing money ... this market not for you......

"Palantir and 3M Expand Relationship to Build Dynamic Supply Chain02/23/2021DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) today announced a multi-million dollar expansion of its relationship with 3M. 3M has chosen to expand its use of Palantir's Foundry platform to support its digital transformation, assisting in the build out of a dynamic supply chain that enables the global manufacturer to respond nimbly to changes in demand across tens of thousands of products.“In an increasingly complex world, the success of our business depends on our ability to respond quickly to changing facts on the ground,” said Brig Knott, 3M’s Vice President, End to End Service, Operations & Lean Six Sigma. “In the midst of a global pandemic and significant changes to our demand across products, the Foundry platform enabled us to react quickly and effectively. We’re excited to expand this work across the 3M enterprise.”“3M has been at the forefront of digital transformation, and we’re excited to deepen our relationship with this innovative and global company,” said Alex Karp, co-founder and CEO of Palantir.This expanded relationship builds on the work Palantir already supports across 3M’s efforts in supply chain alerting, demand forecasting and business planning. “Palantir has played an important role for our Enterprise Operations digital migration strategy; we’re eager to keep pushing the boundaries to ensure a continued focus on our customers,” noted Shaun Braun, 3M’s VP of Digital Transformation."

"Everyone should be at caution. Do you truly believe that this administration have any real plans to help the economy and stock market? Do you also really think that a 45% capital gains tax and inheritance tax will help the market? Again trade with caution.I'm not a short, but don't blame PLTR if it goes down in SP. You've got to be aware of the market sentiment."
They raised interest rates on bonds so they could pull big money out of stocks to buy bonds. “Legal” market manipulation. Just hold or dollar cost average unless you really need to sell.
"HAS ANYONE HEARD FROM @RAMSUN OR WHATEVER HIS NAME IS?I hope he's doing ok, Its only money after all"
Totally worth the wait... I barely look at this stock anymore and I focus on some others for short terms gains. This one will pave its way and be completely worth the wait.
what's with top 3 execs selling off
I'm on the 5 year plan.No worries!!
PLTR will grow by 80% YOY for a couple of years.
After earnings should hit 50

So glad to be here at the beginning. I see Palantir as the next Tesla of the data. Information worth more than almost everything. I see it above $1000 in the next 5 years.
Everyone thinks they are smarter then the next guy.
Extremely oversold!
"News: Director Stephen Andrew Cohen sold 140,455 shares of PLTR for a total cost of $3,662,038 source fintel.io"
Best stock in the market! Never seen a huge volume like that! Won’t stay below 50$ for long!
"Buy the dip, when Nas recovers this afternoon you will kick yourself"
War to the upside
I may not be rich but I’m happy with 140 shares and planning to buy more 
You can not imagin how palantir has deep root in the most secret place in the US defence fields And etc...We can say all valueable data that US gov needs are in the palantir handsPlalantir is not joking or playing or just business When it comes to national security or defence or inteligence service Palantir is the most important part of puzzel
GREEEEEEN
I like the clowns they make me laugh.
"If you think this is a bubble stock or it’s crashing too much your wrong, pretty much every market is down significantly and Nasdaq especially. Don’t be surprised if it bounces back pretty quickly. Don’t sell for loss. Now is the perfect time to load. Just brought another 2000 shares at 24"

"Perfect, while I was hoping it would be a little higher, that was the top I was looking for. There is enough intraday data now to confidently say there is an upward trend and momentum on the stock today. Barring something stupid happening in the world, we should see a reversal of this slide down trend we’ve had over the past three or four days.JMHO"
Hit 30 so I can sell this.
Poor people who sold on fear yesterday never let your emotion interfere with business remember the fundamentals of the company you invested in.PLTR is a Diamond in the rough ￼

Shoutout to the bashers who told me I’d be a bag holder buying below $10 after DPO day .Hope you spent that money you saved wisely
PLTR will print in the power hour
i just get in 26
craxy trading again. oh
$45 looks like ancient history. We seem quite range bound in the mid $20's and can't see us going up from here until earnings improve dramatically.
"Temporary slowdown into lunch, have a great green day longs!"
$30 by Friday...
"i just grabbed shares at the low of the day with pltr being well off its 52 wk high in the mid 40's ~~ software for counter-terrorism in the world we live today seems like a no brainer on this one...... go pltr,,"
I bought at $32 thinking it can't get below $25. Really annoying and it is surprising how little love the stock gets from the media. I don't plan to sell until summer at least but I can't say I didn't expect it to move down this fast.
"To all the people out there fixated on why insider's sold their shares.......I believe in PLTR's bright future as do the insiders. They did not dump every share they own, no just a small portion. Now if I had to the chance to take a little money of the table, I would do the same thing. It's just good horse sense. A) Maybe they want to splurge a little bit and B) Most importantly DIVERSIFICATION!!!!!!! Other than the YOLO crowd, would you leave all your eggs in one basket! This is where the good horse sense comes in, take a little of the table and diversify. Makes perfect sense to me."
"Public Announcement folks, Please realize that you shorts have been fighting to get the price down vs Longs betting the price will go up but for the last two weeks the price still +-25. a share and the only ones making money are the hedge funds that manipulate your thoughts by selling you false dreams and misleading information on both sides and we make fun of you when the price goes up and you shorts do the same when it goes down and we are pinned against each other and the winners are The HEDGE FUNDS.Palantir will go up to $50 by the end of March and yes it will be over valued and will correct itself then you and I can really make some money."
Will pltr be the next Apple? Yes.
Mood today
"I'm ready for the thumbs down. What a bunch of WHINERS the majority of new posters on this board have been. The fact that this is holding up at this price despite what's happening in the market at the exact same time of the lockup expiration is not only a miracle but a show of strength. You have funds ADDING regularly while the many of you complain of stagnation. For starters, this is up 150% since DPO only 5 months ago. The earnings report was a thing of BEAUTY outside of the stock based compensation (which means very little in it's infancy as a public company). The insider sales have happened at EVERY SINGLE company regardless of vertical. Facebook, Google, Appl, AMZN take your pick people. The village nit wits that want you to believe this is some malpractice by PLTR leadership are a joke and only attempting to scare you.This is primed and pumped to be a CASH COW...The upside to this pandemic has been many more people are at home and investing out of boredom. No boss or anyone else to look over your shoulder while you frequent message boards or your holdings account. That downside is every Tom, Dianna and Harry wants to be a day trader, looking for immediate returns. Invest in this long term and be graced with profits that you've only previously dreamt about. How many times has someone said ""wish I bought TSLA"", ""wish i bought Appl"" ""wish I bought Msft"" etc etc. This is your opportunity to buy a future MEGA cap company. Enjoy the price stagnation by loading up. I was able to increase my position by 4x since my initial entry at $10...I continue to buy because I've done my RESEARCH...It's a beautiful thing to educate yourself and have a vision for the direction of our planet..If you can do both you sleep like a baby owning this stock...If rely on others, you're subject to manipulation from the best of them.#notallthatisgoldglitters - Yes thats PLTR password for the demo, same PLTR that issued 30%+ growth guidance through 2025 but certainly feel free to disregard and listen to a message board bear on why this is worth $10."
"Tuesday morning... AMAZING news and BLOWOUT earnings, pre market price $45!"
Why is this meme stock down
Whole market was down and this is up. Amazing
"Don't call it a comeback, I been here for years - LL Cool J"
Just added more... IBM doesn’t partner with pump and dump companies and neither does the United States government.
OTW to $30's.....
"It s amazing to see masive drop after amazing earning report today,, i think some people dont know math and calculation..Hope it drop a bit more than i can get more shares ,, easily $50 after a few weeks time with that financial reports inc lockup period,, and many hedge founds get your shares very cheap prices...i am quite happy for my investing so far with palantir..."
"Why is Yahoo removing some of our postings? Over 50% of my postings get censored because they don't apparently coincide with Yahoo's leftwing agenda. Anyone who said they don't understand how Adolph was able to rise to power in Germany back in the 1930's merely has to watch what is happening at CNN, MSNBC, Yahoo, Huffington Post, Twitter, and other extremist leftwing anti America propaganda outlets to see that it could potentially happen here!"
"Yes, $29 buy limit went through. Next stop $28. Come on panic sellers keep doing your thang."
I remember the First day this started trading .. this was the day that changed my future .. considered myself to be a lucky one!
Doubled down and bought another 3000 shares. I love these dips. Long term hold and pay less in taxes when you sell a year later for $69.420 a share.
We win today because absolutely nothing happened. lol
"Baron Rothschild, an 18th-century British nobleman and member of the Rothschild banking family, is credited with saying that ""the time to buy is when there's blood in the streets.""So, shall we buy PLTR?"
Gonna order that black 2021 corvette I dreamed of so much
"Even if the price is going to $15, Palantir is gold and the price will come back and go forward. Don’t worry longs!"
I heard short squeeze starting March 5
There are more ballers on yahoo finance! Every board has tons of people buying 1000s of shares a day . Unbelievable
The night never sleeps in denver!
What a surprise?Still 25#$Lol this is too funny

Fellas Where do you see this stock in 5 years time ?
Get in the discount

Every time I sit on the sideline I miss all the action on every stock i have owned...when i buy the bottom falls out everytime and when I sell they all rocket!!! Hard to win.
Weld Fargo and chase won’t deposit stimulus until Wednesday.
Bought 100 at $31 and add 100 more at $24.99
$50 by end of next quarter. Latest deal hasn't filtered through so expect a sharp jump to 30s.
POWER HOUR BABY
you guys see how the dow is trading close to pre-pandemic levels. nasdaq needs to correct to those levels as well. that's why you don't put 40x multiples on a stock. It's insanity. This is going to drop to like 15 bucks probably.
"It is really funny. I love this bad sentiment and loser sellouts way more than optimistic buying spree. When the consensus is bashing the company, that is the time where you can make money. Not when everybody si hyping like mad."
https://youtu.be/cJbuDp5bLjw
did everyone hear the news about pltr teaming up with AWS whoever they are. they're new ability to unlock 50 million dollars worth of savings with companies and will only gain strength with other companies wanting the same abilities
"Normally CEO is a very top position who declared completion of sales yesterday. Probably that’s the end of selling for now. Now that the sell is completed for now, it should slowly turn green starting tomorrow. They will try to ramp up the price for a while and then probably when the price is above 45-50 they might sell again. That would be a logical action for them rather than selling this cheap."
Nasdaq broke 13k support. I do not know what will happen now but I stay long PLTR.
WoW: 10 million shares so far and we are still holding the $23.5 defense line
Palantir can predict a lot of changes and the Company uses their own software for their own gain as well. Sky is the limit!
People taking profit?

"in earnings call , they said PLTR tech will be inside every rocket every Humvee. they signed biggest deal with US defense Dept. if you heard the earnings call you know why stock recovering again ."
"Ark like PLTR .. where is the problem ? hold , buy on a dip!"
"Mute the  people. They want you to sell your shares. If you do panic and sell, there are plenty of true longs, including major institutions, that are happy to buy them."
This is going to the moon.
I dont think the interview w Karp went well. Who wants an emotional leader with a chop on his shoulder running a billion dollar company? He sounded unhibged and unfocused on the goal.
Be patient. It did this yesterday too

Do those who have taken a short position realize Revenues will most likely be close to $2B for 2021? A lot of cash!!!!
Reddit investors will set this stock go real soon $ 75 soon
Only bought this because of Cathie.
I feel like im taking an educated gamble with PLTR. The more DD i do though the better i feel . I think this company has the potential to help form the MORTAR for many solid companies . In a post COVID digital economy I see more and more cracks opening forPLTR to fill with such great innovative products.
"Confessions of a PLTR stock holder:1. I have loaded the ""F"" truck and only 9 dollars are left in my investment account2. I want PLTR to reach The Moon3. I am OK with $1 to $2 up per day and hopefully we'll cross the $30 bridge sometime in late March-20214. I have goals and dreams to become a millionaire (YEP!!! $1 MILLION dollars) using PLTR stock...5. I was told if I LOAD the ""F"" truck, I can get there sometime this year... or maybe next at the latest...6. I am just counting on $1 increments per day for PLTR stock...7. I have been listening to this song since 8am EST time: ""kiki do you love me"" to keep my hopes up8. The song ""kiki do you love me"" worked great from 8am to 10am EST when PLTR reached about $25.69. The afternoon was depressing... I am going to find me a different song for tomorrow... Any suggestions?Peace!"
Brothers in PLTR...who’s got diamond hands???
"Repost - Important people understand this. Not looking for love just want those who care to be long to understand impact.AWS - If you don’t understand the impact of this agreement. You don’t realize how this opens up an entirely new addressable market that was not even included in the investor day presentation.Palantir made a shift from having companies need to buy Gotham or Foundry in full. To deciding to offer Foundry up in modular form. Meaning they give organizations who didn’t have the budget, approval or foresight to its full capabilities org wide. The option to bite off components of Foundry and in smaller deployments.That modularity was a genius move as many medium/large business may not be able to justify massive enterprise wide deployment. However, by letting these companies dabble with aspects of Foundry they know it will lead to more wide spread adoption across other functions of those business and allow organic growth of Foundry within those accounts.Now bring in AWS partnership and you have your Trojan horse into those many medium/large businesses that were not a part of your TAM as the TAM was entirely Enterprise customer focused. Which is where the small PLTR sales team and IBM reps will pitch PLTR.AWS enterprise agreements require customers to spend x amount of money per year but that money can be spent across their platform products as well (which now includes Foundry)That’s right if you have an AWS Enterprise Agreement you are obligated to maintain a certain amount of spend across their platform products in order to maintain your EA and it’s negotiated discounts.Customers will literally be using Foundry, making palantir money simply out of necessity which will lead to further adoptionLastly - My tech sales counterparts who work for Amazon (AWS) are incentivized handsomely for selling adoption into partner solutions. Aka we just gathered an AWS sales force as well to go along with our IBM team and our direct team.AWS accessibility of Palantir for customers is a big deal."
IN AT 43!!! WITH 20K!!! still holding strong
This has to be the biggest steal in the stark market today.
Palantir or Apple? I have a lot of money in both. I am down 8k in Apple and 2k in Palantir. I need to sell some for personal reasons. Which one would you sell?
"Shoutout to all the Nostradamus’s & experts that are nowhere to be found since tech started bouncing back.Yeah, told ya this would happen.Wannabe “investors” running at the first sign of trouble, lol laughable "
"About 65 days until Q1 2021 earnings. 45% YoY growth (and take into consideration that management normally gives conservative guidance). During these next 2 months, announcements will come. So now the unskilled retail investor sells, but institutions (smart money) adds b/c understand what's coming."
Palantir will be the most important software company in the world delivered in the world's most efficient way. Period.
Thumb up if you caught the dip of PLTR in the past 1 week!
NASDAQ and S&P500 are down! It is good to be green! and not 8% down!
"With all the gov contracts pltr gets, and now commercial contracts with foundry and Apollo. That makes pltr more expensive than Lockheed in my opinion"
If it does fall in load up
Analysts expect Palantir earnings per share of 2 cents vs. a 3-cent loss a year earlier. Revenue grew 31% to $300.7 million
"Hello everyone, I am new to this forum, and I am not so sure if you use this via to be serious, or just nonsensical comments. Queation: Does anyone know or can explain why this company is almost 8 times more valuable than Globant (Glob), which is a technology company, with more experience in industry, the same business, and with practically the same level of revenue and income? I'm analysing which decision is more convenient for me. I read you.Thank you very much!"
green baby that like shows a long green bean on charts it s agood thing
Ok so insiders sold. So what? It’s nice to know that PLTR is not run by dummy’s . They did two things. They made a lot of money and they gave us an opportunity to make money too!
These bears keep acting like they know more than Cathie LMAO
"Saw many bearish people comment here right now, which usually means pltr will soaring today"
Sold some AAPL to load up more. Thanks panic sellers. 
This a long play
This stock will drop again
"still waiting for 25 then 20 to load up.... hopefully friday..unless they get deals with att, Facebook or apple etc. announced"
Full support at around $25 Dont worry guys

It's ready to take off
"when you hear ""LONG TERM"",thats Looser terminology, ceo is a big Loosa,get ready for the losses,Cathy is selling now."
Ten year Treasury is 1.672 and spiking again.
Cathie bought 2.6 million today stockwits say that numbers watching are up from 90 thousand to 130 thousand and speculate over the next 5 days the redit group have pltr in its sights for a push now I personally would rather redit stayed away we don't need them pltr is an honest company with powerful fundamentals with great investors behind it it's massively undervalued tomorrow we should see $27_28
"I'm liking this price action. All the technicals are pointing up for continued stock price appreciation, and any surprise customer/partnership announcements will be icing on the cake at this point. Onward to another all-time high! Everything is not about money .... but it sure seems to help in most cases!"
It is guaranteed we see 27-28 as PLTR pass the pivot point.
"I AM IN AT 43.51 AND HOLDING! i aint got no #PAPER HANDS! only have Diamonds. I will YOLO, I will buy these STONKS To-The-Moon, only Paper Hands will buy Tendies. We will Come TO Get Her! #WSB, long TERM #PLTR I LOVE THIS STONKIM NOT LEAVING!"

"Vanguard buying, Cathie Wood buying, Motley Fool buying, Yoda buying today also. The Force is strong here. I can feel it."
"And you cry about ""buy another stock...IBM and AWS with such resources were not able to develop what PLTR did.Try to sell box of pencils to 3M, BP, Rio Tinto and others and then sell ERP software.Try to launch a business/establish relations with Japan-good luck.European countries and Israel in terms of data protection are much havier than US, and PLTR have a big footprint in those markets with gov and commercials for years now(prior DLP)PLTR aims for small and medium sized enterprise as well"
"I feel like amidst all this panic this really needs to be said: 1) This dip was to be expected following earnings and the lock up period expiring. 2) If your long-term and believe in the technology this company brings to the table with minimal competition in the field, just turn your phone off for the next week or average down your costs. 3) THE ENTIRE MARKET is down not just PLTR. A lot of this is due to investors dashing to GME and AMC for the pumps taking place right now. Keep this in mind too.With all being said, make your own decisions but to my fellow PLTR longs just grab a coffee and take it easy"
"No worries folks, PLTR is still trading above the pivotal point which means if we hit $28.60, we could close above near $30."
I see an earnings surprise. Make your opinion heard. First thumbs up.
"Six years partnership, huge! they are really saving the moneytalk until Q1."
Holding stillFrom 43.51!!!!
"Let's break this down nice and simple.'We incurred a loss from operations of $156.6 million, which includes $241.8 million in stock-based compensation'The loss was due to a once off payment of stock-based compensation, which is very common post IPO.If this once off payment was not paid, the net profits would have been $84 million, beating the EPS.Anyone who understands this and see's what the expected growth will be for Q1 (45%) will know that Palantir is in an extremely healthy and profitable position now.Learn to control your emotions and weak hands, Palantir will be enroute to $40 within a few days"
"P/E = 2,471 at current price assuming an unlikely net profit in 2021. Cathie's dart throwing chimp Bubble recommends Bye......"

95 by summer
ark going to make a nother 100 percent on. this easy.
I am a actually really pumped for the buying opportunities over the next few weeks. This company is awesome and will not continue to be in a bear market indefinitely.
"so, where is the next dip to buy :) ? it's f.g done for for a month or more, til majority retailers go away.."
i'm a buyer under 20

Friday is Palantir Day.
"Hello guys i need your opinion please , I bought some shares @ 37$ last week im thinking to sell it next week if the price goes up and then buy again when it drops. What your thoughts please?"
This will trade at $100 before EOY. Mark it.
Government wants Robinhooders out of the market.
"Insider sales have slowed, getting ready for blast off!!"
so good news and pltr is frozen...
Cathie wood stock picking is hot as she. I love PLTR and I love Cathie too . Although am in PLTR before Cathie but when she is in I feel comfortable that someone really understand PLTR.
Think there will be a morning dip tomorrow? trying to load up before this thing takes off back to high 30s/40..
"ARK bought PLTR again today ARKK 03/3/2021 Buy PLTR 69608A108 PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES INC 1,988,500 0.2099ARKW 03/3/2021 Buy PLTR 69608A108 PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES INC 670,300 0.2079"
All this moaning and negativity on here! Almost seem to forget that this is up 175% since November! consolidation is healthy
"I’m learning. Does the 1 year chart show an inverse head and shoulders, meaning potential run up?"
"As of today, ARK owns 4,040,066 PLTR shares. That's 1 million more than last week!!"
So the ECB said they would buy more bonds (driving down rates) and the US 10Y plummeted and here we are up 5%.
Seems like the war between Hedge Fund Manager and Retail Traders is now out of box!
when will it go up?
"I was about to sell when it was $25 today...BUT, since I am GREEDY, I said WAIT....Dear Jesus: Don't disappoint me to today..."
This is like buying Tesla in 2015
Nice pop after hours. Tomorrow is looking good.
Might start to add under 23$ or 22$ market is plunging and 10year bond yield is shooting back up!
Very happy with this outcome.
"I play GME for the adrenaline rush, but holding PLTR for a 10+bagger down the road. Green Monday? We'll see!"
"Why are the insiders selling now, why don't they wait until Pltr hits $40 or $50 per share?"
"Bought at $33, sold at $45, bought back at $33, sold at $39, bought back at $32 bla bla bla. No one believes you  are timing the market, NO ONE. "

VANGUARD loaded on Palantir today..... look it up !!!
I am not rich but I put all I had a couple of days ago in this at $38 a share. I have faith in this company's business and I'm willing to tolerate this stomach turning rollercoaster... Good luck all you longs.

let's close the market green THUMBS-UP
PLTR has one of the smartest CEO.
"Cathy added 10m shares avg $23.78, do shorts think that they can get PLTR cheaper than this. They must be out of their minds !"
"It feels so good to be invested in a stock like this. Never have I been more sure of a stock, last Friday they released news of BP and today IBM? Back to back news, earnings during premarket, PLTR knows what they are doing. They care about us shareholders, stay long and strong. End of year target: $270. Position: 2k shares at $142k shares at $25"
Bunch of passive aggressive small ..... on this board :) Can't spot a trend reversal and consolidation of shares.
THIS WEEK WILL BE A HUGE REBOUNDING !!!
"If you go under LinkedIn you will under sales International positions opening up for their commercial modules, untapped virgin territory... Palantir is Microsoft in 1983...."
ARK bought 1.5 million shares yesterday. This will go back to 40 soon
100$ share Next year they have billlons and billions in the backlog
If it goes down by 30% in 4 days.. it surely can get back up in 4 days or less. Stay put and hold tightly onto your shares.
ARK spent $45million ￼ purchased ￼ PLTR shares yesterday. I believe ARK bullish on PLTR. I personally Bullish ￼ on PLTR as well￼
"shorts are celebrating ash Wednesday with their cent money. buying cheap fish while we gonna buy steak the next 364 days of the year also uh when you guys type the letter P into the search engine. uh. whats the first thing that pops up. because for me is ""pltr stock news"""
$1 down each day. LOL
"My fellow PLTR investors,1. We are ALL GREEDY, including myself2. We all want to make money3. This means you win some and you lose some4. Specifically, I have loaded my PLTR truck and put my loaded truck in my secure garage.5. I am waiting to start selling my PLTR cuties at a price of $30 minimum6. This basically means that I will make a good profit and somebody else will have to deal the PLTR cuties I sold them.7. The people who buy my PLTR cuties at $30 a piece, may sell them at a higher price or they may lose money and sell them at a loss.8. From an ethical point of view, should I feel bad if I sell my PLTR cuties at $30 and then the price drops to $25 again, and I come back in and re-buy my PLTR cuties at a cheaper price again in order to load my PLTR truck?9. In other words, I keep loading and unloading and this means other people are getting hurt.10. Why am I emotional today?Peace!"
Palantir will provide very good guidance after announcing their explosive earning. Expecting share jump to $50 range. There are only 2 trading days before the earning is announced so buy more while you can.
More contracts coming any day
Just broke that resistance. Going to go to the MOON now!  
"What does Karp say when he leaves the office? ""Another day, another dollar (down)."""
either drop below 20 so I can buy more or go up to 30 where you belong!
This would be $100 already if people didn’t run with a 4% profit. Up 300% and holding.
read what employees say...its not software its maybe more value but its labor intensive sql scripting..i am not sure why other companies couldnt do that
$100 per share ?
This is the next Tesla.
Let’s close at $26 today
Must be hard to invest in something that is always red

$28 tomorrow
55 by the end of 2021
22 is so promising! LOL
Just for fun.....everybody add a small buy.
"Let's look at today's market. Most sectors down. What is up Consumer Staples, Utilities, Communication Services, Big Tech and Semiconductors. With the weird exception of Financials this looks like a day driven by the bond market and inflation. You should be prepared for daily volatility in stocks like PLTR. If you want some peace of mind during the near future, you may want to look at a more conservative investment strategy."
"This is for the Bulls that a thinking of selling Look at your company Eyes Open Google ""Palantir Gotham 21 Launch""Watch the demo video & Sleep Well"
Just about time to buy some more.

"Amazes me how many people in these chats want other people to lose money. One of the most insecure things a man or a lady can possess is to want others to fail. Everyone is on the same boat the pros and and the new comers everyone is down. Some of you need to see the millionaires accounts, i know someone who shown me there account last week and i cant imagine looking at it right now. Some of you need to grow up."
"PLTR under $25 is a fantastic opportunity. If more civilians understood Palantir's business model, products, and services, they would be buying and holding PLTR anything under this important consolidated levels of 25 range. I expect PLTR to return to 32+ by next week."
"My fellow PLTR investors,Can someone explain to me what is going on with the stock market?PLTR was $25. Then it jumps to almost $30. Then now it's back to the $27 rangeHelp.... any fundamentals or just buy and hope for the best?Peace!"
"All pltr Investors should write elon musk and reddite on twitter, please let us make our silent all my school money is about to go"
Lmao where’d Ramses go when it turned green :p
$50 easy next week
I dream of that it will open with price $180
I am not a day trader. I bought this last week at $38. I don't care too much for the price drop because I know it is temporary. Go ahead shorts and hate this post :)
"Goldman Sachs upgraded PLTR to ""buy"" from ""neutral"", raisinf the price target from $13 to $34!!! The sky is the limit!!!"
45$ before may
Why is this still not moving up?
if this goes below $20 im throwing my life savings in it so it can double within a year.
Way over sold will go back to 32 soon
"It's time to sell, before this stock falling. I guessing next month this stock should be around $20...or worse."
Pure manipulation of the hedge funds they were aiming to hit 20 in outs and now I see they are heading to 26 where the calls are set with today’s expiration these are the same who brought it down now they are taking it up
news should be coming tomorrow
Palantir software should control the US Stock Exchange for the betterness of the citizen
I sold due to weakness in tech
to the moon! let's break 45 this month
rkt going to 120
"If you saw the interview with PLTR yesterday, the CEO did not criticize retail investors. In fact, he praised them. He said he admires that they are using their own money to build some wealth for themselves, admiring their initiatives. He just said that we have a long term focus at our company and if people want quicker returns there are other stocks on which people can focus. The irony is is that we could have short term gains with pltr if only people went long and stayed there for a little while."
"Ooooh the stock isn't going up as quick as GME...Cry me a river. You were never going to get short term gains from this, If a 6% increase isn't good enough for you, you shouldn't be investing"
YAY got me some pltr!
Last chance to onboard $SHIP. tomorrow will fly up!. Don't miss out!
25 was the bottom...people who missed the bottom are bashing so hard right now
Today +27$
Bought some $PLTR for the first time at $25. Let's see how this goes.

unfortunately this is going to be a long road.. might get back in at 22
Nevermind....huge paper loss but tomorrow will bring smile on all palantatians....

I will hold through earnings not because it is easy but because it is hard
Imagine selling yesterday. 
Slow and steadily boys! 
History bites: SEC had a contract with PLTR back in 2011
volume way up
If $PLTR stays above $22.70 it should move up to the mid 30's before drastically retracing.
up or down still chilling long term play
Look up the new short data! It’s heading to 22!LOL
"PLTR is amazing. With IBM and BP contracts in and more to go, potential is huge. Shorts keep bringing this down with the hope that we sell with panic. Stay strong"
"Another article just came out by Barron's, these insiders keep selling, unbelievable."
Cathy Wood sends out an email everyday with all the shares she’s buying and selling. I won’t be shocked if I see another 1.5 million bought.
$33 tomorrow enjoy everyone
enough said ! $40 pps
"15,000 shares here LONG PLTR LET'S GO!!! "
I’m a time traveler sent from the future. My objective is to get rich fast !!
Anyone else feel like you understand this company and the potential deeper than many around you? It's frustrating to no end when I hear friends suggesting to buy companies like Boeing because they find comfort in a household name. More specifically they lack vision or belief that something that was previously thought IMPOSSIBLE is now possible in a matter of weeks/days/minutes through Foundry & Gotham...Thankfully my vision aligns with Karps on US dominance and empowering people. My vision aligns with Thiels on go to market strategies and monopolies. My vision aligns with Cathie Woods on an eye towards the future which might provide small near term gains but mountains of gold for those patient enough to let the new world orders take place...Long since $10. Averaged up to $20. Waiting on an old company IRA rollover of 80k to purchase however many more I can get. Set it and forget it.

"Put it away and dont look at it for 6 months. Maybe dead money, but any huge contract or two, or three can make this jump 20% in a heartbeat"
One of the easiest setups buying at $25 yesterday.
"This is a 100 year hold for me. Might freeze myself down for 60 years to reap the benefits of this lovely stock. Might buy a spaceship once I sell or maybe invest in a Benjamin Button thing where I age backwards.. can probably afford both. All in all, I'm very bullish on this stock."
come back here in 2 months and check the price again if it is not over 45 $ i will give up investing in stocks. mark my word. regards
"PLTR is not an ATM machine, and Alex Karp didn’t say anything wrong. We r here for long haul, people and business may not see the importance of big data analytics, but they will in the future."
"Meanwhile Karp, Thiel, Cohen, and Sankar fiddle while Palantir burns."
got in at 21.91 boooom
Stock is holding up very well today less volatility I’m loving it
I was looking for $24.90 today. Looks like $24.50 though.
Remember when the price used to go up? Those were good times
Cathie was right about PlTR 
I’m all bullish. Cathie Wood is bullish too and oh! She bought millions of shares and she will obviously buy more and more.
ppl think that insiders selling their shares is bringing the stock down? it's obvious SHORTS running out of excuses. The market just had its worst week in months.. Gimme a break. this stock is 230% up since DPO and in a growing TAM and No competition. Go find another stock to bash. Please go play with the children at GME. Leave the adults aloe
"Took a look at open positions with Palantir. A lot of new roles looking for sales staff worldwide: Tokyo, London, Rome....they are gearing up and investing now for future growth. If you don't need the money now, let this investment ride for 2-3 years. Compounding rate of returns will be great. If you're looking to day trade, more opportunities else where that can be worth your time"
"In 2020, the Faurecia Group posted sales of #$%$14.7 billion and Palantir might save 10%, as it did to one oil company, how much would Palantir get for such work? $100 - 200 mils a year? In total that's already more than 20% increase of revenue a year of Palantir. Just my rough estim. Wacha think?"
"Downtrend broken, patience paid off and obviously the silence muting the annoying noise of bashers made that a whole lot more enjoyable ! Good job to those who held!! Follow the money"
$pltr will be in 28-30 for sure with the JNJ approval & stimulus news. Note that $pltr is been down for last 8 to 11 sessions. Shorts are going fried.
This is just the recovery! We’ll surge even bigger next week!
Just hold and buy more if its dip. Hold and soon it will go on positive. It happened so many times to me when I panic sell until I learn that we shld nvr panic sell as it only benefits those shorts.
Cathy woods just bought..omg..tjisbis gonna rocket tomorrow
3138 shares fellas!! Tomorrow we will go to the moon!! I like the stock
"every market was going up.. on pre market ... and now almost every are fallin... take a look. (well but you should looked 2 hours before to compare as me, lol). it could be the next jerome Powell interview on the day... or the last consumer reports (it says the consumers arent in the best levels)"
"I’m down about three grand in this. However… Every time I think about selling, I look at the bullish options activity and I don’t."
25 today. Who knows where it ends up Friday.
Should I add another 100?
"You're going to wish you bought Palantir 10 years from now. They're literally building the next-gen online ecosystem for businesses, and eventually for the average person. This is the company that takes us beyond the standard operating systems we have now."
Do you think that it'll work to turn off the stock market off and on again to make it go up?$nio $tsla $aapl $amzn $pltr $arkk
Cramer said he's not a buyer of Palantir. That means you should buy and it's a good investment.
At least this company isn’t some old rust bucket company.... like Sears.
Cathie Wood: The recent sell off in tech was a broadening of the bull market just like in 2016/17 and is good news for the bull market moving forward.Josh Brown (one of my favorite traders on Fast Money): Cathie Wood is exactly right.

"If you are posting about how bad PLTR will do today at 6am, you clearly don’t know that premarket doesn’t matter. For those of us that have been here a long time, there have been plenty of days where this goes green after being deep in the red premarket."
Omg I bought 5k yay earnings next week after it’ll skyrocket

"Our price action is slightly delayed of Snowflake. The mutual market caps were both in the 40 Billion range (41.5 to their 46.5 at the bottom) That says a lot about our company, 3X better and a 12% market discount to Snow. Warren Buffet should buy Palantir."
PLTR and GME kept strong today
"Krap Yap, stock redKrap no Yap, stock greenNo Yap from Krap!"
I bought the dip. And if it dips further I will buy some more. Long and Strong. I liked it well before Ark liked it. I like it even more now.

Let’s go!!!!
"AWS - If you don’t understand the impact of this agreement. You don’t realize how this opens up an entirely new addressable market that was not even included in the investor day presentation.Palantir made a shift from having companies need to buy Gotham or Foundry in full. To deciding to offer Foundry up in modular form. Meaning they give organizations who didn’t have the budget, approval or foresight to its full capabilities org wide. The option to bite off components of Foundry and in smaller deployments.That modularity was a genius move as many medium/large business may not be able to justify massive enterprise wide deployment. However, by letting these companies dabble with aspects of Foundry they know it will lead to more wide spread adoption across other functions of those business and allow organic growth of Foundry within those accounts.Now bring in AWS partnership and you have your Trojan horse into those many medium/large businesses that were not a part of your TAM as the TAM was entirely Enterprise customer focused. Which is where the small PLTR sales team and IBM reps will pitch PLTR.AWS accessibility of Palantir for customers is a big deal. Don’t listen to a word the village idiot Ramses says to make you think otherwise."
"Same for pltr . Buy and keep . 6 mths down the road , see who is laughing :)"
PLTR customer base has only one direction: exploded up.PLTR SP has only 1 direction: go up.Keep buying if you can.
No stock can withstand to this magnitude of selling in the market.
"Someone bought $PLTR Size: 652293 Price: 24.26 Time: 16:01 Amount: $15,824,628.18"
Float is too big. Brace for 1 for 10 reverse split.
The American Rescue Plan has been passed.Merrick Garland has been confirmed.Palantir is up.Today is a good day.
I'm long on PLTR but if Alex Karp shows up again bashing like what he tried to do I'm out. The guy might be on top of the world atm but not everybody has a billionaire for a college buddy. His generalizations of the valley mentality are very articulate but mostly bigotry as well as extremely shortsighted for a company looking to expand in the private sector. Ms. Karp chillout and buy a ssl cert for your previous venture.
This is not the time to be long the market guys
"Guys, whatever happens this will be 100 dollars at the end of the year!!"

Palantir STRONG!!!1. Insiders selling: PLTR is holding its head up2. Market is down some 500 points: PLTR is holding its head up3. Shorts trying to push PLTR down: PLTR is holding its head upWell: We have a winner in PLTR...

why not go up and down liek other stock just go down
"I can give you a 100% guarantee that the PLTR price will be either up, down or the same tomorrow! and I stand by it 100%!"
Mind blowing interview
Anyone still holding from 43?
PLTR has 1.5 billion shares outstanding and the media harps about a meager 2.7 million shares sold by some insiders. What a flipping joke for content. There are various company insiders all over the freaking place buying/selling stocks. It happens everyday somewhere in the Russel 2000 index & S&P 500.
So close to pushing past $24.
why is pltr acting like pltr :'(
"I don’t know which is sweeter, a 6% gain or knowing the shorts are realizing they picked the wrong battle to fight. Cover and get out is the best advice I can give them. If shorts can’t see the writing on the wall, than they deserve every penny they lose. You’ve all been warned."
Holding up at 30$ for everyone
Buckle up boys and girls.
"Just so we are clear on how things work. ""Shorters"" are professional traders with access to real capital and armies of quant's. They may have a script that scrapes keywords from this board to make a retail sentiment indicator for a dashboard. You can yell at them all you want on here if it makes you feel better."
Shorts caught in a vice- backs getting broken.
"Where is CovertAction? Oh, where is that wit and fount of all wisdom regarding investing....? How we miss that razorlike sarcasm that was always wrong....ah, good times."
I'm old. I just replaced my Farrah Faucett poster with one of Cathie Woods.
Worth the wait
"They dragged the Nasdaq to the 100 Day MA, they got their buying dip. DOW and S&P are just coasting."
PLTR is a future
Is this a squeeze? I do reckon it is.
The he company doesn’t have bad news. So don’t panic guys. It will be up in a few days or weeks. Don’t sell now and regret later. My opinion..
once market settles this is going to 40ties glad to be here now
Is PLTR a good buy at this price or wait for a dip?
"Little volatility today, I'm happy with that. Long term folks"
"Great seeing 2% increase AH. What drove that, btw?"
No one see the future But we know alteady having big contract with bigest army in the world is not easy . Just wait Ofcource it will fly next few days

to the moon indeed. let the AWS news sink in for a bit then institutions will realize soon enough what just happened!
Oh why didn’t I buy it when it was $24? Because you lack conviction and guts. Because you don’t understand the business and can’t assess its value. More than anything you don’t have the right stomach for investing. Your mind is less important and is what leads you astray.
AMZ WSB partnership with PLTR !
"When Everyone wants to buy the dip, there will be no dip but big green tmr!"
Let make it st. Patrick
oh wow nice little burst there
Cramer is poking at Cathie Wood and Palantir. What a montebank.
Nothing positive these days
"I have a feeling that PLTR might go to the 20's.For some reason, it doesn't matter if there is good news such as:....a. The passing of the stimulus package....b. Cathie Wood buying millions of shares....c. Amazon signing contracts with PLTR....d. IBM signing contracts with PLTR....e. Etc...So, it seems that we are going to just let PLTR work its way down to $18, $19, $20, $21, and $22...The hope here is that 6 to 12 months from now, the PLTR stock allocations will stabilize and then we start going to the $30's again...Oooh! Well LET IT BE..."
Avg SaaS company trades around 10x revenues. I’ll PLTR again below 20x revenues. Not at 38x lol.

"I believe this dip is Options expiration; No other reason why it should go down 10_12%. Nasdaq in correction mode, still 1000 points + to go down"
"I would encourage all to take the time to read the recent ""Earnings Call Transcript"". It is often difficult to take in all that is said during a live ""Earnings"" call, but in the quiet of your own time, you can spend the time digesting and understanding what was communicated. Not only have I taken the time to read the transcript, but I have also complete follow-up research on key points I want to understand better. For example, there is so much chatter about the US government being a single point of failure because so much of Palantir's business is with them. For this reason, they must diversify their customer base to grow and thrive. Although this would most certainly be beneficial, it belays the fact that the US government alone spends 4.4Trillion per year - 12% for Defense, 23% for Healthcare, and 25% other (as an example). Palantir only did 610Million in business with the US government (in 2020) because in the prior models they focused on the IT sector within the government. However, with the investments in the end-to-end workflows (Apollo and Foundry), they can now focus on nearly 250Billion worth of business with the US government. The deal with IBM was made possible because the investments made to improve the cradle to grave process (or as they say mud to space) delivered 84% gross margin - do you know what that means? They can now bring on channel partners because there is enough compensation there for everyone to be paid accordingly. Furthermore, this means that they can now extend this offering to other channel partners. Another note-worthy nugget was the fact that they already have 2.8B in the sales pipeline with an average contract duration of 3.8years. Do you understand what that means - customer stickiness! And the final point I will draw attention to was their projection for sales of 30% compounded annually for the next 5years (2025). A question was asked by one of the shareholders - can Palantir sustain such growth? Shyam’s response was thorough and he ended with this line....""And these are examples of why we're confident in our long-term growth of being greater than 4 billion in 2025"". For these and many more reasons I will be a long-term holder of this stock."
Buy as soon as market opens or hold?
Take a look on 6 months graph. Palantir 264% growth. I don’t know why you guys are panicking? Give this stock sometime it will grow more.
P.S. I love to see the billionaires crying on TV because they lost billions shorting GameStop. I hope the same happens here.
Up 4%
They announced new deal with 3M this morning...
Good to see the Premarket green! Hope we end this week with $30+
"Alex Karp kindly asked for any short term investors who didn't see the potential to simply leave.Say goodbye and say helloSure it's good to see you and it's time to goDon't say ""Yes"", but please don't say ""No""I don't want to be lonely tonight"
Post earnings is $60............
Close above $28.28 would be super bullish. Retest of $30 today expected.
"The Stimulus Bill opened the door for PLTR to access the following budgets...-$47.8 billion to detect, diagnose, trace, and monitor COVID-19 infections, while requiring HHS to implement a national strategy for testing, contact tracing, surveillance and mitigation of COVID-19-$8.5 billion for vaccine activities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including $7.5 billion to prepare, promote, administer, monitor and track vaccines and $1 billion to improve vaccination rates;-$750 million for CDC global health activities efforts, including global health security, global disease detection and response, global health protection, global immunization, and global coordination on public health;-$500 million for CDC data modernization and forecasting;"
This will rocket on Monday.
"Literally the worst stock you can buy today. In an insanely overvalued market, PLTR looks expensive, really, really expensive. With the average contract under $100,000 per client and less than one billion in annual sales, how on earth can anyone justify a $50 BILLION market cap? They can't. This is a MIME reddit stock that will be trading in the single digits next year. Get out or better yet, don't buy into this fraud company."
Who else thinks it’s gonna close above $30 today?
Cathie price target is $ 75 I like it
See yaa $45 soon !!!
Anytime the fed even mumbles about opening its mouth the market always falls...
"If Snowflake is still worth 50 Billion today, we are worth 60 Billion. Load up Institutions so you have skin in the game and pivot to bullish.Well, Roblox Fake DPO'd with the Wallstreet crooks managing it and closed up with a 38 Billion market cap. What a joke, it was valued by them at 4 Billion last year... The abuse our company's share price and strong fundamentals take at the hands of these crooks is totally laughable."
"Like I said, green"
Discount buy is about to expire
ARK now has over 4M shares... last week was 2.3M...
"Lot of folks taking a bath here. It's tempting as hell to sell when everyone is trashing the ""valuation"". Notice how no one trashes the products, business model or management team. No company is esoteric for sure, but that will pass, but it's passing like a kidney stone. Don't watch and don't give your shares away."
"Might as well lay it out here, 2025 PT $350"
30 more minutes before this hits 40

John...It's OK...Let it go...Release PLTR and let it fly...It's OK...There is nothing wrong with letting PLTR flying high...We are all praying for you...
Yay! My another 34k shares order executed @23.81...holding long with 856k shares
Why is everyone panicking we knew this time would be volatile and we know it could be back to 28 in a day
Open above $27 tomorrow?
5200 PLTR added
Right now all shorters watch spy and qqq and with their fingers on the button. Surely for us as well as for many other stocks. Scary moment.
"If some on this board make decisions based on the posts here, you should be investing, the market needed a correction but in Q2/3 this will be flying"
"Open admission. Got in here at $10. Have bought on FOMO and dips from as high as $38 to as recent as $23.My position has grown 3x since initial entry and my cost average has increased 2x going from $10 to about $20. Rough times watching account drop over 150k since the ATH of $45. AbsolutelyPlay the coulda/woulda/shoulda game all the time. As I did not sell a single share and I’m left holding it all. That said, end game was NEVER $45 per share. I’m looking for 8-10x that share price and I’m rather confident with patience I’ll get it.Can’t wait for these shares to settle with all the institutions who were able to shake out the ill informed returned investors. Was hoping we could all get rich together but I guess that’s reserved for those of us who actually poured hours into their due diligence.No better tech company in town. That will be a fact to the world in very short time."
"Lol bears are so funny, whole of tech is down and they think their best position is still a good idea. Trust me on this, I know what you don’t, PLTR is going to punish anyone shorting below $30 by the middle of April."
I do hope that we get a real good pop in the morning.
whose gonna buy this dip
Trillion dollar market cap. Here we come. To the moon.
"The trains has left the station bye bye, $23 hello $50.."
"@nvstsyle I appreciate your contribution because it helps affirm my decision to buy more at the support level. I am sitting mainly on cash and 4350 shares I bought all the way up to 36. As a senior, going all in one stock can sometimes give pause, but I don’t feel fear investing in this company. It is like MSFT I had in the 80’s. Some folks on this board give me insight that my ex-brokerage firm Never took time to provide. I left them in 2007. I trust myself. I have done a crate load of due diligence, and I am not concerned. Moreover, certain posters have supplemented my learning curve; I am grateful to them. To all of y’all who help me, many many thanks. I feel lucky with you and Palantir."
I bought 25 call selling at 26$
Cathie becomes majority shareholder soon
The entire market is down today and people are acting like it is PLTR's fault... LMAO
Someone is keeping it under $30 because there is a lot of calls expiring today at that price!! $30 triggers a jump to $40s !!
Looks like we may be going up from here. I am in 100 shares at 28.71
"Let's see:People are still saying the usual buzzwords (claiming this will make PLTR go up):1. ARK Invest = Cathie Wood = Buys more PLTR2. Keep the hope alive = Long term (5 years from now?) PLTR will go ""To The Moon""3. Palantir employees are done selling their shares4. IBM and PLTR signed contracts5. Amazon and PLTR signed contracts6. Biden is going to sign the Stimulus BillWell, I have to add one more:...a. I ate breakfast this morning (TWO French croissants and a delicious HOT Starbuck coffee)...b. I drank a whole bottle of water...c. I went to the bathroom...d. So, I expect PLTR to go up today!!!Fair enough?"
Slow and steady. We like it that way

Strong Short squeeze on its way and very well supported by CNBC this time!
Will $24 be the low for 2021?
The only stock I know that is down when the market is up and the news is good and up on no news and the market is down.
let's take this to the moon
"Did anyone ask Krap, why he never made a profit since 2003 despite giving management generous free stock option programs?"
The march to $15-20 resumes. Lube up longs.
"I think PLtR can hit $50-$60 in no time. But just a thought though, if Reddit could bring a troubling company like GME to its high, they can certainly buy up to $200 in no time. The difference is if the Reddit decided to push this up, then they are smarter this time around because this is a great company. Just my 2 cents!"
"PLTR may go up this week, next week, or in a couple weeks. It will be going up, it's an investment."
Allegrophobia!
"Bought 500 @ $25 - Unlike Nickola, Palantir has a product and is actually growing the business. The Q4 loss is not really a loss, it was a write down due to stock based compensation."
"Regardless of earnings, this company is solid and if you have done your own research you would understand why. If you’re scared then take your money and move it else where."
"When it breaks 23, look out below"
Keep shorting as much as you can. Short interest is at 18% pretty high.Get ready for a big squeeze when a big contract is annouced
Time to buy the dip?
Buh bye.

"Before next earnings report and demo scheduled for April under $30/share is a great price....However if you are planning to invest for a long term, current evaluation is just a little fraction comparing to the value of this company....Some people are claiming that companies such as Databricks and Snowflake are competitors....That is not true.. Products are complements of each other...."
who wanna bet this goes to 15? maybe 11 dollars?
Algo owners what to print those options today!
"This guy has big Kohonas, its going to be a wild ride but in the end we will WIN BIG!!!!!"

"Believe Rdy and Bull are the smartest guys in the room.now, w/ even a small announcement from Palantir on biz capture, it’s going up significantly."

Futures just turned green lets see a 20% plus day tomorrow. I loaded on SKLZ also today. It dropped almost 20% in the last days.
"Buy the more shares, the federal reserve will bump it again, again, again"
Take profits when you can. Can make a lot of money with this volatility.
"Ok, time to go up now PLTR. Please?"
"It will take a few more days to break out of its current pattern. It's more of a bullish pattern but it's still has small chance of breaking down. This stock took 5 month to reach 39-45. Even if it break down, it still can get back to 40 in no time. This company has great potential and foundation. Long investor shouldn't worry at all. Short investors just are trying to make profit in short term. Once they make profit, they will have to buy back and will push it up again."
oh man 29 in play as people see how oversold this was
"Today finally we will break the strong resistance 26$, with strong volume we go straight to 30$.Let’s the party begin bulls!!"
AMAZON AND PALANTIR LETS GOOOO
just bought 1000 shares @23.75.... to the moon!!!!
"It is funny, Jim Cramer advised Cathie to close her ETF instead of taking money and investing when she bought millions of PLTR. Cathie reply - ETFs can not be closed like MFs. (Hmm. Jim doesn't know but advises her). She also said they double down on stocks when they think their high conviction stocks are cheap. Jim and entourage think - this is a day of value stocks and stupid of her to invest in high growth stocks. Too narrow thinking. She is positioning her ETFs to lift off next ride."
Picked up more March $28 calls for $0.66 each
"Some point today I'm adding , maybe down this week but this company is going to expand and the money will come back .."
Yeah this a long term hold. As in it will take 20 years for it to reach $30 again
"it's a slow climb, bit it's a climb and not a decline. Have faith in PLTR. Honestly believe with money coming to peoples accounts and states opening up that next week will explode for PLTR. "
"Apple looking attractive again, algo's are running their course... Cathie talked about being caught flat footed by Wallstreet algorithms. She underscored the importance of AI and grabbing lion-share of the TAM early and forgo short-term profits. Which is slated in the Trillions. She basically repeated Alex Karp's words to investors at Earnings."
Someone is really trying to keep this under $29 I hope they fail.
"Fantastic opportunity to invest on your future.Buying more, may not get another chance to do so."
Hold and be rewarded later in the year....
"How’s that Amazon news working out for you longs, huh?"
18 by next Friday market will crash stimulus didn’t work sleepy jo is sleeping on his basement
BE GREEDY WHEN OTHERS ARE SCARED!
"classic but today i sold pltr, tomorow 25% up Whatever enjoy it guys not my month"
@anna your comment just made my day
Hoping to break $30 soon.
"I wonder if the DNC will use Palantir Foundry to help integrate disparate voter fraud sources and make the best possible use of their criminal media accomplices? The DNC could use Palantir's Foundry software to gain further insight into its forged ballot harvesting across the country, from manufacturing to transporting across state lines, from voter machine rigging to dead voter generation."
Looks like Palantir is the light on the shore for a sinking boat..
$30 by Friday in the bank
A three month run to glory........$175?
This is going to rocket into the 40s next week
Buying a likely dip this week.
Get a free stock when you join webull. I just got a share of tesla for joining. https://act.webull.com/k/CX3WA9e15h4s/main
Holding steady.
Waiting it to up 10% at Pre market
"I’m new to this convo so forgive me if its already been mentioned but I haven’t seen it so I’ll mention it now. Palantir is contracted by the LAPD, the 3rd largest police force in the nation at 10k officers. Thats what convinced me to buy. I’m in at 2400 shares @ $13ish! GO GO GO!!!"
Big investors example Ark are loading up recently. Don't you trust their judgement? This stock is a gem
Sold my Fisker and bought more PLTR today
Probably the the janitor at Palantir selling some of his shares
This will dip until 11am and then finish 12% up by EOD
"P/E = 2440 at share price 24.4 $, assuming the unlikely - they make net profit. A real bubble. Twice as overrated as TSLA."
This stock is not good for my blood pressure.Added more today and not going to look at this stock for the next month.
Bought 100 more at $29 today
Timing the market is mainly just luck. It's so easy to say buy low sell high. Just buy and hold if you trust the company. Fundamentals did not change these past red days!
"Cathie Woods purchased double the shares she had since last month. 4 Million shares as of now. Now rank 32. Palantir passed Salesforce, This holding will be positioned in the top 15."
Wow where have all the bears gone
We’ll see a relief rally tmr! PLTR is going to surge back Bigger than ％！
It’s the year 2022 and Palantir is 150$ a share
"CEO is rightFor example Google and Facebook will take your data, monetize it, and restrict your freedoms on their platforms. They also trash the country that allows them to do this and they won’t support the government that gives them their safety. They need to be taxed to hell because there is no free lunch."
"Bloody, tomorrow is the first day of Palantired IBM cloud. lets go up!"
"ARKW sold 149,850 shares and ARKK bought 481,772 shares today.So a net purchase of 331,922 shares."
"So many bears crying, can’t stand seeing pltr move sideways in this market. "
"Just Curious. If PLTR doubled in a week, you would normally anticipate a slight sell off/consolidation afterwards. SO.......What would most of you do with your shares? Hold long and strong ? Sell a few to skim a profit but hold a core amount? Sell all of them and move on? I am not trying to BE IN ANYONE'S BUSINESS here. I am just curious what other retail investors think."
Karp is the person I want running my company true to his conviction!!
"See all marker Tesla , apple amazon all are redSome things is wrong with market So just wait Wait there is nothing to do more"
"Right here. Slightly green, so going to be a great day. Especially since the Nasdaq is going to sink. Poor longs."
"I'm actually laughing so hard at these bashers. First off, no real investor has ever posted a GIF to get a point across and secondly Palantir is doing something right if there are this many haters. So honestly down vote this post, bash it, talk trash - because it justifies my point :)"
"PLTR is not a scam lol, and I'm holding just a couple hundred shares long. But, seems Cohen and the other insiders are doing quite a lot of selling & Trading in the millions which is sure messing with our share price. I haven't been thru many lockup's on my other investments so my question is this, is just a normal thing around lockup period, I mean we did know some would happen. I did look at other charts and saw that it does often take a few weeks sometime to recover, but they usually do. I'm in it for the long haul, but if they continue to do this all year I'll be trimming for sure. Thankfully I got in very early. What are others thoughts that have been thru lockup periods before and have factual info that this is normal?"
What a good day for pltr haha all considering 
anyone standing in front of this train is really wrong...I'm helping you out here win win don't sell this
Anything under 30$-35$ won’t last long. This is a 100$ stock minimum!!!!! That’s why Aunti Cathie loaded up last week almost 300 million dollars!!!!! Follow Ark!!!
Amazon gets exclusive NFL Thursday night games.... tech stox going up from here bc that makes as much sense as anything in this market
Will fly tomorrow
Tom nash
Alex Karp is a great American!
How much $$$ will you lose today?
"to be honest, quite surprise that it is holding quite well if u go compare to those even big tech stock. overreaction on the unemployment."
comment below to place your hypothetical bet on pltr stock price tomorrow!!! buy in is 10k to bet. minimum 500$ bet
"Dumac fund filled today : 2,828,000"
Karp's confidence during the CNBC interview makes me think we will have some 'big' deal surprises that will be announced over the next few months.
It's clear that the entire movement in the stock has been due to the treasury yields spiking due to inflation expectations rising due to the stimulus package. What's to stop the 10 year treasury from hitting 2% after the stimulus package is passed?
Will rip hard monday! Cathie wood baby! Loaded up 3.3millions worth 70million dollars and you tell me 18 million dollars sold by insiders! It’s nothing! Follow Cathie!
@tom
"No reason to sell right now, today was a slight pullback after a great Friday. Lockup is over. It’s onlyup from here, just be patient"

OMG ARK INVESTMENT BUY BUY BUY. i I Love Catty Wood
"Karp is a visionary along the lines of Bezos, Musk, Gates, and Jobs. It won't be long before he joins their ranks."
Since they announced partnership it’s going over $30 bucks today
"You think YOUR stock is down? Think about the poor insiders. After all these years with the company, they saw their almost-unlocked shares at $45. Finally, after salivating over the $45 price a few months ago and still not able to sell, the long-awaited unlock date arrives and they have to sell at low to mid $20s."
i get the feeling this will rallly regRdless of mRket its yptrend now
My Palantir hat and shirt just arrived!! Perfect timing for a BIG day tomorrow! I’ll be wearing it all day.

I missed having a new high for PLTR...
"Hello, any buyers out there?"
Bought more at $25.00....I suggest you do the same. Good luck.
consolidating?
"sign of bottom: low volume, lots of bearish posts"
Still undervalue buy buy..!
When is the SEC going to act and do their job with Hedge Funds criminal activity?
Earnings are gonna be great
Hopefully the PM price will transition into a gradual 10% rise today!
Dont come on here and act like being down is specific to palantir. The whole market is down right now!
Breaks 25 and this will play in the teens
"Are we done with PLTR executives sell off? It seems they sold 5M shares, and all bought by Ark."
now that my friend is what i call great news
Me looking for the first dip like...
"PLTR will be in the hundreds in the future. It's for long term investment, which is years. Don't pay attention to the short term fluctuation in the market. If you are still worried, look up ARKK and ARKW holdings. They hold more than 16 million shares PLTR. Buy and hold the fear is a way to invest in this market."
By Thursday we’ll be around 35-38...
PLTR gaining momentum. Tomorrow it should be close to $30
Yahoo has entered into a short term contract with PLTR to clean up it’s message boards
where is cathie wood speaking?
Hurry up FOMO's while quantities under $30 last! IMO
Never been a PLTR shareholder. A stock with 1 billion floatable shares takes alot of institutions to move the share price. Its gonna be awhile before it hits 50...
2800 shares and getting more. LETS GO!!!!
Look at Fintel. All institutions buying and doubling down! Going to run on us! Follow the money!!
They want the $25's to expire worthless....
oh wow. look at this rally. lol. but why?
Ark bought 50 million shares. There’s no shares to buy anymore.
"Yep, I am buying from the fearful."
$31 tomorrow !!!
I loaded up at $22 ! Feeling good about PLTR's future !
Good day Palentarians
"So, here is my situation:Since I loaded the boat, I missed THREE OPPORTUNITIES to sell and make a ""good small profit""If I did sell, in each of these THREE OPPORTUNITIES, I would have made a few 1000 dollars in profit...and I can buy back at a lower entry point at $21 or $22THE POINT: Is holding LONG term a bad idea?"
Paper hands
thumb up if ur buying
"Why is everyone so worried about market going down just let it crash and get it over with, it always comes back,always has always will"
Heck with all the short interest we could run to 40 today!!
"As living in Europe, is Karp's interview on Cnbc after closing bell ?"
"The CEO and Elon are the most down to earth dudes, Karp and Musk have very similar insights to silicon valley bs. I love it."
Cathie Wood just bought 5M shares!!!!
"I will sell half my position when it reaches 65. Then, I will wait until it reaches 50s and all in! "
my price target for this is 200 by dec 21
day traders must hate this stock 
"ARK bought 130K today, total today: 16,027,007, which reminds me about James Bond. LOL"
This is the last week of this sell off none sense. I would load up big time here....last time you’ll see 20s
Y2014: PLTR signs 1.2 BUSD contract with BP for 10 years. Y2021 BP deepens ties with PLTRY2021 PLTR tie-up with IBM is its largest.Y2021 PLTR team up with AWSEndless list...
This is getting ready to fly when market opens
"I love PLTR and is my biggest holding at more than 30%, but come on ,stay real. F...king Noob investors want the stock to jump 10% a day, 100% in 2 months, 500% in EOY. Dont ""GAMBLE"" your emergency $$, max out your margin, steal from your mother in law. Ya'll watching too much youtube stock Mogue's video. They are making more $$ from YT than from the market. Invest the $$ you won't need it in 5 years minimum. Talk is easy, if the stock plunges 50%, let's see you kids gonna have to balls to . If you really trust this stock, buy more when you get paid no matter it's sunny or rainy. In the end, market is from impatient to the patient. "
"Oh what a gift to insiders and institutions, they will start unloading at the open."
"So many overreactions from “longs” and trolls during every green or red day .It’s always either:1.PLTR is going to the moon by next weekOr2.PLTR is trash and is a bag holder’s worst nightmare.The reality: a little red day/week/month or Green Day/week/month is irrelevant in 2-5 years of growth.- PLTR is not a 10 bagger overnight (at least by the odds), it’s a 10+ bagger over the next 2-5 years.Check the comments, been consistently preaching this since DPO and I’ve done very well with it since buying at $9.45.This company cannot be evaluated based upon the traditional “fundamentals” like current profits etc. It is something unique and quite frankly, has tons of room for growth on the commercial side of things, excluding big brother who isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.“Fundamentals” sound great, doesn’t always apply as you have to adjust to the current market where anything goes and tech is overvalued as a whole, not a PLTR issue.-Citron did their damage, others have downgraded this company as well, and the lock up period is over. This stock is a few catalysts away from serious gains to the $40s and possibly $50 if it’s substantial enough.Either way, patience is key. The stock market rewards the guy who’s willing to wait it out > the guy who panics on every red day, 9/10 times."
I am beginning to forget how happy I felt whenever I checked the PLTR price in green...
I’ve been laughing all day at the bashers over the last week... I knew this will have its day and it will keep going next week!! 
when sankar 3 exercutive sell stock then you shouldsell stock donot hold or buyit it just probably show they have no confidence in the company and company business model andprobably see no growth if theysell stock then youdeserveto sellyourstock also scaryscary crashbackbelow $13 soon beveryvery afraid tolossalotlot more money get what you can now or getalotlot less then $13 soon
Don’t worry be happy!!
I am not shaking... love this stock
"Zoom out to 6m chart, and look at the insane volume of shares that were traded during lockup. Consider the fact that it actually made it to the other side without dropping below 25. (Miracle? Mithril?) Now play with the idea that long institutions and insiders now own close to a majority of the shares and they won't sell anytime soon - what volume is then required to make this move quite drastically upwards? My bet is that it won't take much, as the actively traded shares are actually not that many, less than 600 million, which is basically pre-lockup levels. With a loooong list of catalysts ahead, probably including but not limited to, Apple, Facebook, this is perfectly positioned to have FOMO applied to a limited number of shares. Perfect storm conditions, but we'll have to ride out this current situation first."
